      Shawn and Gus sit in office chairs, bored.  Suddenly, Shawn 
      scoots himself backwards past Gus.  Gus looks up.  






                                                                            (CONTINUED)PSYCH - Episode 2004 "Zero to Murder in Sixty Seconds" - Network Draft  4/24/07 2.

                                  GUS
                    I know what you're trying to do, 
                    Shawn, and it's not gonna work.  
                    I'm not buying.  

      Without saying a word, Shawn smugly reaches below his chair 
    and releases the hydraulic switch, lowering it to the floor.

                                  GUS (CONT D)
                    Oh, it s on now.

      They quickly position themselves and race the office chairs 
      down the hallway, backwards.  It's neck and neck, until 
      Lassiter steps into the hallway, causing a two-chair pile up.  
    He dresses them down.

                                  LASSITER
                    Listen, you two.  Unlike everyone else around 
                    here, I m not fooled by the fact that you 
                    wear grown-up clothes, have mastered 
                      rudimentary levels of communication and 
                    somehow manage to feed yourselves.  I see you 
                    for what you are -- children.  So do me a 
                    favor.  Goof off on your own time and not 
                    while grown-ups are working.

                    I think I got a boo-boo.

      Lassiter snarls and proceeds to exit.  Gus shoots Shawn a 
      look and they quickly follow him.

                    Spencer, there s no easy way to tell 
                    you that I consider you a waste of the

      Lassiter ignores him and exits outside.


      Shawn, Gus and Lassiter enter.  They approach the RESTAURANT

      Shawn leads Chelsea, the hostess from the restaurant, inside 
    the office.  They re both a little giddy.

                                  SHAWN
                          (re: office)
                    So, as promised, here s your tour 
                    of where it all happens.

    She looks around.  Shawn then realizes the place is littered 
      with his toys.  Wastebasket basketball goal, various Nerf 
      aerial toys, video game system, etc.

                                  SHAWN (CONT D)
                    Uh... my partner Gus isn t as 
                    focused as I am...  He plays a lot. 
                    Not like me.  I m always working.

    She pulls Shawn close.

                    Then I feel pretty lucky you called 
                    to ask me out.  

                                  SHAWN
                    I happened to wrap up that case 
                    earlier than anyone thought and 
                    found myself free for the evening.

      They start making out but something is bugging Shawn.  He 
      thinks out loud.

                    Nothing.  Sorry.

      They start kissing again.  After a beat, Shawn is again 
      distracted by his thoughts.

    He pulls away, caught up in his own thoughts.

                                  SHAWN
                    Or could it be...?  No.  That s 
                    never happened before.

                    This is something much worse.

    He suddenly grabs his coat and heads for the door.  He stops 
    and turns around.

    Gus opens the door to Shawn, still in his clothes from his 
      date. 

                                  GUS
                    Shawn?  What are you doing here 
                    this time of night?

      Shawn enters with a head of steam.

                                  SHAWN
                    We got a problem, buddy.  I think I 
                    was wrong about the chop shop case.

                                  GUS
                    What do you mean  wrong?   It wasa 
                    chop shop and the guy they 
                      apprehended wasguilty.  Case 
                    closed.

                                  SHAWN
                    I know all that, but something s 
                    bugging me about how easy it was.  
                    I mean, for that Wally guy to have 
                    such a tightly controlled and 
                    intricate operation, one that s 
                    eluded the police for so long, and 
                    then to slip up by stealing a 
                      detective scar from in front of 
                    the policestation... it just 
                    doesn t make sense. 

                                  GUS
                    Sure it does.  One of his guys got 
                    sloppy.

                                  SHAWN
                    But that doesn t explain why the 
                    evidence that identified Wally as 
                    the ring-leader was allthere in 
                    the shop, waiting to be found.  And 
                    I could ve sworn I saw him smiling 
                    as they put him in the squad car.  
                    No, I think I solved the crime I 
                    was supposedto solve.  Not the one 
                      I should vesolved.

                                  GUS
                    Okay, you re not making any sense 
                    and I happen to be busy, so if you 
                    don t mind...

                    Maybe I kept pushing it back 
                    because I was always helping 
                    someone.  Like when I had to enter 
                    a Civil War re-enactment.  Or when 
                    I was getting my butt kicked by a

                    I was wondering, what do you think 
                    about adding a field-demonstration?

      Shawn sits across the glass from WALLY a weasly, cagey type.

                    Like I was saying, there are some

                                  SHAWN
                    That s just it.  What chop-shop 
                    artist steals a cop s car and 
                    doesn t chop it up?  It s like you 
                    wanted it to leave a trail.

                                  WALLY
                    Leave a trail, don t leave a trail.  
                    It wouldn t do any good.  You guys 
                    caught me quick.  All red-handed.  
                    I was like,  What?  And the cops

                    Gotta go.

      Wally rises, exits.  Shawn crosses to the visitor s log and 
      signs out.  SHAWN VISION - Shawn quickly fans through the 
      pages of the clipboard.  As the pages fly by, SHAWN VISION - 
    he sees three prior logs for Prisoner 1906 and each one has 
    the signature  Johnny G.  besides it.  


      Gus, draped in a spa robe, enters with an SPA ASSISTANT.

                                  ASSISTANT
                    Your massage therapist will be 
                    right with you, Mr. Guster.  In the 
                    meantime, please relax and hydrate.

                                  GUS
                    Thank you.

    Gus takes in the tranquil surroundings and breathes a sigh of 
      relief.  He takes a seat along with other spa patrons.  He 
      leans back and closes his eyes.  Suddenly, a patron behind 
    him begins spritzing himself, catching Gus in the second-hand 
      spritz.  He politely turns around.

                                  GUS (CONT D)
                    Excuse me, but would you mind--

    The patron turns around.  It s Shawn, also in a spa robe.

                    Shawn!  What are you doing here?!

      Gus  reaction immediately ruins the relaxed atmosphere.  The 
      other patrons turn and look.

                    only other person to visit him, 
                    besides me and his lawyer, was a 
                     Jonny G.   So I looked into it.  
                    After Jonny Garrison and Jonny

                    It opens up a whole other angle to 
                    this case.  What if Jonny G. is 
                    using stolen car parts in his shop

    Gus winces in pain and rubs his back.

    He lowers a lift, revealing Gus  pharmaceutical-rep issue 
      Echo, now  frivolously  and  ridiculously  tricked out.  Gus 
    is incensed.

    The tricked out Echo is stopped at a light.  Shawn drives 
      with Gus in the passenger seat.

                                  GUS
                    This is a companycar, Shawn.  I 
                    have to visit clients in this.

                                  SHAWN
                    Would you relax?

                                  GUS
                    I can t believe you spent all the 
                    money we got for the chop-shop case 
                    on this.  What, you couldn t find 
                    any magic beans?

                                  SHAWN
                      I re-invested into the business.  
                    When we figure out what s going on 
                    at Jonny G. s shop and re-solvethe

                    And we immediately turn my car back 
                    the way it was.  

                                  SHAWN
                    I still don t see why you won t 
                    drive it.

                                  GUS
                    Because it s embarrassing.

                                  SHAWN
                    Fine.  If you won t enjoy it, I 
                    will.

    He cranks up the thundering bass.  A convertible full of UCSB 
      co-eds in bikinis pulls up beside them.  They giggle and 
      flirt with Shawn.

    Gus tries to get in on the action but is too late.  They pull 
      off.  He then turns to Shawn.

                                  GUS
                    Get out of my seat.

                    It s myride, Shawn.  I m driving.

      They do a Chinese fire drill.  Gus gets behind the wheel and 
      pulls off.

                                  SHAWN
                    Let s head to the station so I can 
                    convince the police to look into 
                    Jonny G. s operations.

    Gus takes a corner.  Suddenly they hear a police sirenbehind 
      them.  Gus checks his mirror.

                                  GUS
                    What now?

    He pulls to the side.  A beat later, Officer McNab walks up 
    to his window.

                                  MCNAB
                    I m gonnaneed to see your license

                    I m reallysorry to bother you 
                    guys.

                                  GUS
                    MmmHmmm.

      They then hear loud barking from outside the car.  They jump 
    and turn around to see McNab s police dog barking at Gus and 
      Shawn.

                                  MCNAB

                    Obviously he s not going to make 
                    it.  

    He grabs the dog by the collar and pulls him back to the car.

      McNab gets into the squad car and pulls off.


      Shawn and Gus approach Lassiter s desk as Juliet removes a 
        state-of-the-art bullet-proof vest from a box.

                                  LASSITER
                    Are those the new nano-material

                    Yep, just in time for 21-LES.

      Juliet pulls out the brochure.

                    The Kev-Tek 7000 is made with nano-
                    material polymers that give it 
                    enough strength to stop a tank 
                    mortar shell.

                    So who s taking a round to the 
                    chest to test it out?

    She and Lassiter exchange a look.  They both eagerly reach 
    for it.

                                  LASSITER
                    No, you got to be incapacitated by 
                    the sonic gun, now it s myturn.

      They both tug at the vest.  Vick comes out of her office.

                                  INTERIM CHIEF VICK
                    I ve had just about enough out of

      Since Shawn has all of their attention, he has a psychic 
      moment.  He starts shaking.

                    Good idea.  That way, it s a plus 
                    for me whether they work or fail.

      Shawn swallows hard and we:


      Shawn and Gus leave the station.  Gus drives.

      Shawn cranks the stereo up, intentionally drowning Gus out 
      with the bass.  Gus turns to him and begins to shout.

      Behind Gus, another car full of babes pulls up and tries to 
    get their attention.  Shawn turns the music down while Gus is 
      mid-rant.

      Desperate, Shawn reaches behind Gus  radio and tugs hard.  He 
      brings his hands up, holding a handful of frayed wires.  The

                    You heard him say Jonny s not

                    No, I heardhim say he didn t know 
                    if he was around or not.

                    Okay maybe that s what he said.  I 
                    really wasn t listening since I d 
                    planned on doing this all along.

                    Just hurry up.

                    Anything that points to criminal 
                    activity.  A white cloth sack with 
                    a big green dollar sign on it, a 
                    red barrel labeled  TNT , an anvil, 
                    anything.

                    You found something?  Because the 
                    purpose of those examples was to 
                    imply that it wouldn t be so 
                    obvious.

    Gus holds a huge custom rim above his head.

                                  GUS
                    Look at how light this is.  I bet 
                    it s so some rapper can wear it 
                    around his neck.

                    Looks like this is another dead

                          (sigh)
                    I m out of ideas, Gus.  And we both 
                    know what usually happens when I m

    He and Gus exchange a knowing look.

      Shawn knocks on the door.  Henry opens it, holding a

                    You finally show up at a good time.

      Before Shawn can speak, he shoves a filet knife into Shawn s 
      hands.

    Gus holds his mouth and crosses off.  Shawn stands besides 
      Henry at the counter and fillets fish in tandem with his 
      father (think  Heart and Soul  on the piano).  Clearly, they 
    did this a lot when he was a kid.

                                  HENRY (CONT'D)
                    What brings you two here?  I m sure 
                    it wasn t to see how great my 
                    fishing trip went.

                    Did you ever have a case you 
                    couldn t crack?

      Henry stops cleaning fish and goes into lesson mode.

                                  HENRY
                    Of course I did, Shawn.  More than 
                    a few.  But a good detective learns 
                    the most when he doesn tget the 
                    bad guy.  That s why I always tried

                    Oh.  Well, sometimes they get off.  
                    But a good detective doesn t let

                    He s still in jail.  In fact, Chief

                                  HENRY
                    Oh.  

      Frustrated, he goes back to cleaning fish.

                                  HENRY (CONT D)
                    So what s your problem?

                    It doesn t feellike my best work.  
                    It was just too easy.  Did you ever 
                    have that problem?

      Henry forcibly chops a fish s head off with a loud whack!

                          (then; calmly)
                    No.  Don t think I did.  Most of my

                      excitement.  Then when you finally 
                    get it, you re not satisfied.  You 
                    think it needs  more. 

                                  SHAWN
                    That s not true.

                                  HENRY
                    Your best case needs more 
                    excitement just like as a kid your 
                    first ten-speed needed more 
                      reflectors.  And your science 
                    team s solar system needed more 
                    planets.  And your first girlfriend

                    Then that must be what Wally s been 
                    covering for all along.  He s just 
                    the fall guy.  Jonny G. runs the 
                    real operation--

                                  SHAWN
                    --Drug trafficking.  And I m 
                    willing to bet that shipment to 
                    Arizona is their next big score.  
                    We need to get back to that shop 
                    before the evidence is all gone.

    Gus pulls off and we:


      Shawn and Gus enter to find the shop empty.


                                  SHAWN
                    Damn!  We re too late.

      They then hear the sound of an engine revvingin the back of 
    the shop.  

                                  GUS
                    Somebody s here.

      They carefully go to investigate.


      They peek their heads around the corner.

                                  SHAWN
                    Jonny G.?  Homie?  Are you in the 
                    house?

    No response.  They walk out to see a car on a lift, hooked up 
    to various gauges.  The engine is open full throttle and all 
    the gauges are red-lined.  Shawn hits a switch to lower the 
      lift.  When the car comes down, they find Jonny G. dead
      behind the wheel!

                SHAWN (CONT'D)GUS
      Ahhh!Ahhh!

      They jump back.  Then check it out.

                                  SHAWN (CONT D)
                    His foot s still on the 
                    accelerator.

      They stand there in shock.  A beat later, they both giggle.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)PSYCH - Episode 2004 "Zero to Murder in Sixty Seconds" - Network Draft  4/24/07 41.

                    You stop.

      They both giggle again.

      Shawn and Gus sit across the glass from Wally.

                                  WALLY
                    I can t believe Jonny G. went out 
                    like that.  

                                  GUS
                    The police suspect foul play, but 
                    so far they have no leads.

                                  WALLY
                    All while I was on lockdown.Guess 
                    I came out with a better sentence 
                    than Jonny G. did. Irony.    

                                  SHAWN 
                    We still have some questions, 
                    though.  What do you know about a 
                    shipment of custom cars to Arizona?

                                  WALLY
                    We were partners, but Jonny G. was 
                    involved in a lot of stuff I didn t 
                    know about.  If I asked questions, 
                    he d be like  Nunya.   And I d be 
                    like  Okay.   Relegated.  

                                  GUS
                    You re saying you weren t involved 
                    with the custom car shop at all?

                                  WALLY
                    I m saying I was just the front man 
                    for the chop shop.  And now I m 
                    doing my time.  But after I get 
                    out, crime s gonnabe like,  Come 
                    out and play, Wally.   And I m

                    Time s up.

      Wally gets up to leave.  As he does, Shawn notices a sly 
      smile creep on his face when.  SHAWN VISION FLASHBACK - it s 
    the smile he had when he was arrested at the warehouse.  He 
      exits.

                                  SHAWN

                                  SHAWN
                    Both.  Wally s the mastermind 
                    behind the smuggling ring andJonny

                    Yeah, he made sure of that.

      They exit.


      Shawn paces while Gus works on the computer.

                                  SHAWN
                    Wally made it easy for us to catch 
                    him because he wantedto get thrown 
                    in jail.  That way he d be locked 
                    up when he murdered Jonny G. 

                                  GUS

                    Wally would assume sole control of

      Shawn exits and we:


      Various police officers mingle under a sign which reads  21st 
      Century Law Enforcement Seminar.   Gus enters and finds Shawn 
      waiting.

                    The dispatch at the trucking 
                    company said they had a fleet from 
                    Blingit On scheduled to be dropped-
                    off at two-thirty.  I wrote the 
                    location down.

    He hands Shawn a sheet of paper.

      They check the bulletin board and see  Room 221:  Modern 
      Detective Techniques -- Det. Lassiter.   They hurry off.


      Shawn and Gus quietly enter a dimly the room.  CLOSE ON 
      Lassiter giving a slide show presentation.  Cool music plays 
      over various pictures of Lassiter and Juliet:

    1) In the field. Lassiter sprays a bio-luminescent substance 
    to identify blood stains at a crime scene.

    2) In the lab.  Lassiter and Juliet in white coats and lab 
      goggles mixing chemicals in test tubes.

    3) In the office.  Lassiter and Juliet stand in front of a 
      huge board with various photos of victims, crime scenes and 
      suspects, all overlaid onto a map with multi-colored lines 
      connecting each one.  It looks like a complicated neural net.

                    As you all can see, the tools in 
                    the arsenal of the modern-day 
                    detective are formidable to say the 
                    least.  Scientific advancements, 
                    from the mapping of the human

                    have taken law enforcement into the 
                    21st century... and beyond.

    He ends with dramatic flair.  He then stops the slide show 
    and brings the lights up.  We PULL BACK to reveal that only 
      seven people are in attendance.  Juliet stands besides 
      Lassiter, clapping.

    in action.  Shawn pulls up a map of the city on the laptop 
    and it shows on the projection screen.

                                  SHAWN
                    I m sensing a location...

    He grabs the mouse and closes his eyes.  His hand psychically 
      guides the cursor to an area on the map.

                                  SHAWN (CONT D)
                    Here.  
                          (opens his eyes)
                    An abandoned airfield?  But why?  
                    Do tell, oh spirits of law 
                      enforcement technology...

    He touches his temples.

                                  SHAWN (CONT D)
                    I m getting... Michael Douglas, 
                    Catherine Zeta-Jones... The always 
                      under-appreciated Don Cheadle. 

                                  STUDENT #1

                          (a la Al Pacino)
                     Say hello to my little friend! 

    He takes Student #2 by the head and rakes his nose across his 
      desk while sniffing.

                                  STUDENT #2

                    Drugs!
                          (pointsto map)
                    There must be a big deal going down 
                    right here!

      Lassiter s unsure.

                                  JULIET
                    We can send a squad car over there 
                    to check it out.

                                  LASSITER
                          (reluctantly)
                    Okay.

                                  SHAWN
                          (hand to head)
                    There s no time.  It s happening in 
                    ten minutes.  We have to leave now!


                                                                            (CONTINUED)PSYCH - Episode 2004 "Zero to Murder in Sixty Seconds" - Network Draft  4/24/07 48.

                    There s no way I can get there that 
                    fast.

    Gus exchanges a look with Shawn.  Gus then pulls out the keys 
    to the tricked-out Echo.

                                  GUS
                    I got this.  Let s roll.

                                  STUDENT #1
                    Can we come?

                                  LASSITER
                    Yeah, wait out front.  We ll pull 
                    around just for you.

                                  STUDENT #2
                    Shotgun! 

      Lassiter shakes his head.  He and Juliet then quickly follow 
    Gus and Shawn out.


      Shawn and Gus approach the spa assistant.

                                  GUS
                    We d like to schedule a couple of 
                    massages with Gloria.

    The assistant checks the computer.

                                  ASSISTANT
                    I m sorry but Gloria is still 
                    booked.  The only slot she has 
                    available is a couple s session.

      Shawn and Gus exchange a knowing look and both turn to the 
      assistant.

                        GUSSHAWN
      No.Yes.

                                  SHAWN
                          (off Gus  reaction)
                    I mean, no.

      They walk off.

                                  GUS
                    What s wrong with you?

                                  SHAWN
                    Dude, you re the one who said how 
                    great she was supposed to be.  I 
                    thought it d be worth it.

                                  GUS

                    gonnahappen.  She sblind, but I m 
                    not.  

    Gus shudders as they walk out and we:
