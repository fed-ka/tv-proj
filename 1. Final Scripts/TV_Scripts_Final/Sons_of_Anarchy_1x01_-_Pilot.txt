        Johnny Cash s cover of RUSTY CAGE plays, as we witness 
        the HISTORY OF THE SONS OF ANARCHY MOTORCYCLE CLUB --


        EXT. CA INTERSTATE 580 - SUPER 8 FOOTAGE - CIRCA 1966

        JOHN TELLER, 25, tall, strong, long hair, climbs on a 
          HARLEY.  Strapped to the bike is a bedroll, backpack, 
        life stuff.  He gives an uncomfortable nod to the camera.  
        FIRES up the bike.  As he rides away we see the back of 
        his sleeveless leather jacket, BLUE letters on a WHITE 
          background -- upper rocker reads: SONS OF ANARCHY, lower 
        rocker reads: REDWOOD.  In the center, the logo:  
          ANARCHIST SKULL, with two M-16 CROSSBONES.  

        CLAY MORROW, 21, PINEY WINSTON, 32, six other BIKERS, 
        same hippy-vibe, same jacket, follow in line.  A few of 
        them, CLEARLY STONED.  The original nine.  They disappear 
        down the highway.  The history begins --


        EXT. REDWOOD PARK, NORTHERN CA - SUPER 8 FOOTAGE - 1975

        John Teller, 34, sits at a picnic table.  A huge BBQ goes 
        on around him.  Music, dancing, Harleys.  Cuddling up 
        next to John is GEMMA, 18, very PREGNANT.  The camera 
        pulls back to reveal over 50 BIKERS.  These guys are not 
          hippies.  They have a harder, outlaw vibe.  They all wear 
        their colors.  The upper rockers read: SONS OF ANARCHY.  
        Now, the lower rockers reveal other charters in addition 
        to Redwood: CHINO, SONOMA, PHOENIX.  A prominent  MC  now 
        sits next to the skull.


        EXT. WOODED AREA, NORTHERN CA - CHP VIDEO - MAY 5, 1981 

          Outside a REMOTE CABIN, an unseen law officer documents 
        the crime scene.  We see dozens of CHPS and SAN JOAQUIN 
        COUNTY SHERIFFS standing over a cache of GUNS, DRUGS, 
        CASH.  Next to the evidence, 11 SONS OF ANARCHY, from 
          different charters, lie face down in the dirt, handcuffed.  
        John Teller, 40, among them.  On the back of John s 
          colors, next to REDWOOD, is a patch that reads: ORIGINAL.  


        INT. TELLER HOUSE - HOME VIDEO - DECEMBER 25TH, 1985

        John, 44, Gemma, 28, JACKSON, 9 and TOMMY, 5, open 
          presents around a tree.  Tommy looks pale, feeble.  John 
        helps him open a package.  Something about John seems 
          different -- older, wiser, gentler.  Jax plays with a 
        Star Wars Toy.  Hans Solo.

        EXT. CA INTERSTATE - CHP VEHICLE VIDEO - NOVEMBER 11, 1991

          Through the windshield of the cruiser we see a jack-
        knifed SEMI on the side of the road.  A long skid mark, 
        black and red, stretches across east and westbound lanes.  
        At the end of it, a mangled HARLEY.  An ambulance slowly 
        pulls away.  


        EXT. CHARMING CEMETERY - HOME VIDEO - NOVEMBER 17, 1991

        The Teller family plot.  We see an ornate mahogany casket 
        raised above a freshly dug grave.  Not yet in the hole.  
        At the grave site next to the hole is a HEADSTONE, 
          adorned with a ceramic ETCHED PHOTO of an eight-year-old 
        Tommy.  It reads: IN LOVING MEMORY OF OUR LITTLE BOY.  
        THOMAS WAYNE TELLER.  BORN APRIL 8th, 1980.  DIED APRIL 
        4th, 1988.  

        The camera WHIPS around to reveal a veiled Gemma, 34, 
          fighting back tears.  At her side, Jax, 15.  They are 
          surrounded by hundreds of MEN wearing SAMC colors.  A 
        huge funeral.  The narrow street is lined with HARLEYS.  

        There are STICKERS on the side of the casket.  One reads: 
        SONS OF ANARCHY MOTORCYCLE CLUB REDWOOD ORIGINAL.  The 
        other reads: LIVE SONS OF ANARCHY, DIE SONS OF ANARCHY.

        Gemma holds John Teller s leather vest, his SAMCRO 
          colors.  She kisses the vest and drapes it over the 
          coffin.  

        The Camera PUSHES TIGHT on John Teller s colors, his 
          PRESIDENT s patch fills the screen.  Then --

        The President s patch MORPHS into a VICE PRESIDENT S 
        PATCH.  The camera pulls out to reveal the patch is on 
        the jacket of --


        EXT. CA INTERSTATE - TODAY

        Jax Teller, 33.  On a Harley.  In formation behind him, 
        five other SAMCRO MEMBERS.  

        They pass a sun-beaten wooden road sign that reads: 
          WELCOME TO CHARMING.  OUR NAME SAYS IT ALL.

        The young buck leads his troops.  They disappear down the 
          highway.  The history continues --

                                                                      SMASH TO BLACK.




                                            2THE MOTORCYCLE CLUB
Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club Redwood Original (SAMCRO)

Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club was founded in 1968 by John Teller and 
Piney Winston.  Ex-Paratroopers who returned from Vietnam feeling 
displaced, unwanted and unappreciated.  Heroes who never got a parade.  
The original charter was simply called "Redwood", because they had no 
home.  Nine men, six of them vets, began their rebellious quest for 
freedom and individuality on the open roads of Northern Cali.

THE WORLD

Charming, California.  Rural, primarily middle-class.  Redwood 
country.  Big Lumber.  Oakland, San Jose fifty miles in either 
direction.  Most members live in a quaint, suburban area they call Sam 
Crow's Corner.  It s idyllic, incestuous and oddly Americana.  

THE COLORS

The uniform of Sam Crow.  A sleeveless leather or denim jacket.  On the 
back, BLUE letters on a WHITE background, the upper rocker reads: SONS 
OF ANARCHY, lower rocker reads: REDWOOD.  In the center, the logo:  An 
angry SKULL, with an anarchist s  A  in the middle of its forehead.  
Two M-16s as its CROSSBONES.  Next to the skull, a prominent MC.  Below 
Redwood, a blue patch that reads: ORIGINAL.  Other patches and pins of 
merit are proudly displayed.  Signifying their renegade status among 
motorcyclists.  Colors are only worn by club members, it's an outlaw's 
identity.  They are sacred.

THE MOTORCYCLES

Harleys.  Dynas and Road Kings.  No imports, choppers or softails.

THE CLUBHOUSE

Homebase for the Sons of Anarchy.  The doors are thick and heavy.  
Bulletproof.  The windows, tinted and barred.  SECURITY CAMERAS watch 
every entrance and exit.  It's half fortress, half adult arcade.  

In the main room, a long redwood CONFERENCE TABLE fills half the 
space.  Leather chairs all around; some labeled: PRESIDENT, VICE 
PRESIDENT, TREASURER, etc.  Against the wall, a fully-stocked BAR.  In 
clear view, a bank of SECURITY MONITORS.  

In the back room, a piano on a small STAGE.  To the left, a full 
KITCHEN, to the right, a one-room APARTMENT.  Upstairs, pool tables, 
pinball machines, X-box and a WEIGHT ROOM.  

On the walls, hundreds of PHOTOS of Sons of Anarchy members.  The 
history of the club.  We also see PAINTINGS and other gifts of ART, 
interpreting the Sons of Anarchy logo and colors.  

One wall is filled with MUGSHOTS of club members.  



                                            3And there are plaques with slogans everywhere: 

- YOU DON'T RIDE, YOU DON'T VOTE.
- NO JUNKIES ALLOWED.
- TREAT ME GOOD, I TREAT YOU BETTER.  TREAT ME BAD, I TREAT YOU WORSE.   
- DON'T LET YOUR OLD LADY FIND OUT ABOUT YOUR MAMA.
- A CHILD IS "BORN" INTO A FAMILY.  A MAN "EARNS" HIS.
- LIVE SONS OF ANARCHY, DIE SONS OF ANARCHY.

      SMASH UP ON:


      EXT. FOREST - NIGHT 1 

      A YOUNG BUCK drinks from a tame brook.  A near-full moon.  
      Lush.  Peaceful.  We soak in the tranquility.  Then -- 

    We hear a huge EXPLOSION.  In the distance, see a FLASH of 
      ORANGE LIGHT.  Fireworks.  The buck BOLTS.  Moments later, 
      debris rains down from above.  Cinder, ash, tin and a POLYMER 
    GUN STOCK.  The stock, still on fire, burns like a broken 
      torch.  We PUSH TIGHT on the RED FLAME as it MORPHS into --  

      A BLUE FLAME.  Hear THE WHITE STRIPES.  PULL BACK to reveal, 
    the flame is a BLOW TORCH and we are inside --


      EXT. TELLER-MORROW AUTOMOTIVE YARD - GARAGE - DAY 2

    The bearer of the torch, JAX TELLER, 33.  Handsome, in a 
      broken cowboy kind of way.  He wears a cut-off gray work 
      shirt,  Jax  on one pocket, TELLER-MORROW on the other.  On 
    his arms, lots of ink and scars.  Goggles on, music blaring 
      from a BOOMBOX, he works the BLOW TORCH on the frame of a 
      MOTORCYCLE.  Shaping the steel.  Bending it to his will.  

    In the bay next to him, TICK WHALEN, 56.  Mechanic.  His arms 
      too, covered in scars and ink.  A CROSS around his neck.


      EXT. TELLER-MORROW AUTOMOTIVE YARD - CONTINUOUS

    The CAMERA DISCOVERS Teller-Morrow, a full service automotive 
      facility.  An OFFICE, four-bay GARAGE.  Mechanical, autobody, 
      custom Harley work.  Lot is nearly full.  Business ain t bad.  

    On the same lot there s a two-story, nondescript, brick 
      building.  The Sons of Anarchy MC, Redwood CLUBHOUSE.  All 
    the property is surrounded by stay-the-fuck-out barbed-wire.

      A TOW TRUCK pulls in with a white LEXUS.  A DEER ASS sticks 
    out of the shattered windshield of the sedan.  The front half 
      lies across the seat.  It s the young buck from the forest. 

    Out of the tow truck hops DUBLIN LOWE, 35, and HALF-SACK 
      EPPS, 23.  Both wear grey mechanic shirts with the T-M logo.  
      Over the work shirt, their SAMCRO colors.  Half-Sack only has 
      a bottom rocker: REDWOOD.  He hasn t earned the rest.

                                          DUBLIN
                      Ask Jax what we should do with Bambi.

      Half-Sack sees Jax is focused on the bike.  Hesitates, then 
      heads over to his open bay.  Jax s back is to him --


                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                          (shouts)
                      Hey, Jax!  Yo, dude.  

      Between the automotive din, the music and the blow torch, Jax 
      can t hear anyone.  Half-Sack looks to Dublin for direction --

                                          DUBLIN
                      What re you, retarded?  Just tap him.

      Tick, Dublin share a look.  Tick shakes his head.  Bad idea.  
      Half-Sack reaches into Jax s bay and TAPS his shoulder.  Jax 
      JUMPS out of his skin.  With his free hand, he instinctively 
      SLAMS Half-Sack against a pillar.  Tick TURNS DOWN the music.

                                        JAX
                      Hell s a matter with you?

      Half-Sack, clearly spooked, tries to stay hard.  Jax sees 
      Dublin LAUGHING, WHIPS a wrench at him.  To Half-Sack --

                                        JAX
                      Don t listen to everything your 
                      sponsor tells you, prospect.  Some 
                      shit ll get you killed.

      Biker philosophy 101 --

                                          DUBLIN
                      And some shit ll save your ass.  
                      Figuring out which is which, that s 
                      the fun part.

    Jax sees the Lexus, can t help but smile at the irony --

                                        JAX
                      Never know.  Some days you re the 
                      Lexus, some days you re the goddamn 
                      deer.  

                                          DUBLIN
                      Yuppie creamed it out by the streams.  

                                        JAX
                      He run into it or hit a tree while it 
                      was giving him head?

                                          HALF-SACK
                      How the hell do I get it out of there?

    Jax shares a smile with Dublin.  Opens a TOOL BIN on the tow 
      truck, pulls out a CHAIN SAW.  Hands it to Half-Sack.

                                          HALF-SACK
                      Oh, Christ...

                      Do the best you can.

      Half-Sack nods, hops into the truck.  Jax and Dublin watch --

                      Don t know if your boy s gonna make it.

                      Got a lot of heart, just a little

      THREE HARLEYS roar into the lot, the riders also have the 
      Teller-Morrow work shirts under SAMCRO colors.

                      We will now.

      CLAY MORROW, 63.  Tall, wiry.  Elaborate CELTIC TATTOOS on 
    his neck and forearms.  Old school.  He MASSAGES his hands as 
    he climbs off the bike.  Wears an expensive ROLEX.  

      With him, BOBBY MUNSON, 45.  Big boy, big smile.  A diamond 
      STAR OF DAVID around his neck.  HAWK SHAW, 40.  No smile.  A 
      thick red scar around his neck.  Hawk stays on the bike, 
      watches the street.  The men exchange hearty embraces --

      INT. WENDY S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 

    We see WENDY CASE, 33, SEVEN MONTHS PREGNANT, pretty, sexy in 
      a fragile way.  She enters from the Living Room carrying a 
      SMALL PURSE.  She looks frazzled.  IGNORES the RINGING PHONE.

    She opens a KITCHEN DRAWER, searches for a spoon.  None.  She 
      moves to the sink.  Full of DIRTY DISHES.  Spoons are gnarly.  
    She has a thought.  Opens the FREEZER, a SPOON sticks out of 
      a quart of H agen-Dazs.  She yanks it out, licks it clean.  

    The CAMERA STAYS on the front of the Amana.  Covered with 
      PHOTOS.  Jax and Wendy.  Wendy with Sam Crow.  There s a  One 
    Day at a Time  sticker in the center of the life collage.  

    The CAMERA MOVES back toward Wendy, we see the kitchen is a 
      MESS.  Empty pizza boxes, half-filled glasses, clutter.  We 
      find Wendy at the STOVE.  She holds the SPOON over a low GAS 
      FLAME.  In it, CRYSTALLINE ROCKS melt in a splash of water.  
      With her other hand, she pulls a clean DISPOSABLE SYRINGE 
      from the small purse.  She DRAWS the cooked mixture into the 
      syringe and drops in a chair at the kitchen table.

    She anxiously searches her hand for a clean place to pop.  
      Then, she places the same hand on her belly.  Hesitates.  
      Before the remorse can well up, she JAMS the needle between 
    her middle and ring finger. 


      EXT. RIDGE ROAD APARTMENTS - DAY

      Jax, Clay, Bobby and Hawk roll up.  Harleys, colors.  Small

      EXT. FOREST ROAD - (OUTSIDE CHARMING) DAY

      Clay and Hawk ride on a desolate road, engulfed in thick 
      trees.  Reach a clearing, sealed off by high barbed-wire.  
      Inside the fencing is a large WAREHOUSE.  Roof blown off, 
      half-burnt to the ground.  YELLOW TAPE.  FIRE CREW finishes 
    up.  Uniformed San Joaquin County SHERIFFS mill about.

      Clay and Hawk dismount.  Walking toward them is SHERIFF VIC 
      TRAMMEL, 40 s.  Black.  Plain clothes, Rasta vibe.  Badass.

      INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

    The men walk through the wet wreckage.  Thousands of bullet 
      SHELLS, crates, work tables, tools, remnants of gun parts -- 
      what s left of a MUNITIONS FACTORY.  Trammel moves some 
        carefully-placed debris, opens a hatch in the floor.  Inside 
      a CRAWL SPACE, filled with hoses and wires -- two young 
      MEXICAN WOMEN, 20 s.  Baked and suffocated.  Very dead.

      EXT. FOREST ROAD - DAY

    As Clay and Hawk pull onto the highway, an old JEEP, top off, 
      passes them.  Police CHERRY on the dash.  Behind the wheel, 
    in uniform, ASSISTANT CHIEF DAVID HALE.  30 s.  Charming PD.  
      Looks like a baseball player.  Notices SAMCRO riding away.


      EXT./INT. STORAGE LOCKER - DAY

    Jax steps through a crowded 8X10 storage unit.  Filled with 
    old baby furniture, boxes, typewriter, memory-charged junk.   
    Jax lights up when he sees a DAISY AIR RIFLE.  Turns boy.  
      Takes the rifle, sticks the end in the muddy gravel outside 
    the space and PUMPS the gun.  Takes aim and FIRES at some 
      BOXES.  Dirt and gravel fly.  Jax laughs.  

    As he makes his way to the baby stuff, he sees the box that 
    he hit with the mud bullet, it s a LARGE CARDBOARD BOX 
      sitting on top of a CHANGING TABLE.  It s labeled: JOHN MISC. 

    Jax opens the box.  Inside -- dirty BINDERS filled with 
      HARLEY REPAIR MANUALS, SPOOLS of SUPER 8 FILM, VHS TAPES and 
      PHOTOS: John in Vietnam, Gemma and John s wedding.  History.  
    As Jax digs through the contents, some of the HARLEY BINDERS 
      fall to the floor.  From inside of one of them, a thick 
      MANILA ENVELOPE slides out.  Labeled: ORIGINAL. 3/15/1991. 

    Jax picks it up.  Breaks the seal and slides out a 
      MANUSCRIPT.  Typewritten.  The title page reads: 

                          THE LIFE AND DEATH OF SAM CROW.  
                    HOW THE SONS OF ANARCHY LOST THEIR WAY.  
                                BY JOHN THOMAS TELLER.

    Jax turns the page, reads the DEDICATION.  He hears his 
      father s voice in his head --

                                          JOHN TELLER (V.O.)
                      For my sons.  Thomas, who is already 
                      at peace.  And Jackson, may he never 
                      know this life of chaos.

    Jax drops into a BABY ROCKING CHAIR, stares at the page.

      Part of town they call Sam Crow s Corner.  Nice, middle-class 
      homes.  Americana.  Gemma walks to the front door.  Sees the 
      overgrown lawn, several days of newspapers and mail stacked 
    on the porch.  Concerned, she RINGS the bell.  No answer. 

      Gemma heads to the backyard.  Passes a WINDOW.  SEES inside --

      Wendy is LYING IN A HEAP on the kitchen floor.  BLOOD pools

      INT. SAMCRO CLUBHOUSE - MAIN ROOM - DAY

      Half-Sack and a HANG-AROUND, 20 s enter.  Half-Sack carries a 
      large CARDBOARD BOX.  Bobby, at the piano, rehearsing, IN THE 
      GHETTO, sees the prospect --

                      Alright, big man.

      Half-Sack looks around for a place to put the box.  Rests it 
    on the floor, next to the stairwell.  

                                          HANG-AROUND

    We see Jax s colors draped over a chair.  This is where he s 
      been living.  The contents of his father s box is spilled 
      onto his bed.  We see PHOTOS of a twenty-one-year-old Jax 
      with a pretty YOUNG WOMAN.  She s on the back of his Harley.  

    Jax sits on the edge of his bed.  Reading the MANUSCRIPT.  A 
    few pages in.  Then, A KNOCK on the door startles him --

    Jax walks away, then decides to LOCK the apartment door.  

    As he passes the wall of MUGSHOTS, he glances up at JOHN

      INT. SAMCRO CLUBHOUSE - MAIN ROOM - DAY

      Jax, Clay, Bobby, Hawk, Dublin, around the table.  Clay takes 
    two cell phones from his pocket.  An iPHONE and a cheap 
      PREPAID.  Tosses both into a CIGAR BOX, passes it around.  
    All phones go in the box.  Dublin takes the box out back.

                      Between you and me, I think they re a 
                      little too curious, those two disappear 
                      into the woods together all the time.

    RED LIGHT.  Idling.  No love between Sam Crow and John Law.

    The front is lined with Harleys.  We see Half-Sack with three 
      HANG-AROUNDS watching the front.  Sentries.  


      INT. SAMCRO CLUBHOUSE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

      Beer and home-cooked food on the bar.  We see Half-Sack s 
      CARDBOARD BOX still on the floor near the stairwell.  

    The eight members of Sons of Anarchy Redwood Original charter 
    sit around the redwood table.  Clay at the head, Jax and Hawk 
    to his left and right.  This is CHURCH.  The weekly meeting 
    of SAMCRO.  Sacred and intense.  

    We meet the two other members of SAMCRO.  PINEY WINSTON, 73.  
      Bearded, old school outlaw.  Zen.  He s attached to a small 
      oxygen tank.  ROSCO ROSKOWSKI, 38.  Thin, geeky, brains.

      Dublin picks up Half-Sack s CARDBOARD BOX.  Heavy.  Puts it 
    on the bar, opens it -- THE DEER HEAD, antlers and all.

      EXT. SAMCRO CLUBHOUSE - FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT  

    We see Half-Sack, half-sad, carrying the deer head to a full 
      DUMPSTER.  ANTLERS stick out.  Jax and Dublin watch --

                      Good thing he s got a lot of heart.

    In front of the clubhouse we now see club members with 
      FRIENDS and CROW EATERS.  Music blares from a car stereo.  
      Booze, joints.  It s a party.  Several members do WHEELIES up 
    and down the block.  LOCALS look on, enjoying the fun. 

      Opie helps Piney hook his oxygen to a makeshift tank holder 
    on his handlebars.  Motherfucker still rides.  

      Clay, Hawk and Bobby exit the clubhouse, join Jax and Dublin.  
      Clay passes around a thick JOINT.

                      You know what I mean.  You shouldn t

      Gemma finds an empty THUMB BAG under the couch --

    She starts wiping down furniture.  Jax watches her obsessive 
      need to sterilize --

    Jax has no argument.  Gemma softens.  Strokes his red face --

                      When you and Dad hooked up, he ever 
                      talk about his vision?  What he wanted

                      Little I read, seems his original idea 
                      for Sons of Anarchy was something 
                      simpler.  Social rebellion.  Living 
                      outside the box.  Called it a Harley 
                      commune.  Real hippy shit.

    Jax shuts the door.  Hangs for a minute.  Then he opens a 
      DESK DRAWER, pulls up a FALSE BOTTOM to reveal a REVOLVER, 
      fresh syringes and THUMB BAGS of METH.  

    Jax slips the revolver in his back waistband, grabs the thumb

      INT. MORROW HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

    In a large master suite, Clay reclines in a king-size bed.  
      Gemma exits the bathroom, buttoning up a pajama top.  Great 
      rack.  On her chest, a long VERTICAL SCAR.  Open heart

      INT. CRACKER BARREL FAMILY RESTAURANT - DAY 3 

      Jax, Clay, Bobby and Hawk walk through the eatery.  CUSTOMERS

      Uneasy handshakes as Sam Crow sits.  Clay takes a WOODEN CASE

                      That was unfortunate.
                          (beat, borderline smug)
                      How s the family doing?

    Jax LUNGES at Darby.  Whistler jumps up, INTERCEPTS Jax, Hawk 
      grabs Whistler SLAMS him against the back of the booth.  
      Before guns come out, Clay, pissed off, calls for order --

                                          CLAY
                      Everybody, contain your shit!  

      Nearby CUSTOMERS evacuate their table.  The Sons of Anarchy 
    and the Nords settle back into their seats.  Decompress. 

      Clay address the neighboring booth --

                                          CLAY
                      Sorry, folks.  Won t happen again. 

    The Customers nervously re-seat themselves.  Darby tries to 
    buy some good will  --

                      The Brotherhood had Opie s back every

                      I know how it works inside, Darby.

      EXT. FOREST - DAY  

    AC David Hale crouches over the BLOODY BODY of a LATINO MAN.  
    Two CHARMING UNIFORM OFFICERS (UNIS) with him.  The dead man 
      wears an empty shoulder HOLSTER and cell phone SHEATH.  Hale, 
      wearing latex gloves, carefully checks the body.

                      took it on the run.

      INT. ST. THOMAS HOSPITAL - WAITING AREA - DAY

      Gemma waits with LUANN DELANEY, 43.  Sexy, well put-together.  
      Tara joins them.  Officious.  Gemma stands, anxious.

                                          TARA
                      Abel s stomach surgery went well, but 
                      it s putting a strain on his system.  
                      Dr. Namid doesn t wanna wait.  Thinks 
                      we should do the heart surgery now.

                                          GEMMA

                        A specialist is on his way from San

                        cardiovascular surgeons in the 
                      country.  Soon as he gets here, we ll 
                      begin the procedure on Abel s heart.

                      that crank whore is gonna make her

      Gemma lets Tara get a few steps ahead, then pulls up the back 
    of her scrubs.  Reveals a TATTOO across her lower back.  A 
      CROW with a HEART in the center of it.

      Tara stops at a door.

                                          TARA
                      If you change your mind, Wendy s in 
                      there.  

      Tara moves down the hall.  Gemma walks the other way.

                      He also owns another, closer to 
                      Oakland, here.  

                                          HAWK
                      We know the cut shops are well 
                      protected.

                      They also wouldn t take a chance 
                      housing the guns there.

                                          CLAY
                      Means they d store them somewhere 
                      else,  til the heat was off.

    Jax throws down a DOCUMENT, with a smile --

                                        JAX
                      Alvarez's other parcel, one closer to 
                      Oaktown -- commercial storage units.

    The men nod, satisfied.  They have a plan --


      INT. SAMCRO CLUBHOUSE - APARTMENT - DAY

    Jax stands before a mirror.  He slides a KNIFE into a sheath, 
      a 9MM into a shoulder holster, a .22 BERETTA into an ankle 
      harness.  As he zips up a KEVLAR VEST, he glances down at his 
      father s MANUSCRIPT on the bed.  Conflicted.  After a long 
      moment, he pulls a denim jacket and his colors over the 
      kevlar.  Slips on gloves, grabs his helmet.  To work. 


      INT. OPIE S HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY

    On a work bench in the open garage, Opie loads a large DUFFLE 
      with detonators, wire, firing caps and sticks of construction 
      grade TNT.  We see his Harley in the driveway.  

    He hears the door into the house OPEN and quickly zips up the 
      bag.  DONNA LERNER, 30, pretty, no ink, joins him --

                                          DONNA
                      What re you doing?

                      Gotta make a run.

                      Nothing.


      EXT. OPIE S HOUSE - INTERCUT

    We see Jax walking up the driveway.  

      Opie grabs the duffle.  As he walks out, Donna grabs the bag.  
      Feels the WEIGHT.  Opie rips it from her hand.

                                          DONNA
                      You promised me you were done with 
                      this!   

                                          OPIE
                      It s got nothing to do with you.

      Donna s fear turns rageful --

                                          DONNA
                      I m the one who gets shit on if you 
                      get caught again.

                                          OPIE
                      That s not gonna happen.

                                          DONNA
                      You sat in a cell for five years while 
                      Clay and the others got rich.  They 
                      sold you out.  You know that.  You re 
                      just too weak to stand up to them!

      Opie SLAMS her up against the wall.  Donna SLAPS him.  They 
      hear CRYING.  Opie s girls, SASHA, 9 and ELLIE, 6, are in the 
      doorway.  Traumatized.  Balling.

                                          OPIE
                      Shit.

      Donna runs inside, grabs the kids.  SLAMS the door.  Opie 
      PUNCHES his fist through the drywall.  

      Opie turns sees Jax standing in the driveway.  Watching.  
      Opie decompresses.  Picks up the duffle.  Joins him --

      EXT. LOCAL STREETS - DAY

      Jax, on his Harley, the duffle strapped down to the back of 
    his bike, takes in his small town.  A pack of high school 
      GIRLS see him.  Watch in awe.  Jax smiles.  

    As he turns a corner, he s joined by Clay and Hawk on their 
      Harleys.  Clay sidles up next to him at a RED LIGHT --

                                          CLAY
                      Where s Op?

                      Got the kit.  I can make it work.  
                      It s all good.

      Clay stares at Jax.  Gauging the truth.  GREEN LIGHT.  The 
    men roar off.  

      A few blocks later, Dublin pulls out of a side street, joins 
    the formation.  

    As they pass a residential area, Rosco fills out the field.  

      Locals have no choice but to take notice of Sam Crow as the 
    pop of the Harleys bitch-slap their central nervous systems.


      EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

    The MC heads out of town.  Clay in front.  Jax behind him, 
      flanking his right.  Hawk behind Jax, flanking his left.  
      Dublin and Rosco bring up the rear.  There s dignity in the 
      formation.  Leather-clad warriors.

      Sons of Anarchy MC, Redwood Original, on a mission.  Revenge.

      INT. CASINO (LAKE TAHOE) - LOUNGE - NIGHT 3

      Bobby and Half-Sack enter a near-empty performance lounge.  
    On stage, an ASIAN ELVIS IMPERSONATOR finishes a sound check.  
      Bobby, agitated, approaches SIMON, 60 s, the manager.

                                          BOBBY
                      Simon, who the hell s that?

                      I m booked, tonight and tomorrow.  
                      Five shows.

      Simon reaches behind the bar and grabs a booking JOURNAL.  

                                          SIMON
                      Oh, shit.  Got a new girl in booking.  
                      Bitch doubled up my Elvises.  Sorry.

                      Goddamn it, Simon.  

      Asian Elvis walks toward them.  Catches the conversation.

                                          HALF-SACK
                      Tell Chun King to take a hike.

                                          SIMON
                      Got six busloads of Korean tourists 
                      coming in.  They love Asian Elvis.  
                      I ll get you next month, Bobby. 

      Asian Elvis walks past, gives Bobby a pat on the back --

                                          ASIAN ELVIS
                      Better luck next time, killer.

    Off Half-Sack, is this guy fucking kidding me --


      INT. ST. THOMAS HOSPITAL - PEDIATRIC SURGICAL ROOM - DAY

      A team of NURSES prep Abel for surgery.  Hooked up to hoses 
    and wires, they wipe him down with antibacterials.  He s got 
      a row of sutures across his tiny belly.


      EXT. INDUSTRIAL ROAD (OUTSIDE OAKLAND) - NIGHT 

    An old beater VAN cruises a quiet stretch of industrial road.  
    The only thing in sight is a COMMERCIAL STORAGE FACILITY.  
      Three long buildings, each with four large storage units.  

                                            51  Sons of Anarchy - "Pilot" - Network Ninth Draft - 10/31/0747



      EXT. COMMERCIAL STORAGE FACILITY - CONTINUOUS

      Jax, Clay, Hawk, Dublin and Rosco slip out of the van.  
      Everyone in dark clothes.  No colors.  Hustle over to the 
      storage units.  No guard, but the yard is brightly lit, 
      protected by SECURITY CAMERAS and surrounded by barbed-wire.  

      Jax, with BOLTCUTTERS, Hawk with an AXE, head to a power SUB-
      STATION.  Jax CUTS the padlock on the gate.  Hawk CLEAVES a 
      thick cable in two.  Lights, cameras, alarms BLACKOUT.  Hawk 
      flashes a rare SMILE as they head back.  Clay and the others 
      have CUT THROUGH the fence and are inside --


      EXT. COMMERCIAL STORAGE FACILITY - YARD - CONTINUOUS

      Clay signals them into action.  They pair up and stealthily 
      move to the buildings.  CUTTING the padlocks that secure the 
      large roll-up doors.  The men search the units.  


      INT. CASINO - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

      Asian Elvis sits in front of a vanity, applying his porkchop 
      sideburns.  A KNOCK.  He stays in character --

                                          ASIAN ELVIS
                      Who is it?

                                          VOICE (O.S.)
                      The Colonel.

      Elvis, curious, opens the door -- Half-Sack.  Before he can 
      ask, the prospect answers.  Brutal RIGHT CROSS.  Asian Elvis 
      goes down.  Half-Sack locks the door.  Elvis, sans sneer --

                                          ASIAN ELVIS
                      What d hell s the matter with you?

                                          HALF-SACK
                      I m all shook up. 

      Half-Sack BEATS the living Presley out of the Asian.


      INT. COMMERCIAL STORAGE UNIT - NIGHT

      Clay and Jax enter to find the others standing over FOUR 
      CRATES of Mexican RELIGIOUS CANDLES -- Bleeding Heart of 
      Jesus.  Under the top row of the ornate glass candles, are a 
      dozen brand new MP-5's.  Clay smiles --

                                          CLAY
                      Praise Jesus.  It s a miracle.  
                          (to Jax)
                      Wire it up.

      Dublin and Hawk carry out the crates.  Jax unzips the duffle.

      INT. ST. THOMAS HOSPITAL - PEDIATRIC SURGICAL ROOM - NIGHT

    We see a TEAM of SURGEONS operating on Abel.  Tara and the 
      surgical nurses attend.  Abel s heart is the size of a golf 
      ball.  They desperately try to heal this tiny human.


      EXT. COMMERCIAL STORAGE FACILITY - YARD - NIGHT

    Jax has several six-packs of construction-grade TNT laid out.  
      Slow going.  Unsure what wires to attach to the firing caps.  
      Pulls out a PREPAY CELL.  Tries to dial out -- NO RECEPTION.  

                                        JAX
                      Shit.

      Clay anxiously checks his watch.  Walks over to Jax --

                                          CLAY
                      You said you could make this work.

                                        JAX
                      Just double-checking.  Almost got it.

      Hawk, standing watch, spots HEADLIGHTS approaching --

                                          HAWK
                      We got company.

                      Goddamn it.

    Jax scoops up the TNT.  They rush back into the storage unit.


      INT. COMMERCIAL STORAGE UNIT - CONTINUOUS

      Clay pulls the door shut.  The men arm up.  To the others --

                                          CLAY
                      Wait here.

    Jax and Clay slip out a back door.


      EXT. COMMERCIAL STORAGE FACILITY - YARD - CONTINUOUS

      A MAN wearing a gray HOODIE, call him THE SENTRY, opens the 
      front gate, letting a PICKUP TRUCK pull inside.  The Sentry 
      checks out an ELECTRICAL PANEL as four other MEN hop out of 
    the truck.  No urgency.  Three of them wear SNAKESKIN boots 
    and colors -- MAYANS MC, OAKLAND.  The fourth man wears a 
      knit cap and a denim shirt, call him DENIM SHIRT GUY.

    Jax and Clay watch from the shadows.  DID NOT SEE The Sentry.

                      We should ve been long gone by now.

                      Came here to send a message.  

      Beat.  Jax takes in Clay s ominous meaning --

                      Blowing shit up s one thing.  We off

                      runs out of control.  Bodies ll drop 
                      on both sides.

                      You have a problem with that?

    Jax knows this is a test.  Leadership, loyalty.  Then --

                      I ll draw  em to the middle.  

      Clay heads inside.  Jax takes off his boots, wraps himself in 
      a CARGO BLANKET, grabs a bag of garbage from a trash can.  He 
      walks into the yard.  MUMBLING.  Before the Mayans can 
      investigate the units, they see Jax, the crazy homeless guy.

                                          MAYAN 1
                      Look at this shit.

      Mayan 1 and 2 head over to Jax, as Denim Shirt Guy and Mayan 
      3 join The Sentry at the electrical panel.  

                                          MAYAN 1
                      Hey, cabron.  This is private 
                      property.  

      Jax, mumbles LOUDER as he crosses to the center of the yard.  
    He pulls out his dick, starts PEEING, oblivious to the men.

                                          MAYAN 2
                      Probably took a shit on the 
                        transformer, knocked out the power.

      Mayan 1 spins Jax around.  Jax cowers, playing the role --

                                          MAYAN 1
                      This look like some kinda Holiday Inn 
                      to you, man?  Huh?

    The two Mayans don t see Sam Crow moving up behind them.  

                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                      camp out here, they get some of this --

    He SMASHES Jax in the face.  Splits his eyebrow.  Before he 
      gets a second punch, Jax pulls out his 9MM and PISTOL WHIPS 
      Mayan 2 across the face.  Mayan 1 reaches for his weapon, but 
      Clay and the others are on them, GUNS out.  Jax disarms Mayan 
    2, Clay rips the gun from Mayan 1 s hand --

                      Tell yourdirtbag buddies, they steal 
                      from Sam Crow, they get some of this --

      Clay SHOOTS Mayan 1 in the throat.  Point blank.  Instant 
      death.  Mayan 2 watches the execution.  Fear and loathing.

    The Sentry is out of sight, but Mayan 3 and Denim Shirt Guy 
      hear the attack.  They run over and open FIRE.  Sam Crow 
      takes cover.  Returns FIRE.  Denim Shirt Guy takes a BULLET 
    in the head.  Dead.  Mayan 3, outnumbered, RUNS to the truck.  

                                          HAWK
                      Got  em.

      Hawk bolts.  Mayan 3 hops in the pickup.  As it pulls away, 
      Hawk jumps in the bed, FIRES four shots through the back 
      window.  The Mayan slumps at the wheel, the vehicle swerves 
      wildly.  Hawk DIVES OUT, as the truck CRASHES into a wall.    

      Clay stares at Mayan 2.  Deep hatred between these MCs.

                                          MAYAN 2
                      Conky bitches ain t shit.  Sons gonna 
                      be wiped off the MC map.

                          (to Jax)
                      He s all yours.

      Jax, 9MM out, shoves the Latino toward the open storage unit.  
      Clay watches Jax.  After a moment, he follows his stepson.  

    Sam Crow is still unaware that The Sentry is on the property.  
    We see the hooded man hide behind one of the units.  Armed.


      INT. ST. THOMAS HOSPITAL - PEDIATRIC SURGICAL ROOM - NIGHT

      Mid-surgery.  Abel CRASHES.  His heart seizes.  Flatlines. 
      Nurses rush over with pediatric DEFIBRILLATORS.  Place the 
      tiny paddles on his open heart.  ZAP.  Nothing.  ZAP again --


      INT. COMMERCIAL STORAGE UNIT - NIGHT

    Jax pushes the Mayan to his knees.  Raises his 9MM to the 
      man s head.  Terrified, the Latino looks Jax in the eyes --

                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                      Please.  

    Jax hesitates.  UNABLE to pull the trigger.  Suddenly, a SHOT 
      rings out, Jax catches a bullet in the BACK.  STARTLED, Jax 
      HOWLS, then rips TWO SHOTS at the source -- The Sentry, in a 
      back doorway.  The Sentry takes both bullets in the belly.  

    In an instant, Mayan 2 pulls a BLADE from his boot, LUNGES at 
      Jax s throat.  Before the blade cuts, a SHOT blows the back of 
      Mayan 2 s head off.  Clay in the big doorway.  Smoking gun.

    Jax is SPRAYED in blood.  Clay studies his stepson.  Jax 
      realizes that Clay saw his hesitation.  

    The Sentry, not yet dead, struggles as he crawls to his gun.  

                                          CLAY
                      Finish it.

    Jax raises his gun, points it at the back of The Sentry s 
      head.  Slowly squeezes the trigger.  Before he fires, The 
      Sentry collapses.  Dead.  Jax lowers his gun --

                                        JAX
                      It s finished.

      Father-son intensity is interrupted by the others rushing in -- 

                                          DUBLIN
                      Shit.  You okay?

    Jax nods as he adjusts his KEVLAR vest.  Clay barks to Hawk -- 

                                          CLAY
                      Check his phone.

                      Don t have time to blow it all up.  
                      Load the bodies into the truck.  

      Hawk looks for the phone, turns over The Sentry -- 

                                          HAWK
                      Shit.  Clay.  

      Hawk rips off the hoodie.  They see -- it s WHISTLER.

      Dublin runs to Denim Shirt Guy.  Rosco checks the others.

    The fire SPREADS.  The PICKUP is parked inside the unit.  
      Flames lick the sides of the truck.  In the bed, three DEAD 
      MAYANS, two dead NORDS.  

      Whistler, his pants down to his ankles, has a six-pack of TNT 
      STUFFED IN HIS ASS -- fuse side out.

    The beater van heads down the quiet road.  The ORANGE GLOW of

      Gemma is there with Luann, the Sons of Anarchy MC and their

                      The surgeons repaired the damage to

                      If he gets through it, he s got a

                      Yes, thank you, god.  
                          (beat)
                      Maybe we should say a little prayer.  

      Wendy s taken aback, but under the circumstances --

                      Okay.  That d be good.

      Gemma places her hand on the Bible.  Shuts her eyes.  Wendy 
      does the same --

                                          GEMMA
                      Dear god, thank you for saving this 
                      boy from his murderous junkie mom, who 
                      cared more about a forty dollar rush 
                      than she did her own flesh and blood --

                      Don t you dare --

      Gemma rips the Bible from her --

                      Don t Idare?  You pathetic whore.

                      Guess the DA was impressed by your 
                      Bible studies.  Hear they re not gonna 
                      press charges.

                      throw money at those 12-step freaks.

      Gemma crosses into the BATHROOM.  Her back to Wendy and the 
      camera, she fishes something from her bag as she continues --

                                          GEMMA
                      How long s it gonna last this time?  
                      Six months, three?  Couple weeks?

                                          WENDY
                      It ll be different now.  I have my 
                      baby to live for.

      Gemma checks herself in the mirror, joins Wendy, with Bible.

                                          GEMMA
                      That s where you re wrong.

      Gemma reaches out and GRABS Wendy by the throat.  Death grip --

                                          GEMMA
                      You have no baby.  You lost that 
                      privilege.

                      You so much as cast a shadow on this 
                      kid.  Try to turn some legal screw and 
                      get custody, I will finish this job.

    She lets go of her throat.  Places the Bible on her chest.  

                                          GEMMA
                      I suggest you turn to Jesus.  

      Wendy recovers as Gemma exits. 

      Wendy sees that something is propped inside the Bible.  Opens 
    it to reveal a FULL SYRINGE tucked in the BOOK OF JOHN.  
      Wendy stares at it.  Begins to CRY.  Then WHIPS the Bible 
      across the room.  NOT the syringe.  


      INT. ST. THOMAS HOSPITAL - PICU - NIGHT

    Jax rushes into the PICU.  Tara greets him.  

                                        JAX
                      He s gonna be okay?

                                          TARA
                          (smiles)
                      It looks good.

    Jax EMBRACES Tara.  Starts out as emotional relief, turns 
      into something intimate.  Familiar.  Almost sensual.  They 
      hold the embrace for a long moment.  Tara breaks out of it --

                                          TARA
                      Abel s a fighter.
                          (re: his EYE CUT)
                      Like his dad.

                                        JAX
                      I m fine.  Where is he?

                                          TARA
                      Recovery Two.  End of the hall.

    She hands him some surgical scrubs --

                                          TARA
                      Put these on.

    Jax unzips his colors.  Tara sees the Mayan BLOOD splattered 
    all over his shirt.  They share an uncomfortable look.  

                                          TARA
                      Clean yourself up, Jax. 

    Jax weighs her meaning.  Takes the scrubs.  Tara walks away.

      David burns the midnight oil.  On his desk, crime scene 
      PHOTOS of Rodrigo and an EVIDENCE BAG.

    In the bag, a REVOLVER and a MUDDY CELL PHONE.  David pulls 
    out the phone, scrolls CONTACTS.  One reads: SAM.  He dials.


      INT. ST. THOMAS HOSPITAL - WAITING AREA - NIGHT

      Clay walks past the Chapel on his way to the ICU.  His pocket 
      BUZZES.  Takes out his iPhone, no call.  Removes his PREPAID, 
      incoming call, the ID reads: ROD.  Thinks about answering.  
      Hits IGNORE.  


      INT. CASINO - LOUNGE - NIGHT

    The lounge is full of Asian TOURISTS.  Bobby on stage, black 
      velvet tuxedo, porkchop sideburns, thick Elvis.  It works.  
    The crowd APPLAUDS as he finishes a song.

                                          BOBBY
                      Thank you.  Thank you, very much.

                      You know, sometimes we re quick to 
                      judge strangers.  Just because they 
                      look a little different.  Dress a bit 
                      odd.  But the good book tells us, 
                      before you criticize a man, you should 
                      always walk a mile in his shoes.

      MUSIC MONTAGE


      INT. ST. THOMAS HOSPITAL - BATHROOM - NIGHT

    Jax is SCRUBBING his hands.  Studies himself in the mirror.  
      Sees something unfamiliar.


      INT. COMMERCIAL STORAGE UNIT - NIGHT

      A FIRE rages.  The roof has been blown off.  See the CHARRED 
      BODIES of Mayans and Nords cooking in the back of the truck.  


      INT. OPIE S HOUSE - KID S BEDROOM - NIGHT 

      Opie reads to a sleepy Sasha.  Donna, in the doorway, gives 
    him a relieved smile.  His family fixed, for now. 


      INT. ST. THOMAS HOSPITAL - PEDIATRICS - NURSERY - NIGHT

      Tara looks through the window at the NEWBORNS.  A longing.

      INT. LOWELL S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

      Lowell, dressed, cleaned up, rocks anxiously on the couch.  
    TV on, he just stares at his kid, sleeping at the other end. 


      EXT. SAMCRO CLUBHOUSE - FRONT - NIGHT

    We see HANDS grab ANTLERS and pull the DEER HEAD out of the 
      dumpster.  Young buck, rescued.


      INT. ST. THOMAS HOSPITAL - PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT

      Wendy s hand drops limp, the EMPTY syringe hits the floor.  
    Her monitor FLATLINES.  ALARMS signal.


      INT. CASINO - LOUNGE - NIGHT

      Bobby sings.  Audience captivated.  Half-Sack nurses a drink.


      INT. SAMCRO CLUBHOUSE - APARTMENT - NIGHT

    We see the MANUSCRIPT and PHOTOS of Jax s father on his bed.  
      Ghost of John Teller.  Undeniable.


      INT. ST. THOMAS HOSPITAL - PICU RECOVERY ROOM - NIGHT

    Jax enters the post-surgical room.  Abel is inside the 
      INCUBATION UNIT, hooked up to monitors and tubes.  Jax is 
      awed by the sight of him.  Tiny, fragile.  He places his 
      gloved hand on the unit.  As close to a touch as possible.  

    For the first and last time, we see Jackson Teller shed 
      TEARS.  The emotionality catches him off-guard.  He checks 
      himself, containing the overwhelm, just as --

      A HAND caresses his shoulder.  Gemma, in sterile gear, behind 
    him --

                                          GEMMA
                      He s perfect.

      Jackson stares at his perfect child.  A son of anarchy.

    The camera SLOWLY PANS to reveal, through the WINDOW behind 
      them, Clay and Tara, watching three generations of Tellers.  
      Neither one knowing the path that the family will take.

      Above Tara s head, barely in frame, is a red EXIT SIGN.

                                                                  SMASH TO BLACK.
                                            THE END
