      Light from the morning sun warms the pristine waters of 
      Sausalito s exclusive harbor, Pelican Cove.  Slips here are 
      filled with million dollar yachts; status symbols of the Bay 
      Area s rich and powerful.  A small gathering of LOCAL POLICE 
      have cordoned off a section of DOCK, isolating one of the 
      larger yachts.

      JANE and LISBON arrive and meet up with VAN PELT and a 
      noticeably peaked RIGSBY; congestion, coughing, etc.

                                  LISBON
                    What have we got?

                                  VAN PELT
                    Jim Gulbrand.  CEO and founder of 
                    the software company Gaia Matrix 
                    was reported missing by his live in 
                    brother yesterday.  Local police 
                    responded to the call, but didn t 
                    check out his boat until this 
                    morning.  They found blood on the 
                    deck, but no sign of a body.

                                  LISBON
                    Why did they call us in?

                                  VAN PELT
                    The marina is privately owned, on 
                    lease from the city of Sausalito.  
                    It was local PD s choice whether to 
                    take the case.

                                  LISBON
                          (droll)
                      High-profile missing person s case?  
                    Can t imagine why they gave it up.

      Jane, Lisbon and Van Pelt climb on board the yacht.  Rigsby 
      thinks about following, but has second thoughts.

                                  LISBON (CONT D)
                    You coming?

                                  VAN PELT
                    He s not feeling well.
                          (mouths the word)
                    Stomach.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)            THE MENTALIST      "Miss Red"      GOLD 4/08/09      2.

                                  RIGSBY
                    I m fine.

      Clearly, he is not.  Lisbon steps back.

                                  LISBON
                    Get me sick and you re working 
                      stake-outs the rest of the month.  

      Rigsby covers his mouth with his hand.

                                  RIGSBY
                          (muffled)
                    Yes, boss.

      Lisbon, Jane and Van Pelt survey the crime scene; what little 
      there is of one.  Lisbon crouches over a large blood stain.

                                  LISBON
                    This is it?

                                  VAN PELT
                    Uh-huh.

                                  LISBON
                    Nothing else.  No weapon?  No sign 
                    of a struggle?

                                  VAN PELT
                    Nothing.  

      Jane climbs back onto the dock, careful to avoid Rigsby, who 
      is busy coughing up something awful.  Jane walks along the 
      dock to the side of the yacht.  From his POV, he sees the 
      gangway door, noting that it s open.

      ANGLE:  Back with Lisbon and Van Pelt.  Lisbon, independent 
      of Jane, also heads toward the side of the yacht, mirroring 
      his movement.  Van Pelt follows with her note pad.

                                  LISBON
                    What else do we know about the 
                    victim?

                                  VAN PELT
                    Jim Gulbrand is thirty-three years 
                    old, lives here in Sausalito, and 
                    has an estimated net worth of... 
                    whoa.  A hundred million dollars.

                                  LISBON
                    Rich.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)            THE MENTALIST      "Miss Red"      GOLD 4/08/09      3.
      CONTINUED: (2)11

                                  VAN PELT
                    Very rich.  He was also recently 
                    divorced from one Kathryn Stubbs-
                    Gulbrand.

      Just as Jane did, Lisbon now notices the unlatched open 
      gangway door on the side of the boat.

      ANGLE:  Jane walks back along the dock toward the front of 
      the yacht.  Rigsby stands and makes a move to follow.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Do you need any...

      He feels the effects of the flu and sits back down.

                                  RIGSBY (CONT D)
                      Nevermind.

      Jane peers around the front of the yacht s massive hull and 
      looks at the ANCHOR CHAIN hanging taut, and notes the 
      NUMEROUS LITTLE FISH that swarm around it. 

      ANGLE:  Lisbon, again independent of Jane, mirrors his 
      movement toward the front of the yacht.

                                  LISBON
                    Did the victim have a criminal 
                    record?

                                  VAN PELT
                    No, but the company he founded, 
                    Gaia Matrix, is being investigated 
                    by the SEC on securities 
                      violations.  He was facing heavy 
                    fines and possible prison time.

      Lisbon sees the same chain hanging from the yacht s 
      hawsehole.  The same milling fish.  Then she sees Jane 
      standing on the dock, also inspecting the chain.  The two 
      share a look and realize their searches are perfectly in sync 
      with one another s -- Lisbon from the deck of the yacht, and 
      Jane from the dock.

      Van Pelt and Lisbon walk back toward the wheelhouse.  Van 
      Pelt has a realization.

                                  VAN PELT (CONT D)
                      Millionaire victim looking at time 
                    in a Federal Prison, disappears.  
                    Maybe this is all an elaborate 
                    hoax.  It would explain why there s 
                    no body.

                    You take a boat out and go missing, 
                    everyone will assume you re at the 
                    bottom of the ocean.  Your body and 
                    your killer are never found.

      Jane is now back on board in the wheelhouse.

                                  JANE
                    That would explain it perfectly.  

      Lisbon is in the yacht s wheelhouse playing around with the 
      various instruments at the control panel.  Jane joins her.  
      Both begin flipping switches, etc.

                                  LISBON
                    I think it s one of -- Nope.

                                  JANE
                    Mmm.  Maybe one of, uh...

                                  LISBON
                    Oh, didn t try that one.

      Jane pulls a lever and the FOGHORN BLASTS.  Rigsby grabs his 
      head in pain.  Jane pokes his head out from behind the wheel.

                                  JANE
                    Sorry.

                                  VAN PELT
                    What are you doing?

                                  JANE
                    There s no need to drop anchor when 
                    you re tied up at a dockside.   

                                  LISBON
                    And all those fish are there for a 
                    reason.  

      Jane and Lisbon both find a switch marked  ANCHOR WINCH. 

                                    LISBON/JANE
                    Ahhh...

                                  JANE
                    Please.  After you.

      Lisbon flips the switch ACTIVATING THE WINCH.  Jane, Lisbon 
      and Van Pelt all move to the front of the yacht.  Local 
      Police and Rigsby watch from the dock as the massive anchor 
      rises above the waterline.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)            THE MENTALIST      "Miss Red"      GOLD 4/08/09      5.

      Chained to it, dead as a mackerel, is the body of Jim 
      Gulbrand, somewhat gnawed upon by the fish.

      If Rigsby wasn t sick before, he is now...

                                        ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      A huge, sprawling, obnoxious mansion.  More space than one 
      man should be allowed to possess.


      Silicon Valley, granola-Berkeley-chic.  Pine trees, bark-
      lined hiking trails.  A rock garden in the courtyard.


      CU: A cigar is lit, glowing red.

      REVEAL:  A man smokes as he waits for his car at a VALET 
      STAND outside an elegant country mansion where the super rich 
      go to mingle with their own kind.  A top class wine cellar, a 
      luxury restaurant, and a cigar bar (where as we shall see, 
      clients can keep their cigars in secure climate controlled 
      humidors).  Jane and Cho enter.


      Rigsby and Van Pelt are in a parked car.  A few rows ahead of 
      them, also sitting in a parked car, is Kathryn Stubbs.

                                  VAN PELT
                    I don t get it.  What s she doing?

                                  RIGSBY
                    Maybe she likes the water.

      He reaches in back and pulls out a sandwich, takes a bite.

                                  VAN PELT 
                    Feeling better?

      Rigsby finishes his mouthful before speaking. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Much.  It s weird.  I know Brooke 
                    Harper isn t a real doctor, but 
                    whatever she gave me really worked.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Good.  I was worried about you.

      Van Pelt s gazing out the window away from him.  Is that a 
      shy indication that she s reaching out to him, or is she just 
      being blandly polite? 

                                  RIGSBY
                    I um, I ve been thinking --

      A blue PORSCHE pulls into the parking lot and parks next to 
      Kathryn s car.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Can you see who it is?

                    No.

      The owner of the Porsche climbs out.  It s Rick Bregman.

                    partner.

      Bregman climbs into the passenger seat of Kathryn s car.  
      Within seconds, they re locked in a passionate embrace.

                    And lover of the ex-wife...


      Van Pelt questions Kathryn Stubbs-Gulbrand.

                                  VAN PELT
                    What were you doing out here?

                                    KATHRYN
                    Duh, looking for the money.  Rick 
                    figured maybe there were secret 
                      compartments in the boat somewhere.

                                  VAN PELT 
                    How long have you been seeing Rick 
                    Bregman romantically?

                                    KATHRYN
                    About a year.

                                  VAN PELT
                    You were divorced from Jim Gulbrand 
                    about a year ago.  Were you 
                    involved with Rick while you were 
                    still married to Jim?

                                    KATHRYN
                    Involved?  

                                  VAN PELT
                    Were you having sexual intercourse 
                    with him?

                                    KATHRYN 
                    No.  Rick wouldn t do that to Jim.

                                  VAN PELT
                    But you would.

                    So you misled us in order to 
                    protect your money?

                    I misled you to help protect the 
                    company Jim and I built from the 
                    ground up.

                    Were you aware Jim Gulbrand was 
                      cooperating with SEC investigators?

                                  RICK BREGMAN
                    Jim would never go behind my back.

                    He would and he did.  The only 
                    question is if you found out, what 
                    would you do to stop him?

      Jane and Lisbon are with Stuart Hanson.

                                  STUART
                    Ten million dollars?  That s a lot 
                    of money.

                                  JANE
                    Jim trusted you with the security 
                    of his company.  He valued your 
                      outside-the-box thinking.  You 
                    advised him where to put the money, 
                    didn t you?

      Stuart balks.

                                  LISBON
                    Stuart, we don t care if hiding 
                    this money was in any way unethical 
                    or illegal.  Our focus is on the 
                    homicide investigation.

                                  STUART
                    It s not that.  It s... I 
                      absolutely promised Jim I wouldn t 
                    say anything.





















                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST      "Miss Red"      GOLD 4/08/09      40.

                                  LISBON
                    We ve learned that his girlfriend, 
                    Brooke Harper, is a con woman.  We 
                    believe she was after the money and 
                    may have killed Jim to get it.

      Jane pulls out the locker-sized key he took from Brooke.

                                  JANE
                    We found her with this key.  She 
                    was trying to open Gulbrand s 
                    cabinet at the Backgammon Club.  
                    The key didn t work.  Evidently she 
                    took this from Jim, but doesn t 
                    know where the money is.

      Stuart is fascinated.

                                  STUART
                    No kidding.  Wow.  That s some lady.

                                  LISBON
                    If you can help us find the money, 
                    we can prove Brooke was looking for 
                    it, and establish a motive for the 
                    murder.

      Jane tosses the key in the air and catches it, like a coin.

                                  JANE
                    So, Stuart?  Do you know where the 
                    money is?

                                  STUART
                    No.  Well, not the exact location, 
                    anyway.  Jim came to me for some 
                       outside-the-box  security advice, 
                    like you said.  He wanted to hide 
                    the money from his ex-wife.  I told 
                    him safety deposit boxes and 
                    offshore accounts can be traced 
                    rather easily, so they wouldn t be 
                    of any use.

                                  JANE
                    Where did you tell him to hide the 
                    money?

                                  STUART

                                  STUART
                    No.  Anything on his property could 
                    be subject to search.  It had to be 
                    secure, obviously, hence the key.  
                    But more importantly, it had to be 
                    in a place no one would think to 
                    look.

                                  JANE
                    Hidden in plain sight.

                                  STUART
                    Yes.  But that was the extent of my 
                      involvement.  I have no idea where 
                    he actually hid the money.

                                  JANE
                    I see.

      Jane tosses the key into the air again, but this time 
        accidentally drops it on the ground where it bounces under a 
      table.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Oops.

      Jane kneels down, but can t reach the key.  He has to lie 
      flat on his stomach right beside Stuart in order to reach 
      beneath the table.  Once the key is in hand, he climbs up.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Don t want to lose that now, do we?

      ON the key...

                    What do you make of it?  You think

                    doesn t know exactly.  And the

                      approaching the station now.  Cho, 
                    do you have a visual?


      Cho peers out over his newspaper at a minivan pulling to a 
      stop in a loading zone.

                                  CHO
                      Affirmative.  She s exiting the 
                    vehicle now.

      Cho watches as Brooke climbs out of her car, heads around to 
      the passenger side, and pulls open the sliding door.  A 
      figure is sitting inside.

      Cho watches as Brooke lowers a ramp and climbs inside the 
      van.  Seconds later she emerges... with STUART HANSON.

                    She has Stuart Hanson with her.


      Brooke closes the door behind her and pushes Stuart in his 
      wheelchair toward the front entrance of the train station.  
      She s holding a gun to Stuart s back.

      Stuart climbs on board the yacht, using the rear gate.

                    You went to the yacht that night 
                    because you knew he d be alone.

      Stuart quietly sneaks up behind Gulbrand, picks up a small 
      fire extinguisher from the wheelhouse, and slams it into the 
      back of Gulbrand s head, knocking him unconscious.  Gulbrand 
      slumps over; a small trickle of blood drips onto the deck.

                                  JANE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    You also knew he kept the key with 
                    him. 

      Stuart takes the key from around Gulbrand s neck.

                    You killed Gulbrand and got rid of 
                    the body.

      Stuart pushes the body over the side.  Noticeably absent, is 
      the sound of the SPLASH the body would make hitting the 
      water.  Stuart peers over the bow of the boat and sees the 
      unconscious body of Jim Gulbrand hanging from the anchor -- 
      caught by his belt.

      Jane drops the key under the table and climbs down to pick it
