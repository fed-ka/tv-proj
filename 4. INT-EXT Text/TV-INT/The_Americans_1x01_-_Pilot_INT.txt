      A PASTY BUREAUCRAT, late 40 s, may be hitting the jackpot 
      with an attractive but skeezy blond standing at the bar.

                                  BLOND
                    Seriously? The President?

                                  PASTY BUREAUCRAT
                    At this level, there aren t that 
                    many people he can trust.

                                  BLOND
                    How do I know you re not making all 
                    this up?

    The man takes out a leather ID case and shows her his 
      government credential - CLOSE-UP ON THE ID: Department of 
      Justice, the guy s picture, American Eagle embossed in the 
      corner.

                                  PASTY BUREAUCRAT
                    The things I m telling you, you 
                    don t joke around about. It could 
                    be dangerous.



    The pasty bureaucrat sits on the couch naked. The blond, 
      naked from the waist up, straddles him.

                                  PASTY BUREAUCRAT
                    These wiseguys have put a lot of 
                    people underground. Now they re 
                    gonna waste away in their own six 
                    by nine above-ground coffins for 
                    the rest of their natural lives. 
                    You ll see it on the news next week 
                    when the indictments come down -- 
                    think of me, because I did it.

    The blond kisses his neck and starts moving down from there. 
    As she goes...

                                  BLOND
                    What s an indictment?

    Off the pasty bureaucrat, too excited to answer...                                                                                    2.



      NIKOLAI TIMOSHEV -- early 50 s, well-dressed, carrying a 
      suitcase -- gets off a Trailways bus and steps into a run-
      down bus station.  He is the ONLY WHITE PERSON there.  

    He walks casually toward the front door.



      A hand with newly-manicured CRIMSON FINGERNAILS knocks on a  
      shoddy-looking door.

    The door opens. A black man in his 50 s stands there.

                                  FEMALE VOICE 
                    I need to look out your living room 
                    window for a few minutes.

    The crimson-fingernailed hand reaches out with two twenty 
      dollar bills. 

    Off the man, staring at whoever the hand belongs to...



      We re looking over the shoulder of a silhouetted figure in a 
      dark living room -- her hand, with CRIMSON FINGERNAILS, holds 
      a white curtain a fraction of an inch away from the wall -- 
      through the crack we see what she s seeing:

      Three stories down, across the street, Philip and Rob in the 
      alley. Further to her left, an EMPTY STREET CORNER.

      TIMOSHEV turns the corner.



      Philip drives as Elizabeth rolls Timoshev ONTO THE FLOOR in 
      back.  ROB LIES BLEEDING AND HALF-DELIRIOUS on the back seat.  

      Elizabeth tears off strips of Rob s shirt and uses them to 
    try and stop the bleeding from his stomach wound.

      Philip pulls into an...


      I/E. CAR/ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

      ...alley.  He gets out of the car, goes around to the front -- 

    The following takes about TWENTY SECONDS:

    -- Philip bends down and with two turns takes off the PRE-
      LOOSENED SCREWS on the D.C. license plate.  He leaves the 
      screws on the ground, goes to the back of the car and opens 
    the trunk.  He tosses in the FRONT D.C. Plate and TAKES OUT a 
    set of VIRGINIA LICENSE PLATES.  He bends down and removes 
    the screws from the BACK LICENSE PLATE.  He PUTS a VIRGINIA 
      plate on in back.  

    He PEELS OFF TWO MAGNETIC BUMPER STICKERS from the REAR 
      FENDER -- one with a picture of SMOKEY THE BEAR, the other 
      reading  7UP - UNdo it  -- and tosses them in the trunk.                                                                                      9.


    He goes back to the front of the car and puts on the second 
      Virginia plate.  He gets back in the car and drives out...



      ...onto the street.  He makes a turn.  Something HUGE AND 
      WHITE GLOWS outside the car window -- Philip turns onto a 
      bridge, and we see it s the -- LINCOLN MEMORIAL.  WE RE IN 
      WASHINGTON D.C.

      Elizabeth leans forward to talk to Philip. Whispering --

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Heavy bleeding, he s got ten, 
                    fifteen minutes.

                                  PHILIP
                    Arlington Methodist, then 66 to the 
                    Beltway to the drop site?

                                  ELIZABETH
                    We blew our whole window on the 
                    chase, we won t make it.

                                  TIMOSHEV
                    I can help you.  I can make you 
                    very rich.  

      Elizabeth PUTS HER HEEL in Timoshev s mouth.

                                  PHILIP
                          (whispering)
                    So...Parkway to the Beltway, he 
                    dies on the way, and 50/50 we miss 
                    the handoff anyway?

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Just drive fast.

                                  ROB
                          (groaning)
                    I knew the risks. Finish the 
                    mission.

      Elizabeth goes back to Rob, puts a hand on his cheek.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Don t be brave, sweetheart. We 
                    won t let you die.

    Off Philip, not sure this is true...                                                                                    10.


      I/E. CAR - NIGHT

      Philip pulls up to a curb.  He gets out of the car and lifts 
    Rob out of the back seat.  He pulls Rob s wallet out of his 
      pocket and tosses it to Elizabeth in the back seat as he 
      picks Rob up in his arms and...



      ...car and starts to drive. They take a ramp onto a highway. 

      Elizabeth kneels on the back seat and looks out the rear 
      window, SCANNING side to side...

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Back is clear.

      Philip accelerates, CLOSE-UP on the speedometer moving from 
    60 to 70 to 80 to 90 and UP...

                                  PHILIP
                    Time?                                                                                    11.


                                  ELIZABETH
                          (checking watch)
                    Minus seven.

      They pass an ENTRANCE RAMP -- PHILIP S POV: LASER FOCUS on 
      each car coming down the RAMP -- he takes in shape of the 
      car, focuses on sedans that could be unmarked police cars, 
      ZEROES in on silhouettes of occupants -- END PHILIP S POV.

                                  ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                    Minus six.

                                  TIMOSHEV
                    There s another way, please listen 
                    to me, we could all --

      Elizabeth lifts one knee off the back seat and DRIVES HER 
      BOOT DOWN into Timoshev s EYE.



    Men and women with ID badges around their necks check in at a 
      table.  A SIGN on the table reads: KGB ACTIVITIES IN U.S.A. -- 
    THE CURRENT THREAT.  CLASSIFICATION -- TOP SECRET.

    AN AMERICAN FLAG stands on one side of the door to the 
      conference room.  On the other side, A LARGE, FRAMED 
      PHOTOGRAPH of PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN hangs on the wall.



      AGENT STAN BEEMAN, 36, a LITTLE CHUBBY for an FBI Agent, 
      stands next to AGENT CHRIS MIZZI, 30.  

                                  AGENT MIZZI
                      CounterIntelligence is the place to 
                    be right now, Stan. What s it take 
                    to rob a bank? Stick your finger in 
                    your pocket, say,  Gimme all your 
                    money.   In CI, we re up against 
                    the most sophisticated enemy in the 
                    world.

                                  STAN
                    One good thing about bank robbers, 
                    they speak English. They got me in 
                    beginner s Russian starting Monday, 
                    four days a week.

                                  AGENT MIZZI
                    You have an ear for languages?

                                  STAN
                    I had a very hot high school French 
                    teacher one year, I got a B-plus.

                                  AGENT MIZZI
                    Here, you get a 2 on the 
                      proficiency exam, you go up a pay 
                    grade.                                                                                    14.


      SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE MARK Bartholomew, 50 s, his ID 
      clipped to his breast pocket instead of around his neck, 
      walks by.

                                  AGENT MIZZI (CONT D)
                    When are we getting started, boss?

                                  AGENT BARTHOLOMEW
                    Timoshev isn t here.  Twenty 
                    minutes late.

                                  AGENT MIZZI
                    Maybe he had a little too much 
                    vodka last night.

                                  AGENT BARTHOLOMEW
                    I ve been working with him since he 
                    defected, he s never been twenty 
                      secondslate for anything.

                                  AGENT MIZZI
                    Where s he coming in from?

                                  AGENT BARTHOLOMEW
                    Don t know.  Won t do witness 
                      protection, says there are too many 
                    leaks. He only deals with the 
                    Director and the A.G., I don t even 
                    know where he stayed last night.

      Agent Bartholomew walks away.

                                  AGENT MIZZI
                          (indicating Bartholomew)
                    Mormon.  Since Reagan got elected, 
                    starts these fucking meetings at 
                    seven a.m.

                                  STAN
                    Reagan s not a Mormon.

                                  AGENT MIZZI
                    Fundamentalist, whatever.  Their 
                    goal is the same, to wear down the 
                    enemy by getting up earlier than 
                    they do.

                                  STAN
                    Who s Timoshev?                                                                                    15.


                                  AGENT MIZZI
                    Ex-KGB Colonel.  Blew the whistle 
                    on these  Directorate S  undercover 
                    agents they ve supposedly got 
                    hidden all over the U.S.  -- super-
                    secret identities, no one has any 
                    idea who they are.

                                  STAN
                    You don t buy it?

                                  AGENT MIZZI
                    There s not one single piece of 
                    evidence. Then you get guys like 
                    Timoshev, they get these big 
                    resettlement packages when they 
                    defect, millions of dollars.  They 
                    gotta say something to justify it.  
                    So they make up some stories, to 
                    keep us happy.  Super-secret spies, 
                    living right next door to us.  Look 
                    like us, speak English better than 
                    we do-- according to Timoshev, 
                    they re not allowed to speak 
                    another wordof Russian once they 
                    get here.  I mean, come on.  
                    Somebody s reading too many spy 
                    novels.  We re talking figment of 
                    the imagination.  



      A car trunk SWINGS OPEN.  

      Inside, TIMOSHEV lies on his side, HANDCUFFED and HOG-TIED.  
      Each arm and leg is also strapped separately to bars in the 
      frame of the trunk.  His head is STRAPPED DOWN.  He CANNOT 
      MOVE AN INCH.  

      A WIRE MOUTHGUARD is buckled across his face -- a HEAVY 
      RUBBER BLOCK attached to the mouthguard is WEDGED BETWEEN his 
      TEETH -- it extends down into his throat and prevents him 
      from talking or making noise.

      PULL BACK to REVEAL Philip, standing in front of the open 
      trunk of his Monte Carlo.  The HOOD of the car is UP, too.  
      Philip holds a cup of water with a straw in it.

                                  PHILIP
                          (whispering)
                    You understand if you make any 
                    noise I ll kill you immediately.                                                                                    16.


      Timoshev raises his eyebrows to indicate that he understands.

      Philip unbuckles the wire mouthguard and takes the restraint 
    out of Timoshev s mouth, which is a bloody mess from where 
      Elizabeth stomped on it.  He puts the straw up to his lips.

                                  TIMOSHEV
                          (whispering)
                    The FBI paid me three million 
                    dollars when I came over, and more 
                    since as a consultant.  

                                  PHILIP
                          (surprised)
                    Three million --

                                  TIMOSHEV
                    You will get twice that!  Three 
                    million as the most valued of 
                    defectors, a Directorate S officer, 
                    another three for returning me. Go 
                    to the FBI and tell them --

      Philip stuffs the rubber block back into Timoshev s mouth and 
      re-fastens the mouthguard.  He shuts the trunk.  

    Off Philip, standing over the trunk, thinking...



      ELIZABETH stands behind the kitchen counter.  PAIGE, 13, and 
      HENRY, 10, sit at the table eating breakfast. Henry reads the 
      sports section.  

      PHILIP WALKS IN.

                                  PHILIP
                    Car won t start, we re gonna have 
                    to take the bus to the metro.

                                  HENRY
                    Dad, Valenzuela pitched a one-
                    hitter last night.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    I m not going in today.

      Philip goes over to Elizabeth by the sink.  He turns on the 
      faucet to cover their conversation from the kids. As he 
      washes his hands --                                                                                    17.


                                  PHILIP
                          (sotto)
                    Do you know what they paid that 
                    asshole? Three million dollars.

                                  ELIZABETH
                          (sotto)
                    Henry was looking for his 
                      skateboard. It s not in the garage, 
                    is it?

      Paige gets up from the table, takes a Styrofoam cup from a 
      cabinet, and pours herself a cup of coffee.  

                                  PAIGE
                    Bye.

      Paige walks out the door.  Philip and Elizabeth, both 
      surprised by the coffee, watch her, but don t say anything. 
      Henry grabs his backpack and follows Paige out.

                                  PHILIP
                          (calling after Henry)
                    No coffee for you?

                                  ELIZABETH
                    We have to get him out of here 
                    tonight.

                                  PHILIP
                    I just coded the message, I ll drop 
                    it on the way to work, get 
                    instructions back this afternoon, 
                    hand him off after the kids go to 
                    sleep.  You don t have to stay 
                    home, he s secure in there.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    There were witnesses. If they put 
                    it together, they could be looking 
                    for him in a few hours. I m gonna 
                    stay.

                                  PHILIP
                    I told you we should have built 
                    that secret underground chamber in 
                    the basement with the dual air 
                    vents and the weather-proof walls.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    You mean that wine cellar you 
                    wanted to put in under the laundry 
                    room?                                                                                    18.


                                  PHILIP
                    I said it could have other uses.

      Elizabeth refills her coffee cup.

                                  PHILIP (CONT D)
                    Anyway, three million dollars he 
                    got.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    He can buy himself a diamond-plated 
                    coffin.

      Elizabeth gets the dirty plates from the table.

    Off Philip s ambivalent look, which Elizabeth doesn t see...



      PHILIP S POV: 

      (NOTE: POV shots are used throughout to show what 
      intelligence officers are trained to see and hear in 
      operational environments) 

      AUDIO: LOUD - pneumatic hiss of a train. SOFT, FROM DIFFERENT 
      DIRECTIONS - distant RADIO STATIC, SHORT SERIES OF ELECTRONIC 
      BEEPS, garbled VOICE ON A WALKIE-TALKIE.

      VISUAL: a quick scan of Philip s field of vision, left to 
      right -- jump back to the left and repeat the scan, this time 
      focused on faces -- every third or fourth person, Philip 
      LASER-FOCUSES IN for half a second ON A SPECIFIC 
      CHARACTERISTIC -- AN OLD WOMAN S EARLOBE, A YOUNG MAN S LIP, 
      DEEP POUCHES UNDER A MIDDLE-AGED MAN S EYES -- features that 
    are hard to change quickly with disguise --                                                                                     19.


      NEXT VISUAL: the crowd thins -- he s turning a corner -- a 
      waist-high cement balustrade on the right -- Philip comes 
      close to it, stops, turns, faces an empty track where a train 
      will arrive. 

      NEXT VISUAL: SCAN left to right, REPEAT -- in lower right 
      field of vision, Philip sees his right hand reach around into 
    his back pocket, when --

      LEFT PERIPHERAL VISION, TWO COPS appear. They lean against 
    the balustrade very close to Philip.

    WE JUMP OUT OF PHILIP S POV TO:

      A shot of Philip and two cops leaning against the balustrade. 
    The cops chat. Philip looks straight ahead -- an almost 
      imperceptible SMILE spreads across his face.

      BACK TO PHILIP S POV:

      Cops in left peripheral vision -- right hand reaches into 
      back pocket -- something comes out -- reaching back with it, 
    up and over the balustrade --

      JUMP OUT OF PHILIP S POV AGAIN AND CLOSE-UP ON:

      Philip s hand as he reaches behind his back without looking 
    and STICKS WHATEVER HE TOOK OUT OF HIS POCKET onto the 
      backside of the cement balustrade -- 

      CLOSE-UP on the OBJECT -- it s a SMALL, THIN SLICE OF CEMENT 
      that LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE the cement balustrade.

      A train pulls into the station.  Philip steps across the 
      platform and gets on.  



      Philip and Elizabeth s daughter Paige comes out of the 
      cafeteria line carrying a tray.  She sits down at a table 
      with three boys -- two of them are playing chess.  The third 
    is TOM, 13, SEVERE ACNE.

                                  PAIGE
                          (glancing at the board)
                    Knight to queen s bishop three --

                                  CHESS PLAYER #1
                          (moving knight)
                    I was just about to do that.

                                  CHESS PLAYER #2
                    Paige!                                                                                    20.


                                  TOM
                    So I m not going to New York this 
                    weekend.

                                  PAIGE
                    Oh yeah?

                                  TOM
                    My aunt got rickets.  So now I 
                    might go to the dance.

                                  PAIGE
                    What re rickets?

      A group of more attractive, athletic boys walk past.  Off 
      Paige, watching them...



      Philip sits at his desk in a private office, looking down at 
      a hand-written ledger.

      STAVOS, 40 s, Greek-American, dressed in an embroidered tunic 
      that looks good on him, comes in.

                                  STAVOS
                    Philip, do not look so gloomy. Our 
                    new President will end the 
                    recession and bring wealth and 
                    prosperity to all. If not, you can 
                    sell those shoes and keep us going 
                    for another two or three years.

      They both look down at Philip s FERRAGAMO shoes.

      Philip tosses the ledger onto his desk and comes over to 
      Stavos. He puts his arm around him as they walk into the...



      ...hallway.

                                  PHILIP
                    Why did I give you that raise last 
                    year, Stavos?

                                  STAVOS
                    The Greek charm.

                                  PHILIP
                    Is that a thing?                                                                                    21.


      They continue into the...



      ...outer office of an upscale travel agency.  TRAVEL AGENTS 
      answer phones, write out PAPER AIRLINE TICKETS, look at GREEN 
      BLINKING CURSORS on BIG CRT MONITORS. We are on an upper 
      floor of an office building, not a storefront.

      Philip sits down on HELENE S desk -- she s in her late 60 s -- 
      while ANGELA, 20 s, looks over from her desk, wishing Philip 
      were flirting with her.

                                  PHILIP
                    Helene, sweetheart, can you call 
                    your pal Bert at Allied and ask him 
                    to settle up for this month?

                                  HELENE
                    You know he s going to ask me out.

                                  PHILIP
                    He s only human, Helene.

      Philip heads back to his office. On the way, he stares at a 
      POSTER on the wall of a MAN IN A TUXEDO getting into a 
      limousine in NEW YORK CITY.



      Elizabeth sits on the couch reading a copy of LADY S CIRCLE 
      MAGAZINE with (a very young) CAROL BURNETT and ALAN ALDA on 
    the cover.  She keeps looking up at the hallway.  Finally, 
    she gets up and goes into the...



      ...hallway, which she follows to... 



      ...the garage.  She closes the door behind her.

    She goes to the back of the Monte Carlo.  She stares at the 
      trunk.                                                                                    22.



      Free weights, a canvas punching bag hanging from the ceiling -
      - RED BANNERS on the wall, in RUSSIAN -- a single bulb lights 
    up one corner of the gym, where --

      ELIZABETH -- 18-years-old, in grey workout clothes, is in a 
      fighting stance. Her TRAINER, 50 s, stands across from her.  

      Elizabeth FAKES WITH HER LEFT, then THROWS A RIGHT ELBOW at 
    the trainer. He pivots, and the elbow misses.

                                  TRAINER
                    Again.

      Elizabeth repeats the move, the trainer slips it again. A MAN 
      appears behind the trainer.

                                  MAN
                    What have we here?

      Elizabeth and her trainer stop and turn towards the man -- 
      it s TIMOSHEV, twenty years younger. 

                                  TRAINER
                    Captain, I -- didn t know you were 
                    back.

                                  TIMOSHEV
                    You two are working late.

                                  TRAINER
                    She has great promise. We are 
                    putting in extra work.

                                  TIMOSHEV
                    Leave us. I will teach her how we 
                    do it in the field.

    The trainer hesitates.

                                  TIMOSHEV (CONT D)
                    Go.

    The trainer leaves.

                                  TIMOSHEV (CONT D)
                    Now my dear, again.

      Elizabeth raises her hands, fakes, then throws the elbow at 
      Timoshev -- he steps aside, and Elizabeth stumbles.                                                                                    23.


                                  ELIZABETH
                          (slight Russian accent)
                    I am sorry.

                                  TIMOSHEV
                    I msorry. Use the contraction. Now 
                    faster!

      Elizabeth lunges again, Timoshev slips the blow but this time 
      HITS Elizabeth in the face with the heel of his palm.

                                  TIMOSHEV (CONT D)
                    Watch! Don t overcommit.

    At the gym door, the trainer stands outside in the dark 
      hallway, looking through the small window -- he s worried. 

      Elizabeth lunges at Timoshev again, harder and faster -- she 
      misses -- Timoshev HITS her again, then SHOVES her backwards 
      onto some mats in a dark corner of the gym.

      Timoshev moves towards Elizabeth -- she scrambles to her feet 
    -- he MOVES CLOSER -- she gets into a fighting stance -- he 
      MOVES CLOSER -- she steps back, stumbles onto the mats --

      Timoshev throws himself on top of Elizabeth. Trained for 
      close-quarters combat, she shoots her thumb straight at his 
      eye. Timoshev grabs her wrist just in time. He smiles, even 
      though it was close, and SLAMS her arm down. Elizabeth 
      maneuvers to push him off with her legs, but he s got her 
      pinned.

      Timoshev puts a forearm against Elizabeth s throat and PUSHES 
      - Elizabeth s breathing SLOWS, gets labored - Timoshev waits 
      until she lets out a few weak CHOKES - he lets go of her 
      pinned arm, reaches down, pulls her pants down, then his.

    As he pushes into her, he takes his forearm off her throat. 
    OFF ELIZABETH, gasping for air...

    END OF FLASHBACK



      Elizabeth opens the trunk.  

      Timoshev looks up at her.  

      Elizabeth stares down at him.  Timoshev SQUINTS -- she looks 
      familiar, but he can t quite place her.  But the harder she 
      glares at him, the more he seems to realize he SHOULD know 
    who she is.                                                                                    24.


    And then his eyes narrow a little more.  He may remember.

    Off Elizabeth, STARTING TO SHAKE WITH RAGE...

                                    END ACT ONE                                                                                    25.


                                        ACT TWO



      Elizabeth walks down the hall.  She hears: TAP TAP KA-JIIING! 

    She goes into...



      ...Paige s room.  Paige types on a SMITH-CORONA, hitting the 
      manual carriage return at the end of every line.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    What re you working on?

                                  PAIGE
                    Social studies.  Paper on how the 
                    Russians cheat on arms control.

      Paige continues to type with her back to Elizabeth. 
      Elizabeth s face contorts as she keeps back all the things 
    she wants to say. Finally --

                                  ELIZABETH
                    That s Mr. Henrickson? I don t know 
                    how you can look at him all day, 
                    with that harelip.

                                  PAIGE
                          (without turning around)
                    Mom, that s his handicap!

      Elizabeth glares at the back of Paige s head, then turns 
      around and goes out into...                                                                                    26.



      ...the hallway.  She walks down the hall and into...



      ...Henry s room. Henry sits on the floor, his back against 
    his bed, reading an ARCHIE COMIC. Several more Archies are 
      scattered around him.

      Elizabeth sits down next to him. She looks over his shoulder 
    at a PANEL of ARCHIE and JUGHEAD. A look of DESPAIR flashes 
      across her face.



      Philip walks in.  Elizabeth, Paige, and Henry are already 
      having dinner.  

                                  HENRY
                    Hey dad.

      Elizabeth gets up and meets Philip at the sink.  He kisses 
      her.  She turns on the faucets. 

                                  PHILIP
                    I made the drop at the metro, no 
                    response.  

                                  ELIZABETH
                    I could just fix up the spare 
                    bedroom for him.

                                  PHILIP
                    I ve got a meeting after dinner, 
                    I ll get something.

      Philip and Elizabeth sit down at the table.

                                  PHILIP (CONT D)
                    Don t fill up on vegetables, we re 
                    going out for dessert.



      Philip stands in front of the mirror with his shirt off.

      There s a small, red puncture wound just over his heart -- he 
      puts his index fingers on either side of it and PULLS, 
      spreading the skin out -- he looks in the mirror, like he s 
      trying to peer INTO the tiny hole --                                                                                    27.


                                  ELIZABETH
                          (O.S.)
                    You coming?



      Philip and Elizabeth sit next to each other on one side of a 
      table, Paige and Henry sit across from them. They all have 
      various Dairy Queen concoctions -- Philip s is a Krunch-Kote 
      dipped cone.

                                  PHILIP
                    Do you want a taste?

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Are you going to push it in my 
                    face?

                                  PHILIP
                    Absolutely not.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Are you sure?

                                  PHILIP
                    Of course.

      Elizabeth looks at him warily -- Philip smiles.                                                                                    28.


                                  ELIZABETH
                    I don t trust you.

                                  PHILIP
                    You can trust me, honey. For God s 
                    sake. When was the last time I did 
                    that?

      Elizabeth leans in towards Philip s cone -- slow and 
      untrustworthy -- closer, closer -- he smushes a little bit of 
    ice cream in her face.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Damn it! I knew it. You said you 
                    weren t gonna do it.

                                  PHILIP
                    You knew I was gonna do it. 

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Here, have a bite of mine.

                                  PHILIP
                    Oh, sure.

      Elizabeth flicks some of her ice cream at Philip. He grabs 
    her and they end up snuggling.

                                  PAIGE
                    It s not even embarrassing what you 
                    guys are doing, it s just a waste 
                    of ice cream.

                                  HENRY
                    Seriously, grow up.



      A STRANGE, LOW NOISE in the DARKNESS -- it almost hurts to 
      listen to it. 

    We start to make out the shape of a body -- TIMOSHEV in the 
      trunk.

      What is that noise? Dentists and certain sadists may identify 
    it as the sound of enamel against metal.



    The Mustang pulls up in front of the Jennings  townhouse.                                                                                     29.


                                  PAIGE
                    Why are you meeting a client so 
                    late?

    As Henry opens his door and the DOME LIGHT goes on, Philip 
      turns around and looks at Paige.

                                  PHILIP
                    He s coming in on a late flight, 
                    it s more of a social meeting.

    Off Philip, smiling at Paige as he lies to her face...



      A MAN in a cheap grey suit, with light brown hair and 
      glasses, stands outside a door.  He s carrying a briefcase. 
      Probably a mid-level government bureaucrat. Kind of handsome, 
      despite the unstylish glasses and bad haircut. 

    He TAKES OFF his wedding ring and puts it in his pocket.

      HOLD ON A SECOND -- it s PHILIP, in disguise.  He knocks. The 
      door opens to REVEAL...

      MARTHA HANSON, 30, VERY PLAIN.  Philip walks into...



      ...her apartment.

                                  PHILIP
                    How ve you been, Martha?

                                  MARTHA
                    Fine, Clark.  

      Philip smiles at her. Martha smiles back.  Though she s 
      trying to hide it, she s clearly in love with him.

      Philip sits down on the couch in the small living room.  He 
      opens his briefcase and takes out a clipboard.

                                  PHILIP
                          (reading fast)
                      Referencing meeting taking place 
                    Twenty-Two April 1981, I understand 
                    that the contents of this meeting 
                    are classified Top Secret by the 
                    Internal Affairs Division of the 
                    Committee to Oversee United States 
                      CounterIntelligence Agencies.                                                                                    30.


      Martha sits down next to him on the couch.

                                  PHILIP (CONT D)
                    Do you swear to tell the truth, the 
                    whole truth, and nothing but the 
                    truth?

                                  MARTHA
                          (raising her hand)
                    I do.

      Philip takes out a notebook and a pen.

                                  PHILIP
                    Big day at FBI CounterIntelligence?

                                  MARTHA
                    Yes, it was.

                                  PHILIP
                    Well, obviously, we know most of 
                    it, but I want to hear the details 
                    from you. You never know when a 
                    crisis can provide an opportunity
                    to uncover the leaks we ve been 
                    looking for in your office.  Just 
                    tell me everything you saw. 

                                  MARTHA
                    Well...I know that a man was 
                    kidnapped.  I think he was supposed 
                    to speak at a conference this 
                    morning, but he never showed up.  
                    Agent Bartholomew was very upset.

      Philip writes in his notebook.

                                  PHILIP
                    Did there appear to be a 
                      centralized response to the 
                      kidnapping?

                                  MARTHA
                    They were in the secure vault all 
                    day.

                                  PHILIP
                    Did you get a look inside?

                                  MARTHA
                    They don t let me in there, you 
                    know that.                                                                                    31.


      Philip and Martha both smile. Philip gazes into Martha s 
      eyes, waits until her lips start to tremble.

                                  PHILIP
                    Go on.  

                                  MARTHA
                    The man they kidnapped was Russian.  
                    Someone very important, in the KGB, 
                    I think.  By early afternoon, they 
                    tied it to a police report in 
                    Northwest D.C. about a man who was 
                    kidnapped last night.  They have a 
                    vehicle description,  77 Chevrolet 
                    Monte Carlo, dark red, D.C. Plates.  
                    Bumper stickers.

                                  PHILIP
                    Descriptions of the kidnappers?

                                  MARTHA
                    Two men and a woman.  One of the 
                    men was tall with dark hair.

                                  PHILIP
                    What specific actions did Agent 
                      Bartholomew order?

                                  MARTHA
                    Extra agents were sent to surveil 
                    the Soviet embassy, and agents went 
                    out to all ports and train 
                    stations.  They thought the 
                    Russians were going to take the man 
                    out of the country. 

                                  PHILIP
                    How would you describe Agent 
                    Bartholomew s mood?

                                  MARTHA
                      Um...angry?

                                  PHILIP
                    He was taking it personally?

                                  MARTHA
                    I don t want to say anything bad 
                    about him, but I...I think he was
                    taking it personally.

      Philip writes in his notebook.                                                                                    32.


                                  MARTHA (CONT D)
                    I don t want to get him in trouble.  
                    Sometimes I feel bad --

                                  PHILIP
                    Our CounterIntelligence units 
                    safeguard the security of our 
                    nation, Martha.  Wehave to 
                    safeguard theirsecurity.  

      Philip packs up his briefcase.

                                  PHILIP (CONT D)
                    I have to get back to the office 
                    with this right away.

      Philip stands, gives Martha an approving nod -- she nods back 
      bravely -- he exits into...



      ...the hallway. 

    OFF PHILIP, walking away down the hall, all business...



      Philip pulls an entire rectangle of grouting out from around 
      a brick -- we see it s a fabricated device that looks like 
      grouting, but can be taken out and replaced. He removes the 
      brick to reveal a hidden compartment. Inside are several 
      small cement concealment devices of the type Philip used 
      earlier for his deaddrop at the Metro Station, two tubes 
      filled with chemicals, a gun, a blond wig, and a 
      microcassette recorder.

    He takes out the microcassette recorder and hits play.

                                    ELIZABETH S VOICE
                    Tell me what you want next.

                                  PASTY BUREAUCRAT S VOICE
                    I don t know.

                                    ELIZABETH S VOICE
                    How about this?

                                  PASTY BUREAUCRAT S VOICE
                    I don t know, I don t know, yes!                                                                                    33.


                                    ELIZABETH S VOICE
                    Didn t a girl ever put her finger 
                    up your ass before? That s right -- 
                    oh yeah, now you got it...

    As Elizabeth whispers and moans, Philip looks down at the 
      blond wig -- we see a QUICK FLASH in his mind of Elizabeth in 
    the wig, not looking exactly the same as in the hotel with 
    the bureaucrat, but lips pursed, eyes closed...

    He fast forwards.

                                    ELIZABETH S VOICE (CONT D)
                    Oh God, Oh God, Oh God, You re 
                    You re You re --

      Philip fast forwards, further this time.


                                    ELIZABETH S VOICE (CONT D)
                    There s something -- I don t know -- 
                    if I were gonna see you again, I d 
                    want you to be a little...

                                  PASTY BUREAUCRAT
                    What?

                                    ELIZABETH S VOICE
                    I don t want to hurt your feelings.

                                  PASTY BUREAUCRAT
                    Tell me!

                                    ELIZABETH S VOICE
                    Just -- maybe -- stronger, maybe?

      Philip can t help smiling at the artistry of this. He fast 
      forwards a little bit.

                                  PASTY BUREAUCRAT S VOICE
                    Do you know what the KGB is?

                                    ELIZABETH S VOICE
                    Um...I ve heard of them.

                                  PASTY BUREAUCRAT S VOICE
                    This weekend I m giving a hundred 
                    thousand dollars cashto a KGB 
                    officer who s coming to town to --

      Philip shuts off the recorder.                                                                                    34.



      Philip comes in.  Elizabeth is in bed watching a very-not-
      flat-screen TV.  Philip TURNS UP THE VOLUME, then sits down 
    on the bed.  

                                  PHILIP
                    FBI has the car description with 
                    the D.C. plates.  They haven t 
                    connected it to a stabbing victim 
                    at Arlington Methodist, but it 
                    won t be long.  They re all over 
                    our guys at the embassy, who must 
                    have made the surveillance, which 
                    is why they can t get out to pick 
                    up my message or respond.  We have 
                    to assume, with the FBI on them 
                    like that, they re on a full 
                      operational standdown.  

                                  ELIZABETH
                    We should just get rid of him 
                    ourselves, Philip.

                                  PHILIP
                    Whoa, take it easy.  What s the big 
                    rush?

                                  ELIZABETH
                    On an operational standdown, we re 
                    authorized to make our own 
                    decisions.

                                  PHILIP
                    Yeah, but, come on -- why do you 
                    want to kill this guy so badly?

                                  ELIZABETH
                    I want him out of my house! He s 
                    putting us all in danger.  They re 
                    just going to kill him back in 
                    Moscow anyway.

                                  PHILIP
                    We should at least try to complete 
                    our mission the way it was 
                    assigned.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    We have to adjust to circumstances.

                                  PHILIP
                    Hey, if you re that worried about 
                    it, we could just defect ourselves. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    35.

                                  PHILIP (CONT'D)
                    We d be millionaires. We wouldn t 
                    have to worry about going to jail 
                    and leaving the kids all alone 
                    anymore. A lot of our problems 
                    would just go away. Poof.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Very funny. 

      Philip lies down. 

                                  PHILIP
                    Let s see if we hear anything 
                    tomorrow.

      Philip moves towards Elizabeth. She puts her hand on his 
      chest to stop him. He rolls back to his side of the bed.

    Off Philip, starting up at the ceiling, frustrated, clearly 
    not for the first time...



      Philip and Elizabeth stand in the kitchen.

                                  PHILIP
                    You sure you don t want to come? 
                    You haven t even seen the new mall.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    It s a mall.

                                  PHILIP
                    This place is like -- fountains, 
                    skylights. 

      Elizabeth nods toward the garage -- she wants to stay and 
      keep watch.

      Paige and Henry come in.  Elizabeth and Philip share a look 
    at Paige s slightly-too-sexy outfit. The family walks out...



      Philip and Paige walk into the shoe department. Paige 
      disappears down an aisle of women s shoes. Philip stops at a 
      table of men s shoes.  He picks up a pair of BRUNO MAGLIS.  
    He holds them up, feels the leather.  He flips them over and 
      looks at the price - $200.

    He stops and listens to the piped-in music --  Cherokee 
      Fiddle,  from Urban Cowboy:

      When the train pulled into the station                       
      He d open up his case and rosin up his bow...                   

      Philip picks up a pair of COWBOY BOOTS on the table, looks 
      them over.

      A HUGE MAN with BULGING TATTOOED BICEPS walks into the shoe 
      department with his arm around a heavily made-up TEENAGE 
      GIRL.  Philip watches as the man pats the girl on the ass.  



      Elizabeth looks out the kitchen window as the teenage boy, 
    his shirt off now, helps the movers carry furniture.

    She takes three sharp knives out of a drawer.  She puts each 
    one in her right hand and feels its weight.  



      Philip, wearing the cowboy boots he was just looking at, 
      dances an improvised two-step in the aisle (he obviously saw 
      Urban Cowboy) as  Cherokee Fiddle  plays:

       Now the Indians are dressing up like cowboys               
    And the cowboys are putting leather and turquoise on           
    And the music is sold by lawyers, And the fools that fiddled 
    in the middle of the station are gone 

      Philip isn t trying to put on a show, but everyone who walks 
    by smiles -- he s so good-looking, confident, and naturally 
      graceful there s no way not to enjoy watching him.

    As he dances, Paige comes out from an aisle of women s shoes, 
      sees him, and holds up a shoebox -- she s ready to go. Philip 
      meets her at the register. They get in line next to the huge 
      tattooed man and his teenage girlfriend. 

                                  TATTOOED MAN
                          (looking Paige up and 
                          down)
                    I like what I m seein  here. You 
                    ready to break-out darlin , or you 
                    just playin dress-up?

                                  PHILIP
                    Go wait for me over there, 
                      sweetheart.

                                  PAIGE
                    Daddy --

                                  PHILIP
                    Please go.

      Paige walks over to a nearby bench. Philip glances down at 
    the man s credit card, which is out on the counter.

                                  PHILIP (CONT D)
                    Errol, she s thirteen.                                                                                    38.


                                  ERROL
                    Keep your eye on her, daddy.  Once 
                    they bleed, they got the need.

      Errol smiles, and waits - he s obviously used to these 
      moments, where a smaller man is summoning the courage to take 
      a swing at him, or not - usually not.

      A few seconds pass. Finally, Errol signs his credit card slip 
    and walks off. Philip goes over and sits down next to Paige 
    on the bench.

                                  PHILIP
                    You re getting older, so...

                                  PAIGE
                    I know, I know.

                                  PHILIP
                    It s no use fighting guys like 
                    that.

                                  PAIGE
                    Oh, God, I wouldn t want you to.



      Elizabeth stands over the closed trunk of the Monte Carlo, 
      gripping one of the knives from the kitchen, blade down, 
      cross-body like in the flashback. 

    OFF ELIZABETH, debating...



      Philip, Paige, and Henry come in through the kitchen door.  
    The kids disappear into the house. Philip looks over at the 
      counter and sees two knives there.  

      Elizabeth comes in -- she s holding a knife. Philip opens his 
      mouth to ask about it when she says --

                                  ELIZABETH
                    I met the new neighbors.  We re 
                    going over later to say hello.

    She opens the oven, takes out a tray of brownies, puts it on 
    the counter. She starts to cut the brownies with the knife.

                                  PHILIP
                    Shouldn t you let those cool?                                                                                    39.


                                  ELIZABETH
                    Have you ever made brownies?

      Philip puts his arms around Elizabeth from behind.

                                  PHILIP
                    Bitchy. You know that turns me on.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Note where the knife is now.

    We follow Philip s gaze to the tip of the knife blade, which 
    is right on top of his thigh.

                                  PHILIP
                    Femoral artery -- verybitchy.

      Philip lets go of her. She goes back to cutting the brownies.

                                  PHILIP (CONT D)
                    So you liked these new neighbors?

                                  ELIZABETH
                    I want Paige to meet the boy before 
                    the neighborhood girls descend. 
                    He s a worker.  

                                  PHILIP
                    A worker? Does he have a job?

                                  ELIZABETH
                    No...he does things. Helps out. 
                    Moves things. Not lazy.



      Philip and Henry sit on the couch watching TV -- CLINT 
      EASTWOOD in DIRTY HARRY. 

      Elizabeth walks in.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Come on, we re going.

      A  BOOM  comes from the TV as Harry shoots the punk. Henry 
      gets up and walks out of the room. Philip gets up and backs 
    out of the room slowly, still watching the TV.



      ...to a living room the exact size and shape of their own 
      living room.  Boxes are everywhere.

                                  SANDRA
                    Well, it s a mess...

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Don t say a thing, it s moving day.  
                    We ll help you unpack.  Henry can 
                    come over all day tomorrow if you 
                    want.

      Henry looks surprised.

      Sandra s son, MATTHEW, 15, walks in.  

                                  SANDRA
                    This is Matthew.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    And this is Paige.  She s a 
                    freshman at East Falls Church.  And 
                    Henry.  And Philip.

      Paige manages an awkward smile.

                                  SANDRA
                    Where s your father?

                                  MATTHEW
                    Upstairs.

      A man comes down the steps -- it s FBI AGENT STAN BEEMAN.

                                  STAN
                    We got visitors already?                                                                                    41.


                                  SANDRA
                    This is Stan.

      Stan and Philip shake hands.

                                  PHILIP
                    Phil Jennings.

                                  STAN
                    Stan Beeman.

                                  PHILIP
                    My wife, Elizabeth, and Paige and 
                    Henry.

                                  STAN
                    Howdy, all.  Those brownies?

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Homemade.

      Stan takes one.  

                                  STAN
                    So this a good neighborhood we re 
                    moving into, Philip?

                                  PHILIP
                    I wouldn t live anywhere else.  
                    It s safe, clean. Commute into 
                    D.C. s not too bad. You work in the 
                    city?

                                  STAN
                    Yup.

                                  PHILIP
                    What do you do, Stan?

                                  STAN
                    I m an FBI Agent.

    For just a split-second, Philip looks surprised.

                                  PHILIP
                    FBI, no kidding. You chase bank 
                    robbers and stuff?

                                  STAN
                    Actually, I work in 
                      counterintelligence.                                                                                    42.


                                  PHILIP
                    That s what, against...spies and 
                    things?

                                  STAN
                    That s right.

                                  PHILIP
                    Well, I ll have to make sure I 
                    don t do any spying around here.

                                  STAN
                    You better not. Especially for the 
                    Russians.

                                  PHILIP
                    They re the worst, right?

                                  STAN
                    They certainly are, Philip. They 
                    certainly are.

                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    43.


                                      ACT THREE



    The washing machine and dryer whirr and boom, covering Philip 
    and Elizabeth s conversation.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    It s probably a coincidence. FBI 
                    agents have to live somewhere.

                                  PHILIP
                    Or they re onto us.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    And this is what? 

                                  PHILIP
                    The endgame. Trying to make us do 
                    something stupid.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Either way, we have to get rid of 
                    Timoshev tonight. I almost did it 
                    myself this morning, but I thought 
                    you d be pissed.

                                  PHILIP
                    If they re watching us, the last 
                    thing we want to do is kill him.  
                    That s life in prison. No deals, 
                    nothing.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    We take those risks every day, 
                    Philip. That s what we do. 

                                  PHILIP
                    Maybe there s another way.

      Elizabeth waits.  

                                  PHILIP (CONT D)
                    Look, maybe this is an opportunity. 
                    Maybe it s the perfect time for us 
                    to think about -- just living the 
                    life we re living. But just -- 
                    really living it. Just -- being us. 

                                  ELIZABETH
                    What are you talking about?                                                                                    44.


                                  PHILIP
                    I m saying we might be blown. I m 
                    saying if we re under surveillance, 
                    we can t kill Timoshev. And I m 
                    saying we arePhilip and Elizabeth 
                    Jennings. We have been for a long 
                    time. So let s get ahead of this. 
                    Make the first move. Offer 
                    ourselves to them. We can get a lot 
                    of money -- three million for 
                    giving Timoshev back, three million 
                    for us. Get relocated. And just be 
                    happy. Take the good life. 

    For a second, Elizabeth is too stunned to speak.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Are you joking? Is this a joke?

                                  PHILIP
                    No. 

                                  ELIZABETH
                    You want to betray our country? 

                                  PHILIP
                    I don t think it s such a betrayal.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Defecting to America?

                                  PHILIP
                    America s not really so bad. We ve 
                    been here a long time, what s so 
                    bad about it? The...the electricity 
                    works all the time, the food, the, 
                      the...closet-space --

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Is that what you care about?

                                  PHILIP
                    I care about everything. 

                                  ELIZABETH
                    But Paige and Henry, what --

                                  PHILIP
                    We could make a good life for them, 
                    we d have money, security --

                                  ELIZABETH
                    And you d...what would you tell 
                    them?                                                                                    45.


                                  PHILIP
                    The truth.

    She SLAPS him.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    You swore, Philip! You swore! We 
                    made a promise never to tell them! 
                    To let them grow up and have their 
                    own lives. They re notto be a part 
                    of this. 

                                  PHILIP
                    You say that, but I can see you 
                    can t stand it. You can t stand 
                    them being American, I can tell -- 
                    every day. Wouldn t you be happier 
                    if they knew the truth?

                                  ELIZABETH
                    I m not donewith them. They don t 
                    have to be regular Americans. They 
                    can change this place. Maybe 
                    they ll be socialists, or --

                                  PHILIP
                    They re not gonna be communists, 
                    this place doesn t turn out --

                                  ELIZABETH
                    -- or communists, who knows? But 
                    this -- this would ruin them! That 
                    it was all a lie? Everything -- 
                    everything in their lives would 
                    fall apart. They d never speak to 
                    us again, Philip! Besides, you re 
                    not talking about telling them the 
                    truth so we can go back to Russia. 
                    You want to defect! You want us all
                    to be Americans! 

                                  PHILIP
                    I want to defect before we re 
                    arrested and they find out anyway.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Really? How long have you been 
                    thinking about this, Philip?

                                  PHILIP
                    I...I don t know.

      Elizabeth storms out.                                                                                    46.


    Off Philip, standing alone...



      Stan sits behind the wheel of a PEA-GREEN CHRYSLER VALIANT 
      CHARGER.  His wife Sandra stands outside the car.

      Stan tries to start the car -- it makes a mechanical SCREECH.

                                  STAN
                    Battery s dead.  Could be sabotage.

                                  SANDRA
                    Democrats?

                                  STAN
                    Probably.



      Philip, 21-YEARS-OLD, sits on a bench in an empty hallway. 
      He s looking down at something in his hands.

      CLOSE-UP on the small photograph he s holding -- it s a 
      picture of a beautiful young woman.

      Philip tears up the picture, stands, walks over to a trash 
      can, and drops in the pieces of the photograph.

      A MAN IN UNIFORM, in his 40 s, appears at the top of a 
      staircase. This is the SAME MAN who stood next to TIMOSHEV in 
      Elizabeth s flashback when she was practicing knife skills -- 
      he s COLONEL ZHUKOV, who runs the KGB training facility.

      Philip stiffens.

                                  PHILIP
                    Colonel.

                                  COLONEL ZHUKOV
                    Come.

      Colonel Zhukov leads Philip through a door and into...                                                                                    47.



      ...an office. There s a bust of Lenin on a desk, a framed 
      photograph of Khrushchev on the wall. 

    In the middle of the room, Elizabeth, 20 now (2 years after 
    the last flashback), sits at a table. Her hair is in a tight 
      bun. There s smoked salmon and bread on the table, tea cups. 

                                  COLONEL ZHUKOV
                    Philip, I d like you to meet 
                    Elizabeth. Elizabeth, this is 
                    Philip.

                                  ELIZABETH
                          (only a trace of her 
                            Russian accent remains)
                    Pleased to meet you.

                                  PHILIP
                          (also just a trace of a 
                            Russian accent)
                    Likewise.

                                  COLONEL ZHUKOV
                    I ll leave you two to get 
                      acquainted. There s so much to talk 
                    about. Your lives up until now. 
                    Philip and Elizabeth slives. Not
                    the other ones. Those should never
                    be discussed. It will be easier to 
                    believein the Elizabeth who grew 
                    up in Columbus, Ohio, Philip, if 
                    you don t know any other story. 
                    Elizabeth, you will be less likely 
                    to make a slip one day, if there is 
                    no otherversion of this man that 
                    you are hiding away in the back of 
                    your mind.

      Colonel Zhukov leaves the room. 

      Philip sits down across from Elizabeth. He s not yet as 
      confident, as physically prepossessing, as the older Philip.

    He takes a piece of salmon and puts it on a cracker.

                                  PHILIP
                    Tea?

      Elizabeth nods.  He pours her a cup. 

      They sit there, without saying a word.                                                                                    48.


    END FLASHBACK



      ...into the living room.

                                  PHILIP
                    Sure no beer?

                                  STAN
                    Yeah, I gotta go into work later.

                                  PHILIP
                    You don t even get a day off to 
                    move?

                                  STAN
                    We got a shitstorm brewing.  Looks 
                    like I ll be working seven day 
                    weeks for the foreseeable future.

      Philip leads Stan down the hall.  Philip opens the inside 
      door and goes into...



      ...the garage.  Stan follows him in.  Stan sees the maroon 
      Monte Carlo, sees the hood of the car is up.

                                  STAN
                    Car trouble?                                                                                    50.


                                  PHILIP
                    Nothing major, cracked PCV hose.

      Philip walks around to the trunk.  Stan stays by the front of 
    the car.

                                  STAN
                    Monte Carlo, huh?   77?

                                  PHILIP
                      Four-barrel V8, hundred-and-eighty 
                      horsepower.

      Philip opens the trunk.  Timoshev LOOKS UP AT HIM.

      Stan bends down slightly, checking out the license plate.  
    Not really suspicious, just instinct when there s an APB out 
    for a  77 dark red Monte Carlo.  He sees the VIRGINIA PLATES.

      Philip looks around the trunk for his jumper cables.

                                  STAN
                    GM s biggest seller last two years.

                                  PHILIP
                    Great car.

      Philip looks Timoshev in the eye, almost as if he suspects 
    him of having done something with the jumper cables.

                                  STAN
                    Not tempted by one of those 
                    Japanese upstarts?

                                  PHILIP
                    I don t think I could fit in one.

      Stan starts to WALK TOWARD PHILIP at the back of the car.

      Philip bends down and SWEEPS HIS HAND UNDER Timoshev.

      Stan is almost at the back of the car.

      Philip PULLS HIS HAND OUT from under Timoshev -- he s got the 
      JUMPER CABLES.

      Philip stands up straight.

      Stan is at the rear window of the car, still coming -- he s 
      raising his arm for the cables --

      Philip closes the trunk, gently.  

    He holds the cables out.  Stan takes them.                                                                                    51.


                                  STAN
                    Thanks.

                                  PHILIP
                    You bet.

      Stan smiles -- Philip smiles back -- they each wait for the 
      other one to stop smiling and look away, but neither of them 
      does -- it gets weird -- Philip s testing, wondering if Stan 
      knows something, if he ll say something -- Stan doesn t know 
      what s going on, but it s a contest now -- finally...

                                  STAN
                    Well, I gotta get back.

      Stan glances down at the rear fender -- no bumper stickers.

    Off Stan, acting like he wasn t even looking...


      I/E. CAR - NIGHT

      Stan and Agent Mizzi sit in a 1980 AMC STATION WAGON. They 
      look through binoculars at the front gate of a compound -- a 
      placard on the gate reads EMBASSY OF THE UNION OF SOVIET 
      SOCIALIST REPUBLICS. A man comes out of the gate.

                                  STAN
                    Who s that?

                                  AGENT MIZZI
                    Second Secretary in the political 
                    section. He s legit.

                                  STAN
                    I can t believe we can t just bust 
                    in and search the place.  It s our 
                    fucking country.

                                  AGENT MIZZI
                    No, it isn t. That s Soviet 
                    territory you re looking at.  
                    Timoshev isn t in there anyway, 
                    they wouldn t bring him inside just 
                    to sneak him right back out again.    

      A VERY WIDE MAN comes out of the embassy.

                                  AGENT MIZZI (CONT D)
                    Grabatinsky.   Cultural Attache.   
                    He sKGB.
                          (into two-way radio)
                    Two green.                                                                                    52.


                                  STAN
                    Not a guy you d wanna meet in a 
                    dark alley.

      A BLACK SOVIET LADA SEDAN WITH DIPLOMATIC PLATES pulls up in 
      front of the embassy and Grabatinsky gets in.

                                  AGENT MIZZI
                          (into radio)
                    South on Tunlaw.

      Stan pulls away from the curb, but instead of following the 
    car with Grabatinsky, he turns onto another street.

                                  MALE VOICE ON RADIO
                    South on Tunlaw, West on Calvert.

                                  AGENT MIZZI
                    Go left here, we ve got six cars, 
                    we should pick him up off Mass Ave.  
                    Timoshev used to say --

                                  FEMALE VOICE ON RADIO
                    Pick up Calvert North on Wisconsin.

                                  AGENT MIZZI
                    -- we spend all our time worrying 
                    about KGB officers working out of 
                    the embassy like this galoofas, but 
                    all they really do is handle the

      Stan turns.

    The Black Lada turns into a MCDONALDS.

                    Shit.

                    They don t have it in Russia.



      Philip and Henry sit in traffic on the Beltway in the rented 
      Mustang. Henry wears a Baltimore Orioles cap.

                                  HENRY
                    Can we get a racing stripe on the 
                    Monte Carlo?

                                  PHILIP
                    Your mom wouldn t like that.

                                  HENRY
                    Why not?

                                  PHILIP
                    She doesn t like...new things.



      Philip and Henry sit in the bleachers watching a Baltimore 
      Orioles baseball game. They ve both got hot dogs.                                                                                     54.


      PHILIP s POV: the lush green field, the low buzz of the fans, 
      a CLACK as a ball is hit -- everything CALM and PEACEFUL -- 
      turning to see HENRY watching the game, the boy absorbed, a 
      healthy, happy-looking kid...

    We PULL BACK out of his POV to see Philip, deep in thought...



      Philip and Henry stand in a crowd around a player who s 
      signing autographs. The player waves to the fans and 
      disappears into the dugout. Philip looks down at Henry, who s 
      crushed he didn t get an autograph.



      Philip and Henry buckle up. Philip turns to Henry, sees how 
      disappointed he is...

                                  PHILIP
                    Wait here.



      ...the stadium. He walks down a corridor, turns -- there s a 
      SECURITY GUARD ten feet in front of him. Without breaking 
      stride, Philip puts his hand out --

                                  PHILIP
                    Special Assistant to the V.P. for 
                    Facilities Management, I need to 
                    borrow your radio.

    You can hardly tell if Philip takes the walkie-talkie from 
    the guard or if the guard hands it to him. Philip turns down 
      another corridor, follows the sound of voices, turns into...



      ...the locker room. Half the team is still in there, some of 
      them talking to reporters.                                                                                     55.


      Philip walks straight through the room, holding the walkie-
      talkie as cover -- a few players glance up at him -- he heads 
    for the showers -- right before he gets there, his left hand 
      darts out and grabs A MITT from the upper shelf of a locker. 
      Because he s looking and moving in a different direction from 
      where his hand goes, the move is virtually unnoticeable. The 
      mitt is inside his jacket, pressed under his arm, as he goes 
      into the showers. 

    He stops at a sink, pulls open a METAL SOAP dispenser on the 
      wall, and yanks out the PLASTIC SOAP JUG inside. He goes back 
    out to the locker area, holding the soap jug up to his nose.

                                  PHILIP
                          (lips to walkie-talkie)
                    I got it, smells fine to me.

    He walks out into the...



      ...corridor. He drops the soap jug in a trash can, keeps 
      going down the hallways. When he gets to the security guard, 
    he hands him his radio.



      Philip gets in. He hands Henry the mitt.

                                  PHILIP
                    I couldn t find Murray, but I ran 
                    into Belanger. He wanted you to 
                    have this.

      Henry s eyes light up. Off Philip as he pulls out of the 
      parking spot, smiling...



      Henry lies in bed in pajamas, his new MITT on his hand. 
      Elizabeth sits next to him.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    And the daddy elephant said, let s 
                    just take our family and go over to 
                    the mean herd of elephants, they ll 
                    give us everything we want. And the 
                    mommy elephant said --                                                                                    56.


                                  HENRY
                    This is a story for, like, a four-
                    year-old.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Just wait, it gets better. And --



      Philip, coming in from the hallway, closes the door to the 
      garage quietly behind him. He goes to the front of the Monte 
      Carlo and --

      CLOSE-UP on a ROLL OF DUCT TAPE, a SCISSORS, and a DIXIE CUP 
    OF WATER sitting on the ENGINE. STRANDS OF COPPER WIRE snake 
      through the transmission.

                                  PHILIP
                    Damn it, Elizabeth.

      Philip, MOVING FAST, goes to the back of the car and opens 
    the trunk. 

      Timoshev LOOKS UP AT HIM.  

      Philip takes out a knife and cuts the straps and ropes tying 
      down Timoshev.  He DOES NOT take off the handcuffs.

      Philip HOISTS TIMOSHEV out of the trunk and leans him against 
    the back of the car.  He unbuckles the wire mouthguard and 
      pulls it away from Timoshev s mouth.

                                  PHILIP (CONT D)
                    Listen --

      Timoshev SPITS PIECES OF CHEWED UP RUBBER IN PHILIP S FACE 
    AND LUNGES AT HIS THROAT WITH HIS TEETH BARED. He CLAMPS DOWN 
    on Philip s throat with his TEETH.  

      Philip JAMS FINGERS in BOTH of Timoshev s EYES and PRIES him 
    off his THROAT. 

      Timoshev KICKS at PHILIP s KNEE -- Philip BLOCKS the kick 
      with HIS FOOT and SHOVES Timoshev in the chest, knocking him 
      BACK INTO THE TRUNK.

                                  PHILIP (CONT D)
                    Oh, you re such a fucking pain in 
                    the ass! Stop! I m making a deal!

      Philip s neck is bleeding from TWO DEEP BITE MARKS.                                                                                    57.


                                  TIMOSHEV
                    Ah, good, good!  

      Philip pulls Timoshev out of the trunk again -- a little 
      rougher this time.  As he takes off Timoshev s handcuffs...

                                  PHILIP
                    Come on, we haven t got much time.

      Philip and Timoshev head for the garage door when --

    The DOOR TO THE HOUSE OPENS. Philip and Timoshev turn around. 
      ELIZABETH comes into the garage, closing the door behind her.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    What s going on?

                                  PHILIP
                    I m taking him to our neighbor.

    She comes up to them.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    You are?

                                  PHILIP
                    I was gonna drive him out, hand him 
                    off further from home, but you seem 
                    to have disabled the car.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    So you were leaving me.

                                  PHILIP
                    No. I m gonna make a deal that you 
                    don t have to talk to the Americans 
                    if you don t want to. If you feel 
                    that would make you a traitor. But 
                    you ll come with me and the kids. 
                    It won t be exactly what you want, 
                    but you ll adjust.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    So you re just deciding, for both 
                    of us.

      Timoshev takes a little sidestep toward the garage door. 
      Elizabeth sidesteps and cuts him off.

                                  PHILIP
                    Somebody had to make a decision.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Why you?                                                                                    58.


                                  PHILIP
                    Why not?

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Because I am a KGB officer! Don t 
                    you understand that, after all 
                    these years? I would go to jail, I 
                    would die -- I would lose 
                    everything before I would betray my 
                    country.

                                  PHILIP
                    Elizabeth --

                                  ELIZABETH
                    I m finishing this.

      Elizabeth moves towards Timoshev. He PUTS HIS HANDS UP and 
    she KICKS RIGHT THROUGH THEM into his chest.

      Timoshev and Elizabeth trade QUICK, HARD blows. 

                                  PHILIP
                          (exasperated, more to 
                            himself)
                    Damn it, Elizabeth.

      Elizabeth fakes with her left and hits Timoshev with a 
      vicious right elbow -- the same move she was practicing as an 
      18-year-old the night he raped her. This time she s faster 
    and stronger than him, and the blow sends him FLYING into the 
      garage door.

      Timoshev crumples to the floor. With great effort, he pushes 
      himself to his knees, then staggers to his feet.

                                  TIMOSHEV
                    I m sorry. I didn t mean to hurt 
                    you. They let us have our way with 
                    the cadets, it was part of the job. 
                    A perk. Forgive me, please.

                                  PHILIP
                    What s he talking about?
                          (to Timoshev)
                    What are you talking about? How did 
                    you hurt her? 

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Do what you want with him. Take him 
                    to the Americans, if that s what 
                    you want.                                                                                    59.


      Elizabeth turns and walks towards the inside door to the 
      house.

      Philip GRABS Timoshev s throat, LIFTS him in the air and 
      SHOVES him against the garage door. He SQUEEZES -- there s a 
      loud CRACK as Timoshev s windpipe SNAPS.

      Elizabeth turns back around. 

      With one hand still on Timoshev s throat, Philip grabs him at 
    the waist, turns him sideways, and THROWS his dead body into 
    the trunk of the Monte Carlo.

    He SLAMS the trunk shut.

    Off Philip and Elizabeth, staring at each other...

                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    60.


                                      ACT FOUR



      Philip and Elizabeth drive in the Monte Carlo. Elizabeth is 
    cut and bruised from her fight with Timoshev.

      Elizabeth turns on the radio.  Lookin  For Love  from Urban 
      Cowboy comes on:

      I spent a lifetime lookin for you                       
      Single bars and good-time lovers were never true         
      Playin  a fools game hoping to win                     
      Telling those sweet lies and losin  again

    Off Philip and Elizabeth, staring out the windshield...



      Elizabeth sits on the toilet, Philip sits on a stool next to 
      her.                                                                                     61.


    He uses his right index finger to apply tiny dabs of make-up 
    to her cuts and smooth them out with great delicacy -- he s 
      already rendered most of the cuts completely invisible -- 
      another piece of tradecraft he s expert at.

    He finishes, examines her, nods. She looks at his neck.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Too deep to hide.

    She puts two small bandages on his BITE-MARKS. As she 
      finishes, they hear the SOUND of a DOOR OPENING, then 
      FOOTSTEPS in the hall, then FOOTSTEPS moving FAST DOWN THE 
      STAIRS.

                                  PHILIP
                    We ll have to get the trunk later.



    The Jennings family sits at breakfast.

                                  HENRY
                    Terry can t throw a curve, which 
                    means he ll probably only get two 
                    or three strike-outs the whole 
                    game. The outfield s gonna be busy.

    The phone rings. Elizabeth gets up and answers it.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Hello?

    She listens for a few seconds, then hangs up. Philip sees the 
      look in her eyes. He comes over to the sink with some dirty 
      dishes, turns on the faucet.

                                  ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                          (sotto)
                    Emergency signal for tonight. 
                    You ll never believe who s here.


      I/E. CAR - DAY

      Philip and Henry pull out of the driveway in the rented 
      Mustang. Henry is in a little league uniform.

      Stan comes down the sidewalk.  Philip rolls down his window.

                                  PHILIP
                    We re going by Ballston.  Need a 
                    lift?                                                                                    62.


                                  STAN
                    No, thanks.  What happened to your 
                    neck?

                                  PHILIP
                    Shaving.

                                  STAN
                          (indicating two band-aids)
                    Twice?  You re a butcher.

                                  PHILIP
                    Gotta change my blades more.

                                  STAN
                          (to Henry)
                    Get your dad an electric razor next 
                    Christmas.

      Philip and Henry drive away.  Off Stan, watching them go, 
      just the tiniest hint of suspicion...



      Elizabeth stands over the open trunk of the Monte Carlo with 
      a RAG, a TWEEZERS, and a SPRAY CAN OF SOLVENT.  The trunk 
      looks like a kidnap victim has been in there recently -- 
      there are BLOOD STAINS, TANGLES OF MATTED HAIR, the STRAPS 
    and ROPES that were used to tie Timoshev down, the WIRE 
      MOUTHGUARD.

      Just as Elizabeth starts to clean --

                                  PAIGE
                          (O.S.)
                    Mom?  Let s go.

      Elizabeth, irritated, closes the trunk.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Coming!

    She puts the cleaning supplies in a cabinet and walks back 
      into the house.



      Paige stands in front of a painting of a young, innocent-
      looking girl in a white sundress and a straw hat. She senses 
      something and turns around -- across the gallery, a well-
      dressed man in his thirties smiles at her. 

      Paige turns back around. She undoes one of the buttons on her 
      blouse. She turns back around to look at the man -- their 
      EYES MEET.

      Elizabeth turns into the gallery and sees Paige and the man 
      looking at each other. Elizabeth heads straight for the man 
      with murder in her eyes.  She s almost to him when --

    -- a woman the man s own age turns into the gallery and comes 
    up to him. Elizabeth veers off and heads towards Paige.

    The man and the woman exit the gallery together.

      Elizabeth goes up to Paige.  She buttons up Paige s blouse.



      Elizabeth and Paige sit next to each other on the train.  

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Do you like that boy who just moved 
                    in, Matthew?

                                  PAIGE
                    He won t like me.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Why not?

                                  PAIGE
                    Boys my age don t like me, mom.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    I m sure they do.

                                  PAIGE
                    I m sure they don t.                                                                                    64.


                                  ELIZABETH
                    Paige, you just have to believe in 
                    yourself.

                                  PAIGE
                    Do you really think those words 
                    mean anything, mom?

                                  ELIZABETH
                    I know they do. Listen to me, 
                    Paige. Your life isn t supposed to 
                    be easy. Everyone runs around 
                    acting like they live in a fairy 
                    tale, but...things happen to 
                    people. You have to be prepared, to 
                    be a person who can live anywhere, 
                    who can deal with any situation. 
                    That s how I ve always known you 
                    and Henry would be alright, no 
                    matter what, because I d raise you 
                    to be strong, tough, confident 
                    people.

                                  PAIGE
                    But I m not any of those things.

      Elizabeth stops -- she looks at Paige for a long time.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Not yet, dear. Not yet.



    Two subway trains hurtle past each other in the dark tunnel. 
      Through the windows, we see inside -- in one, Elizabeth and 
      Paige sit next to each other -- in the other train, going the 
      opposite direction, Philip sits alone...



      ...a crowded Fern Bar.  He goes up to the bar.

                                  PHILIP
                    What do you have on tap?                                                                                    65.


                                  BARTENDER
                    Bud, Michelob, Miller --

      Philip stares intently at the bartender, making sure the guy 
      really sees him.

                                  PHILIP
                    Gimme a Bud, I ll be back in a sec.

      Philip goes to the back of the bar and into the...



      ...bathroom. He goes into a stall.  He unzips his bag.  

      CLOSE-UP on his FACE as he puts on a false moustache and 
      beard, slicks back his hair with Brylcreem, and lengthens and 
      darkens his eyebrows with an eyebrow pencil.  

      CLOSE-UP on his FEET -- he pulls off the COWBOY BOOTS he s 
      wearing (the one s he was trying on at the mall) and puts on 
      a pair of PLAIN BLACK SHOES.  

      CLOSE-UP on his BAG -- he takes A LEATHER bag out of the gym 
      bag, and puts the gym bag and the cowboy boots into the 
      leather bag.



      PHILIP S POV:

      ...as he exits the bathroom into the crowded bar -- he 
      approaches the same spot at the bar where he was before -- 
    THE BEER he ordered is there waiting.

    The bartender comes over, looks straight at him -- no sign of 
      recognition.

                                  PHILIP
                    What do you have on tap?

                                  BARTENDER
                    Bud, Michelob, Miller --

    In the mirror behind the bar, Philip sees himself -- this is 
    the first full look we get of him in disguise, he doesn t 
      look like Philip OR the guy who met his agent MARTHA 
      previously -- A LITTLE SMILE, the one that means he s having 
      fun, spreads across Philip s face.

                                  PHILIP
                    Whose beer is this?                                                                                    66.


                                  BARTENDER
                    Some guy.

    END PHILIP S POV



      Philip, in disguise, rides the train.



      POV: Coming up a stairwell, scanning left to right, up and 
      down -- pausing for a second at the top of the stairs, 
      looking both ways down the empty hallway -- and turning 
      down...



      ...the hallway. Carpeting, walls painted green, everything 
      well-kept up, not fancy but not run-down. Vision shifts to a 
      door on the right -- key goes into the lock, door opens.

      Inside, A MAN sits on a couch. ROTATE 180 degrees, close the 
      door, turn back around, the man on the couch -- 

    -- GREY HAIR, DISTINGUISHED, RUGGED -- 

                                  MAN
                    It has been a long time.

    END POV

    And now we see what the man on the couch sees, which is:

      ELIZABETH, standing in front of the door.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    General Zhukov.

      Elizabeth sits down in a chair across from the General.

                                  GENERAL ZHUKOV
                    I am sorry to call your home.  With 
                    the FBI on top of us in this 
                    manner, I felt it was better than 
                    trying to leave a signal for you.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    How did you arrive?

                                  GENERAL ZHUKOV
                    A little boat.  The underwater 
                    kind.
                          (beat)
                    The traitor?                                                                                    68.


                                  ELIZABETH
                    He no longer exists.

                                  GENERAL ZHUKOV
                    What happened?  

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Our comrade was injured in the 
                    operation, we took him to the 
                    hospital.

                                  GENERAL ZHUKOV
                    And missed the hand-off.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    We couldn t let him die in the 
                    backseat of the car. I regret to 
                    inform you that he died anyway.

                                  GENERAL ZHUKOV
                    He is a hero. We will need more of 
                    those now.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    What do you mean, General?

                                  GENERAL ZHUKOV
                    The American people, in their 
                    infinite wisdom, have elected a 
                    madman as their President.  The 
                     Evil Empire,  he calls us.  He  is 
                    building up their armies, building 
                    up their weapons programs, in a way 
                    we ve never seen before.  Our war 
                    is not so cold anymore.  What 
                    happens behind enemy lines will 
                    determine the outcome of this 
                    struggle, Elizabeth.  Our officers 
                    in the embassy are useless.  Only 
                      Directorate S will be able to fully 
                    engage the enemy here.  It is, in 
                    truth, what we expected to happen.  
                    That it would be up to us one day. 
                    So -- the day has come.   

      Zhukov closes his eyes, concentrates, opens them again...

                                  GENERAL ZHUKOV (CONT D)
                          (formal)
                    The Politburo assesses the threat 
                    as severe and initiates all active 
                    measures to counter the threat of 
                    the American imperialists.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    69.

                                  GENERAL ZHUKOV (CONT D)
                    All capabilities will be utilized 
                    to thwart the aggressors in their 
                    plans to destabilize and destroy 
                    the motherland.  

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Very well, Comrade General.

      Zhukov looks at Elizabeth -- she s almost expressionless, and 
    yet he picks up that something is troubling her.

                                  GENERAL ZHUKOV
                    Your strategic objective, of 
                    course, has not changed. To defend 
                    the motherland against threats 
                      originating in the United States. 
                    No one in the leadership wishes to 
                    destroyAmerica. On the contrary, 
                    when our work is done, it will be a 
                    better place. Hopefully a Socialist 
                    paradise, but that will take some 
                    time, yes? 
                          (Zhukov smiles)
                    We know your children live here, 
                    Elizabeth. So do many decent, hard-
                    working Americans. We have all of 
                    their interests at heart.  

      Zhukov looks carefully into Elizabeth s eyes to make sure 
      he s said what she needs to hear.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Thank you, Comrade General.

    He sees that he got it, but then he squints...

                                  GENERAL ZHUKOV
                    You are wearing make-up to cover 
                    injuries.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    There was a fight.

                                  GENERAL ZHUKOV
                    They are new injuries. You subdued 
                    him several days ago.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    He was a traitor, General.

      Zhukov hesitates, then nods.

    Off Elizabeth, still almost no expression on her face...                                                                                    70.



      Agents move purposefully around the outer-office.  

      Philip s agent Martha, who he met with the other night, sits 
      typing at a desk.  As SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE MARK 
      BARTHOLOMEW walks past her, she holds up a folder, and he 
      grabs it.  He keeps walking into...



      ...a secure inner-office.  

      Seven agents sit around a conference table, including Stan 
    and Agent Mizzi.  Agent Bartholomew sits down.

                                  AGENT BARTHOLOMEW
                    Our deceased John Doe from 
                    Arlington Methodist is proving very 
                    difficult to track down.  Either he 
                    was a KGB Directorate S Officer who 
                    got killed while he was kidnapping 
                    Timoshev, or he s a drifter who got 
                    stabbed in a fight in Arlington.  
                    His picture s out to every police 
                    department in the country, but it s 
                    a needle in a --

                                  MAN
                    Don t say haystack.

    The man who said this walks into the vault, AN ASSISTANT 
      trailing behind him - the assistant is THE PASTY BUREAUCRAT 
    WHO ELIZABETH SEDUCED IN THE TEASER.  Everyone in the room 
      JUMPS TO THEIR FEET.

                                  AGENT BARTHOLOMEW
                    Mr. Deputy Attorney General.

    The Deputy Attorney General sits down at the table.

                                  DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL WARREN
                    The Attorney General and I just 
                    came from the White House.  
                    President Reagan is outraged that 
                    the KGB thinks it can kidnap 
                    someone with impunity on American 
                    soil.  We re going to hunt down 
                    whoever did this, arrest them, and 
                    put them in jail.

      Deputy Attorney General Warren turns to one of his 
      assistants, who hands him a document.                                                                                    71.


                                  DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL WARREN 
                                  (CONT D)
                          (reading, formal)
                    The President has signed Top Secret 
                    Executive Order Two-Five-Seven-
                    Nine, authorizing the Federal 
                    Bureau of Investigation 
                      CounterIntelligence Office to take 
                    all necessary measures to 
                    neutralize Soviet Directorate S 
                    sleeper cell agents in the 
                      continental United States.  

    The Deputy Attorney General looks up.

                                  DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL WARREN 
                                  (CONT D)
                    Ladies and gentlemen, this is an 
                    extraordinary time.  Your skills 
                    may have been under-utilized during 
                    the previous administration.  No 
                    longer.  We are going to war.  It 
                    is a war that will be fought 
                    quietly, by the men -- and the 
                    woman -- in this room.  It will not 
                    be short, and it will not be easy.  
                    But we have truth and justice on 
                    our side.  And we will prevail.



      Philip pours two shots of vodka, hands one to Elizabeth, then 
      sits down in bed next to her. They drink their shots.

      Elizabeth turns up the radio on the nightstand. They lie 
      down.  

                                  PHILIP
                    Why didn t you tell me about 
                    Timoshev?

                                  ELIZABETH
                    We aren t supposed to talk about 
                    our  other  lives.

                                  PHILIP
                    It wasn t really your  other  life, 
                    it happened in training. 

                                  ELIZABETH
                    It was a long time ago. I put it 
                    behind me.                                                                                    72.


    She puts her hand in his. 

                                  ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                    Things are about to change, Philip. 
                    It s going to get uglier. More 
                    dangerous.

                                  PHILIP
                    We ll be fine. Don t forget, we ve 
                    been doing this for a long time.

      They lie quietly for a moment.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    I was born in Smolensk.  My father 
                    died fighting the Nazis at 
                    Stalingrad when I was two.  There 
                    was a picture of him, in his 
                    uniform -- he was pale, with bushy 
                    eyebrows -- smiling, although of 
                    course he was going off to die. My 
                    mother was a bookkeeper for the 
                    local Party Committee.  My name is -
                    - was -- Nadezhda.

    Off their hands, clasped together in the middle of the bed...



      Philip and Elizabeth come into a motel room -- they re in 
      their EARLY-MID 20 S (three years after the last flashback). 
      They re sweaty and tired, both carrying luggage. Elizabeth 
      sits down on the bed.

                                  ELIZABETH
                          (no Russian accent now)
                    My God, the climate.

                                  PHILIP
                          (no Russian accent)
                    I think that s an air conditioner.

      Philip goes over to the window, studies the air conditioner 
    for a second, turns a knob. A MECHANICAL RACKET is followed 
    by a LOUD, STEADY RUSH OF AIR.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Is it cold air?

                                  PHILIP
                    Uh-huh.                                                                                    73.


      Philip spreads his arms out as the air rushes against him. He 
      throws his head back, closes his eyes...

      Elizabeth takes her shoes off and lays back on the bed. 

      Philip comes over to the other side of the bed, flops down on 
    top of the covers.

    He rolls over and straddles Elizabeth. He moves his face down 
      towards her. She turns her head away. 

                                  ELIZABETH
                    I m not ready.

                                  PHILIP
                    We re supposed to be married now. 
                    Have children, eventually. Maybe 
                    you don t find me attractive. 

      Philip waits, then shrugs and rolls back over.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    What do you think so far?

                                  PHILIP
                    So far?
                          (chuckles)
                    They tell you everything, 
                    but...then you see it. It s a 
                      little...brighter than I expected.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    There s a weakness in the people, I 
                    can feel it.

      They lie quietly.

                                  ELIZABETH (CONT D)
                    Let s modify the plan and go buy 
                    the car together in the morning. 
                    Then we can start looking for an 
                    apartment right away in the 
                    afternoon.

    Off their hands, next to each other on the bed, close, but 
    not touching...

    END FLASHBACK



      ...the garage.  Darkness.  A ball of REDDISH-WHITE LIGHT 
      appears -- a flashlight shining through Stan s hand.

      Stan lets a sliver of WHITE LIGHT out onto the hulk of 
      Philip s Monte Carlo.  He walks up to the car.  We see from 
    his face that he thinks he s acting half-crazy.

      Stan shines the flashlight through the rear side window into 
    the car.  He looks carefully at the back seat, then takes a 
      step forward and looks at the front seat.

    He walks in a circle around the car, shining the light along 
    the outside.  

    He comes back to the trunk.  He bends down, checks out the 
      LICENSE PLATE SCREWS -- all appropriately RUSTY and TIGHT.

      Stan takes a lock pick out of his pocket.  He goes to work on 
    the TRUNK LOCK.  After a few seconds, there s a CLICK.

      Stan quickly puts his hand on the trunk to keep it from 
      springing open.  He SLOWLY lets it up.  He SHINES the FULL 
      FLASHLIGHT BEAM inside the trunk -- EMPTY and CLEAN.

      Stan shakes his head.  Rolls his eyes.  I really am an ass.

    He goes back to the garage door. In the dim edges of his 
      flashlight beam, behind some mops and luggage, REVEAL --

      A SILENCER 

    -- pointed at Stan s head.

      Stan opens the garage door a few feet and slips under it. 
      Light from the street lamp outside filters into the garage 
    and we see, behind the silencer --

      PHILIP, holding the gun, stone-faced, as the door slides down 
    and the garage goes

      BLACK.

                                    END OF SHOW
