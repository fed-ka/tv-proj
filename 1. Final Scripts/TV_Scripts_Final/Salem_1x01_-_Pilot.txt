out by an equally leathery hand.  It could almost be a 
wedding ceremony, until we see their crudely SHAVED HEADS and 
IRON SHACKLES.  REVEAL -- 

EXT. SALEM - COMMON - NIGHT

The two teens are kneeling by heavy WOODEN STOCKS.  Standing 
before them are several black-clad men, the SELECTMEN of 
Salem.  Their leader, GEORGE SIBLEY, holds the bible.

BOY
I, Isaac Walton, have gazed upon 
the nakedness of Abigail Cooke.  
And did kiss her.

The boy mumbles incoherently.  Sibley slaps his face.

Sibley nods to the Bailiff.

as the Bailiff WHIPS the boy s naked back, sending flecks of 
flesh into the young faces forced to bear witness front and

And you, boy, shall bear the mark 
of your crime for the rest of your 
life.

Sibley pulls a heavy IRON BRAND from a grate of coals.  The 
Boy jerks back from the heat.  One of the Selectman, 
MAGISTRATE HALE, seems a less severe sort.  He shifts 
uncomfortably.

Sibley ignores him and presses down the brand.  The boy 
screams in agony as an F-shaped scar is seared onto his 
forehead.

SIBLEY

Fornicator!

He glares at the pale and frightened juveniles, until he sees 
one face staring daggers at him -- 

YOUNG JOHN ALDEN

is neither pale nor frightened.  His face burns with rage at 
Sibley -- who simply looks away with a righteous sneer. 

Alden turns to find MARY, 16, in the crowd.  It s clear they 
have a connection.  Alden gives Mary a pointed nod, some sort 
of signal.  She nods in return, tempting fate...

A shared look hints the two girls are friends as Mary 
disappears down the alleyway...

EXT. SALEM - COMMON - NIGHT

The two teens still hang in the stocks, shivering from the 
cold, covered in rotten eggs, fish, and human shit.  

YOUNG MARY crouches in the darkness.  The houses all dark 
except the enormous, seven-gabled SIBLEY MANSION.  

Sibley himself stands tall on the balcony, looking down over 
his town.  Satisfied, he disappears inside and Mary takes off 
through the shadows...

EXT. SALEM - GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

Mary cautiously enters the headstone forest, winged skulls, 
and other Puritan symbols of death.  She nearly screams when 
she's grabbed from behind --

It s Alden, who pulls her behind a large monument.  An urgent 
kiss between them, then Mary pushes him back.

ALDEN
Sorry to disappoint.  Not dead.  
Not a hero. 

EXT. SALEM - MAIN SQUARE - SHORT TIME LATER

Isaac s wagon rolls through Salem.  The once grim little port 
has blossomed into a colorful, prosperous chaos. 

Alden surveys all the ships lined up to unload, all the 
construction and rolling carts overflowing with goods -- and 
laughs a little bitterly.  Ten years of war have been kinder 
to Salem than they have to him.

But Alden is surprised -- and by the look of it, pleasantly -- 
by the color and chaos of the crowded, colonial melting pot 
his hometown has become.  

AT THE DEPOT

Alden notices a man wearing A PRIMITIVE SANDWICH BOARD 
covered in the latest one-sheet sensations -- the original 
Tabloid newspapers -- a few bold words and a crude woodcut: 

-- One headline: MERCY!  Above a disturbing drawing of a girl 
with her head turned wrong-way round, clinging to a ceiling 
like a spider. 

-- Another headline screams: BLACK SABBATH! and shows a man 
and a woman kneeling and kissing the exposed ass of a 
monstrous Devil.

Alden watches the walking tabloid wobble through the throng, 
collecting pennies and distributing the one-sheets in return.

ALDEN
(to no-one in particular)
Hardly recognize the place.

While behind him, Anne Hale watches him.  Paying close 
attention to his broad shoulders and strong ass. MALICE Pilot - "The Vow" 5/2/1310.


ANNE

the new Salem --

Mrs. Hale yanks her daughter along before she can finish.  

EXT. SALEM - ALLEYWAY - LATER

Alden carries his old deerskin bag, behind a row of houses.  
He stops at the very one where we saw Young Mary sneak out 
for their secret rendezvous.  The back door flies open, and 
 face lights up --for a moment Alden s

-- but he steps back quickly to avoid the bucket of slop that 
a servant tosses out the back door.

ALDEN
Does Mary Walcot still live here?

The door slams shut.

EXT./INT. ALDEN FARM HOUSE - DAY

Alden walks up to the porch of an old shuttered house at the 
 only tied shut, so Alden cuts it top of a hill.  The door s
open and enters.

Sheets cover the furniture.  Sheets of dust cover the sheets.  
Alden opens a window to let in the air and light then walks 
back out to the porch --

-- and straight into the black hole of a Matchlock rifle big 
enough to down a bear.

GILES (O.S.)
Come on.  One more step.  Save me 
the trouble of aiming.

Alden steps out to face GILES COREY, 65.  He has a half a 
dozen small woodland animals hung to various belts on him, 
and a bloody burlap bag filled with heavier catch.

 BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHTINT. MARY S

Mary sits at a small table by the window, beside a glass  
bowl filled with water and floating carnations.  Her 
 beautiful, stoic face is streaked by tears -- a decade s
worth of pain resurfacing.

And as that pain resurfaces, we see a strange thing: the 
vivid red and white carnations floating in the water beside 
her begin to wither and rot. 

And as her emotions rise, the water in the pool begins to 
ripple, and the bowl itself vibrates until the glass 
EXPLODES.  Mary rips a chain from around her neck and throws 
it across the room. 

Her servant silently bends to collect the chain, at the end

Moving past the gravestones -- stopping finally before a wide 
stone with twin sets of stone wings and two names:

John and Sarah Alden.  

Born in the County of Essex in England and died in the town 
of Salem, Massachusetts.  Alden bends down over his parents

All eyes in the market on Mercy, with a rope around her 
waist, the other end held by Cotton.  Mercy looks around at 
her former friends and neighbors.  And they instinctively 
shrink back from her.  Her taut, rigid face almost smiles at 
the power.  We see flies crawling on and around her mouth.

own neck, she SCREAMS an inhuman screech and walks as rapidly 
as her contorted and constricting limbs will allow -- toward 
a booth where still-bloody furs hang from a wooden frame. 

Mercy falls to her knees and begins to convulse, shoves her 
fingers in her mouth and bites down hard.  

Before Cotton can stop her, she chews off the tip of her 
little finger and SPITS it out -- hitting a man in his back.  
She screams again and now the crowd is screaming too.  

She points at the man.  Every eye in the place turns to look 
at the owner of the stall, the man at whose very feet Mercy 
has fallen:

Alden takes a last look back at the town he once planned to

Tituba applies a salve to Mary's soft skin and daubs her lips

Tituba removes a rounded piece of wood from a velvet bag.  
Like a thick, short broom handle, polished smooth with years 
of rubbing with oils.  We don't see what Tituba does with 
this stick -- but it sends ripples of pleasure through Mary. 

Her entire body seems to be alight by a charge through her 
 movements, spine.  Her back arches in response to Tituba s
her eyes roll back, her hair is visibly blown back by an 
unseen wind -- 

And at the peak of this orgasmic movement, in mid-writhe on

reach out all around them to touch and connect with the 
others, coupling, now tripling and beyond...

...and as the slippery bodies intertwine, the warm, viscous, 
velvet black fluid is rising around them, making their 
sliding and thrusting, their penetrations and tangles, all 
 the wetter in the flickering, shiny darkness.  Until, it s
impossible to tell where one body ends and another begins. 

As Alden peers into this erotic vortex it takes all his will 
not to fall in.  From the wet, sex-soaked black pit, eerie 
whispers rise:

CHANTING VOICES
Walpurgisnacht.  Pestilentia.  
Maleficarium.  Cruor Innocentia...

And as the words rise, so rise THIRTEEN WITCHES, male and 
female, all naked and dripping with black ichor.  Each wears 
a SEVERED ANIMAL HEAD -- wolf, stag, pig, etc.  

Just as Mercy Lewis described.  

Twelve of them have hands all joined in the middle, all 
holding something together.  And though they all drip with 
the black ichor they rose from, the thing which they hold is 
spotless -- a large WHITE DOVE.  Wings spread by twelve of 
the witches.  Its little heart visibly beating beneath the 
white feathers.

The thirteenth witch -- her beautiful body dripping black, 
face masked by the head of a Stag -- presses a long, sharp 
fingernail into the breast of the white bird. 

Until with a spurt of red on white, the nail suddenly

CUT TO:

EXT. SIBLEY MANSION - NIGHT

Candlelight shines from the master bedroom.

 BEDROOM - CONTINUOUSINT. MARY S

A fine glass cake top -- the very one Mary was holding at the 
market -- sits on her small dressing table.  Only it doesn t 
hold a cake, but a mouse, a bird, and several black beetles.  
All very much alive.  Small glass bowls contain oils, wax, 
deep-hued powders.  

And, most curiously, all this is arrayed around a small pile 
of sawdust and several thick strands of hair in the very 
center of the table.

Mary sits before this weird array HUMMING almost inaudibly.  
As her humming rises, the sawdust on the table begins to 
vibrate, as though reacting to her voice.

Mary spits thickly into the pile of dust and hair.  She bends 
low over the table and blows ever-so-gently into the 
disgusting pile.  With a curious, almost whistling sound the 
wet dust and hair seem to CONGEAL.

Mary reaches beneath the glass top and snatches up the little 
mouse, feeling its softness and its rapid pulse in her hand 
before she crushes it in her fist and lets its liquefied 
essence drip onto the congeal on the desk.MALICE Pilot - "The Vow" 5/2/1360.


She follows this with sprinkle of fresh-crushed beetles. 

Mary wipes her hands and takes up needle and thread.  Only 
the bird remains under the glass.  It flutters its wings with 
concern.  Mary uses the horrid mixture of dust and hair and 
spit and dead things as the stuffing for a homespun DOLL.

She sews up the button-eyed doll, humming quietly, stitch by 
stitch...

INT. LEWIS HOUSE - A BEAT LATER

Alden ascends the stairs behind Cotton.  A candle on the wall 
spreads flickering shadows like distorted faces watching 
them.  Inhuman moans and creaks echo from a door down the 
hallway.

Don't you see?  They got here just 
as we did.  Probably on the very

 BEDROOM - CONTINUOUSINT. MERCY S

Alden stares in silent horror at Mercy Lewis tied to the 
bedposts -- her body LEVITATING off the sheets.  

Cotton waves Alden to come closer.  Against the strong 
opinion of every muscle in his body, Alden complies.  

COTTON

his strength to push her back down to the bed.  To no avail.

 BEDROOM - NIGHTINT. ANNE S

Anne at her sketchbook, draws by candlelight a rather fine 
impression of the rather fine profile of Captain John Alden.  

She s seated on her bed, a small pile of childhood dolls and 
stuffed animals behind her.  But the candlelight through her 
sheer gown shows she s far from a little girl.

Her door CREAKS open a bit -- with a hint of movement as

She turns to shoo the cat off the bed, but there is no cat 
there.  She looks about the room --

Then shrugs it off.  As she returns to her drawing we see 
behind her a new addition to the pile: the Button Eyed Doll

ahead, creepy in their deadness.
