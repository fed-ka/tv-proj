      Early morning.  A grand turn-of-the-century Victorian high on 
      a hill in Pacific Heights, San Francisco.  A beautiful 
      combination of old and new; art and high-tech gadgets abound.  
      But tonight architectural charm has been compromised by a 
      break-in.  The place appears mostly intact, but BFS TECHS are 
      already at work collecting forensic evidence. 

      JANE, LISBON, and RIGSBY are escorted through the photo 
      covered foyer by SFPD INSPECTOR COLLEEN MULVEY, 30 s.

      ANGLE: Jane eyes assorted collectibles in the house -- an oil 
      painting, an antique vase, a new bag of golf clubs resting in 
      the corner.  Nothing taken.  

                                  LISBON
                    Mind running it for us, Inspector?

                                  MULVEY
                          (a tad sulky)
                    Not sure why you all were called 
                    in.  We could handle it.  Place 
                    belongs to Jason Sands.  Investment 
                    banker.  Big-ass political 
                      contributor.

                                  LISBON
                    That s why we were called in. 
                    Attorney General likes to stay on 
                    top of this kind of thing.  But 
                    hey, if you like political hot 
                    potatoes, I ll be happy to call the 
                    boss, tell him SFPD wants it. 

      Mulvey gives Lisbon a sardonic beat.

                                  MULVEY
                    Mister Sands  wife Jennifer comes 
                    home with their daughter about nine 
                    o clock last night.  She finds her 
                    husband gone.  And this...   

      Mulvey leads the CBI team into...         THE MENTALIST     "Ladies in Red"     CHERRY 8/06/08      2.



      Classic masculine decor -- leather seats, oak desk.  The room 
      is covered with President s Cup and sailing memorabilia.  
      Papers are strewn throughout, drawers open and things knocked 
      over.  A big bloodstain mars the carpet and a heavy chair is 
      tipped over.  

                                  MULVEY
                    There s been no ransom demand yet, 
                    but I expect we ll get something 
                    soon.  If you want our tech guys to 
                    set taps I got to let them know...   

                                  LISBON
                    That s okay.  We can handle it.  
                    Where s his family now?

                                  MULVEY
                    With friends.  Mrs. Sands thought 
                    it was best for the little girl and 
                    we agreed.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    Any sign of forced entry?

                                  MULVEY
                    Nope.  Must have been a front door 
                    job.  Posing as a courier or what 
                    have you.  

      We re looking closer at the room now -- from Jane s POV:       
      Lying on the floor near the overturned chair is a SIMPLE 
      REMOTE CONTROL UNIT, WITH A 123 KEYPAD with bloody handprints 
      on it.   Jane s focus lands on one specific sheet of paper 
      wedged partially under a wall unit bookcase. 

                                  JANE 
                    He s still here.

                                  MULVEY
                          (eyeing his tag)
                    Uh, not unless he s invisible he s 
                    not, Agent Jane.   

                                  LISBON
                    He s not an agent.  He s a 
                      consultant.

                                  JANE
                    No badge no gun, they won t even 
                    give me a dental plan.

      Mulvey looks at Jane, intrigued, but not in a good way.

                                  MULVEY
                    Oh.  Yeah.  You re the one they 
                    were telling me about... the

                    Well I m sorry, Gandalf, but we did 
                    look around pretty good in our 
                    bumbling way.  He s not here.

                                  JANE
                    He s here.  And there s no such 
                    thing as psychics.  They tortured 
                    him in this chair...

      He tilts the chair back up.  It sits at the center of the 
        bloodstains, picks up the remote control unit... 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    ...To give them a pass-code.

      Jane begins rapidly punching in the top ten pass-codes.  

                                  MULVEY 
                    Pass-code to what? 

      Jane points to the sheet of paper under the bookcase.

                                  JANE 
                    Would you humor me, Inspector 
                    Mulvey?  Would you try to pick up 
                    that sheet of paper? 

      Mulvey sees no reason not to, bends to pick it up, and the 
      paper tears in half, stuck under the bookcase.  Beat... as 
      everyone gathers the significance of that.

                                  MULVEY
                    The bookcase must have moved...

                                  LISBON
                    After these papers were scattered 
                    on the floor.

                    It s a door.  To a safe?

                    Or a safe room.

                    Yes.  

      He s still tapping away at the keypad.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    The intruder must have been 
                      distracted by something.

                    Sands punches in the code and

                    But, if there was a safe room,

                    Connected to a security company?

                    Not if you re the paranoid 
                    secretive type.  You make a safe 
                    room only you know about.    

      He s run thru his list of pass-codes.  Mulvey turns to a UNI.

                                  MULVEY

                    Hang on a second, Inspector.  

      ANGLE -- Jane looks around the room -- PHOTOS of Sands  wife, 
      JENNIFER, and 7-year-old daughter, JULIE.  PHOTOS of Sands 
      with sailing buddies.  Trophies for sailboat races.  Multiple 
      PICTURES of the boats he s raced, their numbers prominently 
      displayed on their sails... 24, 44, 37.

      He types in the corresponding digits on the sails and -- Clunk.  
      Doesn t work.  Keeps tapping in the numbers in various order...

      A man whose soft features and unkempt seventies mid-level 
      bureaucrat style contradict his position at CBI.  Minelli 
      must be damn good at his job because every other indicator 
      says he shouldn t be.

      Jane and Lisbon are taking the heat.  Lisbon is a martyr to 
      her authority figures.  Jane just lets Minelli roll off him 
      like water.

                                    MINELLI
                    I m disappointed I m very 
                      disappointed.  And embarrassed.
                    How could you do this to me?  
                    I told the mayor of San Francisco 
                    I was putting my best people on 
                    this. 
                          (in annoyance)

                    How you meant to know which is

      Minelli shrugs -- good idea -- and sets about doing as Jane

                    What kind of idiot drinks decaf

      Jane waits on a ridiculously big white sofa.  Julie peers in, 
      clutching a raggedy old doll.

                    Hello.

      Julie nods warily.  Stares at him a while.

                                  JULIE
                    Do you want to see my trolls?

                                  JANE
                    I d love to.


      Julie s room has a sweet fairy tale castle decor.  

      ANGLE -- A mobile hangs from a CRYSTAL CHANDELIER above.  As 
      the mobile turns, it plays a tinkly Frere Jacques...   

      Jane sits on a toy chest, admiring an array of trolls that 
      Julie produces one by one from a special box, using her doll 
      as a silent co-worker. 

                                  JULIE
                    ...And this one s a boy, his name

      Jane looks around to see that Jennifer is in the doorway, 
      trying to be strong for her girl and smile through grief and 
      worry.


      A Maid opens the door to reveal three burly men -- Repo Men, 
      led by a SHERIFF S DEPUTY -- who barge their way in and look 
      keenly around for valuables.  

                                  JENNIFER
                    What is this?  Who are you?

                    Asset seizure.  No trouble.

      He offers up an OFFICIAL DOCUMENT.  Jennifer is too stunned 
      to take it.

                    Start upstairs, boys.

      Jane flashes his ID badge and takes the document.

                    CBI Department of Justice.  Wait

                    Say? 

      Jane walks him discreetly away from Jennifer.

                                  JANE
                    Did they not tell you the score 
                    here?  You didn t get your shots?

                    Shots?  What are you talking about?

      Jane pulls up his sleeve quickly, points to the crook of his 
      arm as if showing him a shot, (though there s nothing there).

                                  JANE
                    Shots.  There was a murder here.

      The Repo Deputy is no fool and stares at Jane in disbelief.    
      Jane stares back, utter conviction on his face.  Jennifer 
      watches in BG with a poignantly vulnerable expression.


      Cho, Rigsby, and Van Pelt are going through stacks of 
      accounting ledgers and similar stuff ONSCREEN.  Jane gets 
      debriefed by Lisbon.

                                  LISBON
                    Sands was bust alright.  He used to 
                    be huge, but he made some very bad 
                    calls in IT.  Last five years, his 
                    business has dwindled away to 
                    nothing.  No clients.  No income.  
                    There were indictments and 
                      injunctions and the whole nightmare 
                    coming, just down the road.  

                                  CHO
                    Strange thing is, until a couple of 
                    weeks ago, there was ten million 
                    dollars in his personal accounts in 
                    cash and bonds and stocks.  Most of 
                    it deposited over the last year. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    His business is dead for years. 
                    Where did he get ten million from?

                                  VAN PELT 
                    More to the point, where is it now?  

                                  CHO
                    That s what his killers wanted to 
                    know.

                    No.  She s genuinely broke, looks 
                    like.  And genuinely scared.

                    She s a gorgeous grieving widow.  
                    Of course maybe a little.  It s not

      Cho and Lisbon step inside the rear cabin of the luxury boat.   
      The place has been completely trashed by someone on a very 
      thorough hunt.  Pillows torn up, bookshelves emptied...

      Cho and Lisbon silently draw their weapons and using hand 
      signals, they split up to search the place.

      Jane stays quietly by the door, so quietly that ADRIANNA 
      JONOVIC -- a tough Serbian stripper-type, but classy -- slips 
      in next to him, small revolver in hand.  She only starts a 
      little when she sees Jane.

                    Two years.  We were more than 
                    lovers.  We were engaged to be

                    A month ago.  Once he showed me

                    he hid them somewhere.  I don t

                                  JANE
                    It s a strong possibility.  

      Jennifer is cast down again.

                                  JENNIFER
                    Life is so complicated.

      Jennifer takes a long beat.

                    Patrick?  Will you hold me please?  
                    I need someone to hold me.

      Jane looks at her bleakly.

                                  JANE
                    I m sorry, Jennifer.  I wish I 
                    could.

      Mortified, Jennifer is frozen for a moment, then hurries out 
      and upstairs.  Jane takes a beat, then heads for the door.  
      Leaves without another word.  What s to say.


      Cho and Lisbon walk and talk.

                                  CHO
                    Our dealer Dieter Webb s 
                      grandmother is 93 and lives in a 
                    seniors  assisted living center in 
                    Tucson.  Has for a decade.  But... 

                                  LISBON
                    Let me guess.  She s leasing a high 
                    end vehicle and recently bought a 
                    nice house in Oakland. 

                                  CHO
                    You are good.


      Rigsby and Van Pelt sit in their car eyeing a big rundown 
      party house.  The lawn is brown.  A mint CADILLAC and 
      CORVETTE sit in the driveway.

      ANGLE -- A neighboring Mom tries to corral her Kids and get 
      them in the car.

      Rigsby and Van Pelt both wear Kevlar.  Van Pelt studies the 
      rap sheets of CARTER LEWIS and DIETER WEBB, both early 30 s, 
      sleazy white hipsters.  Rigsby looks around impatiently, 
      watches the Mom and her children across the way.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    Where s the entry team?  They were 
                    supposed to be here twenty minutes 
                    ago.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Relax.  It s not even noon.  
                    Way too early for guys like these 
                    to be awake.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    They could be up from the night 
                    before.  They might go out for 
                      breakfast.

                                  VAN PELT 
                    We can deal with them.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE MENTALIST     "Ladies in Red"     CHERRY 8/06/08      35.

                    Suddenly she s Steve McQueen. 

      Van Pelt laughs.  Suddenly --

      THEIR POV -- As WEBB and Lewis exit the house and head for 
      the Mercedes in the driveway.  One tosses the other the keys.

                                  RIGSBY (CONT D)
                    They re on the move.

                                  VAN PELT
                    C mon, let s take  em.  

      Just as the suspects climb into their car, Rigsby flips on 
      the SIREN, guns the engine and screeches to a halt blocking 
      them in.   

      ANGLE -- Van Pelt jumps out, shotgun in tow, rushes to the 
      passenger window and levels it at a dazed Carter Lewis. 

                                  VAN PELT (CONT D)
                    Police.  Hands where I can see 
                    them!

      NEW ANGLE -- Dieter Webb decides to run.  He leaps from the 
      driver s side and bolts across the yard.  Rigsby gives chase.  
      Both men race through a sprinkler.  Dieter finds he is in a 
      dead end, fails to scale a wire fence, and is tackled by 
      Rigsby with great force.  As Dieter moans in pain, Rigsby 
      handcuffs him.

      ANGLE -- Van Pelt smiles and waves to the Mom and Kids 
      watching this all from their adjacent driveway, stunned. 


      Cho talking to Dieter.

      FADE IN:


      The place is buzzing with POLICE and BFS TECHS.  Lisbon, with 
      Inspector Mulvey, tries to comfort a still shaken Jennifer 
      Sands.  

      Jane sits back, observing everything going on.  Watching

      Darkness.  Rain-slicked tarmac.  Jane in Jennifer s car, 
      engine running, wipers going, side-lights on.  A long wait.  
      Jane looks up to a tiny camera in the visor.

                          (sees something)
                    Ah.  Someone s coming.

      A hooded figure holding an umbrella ghosts across the lot and 
      climbs into the passenger seat.  It s Adrianna.  She holds a 
      gun on Jane with casual menace, like someone who s done this 
      kind of shit before.  She clutches a cellphone in her other 
      hand.

                                  ADRIANNA
                    This better not be a trap.  I will 
                    kill you.  Give me the diamonds.

                                  JANE

                    I don t know you.  I don t trust 
                    you.  Give me the diamonds.

      Jane shows her a leather bag, opens it, flashes a look 
      inside.

                                  JANE
                    Where s Julie?

                                  ADRIANNA

                                  JANE
                    So call them.

      Jane opens a bottle of water, drinks.

                                  ADRIANNA
                    How do I know those are real

                    I don t know.  They look real to 
                    me.  Here, have a look at them.  
                    You ve seen them before. 

      Here Jane employs a classic mentalist street con known in the 
      trade as  the Russian scam.   It s played slow and graceful, 
      rather than swift and comical.    

      He offers her the bag.  She wants it, but is momentarily 
      stymied because she has a gun in one hand and a cellphone in 
      the other.  He offers to take the cellphone with one hand and 
      offers to give the leather bag with the other.  Adrianna 
      automatically complies, and gives him the phone.  He hands 
      her the diamonds.  

                                  ADRIANNA
                    Hey.

                                  JANE
                    Oh, sorry.

      He takes back the leather bag, replaces them with a bottle of 
      water.  He shakes his head no, that s not right, just as she 
      does.  He hands her back the diamonds and takes the gun.  

      Now he s got the phone and the gun.  But hey, she figures, 
      confused momentarily, I got the diamonds.  She opens the bag.  
      Jane flips open the purloined phone and touches keys, whilst 
      doing the same with his own phone.   

                                  ADRIANNA

                    I don t have Jason s money.  They

                                  JANE 
                    Wait.  Did they ask for Jason s

      Minelli has just arrived, roused from bed, bleary, and not 
      very happy.  Lisbon greets him. 

                                    MINELLI
                    So far what I know is you guys have 
                    shot and grievously wounded a 
                    prominent and very well-liked 
                    member of the San Francisco Bar.  
                    What s going on?  In simple 
                      declarative sentences.

                                  LISBON
                    Bennett s our man.  Killed Jason 
                    Sands for ten million in diamonds.  
                    Kidnapped Julie Sands, same reason.  
                    Either the widow or the mistress 
                    acted as his accomplice. 

                                    MINELLI
                    Well, which?

                                  LISBON
                    We re trying to nail that down now.  
                    Bennett could tell us, if he makes 
                    it.  But it doesn t look like he 
                    will.  So we ll need a confession 
                    from his accomplice.  So uh...

                                    MINELLI
                    So uh?

                                  LISBON
                    Jane has an idea, but if we 
                    generate any complaints, as to how 
                    we go about this, you have our 
                    backs, right?

                                    MINELLI
                    That depends obviously.  We need a 
                    win here.  But I won t sanction 
                    anything underhanded or actionable.

                                  LISBON
                    That s kind of vague.  No 
                      disrespect.  This being high 
                    profile and so forth, maybe I 
                    should have my orders on paper.

                    Sure. On paper.  The whole point of 
                    this unit is subtlety and 
                      discretion and judgment.  I expect 
                    you to do what s right without 
                    dragging me into it. 

      Lisbon gazes at him, patiently waiting.

                    Yes, Lisbon.  Of course.  If I am

                    I m insulted you think to ask.    


      Adrianna pacing the floor.  A couple of Old Guys swivelling 
      their gaze like she s a tennis match.  Van Pelt and Cho 
      waiting patiently. 

      Jennifer Sands enters, hurries toward Van Pelt and Cho.

                    Yes.  She s a little in shock, but 
                    she s physically fine.  Not a 
                    scratch.  The doctors are just 
                    making sure.  

      Jennifer sees Adrianna.  Adrianna smiles at her.

      Jennifer looks like she might go and smack Adrianna, and 
      Adrianna gets ready to fight with convincing alacrity.  
      Jennifer thinks better of it, and takes the high road.  

                                  JENNIFER
                    You ve obviously led a very sad and

                    sympathy.

      Adrianna does kind of feel that way about herself so it hits 
      home.  She nearly goes for Jennifer.  But instead, chokes off 
      her anger.

                    The one Jane thought was so

                    Wendy.

                                  CHO
                    Yes.  Wendy.  Do either of you know 
                    a woman named Wendy?

      Both women think a beat.  Shake their heads. 

                                  CHO (CONT D)
                    No?  Shame.  She d be worth 
                    knowing.

      He chuckles.  Van Pelt frowns.

                    No no, he ll live.    

      Both women frown at this news.  Van Pelt and Cho exit.  
      Adrianna and Jennifer stare at each other as if Sergio Leone 
      was directing them, at each other, then at the exit door, 
      then back... 


      CPR DUMMIES on the shelves.  Cho and Van Pelt enter.  Lisbon

      Rigsby pushes open the door, peers inside.  The waiting room 
      is empty.  He speaks into his phone.

                                  RIGSBY

      Lisbon and Cho run down hallway to...


      Cho and Lisbon enter to find Julie sitting up in bed, locked 
      in a joyous hug with Adrianna.

      Jennifer comes hustling in, slams the front door behind her, 
      runs upstairs.


      Curtains are closed.  Jennifer flips on the LIGHTS and makes  *

      Jennifer turns to find Jane leaning in the doorway.  Caught 
      red-handed as it were, she visibly discards her innocent 
      persona.  But she s not giving up quite yet. 

                                  JENNIFER

                      everything.   

      Jennifer subsides into resignation, a leaden feeling in her 
      gut that she s been caught.

                                  JENNIFER 
                    Nicely done.  You made me think 
                    Adrianna had the money, and made 
                    her think I had it.  Clever.

                    Is it really in diamonds?  Or was

      Moves closer.

                    It was Bennett.  He forced me into 
                    this.  He planned the whole thing.

                    No.  Bennett is an idiot who thinks 
                    he s in control.  But you play him 
                    like a violin, with those big eyes 
                    and trembling lips.  It s a

                    office.  But he would never tell me 
                    where or what the combination was.  

      Bennett puts the remote control unit into Jason s hand.  And 
      urges him to give them the code.  Jason shakes his head - no.

                      Withholding.  Always withholding.  

      They start arguing and shouting at each other.  They 
      momentarily forget about Sands, who is not as out of it as he 
      looks.  He presses a code into the remote...

      The book shelf opens noiselessly and Sands throws himself 
      into the safe room before Bennett and Jennifer can stop him.
