The Fulcrum Agent drags Chuck towards her car.  A driver, 
HANS, blond, scary, distinctive TATOO on his neck, waits.

CHUCK
The whole creepy librarian thing 
was a compliment, I swear.  Ever 
since my sixth grade librarian 
introduced me to The Hobbit I ve 
had this thing for them...

FULCRUM AGENT
Shut up, Jorge.

She points the gun in his ear.  

CHUCK
Sorry.  I talk a lot when I m 
nervous or have a gun to my head.


Bryce rushes out a door.  See Von Hayes in his Red Ferrari.
Von Hayes peels out.  Bryce dives for the car door.  

He hangs on for a second but the Ferrari takes a hard turn 
tossing Bryce who rolls hard against the pavement.  


The Fulcrum Agent heads towards the car with Chuck as Sarah 
bursts out after them.

SARAH
Freeze!  

The Fulcrum Agent tosses Chuck into the street as a 
distraction.  As she gets inside the car she tells Hans -- 

FULCRUM AGENT
Kill him.

Hans slams on the gas.  The town car racing towards Chuck. 

Chuck pulls himself up off the ground.  Now he sees the      
Town Car racing towards him.  He s standing in front of the 
car like a geek frozen in the headlights (literally).    

SARAH
Chuck!  Run!

Sarah, seeing Chuck frozen in fear, races towards him.

She gets to him moments before impact, pushing him aside.  
Chuck falls to the ground out of the town car s path.  
Sarah s not so lucky, however.  

The town car hits her, flipping her up and over the roof onto 
the ground.  The Town Car speeds off.  

OFF Chuck, seeing Sarah lying motionless on the ground --

ACT THREE


Chuck enters.  Bryce suddenly appears from the shadows.  
Surprising Chuck.

BRYCE
Chuck.

CHUCK
You really need to tone down the 
entrances a notch.  

BRYCE
Sorry.  Comes with the job.

CHUCK
Look, I ve had a long day already, 
and I gotta go to work so if you 
have any life changing bombs you 
wanna drop on me... Please, save 
them for later.

BRYCE
I m worried about Sarah.

CHUCK
She s gonna be fine.  Ellie said 
its just a few bruised ribs. 

BRYCE
It s not her ribs I m worried 
about.

CONTINUED:
BRYCE (CONT'D)
(then)
She has feelings for you, Chuck.  
Normally I wouldn t care except 
they got in the way of her doing 
her job today.  She went off 
mission and not only did we lose 
the microchip, the two of you 
almost got killed.      

CHUCK
She went off mission to protect me. 
Which by the way IS her job.  It 
also happens to win her points in 
my book.  

BRYCE
I m not gonna argue with you, 
Chuck.  Either you end this thing 
or I will.

CHUCK
It s always the same with you, 
Bryce.  First it s Jill, now it s 
Sarah.  You just don t want me to 
be the one who gets the girl.

Bryce gets deadly serious --

BRYCE
Chuck, the people we deal with are 
cold blood killers.  They have no 
feelings.  No emotions.  They care 
about nothing except money and 
power, and they ll kill anyone who 
gets in the way of that.  The only 
chance we have to defeat people 
like Fulcrum is to think and act 
like they do.  That means no 
feelings.  No emotional 
attachments.  Nothing.  Anything 
less will get us killed.  

CHUCK
Sarah knows what she s doing, Bryce.  
Trust me, she s completely safe.

Bryce shrugs and walks away.  OFF Chuck, does he really 
believe what he said is true?? --


END OF ACT THREECHUCK - Episode 203 - Scott Rosenbaum - Network Draft       35.


ACT FOUR


TRAVELLERS enter and exit the station.  Casey is reading a 
newspaper blending in.  Bryce stands with Chuck who has a 
large green duffle bag with him.  All are mic ed. 

CHUCK
Doesn t this train station remind 
you of The Untouchables?

BRYCE
I don t know.  I never saw it.

CHUCK
You never watched any of the movies 
I told you to.

BRYCE
I m a little busy.

CHUCK
Forget it.  What movie s more 
exciting than your real life 
anyhow, right?

Casey spots Von Hayes in the crowd.  

CASEY
There he is, Chuck.  You re on.

Chuck now approaches Von Hayes.

VON HAYES
You got the cash?

Chuck opens the duffle just enough to show him the cash.

CHUCK
You got the microchip?

Von Hayes opens his hand -- revealing the chip.

VON HAYES
Alright.  Give me the money.

CHUCK
You first.

VON HAYES
No.  You first.

CHUCK
No.  You first.



(CONTINUED)CHUCK - Episode 203 - Scott Rosenbaum - Network Draft       40.

CONTINUED:

They re at a standstill.

CASEY (V.O.)
Just make the exchange, moron.

Von Hayes wipes some sweat off his brow.

VON HAYES
Sorry.  I ve never done a hand-off 
before.  I m really not used to 
this spy stuff.

CHUCK
I know.  It s really stressful, 
isn t it?

OFF Casey, if looks could kill --


CLOSE ON Morgan as he walks across the parking lot towards a 
circle of Buy More employees, SportsJocks! and various other 
mall scum.  An appropriate Sergio Leone score plays.  Or 
anything else we can afford.

The circle parts to let Morgan through.  As it does we see 
Mitt waiting in the middle.  Morgan enters and they enclose 
him once again.

Morgan and Mitt stare at each other.  The gladiator versus 
the geek.  

LESTER
Let s get ready to 
rumbbbbblllllleeeee!

They circle each other.

JEFF
Sweep the leg, Morgan!

Then, just as these two titans are about to collide, a 
familiar face and voice enters the ring.

CHUCK
Guys.  C mon.  Break it up.

MORGAN
Look, Chuck.  I can handle it okay.

CHUCK
Really?

MORGAN
No.  But... 

Chuck turns back to Mitt.

CHUCK
What s the problem, Mitt?

MITT
Your friend made fun of me because 
I can t speak Spanish.  Then he 
dumped a coke on my head.

CHUCK
(to Morgan)
You did?



(CONTINUED)CHUCK - Episode 203 - Scott Rosenbaum - Network Draft       48.

CONTINUED:

MORGAN
Long story.

CHUCK
Look, Mitt.  I don t want any 
trouble, but if you re gonna fight 
Morgan then you re gonna have to 
fight me, too.  

MITT
Okay.  I ll smear both you geeks.

CHUCK
Not the response I was hoping for.

MORGAN
Me either...

Mitt pulls back a fist.  SWINGS!  Just before the meaty paw 
can connect with Chuck a hand comes into frame.  Catches 
Mitt s punch.  Reveal --

CASEY

Casey then throws a quick punch and knocks Mitt down.  Mitt 
holds his nose, doesn t want to get up for more.

MITT
He broke my nose...

Casey, Chuck and Morgan head back to the Buy More --

MORGAN
(to Casey)
No one s ever stuck up for me 
before except Chuck.  Thanks.

CASEY
You showed some cajones out there, 
Grimes.  Maybe there s hope for you 
yet.

OFF Morgan, proud of himself, maybe there is --


Chuck now enters the courtyard.  Bryce comes out of the 
shadows to greet him.  Glasses off.  Scares Chuck again.  

BRYCE
Chuck.




(CONTINUED)CHUCK - Episode 203 - Scott Rosenbaum - Network Draft       49.

CONTINUED:

CHUCK
There you go again with the 
entrances.

Bryce gets serious.

BRYCE
We need to talk about Sarah, Chuck.  
She had a chance to take the shot 
back there and she didn t.  She 
hesitated and it almost cost us the 
microchip and your life.

CHUCK
(reluctantly)
I know...

Beat.

BRYCE
What are you gonna do about it?

CHUCK
What am I supposed to do, Bryce?

BRYCE
You ll do the right thing, Chuck.  
You always do.  It s why I sent you 
the Intersect in the first place.

Bryce starts out.  Chuck notices Bryce left his glasses.

CHUCK
Hey, Bryce.  You forgot your 
glasses.

BRYCE
You keep  em.  If you re gonna be a 
real spy you re gonna need them.

CHUCK
(hands them back)
I don t want to be a real spy.

Bryce takes them back and disappears into the night.  OFF 
Chuck, considering everything --
