      MacMillan steps outside to a cement walkway leading out to a 
      vast employee parking lot. 

      He reaches the walkway s end. Stops. 

      Just stands there. 

      FADE UP SUPER:  Armonk, New York. 1981. 


      SLAMMING closed the trunk of a black 1980 Audi Quattro. 

      HIS HAND REACHES INSIDE THE SUIT BREAST POCKET

      Pulls out a pair of Serengeti sunglasses. 

      Places them over his eyes.                                                                                      2.



      The Audi ROARS past the company entrance sign: IBM.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      The GROWING ROAR of the Audi. It appears, rockets down a two-
      line asphalt in a matter of seconds, kicking up dead leaves. 


      The Audi traverses a wooded lane that opens onto the rocky 
      coast of the Atlantic Ocean. Going faster.


      The Audi SMASHES through the guard rail somewhere around 110. 

      A direct hit. No swerve. Intentional. 

      The rail gives like paper and the Audi is now a missile being 
      shot out over the white water of the coastline. 

      It sails high, engine REVVED and floored before...

      THE FRONT END HITS THE WATERLINE LIKE A BRICK WALL

      DESTROYING half of the car with a THUNDER CLAP. 

      A few seconds pass before lapping waves begin to fold around 
      the vehicle and its driver. No movement within. Completely 
      arrested.

      MacMillan and Clark walk to Joe s second Audi Quattro, a 
      slightly newer model of the one he drove into the ocean.

                    You kiddin  me? Where s the 
                    Porsche?

                                  MACMILLAN
                    What?

                                  CLARK
                    You sales guys. Don t you drive the

      Clark gets out of the car, as does MacMillan. They walk 
      toward the office. 

                                  CLARK
                    Wow, I ve gotta say I m impressed. 
                    That was like...  JFK staring down 
                    the Cuban Missile Crisis. Applied 
                    Data hasn t bought jack-all from 
                    anyone in years. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    We did good. You did a solid job 
                      explaining the software.

                                  CLARK
                    Good... I mean, I should ve, I 
                    wrote the--

      MacMillan spins on him. Clark stops, caught off-guard.

                                  MACMILLAN
                    But I need you to do me one favor. 

                                  CLARK
                    Okay. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Next time I move to close. This is 
                    what you do.

                                  CLARK
                          (eager for a pro tip)
                    Okay, what?                                                                                    19.


                                  MACMILLAN
                    You SHUT. THE FUCK. UP. 

      It echoes out over the entire parking lot. Clark stands 
      there, stunned, speechless. MacMillan steps closer, extremely 
      intimidating.

                                  MACMILLAN (CONT D)
                    Do you understand me?

      Clark can only nod somewhat. MacMillan walks off, leaving 
      Clark alone in the lot. 

      A wave of several different emotions cross over Clark s face 
      as he stares after him. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      The lights are up at the movie s end, the signature JOHN 
      WILLIAMS FANFARE playing over the end credits.  

      CLARK AND HIS FAMILY slowly walk out with the rest of the 
      audience. His daughters are overjoyed.                                                                                     26.


                                  CLARK
                          (to daughters)
                    You guys like that?

                                  HALEY
                    Yeah!

                                  CLARK
                          (to Donna)
                    I ll also point out that Elliot had 
                    a Speak & Spell and not a Cardiff 
                    Giant systems mainframe. 

      Clark stops unexpectedly.

      ANGLE ON Joe MacMillan in his shirt and tie, sleeves rolled 
      up, sitting in the back row with a bag of popcorn. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Gordon, is that you?

      He stands, offers his hand to Donna.  

                                  MACMILLAN (CONT D)
                    Hi, Joe MacMillan. We spoke on the 
                    phone earlier. 

                                  DONNA
                    Oh, right...

                                  MACMILLAN
                    You guys couldn t wait to see this, 
                    either? Very affecting movie.

                                  DONNA
                    The girls have been crazy to--

                                  CLARK
                    Did you follow me here?

      MacMillan steps out of the aisle, leads Clark away.

                                  MACMILLAN
                          (to kids)
                    You mind if I borrow your dad for a 
                    second?

                                  CLARK
                          (to Donna)
                    Work stuff.

      Donna ushers the children out of the theater, eyeing 
      MacMillan, unsure.                                                                                     27.


                                  MACMILLAN
                    Reverse engineer an IBM PC with me.

      A beat. Clark lightly kicks one of the seat legs.

                                  CLARK
                    Why do you want to reverse engineer 
                    an IBM PC?

                                  MACMILLAN
                    I told you. It s where everything 
                    is headed.

                                  CLARK
                    I know.
                          (pause)
                    But why are you doing this?

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Why do you think I picked Cardiff 
                    Giant? With my resume, I could ve 
                    gone to work for any other company 
                    in the country. Maybe the world. 
                    But I came to Texas. You think I 
                    did it for the BBQ? I came to where 
                    you were. And as luck would have 
                    it, you re extremely unhappy. 

                                  CLARK
                    I think you make a lot of 
                      assumptions. 
                          (pause)
                    Look, thanks for seeing something I 
                    used to be, but...

                                  MACMILLAN
                    I don t take no for an answer.

                                  CLARK
                    I m gonna have to respectfully 
                    decline, Joe. I just... can t put 
                    my job in jeopardy when I ve got 
                    two kids and...
                          (hating himself)
                    Two mortgages and two car payments.

      Clark leaves the theater, his face conflicted. He looks back 
      toward MacMillan a couple of times on his way out. 

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    28.



      MacMillan walks to his car, putting on his sunglasses. Clark 
      follows, almost chasing after him.

                                  CLARK
                    Hey. Hey! HEY!

      MacMillan turns around. 

                                  CLARK (CONT D)
                    You called them the other night, 
                    didn t you? The moment we finished. 
                    What happened, Big Blue kill your 
                    dog? 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Just let everybody cool off.

                                  CLARK
                    Let them cool off? 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Gordon. It s gonna be fine.                                                                                    43.


      Clark DECKS HIM across the face without a word, knocking 
      MacMillan s sunglasses to the concrete. Despite the violence, 
      MacMillan remains calm as he retrieves them, puts them on. 

                                  CLARK
                    I don t know who you think you are. 
                    But you re wrong. You can t just 
                    walk into this company, walk into 
                    my life and start rearranging shit. 
                    You might be some hot shot swinging 
                    dick without a care in the world 
                    but I got a family, man. 
                          (pause)
                    I got a family.

      Clark walks away. MacMillan wipes blood from the corner of 
      his mouth. Then:

                                  MACMILLAN
                          (calling after)
                    Just tell me one thing.

      Clark stops, turns around. Waits.

                                  MACMILLAN (CONT D)
                    When we were working in that 
                    garage. Where you work like you 
                    used to work, I mean really work. 
                    Tell me that didn t feel good. Tell 
                    me that didn t wake something up 
                    inside you that s been dormant for 
                    a long time. 

                                  CLARK
                    Look. I see the future. I ve been 
                    seeing it since 1975. And as weird 
                    as you are, I can tell you see it, 
                    too. All right? I m not a betting 
                    man, but I d put money on where I 
                    think things are going. Do you know 
                    how hard that is? To wake up every 
                    morning and know in your gut? And 
                    watch everyone around you walk off 
                    a cliff? Watch yourself walk off 
                    it, too? 
                          (pause)
                    We can t make them see it. You 
                    can t make someone see it. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    I believe you can.                                                                                    44.


      Clark just shakes his head. Walks away. 

                                                                            CUT TO:
