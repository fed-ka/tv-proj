LOGAN wakes. with a wordless shout, sitting upright,
shirtless, in a bed covered with shredded bedsheets.
KAYLA SILVERFOX (25) wraps her arms around him and whispers
in his ear.
KAYLA
It's okay... shh... it's okay.
Logan pants, chest heaving, eyes wild, gripping the tattered
sheets in his fists. Kayla holds him tight until his bone
claws retract.
KAYLA (cont'd)
I'm right here with you. Okay? I'm
right here with you.
Kayla, a full-blooded Innu, wears her long black hair pulled
back in a ponytail. She's been sleeping in one of Logan's
flannel shirts.
KAYLA (cont'd)
The war dreams or the one where
you're a kid?
Logan takes a deep breath, finally calming down. He relaxes
into Kayla's arms.
LOGAN
The one where I'm a kid.
Kayla runs her fingers through his thick hair, kissing his
forehead. He sees that she has a small cut on her forearm. He
takes her arm and looks at the wound.

SHERRLENE, a peroxide-blonde in her fifties, whose tanned
hide is covered with interlaced tattoos, slaps a tribal beat
on a pair of bongos.
The crowd hushes. A tall man in a hooded robe shuffles toward,
the stage like a boxer long past his prime. He stands in
front of the gawkers, head bowed, face shadowed by his hood.

Finally BEAK throws off his robe and raises his wings to the
crowd. As advertised, he looks like an amalgam of man and
bird, with three-toed, clawed feet and dirty-feathered wings.
His very human, tired brown eyes are set in a face dominated
by a long sharp beak. He stares back at the gaping crowd.
Beak looks more pathetic than monstrous. His skinny limbs
don't seem very strong and he projects an air of weary
resignation, not menace.
But when he flaps his gray wings and caws at the onlookers,
the children shriek in terror and bury their faces in their
father's legs.
Sherrlene and Beak sit at a card table, playing gin and
drinking bourbon.
SHERRLENE

He throws down his hand in disgust.

Logan drives Kayla home over roads slick with black ice. She
sings softly along with the country song on the radio.
LOGAN
Stryker came by the house today.
KAYLA
Stryker? Colonel Stryker? The one

What did he want?
LOGAN
Wants me back.
KAYLA

LOGAN
Told him no.
KAYLA
So why can't they get someone else?
Logan thinks about it for a moment. When he speaks there is a
degree of self-loathing in his tone.
LOGAN
I'm the best there is at what I do.
And what I do best isn't very nice.
Kayla studies the side of his face for a moment.
LOGAN (cont'd)
Maybe he's right. Maybe it's the
only thing I'm good for.
Kayla watches him. Logan shakes his head as if ridding
himself of an errant thought.

KAYLA (cont'd)
She used to have a lover.
Kuekuatsheu. They lived in the
Spirit World and every night they'd
wander the skies together. But one
of the other spirits was jealous.
Trickster wanted the Moon for
himself. So he told Kuekuatsheu the
Moon asked for flowers. He told him
to come to our world and pick her
some wild roses.
LOGAN
Never trust a guy named Trickster.
KAYLA
Yeah, well, you do some stupid
things when you're in love.
Kuekuatsheu didn't know that once
you leave the Spirit World, you can
never go back. Now he's trapped
here. Every night the Moon searches
for him and every night he sees her

Rounding a corner on the narrow access road, Kayla nearly
collides with a man in a long black coat. She slams on the
brakes and the truck shudders to a halt.
The man's back is turned to the truck, his head bowed. His
hair hangs below his shoulders, clotted with dirt, as if he's
been sleeping in the woods for weeks.
Kayla leans out of the open truck window. Before she can
speak, the man in the long black coat turns.
It's not just his size that frightens us, though the man is
massive. It's not just the four-inch-long black talons
curling from his fingertips, or the gleaming fangs he licks
as he smiles at her.
What terrifies us most are his eyes. They are a shark's eyes,
black and loveless and utterly inhuman.

Victor Creed walks toward the truck. He scrapes his talons
over the hood: screeeeee. Five parallel gashes now scar the
hood, carved straight through the steel.
The local dive opens early. TOWN DRUNKS sit by themselves,
smoking cigarettes, sipping the day's first hair-of--the-dog,
reading the paper or staring into their beer.
Victor Creed sits at the bar, carving a crude smiley face
into the wood with the claw of his index finger. He looks up
and sees the BARTENDER staring at him. The bartender doesn't
approve of the vandalism, but he's not about to say anything.
Creed taps the rim of his glass. The bartender comes over
with a bottle of George Dickel Tennessee whiskey. He fills
Creed's glass halfway-- a standard pour.
Creed stares at the bartender. He taps the glass again. The
bartender, hand shaking, fills the glass to the brim.
Creed raises the whiskey to the light.
VICTOR CREED
Stuff don't work on me. I drink and
drink and I never feel any
different.
He downs the full glass of whiskey with a swallow. He looks
around the bar, at the pool table in the back, the Wurlitzer
jukebox, the stacked bottles of liquor.
VICTOR CREED (cont'd)
You got any insurance on this
place?

Insurance? I guess so. Why?
Creed wipes his mouth with the back of his hand.

Logan approaches the bar, never taking his eyes off creed.
Finally Creed turns to look at Logan. He stands, towering
above the smaller man.
Logan sees a splotch of dried blood on the back of Creed's
hand. Creed knows Logan is looking at it. He lifts his hand
to his mouth and licks the blood off.
VICTOR CREED (cont'd)
Sweet girl. Tasted like strawberry
jam.
The bone claws burst from Logan's hands, pale, white, and
serrated. He growls and swings at Creed's head.
The big man is fast. He ducks under the claws, grinning and
circling like a boxer, happy that he's finally got a decent
adversary.
The bartender and the local drunks have seen plenty of bar
fights, but not ones featuring clawed mutants. They run.
VICTOR CREED (cont'd)
You can scare off the civilians
with those, sonny boy. But I got
claws of my own.
He swings, raking his talons across Logan's chest, drawing
first blood. Logan lunges at Creed and the battle begins.
-The pace of the combat is startling, the physical power
stupendous. A missed swipe by Creed ends with him clawing out
the guts of the jukebox. Logan jumps at his enemy and gets
swatted into the wall, smashing the plasterboard.
Creed grabs Logan by the collar and tosses him onto the pool
table. Creed brings his fist down, looking to pulverize
Logan's skull, but the smaller man rolls clear. Creed's fist
shatters the slate and the table collapses.
Clearing his head on the sawdusted floor, Logan sees the
eight ball rolling past. He picks it up and hurls it at
Creed's head.
Creed catches the eight ball in his left hand and squeezes
his fist shut. He opens his hand and lets the powdered
remains spill onto the floor.
Logan springs to his feet and swings at creed, again and

Logan's throat.

With no room to dodge, Logan drives his head forward,
smashing Creed's face with a glorious headbutt.

As Creed staggers back, Logan kicks him in the chest,
knocking the big man over the bar, where he crashes into the
bottles of liquor and slides to the floor in a tumult of
glass shards and alcohol.
Logan sees a lit cigarette in an ashtray on one of the
tables. He picks the butt up and flicks it over the bar.
The cigarette ignites the spilt alcohol. Creed roars and
rises to his feet, a burning man.
He vaults over the bar and advances on Logan. The flames
consume his overcoat, licking at his skin. Creed slaps them
out with his palms, apparently oblivious to the pain.

Logan sits at the breakfast table with James and Heather. He
wears an old plaid shirt, dungarees, and a pair of scuffed
work boots.
A heaping breakfast lies before him: scrambled eggs, pork
sausages, pancakes with maple syrup, a steaming mug of
coffee.
Logan devours everything in front of him, looking up only to
nod in thanks as Heather scoops more food onto his plate.

James's face lights up. Logan has found the man's passion.,

Heather stands to clear the plates.

Logan, smiling, holds up his hands to surrender.
The smile fades when he sees the red laser dot appear on
Heather's shirt.
HEATHER HUDSON (cont'd)
What's the matter, honey?
Logan dives across the table, trying to knock her out of the
way, but the bullet beats him there, punching through the
window frame and straight through Heather Hudson's heart.
She collapses in Logan's arms.

But it's too late. A second bullet hits James in the back;
the farmer blinks and topples forward, dead before he hits

Logan checks James Hudson's pulse but finds none. He looks up
when he hears the thrum of the military helicopter.
Two Good Samaritans lie dead at his feet, slaughtered for
sheltering him. Something bestial has. entered Logan's eyes.
Both the PILOT and the GUNNER wear helmets with monocular
eyepieces that provide images from the external cameras.

A smoke-darkened figure stares back at him.
The pilot nearly jumps out of his seat.

Logan raises his right hand and plunges his claws through the
bulletproof glass.
Stryker sits alone in his office, pinching the bridge of his

He throws the tarp off the '48 Harley. James Hudson restored
this bike with love and elbow grease. The chrome and leather
shine as brightly as any new model on the factory floor.
The key is in the ignition. This used to be a safe
neighborhood.
Agent Zero grabs an Atchisson assault shotgun from a rack
behind his seat that holds an impressive array of weaponry.
He lowers the passenger window and gets a bead on Logan, who
swerves to keep himself (and his more fragile motorcycle) a
tricky target.
Stryker sits behind the desk of his office. His aide,

Even at this hour the gym is packed with aspiring PUGILISTS.
Las Vegas has become the Mecca of world boxing, and many 'of
the fighters here exhibit impressive skills as they batter
the heavy bag, tap at the speed bag, and jump rope.
Logan walks toward a ring in the center of the gym. Two young
BOXERS inside the ropes, wearing headgear and sparring
gloves, dance around throwing quick jabs that don't land.
JOHN WRAITH (45) stands outside the ring, watching this

Logan's expression does not change as he watches the report.
Our only indications that he's boiling inside are the look of

He lowers the volume with the remote, picks up the telephone

The stock boy peeks around the divider. FRED J. DUKES,
a.k.a., THE BLOB, stands in the center of the aisle, tearing
open bags of pork rinds and pouring them down his gullet.
Dukes is the biggest man you've ever seen. By a long shot.
Just shy of seven feet tall and weighing in at half a ton,
he's beyond fat. Beyond obese.
His eyes look like pinpricks in the swollen enormity of his
face. When he shifts his bulk, ripples cascade down his
flanks, his flesh trembling with each breath.

Jesus, Dukes...
Dukes, mouth and chin dusted with fried pork skin, turns his
head to examine the pest standing next to him.
LOGAN (cont'd)
Maybe it's time to give the pork
rinds a rest.
Dukes swings his arm. Despite his enormous mass, the man
moves with surprising speed. Not quick enough to catch Logan,
though, who ducks beneath the blow.
Dukes's forearm, thicker than a fire hydrant, smashes through
the steel shelving. Bags of pork rinds and potato chips
tumble to the floor.

shelves into the next aisle. Panicked SHOPPERS scream and run

Dukes bellows and runs at Logan. A coconut pelts him in the
face, angering him further. Logan jumps out of the way as
Dukes brings down his massive fists. Coconuts explode.
Dukes charges after Logan, shattering watermelons, stacked
grapefruits, clusters of bananas.
After a thirty second rampage Dukes is exhausted, his giant
chest heaving as he gasps for air, his hands and face
splattered with remnants of crushed fruit.
Logan jumps onto Dukes' back. The fat man roars and spins
around, trying to buck the little rider, but Logan's got one
arm wrapped around Dukes' throat and he's not letting go.
The spinning makes Dukes a little dizzy and he slows down.
Three adamantium claws shine in the big fellow's face,
reflecting the overhead fluorescent lights.
Dukes quits, his massive shoulders slumping. He sinks to his
knees, his great bulk splitting the linoleum floor.
Logan presses his claws against Dukes' quivering jowls.

Stryker stands at the window overlooking Alkali Lake. Dr.
Cornelius steps into the room, holding a black leather case.
CORNELIUS
The Eleven will be ready within 24
hours.
STRYKER
Good.
CORNELIUS
Sir... Lieutenant Hines hasn't
reported to base today.

Stryker considers the information for a moment and nods.
STRYKER (cont'd)
All right, thank you, Doctor.
(glancing at case)
What's this?
Cornelius sets the case on the table and opens it. Six
gleaming, armor-piercing bullets rest in green felt niches.
CORNELIUS
We saved the leftover adamantium
from the Weapon X procedure.
Stryker plucks one of the bullets from its niche and rolls it
between his fingers, examining it with a practiced eye.
CORNELIUS (cont'd)
Each one's got a high-explosive
core. Two in the head and Logan's
brain will have to regenerate from
scratch.
STRYKER
They won't kill him?
CORNELIUS
According to the computer models we
ran, there's a 30 percent chance
his healing factor will
reconstitute the gray matter. But
those synaptic bridges that form
our memories? Gone. If he survives,
his brain will come back fresh.
STRYKER
A blank slate... easy to train.
Stryker fondles the shining bullet lovingly.
STRYKER (cont'd)
She's a pretty little thing.
CORNELIUS
She ought to be. That's the world's
most expensive bullet.
Stryker pulls a revolver from his shoulder holster, dumps the
standard rounds, and begins loading the adamantium bullets.

There's another way, a more

STRYKER
Mm?
CORNELIUS
Only problem is, the procedure can
only be done here at Alkali Lake.
Stryker swings the chamber shut and holsters his gun.
STRYKER
Oh, he's coming back, Doctor. We
have what he's looking for.
HINES
You have some blood on your shirt.
Logan sees the drops of blood and tries to blot them out.
LOGAN
I barely hit the guy.
They don't notice as a small security camera near the
entrance pivots, its black eye watching the intruders.

CONTINUED:
Hines, very nervous, tries to keep her composure. Logan puts
a hand on her shoulder-- partly to steady her nerves, partly
to keep pushing her forward.
LOGAN (cont'd)
Time to visit the Colonel.
Hines and Logan walk down a long corridor. Several SOLDIERS
and SCIENTISTS walk by, most of them ignoring the pair.
One young scientist in a lab coat hurries past, nodding at
Hines.
YOUNG SCIENTIST
Lieutenant.
HINES

Murphy.
Hines waits till Murphy passes. She stops in front of a
locked door and allows a laser scanner to read her retina.
The door slides open.
Logan looks through the open doorway, his nostrils flaring.
He looks primed for homicide.
LOGAN
I can smell him.
He walks through the door. Hines checks to see if the coast
is clear.and follows him. Neither notices the security camera
mounted on the ceiling, swiveling to track their movement.
Logan and Hines stand at the top of a steel staircase, forty
feet above the concrete floor of a massive cavern.
Created in the 1960s by an underground hydrogen bomb test,
the Alkali Lake cavern is the second biggest in the country,
smaller only than the salt caverns of the Gulf Coast, home of
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

CONTINUED:
The sheer scale of the place is staggering. Three times the
size of the Super Dome, with walls of rough granite, the
cavern is loud with the constant thrum of ventilation and
high-powered machinery. Heavy steel pillars support the
ceiling of the cavern.
Ten thousand stainless steel isolation tanks crowd the floor,
arrayed in a grid, each tank slightly larger than a coffin.
TECHNICIANS walk in between the tanks, checking gauges,
writing notes in clipboards.
More technicians sit on a raised podium in the center of the
cavern, overlooking the Eleven, entering information into the
computers that monitor the sleeping army.
Logan is awed by the sight. Hines has descended the staircase
ahead of him. He follows after her.
HINES
Welcome to Weapon Eleven.
LOGAN
(STUNNED)
I thought it was just gonna be one

HINES
Ten thousand.
They reach the cavern floor and walk amongst the Eleven.
HINES (cont'd)
Stryker says mutants and humans
will fight a war soon.
(gesturing to Weapon XI)
This is his army.
The camera glides over the isolation tanks as Hines continues
to speak. We catch glimpses of the ELEVEN inside, comatose
soldiers with needles and wires protruding from their skin,
exactly like Logan during the Weapon X procedure.
The men all look identical and they all look oddly familiar.

They incorporate the most

Logan stops beside one tank and looks at the man inside, who
floats in his chemical sleep. His eyes widen when he realizes
what he's looking at.

It's Creed...
He looks inside another tank. Same cruel face, same powerful
body. Only their shaved heads distinguish them from Victor
Creed.
LOGAN (cont'd)
They're all Creed.
HINES
Stryker's most successful mutant
hunter. They cloned him years ago.

The Colonel's been planning this
for a long time. _
Logan walks through the midst of this vast, sleeping army,
surrounded by ten thousand replicas of his worst enemy.
LOGAN
They get into the world, it's
genocide.
HINES
I think that's the general idea.
Logan stops in mid--stride, head raised in the manner of a
hunting dog who has just caught wind of his prey.
HINES (cont'd)
What's the matter?
Logan moves, walking quickly, nearly knocking over a
technician entering data into one of the stasis pods.

Hines hurries after Logan, smiling apologetically at the
annoyed technician.

Don't follow me.
Hines stops, standing alone in the middle of the Eleven.
Logan walks rapidly down the hallway, his pace accelerating
as he nears a closed doorway. He rests his head against the
door for a moment before putting his hand on the knob and
entering the room.
Stryker sits behind his desk, smiling at Logan. But Logan's
not looking at the colonel. He's looking at the young woman
who sits across from Stryker, her back to the door.
She doesn't turn. Her long black hair cascades down her back.
STRYKER
Hello, old friend. We've been
waiting for you.
Logan walks toward the desk, slowly now, a man in a nightmare
he can't wake from.
STRYKER (cont'd)
Did you really think we just let
you walk away three years ago?
You're a dangerous man, my friend.
We like to keep an eye on dangerous
men.
When Logan reaches the young woman he puts his hand on her
shoulder.
Kayla Silverfox turns and stares up at him, tears streaming
down her face.
KAYLA
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
An aluminum baseball bat whirs through the air, smashing the
back of Logan's head.
Logan falls to the floor, unconscious.
Victor Creed stands above him, staring at the flattened
barrel of the baseball bat.

Let's go. He'll only be out for a

Creed tosses aside the bat and lifts Logan onto his shoulders
as easily as a normal man would lift a child of six. He
carries Logan out of the room, winking at Kayla.
Logan, still unconscious, sits on a chair that looks far too
similar to an electric chair, his arms and legs bound with
titanium manacles that prevent any movement.
The room looks like an execution chamber, complete with a
viewing window.
He opens his eyes and blinks in the bright light. Stryker and
Creed stand in front of him but Logan doesn't look at them.
Dr. Cornelius and an ASSISTANT stand near a machine that is
wired to the electric chair, fiddling with the controls, but
Logan doesn't look at them, either.
He stares at Kayla, who cannot meet his eyes.
LOGAN
Who are you?
KAYLA
(very quiet)
You know who I am.
LOGAN
No I don't.
STRYKER
She's real, old friend. Your eyes

Logan ignores Stryker, staring at the love of his life.

STRYKER
I asked you nicely to join the

But I knew if nothing else could
motivate you, revenge would.
Stryker smiles at Kayla, a proud professor beaming at his
student.
STRYKER (cont'd)
Tell him. Tell him about the day
you died.
Kayla, head bowed, is silent for a long count. When she
speaks her voice is a strange monotone, devoid of feeling.
KAYLA
They gave me a syringe full of
hydrochlorothiazide.

LOGAN
Why? I
KAYLA -
Same as Victor. Stryker gave me a I
choice: spend the rest of my life
in prison or come work for him.

Prison...
Kayla finally raises her head-and looks directly at Logan.
KAYLA
Shot my Daddy when I was eighteen.
Big mistake. Should have shot him
when I was seventeen.
LOGAN
You told me he died of a heart
attack.
KAYLA
Maybe he had a heart attack after I
shot him. Sat there and watched him
bleed. After what that man did to
me, I wish he died slower.
Logan stares at her for a long time.
KAYLA (cont'd)
That sweet little girl you lived
with in the cabin? That was all
make-believe.

Kayla blinks and looks away.

Everybody's a sucker for something.
Figuring out what it is, that's the
trick. For you, it's a woman's
love. An easy weakness to forgive.
But still a weakness.
Stryker signals to Cornelius. The doctor and his assistant
attach a nasty-looking copper halo to Logan's skull. The halo
is wired to the electric chair.
Logan never takes his eyes off Silverfox.
STRYKER (cont'd)
Don't be angry at her. She was just
serving her country, keeping the
mutant menace in check. She and
victor have been a real credit to
their race.
It takes Logan a moment to understand this comment.
LOGAN
You're a mutant?
KAYLA
My Daddy found out when I was
twelve. Said a freak like me
deserved whatever I got.
VICTOR CREED
My kind of guy.
STRYKER
She's a gifted girl. She can plant
thoughts in anyone's mind, make
them believe what she wants-- as
long as she stays focused on them.
He strokes her long dark hair, proud of his protege. Kayla
doesn't seem thrilled by Stryker's touch, but she endures it.
STRYKER (cont'd)
A useful tool in a seduction.

Cornelius checks the digital gauges on the machine.

If I've calibrated correctly, we'll
leave intact the hard-wired

Stryker exits the room, followed by Victor.

That story you told me... about the
guy who goes to get flowers for the

You didn't trick me into loving

Kayla lowers her eyes.

You don't know what it was like.
LOGAN
I know exactly what is was like. I
come from there too.
KAYLA
I didn't have a choice.

Kayla turns and walks out of the room. Cornelius and his aide
follow, shutting the door behind them.
Logan takes a deep breath. He looks like a man who is ready
to forget everything.
Hines sits alone on a metal cot. The cell door slides open.
Stryker and Victor step inside.
STRYKER
Lieutenant. Victor and I were just
discussing how to kill you and we
thought you might have some
suggestions.
Silverfox steps out of the re-education chamber. She hears
voices from the holding cell and approaches.
STRYKER (O.S.)
When the Turks captured a traitor,
they strapped a steel basket to the
man's stomach. Inside the basket
was a rat.

Now, even a rat can't chew through

HINES
Please, Colonel--
Stryker pats Hines on the cheek and nods to Victor.
STRYKER
Enjoy yourself.
HINES
Please don't do this... Please!
Victor drags the screaming Hines off of her cot. Kayla
watches with growing unease but Stryker smiles and- waves
goodbye as he turns the key that shuts the cell door.
Logan sits in his electric chair, staring straight ahead,
preparing himself for the pain.
Cornelius stands behind the glass viewing window with his
ASSISTANT. He puts his hand on a red switch.
Thousands of volts surge into Logan's skull, forcing his body
to arch. After several seconds the power shuts off. Tendrils
of white smoke rise from the copper halo.
Logan opens his eyes and stares at Cornelius.
LOGAN
That all you got?

This could take a while. Raise the

Stryker signs a memo and hands it to his aide, Collins. Kayla
stands by the window, picking at her fingers.
KAYLA
You're going to let Victor kill
that woman.
Stryker and Collins ignore her.
KAYLA (cont'd)
When you got me out of prison, you
told me we were going to help
people.
Stryker continues to sign papers, never looking up.
STRYKER
We are. We're saving humanity.
KAYLA

The phone rings. Stryker answers it.
STRYKER
Yes?

He stands and heads for the door. Collins follows. In the
doorway, Stryker stops and fixes his cold blue gaze on Kayla.
STRYKER (cont'd)
Don't worry, my sweet. You're one
of the good ones. I'll protect you.
He and Collins exit the room, leaving Kayla alone with her
misery.

Logan sits panting in the chair, gripping the ends of the arm
rests with white fingers, waiting for the next surge of
electricity. It comes and he arches again, all the muscles in
his body contracting, the veins in his neck bulging.
Cornelius and his assistant watch Logan with no detectable
sympathy. They turn when Kayla walks into the room.
KAYLA
Is he clean yet?
Cornelius and the assistant face front again..
CORNELIUS
He's stronger than I thought. We
could be here all night..
Kayla watches Logan in his agony. A glimmer of remorse passes
over her face.
KAYLA
He was good to me.
Cornelius, fiddling with the amperage dial, curls his lips in
a sardonic smile.
CORNELIUS
You have a funny way of showing
your gratitude.
Logan thrashes in his chair. Kayla chews her lip. For a long
count she watches Logan suffer.

Kayla steps into the room. Logan sits slumped motionless in
the electric chair. She detaches the copper halo. The skin
beneath the metal is singed but it quickly begins to heal.
Kayla stares at the man she betrayed, hesitates for a moment
and exhales.
She unfastens the titanium manacles. Logan is still
unconscious. Kayla shakes him gently.

Logan opens his eyes. He is clearly disoriented, as if waking

Logan stares at her, groggy and confused.

Creed rears back to hammer Kayla, a blow that would separate
her head from her body.
Logan catches Creed's fist inches from Kayla's face.

Time you quit picking on girls.
VICTOR CREED
Oh, I'm happy picking on men.
Creed swings at Logan's head, Logan ducks, and the fight
begins.
This is melee so efficient that no motion is wasted. Every
lunge would kill any other adversary. Every parried blow
would shatter a normal man's arm.
Kayla, bleeding from the nose, staggers to her feet. She
helps up Hines and pushes her toward the door.
KAYLA
Get out of here.
Hines doesn't have to be told twice. She flees. Creed sees
his plaything running out the door. He snarls in frustration.
VICTOR CREED
You're ruining my party.
He grabs hold of Logan and hurls him headfirst through the
cell wall-- a concrete support wall.

Logan crashes to the floor, covered in rubble. Creed steps
out of the cell, licking his fangs.
Creed tries to stomp Logan's face, but the smaller man rolls
out of the way and gets back on his feet.
The mutants battle down the corridor, claws whistling through
the air.
A team of SENTRIES charge around the corner, wearing tactical
armor and carrying XM8 assault rifles. They level their
rifles at the battling mutants.
SENTRY #1

Logan and Creed, trying to punch holes in each other, ignore
the sentries. Kayla, staring down the barrels of the big
guns,. holds up her hands.
She concentrates, staring into the sentries' eyes.

The sentries' hostility shifts into apologetic obeisance.

The sentries wave cheerfully and depart.
Creed and Logan are equally skilled, but Creed's superior

The big man groans. Logan spins Creed around, jamming him
against the wall. He tries to skewer Creed with the claws of
his right hand but Creed moves his head at the last moment.
Logan's claws are buried to the hilt-in the wall. He strikes
at Creed with his left hand, but Creed dodges again. All six
of Logan's claws are deep in the solid rock wall.
He brings his hands. together, the adamantium blades slicing
through granite as if it were cheesecake.
Creed ducks under the claws an instant before they shred him.
He grabs Logan in a-bear hug.
A large section of the wall behind them falls out, and,
unable to halt their momentum, Logan and Creed tumble through
the hole, disappearing from sight.
Kayla runs over and stands at the jagged precipice, looking
out onto the gargantuan Weapon XI cavern.
Logan and Creed fall seventy feet, clawing at each other in

Logan hits the floor hard, the impact blasting a small crater

Creed pounces on Logan, who is still severely injured from
the fall. Creed tears into the smaller man mercilessly,
slinging him around the cavern, gouging him with his black

Creed batters Logan with a series of savage blows. Logan

Creed plants one heavy black boot on Logan's face and presses
down hard. He leers at his defeated foe.

Something changes within Logan, a fury so overwhelming it

Whirling, slashing, stabbing, kicking, Logan scythes a circle
of devastation, spray-painting the floor with the black blood
of the Eleven.
He reaches a third pillar and chops through it.
Kayla eyes the ceiling nervously and hurries toward the exit.
STRYKER (cont'd)
STOP HIM, YOU IDIOTS! STOP HIM!
Even Logan can't hold back the tide for long. Talons rake his
face, his arms, his chest. But still he battles, slicing
through a fourth pillar, a fifth.
Tremendous fissures split the rock ceiling. Dust and rocks
fall onto the cavern floor as the fissures widen.
Logan sees that the cavern's collapse is imminent. He can no
longer hold off the Eleven's assault.
An instant before the clones can shred him, he jumps, using
his claws to scale one of the still-standing steel pillars
with the grace and speed of a leopard climbing a tree.
One of the clones follows, using his black talons in the same
fashion, grabbing at Logan's feet.
When Logan is forty feet above the throng of teeth-gnashing
clones, he severs the pillar below his feet. The clone
chasing him can climb no farther, can do nothing but roar and
hiss at his escaping prey.
Logan swings himself onto the steel staircase, where Kayla
waits beside the open door. He races up the stairs.
Stryker sees his dream in ruins. He runs for the nearest
exit.
Kayla and Logan are a few feet from the door, from safety,
when the cavern ceiling gives out. Thousands of tons of stone
and steel come crashing down.
Logan grabs Kayla and hauls her to safety an instant before
she would be crushed.
99.
