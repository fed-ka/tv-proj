A dark, rumbling sky. Haze clings to the lake as we float
across it, clearing to bring the opposite shoreline into
view. A few scattered streetlights. Dilapidated cabins.
An abandoned campsite. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE.
We continue to drift towards it, hearing the faint sound
of seductive music and an occasional giggle. A small
HOUSEBOAT floats into our foreground, its interior light
flickering as TWO BODIES move around inside.
as Jim tosses a small anchor overboard.
TIGHT ON WATER SURFACE
as the weighty object splashes, sinking into black
oblivion, pulling its cable down with it.
JIM
glances at the lake, at their eerie surroundings. He
feels a chill, heading back inside.
as the anchor drifts to the lake bottom, dropping a few
feet from a THICK POWER CABLE which rests in the lake
silt.
as the anchor drifts along the lake floor, tugging hard
on the power cable. Camera TRACKS along the cable,
coming to a RUSTY SET OF CHAINS TANGLED AROUND IT.
as the chains emit a dull tinkle due to movement from the
tugging anchor. Camera continues to TRACK again...and we
find to our horror that the waterlogged, fish-eaten body
of JASON IS SECURED BY THESE SAME CHAINS. (NOTE: Jason's
face is obscured.)
The anchor tugs one last time and RIPS THROUGH THE CABLE.
SPARKS INSTANTLY FLY, chasing along the cable, finding
the chain which secures Jason and ENGULFING HIM IN
ELECTRICITY.
as BRIGHT FLASHES OF BLUE LIGHT strobe-under the surface.
ARCING CURRENT chases up the anchor cable, sparking
across the hoist.
as the electricity feeding the streetlights is abruptly
extinguished, plunging the campsite into darkness.
as the cable smolders, void of electricity now. TRACK to
find the chains again...but they're dangling loosely.
JASON IS GONE.
sitting dormant on the deck, where Jim tossed it. A
SHADOW FALLS ACROSS IT...followed by a SLIMY, DECOMPOSING
HAND. The hand grabs it like it's an old friend, pulling
it away.
A deadly-sharp SPEAR GUN rests in its rack outside the
cabin. JASON'S HAND REMOVES IT.
as the HOUSEBOAT silently drifts onward. The lone
silhouette of Jason emerges from within, taking the helm.
He's back.
FADE OUT/MAIN CREDITS.
FADE IN:
Only the faintest sign of daylight can be seen through a
thick blanket of gray fog. In the distance, speckled
lights outlining a smaller LUXURY CRUISE SHIP
intermittently appear.
Standing at the boarding ramp is CHARLES MCCULLOCH,
clipboard in hand. He's just finished checking off a pair
of new-agey SENIOR GIRLS. McCulloch is approaching fifty,
wearing a tie and unwrinkled clothes, as well as the
disposition of a stern puritan.
MCCULLOCH
Remember girls, the shuffleboard
tournament will start at six p.m.
sharp. A non-attendance will restrict
your time in port, understood?
They nod for his benefit, exchanging derogatory whispers
as they head up the ramp. Camera ADJUSTS to find a small
parking lot adjacent to the docks, where several cars are
just now arriving -- parents dropping off their high
school seniors, hugging them bon voyage.
CLOSER ANGLE PARKING LOT
as SEAN ROBERTSON walks toward the ship with pal MILES
WOLFE. Sean's a tall, nice looking, somewhat serious guy;
Miles is shorter, athletic and more extroverted.
MILES
You're telling me this boat has a pool
with a three meter board?
SEAN
It's a ship and that's right. Plus a
disco, gym, game room and a lot more.
MILES
I think I'm gonna blow off New York
and just stay on this thing.
MCCULLOCH
You'll do no such thing, Mr. Wolfe...
Camera ADJUSTS to reveal McCulloch, holding his list,
checking off their names.
MCCULLOCH
Your itinerary has been carefully
planned and make no mistake, it will
be executed accordingly.
MILES
(under his breath)
Of course...wouldn't want to risk
enjoying this trip.
McCulloch gives him a frown. Sean steps up to him
tentatively.
SEAN
Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr.
McCulloch?
MCCULLOCH
Rennie's not coming.
He's devastated.
SEAN
But I thought...
MCCULLOCH
She changed her mind.
(eyeing list)
Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom
one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are
in two-twenty-five.
A booming VOICE from above interrupts them:
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON (O.S.)
Sean -- where the hell have you been?
We're already into early departure
protocol...
ANOTHER ANGLE
Standing on the upper deck is a no-nonsense, uniformed
Navy man, ADMIRAL ROBERTSON. The captain of the ship. And
Sean's father. Sean's sadness about Rennie's absence is
immediately replaced with anxiety.
SEAN
Be right up, Dad.
He and Miles head up the gangway, both boys giving
McCulloch one last glare.
as Tamara tries to slip past McCulloch, busy with another
pair of seniors.
MCCULLOCH
You can stop right there, Miss Mason.
He motions the others onward. Busted. Tamara instantly
hands Eva her drug-filled purse, paralyzing Eva.
MCCULL40CH
Only graduating seniors are allowed on
this cruise.
TAMARA
What are you talking about?
MCCULLOCB
You never turned in your final biology
project, so I've had your diploma
rescinded.
TAMARA
You can't do that...
MCCULLOCH
It's already been done.
(turning to Eva)
Congratulations on the 3.9 average,
Miss Watanabe. You're in stateroom two-
fifty-five.
Eva smiles awkwardly, reaching for her luggage, stalling
to see what happens with Tamara.
TAMARA
Look, Mr. McCulloch, I got in a car
accident yesterday and missed our
appointment. It's okay, no big deal,
just a bruised arm...
(squeezes her arm)
...so I brought my project along
today. It's in my suitcase. Really.
He looks at her suitcase, not buying a word of this.
EVA
She's telling the truth, Mr.
McCulloch. I saw her pack it.
He's surprised to hear this...and so is Tamara.
MCCULLOCH
All right. But if it mysteriously
disappears en route, I'll have you
sent back home the minute we dock.
Understood?
TAMARA
Perfectly.
She grabs her purse back from Eva, quickly moving on
before he changes his mind. Their voices become whispers.
TAMARA
A major prick.
EVA
What are you going to do?
TAMARA
Improvise, of course.
as the HOUSEBOAT haphazardly bumps into barnacle-covered
dock pilings, still around fifty yards from the cruise
ship.
POINT OF VIEW OUT HOUSEBOAT WINDOW
The window is splattered with blood, but still clear
enough to make out Tamara and Eva walking up the gangway,
along with a half dozen other teenagers mingling on
board.
TIGHT ON HOUSEBOAT'S ANCHOR CABLE
--or rather the remnants of it. It's a piece of frayed
woven metal charred by extreme electricity, severed just
above water level. Suddenly there's blurry movement
behind it; camera RACK FOCUSES just in time to catch a
glimpse of JASON SLIPPING OFF THE SIDE, FLOATING TOWARDS
THE PILINGS.
as McCulloch impatiently checks his watch and list again.
Miss Van Deusen walks up to him.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked
in?
MCCULLOCH
Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never
showed up. I'm a little concerned.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
Don't be. They probably decided to
explore each other rather than New
York.
He gives her a disdainful look, starting up the ramp.
MCCULLOCH
Let's go -- we're running two minutes
late.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
Charles, there's someone else coming
along too.
He stops, following her glance. His face tightens.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Rennie is walking toward them with a small suitcase, her
dog Toby striding next to her. She walks up to him,
starts to say something, then decides against it. Rennie
heads up the gangway. HOLD on McCulloch and Miss Van
Deusen. He's livid.
MCCULLOCH
You have no right...
MISS VAN DEUSEN
And neither do you. It's up to Rennie
to decide what she wants to do.
MCCULLOCH
She doesn't know what she wants. She's
never had a stable life.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
And she sure doesn't have one now,
either. She needs to live.
MCCULLOCH
I'm her legal guardian, not you or
anybody else, and I alone know what's
best for her. End of discussion.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
No, I think it's just the beginning.
She walks past him.
as she reaches the top of the gangway, her heart
pounding. Rennie pauses, working up the courage to look
out at the lake again.
RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW
The ROWBOAT she saw earlier is still there, even closer
now.
RENNIE'S PUPILS
contract, her blood pumping faster. Then she hears a
FAINT VOICE BELOW HER...
VOICE (O.S.)
Hhhhelp me...
Rennie looks straight down at the water beneath her and
sees:
AN EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY
floundering in the water. It takes us only a moment to
recognize him -- IT'S YOUNG JASON. He's gasping, sucking
in huge amounts of liquid, exactly like he did in the
prologue.
YOUNG JASON
Hhhhelp me....I'm drowning...
RENNIE
leans back in terror, falling into Miss Van Deusen.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
What's wrong, Rennie??
Rennie frantically points over the ramp edge, unable to
speak. Miss Van Deusen quickly looks and sees:
MISS VAN DEUSEN'S POINT OF VIEW
The water is calm. No Young Jason.
RETURN TO SHOT
as Rennie gets a hold of herself.
RENNIE
I just got a little dizzy. I'm fine.
She continues up the ramp. HOLD on Miss Van Deusen,
watching her go, somewhat troubled by it. RACK to
McCulloch below her, also watching. Extremely concerned.
RENNIE
continues along the starboard side, not risking another
glance overboard. She passes an older, very deranged DECK
HAND, mopping the deck. HOLD on him, his bloodshot eyes
following her like a crazed raven.
as he continues away, his retreat blocked by the DECK
HAND. The crazy old man pierces a dead serious stare at
Sean.
DECK HAND
This voyage is doomed.
SEAN
Yeah, tell me about it.
Sean sidesteps him, moving on.
Parents and relatives wave gleefully from the docks as
CAMERA RISES AND ROTATES to find eighteen or so teenagers
1ining the upper deck, happily waving back. The ship
begins to slice through serene water. The voyage has
begun.
CLOSER ON HULL
The water begins to ripple as the ship's speed increases.
All seems normal...until JASON'S HANDS APPEAR, CLINGING
TO A LOOSE MOORING LINE DRAGGING IN THE WATER. He
slithers up the side towards the deck as dense fog
breezes past him.
as Sean continues along, hands in pockets. He turns a
corner and collides with RENNIE, walking her dog. His
eyes instantly brighten, as do hers.
SEAN
Rennie...
RENNIE
Hi, Sean.
SEAN
I heard you weren't coming.
RENNIE
(glances at Toby)
We changed our minds.
Sean pats her dog. There's an awkward pause...they are
obviously in the early stages-of a relationship.
Sean reaches into his coat pocket, bringing back a small
necklace-sized box.
SEAN
I got you a present.
RENNIE
But I didn't get you one...
SEAN
Forget it. It's a dumb little thing
anyway.
Rennie opens it up, exposing a petite silver necklace
with a Statue of Liberty pendant on it. She's touched.
RENNIE
Sean...it's beautiful.
Sean takes it from her, snapping it around her neck.
SEAN
I thought maybe we could hike to the
top of the Statue when we got there,
if you felt like it. It's supposed to
be 22 stories tall.
RENNIE
I'd love to.
MCCULLOCH (O.S.)
Your father was looking for you, Mr.
Robertson.
McCulloch appears behind them. The mood has been broken.
SEAN
I guess I'll see you later.
Sean leaves. McCulloch steps up to Rennie, pointing out
to the foggy sea. Her respiration increases as she
psyches herself up to look.
MCCULLOCH
There's a storm predicted tonight.
Rennie looks at the ocean, forcing herself not to turn
away.
MCCULLOCH
You're making a big mistake, Rennie.
It's not too late to put you back on
land.
RENNIE
I'm staying.
MCCULLOCH
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you
were of...
RENNIE
She didn't push me into coming.
MCCULLOCH
Why are you doing this to yourself?
RENNIE
I don't even know why I'm afraid,
Uncle Charles. I can't even remember
when it started. Don't you think it's
time I found out and got over it?
He takes a measured pause.
MCCULLOCH
Facing your fear doesn't always
conquer it.
RENNIE
I'm staying.
He's not going to change her mind.
P.O.V. - RENNIE AND MCCULLOCH (B & W/VIEWFINDER MATTE)
through a porthole window...and through the viewfinder
of a video camcorder. McCulloch shakes his head, turning
away from Rennie and walking away. A sinister electric
guitar solo screeches out. PAN with McCulloch as he
passes the window, coming around 180 degrees into a CLOSE
UP of J.J. JARRETT, fingering a sleek Gibson "Flying V."
J.J.
(into camera)
Is this axe awesome or what?
as J.J.'s SCREAM echoes from an exhaust duct. WHIP PAN to
find the crazed DECK HAND standing just below it,
reacting with dread. He's the only one who has heard it.
as the Deck Hand flinches upon the thick, dull sound of
her demise, followed by discordant feedback from her
guitar...and eventual silence. He reaches into his breast
pocket, his hand shaking badly as he sips from a flask of
Early Times.
as LIGHTNING FLASHES over a gray, choppy sea. A storm is
imminent. The Princess Ruby finally appears, cutting
through whitecaps, no land in sight.
CLOSE UP - INK DIP PEN
as Rennie's hand carefully dips it in India ink, moving
to a blank page in her journal. She hesitates for several
beats.
Wind is picking up, sweeping thick mist past a row of
decorative flags. One of them flaps back...AND EXPOSES
JASON.
THROUGH JASON'S EYES (FLYING WALL EFX)
as the flag whips our faces. We MOVE through it, down the
empty passageway, coming to a porthole window. Rennie's
window. We peer through it with unnerving intensity at
the backside of Rennie as she pulls off her T-shirt,
slipping on the blouse. Camera continues through the
tiny round window, floating across the room, over Toby
and the bed...until we're INCHES FROM THE BACK OF
RENNIE'S HEAD. She suddenly spins around in fright,
facing us point-blank, and:
REVERSE ANGLE
Nobody is there, her porthole window empty. But there's
something surreal about the window...
TIGHT ON PORTHOLE WINDOW (EFX)
Empty grayness...then EIGHT YEAR OLD JASON FLOATS UP FROM
BELOW, BUBBLES ESCAPING FROM HIS LIPS. The porthole has
become a window into the depths of Crystal Lake.
RENNIE
feels her throat catch with terror and an instant later:
DOG TOBY
begins to bark vociferously, rushing to her cabin door,
scratching to get out.
RENNIE'S EYES
are distracted to Toby for a second; when she looks back
at the porthole, she sees:
AN EMPTY WINDOW
No water, no drowning boy.
RENNIE
snaps out of it, moving to the door, where her dog is
frantically clawing with his fur up.
RENNIE
Okay Toby, calm down...
She's talking to herself as much as the dog. Rennie
closes the curtains on her window, then steps to her
door. She swings the door open for Toby...and exposes
an empty hall. Toby scrapes his way out of the room,
dashing off down the hall, snarling.
as they walk along the edge of the pool.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
So, are you having fun yet?
RENNIE
(lying)
Yeah...a lot.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
I seem to detect a hint of
ingenuousness in your tone.
(beat)
In other words, level with me.
RENNIE
(a pause)
There's something I haven't told
you...
...But before she can begin the next sentence, Rennie is
shoved from behind.
WATER ANGLE
as she SPLASHES INTO THE POOL'S DEEP END.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
spins around, seeing Tamara standing there with Eva.
TAMARA
Wow, sorry...
RENNIE
flounders at the surface, nobody realizing the terror
she's experiencing. She's too scared to even cry for
help.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
isn't looking at Rennie, her attention on admonishing
Tamara.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
Why on earth would you do something
like that?
TAMARA
It was an accident, I swear...
Eva avoids eye contact, feeling awful. Sean comes walking
up, seeing Rennie.
SEAN
What happened?
(to Rennie)
Rennie, are you okay?
RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW
She's can't even hear Sean, her vision being splashed by
the chlorinated water. She sinks under the surface,
turning around...AND COMING FACE TO FACE WITH YOUNG
JASON. The eight year-old corpse GRABS HER ANKLE AND
TRIES TO DRAG HER DOWN.
SEAN'S POINT OF VIEW
as Rennie sinks under the surface, all alone, thrashing
in terror.
SEAN
realizes she's in trouble. He immediately dives in after
her, pulling her to the pool's edge, where Miss Van
Deusen helps to lift her out.
TAMARA AND EVA
quickly move on.
TAMARA
That was truly excellent.
EVA
(feels like shit)
Yeah.
TAMARA
Time to check out the waiters.
EVA
I think I'll pass. See you later,
okay?
TAMARA
But...wait a minute!
Eva walks away. Tamara acts angry, but deep down she's
hurt.
TAMARA
Some friend you are.
as Sean climbs from the pool to join Miss Van Deusen, who
is trying to comfort Rennie.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
(to Sean)
Bring her a towel, okay?
Sean nods, hurrying off as others start to crowd around.
Miss Van Deusen looks up at them.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
She's fine -- everybody go back to
what you were doing.
They disperse. Rennie slowly starts to cry, holding tight
to her teacher.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
Care to talk about it?
After a moment to compose herself...
RENNIE
I can't swim.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
I gathered that.
Rennie says nothing else. Miss Van Deusen knows she's
holding out.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
I had a skiing accident in high
school, broke my left leg. It took
three winters before I would even look
at the snow again...but the solution
kept eluding me.
(beat)
I finally took lessons. I've never
broken a bone since.
RENNIE
It's not that simple.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
Maybe not. But you're not telling me
everything, are you?
RENNIE
(long pause)
Whenever I get near the water, I see
this young boy drowning. He tries to
pull me down with him.
The teacher didn't expect this, taking a thoughtful
pause.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
When did this start?
RENNIE
About four years ago...at Crystal
Lake. I spent a few summers there with
Uncle Charles inbetween boarding
school.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
After your parents passed away?
Rennie nods somberly.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
Did you have an accident in the lake?
RENNIE
No. It was just a normal summer. I've
never been able to figure it out.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
Only one young boy ever drowned in
that lake, and that was before you
were even born. His name was Jason
Voorhees.
The name has triggered some deep memory...but the
recollection vanishes upon the sound of her uncle's
voice.
MCCULLOCH (O.S.)
Dear God...
ANOTHER ANGLE
as McCulloch rushes over to Rennie, seeing that she's
soaked. He's livid.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
She's fine, Charles. Take it easy...
MCCULLOCH
Oh, I can see that. You've done a
wonderful job of supervising the kids,
Miss Van Deusen.
RENNIE
It wasn't her fault.
He gets Rennie to her feet just as Sean runs back with a
towel. McCulloch grabs it from him, wrapping it around
his niece, facing both Miss Van Deusen and Sean.
MCCULLOCH
Stay away from her...both of you.
He starts to lead her away. The crazy DECK HAND blocks
their path, slipping his flask away.
DECK HAND
He's come back and you're all going to
die.
Rennie gazes at the Deck Hand, then back at McCulloch.
RENNIE
Just...leave me alone...
She pulls away from him, hurrying off, confused and
frightened. McCulloch's retinas pierce the Deck Hand with
scorn. He checks his watch, then storms off.
as we approach Tamara's porthole window, peering through
it. We can't hear the words but we can clearly see the
people.
as we approach her door, still cracked open from
McCulloch's entrance. We get there just in time to see
Tamara slip her arms around McCulloch, planting her lips
on his, pressing her nubile flesh up against his stiffly
starched shirt.
as Rennie comes rushing out, right into the arms of.
Sean. She clings to him, sobbing as the rain falls over
them.
SEAN
It's okay...you're going to be okay.
RENNIE
I want to go home. I want off this
ship.
After a moment...
SEAN
Me too.
(beat)
Let's go talk to my Dad.
He puts his arm around her, leading her toward the
bridge.
Miles is toweling off under the shelter of a gazebo as
Sean's voice blares out of a rain-pounded megaphone
speaker nearby.
SEAN (V.O.)
There's been...
(swallows)
What I mean is, this is an
emergency...
Miles knows he can't be joking around. Wayne comes
walking by, covering his camcorder with his jacket.
WAYNE
Miles -- have you seen J.J.? She was
supposed to be jamming down in the
power room but...
Miles gestures for him to be quiet, listening very
worriedly.
SEAN (V.O.)
Repeat, this is an emergency...
The wooden shuffleboard disks are drowning in
precipitation. Eva stands alone in the rain, staring at
the court as Sean's voice continues.
SEAN (V.O.)
Stay calm, but get here as quick as
possible. Walk with a friend if you
can...
Eva wipes the rain from her face, then walks away.
as a COAST GUARD CUTTER tracks through stormy seas.
RADIO OFFICER (V.O.)
This is Coast Guard cutter Dallas.
What is the nature of your problem,
Ruby?
as LIGHTNING STRIKES above it in the night sky. Camera
slowly ADJUSTS to find the RADIO ANTENNA CABLE. A second
later, JASON'S HAND REACHES FOR IT, GETTING A FIRM GRASP.
as Jason drops the cable he's just torn out, marching
onward.
as McCulloch bursts onto the bridge, followed by Miss Van
Deusen.
MCCULLOCH
I demand to know what is going on...
MISS VAN DEUSEN
Oh dear God...
She's seen the bodies. McCulloch follows her glance,
paling. He quickly takes charge, pushing through the
students.
MCCULLOCH
Where's the radio?
SEAN
It's...dead.
DECK HAND (O.S.)
You're all going to die.
All heads spin as the deranged DECK HAND treads out from
a shadowy corridor.
DECK HAND
You're the last ones. He's come back
for you.
MCCULLOCH
What are you talking about?
The Deck Hand takes a final swig from his flask, dropping
it with unsteady hands.
DECK HAND
Jason Voorhees.
There is a collective, disconcerting silence triggered by
the infamous name.
MCCULLOCH
You're insane, old man. Jason Voorhees
has been dead for over thirty years.
DECK HAND
He walks this ship, here and now.
MCCULLOCH
A killer walks this ship indeed. And
it's certainly none of us...
The crazed old man gets his drift. Everyone looks at him
suspiciously. McCulloch grabs a SCALING KNIFE off the
wall, taking a step towards him.
DECK HAND
You're the one who's insane!!
The raving man flees back the way he came. McCulloch
raises the flare gun; Miss Van Deusen grabs McCulloch's
arm, stopping him.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
What are you doing??
MCCULLOCH
That lunatic has been spouting off
about Jason since we boarded...
(eyeing bodies)
It's no coincidence.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
But that doesn't prove that he's the
one!
MCCULLOCH
Walking corpses are not real!
JULIUS
Yeah, well these dead bodies are sure
enough real.
(to the others)
I say we regroup and find this
motherfucker before he finds us.
There's a murmur; it makes sense.
MCCULLOCH
You'll do no.such thing and watch your
mouth, young man! I'm in charge here!
They all look at McCulloch defiantly.
JULIUS
School's out, McCulloch.
(to the others)
Let's go.
Julius walks off the bridge; all the seniors follow
except Sean.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
Please everybody, stay here!!
They don't listen. McCulloch starts to go after
them...and then it hits him:
MCCULLOCH
Christ...where's Rennie??
SEAN
She's...she's dropping the anchors. I
thought the Coast Guard could find us
easier if...
MCCULLOCH
What?? You sent her out there with a
murderer running around loose??
as Rennie moves past wet, empty lounge chairs towards the
bow. She passes a row of translucent windows. The first
three are normal...but the fourth has the SILHOUETTE OF
JASON ON ITS OPPOSITE SIDE.
He begins to stride parallel to her, then disappears
when the windows end and a wall takes over.
as Rennie appears, fighting the wind and rain to get
closer to the anchor hoists.
POINT OF VIEW THROUGH DECK WINDOW - SAME TIME
--spying on Rennie like a wolf watching a lamb. We MOVE a
few windows down, getting a better view of her.
REVERSE ANGLE - ON JASON
deciding that the time is right to strike. His hand moves
to the bow entrance door knob, slowly turning it, pulling
it open.
moving closer to the right anchor hoist, her back to us
as well as Jason. She climbs behind the hoist, looking at
the consoles. Then suddenly a BARK.
RENNIE
Toby?
She turns, catching a glimpse of her dog running down the
side of the deck. Rennie leaves the hoist, going after
Toby.
JASON'S POINT OF VIEW
through the crack in the door, watching Rennie
unexpectedly take off. He's about to move after her when
ha hears:
EVA (O.S.)
Tamara? Are you around here anywhere?
Jason quietly closes the door. Rennie will have to wait.
Rennie appears again, scanning her no-visibility
surroundings.
RENNIE
Toby? Where'd you go?
No sign of her dog. She remembers her mission, heading to
the anchors again.
as Rennie arrives on the bow, climbing into the left
hoist box behind the huge anchor cable.
STALKING POINT OF VIEW
moving up to the bow door like Jason did before, cracking
it open, seeing Rennie from behind. And moving towards
her.
RENNIE
is oblivious as she reads the directions above the
controls.
INSERT - HOIST LEVER (SECOND UNIT)
as Rennie's hand grabs it, shoving it forward.
INSERT - GREEN HOIST BUTTON (SECOND UNIT)
A moment later, her thumb finds it and depresses it.
INSERT - ANCHOR CHAIN (SECOND UNIT)
as the massive black chain links thunder to life.
STALKING POINT OF VIEW
He's now within ten feet of the unaware girl.
RENNIE
remains in the hoist box, making certain it is operating
correctly. A second later, we see the fleeting outline of
a HUMAN SHAPE appear behind her.
STALKING POINT OF VIEW
Three feet from Rennie. She spins around to climb out of
the hoist box and GASPS.
REVERSE ANGLE
She's facing MCCULLOCH. He immediately reaches past her,
yanking the lever back to its center position, and:
THE ANCHOR CHAIN (SECOND UNIT)
grinds to a halt.
RETURN TO SHOT
as McCulloch faces her, angrily grabbing Rennie's arms,
shouting over the storm.
MCCULLOCH
You had me worried to death!
RENNIE
But Sean said...
MCCULLOCH
I'm the one you should be listening
to! Do you think dropping an anchor in
the middle of a storm makes any sense
whatsoever?
She tries to find some defense, but McCulloch leads her
off before any wards come forth.
CLOSE UP - EXERCISE MAT
as a pair of SKEET RIFLES, three FIRE AXES, a FLARE GUN
and several POOL CUES are dumped onto the foam padded
plastic.
as it slams open...and JULIUS steps out, not Sean, from a
different deck door. TRACK with him as he treads along
the side of the ship, skeet rifle raised.
JULIUS' POINT OF VIEW
walking past the lifeboat stations, the wind and
precipitation battering the small boats. With no warning,
AN OBSCURE FIGURE LEAPS OUT, GRIPPING AN AXE.
JULIUS
shoves the gun stock into his shoulder and takes
instantaneous aim...but he doesn't shoot. He slowly
lowers the rifle.
ANOTHER ANGLE
as MILES lowers the axe. They've just scared the shit out
of each other.
MILES
I'll take the upper deck.
Julius nods. They separate. Neither boy notices the
smoke which is starting to emerge from a deck vent...
--steaming and far from calm as the weather blitzes it.
Miles appears, climbing a ladder to the upper deck level.
POINT OF VIEW THROUGH LADDER
Someone is spying on Miles from below, watching his every
step.
as Miles arrives, axe raised. He pauses to regard his
surroundings, then moves on. RACK FOCUS TO FIND JASON
RIGHT BEHIND HIM, having followed Miles up the stairs.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Only darkness and rain for a beat, then Miles
materializes, curving around the gargantuan smokestack.
He passes us and we SWING AROUND, now looking at the back
of his head. He takes three more steps and JASON STEPS
INTO THE FOREGROUND. Miles senses his presence and JERKS
AROUND, RAISING THE AXE, BRINGING IT DOWN ON JASON'S
HEAD...
...but Jason easily grabs the axe handle before it makes
contact, flinging it away.
He's pacing along when a clattering noise from above
makes him stop. Suddenly MILES' AXE THUDS INTO THE
MAHOGANY DECK NEXT TO HIS FOOT. Julius gazes at it,
jerking his head upward.
JULIUS
Miles??
His answer is a LOUD CRACK OF LIGHTNING. At the same
time:
RUNNING WITH MILES
He's scrambling as fast as he can across the slippery
deck as the monster relentlessly pursues him.
JASON'S POINT OF VIEW
He's having no problem catching up to the defenseless
teenager.
as Julius zooms up them to aid his comrade.
as Miles slides up to the mast and begins scaling it. He
glances downward and sees:
MILES' POINT OF VIEW
Jason is right at his heels.
MILES
slips on a rung, regains control, and continues upward.
He makes it three more steps, almost at the uppermost
point when JASON GRABS THE BACK OF HIS COAT, TEARING HIM
OFF THE MAST.
STUNT FREEFALL
Miles cries out as he FREEFALLS BACKWARDS, somersaulting
and twisting like he's doing one of his better dives...
CLOSE UP - MILES' FACE
...Empty space for a half-second, then MILES' FACE JOLTS
INTO FRAME with a look of ultimate agony. Something has
abruptly stopped his fall. Something quite fatal.
coming around a corner, stopping dead in his tracks, his
stomach wrenching as his eyes fall on:
MILES (EFX)
...who is staring right back at him with dead pupils.
MILES HAS BEEN HORRIBLY IMPALED OM A SHIP FLAGPOLE.
JULIUS
doesn't get the chance to grasp the reality of it because
JASON'S HAND GRIPS HIS SHOULDER, SPINS HIM AROUND AND
SLUGS HIM SQUARELY IN THE FACE. The force of it sends the
boxer REELING BACKWARDS OFF THE RAILING...
...and Julius SPLASHES INTO THE ROUGH SEA. He's quickly
swallowed by the torrential waters.
as a huge HOLE is blown through the thick steel hull:
as a door opens and Miss Van Deusen guides a half-dozen
SENIORS over to the LIFEBOAT STATIONS.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
(shouting over storm)
Everybody climb in!
They follow her orders as the Abandon Ship alarm wretches
on. But little do they know that:
STALKING POINT OF VIEW
Someone is briskly moving towards the group and Miss Van
Deusen. Just as we are within a few feet of her...
REVERSE ANGLE
--It's MCCULLOCH who's approached them. He grabs Miss Van
Deusen, shaking her violently.
MCCULLOCH
What did you do with Rennie??
MISS VAN DEUSEN
Nothing! I went to her cabin and...
McCulloch rushes off before she can finish. Miss Van
Deusen turns back to the other kids, helping them into
the boat.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
Everybody hurry...please...
We slowly DOLLY BACKWARDS until Miles' AXE comes into
frame, still stuck in the mahogany decking. A beat, then
JASON'S HALAL DISLODGES IT FROM THE WOOD.
as Miss Van Deusen throws the "down" lever and the
lifeboat hoist begins to lower the boat. Camera SLOWLY
CREEPS IN A SEMI-CIRCLE AS A SILHOUETTED FIGURE STEPS
INTO A POOL OF LIGHT BEHIND HER. JASON.
ANGLE - LIFEBOAT
One of the students screams, the others clinging together
upon the sight of this infamous monster. But the boat is
already over the edge, past the point of return. And
lowering at a snail's pace.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
turns to see JASON APPROACHING THEM WITH AXE RAISED. She
backs away but Jason ignores her, heading directly for
the hoist. He arches back with his weapon and SLICES
DOWNWARD.
INSERT - HOIST CABLE (SECOND UNIT)
as Jason's axe CHOPS THE CABLE IN TWO, and:
The bow cable SNAPS, DUMPING THE HALF DOZEN TEENAGERS
INTO THE TURBULENT SALT WATER. They last about five
seconds before succumbing to a drowning death.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
sees it all, her intestines constricting in agonizing
knots. She summons all her rationale and sends it down to
her legs, running away as fast as she can.
MISS VAN DEUSEN'S POINT OF VIEW
--knocking down deck tables, chairs and chaise lounges as
she flees. The creative writing teacher swerves around a
column, heading for an interior door, sliding to a stop
as it BANGS OPEN IN FRONT OF HER. McCulloch steps
outside, carrying Rennie, with Sean right behind her.
Rennie is conscious now, squirming free of her uncle upon
the sight of Miss Van Deusen.
ANGLE TO INCLUDE ALL
as Rennie rushes into Miss Van Deusen's arms. The teacher
holds her, beginning to cry herself.
MCCULLOCH
Why aren't you with the others,
woman??
Finally the message comes forth:
MISS VAN DEUSEN
Jason...he has an axe...
His face grows taut with anger.
MCCULLOCH
Jason Voorhees is dead!!
A PRIMAL SCREAM OF AGONY immediately cries out behind
them, the words unintelligible. They turn around to
witness THE DECK HANG STAGGERING TOWARDS THEM, GRIPPING
THE KITCHEN KNIFE.
MCCULLOCH
raises the flare gun with zero hesitation and FIRES IT...
ANGLE - DECK HAND (EFX)
...and the charge EXPLODES INTO HIS CHEST. He stands
there with his chest smoldering, almost like a gargoyle
in effigy. A second later the poor old man falls forward,
and:
CLOSE ON HIS BACK (EFX)
They all see that JASON'S AXE HAS BEEN BURIED IN HIS
BACK.
RETURN TO MASTER
McCulloch gazes with utter disbelief.
MCCULLOCH
Dear Christ...
SEAN
We have to get off this ship!!
They back away from the horrid sight and begin to run,
the Abandon Ship alarm still attacking their ears.
as McCulloch, Miss Van Deusen, Rennie and Sean scramble
to the closest lifeboat.
SEAN
Everybody in -- I'll get the hoists
McCulloch has no time for politeness, moving to the
lifeboat ahead of the women. Rennie stops cold, gazing
classy-eyed at the small boat.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
Come on, sweetheart -- get in...
But she doesn't budge. McCulloch levels wild eyes on her,
quickly climbing back down.
MCCULLOCH
Get in the boat, Rennie!
RENNIE
I...I can't...
MCCULLOCH
(shaking her)
You can and you will!!
He tries to slap her out of it, dragging her over to the
boat, ignoring her terror-stricken frenzy.
SEAN
Stop it!!
MISS VAN DEUSEN
Leave her alone, Charles!
Miss Van Deusen quickly moves to a hysterical Rennie and
holds her, eyeing McCulloch vehemently.
as rain begins to wash the blood from his back. JASON'S
FOOT TRUDGES INTO FRAME...then his HAND REACHES DOWN,
RETRIEVING HIS AXE FROM THE DECK HAND'S SPINE.
as Rennie clings to	 Miss Van Deusen, crying.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
It's the only way, Rennie. Let's get
in the boat now, okay? Please...for
me?
Rennie finds herself nodding. Miss Van Deusen helps the
trembling girl up the steps, an angered McCulloch right
behind.
just as a huge BOLT OF LIGHTNING cracks over the smoke
stack and upper deck. JASON steps out from behind it,
gaping down on them with frightening omnipresence.
Gripping the bloody axe.
Sean climbs in the boat as it continues to lower. He
takes one look back at the ship and sees:
JASON
rapidly moving down the staircase towards them. Sean's
view is CUT OFF as the lifeboat sinks below deck level.
RETURN TO SHOT
as Sean's eyes dart around, down to the sea, up at the
hoist.
SEAN
Come on...faster....
JASON'S POINT OF VIEW
trampling towards the hoist, about thirty feet away now.
The boat has already disappeared over the edge.
as the lifeboat continues to lower, about ten feet from
making contact with the tumultuous ocean. The ship's hull
is crooked and sinking.
TRACKING WITH JASON
as he relentlessly moves to the hoist cable, raising his
axe.
as the ship finally touches water, and:
INSERT - HOIST CABLE (SECOND UNIT
Jason's axe blade CHOPS THE CABLE...
...and the hoist cable falls limply over them. Jason's
too late. Sean looks up and sees:
JASON
standing by the hoist, hovering over the edge. Very
angry.
SEAN (TANK)
grabs an oar, turning back to McCulloch.
SEAN
Start rowing!!
McCulloch takes the oar as Miss Van Deusen holds onto
Rennie tightly, the girl's eyes squeezed shut. Sean looks
up at the ship again, and:
SEAN'S POINT OF VIEW
Jason is none.
Sean looks around with confusion as huge waves, wind and
rain pummel them.
SEAN
He's gone...
POINT OF VIEW FROM WATER (TANK)
...or is he? We're moving towards the lifeboat at water
level, almost like a shark preparing for attack.
The ship is gone now, the lifeboat a speck in the ocean.
as the lifeboat rows into frame, the water relatively
calm.
as the sound of Julius' voice grows fainter. The water
begins to ripple...then the top half of a HOCKEY MASK
BREAKS THE SURFACE FOR A BREATH OF AIR, SINKING AGAIN.
And swimming onward.
as Julius and Sean row the lifeboat up to a narrow barge
beneath deserted dock warehouses. They are not in the
safest part of town by a longshot.
CLOSER ANGLE
as they climb onto the barge. Rennie breathes with relief
as she steps off the boat. She takes a final glance back
at it and sees:
YOUNG RENNIE
flailing her arms in the water right next to the
lifeboat, drowning.
YOUNG RENNIE
Hhhhelp...me....
Suddenly a DECOMPOSED HAND REACHES UP FROM BELOW,
GRABBING HER, DRAGGING HER UNDER.
She gazes in utter shock, screaming:
RENNIE
No!!!
They all follow her eyeline...but the water is calm,
nothing there.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
(holding her)
It's okay...you're safe now...
McCulloch grits his teeth.
MCCULLOCH
Come on -- everybody up the ladder.
He's the first one up. Sean looks at Rennie, concerned,
then hoists Toby up in his arms. They all begin climbing
the ladder.
CLOSE ON LADDER - NIGHT
as the last pair of feet disappear over the top edge of
the dock. Camera PANS back down the rungs, finding the
lifeboat and barge again. Suddenly JASON SPRINGS FROM THE
WATER, CLIMBING ONTO THE BARGE. He gazes up at his new
surroundings, quite different from all the years he's
spent at Crystal Lake. But an item at the far end of the
dock causes him the longest pause...
JASON'S POINT OF VIEW
A tattered billboard over one of the warehouses
advertises the NEW YORK RANGERS HOCKEY TEAM, featuring a
full shot of the HOCKEY-MASKED GOALIE.
JASON
looks at it long and hard. He tears off his life
preserver wits renewed ambition.
WIDE SHOT - BARGE AND DOCK WAREHOUSES - NIGHT
as Jason heads up the ladder. He's about to take
Manhattan.
as our survivors head into an isolated, foreboding group
of dock warehouses and alleys.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
There must be a phone around here
somewhere.
MCCULLOCH
A wonderful choice of places to dock a
boat, Mr. Robertson.
Sean looks away, trying to keep from losing his temper.
PREDATOR'S POINT OF VIEW - SAME TIME
We're spying on them from behind a stack of crates as
they come in our direction. Waiting for the right moment.
RETURN TO SHOT
as they move towards the stack of crates. Without
warning, a PAIR OF GANG BANGERS JUMP OUT, BOTH HOLDING
GUNS. Nervous young druggies.
GANG RANGER #1
Hands up!!
GANG BANGER #2
Do it!!
All hands go up. Gang Banger #2 grabs McCulloch's watch
and wallet, skimming through a wad of bills and credit
cards while #1 keeps them covered.
GANG BANGER #2
Got some good shit here, holmes.
GANG BANGER #1
(eyeing Rennie)
You got that right...
He steps over to Rennie, brushing her hair back with the
barrel of his revolver, spotting the Statue of Liberty
pendant Sean gave her.
GANG BANGER #L
Now ain't that sweet.
He tears it off her neck, pocketing it. Sean angrily
moves toward him and Gang Banger #l shoves the barrel
against Rennie's temple.
GANG BANGER #1
Go ahead, superman. Be a hero.
Sean has no choice but to freeze. Julius flexes his
fists, but he too has Gang Banger #2's gun leveled on
him. McCulloch stares at the thugs with obvious contempt.
It doesn't go unnoticed.
GANG BANGER #L
You got a problem, Dad?
McCulloch offers some rare silence, shaking a "no" to the
gun-toting kid. Rennie's dog-begins to growl, backing
away, ready to defend her. Gang Banger #1 points his
barrel at Toby with zero conscience, cocking back the
hammer.
RENNIE
No!
She pushes his arm to the side just as the bullet
FIRES...
ANGLE - TOBY
as the bullet tears up asphalt next to the dog's paws.
Toby sprints off into the darkness.
RETURN TO SHOT
Gang Banger #1 grabs Rennie by the hair, brutally jerking
her head back.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
Please, don't hurt her...
GANG BANGER #L
Hurt this princess?
(beat)
Would I do that?
They cough out laughs. Gang Banger #1 looks into Rennie's
eyes, his barrel still on her skin.
GANG BANGER #1
You look like a party girl, princess.
How'd you like to go on a date with me
and my friend? If you're free, that
is.
More phlegm-filled laughs. He drags her away, Gang Banger
#2 backing away with him with his gun still trained on
the others.
GANG BANGER #2
You follow and we'll blow her fuckin'
head off, comprende?
The others watch helplessly as Rennie is abducted.
JULIUS
We can't let those gang-bangers get
away, man...
Julius starts to move after them. McCulloch grabs him.
MCCULLOCH
You heard him! We have to call the
police
Julius jerks away from McCulloch's grasp. But he knows
McCulloch	is right.
MCCULLOCH
Everyone split up -- we'll cover more
ground that way.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
I don't think that's such a safe idea
MCCULLOCH
My niece's life hangs in the balance
right now!! Every second counts.
No more rebuttal. They hurry off.
It's a narrow passageway between warehouses...decrepit
brownstones with shattered chicken-wire windows, moss
growing on the bricks. The Gang Bangers appear with
Rennie, dragging her down some concrete steps.
GANG BANGER #L
Welcome to the casbah, princess.
PAN AROUND with them as they walk through a thick blanket
of STEAM which pours out of a factory vent. We MOVE
through the mist with them, revealing a tattered, rain-
soaked couch and chair, upholstery shredded. A spool once
used for telephone wire functions as their coffee table.
They splash through puddles, throwing her down on the
couch.
ANOTHER ANGLE
--looking back at the steam vent. JASON APPEARS IN THE
BILLOWING MIST.
CLOSE UP - SYRINGE
as a yellowish liquid squirts out the dirty needle. WIDEN
to find Gang Banger #2 holding it with transfixed eyes,
his compadre holding a squirming Rennie down on the
couch, tearing back her jacket to reveal a bare arm.
RENNIE
Please don't...
GANG BANGER #1
Loosen up, baby. It'll feel way
better if you're stoned.
CLOSE ON JASON'S FEET - SAME TIME
Amongst the slime and cigarette butts is a discarded
syringe. Jason picks it up.
CLOSER ANGLE - COUCH
just as Gang Banger #2 jabs Rennie with the needle.
Gang Banger #1 wrestles off his torn leather jacket,
pushing Rennie back on the exposed foam padding as his
friend watches excitedly.
GANG BANGER #1
Slang us some more 'caine, JoJo. We're
in for a long night.
Gang Banger #2 runs out the back way. #1 tears open
Rennie's blouse, his filthy mouth moving to her neck.
Rennie spits in his face. He hesitates not in SLAPPING
HER HARD.
GANG BANGER #1
It's your parade, princess. Can be
smooth or can be rough. Your choice.
She closes .her eyes, trying to blot out what's about to
happen.
GANG BANGER #1
I think I'm in love.
PUSH IN on his face as his neck arches down, bringing his
lips toward her chest. Just before contact he GRUNTS
THICKLY, HIS EYES BUGGING OUT.
WIDER ANGLE
Jason is standing right behind him, shoving something
into his back, out of frame. He thrusts it again,
bringing with it one more horrific grunt from the kid.
Jason goes for number three and:
CLOSE UP - GANG BANGER #1'S CHEST (EFX)
Jason's syringe gets shoved completely through him, the
needle sticking out his front side.
RENNIE
opens her eyes, looking into the dead boy's face as
blood drips from his mouth. He collapses in front of
her, giving way to a view of JASON TOWERING OVER HER. At
the same time:
GANG BANGER #2
comes around the corner.
GANG BANGER #2
Forgot my money, holmes...
Ha stops dead in his tracks at the sight of Jason.
GANG BANGER #2
Who the fuck are you?
Jason paces toward him. The kid glances at his dead
friend arched over the couch, quickly whipping out his
.38.
GANG BANGER #2
You're dead, fuckhead.
BANG!
...but Jason keeps on coming. Five shots later and
Jason's still standing, easily picking up the slime ball
and SHOVING HIM HEAD FIRST INTO THE MOSSY BRICK WALL. The
kid falls in a bloody heap.
RENNIE
shoves Gang Banger #1 off of her as Jason returns his
attention to her. She grabs a loose brick and FLINGS IT
AT HIM, CRACKING HIS HOCKEY MASK, momentarily
disorienting him. Rennie sprints away.
as Julius runs into view, looking down a menacing alley,
spotting a phone booth. He hurries for it.
PREDATOR'S POINT OF VIEW
Like a cat watching a bird, we watch Julius head for the
booth.
JULIUS
slams open the booth door, grabbing the receiver,
punching the "operator" digit. SLOWLY PUSH IN on him as
he waits for an answer. Several more rings.
JULIUS
C'mon...
Finally a click and muffled words from the operator.
JULIUS
Get me the police -- this is an
emergency...
SMASH! as JASON'S FIST CRASHES THROUGH THE BOOTH WINDOW,
GRABBING JULIUS BY THE THROAT. Julius grips Jason's scaly
arm with all his strength, staring at the cracked hockey
mask framed in the shattered window. Julius summons all
his strength, tearing free of Jason's grasp and running
out the door. The phone is left dangling.
RUNNING WITH JULIUS (HAND HELD)
with no apparent direction. Literally running for his
life.
TRACKING WITH JASON
He's just as quick, but smoother and more methodical.
JULIUS' POINT OF VIEW (HAND HELD)
heading up the alley, spotting a fire escape, diverting
his course straight for it.
ANGLE - FIRE ESCAPE
as Julius LEAPS ONTO IT, dragging himself up, climbing as
fast as is humanly possible.
ANGLE - JASON
...but Jason is-far from human, easily negotiating the
wrought-iron stairs and rapidly catching up.
as Julius' head appears, clawing his way onto the tar-
papered surface, running to the opposite side. A second
later, JASON HOPS UP RIGHT BEHIND HIM.
REVERSE ANGLE
as Julius soon learns the awful truth that the only way
up is the only way down...with the exception of a head-
splitting freefall. No way is he gonna jump. Julius turns
back to Jason, raising his fists, psyching himself up for
the fight of his life. He whispers to himself:
JULIUS
Use the combos and keep the feet
light...
THE FIGHT BEGINS, man against monster, each sizing the
other up.
Jason takes the first swing, Julius deftly dodging him
and countering with left-right-left combination. They
have absolutely no effect. Julius follows up with a round
of kidney punches. Again, nothing. Julius finds himself
being forced back against the rings, which in this case
is the edge of the roof. He risks a glance backwards and
sees:
JULIUS' POINT OF VIEW
It's a long, rough way down. It's do or die time.
RETURN TO SCENE
as Julius SLAMS PUNCH AFTER PUNCH INTO JASON, forcing him
back to the center of the rooftop, spending every last
ounce of his energy in doing so. He throws one more
feeble punch, knowing it's his last.
JULIUS
Take your best shot, motherfucker...
Jason gladly obliges, winding up and recoiling with a
punch none of us expected...
JULIUS' HEAD (EFX)
gets literally knocked off his shoulders, cascading off
the edge of the rooftop, and:
ANGLE - SLANTED LOWER ROOF
--the decapitated head lands on a sloped roof below,
rolling down towards street level and falling into a
garbage-filled dumpster.
as Rennie dizzily runs down the alley, the effects of the
drugs kicking in.
RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX)
Blurry, disoriented, erratic. Suddenly A FIGURE JUMPS OUT
FROM A CORRIDOR IN FRONT OF HER.
RETURN TO SHOT
It's SEAN. He rushes to her, sensing her disorientation.
SEAN
Rennie...what'd they do to you??
RENNIE
Drugs...
(serious pause)
Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.
Oh Jesus. He never expected this.
SEAN
We have to find the others.
Together they run off.
as Miss Van Deusen briskly walks below us, far from
relaxed in this threatening environment.
TRACKING SHOT
She moves forward, the only sound being her shoes against
wet asphalt. Four more steps, then a DARK, OUT OF FOCUS
FIGURE STEPS OUT BEHIND HER WITH A GUN.
VOICE
Freeze.
RACK FOCUS to find a uniformed IRISH COP standing there,
service revolver raised. McCulloch steps out from the
alcove as well, recognizing Miss Van Deusen.
MCCULLOCH
It's okay -- she's with me.
She turns around, lowering her hands, utterly relieved.
IRISH COP
My apologies, Miss. My unit's right
over here.
They head through an ABANDONED PARKING LOT towards a
concrete wall with stairs; about six feet above the wall
is an upper street, where his patrol car is parked. They
get halfway through the lot when they hear:
SEAN (O.S.)
Hey!
REVERSE ANGLE
as Sean and Rennie run to join them from the alley.
McCulloch rushes to his niece.
MCCULLOCH
Rennie, thank God...
But Rennie goes to Miss Van Deusen instead. It's a bitter
pill for McCulloch.
SEAN
Jason's here in New York.
MCCULLOCH
Don't be ridiculous!
MISS VAN DEUSEN
Is it true, Rennie??
She nods, unable to repress her fear.
IRISH COP
Is this the lass in question?
MCCULLOCH
(stewing)
Yes.
IRISH COP
Who is...Jason?
MCCULLOCH
He's a walking corpse, a phantasm from
hell.
The others stare at McCulloch angrily. Miss Van Deusen
turns to the confused policeman.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
I'm afraid you'll have some trouble
believing us.
IRISH COP
So try me.
parked above the abandoned garage, the interior dark. The
Cop and our heroes appear in the background, coming
towards it.
IRISH COP
You're right -- I find it a tall tale
indeed.
But you seem like honest folks so I'm
inclined to believe at least some of
it.
MISS VAN DEUSEN
(relieved)
Thank you. The first thing we' have to
do is find Julius.
IRISH COP
I'm sure he'll pop up soon enough. Why
don't you climb in the back while I
radio for backup.
ADJUST INTO A FULL SHOT OF THE BACK DOOR AS HE SWINGS IT
OPEN...but even in this darkness, we see that it's
empty. They climb in. The Cop opens his drivers door,
and...
INSERT - DOME LIGHT (SECOND UNIT)
The car dome light blinks on, and...
ANGLE - BACK SEAT
Our four survivors' faces are brightly illuminated,
INSTANTLY CHANGING TO GASPS AND SCREAMS because:
THEIR POINT OF VIEW (EFX)
Julius' severed head is resting on the dash board,
staring back at them!!!
ANGLE - COP
reacting to their terror, seeing Julius' head, quickly
grabbing the radio mike. But he has no time for a message
because JASON REACHES UP FROM THE PARKING LOT PIT BELOW,
GRABBING THE COP'S ANKLE, DRAGGING HIM DOWN. The radio is
still in his grasp.
INSERT - DISPATCH RADIO (SECOND UNIT)
as the radio cord grows taut, finally snapping. The
Irish cop's awful yell echoes over it, silencing after a
sick THUD.
...and the squad car SMASHES THROUGH A CHAIN LINK FENCE,
FREEFALLING TO THE ABANDONED PARKING LOT BELOW.
as the car bottoms out, then swerves into a sharp right
turn, racing down the alley.
POINT OF VIEW FROM FRONT BUMPER (STUNT DRIVE)
as Jason appears at the end of the alley, blocking their
retreat.
as she backs up, changes gears and races down an
intersecting alley.
POINT OF VIEW FROM FRONT BUMPER (STUNT DRIVE)
speeding towards an escape when JASON POPS OUT AGAIN!
He's everywhere all at once...
as the front of the squad car RAMS THE BRICK WALL HEAD-
ON, THE HOOD BURSTING INTO FLAMES.
ANOTHER ANGLE
as the front passenger door is shoved open by Sean, who
drags out Rennie. McCulloch follows close behind, helping
Sean carry her away from the wreckage, over by a row of
old oil drums filled with slime and rainwater. Then it
suddenly hits Sean...
SEAN
Miss Van Deusen...
He takes two steps back to the car when:
BOOM! (EFX)
The squad car interior is ENGULFED IN A BALL OF FLAMES.
RENNIE
opens her dazed eyes, seeing Miss Van Deusen's body
charring inside the wreckage. It's incomprehensible. She
numbly gets to her feet, stepping towards it. Something
makes her hesitate: she peers down at the asphalt...
A pool of gasoline has collected, flames dancing across
its glassy surface. Suddenly a TINY ROWBOAT DISSOLVES IN,
not unlike the lifeboat she was so afraid of. The
rowboat glides across the surface of the burning
gasoline, TWO PEOPLE RIDING IN IT. The flames and asphalt
SLOWLY FADE OUT AND GIVE WAY TO A SERENE LAKE.
RENNIE'S FLASHBACK - CRYSTAL LAKE - DAY
Shimmering water, clouds and pine trees reflected in it.
The rowboat floats into view. The two occupants are YOUNG
RENNIE and MCCULLOCH. She's wearing a bathing suit and an
innocent smile. And not an inkling of fear about the
water. She stands, letting the sun soak into her.
YOUNG RENNIE
What a beautiful day.
MCCULLOCH
Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
She frowns at him, looking away.
MCCULLOCH
You've been coming out here every
summer for the last three years, young
lady, and you still haven't learned
how.
YOUNG RENNIE
I'll take some lessons this time. I
promise.
She bends over, splashing the water.
MCCULLOCH
That's what you said last year. I
think the time for your first swimming
lesson has just come.
The splashing stops.
MCCULLOCH
You don't want to end up drowning like
that Voorhees boy, do you?
She's instantly tense.
MCCULLOCH
He never learned how either and he's
still at the bottom of this lake.
YOUNG RENNIE
He is not.
MCCULLOCH
Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull
down anybody who falls in and can't
swim.
YOUNG RENNIE
You're telling a lie.
MCCULLOCH
Am I? Let's find out.
...And quicker than she's able to react to it, MCCULLOCH
PUSHES HER OVERBOARD.
SPLASH!
as Rennie's body violently disrupts the calm surface.
She immediately begins to flounder. McCulloch calmly
leans over the edge.
MCCULLOCH
Better swim before Jason drags you
down, Rennie. Come on, you can do
it...
...but Rennie thrashes in the water, struggling to keep
from sinking under the surface.
RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW
Her uncle's face blurs and clears as water splashes her
eyes.
YOUNG RENNIE
I...I can't...
MCCULLOCH
You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
RENNIE
is too panicked to obey.
YOUNG RENNIE
Hhhhelp...me....
She coughs on some water then disappears...
UNDERWATER (TANK)
The world above her ceases to exist, murky lake water
taking over. Rennie looks-down, and to her horror...
RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (TANK)
Young Jason is grabbing her ankle and dragging her
down. The whole image BURSTS INTO FLAMES and we:
DISSOLVE BACK TO:
as the gasoline continues to burn, the rowboat gone.
ADJUST to find RENNIE'S FACE, the flames of the car
wreckage flickering over her glassy eyes. She looks up at
Miss Van Deusen's body one last time before:
ANGLE - SQUAD CAR (EFX)
The auto's fuel tank EXPLODES, SHRAPNEL FLYING
EVERYWHERE.
She looks up at her uncle with knowing eyes. Eyes that
tell him she's remembered everything.
RENNIE
You pushed me...
MCCULLOCH
(defensively)
I was only trying to teach you. But I
pulled you out, Rennie. I saved your
life.
Rennie just stares, incredulous.
SEAN
You son of a bitch...
She lets it build until she's ready to explode...then:
RENNIE
He was down there!!!
And Rennie runs off. McCulloch starts to follow but Sean
grabs him, shoving him down.
SEAN
You keep away from her!
Sean chases after Rennie. Camera methodically PANS BACK
TO MCCULLOCH, crumpled on the ground. A very bitter man.
He wipes his hands, getting ready to stand when THE
SHADOW FALLS OVER HIM. His skin fades to porcelain white.
MCCULLOCH
You...are...NOT POSSIBLE.
But possible, and actual, he is. A PAIR OF ROTTED ARMS
EXTEND DOWN, RIPPING HIM OUT OF FRAME.
TRACKING WITH JASON
as the walking corpse lifts a screaming McCulloch over
his head, carrying him over to one of the scum-filled OIL
DRUMS, SHOVING HIM HEAD-FIRST INTO IT. Jason grips
McCulloch's thrashing legs as bubbles rise to the surface
of the slime, a pathetic gurgling reverberating out the
drum. At last McCulloch's appendages go limp. Jason
releases him, moving on.
as Sean runs into view, glancing around, spotting Rennie,
crouched against a crumbled brick wall. No tears...only
hate. Sean sits down next to her. After several
moments...
RENNIE
I was at school when they told me.
'Rennie, we have some very bad news...
your parents have been killed in an
auto accident.'
Sean gently takes her hand, sharing her internal agony.
RENNIE
It seems like everybody I care about
ends up...
She can't finish. PUSH IN as Sean kisses her on the
forehead, then makes her look into his eyes.
SEAN
Not this time.
He caresses her face; it develops into a tender kiss.
Finally she holds him back, letting it out. At the same
time:
STALKING POINT OF VIEW
Somebody is creeping at a low angle towards them.
SEAN AND RENNIE
are lost in their shared quiet moment...until the
GROWLING SOUND becomes audible. They look up, seeing:
TOBY
cautiously approaching them. Rennie stands, absolutely
relieved.
RENNIE
Toby...
She starts to move towards him and her dog SNARLS
VICIOUSLY, CROUCHING BACK IN FEAR.
RENNIE
What's wrong, boy?
Another protective growl, then:
CRASH!
as Jason stampedes through a stack of crates and garbage
cans behind them.
SEAN, RENNIE AND TOBY
abruptly flee down the alley, Jason in mad pursuit.
as Rennie, Sean and the dog run straight towards us,
Jason swiftly catching up. FAST TRACK WITH THEM over to a
deserted, rain-slicked SUBWAY ENTRANCE.
...and the train begins to move, racing into the black
tunnel.
...and the train SCREECHES TO A HALT.
as our heroes arise into the neon-filled big city
wonderland, relieved to be alive, gazing around at the
awesome spectacle known as Times Square. A huge DIGITAL
CLOCK tells us it's a quarter to midnight. Sean wraps his
arm around her.
SEAN
It's over, Rennie. It's finally over.
Camera RISES ABOVE THEM, RACKING BACK TO THE SUBWAY EXIT.
Guess who has just made an encore...with more energy
than ever!!!
SEAN AND RENNIE
look all around them, having never been to a city as big
as this. They finally turn far enough around to spot
JASON in a series of three quick cuts, each one closer
than the last.
SEAN
God...please no...
But Jason keeps on coming.
RENNIE
Somebody help us!! He's going to kill
us!!!
But the heavy Times Square foot traffic ignores her,
bustling onward. Rennie and Sean have no choice but to
flee again.
JASON
shoves his way through the preoccupied pedestrians;
they've certainly seen weirder characters than him here.
He moves past a group of STREET URCHINS listening to some
rap from their ghetto blaster. His foot obliterates
their stereo system with one stride. They instantly pull
out switchblades and chains.
STREET URCHIN
You're dead meat, slime bag.
Jason stops, turning around, towering over the kids. He
has blood and gore caked everywhere, his skin charred
from the electrocution. Jason starts to remove his mask,
facing them squarely.
TIGHT ON STREET URCHINS
as Jason's mask comes off out-of-frame. Their tough faces
turn to putty, scared completely shitless.
STREET URCHIN
Hey man, it's cool, it's cool...
They turn tail and race like the wind. Jason steps
forward so that we're looking at the back of his head,
never seeing his naked face. He slips his hockey mask on
again, turns into a CLOSE UP, then exits.
They run about ten yards before realizing the alley is a
dead end. Sean and Rennie start to head back the other
way when JASON MOWS OUT FROM THE DINER DOOR. Their vision
scatters everywhere in search of a retreat...
RENNIE
Look!
She's spotted a MANHOLE COVER, slightly ajar. They
haven't the luxury of thinking about it, Sean sliding the
cover back as Jason comes forth.
The wall of deadly toxic liquid ENGULFS JASON.
The digital clock we saw earlier abruptly CHIMES
MIDNIGHT, HUGE BOLTS OF LIGHTNING CRACKING OVER
MANHATTAN.
ANGLE - SEAN AND RENNIE (EFX)
as the sewage level begins to drop. Rennie opens her
eyes, glancing straight down and seeing.
RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (EFX)
The ladder beneath them reappears...which gives way to a
PAIR OF HANDS GRIPPING THE BOTTOM RUNG. The liquid drops
further, unshrouding the now-dead corpse of EIGHT YEAR
OLD JASON. He's a relatively normal looking boy,
probably the way he looked back in 1957...right when he
drowned in Crystal Lake.
Jason Voorhees has finally been put to rest.
Rennie and Sean stagger out from a side street, holding
each other up...relief etched in their matured faces.
SEAN
I hear there's a statue here that's 22
stories tall.
Rennie would smile if she could. She kisses his cheek.
They amble on.
STALKING POINT OF VIEW
...coming out from another alley, creeping up behind them
through a crowd of pedestrians. About the height of a
small child.
RENNIE AND SEAN
walk arm in arm, exhausted and oblivious to their
pursuer. But something, some innate perception causes
Rennie to slow...and stop. Her eyes register a horrid
fear and she WHIPS AROUND TO FACE...
TOBY!
Limping on all fours, filthy with grease-matted fur. The
whimpering dog crawls up to her, Rennie bending down,
hugging her animal like she'll never let go.
RENNIE
Oh Toby...
HIGH ANGLE CRANE SHOT (N.Y.)
as Sean bends down too, ruffling the dog's fur, standing
again with Rennie. The three survivors enter the collage
of pedestrians, bright lights and skyscrapers.
It is finally over.
FADE OUT.
