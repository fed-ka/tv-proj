                                          TEASER

      5 9 ... height

      156 ... weight

      19  ... age

      250 ... year sentence

      TRANSITION INTO THE NIGHT SKY... 

       Rifles  by BRMC playing...

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Entropy. A measure of randomness, a 
                    parameter of disorder... energy 
                    broken down in irretrievable heat.

      BOOM DOWN TO:

      INT. TEMPLE - NIGHT11

      coming down off of stained glass images, biblical 
        paintings... 

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    What might appear to be chaos... even 
                    decay...

      ... to DON, wearing a suit and tie, looking in a 

      HEBREW PRAYER BOOK --

      Foreign letters looking like so much abstraction... he looks 
      up at the stained glass for guidance... listens to the CANTOR 
      singing in an alien tongue...

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.) (cont d)
                    ... is really a system s way of 
                    smoothing out differences -- its  
                    search for equilibrium.

      ... his POV -- FRAGMENTED GLASS IMAGES... 

      INT. EPPES HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT22

      Where CHARLIE and AMITA canoodle on the couch -- Charlie 
      reading off of some note cards...



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          NUMB3RS: 511/90: "Arrow of Time" - Rev. Yellow - 11/5/08    2. 

      CONTINUED:22

                                    CHARLIE
                    Too florid?

                                  AMITA
                    For thirty overachieving grad 
                    students?  Probably.  For me?

      She kisses him. Charlie starts to set aside the cards, but 
      Amita takes his hand, pulls it back... 

                                  AMITA (cont d)
                    Tell me more about irretrievable heat.

      Now headed into full bore nerd foreplay... 

                                    CHARLIE
                    Where language might fail us, the 
                    poetries of math and physics bring 
                    clarity -- 

      Charlie flips the cards away... 

      ... the tumbling rectangles creating the basis of another 
      folding grid, taking us to...

      EXT. PRISON YARD - NIGHT33

      (Charlie, shot against black, will drift in and out of the 
      remainder of the teaser, staying out of the action, but 
      bridging some shots, creating a  sort of vision: )

      The GRID becomes a FENCE -- behind which TWO SEARCHLIGHTS 
      sweep across the yard of the UNITED STATES PENITENTIARY - 
      ALHAMBRA...

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    -- observing spontaneous changes in 
                    isolated systems. 

      ... We PAN away from the light -- and Charlie -- finding an 

      AIR VENT --

      which is kicked out... then THREE MEN climb out. GRAY, lanky, 
      RAFE, tattoos and jailhouse muscle ...

      ... and BUCK WINTERS. Two years older than we last saw him, 
      and three decades harder. He passes through a MAKESHIFT ROPE 
      LADDER (made out of dental floss) and a BLANKET.

      The three men move along the shadows... dancing the crosses 
      of the searchlights... 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          NUMB3RS: 511/90: "Arrow of Time" - Rev. Yellow - 11/5/08    3. 

      CONTINUED:33

      ... arriving at --

      THE PRISON WALL --

      Where Gray swings the weighted end of the rope ladder in 
      wider and wider arcs...

      ... then HURLS it up; the anchor catches on the top of the 
      wall. 

      THE THREE MEN --

      Climb the ladder -- Buck first, then Gray, then Rafe -- 

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.) (cont d)
                    Entropy is our yardstick. Measuring 
                      progress...

      EXT. PRISON - TOP OF THE WALL - CONTINUOUS44

      Buck throws the BLANKET over the barbed wire...

      ... as Gray and Rafe come up the ladder...

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    ... defining the boundaries of a 
                    story... a beginning and an end.

      ... dropping flat as a SEARCHLIGHT BEAM narrowly skims over 
      them...

      ... and then they re pulling up the ladder... they drop it 
      over the other side and Gray is the first down... 

      As Buck climbs over, then Rafe --

      THE SEARCHLIGHT

      kisses his silhouette --

      EXT. PRISON - OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL - NIGHT55

      Buck, Gray, and Rafe scramble off the wall and away... 

      EXT. SCRUB - CONTINUOUS66

      The trio rises up over the hill, as the PRISON, in the 
      background, comes alive with SIRENS and LIGHTS... 

      ... sprinting toward a  75 El Dorado, waiting for them. 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)          NUMB3RS: 511/90: "Arrow of Time" - Rev. Yellow - 11/5/08    4. 

      CONTINUED:66

      Gray is the first one to the car, opening the driver s side 
      door -- 

      -- revealing CHANGES OF CLOTHES inside... A FAST FOOD TRAY 
      sitting on the front seat... 

      Gray jumps in as Buck scrambles around to ride shotgun, Rafe 
      jumps in back -- the men grabbing food, starting to peel away 
      their jumpsuits --

      TIGHT ON -- THE STEERING COLUMN

      Where a KEYCHAIN dangles from the ignition. Gray smiles, 
      turns the engine over...

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Entropy has a unique ability to 
                    choose a particular direction for 
                    time...

      The car peels away, a HAMBURGER WRAPPER flying out the 
      window... revealing the CITY OF LA in the b.g....

      INT. EPPES HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS77

      Amita and Charlie deep in one another s eyes...

                                  AMITA
                    The Arrow of Time.

                                    CHARLIE
                    The Arrow of Time.

      INT. TEMPLE - NIGHT88

      Don gives up; closes the prayer book... gets up and walks  
      out --

      EXT. DESERTED ROAD - NIGHT99

      As Buck shoves his jumpsuit out of the window of the car, 
      snagging on a roadside fence...

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                      Uncorrelated parts interact... find 
                    their connections in an evolving 
                    system...          NUMB3RS: 511/90: "Arrow of Time" - Rev. Yellow - 11/5/08    5. 



      EXT./INT. BEATER CAR (TRAVELING) - CONTINUOUS1010

      Now all wearing civilian clothes... Gray drives and eats; 
      Rafe sleeps across the back seat. Buck sits back in the 
      passenger seat, takes a CLIPPING out of his pocket...

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    ... so, from one perspective, entropy 
                    is a clock... 

      ... SLAPPING IT ON THE DASH, next to the dash clock. 

      ON THE CLIPPING --

      A PHOTO OF DON EPPES -- a PHOTO OF A BURNING CAR -- the 
      article headline:  THRILL KILLER MEETS HER DEMISE IN THE 
      DESERT. 

                                    CHARLIE (cont d)
                    ... charting the irreversible.

      OFF Buck -- a calm look of hatred on his face --


                                    END OF TEASER          NUMB3RS: 511/90: "Arrow of Time" - Rev. Yellow - 11/5/08    6. 



                                        ACT ONE

      INT./EXT. FBI CHARGER - NIGHT1111

      As LIZ and DAVID drive past -- 

      POV -- SHERIFF S CAR 

      Parked by the side of the road -- TWO SHERIFFS look at the 
      jumpsuit, snagged on the fence... 

      ... then a MARSHAL S CAR, parked a little further up the 
      road, where TWO MARSHALS bag a SECOND JUMPSUIT...

                                  DAVID
                    It s like an arrow -- pointed 
                    straight back at L.A.

                                  LIZ
                    Nice of them to leave us a trail of 
                      breadcrumbs.

      EXT. SCRUB - NIGHT1212

      A CRIME SCENE now -- sheriffs, U.S. Marshals, prison guards, 
      cars coming and going. 

      DAVID AND LIZ --

      Get out of the Charger, met by U.S. MARSHAL  UGLY JOE  
      THIBODEAUX, 30s, cut like a powerlifter with a beer gut... he 
      and David exchange a bearish handshake --

                                  THIBODEAUX
                    Hey, Sinclair --

                                  DAVID
                    Hey, Joe... so what do you need? 

      -- and they re on the move --

                                  THIBODEAUX
                    A really big net... got three guys 
                    over the wall -- had a car waiting. 
                    Tire tracks say a midsized something, 
                    older model...

                                  LIZ
                    Well, that narrows it down...





                                                                            (CONTINUED)          NUMB3RS: 511/90: "Arrow of Time" - Rev. Yellow - 11/5/08    7. 

      CONTINUED:1212

                                  THIBODEAUX
                    Unless we hear about three badasses 
                      terrorizing the countryside in their 
                      underwear, assume they also had a 
                    change of clothes.

                                  LIZ
                    So they re already past the 
                      roadblocks. 

                                  THIBODEAUX
                    Long gone... the dragnet is so the 
                    bosses can tell the press they did 
                      something. But check this out --

      -- arriving at THIBODEAUX S CAR -- where the ROPE and BLANKET 
      have been laid out -- David picks up the rope --

                                  DAVID
                    Looks like --

                                  THIBODEAUX
                    Dental floss.

                                  LIZ
                    How the hell do they get that much 
                    dental floss?

                                  THIBODEAUX
                    Not a bad question. They definitely 
                    had the time on their hands...

                                  DAVID
                     They  being --

                                  THIBODEAUX
                    Well, that s really why I dialed you 
                    in. 

      Thibodeaux hands David a stack of files -- 

                                  SECOND MARSHAL

                                  LIZ
                    Winters called you from a burner 
                    cell. Untraceable, but if he tries 
                    again, tech boys ll try to get a 
                      triangulation. 

                                  DON
                          (takes the sheet)
                    Okay... thanks.

                                  LIZ
                    Two minute and 38 second

                    About what you d expect.

      Liz pauses for a beat --

                    Anything else?

                                  LIZ
                    No... I m just trying to figure out 
                    if this is eating you up, or you re 
                    being a tool.

                                  DON
                    It can t be both?

                                  LIZ
                    Put everything else aside, and 
                    there s an office full of people 
                    trying to take down two escaped 
                    killers. It d be pretty screwed up if 
                    our biggest obstacle was our boss.

      INT. FBI - INTERROGATION ROOM - MORNING5050

      Robin stands in the background as Nikki interrogates Gray; 
      with two women in the room, he exudes an easy charm...

                                  NIKKI
                    How d you get Pynchon to hide you 
                    out?

                                  GRAY
                    Ask Pynchon.

                                  NIKKI
                    He s hard to understand with tubes in 
                    his throat. You don t get 
                      interesting, you might get hard to 
                      understand, too.

      Gray considers a beat; then, with half a smirk...

                                  GRAY
                    You stare at the same walls, hear the 
                    same stories 23 hours a day. For 
                    grins, I tell Pynchon about a drug 
                    stash the cops didn t find on my last 
                    pinch. 

                                  NIKKI
                    This is when he finds out about 
                    Nestor?

                                  GRAY
                    There isn t a Nestor... it was a jail 
                    story. Hidden drug stash, buried 
                    pirate treasure -- same difference.
                          (beat)
                    For a smart guy, Pynchon believed 
                    what he wanted to believe, you know? 
                    Got obsessed, started planning his 
                    way out...
                          (beat)
                    After he jackpotted that appeal, he 
                    obsessed on me getting out, leading 
                    him to the buried treasure.

                                  NIKKI
                    You strung him along. Him and Deanne.

                                  GRAY
                    Is anyone really surprised by my lack 
                    of character?

                    And Buck and Rafe?

                                  GRAY
                    I needed motivated partners; they ve 
                    got like 600 years in jail between 
                    them. Guys like those, though, you go 
                    your separate way first opportunity.

                                  NIKKI
                    Where s their separate way?

                                  GRAY
                    I have theories.

                                  NIKKI
                    Such as?

                                  GRAY
                    Such as, what kind of deal do we 
                    make?

      Robin finally speaks up --

                                  ROBIN
                    Here s your deal... accessory after 
                    the fact.

                                  GRAY
                    To what?

                                  ROBIN
                      Everything. You facilitated an 
                    escape... you re culpable for every 
                    crime I can prove is a by-product of 
                    that escape. Winters and Lansky steal 
                    a car? It s on you. They rob a bank? 
                    It s like you were driving the car. 
                          (fiercely)
                    They kill a federal agent? I ve got 
                    good seats in the gallery, watching 
                    them cook you.

      She stares at an uncertain Gray...

                                  ROBIN (cont d)
                    Go ahead... doubt me. Put your

                    partners are putting on your tab 
                    while you sit here and don t talk.

      Silence for a beat -- then -- 

                                  GRAY
                    Buck wants to kill some cop. Rafe 
                    doesn t want to, but that s Buck.

                                  NIKKI
                    Buck s the alpha dog?

                                  GRAY
                    When the kid made a deal with Rafe, 
                    everyone figured it was what it was -- 
                    fish staying alive behind some 
                    muscle. After a while, though, you 
                    just couldn t tell any more... maybe 
                    love, maybe something else.

                                  NIKKI
                    So where are they?

      Gray hesitates, flicks a look at Robin, then --

                    The Starline Motel -- least, that s

                    So there s this thing called a 
                    Viterbi Algorithm... a way of finding 
                    the most probable sequence of hidden 
                    states...

                    the time of day, and the weather... 

    ... SYMBOLS of day/night, a figurative calendar of four
