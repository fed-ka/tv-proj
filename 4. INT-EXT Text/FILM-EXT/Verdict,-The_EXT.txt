The Funeral Manager and Galvin standing in the cold.
FUNERAL MANAGER
I don't want you coming back here.
Ever. Do you understand?
GALVIN
I was just talking to...
FUNERAL MANAGER
Those are bereaved people in there.
The Funeral Manager gives Galvin a small shove, and goes
back to his post at the door, greeting the entering mourners.
"Good evening..."
ANGLE
Galvin, the ground cut out from under him. Standing watching
the mourners enter.
Galvin walking down a residential street. He has been walking
a while in the cold, snowy night. He stops for a stoplight
at a corner, waits for the light although there is no traffic.
Lights a cigarette. The light changes. He looks both ways
and irresolutely starts across the street. He stops. He checks
his watch. He sighs, and starts back in the opposite
direction.
Gruber opens door and walks out into the cold, into the
parking lot, followed by Galvin, who is lighting his cigar.
GALVIN
We have to... we... we have to keep
you under wraps. Please don't, don't
discuss...
GRUBER
I understand.
GALVIN
...the case with anyone. And I'll
meet you Tuesday, and we'll go over
your testimony...
They stop before a 1950s very beautiful small Mercedes Sedan.
Gruber opens the door, gets into the plush red leather
interior, starts car, leaves door open, still talking to
Galvin.
GRUBER
Right. Seven o'clock. Here.
Galvin scribbles information in his appointment book.
GALVIN
Thank you...
GRUBER
...that's perfectly all right.
GALVIN
(beat)
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
GRUBER
(thinks a second)
To do right. Isn't that why you're
doing it?
The courthouse across the street.
Galvin walking in the snow. Stops outside of a very lovely
brownstone with a small brass plaque. The plaque: Dr. David
C. Gruber. M.D. P.C.
ANGLE
Galvin looking in through the window of the dark, deserted
ground-floor office. He knocks on the door. Nothing. He knocks
again. Nothing. He stands unbelieving.
Galvin getting out of a taxi, rushing up the steps of a
brownstone. Peeps through the window on the side of the house.
Dark. He grabs the brass knocker. Pounds. Nothing, he pounds
again. Nothing. He is beaten. He is without resource. He
starts vacantly down the stairs. The door behind him is
opened. He turns.
ANGLE - P.O.V.
A middle-aged black WOMAN in livery.
MAID
What is it?
Galvin in the steps speaking with her.
GALVIN
Dr. Gruber.
MAID
Dr. Gruber's not in.
GALVIN
I had an appointment at his office,
I think I must have got it wrong. We
had a meeting...
MAID
He's not in, Sir.
GALVIN
Where is he?
She hesitates. She has been instructed not to say. Galvin
starts up the steps.
GALVIN
I... please. My wife... my wife's
prescription has run out. If I can
call him...
MAID
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
GALVIN
No, no, no. I have to talk to him.
If I can only call him...
MAID
(beat)
He's... you can't reach him, Sir.
He's in the, on some island in the
Caribbean, they don't have a phone.
(beat)
He'll be back in a week...
(beat)
If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
Galvin turns away from the door. He is still clutching the
box of cigars unconsciously.
Snow falling. Galvin standing outside, having just rung the
bell. The door is opened by a gangly teen-age boy. CAMERA
FOLLOWS Galvin into...
LONG SHOT of cars whooshing in the snow past a lonely street
corner. A MAN at an open telephone stand. The sound of the
telephone on the far end ringing.
ANGLE
Galvin at the stand, shivering in the cold, talking on the
phone. An open note pad in his bare hand.
VOICE
Continental Casualty...
GALVIN
Mr. Alito, please.
VOICE
Business hours are over, Sir. This
is the switch...
GALVIN
I have to reach him. This is an
emergency. Could you give me his
home number?
VOICE
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
GALVIN
...Would you, would you call him up.
I'll give you my number, and ask
him...
VOICE
I can't guarantee that...
GALVIN
I understand. Thank you, my name is
Galvin. I'll be at the following
number in a half an hour. It's urgent.
People coming out of a just-arrived train.
ANGLE
Galvin watching them, he has a large boutonniere on his lapel.
The departing PASSENGERS stream past him. An elderly BLACK
MAN passes him by, turns and comes back to him.
ANGLE - THE BLACK MAN AND GALVIN
DR. THOMPSON
Mr. Galvin?
Galvin turns. He is taken aback. He registers who it must
be.
GALVIN
Dr. Thompson...?
DR. THOMPSON
It was good of you to meet...
Galvin cuts him off, takes his bag.
GALVIN
Thank you for coming.
They shake hands. They start...
Galvin starts them walking again.
GALVIN
Please, Sir. Please. Humor me.
They have arrived outside at a bank of cabs.
GALVIN
We'll spend the evening together,
I'll put you up, you'll be very
comfortable. Please.
(hands Dr. Thompson
an envelope)
That's my address. The key is in it.
(leans forward to
cabbie)
1225 Commonwealth.
(to Dr. Thompson)
Treat the place as your own. Please
don't tell anyone you're here, I'll
see you this evening. Thank you, and
thank you for coming.
He puts Dr. Thompson's bag into the cab. Dr. Thompson
hesitates, gets into the cab.
As the cab pulls out, CAMERA FOLLOWS Galvin TO a bank of
phones outside the station.
ANGLE
Galvin at the phone.
VOICE
(Claire, on phone)
Mr. Galvin's...
GALVIN
Let me talk to Mickey.
MICKEY
(on phone)
Yeah? How's our new witness?
GALVIN
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
MICKEY
She's workin' the late shift at the
Hospital. She's at home now, I'm
going over there to talk to...
GALVIN
Gimme the address. I'm gonna go.
We're going to need her.
Names on bells. One of them is ROONEY, M. 2D.
ANGLE
Galvin standing by the bell. Rings it. Beat. The door is
buzzed, he walks into the vestibule, past mailboxes, up the
stairs.
Laura and Galvin walking.
LAURA
Is it over?
GALVIN
No.
LAURA
What are you going to do?
GALVIN
I don't have a goddamned idea.
Galvin hurrying up the steps of the tenement. CAMERA FOLLOWS
him into the vestibule. It is Mary Rooney's tenement.
Two very young children walk across a play area. The door to
the play area opens and Joe Galvin, in overcoat, comes in.
He looks around the room, starts to walk across it.
CAMERA PANS WITH him to REVEAL a woman, KATHY, who is
comforting a crying child. Galvin walks over to her. Stands
a respectful distance away. She sees him watching her, looks
up.
KATHY
Hi.
GALVIN
Hi. How are you doing?
She nods, happy to be working with the child.
GALVIN
I've been meaning to come in a long
time.
KATHY
You live in the neighborhood?
GALVIN
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be
staying with us in a few months, so
I stopped by.
KATHY
How old is he?
GALVIN
Four. You're great with these kids.
She beams, caught unprepared in something that is a great
point of pride with her.
KATHY
Thank you.
GALVIN
You're really...
(stops, remembering
something)
You, are you the one they told me
was the nurse?
KATHY
Who told you that?
GALVIN
(gestures back at the
office, vaguely)
Mrs...
KATHY
Mrs. Simmonds.
GALVIN
Yes.
KATHY
(very serious, correct)
I used to be a nurse.
GALVIN
That's a wonderful profession. My
daughter-in-law's a nurse. What did
you do, stop?
Kathy is lost in thought. This is obviously a very painful
subject for her. Beat.
KATHY
Yes.
Galvin, getting involved in a serious conversation, takes
off his overcoat, he is going to stay awhile.
GALVIN
How come you stopped?
She is traumatized by the question. The casual conversation
has become immediate and painful. She opens her mouth to
speak, then stops, staring at Galvin. He doesn't know what
she is staring at... something on his jacket. He looks down.
ANGLE - KATHY'S P.O.V.
The shuttle ticket, BOSTON - NEW YORK, stuck in the lapel
pocket of Galvin's suitcoat.
ANGLE
Kathy and Galvin. She realizes why he is there. She starts
to cry quietly.
GALVIN
(beat; gently dropping
his pretense)
Will you help me?
The doorman opens the door of a cab.
ANGLE
Mickey Morrissey standing in an alcove under the marquee,
looking out at the street.
ANGLE - P.O.V.
The street. Pedestrians. Joe Galvin comes walking hurriedly,
smiling, down the street.
ANGLE
Mickey starting down the steps, intercepts Galvin. Galvin
looks up, surprised.
GALVIN
What the hell are you doing here?
MICKEY
We got to talk.
He is moving Galvin off down the sidewalk, away from the
Hotel. CAMERA STAYS STILL, and their voices get fainter as
they move away.
GALVIN
What are you doing in New York...?
MICKEY
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
They continue walking. We cannot hear them. Galvin is becoming
agitated. He stops Mickey, stands there, Mickey very sad,
Galvin incredulous, talking to him. Mickey nods.
Galvin starts hurriedly back down the street toward the Hotel.
