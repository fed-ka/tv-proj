      FADE IN:

      EXT. HORACE HYDE-WHITE SCHOOL -- DAY

      As CAM DUNLEAVY (13 and cool) and his buddy ZACK GREENBURG
      (13 and apparently average) escape school, Cam shows Zack
      the teenager's Holy Grail.

                                    ZACK
                          (disbelief)
                    Four VIP backstage passes to see

                                    ZACK
                    Okay.  Where'd you score these?

                          (remembering)
                    Right, the deaf roadie.

                    Good thing music is his life.  So
                    there's one for you, Spence and Gwen.

                                    ZACK
                    Didn't you ask...what's her name?

                                    CAM
                    Samantha Sax.  She was busy.

                                    ZACK
                    Oh, she turned you down.

                                    CAM
                    She was busy.  Anyway, so tomorrow
                    night we'll meet at the stage door
                    and...

                                    ZACK
                          (embarrassed)
                    Cam, I can't go.  I can't do concerts
                    without an adult.      The Zack Files - Misfortune Cookie                        2.

                    Why don't you just ask your Dad if
                    it's okay?

      OFF Zack considering the possibility --

      EXT. GREENBURG APARTMENT BUILDING -- NIGHT

      To establish.

                                    ZACK (O.S.)
                    You know, Dad...

      INT. GREENBURG APARTMENT: KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

      Zack and his father, DAN GREENBURG (38), eat Chinese take-
      out in their kitchen.

                                    ZACK
                    ...I was thinking.

                                    DAN
                          (kidding)
                    Uh oh.

                                    ZACK
                    Maybe I'm ready to go to concerts. 
                    On my own.

                                    DAN
                    Zack, you may be ready but I'm not.

                                    ZACK
                    You trust me...

                                    DAN
                    Yes but concerts can be dangerous. 
                    All the crowds.  The merchandising.
                          (shudders, beat)
                    You thinking about any concert in
                      particular?

                                    ZACK
                          (carefully)
                    This is all hypothetical.

                                    DAN
                          (sharper than he looks)
                    Okay.  Because I read that Scrap
                    Heap is in town.  They're pretty
                    hot.      The Zack Files - Misfortune Cookie                        3.


                                    ZACK
                          (hopes rising)
                    Yeah.

                                    DAN
                    Tell you what.  We'll see Scrap Heap
                    together on their next farewell tour.

                                    ZACK
                          (subdued)
                    Sure, Dad.

      Dan adds his plate to the pile of crusty dishes in the sink:

                                    DAN
                    Your turn, Zack.  Don't forget the
                    dishes and your room and the laundry
                    and especially...your fortune cookie.

      Dan tosses Zack a fortune cookie and leaves.  After he goes:

                                    ZACK
                          (to camera, frustrated)
                    He thinks he can buy me off with a
                    fortune cookie.  I want my freedom. 
                    Just for once I wish I didn t have
                    to do dishes.  Or clean the kitchen. 
                    Or put away laundry.  I wish I could
                    just do what I want!

      Zack cracks the cookie open.  His fortune reads:

                                    ZACK (CONT'D)
                          (reading)
                    "One day all your best wishes will
                    be granted."  Yeah right.

      The legend mysteriously dissolves away before Zack's eyes.
      (CGI ASSISTED EFFECT).

                                    ZACK (CONT'D)
                    What the...? Huh?

      Zack looks around.  The sink is completely clean.

      Zack opens the cupboard.  All the dishes are neatly stacked. 
      The kitchen sparkles.

                                    ZACK (CONT'D)
                    Whoa.  This could be good. Really good.

      OFF Zack's smile --

                                                                              FADE OUT:      The Zack Files - Misfortune Cookie                        4.


                                          ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      INT. GREENBURG APARTMENT: FOYER -- DAY

      Dan enters, stuffing papers into his satchel.  Dan's on the
      move, preparing for a big day.

                                    DAN
                          (calls out)
                    Zack!  Get a move on!

      Zack enters from the corridor, still in his pyjamas.

                                    ZACK
                    Dad, the most amazing thing happened
                    last night.

                                    DAN
                    I know.  I saw.

                                    ZACK
                    You did?

                                    DAN
                          (proud)
                    Yeah, the kitchen's never looked
                    better.  You are really pulling your
                    weight.

                                    ZACK
                    Thanks. 

                                    DAN
                    Now, Zack remember I'm flying to New
                    York today for that interview.  I'll
                    be back around nine...

                                    ZACK
                          (knows the drill)
                    And you want me to stay close to
                    home.

                                    DAN
                    Well, I thought about our talk.

                                    ZACK
                          (surprised)
                    You did?

                                    DAN
                    Yeah.  And you taking care of the
                    kitchen shows real responsibility.      The Zack Files - Misfortune Cookie                        5.


                                    ZACK
                          (hopes rising again)
                      Soooo....?

                                    DAN
                    Soooo tonight...you're on your own. 
                    We won't get a baby sitter because
                    you are no baby.  You're my main
                    man.

      Dan high fives Zack.  A lame attempt at cool.

      Dan turns away from Zack to move Zack's bike out of the way.

                                    ZACK
                          (to camera)
                    I don't know why he insists on
                    torturing me like this -- but he
                    does.  I just wish I was out of here
                    and at school already.

                                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

      EXT. HORACE HYDE-WHITE SCHOOL: FRONT GREEN -- CONTINUOUS

      Zack drops from above into frame fully dressed for school.

                                    ZACK
                          (Keanu-esque)
                    Whoa.

      Zack's arrival startles his pal SPENCER SHARPE (13, intense).

                                      SPENCER
                    Zack.  Where'd you come from?

      In the background, the school custodian FLOYD HOGGMEISTER
      (large and scary) waters the lawn.

                                      FLOYD
                    You there!  No jumping out of the
                    sky onto my lawn.

                                    ZACK
                    Sorry, Floyd.

                                      SPENCER
                    Zack, your shoes are on the wrong
                    feet.

                                    ZACK
                    They are?

      And Spence records into his digital wristwatch:      The Zack Files - Misfortune Cookie                        6.

                    Zack File Number Three Two One Ruby
                    Slippers.  I believe primary test
                    subject Zachary Greenburg has been
                      teleported.

      As Zack changes his shoes, he considers them very carefully.

                                    ZACK
                    Sure beats the bus, eh? 

                                      SPENCER
                          (worried)
                    His atoms may have been scrambled. 
                    Again.

                                    ZACK
                    Spence, this is not teleportation.

                                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

      EXT. HORACE HYDE-WHITE SCHOOL: FRONT GREEN -- MOMENTS LATER

      Zack confers with Spence and Cam.  Behind them a Sealton
      Food Services Snack Truck sells junk food to other STUDENTS.

                                    CAM
                    It's a wish?  And why did the fortune
                    cookie give you these wishes?

                                    ZACK
                    It didn't.  It predicted that my
                    wishes would come true.  It's a
                    fortune cookie, Cam.

      They walk past FLOYD the custodian as he waters the lawn.

                                    CAM
                          (sardonic)
                    Hey, my mistake.  What was I thinking?

                                    ZACK
                    I think we could have a lot of fun
                    with this.

                                      SPENCER
                    No.  We should run some tests... 

                                    CAM
                    And we should use this to benefit
                    mankind.  We could cure cancer. 
                    Stop war.  All for a reasonable fee.

      Long beat.  Zack and Spencer stare at Cam in shock.      The Zack Files - Misfortune Cookie                        7.


                                      SPENCER
                    Can we keep focused?  Zack, wish for
                    something small.  Something easy.

                                    CAM
                    You know I kinda feel like lobster.
                          (off Zack's look)
                    So I have expensive tastes.

                                    ZACK
                    Okay.  I wish that snack truck had
                    lobster.

                                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

      EXT. HORACE HYDE-WHITE SCHOOL: NEAR PARKING LOT -- LATER

      The SNACK TRUCK GUY, a cranky guy, glares at Spence and Cam.

                                      SNACK TRUCK GUY
                    Lobster?  What do you think this is,
                    the Ritz?

                                      SPENCER
                          (disappointed)
                    Too bad.

                                      SNACK TRUCK GUY
                    Hey, wait, I gotta nice tuna sandwich.

      The Snack Truck Guy reaches into his cooler and pulls out...a
      live, snapping lobster.

                                      SPENCER
                    Hey!

                                      SNACK TRUCK GUY
                    Oh, man.  I gotta call my
                      exterminator.

      OFF Spence staring at the lobster intensely --

      EXT. HORACE HYDE-WHITE SCHOOL -- MOMENTS LATER

      Spence and Cam rejoin Zack near the school's front door.

                                    ZACK
                    I told you it would work.      The Zack Files - Misfortune Cookie                        8.


                                      SPENCER
                    I need the full Zack File kit.

                                    ZACK
                    Spence don't go hiring that camera
                    crew to follow me around again.

      But Spence is already gone.

                                    CAM
                    Hey, don't worry.  They won't let
                    his sound man into the concert anyway.

                                    ZACK
                          (bit blue)
                    Right.  About the concert...

      Just then VERNON sidles up to them.

                                      VERNON
                    Dunleavy, received your e-mail.  The
                    price is agreeable only if I can sit
                    next to Gwendolyn.

                          (to Cam, shocked)
                    I don't believe it.  You're selling
                    my pass to Vernon?

                                      VERNON
                    Why not Greenburg?  I hear that your
                    daddy won't let you out at night.

                                    ZACK
                    And I heard that your parents won't
                    let you back in.

                                      VERNON
                    Oooh!  That hurts!  While you're
                    sitting at home tonight counting
                    your teeth just remember this...
                          (chants)
                    Scrap Heap rules!

      Vernon backs away, leaping and chanting as he goes.

                                      VERNON (CONT'D)

      And Vernon backs right into Floyd watering the shrubbery. 
      Floyd drenches Vernon with water.

                    Isn't life great, Zack?

      Cam turns around.  Zack is gone.

                                    CAM (CONT'D)
                    Zack?

      INT. HORACE HYDE-WHITE SCHOOL:MAIN LOCKER AREA -- LATER

      A locker SLAMS shut.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL Zack and Cam.

                                    CAM
                    What's with you?  Vernon just got totally
                      humiliated and you just walk away.

                                    ZACK
                    Go ahead.  Sell my ticket to Vernon. 
                    I can't go.  My Dad wants me to stick
                    close to home.

                                    CAM
                    Oh man that does suck.

      The two boys consider the tragic turn of events.

                                    CAM (CONT'D)
                    But you know Zack, the Forum's only

                                    ZACK
                          (sees the loophole)
                    That is pretty close.

                                    CAM
                    It won't even be dark out.

      INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY -- AFTERNOON

      Zack and Cam run out of the elevator.

                                      ZACK/CAM
                    Scrap Heap rules!  Scrap Heap rules!

                    Grab the pass and let's go.

                                    ZACK
                    Just one thing.  And this is really
                      important.  I have to get home tonight
                    before my Dad does.  That's nine
                    o'clock.

                                    CAM
                    Zack, you've got your wishing power
                    for any emergency.  You've got to
                    use this to your advantage, buddy. 
                    Oh...

      Just then Cam's CELL PHONE RINGS.  He answers it.

                                    CAM (CONT'D)
                    Dunleavy Enterprises, a division of

                    Yeah.  Hang on.

      Cam hands Zack the phone.

                                    ZACK
                    Hey Dad.  How's New York?

                                                                        INTERCUT WITH:

                                    DAN
                    Great.  I learned more about pretzels
                    than I ever expected.  Now I hate to
                    be a Dad but there's a few things I
                    want you to do around the house.

      Dan takes a typed list out of his jacket pocket.

                    Grouting.  Calking...sure.  Filed
                      alphabetically.  Right.  Anything

                          (repeats instructions)

                    Anything else?

                          (through phone)
                    Just remember to have fun. 

                                    ZACK
                    Right.  Fun.  Tons of fun.  Bye.

      Zack closes the cell phone and hands it back to Cam.

                                    ZACK (CONT'D)
                    He did this on purpose.  With all
                    these chores, I'll never make the
                    concert.  Sometimes I wish this I
                    never had to see this apartment again.

      THUNDER RUMBLES in the distance.  The lights in the hallway
      DIM AND GO UP AGAIN.

      Zack and Cam exchange a worried look.

      Zack opens his front door.

      The door leads to an empty rooftop.  The apartment is gone.
      (CGI ASSISTED GREEN SCREEN EFFECT).

      Zack closes the front door.  Opens it again.  The apartment
      is still gone.  (CGI ASSISTED GREEN SCREEN EFFECT)

                                    CAM
                    Zack, you've lost your apartment.

                                    ZACK
                    Oh man....

      OFF Zack's dread --

      FADE IN:

      EXT. FORUM STAGE DOOR -- DAY

      Spence and GWEN KILLERBY (13, dressed with rock show
        sophistication) wait with the electrics trucks at the Forum's
      Artists' Entrance. 

                                      SPENCER
                    They're in trouble.

                                    GWEN
                    They're only an hour late.  Bands
                    are always late.  It's part of their
                    mystique.

                                      SPENCER
                    No, Cam and Zack.  I think Zack's
                    wishing power's gotten out of control.

                                    GWEN
                    Wishing power?  Get real.  In
                      California all the snack trucks sell
                    lobster.

                                      SPENCER
                    And what about Floyd hosing down
                    Vernon?

                                    GWEN
                    We all wish for that.  Listen Spence,
                    you want to be a scientist, right?

                                      SPENCER
                    Yes.

                                    GWEN
                    So be a scientist.  Don't rely on
                    your emotions.  Be logical.  When
                    you see something paranormal don't
                    let the excitement of the moment run
                    away from you -- oh...my...God! 
                    It's Little Ricky from Scrap Heap! 
                          (screams)
                    OH MY GOD!  He is so cute!  He's
                    epic!  Little Ricky!  OH MY GOD!

      Gwen screams again.  She starts to weep.

                                      SPENCER
                          (re: Gwen)
                    Gwen!  What happened to logic?  Gwen?       The Zack Files - Misfortune Cookie                       13.


      INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY -- SAME TIME

      Zack's front door is closed.  He opens it a crack.  Closes
      it again.  Cam and Zack consider their options.

                                    CAM
                    Still not there, huh?

                                    ZACK
                    We can't go to the concert now.

                                    CAM
                    Why not?

                                    ZACK
                    Cam, I dematerialized three floors
                    of a rent controlled building.  Don't
                    you think we should do something
                    about that?

                                    CAM
                    Yes, we should.  Right after the
                    concert.

                                    ZACK
                    Don't you get it, Cam!  I left the
                    backstage pass in my bedroom!

                                    CAM
                    Oh man.  This is awful.

                                    ZACK
                    Wait.  I'll wish it back.

                                    CAM
                          (worried)
                    Sure.

                                    ZACK
                    Okay.  I wish there was an apartment
                    behind this door.

      THUNDER RUMBLES.  The hall lights FLICKER AND RISE AGAIN. 
      Zack gingerly opens the door.

      Cam and Zack step inside to discover...

      INT. FOYER -- CONTINUOUS

      ...that the foyer is decorated with old lady stuff: umbrellas
      in a hat stand, two chairs covered with doilies and a large
        freestanding birdcage with a parrot.      The Zack Files - Misfortune Cookie                       14.


                                    ZACK
                    Not bad.  But where's my bike? 

                                    CAM
                    And what's with all this old lady
                    stuff?

      Cam examines the bird cage.

                                    CAM (CONT'D)
                    This parrot is dead.

                    Okay.  I got an apartment, just not
                    the right one.

                                    CAM
                    No kidding.

                                    ZACK
                    I just have to be more specific.
                          (thinks)
                    Okay.  I wish I had my old apartment
                    back just the way it originally was --
                    except with the shower grouted and
                    caulked.
                          (off Cam's look)
                    Might as well get something done.

      They open the door and walk into...      The Zack Files - Misfortune Cookie                       15.


      INT. FOYER -- CONTINUOUS

      The apartment is empty, pristine.  (Production note: we only
      see the foyer, corridor and half the living room empty).

                                    ZACK
                    This isn't what I wished for.

      Cam examines the only thing left: a 1940's rotary telephone.

                    Hey, look, the phone doesn't even
                    have buttons.  Wait a minute.  You
                    said "old apartment".

                                    ZACK
                    Oh no.  My apartment rematerialized
                    the way it was built -- seventy years
                    ago.

                    Zack, listen, you can keep wishing
                    for an apartment all night long or
                    you could just...

                                    ZACK
                    Cam, go.  Go to the show.

                    They won't let me in.  I mean, I
                    wish I had my backstage pass but...

      A CRACK OF THUNDER.  The lights DIM AND RISE AGAIN. 

      There is a FORCEFUL KNOCK on the door.  BAM...BAM...BAM.

                                    ZACK
                    Yeah?

      He makes no move to the door.

                                    CAM
                    You live here.  I don't.

      Zack opens the door to find A BIKE COURIER, snapping gum.

      The Courier thrusts a clipboard into Zack's face. Zack signs.      The Zack Files - Misfortune Cookie                       16.


      The Courier slaps a envelope into Zack's arms.  The Courier
      takes off.

                                    ZACK
                    Thank you.

      Zack rips the envelope open.

                                    ZACK
                    Getting a new power is like getting
                    a guitar.  You've got to practice.

                    I'll be careful.  And clear.  I wish we
                    were in our front row seats with our
                    backstage passes to see Scrap Heap.

                    even missed where Little Ricky tosses
                    his scarf and some girl loses it.

                    Well, maybe he felt like he didn't

                    he sabotaged himself.  It's classic.
