      FADE IN ON:

      INT. PALACE OF AUBURN HILLS ARENA - NIGHT

      Verite' style, we re following a Caucasian Detective (FITCH), 
      and a few other detectives, through a concourse tunnel into -- 
      A PACKED ARENA where a Detroit Pistons basketball game is on.  
      They meet uniformed cops waiting at the top of an aisle. 

                                  UNIFORMED COP
                    He's in row F, 32 Jersey.

      Two detectives head to the next aisle as Fitch spots a white 
      suspect in the stands wearing a Piston's jersey, number 32.

      And now we're following Fitch and the cops down the aisle 
      toward the suspect.  Detectives also come from the other 
      side.  As cops cut into his row from both ends, the suspect 
      freaks and starts climbing over seats, making his way down.  

      And now the whole chase is playing out on the JUMBO-TRON in 
      front of 25 thousand fans.  

      The suspect gets to the court, running through the game.  
      Pistons Guard Richard Hamilton comes out of nowhere and 
      clothes-lines the suspect, dropping him.  Ironic, cause, he 
      IS number 32.  In seconds, Fitch is on the guy, cuffing him.  

                                  FITCH 
                    Lawrence Tate, you re under arrest 
                    for the murder of Kenneth Small.

      Fitch throws a nod up at Hamilton -  Thanks'.  Hamilton fist 
      pumps Fitch and the whole stadium ERUPTS IN CHEERS!  

      Fitch stands up with the suspect and turns, WALKING RIGHT 
      INTO THE CAMERA.  He leers at the lens, irritated, and warns-

                                  FITCH (CONT'D)
                    Stay out of my face!

      And as he drags the suspect past us, BUMPING THE CAMERA, we 
      realize we are watching a polished, edited documentary 
      television series.  

      A DRIVING GUITAR RIFF cuts in, that's right, the kick-ass 
      opening of Kiss's, "DETROIT ROCK CITY" blares as we CUT TO 
      OUR INTRO:                                                                                      2.



      THE ICONIC DETROIT SKYLINE.  Sun glints off the skyscrapers 
      as a Narrator's objective 'Frontline'-esque voice, tells us-

                                  NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    1-8-7 is the police radio code for 
                    homicide.  Block for block, Detroit 
                    has more homicides than any city in 
                    the U.S.  For the people who live 
                    here, it's a fact of life.  But for 
                    the men and women of Detroit's 
                    Homicide unit, it's their life's 
                    work.

      The full band KICKS IN and now we know we're in for a ride. 
      As the skyline becomes silhouetted, its buildings MORPH into 
      letters that spell out our title--


                            1-8-7 DETROIT

      EXT. AERIAL OVER DETROIT - NIGHT

      We are high over the city - looking down.  And what we're 
      about to hear, is unfolding somewhere in that unknowable 
      tangle of lights below.  OVER PICTURE, a 911 dispatcher 
      fields a call from an eerily calm man.  His voice is hard to 
      make out, so the conversation is subtitled--

                                  DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                    911, what s your emergency?

                                  MAN (V.O.)
                    Woodrow s Drugstore.  They re some 
                    people shot up in there.

                                  DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                    How many people, sir?

                                  MAN (V.O.)
                    I don t know.

                                  DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                    Did you witness the shooting?
                          (long beat)
                    Sir, did you see the..?

                                  MAN
                    I didn t see BLEEEEP!

      CLICK - the man hangs up, and we-

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                      3.



    A PHOTO OF A BABY, still in the womb.  And just when we re 
      thinking this is some kind of forensic nightmare related to 
      that 911 call, we hear-- 

                                  MAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    That s him!  The king.  Heir to the 
                    throne, comin at you in 3-D, baby! 

      INT. CAR - MOVING FAST

      ON AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN (MID-20 S) He's in the passenger 
      seat, and as he holds the baby photo up to his boyish, 
      indomitably optimistic face, he gushes-

                                    AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN
                    Don t he look like me? 

      We FREEZE briefly on his goofy expression as text appears: 

      'DETECTIVE DAMON WASHINGTON, Detroit Homicide - first day. 

                                  WASHINGTON 
                    Due date was last week so my first 
                    day on homicide could be his first 
                    day in the world.  Crazy!  Yeah, 
                    you ll know when he comes too, 
                    cause you re gonna hear this...

      Washington cups his ear and we hear - a  ROCKABYE BABY  ring 
      tone.  He laughs, showing us his cell phone-

                                  WASHINGTON (CONT'D)
                    That's the 'Call of the Child.'  
                    Most beautiful song in the world, 
                    ain t it Partner?

      ON FITCH, who we met earlier, behind the wheel -- trying not 
      to look like this schmaltz is making him nauseous.  We FREEZE 
      briefly on his awkward expression as text appears: 

       DETECTIVE JOSEPH FITCH, 18 years Detroit Homicide. 

      Stay on Fitch, clearly uncomfortable in front of the camera-

                                  WASHINGTON (O.S.) (CONT'D) 
                    I used to patrol East Detroit in 
                    uniform, so coming out here on my 
                    first homicide is kinda poetic. 
                    This man's gonna show me the ropes.  
                    Highest clearance rate in the unit.   
                    Look up 'solved' in the dictionary?  
                    That's right, you see his face.                                                                                      4.



      Fitch gives the wheel an Indian burn - how much can he take?

                                  WASHINGTON (CONT'D)
                    He s like Yoda with a badge.  The 
                    Duke of dicks.  The Maestro of...

                                  FITCH
                    We're here.

      STROBES AHEAD.  Washington goes serious.  And in an overly 
      confident tone, as if to mask his newbie nerves, he pledges--

                                  WASHINGTON 
                    This case is as good as cleared.

      EXT. PHARMACY   MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

      Police out front.  Over picture, we hear a man VOMITING-  

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      INT. PHARMACY   CONTINUOUS

      Fitch and a room full of cops look off.  A moment, then 
      Washington RISES INTO FRAME, wiping his mouth.  

                                  WASHINGTON
                    Sorry...

      Cops trade stunned looks,  Can you believe that shit?   But 
      Fitch turns his attention to what made Washington so sick.   

      A BODY sprawled awkwardly on the floor.  In a white lab coat.  
      A uniformed COP fills Fitch in. 

                                  UNIFORMED COP
                    He owned the pharmacy.  David Sung.   
                    Shot once in the head. 

                                  FITCH
                    Sneaker print in the blood here.  
                    Unless one of your guys was wearing 
                    high tops... should be our suspect.

                                  UNIFORMED COP
                    Second victim's behind the counter.

      Fitch exits frame revealing WASHINGTON GLARING at the body.

      BEHIND THE COUNTER   MOMENTS LATER

      Fitch looks down at a second body, an African American woman, 
      also in a white lab coat.                                                                                      5.



                                  UNIFORMED COP
                    Shannon Hibbit, twenty eight.  
                    Worked the late shift.  

      Fitch sees blood-spattered NURSING TEXTBOOKS on the counter-

                                  FITCH
                    Gave her time to study.  

                                  UNIFORMED COP
                    Yeah.  Senseless.

      And as the cop walks off shaking his head, we go CLOSE ON 
      FITCH, intensely troubled by this victim-

                                  FITCH
                    Can you give me some room, please?

      And just when we're wondering who the hell he's talking to, 
      he turns to CAMERA, searing, looking dead at the lens-

                                  FITCH (CONT'D)
                     BACK.  UP.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. MOVING CAR   LATER THAT NIGHT

      THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD - we're rolling down a dilapidated 
      street.  Shops boarded up.  Windows smashed.  We hear- 

                                  LONGFORD (O.S.)
                      Washington Boulevard was one of the 
                    first streets in the world that 
                    Edison rigged with electric lights.  

      ON AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN (MID-50 S), in the passenger seat-  

                                  LONGFORD (CONT'D)
                    I love this city.

      FREEZE briefly on his sage face as text appears: 

       SGT JESSE 'LONG HAUL' LONGFORD, 30 years Detroit Homicide. 

                                  LONGFORD (CONT'D)
                    Got a vehicle in the river off 
                    Belle Island.  Used to camp out 
                    there when I was a kid.  Not a 
                    place you wanna be after dark, 
                    these days.  I ve been a cop in 
                    Detroit so long, when I started... 
                    half the suspects were white!                                                                                      6.



      ON HIS PARTNER - AN INDIAN MAN (35) -- driving.  The signal 
      CLICKS as he turns the corner, passing the OLD FORD PLANT.

                                  MAJAN
                    My family came over twenty years 
                    ago.  Dad got an engineering job at 
                    Ford.  In another twenty years all 
                    the cars will be made in India.  My 
                    kids ll probably have to move back 
                    to get a job.  Full circle.

      He chuckles.  FREEZE briefly on his genial face: 

       DETECTIVE AMAN MAJAN, 7 years Detroit Homicide. 

      EXT. BELLE ISLAND PARK - DETROIT - NIGHT

      Longford and Majan walk across the grass toward a cluster of 
      police lights.  The grand BELLE ISLE CASINO ROTUNDA rises, 
      lit up in the B.G.  The Detroit skyline visible across the 
      river as Longford reflects soulfully for us-

                                  LONGFORD
                    You get this feeling walking up on 
                    a scene, not knowing what your 
                    gonna find.  I don t know, it s 
                    like,  la notte   appena iniziata.   
                    The night has just begun.  Gonna 
                    miss that feeling when I retire. 

      Majan ribs his melodramatic partner--

                                  MAJAN
                    You won t miss it in winter when 
                    I m freezing my nuts off and you re 
                    in your house in Tuscany sipping 
                    Chianti.  How do you say,  Cry me a 
                    river  in Italian?

      EXT. BELLE ISLAND PARK - DETROIT - MOMENTS LATER

      A NEWS HELICOPTER overhead.  Longford, Majan, and a bunch of 
      cops watch a TOW TRUCK pull a red Corvette out of the river.

                                  MAJAN
                    57 Vette.  Roman red.  Classic.

                                                                      HARD CUT TO:

      LATER - LONGFORD AND MAJAN circle the Corvette with 
        flashlights.  A water-logged body slumped in the seat.                                                                                      7.



                                  MAJAN (CONT'D)
                    Male Caucasian.

                                  LONGFORD 
                    Probably came out here to score.  
                    He gets high, veers off the road.

                                  MAJAN
                          (looking closer)
                    Got a gunshot.  Side of the head.

                                  LONGFORD
                    Driver's side window's busted.  

      Longford swishes his flashlight around the grass- 

                                  LONGFORD (CONT'D)
                    No glass, no tire tracks.  How does 
                    he get into the water?

                                  MAJAN
                    The 57 had a fiberglass body.  
                    Pretty light.  Strong current... 

                                  LONGFORD
                    Think he could have gone in 
                    somewhere up river and drifted 
                    here?

      Majan nods, and we--

                                                                      HARD CUT TO:

      LATER - Majan and Longford go through the man s belongings. 
      Majan matches the man s business card against the license- 

                                  MAJAN 
                    Michael Rostin.  Divorce attorney.

                    They tend to create a lot of angry 
                    people.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. PHARMACY - LATER THAT NIGHT

      WITH A LATINA DETECTIVE, (30), crossing the street toward the 
      pharmacy.  Though sexy-beautiful and plenty aware of it, she 
      also carries a discernible edge you don't want to mess with.  
      As she gets to the door, she tells us-                                                                                       8.



                                  LATINA DETECTIVE
                    I grew up three blocks away.  You 
                    just pray when you walk in to one 
                    of these that it s no one you know.

      And we FREEZE briefly on her as text appears:

       DETECTIVE ARIANA SANCHEZ, 5 years Detroit homicide.  

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. PHARMACY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

      Fitch is at the register, going through receipts.  Sanchez 
      approaches, stepping over the vomit-

                                    SANCHEZ 
                    Shooter must have been jonesing 
                    pretty bad, he threw up all over 
                    the place.

                                  FITCH
                    That wasn t the shooter.

      He throws an irritated nod at Washington behind the counter. 

                                    SANCHEZ
                    No way.  

                                  FITCH
                    Way.

      ON WASHINGTON - at the shelves, counting pill bottles against 
      an inventory manifest.  He stops, looking solemnly at FAMILY 
      PHOTOS on the wall of TWO YOUNG AFRICAN AMERICAN KIDS, his 
      voice cracking with emotion as he thinks out loud-

                                  WASHINGTON
                    Right now those kids are sleeping.  
                    Waiting for their mother to get 
                    home.  Makes you think... there s 
                    never just one victim.  There s 
                    everyone left behind.

      LATER - FITCH IS AT THE REGISTER - on the phone now.  Sanchez 
      is nearby, conferring with a COP.

                                  FITCH
                    You're sure?  Okay, thank you 
                    Ma'am.  Sorry to disturb you.

      He hangs up and glances at a receipt.                                                                                        9.



                                  FITCH (CONT'D)
                    Last credit card transaction was 
                      authorized at 8:23 pm.  Card holder 
                    says she was the only customer in 
                    the store.  Everything was normal 
                    when she left. 

                                    SANCHEZ
                    9-1-1 call came in at..?

                                  UNIFORMED COP
                    8:47.

      And it's an oddly humorous caught-on-camera beat, as they 
      stand there, silently doing the math in their heads.  Then-

                                    SANCHEZ
                      Twenty-four minute window.

      Washington walks up.

                                  WASHINGTON 
                    Two cases of Oxycontin missing.  
                    Looks like a drug robbery gone bad.

                                  FITCH
                    Male was shot once in the head; 
                    female victim was shot five times. 
                    Overkill, don t you think? 

                                  WASHINGTON 
                    Maybe the guy was high.

                                    SANCHEZ 
                    Or she was targeted.  

                                  FITCH
                    Shooter enters.  Fires one shot at 
                    Mr. Sung.  She would have seen him.  
                    Why doesn't she run?

                                    SANCHEZ 
                    She knows him.  She's trying to 
                    reason with him.

      Fitch nods at Sanchez - a subtle show of respect-

                                  FITCH
                      Storefront is glass.  Canvass the 
                    area; maybe somebody saw something.

      And as the detectives peel off, we STAY on the UNIFORMED COP, 
      who turns to the camera, warning criminals everywhere-                                                                                    10.



                                  UNIFORMED COP 
                    You kill somebody in the city of 
                    Detroit, you d better pray.  Not 
                    for forgiveness.  Not to God, cause 
                    God can t help you...

      As he talks, we pull focus, ZEROING IN ON FITCH across the 
      room now - kneeling over Shannon Hibbit's body. 

                                  UNIFORMED COP (CONT'D)
                    You d better pray your case doesn t 
                    land on his desk.  Cause he will 
                    not sleep.  He will not eat.  He 
                    will not take a BLEEEP until he 
                    finds you.

      EXT. BELLE ISLAND - LATER THAT NIGHT 

      We re watching like voyeurs, through the back window of a 
      police cruiser, as Longford consoles the dead lawyer's shell 
      shocked wife, MRS. ROSTIN-

                                  MRS. ROSTIN
                    I told him not to drive that car.  
                    It was too flashy.
                          (crying now)
                    He was such a good person.

      She leans on Longford's shoulder, sobbing.  Longford, who 
      doesn t sense the camera watching, is clearly shaken. 

      ON MAJAN, seeing the coroners begin to remove the body from 
      the Corvette--

                                  MAJAN
                    Hey!  Seriously guys... in front of 
                    his wife?  

      They stop.  Majan gazes at his partner, making sure we know-

                                  MAJAN (CONT'D)
                    She demanded to be brought to the 
                    scene.  There s nothing worse than 
                    telling a person that someone they 
                    love is gone.  Never gets any 
                    easier.

      EXT. COTTAGE HOUSE   NIGHT

      AT A DISTANCE, we see Fitch and Washington at the door.  A 
      Caucasian woman (60'S), answers in a robe, just awoken - 
      alarmed by this late night visit from police.                                                                                    11.



                                  FITCH
                    Ma'am, we're detectives from the 
                    Detroit Police Department...

                                  WOMAN
                    Oh my god, what happened?

                                  FITCH
                    Can we come in and talk, Ma'am?

      INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

      FITCH AND WASHINGTON sit across from the woman, JUNE ROLAND. 
      She looks at them like she knows what's coming-

                                  FITCH 
                    So, you're her mother in law.

                                  JUNE ROLAND
                    Ex.  She and my son divorced about 
                    two years ago.  

                                  FITCH 
                    Shannon lives here with you?  

                                  JUNE ROLAND
                    And the kids...

      We hear a CREAK!   CAMERA follows it, finding A SMALL BOY 
      (6), mixed race, his worried face peering out of a cracked 
      door.  June Roland puts on a smile-

                                  JUNE ROLAND (CONT'D)
                    It's okay honey, go back to bed.  
                    I'll be in in a little.  It's okay. 

      The boy makes eye contact with Fitch, then the door eerily 
      closes, swallowing his face.  June Roland looks at Washington 
      who awkwardly avoids eye contact.  Fitch sighs, subtle-

                                  FITCH 
                    Ma'am... Shannon was found deceased 
                    at work this evening... she was the 
                    victim of a homicide. 

      June Roland closes her eyes and starts crying -- silently.

                                  FITCH (CONT'D)
                    I know this must be incredibly 
                      difficult, but I'm going to have to 
                    ask you some questions.  

      She nods, trying to be strong.                                                                                    12.



                                  FITCH (CONT'D)
                    Are you aware of anyone who would 
                    want to harm Shannon?

      She shakes her head, 'No.'

                                  FITCH (CONT'D)
                    Had she been seeing anybody..?

                                  JUNE ROLAND
                    Alvin.  Alvin Green... for about a 
                    year.  They're... they WERE very 
                    happy.  He adores the kids.  
                    He's going to be so devastated.

                                  FITCH
                    And Shannon's children... your 
                    son's the father?  

                                  JUNE ROLAND
                    Yes.

                                  FITCH 
                    What's your son's name?

                                  JUNE ROLAND
                    James.  

                                  FITCH
                    James Roland?  

      She nods.  Fitch shoots Washington a look, like he should be 
      writing this down.  Washington fumbles to open his note pad.

                                  FITCH (CONT'D)
                    Where is your son, now?

                                  JUNE ROLAND
                    In prison.  Those poor children...

                                  FITCH
                    Mrs. Roland, do you have any 
                    relatives or someone who can help 
                    you with the kids right now?

      She nods, her face taking on an infinite sadness, her entire 
      universe shattered.  Her anguish only seems to fuel Fitch-

                                  FITCH (CONT'D)
                    Ma'am, I'm very sorry for your...

                                  JUNE ROLAND
                    What do I tell them?  How can..?                                                                                    13.



                                  FITCH 
                    Ma'am..?  Ma'am, look at me...

      She looks up at Fitch, calmed some by his strong eyes.

                                  FITCH (CONT'D)
                    Those kids are going to be okay.  
                    And I promise you I'm going to find 
                    the person who took Shannon's...

    A  ROCKABYE BABY  ring-tone BLARES, interrupting Fitch's vow.  
      A stunned June Roland, Fitch, CAMERA; all turn to Washington, 
      who looks like a deer caught in the headlights-

                                  WASHINGTON
                    Sorry... I'll... step out.

      OFF FITCH, 'Are you fuckin kidding me?!'

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      INT. STATION - SQUAD ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

      WE'RE ON A CLOSED OFFICE DOOR   a placard reads: 'LT. MAUREEN 
      MASON'.  Though we can t see what s going on inside the 
      office, both Fitch and Lieutenant Mason are mic d. 

                                  MASON (V.O.)
                    Sounds like an honest mistake.

                                  FITCH (V.O.)
                    It sounded like a god-damn clock 
                    radio went off in his pocket!  He's 
                      incompetent.

                                  MASON (V.O.)
                    You said that about your last 
                    partner.

      A phone RINGS.  Mason answers, aggravated-

                                  MASON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    What is it, Mrs. Dryden... She 
                    what?  Alright, hold on please. 
                          (then)
                    Joe, we are undermanned.  It s only 
                    his first day.  Give him a chance. 

                                  FITCH (V.O.)
                    Why the hell should..?!

                                  MASON (V.O.)
                    BECAUSE I SAID SO!                                                                                    14.



      A thick beat - then the door opens and Fitch exits, jilted at 
      finding the camera in his face.  As if sensing his angst, 
      CAMERA BACKS UP, letting him pass, revealing--

      LT. MASON, an AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN, (40 S) behind her desk.  
      She carries that look - overworked and underpaid.

                                  MASON (CONT'D)
                          (into phone, exasperated)
                    She's a teenager, Mrs. Dryden, they 
                    tend to listen to music at a high 
                    volume... You don't have to call 
                    the police, I am the police. 

      Mason gets up and pushes the door SHUT.  And text appears:

       LIEUTENANT MAUREEN MASON, 15 years Detroit Homicide. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      WASHINGTON - at his desk, on the phone with his wife.

                                  WASHINGTON
                    I'm not mad, baby, I want you to 
                    call me.  Next time'll be for real 
                    for sure.  Okay, love you too.

      He hangs up and looks at that BABY PHOTO as he let's us know-

                                  WASHINGTON (CONT'D)
                    False alarm.  Pre-mature 
                      contractions.  Again.  
                          (he sighs, then)
                    Day seemed to go pretty well.  A 
                    few bumps, but all in all..?  I 
                    think I made a good impression...

    A detective walks by and DRY HEAVES, mocking Washington s 
      episode at the pharmacy.  On nearby detectives, laughing.  

      Washington hangs there, trying to play it off, but his 
      unsteady grimace tells us even HE knows he s not off to an 
      auspicious beginning. 

      EXT. STREET - DETROIT - LATER THAT NIGHT

      In the case of the dead lawyer, we're on a street along the 
      river.  Police cruisers block traffic.  Officers walking the 
      ground with flash lights.

      WITH LONGFORD AND MAJAN - on the shoulder where an aluminum 
      barrier is broken.  Red fiberglass debris scattered around.                                                                                     15.



                                  MAJAN
                    Roman Red.  Same color as the 
                    lawyer's Corvette.  Looks like he 
                    tore off a piece of panel when he 
                    went through the barrier. 

                                  LONGFORD
                    Straight over the bank and SPLASH! 

      Majan looks off at the BELLE ISLAND CASINO ROTUNDA, about 
      five hundred yards down river.

                                  MAJAN 
                    Current carries him all the way to 
                    Belle Isle.

                                  COP (O.S.)
                    Hey!  Found glass over here!

      We follow Longford and Majan out into the middle of the 
      street where a COP has a flashlight beam on SPARKLING WINDOW 
      SHARDS.  Majan looks up, seeing a traffic light.

                                  MAJAN
                    Our victim stops at the light.  
                    Shooter approaches the vehicle; 
                    BANG!  Through the window.

                                  LONGFORD
                    Victim's at a stop.  How does he 
                    get in the river?

                                                                      HARD CUT TO:

      LATER - AS MAJAN AND LONGFORD walk briskly toward an office 
      building across the street, Majan informs us that- 

                                  MAJAN 
                    There's a security guard in this 
                    office building, here.  We're gonna 
                    talk to him.  Maybe he saw 
                      something.

      We follow Longford and Majan as they enter the building lobby 
      where a SECURITY GUARD waits for them--

                                  SECURITY GUARD
                          (rattled)
                    Officers, I just rolled back the 
                    security footage... I got it all.  

                                  LONGFORD
                    Excuse me?                                                                                    16.



                                  SECURITY GUARD
                    We have a perimeter security 
                    camera.  It caught the whole thing 
                    on tape.

      Longford and Majan trade a look, and we CUT TO:

      INT. OFFICE BUILDING - LOBBY   MOMENTS LATER

      Longford and Majan watch a security monitor.  The GUARD rolls 
      footage and we see a 57 Corvette coming to a stop at a light. 

                                  MAJAN 
                    There s our victim.

      They watch, riveted, as a white pick-up pulls behind the 
      Corvette.  A man gets out, a hat shadows his face as he walks 
      to the Vette's driver's side window - reaches in his pocket.

      And though our detectives know it s coming, the GUN MUZZLE 
      FLASH makes them FLINCH.  The shooter gets back in the truck 
      then rams the Vette, pushing it through the barrier.  As he 
      pulls away, the Security Guard FREEZES the tape on the TRUCK-

      A MORBID SILENCE.  They all stare at the screen, seemingly 
      mortified, until-

                                  LONGFORD 
                            (clinically)
                    Looks like a Chevy...

                                  MAJAN 
                    Nope.  Ford F-15O.  You can tell by 
                    the fog lights in the valance.  

      Now it's Longford who busts his know-it-all partner-

                                  LONGFORD
                    He s like Rain Man when it comes to 
                    cars.  Let's get patrol looking for 
                    this vehicle.

                                  MAJAN 
                    Yeah, a white Ford pick-up with 
                    possible front end damage.  
                          (sarcastic)
                    Can't be too many of those in 
                    Detroit. 

      But then they trade a serious and daunted look and we know, 
      this one's gonna be tough.

                                      END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    17.



                                            ACT TWO

      C.U. OF A PILE OF VOMIT

      on a desk.  PULL BACK TO FIND WASHINGTON grimacing at it.  As 
      he picks it up in one piece, we realize it's just a gag prop.  

      And now we see the CAMERA is capturing this from across the 
      room as snickering DETECTIVES pass between LENS and 
      Washington.  Washington sits down at his desk and drops the 
      fake vomit in the trash can.  Then, his desk phone RINGS-

                                  WASHINGTON
                          (answering)
                      Washington...

                                  FITCH (O.S.)
                    Having a baby.  Must feel really 
                      special...

      Washington looks over and we go WIDER to see Fitch is calling 
      from the very next desk.  But oddly, Fitch looks straight 
      ahead like he s talking to someone else- 

                                  FITCH (CONT'D)
                    Of course, there are over six 
                    billion people in the world.  Every 
                    one of them was a baby.  So when 
                    you put it in perspective, how 
                    special can it be?

      Washington glares at him in disbelief, then, into the phone-

                                  WASHINGTON 
                    We've had serious infertility 
                    issues.

                                  FITCH 
                    And I'm moved.  Truly.  But if that 
                      cell-phone goes off again in my 
                    presence you're going to have 
                    serious career issues.  Also, I 
                    don't like you very much.

      Fitch hangs up and stews a moment.  Then, as if the 
        conversation never happened, he swivels to face Washington-

                                  FITCH (CONT'D)
                    Check on James Roland?

      Completely thrown, Washington fumbles through papers-                                                                                    18.



                                  WASHINGTON
                      Uh...yeah, I talked to Corrections.  
                    He was arrested in Detroit last 
                    year on a Class Three B and E.  
                    Nothing violent, but it was his 
                    second offense.  He's doing 
                    fourteen months at Standish.  Due 
                    out in three. 

                                  FITCH
                    What about her boyfriend?

                                  WASHINGTON
                    Alvin Green.  I spoke to him.  He 
                    was at work all night.  His time 
                    line checks out. 

      Fitch nods - then SANCHEZ walks by.  Fitch, unaware the 
      camera is watching, subtly tracks her across the room.  She 
      just as subtly throws a look his way as she sits at her desk.

      We go TIGHT ON SANCHEZ, other detectives walk through the 
      frame as she picks up the phone-

                                    SANCHEZ
                    Boorman, it's Sanchez.  Listen, I'm 
                    working that pharmacy double...  
                    Yeah, pretty brutal stuff.  We're 
                    looking for four cases of Oxy; 
                    anything hits the street, you'll 
                    let me know..?

      INT. MORGUE - LATER THAT NIGHT

      WITH LONGFORD AND MAJAN, staring at MICHAEL ROSTIN'S BODY, 
      the attorney, lying on an exam table.  They look up, seeing-

      A PRETTY WOMAN, entering (35) but looks like 25. Cat glasses, 
      hipster vibe, last thing you're thinking is Medical Examiner.  
      She is DR. SHELBY CORK, and she has a mean BRUISE on her-

                                  MAJAN
                    What happened to your face?

                                  DR. CORK
                    I was going after the jammer but 
                    she crossed over and C-blocked me.  
                    Total rink rash.
                          (off their puzzled looks)
                    Roller derby.

      They nod - 'Oh', like they knew that.  She hands them a tray 
      with a BULLET SLUG in it.                                                                                    19.



                                  DR. CORK (CONT'D)
                    It bounced around in there, but I 
                    found it hiding under the 
                      cerebellum.

      Obviously farsighted, Longford holds the slug at arms length.

                                  LONGFORD
                    Can't really make the caliber...

                                  MAJAN
                    Looks like...

                                  CORK 
                    Nine millimeter.

                                  MAJAN
                    I was totally gonna say that.

                                  LONGFORD
                    9 mil.  That means we missed a 
                    bullet casing out on the street.  
                    Let's go get it.

      As they head out, she calls after-

                                  DR. CORK
                    Did you get that house in Tuscany?

                                  LONGFORD
                    I'll know tomorrow.

      INT. STATION   SQUAD ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

      ON A LARGE GREASE BOARD - a grid crammed full of open cases.

                                  MASON (O.S.)
                    We speak for those who can no 
                    longer speak for themselves.

      ON LT. MASON, sidearm prominently clipped to her belt.  She 
      nods to the grease board, telling us what they're up against-

                                  MASON (CONT'D)
                    Since the homicide rate went up, we 
                    had to add columns.  They don't 
                    make felt markers fine enough to 
                    write any smaller, so we've sorta 
                    hit capacity. 
                          (sighs)
                    Get  em solved, make room for the 
                    next one.  We might be the last 
                    assembly line in Detroit.                                                                                    20.



      FROM ACROSS THE SQUAD ROOM - We're on the pantry where 
      Washington and Sanchez fix coffee, unaware CAMERA is watching-

                                    SANCHEZ
                    It's a personality quirk.  He's not 
                    so good one on one...

                                  WASHINGTON
                    The man's a mental patient.  I 
                    mean, he's sitting right next to 
                    me.  He can't speak to me like a 
                    normal person..?

                                    SANCHEZ
                    So talk to him about it.

                                  WASHINGTON
                    Damn right, I'm gonna.

                                    SANCHEZ
                          (eyes widening)
                    Here's your chance.

      Washington stiffens - then whips around in a panic--

                                    SANCHEZ (CONT'D)
                    Made you look.

      Washington smirks - 'Very Funny.'  Sanchez goes dead serious-

                                    SANCHEZ (CONT'D)
                    Let me tell you something about 
                    Fitch...

      She looks at him blankly.  One-one-thousand.  Two-one-
      thousand.  Three-one-thousand.  Then--

                                    SANCHEZ (CONT'D)
                    That's about what I know.  And I've 
                    been here five years.  There's no 
                    pictures on his desk, he doesn't 
                    hang out after work, nobody really 
                      understands him and nobody tries.  
                    Why?  Because he gets results.  If 
                    I were you, I'd just suck it up and 
                    be grateful you got some one like 
                    Fitch watching your back. 

                                  WASHINGTON
                    Easy for you to say, where's your 
                    partner? 

      All sympathy drains from Sanchez's face-                                                                                     21.



                                    SANCHEZ
                    Two weeks ago my partner was 
                    walking his kid to school and he 
                    dropped dead of a brain aneurism.

      Washington stands there with an idiotic look on his face.  

                                  WASHINGTON
                    Hey, I'm really sor...

      But she exits, leaving him with his foot in his mouth.

      WITH FITCH - at his desk - on the phone-

                                  FITCH
                    She didn't have problems with 
                    anyone in class?  Okay, if you 
                    think of anything, you have my 
                    number.  Sorry to call you so late.

                                                                      HARD CUT TO:

      MOMENTS LATER - FITCH talks to camera, painfully 
      uncomfortable in front of it. 

                                  FITCH (CONT'D)
                    Shannon Hibbit's wounds would, 
                    uh... indicate something personal.  
                    To me.  You know, someone that knew 
                    her. So I'm calling her classmates.  
                    From college.  To see if it was 
                    someone that knew her, or... that 
                    she knew... of... in school. 

      He squints - 'That didn't come out right.'  Then he just gets 
      up and walks out of frame.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      THE MOON - over Detroit.  We go FAST MOTION.  Car lights 
      stream through the streets as the moon arcs down three hours 
      worth. 

      EXT. STREET - NIGHT

      Where the Corvette went into the river.  The crime scene is 
      closed down.  Longford and Majan scour the road with 
        flashlights.  Majan finds--

                                  MAJAN 
                    Here we go!  
                          (but then)
                    Strike that.  It's a 45.                                                                                    22.



      LATER - ON LONGFORD, kneeling in the gutter, finding- 

                                  LONGFORD
                    I got it.  Wait.  Wait.  Nope.  22. 

                                  MAJAN
                    This is what happens when you look 
                    for bullets in Detroit.  Let's call 
                    it a night.

                                  LONGFORD
                    Chi dorme non piglia pesci.  Those 
                    who sleep don t catch any fish...

      Majan looks over at the camera and rolls his eyes-

                                  MAJAN 
                    Have you met my partner, Inspector 
                    Berlitz?  I got nine more months of 
                    this...

      Longford stands, A CASING on the end of his pencil-

                                  LONGFORD 
                    Here we are!  Oh, baby.  Nine mil 
                    and fresh.  Can smell the powder.

      Majan walks over and takes a look-

                                  MAJAN
                    Let's hope we can pull a print.

      INT. STATION - SQUAD ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

      FOLLOWING MASON down the hall as she muses for the camera-

                                  MASON 
                    It's three a.m.  I got a parent 
                    teacher conference in five hours.  
                    Second one this month.  

      She stops at the elevator, then turns back, looking over the 
      cubicles, seeing Fitch and Washington at their desks-

                                  MASON (CONT'D)
                    You feel guilty being here, then 
                    you see that, and you feel guilty 
                    going home.  Doing this job... 
                    being a single mother...
                          (stepping onto elevator)
                    I think my kids understand.

      She doesn't know she's biting the inside of her lip - a tell.                                                                                      23.



      And as the doors close, we--

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. STATION HOUSE - DAWN

      A car rolls up.  Sanchez gets out and opens the rear door, 
      pulling out a CAUCASIAN MAN in cuffs. 

      INT. STATION - SQUAD ROOM - LATER THAT MORNING

      Fitch, Washington, and Sanchez look at a monitor showing the 
      Junkie sitting alone in the interrogation room--  

                                    SANCHEZ
                    Marcus Mosier, picked up on a 
                    parole violation.  Cops found this 
                    and called me.

      She hands Fitch a large pill bottle of-

                                    SANCHEZ (CONT'D)
                    Serial matches the batch of Oxy 
                    stolen from the pharmacy.  

                                  WASHINGTON
                    See?!  I knew it was a drug thing!

      Eying the camera, Fitch subdues his annoyance - smiles.

                                  FITCH
                    Let's go find out.

      Washington follows them toward the interrogation room.   
      Sanchez goes in, Fitch follows, closing the door in 
        Washington's face.  OFF WASHINGTON - awkwardly snubbed, we--

                                                                            CUT TO:

      A BLACK & WHITE VIDEO MONITOR - MOMENTS LATER

      Fitch and Sanchez sit across from Marcus Mosier.  He wears a 
      perma-grin as he obsessively scratches his arm-

                                  FITCH
                    Mr. Mosier, how're you doin today?

      The man rocks in his seat, staring into space.  Fitch and 
      Sanchez trade a look - 'He's wasted.'  Then-

      Fitch holds up the pill bottle.  He shakes it like a maraca, 
      moving it side to side until Marcus locks on to it with his 
      eyes.  Fitch centers.  And now, Marcus is focussed on him-                                                                                    24.



                                  FITCH (CONT'D)
                    Where'd you get this?

                                  MARCUS
                    Found it.  In Elmwood park.

                                  FITCH
                    When?

                                  MARCUS
                    Yesterday afternoon.

      Fitch scratches something on a piece of paper, covering it 
      with his hand.  He shows it to Sanchez.  She nods, then--

                                  FITCH
                    Let's review.  Yesterday you re 
                    skipping through a park in the 
                    HOOD; it's broad daylight, junkies 
                    and dealers everywhere you look, 
                    and you happen upon a bottle full 
                    of Oxycontin, just laying there in 
                    the grass like a dog turd.  On a 
                    scale of one to ten, ten being 
                    totally believable, this is how 
                    good that lie was...

      He holds up the paper - a giant  0  written on it.

                                    SANCHEZ
                    We know that bottle wasn t in the 
                    park yesterday.  That bottle was 
                    stolen from a pharmacy last night.  

                                  FITCH 
                    You know where you are Marcus?  
                    This is Homicide!

                                  MARCUS
                          (really nervous now)
                      Homicide..?

                                    SANCHEZ
                    Two people were killed in that 
                    pharmacy.  

                                  FITCH
                    And right now the only suspect we 
                    have is YOU!  

                                  MARCUS
                    I didn't kill nobody...                                                                                    25.



                                    SANCHEZ
                    A junkie who broke parole and just 
                    lied to the police.

                                  FITCH
                    How long do you think that trial 
                    lasts?

                                    SANCHEZ 
                    Ten minutes, life sentence, we get 
                    to Hong's in time for lunch.

                                  FITCH
                    LIFE! Say it with me, Marcus, LIFE!  

      Marcus freaks, stands, pacing, obsessively scratching his arm-

                                  MARCUS
                    Alright.  Straight up... Pooch sold 
                    it to me!

                                    SANCHEZ
                    What's Pooch's real name?

                                  MARCUS
                    We ain't on a real name basis.

                                  FITCH
                    Where do we find him?!

                                  MARCUS
                    You gotta call him...

                                    SANCHEZ
                    What's his number?

      Marcus stops in front of the video camera, so his torso is 
      engulfing the monitor-

                                  MARCUS (V.O.)
                    I don't know.  I wrote it down on a 
                    napkin.  I swear, I don't have it.

      WASHINGTON leans in to the monitor, watching Marcus scratch 
      his arm.  Seeing something the others can't, he presses the 
      intercom button, his voice ECHOES in the interrogation room-

                                  WASHINGTON 
                    On his arm... there's something on 
                    his arm...

      Marcus turns as Fitch drags him back, forcibly laying his arm 
      on the table - and now Fitch sees it too-                                                                                    26.



                                  FITCH 
                    Is this Pooch's number..? 

      Marcus stares back at him fearfully, then-

                                  MARCUS
                    You tell him I gave it to you, I'm 
                    dead, man. 

      ON WASHINGTON, watching the monitor as Fitch gives him an 
      approving nod, subtle, but Washington beams, 'Redemption.'

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. SQUAD ROOM - LATER THAT DAY

      DETECTIVE JOHN SMITH

      steps off of the elevator and walks through the squad room.  
      First thing you notice is his BLURRED FACE.  Then you notice 
      all the women in the office ogling him as he walks by.  A 
      woman turns to her co-worker, clearly mouthing, 'SO HOT!' 

      INT. SQUAD ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Smith jokes with detectives - all mugging for the camera-

                                  DETECTIVE 1
                          (pointing to Smith's face)
                    You re looking at the 'model 
                    officer'.  Literally. 

      In the B.G., we see Fitch watching Sanchez, who is smiling at 
      Smith like a school girl.

                                  MASON
                    That s what makes him so effective; 
                    no one ever suspects a face that 
                    pretty could belong to a cop.

      They laugh - FREEZE on Smith's BLURRED FACE as text appears:

       DETECTIVE JOHN SMITH, undercover unit.  Years on force?   A 
      beat, then - 'Confidential'

                                                                            CUT TO:

      LATER - SMITH is on a phone.  Fitch, Washington, and Sanchez 
      are gathered round listening in as a phone RINGS. In the 
      B.G., two office girls gawk at Smith from the copy machine. 

                                  POOCH (V.O.)
                    Yeah...                                                                                    27.



                                  SMITH
                    Pooch.

                                  POOCH (V.O.)
                          (suspicious beat, then)
                    Who's this?

                                  SMITH
                    Yogi.  Listen, man, I need...

                                  POOCH (V.O.)
                    Where'd you get my number?

                                  SMITH
                    Huh?

                                  POOCH (V.O.)
                    Who gave you my number?

                                  SMITH 
                    Chicklet.

                                  POOCH (V.O.)
                    I don't know no Chicklet.

                                  SMITH
                    You know Little D?

                                  POOCH (V.O.)
                    Everybody know Lil D.

      The Detectives laugh.  As if she were talking about the prom 
      king, Sanchez glows as she tells us-

                                    SANCHEZ 
                    Most popular street names in 
                    Detroit.  Every neighborhood either 
                    has a Chicklet or a Little D.
                          (gushing)
                    Genius.

      PULL FOCUS, in the B.G., we see Fitch roll his eyes-

                                  SMITH
                    D says you got some Oxy.  Can you 
                    hook me up?

                                  POOCH (V.O.)
                    What're you driving?

                                  SMITH 
                    Green Celica.                                                                                    28.



      Another long beat.  Sanchez crosses her fingers-

                                  POOCH (V.O.)
                    Gran Liquor on Warren.  Gimme two 
                    hours.  

      Sanchez high-fives SMITH, and we--

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. FITCH'S CAR   LATER THAT DAY

      Fitch and Washington, parked at a distance, watch Smith, 
      waiting in his Green Celica in a liquor store parking lot.  
      Aggravated, Fitch looks at his watch.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      SANCHEZ - in a car, parked up the block, muses out loud-

                                    SANCHEZ 
                    Pooch is forty-five minutes late.  
                    I worked patrol, vice, narcotics.  
                    Hands down, dealers are the worst.  
                    Never on time.  Prostitutes..?  
                    Very punctual.  Guess when time is 
                    money, you don't mess around...

      Radio traffic crackles in-

                                  COP (V.O.) 
                    I got a suspicious Brown Buick 
                    Regal heading South on 14th.

      Sanchez sees the Buick coming down the road-

                                    SANCHEZ
                    Fitch, he's coming your way.

      BACK WITH FITCH AND WASHINGTON - watching the Buick as it 
      drives by the liquor store lot   slows - then keeps going.  
      Washington picks up the radio-

                                  FITCH
                    Hold tight, he's just doing a lap. 

      Washington leers at him - then, sure enough -- the Buick 
      makes a U-turn.  Fitch gets on his radio-

                                  FITCH (CONT'D)
                    Okay, he's circling back.  When the 
                      undercover takes off his hat, we 
                    move.                                                                                    29.



      The Buick pulls into the lot.  Smith gets out of his car.  He 
      walks over to the Buick and leans on the window sill.  

                                  FITCH (CONT'D)
                          (into radio)
                    Wait for it.

                                    SANCHEZ (V.O.) (OVER RADIO)
                    Hold up, we got metro...

      Fitch and Washington see a police cruiser slow on the street.

                                  FITCH 
                          (into radio/urgent)
                    Dispatch, I have a cruiser on 14th 
                    and Warren about to interfere with 
                    an operation, I need you to call 
                    him off immediat...

      But it s too late, POOCH spots the cruiser and drives away 
      from Smith, who yanks off his hat, waving it furiously - and 
      now THERE S A CHASE ON!

      Fitch tears off, pulling in behind Pooch's vehicle.  And what 
      happens next is chaos.  The door opens up on the Buick and 
      Pooch bails out on foot   but he leaves the car running   
      heading toward a Dollar Market FULL OF PEOPLE-

      Washington bails out of the car, going after Pooch and we CUT 
      HARD TO: 

      A B&W DASH-MOUNTED-CAM from the police car behind Fitch's 
      vehicle, seeing the CAMERAMAN go out after Washington.  

      It then follows Fitch as he tears after the driverless 
      vehicle, clipping its tail, fishtailing it in order to stop 
      it before it slams into the storefront.

                                                                      HARD CUT TO:

      WASHINGTON chasing Pooch on foot.  The CAMERAMAN PANTS trying 
      to catch his breath as he trails Washington down the street.  
      Washington is a pit-bull, charging after Pooch - over a chain 
      link fence - through a back yard and out of sight.

      CAMERA RUNS through the yard, around a house, finally finding-

      Washington straddling Pooch on a front lawn.  Pooch fights.  
      Washington impressively wrestles him into a submission hold. 

                                  WASHINGTON
                    Where're you going, Pooch?!                                                                                    30.



                                  POOCH
                    I don't know no Pooch!

                                  WASHINGTON
                    Really?  Then why's his name 
                    tattooed to your neck?!

      As Washington struggles to cuff Pooch, an awkwardly funny 
      situation unfolds as we hear   ROCKABYE BABY .  An  OH SHIT  
      look on Washington s face.  Could this timing be any worse?  

      Unable to get a hold on Pooch, Washington cuffs his foot to a 
      plastic kiddie slide.  He stands, answering the phone in a 
      pant-

                                  WASHINGTON (CONT'D)
                    Honey..?  You sure?  Feel any 
                      discomfort in your pelvic area..?  
                    Then it s just a false contraction.

      And now Washington s stress is beginning to show-

                                  WASHINGTON (CONT'D)
                    Honey, I love you, but you gotta 
                      understand, this is my first day...

      And she s obviously giving him an earful of hormonal hell 
      because he can barely get a word in edgewise-

                                  WASHINGTON (CONT'D)
                    I know it s our first baby, baby, 
                    but... 

      As he tries to reason with his wife, the absurd circumstances 
      escalate behind his back as Pooch tries to get away, dragging 
      the whole plastic slide apparatus with him down the street.  

      And poor Washington has no idea because his wife is 
      absolutely giving it to him.  We can hear her HIGH PITCHED 
      SQUAWK-RANT bleeding out of his phone.  But it's just about 
      all he can take, cause he finally cracks, yelling-

                                  WASHINGTON (CONT'D)
                    No, all I m saying is don t call me 
                    again until the water breaks!

      He hangs up, frustrated, then turns, seeing Pooch - 'Shit!'  
      He charges after, tackling him ungracefully just as cruisers 
      are pulling up-- 

                                        END ACT TWO                                                                                    31.



                                          ACT THREE


      INT. STATION   SQUAD ROOM - LATER THAT DAY

      ON WASHINGTON - apprehensive-  

                                  WASHINGTON
                    I don't know, man...

      ON FITCH - assured-

                                  FITCH
                    Your collar, your interview. 

      ON MASON AND SANCHEZ - looking not so sure-

                                  WASHINGTON
                          (psyching himself up)
                    Okay.  Alright... I m gonna slay 
                    this fool.

      Washington takes a fast, deep breath.  He shakes loose, then 
      walks around the corner.  Mason turns to Fitch--

                                  MASON
                    No weapon, no prints... Things are 
                    looking mighty circumstantial right 
                    now.  We need a confession.

                                  FITCH
                    I know what we need.

      ON THE MONITOR NOW - Washington walks in the interrogation 
      room and sit down across from Pooch, who sips a soda.

                                  WASHINGTON
                    Okay, Pooch, how're you doin today?

                                  POOCH
                    BLEEP you.

      Washington CRICKS his neck, keeping his composure-

                                  MASON
                    This guy is out of his league, Joe.

      But Fitch doesn't answer - he's focussed on the monitor.

                                  WASHINGTON
                    You wanna tell me where you were 
                    last night?                                                                                    32.



                                  POOCH
                    Thought you knew, Peaches.  I was 
                    BLEEPING your wife in the BLEEP  
                    And after that she BLEEPED my BLEEP 
                    and I BLEEPED all over her BLEEPS! 
                    I'd Fabrize that bed if I were you.

                                  WASHINGTON
                          (losing it)
                    You know where you are BLEEP-hole?! 

                                  POOCH
                    I know where YOU are.  NOWHERE..!
                    You ain't got BLEEP on me, punk. 

      Washington displays an embarrassing lack of control as the 
      interrogation turns on him, becoming an all out BLEEP-FEST. 

                                  POOCH (CONT'D)
                    Look at you, green as a BLEEPIN 
                    Martian.  What is this, Training 
                    Day?  You BLEEPITY-BLEEP-BLEEPER.

      The other detectives wince at that one - 'That hurts.'

                                    SANCHEZ 
                    See?  Now this makes me want to 
                    throw up.

                                  POOCH
                    We're done.  

                                  WASHINGTON
                    Not till I BLEEPING say we're done!

                        POOCHWASHINGTON 
      I can stop you with one word.  You're not calling the shots, 
      Let's count it down; three, G!  You best start helping 
      two.. one.... yourself...

                                  POOCH
                    LAWYER!

      And Washington goes quiet.  Pooch grins, defiant.

      SANCHEZ looks at her watch-

                                    SANCHEZ 
                    That was quick.

                                  MASON
                    Great.  Why the hell'd you send him 
                    in there?                                                                                    33.



                                  FITCH 
                    I want this guy to think he's 
                    smarter than us.

                                  MASON
                      Apparently he is smarter than us.  
                    He just invoked his right to an 
                    attorney.  We can't question him 
                    anymore.

                                  FITCH
                    I don't need to question him.

      And with that, Fitch walks around the corner and--

      ON THE MONITOR - Washington sees Fitch enter.  He gets up and 
      exits frame.  A moment, and WASHINGTON comes around the 
      corner to pats on the back from other detectives-

                                  SMITH
                          (blatantly sarcastic)
                    Awesome, man.

                                    SANCHEZ
                    Textbook.

      Mason LEERS at Washington, who grimaces - 'Sorry.' 

      BACK ON THE MONITOR - Fitch sits down across from Pooch.  He 
      puts his chin on his hand and stares at Pooch, unblinking- 

                                  POOCH
                    What is this, the silent treatment?  
                    You wanna have a staring contest?  
                    Fine, go ahead.  Enjoy yourself. 

      Fitch doesn't move a muscle.  A long beat, then-

                                  MASON
                    The hell is he doing?

      ON THE MONITOR - FITCH stares at Pooch.  Pooch laughs.

      WE GO FAST MOTION ON THE MONITOR - POOCH shifts in his seat - 
      Pacing.  Stretching.   All the while, FITCH is like a statue - 
      unmoving as AN HOUR OF TIME CODE passes on the monitor.

      -INTERCUT OUR DETECTIVES, now sitting in chairs, watching.  
      Smith nods off, almost falling over in his seat.

      ON THE MONITOR - finally, Pooch breaks the silence-                                                                                    34.



                                  POOCH 
                    Okay, you're freaking me out.  You 
                    gonna charge me?  Then charge me.  
                    At least get me another soda.

      Fitch glares back - motionless-

      RESUME FAST MOTION - Pooch's hands move wildly, he gets up, 
      sits down - his voice a garbled stream of TREBLE BABBLE as 20 
      MINUTES OF TIME CODE PASS and then we slow down-

      FITCH is still staring, frozen.  But Pooch is now talking - 

                                  POOCH (CONT'D)
                    Christmas morning.  No heat.  No 
                    toys.  Mama's all screamin, "Get 
                    your shoes on!"  Baby's cryin, four 
                    hour bus ride up to Standish.  Wait 
                    in line for two hours, then we get 
                    in there, the old man looks at me, 
                    you know what he says?  "Stay in 
                    school, son.  Stay in school."  Can 
                    you believe that?  

      RESUME FAST MOTION - Fitch still - Pooch moving - talking - 
      Sanchez enters and hands him a box of tissues, she exits, and 
      we SLOW DOWN to find Pooch is now crying-

                                  POOCH (CONT'D)
                    You don t know how hard it is out 
                    there, man.  It's hard...  
                          (wiping away tears)
                    I can t do it, no more, a'ight?  
                    Straight up; I took the Oxy, I did.
                          (eyes to heaven)
                    I'm sorry, daddy.  I'm sorry...

      INTERCUT - OUR DETECTIVES - watching the interview   
      ecstatic, trading high fives.  Washington looks on stunned. 
      Mason excitedly informs us-

                                  MASON 
                    Pooch just put himself inside the 
                    pharmacy.  That's huge.

      ON THE MONITOR - realizing he just incriminated himself-

                                  POOCH
                    Wait, hold up yo... I didn't kill 
                    no one.  Those people were dead 
                    when I walked in there.  I was at 
                    the Indian Casino, I swear!                                                                                     35.



      But it s too late.  And Fitch, having never uttered a single 
      word, gets up and walks out to pats on the back. 

                                  MASON
                    Nice job, Joe.

      Smith, face blurred, excitedly points at Fitch-

                                  SMITH 
                    Marathon man right here... a 
                    friggin legend, this guy.

      Sanchez shoots Fitch a subtle grin.  Everyone's riding high- 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      LATER - WITH MAJAN, as he sits on Sanchez's desk.

                                  MAJAN
                    I hear somebody's getting a new 
                    partner next week.  A Texan.

                                    SANCHEZ
                          (dreading it)
                    Yeah, six years Dallas homicide; 
                    you just know he's gonna show up in 
                    a ten gallon hat. 

                                  MAJAN
                    Look on the bright side; 
                          (indicating himself)
                    finally cowboys and Indians will be 
                    on the same team.

      She laughs.  Then - Longford walks by without stopping-

                                  LONGFORD
                    Bullet that killed our lawyer might 
                    finger the shooter.  They pulled a 
                    partial thumb off the casing...

      And Majan is on his heels, following Longford.  CUT TO:

      A DYNAMIC AFRICAN AMERICAN fingerprint analyst, THE PRINCE OF 
      PRINTS (30 S).  And you just have to smile at this guy's 
      spirit as he mugs for the camera-  

                                  PRINCE OF PRINTS 
                    That's my ten most wanted.  FBI's 
                    got theirs, I got mine.  

      ON 10 ENLARGED FINGERPRINTS taped to the wall like a gallery. 
      As he preps the print, Longford and Majan proudly inform us--                                                                                     36.



                                  LONGFORD 
                    They don't call him the Prince of 
                    Prints for nothing.

                                  PRINCE OF PRINTS 
                    That's right, baby.  Do the crime, 
                    you best leave nothing behind; 
                    finger prints, palm prints, foot 
                    prints, ass prints, you name it, 
                    I ll claim it.  I am the MC of the 
                    FPDB.  The Ace of Trace, that s me.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. INDIAN CASINO - SECURITY ROOM - LATER THAT DAY

      ON a very solemn Fitch and Washington - looking at video 
        surveillance of Pooch at a card table.  A TIME CODE READS-

                                  WASHINGTON
                    8:51 P.M.  

      Fitch turns to the CASINO GUARD overseeing the monitor bank-

                                  FITCH
                    Is this accurate?

                                  GUARD
                    To the second.

                                  WASHINGTON
                    The pharmacy homicides happened 
                    between 8:23 and 8:47.  At the time 
                    of the murders, Pooch was still at 
                    the casino.  Guess he was telling 
                    the truth...

      Aggravated, Fitch brushes past CAMERA and walks out the door-

      BACK ON THE MONITOR BANK - where we see Fitch storming 
      through the casino from nine different angles.

      INT. STATION - SQUAD ROOM - LATER THAT DAY

      ON THE PRINCE OF PRINTS - smiling wide-

                                  PRINCE OF PRINTS
                    There it is!  

      ON HIS COMPUTER - a photo and rap sheet of a Caucasian man  

                                  PRINCE OF PRINTS (CONT'D)
                    James Roland.  Twenty eight.                                                                                      37.



      ON MAJAN AND LONGFORD - a SPARK in both their eyes--

      And now we're on the move, FOLLOWING THEM briskly down the 
      hall to THE BIG BOARD.  They look up at - JAMES ROLAND'S name-

                                  MAJAN
                    James Roland.  Eliminated as a 
                    person of interest in the murder of 
                    Shannon Hibbit.

                                  LONGFORD
                    He just got a hell of a lot more 
                      interesting, didn't he?

      INT. FAST FOOD RESTAURANT   LATER THAT DAY

      Washington sits down with a burger combo.  He bites into his 
      burger - and then - his phone rings.  He answers, mouth full-

                                  WASHINGTON
                      Washington...

                                  FITCH (O.S.)
                    You lost control of that interview.

      WIDEN TO SEE IT S FITCH, calling him from across the table.  
      Fitch eats his lunch, not even looking at Washington.

                                  FITCH (CONT'D)
                    It's not about what you know, it's 
                    about what they THINK you know, and 
                    the more you lose your cool, the 
                    more they know you don't know 
                    anything.  Hold on a sec.

      Fitch covers the mouthpiece then looks up at Washington-

                                  FITCH (CONT'D)
                     Pass the ketchup?

      Washington glares at Fitch a beat - then passes the ketchup.

                                  FITCH (CONT'D)
                    Thanks.

      Fitch pours ketchup on his plate as he gets back on the phone- 

                                  FITCH (CONT'D)
                    Control is everything.  If you 
                    can t handle a suspect, ask for 
                    help.  Don t ever forget that.                                                                                     38.



      Fitch hangs up and goes back to his meal.  Washington puts 
      down his burger, appetite gone.  Then, his phone RINGS.  He 
      looks at Fitch, sure it isn't him calling again, he answers-

                                  WASHINGTON
                      Washington...
                          (listens, then to Fitch)
                    James Roland's print just came up 
                    in another homicide.

                                  FITCH
                    James Roland's in prison.

                                  WASHINGTON
                    He made parole yesterday.

      Off their incredulous faces, we - SMASH CUT TO:

      FOLLOWING SANCHEZ, running down the hall.  She barges into 
      Mason's office.  Majan and Longford are there.  Mason is on 
      the phone, furious-

                                  MASON
                    ...no, but when Department of 
                      Corrections tells me a guy's in 
                    prison, I gotta trust he's not down 
                    the street having a slice...!  
                    Twenty four hour clerical backlog? 
                    Really, that's your explanation?!!

      She cups the phone and looks up at Sanchez - 'What?'

                                    SANCHEZ
                    You re not gonna believe this; 
                    units responded to a homicide.  
                    Victim was shot outside his office  
                    They found a White Ford PICK-UP at 
                    the scene.  He was James Roland's 
                    parole officer.

      They all trade eyes.  Then, into the phone-

                                  MASON
                    Your clerical backlog just killed 
                    somebody!

      She slams the phone down, then turns to the others, grave-

                                  MASON (CONT'D)
                    We got a spree killer.

                                      END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    39.



                                  ACT FOUR

      INT. STATION - SQUAD ROOM   LATER THAT DAY

      The entire squad room gathered.  Sanchez is at a grease board 
      drawing out time lines-

                                    SANCHEZ 
                    Okay, 7:13 last night, James Roland 
                    tracks down his ex-wife's divorce 
                    attorney, Michael Rostin; following 
                    him home from the office.  He 
                    catches him at a light, shoots him 
                    and runs his vehicle into the river 
                    where it's discovered three hours 
                    later.  Around 8:30 P.M., James 
                    Roland enters Woodrow's pharmacy.  
                    Kills the pharmacy's owner, David 
                    Sung, 'wrong place wrong time', 
                    then kills his ex-wife, Shannon 
                    Hibbit.  Around 10 this morning, 
                    James Roland is waiting in the 
                    Detroit Metro Parole office parking 
                    lot.  His parole officer shows up 
                    for work... James Roland commits 
                    homicide number four, leaving his 
                    white Ford pick-up at the scene.

                                  WASHINGTON
                    I don't get it, this guy was a two 
                    time nonviolent offender.

                                  MASON 
                    Yeah, well he's on a rampage, now.  
                    Something made him snap.  

                                  FITCH
                    Time line's too precise.  He 
                    planned it inside.  Sit in a prison 
                    cell long enough; alone in your 
                    head; crazy thoughts start making 
                    sense.  He acted on them the second 
                    they let him out.  We should get a 
                    unit over to June Roland's house. 

                                  MASON
                    Longford, Majan, head to the parole

                    Sanchez, distribute his photo to

      INTERCUT - VARIOUS POLICE CRUISERS, patrolling the street.

                    Suspect should be considered armed 
                    and dangerous.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. OUTDOOR PARKING LOT - LATER THAT DAY

      A SIGN reads: 'DETROIT METRO PAROLE OFFICE PARKING ONLY.'

      A crime scene in progress.  As Longford and Majan search a 
      WHITE PICK-UP TRUCK, a uniformed cop approaches -

                                  UNIFORMED COP
                    The parole officer's vehicle is 
                    missing.  A blue Ford Focus.

      Longford walks to the front of the truck, which is mangled 
      and tainted with red paint.  A pool of oil under the vehicle. 

                                  LONGFORD 
                    That must have happened when he ran 
                    the Vette off the road.

      Majan opens the glove box, pulling something out-- 

                                  MAJAN
                    Uh oh.  This isn't a good sign!  

      EXT. STATION   SQUAD ROOM - LATER THAT DAY

      FOLLOWING WASHINGTON - he enters Mason's office, finding 
      Fitch sitting across Mason's desk-

                                  WASHINGTON 
                    Files came over from the attorney's 
                    office.  Shannon was granted sole 
                    custody of their two children.  
                    Parole officer testified at the 
                    hearing, probably sealed the deal.  

                                  MASON
                    Roland's getting his revenge.                                                                                    41.



      Fitch's cell RINGS.  He answers--

                                  FITCH
                    Fitch...

      INTERCUT MAJAN - looking at the note-

                                  MAJAN
                    I found an old family photo in 
                    James Roland's truck.  Roland, 
                    Shannon, and the kids.  There's 
                    writing on the back.  All it says 
                    is, "Together Forever."

      BACK ON FITCH - looking grave as he turns to Mason--

                                  FITCH
                    He's trying to get his family back.  

                                  WASHINGTON
                    Why does he kill his ex-wife?

                                  FITCH
                    Murder suicide; it's the only way 
                    they can all be together.  
                          (on the move)
                    He's going after his kids!  

      And Washington rushes after him.  OFF MASON'S WORRIED FACE, 
      we see family photos on her desk of her two daughters. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. JUNE ROLAND'S HOUSE - LATER - EVENING

      Fitch and Washington walk through the house - now ransacked.  
      A COP tells Fitch and Washington-

                                  COP
                    Came over here as soon as we got 
                    the call.  Place was already 
                    tossed.  Entry was made through a 
                    back window. 

                                  WASHINGTON 
                          (to camera)
                    We sent out a car, hoping to find 
                    June Roland and the kids here, 
                    but... we may have been too late.

      ON FITCH, finding a pile of photos strewn on the floor.  He 
      picks up a HAPPY PHOTO of JAMES ROLAND AND THE KIDS.  Another 
      of JUNE ROLAND AND THE KIDS.                                                                                     42.



      ON ANOTHER UNIFORM, COP 2, walking in-

                                  COP 2 
                    Neighbor has some information.

                                                                      HARD CUT TO:

      OUTSIDE - Fitch and Washington interview an OLD LADY- 

                                  OLD LADY
                    June left last night.  Said she was 
                    going to a friend's who could help 
                    her look after the kids.  It's so 
                    awful, what happened to Shannon...

                                  FITCH
                    She tell you where she was going?

                                  OLD LADY
                    No.  But Shannon s boyfriend, 
                    Alvin; he would know.  He came and 
                    helped her with the bags. 

                                                                      HARD CUT TO:

      FOLLOWING FITCH AND WASHINGTON back to their car-

                                  WASHINGTON
                          (on the phone)
                    Alvin Greene's not answering.  
                          (looking at his pad)
                    1-4-7, Trent Ave.  That's all the 
                    way across town...

                                  FITCH
                          (already on his phone)
                    Majan, you still at the parole 
                    office..?  Good, Shannon Hibbit had 
                      a boyfriend, Alvin Greene.  He 
                    knows where the kids are and James 
                    Roland may be looking for him.  1-4-
                    7 Trent Ave...  Yeah, you're 
                    closer...  Okay, meet you there.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. ALVIN GREEN'S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER 

      Longford and Majan pull on Kevlar vests, watching as SWAT 
      cops move on the house.  Two SWAT officers sidle the front 
      door.  They pound on it.                                                                                      43.



                                  SWAT OFFICER 1
                    POLICE, open up.  POLICE!

      No answer.  The officers turn to Longford and Majan.  
      Longford nods, then - They KICK IN THE DOOR and rush inside.

      INT. ALVIN GREEN'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

      On a photo of ALVIN GREEN, AFRICAN AMERICAN, and Shannon, arm 
      and arm.  Pull out WIDER to a mess - furniture toppled, etc. 

                                  LONGFORD
                    Roland may have forced Mr. Green to 
                    go with him. 

      Majan kneels down, looking at BLOOD on the wood floor-

                                  MAJAN
                    Still wet.  They can t be more than 
                    five, ten minutes aw...

        A CRACK-CRACK-CRACK echoes distant, faint but ominously 
      distinct - GUNSHOTS.  Everybody trades eyes - and then we're 
      following them, running out the door-

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      EXT. STREET   MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

      Longford, Majan, and two cruisers pull up to an intersection 
      where an accident has just occurred.  As they get out, we see 
      Fitch and Washington pulling up-

      MOMENTS LATER - The Detectives talk to a driver.

                                  DRIVER
                    He runs the light and hits me.  I 
                    get out to see if he's okay and he 
                    friggin' takes a shot at me.

                                  LONGFORD 
                    Can you give us a description?

                                  DRIVER
                    Yeah, white and crazy! 

      AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN comes forward, a pedestrian.

                                  WOMAN WITNESS
                    It was the same car my son drives.  
                    A blue Ford Focus.  And only one of 
                    those fools was white.                                                                                    44.



      The detectives trade a wary look, and as they scramble to 
      their vehicles, Majan is on his radio-

                                  MAJAN 
                    Blue Ford Focus heading east on 
                    Mack Ave.  Suspect may have a 
                    hostage in the vehicle... 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MINUTES LATER - FITCH and WASHINGTON   IN A CAR - prowling 
      the streets.  Washington let's us know-

                                  WASHINGTON 
                    What we have here is kind of an all 
                    hands on deck situation.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      WITH LONGFORD and MAJAN   BACK IN THEIR CAR   MOVING 

      Majan drives, but both eye the street as they tell us-

                                  MAJAN 
                    Every cop in Detroit is now looking 
                    for this vehicle.  Alvin Green may 
                    be a hostage...

                                  LONGFORD 
                    Not only are we worried about his 
                    personal safety...

                                  MAJAN 
                    But we suspect he s the only one 
                    who knows where June Roland and the 
                    kids are.  

                                  LONGFORD 
                    So we d like to find him in one... 
                          (seeing a)
                    PIZZA MAN!  PIZZA MAN!!

      He grips the arm rest as Majan SWERVES hard, narrowly missing 
      a car with a PIZZA DELIVER sign on the roof.  Then, calmly-

                                  MAJAN
                    I saw it.

                                  LONGFORD 
                    Yeah, you saw it after I told you. 
                    The way you drive... where do you 
                    think you are, Calcutta?  Gesu che 
                    scopa Cristo!                                                                                    45.



      INTERCUT - HELICOPTER VIEW - the searchlight scours the 
      street.  VARIOUS SHOTS of squad cars   trolling the streets.

      SANCHEZ - in her vehicle, joining the hunt.  CLOSE ON A PHOTO 
      OF A COP IN UNIFORM, clipped to her visor as she tells us-  

                                    SANCHEZ
                    My partner hated my driving, so I 
                    never had to watch the road and 
                    keep a look out at the same time.  
                    He used to call me 'Shotgun'...

      A BLUE CAR WHIPS PAST her going the opposite way.  She looks 
      over her shoulder, directly into camera and SHOUTS-- 

                                    SANCHEZ (CONT'D)
                    HOLD ON!

      She RIPS a U-turn.  As she races to catch his tail lights 
      ahead, Sanchez barks into her radio--

                                    SANCHEZ (CONT'D)
                    I gotta Blue Ford Focus heading 
                    East on Temple, approaching Cass!

      The Ford Focus swerves.  Sanchez takes the corner and is fast 
      after him.  CAMERA ZOOMS through the windshield, focussing on 
      a head, bobbing in the passenger seat of the fleeing vehicle.

                                    SANCHEZ (CONT'D)
                    That must be the boyfriend.

      The Ford Focus runs a red light, almost hitting cross traffic 
        Sanchez slows - then goes through after him, SIREN WAILING.

      And just when she pulls onto a straight away, catching up to 
      the suspect, something unbelievable happens - the passenger 
      door of the Ford Focus swings open, and...

      A MAN - rolls out of the car and into the road.  Sanchez has 
      to SWERVE HARD to keep from hitting the guy as he tumbles 
      like a rag doll toward their vehicle.

      A parked car comes on fast   SMASH!  Sanchez plows into it, 
      careening up onto the curb and toward a vacant shop window. 
      Sanchez's vehicle SMASHES through the window then crashes 
      into empty shelf racks.  The camera lens SPIDER CRACKS. 

      INTERCUT - FITCH as the call comes over the radio-

                                  DISPATCHER
                    Officer involved, 2423 Temple...                                                                                    46.



      We see the intensity on Fitch s face as he pins the gas, 
      racing to the scene, knowing Sanchez is in trouble.  It's 
      amplified by Washington, who's looking at Fitch, sensing it. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. SCENE OF THE ACCIDENT - MINUTES LATER - NIGHT

      Fitch and Washington arrive at the scene just as other 
      cruisers are pulling up. 

      CAMERA GOES OUT WITH WASHINGTON, following him, pushing 
      through the civilians who are clustered around - ALVIN GREEN, 
      lying in the road   a bloody mess.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      CAMERA POV THROUGH A CRACKED LENS - from the back seat.  
      Though it's dark, we see Sanchez in the front seat, hand on 
      her head.  She looks over her shoulder at the CAMERA--

                                    SANCHEZ
                    You alright?

                                  CAMERA MAN (O.S.)
                    ...think so...

      The BACK DOOR OPENS, CAMERA TURNS to find FITCH.  We see the 
      Camera Man's hand reach out beyond the lens, grabbing Fitch's 
      hand.  The CAMERA MAN grunts as Fitch pulls him out.  

      Then, CAMERA turns on Fitch, now trying to open Sanchez's 
      door.  Sanchez is in the passenger seat - dazed.

                                    SANCHEZ
                    I'm stuck.

      Fitch turns to CAMERA and reaches out--

                                  FITCH 
                    Lemme borrow that.

      CAMERA POV as it swings wildly toward the passenger window. 

                                  FITCH (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    There's gonna be glass!

      CAMERA POV as Sanchez turns her face away.  CAMERA POV SWINGS 
      back, then LAUNCHES toward the glass, like a battering ram--
      SMASH!  And we go to BLACK.  OVER BLACK WE HEAR--

                                  FITCH (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    I got you.  Here we go.                                                                                    47.



      We hear GRUNTING.  Then, a relieved sigh.

                                  FITCH (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    That's gonna need a few stitches.  
                    You okay?

                                    SANCHEZ (V.O.)
                    I am now.  Thanks.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. ALLEY   LATER THAT NIGHT

      Longford, Majan, and a shit load of cops are clustered around 
      a blue Ford Focus.  A helicopter is in the sky, search light 
      scanning the yards in the neighborhood.

                                  MAJAN 
                          (on his cell phone)
                    Yeah, we found the car.  He s on 
                    foot.  Who knows, maybe he stole 
                    another vehicle. 

      Longford crawls out of the car-

                                  LONGFORD 
                          (shouts)
                    What s the status on the 
                      boyfriend?!

      INT. CAR - MOVING - LATER THAT NIGHT

      Washington drives, following a speeding ambulance.  We can 
      hear Fitch, who's mic is also picking up the paramedic. 

                                  FITCH (V.O.)
                    Alvin.  ALVIN.  I know you can hear 
                    me... 

                                  PARAMEDIC (V.O.)
                    I have a faint pulse, pupils 
                    dilated.  Unresponsive--

                                  FITCH (V.O.)
                    Where are Shannon's kids...?  

                                  PARAMEDIC (V.O.)
                    Hey!  You shouldn't be in here..!

                                  FITCH (V.O.)
                    Can't you give him something to 
                    wake him up?!                                                                                    48.

                    He's gonna die if you don t get the 
                    hell out of the way! 

                                  FITCH (V.O.)
                    Stop! 
                          (a beat, then)
                    STOP THE VEHICLE!

      The ambulance slows, but before it even stops, its rear doors 
      fling open and Fitch jumps out, running toward us.  As the 
      ambulance takes off, Fitch gets in the passenger seat-

                                  FITCH (CONT'D)
                    Station!

                                  WASHINGTON
                    What'd he say?

                                  FITCH 
                    Nothing.  He ain't gonna make it.

                                  WASHINGTON
                    Jesus, shouldn't we follow him?

                                  FITCH
                    For what?!  I don't work for the 
                    dead, I work for the living. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

        A PHOTOGRAPH 

      of JUNE ROLAND and the TWO KIDS that Fitch took from her 
      apartment. 

                                  MASON (V.O.)
                    We are asking anyone with 
                      information on the whereabouts of 
                    June Roland and these children... 

      And we see Mason making this plea before a crew of local news 
      cameras, broadcasting the feed live across Detroit. 

                                  MASON (CONT'D)
                    To please contact law enforcement 
                      immediately.  We believe they are 
                    in imminent danger.

      INT. SQUAD ROOM   LATER - NIGHT

      MOVING ACROSS cubicles, detectives answer RINGING phones-                                                                                    49.



                                  DETECTIVE 1
                    No, sir... She's Caucasian, the 
                    kids are African American...

                                  DETECTIVE 2 
                    Ma'am, this line is for emergency 
                    calls only...

      WASHINGTON STANDS, visible above the cubicles.  He's snapping 
      his fingers - hailing everybody over.  AS WE APPROACH, he 
      cups the phone-

                                  WASHINGTON
                    I got a family friend of June 
                    Roland's who just saw the news 
                    report at work.  She says June and 
                    the kids are staying at her 
                      apartment.  

                                  FITCH
                    Let's get 'em on the phone. 

                                  WASHINGTON
                    There's no land line there.  She 
                    only has a cell and she's at work. 

      EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING   LATER THAT NIGHT

      We're with Longford, Majan, Washington, Fitch, and a bunch of 
      cops, standing outside a door on the ground floor.  Fitch 
      knocks!

                                  FITCH
                    Police.  Open the door, please.

      He knocks again.  A moment, then   WE HEAR -- A SHOTGUN PUMP-
      Washington CHARGES FITCH, knocking him out of the way, just 
      as- BOOM!  Shotgun Pellets splinter the door-

      CAMERA JOLTS as the cops dive for cover.  Camera finds - 
      Fitch, glaring at Washington like he wants to say something, 
      but he's shell-shocked and speechless -

                                  WASHINGTON
                    I guess he's already here.

                                      END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                    50.



                                          ACT FIVE

      EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING   LATER THAT NIGHT

      ON A WINDOW   a curtain draws back.  A child s face appears, 
      peeking out.

      ON A MASS OF POLICE ACTIVITY outside the building.  The 
      entire area cordoned off.  Helicopters hover overhead.  Swat-

      ON FITCH - looking at the little boy, who seems to be looking 
      back at him - just like he did at June Roland's house.  And 
      we GO EVEN CLOSER, seeing that INTENSITY on his face.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      ON WASHINGTON - walking through the scene, informing us- 

                                  WASHINGTON
                    Going on two hours, here.  The rest 
                    of the building's been evacuated.  
                    James Roland has blockaded himself 
                    inside.  Really scary stuff. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      NEWS MEDIA VANS AND REPORTERS 

      AS WE FOLLOW SANCHEZ into their midst with a few uniforms, 
      she worries-

                                    SANCHEZ 
                    The suspect could be watching us on 
                    TV, so it s very important we keep 
                    the cameras clear of the scene. 

                                  COP 
                    We want everybody two blocks North!  
                    Let's go... everybody!!

      A COMMAND AREA - NIGHT

      WITH Mason, Fitch, Longford, and Majan confer with a HOSTAGE 
      NEGOTIATOR, (50'S), he looks like a car salesman.  Department 
      brass and a Swat Commander also present.

                                  MAJAN
                    He hasn't made good on his note, 
                    yet.

                                  MASON
                    Maybe he's coming to his senses.                                                                                    51.



                                  FITCH
                    I don't know, I think time is our 
                    enemy here.  We have to take 
                    control; get him out of his head.

                                  NEGOTIATOR
                    Okay, so let's open up a line of 
                      communication. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      WE'RE FOLLOWING Fitch and the Negotiator through police lines-

                                  FITCH
                    Keep talking about his family.  
                    Connect him to his kids...

                                  NEGOTIATOR
                    I know how to do my job.

                                  FITCH
                    I'm just saying...

                                  NEGOTIATOR
                          (stressed)
                    I know what you're saying, Joe.  
                    Okay?  Do you know what I'm saying?

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MOMENTS LATER - THE HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR is behind a cruiser, 
      speaking through a megaphone-

                                  NEGOTIATOR (CONT'D)
                    James!  We're going to leave a 
                    phone by the door with some dinner.  
                    I know you and your family must be 
                    hungry.  I promise, no tricks here, 
                    James.  We just want to talk...

      PULL FOCUS ON - an unarmed SWAT OFFICER scrambling across the 
      parking lot to the door.  He places a box and a tray of 
      drinks on the mat, then quickly runs out of the line of fire.

      It s a tense few moments as everybody waits to see what will 
      happen.  Then   the door opens and a SCARED LITTLE BOY 
      appears.  We hear a man's unintelligible SHOUTING from inside-

      Unnerved, the little boy picks up the food.  Then drops the 
      drink tray.  Milk shakes SPLAT over the doormat.  He seems to 
      stare at it for a moment   it s heartbreaking.

      INTERCUT   OUR VARIOUS DETECTIVES, looking on helpless.                                                                                    52.

                    Jesus... Poor little thing.

      The boy goes back inside with the box, closing the door. 

      EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - COMMAND AREA - LATER THAT NIGHT

      Our detectives listen on headphones as the Negotiator talks 
      to a distressed James Roland.  His words subtitled--

                                  JAMES ROLAND (V.O.)
                    Leave us alone...

                                  NEGOTIATOR
                    James, I can't do that until those 
                    beautiful kids of yours are safe. 

      We can hear a woman YELLING in the B.G. (Unintelligible) 

                                  FITCH
                    That's his mother.

                                  MASON
                    She isn't helping any.

                                  JAMES ROLAND (V.O.)
                    Just go away.  They're gonna be 
                    with me forever.  It's over.  

      All the detectives trade looks - 'The fuck does that mean?'

                                  NEGOTIATOR
                    What are you saying, James?  It's 
                    not over.  Come on, don't talk like 
                    that in front of your kids.  I know 
                    you love them.

                                  JAMES ROLAND
                    I don't want to talk to you 
                    anymore.

                                  NEGOTIATOR
                    I just want to help you...

                                  JAMES ROLAND
                    You're not helping me! 

                                  NEGOTIATOR
                    James... Let's calm down and talk 
                    about this, okay?  Nothing needs to 
                    be decided right now...

      But then   a SHUFFLE on Roland s end of the line and                                                                                      53.



      SMASH!  The phone comes through the window, hitting the 
      pavement, smashing into pieces.  And everybody is stunned.  
      As they take off their headphones, demoralized--

                                  FITCH
                    I'm going in there to talk to him.

      A beat, then-

                                    HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR
                    Joe..?  Have we forgotten what 
                    happened the last time you knocked 
                    on that door?

                                    SANCHEZ
                    It's a bad idea.

                                  FITCH 
                    It's the only viable idea.

                                  MASON 
                    No way.  This man has already 
                    killed four people... 

                                  FITCH 
                    There are two kids in there.  KIDS!  
                    I looked 'em in the eye!  I made a 
                    promise.  They've already lost 
                    their mother.   What are we going 
                    to do, wait here til he loses it?

                                  LONGFORD
                    Fitch is right.  This guy looks out 
                    that window at us, how do you think 
                    he sees this ending?  I think Fitch 
                    can get through to him.

                                  MAJAN
                    I agree.  Fitch could sell a black 
                    lady a sun lamp.  He brings half 
                    the magic he uses in an 
                      interrogation, we got a real shot.

      Fitch trades eyes with Longford and Majan, total respect 
      between them.  A POLICE CAPTAIN looks at Mason-

                                  POLICE CAPTAIN
                    Your call.

      OFF MASON, contemplating this difficult decision, we- 

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    54.



      EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER THAT NIGHT

      CAMERA FOLLOWS FITCH as he walks out from behind the wall of 
      cruisers into the open.  He raises a megaphone- 

                                  FITCH
                    James..!  James... Ja...

      But the sound is muted.  Fitch jiggles the switch then turns, 
      revealing his angry face--

      A SWAT GUY trots out, handing him a new megaphone.  It FEEDS 
      BACK.  Fitch adjusts the volume, then announces--

                                  FITCH (CONT'D)
                    James!  My name is Detective Joseph 
                    Fitch.  I'm coming to the door.  
                    I'm unarmed.  I'm just... gonna 
                    walk to the door real slow.

      Fitch sets down the megaphone.  He walks steadily toward the 
      motel room, hands raised some.  CAMERA STOPS, showing us 
      there are some places it won t go.  And as he walks away from 
      the lens, we get a sense of just how vulnerable he is.

      Fitch gets to the door.  His mic makes him sound present-

                                  FITCH (CONT'D)
                    I m here, James.  I m at the door 
                    and I m gonna come inside now.  And 
                    it's okay, cause I know you wanna 
                    talk to somebody.  All we're gonna 
                    do is talk a little.

      INTERCUT - Our detectives, looking on.  It's tense as hell-

                                    SANCHEZ 
                          (to herself)
                    Come on... this is insane.

      And Fitch enters.  As soon as the door closes behind him, 
      SWAT moves in, sidling up to the door - on the roof - like 
      dark shadows, ready to barge in at the first signal.

      CAMERA ZOOMS THROUGH A SPACE IN THE CURTAIN - picking up 
      people moving, but we can't tell who is who, so it only adds 
      to the claustrophobia and tension.  

      *NOTE   Fitch is mic d, so WE hear everything.  And what we 
      hear is chaotic - so everyone but Fitch is subtitled. 

                                  JAMES ROLAND (V.O.)
                    What do you want?!                                                                                    55.



                                  FITCH (V.O.)
                    To talk, James..!

                                  JAMES ROLAND (V.O.)
                    Why does everyone wanna talk, 
                    there's nothing to talk about!  
                    It's too late!

      The kids are SCREAMING-

                                  KIDS (V.O.)
                    Daddy!  DADDY!  

                                  JUNE ROLAND (V.O.)
                    For god's sake, James... don t you 
                    know what you re doing to these 
                      children?!

                                  FITCH (V.O.)
                    Let's put the gun down, James.  
                    James..?! 

      We get the sense that all hell is going to break loose.

      ON MASON - looking over at the SWAT COMMANDER--

                                  SWAT COMMANDER
                    Just say when...

                                  FITCH (V.O.)
                    It's not too late, James.  I know 
                    it feels that way...

                                  JAMES ROLAND (V.O.)
                    You don't know...

                                  FITCH (V.O.)
                    I do...

                                  JAMES ROLAND (V.O.)
                    DON'T LIE TO ME!

                                  JUNE ROLAND (V.O.)
                    Why are you doing this?!  Look at 
                    you!  Look at yourself! 

                                  FITCH (V.O.)
                          (yelling)
                    JUNE, GIVE HIM A BREAK!!

      Suddenly, it goes quiet.  A moment, then--                                                                                    56.



                                  FITCH (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    I do know, James.  I know.  I know 
                    what it's like.  You loved somebody  
                    so much you don't know why they 
                    caused you so much pain.  And that 
                    pain just builds inside until you 
                    snap.  It's like you're a passenger 
                    in a car that's speeding out of 
                    control.  But then you wake up and 
                    it's you behind the wheel.  You did 
                    these things.  And you think, no 
                    matter what happens now... it can 
                    never be undone.  I've hurt people, 
                    James.  My wife, my kids...

      ON OUR DETECTIVES - listening via headphones.  Trading eyes.

                                  FITCH (V.O.)(CONT'D)
                    Most days I can't even get up, 
                    thinking about the things I've 
                    done.  Some days I think it would 
                    be easier just to... end it.  But I 
                    got these pictures on my wall.  
                    Think of the pictures, James.  I 
                    brought you one.  Look at these 
                    kids.  LOOK AT THEM!  They're the 
                    same kids in this picture.  And 
                    that's you, their father.  All you 
                    wanted was to be there for them.  
                    And now you're all they have.  We 
                    can't change the past, James.  But 
                    we can choose what happens next. 

      A long silent beat, then, we hear a man crying--

                                  JAMES ROLAND (V.O.)
                    Don't come any closer...

                                  FITCH (V.O.)
                    Give me the gun, James...

                                  JAMES ROLAND (V.O.)
                    Stop...

                                  FITCH (V.O.)
                    I'm not going to stop...

                                  JAMES ROLAND (V.O.)
                    God forgive me...

      And then   silence.  A LONG BEAT.  And the apartment door 
      opens.  Swat officers train weapons on the dark doorway as-                                                                                    57.



      JAMES ROLAND appears arms raised.  Fitch behind him, nudging 
      him out.  Roland gets about two steps -- SWAT tackles him to 
      the ground.  The kids come running out- 

      Cops swoop in and shuffle them and June Roland away.  James 
      Roland cries as he struggles to pull something from his 
      pocket.  He drops it, and as the cops carry him away-- 

      Fitch looks down seeing it s an old photo of JAMES, SHANNON, 
      AND THE TWO KIDS.  And we realize it's the photo Majan found 
      in Roland James' white pick-up truck.  We know this because 
      Fitch turns it over, seeing the handwritten words:

      "TOGETHER FOREVER."

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. HENRY FORD HOSPITAL - LATER THAT NIGHT

      As we establish the huge hospital complex, we hear-

                                    SANCHEZ (V.O.)
                    Looks like Alvin Green is gonna 
                    make it.  Came out of surgery and 
                    asked to see the kids.  

      INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      June Roland sits on a couch, watching the children play.  

      ON SANCHEZ - solemn, in the doorway, holding two Teddy Bears.  
      She looks at the kids, but speaks to camera.

                                    SANCHEZ 
                    You go out there every day; putting 
                    in these hours, trying to make a 
                      difference.  Sometimes you wonder 
                    if you're even making a dent.  But 
                    moments like this; it's like proof.
                          (she smiles)
                    You know it's worth it.

      She puts on a smile and hands the kids the Teddy Bears.

                                    SANCHEZ (CONT'D)
                    Hey guys, look what I found...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. STATION - SQUAD ROOM   LATER THAT NIGHT

      Majan stirs his chai tea, watching Longford on the phone.  
      From the look on his face, the call is not going well.                                                                                    58.



                                  LONGFORD
                    Hanno preso l'offerta?  Capisco.  
                    Si.  Grazie.

      He hangs up, looking sullen, like a ghost.

                                  MAJAN
                    What's up, partner... you didn't 
                    get the house?

                                  LONGFORD
                    No... I did.

      And it's a bitter-sweet moment for Longford, who is utterly 
      conflicted as he looks around the squad room at all his 
      comrades.  This has been his life.  Majan, sensing his angst, 
      puts a reassuring hand on Longford's shoulder, and we-- 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      FROM ACROSS THE SQUAD ROOM - We're looking at WASHINGTON - 
      gazing up at the BIG BOARD, contemplating it all.  Fitch 
      walks up beside him and we GO CLOSER-

                                  WASHINGTON
                    Hell of a first day, huh?

                                  FITCH 
                    Every day feels like the first.  
                    One of the perks of working 
                      homicide... it never gets old.

                                  WASHINGTON
                    All that stuff you said in that 
                    motel room; you know, about hurting 
                    people you love and feeling like 
                    you want to end it... is that true?

                                  FITCH
                          (thinks, then)
                    It was true when I said it.

      Washington looks at him, not sure what to believe.  But he 
      knows he shouldn't push.

                                  WASHINGTON 
                    Well, I'm beat, man.  Thought this 
                    day would never end.

                                  FITCH 
                    What makes you think you re done? 

      Washington shoots him a look - 'Huh?'                                                                                    59.



                                  FITCH (CONT'D)
                    Rookie always does the paperwork.   
                    Have it at the D.A. s office in two 
                    hours.   

      And just as Washington looks like he may vomit again, Fitch 
      smiles for the first time, and we realize he s joking.  

      Fitch takes an eraser-bar from the tray on the grease board. 
      He hands it to Washington, who is stunned by this offer-

                                  FITCH (CONT'D)
                    You earned it.

      Washington nods, clearly honored.  His face carries the 
      gravity of what this means.  And then, in one clean swoop, 
      Washington clears the case from its column on the BIG BOARD.  

                                                                            CUT TO:

      ON MASON - LOOKING AT A MONITOR - where James Roland sits in 
      a holding room.  Cuffed.  Slouched over, sulking.

                                  MASON
                    Well, we did our part.  D.A. Wants 
                    an immediate arraignment, so we'll 
                    transfer him to Corrections.  
                          (sighs)
                    Another night in D-town.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      LATER THAT NIGHT - A HOLDING ROOM DOOR OPENS

      Fitch and Washington emerge with James Roland.  He s in 
      cuffs.  We FOLLOW the two detectives as they escort him down 
      the hall toward the elevator where two uniforms wait.

      Roland is catatonic as they turn him around to transfer 
      cuffs.  And in the midst of the transfer, something happens.  
      And what happens, happens fast-

      ROLAND BREAKS FREE.  A jarring scuffle.  It s hard to make 
      out what s going on.  CAMERA is now running down the hallway 
      toward the action as Roland wrestles a sidearm from one of 
      the uniform cops - and we hear a CRACK!

      WASHINGTON recoils, SHOT!  As he falls to the floor in a blur-

      CAMERA DROPS for cover, still capturing the chaos as- 

      Fitch and those uniform cops draw   CRACK-CRACK! CRACK!  They 
      fire, hitting--                                                                                    60.



      JAMES ROLAND, who goes down hard.  The two other cops pile on 
      top of him, wrestling his arms into a submission hold.

      WASHINGTON is not moving.  And now we re hearing-

                                  MAN'S VOICE 1 (O.S.)
                    OFFICER DOWN!

      ON A DETECTIVE - heated, rambling into his radio-

                                  DETECTIVE
                    502, homicide unit... we need 
                    immediate assistance..!

      ON A SECRETARY - knelt behind her desk, watching in horror - 
      hands cupped over her mouth.

      ON MASON, charging out of her office, taking in the madness, 
      her gaze falling-

      ON FITCH - kneeling on the floor beside Washington as cops 
      start flooding in.  And amid this total FUCKING CHAOS   
      through all the legs rushing to and fro- 

      Fitch eerily turns and looks into the camera   and it s like 
      he s the only one in the room.  And by the look on his face, 
      we can see this camera is suddenly an intruder.  

      A swell of intensity grows in his eyes until he reaches out 
      and swipes at the camera-

      WE GO TO BLACK  

      And over all the SOUNDS OF CHAOS, radios, voices, etc - we 
      hear the ring-tone chime    ROCKABYE BABY.  

      Washington finally gets that call...

                                      END OF ACT FIVE


                                        THE END
