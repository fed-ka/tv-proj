
    Lois hums a little tune to herself. Suddenly, her car dies.
    It coasts to a stop.  Lois tries the ignition.  Click click.
    Nothing.

                                    LOIS
                         (puzzled)
                   Hey?

    All of a sudden, a blinding WHITE LIGHT descends from above.
    It engulfs Lois and her car, completely whiting out the
    screen.  Then the light abruptly vanishes... and Lois is
    gone.

                                                       FADE OUT.

                              _END OF TEASE_

                            _ACT ONE_

    FADE IN:


    Lois and Star are having tea.  They sit facing each other,
    practically knee to knee.

                                    LOIS
                   ... then there was this blinding 
                   white light and, I don't know, sort 
                   of this... floaty feeling.  Then, I 
                   have a vague, hazy memory of... 
                   creatures...
                         (with more confidence)
                   ... and then, I'm back in my car,
                   but it's six A.M. and three hours
                   have gone by.

                                    STAR
                   It must've been terrifying.

                                    LOIS
                   That doesn't begin to describe it.

                                    STAR
                   You don't have to talk about it if
                   you don't want to.

                   No, actually, it feels good to tell 
                   some one.  It's just too weird not 
                   to.

                                    STAR
                   More tea?

    Star gets up.

                                    LOIS
                   Thanks.  You know, I have to admit, 
                   when I met you downstairs, I 
                   thought you were a little flaky.
                   But you are really... I'm touched 
                   by how understanding and... down to 
                   earth you are.

                         (brings more tea)
                   Who knows.  Maybe we were friends
                   in an earlier life.

                                    LOIS
                         (uh-oh)
                   Maybe.

                                    STAR
                   Do you remember anything else about
                   the aliens?

                                    LOIS
                   Not really.  Just that they had big 
                   heads, large, dark, slanting eyes, 
                   and... hands... like ours, you 
                   know.

                                    STAR
                   Hmph.  I thought you were going to 
                   describe these guys I know from the 
                   Pleiades, but these sound 
                   different.

                                    LOIS
                   The Pleiades?
                                    STAR
                   Or Cassiopeians.
                         (gossipy)
                   I mean, those guys, faster than 
                   light travel, cities that float, 
                   but _no_ indoor plumbing.  You 
                   gotta love it.

                   You've been to where they live?

                                    STAR
                   Not physically.  But astrally,
                   dozens of times.

    This is too much for Lois.  She makes a big show of looking 
    at her watch as she stands up.

                                    LOIS
                   Gee, look at the time.  I hate to 
                   say this, but I've got to get ready 
                   for work.

                                    STAR
                   No problem.  I've still got some
                   moving to do.

    Lois escorts Star to her front door and opens it.  Halfway 
    out, star pauses and turns back to Lois.

                                    STAR (CONT'D)
                   Gemini, right?

                                    LOIS
                   Libra.

                                    STAR
                   I knew it!

    She smiles and is gone.



    The newsroom is in full bustle.  Lois enters and heads 
    straight for her desk.  Clark meets her there.

                                    CLARK
                   So, I see you got home safe last
                   night.

                                    LOIS
                   Um, yeah.

                                    CLARK
                   Want some Danish?

                   Look, I'm sorry. it's just that, I 
                   worry about you.  Even more than I 
                   used to.

    Lois makes up her mind and decides to tell him.

                                    LOIS
                   Clark, last night I was--

                                    PERRY (O.S.)
                   Lois!

    PERRY sails in, trailed by JIMMY, carrying papers.

                                    PERRY
                   Clark told me how you two cracked 
                   the airport luggage theft story.  
                   Ride 'em, cowgirl!  I can't wait to 
                   see that copy on my desk!  Say, 
                   half an hour?

    He's gone before they can even reply.

                                    JIMMY
                   He's been on a tear all morning.
                   Just started boxing lessons.  Very 
                   pumped.
                         (grins; confidential)
                   I think he caught Alice 
                   checking out a waiter the other 
                   night.

    With a wink he's gone, zipping after Perry.  Lois relaxes 
    and turns back to her desk, only to be surprised by the 
    presence of Star.  How'd she get here; it's almost spooky.
    Star drops a stack of books on Lois's desk.

                                    LOIS
                   Star?!

                                    STAR
                   I had a sudden flash, right after 
                   you left to go to work.  I knew 
                   you'd left for work 'cause I can 
                   see who comes and goes from one of 
                   the windows in my living room.  
                   Anyway, maybe you'd like to read 
                   these books.  They're _all_ about 
                   alien abductions.

    Then she charges towards the exit.  Everyone still stares at 
    Lois; she glares right back.

                   If you want some entertainment, go

    Perry and Jimmy have arrived.  Jimmy flips open his wallet
    like a Star Trek communicator.

                                    JIMMY
                   Stand by to beam me up.

                   Go ahead, laugh!  I know what 
                   happened!  I'm not an idiot.  Don't

                   thousand times what really 
                   happened?  But I'm telling you, it 
                   really did!

    Perry's demeanor instantly changes.  He can hear the anguish 
    in Lois's voice; the time for kidding has passed.

                                    PERRY
                   Lois, I apologize.  Something 
                   obviously has upset you.  Now, I 
                   don't know what it was, but I do 
                   know you, and you wouldn't lie... 
                   at least to me... most of the 
                   time... so forget about the airport 
                   story for now; you can turn it in 
                   later.  Whatever happened, I want 
                   you and Clark to get to the bottom 
                   of it, okay?  Spend whatever you 
                   need.

                   Hey, I gotta make Accounting sweat

    BOB FENCES, the 25-year-old billionaire boy genius founder 
    of Nanosoft, sits behind his desk.

    He's got narrow shoulders and big glasses.  He makes noises 
    and plays with plastic action figures and spaceships.

                                    FENCES
                   Look out!  Bzzzzt!  Ahhh, the death 
                   ray!  Skkkkk.  Don't worry, I'll 
                   save you, Princess Cleavage.  Gzzz!

    DR. MARTIN SOLSVIG, 57, enters and stops at the desk.  A bit 
    of the absent minded genius, he has two pairs of glasses 
    pushed up on his head.

                                    FENCES (CONT'D)
                   So, Martin, what can I do for you
                   today?
                         (to the toys, falsetto) 
                   Bzzzzt!  Oh, golly, my dress is on 
                   fire, I'll have to take it off!

                                    SOLSVIG
                   I don't know.  You called me...
                   didn't you?

                                    FENCES
                   No. _You_ called me.
                         (to toys)
                   Take _that_, Count Gravity!  Arggh!

                                    SOLSVIG
                   Oh, right!
                         (beat)
                   Why did I call you?

                                    FENCES
                   Could it be the Super Microwave 
                   Transmitter?  The project you've 
                   been working on the last six 
                   months?  You know, if we microwave, 
                   they will come?

                                    SOLSVIG
                         (snaps his fingers)
                   Right!  Right!  Our attempt to 
                   contact alien civilizations!  
                   Sorry, I was trying to remember 
                   where I left my glasses.

    Fences, with restraint, taps the top of his head.  Solsvig 
    does the same to his own and finds his glasses.  As Solsvig 
    talks, Fences continues to play, though at a lower volume.

                   Much better!  Anyway, I got your 
                   new program and we've loaded it 
                   into the computer, but as I said in 
                   my memo, there are still two 
                   problems we haven't been able to 
                   lick if we want to reach your 
                   goals...

                                    SOLSVIG
                         (oblivious)
                   First, our computer chips aren't as 
                   good as the ones I used to have at 
                   NASA.  Those were from Zenith Chip, 
                   far above anything commercially 
                   available, but we just haven't been 
                   able to match them.

    Fences holds up an action figure and pretends it's speaking 
    in a deep commanding voice.

                                    FENCES
                   I an Bob, Master of the Universe, 
                   my word is action.  Worlds tremble 
                   at my feet.  A crack team is 
                   already working on your chip 
                   problem.

                                    SOLSVIG
                   Really?  Excellent.  Second, we
                   need a stronger pulse amplifier.
                         (reluctantly)
                   Unfortunately, one doesn't exist.

                                    FENCES
                         (thru the action figure)
                   That's all right.  I am Bob, owner 
                   of a seventy billion dollar 
                   software company.  I can do what I 
                   want.  You shall have your chips 
                   and amplifier.  Do not worry, Bob 
                   will take care of it.

    Solsvig leaves and an attractive woman enters.  This is 
    SIMONE, Bob's personal secretary.  She has a lot of
    cleavage.  Fences putt down the figures and speaks normally.

                                    SIMONE
                   Has he figured it out, yet?

                                    FENCES
                   Not a clue.  He still thinks this
                   is a hobby of mine.
                         (mocking)
                   Albeit a _really_ expensive one.

    He picks up an Action figure and stares at it.


                                    FENCES (CONT'D)
                         (gloating)
                   For the last few years Nanosoft's 
                   profits have been limited by trade 
                   barriers overseas, but since 
                   negotiations have failed, they 
                   leave us no choice but to make our 
                   money another way.

    He checks his watch.  It's two minutes to Eleven.

                                    FENCES (CONT'D)
                   In two minutes, the empire begins 
                   to strike back.

    He crashes one action figure into another.

    It's a high tech computer chip manufacturing facility, like 
    Intel. (That is, as high tech as our budget will allow.) 
    Everything is super sterile.  The MANAGER checks his watch 
    as it just hits 11AM.  Suddenly, a _trance-like_ expression 
    comes over his face and he moves to open the high security 
    door that permits access to the room.



    Lois, Clark and Jimmy, plus a PILOT, fly over the 
    countryside (STOCK SHOTS) near the airport we saw in the 
    Teaser.  Jimmy shoots random photos as Clark stares at Lois, 
    who's focused on studying the ground.  Suddenly, Lois 
    becomes aware of Clark's stare.

                                    LOIS
                   What?

                   Don't give me that look.  I know 
                   what you're thinking.  You're 
                   thinking I should've waited for you 
                   last night.

                         (lying)
                   No, I'm not.

                                    LOIS
                   Clark, you can't control 
                   everything.  We're both rational, 
                   thinking adults.  Sometimes I'm 
                   going to do things we disagree on.

                                    CLARK
                   That's what worries me.

    Jimmy suddenly turns to Lois.

                                    JIMMY
                   So what are we looking for?

    Lois reluctantly twists to face him.

                                    LOIS
                   I don't know.  Landing sites.
                   Scorch marks.  A snapshot of 
                   themselves at Disney World.
                   Anything that might show that a UFO 
                   has been here.

    Jimmy glances at Clark, who just shrugs.

                                    LOIS (CONT'D)
                   Go left.  There... that's about 
                   where it happened.

    She suddenly glances at her watch.  It reads 11 AM.  A 
    _trance-like_ expression comes over her face, but no one 
    notices.



    The Manager opens the security door.  MASKED ROBBERS, 
    brandishing machine guns, rob the place., dumping trays of 
    finished chips into small athletic bags.  A WORKER presses a 
    hidden alarm button.

    Solsvig sits by a computer that's "on", speaking to Lois and 
    Clark, who sit across from him and lean towards him.  Behind 
    him is the super Microwave Transmitter.  His lab is filled 
    with photos of UFO'S, crop circles, drawings of aliens, etc.

                                    SOLSVIG
                         (chuckles)
                   Then it'd be out.  Excuse me if I 
                   seem so excited, but I've worked my 
                   whole life towards contacting alien 
                   civilizations.  Soon I'll complete 
                   my Super Microwave Transmitter, but 
                   until then, talking to people 
                   who've had your 'experience' is the 
                   closest I'll ever get.

                                    CLARK
                   There's always Superman.

                                    SOLSVIG
                   Yes!  A one of a kind.  So unlike 
                   all the other aliens ever reported.  
                   I'd love to meet him.

    Lois and Clark exchange glances.

                                    LOIS
                   Dr. Solsvig, one last thing.  Some 
                   'unusual' things have been 
                   happening to me since... you know.

                                    SOLSVIG
                         (excited)
                   Really?  Like what?

                                    LOIS
                   This morning, I, uh, went into a
                   trance for a brief period.

                         (disappointed)
                   Oh.  Perfectly natural.  Some 
                   people report enhanced paranormal 
                   abilities, others bizarre behavior.

                                    CLARK
                   Have you ever heard of a person 
                   putting themselves into jeopardy 
                   after an abduction?

                                    SOLSVIG
                   No. That would be unusual.

    Lois lets that sink in, then rises to her feet.

                                    LOIS
                   Thanks for your time.

                                    SOLSVIG
                   My time is space-time.
                         (off their blank looks)
                   Sorry.  Physicist's joke.

                                    LOIS
                   Oh.

    She forces a smile, but as they turn to leave, Bob Fences 
    enters.  He's surprised to see them, but quickly covers.

                                    FENCES
                   Lois Lane and Clark Kent, am I 
                   right?  The two most famous 
                   reporters in America.

    Lois sticks out her hand and they shake.

                                    LOIS
                   I know we've never met, but I've
                   the strangest feeling that we have.

                                    FENCES
                   I'm afraid I've been in the news a
                   lot lately.

                                    CLARK
                   Yes, I read your interview on trade
                   barriers.  You were rather adamant.

                         (serious)
                   Unfair trade barriers are the bane 
                   of U.S. businesses overseas, and 
                   if negotiations fail, I believe we 
                   should go to war.

                   Metaphorically speaking.

                   Let's hope it never comes to that.

    Clark gives a parting nod, and they leave.  Fences watches 
    them depart with a thoughtful look.



    The lab is dark except for Solsvig typing away on his
    computer.  He runs his finger along lines of data in a
    program for the Super Microwave Transmitter.  He double
    checks something, frowns, and reaches for the phone.  He
    dials and waits a beat.

                                    SOLSVIG
                         (worried)
                   Mr. Fences, I've just discovered
                   something in that new program you
                   gave me that I'd like to talk to
                   you about.

    Lois reads Solsvig's book: "The Alien Touch" as she removes
    a pint of ice cream from the freezer; it's chocolate brownie
    and vanilla.  Unfortunately, it's practically empty.
    Disappointed, she scrapes a half-spoonful out of it and
    throws the container away.  She turns back to the book and
    nurses her meager bite.

                                    LOIS
                         (to herself)
                   No way!

    Still reading, she walks towards her fish tank and begins to
    read aloud.  Occasionally, she looks at her fish to see if
    they're listening.

                   What if she found out about Clark?!

    Lois hurriedly reads more, but she does it silently until...

                                    LOIS (CONT'D)
                   'A few individuals stated that the

                   Don't you turn away from me like
                   that!

    Lois sighs and flops in a chair, dispirited.  A moment of 
    self-pity lingers, then there's a knock at the door.

                                    STAR (V.0.)
                   Lois?  It's me, Star.  I brought 
                   you some ice cream.  It's chocolate 
                   brownie and vanilla.

    Lois glances at her own spoon of chocolate brownie and 
    vanilla; a look of alarm consumes her face.  She bolts for 
    the kitchen.

                                    LOIS
                   I'll be right there.

    She frantically rummages in a drawer for aluminum foil, 
    finds some, tears off a sheet, and quickly fashions a skull 
    cap onto her head.  She races to the door, stops, and opens 
    it with an air of studied nonchalance.  Star enters.

                                    STAR
                   You know, I just had the funniest 
                   feeling.  A little voice said, Lois 
                   wants some ice cream.  _Fish_ ice 
                   cream.  I didn't have any of that, 
                   so I brought this instead.

    The ice cream is mostly gone.

                                    STAR
                   And _that's_ the only thing that's
                   keeping you two apart?

    Lois unconsciously readjusts her aluminum foil beenie.

                                    LOIS 
                   That, and one or two other things...

                   life for work, why not risk your 
                   life for love?

    Lois thinks about this for a moment; then comes to a 
    decision.  She suddenly beams.

    Lois is lying on an examining table, looks left and right.
    Other people lie on tables, too.  To her left WE recognize 
    the Manager from Zenith Chip.  To Lois's right, a RED-HEADED 
    WOMAN in a business suit.

    We HEAR strange, garbled noises and Lois's POV turns to look 
    up and see weird, HIDEOUS BEINGS in all white garb, large 
    heads with freakish, oversized dark eyes and some mechanical 
    device over where their mouths should be.  They're speaking 
    as they loom down, but because it's a memory and hazy, we 
    can't distinguish what they're saying.  Sometimes it has the 
    tone of questions, sometimes the tone of commands.
    Occasionally, they seem to talk to another alien out of 
    sight and behind Lois's head.

    We can't see this alien because the examining table has a 
    tall headboard on it.  Suddenly, a mechanical arm swings 
    into Lois's POV with a hugely sinister hypodermic at its 
    end.  It grows larger and LARGER as it looms down and we 
    hear Lois screaming and SCREAMING and SCREAMING.

                                                       FADE OUT.

    FADE IN:



    Lois, still screaming Wakes UP with a jolt, a look of
    terror in her eyes.



    MARTHA and JONATHAN are peacefully asleep.  The phone RINGS
    and Jonathan groggily opens one eye and gropes the
    sidetable.

                                    JONATHAN
                   I hate alarm clocks.

    Martha reaches out and turns on her light.

                                    MARTHA
                   It's the phone, Jonathan.

    She picks up her phone as she eyes the clock on her side.
    It's 2:13.AM, Smallville time.

                                    MARTHA (CONT'D)
                   Hello?



    Clark talks on his portable phone; it's wedged between his
    shoulder and ear.  He's washing mud off his cape and uniform
    in a square plastic bowl in his sink.  It's a sudsy mess.

    (NOTE: INTERCUT WITH MARTHA AND JONATHAN AS NEEDED.)

                                    CLARK
                   Hi, Mom.

                                    MARTHA
                   Clark, is everything okay?

    Jonathan picks up his extension.

                                    CLARK
                   I'm fine.  Had to stop a mudslide
                   in Chile.  You know.

                                    JONATHAN
                   How's Lois?

                                    CLARK
                   That's what I wanted to call you
                   about.

                                    MARTHA
                   Is this one of those father-son
                   talks you want me to butt out of?

                                    CLARK
                   It's not that kind of conversation, 
                   Mom.  It's just that... sometimes I 
                   think Lois and I shouldn't be 
                   together.

                                    MARTHA

                   Oh, Clark, did you have a fight?

                                    CLARK
                   No. I'm just worried I'm a jinx.

                                    JONATHAN
                   A jinx?

                                    CLARK
                   Yeah.  Let's face it, ever since 
                   she's known me, Lois's been 
                   kidnapped, frozen, pushed off 
                   buildings, almost stabbed, 
                   poisoned, buried alive and who 
                   knows what else, and it's all 
                   because of me.

                                    MARTHA
                   Did something happen today?

                                    CLARK
                   No!  No.  It's just something I've
                   been thinking about.

                                    JONATHAN
                   Clark, they weren't all your fault.

                                    CLARK
                   You know what I mean.

                                    MARTHA
                   Have you talked to her about this?

                                    CLARK
                   Sort of.  But we never get very.
                   far.  It's kind of uncomfortable.

                   Honey, you're going to have to talk 
                   about it some more; communication 
                   is key.

                                    JONATHAN
                   Something I learned a long time 
                   ago, son: no matter how much you 
                   love somebody, you can't protect 
                   them from all the evil in the world 
                   all the time.  Even if you _are_
                   Superman.

                                    CLARK
                         (unconvinced)
                   Yeah, I guess.

                                    MARTHA
                   And don't forget, Lois knows what 
                   being involved with you means.  
                   It's her choice, too.  She's not a 
                   six year old, you know.

                                    CLARK
                   That's what she said.

                                    JONATHAN
                   See?  She's smart, just like your
                   Mom.

    Clark gives a tiny grin.  His doorbell suddenly rings, 
    followed by hard knocking and...

                                    LOIS (V.O.)
                   Clark?!  Clark?!  Wake up, it's me!
                   Clark?!

                                    CLARK
                         (into phone)
                   Mom, Dad, I gotta go.  Love ya,
                   bye!

    Martha and Jonathan exchange a glance.  Clark runs to the 
    door and opens it.  Lois streaks in, hyper.  She's only 
    thrown on a few items over her pajamas.

                                    LOIS
                   Clark, I remember being kidnapped 
                   by the aliens!  I had a flashback!
                   I could see them!  They had big, 
                   bulging heads, and they'd snatched 
                   these other people and they had, 
                   had these thingamajiggies over 
                   their mouths so they sounded 
                   like...

                                    LOIS
                   ... then this big mechanical arm 
                   came over me with a needle pointed 
                   at my neck and I was screaming and 
                   screaming and screaming, and you 
                   weren't there...

                                    CLARK

                   Lois, are you sure you weren't just
                   dreaming?

                                    LOIS
                   Oh, God, I don't know what to
                   think.  It seemed so real.

                                    CLARK
                   I never should've let you go home
                   alone that night.

                                    LOIS
                   It's not your fault.

                                    CLARK
                   But I feel responsible.

                                    LOIS
                   But you shouldn't.

                                    CLARK
                   Sure I should.  I love you.  That's 
                   what makes it so difficult.  When 
                   I'm catching some bad guy, I'm 
                   thinking, is Lois okay?  Or is 
                   somebody slowly boiling her in oil?

                                    LOIS
                         (touched)
                   Really?

    Clark takes a breath.  He's unused to these strong, new 
    feelings he has and it's difficult for him to talk about 
    them.

                                    CLARK
                   Yes.  And what I can't stand is the 
                   idea that the closer we get, the 
                   more at risk you are.

                                    LOIS
                   That's not true!

                                    CLARK
                   Lois, for the sake of argument, 
                   let's just say you _were_ kidnapped 
                   by aliens.  In a way you were 
                   lucky, because what if it had been 
                   your average earthbound criminal 
                   and when you were drugged, you'd 
                   let slip that Clark Kent is 
                   Superman?  Everyone knows that you 
                   and I are an item, and to get to 
                   Superman, they would do _anything_
                   to you.

                                    LOIS
                   But that's a worse case scenario.

                                    CLARK
                   Who could've predicted you'd be
                   kidnapped by aliens?!

                                    LOIS
                   So what do you want me to do, hie
                   thee to a nunnery?

                                    CLARK
                         (re: their situation)
                   No! It's just, hard, that's all.  
                   Harder than I ever thought it would 
                   be.

    Moved by Clark's admission of vulnerability, Lois throws her 
    arms around him.

                                    LOIS
                   But we can make it work, I know we
                   can.

    Clark holds her tight.  He brushes her hair with his hand.

                                    LOIS (CONT'D)
                   In fact, I want you to know, I'm
                   ready to say --

    Clark notices something on Lois's neck.  It's a puncture 
    mark.

                                    CLARK
                   Lois, what's this?

                   It looks like a puncture mark.

    Lois looks at Clark.  Her eyes begin to widen in renewed
    horror.

                                                       CUT TO:



    The computer hums quietly in the FOREGROUND. All we see
    is _Solsvig's shadow_ looming on one wall as he angrily
    walks about.  ANOTHER SHADOW stands quietly listening; we
    can't see who it is.

                                    SOLSVIG (O.S.)
                   This is diabolical!  This is
                   monstrous!  This is not nice!
                   I won't stand for it!

    The other shadow shifts its weight; Solsvig instantly
    falters.

                                    SOLSVIG (CONT'D)
                   Okay, I'm willing to talk!  Let's
                   not be precipitate!
                         (nervous laugh)
                   Heh heh, a small ... joke there.

                                                       CUT TO



    Lois is elbow deep in research on abductions.  Books and
    magazines litter the table, all about UFO's and aliens.
    Clark stands by the small food and coffee table in the
    corner and microwaves some tomato vegetable soup.  It pings
    and he takes it  out. He moves back to Lois and hands it to
    her.  She eats as she reads.

                                    LOIS
                   Thanks.  Ooo, hot!  Mmm, listen,
                   there're all sorts of reports of
                   medical examinations by aliens on
                   abductees, and people having
                   flashbacks, but nothing on trances.

                                    CLARK
                   And you had two in one day.  The
                   first was --

                                    LOIS
                   -- at eleven o'clock exactly.  I
                   remember looking at my watch.

                                    CLARK
                         (nodding; singsong)
                   You jumped, I saved you.  I take 
                   off for the robbery, save you 
                   again; forget the robbery, stay 
                   with you.

                                    LOIS
                   Then at three o'clock exactly, I do
                   my trance thing again.

    They both look at each other.  Then...

                                    LOIS & CLARK
                   Jimmmmy!!!

    Just then Jimmy blows through the door with an armload of 
    books and magazines.  He dumps it on the table between them.

                                    Jimmy
                   Hey, Louise down in research can
                   only move so fast.

                                    LOIS
                   Forget the books!  Call the cops
                   and see --

                                    CLARK
                   -- if there was another robbery
                   yesterday --

                                    LOIS

    He vanishes out the door.

                                    CLARK
                   Okay, let's assume there _was_ 
                   another robbery.  Then maybe the 
                   timing of your trances _wasn't_ 
                   completely accidental.

                                    LOIS
                   Maybe they were meant to keep 
                   Superman from stopping those 
                   robberies!

                                    CLARK
                   But what would aliens want with our 
                   technology?  They're way ahead of 
                   us already.

                                    LOIS
                         (beat; deflates)
                   Yeah, that doesn't make sense.

    Jimmy rushes back in.  He carries some pages.

                                    JIMMY
                   Man, are you guys psychic or what?

                                    LOIS
                   Don't use that word.

                                    JIMMY
                   This just came in over the fax.  At 
                   exactly three o'clock yesterday, 
                   some guys broke into WaveTech 
                   Industries; they're a top 
                   contractor for the Department of 
                   Defense.  They stole the prototype 
                   of an advanced pulse amplifier.

                                    LOIS
                   Yes!

                                    JIMMY
                   They figure it was an inside job, 
                   just like the one at Zenith Chip.
                   In both cases, they've already 
                   arrested a suspect.  Here.  They 
                   even faxed over their mug shots.

    Jimmy lays them on the table.  Lois pales.  One is a picture 
    of the Manager; the other of the Red Headed Woman.

                                    LOIS
                   Clark, I know them. Both of them
                   were in my dream.

    On Clark's look of concern, we...

                                                       CUT TO:


35  A SPINNING, HYPNOTIC SPIRAL DISC                                 35   

    It fills the frame, whirling whirling whirling, drawing us
    in.

                                    STAR (V.0.)
                         (softly)
                   Now I'm going to ask you...



    Star takes away the disc from in front of Lois, who sits
    hypnotized on her couch, eyes open.  Clark sits next to her.

                                    STAR
                   ... a few simple questions, just to
                   put you at ease. First, what's
                   your name?

                                    LOIS
                   Lois Lane.

                                    STAR
                   And where do you live?

                                    LOIS
                   At 1058 Carter Avenue, Metropolis.
                   Apartment 407.

                                    STAR
                   And if you were an animal, what
                   type of animal would you be?
                   Excluding invertebrates, viruses
                   and certain classes of
                   photo-plankton.

                                    LOIS
                         (confused)
                   What?

    Clark gestures for Star to get on with it.

                   place.  Clark and I are with you.
                   Nothing is going to harm you.  If
                   at anytime you feel uncomfortable, 
                   you will emerge from this session 
                   by your own choice.  Nothing can

                                    STAR
                   I'd like you to think back to the 
                   dream you had last night.  What do 
                   you see?

    (NOTE: INTERCUT AS NEEDED WITH A REPLAY OF THE FLASHBACK, 
    THOUGH THIS TIME IT'S ALL IN CRYSTAL CLEAR FOCUS)

                                    LOIS
                   I'm in a white room.  There's a man
                   and woman on either side of me.
                   These... creatures are leaning over
                   me, talking to me.

    Clark, who's been scribbling a note, shows it to Star, who 
    nods.

                                    STAR
                   What are they saying?

                                    LOIS
                   I... don't know.  It seems like 
                   questions.  They keep talking to 
                   someone who stands behind my head.
                   He seems to be giving them orders.

                                    CLARK
                   What's he look like?

                                    LOIS
                   I can't see him.  It's blocked...
                   by a kind of... headboard.

                                    STAR
                   You never see him?

                                    LOIS
                   No.
                         (beat)
                   Yes.  There's a reflection.  A tiny
                   reflection.

    We CUT in closer and closer to the reflection until we 
    see... Bob Fences, dressed normally, speaking to the

    Lois instantly comes out of her hypnosis.  She's animated 
    and grabs Clark.

                                    LOIS (CONT'D)
                   He was right there!  Talking to

                                    LOIS
                   No, don't you get it?!  They 
                   weren't aliens, the whole thing was 
                   staged!  Then they drugged me and 
                   gave me, um...
                         (searches for the word)

                                    CLARK

                   friend of Superman's.

                                    CLARK
                   So, they kidnap you...

                                    STAR
                         (dead serious; to Lois)
                   It's for you.

    She answers.

                                    LOIS (CONT'D)
                   Hello?



    Perry's on the phone.  Jimmy hovers next to him, anxious.

                                    PERRY
                   Lois?  Good.  Look, I thought you'd 
                   want to know this as soon as it 
                   came in, I just got a call from 
                   the police.



    Lois is shocked.

                                    LOIS
                   Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Yes, thanks,
                   Perry.
                         (to Clark and Star)
                   Martin Solsvig's been killed.

    Clark and Star react.

                                                       FADE OUT.

                             _ACT FOUR_

    FADE IN:


    Fences is at his desk.  His computer is "on", but the screen 
    is blank.  He plays with two action figures.  He tosses one 
    high up in the air, out of frame.

                                    FENCES
                         (Action Figure #1 voice)
                   Oh, no, my jet pack failed!

    The figure smashes down onto the desk and bounces, 
    scattering others.  Fences makes smashing noises, then...

                                    FENCES (CONT'D)
                         (Action Figure #2 voice) 
                   Lucky you landed on your head. 
                         (Action Figure #1 voice) 
                   Too bad I didn't land on _you_!

    He crashes Figure #1 into Figure #2 and they get into a 
    strenuous fight, with appropriate sound effects.  Simone 
    enters.

                                    SIMONE
                   The transmitter's almost ready.

                                    FENCES
                   About time.
                         (back to fighting;
                          Figure #1)
                   Take that, you boogerhead!
                         (Figure #2)

                   And those two reporters are back, 
                   Lane and Kent.  They want to speak 
                   to you.

                                    FENCES
                         (Figure #1)
                   They're awfully nosy.
                         (Figure #2)
                   Let's kill 'em!
                         (Figure #1)
                   With what, you're breath?
                         (Figure #2)

                         (Figure #1)
                   Ha ha ha.  Krassshhh!

    He smashes #1 into #2; they fight some more; then Fences 
    stops, panting.

                                    FENCES (CONT'D)
                         (Figure #1)
                   Okay.  Okay.  Let's see what they
                   want first.  Then we'll decide.
                         (Figure #2)
                   Hope they're not whiners, like
                   solsvig:
                         (imitates Solsvig)
                   But Bob, you shouldn't've done this 
                   without my permission.  This... 
                   this... could _hurt_ people.
                         (normal Figure #2 voice)
                   Yeah, like no kidding, Sherlock.  
                   That's the _point_!

    Simone clears her throat.

                                    FENCES (CONT'D)
                   All right, all right.  Show them 
                   in.

    He puts the figures to one side and waves an admonishing 
    finger at them.

                                    FENCES (CONT'D)
                   Not a word.

    Lois and Clark enter.  Simone shuts the door behind them.

                                    FENCES (CONT'D)

                                    LOIS
                   Mr. Fences, I'll get straight to 
                   the point: you kidnapped me, then 
                   you drugged me, and then you 
                   brainwashed me.

                                    FENCES
                   Good to see you, too.  Anything
                   else?

                                    LOIS
                   You killed Martin Solsvig.

                                    FENCES
                   Nope to both of them.  Next.

                                    CLARK
                   Mr. Fences, Lois saw you in the
                   white room.

                                    FENCES
                   White room?  Was it padded?

                                    LOIS
                         (frustrated)
                   I know what I saw.

                                    FENCES
                   And where did you see this?

                                    LOIS
                         (reluctantly)
                   In my dream.

                                    FENCES
                   Have a nice day.  Don't let the
                   door hit you on the way out.

    He presses a button on his phone.  Lois gives Clark a look 
    that says, "Okay, watch me now."

                                    LOIS
                         (bluffing)
                   I have a witness who can connect
                   you to my kidnapping.

                                    FENCES
                   Ms. Lane, I didn't do anything.  
                   Your witness must've been dreaming, 
                   like yourself.  Now if you'll 
                   excuse me?.

    Simone opens the door and waits for Lois and Clark to leave.
    Reluctantly, they do.  She shuts the door after them and 
    turns a questioning face to Fences.

                   Lane and Kent are getting close.
                   Tighten security, but otherwise, we
                   stay on schedule.  When the time
                   comes, Lois will keep Superman
                   occupied.  And hold my calls, I've
                   gotta finish that letter.

    Simone nods. Fences hits some keys on his computer.



    Lois and Clark scan stacks of books and magazines.

                                    LOIS
                   Here's another one on his personal
                   fascination with aliens.

                                    CLARK
                   And another one about the
                   unfairness of trade barriers.

    They each toss their magazines on a stack and pick up two more.

                                    LOIS
                   Here's one on him personally
                   funding Solsvig's transmitter.

                                    CLARK
                   And yet _another one_ on him
                   railing against trade barriers.

    Again they toss the magazines onto the stack and pick up two 
    more.

                                    LOIS
                   Solsvig said the transmitter was 
                   nearly complete, so what does he 
                   need more chips and a pulse 
                   amplifier for?

                                    CLARK
                   Maybe he wants to make a really
                   long distance call.

                                    LOIS
                   So funny.

                   practically everybody.

                                    CLARK
                   I don't know, but we've got to stop 
                   him.  Even I can't outfly a 
                   microwave.

                                    LOIS
                         (dismayed)
                   But we don't have any proof.  Are 
                   you sure you didn't see _anything_ 
                   on his computer screen?

                                    CLARK
                   Nothing.  It was just a...
                   shrinking dot.

                                    LOIS
                         (gets an idea)
                   Maybe you just need some help
                   remembering.

    As it whirls and whirls.



    Star has just hypnotized Clark.  Lois watches attentively.  
    Star puts down the spiral.

    Lois jumps in as Star turns a puzzled face towards her.

                                    LOIS
                   Can you believe this guy?  He can 
                   joke even under hypnosis!  Let's 
                   just cut to the chase, okay?

    Lois hands her a list of questions.  Star raises an eyebrow, 
    but goes ahead.

                                    STAR
                   Now remember, Clark, you're in a 
                   warm, safe, fuzzy place; kind of 
                   like you're living inside a giant 
                   Teddy Bear ... that's missing one eye 
                   because your stupid sister used him 
                   for homeplate while you were trying 
                   to get your retainer unstuck from 
                   your bicycle spokes...

    Lois flicks Star on her arm and without missing a beat, Star 
    gets back to business.

                                    STAR
                   ... and any time you want to

                   right?

                                    CLARK
                   Sure.

                         (checks list)
                   Okay.  I want you to think back to 
                   your visit this morning to Bob 
                   Fences.
                         (Clark nods)
                   As you were leaving, you glanced at
                   his computer screen.  Correct?

                                    CLARK
                         (beat)
                   Yes.

                                    CLARK
                   He was turning it off as I looked.
                   Lois gestures for Star to keep going.

                                    STAR
                   Maybe just a glimpse, or a glimmer?

    Clark concentrates.

    The screen is filled by a document, but then vanishes.

                   A document.

    Lois perks up, points to another question on the list.

                                    STAR
                   Good.  Very good, Clark.  Now
                   relax.  Let your mind remember what
                   you saw.  Let it hold onto the
                   image of the document.  Hold until
                   you can see it... and read it.

    Clark frowns, but then relaxes.


49  FLASHBACK - DOCUMENT ON COMPUTER SCREEN                          49   

    Now we can read it.  It's a letter, addressed to the Prime
    Minister of Pacifonesia.

                   And what does it say?

    We see Clark's eyes move under his eyelids, as if he's
    reading something.

                                    CLARK
                   It demands one billion dollars to
                   be delivered to an offshore bank in
                   the Cayman Islands or one of their
                   cities will be destroyed.  If he
                   contacts Interpol or anyone else,
                   five cities will be destroyed.

    Lois urgently points at another question.

                                    STAR
                   When will all this happen?

    Lois glances at her watch.  It's five minutes to 5.

                                    LOIS
                         (sotto, to Star)

                                    CLARK
                   Yes.  His secretary has the most

                   ... next to Lois's.

    Star looks at Lois and smiles.



    Fences sits at the computer.  On the screen is a map 
    representing several islands.  A pair of glowing red 
    crosshairs blink over a port city.  "Pacifonesia" is written 
    across the top of the screen.  A countdown clock reads 
    1100:05 seconds and HOLDING" in the upper right corner.
    Fences slams down the phone and looks over at Simone, who's 
    anxious.

                                    FENCES
                   Those pikers still haven't paid up.
                   So, time to french fry!

    He types on the computer keyboard.

                                    SIMONE
                   What about Superman?

                                    FENCES
                   Will you _stop_ with the Superman
                   stuff?
                         (checks his watch)
                   By now, Lois is probably hurling
                   herself in front of a subway.

    BOOM!  The doors slam open and Superman strides in, with 
    Lois right behind him.

                                    FENCES (CONT'D)
                   Then again, maybe not.

    Superman looks at the super Microwave Transmitter and 
    focuses his heat vision on the transmitting rod at the top.  
    With a shower of sparks, the rod topples over and hangs
    downwards.

                                    FENCES (CONT'D)
                   You idiot, it's still going to get 
                   the signal to fire, but now it's 
    going to explode!

    EVERYTHING SUDDENLY GOES TO SUPER SLOW MOTION:

    A SERIES OF SHOTS:

    1. Superman looks from the transmitter to Fences, alarm 
    spreading across his face.

    2. Fences turns to run.

    3. Lois's mouth goes wide in surprise.

    4. Simone starts to duck.

    5. The countdown on the computer clicks from 1 second to 0
    second.

    6. Superman blurs out of frame.

    7. A blue blur sweeps Lois away.

    8. A rainbow of exploding light blots out the room.

    BACK TO NORMAL SPEED A shower of debris bounces off Superman 
    as he crouches near one wall, his cape spread by his arms 
    over the huddled forms of Fences, Simone and Lois.

    After the debris stops falling, he stands up, debris falling 
    from his shoulders like snowflakes.  A shaky Fences and 
    Simone also rise, but Lois remains sitting.

                                    FENCES
                   Well, that was... invigorating.

                                    SUPERMAN
                   Lois?

    Lois lies unconscious, a trickle of blood from one nostril, 
    a red bump on her forehead.  Superman checks her pulse.

                                    FENCES
                   Is she...?

    Furious, Superman whirls to face Fences.

                   This is all your fault!

    For a second, it looks like he's going to kill Fences and 
    Simone; they shrink in horror.  Then his arms blur and he's 
    tied them tightly together with a scrap of heavy electrical 
    cable.  A moment later he bends and picks up Lois.  He leaps 
    out of frame.



    Lois lies in bed, a square gauze bandage on her forehead.  
    She's slightly propped up on a pillow.  There are Get Well 
    bouquets and balloons around her.  Perry and Jimmy stand 
    beside the bed.

                                    LOIS
                   ... then, because I'd had two

                   Lois, I don't want to see you for a 
                   week.  You've had a bad concussion 
                   and if it wasn't for that thick 
                   skull of yours, it would've been a 
                   fracture.

                                    LOIS
                   Don't worry, I get nauseous every
                   time I move faster than a crawl.

                                    PERRY
                   Good!  That'll teach you to keep 
                   your head down the next time

                   I'll remember that.

    There's a breeze and everyone turns to see Superman.

                   No. I got... careless.  I was 
                   overconfident.  No matter how bad 
                   the situation is, I always think 
                   I'm strong enough, or fast enough 
                   to fix it.

                                    LOIS
                   And you _are_!  You saved a whole 
                   city full of people from being 
                   microwaved like popcorn!

                                    SUPERMAN
                   But you still got hurt.  I used
                   to saving people, not getting them
                   injured.

                                    LOIS
                   You can't control everything.  You 
                   can't protect everybody all the 
                   time, Clark.  It's impossible.

                                    SUPERMAN
                   I know.  That's what my Dad said.

                                    LOIS
                   But we can handle it.
                   Clark ... darling ... there's something
                   I want to tell you.

                                    SUPERMAN
                         (in hell)
                   There's something I need to tell
                   you, too.

                                    LOIS
                   I know this isn't the best time, or
                   the most romantic, but --

    But Superman isn't listening.  He's come here to say 
    something and he's going to say it.

                                    SUPERMAN
                   Lois, I love you too much to ever 
                   let something like this happen to 
                   you again.  I know I can't control 
                   everything, but I can control 
                   people not using you to get to me.
                         (he stands up)
                   That's why I came here.  To tell 
                   you... I don't think this is going 
                   to work out.  I'm sorry.

    Lois is stunned.  Superman cocks his head.  He's heard 
    another emergency.

                                    SUPERMAN (CONT'D)
                   I gotta go.

    With a sad look, he leaves.

                                    LOIS
                         (beat)
                   Clark?

                                                       FADE OUT.
                                _THE END_
