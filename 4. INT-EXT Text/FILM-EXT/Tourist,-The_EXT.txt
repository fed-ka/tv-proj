CRANE DOWN from a view of Paris on a misty day.
Cool,
gray and beautiful.
A taxi stops by the curb of a wide, cobbled street. All
around there is bustle and activity, with cars and people
hurrying about their business.
The door opens and a pair of exquisitely shaped female
legs in Christian Louboutin high heels swing out.
The gleaming Orient Express pulls out of the station and
gets underway.
The Orient Express plows through the Alps. PUSH IN ON a
window where we see Frank and Cara sitting at a romantic,
candlelit table eating dinner.
The magnificent Prefecture de Police on the Ile de la
Cit. A convoy of black Mercedes arrives.
SUPER:
ONE YEAR AGO
Fog covers the skyline, exposing only the slate rooftops
of buildings that haven't changed in centuries. We hear
the sound of water gently lapping the shore.
From out of the mist emerges...
A GUARDACOSTE -- a patrol boat, lights dimmed. It gently
touches the beach. A CARABINIERI officer lowers a ramp.
An INTERPOL TACTICS TEAM in Kevlar and headgear pours out
of the patrol boat.
Ackerman steps off, pulling on a vest.
He nods to Goyal.
ACKERMAN
Finally.
Let's go.
14.
They follow the team.
ANGLE ON A SPECIALIST who kneels to open an electric
panel. REVEAL a glass plate with a fingertip shape in
the center. The SPECIALIST places his hand against the
glass: a red light beeps on -- it's a bio-metric lock.
He turns to Ackerman.
SPECIALIST
This is gonna take a few minutes.
Ackerman betrays no impatience. He knows better than to
rush the professionals. He simply nods.
The Specialist opens a tool box filled with sophisticated
gear and gets to work...
CARA stands alone on the platform amid the bustle of the
station. The gleaming train stretches out behind her.
Frank steps off the train and glances about at the hive
of activity.
Frank brushes past the GOOD-LOOKING ENGLISHMAN from the
Paris station. Finally he spots her...
FRANK'S POV - Cara with her back turned.
Frank hurries over.
FRANK
I was afraid I'd missed you. I
wanted to ask where you're staying
in Venice... I'm supposed to catch a
shuttle to my hotel but I thought
maybe--
CARA
(without turning)
I've got a better idea.
She holds out her valise for him.
He takes it hesitantly. She peers at him over the rims
of her sunglasses with a very slight smile...
HARD CUT TO:
A beauty shot of the Grand Canal: magnificent palaces and
churches soar upwards on either side in all their glory.
PUSH IN ON A launch labelled Danieli, travelling fast
over the water. Cara shakes her head to let the wind
ruffle her hair.
CAMERA CONTINUES PAST HER TO REVEAL Frank, clutching the
railing beside her, afraid to wake up.
19.
Frank stands on the balcony in a daze. He stares down at
the Molo and across St. Mark's Basin to San Georgio
Maggiore. Cara joins him.
CARA
You like it?
Frank opens his mouth to answer.
Then laughs.
FRANK
What's not to like?
CARA
I'd have been bored here on my
own. There's more than enough
room for two.
FRANK
I can see that.
CARA
I didn't ask for an extra bed...
Frank looks at her for a beat, barely able to breathe.
CARA (CONT'D)
Are you all right with the sofa?
If you like, I can have them bring
one up?
His face falls.
He tries to cover up his reaction.
FRANK
No, no, no. The sofa's fine.
Perfect in fact.
Before he can say more, the buzzer sounds.
CARA
The luggage.
FRANK
I'll get it.
He goes back inside to answer the door.
Cara remains alone on the balcony, immobile, as if
holding her breath. She's waiting... listening.
22.
Cara relaxes again as she hears Frank approach.
He steps
outside on the balcony.
FRANK
I've put my things in the other
bathroom.
She turns to face him.
CARA
Have you ever been to Venice
before?
He shakes his head.
CARA (CONT'D)
Then we need to go out.
CUT TO:
A Gulfstream G550 executive jet banks over the Venetian
coast and comes in for a landing...
Wheels down. Stairway unfolds. The man who steps off
the plane is dressed in a hand-tailored Italian suit and
shoes that cost more than some cars. He's flanked by two
bodyguards.
IVAN DEMIDOV.
In the flesh.
CAMERA floats over the rooftops toward the penthouse of a
ultra-high end business hotel.
A clear, bright winter day at the beach. Devoid of
tourists, the famous stretch is a completely different
Venice from the one we're used to seeing.
Sandbanks stretch out into the dark green sea.
Cara and Frank walk on a deserted patch of sand.
The
wind wraps her light sun dress around her body,
intermittently hugging her perfect curves.
CARA
So... when you're not on a Grand
European Tour, what do you do in
Rosemont, Pennsylvania?
FRANK
I'm a teacher. High school math.
And you? What do you do?
She glances at him slyly over her movie star shades.
CARA
This is what I do, Frank.
FRANK
You're good at it.
A sound of voices and laughter drift toward them. Up
ahead on the beach they see a group of Italians in formal
clothes. A woman wears a white bridal dress.
CARA
Oh look... a wedding.
How lovely.
FRANK
I'm not really into weddings at
this particular moment in my life...
CARA
Oh yes.
I forgot.
She takes his arm and steers him toward a bistro with
sidewalk tables.
CUT TO:
Cara and Frank are seated.
A bottle of Orvieto rests on
the table.
26.
CARA
Do you think it's really over?
FRANK
Hmm?
CARA
Maybe she'll change her mind.
Women do. She might give you a
second chance.
FRANK
I suppose that's a possibility.
(hesitates)
That's what I tell my statistics
class anyway; life is a game of
chance. Endless possibilities and
permutations. You just have to
calculate the odds.
CARA
You haven't answered the question.
FRANK
Well...
(quietly)
I'd like to think that love is a
question of destiny, not chance...
Cara looks at him curiously.
CARA
For a moment there you just
reminded me of somebody.
She shakes her head and takes a sip of wine.
CARA (CONT'D)
He had a way of dancing around a
question so eloquently that you
never noticed until later that
he'd completely avoided the truth.
His entire life was wrapped up in
deception.
(lost in thought)
He told so many lies, I wouldn't
believe him even if he finally did
tell the truth.
FRANK
He doesn't sound like much of a
friend.
27.
CARA
He wasn't.
Frank glances at her wrist.
FRANK
So why are you wearing his watch?
She looks up at him.
CARA
You're smarter than you look,
Frank.
She runs her fingertip over the face of the watch. Then,
impulsively unclasps it and reaches for Frank's hand.
CARA (CONT'D)
And you're right. Here, take it.
She puts it on Frank's wrist, over his protests.
FRANK
What? No, I can't. This thing
must be worth a fortune--
CARA
I insist. You're doing me a
favor.
(firm)
Take it or I'll toss it in the
ocean.
He hesitates.
She means it.
He closes the clasp.
FRANK
I'll wear it until you regain your
senses.
He feels the heft of it on his wrist. Admires it for a
moment. It really is a beautiful watch. She settles
back in her chair, pleased with herself.
He looks up and sees her smiling at him.
FRANK (CONT'D)
What?
CARA
It suits you.
28.
LONG SHOT of Frank and Cara framed by the sunset. A
romantic dinner for two. They could easily be lovers or
honeymooners...
In the foreground REVEAL somebody watching them.
The
good-looking Englishman is there, hovering...
Cara looks out across the lagoon.
Frank appears beside her.
FRANK
I could get used to this.
A movement in the street down below catches her eye. She
studies the Ponte del Vin intently, seeing something.
Cara turns abruptly to Frank and presses her body against
his. He's taken by surprise but willingly responds to
her advance, wrapping his arms around her back.
They exchange a long, passionate kiss.
VIDEO POV OF THE SAME
REVEAL the lens of a PALM-SIZED VIDEO CAMERA peering out
from behind a vendor's cart in the street below.
Frank, his face slightly obscured, kisses Cara.
WE HEAR the WHIRRING of the video camera.
29.
I/E. DOGE'S SUITE/BALCONY - RESUME
Still kissing, Cara leads Frank back into the hotel room...
The silhouettes of Cara and Frank disappear into the
hotel room as...
Frank looks down and stares at the
DIZZYING SIX STORY DROP
to the cobblestones of the Ponte del Vin below.
Guests sit on their balconies with their morning coffee.
Three balconies over, Frank sees the rooftop of the
modern wing of the hotel.
IN THE SUITE
The two TOUGHS rapidly move through the room, searching.
Nyet, Nyet.
34.
The one place they haven't checked...
THE BALCONY
Frank puts one bare foot on the stonework. He grimaces
as he HEAVES himself onto the railing of the balcony
adjacent to his.
He hangs desperately, flailing, 100 feet over the street
below. He gets a tentative hold...
A PALLID FRENCH WOMAN drops her coffee and screams.
The Russians sprint out to the balcony.
They spot
Frank...
Who shoves the Pallid Woman inside, struggles past her
breakfast table, and prepares to leap again-- but slips
on the spilled coffee.
Bullets shatter China around him. He cuts his foot on a
broken plate. He grabs his bleeding foot.
FRANK
Goddamn it!
I'm a fucking
tourist!
Another round of shots ring out.
They don't seem to
care.
Frank goes over the railing with another awkward HEAVE.
His pursuers scale the adjoining stone work and step onto
the Pallid Woman's balcony.
This time Frank lands in the lap of a BURLY WELSHMAN.
BURLY WELSHMAN
Are ya bloody mad?
The Burly Welshman PUNCHES Frank in the stomach, which
drops him out of the way of...
TWO SHOTS
Which explode into the Welshman's shoulder.
He cries out
and falls down on top of Frank.
The Russians stand on the Pallid Woman's balcony and
prepare to JUMP...
as Frank crawls out from under the wounded Welshman and
peers over the next balcony...
35.
Which is at least TWENTY FEET from the roof.
He misjudged the distance.
FRANK
Shit...
Frank sprints along the edge of the canal, dodging
tourists and children, vendors and locals. He spots a
VENDOR'S three wheel BICYCLE and jumps on.
As he pedals, he realizes it's too slow so he JUMPS
OFF...
and FALLS - a painful spill, he cuts his hand - but
clambers to his feet as the Russians bear down. Running
up hidden stairs he finds the roof of a shop on the Riva
Degli Schiavoni...
36.
Frank runs down the ridge of the roof.
A silenced shot
hits roof tile nearby and throws him off balance. He
FALLS...
...bumping down the other side of the roof until, as he
topples over the edge, he thrusts a hand at the gutter,
smashing his head against the wall. He drops onto the
pavement along the edge of the small canal.
He doubles back towards the lagoon. Looking back, he sees
the men still in pursuit.
He turns into the Campo San Zaccaria, scattering the
flapping and fluttering PIGEONS.
The Gondolieri and
their passengers watch the half-naked man run past and
cheer.
A GONDOLIER
(in Italian)
Run faster, man!
The Russians force their way past the pedestrians.
They
have almost caught him when...
The Russians burst out the back.
There is no sign of Frank.
Scarface looks at the Canal. He walks to the edge of the
water and SPRAYS gun fire atop it. Nothing.
CUT TO:
37.
HIGH ANGLE OF SCENE
Frank lies huddled on his back IN THE AWNING behind the
leather shop, barely able to control his frantic
breathing. He's mere feet away from the men who are
trying to kill him...
He looks up and sees: the scowling face of an Italian
WOMAN peering out over her window box.
Frank raises a desperate finger to his lips.
A prayer
that she won't give him away.
She looks at him disapprovingly.
Then disappears back
inside.
CLOSE ON FRANK as he waits, his heart pounding.
Seconds tick past...
is he safe?
Rrrrrip! A black cylinder, like the barrel of a gun,
tears through the awning fabric inches from his Frank's
head.
He cries out. The awning rips and dumps him down hard
onto the cobblestones below...
A MOMENTARY BLACKOUT
Frank opens his eyes and sees two pairs of black boots
that belong to... A PAIR OF CARBINIERI who stand over him.
One of them holds a nightstick.
They stare down at the bloodied tourist in his underpants
lying at their feet. They've seen stranger things.
CUT TO:
The car is parked along a muddy canal. Beside it runs a
small disconnected set of palazzos. Cara shakes Frank.
He won't wake up.
CARA
Frank... Frank.
He's snoring.
She pinches his nose closed...
He startles awake.
She smiles mischievously.
ON A SIDE STREET
He follows her past abandoned tricycles and very old men
sitting on stone steps.
FRANK
And I thought I wouldn't get to do
any sight-seeing.
Frank steps over a greenish puddle.
CARA
Here we are.
She pauses before a run-down palazzo.
The ENGLISHMAN strolls the Piazza San Marco.
FOLLOW HIM
from behind as he speaks into his phone.
THE ENGLISHMAN
Have you been reading the
newspaper?
58.
IN THE SAFE HOUSE
Cara narrows her focus. She walks away from Frank,
stealing away into the bedroom. Her heart is beating.
CARA
Yes... there was nothing there
today. Is... is it you? Alexa--
THE ENGLISHMAN
No names.
Not on the phone.
The Englishman passes the Lagoon to his left, and enters
an enormous courtyard, the Arco Foscari. He looks down
at his watch...
THE ENGLISHMAN
You're a brave and loyal girl.
I'm in awe of you.
At last The Englishman arrives before the lower colonnade
of the DOGE'S PALACE, the seat of medieval Venetian civic
government. It is a wonder of Gothic architecture with
spires piercing the blue sky.
He gazes up at it for a moment.
60.
THE ENGLISHMAN
You may not believe it, but every
step of this miserable game is
taken in the hope of earning your
trust and ever-lasting regard. I
mean that.
The Englishman is at the Ponte del Suspiri-- the "Bridge
of Sighs."
The Englishman closes his phone and disappears into the
crowd.
A silent caravan of three black SUV's - a strange sight
in Venice - pull up in perimeter around the Bridge of
Sighs and skids to a stop.
Ackerman and the others leap out, looking around.
Then
Ackerman sees it:
The Englishman's CELL PHONE, sitting on the cobblestones.
61.
They approach.
Goyal kneels to pick it up with a plastic
bag.
GOYAL
We should check for prints.
Maybe
he forgot to wipe it down...
ACKERMAN
I doubt it.
Ackerman looks around.
Establishing shots of the city as it comes to life in the
winter time.
Boats are pushed out into the canals...
Trash is hosed from the cobblestone streets...
Tables and chairs are set out at sidewalk cafes, waiting
for the tourists to come...
62.
Heels clicking on the cobblestones, Cara strides quickly
along the Palazzo Vendramin en route to the Cipriani.
She checks her watch. Then walks faster.
She passes a smallish transporto via cargo (supply boat)
floating in the lagoon beside the Palazzo.
Cara approaches the poolside hotel restaurant.
Fanning herself with a newspaper, Cara discreetly
evaluates the men in her sight lines. Venetian civic
leaders chatting by the bar, tourists reading maps...
Over her sunglasses she catches sight of a pair of YOUNG
LOVERS drunk in each other's grasp in the pool.
She turns away.
The VIDEO CAMERA swivels to follow a MAN, elegantly
dressed, with trim hair who swiftly approaches Cara's
table...
IN THE TRANSPORTO
Standing up, Ackerman holds his hand up.
69.
ACKERMAN
(into the speaker)
Hold...wait for my signal...
AT THE RESTAURANT
Cara glances up from her menu as she senses the elegant
man approaching.
The WAITER walks quickly toward Cara's table...
The elegant man is FRANK.
IN THE TRANSPORTO
Ackerman stares at the monitor with Frank's face on it.
He's quietly furious.
ACKERMAN
What is that fool doing in the
middle of my operation?
AT THE RESTAURANT
Cara stares slack-jawed at Frank.
He has given himself a complete make-over.
New haircut.
Pearce's suit fits him well.
He looks terrific. Cara notices before quickly recovering
her composure.
FRANK
Time for Alexander and me to meet
face to face.
CARA
(quietly)
I don't know what you're talking
about. Please go, I'd like to
have a quiet coffee.
Frank sits at the table with Cara and eats a CASHEW.
IN THE TRANSPORTO
Ackerman barks whispered orders into the speaker:
70.
ACKERMAN
(frustrated)
Move off. Move off.
The UNDERCOVER WAITER quickly moves away from Cara's
table.
Ackerman stares at the monitor which captures Cara's
angry expression.
ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
(talking to the
screen)
Get rid of him!
AT THE POOLSIDE RESTAURANT
Defiantly, Frank pulls his chair in closer to Cara.
He
signals to a different THIN WAITER.
FRANK
(to the waiter)
Caffe, per favore?
Frank turns back to Cara, who calls out--
CARA
Cameriere!
No caffe for signor!
FRANK
(contradicting her)
With milk!
She stares at him.
CARA
Do you want to be dead?
FRANK
Not particularly, but I'm tired of
being afraid. I've been running
around like a frightened mouse
long enough and I've decided I'm
finished.
Frank pulls out a Gitane cigarette.
He lights it,
smoking while he talks.
71.
FRANK (CONT'D)
When I first saw the name I got
scared: "Alexander Pearce." He
even sounds like some super cool
master criminal with Russian
enemies and the beautiful
girlfriend... he probably works out.
He might own a pizza shop on the
side for all I know.
Frank frowns at the cigarette.
FRANK (CONT'D)
These are disgusting.
Cara looks all around.
No sign of any suitor
approaching.
CLOSE ON: the hands of the THIN WAITER, who sprinkles
pepper carefully, presumably onto a dish. He then
platters the dish and lifts it over his shoulder.
CARA
Frank, you have no idea what
you're sticking your nose into.
FRANK
Probably not. But I'm doing it
anyway. Alexander Pearce nearly
got me killed. It was his idea,
right?
(MORE)
72.
FRANK (CONT'D)
He told you to pick out some
random sap on the train to take a
bullet for him, didn't he?
Frank works himself up, drawing courage from his anger.
FRANK (CONT'D)
Well I'm not playing the role
anymore. I'm going to confront
him. He's supposed to meet you
here, isn't he? I'm going to tell
him exactly what I think of him.
CARA
Wonderful. Another macho idiot.
(to the waiter)
Conto, per favore!
Frank leans in.
FRANK
What's the lure, Cara? Obviously
not his character. Is it the
money? The luxury? What's any of
that worth if you're getting shot
at and you could go to jail?
CARA
I'm leaving Frank.
FRANK
He's smooth, right? He probably
has mistresses in every European
city, too.
CARA
It's really a shame you've scared
him off--
She tosses some Euros on the table.
CARA (CONT'D)
The two of you make a nice couple.
The THIN WAITER arrives with a PLATTER.
He sets it down
in front of Cara.
The UNDERCOVER WAITER now moves toward the table with a
grim expression...
The THIN WAITER removes the platter.
Cara looks down.
73.
Spelled out in SALT and PEPPER on the plate is the
following:
"MY VILLA.
TONIGHT. 8PM."
Cara no sooner reads it than the Thin Waiter, who we now
see is THE ENGLISHMAN...
...BLOWS on the platter, scattering the salt and pepper
granules to the wind.
FRANK
What the hell?
As Frank looks up.
The Englishman has already turned away, but the
Undercover Waiter is moving quickly toward Cara's table.
The Undercover Waiter picks up speed, changing course
slightly. WE SEE he's after The Englishman who is about
to enter the restaurant kitchen...
Then FRANK steps in front of The Undercover Waiter,
mistaking him for Pearce.
FRANK (CONT'D)
Is this him?
CARA
Frank!
Frank brushes past tables, hits the street and RUNS down
the Palazzo, toward Cara.
FRANK
Cara!
Cara says nothing. She just shoots Frank an angry glance
and climbs onto A VAPORETTO (water taxi).
75.
Frank runs to the edge of the water as it motors away.
Suddenly he feels the presence of somebody behind him.
TWO of ACKERMAN'S MEN are right there.
They pin his arms forcefully.
AGENT
Ok Signor... you can come with us
now.
Frank looks at the two big men on either side of him.
Then at Cara disappearing over the water. The fight
drains out of him and he doesn't resist.
CUT TO:
Frank stands on a balcony overlooking a waterway.
Ackerman emerges with two cups of espresso. Hands one to
Frank.
ACKERMAN
Women like Cara don't come along
very often.
FRANK
In my case, they don't come along
at all.
ACKERMAN
She's the worst combination:
stunning looks and a brilliant
mind.
FRANK
If she's so smart, how did she get
caught up with Pearce?
ACKERMAN
It started out as a
straightforward placement...
The wind blows in Cara's hair. She sits on the top deck.
A MAN'S HAND passes her a drink as he walks by. She
smiles at him (again we do not see his face).
ACKERMAN (V.O.)
Then she began missing drops.
Omitting important details.
80.
Ackerman turns to Frank.
ACKERMAN
She was no longer with us.
She
was with him.
Ackerman finishes his espresso.
ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
She explains it now as the
confusion of her new life outside
the academy. That I misread her
capacity for this kind of work.
FRANK
Then why are you still using her?
ACKERMAN
She's all I have, Mr. Taylor.
Beat.
FRANK
You think she'll turn him in this
time?
ACKERMAN
I don't know.
Goyal walks up behind Ackerman waiting patiently for a
moment to interrupt him.
ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
I do know however, that you are
very smitten with her.
Frank looks back at him evenly.
FRANK
It's not just me, is it?
Ackerman acknowledges the point with the barest of nods.
Goyal signals that Ackerman has a phone call.
CUT TO:
81.
The principal apartment of a Venetian palazzo, looking
out over the Grand Canal.
Cara holds her cell phone to her ear as she walks.
ACKERMAN (V.O.)
Cara?
Where have you been?
INTERCUT WITH
ACKERMAN on the phone at his office.
CARA
Have you got him?
ACKERMAN
You mean the idiot who ruined our
operation?
CARA
Have you got him?
Ackerman glances out the window at Frank.
ACKERMAN
Yes.
Cara is relieved.
CARA
It's your own fault. We never
should have endangered a civilian.
You should have put an agent into
place.
ACKERMAN
There was no time. Besides Pearce
is too smart for that; he would
have spotted the agent a mile
away.
CARA
He didn't spot me.
Ackerman smiles bitterly.
ACKERMAN
Apparently he didn't have to.
Cara doesn't answer. Ackerman regrets the jibe.
He
steps into a HALLWAY where it's quiet.
82.
ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
I'm sorry Cara. That was uncalled
for.
ON HER FACE as she listens to him.
ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
I'm on edge because of our failure
today. If only the American
hadn't messed everything up... I
felt sure Pearce would show up
today.
CARA
What makes you think he didn't?
Ackerman's face lights up...
CUT TO:
A light mist. The sound of water lapping against the
shore. The scene is familiar... almost identical to the
night of the raid just over a year ago.
Then a wind picks up and blows the mist clear.
REVEAL an undercover POLICEMAN with an earpiece walking a
dog a block away...
ON A ROOFTOP three blocks away -
A SNIPER with a scope.
INSIDE AN APARTMENT - a FEMALE AGENT with binoculars
scans the empty street below.
86.
ON THE CORNER - two blocks down is a village CHURCH.
A PATROL BOAT circles in the canal behind the villa.
One
of Ackerman's ITALIAN AGENTS is at the wheel.
He sees a flat-bottomed black BOAT motoring toward him.
A light from the boat shines in his eyes.
87.
AGENT
(in Italian)
You'll have to turn around, sir.
There's been a chemical spill in
this area--
FWWWAP! A silenced bullet strikes him in the forehead.
The agent topples into the water with a gentle splash.
The black boat steers around the rudderless patrol boat
and heads toward the villa...
The black boat slips underneath some moorings.
A gloved hand tosses a grappling hook up to a beam ten
feet overhead. It catches. The boat is tied off.
Silently, a masked figure begins to climb from the boat
up into the bottom floor of the villa in the semi-
darkness.
SNIPER'S POV - CARA has maneuvered close enough to the
window that she is visible. As they approach, Demidov
and his two men come into range as well.
SNIPER
(into his radio mic)
She's brought them to the window...
Frank runs for all he's worth.
Panting for breath.
SNIPER'S POV - Demidov and his gun-wielding henchmen
standing over Frank and Cara.
Ackerman and his team approach, guns drawn.
Undercover agents converge as well, closing the
perimeter.
Cara and Frank step on board.
The DRIVER starts the engine.
He turns to REVEAL... that he is the "ENGLISHMAN" we've
seen throughout the movie. He and Frank look at one
another for a moment.
THE ENGLISHMAN
$20 million dollars worth of
surgery and that's the face you
chose?
FRANK
(English accent)
It's good to see you too.
They embrace warmly. Cara is in disbelief, realizing
just how completely Frank/Alexander has planned things
out.
She casts one last glance backwards.
102.
CARA
You really think they'll just give
up?
FRANK
The Americans have their money.
I
left it all for them.
CARA
What about Demidov's money?
FRANK
Well...
(smiles)
You have to save something for
your pension.
The Englishman opens the door to the cabin for them.
A bottle of Crystal Champagne and two glasses are set out
for them. Frank leads Cara in and offers her a glass.
Instead, she slips into his arms and presses against him.
They begin to kiss...
CAMERA STAYS discreetly behind as they pull away from us,
the water taxi swinging out into the Grand Canal.
As it recedes from view, the vaporetto's tail lamps
shimmer and blend into the beautiful lights of Venice...
a
city for lovers.
