          Johnny's Range Rover cruises along through the wooded
            countryside.

                                        SARAH V.O.
                          I appreciate you driving us out
                        to see my father.



          The Rover turns off onto a side road and past a sign that
          reads, "FOXGLOVE RETIREMENT HOME"  'More Than Friends,
          We're Like Family'.  There's a picture of a smiling elderly
          man and woman.  The perfect place to spend your golden
          years.



          Johnny is standing in the woods.  It seems peaceful enough
          as he turns and SEES the back of what appears to be an
          OLDER WOMAN sitting on the ground against a rock.  Johnny
          steps closer to get a better look.  As he steps around,
          we see the woman's eyes are open, her face seems peaceful
          and content, but there's something wrong about her.  Her
          eyes don't move, her skin seems pale and dried.  As Johnny
          leans down to look closer at her face, a LARGE BUG suddenly
          CRAWLS OUT OF HER MOUTH.  Johnny jumps back.  It's now
          obvious that she's DEAD.


  88RESUME - RESTROOM

          Johnny flashes quickly out of the vision, staring at
          himself in the mirror.  What the hell was that?



          Johnny finds Sarah staring out a large window.

                                        SARAH
                                (covering her pain)
                        He looks good, doesn't he?  A
                        little pale, but that's to be
                          expected...

                        I'm glad he's taking an interest
                        in his grandson.  A boy should
                        know his grandfather before it's
                        too late.

          A BEAT, then...

                        Sarah Anne?

          Sarah and Johnny turn to see the very same little Old
          Woman Johnny saw in his bathroom vision.

                                        SARAH
                                (surprised to see her)
                        Mrs. Anderson?  Oh my God! 

          Sarah and the woman embrace.

                        It's been... twenty years.

                        She used to open our refrigerator
                        and stick her fingers in the honey
                        jar.

                        I can't believe you remember that. 
                        And I had no idea you were here.

                        We didn't get a chance to talk.

          Sarah realizes Johnny is standing behind her.

                                        SARAH
                        I'm sorry.  Johnny, this is Mrs.

                        We've met... kind of.

                        Call me Bebe, everybody does.

          They shake hands, WHOOSH...



          Another QUICK FLASH from the previous vision.  The BUG
          CRAWLING OUT OF HER MOUTH.



          Johnny flashes out, even more disturbed by what he's seen.

                                        SARAH
                        Bebe s husband was in charge of
                        my father's old Army unit.  They

                        That's amazing.

                        Joe's been gone six years now. 
                        You don't know how it lifted my
                        spirits to see Marty again.

                                        SARAH
                        I'm happy Dad has a friend here.

                        Oh, you know your father--he's
                        such a people person.

          Sarah exchanges a look with Johnny, 'people person'?

                        God rest her soul.

          Sarah can't help but be touched and slightly bothered by
          the comment.

                                        BEBE
                        Well, I'm off for bingo.  Don't
                        be strangers.  Toodle-oo!

          She moves off.  Johnny isn't sure what to do...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sarah, that woman is...

                        A Godsend.  Maybe Dad and I won't
                        ever be close, but at least I
                        know he won't be completely alone.

          Johnny decides not to say anything until he knows more
          about the situation.



          Bebe is once again dead in the field.  Stylize rapid fire
          shots that are CLOSE ON different angles: face, foot,
          eye.  A bug comes out of her mouth, very horror
              movie/nightmare-looking.


  2121RESUME - CARD ROOM

          Johnny comes out of vision to see the live Bebe staring
          at him expectantly, a smile on her face.  Johnny shakes
          his head.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm sorry.

                        It was a gift from my husband.  I
                        was hoping you could tell me that
                        he's alright.  Even happy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm sure, wherever he is, he's
                        both if he's thinking about you.

          She smiles and walks away, as Bruce steps up to him.

                        That's what I'm saying, I spoke
                        to the night duty nurse and she
                        said Mrs. Anderson never tried to
                        go outside.  She said she ate
                        dinner and went straight to bed.

                        That doesn't make sense. 

          They both ponder this.  It's a chilly moment.

  2525EST. SHOT - FUNERAL HOME - NEXT DAY (DAY 4)

          The funeral home is on the grounds of the lovely old New
          England cemetery.  Gnarled old trees, crooked old
          headstones from the 1700s.  Again, classic Stephen King
          feel.  Cars are pulling up for Bebe's memorial.



          Sarah is walking briskly through the cemetery.  Johnny
          catches up to her, keeps walking with her.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sarah.  Please, stop. 

          Sarah stops, and looks around at the headstones surrounding
          them.

                        I feel like my life has a gigantic
                        hole in it.  Maybe someday I'll

                          I didn't.  Don't wait for your

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why would he be angry at you?

          Sarah stands and looks at Johnny.

                                        SARAH
                        Because he thinks I killed my
                        mother.

          She walks away.  On Johnny,



          Again, Bebe is dead in the woods.  Then Vision Johnny
          turns and sees, a few paces away, an ARM sticking up out
          of a stream.  He walks over, looks down at AN AFRICAN
          AMERICAN MAN lying face up but underwater in the stream,
          eyes open.  He leans in closer, sees something truly
            chilling: the number 342 written in magic marker on the
          man's neck.  He looks back at Bebe, and notices "343"
          scrawled on the bottom of her foot.



          Vision Johnny sees Bebe dead in the field again, then
          FLASH

          The African American man in the stream, then FLASH as he
          TURNS he suddenly notices --

          MARTY, also dead in the woods and oddly propped up against
          a tree   a similar looking 3-digit number stenciled across
          the inside of his right forearm.           DEAD ZONE: "Old Dead" - ACT TWO - 4/27/05 - PINK     31.

          Johnny comes out of the vision.

                        He's going to die just like the

          FADE IN:



          Johnny's on the phone to Walt, trying to keep his voice
          down.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know what I'm seeing,
                        Walt, but it's not The Great
                        Beyond.  Can you meet me?

                                        WALT ON PHONE
                        I've kinda got my hands full at
                        the moment.

          PULL OUT TO REVEAL:



          Walt's got his foot on a handcuffed BIKER DUDE's head as
          he talks to Johnny on the cell.

                                        WALT
                        Shut up.
                                (into phone)
                        We just busted a meth lab out in
                          Landell.  Sarah's on her way over
                        there now.  I'll catch up with
                        you as soon as I can.



          Sarah's looking up at the night sky.  Johnny sits next to
          her.

                                        SARAH
                        I've tried, every way I can to
                        get close to him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's hurting.

                                        SARAH
                        He's never going to forgive me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It wasn't your fault.  

                                        SARAH
                        I was late.  I should have been
                        there, and I wasn't.

                        It wouldn't have mattered.

          He searches for a way to tell her, then--

                                        JOHNNY
                                (quietly)
                        She didn't suffer.

          Sarah looks at him, realizing...

                                        SARAH
                        You saw my mother die?

          Johnny eyes never leaving Sarah's, as she begins to tear
          up.

                                        JOHNNY
                        She heard your voice on the
                          answering machine--you told her
                        you were in the library studying. 
                        She smiled when you said that. 

          On Sarah, so needing to hear this.

                                        SARAH
                                (smiling through her
                                  tears)
                        She did?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Then you told her that you loved
                        her.  She picked up a picture of
                        you and held it.
                                (beat)
                        Sarah, your voice was the last
                        thing she heard.  It was your
                        words, "I love you," that she
                        held inside her heart when she
                        passed.  What more could a person
                        want?

          Sarah stares at him, then starts to crumble.  He pulls
          her into a hug, her shoulders trembling from the release. 
          She sits up, looks Johnny in the eye.

                                        SARAH
                          I blamed myself all these years. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know.  It's time to let it go.

          She wipes her eyes.

                                        SARAH
                        If only I could get him to
                          understand.

                        Right now he's a little
                          preoccupied.

                        What kind of visions?

                        Dead bodies.  First Bebe, then a
                          resident who died here a month
                        ago.

                                        SARAH
                        You said there were three.

          They lock eyes.

                        Daddy?



          Bruce and Johnny--flashlight in tow--walk through the
            cemetery, looking for Bebe's headstone.

                                        BRUCE
                        This place gives me the creeps.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Good.  I owed you one for "Jonathan
                        the Mysterious."

          He stops in front of a newly-dug grave, shines the
          flashlight on the headstone.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Bebe's funeral was today.  So
                        where's the damn grave?



          A SHADOW creeps around the front of the garage.  PULL OUT
          TO REVEAL: JJ, having snuck out, backpack slung over his
            shoulder, slinking his bike down the driveway.  As he

          close up of A TENNIS BALL.  Suddenly we hear PANTING. 
          It's someone playing catch with a DOG?



          Bruce's car sits parked in the far parking lot.



          Around twists and turns in the curvy road, Bruce's car
          trails the step van until it disappears behind tall,
          ominous gates that clang shut before Bruce and Johnny can
          follow.



          Bruce and Johnny get out of the car, look for signage. 
          There is none.  Just dense woods, a chain link fence and
          razor wire on top.

                                        BRUCE
                        What now?

          Bruce and Johnny drop into frame, having scaled the tall
          fence from the other side.  Finding themselves in a wooded
          area.  It s very creepy as they break out flashlights.

                                        BRUCE
                        What is this place?

                        I have no idea.  Let's go.

            Reluctantly, Bruce follows Johnny into the dark woods.

                                                                    TIME DISSOLVE TO:



          Johnny is just ahead of Bruce.

                                        BRUCE
                        We've been walking for ten minutes
                        and it's nothing but trees and
                        bushes.

                                        JOHNNY
                          A little further.

                        That can't be good.

          Bruce takes several steps forward and stumbles over
            something and hits the ground.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You alright?

                          I ripped my pants.  What the hell
                        did I trip over?

          When Bruce shines his flashlight around behind him, they
          both see what he tripped over:

          IN THE LIGHT

          A FOOT attached to a hairy leg sticking out from behind a
          tree, THE NUMBER 839 written across the ankle.

          FADE IN:



          Utterly freaked-out, Johnny and Bruce hear DOGS in the
            distance, start to run.  As they do, they start to stumble
          over and see other bodies, arranged in horrible ways:

          A BODY SITTING PROPPED AGAINST A TREE

          A CORPSE LIES UNDER ROCKS

          The African American Man's corpse is in a stream (as it
          was in the vision)

          Bruce stumbles again and lands with his flashlight a few
          inches from a WOMAN'S SLIGHTLY DISTORTED FACE.

                                        BRUCE
                        This must be Hell.

          WE hear JJ's voice:

                                        JJ V.O.
                        It's a soul snatcher!

          TRUCK switch on, blinding them from every direction. 
          They shield their eyes against the light, disoriented and*
          afraid.*

                        Stop where you are!  You're
                          surrounded!

          Bruce and Johnny, hands up, exchange a look of fear.

                                        BRUCE
                        We are going to die!



          Walt, Johnny and Bruce are outside a trailer marked
          "Security".

                        of natural causes.  Spyder was
                          supposed to cremate or bury the

          MARTY, lying on the ground.  He's got a small cut on his

                                        MARTY
                        Once the spirit leaves the body,
                        what's it really matter?  Mummified
                        or eaten by wolves, in the end,
                        who really cares?

          A long BEAT, then...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I do!

                                        WALT
                        Me, too!

                                        SARAH
                        Daddy!

                                        JJ
                        Cool!

          Marty gets a kick out of this, as he grabs JJ around the
          neck...

                                        MARTY
                        I'm starving, who wants to eat?

          As Sarah shakes her head and starts passing out food, and
          they all enjoy this new day in sun.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                        ALTERNATE ENDING


          CAMERA FOLLOWS Sarah as she hurries up with a large picnic
          basket where Johnny, Bruce, JJ, Walt and Marty (his leg
          in a cast) are preparing to have a blanket picnic on the
          lawn under the big trees, foxglove blowing in the breeze.

                                        SARAH
                        Sorry I'm late.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I hope this isn't going to be a
                        habit?

          She and Johnny exchange a smile.  Sarah gives Walt a kiss
          on the cheek.

                                        SARAH
                        Hello.

                                        WALT
                        I was just telling these guys
                        that they picked up Spyder in
                        Boston.  He was trying to pawn
                        his drum set for a bus ticket to
                        Mexico.

                                        MARTY
                        He wasn't a bad kid.  Not very
                        bright.  But not bad.

          He locks eyes with Sarah, maybe for the first time ever.

                                        MARTY
                        People make the wrong choices
                        when they're confused.  You just
                        hope that the people you love
                        will still be there when you
                        finally figure things out.

          Sarah smiles back at him.

                                        MARTY
                        What's in the basket?

                                        SARAH
                          Chicken, potato salad and...
                                (lifts out a sealed
                                  plastic container)
                        Navy bean soup.

          Marty can't help but smile.          DEAD ZONE: "Old Dead" - ACT FOUR - 5/2/05 - WHT-2  57.


                                        MARTY
                        Your mother's recipe?

                                        SARAH
                        Yeah, it's Mom's.

                                        MARTY
                        Well, I don't know about the rest
                        of you, but I'm starving.  Let's
                        eat!

          Marty grabs JJ around the neck playfully.

          SHOT PULLS HIGH AND WIDE

          As Sarah starts passing out food.  Ad-LIB something FUN
          and NATURAL as the SHOT PULLS OUT.  Something like...

                                        WALT
                        I'll take some of that salad.

                                        BRUCE
                        I want some chicken.

                                        SARAH
                        Wing or a breast?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Be careful, there's a child
                          present.

                                        BRUCE
                        Hear that?  He might be psychic
                        but is mind is always in the
                        gutter.

                                        JOHNNY
                        My mind?  Look whose talking.

          BEAT, then...

                                        MARTY
                        Could somebody get me a fork?

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                              THE END
