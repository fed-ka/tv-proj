      Staff is both human and Newcomer. A few ambulatory Newcomer 
      patients walk the corridor. Cathy and Sikes appear from 
      around corner.                                  CATHY (pointing)
                    They're in the secure area.

      She and Sikes continue toward a set of swinging doors 
      marked AUTHORISED PERSONNEL ONLY. Cathy and Sikes flash 
      their I.D. to a security guard. He waves them through.


      George is at the far end of the hall with Buck who holds 
      Vessna to his chest. They peer through a glass window into 
      a room. Sikes and Cathy approach.

                                  SIKES
                    George...
                          (as George turns)
                    How are they?

      Shaking his head, George points to the glass window.

                                  GEORGE
                    The doctor's in with them.

      THEIR POV - THE HOSPITAL ROOM

      Where Susan and Emily lie bathed in eerie U.V. light and 
      therapeutic mist. A Newcomer doctor, Quinn, evaluates their 
      signs which flash across monitors above their beds. 
      Newcomer lab technician draws a pink blood sample from 
      Susan's shoulder while another doctor, a human woman, 
      examines Emily with a laryngoscope. Quinn exits, followed 
      by the other doctor.

      RESUME SCENE

      George distraught, turns to Sikes.

                                  GEORGE
                    Flowers came to the house... I should've 
                    been more careful... I shouldn't have let 
                    Susan and Emily near them...

                                  QUINN (approaching)
                    Mr Francisco... We've got them on life 
                    support. For now, it seems the intensive 
                    ultra violet and nitrogen are keeping your 
                    wife and daughter stable. 
                                  (MORE)                                  QUINN (approaching) (CONT'D)
                    But their condition is still critical.

                                  BUCK
                    Can we go inside?

                                  QUINN
                      I wouldn't recommend taking the baby -- she 
                    might be more vulnerable.

                                  CATHY (to Buck)
                    Go.
                            (reaching out)
                    I'll take her.

      Vessna CRIES, clinging to Buck.

                                  GEORGE
                    She senses something is wrong... she'll 
                    only let Buck or me hold her.

                                  BUCK
                    You go in, Dad. I'll be in the waiting 
                    room.

      He exits as George starts for Susan and Emily's room. 
      Sikes, feeling terrible for his friend and guilty over 
      their earlier fight, stops him.

                                  SIKES
                    George... if there's anything I can do...

                                  GEORGE
                            (conscious of the unresolved 
                            friction)
                    Thank you, Matthew.

      George enters the room.

      INSIDE

      The Newcomer lab technician, who has moved to Emily, 
      finishes taking a blood sample from her shoulder. The 
      syringe fills with Emily's pink blood. George approaches 
      through the purple mist, pausing to watch his daughter's 
      laboured breathing as she sleeps. He turns toward Susan 
      who, sensing her husband's presence, opens her eyes.                                  SUSAN (weak)
                      Stangya...

      Putting his finger to his lips, George signals Susan not to 
      tax herself. He tenderly touches her temple with his fist. 
      In the back ground the lab technician exits with his 
      samples.

      OUTSIDE THE ROOM

      Cathy observes through the window. Sikes stands next to 
      her.

                                  CATHY
                    I'm putting together a team to find an 
                      antitoxin. Your scientific investigation 
                    division knows as much about the bacterium 
                    as anyone so we're setting up in their 
                      laboratory.

      Sikes' attention is caught by the Newcomer lab technician. 
      Holding the blood samples, the technician stands dazed, 
      immobile, in the middle of the hall.

                                  SIKES
                    Is he all right?

      Concerned, Cathy approaches the Technician.

                                  CATHY
                    {Excuse me...}

      The technician turns to her, still dazed.

                                  TECHNICIAN
                    {The suns were eclipsed... darkness... only 
                      darkness...}
                          (to Sikes)
                    The night would last a thousand years.

                                  CATHY (gently touching his 
                                  arm)
                    Take these samples to the lab.

      The technician nods numbly and moves off. Cathy turns to a 
      puzzled Sikes.                                  CATHY
                    It's a Tenctonese legend... before we were 
                    taken into slavery, there was an eclipse of 
                    the suns. The Tenctonese sensed the end of 
                    their world.
                            (seeing Sikes doesn't 
                            understand)
                    This bacterium, Matt... it could destroy 
                    our entire species.

      She walks off. Sikes watches her a moment, then turns back 
      to the window.

      HIS POV - INSIDE THE ROOM

      George stands vigil over his wife and daughter.


      Busy. A glassy-eyed Newcomer woman is being led to the 
      holding cell by a human uniformed cop. They pass Zepeda 
      who's taking a file to her desk.

                                  COP
                    Hey, Zep, get this...
                            (re: Newcomer)
                    We caught her on her way up Trumo tower 
                    west.

                                  ZEPEDA
                    So?

                                  COP
                    Outside. She was climbing it.

                                  NEWCOMER WOMEN
                      A thousand years... a thousand years...

                                  COP
                      Something's going on with these Nukes.

                                  ZEPEDA
                    Yeah. We've been bringing 'em in all night.

      The cop leads the woman off. Zepeda heads for her desk 
      where the phone is RINGING. She answers it.                                  ZEPEDA
                    Detective Zepeda.
                            (listens)
                    Sir, I sympathise -- I've been against it 
                    myself since the early 90's. But L.A.P.D. 
                    has nothing to do with the renewed 
                    Malathion spraying.

                    office.

      She hangs up as Sikes approaches.

                                  ZEPEDA
                    How're Susan and Emily?

                    Crazy. Newcomers are losing it all over 
                    town and Rampart pulls half the first watch 
                    for that Malathion protest in --

                    They're not sleeping. The milk taverns were 
                    packed all night. We got Nukes chanting in 
                    the streets -- others are completely zoning 
                    out -- one guy left his rig in the middle 
                    of the San Bernardino Freeway -- just 
                    walked away.

                    Here's the S.I.D. report on the flowers 
                    that were sent to George's house. The 
                      handwriting on the note was the same as on 
                    those sent to Judge Kaiser and Peter Boggs. 
                    We also found similar traces of sea salt.                                  SIKES
                    So, Parris must've sent them to George 
                    before he was killed.

                                  ZEPEDA
                    But who killed Parris? And why?

                                  SIKES
                    I know a guy we can talk to about that.


      CAMERA PANS the large, partitioned lab to bomb squad 
      technician Max Jullian. Late twenties, T-shirt and jeans, 
      Max tosses a couple exploding caps -- metal balls, coated

      however, potted plants are against the exterior window. A 
      kitten sleeps at the foot of Emily's bed. A nurse opens the 
      interior window blinds as George, Albert and Sikes enter.

      her field commander, Mark her bodyguard follows.                                  BRYANT
                    What was so important? Is there a problem 
                    with the bacteria?

                                  GUERIN (urgent)
                    You have to see this.

      He pushes through a set of swing doors into:

      THE WAREHOUSE LAB

      A group of white-coated technicians cluster, their backs to 
      Guerin and Bryant.

                                  BRYANT (concerned)
                    What?

      Turning, the group parts, revealing a technician holding a 
      cake with a half dozen birthday candles.

                                  ALL
                    Happy birthday, Miss Bryant.

      Bryant smiles and laughs in relief.

                                  BRYANT (to Guerin)
                    You had me scared.
                            (admiring the cake)
                    This is very sweet. Thank you. All of you.

      She blows out the candles. Everyone APPLAUDS. The 
      technician sets the cake down on a table as Bryant picks up 
      a spatula.

                                  BRYANT
                    Here goes my diet.

      She begins slicing the cake.

                                  GUERIN
                    Miss Bryant, we have the best birthday gift 
                    you can imagine.
                            (re: Technician)
                    They found a way to replicate the bacteria 
                    twice as quickly. We'll be ready to spray 
                    in two days.                                  BRYANT
                    That's wonderful.
                            (handing him a piece of 
                            cake)
                    Tell me about the Franciscos -- I hear 
                    they're still alive.

                                  GUERIN
                    Only because they're on life support.
                            (taking a bite)
                    You can't put two hundred and fifty 
                    thousand slags on life support.

                                  BRYANT
                    What about the investigation into Parris's 
                    murder?

                                  GUERIN
                            (looking over her shoulder)
                    Here's the man to ask.

      She turns to see the police bomb squad tech, Max Julian.

                                  MAX
                    Happy birthday, Miss Bryant.
                            (beat)
                    I'm part of the investigation -- we don't 
                    have a thing to worry about.
                            (re: cake)
                    Can I have the flower?

                                                                              FADE OUT


                                  END OF ACT ONE                                        ACT TWO

                                                                              FADE IN:


      School is over - just a few students linger in the hallway. 
      A janitor sweeps the floor with a broom. Carrying Vessna in 
      her snuggly, Buck enters and heads toward a classroom. He 
      is spotted by principal Fisher, who intercepts him.

                                  FISHER
                    Mr Francisco...

      Without pausing, Buck acknowledges the Principal, his 
      enemy, with a nod.

                                  FISHER (louder)
                    Mr Francisco.

      Sighing, Buck pauses. The Principal motions Buck over.

                                  FISHER
                    I was sorry to hear about your family. How 
                    are they?

                                  BUCK
                    Nobody knows.

      Fisher leans in to peer at Vessna.

                                  FISHER
                    Is this your little sister?

      Vessna responds with an irritable howl.

                                  FISHER (backing away)
                    She's very pretty.

                                  BUCK
                    I gotta go.

                                  FISHER
                    If you're picking up your assignments, I 
                    have them in my office.                                  BUCK
                    I'll get them from...
                            (being discreet)
                    ...Ms. Houston.

                                  FISHER
                    Ms. Houston isn't here. She elected to 
                    transfer schools.

                                  BUCK
                    She wouldn't go - She wouldn't go without 
                    telling me.

                                  FISHER
                    I think she's somewhere in the bay area.

                                  BUCK
                    I don't believe you.

                                  FISHER (indicating)
                    You're welcome to see for yourself.

                                  BUCK
                            (beat)
                    You did this. You made her go.

                                  FISHER
                    I thought it was in everyone's best 
                    interest yes.

                                  BUCK
                    You blackmailed her. Marilyn told me.

                                  FISHER
                    MS. HOUSTON'S relationship with you was at 
                    best, inappropriate.

                                  BUCK
                      Inappropriate - yeah! That's right! Any 
                      relationship with you terts is 
                      inappropriate.

                                  FISHER
                    Mr Francisco. I won't have that kind of 
                    language.                                  BUCK
                    Terts? You don't like the word terts? My 
                    mother and sister are dying because of you 
                    terts!

                                  FISHER
                    Mr Francisco, you are still under 
                      probation.

                                  BUCK
                    We could all be dead soon - what do I care 
                    about your probation!?

      He starts to walk off, comforting Vessna with CLICKS.

                                  FISHER
                    Mr Francisco - come back here and get your 
                      assignments!

      Ignoring him, Buck continues off.

                                  FISHER
                    Mr Francisco!

      Buck is gone.


      Entering Sikes moves to Zepeda at her desk. She throws up 
      her hands.

                                  ZEPEDA
                    Nothing but dead ends. Nobody's missing any 
                    Kentex - I've gone through Max's entire 
                    list of local companies.

      At that moment, Max approaches.

                                  ZEPEDA
                    Speak of the devil...

                                  MAX
                    What?                                  SIKES (turns on Max's 
                                    hearing aid)
                    When are you going to learn?

                                  MAX (handing Zepeda a paper)
                    Here are some out of state companies you 
                    can try.

                                  ZEPEDA (sighs)
                    It's gonna take some time.

                                  MAX (concerned)
                    How's George holding up?

                                  SIKES
                    'Bout like you'd expect.

                                  MAX
                    Give him my best.

      Sikes nods as Max exits. Weary, Sikes sits on the edge of 
      Zepeda's desk. Looking around, he realises there are no 
      Newcomers in the room. Zepeda notices him staring.

                                  ZEPEDA
                    I know - no Newcomers. It's wired.
                            (off Sikes look)
                    None of 'em came into work today. It's even 
                    in the papers.

      She hands Sikes a newspaper. One of the headlines reads: 
      NEWCOMERS EXPERIENCE MASS DEPRESSION. Next to it, another 
      reads: MALATHION SPRAYING TO RESUME. (PRODUCTION NOTE: Do 
      not feature this second headline.)

      Sikes puts the newspaper down.

                                  SIKES
                    You know, I never thought I'd get used to 
                    them. Remember when they made George my 
                    partner? I wanted to move to Alaska.
                            (pauses: thinking)
                    I'm still not used to them. I mean, let's 
                    face it - they're weird. But to think of 
                    life without them...
                            (looking at her)
                                  (MORE)                                  SIKES (CONT'D)
                    I can't Zep.

      After a beat, something catches Zepeda's attention. She 
      indicates over Sikes' shoulder.

                                  ZEPEDA
                    Sikes

      He turns

                                  HIS POV
                    George is entering the squad room, heading 
                    for his desk. The humans regard him 
                      curiously.

      Sikes turns, moving to greet him.

                                  GEORGE
                    There's nothing I can do at the hospital. 
                    Maybe here I can make a difference.

                                  SIKES
                    Sure. As long as you feel up to it.

                                  GEORGE
                    If you mean the "PAPAYELA", I will try to 
                    control myself.

                                  SIKES
                    Okay. We traced all the calls that went in 
                    and out of Parris' boat phone - nothing. 
                    There's one guy - Floyd Norall - Knew 
                    Parris - has a boat slip next to him. The 
                    harbour master confirmed Norell and his 
                    wife were out sailing the day Parris was 
                    killed - I thought I'd go talk to him.

      They look at one another, remembering their argument over 
      George's going to the Marina.

                                  SIKES
                    You, uh, want to come?


      Susan sleeps. George stands at the foot of Emily's bed with 
      Dr Quinn. Sikes stands a few feet behind them. They watch 
      as a nurse wraps her in a blue frosted plastic cover. Dr 
      Quinn glances up at:

      CLOSE - EMILY'S MONITOR

      The digital display shows her temperature rising from 106.6 
      to 106.7.

      RESUME SCENE

                                  QUINN
                    Her temperature still rising. I've given 
                    her injections of HO/LODKA. It hasn't 
                    helped. We're now putting an ice wrap on 
                    her.

      Emily MOANS, burning with fever.

                                  QUINN
                    Unless we can stabilise her temperature in 
                    the next twelve hours...
                            (looking at George)
                    We have a Celinist priestess here at the 
                    hospital. There are other chaplains as 
                    well...

                                  GEORGE
                    No, thank you.

      Quinn nods, exits. Sikes takes Dr Quinn's place at the foot 
      of the bed. He stares at Emily a moment, then turns to 
      George.                                  SIKES
                    George, I don't know how to say this, but 
                    the doctor has a point.
                            (off George's look)
                    I mean, a priest... for Emily. I know you 
                    have your own beliefs, but if she were my 
                    daughter, I'd want her baptised.

                                  GEORGE
                    So she can go to "heaven"?

                                  SIKES
                    Well, yeah.

                                  GEORGE
                    Thank you for thinking of her, Matt. But I 
                    don't believe in an after-life.

      Sikes is about to respond when George notices someone at 
      the hall window.

                                  GEORGE
                    Matt...

      Sikes turns.

      HIS POV - LORRAINE

      Holding cut flowers, stands in the hallway and looks 
      through the glass. She gestures, "Can I come in?" Sikes 
      gestures, "We'll come to you." George follows him just 
      outside the door.

                                  GEORGE
                    Hello, Lorraine.

                    Uh, look, I made the same mistake. I mean,

                    Lorraine, I appreciate your coming, but 
                    this isn't a good time for visitors. Matt, 
                    you haven't eaten all day. Why don't you

      Lorraine's flowers lie limply next to her on the table. She

      Sikes who is picking at a green salad.

      CAMERA PANS the room. Susan is asleep. Sikes is also asleep 
      in a chair. George keeps vigil by Emily's bed. He is awake, 
      but dazed. Emily is still wrapped in her ice pack.

      Her temperature hovers: 106.7, 106.6, 106.7, 106.6

      Sleeping fitfully. Suddenly, she stiffens, her jaw 
      clenching.

      Her temperature skyrockets: 106.7, 106.8, 106.9, 107. 
      Picking up speed, her temperature continues to increase 
      until it reaches 108, setting off an ALARM.

      GEORGE starts, looking up at the monitor.

      Sikes waking, rushes to Emily's bedside as a nurse and Dr 
      Quinn charge into the room.

      George looks curiously at his daughter. Finishing, Cathy         straightens.

                    I need to get this to my lab.

                    Bye, Emily.

      George follows Cathy out. Donning a double diaphragm 
      Newcomer stethoscope, Dr Quinn bends down to listen to 
      Emily's hearts.

      Albert motions toward Susan's room.

      THEIR POV THROUGH THE WINDOW - THE ROOM

      Dr Quinn and Cathy consult with George at Susan's bedsides. 
      Susan appears comatose. A rabbit snuggles at her feet.

      Turning his back toward Susan's room, Sikes leans in to

      Max Julian sits handcuffed at Sikes' desk. Sikes and George 
      stand over him. A uniformed cop waits to take Max to lock-

      Cathy injects George with her serum. Dr Quinn, Sikes,
