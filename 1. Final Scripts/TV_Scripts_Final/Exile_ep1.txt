    TOM RONSTADT - wild haired, thirties - sits alone in his *
      flashy London flat, he looks terrible.  He stares vacantly *
    at the muted TV screen.  Slowly, turns away and he looks *
      around his fancy pad - full expensive things.  *

    His face shows contempt.*

    We go closer and closer on TOM s face as he realises just *
    how screwed his life is.

      Silence.

      Then...  The LANDLINE STARTS TO RING.

    He doesn t move, just stares at it. It rings and rings and 
      rings...


      EXT.  UNDERGROUND CAR PARK -- DAY22

    TOM slamming a HOLDALL into the boot of his car.  TOM 
      jumping into the driver s seat.  Engine sparks.


      EXT. MOTORWAY -- DAY33

      That same car speeding towards and past camera.  As it does 
    so, we spin the shot to reveal a motorway sign.

    THE NORTH 


      INT. TOM S CAR -- DAY44

      TOM s face as he drives.  Emotionless.  He pushes a button 
    on the CD drive and music strikes out.

      Loud music, to eradicate the pain.  

      Hard cut to titles.

                                  EXILE


      EXT. SERVICE STATION -- DAY55

      Summer storm. 

      Rain hammering down, biblical, making a Northern SERVICE 
      STATION look even more bleak than usual.


      INT. SERVICE STATION -- DAY66

      Inside, we find TOM sitting in the plastic cafe drinking 
      coffee.  He is toying with his mobile. 

                                                                            (CONTINUED)              Exile  - episode one by Danny Brocklehurst      2.

      CONTINUED:66

    He looks around at all the people going about their lives.  
    We cut back to his face, lost, ashen, a man who s whole 
      life has fallen apart.  He looks down at his mobile, the 
      word HOME is highlighted, he is debating whether to call, 
    but can t bring himself to, and as he stares at those four 
      simple letters, we

                                                                  HARD CUT TO:*


      INT. BEHAVIOUR MAGAZINE -- DAY [FLASHBACK]77*

      TOM, looking terrible - hungover, high, wasted - doing the *
      walk of shame through the magazine office, all eyes are on *
    him - he isn tliked - as a SECURITY GUARD leads him from *
    the building.  Clearly sacked.*

                                  TOM*
                          (screams at the room)*
                    Screw you!*

    He tears down a LARGE MAGAZINE COVER POSTER.*

    The SECURITY GUARD grabs his arm up his back and escorts *
    him out, everyone watching.  And he looks like what he is, *
      a man who has lost the plot big time.*

    As he exits, TOM catches the eye of an attractive woman *
      across the room, JANE FINCH, hold a beat, she looks away. *

                                                                        BACK TO:*


88INT. SERVICE STATION TOILET -- DAY 

    TOM - on his knees - doing a line of coke off the closed 
      toilet lid.  This is no big deal, in fact, for him, it s 
      very much the norm.   He snorts back, better.


      EXT. SERVICE STATION -- DAY99

    TOM exits the service station and pulls up his collar 
      against the driving rain.  The weather matching his mood. 
    He trots back to his car, and dives inside.  

    He sits for a moment, lost, then stabs the key into the 
      ignition and starts the car.

    The WINDSCREEN WIPERS swish into action and we 

                                                                  HARD CUT TO:


      EXT. JANE S HOUSE -- NIGHT [FLASHBACK]1010*

    TOM drunk, a wreck- is hammering on the door of Jane s *
      house. Lights come on.  JANE open s door in night gown.*
                                                                            (CONTINUED)              Exile  - episode one by Danny Brocklehurst      3.

      stands there, full of self loathing.   *


      EXT. THE NORTH/TOM S CAR -- DAY1111*

    TOM driving along A roads.  Eyes just focused straight 
      ahead, almost trance-like, as if he is scared of where he 
    is going, what lies ahead of him...

      ...as we watch the landscape changing slightly.  We move 
      away from the densely urban and start to witness 
      countryside, greenery, small towns.

    TOM clocks a sign for BACUP.


      EXT. BACUP, LANCASHIRE/TOM S CAR -- NIGHT1212

      Bacup.

      TOM s car slides through the piss-wet streets.  As he 
      crawls slowly through the town centre he peers out of the 
    car window, trying to recognise the town he left behind all 
      those years ago.  He passes various shops, pubs, a park.  
      Plus a LARGE PROUD TOWN HALL BUILDING. 

    And his conclusion?

                                  TOM
                    Shithole.


      EXT. SAMUEL S HOUSE -- NIGHT1313

      TOM s car pulls up across the road from a large Victorian 
      House, probably worth a few bob.  But slightly tatty round 
    the edges these days.  Needs some TLC.

      Rain lashes down.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)              Exile  - episode one by Danny Brocklehurst      5.

    TOM stares, from the car window, at the house. And as we 
      stay with his gaze, we 

      FLASHBACK

    To a bright summer s day, early 90s, the day when a younger 
      TOM, rucksack over his shoulder, facial bruising and 
      healing cuts, slams out of the house, flicking Vsign. A *
      young woman,NANCY, comes to the door - upset.*

                                  NANCY*
                    Tom, Tom, not like this, please, 
                    don t leave like this -

    TOM doesn t break his stride.

                                  TOM
                    It s not you, it s him.

                                  NANCY*
                    He didn t mean it, please, talk 
                    to him.

                                  TOM 
                    I ll call you.

                                  NANCY*
                    Tom, Tom. 

    She watches him leave, her brother.  Distraught.*

    End flashback.

    And back to TOM, watching that old house, through the piss 
      rain.  He takes a deep breath.  Doesn t want to be here.  
    But the time has somehow come...


      EXT/INT.  SAMUEL S HOUSE -- NIGHT1414

    TOM ringing on the doorbell.  Long and insistent.  Until 
      eventually... it opens and there stands

      NANCY RONSTADT.  His older sister.  Think Clare Rushbrook, 
    but with a face that frowns more than it smiles. 

      Who, upon setting eyes on him, laughs.

                                  NANCY
                    Jesus, you must be in the shit.


      INT. SAMUEL S HOUSE -- NIGHT1515

    TOM is led through the house by NANCY (she s wearing 
      marigolds, clearly in the middle of something), he eyes it 
      like a museum, part of his past that has changed, but not 
      changed very much in his many manyyears of absence.
                                                                            (CONTINUED)              Exile  - episode one by Danny Brocklehurst      6.

                    Were you ever tempted to 
                    decorate?

                                  NANCY
                    I ve been busy.

      Said with pointed emphasis.  

    TOM can hear a loud male booming voice from somewhere in 
    the house. It stops him in his tracks.

                                  TOM
                    Where is he?

                                  NANCY
                    His study.

                    Who s he talking to?

                                  NANCY
                    Wendy.

    Off TOM s blank expression.

                                  NANCY (CONT'D)
                    His assistant.

      NANCY takes in the expression on TOM s face, the fear at 
      meeting his father again after all this time.

                                  NANCY (CONT'D)
                    Shall I tell him you re here? 

                                  TOM
                    Will he give a shit?


      INT. SAMUEL S HOUSE. KITCHEN -- NIGHT1616

    Now we see what NANCY was in the middle of - a mountain of 
      washing up, laundry and house chores.

      N.BSome of the kitchen cupboards have locks on them. *

      NANCY pours TOM a whisky.  He watches the small measure.  

                                  NANCY
                    They finally sacked you then?

                                  TOM
                    Yep.

                    in the post - there s only so 
                    long you can behave like a prick 
                    before people get tired of it.

    He smiles, loves his sister s unsentimental manner.  She 
      hands him the whisky.

                                  NANCY (CONT'D)
                    So what we talking? Flying visit? 
                    Hiding from the shitstorm? Or has 
                    your guilty conscience finally 
                    got the better of you - 

                                  TOM

                    You picked the right place then.

    He necks it in one gulp.  Hands the glass back to her.  

                                  TOM
                    Any chance of a drink this time.

    She eyes him with derision.

                    Occupational hazard. Or it was.

      NANCY just stares at him.

                    I m finished.

                    emotion -

    He crosses the kitchen and slowly, thoughtfully, refills 
    his own glass.  Hold the look between them.  There s a lot 
    of history in that one look.

                    you were off, being important...

      They stare at each other.

                                  TOM
                    You know why I left.

                                  NANCY
                    Yes, and you left mewith him.*

                    You could have gone.

                                  NANCY
                    What - and now suddenly you do.

                    Well, go on then, you know where 
                    he is, you d better go and talk
                    to him -

    She leaves.  TOM necks his drink with palpable fear.


      EXT. SAMUEL S HOUSE -- NIGHT1717

    TOM pads the stairs, nervously.  He walks along the 
      landing, where - ahead of him - he sees the door to the 
      study slightly open, he walks towards it.  Then stops.

    And we flashback, for the briefest moment to:

    THE MOST TERRIBLE BEATING.  GROWN MAN laying in with fists 
    as a TEENAGER huddles protectively on the floor.

    End flashback.

    TOM edges forward.  Very carefully, very quietly.   He 
      peers inside.

    The study is packed with FILES and BOOKS and BINDERS.

      SAMUEL RONSTADT - late 60s, a once large man now somewhat 
      reduced in physical presence, stands with his back to us, *
      rifling - in a flurry of activity - through various 
      BOXFILES and PADS and BINDERS.

    He mutters to himself, a stream of sentences which seem to 
      have a purpose but which don t go anywhere.  

    TOM watches from the doorway.  Hold on his face.  

                                  SAMUEL
                    ...where isit? Wendy? I m 
                    looking for the Sanderson! Why 
                    haven t... For heaven s sake, why 
                    can t we have a decent filing 
                    system in here.  Wendy? WENDY!   

    He turns around - as if looking for Wendy and comes face to 
      face with TOM.  SAMUEL stops dead in his tracks.

                                  SAMUEL (CONT'D)
                    Where s Wendy?

    TOM stares at his father - who is in the grip of 
      Alzheimer s - he looks physicallyokay but there s an 
      intensity to his facial expression.  

    TOM doesn t know what to say.

                                  TOM
                    She s gone.

                                  SAMUEL
                    Gone?  Gone where? Where s she *
                    gone?

    TOM is suddenly lost for words.
                                                                            (CONTINUED)              Exile  - episode one by Danny Brocklehurst      10.

                                  SAMUEL
                    Well, get her back.

      SAMUEL turns and starts faffing through the files again, 
      repeating exactlywhat he was doing before.

    TOM stares for a long time, then, croaks.

                                  TOM
                    Dad.

      SAMUEL ignores him.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                          (louder)
                    Dad.

      Still nothing.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    Dad, it s Tom. Your son, Tom.

      Suddenly SAMUEL stops, turns and smiles.

                                  SAMUEL
                    Tom?  Tom?TOM!

    And bizarrely, SAMUEL bounds over to him and throws his 
      arms around him.  Hugs him tightly.

                                  SAMUEL (CONT'D)
                    Good to see you, greatto see you 
                    Tom. Thanks so much for coming. 
                    How was your journey?

                                  TOM
                          (confused)
                    Fine, yeh, no problem.

      They come out of the hug.

                                  SAMUEL
                    Where s Wendy?

                                  TOM

                    Wendy!  WENDY.

      SAMUEL goes off shouting her again.  TOM can see that his 
      father has no idea who he is right now.  TOM turns to find 
      NANCY standing in the doorway, they lock eyes.


      INT. SAMUEL S HOUSE. TOM S OLD ROOM -- NIGHT1818

    TOM and NANCY head towards Tom s old room carrying pillows 
    and freshly laundered bedding.

                                  TOM
                    You didn t tell me he had 
                    imaginary friends -

                                  NANCY 
                          (regards him with 
                            irritation)
                    I stopped telling you anything, 
                    because I could tell you weren t 
                      interested.  

      They enter the room.

      NANCY - almost by force of habit - starts making his bed. 
    TOM takes in his old bedroom.

                                  NANCY (CONT'D)
                    This last couple of years he s 
                    gone downhill fast - memory, co-
                      ordination, it s like he s not 
                    really himanymore.

                                  TOM

                                  NANCY

                                  TOM
                    In here. It s the same wallpaper.
                    What s happened to my posters?

                    woman on the internet if you re 
                    really that desperate -

      NANCY just continues what she s doing.  TOM looks around 
    the bare room that was his bedroom for so long -

                                  TOM
                    She was his secretary right -

                    Wendy? Fifteen years. When he was 
                    deputy on the Evening News.

                                  TOM
                    And where is she now?

                                  NANCY
                    No one knows.  One day she just 
                    quit, walked out.

                                  TOM 
                    Hardly surprising. Waiting on his 
                    every whim.

                                  NANCY
                    Not so much as a Christmas card.  
                    Fifteen years running his life, 
                    then goes completely off radar.  

    TOM puzzling on that, seems very strange. NANCY dumps the 
      duvet cover with attitude, makes to leave.

                    That isa good day.

    She leaves.  We stay with TOM.  All this is far too much 
      like real life for him.  He s terrified.


      INT. SAMUEL S HOUSE. TOM S OLD ROOM -- NIGHT1919

    TOM lying in bed, awake, smoking.  Thinking.  This empty 
      room that was once his childhood bedroom.


      INT. SAMUEL S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT2020

      TOM, in boxers and T-shirt, pads into the living room.  He 
      eyes the dated decor, glances at the photos which adorn the 
      wall.  Finds one of his father and his MOTHER.  They are 
      smiling, to all intents and purposes a happy couple.

    TOM goes close, examines her face. The mother he adored.


      INT. SAMUEL S HOUSE. LANDING -- NIGHT2121

    TOM pads along the landing and stops at the door of 


      SAM S OFFICE2222

      There s trepidation. This office means something.  And we 
      flashback to:

      Twenty years ago.  Younger TOM (17) standing hidden on the 
      landing outside his father s office. Voices are raised 
      inside - we don t hear exactly what - a man and a woman 
      yelling at each other...  Then suddenly the woman - WENDY, 
    his secretary, late 30s, plain - comes storming out, TOM 
      affects nonchalance and she strides past and away.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)              Exile  - episode one by Danny Brocklehurst      14.

      CONTINUED:2222

    TOM passes the office door, which is ajar, and sees his 
      father sliding a LARGE FILE back into a high shelf.

    End flash.

    TOM stares at that same office door, he reaches for the 
      handle and slowly, perhaps nervously, enters.  It s dark, 
      illuminated only by street light.  He stands in the 
      doorway, just staring at the shelves.

    He flicks the light on.

    He eyes the rows and rows of FILES AND PAPERS.

      Flashback: Different night. Younger TOM creeps into the 
      study, starts looking around at things.

      TOM s face as he remembers this past event.  It s a painful 
      memory and cuts like an old wound.

      Flashback: YOUNGER TOM starts opening up a file.  Delving 
      through.  Then... he finds something.

      PHOTOGRAPHY NEGATIVES.

      There s a name written on the negatives in bold lettering: 

      METZLER.

      They fall to the floor and TOM reach down to pick them up, 
    but as he does so he drops the file and the entire contents 
      skid out.  Shit!  As he swoops to collect them he hears a 
      noise, looks up, scared - 

                                  SAMUEL (IN FLASHBACK)
                    What the fuckd  you think you re

                    Who s Metzler?

    And we hard cut to

    TOM switching out the light.  Slamming the door closed. WE 
      stay on TOM s face.  Memory still haunts him.


      INT. SAMUEL S HOUSE. LANDING -- NIGHT2323

    TOM - fully clothed - heads for the front door, escaping, 
    he peeps it open, and as quietly as he can, leaves.

      EXT. SERVICE STATION -- NIGHT2626

      Deserted service station. TOM exits with a coffee and

                    where he spits his tablets down 
                    the toilet and I have to fish 
                    them out by hand. Or how about 
                    the incontinence days or the days 
                    where he stays in bed and refuses 
                    to move. Then there s the mood 
                    swings days, the aggression days, 
                    the hallucinations, the 
                      uncontrollable tears and the way 
                    that sometimes you get glimpses, 
                    just glimpsesof the old dad and 
                    then it s gone in an instant... 

      TOM s face, makes a decision.

      hand, looking bewildered at the garden.

                                  TOM
                    Dad... Dad...

    He realises his father is shaking.  As he reaches him, TOM 
      sees the total confusion on his father s face.

                                  SAMUEL
                    Where s it gone?

                    It was on your mum s house. The 
                    conservatory was on gran s house.

      More confusion.  SAMUEL looks at the chisel in his hand and 
      suddenly throws it full tilt at the imaginary conservatory.  
    It SMASHES through the back window.

    TOM exhales, startled by the violence of this outburst.


      INT. SAMUEL S HOUSE -- NIGHT4242

      SAMUEL plays the piano, his fingers move across the keys 
      with grace. Of all the things he can tdo anymore, this is 
    one he can- he plays beautifully.

    TOM stands close, watches, examining the father he no 
      longer recognises.


      INT. SAMUEL S HOUSE. KITCHEN -- NIGHT4343*

    TOM trying to cook, burning things.  He s hopeless at this *
    and his task isn t helped by the combination locks on all *
    the kitchen cupboards.  He despairs...*


      INT. SAMUEL S HOUSE. DINING ROOM-- NIGHT4444*

    TOM and SAMUEL eat bought in pizza.  SAMUEL eyes his son 
      suspiciously throughout.  Eventually...

                                  SAMUEL
                    Isn t it time you cut your hair!


      INT. SAMUEL S HOUSE -- NIGHT4545

    TOM trying to get SAMUEL into bed. There s an unholy 
      struggle and the two of them almost end up on the floor.

                                  TOM
                    Lie down, liedown.

      SAMUEL springs to his feet.

                    It s bedtime.  Dad!

      More struggle.  SAMUEL blows raspberries.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    Nancy says you go to bed at ten,

      More detail of the flashback we saw earlier...

      SAMUEL - twenty years ago - laying into a cowering 18 year 
    old TOM.  He hits and hits and hits.  Horrific violence.

    End flashback.

      They are still staring at each other.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    Nothing changes.

    TOM makes to leave.

                                  SAMUEL
                    I want Nancy!

                                  TOM
                    Don t we all!

      SAMUEL follows TOM out and yells -

                                  SAMUEL
                    You useless little shit!

    TOM bounds back with an aggression that seems like he could 
      murder his father. SAMUEL retreats, but TOM grabs him and 
    in one movement, pins him to the bed.

                                  TOM
                    Meuseless. You re the one who

                    You selfisholdtwat.

    TOM suddenly stops as he sees the terrified face of his 
      father beneath him.  He flees the room.


      INT. SAMUEL S HOUSE -- NIGHT4646

    TOM kicking the landing wall in sheer frustration.  He 
      slumps to the floor, spent.  From his position on the floor 
    he can see the slightly open door of 

      SAMUEL S OFFICE

      TOM, as a teenager, peering through the crack in the 
      slightly open door, fascinated/concerned by what he sees:

      REVERSE ANGLE: SAMUEL looking through a FILE, his face 
      starting to buckle and contort.  The contents of the file 
      clearly very upsetting.  He suddenly slams it closed.

    TOM scarperswithout being seen.  End flashback.

      TOM, still sitting on the floor, reacts to the memory of 
    his father s tears.  It s a disturbing image.


      INT. SAMUEL S HOUSE. SAM S ROOM -- NIGHT4747

      SAMUEL, asleep now, passed out, exhausted.  We find TOM 
      staring at him.  Just looking at his father.

    The man that gave life to him.  The man that hurt him.  And 
    now - almost a stranger.


      EXT. SAMUEL S HOUSE -- NIGHT4848

    TOM exits the house, closes the door and heads off down the 
      street, escapingagain. 

    But this time, by foot, locally.


      EXT. BACUP -- NIGHT4949

    TOM walks the streets of the town he grew up in.  It s no 
      longer a place he recognises.  The place - which once had 
    an elegance - is now shuttered down, grey and lifeless.  
    The only signs of life are chippies and pubs. Youths hang 
      around in clusters, all white, all aimless. 

      TOM, couldn t care less, he walks through the middle of a 
      small group of testosterone filled lads.  

                                  TOM
                    Excuse me.

                    Puff.

    TOM just smiles.  He walks on, then stops, turns.

                                  TOM
                    Oy!  Reprobates. 

      They all stare at him, eyes that could kill.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                          (big bold, couldn t give

                    round here, do you?


      EXT. BACUP. ALLEY -- NIGHT5050

      Seedy transaction.

    TOM digging a TWENTY out of his wallet  He offers the money 
    to the DEALER YOUTH, who hands him a bag of coke.

    But as TOM goes to take it, DEALER YOUTH punches him in the 
      stomach and legs it with the coke andthe cash.

    TOM bent double in pain, yells -

                                  TOM
                    What s this - rehab!


      EXT/INT. THE FRIENDSHIP -- NIGHT5151

    The Friendship pub.  TOM still in pain, enters.  As he does 
    so, he encounters TWO MEN YELLING INTO EACH OTHER S FACES.  
      They re seconds from extreme violence. 

    TOM sidesteps them, with a wry look.  He enters.

    TOM heads to the bar.   He looks round the place.  It s 
      clearly changed a lot since he was last here.

    But it s still a dump.

      It s the antithesis of the kind of London drinkerys TOM has 
    got used to. A few locals cast him vague  recognition  
      looks, but none really care that much. 

    TOM eyes the arse of the thirtysomething ginger barmaid, 
      MANDY, as she refills the bottle coolers. She s seen better 
      days but she is still in good shape.

    As she rises, she clocks him looking.

                                  TOM 
                    Pint of lager, whisky chaser.

                          smile)
                    And whatever you re having.

    She gives him a tight smile.  Starts pulling the pint.  TOM 
      looks around, and by way of conversation...

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    Busy for a Thursday.

    She just stares at him.

                            cheapness)
                    No wonder the place is full.

    As TOM delves in his wallet for a note, she eyes him 
      carefully, as if mentally assessing something.

    TOM feeding coins into the jukebox.  He flips through the 
      various albums as the BARMAID sweeps past collecting 
      glasses.  She stares at him, until he turns to face her.

    TOM sneaking out of the bedroom. As he does so he notices 
    the door to a child s bedroom ajar.  Curiosity gets the 
      better of him, he peers inside.

      There s a BUNKBED with a child - maybe eight - in the top 
      bunk and an older child - twelve - in the bottom.

    He stares at them a beat.  Then leaves.

      INT. SAMUEL S HOUSE -- DAY5656

    TOM sits talking to SAMUEL as he silently shovels cereal 
      into his mouth, joylessly eating.

                                  TOM
                    And why I needed to see you 
                    again... 

    TOM stares at his father, who isn t listening.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    It feels like youcaused all this 
                    mess.  Like in some weird, 
                    twisted way, you made all this 
                    happen.  So I d end up back here,  
                      sittingwith you, staringat you -
                          (heavy pause)
                    - if I can understand why you
                    were such a screw up, maybe I can 
                    understand why Iam.

      SAMUEL stops chewing, has that insult penetrated his skull?  
    No, he opens his mouth and spits the cereal out.

      INT. SAMUEL S HOUSE -- NIGHT6060

      PHOTO ALBUM - snapshots of the past.  We focus on one 
      particular image - SAMUEL, his wife Edith, and a younger 
    TOM and NANCY all huddled together on a hillside posing.

      SAMUEL sits in bed, TOM beside him.  He taps the image.

                                  TOM
                    Remember that holiday?

      Nothing from Sam.

                    Abersoch. We stayed in that posh 
                    hotel, what was it called?

      Nothing from Sam.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    It s the holiday that always 
                    stays with me, probably rose 
                    tinted but it feels like we were 
                      actually...

    TOM searches for the right word.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                          (it chokes him a bit)
                    Happy.  

      Nothing from Sam.

                    No rows, no tension.  None of 
                    your outbursts.

      Silence.

                    What changed, dad? We were happy? 
                    Weren t we? Then it all fell *
                    apart...

      TOM s pushing it here, trying to get a reaction.  He fails.

      SAMUEL slowly nods, thoughtful. TOM looks back at the faces 
      before him, a lost innocence.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)

                    The hotel. Terrible service. And 
                    they had a bloody great peacock 
                    in the beer garden...

    TOM looks at his father, affected by this bizarre 
      fragmentation of his memory banks.

    He peers round, seeing if lardy bloke has gone, he hasn t.

      YOUNG SPOTTY SHOP ASSISTANT appears next to trolley, stares

                                  MIKE
                    You should.  It s a laugh.  And  
                    Twitter, I m into it all, me. 
                    Just for fun, I m not a geek. 
                    Well, maybe... a bit.

      They smile at each other.

                                  TOM
                    So... how s life?

                                  MIKE 
                    Great, great. Bit softer round 
                    the middle, too many nice 
                    dinners, but otherwise good.  
                    You ve kept yourself trim -

                                  TOM
                    Spend a lot of time running away 
                    from people.

      MIKE laughs.

                                  MIKE
                    Married?

                                  TOM
                    Does it look like it. You?

                                  MIKE
                    Guilty, couple of kiddies.

                                  TOM 
                    Great, who s the lucky woman?

                                  MIKE

                    Mandy Craven.  Well, Eldridge now 
                    of course.

                                  TOM
                    Wow.  Well done.

                    You remember her?

                                  TOM
                    Yeh, a bit, I had her sister.

                    Lucky bastard.

      They laugh.

                                  MIKE (CONT'D)
                    She s in Hartlepool now.

                                  TOM
                    Really?

                                  MIKE
                    Well, someone has to.

      They laugh again.  Small awkward pause.

                                  MIKE (CONT'D)
                    We should have a drink.

                                  TOM
                      Definitely.

                                  MIKE
                    No, Tom, not like that - not 
                    someday, maybe, never.  We should 
                    have a drink - proper catch up.    

    TOM nods, thinking  how can I get out of this? 

                                  MIKE (CONT'D)
                    What you doing tonight?


      INT. THE FRIENDSHIP -- NIGHT6464

    TOM and MIKE - a few drinks in - are back in the 
      Friendship. In the b/g MANDY is serving behind the bar.

                                  MIKE
                    ...assistant to the Chief 
                    Executive. His deputy in all but 
                    title - rose up from planning - 
                    he confides in me, asks my 
                    opinion, last year he took me on 
                    an all expenses paid trip to 
                    Barcelona - first class travel, 
                    five star hotel, the works. 

                                  TOM
                    Sounds like you re doing well for 
                    yourself.
                                                                            (CONTINUED)              Exile  - episode one by Danny Brocklehurst      39.

                                  MIKE
                    Can t complain.  

    But we should sense that this is all bravado, he s a man 
    who is deeply disappointedwith his life.

    TOM glances across at MANDY serving.

                                  TOM 
                    Same again?

      MIKE waggles his long slim glass. 

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                          (slightly amused)
                    White wine Spritzer?

                                  MIKE
                    I m on the slim fast.  If I drink 
                    beer I ll be starving.

    TOM heads to the bar.  Where he stands next to an old bloke 
      watching QVC on the mute TV. 

                                  TOM 
                    Enjoying that?

                                  OLD BLOKE
                    It s just on, innit.

    TOM despairs. MANDY appears. He proffers a big open smile.

                                  TOM 
                    Lager for me and a spritzer for 
                    the lady.

                                  MANDY 
                          (speaks sotto)
                    Look, he works away -

                                  TOM
                    I don t need the justification. 
                    You wanted it, you got it.

                                  MANDY 
                          (attack being best form 
                          of defense)
                    Think hedoesn t do stuff on his 
                    trips abroad-

                                  TOM
                    I m not your marriage councillor.

    TOM looks across at MIKE who drinks and contemplates.

                                  MANDY 
                    You re not gonna tell him, are

                                  TOM
                    Do I look insane? 

    He looks at her, there s a secret smile between them.  
      Actually some proper attraction here, which surprises TOM.

                                  MANDY
                    It s crap between us. Together 
                    for the kids cliche cliche.I 
                    just wanted to be someone else 
                    for a night -

    TOM nods, gets that.  As she places the pints down, she 
      surreptitiously strokes his hand. 

                                  MANDY (CONT'D)
                    Five eighty.

    TOM secretly returns the finger stroke, then glances at the 
    OLD BLOKE who has seen this.  He motions to him,  nose .

    TOM and MANDY laugh.  MIKE is completely oblivious.


      EXT. BACUP TOWN CENTRE -- NIGHT6565

      Post-pub.  TOM and MIKE walk the streets with chips.

                                  MIKE 
                          (stuffing his fat face)
                    Funny where life leads you isn t 
                    it, paths you take, choices you 
                    make - I d say we were equals at 
                    school, intelligence wise, grades 
                    an all that, wouldn t you -

                                  TOM
                    In your dreams.

      They laugh.

                                  MIKE
                    And yet you became the high 
                    flyer, off to London, making a 
                    fortune - 
                          (a real bitterness 
                            emerging now)
                    - women, cash, the odd line of 
                    snort I wouldn t be surprised...

    TOM is non-committal.

                                  MIKE (CONT'D)
                    And what did I do, stayed in this 
                    place, settled down - 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)              Exile  - episode one by Danny Brocklehurst      41.

                    You ve got a wife and kids, 
                    steady job -

                                  MIKE
                    I took the sensible path -

                                  TOM
                    Don t knock it. The high life s 
                    not all it s cracked up to be - 

      They eat and walk a moment.

                                  MIKE
                    Can I tell you something?

                                  TOM
                    Unless it involves cross 
                    dressing.

                                  MIKE
                    I was jealous of you...

    He lets that hang a moment, then follows up with -

                                  MIKE (CONT'D)
                    ...every time I saw your name on 
                    a byline, I d think, that could 
                    have been me - I could have been 
                    doing that, and I hated you for 
                    it.  Because life s not about 
                    talent, it s about chutzpah, it s 
                    about being the one to get off 
                    his fat arse and go and make 
                    something of himself.  And you 
                    did, and I stayed here.

                                  TOM
                    But now I m back. Tail between 
                    legs.  Nowhere else to go.  So 
                    who s the bigger screw up?*

    TOM ditches his chip wrappings.  Silence falls.

                                  MIKE
                    Sorry about your dad.

                                  TOM
                    Yeh, well, life sucks.

                                  MIKE
                    It s a terrible disease.  

      They watch a BLOKE ON CRUTCHES try to do a runner from the 
      chippy, he pursued by THE OWNER.   



                                                                            (CONTINUED)              Exile  - episode one by Danny Brocklehurst      42.

                    Things changed.  Home was awful. 
                    He went moody, uncommunicative.  
                    We d walk on eggshells in case he 
                    exploded.  Youwouldn t see it, 
                    because the world got the other 
                    Sam - the one with the wit and

    TOM and MIKE sit on the same couch where Tom got off with

                    ...he was always possessive of

                     cause I wanted to be like him, I *
                    started to wonder what sort of 
                    juice he kept in there... 

      Flashback to the scene we saw earlier:  Younger TOM creeps 
      into the study, starts looking around at things.

                                  TOM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    One night, after a few toots, I 
                    just thought  fuck it , went in, 
                    started nosing around... most of 
                    it was pretty dull to be honest, 
                    Lancashire news, bits of county 
                    court stuff,  but then I came

      YOUNGER TOM starts opening the file.

                    There was something about it, the 
                    way it was positioned, the way it 
                    had three elastic bands wrapped 
                    round it... it was enticing. 

      YOUNGER TOM s face drops, perplexed.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    Inside there was reams of paper, 
                    printouts, research, all kinds of 
                    guff, too much to get through. 
                    I d just started skim reading it 
                    when these negatives fall out -

    In flashback we see the PHOTOGRAPHY NEGATIVES fall to the 
      floor and TOM reach down to pick them up, but as he does so 
    he drops the file and the contents skid out. 

                                  TOM (IN FLASHBACK) (CONT'D)
                    Shit.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    I lean down to get them and the 
                    whole file goes over. So there I 
                    am clearing it up when suddenly 
                    there s this noise behind me.  I 
                    turn around and there he is.

      SAMUEL stares down at the YOUNGER TOM.

                    I ll remember it for the rest of 
                    my life, he charges over, fists 
                    already clenched and yells -

                    What the fuckd  you think you re

                                  TOM
                    I had no answer. Not even a 
                    feeble lie... 

    TOM looks up terrified, manages to squeak the words.

                                  TOM (IN FLASHBACK) (CONT'D)
                    Who s Metzler?

                    And that s when he lost it. 

    The Savage Beating.  Fists and feet, anger and screams.

      Then stop.  Back on TOM s face, still pained by the memory. 

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    It was like something snapped...

                    What do you think was in there?
                    What didn t he want you to see?

    TOM can t answer.  They stare at each other.

                    again. That fuckingstudy, 
                    cowering. And I wanna ask him - 
                    why, what was it... but the guy 
                    can t even put his shoes on the 
                    right feet - 

    TOM drinks, nursing real internal pain.

                    the negatives?

                    All I can remember is this 
                    name... scrawled in the corner 
                    with Tipp Exe. Metzler.

      Flashback to TOM looking at the name written on the 
      negatives in bold lettering METZLER.

                    Only person it links to is Donald

      INT. SAMUEL S HOUSE. STUDY -- NIGHT6767*

    TOM sitting in the semi darkness of the study where it all 
      happened.  More whisky on the go.  He takes in the room, 
      contemplative. Dark thoughts swirling. 

      Jump cutsas he looks around the office.  PHOTOS from the 
      past of his dad - the working journalist. Papers and 
      cuttings still litter the surfaces.  Letters and 
      correspondence.  Bills and invoices.

      TOM s eyes scanning.  Trying to work out who his father is, 
    the genial hard working man of newspapers or the violent 
      psycho who attacked him unprovoked. 

    He finds his hand trying the DESK DRAWER before him. It s 
      locked.  He pulls at it and feels it wobble.  All his anger 
    and frustration comes out on that drawer as he pulls and 
      smashes and pulls until...    

      PING.  Out it flips, spilling the contents onto the floor.

    TOM sits on the floor now, surrounded by the contents - a 
    sea of ageing paper awash around him.

    He examines something carefully.

    On TOM s face.  Thinking.  Questioning.  Bemused.

    We then see what he is looking at - it s an old BANK 
      STATEMENT, from years ago - 1980s.

    His eyes scan down the PAYMENTS IN column.There are *
      regular payments from J CLEEVE.*

    TOM knows this is significant.


      INT. SAMUEL S HOUSE. NANCY S ROOM -- NIGHT6868

    TOM gently shaking NANCY awake.  She s snatched from deep 
      sleep.

                                  NANCY
                    What!


      INT. SAMUEL S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT6969

    TOM hands NANCY - now in dressing gown - a drink.  She is 
      examining the bank statements.  A pile of them.

                                  NANCY
                    How do we know this money s still

                    For who, Tom?  Or do you see this 
                    as some kind of inheritance.

      Suddenly the door burstsopen and SAMUEL is stood there in 
    his pyjamas. TOM jumps put of his skin.

      NANCY laughs.  In fact, howls.

      SAMUEL moves slowly towards them.

                                  NANCY 
                    He s sleepwalking. Come on, you 
                    can help me get him upstairs.  


      INT. SOLICITOR S OFFICE -- DAY7070

      Solicitor s office.  TOM and NANCY sit with SAMUEL opposite 
    an OLD SCHOOL SOLICITOR.  He peruses paperwork.

                                  NANCY
                    Doctor s letter confirms his 
                    condition and there s a report 
                    from the respite unit outlining 
                    the care they ve been providing.

                                  SOLICITOR
                    Yes, I can read.

      NANCY looks as though she could deck the smarmy get. TOM 
      gives her a calming gesture.  

      SAMUEL, in suit and tie, is on best behaviour.

                                  SOLICITOR (CONT'D)
                    My problem, and it s a very real 
                    problem, in legal terms, is that 
                    your father sits before me, 
                    appearing, to all intents and 
                    purposes, like a man very much in 
                    charge of his faculties.

      Solicitor smiles at SAMUEL, who smiles back.

    TOM could kill him.

                                  TOM
                    He has good days and bad days.

      Solicitor smiles again at SAMUEL. He smiles back.

      Simple as that.  TOM and NANCY are furious. Solicitor gives

      INT. SOLICITOR S OFFICE -- DAY7171

      TOM, NANCY and SAMUEL walk away in silence.  TOM and NANCY 
      still have enraged faces.  Suddenly SAMUEL stops dead and 
      calm as you like, starts undoing his trousers.

                    I ll take that as a yes. 

    TOM smiles.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    What about United winning the 
                    treble?

      SAMUEL turns to him, blank.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    Dementia s not all bad then.

      NANCY starts heading over with ice creams.  TOM tries one 
      more question -

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    Do you remember mum? You remember 
                    Edith, before she died?

                                  SAMUEL
                          (turns in panic)
                    Edith s died?  

                                  TOM
                          (calming tone)
                    It s okay, she died years ago.

                                  SAMUEL
                    Edith s died?  

                                  TOM
                    Dad, she was ill, you looked 
                    after her - 

                                  SAMUEL
                    Edith s died.

      NANCY arrives back to see the scene before her.

      SAMUEL starts sobbing with upset.  NANCY embraces him and 
      makes calming noises.  She shoots TOM a reprimanding look -


      INT. SAMUEL S HOUSE. NANCY S ROOM -- NIGHT7373

      NANCY is getting dressed up for a night out.  TOM standing 
      close by, assessing her outfit as she talks.

                    His mind jumps about, past and

      INT. SAMUEL S HOUSE. LANDING/LOFT -- NIGHT7474

    TOM erects a step ladder on the landing, he climbs up and 
      pushes back the loft hole.  With a FLASHLIGHT he peers into 
    the darkness of the loft.  It s dusty and mucky in there - 
    and piled with years and years of stuff.

      Carved into one of the beams are the words TOM 4 SARAH 4 
      EVER.  TOM smiles at them.

                                  TOM
                    Sarah, babe, what happened?

    He starts to flash the light on to various items - an old 
      rocking horse, dozens of binliners containing bedding and 
    so on, old appliances, three large piles of fading 
      newspapers and so on. 

      Until... eventually his flashlight falls on to an old 1980s 
      style suitcase, it has a combination lock.

    TOM awkwardly manoeuvres over to it.  Lodging the 
      flashlight under his chin he opens it.

      Inside is various stuff, including - A PORTABLE CASSETTE 
      PLAYER, single speaker.  And next to it there s a LONG THIN 
      CASSETTE CASE in bright blue, small black metal handle.

    He grabs them and descends.              Exile  - episode one by Danny Brocklehurst      54.


      INT. SAMUEL S HOUSE. TOM S ROOM -- NIGHT7575

    TOM - amused by nostalgia - glances through the old C90 
      cassette s - compilations he made when he was younger.  
      They look like antiquated museum pieces now.

    He chooses one - entitled TOTALLY FAB CHART HITS - and 
      slides it into the player.  

      Level 42 blast out.

                                  TOM
                    So not totallyfab.


      INT. SAMUEL S HOUSE -- NIGHT7676

    TOM sitting with SAMUEL.  The portable cassette player is 
      playing music from the early  90s.  TOM has a very intense 
      look on his face as he chooses his words carefully.

                                  TOM
                    How s work? Is the editor still

      They laugh.

                    Do you think you d ever fancy 
                    being editor - or do you prefer

                    But... do you never get tired of 
                    digging, it must get hard - it 
                    must be stressful, all that

      Hold the look between them.  Suddenly the music abruptly 
      stops in that way cassette s do - the music has been taped  
      over something - voices.  A heated phone conversation.

    he feverishly pulls at the thin black tape.

    He sinks to the floor, still clutching the semi unravelled 
      tape.  He kicks out, then punches the sofa with both hands -

      SAMUEL looks at him like he might actually start to give

                    Go to hell!

      SAMUEL scrambles out of the room. Leaving TOM to slowly 
      exhale; shaken, startled and more curious than before.              Exile  - episode one by Danny Brocklehurst      56.

    TOM carefully winding the tape back inside the cassette 
      with a pencil. 

    TOM finding a set of headphones.

    TOM placing the cassette back into the player.  

    TOM listening to the tape.  Music.  Then voices.  We just 
      catch glimpses of the phone conversation.

      TOM s face as he gets to a part that amazes him.  He 
      presses STOP.  Then REWIND. Then STOP.  Then PLAY. 

    And now we hear what he has just heard:

      Crackle on the tape.  Voices distorted.   And TOM realises

    is now in pretty bad state.  TOM stares at the tape.

    He notices something.  The sticker saying  Totally fab 
      tunes  is one he placed over the original tape.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)              Exile  - episode one by Danny Brocklehurst      57.

      Slowly, carefully, he starts to peel off the white sticker 
    he placed there many years before. The strip peels off and 
      written underneath, in biro, on the original tape, is the 
      word METZLER.   

      Hold on TOM s face.

      DOORBELL rings. TOM jumps up and heads

      DOWNSTAIRS. He swings the door open to find MIKE standing 
      there.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    Mike, that s weird, I was just 
                    about to -

      Whack! 

      MIKE punches him in the face. TOM flies backwards.

                                  MIKE
                    Bastard! You fucked her in my
                    house. In mybed!

                                  TOM
                    I didn t know! I swear!

      MIKE goes in for another punch but TOM, nursing his bust 
      nose, dodges him.  MIKE hits the wall.  It hurts.

      MIKE curses, winces with pain.

                                  MIKE
                          (shaking with anger)
                    You deserve everything you get! 
                    You useless...washed up...prick! 

                                  TOM
                    I m sorry! Mike, Mike...

      MIKE stomps away, clutching his bust hand.  TOM - blood 
      dripping from his nose - chases after him.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    Mike, mate... 

                                  MIKE
                          (with real venom)
                    Stay out of my life!

      MIKE just carries on walking, appalled. TOM watches him go.  
      Disappointed in himself.


      INT. SAMUEL S HOUSE. KITCHEN -- NIGHT7878

    TOM pours himself a modest measure of whisky, he stares at 
    it as he contemplates what he s about to do.
                                                                            (CONTINUED)              Exile  - episode one by Danny Brocklehurst      58.

      Then downs it in one.


      INT. SAMUEL S HOUSE. BATHROOM -- NIGHT7979

    TOM walks along the upstairs corridor.  Ahead he sees the 
      toilet door ajar.  Geared up now, he can t back out, he has 
    to do the thing he has wanted to do for so many years -

    TOM goes to the door, opens it.

      SAMUEL is sitting on the toilet.  

    TOM stares at the side of his father s head for a long 
      time, before eventually uttering -

                                  TOM
                    Why did you beat me? 
                          (Silence)
                    Look at me.
                          (Silence)
                    That night, why did you react 
                    that way -
                          (Silence)
                    Dad, lookat me - LOOK AT ME.

      SAMUEL slowly turns.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    Who were you protecting?

      SAMUEL says nothing.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    Because... to do what you did, it 
                    must have been something so 
                    big... something...
                          (his voice cracks)
                    ...that utterly terrified you -

      SAMUEL says nothing. 

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    I know it s still in there.

    TOM taps his head.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    And believe me, I m gonna get it 
                    out -  

      SAMUEL smirks, looks directly at TOM with utter contempt, 
      then kicks the door closed. 

    TOM stands, door closed in his face.  He takes a deep 
      breath and slowly walks away.
