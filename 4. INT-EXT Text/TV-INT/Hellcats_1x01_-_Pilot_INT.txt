      MUSIC CONTINUES.  PAN ALONG an ego wall:  Framed photos, 
      plaques and ribbons of Marty in her younger days as an award-
      winning gymnast.  Marty on the balance beam, Marty on the 
      uneven parallel bars.  Nothing recent though.      

      FIND MARTY, curled up on the sofa, bobbing her head to music 
    as she studies.  The decor cues us that this isn t a dorm or 
    any type of student housing.  Marty lives here with her 
      single mom whom we ll meet shortly.  Marty eats leftover take-
    out and highlights passages in a Pre-Law textbook.            "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           6.


    She shuts the book, her brain full.  She carries the takeout 
      container to the kitchen and dumps it, still grooving to the 
      music.  She s got some fierce moves for a skinny white girl.  

    She notes the unopened mail.  Bills.  Marty picks up her 
      mom s checkbook.  Time to deal with life.  

      TIME CUT.  Marty pays bills, carefully noting the balance in 
    the checkbook ledger.  She opens an envelope from the 
      University.  She reads the contents.  Her face falls.

                                  MARTY
                    No.  No!  

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:



    A place where students hang out.  School store, game room, 
      lounge and the campus pub.  Marty heads downstairs to...



    A rathskeller type snack bar that serves food and drinks.  
      Marty s mother WANDA tends bar.  Wanda is a party girl who 
      never quite grew up.  Marty s the parent in the relationship.

                                  MARTY
                    Mom, what is this?

      Marty slams down the notice.

                                  WANDA
                    Oh.  You weren t supposed to see 
                    that.  They send those to scare you 
                    into paying.  Are you hungry?

                                  MARTY
                    It says my scholarship was 
                    cancelled.  Last semester!

                                  MARTY
                    Fringe?  My scholarship is not 
                    fringe!  It is central to my life.

                                  WANDA
                    It ll be fine.  The union says they 
                    can t pull scholarships from 
                    enrolled students. 

                                  MARTY
                    But they did!  

                                  WANDA
                    Yes, but they can t.  

                                  MARTY
                    But they did!

                                  WANDA
                    See, they can t.  The union is 
                    taking them to court and

                                  WANDA
                    You re the one studying law.  Why 
                    not ask one of your professors?

      Marty swallows her exasperation.  Deep breath.

                                  MARTY
                    This bill is three months past due.  
                    I ve got a week to pay or I m 
                    barred from classes.  

                                  WANDA
                    They say that to scare you.

                                  MARTY
                    It worked!

                                  WANDA
                    I didn t tell you because I didn t 
                    want you to worry.  Everything 
                    works out eventually.  You ll see.

      Marty walks away, beyond frustrated.  Wanda calls after.

    A hand writes  HEALING  on a bare arm in sharpie.  The scribe 
    is Sierra, whom we re finally meeting up close and personal.  
      This Texas magnolia has titanium petals.  She takes herself 
    and the sweet science of cheerleadingway too seriously.

                                  SIERRA 
                    This will provide inspiration and 
                    speed recovery.

                                  ALICE (O.S.)
                    Sure it will.

    The arm being written on, belongs to Alice, the cheerleader 
    who fell.  Her hand is in a hard splint.  She s in a bitchy 
      mood.  Maybe it s the pain... or maybe it s just her.

                                  ALICE (CONT D)
                    Wish you could have inspired Luis 
                    not to land on my friggin  hand.

      Luis, looks up from stowing gear and smiles, unruffled.  We 
      can t help but notice he s ripped -- tossing girls into the 
    air is apparently great exercise.  

                                  LUIS
                    You slipped and knocked down the 
                    pyramid.  And I m the bad guy 
                    because I fellon you?

                                  ALICE
                    It was clumsy.  You don t pay 
                    attention and it shows.

                                  LUIS
                    Reality de la Alice.

      Helping Luis stow equipment is Patty, whom we also met 
      briefly.  She s a female  base.   Unlike petite flyers Sierra 
    and Alice, Wedge is big and beautiful, like a plus-size 
      model.  Utterly comfortable in her own skin.  She grins, 
      never one to pass up an opportunity to bust balls.

                                  WEDGE
                    Relax, Luis.  It s just her 
                    bitterness talking. 

                                  ALICE
                    I m not bitter.

                                  WEDGE
                    Some girls don t like being dumped.          "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           9.


                                  ALICE
                    Uh, I dumped him.

                                  LUIS
                    Not how I remember it.  

      Luis manages to say things like this without coming off mean.  
      He s clueless, not callous.

                                  WEDGE
                    She fell, maybe hit her head.  
                    Retrograde memory loss happens.  

                                  ALICE
                    Wish I could be giving you both the 
                    finger right now.  Oh wait, I have 
                    two hands.  Yay.

    She lifts her other hand, but Sierra stops her from giving 
      Luis the finger.

                                  SIERRA
                    No more negativity.  

      Sierra jots  TEAM  on Alice s good arm.

                    TEAM.   Together Everyone 
                    Accomplishes More. 

      Alice scowls and jerks her arm away.

                                  ALICE
                    You re a circus freak.  

      Alice scrubs her arm with a washcloth.



    An exit to the locker rooms, another to the corridor.

                    You know he s been taking trustees 
                    out for fancy dinners, trying to 
                    get you fired.  

                                  VANESSA
                    By blaming me for injuries?  Rhia

                    The trustees are a bunch of 
                    stubborn old men.  They believe 
                    what they wanna believe.  What is 
                    it with you and Red anyway?

                                  VANESSA
                    It s ancient history, and has no

                    and we will make it great again.

                                  CURRAN

                    This is my second semester on the

                    The squad s on a five year losing

    He exits out to the corridor.

                                  SIERRA (O.S.)
                    We can place at nationals.

      Vanessa whirls around.  She didn t realize Luis, Sierra and 
    the Wedge were in the doorway to the locker room, listening.  

                                  VANESSA
                    How long you been standing there?

                    Vanessa got weirdedout and broke

                                  OFFICER
                    That was an ugly cut.  Hurt a lot 
                    of students.  One option is a 
                    student loan...  
                          (hands her a form)
                    It requires a co-signer.  Does your 
                    Mom have a decent credit rating?

      Marty laughs bitterly and hands back the form.

                                  MARTY
                    Like I said, she works at the UC
                    Pub.  What else ya got?

    The Officer pulls out another form.

                                  OFFICER
                    You can fill out a FAFSA.  Try for 
                    some government aid.

      Marty looks at the form.

                                  MARTY
                    This is due October 1.  That was 
                    last week.

                                  OFFICER
                    You ll be applying for next year.  

                                  MARTY
                    Next year?  What do I do till then?

                                  OFFICER
                    Take a nice vacation.  See the 
                    world.  Travel broadens you.  

                                  MARTY
                    You have to understand.  I ve been 
                    taking care of my mother since my 
                    dad left eleven years ago.  I wash 
                    her clothes, I make sure she s fed.  
                    I buck her up when her heart gets 
                    broken, which is basically always.  
                    I pay bills, work weekends.  Do you 
                    know what gets me through?

                                  OFFICER
                    If it s drugs, don t tell me.  I m 
                    obligated to report it.        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           14.


                                  MARTY
                    Hope.  The hope that I can graduate 
                    from a decent school, move far, far
                    away and live like a normal person.  
                    Kill my hope and you kill me.  I 
                    have to stay in school.

    The Officer shrugs, at a loss.

                                  OFFICER
                    As I said, we have a lot of 
                    students in the same boat.  Our 
                      discretionary funds are long gone.  
                    I wish you d come to us sooner.

      Marty nods, devastated.  

                                  MARTY
                    I wish I d knownsooner.

                                  OFFICER
                    If it helps, there are some niche 
                      scholarships.  Odd little things 
                    from speciality groups.  There s a 
                    catalog outside.



      Marty glumly thumbs through a catalogue.  She gripes to a 
      bored RECEPTIONIST.

                                  MARTY 
                    Oh, great.  They have a scholarship 
                    for students with the last name of 
                    Van Valkenberg... one for people 
                    fluent in Klingon... and one for 
                    those interested in pursuing a 
                    career in the potato industry.  I 
                    don t know where to start.

    The receptionist looks up, tired of listening.

                                  RECEPTIONIST
                    If you flip to the back, there s 
                    one for very sarcastic people.

                                  MARTY
                    Glad you can find joy in your job.

    As Marty continues to flip through the catalogue and take 
      notes, Sierra enters.  She pins a bright neon flyer 
      announcing  CHEERLEADER TRYOUTS  to a public bulletin board.  
    The receptionist brightens when she sees her.        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           15.


                                  RECEPTIONIST
                    Hey Sierra.  Hellcats taking us to 
                    nationals this season?

                                  SIERRA
                    You know it, Mona.

      Sierra plops a folder onto the counter, festively bound with 
    a vinyl cover and colorful ribbons for brads.

                                  SIERRA (CONT D)
                    I m dropping off my scholarship 
                    papers for Mr. Rabin.  Can you see 
                    that he gets it?

      Marty looks up, suddenly interested.

                                  MARTY
                    You applying for a scholarship?

                                  SIERRA
                    I have one now.  For cheerleading.

                                  MARTY
                      Cheerleading. 

                                  SIERRA
                    It comes with being a Hellcat.  
                    They need us fierce and focused.  
                    Eye on the prize.

                                  MARTY
                    There s a scholarship for 
                      cheerleading?For being a football 
                    groupie?  
                            (toreceptionist)
                    Did you know about this?

                                  SIERRA
                    You did not just call me a groupie.  

                                  MARTY
                    Nothing personal against you.  

                                  SIERRA
                    It doesn t get more personal than 
                    calling someone a groupie.

                                  MARTY
                    Groupies jump up and down in skimpy 
                    outfits screaming adulation for 
                    masculine fantasy figures.  Beyond 
                    that, we re splitting hairs.        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           16.


      Sierra gasps with indignation.

                                  SIERRA
                    Take that back.

                                  MARTY
                    What are we, in grade school?  I 
                    call no take-backs.

      Sierra steps forward, pissed.

                                  SIERRA
                    Don t make me come down off this 
                    porch.  I will.

                                  MARTY
                    Are you actually threatening me?  
                      Physically?  

                                  SIERRA
                    We are an NCA competitive sport.  
                    We spend twenty hours a week 
                      practicing. We bench press twice 
                    our body weight and run a seven 
                    minute mile. We compete with broken 
                    thumbs and twisted ankles smiling 
                    through the pain.  We are athletes!

                                  MARTY
                    Back in Dollywood, maybe.

      Sierra tries to slap Marty, but Marty catches her hand.

                                  MARTY (CONT D)
                    Wouldn t you rather get right to 
                    the hair-pulling?

      Sierra wrenches her arm free, incensed.

                                  SIERRA
                    I m not letting some grubby little 
                    gothinsult the Lancer Hellcats! 

                SIERRA (CONT D)MARTY
    And you d best be afraid, Oh my god, did you just call 
      because I ve got me a squad me  goth?   You don t even 
    of lean, hard champions that know what goth is, you 
      will troop on down to peroxide whack-job.  Yeah, 
      whatever gas station you work let s have a cheerleader gang 
    at and knock that smart mouth war!  I ll text some of my 
      clean off your face!brooding vampire cronies and 
                                                  we can all throw down!

      Both girls are breathing hard.  They ve stopped the room.        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           17.


                                  SIERRA (CONT D)
                    Everyone s staring.

                                  MARTY
                    We should leave quietly.

                                  SIERRA
                    Count of three.

      They silently count, turn and exit in opposite directions.  
    As she exits, Marty notes THE FLYER for cheer tryouts.  Ugh.  



      Marty enters, locks door, closes blinds, making sure she s 
      alone.  Then she pops out the DVD and sticks it into the 
      player.  WE FIND the title of the movie:   BRING IT ON. 

    She moves furniture, clears space in the middle of the room.

    As the movie begins, Marty imitates the cheerleader moves.  
    She does a standing back flip and knocks a lamp into one of 
    her framed gymnastics photos.  She rights the lamp, surprised 
    as we are that she can still pull it off.  Off her grim 
      resolve...

      FADE OUT.

                                      END OF ACT ONE        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           18.


                                            ACT TWO

      FADE IN:



      Luis, Sierra, Wedge, Alice and Vanessa, all in uniform.  ON 
      VIDEO, they watch the Cyclones rehearse, dismayed.  

                                  VANESSA
                    Their elevators are flawless. 

                                  SIERRA
                    I can t go half that high.

                                  ALICE
                    It s not you.  Those guys are 
                    monsters.  
                          (a bitchy look at Luis)
                    I wish ourbases had that power.

                                  LUIS
                    They re probably juiced.

                                  SIERRA
                    It s a Christian University.  They 
                    don t take drugs.

                                  WEDGE
                    Or drink.  Or dance.  Or get laid.  

                                  ALICE
                    Jesus is the wind beneath their 
                    skirts.

                                  VANESSA
                    Well, it s clear we can t out-power 
                    them.  So we ll need another angle.  
                    Something to set us apart.

                                  SIERRA
                    And fast. Qualifiers are in a week.

                                  VANESSA
                    We ve got our work cut out for us.

      A hunkybase named DARWIN (23), Asian, sticks his head in.          "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           20.


                                  DARWIN
                    The wannabes are done learning the 
                    steps.  They re waiting for you.  

                                  VANESSA
                    Let s pray for a ringer.

      Vanessa grabs a clip board and the gang exits...



    A huddle of expectant hopefuls.  They allow Sierra respectful 
      distance as she enters and posts a list of who made the cut.  
      Once Sierra is gone, the girls crowd in like guppies vying 
    for a sprinkle of fish food.  Most girls are disappointed, a 
      precious few are elated.  Once they re gone, Marty enters and 
      walks to the list.  Her eyes are closed.  

                                  MARTY
                    And... open.  
                          (eyesstill closed)
                    Open now and... 

      Another beat.  She opens one eye.  Breathes a sigh of relief.  
    Her name is on the list!  Marty looks around to see if anyone 
    is watching, and does an exuberant cartwheel.



      Alice changes the splint on her hurt hand.  It s tough going 
      one-handed.  Red passes by, sees Alice, enters.

                                  RED
                    Can I help you splint that?

      Alice looks up, shrugs.

                                  ALICE
                    Knock yourself out.

      TIME CUT.  Now Red sits beside Alice, finishing helping her.

                                  RED
                    Me and the boys felt awful when we 
                    heard about your injury.  Ask me, 
                    Vanessa pushes you girls too hard.  
                    Puts the entire program at risk.         "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           26.


                                  ALICE
                    Accidents happen.  I m just lucky 
                    there was no serious nerve damage.

                                  RED
                    Thank God for that.

                                  ALICE
                    Cuz then I wouldn t be able to feel 
                    your hand.

    She glances down.  Red has his hand on her leg.  

                                  RED
                    Touche. 

    Red smiles and slowly removes his hand. 

                                  ALICE
                    Is this how it works?

                                  RED
                    Mm?

                                  ALICE
                      Compassionate coach reaches out to 
                      impressionable cheerleader, 
                    charming her with his sensitivity 
                    and warmth.  When her head clears, 
                    she s staring at the roof of his 
                      Expedition, panties around her 
                    ankles. 

    Red laughs hard.

                                  RED
                    How da little thing like you get 
                    so cynical?

                    Alice, you are terrific.  I hope 
                    you re back on the field soon.  I 
                    only wish Vanessa saw the same 
                    potential I do.

      This hits a nerve with Alice.        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           27.

                    Bumping Sierra to Captain.  You put 
                    two years into the squad, then a 
                    little nobody like Sierra transfers 
                    in from another school and 
                    leapfrogs you?

                          (unconvincing)
                    Sierra s good.  It was Vanessa s 
                    call to make and she made it.

                                  RED

                                  ALICE
                    Yeah, well.  I m happy where I am.

                                  RED
                    Girls like you are never happy 
                    where they are.  Get well soon.

    Red rises and leaves.  Alice stews.



    The Hellcats (usual suspects plus our ND extras) watch a 
      football game, Titans vs.Colts.  Everyone s totally into it. 

      There s a knock at the door.  Alice is closest.  She gets up 
    and answers.  It s Marty with her bags.

                                  ALICE
                    You don t have to knock.  There s a 
                    swipe card for your ID.

                                  MARTY
                    Oh.  Okay.  I m one of the new 
                    girls.  Marty.

                                  ALICE
                    I know who you are.  I voted 
                    against you.  Got overruled.  
                      Democracy s a bitch.

      Alice rejoins the group, leaving Marty with her bags.  

                                  MARTY
                          (under her breath)
                    So are you, apparently.

    The group cheers a play in the game, not noticing Marty.  Off 
      Marty, isolated, uncertain and out of her element...

      FADE OUT.

                                      END OF ACT TWO        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           30.


                                          ACT THREE

      FADE IN:



      Marty enters and throws her bag onto the bed.  This is a 
      double room that has been expanded into a double single.  
      Everything is bright pastel colors and extremely feminine.  

      Marty is a bit repulsed, particularly by the matching 
      coverlets with Lancer logos sewn upon them.  Marty inspects 
    the wall.  Many photos and clippings of Sierra cheerleading
    all the way back to a cheerleader halloweencostume she wore 
    as a toddler.  Along with it are a number of awards, ribbons, 
      etc.  Marty smiles at this ego wall, perhaps reminded of her 
    own back at home. 

      Sierra enters.

                                  SIERRA
                    Hello, Marty. Welcome to Cheertown.

                                  MARTY
                    Can we start over?  I m sorry about 
                    the other day.  I was in a crap 
                    mood, I went looking for a fight...  

                                  SIERRA
                    I ve put that aside.  Vanessa 
                    thinks you can help us beat 
                    Southern Christian next week, and 
                    that s what matters.  That s why I 
                    voted for you.

                                  MARTY
                    You did?  Seriously?  After 
                    everything I said?

                                  SIERRA
                    You can make up for your appalling 
                    rudeness with hard work and 
                      perseverance.

      Marty shrugs, fair enough.  Sierra bustles around opening the 
      closet, drawers, etc.

                                  SIERRA (CONT D)
                    I ve allocated half of the closet 
                    space for you.  The furniture is 
                    mine, but I prefer the upper 
                    drawers.          "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           31.


                                  MARTY
                    I m a bottom, myself.

      Sierra stares blankly.

                                  MARTY (CONT D)
                    That s just a joke.

                                  SIERRA
                    Mm, we should come up with a signal 
                    for that to avoid confusion.  I ve 
                    earmarked half of my linens, 
                    coverlets and towels for you.  

                                  MARTY
                    If by coverlet you mean bedspread, 
                    I ve already got one.

                                  SIERRA
                    It s nicer when it matches, don t 
                    you think?  

      It s not up for discussion.  Sierra turns to the desk.

                                  SIERRA (CONT D)
                    I ve cleaned out a desk for you and 
                    lined it with shelving paper.  What 
                    kind of light bulbs do you like?

      Marty has no answer.  It s going to be a long semester.



      Marty wakes up.  Blearily looks at clock.  7AM.Sierra is 
      already up and dressed.       

                                  SIERRA
                    Morning.  I m off to the gym.  See 
                    you at practice.  We ll fit you for 
                    your new uniform.

      Sierra flounces out.  

                                  MARTY
                    Yaaaaaay.

      Marty drags herself out of bed.



      Marty emerges from her room in a robe carrying a towel and 
      shower kit.  She walks into...          "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           32.



        A co-edbathroom.  This is the central room with stalls and 
      sinks, fair game to either gender.  Two doors lead to 
      separate shower rooms for guys and girls.  A couple of guys 
      step out of the men s shower area in towels.       

      Marty opens the door to the girls  shower area.  



      Shower stalls with frosted doors.  Patty the Wedge is here, 
      towelling off from a shower, not remotely self-conscious.

                                  WEDGE
                    Yo, Marty.

                                  MARTY
                    Hi.  It s Patty -- right?  

                                  WEDGE
                    Everyone calls me  The Wedge. 

      Alice steps out of the shower and grabs a towel.

                                  ALICE
                    In or out, you re causing a draft.

      Marty s not thrilled by group nudity, but when in Rome.  She 
      enters, hangs up her robe and wraps a towel around herself. 

    She sees Wedge s arm has the word  STRENGTH  written on it.

                                  MARTY
                    What s with all the writing?

                                  WEDGE
                    It s Sierra s thing.  It s supposed 
                    to be an inspirational mnemonic. 

                                  MARTY
                    Does it work?  You look pretty 
                    strong already.

                                  ALICE
                    The Wedge can t afford to coast.  
                    She s barely keeping up with the 
                    guys as it is.  

    But Wedge is too smart to let Alice bait her...         "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           33.


                                  WEDGE
                          (to Marty)
                    Like Luis.  He s physically bigger, 
                    so he has more power than me.  
                    You ll get to experience those 
                    steel-belted arms first-hand, since 
                    you re replacing Alice here as his 
                    flyer.  They used to date.  Did you 
                    know that?  It was a big thing when 
                    they broke up.

                                  ALICE
                    This girl is not replacing me.  
                    I ll be back in a month or so.

                                  WEDGE
                    A lot can happen in a month.  
                    Better not coast. 

    The Wedge exits.  Now Marty and Alice are alone.

                                  MARTY
                    Alice.  I understand you didn t 
                    want me.  But I m here now.  I 
                    think we should try -- 

                                  ALICE
                    -- You won t be around long.

                                  MARTY
                    Huh?

                                  ALICE
                    The Hellcats are short on flyers at 
                    a crucial moment.  That sthe only 
                    reason a dangerously inexperienced 
                    outsider got a foot in the door. 

                                  MARTY
                    I tried out like everyone else.

                                  ALICE
                    You re no flyer.  You re petite and 
                    you can move.  That s it.  And the 
                    weirdo dance moves?  Forget it.  
                    You re a tumbler at best, and we ve 
                    got more tumblers than we need.  
                    Once I m back, you ll get bounced.  

                                  MARTY
                    Unless I... oh what s the word... 
                    prove myself.        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           34.


                                  ALICE
                    In my experience, when you re done 
                    with a band-aid, you rip it off and 
                    throw it away.  

    A beat.

                                  MARTY
                    Oh, I m the band-aid.  Got it.  
                    Do you invent your own catty 
                    metaphors, or is there a book?  

      Marty steps into the shower.  Alice fumes.  She then notices 
      Marty s robe and towel hanging on a peg.  Alice impulsively 
      grabs both and exits.  



      Back to the common area.  It s empty.  After a beat, we hear:

                                  MARTY (O.S.)
                    Oh, crap! Crap!

      Marty has just noticed her robe and towel are missing.  After 
    a beat, Marty peeks in from the girls  shower room.  We hear 
      some guys showering in the next room.  Marty runs into the 
      common area and peeks out the door to the hallway...   

    HER POVOF HALLWAY:  ND-Hellcats gossip.  Marty looks around, 
      panicked.  There s nothing with which to cover herself!  

    The voices from the shower area grow louder.  Someone s 
      coming!  Marty runs into a bathroom stall and shuts the door.

      INSIDE THE STALL

      Marty perches on the toilet.  We hear the voices of Luis and 
      some ND male Hellcats.

      OUTSIDE THE STALL

      Luis, wearing a towel, checks for feet and opens the door. 

      INSIDE THE STALL

      Marty is hunched on the toilet, pleading with her eyes.

                                  LUIS
                    Wow.  Shower and a show.

                                  MARTY
                            (desperately whispers)
                    Help me.        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           35.


      Luis winks, then shuts the door.  Under the stall door, Marty 
    can see his bare feet turn away.  Suddenly, Luis  towel 
      drops.  We hear him yell to his buddies:

                                  LUIS (O.S.)
                    Yo -- this look crooked to you? 

                                  ND HELLCAT #1 (O.S.)
                    Ugh!  

                                  LUIS (O.S.)
                    I think maybe I slept on it wrong.  

                                  ND HELLCAT #2 (O.S.)
                          (laughing)
                    Put it away!  

                                  LUIS (O.S.)
                    I need a splint or something.  Hey, 
                    come back!  I need help!  Dudes!

      Luis  feet kick the towel under the stall door for Marty.  We 
      hear him chase his laughing buddies out into the hall.  
      Scandalized O.S. squealsfrom ND FEMALE HELLCATS as Luis 
      streaks the hall outside.  Marty gratefully grabs the towel.



      Practice is still in progress.  The girls are all sweaty from 
    the exertion.  Marty sips from a water bottle, exhausted.  

                                  VANESSA
                    Okay.  Time for partner work.  
                    Marty, you re with Luis. 

      Luis joins Marty.

                                  MARTY
                    Thanks for the save this morning.

                                  LUIS
                    I m a sucker for a damsel in 
                    distress.  Plus, I like getting 
                    naked.          "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           40.


                                  MARTY
                    Me, not so much.

                                  LUIS
                    Too bad, you got the body for it.

      Marty blushes -- first time we ve ever seen her speechless. 

    The guys hold the girls  shoes in one hand, the girls 
      teetering over head. (This move is called an  Awesome. )  

                                  LUIS (CONT D)
                    You re going up, baby.  

      Marty s eyes go wide.  Shit. 



      Sierra towers several feet off the ground, one foot in each 
    of Darwin s hands (he s her base).  Darwin tosses Sierra into 
    the air.  When she reaches maximum height, she kicks both 
      feet up to head height, and sails downward, butt first.  

      Darwin catches her in cradle position.  Perfect BASKET TOSS.  

      Luis reaches for Marty to do the same.  She pulls away.

                                  MARTY
                    I m sorry, no.

                    What?

                                  MARTY
                    What if you drop me?    

                                  LUIS
                    I won t.

                                  MARTY
                    I believe you believe that.

                                  VANESSA
                    We having a problem?

                                  MARTY
                    Look, in gymnastics it s just me.  
                    If I get hurt, I own it.  I can t 
                    just -- in the air -- I mean, what 
                    is wrong with you people?        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           41.


                                  SIERRA
                          (knowingly)
                    She s getting mental.  

      Marty shoots her a look.  Was that an insult?

                                  MARTY
                    Don t make me come off this porch.

                                  VANESSA
                    It s cheer slang.  It means you re 
                    thinking of all the bad things that 
                    can happen.  In cheer, we sometimes 
                    have to lie to ourselves.  Create a 
                    world of best possible outcomes, 
                    where everything works out right.  
                    I fly fearlessly into the air with 
                    a big easy smile, because I know my 
                    team won t let me hit ground.

                                  MARTY
                    Yeah well, life s not like that.

                                  VANESSA
                    Not always.  But when you expect 
                    the worst, you tend to get it.  

      This lands with Marty.  Vanessa blows her whistle.  

                                  VANESSA (CONT D)
                    Line up for suicide drops!

      Marty looks alarmed.  Don t like the sound of that.  



      Sierra pins Marty s Hellcat uniform.  It s the first time 
      we ve seen Marty wearing Hellcat colors and she looks hot.  

                                  SIERRA
                    You look great. 
                            (inspectsMarty s legs)
                    We ll get some base to hide the 
                    bruises.

                                  MARTY
                    Training s been pretty rough.  
                          (beat)
                    But I guess it s like that with any 
                      competitive sport.

      Sierra slowly smiles.

                                  SIERRA
                    You don t think we re groupies?  

                                  MARTY
                    I do not. 

      Sierra nods, pleased.

                                  SIERRA
                    So what happened to you anyway?

                                  MARTY
                    What do you mean?

                                  SIERRA
                    You ve clearly trained.  A lot.  
                    Otherwise you wouldn t be able to 
                    keep up.

                                  MARTY
                    I was a gymnast up until high 
                    school.

                                  SIERRA
                    Why dyou stop?

                                  MARTY
                    My senior year, we made state, so 
                    my Mom was there to cheer me on.  
                    She brought a date.

                                  MARTY (CONT'D)
                    And they d been drinking at lunch.  
                    She was screaming, hooting and 
                    hollering.  All the other girls 
                    were looking, wondering who the 
                    white trash freak was.  I kept 
                    praying that nobody would connect 
                    her to me.  

                                  SIERRA
                    What happened?

                                  MARTY
                    I got mental.  I missed a jump and 
                    fell on my ass.  Mom s an emotional 
                    drunk, so she comes lurching out of 
                    the stands in tears to make sure 
                    I m okay.  Everybody s looking, the 
                    other gymnasts are laughing... 
                          (beat)
                    ... and then she puked on me.

      Sierra stares.

                                  SIERRA
                    Shut up.

                                  MARTY
                    I couldn t make that up if I tried.  

      Both girls laugh. 

      ANGLE ON NEXT ROW OF LOCKERS -- Alice has been sitting and 
      listening.   

                                  SIERRA
                    So you never went back?

                                  MARTY
                    I kept at it for a month or so.  
                    But I couldn t get her to stop 
                    coming to meets.  Every time I d 
                    step up to the bars, I d feel her 
                    soul-sucking presence, get wigged 
                    out and blow the routine.  

      Alice makes a face, bored by Marty s old emotional baggage.

                                  MARTY (CONT D)
                    I finally stopped trying.  Wasn t 
                    worth it.        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           46.


                                  SIERRA
                          (suddenly concerned)
                    You didn t invite your mother to 
                      qualifiers, did you?

                                  MARTY
                          (laughs)
                    Oh, God no.  

                                  SIERRA
                    Good.  We need this win.  By the 
                    way, how do you feel about Luis?

                                  MARTY
                          (flustered)
                    Good. He s good. I mean fine.  Why?

      Suddenly, Alice is paying full attention.

                                  SIERRA
                    He s only our best base.  He came 
                    to Vanessa and asked if he could 
                    make you his permanent flyer.

                                  MARTY
                    He did?  And permanent how? 

                                  SIERRA
                    He s first-string, so you stay a 
                      first-string.  It s a big deal.  
                    Base and flyer have a special 
                    relationship -- they learn each 
                    other s rhythms and do everything 
                    together, like Batman and Robin.  

                                  MARTY
                    Pretty sure Batman and Robin didn t 
                    do everything together.

      Suddenly, SLAM!  Alice storms out of the room.  Sierra and 
      Marty exchange puzzled looks, wondering what the noise was.  



      Alice storms up to Luis, who is watching TV.  

                                  ALICE

                    If there s one thing I know how to 
                    do, it s make you happy.

    She nestles in closer to him, he pushes her off.

                                  LUIS
                    We should never have hooked up.  I 
                    thought it d be fun.  

                                  ALICE
                    It was.

                    If I wanted that much drama in my 
                    life, I d go home for Thanksgiving.  

                                  ALICE
                          (dramatically)
                    I am not dramatic!

                                  LUIS
                    And the worst part is, it wrecked 
                    the work.  And that s why I m here. 

                                  ALICE
                    You re all gonnabump me down.  For 
                    that skinny little bitch.  

                                  LUIS
                    Don t get paranoid.  I happen to be 
                    clicking with Marty.  I want the 
                    squad to win. 

                                  ALICE
                    And you think the squad has a 
                    better shot with Marty in my spot.        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           48.


                                  LUIS
                    ... It s not an exact science.  

    He walks off, leaving Alice stunned and alone.



      Wanda tends bar. Alice walks up in her Hellcat uniform.  

                                  ALICE
                    I ll take a Stella, please.

      Wanda nods and serves the beer.

                                  WANDA
                    I see you re a Hellcat.

                                  ALICE
                    Yes, I -- Oh my gosh.  You re 
                    Marty s mom.  Wanda, right?

                                  WANDA
                    Well, yeah.  How dyou -- ?

                                  ALICE
                    The resemblance is uncanny.  I 
                    would have guessed older sister, 
                    but Marty talks about you a lot, so 
                    I feel like I know you.  You must 
                    be so excited about seeing Marty at 
                    qualifiers this Saturday.

                                  WANDA
                    What are qualifiers?

                                  ALICE
                    Marty s debut. You re going, right?  

                                  WANDA
                    Marty always yells at me when I 
                    come to these things.  She can be 
                    such a diva.  Every little thing 
                    has to be just so.  

                                  ALICE
                    I know.  But she talks about you 
                    all the time.  You ve been a huge 
                      inspiration in her life.

                                  WANDA
                    Really?        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           49.


                                  ALICE
                    She s a mama s girl at heart.  
                    She d kick herself if you missed 
                    her first big event!

                                  WANDA
                    It would be fun to surprise her.

                                  ALICE
                    Totally.  I ll write down the 
                    information.  Got a pen?



      From above, clusters colorful uniforms punctuated with 
      matching hair ribbons.  Against one wall, CHEER TEAMS in 
      bleachers.  Friends and family sit opposite.  The gym floor 
    is covered with a UNITED CHEERLEADINGASSOCIATION logo.  The 
      JUDGES sit center, along with an ANNOUNCER.

    We FIND our intrepid Hellcats, a cluster of green.  They re 
      joined by Vanessa, sporting team sweats.  

      Sierra passes out little strips of paper.  Everyone licks 
      their papers.  The guys slap them onto their forearms.  The 
      girls press them to their cheeks.   Sierra licks one and 
      sticks it on Marty s forehead.

                                  MARTY
                    Ugh!  You licked that!

      Marty s tattoo is the Lancer University cartoon tiger. 

                                  SIERRA
                    Grrrr! Grrr! Grrrrrreeeeeen!

    The rest of the squad responds with the same cheer.  Marty 
      looks around like she s arrived on an alien planet.  Vanessa 
      leans into Marty excitedly.  

                                  VANESSA
                    Your first competition.  Is it 
                    everything you thought it would be?    

                                  MARTY

    The crowd of cheerleaders goes WILD with excitement.

                    QUALIFYING CHAMPIONSHIPS!!!

      Marty sees Dan in the audience.  She waves and begins working 
    her way towards him.



    An all-girl team is first up.  Tiny bird-like women are the 
      flyers.  The bases are big and powerful like the Wedge.  
      Marty reaches Dan.  He notes her tattoo.

                                  DAN
                    That s some mad ink you got there.  

                                  MARTY
                    Me and Amy Winehouse.

                                  DAN
                    You look amazing.  Despite the fact 
                    that you re dressed like a 
                    cheerleader.  That part s weird.

      Marty smacks him.  

                                  DAN (CONT D)

                    You seduce Rosalie?

                                  DAN
                    I tried, but ended up banging 
                    myself by mistake.  I m nothing 
                    without my sensei master.

                                  MARTY
                    I ve been training 24/7 for this 
                    thing.  Once things settle down 
                    with the squad, my time llfree up.

      Luis stands in the bleachers and whistles, waving Marty over.

                                  MARTY (CONT D)
                    You wanna come sit on our side?

                    Sitting with the cheerleaders.  
                    Lordy.Am I even allowed?        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           51.


                                  MARTY
                    I m new.  I can plead ignorance.

    She leads Dan around to the other side...



      Marty and Dan return to the Hellcats.  Suddenly, we hear: 

                                  WANDA (O.S.)
                    Baby!  

      Wanda is sitting a few rows back, right next to Alice.  Wanda 
      crowds her way past Hellcats, making her way to Marty.  She 
      leans forward, gives Marty a big hug and kiss.

                                  WANDA (CONT D)
                    All the good seats were taken, and 
                    then I ran into Alice.

    She waves up to Alice, who waves back, favoring Marty with a 
      big, bitchy smile.

                                  WANDA (CONT D)
                    She invited me to sit with the 
                    girls.  I hope people don t mistake 
                    mefor a Hellcat.

      Wanda does a little cheer move followed by a tiger claw move.  
      It s even more embarrassing than it looks on the page.  

      Vanessa and Sierra sense danger and approach.  Alice leans 
      back, enjoying the show.

                                  MARTY
                    Mom, you can t be here.

                                  WANDA
                    How come Dan s allowed?

    A beat.  Marty doesn t have a good answer for that.

                                  DAN
                    I m sleeping with the coach.

    He interlocks fingers with Vanessa.  

                                  DAN (CONT D)
                    Baby, you re looking fine today.

      Vanessa yanks her hand back.        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           52.


                                  MARTY
                    Can you just go home?  Please?

                                  WANDA
                    Why wouldn t you want me here?  I m 
                    proud of you.  

                                  SIERRA
                    I think you should do what your 
                    daughter says. 

      Sierra takes Wanda s arm.  Wanda shakes her off.

                                  WANDA
                    Touch me again, I ll bust your 
                    nose.  This is between me and my 
                    daughter.  

                                  MARTY
                    Fine.  Stay.  Whatever.

      Marty storms away.  

                                  WANDA
                    I ll be quiet as a mouse!

      Wanda takes a seat.  Vanessa follows Marty.    

                                  VANESSA
                    Marty?  What s going on?

      Sierra is left alone with Dan.  She looks up at him -- she s 
      tiny, he s gigantic.

                                  SIERRA
                    So.  How long have you and Vanessa 
                    been together?

    Dan needs a moment to realize she s serious. 

                                  DAN
                    We re not.  I was trying to take 
                    the heat off Marty.  It was a joke.

                                  SIERRA
                    I sometimes miss those.  I m 
                    Sierra, her roomie.

    She extends her hand.  He shakes it.

                                  DAN

    Dan looks over at Marty.  She s enraged by her mom s presence 
    and is unloading to Vanessa and Luis.  Luis has his arm 
      around Marty.  

    Dan looks back to Sierra, a plan formulating.  

                                  DAN (CONT D)
                    Hey, Sierra.  You seem cool.  You 
                    want to go out with me tonight?  

      Sierra cocks her head, utterly dumfounded.

                                  SIERRA
                    Is that another joke?

                                  DAN
                    No.

                                  SIERRA
                    Then... okay.  Yes.  

    She whips out a sharpie and jots her cell number on his arm.

                                  SIERRA
                    I should go.

                                  DAN
                    Okay.

                                  SIERRA
                    Bye.

    Dan watches Sierra join the Hellcats in the center of the 
      gym.  He may only have eyes for Marty... but things change.

      FADE OUT.

                                            ACT SIX

      FADE IN:

    The Hellcats are in position in the center of the gymnasium.  
      They re awkwardly waiting for Marty, who sits in the 
      bleachers fending off the worried Luis and Vanessa. 

                                  LUIS
                    Marty...

                                  MARTY
                    I want no comfort.  What I do want 
                    is for the ceiling to collapse 
                    crushing everyone in this room, 
                    starting with my mother.  
                          (glancesup)
                    Not my day all around.

      Luis and Vanessa exchange a look.  This is bad.  The crowd is 
      starting to murmur, is something wrong?

      ALICE watches from the sidelines.  Coldly satisfied.  Red 
      sidles up to her.

                                  RED
                    Y know, once we downsize the 
                    Hellcats, we re gonnaneed a new 
                    captain.       

                                  ALICE

      Alice stares in shock as he moves off.

      BACK TO MARTY

                                  VANESSA
                    Marty look at me.  Look.  This is 
                    the part where you lie.  Smile.  
                    The music s about to play and for 
                    three minutes and thirty-one 
                    seconds, you live in a world where 
                    your mother is perfect.  Nobody 
                      embarrasses or disappoints.  And if 
                    anything scares you or makes you 
                    angry, you can fly away from it.

                                  MARTY
                    That s the biggest load of facile 
                    crapI ve ever heard in my life.

      Vanessa cuffs Marty upside the head.  From Vanessa, the 
      gesture doesn t seem remotely mean.

                                  VANESSA
                    What part of lyingdo you keep 
                    missing?  For the next three 
                    minutes and thirty-one seconds?  
                    You got wings, girlfriend.

      Luis extends a hand to Marty.

                                  LUIS
                    C mon.

      Marty nods, resolved to try.  She and Luis join the others.



    The Hellcats begin.  A SIREN sounds, followed by a thundering 
      techno beat -- a wild MASH-UP of music, sounds and SFX. 
      First up: tumbling passes.  Two tumblers run in from each 
      side and break into unison ROUND-OFFS, BACK HANDSPRINGS, BACK 
      FLIPS.  Marty looks genuinely happy to be performing.  Maybe 
      she s missed gymnastics more than she realized. 

    The squad moves onto a dance combo with sharp, SNAPPY ARMS 
    AND POWERFUL KICKS.  They re doing the awesome  Marty-fied  
      sexy dance moves and the crowd eats it up!         "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           56.


    THE CYCLONES 

    Are one exception.  They re scandalized by the sexy moves.

    RED AND BILL CURRAN

    Red looks pissed.Curran bops to the beat, enjoying it.    

      SIERRA

      Hits an ace STANDING BACK TUCK, playing the crowd like a pro.  

    A MECHANIZED VOICE on the soundtrackinstructs us to GET 
      RIGHT TO IT! And the squad lines up to get into a pyramid.  

    As Marty presses her foot into the Wedge s quad and steps 
      into place as the squad forms several smaller human pyramids.  
    The pyramid in the center is three people high, SIERRA 
      TEETERING ON TOP.  Sierra is hoisted into the air and FORWARD 
      FLIPS down into the waiting arms of Darwin below.  

    The crowd goes WILD.  As the rest of the pyramids dismantle, 
    the music switches to KANYEWEST S  STRONGER.   

    The team reassembles for the most important part of the 
      routine: STUNTING.  As Marty and Luis come together, he sees 
    the worry on her face.  Luis sings along with the music --

                                  LUIS
                    That that thatthat won t kill 
                    me... can only make me stronger...  

      Marty steps up into his hands and sings:  

                                  MARTY
                    ...I can t wait much longer...

      Marty s legs shake as Luis raises her up to his shoulders....  

                                  LUIS
                    Steady.   

      Marty s left leg bends just slightly, not enough for the 
      audience to see, only enough for Luis to feel it.  

                                  LUIS (CONT D)
                    It s all you.  Hold steady.

                                  MARTY
                    Luis, I can t do this, don t...  

                                  LUIS

      There s no use arguing.  Marty LOCKS her knee and UP SHE 
      GOES, SAILING INTO THE AIR.  Kanyeyells on the soundtrackas 
      Marty hits her TOE TOUCH like a pro.  SHE WHOOSHES BACK 
      DOWNWARD INTO LUIS S ARMS.  Perfect basket toss!

    The team moves into the CHEER portion, brimming with energy.  

                                  HELLCATS
                    GO BIG GREEN!  EVERYBODY SAY, GO 
                    BIG GREEN!!

      Final tableau!  The crowd goes crazy!

                    Did you see my girl Marty?  I mean, 
                    did you see my girl Marty?

      DAN, WANDA AND VANESSA jump up, clapping and cheering.  Wanda 
      tries to run down to the floor.

                                  WANDA
                    I have to go hug my baby!
