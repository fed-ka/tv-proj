      INT. LOFT. DAY. (D1)11

      Jess wipes off an antique hutch. Schmidt enters from his room. 

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Ohhh. Jess. Look at that. That goes 
                    with... nothing. 

                                  JESS
                    Can you believe I found this on the 
                    street this morning? Who could have 
                    thrown this away?

                                    SCHMIDT
                    I don t know, Jess. A blind man who 
                    suddenly recovered his sight?
                          (suddenly serious)
                    Get rid of it. Pine has no place in 
                    this loft. It s the wood of poor 
                    people and outhouses. 

                                  JESS
                    I m going to fix it up! I need a 
                    place to show off all the amazing 
                    artwork Toby makes me. 

22INT. JESS  CLASSROOM. FLASHBACK. 

      Jess sits at her desk, covered in odd art projects. TOBY, an  
      off-kilter student, offers her a large painted branch. 

                                  JESS
                    Toby... another painted tree 
                    branch. This is your best yet.

      She puts the branch in a large pile of painted branches and 
      logs on the floor, about the equivalent of a small tree. 

                                  TOBY
                    I have a lifetime of branches for 
                    you if you accept my offer.

      BACK TO PRESENT: (D1)33

                                    SCHMIDT
                      Absolutely not. It makes me sad, 
                    Jess. It makes me wish we still had 
                    acid rain. 

                                  JESS
                    Then where am I gonna put my 
                    painted sticks?NEW GIRL #114    "Control"        FINAL COLLATED DRAFT       2.


                                    SCHMIDT
                    In a safe? Behind some UV-resistant 
                    glass? In a room protected by a web 
                    of lasers?

                                  JESS
                    No, Schmidt. It s going in the 
                    living room. I ve lived here long 
                    enough. I let you veto my framed 
                    poster of Laura Ingalls Wilder.

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Oh good lord.

                                  JESS
                    I pay rent. That gives me the right 
                    to add a few things to this-- 

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Wrong! I clean, I cook-- I make the 
                    big decisions. I decide the color 
                    palette, the play of light and dark, 
                    the irony barometer. Which devices 
                    are and are not allowed on  Charger 
                    Island.  So, no. My answer is no.  

      A tense moment passes between them, then Jess takes a stand:

                                  JESS
                    Okay. Well. I m not getting rid of 
                    this hutch, Schmidt. 

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Then put it in your room. 

                                  JESS
                    What if I--

                                    SCHMIDT
                    In your room! Don t push me, Jess. 
                    I m about to tell you what I really 
                    think of your clothes. Do you want 
                    me to re-instate my ban on high-
                    waisted shorts? 

                                  JESS
                    All right, all right...

      She begins wheeling off her hutch, sneering at Schmidt.

44INT. BATHROOM. SHORT TIME LATER. (D1) 

      A hung over NICK splashes water on his face as a groggy 
      WINSTON enters, swigging from a beer bottle. NEW GIRL #114    "Control"        FINAL COLLATED DRAFT       3.


                                  NICK
                    Are you still drinking? It s ten in 
                    the morning.

                                    WINSTON
                    I know what it ll feel like when I 
                    stop. So I m just gonna stay a 
                    little drunk forever.

                    You need to know that was the first 
                    time I ever thought of that.

                    So. Last night s poker. Got pretty 
                    intense. We never settled up.

                    Mm-hmm.

                                    WINSTON
                    That s how you want to play this?

      Winston is annoyed. Jess enters.

                    Schmidt pisses me off so much!

      loft is empty except a few broken chairs and a table made out 
      of pizza boxes. Winston is there holding a head of lettuce. NEW GIRL #114    "Control"        FINAL COLLATED DRAFT       5.

                    Listen, I guess I m fine not 
                    telling people about us, but you

                    Cece, the only thing that gets me 
                    more aroused than you is my finely-
                    crafted daily routine. I refuse to

      Upset, Schmidt gets out of the car without his shoes on. He 
      tiptoe-runs past the homeless Guy, terrified.

      Schmidt enters. The hutch is back. The apartment has been 
      filled with various pieces of antique bric-a-brac: A giant 
      birdcage with a stuffed bird, four old typewriters, an old 
      dressmaker dummy, etc. Schmidt looks around, stunned.

                    Wha... Okay, what happened here? Do

      Jess gestures to the hutch. Horrified, Schmidt spots the 
      grinder and looks like he s about to get physically ill.

                                    SCHMIDT
                    That hutch has been on the street.

      Schmidt tries to open the hutch with his elbows. No dice. He 
      signals for Jess to help. Jess rolls her eyes and opens the 
      drawer. Schmidt puts the mitts on, removes the coffee 
      grinder, then starts to push the hutch toward the door.

                    My hutch isn t going anywhere.

      Jess starts pushing back the hutch from the other side. They 
      struggle for a few beats. It s a stalemate.

      fury, charges the hutch. He grunts as he gives the hutch a 
      huge push. It starts to tip. Jess moves away just in time, as

                    I am aware that we re both super 
                    broke. I have recently tumbled down 
                    the socio-economic ladder and hit 
                    rock bottom. Where you ve been 
                    waiting, patiently, for the past 15 
                    years. However, I find comfort in 
                    knowing that as bad as I am at

                    ordered the fight. Oh, and I got 
                    the beer for that, that s another

                    You guys were right. I messed up 
                    the ecosystem. I went down to the 
                    beach to get Schmidt back, but he 
                    just ignored me and started 
                    twirling a fire baton. He is not 
                    good. He burned a lot of people. 
                          (then)
                    I think I lost him. He won t come 
                    home.
