IN COLOR: A FULL MOON shines over a picture-perfect American
town. PEOPLE, seen in SILHOUETTE, stroll past quaint shops
whose signs promise RELIABLE APPLIANCES, WELL-MADE CLOTHES,
SOLID VALUES. A DINER has a neon sign that offers the "BEST
EATS IN TOWN". But something is wrong. The neon isn't lit.
Nothing in town is lit. Street lamps, windows, are all dark.
TCHICK! KA-TCHICK-TCHICK. That DISTURBING SOUND continues.
Some of the PEDESTRIANS drift into "UNIONTOWN PARK", milling
around a GAZEBO, where THREE "MUSICIANS" are struggling with
a trombone, a saxophone, and a tambourine. They can't seem to
make the instruments work, except for the tambourine player,
who is rattling out a few very unrhythmic beats. That's where
that sound is coming from. TCHICK! KA-TCHICK-TCHICKY-TCHICK.
A CLOSER INSPECTION REVEALS: The "MUSICIANS" are DEAD. So are
the "PEDESTRIANS". Flesh is rotting off their bones. The town
itself, which at first looked so perfect, is ROTTING TOO.
MIKE (O.S.)
They're trying to be us.
RILEY (O.S.)
They used to be us.

RILEY
(Worried) They're learning how to be
us again.
RILEY DENBO watches the town through binoculars. 32, made
rugged by realities, he has a heart beneath his tough
exterior. MIKE CONVERSE, 21, young and unseasoned, has the
eagerness and passion of someone young and unseasoned.
MIKE
o way. Some germ or some devil got
them things up and walkin'. But
there's a big difference between
them and us. They're dead!

DEAD TEENAGE COUPLE walks hand-in-hand near the gas pumps
of a defunct TEXACO STATION. The boy steps on the little hose
that BINGS when a car pulls in. Out of the building comes...
...AN ATTENDANT. It was once tall and handsome. Now his face
is a wrinkled map of death. He has lost its left arm. Dried
blood darkens the shoulder of its jump-suit, where the arm
was torn away. A "TEXACO" PATCH tells us the Thing used to
work here. Embroidery tells us his nickname was once "BIG
DADDY". He goes to the pump and removes the nozzle. Turns, as
if searching for a car to fill with gas. There is none.
MIKE (O.S.)
It's like they're pretending to be
alive.

RILEY
Isn't that what we're doing, son?
Pretending to be alive?

THE SOUND OF GROANING WOOD as THREE heavily-armed GUERILLAS
push a large CRATE over a PRECIPICE into a deep GARBAGE PIT
below. FIVE SIMILAR CRATES lie amid the rubble.
Insects BUZZ. RATS crawl. HUMAN SKELETONS, most HEADLESS, lie
everywhere, no flesh left on their bones. Those with heads
show various wounds to their skulls. Except for one, which...
...suddenly, startlingly MOVES! Its bony arm reaches up from
the bottom of the pit toward...
(
4.
...CHOLO DeMORA, a Latino in his 20s, handsome, roguish, and
confident...a bit too confident. He reaches over his shoulder
and unstraps a CROSSBOW.
CHOLO
Poor bastard.
WFFFFT! Cholo shoots the skeleton. His arrow goes completely
through the WHITE SKULL.

The doors of a beat-up WHITE MOVING VAN open. Cholo reaches
in, throwing back an oilcloth that covers ANOTHER CRATE.
GUERILLA
Whole lotta trash this week.
CHOLO
That's life, brother. A whole
lotta trash.
As the men tip the crate onto a dolly, MAGGOTS are revealed
in the darkness beneath, squirming in a POOL OF BLOOD.
(What's in that crate?)

RILEY and MIKE watch THREE DEAD THINGS lumber toward them
R
from the town below.
ILEY
They know we're here. They can
smell life. Smell blood.

THROUGH THE BINOCULARS: BIG DADDY replaces the nozzle in the
gas pump. Sensing something, it looks around. Up. His dead
eyes lock on Riley's. Big Daddy grunts. Responding to him...

...the THREE DEAD THINGS move up the hillside with more
determination.
RILEY
Glancing at Mike's guns) You any

MIKE
Dunno. It's my first trip. Never
had to use `em before.

RILEY
Great. I'm out here with a guy who
can't shoot. Let's go.
Mike stands, turns, and...
...is GRABBED from behind by a ZOMBIE! It's not one of the
three they've been watching. This one wears the remains of a
CLOWN SUIT. Half its bulbous red nose has been eaten away.
Painted eyelashes make its stare alarming. Its ORANGE HAIR is
crawling with SPIDERS. It wrestles Mike to the ground. Opens
its lipsticked mouth. Is about to bite Mike's neck when...
...Riley FIRES his .45. BLAM! A bullet SHATTERS the Clown's
SHOULDER CAP. The dead thing is pitched backward, but seems
to feel no pain. It hunkers over Mike again.
iley FIRES four more times. THREE BULLETS RIP into the
Clown's CHEST, NECK, CHEEK. Finally, the FOURTH PUNCHES A
HOLE above the thing's left eyebrow. The Clown DROPS.

IKE

...RILEY, CHARLIE, and MIKE step out of A VEHICLE the size
of a city bus. The words DEAD RECKONING are painted on its
side. This is no bus. It's a war wagon, built of SCAVENGED
PARTS with a RIVETED STEEL SKIN. GATTLING GUNS protrude from
a MEAN-LOOKING SNOUT. A ROOF TURRET supports two FOURTEEN
INCH-CANNONS. Rotating lights SHINE in all directions,
piercing the night.
THOOMB! THOOMB! THOOMB! That sound again. MORTAR TUBES on the
vehicle's roof are launching FIREWORKS that BURST in the sky.
CHARLIE
(Looking up) `Flowers in the
graveyard'. Why do you call `em
that, Riley? I don't get it. These
here flowers ain't the kind you lay
down on the ground. These here are
sky flowers. Way up in Heaven.
R
ILEY
I love ya, Charlie. Know why?
Cuzz you still believe in heaven.
THE WHITE MOVING VAN rolls in and parks beside Dead Reckoning.
CHOLO jumps out with the THREE GUERILLAS from the dump.
HOLO
You guys scope out the town?
RILEY
Looks like nobody's hit it before.
FOUR GUERILLAS get into an old T-BIRD CONVERTIBLE mounted with
machine guns. TWO OTHER ARMED MEN climb onto MOTORCYCLES. The
very night seems to GROWL as everyone starts their engines.
HOLO
Ready?
CHARLIE
Always ready. Just look at me
ou can tell I'm always ready.
CHOLO
I look at you, all I see's an idiot.
CHARLIE
I don't think that's all you see.
bet you see this iron, too.
R

Charlie is wearing four holstered sidearms, two shouldered
automatic rifles, a REMINGTON...and a sly smile that makes us
wonder whether he's an idiot or not.
CHOLO
Let's go have some fun.
RILEY
Ain't about fun, Cholo.
VROOOM! The T-Bird and the motorcycles pull out toward town.
ILEY
We go in, do our job, and get out,
all of us alive, okay? I don't want
any fuck-ups on my last day out here.
C
HOLO
(Grinning) My last day, too.
iley looks surprised. Cholo mounts a MOTORCYCLE, REVS the
engine, and heads out.
CHOLO (CONT'D)
YEEEE-HAAAAAAAA!
CHARLIE
What'd he do, hit the lottery or
somethin'?
RILEY
Somethin'. (Wondering) Somethin'.
Riley and Charlie start to get back into Dead Reckoning. Mike
follows, pausing to look up at the "sky flowers".
MIKE
Do those things really work?
RILEY
Yup. (Almost sadly) Stenches can't
take their eyes off `em.

12
DEAD THINGS stand completely frozen in the middle of main
street, like statues, mesmerized by the FIREWORKS.
Only one figure is moving. BIG DADDY. He weaves between his
brothers and sisters, urgently waving his one good hand,
like Frankenstein's monster, as if to say "Bad! Bad!" He has
learned that fireworks bring danger.
R
C
9.
A DEAD TEENAGE CHEERLEADER, holding filthy pom-poms, looks at
Big Daddy, unable to grasp what he's trying to communicate.
A SPEAR is DRIVEN through the Cheerleader's face! The spear
is held like a lance by HARRY, a guerilla who roars past on
his motorcycle hooting like a cowhand on round-up. Other
BIKERS rumble down the street, firing guns.
Big Daddy watches the Cheerleader fall. It throws its head
back and lets out a great HOWL.
14
14
...DEAD RECKONING, mortars still shooting FIREWORKS, stops on
the edge of town. CHOLO pulls up alongside on his bike.
16
16
THE WHITE MOVING VAN pulls up to a supermarket. THE DEAD
THINGS in the parking lot, gazing at the FIREWORKS, barely
notice the vehicle. MARKSMEN keep the lot covered as
GUERILLAS carry CASES OF CANNED GOODS out of the supermarket
and into the van. The team has this down to a science.
ILEY'S VOICE comes over one Guerilla's hand-held radio.
RILEY (O.S. RADIO FILTER)
How's the food?
GUERILLA #1
(Into his radio) Lousy, but there's
lots of it.

DEAD RECKONING RUMBLES down a side street, its steel skin
reflecting the FLASH of fireworks.

UERILLAS load boxes of ammo into a JEEP.

HARRY, the biker with the spear, is making another run toward
a WALKER, who stands mesmerized by the fireworks, when...
WHAP! Harry is sent FLYING!
DEAD WOMAN, once pretty, wearing a softball uniform that
bears the NUMBER NINE, has used its bat to hit a home run.
Harry's riderless motorcycle fishtails up the street and hits
the side of a building.
arry tries to get up. TWO DEAD THINGS attack him. Another
motorcycle, driven by ANCHOR, who looks like Popeye, RUMBLES
up in the nick of time.
ANCHOR
Harry, jump on!
Fighting off the Dead Things, Harry gets on and speeds away.
...CHOLO and MIKE, on Cholo's bike, joining up with FOXY, a
red-haired guerilla on his own motorcycle. The three drive
toward the end of town.
RILEY (O.S.)
What the fuck?
23
23
CHOLO SCREECHES to a stop at a LIQUOR STORE with MIKE and
FOXY. All dismount and start toward the entrance. They stop
as DEAD RECKONING pulls up and RILEY and CHARLIE climb out.
CHARLIE
Nothin' in there but booze. Booze
ain't essential.
FOXY
A jug of good Kentucky goes for
fifteen hundred back in town.
RILEY
(To Cholo) I'm not risking anybody's
ass just so you can pick up some
side money.
R
12.
CHOLO
Not askin' you to.
Cholo and Foxy start into the liquor store. The doors are
wide open. All that can be seen from outside is darkness.
ILEY
Mike! Wait!
But Mike has followed the others inside.

THE WHITE MOVING VAN, THE T-BIRD, AND THE JEEP roll out of
town in a convoy. Trailing them, THREE SADISTIC GUERILLAS on
MOTORCYCLES ROAR past, firing...
...a HAIL OF BULLETS at A DEAD FAMILY on the sidewalk. The
MOTHER FALLS. Not shot. It has been GRABBED and SHOVED down
to the ground by...
...BIG DADDY! Who GRABS the little GIRL next, thrusting her
roughly behind the protection of a wrecked car. The FATHER is
last. Big Daddy grabs it from behind, by its hair, just as...
...ROUNDS from an UZI DRILL A DOTTED-LINE across the Father's
neck. Big Daddy is unhurt, but spattered with BLOOD. Not red,
greenish-black. The blood of the dead.
T
here's a RIPPING SOUND as the Father's NECK is PULLED APART
by the weight of its limp body. The body DROPS to the street.
The HEAD remains suspended in Big Daddy's hand. His face
contorts. His mouth opens and closes, trying to utter sounds.
ig Daddy drops the head, looking down at its befuddled eyes
with sympathy. After a moment, the sympathy is joined by
rage. Big Daddy lifts his right foot and brings it STOMPING
DOWN on the disembodied head, CRUSHING ITS SKULL.
The convoy ROARS off, leaving a cloud of exhaust. Big Daddy
sees Harry's downed motorcycle lying in the street. The butt
of an AUTOMATIC RIFLE protrudes from a saddlebag.
Big Daddy goes over. Pulls out the rifle. Tests the weight of
it in his hand. Curls his finger in through the guard and
pulls the trigger.
BLAM! A bullet ricochets off a brick wall. Big Daddy is
startled at first. Then, he relaxes, realizing the rifle's
power. With surprising dexterity, he slings the weapon's
strap over his head and across his chest, patting the strap
as if comforted by it. Turning, he looks toward...
...THE DISTANT GLOW OF A SKYSCRAPER that can be seen ON THE
HORIZON. That's the direction the convoy is headed. That's
where the bad men came from. That's where he wants to go.
REVERSE ANGLE:
With the city in the distance, Big Daddy starts walking.
NUMBER NINE falls into step beside him. Soon there are MORE.
None of them knows where they are going. Or why. All that
seems to matter is that they have a leader.
15.

DEAD RECKONING, emitting tendrils of HOT STEAM from twenty
steel nostrils, stands parked in a corner of a fenced-in
outdoor yard. (We don't see how big the yard is. Yet.) A
SEARCHLIGHT sweeps the darkness as GUERILLAS unload the
supplies they took from Uniontown and carry them toward...
...a set of RUSTY STEEL DOORS, above which is a FADED SIGN
that reads "SUBWAY (TO CITY)".
In the bustle of activity, HARRY, the biker who was attacked
in town, perspires as he helps unload. He looks ill.
RILEY walks past, handing out bottles of beer to the men.
RILEY
Harry. Beer?
Harry doesn't answer.
RILEY (CONT'D)
Harry?
Harry SPINS! GROWLS! LUNGES at Riley like a beast!
Riley has no time to reach for his gun. The Harry-Thing is
strangling him. SMASHING the neck of a beer bottle on the
snout of Dead Reckoning, Riley JAMS THE JAGGED GLASS into
the Harry-Thing's forehead. Its body drops to the ground.
PRETTY BOY
Got knocked off his bike in town.
Must have been bit.
Riley looks down at the body with a mixture anger and regret.
RIVERS flank a TRIANGLE OF LAND where A CITY glows in the
sunrise. Once proud and prosperous, its buildings now seem
like tombstones. SEVEN BARRICADED BRIDGES span the rivers.
ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
Protected on three sides by mighty
rivers, the city stands as a monument
to man's ingenuity. At the center of
it all is Fiddler's Green.

In live action, not on the
monitor, WEARY TROOPS, sloppily
uniformed, guard four rows
of electrified, barbed-wire FENCING.
DEAD THINGS cluster by the
DOZENS outside the barricades.
M
CORPSES hang all along the
stretch, suspended on the barbs.
ILITARY WOMAN
Stench! Ten o-clock!
A WALKER lumbers in and touches the fencing. SPARKS FLY! The
Thing's flesh is literally COOKED! BOILS develop, POPPING
OPEN, emitting SMOKE. Still the Thing remains animated.
MILITARY MAN
Take its fuckin' face off.
UDDA-BUDDA-BUDDA! The Military Woman FIRES. The Thing is
decimated. Its body hangs, welded to the SPARKING barbs.

32
FIDDLER'S GREEN, a heavily protected HIGH-RISE in the center
of the city, dominates the skyline. It's where the Fat Cats
live, protected from urban decay. The building is surrounded
by unoccupied high-rises that define "the golden triangle", a
clean section in the center of the city. No ugliness in view.
RILEY and CHARLIE cross a manicured plaza to a CHECKPOINT
manned by TWO SECURITY GUARDS. Riley hands over his ID.
RILEY
Quittin' time, Deke.
SECURITY GUARD
(Holding up the ID) You're gonna
need this.
RILEY
(Walking on) Nope. When I said
quittin' time, I meant quittin'
time.
33
33
RILEY and CHARLIE walk down a street into the city's "ghetto"
zone, which is lined with taverns, gambling clubs, strip
joints, like a boom town from Alaskan gold-rush days. BUYERS
and SELLERS lurk in the shadows, copulating, dealing drugs.
iley is welcomed by nearly everyone he passes, greeting
them in return with a smile and a nod, handing some bills to
a FATHER with a YOUNG SON, patting an OLD MAN on the back.
CHARLIE
Wanna get a drink, Riley? Just
ook at me, you can tell I could
use a drink.
RILEY
Later. Gotta see a man about a car.
(
20.
Charlie follows Riley, who strides into...
...an alley, surprised to find a cadre of rough-looking
REVOLUTIONARIES, led by MULLIGAN, a defiant man who stands
on a soapbox. A small audience is gathered in front of him.
He takes a swig from a bottle of whiskey.
MULLIGAN
Irish accent) How long are you
gonna let him push you around? If
there was enough of us...if you all
would join up with us...we could
pull him down off his throne!
Some of the people in the audience nervously shift their eyes
to the FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE ten blocks away.
RILEY
You can't fix a place like this,
Mulligan. You just have to get out
of it.
MULLIGAN
We've got the firepower, Riley. If
you and your friends would come in
with us, we'd be unstoppable.
Mulligan holds out his bottle to Riley, who passes it to
Charlie, who takes a swig.
RILEY
Everyone's stoppable.
We hear the sound of a boy coughing. Mulligan's son BRIAN
stands behind him, looking feverish.
MULLIGAN
You alright, son?
BRIAN
I'm fine, dad.
As Riley starts past, he stops, pulls something from his
pocket, and presses it into Mulligan's palm.
RILEY
Antibiotics. For your boy.
Mulligan looks down with gratitude at a bottle his hand.
When he looks up again, Riley is gone.

Turning a corner, RILEY and CHARLIE stop in front of a
rundown GARAGE with a tarp hanging down instead of a door.
Riley pulls it aside and looks in. A HOBO lies asleep on a
grease-stained floor, curled under some old newspapers.
RILEY
Where's the car?
OBO
(Waking) What car?
RILEY
My new car. I paid for it. I was
here yesterday. There were two guys
getting it ready for me.
OBO
There was nobody here this morning.
RILEY
Sonofabitch!
CHARLIE
What happened, Riley. Didja get
fucked?
Riley stands there, grim-faced.
RILEY
(A whisper) Come on.
43
43
RILEY RIPS off part of his shirt-sleeve and starts to bandage
the wound on SLACK'S arm. They are in a jail cell that has
brick walls and a small barred window facing a dark alley.
CHARLIE, stripped of all his guns, stares outside longingly.
RILEY
(To Slack) Why you? In that arena.
Why did the little fat man throw
you in with those things?
SLACK
It wasn't the little man. It was the
big man. The man upstairs. He's got
his fingers in everything down here.
If you can drink it, shoot it up,
fuck it, or gamble on it, it belongs
to him. He's just seein' that we get
a few cheap kicks so we don't go
thinkin' too hard about why he's
eating steak and the rest of us are
lucky to get the bones.
RILEY
Same question. Why you?
SLACK
They found out I was working with
Mulligan and his people. Tired of
eatin' off Cbones.
HARLIE
What can you do? Every place is the
same.
RILEY
Places with people. I'm gonna find
me a place where there ain't no
people. North. Canada.
SLACK
Wherever you're going, take me
ith you.
CHARLIE
He won't. Riley likes to be alone.
He might take me. Cuzz havin' me
around is pretty much the same as
bein' alone. (Glancing at Riley)
can make myself useful. And I
an shoot.
C
S
34.
SLACK
I can shoot. And I can be pretty
fucking useful. I had training. I
was gonna join the Army. Up the
Green. Till somebody figured I'd be
a better hooker than a soldier.
RILEY
I don't need to hear your story.
Everybody's got a story, and I'm
tired of hearin' them all!
SLACK
What's your story, Riley?
They look at each other, clearly attracted.
R
ILEY
I said everybody has a story. That
was wrong. I don't have one. Daddy
was a preacher. Mama kept the
house. School. Engineering. Nothing
bad ever happened to me...(turning
away)...till everything changed.
LACK
Everything changed for all of us.
Whether we had a story or not.
A SOUND outside the window. Charlie glances through the bars.
CHARLIE
Hey...
Riley and Slack look out the window. FOUR SECURITY MEN are
chasing MULLIGAN into the alley outside. They drive him like
an animal against a wall, club him, and drag him away.
RILEY
Mulligan.
RILEY instinctively reaches through the window's bars, but
there's nothing he can do. It's a helpless feeling.
HARLIE
What are they gonna do? Kill him?
SLACK
Not right away. First, they'll try
to get what they can out of him.
About people like me.
Riley puts his hand on her back.

CRANE DOWN FROM A FADED SIGN, TONY'S AUTOMANIA, high above
what was once a car dealership, but is now a fenced-in DEPOT
full of VEHICLES. A huge WHITE FACE with black cartoon eyes
POPS into view, attached to a TEN-FOOT-TALL BODY emblazoned
TONY BALONEY. It's one of those vinyl ADVERTISING DUMMIES
that does the hula as air pumps through it. Tony's arms wave
wildly, like a giant zombie, comic yet oddly unnerving as...
BLAM! BLAM! Bullets hit it in the face and neck. GUS, a young
soldier, and his partner BARRETT, are shooting outside the
SALES OFFICE of the car-lot-turned-depot. A sign is printed
on the window. "BEST DEALS IN TOWN AND THAT'S NO BALONEY!"
B
ARRETT
(Handing Gus a five) You win. You
got him in the brain.
47
47
The steel doors under the "SUBWAY" sign open and CHOLO strides
out with his TEAM. A DEPOT GUARD steps forward as the doors
close and lock automatically behind them.
DEPOT GUARD
What's up, Cholo?
CHOLO
(Flashing an official-looking
paper) Takin' the truck out.
36.
DEPOT GUARD
You just got back in this morning.
CHOLO
Nobody gets a day off these days.
DEPOT GUARD
(Taking Cholo's paper) Hey, wait a
minute this is from yesterday.
CHOLO
(Keeping his cool) Oh, I must have
given you the wrong one. Here...
Cholo reaches down, but not into his pocket. For his gun.
Just before he draws it...SHOTS ring out.
CHOLO (CONT'D)
What's that?
DEPOT GUARD
Relax. Just target practise.
48
48
GUS
Double or nothing?
BARRETT
Sure.
GUS aims his rifle at the jerking head of TONY BALONEY. As he
is about to fire, there's a SOUND at his back.
GUS
Quit scratching around back there.
You're tryin' ta fuck up my aim.
BARRETT
I'm just standin' here. I'm not
doin' nothing.
The SOUND comes again. From the woods that adjoin the lot.
Barrett grabs the handles of a KLIEG LIGHT mounted on a pivot
and swings it so that it ILLUMINATES the tree-line.
T
here's nothing there. Nothing but BRANCHES being slapped by
erratic gusts of wind.
Barrett pivots the Klieg light back to its original position,
jumping out of his skin when the bright white beam reveals...
A DEAD THING within arm's length.
5
37.
Barrett FIRES! The dead thing DROPS OUT OF FRAME, REPLACED BY
ANOTHER. BLAM! Barrett SHOOTS again. This creature collapses.
It is also replaced by another, which is also shot, as...
BLAM! The top of Barrett's head is taken off by a rifle shot.
The rifle was fired by BIG DADDY. The barrel is still smoking.
In the darkness behind him stands NUMBER NINE. Behind Number
Nine are the SHUFFLING SHADOWS of many more dead things.
GUS SCREAMS.
49
49
CHOLO
What's that? Screaming practice?
GUNNER (O.S.)
Stenches! Jesus! They're all over
the place!
THE DEPOT GUARD turns and runs toward his men. CHOLO'S TEAM
unstraps weapons and gets ready for battle.
CHOLO
(Stopping them) Ain't our fight.
Stenches are making it easy for us.
C
Let's grab the truck.
HOLO and his team sprint across the lot to DEAD RECKONING.
A GUNNER at a machine-gun battery opens fire on the WALKERS.
Many of the rounds SPARK off the wire fencing.

THE WALKING DEAD march through MACHINE GUN FIRE behind their
"leader". BIG DADDY. He is the first to reach the fence
surrounding the lot. Pushing against the wire, he is soon
joined by NUMBER NINE. Then OTHERS. The FENCE COLLAPSES. The
Dead Things SWARM into the depot.
VROOOM! DEAD RECKONING pulls out. Rumbling over the section
of fencing the zombies pushed down, it drives into the night.
K
38.
SOLDIERS abandon their stations and scatter, shooting wildly.
NUMBER NINE knocks one of them cold with its baseball bat.
The soldier falls, losing his M-16. BIG DADDY grabs the bat
and throws it aside. Picking up the soldier's M-16, he
presses the weapon into Number Nine's hands, even arranging
Number Nine's fingers on the trigger.
RATATATAT. With the gun aimed at the ground, Number Nine
fires a BURST that sends her into a spastic dance. The
soldier sits back up. Draws a pistol. Big Daddy grabs the
barrel of the still-firing M-16 and guides it along the
pavement to...
...the soldier's legs. Bullets march up his groin, belly,
chest, and, finally, head. He drops.
ANOTHER SOLDIER attacks. This time, Number Nine aims her
weapon purposefully and scores a direct hit.
OTHER DEAD THINGS SMACK at the steel doors that lead down to
the subway. They can't get through. Losing interest, they
drift slowly away, until their attention is refocused by...
...a GRUNT from Big Daddy, who is gazing toward the GLOW of
the FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE across the river, closer now
than before. The city. That's where he wants to be. That's
where he's determined to go.
57
57
DEAD RECKONING RUMBLES along a dark street, plowing into a
DERELICT CAR, knocking it aside and rolling it down a small
embankment, pinning THREE DEAD THINGS beneath.
59
59
BIG DADDY steps out of the darkness, watching the lights of
DEAD RECKONING recede. He hears desperate SQUEALING coming
from under the toppled car.
He lumbers down the embankment. Pushes on one of the upturned
tires. He can't turn the car by himself. He looks back to the
road. Grunts.
NUMBER NINE and OTHERS OF BIG DADDY'S GATHERING FORCE hurry
to the car. They push. The car rolls over, freeing THE THREE
DEAD THINGS. One of them used to be a BUTCHER. Still wearing
a blood-stained apron, carrying a meat cleaver, he looks at
Big Daddy with something resembling gratitude.
A LONG DOCK juts into the RIVER. DEAD RECKONING stops beside
it. MOUSE jumps out. CHOLO stands in an open hatch.
MOUSE
(Looking around nervously) Don't
leave me alone here long.
CHOLO
At midnight. Give me a call. Let
e know if we're rich or not.
Mouse nods, running off to hide in a BOAT SHED.

The steel doors to the subway tunnel open. RILEY and his TEAM
step out. The depot has been DEVASTATED. FIRES BURNING.
FENCES DOWN. Only TONY BALONEY moves, still waving spookily.
C
HARLIE
Geez. Cholo made a mess.
RILEY
Cholo didn't do all this.
Clouds of thick black SMOKE from the fires BILLOW across the
depot, restricting visibility. Ever-shifting OPENINGS in the

RILEY (CONT'D)
Stenches have been at this place.
He leads the way into the depot, his M-16 at the ready.
Behind him, all eyes peer nervously into the smoke. Everyone
speaks in HUSHED tones.
MANOLETE
When the truck pulled out, it must
have knocked the fence down. That's
how they got in.
RILEY
That fencing was pushed in from
outside.
TEAHOUSE
You know how many stenches it
would take to do that?
RILEY
There's a thousand of them out
there for every one of us.
CHARLIE
Good thing we're smarter.
SLACK
Look who's talkin'.
RILEY
They're getting smart. I saw it in
Uniontown, last time out. They're
learning how to work together.
Thoughts darken. So does the SMOKE, which billows thicker,
virtually blinding the team. SOUNDS come. The MOANING of the
WIND. The POPPING of burnt metal and wood.
TEAHOUSE
What do they want?
Slack looks back as she walks. The zombies have taken down
another section of the depot fence, beyond which lies a
suburb. Beyond which is the river. Beyond which is the glow
of the FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE.
SLACK
They want the city.
RILEY
The city is us. They're after us. We
pissed `em off one too many times.

MANOLETE
They'll never get across the river.
CHARLIE
Thank Heaven.
RILEY
Gotta love the guy. He still believes
in Heaven. Anyone got a radio?
Teahouse pulls a Motorola from his belt. Just as he tosses
it to Riley, they hear...GROWLING!
he team draws their weapons, standing in a loose circle,
their backs to each other, guns searching for a target.
Darting eyes peer into the void. MORE NOISES emanate from
somewhere. Everywhere. Slowly...
...Charlie unstraps his Remington. Licks his thumb. Wets the
sight of the rifle.
LACK
(A whisper) Why do you do that?
CHARLIE
(Whispering back) Catches the
light. Right now it's moonlight.
Lets me see where I'm aimin'.
BLAM! Charlie FIRES! A single shot into the black smoke.
SLACK
The hell you shooting at?
CHARLIE
That thing.
A
DEAD MAN steps out of the smoke! Before anyone can react, it
grabs Slack's shoulder from behind! She whirls around. Pulls
away. Is about to shoot when she sees AN ENTRY WOUND on the
left side of the Thing's forehead.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
ff-center. But I got him.
The Thing relaxes its grip and drops at Slack's feet.
ANOLETE
(Hysterical) There's more of `em out
there. I can hear `em. THERE'S MORE!
There are SHUFFLING SOUNDS in the smoke. Manolete backs away.
Pillsbury grabs him. Slaps him, hard, across the face.

PILLSBURY
If they is more, we gonna need

wid us, like de man you ain't.
Riley lifts Teahouse's Motorola and pushes "Send".
RILEY
Riley Denbo. Calling the Green.
64

RILEY and his TEAM move through DRIFTING SMOKE. VEHICLES are
scattered about. They stop at the T-BIRD. There are no keys
in the ignition.
CHARLIE
Gotta go get the keys, Riley.
iley looks across the lot to the CHARRED RUIN of a shack.
Tire fires BURN around it. Debris smolders.
RILEY
Ain't no keys to get. Melted.
ANOLETE
Screw keys. Hot wire the fucker.
MANOLETE climbs in and goes to work under the dash.
PILLSBURY
H

Suddenly, CHARLIE draws his .45 and FIRES AT SLACK! BLAM! The
bullet buzzes just above her ear, blowing a WISP OF HAIR as...

48.
...A DEAD OLD MAN BEHIND HER DROPS, a HOLE in its head.
LACK
Thanks, Charlie. That was useful.
The WIND shifts and black SMOKE envelopes them.
MANOLETE
I can't see!
Riley pulls out a flashlight and shines it under the dash.
he team fans out around the T-Bird. The smoke is so thick
they can't make out anything. Including each other.
harlie peers into openings that shift on the breeze. What
he doesn't see, what he can't see, is what's behind him...
..a FEMALE WALKER, wearing the soiled and tattered remnants
of a bridal gown. The fabric seems to glow in the smoke.
The bride shuffles toward CHARLIE. We see it coming. No one
else does. Just as it opens its mouth to bite...
BLAM! Slack SHOOTS! Her bullet cuts closer than the one
Charlie fired, CLIPPING OFF THE TOP OF HIS EAR before
DROPPING THE BRIDE.
SLACK
Even-Steven.
CHARLIE
Not! That hurt! I didn't hurt you!
Manolete fumbles with colored wires under the dash.
RILEY
Hurry up.
PILLSBURY
(Impatient) Yellow to red!
TEAHOUSE
What the fuck does a Samoan know
about hot-wiring cars?
PILLSBURY
Five thousand cars. Stole. Every
year in Samoa.
MANOLETE
Fifty thousand in Mexico.
R
49.
PILLSBURY
Mexico got a million cars. Samoa got
five thousand. Every one. Stolen.
THE T-BIRD'S ENGINE REVS.
MANOLETE
I GOT IT! LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!
Riley leads the team into the T-Bird. Manolete starts to get
out from under the dash. As TEAHOUSE settles into a seat by
the door...
...SOMETHING heavy and wet SMACKS his shoulder. It's a
FOREARM! It drops onto Teahouse as if thrown at him.
TEAHOUSE
God! Oh, GOD, WHAT'S THIS?!
Teahouse HURLS the bloody thing onto the asphalt. Shockingly,
the ARM SPRINGS BACK, THUMPING against Teahouse's face! A
twist of torn muscle, no thicker than clothesline, is keeping
the limb loosely attached to...
...A DEAD THING that has crawled beside the T-Bird. Lifting
itself, it BITES a large filet out of Teahouse's arm. CHARLIE
M
SHOOTS it.
anolete climbs up behind the wheel and...VROOOOOM!...pedal
to the metal he pulls out of the depot. Slack glances at
Teahouse, then, wind in her hair, leans in close to Riley.
SLACK
(Softly) How long does he have?
RILEY
I had a brother. Real brother, by
birth. Bit. Hung on for six days.
Before he turned. I was the one had
to shoot him.
SLACK
And you said nothin' bad ever
happened to you.
RILEY
That happened to my brother.
SLACK
(Into his eyes) But you kept going.

Got to, right?

Slack turns to Teahouse.
LACK (CONT'D)

She draws her .45, aims at Teahouse, and FIRES.

n an overgrown suburban street, a LAWN TRACTOR, driven by a
GARDENER in work clothes, drives back and forth, back and
forth, over a swath of dead grass. The gardener is DEAD too.

68
ANGLE ON: A SOLID WALL OF WOOD. BIG DADDY, NUMBER NINE, and
OTHERS OF THE DEAD push against it. The wood holds.
Big Daddy turns, surveying his troops. Focusing on the
BUTCHER. On the meat cleaver it has in its hand.
Big Daddy pounds on the wood, demonstrating. Points at the
meat cleaver. Pounds again. The Butcher gets it. Approaches
the wall.
HACK! The meat cleaver chops into wood, splintering it.
REVERSE ANGLE: from the other side of the wall as the wood
splinters to reveal BIG DADDY'S EYES staring through at...
...the FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE, looming closer than it was
before, though it's still across the river.

CLOSE ON: a small, electronic unit, the size and appearance
of a "Game Boy". AN LED SCREEN shows a BLINKING RED DOT
moving along a MAP.
RILEY (O.S.)
Turn left up here.
SLACK, driving the T-BIRD now, makes the turn. The car blows
through a deserted town, moving fast. Riley notices that
Slack is effected by the desolation she sees.
ILEY
How long since you been out here?
SLACK
Never been out. Lived in the city
since...it was a regular city.
ILEY
Pull over.
SLACK
(Surprised) Huh?
RILEY
You said you were going to make
yourself useful. Right now what I
could use is for you to pull over.
he does. The T-Bird stops along a road bordered by a MARSH
thick with tall CAT TAILS. Unexpectedly, Riley stands and
points his automatic at PILLSBURY and MANOLETE.
RILEY
I made a deal with your boss. Find
Cholo. I'm gonna do it. Keep him from
blowing up the Green. I'm gonna do
it, I don't want people to get hurt.
Bring back Dead Reckoning... Sorry.
That's where I stop. I didn't ask him
for much, just guns, ammo, and a car.
I've got the guns. I've got the ammo.
And if I find Dead Reckoning I'm
gonna have the best fucking car
that's ever been built, and I'm
taking it to Canada. If any of you
don't like that idea...
Riley reaches down and opens the passenger door. Manolete
looks out and sees the CAT TAILS MOVING. THREE WALKERS are
slogging through the marsh.
C
R
R
54.
MANOLETE
Some choice.
PILLSBURY
G
ood choice. I like see Canada.
Pillsbury reaches out and slams the car door closed again.
ILEY
Charlie, keep these two covered.
Charlie pulls his .45.
Riley turns around his seat, glancing down again at the "Game
Boy" in his palm. The RED DOT has moved on to ANOTHER MAP.
RILEY (CONT'D)
Take a right onto Route Six.
Slack pulls out.
SLACK
This is what you were thinking
about all along. You got me out
here figuring I'm a boy scout, and
now you're telling me we're just
stealing a fucking car?
ILEY
You have a problem with that?
SLACK
No. I like the way you think.
HARLIE
I like the way he thinks, too.
Just look at me you can tell I
like the way he thinks.
RILEY
Take another right.
SLACK
How do you know which way you're
going?
Riley holds up the "Game Boy". It BEEPS SOFTLY as the RED DOT
shifts onto another MAP.
RILEY
I built a homing device into Dead
Reckoning. If Cholo's anywhere within
fifty miles, we can track him.
55.
70
70
DEAD RECKONING stops on a long road, at the end of which
stands...
...a MILITARY COMPLEX. THE BEAM of a SEARCHLIGHT sweeps back
and forth over the buildings, a sign of life.
74
74
SLACK drives as RILEY monitors his "Game Boy".
RILEY
Shit. He's going to Ross Park.
SLACK
What's there?
RILEY
Powder magazine. Where they keep
the big boomers. Rockets. For Dead
Reckoning's cannons.
56.
CRANE UP TO REVEAL:
...AN ARMY OF THE DEAD LINING THE RIVERBANK FOR AS FAR AS THE
EYE CAN SEE.
CLOSE ON: BIG DADDY. Only the river now flows between he and
his goal: FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE, so near and yet so far.
76
76
77
77
PRETTY BOY eases the vehicle up the road to the complex of
buildings: ROSS PARK, a sprawling munitions depot.
The searchlight continues to sweep across the night, but NO
ONE is manning it. It's mounted to an automatic rotator on
the roof of the main building.
FOXY
Looks like no one's here.
The gates stand wide open. There's no sign of life.
CHOLO punches a button. The SIDE HATCH HISSES OPEN.
CHOLO
Foxy. You're elected. Get out there
and see what the fuck.
Foxy moves out through the open hatch.
CHOLO (CONT'D)
Somebody go out and help.
SCAR grabs his weapons.
SCAR
I'll go.
78
78
ONE OF THE DEAD TOPPLES face first into the water, dropping
out of sight. ANOTHER FALLS. BIG DADDY looks at the spot
where his brothers fell in. He looks for a long time, cocking
his head like a puppy trying to understand a high wind.
The first Dead Thing slowly rises out of the water. Then the
Second. They stand, waist deep, in the shallows.
Big Daddy gazes down at the water, a concept dawning. Then,
with grim purpose, he steps deliberately off the low wall.
Hitting the river, he manages to stay on his feet. Standing,
waist deep, with the others, he scoops up water with his one
good hand. Sniffs it. Tastes it.
He looks up. Sees the CITY LIGHTS REFLECTED ON THE RIVER. He
tries to express his thoughts. All that comes from his mouth
is a series of inarticulate moans. He's incapable of
transmitting his idea. So he does what he's been doing since
Uniontown. He leads. He walks toward the city. Out of the
shallows. Into deep water. Over his head.
58.
The car speeds down the road with SLACK at the wheel.
83
83
The unmanned SEARCHLIGHT scans the yard, casting intermittent
shadows.
SCAR
This place is important. The men
here wouldn't just walk out.
FOXY
Maybe they had no choice.
FOXY and SCAR move toward a large STORAGE BUILDING where a
door swings in the night breeze, SLAPPING alarmingly against
the wall. Beyond the opening is a BLACK MAW, like a velvet
curtain, past which nothing can be seen.
FOXY (CONT'D)
There could be stenches in there.
(Readying his M-16) Got a flashlight?
59.
Scar nervously pulls out a flashlight. As he CLICKS on the
BEAM, he loses his grip. The flashlight drops to the ground.
Scar reaches for it. His fingers tip it and it spins. The
beam WASHES across his shoes. Then Foxy's shoes. Then finds...
...ONE OTHER SHOE. Someone else's. Gasping, Scar grabs the
flashlight, shining the beam up onto what should be a leg,
but there's nothing left above its bloody shin.
PLIP! PLOP! PLIP! Beads of BLOOD hit the floor, dropping
from the DARK FIGURE of a SOLDIER who is approaching. Scar
aims the flashlight at the figure's face, recognizing...
SCAR
Brubaker! You okay? Where's the
other guys? What happened here?
Brubaker keeps coming. He has BULLET HOLES in his chest, but
they're not what's dripping blood. It's another half-eaten
FOOT that he's carrying. BRUBAKER IS DEAD. Foxy shoots him.
Foxy and Scar move into a hangar-like space. Pitch black.
Except for the mote-filled BEAM from Scar's flashlight, which
illuminates a supply of enormous cannon shells, lined up on
storage shelves. THE "JOHNSONS".
SIX DEAD SOLDIERS are hunkered in the shadows, EATING the
REMAINS of OTHER DEAD SOLDIERS.
Foxy grimly raises his weapon. As he squeezes the trigger,
the sound of the gunfire OVERLAPS into...
84
84
85
85
THE T-BIRD rumbles along a road lined with large HOMES, once
prized for their panoramic views. RILEY'S "Game Boy" BEEPS.
The display shows the RED DOT moving along a MAP.
RILEY
Cholo's moving out. Looks like he's
heading right for us.
T
S
60.
Riley looks outside. Beyond the homes he can see THE CITY.
RILEY (CONT'D)
hit. Off this hillside...they can
shell the Green. Pull in! There!
SLACK pulls into a driveway, stopping the T-Bird in the
shadow of one of the houses.
RILEY (CONT'D)
hey'll be coming up this road.
ONE HEAD RISES out of the river. It's BIG DADDY, rivulets of
water running down the creases of his face. Another head
rises. And another. NUMBER NINE and the BUTCHER ZOMBIE.
More and more heads break the surface. The water FILLS with
BODIES emerging from the deep. HUNDREDS OF THEM. The CITY
LIGHTS REFLECT off their wet clothes as the ARMY OF THE DEAD
clambers up a boat ramp on the city side of the river.
88
88
RILEY and HIS TEAM wait in the shadows of the driveway they
pulled into. They HEAR the distant GROWL of DEAD RECKONING.
Looking over a hedge-row, Riley can see HIGH BEAMS advancing.
RILEY
(To the Others) Y'all stay here.
SLACK
You're goin' out there alone? You
need our guns.
RILEY
Dead Reckoning's got steel skin an
inch thick. You can't shoot your
way in. I'm hopin' I can talk my
way in.
MANOLETE
He's gonna steal the truck and
leave us here.
61.
CHARLIE
Riley'd never do that. Just look at
him, you can tell he'd never do that.
RILEY
Keep an eye on the hatches. If I
get in, I'll try to leave one open.
Riley takes off. Charlie looks torn. He wants to go with
Riley, but he has to keep PILLSBURY and Manolete covered.
PILLSBURY
I like dat man. You go help `im.
I take care of dis sissy.
Pillsbury, moving fast for a big woman, POUNDS Manolete's
temple with a mighty fist. He drops like a lead weight.
89
89
The door to the roof opens and the GREASY MAN from "downtown"
steps out of a fire stair with ANOTHER GREASY MAN. SUTHERLAND
remains inside the door.
GREASY MAN
I don't know about this. I mean...
leavin' people behind...
SUTHERLAND
Kaufman was gonna leave people
behind. So we're leaving him.
The Greasy Men go trotting across the rooftop. As they climb
into TWO HELICOPTERS, we realize that they are PILOTS.
90
90
RILEY walks down the road. The GROWLING of the diesels is
getting louder, the GLOW from the high-beams brighter. Riley
is startled by a NOISE behind him. He whirls around and sees
CHARLIE approaching.
CHARLIE
Everything's cool back there.
Riley is about to object, when DEAD RECKONING comes rumbling
around a corner a hundred yards down the street. Riley checks
his watch again. 11:52.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Too late to send me back.
62.
RILEY
Put on your Sunday smile. Try to
look friendly.
CHARLIE
I am friendly. Just look at me you
can tell I'm friendly.
92
92
SLACK and PILLSBURY watch from the shadows as a HATCH OPENS.
94
94
SLACK and PILLSBURY creep forward, freezing as they see
RILEY with the crossbow at his neck. Slack aims her K-90 at
CHOLO, RUSTLING branches as she moves.
SLACK
That man pulls the trigger, he's
dead.
With great WHIRRING SOUNDS, the vehicle's largest guns begin
to ROTATE slowly toward the city across the river.
SLACK
We're running out of time here.
C'mon, Riley. Make yourself useful.
MANOLETE begins to stir on the ground beside THE T-BIRD.
98
98
SLACK and PILLSBURY watch THE GUN TURRET continue to turn,
the cannon barrels angling toward FIDDLER'S GREEN.
65.
100
100
The turret stops, cannons aimed directly at the GREEN.
101
101
102
102
MANOLETE pulls one of the MACHINE GUNS out of its mount on
the T-BIRD. Shouldering it, he creeps toward DEAD RECKONING.
104
104
The GUN BARRELS are cold. SILENT.
106
106
...TWO STEEL LOCKING RINGS swing up to cap the cannons. Just
beyond the barrels we see MANOLETE closing in on DEAD
RECKONING, raising his machine gun. A DEAD THING advances
behind him.
107
107
108
108
MANOLETE has the machine gun aimed at DEAD RECKONING'S open
hatch. Where CHOLO is standing.
Out of the corner of his eye, RILEY sees Manolete's machine
gun barrel flash in the moonlight. MANOLETE FIRES! RATATAT!
RILEY PUSHES CHOLO OUT OF THE WAY JUST IN TIME! He drops from
the hatch onto the pavement, wounded in the shoulder.
The Walker starts to rip Manolete apart. Slack SHOOTS HIM in
the head. Then she and PILLSBURY open fire on the Walker,
destroying it.
67.
113
113
SUTHERLAND stands at the edge of the roof, looking down at
what Kaufman just saw.
SUTHERLAND
All this time Kaufman's been
worried about a revolution on the
streets. He never thought it would
come from across the river.
Sutherland, STYLES, OTHER BOARD MEMBERS, and their FAMILIES
get into the TWO HELICOPTERS.
115
115
RILEY jumps out onto the street where CHOLO lies, bleeding
from the top of his left shoulder.
CHOLO
I hate you, Riley. There's
something about you I've always
fucking hated.
RILEY
(Smiling) Same here.
SLACK
Riley. Look out there.
69.
Riley looks where SLACK is pointing. From across the river
comes a flickering ORANGE GLOW.
Riley moves to a spot where he can see between the houses on
the hillside. In the distance, FIRE rises from the city.
Cholo sits up, cackling.
CHOLO
I didn't have to blow the fucking
place up. Somebody else did for me!
RILEY
(Stunned) The stenches. They got
across the river. They got across
the fucking river. (To the others)
Get him inside.
PILLSBURY steps in and lifts Cholo easily to his feet.
CHOLO
Wait, wait, wait. What are we
doin'? Where we goin'?
RILEY
Back to the city.
CHOLO
Not this horse. You got the T-Bird?
I'll take that.
FOXY
Me, too.
FOXY jumps out of DEAD RECKONING and stands at Cholo's side.
Riley, Slack, and Pillsbury climb aboard. Riley looks down at
Cholo and Foxy.
RILEY
You guys'd be safer coming with us.
CHOLO
Nah, you'd never let me have any
fun.
RILEY
T-Bird's down that driveway over
there. Guns and ammo inside.
CHOLO
Thanks.
70.
117
117
CLOSE ON: KAUFMAN staring out his PENTHOUSE WINDOW, aghast.
LICKS OF FIRE reflect on the glass. SOUNDS OF WAR can be
heard from far below.
118
118
In the pristine plaza that surrounds the building, WALKERS
swarm. CITIZENS run, screaming, including SOLDIERS, driven
from their posts, who SHOOT at the Dead Things.
CLOSE ON BIG DADDY. Who looks back and forth, as if torn, at
the FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE, at the violence in the streets,
back at the building, back at the streets. A SOLDIER fires at
him! Misses. Big Daddy raises his rifle and blows him away.
119
119
CHOLO and FOXY run up the road to THE T-BIRD. Seeing a WALKER
lurking ahead, they duck into the dark cover of the trees.
HOLO
I got it.
WFFFFT! Cholo picks off the Walker with his crossbow.
HOLO (CONT'D)
Come on, let's go.
He slaps a hand on Foxy's back.
XCEPT IT'S NOT FOXY! It's ANOTHER WALKER that has moved
between the two men. It grabs the hand that slapped him and
BITES it.
HOLO
AHHH...FUCK!
Foxy, a few yards away, whirls, aiming his gun at the Walker.
Cholo is faster. With no time to reload, in agony, he pulls
a FISTFUL OF ARROWS from his quiver and DRIVES THEM THROUGH
THE WALKER'S FACE AND SKULL. The Walker falls. So does an
ominous silence.
HOLO (CONT'D)
I can't fucking believe it. (A sad
chuckle) Nothin' works out. It's
like...the world is spinning around
and we're just...caught in the
wind. Nothin' works out. Some damn
thing always comes around the
corner and gets you.

72.
Foxy aims his rifle Fat Cholo's forehead. Their eyes connect.
OXY
Your choice.
For a moment, Cholo looks despondent. Then he forces a smile.
CHOLO
No, don't shoot. (A dark chuckle)
always wanted to see how the
other half lives.
Foxy lowers his gun.
CHOLO (CONT'D)
Take the car and get outa here.
FOXY
I'll get outa here. You take the
car.
120
120
EAD RECKONING drives upriver. THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: THE
CITY can be seen BURNING in the distance.
PRETTY BOY
The old J&L;'ll take us over. Right
outside the throat.
121
121
A drawbridge spans the river. Or would span it if it wasn't
open, its rusted metal roadbed rising into the sky.
RILEY'S POV:
A CONTROL BOOTH is built into the superstructure of the
bridge, about fifteen feet off the ground, on DEAD
RECKONING'S side of the river.
73.
123
123
RILEY jumps out of DEAD RECKONING. SLACK is right behind him.
RILEY
Get back in there. What are you
doing?
BLAM! She shoots a WALKER that has come out of the night.
SLACK
Making myself useful.
124
124
CHOLO jumps out of the T-BIRD and runs to the steel doors,
unlocking them with a mag-key.
RILEY ducks under a caution gate at the entrance to the
bridge and starts across the roadway. Behind him...
...SLACK and CHARLIE stand, weapons ready, eyes alert for
danger.
As Riley runs...
...SOMETHING SKITTERS across the road, chasing him. Not a
zombie. Much smaller. A RIVER RAT.
Charlie draws his REMINGTON. Wets the sight with his thumb.
BLAM!
Riley stops running. Looks back to see what's being shot.
SLACK
You missed.
CHARLIE
Nope. I blew its ass off.
The rat is now half a rat. Its ass has been blown off. Yet
IT'S STILL RUNNING!
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Just didn't hit it in the head.
74.
SLACK
(Realizing) Jesus. It's dead.
CHARLIE
They all are.
SKREEEEEEEE! ZOMBIE RATS crawl up onto the roadbed. DOZENS.
Riley takes off away from them. Slack and Charlie hurry
closer, firing, trying to pick the critters off.
The rats reach Riley! Nip at his heels. He leaps. Swings onto
a girder. Climbs to the control booth. The rats don't follow.
Slack heaves a sigh of relief just before...
...SKREEEEEEEE! A second pack of rats scurries toward her!
She vaults over a railing, dropping several feet to...
...the riverbank below. But there are rats here too! Charlie
fires at them from above. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! FUR AND BLOOD
FLY. But there are too many. He can't shoot them all.
128
128
RED LIGHTS on the caution gates BLINK, tinting the night.
The silence is shattered by a LOUD SIREN that ECHOES across
the river. The bridge's roadbed begins to CREAK down slowly.
129
129
THREE DINGHIES lie, upside down, next to the water's edge.
SLACK shoves one into the river, climbing onto its upturned
bottom. She pushes off. The boat doesn't budge. A tether
holds it within inches of the shore.
Slack pulls out a jackknife and goes to cut the rope, but...
...rats SNAP at her hands. Slack recoils, but keeps cutting.
Finally, the rope frays, enough for the boat to pull free.
T
75.
Slack crouches on top of the upturned hull. No way to steer.
No paddles. The current carrying her away.
CHARLIE
Slack!
RILEY bursts out of the booth, only to be confronted by...
...the BRIDGEKEEPER. Drooling. Dead. It grabs Riley, pushing
his head back toward the enormous GEARWORKS of the bridge.
Riley struggles. Bests the creature. Spins him around toward
the gearworks and...
...SSSNIPPPP! THE BRIDGEKEEPER'S HEAD is scissored off! It
drops with a PLUNK into the river below.
131
131
SLACK, adrift on the boat, lies prone at the bow and begins
to paddle with her hands. One of which hits something long
and slimy. It looks like a snake!
But it's not. It's only a moss-covered rope. Slack grabs on.
Pulls hand over hand. It seems to take forever for the rope
to become taut.
A FACE BOBS OUT OF THE WATER!
Slack SCREAMS.
It's the BRIDGEKEEPER'S HEAD, its eyes blinking as it floats
off on the current.
he rope is attached to a stanchion on the opposite shore.
Slack's muscles strain as she pulls on it until...
...her boat reaches the stanchion and she jumps off, finding
herself at the same boat ramp the army of the dead used. The
river has carried her into the very part of the city Riley
and the team were trying to avoid. SCREAMS rise nearby. She's
in the war zone.

THE BRIDGE IS LOWERING SLOWLY. Too slowly. RILEY scrambles
up the incline of the roadbed and calls back to CHARLIE.

ILEY
Bring her over as soon as you can!
Charlie pops back into DEAD RECKONING.
Riley climbs to the top of the descending roadbed and...
...LEAPS across the narrowing gulf to the other side.
He lands. Falls. Rolls. Gets to his feet and runs toward
Slack and the city.

SLACK runs past hysterical PEOPLE toward the FIDDLER'S GREEN
HIGH-RISE. BRIAN, Mulligan's young son, rushes by her in a
panic. Slack grabs him.
SLACK
Brian!
BRIAN
We can't get out! There's no way out!
SLACK
There will be. Come with me.
BRIAN
Daddy! Daddy's still locked up.
Slack runs off with Brian, past a MANHOLE surrounded by
canvas fences, "CAUTION" signs, and flaming OIL POTS. As
MAINTENANCE WORKERS scramble out of the manhole...
...DEAD THINGS close in. The Workers, unarmed, pick up the
ball-shaped pots and BOWL them at the Walkers. As the "balls"
roll, their FIRES SWIRL, making them look like flaming comets.
S
ome of the
pots CRACK OPEN, creating POOLS OF FIRE on the
street. One
of the "balls" remains whole until it smacks
against the
feet of a Walker. Then it opens. And the Walker
is engulfed
in flames.
Big Daddy looks at the Walker with sadness. He lifts his
rifle again and shoots the flaming creature in the head.

Big Daddy walks to the manhole. TOOLS are strewn around it,
pickaxes, sledges, chainsaws, and a pneumatic hammer which is
lying on the street...RATTATATTAT...still running.
Big Daddy looks at the FIDDLER'S GREEN SKYSCRAPER. His goal.
Finally in reach.
He looks down at the pneumatic hammer, and picks it up by the
handle. With the heavy tool vibrating in its hand, Big Daddy
walks toward the building.
He doesn't get very far before the hammer's electrical cord
is pulled out of the extension it's plugged into. The hammer
stops running. Big Daddy looks at it. Puzzles over its
stillness for a moment. Then...
...he looks at the building. At its doors, abandoned by
guards. Doors that are made of glass.
The barrel of an M-16 is planted against Big Daddy's temple
by a MILITIAMAN.
UDDA-BUDDA-BUDDA! The Militiaman FLIES BACK. It wasn't he
who fired. It was NUMBER NINE, standing nearby with her M-16.
The Militiaman lies on the ground, his dead eyes staring at
Number NINE in utter surprise.
Seeing what has happened, ANOTHER SOLDIER grabs a grenade,
pulls the pin, and is about to toss it at Big Daddy when...
...his HAND IS CUT OFF at the wrist by a meat clever held by
THE BUTCHER. The Soldier's hand, still clutching the grenade,
PLOPS into the street. The Soldier looks down in horror, then
collapses on top of his hand. A MUFFLED EXPLOSION makes jelly
of his mid-section.
Big Daddy continues to walk toward the building, carrying the
pneumatic hammer, as OTHER DEAD THINGS collect sledges,
pickaxes, lengths of pipe, and follow their leader.

TH-BOOOOM! The roadbed of the drawbridge drops into place.
VROOOM! DEAD RECKONING rumbles across the span.

ILEY runs out of a line of trees. In the distance, he sees...
...the "THROAT", where much of the CITY'S POPULATION is
trapped, herded by HUNDREDS OF WALKING DEAD against the layers
of electrified fencing that were erected to protect them.
There's no escape. People are being TORN apart and EATEN. The
fencing SPARKS as bodies touch it and are ELECTROCUTED.
Terrible SCREAMS fill the air.

Riley hears the distinctive ROAR of DEAD RECKONING'S engines,
the CLATTER of its treads. He moves toward the sound as...
..a DEAD THING looms three feet away. Riley lifts his pistol
and puts a shell through the thing's skull. Blood flies,
taking on the sudden glow of a halo as it is BACKLIT by...
...the glare of DEAD RECKONING'S approaching headlights. The
dead thing falls to the road, where...
...it is turned to apple butter by Dead Reckoning's enormous
treads. Riley stands right in the vehicle's path.
PRETTY BOY (O.S. LOUDSPEAKER)

...the two fourteen-inch cannons on the vehicle's turrets.
ILEY
We gotta blow the fences!
PRETTY BOY (O.S. LOUDSPEAKER)
Johnson's are loaded!
RILEY
Yeah, but they're capped!
The barrels of the two fourteen-inchers are still capped.
DEAD RECKONING keeps rolling. RILEY climbs out onto one of
the cannon barrels.
WHAM! A WALKER grabs him by the leg from the road. Riley
blasts him with his .45. As OTHER WALKERS approach, he shoots
them with one hand, Rusing the other to uncap the cannon.
ILEY
Number One is clear! I'm going for
Number Two!

living beast, Riley picks some of them of with his .45.

DEAD RECKONING approaches the electrified fences from beyond.
PRETTY BOY (O.S. LOUDSPEAKER)
Get back! Get back! We're gonna

The CROWD screams and starts to clear the area.

The fourteen-incher turns toward the fences. RILEY rides it.

Riley leaps down. The instant he's clear...
KA-BLOOOOOOOOOOOOOM. The ELECTRIFIED FENCES are BLOWN APART.
n the dissipating SMOKE, RILEY is the first one through the
opening. Within seconds, CITIZENS start toward it, heading
the other way. Riley finds himself running against the tide.
Searching. Desperately searching. Behind the surging crowd...
...WALKERS appear, grabbing people. Dropping them to the
ground. Eating them.
iley FIRES in all directions. WALKERS DROP around him. He
saves a WOMAN with a BABY...a YOUNG COUPLE...a PRIEST. CLICK.
He runs out of ammo. WALKERS close in. The situation seems
hopeless until...

PTOOOM! PTOOOM! FIREWORKS "BLOOM" in the sky.
HE DEAD THINGS gaze upward, mesmerized.
THE HUMANS ESCAPE.
RILEY finds himself standing in the midst of FIFTY WALKERS,
frozen like statues around him.
Other than the intermittent BOOM of the fireworks, SILENCE.
Out of which...
SLACK (O.S.)
(A whisper) Riley.
Riley turns.
Slack emerges from behind one of the immobile dead things.
Riley moves toward her...
...she to him...
...both of them weaving a cautious path between the statues.
They reach each other and embrace, surrounded by dead things
that don't even know they are there.
RATATATATATAT. GUNFIRE EXPLODES around them!
86.
HAPLESS DEAD THINGS are MOWED DOWN the way they were back
in Uniontown. This time by...
...MULLIGAN and his REVOLUTIONARIES...who slaughter every
zombie in the area. BRIAN is shooting, too, raring to go.
When it's all over...
MULLIGAN
We could still use you, Riley.
Riley looks out at the city, where there is still scattered
distant gunfire. He looks at Brian, standing at Mulligan's
side, his innocent face speckled with the blood of the dead.
Riley shakes his head.
RILEY
It's all yours, Mulligan.

FIREWORKS EXPLODE. A ZOMBIE looks up toward the "blooms". A
strong hand grabs the collar of its shirt, pulls its gaze
away from the sky, and herds it onward.
The hand is BIG DADDY'S. He herds OTHERS along, too. A small
group of TWO DOZEN, including NUMBER NINE and the BUTCHER.

One of the GATTLING GUNS RATCHETS into position, taking aim
