      A TAN MOM and her TAN DAUGHTER in matching velour sweat-suits 
      emerge from the salon, smiling.                               (FIRST DRAFT) 12/28/20102.


                                  TESSA (V.O.)
                    They re shuffling out of the 
                    tanning salons in their mani-pedi 
                      flip-flops, with their ever-present 
                    daughters and enormous frozen 
                    coffee drinks...



      A BEAT UP U-HAUL barrels down the pristine suburban street.  
      Inside, our narrator, TESSA, 16, in a faded hooded 
      sweatshirt, stares out the window at group of PRETTY BLONDE 
      MOMS, chatting away in their pastel cardigans.  They look at 
      the U-haul with disgust as it passes.  It s an eyesore.

                                  TESSA (V.O.)
                    Having grown up with just my dad, 
                    it really made me wonder-- 
                          (then, aloud)
                    What is with these mothers?


      The U-haul continues on its path through the picturesque 
      town.

                                  TESSA (V.O.)
                    He u-hauled my ass out of the city 
                    in pursuit of preppy friends and 
                      squeaky-clean influences.  Like in 
                    a J.Crew catalogue.

      Tessa looks out the window at TWO MOMS WITH STROLLERS who AIR 
      KISS each other hello.

                                  TESSA (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Pretty ironic that a box full of 
                    rubbers landed me in a town full of 
                    plastic. 

      The U-haul rounds the corner and barrels away from the camera  
      towards Tessa s new home.



      Tessa and George stand on the front lawn, staring at their 
      new home, a slightly run-down Spanish-style.  

                                  TESSA
                    What color would you call that?  
                     Circus Peanut? 

                                  GEORGE
                          (sighs)
                    It s a very traditional color for a 
                    Spanish style home.                               (FIRST DRAFT) 12/28/20104.


                                  TESSA
                    I know.
                          (then)
                    But it s definitely in the vomit 
                    family, don t you think?

      George narrows his eyes at Tessa.

                                  GEORGE
                    Why don t you grab your bag and go 
                    criticize the inside of the house.

      Tessa heads over to the U-haul and retrieves her bag.  George 
      walks off to inspect the back yard.  As Tessa heads up the 
      driveway with her bag, we hear a strange sound.  FFFFFTTTT.   
      Tessa turns to see her new neighbor, SHEILA SHAY, 40, stay-at-
      home-mom, watering her lawn across the street.  Sheila WAVES 
      at Tessa, enthusiastically.  Tessa hurries up the driveway 
      without waving back.  Once inside, Tessa can t resist a 
      backwards glance.  Sheila is still standing there.  WAVING.  
      Her smile is so wide it looks like her face might crack.

                                  SHEILA
                          (calling, cheerily)
                    Hiya, neighbor!  I m Sheila.  Are 
                    you the new family from New York?

      Tessa lets the door SLAM SHUT without answering.  She turns 
      to find George standing there giving her a look.

                                  TESSA
                    What?  You taught me not to talk to 
                      strangers.



      Not so.  George s U-haul pulls up to what is an extremely 
      fancy water-front country club.  It is brimming with BLACK 
      CARS and WHITE PEOPLE.  There is a roaring outdoor fire-place 
      and VALET PARKING.

                                  GEORGE
                          (tossing his keys to the 
                            valet)
                    Careful with her, fellas.

      A GREETER smiles at George brightly as he approaches.

                                    GREETER
                      Cucumber-lime water?



      Tessa trudges towards school with her oversized backpack.

                                  TESSA (V.O.)
                    To properly navigate suburbia, one 
                    needs a stay-at-home mom to drive 
                    you places.  Without one?  You re 
                    living like the early-settler.

      A SERIES OF SUVs drive by in a procession.  Each car is 
      filled with TEENAGE GIRLS who look at Tessa with pity, as 
      they pass. 

                                  TESSA (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    I was Laura Ingalls.  But without 
                    the braids and a deep-seated 
                      resentment for Pa.

      As Tessa steps off the curb, a CADILLAC ESCALADE filled with 
      HIGH SCHOOL BOYS speeds by, almost running her over.

                                  TESSA (CONT D)
                            (instinctively)
                    SLOW DOWN, D-BAG!!!

      The car SCREECHES to a halt.  The WINDOWS LOWER.  A handful 
      of ruggedly handsome HIGHSCHOOL SENIORS lean out of the car.  
      Amongst them is RYAN SHAY, in the passenger seat. 

                                  RYAN
                    Did you say D-bag?  Or D-bags?

                                  TESSA
                    D-bag, to the driver.  

                                  RYAN
                    See, Shawn!  I said she was talking 
                    to you.

      The car bursts out into LAUGHTER.

                                  TESSA
                    However, the rest of you are D-
                    bags, by association.

      The laughing abruptly stops-- except for Ryan who laughs 
      harder.                                 (FIRST DRAFT) 12/28/201012.


                                  RYAN
                    Good one!

      As the Escalade tears off, one of the D-bags in the back seat 
      chucks a can of SUGAR-FREE RED-BULL at Tessa.  It moves 
      towards her in SLOW MOTION.

                                  TESSA
                    At that particular moment, I had no 
                    idea what it was.  It was just a 
                    streak of silver and blue, hurtling 
                    towards my head, about to make 
                    impact.

      THE CAN-- hits Tessa square in the head and falls to the 
      ground.  She picks it up and studies it, like an alien.

                                  TESSA (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    But I would later find out, it was 
                    a potent popularity elixir,  
                    consumed in mass quantities by the 
                    ruling class.  I d never seen this 
                    drink where I was from.  But it 
                    dominated suburbia.  It was--
                          (reading, aloud)
                       Sugar-Free Red Bull. 

      Tessa rubs her head where the can hit her.  It left a mark.

                                  TESSA (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    And it left a mark.  My descent 
                    into Suburgatory had officially 
                    begun.

                                      END OF ACT ONE                               (FIRST DRAFT) 12/28/201013.


                                            ACT TWO

      TIGHT ON the inside of a refrigerator.  It is STOCKED with 
      Sugar-Free Redbull.  A TAN and MANICURED hand reaches inside 
      and plucks one.   We hear a DOORBELL ring.

                                  DALLAS (O.S.)
                    Coming!

      REVERSE ANGLE ON--  DALLAS ROYCE, 40, with giant lips full of 
      Juvederm and sizable fake breasts. She pads towards the front 
      door in her miniature exercise clothing.  We are--


      Tessa and Dalia walk the halls.  Dalia is TEXTING the whole 
      time.  Every few steps she flatly announces the name of each 
      place they pass, without ever looking up from her phone.

                                  DALIA
                      Auditorium.  Cafeteria.  Nose job.

      A GIRL with a NOSE BANDAGE stares into the mirror in her 
      locker, dotting concealer on her BLACK EYE to cover it.  
      Tessa looks around and notices SEVERAL MORE GIRLS with BLACK 
      EYES and NOSE BANDAGES. 

                                  TESSA
                    Guess I know what the school s most 
                    popular elective is...

                                  DALIA
                          (busy texting)
                    Music room. Gymnasium.  Bathroom.

      Tessa hangs a HARD RIGHT into the bathroom, ditching Dalia 
      without her noticing.



      WIDE SHOT of Tessa, with her giant backpack, huffing and 
      puffing down the street. 

                                  TESSA (V.O.)
                    You know you re a loser when you 
                    get dissed by the school loser.  My 
                    dad thought I was a skank.  My 
                      classmates thought I was a 
                      vagitarian.   Honestly, I didn t 
                    know what or who I was... 

      Tessa rounds a corner. 

                                  TESSA (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    But I did know suburbia was the 
                    last place to try to figure it out.  
                          (then)
                    I was half-way to the train station 
                    when the hostage crisis occurred.

      A JAGUAR slows next to Tessa.  Its heavily-tinted window 
      lowers.  

                                  GEORGE
                    Tessa!

                                  TESSA
                          (looking inside)
                    Dad?  What are you-- whose car is 
                    this?

      The window lowers further to reveal Dallas sitting beside 
      George in an impossibly small tank top.

                                  DALLAS
                    Hey, girl!  

      Tessa stares at Dallas blankly.

                                  DALLAS (CONT D)
                          (then, explaining)
                    I m a friend of your Daddy s.

                                  TESSA
                          (to George, incredulous)
                    She is?                               (FIRST DRAFT) 12/28/201021.


                                  GEORGE
                    Tessa, don t be rude.  Get in the 
                    car.

      Tessa opens the door to reveal Dalia sitting in the backseat, 
      sipping a Sugar-Free Redbull.  She looks even more miserable 
      than Tessa.



      George pulls up in front of his house.

                                  GEORGE
                    Thanks again, you guys.  That was 
                    really great.  Right, Tess--

      George turns to see Tessa is no longer in the car.  She is 
      racing up the path with her shopping bags.

                                  TESSA (V.O.)
                    I was home-free.  Or so I thought.  
                    I had no idea it was an ambush.  

      Sheila Shay seems to come out of nowhere holding an enormous 
      cast iron POT.

                                  SHEILA
                    Hola, neighbor!  I m just gonna set 
                    this pot-roast down on the steps 
                    while we have some girl talk!

      Sheila drags Tessa across the street by the arm.  As they 
      pass the Jaguar Dallas WAVES.

                                  DALLAS
                    Hi, Sheila!

                                  SHEILA
                          (waving back)
                    Hi, Dallas!  Put that roast in at 
                    350, George!  It needs another 
                    hour.  Covered!

      Sheila whisks Tessa inside her home and closes the door.

                                  DALLAS
                          (turns to George)
                    I told her to give Tessa some 
                    motherly love, like you said.

      George smiles weakly.

                                  GEORGE
                    Perfect.  Thanks.
                          (then)
                    She s going to kill me in my sleep.                               (FIRST DRAFT) 12/28/201026.



      George and Noah stand on his front lawn, watering with a 
      hose.  Several other NEIGHBORS do the same.  The sound of the 
      water spraying ( Ffffffft ) is deafening.                               (FIRST DRAFT) 12/28/201027.

                          (staring at Sheila s)
                    She s been in there too long...

                                  NOAH
                    Doesn t that lady have a teenage 
                    son?

                                  GEORGE
                    Today didn t go well.  I think 
                    maybe Tessa just doesn t identify 
                    with the girls at her school.  I 
                    need another strategy.  What about 
                    Jenna?

                                  NOAH
                    What about Jenna?  

                                  GEORGE
                    Tessa always looked up to her when 
                    they were kids.

                                  NOAH
                    Yeah, but that s when they were 
                    like, seven...

                                  GEORGE
                    I know but what if they totally hit 
                    it off?   Jenna could really be a 
                    great influence on Tessa...

                                  NOAH
                    Well, that s for sure.  Julie has 
                    book club tonight.  You want us to 
                    grab a couple of pizzas and come 
                    over?

                                  GEORGE
                    Actually, I have a roast in the 
                    oven.

                                  NOAH
                          (pause)
                    What?

                                  GEORGE
                      A pot-roast?  It s in there cooking 
                    at 350, so... yeah.

      Noah smirks at George.                               (FIRST DRAFT) 12/28/201028.


                                  NOAH
                    So what, you ve been holed up in 
                    the house all day?  Making pot-
                    roast?  

                                  GEORGE
                    No.
                          (softly)
                    I also went clothes shopping at the 
                    mall.

      The men stare at each other for a moment.  George s phone 
      BUZZES.  George hands the hose to Noah and looks at his 
      phone.  Then looks at Noah.

                                  NOAH
                    I gave someone your number.

                                  GEORGE
                          (reading)
                     Can I get you a refill on that 
                    OJ?   

                                  NOAH
                    The waitress from the club.

                                  GEORGE
                    I really wish you hadn t done 
                    that...

                                  NOAH
                            (sarcastically)
                    I know!  How awful.  Now she might 
                    pursue you. And then you d be 
                    forced to take her out to dinner.  
                    Or a movie.  And who knows, she 
                    might even want to have sex with 
                    you.  And that would suck.

      Noah rolls his eyes and acts like the hose is his penis.  He 
      directs the  stream  onto George s shoes.

                                  GEORGE
                    I can t believe you re somebody s 
                    father.

      Noah hands the hose back to George.

                                  NOAH
                    Speaking of which, I better go pick 
                    Jenna up from her lesson at the 
                    club so she can talk some sense 
                    into that kid of yours.                               (FIRST DRAFT) 12/28/201029.



      Tessa walks out the front door to find George standing there, 
      with the OLD LADY BIKE.  She takes a deep, cleansing breath.

                                  GEORGE
                    This means a lot to me.

                                  TESSA
                          (nods)
                    Let s do this before I change my 
                    mind.

                                  GEORGE
                    Okay!  I ll hold her steady while 
                    you climb on.

      Tessa straddles the bike.

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    Comfy?

                                  TESSA
                    Comfy?  I could have four asses and 
                    still be comfy.  Could this bike 
                    seat be any bigger?

                                  GEORGE
                    It s a nice safe bike.  Now, I m 
                    going to keep holding on until you 
                    find your balance.  So find your 
                    balance.  Find your balance.  And 
                    now just... start pedaling.                               (FIRST DRAFT) 12/28/201035.


      Tessa starts to pedal, tentatively.  George is struggling to 
      hold the bike up, running alongside her.

                                  TESSA
                    Like this?

                                  GEORGE
                    A little faster, maybe.  

                                  TESSA
                    Like this?

      Tessa pedals FASTER.  George is still holding the bike.

                                  GEORGE
                    That s it!  That s perfect!  See?  
                    You found your balance! 

      George isn t looking where he s going.  He runs into a 
      MAILBOX and goes down like a ton of bricks.  Tessa glides OS 
      and we hear a CRASH followed by a CAR ALARM.

                                  TESSA (V.O.)
                    His heart was in the right place.  
                    His pelvis, however, no longer was.   
                    And my leg was broken in three 
                    places.  But I guess no one goes 
                    through Suburgatory without a few 
                    bumps and bruises along the way.



      GLADYS, the homeless tranny, struts her stuff outside the 
      bagel place.  A BAGEL SHOPPE EMPLOYEE emerges from within the 
      shop with a LARGE MANILA ENVELOPE.  He hands it to Gladys.

                                  GLADYS
                    What, I got mail?!  You lying.

      The Bagel Shop Employee shows Gladys the envelope.  It is 
      addressed to her care of the Bagel Shoppe.  Gladys tears it 
      open and discovers the back-to-school clothes from 
      Abercrombie and Fitch.  She SQUEALS with delight.

                                  GLADYS (CONT D)
                    Tessa, girl, you hooked it up!!!  
                    This kilt is pimp!

      As Gladys tries on her clothes and struts her stuff we FADE 
      OUT.
