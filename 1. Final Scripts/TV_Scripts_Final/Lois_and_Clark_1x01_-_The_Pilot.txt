		A few early bird newspaper Employees are arriving.  We

		The Young Man exits the elevators and proceeds toward the	*
		"Pit" -- the area of desks reserved for reporters.  He 	*
		sits down at his desk with a tired sigh, takes off his 	*
		shoes, rubs his feet.	*

		THE YOUNG MAN	*

		now takes off his jacket.  He wears a T-shirt underneath.	*
		He puts both his hands on his chest, feeling a terrible 	*
		tightness, looks around for then grabs a scissors off the 	*
		desk, then lifts up his T-shirt just enough to reveal the 	*
		bottom of a large Ace Bandage and starts to cut.  The 	*
		Young Man expertly maneuvers under the T-shirt, cutting 	*
		away, finally unravelling the bandage and pulling it 	*
		through the sleeve of the T-shirt.  The Young Man takes a 	*
		deep breath, sitting back in his chair...	*

		FROM THE BACK	*

		The Young Man now removes his cap, shakes his long curly 	*
		hair loose, letting it fall to his shoulders.	*

					JIMMY (O.S.)	*
				You're in early.	*

		JIMMY OLSEN, cub reporter, approaches.  He is twenty-one, 	*
		looks years younger.  In white T-shirt and jeans, Jimmy's 
		boyish good looks make him a potential heartbreaker.

		Jimmy moves to the front of the desk and now stares at a 	*
		rather beautiful young woman, still sporting the 	*
		mustache and beard.	*

					JIMMY (CONT'D)
				(taking a thoughtful
				 pose)	*
			I like the beard.  But the	*
			mustache isn't working for me.	*

		The woman remembers, touches her face.	*

					JIMMY (CONT'D)
			Want me to do it?	*

		The woman nods and Jimmy sits on the edge of her desk, 	*
		taking the corner of the mustache and then ripping it off.	*
		The woman squeals, but when she picks her head up we now 	*
		see the real face of LOIS LANE, intrepid reporter for the 	*
		Daily Planet.  Lois is a twenty-six year old spitfire with 
		a "Just Do It" body.  Momentarily forgetting her pain, 	*
		Lois pulls out a tiny video recorder from her jacket, sets 	*
		it on her desk and Dresses Play.	*

		We are still watching the video playback from Lois' 	*
		adventures from the previous night -- Lois, in her young 	*
		man get-up, helps make the arrest of a band of car thieves 	*
		at the Metropolis pier.  When we PULL BACK we see a 	*
		beehive of activity in the open nerve center on the top 
		floor.  Reporters are at their desks typing, sipping 
		coffee, speaking on phones.  Assistants and staff race to 
		pick up copy, deliver messages, etc.  A large screen TV is 
		tuned to LTC (LexTeleCommunications News).  We continue to 
		PAN until we stop at

		A PAIR OF SHAPELY LEGS

		dangling from a desk and belonging to Lois Lane, now 	*
		sporting a short skirt with high heels.	*

			No problemo.

		Managing Editor PERRY WHITE strides by en route to his 
		office.  In his early fifties, Perry's badly in need of a 	*
		stress management class.  He growls like a lion, but it's a 
		well known secret it's all show.

					PERRY
			Don't, encourage her, Jimmy.  Her 
			head's as big as the Metrodome as 
			it is.

					LOIS
			Nice to know I'm appreciated around
			here, Chief.

					PERRY
			What do you expect?  Garlands
			strewn at your feet?

					LOIS
			No, but I'd like a raise.

					PERRY
			Yeah?  Well, I'd like a 145 foot
			triple masted schooner with a teak 
			interior, but times are tough.
				(then, to Jimmy)
			By the way, where did you learn
			how to boost a car?

		Lois looks at Jimmy, who grins.

					JIMMY
			One man's felony is another man's
			skill.

					PERRY
			Okay, what's everybody standing 
			around for?  This is a newspaper, 
			not happy hour at Buckingham 
			Palace.

		Perry continues toward his office, Jimmy catches up to him.

					JIMMY
			Chief?  I've got an angle on the 
			mini-mall murders.  I figure there
			was blood on the burritos 
			because...

			Did you finish those obituary
			updates?
				(Off Jimmy's look)
			Never underestimate the need for a
			good obituary.

		Perry strides on.  Jimmy stares after him, disgusted.

					JIMMY
			I can think of one right now.

		Jimmy wanders back to Lois' desk, idly fiddles through her 
		phone messages, stops at one in particular.

					JIMMY (CONT'D)
			Whoa.  I guess you finally hit the
			big time.

					LOIS
			Huh?

					JIMMY
			This time Lex Luthor's personal
			assistant returned your call.

		Lois grabs the slip from him, pissed off.

					JIMMY (CONT'D)
			Give it up.  Luthor never gives
			one-on-one interviews.

			Well, he's never met Lois Lane	*
			before, either.	*

	12	EXT. DOWNTOWN METROPOLIS INTERSECTION - DAY		12

		Clark waits with a crowd at a busy intersection for the
		light to change. He casually glances around him: an OLDER
		WOMAN with an armful of shopping bags, a young mother
		wheeling her infant twins, two school girls in newly ironed
		uniforms, a hip-hopper with a boom box, several businessmen
		and women.

		The Driver, humming merrily, speeds along, then, seeing the
		red light up ahead, casually steps on his brakes. When his
		foot goes all the way to the floor, he panics, frantically
		pumping, then trying the emergency brake. Nothing works.
		His eyes widen as he sees the red light straight ahead.


	15	AT THE INTERSECTION			15

		Clark and the group start across, the older woman and young
		mother with twins just to Clark's right. When Clark looks
		left, he sees the bus, inches away, coming straight toward
		them.


	16	IN THE BUS					16

		The Driver is astounded when the bus suddenly stops dead
		right at the intersection. He waits until Clark and other
		pedestrians safely cross, then opens the door to the bus,
		jumps outside.


	17	EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS			17

		The light has changed, but the driver stands motionless,
		staring at the front of the bus. Beside him, the older
		woman with the shopping bags looks like she's seen... a
		miracle. She looks at the bus driver, then across the
		street, where Clark seems to have disappeared into the
		crowd. She points...

	17B	INT. DAILY PLANET NEWSROOM - SAME TIME		17B

		The newsroom is business as usual when suddenly the SOUND
		of YELLING causes everyone to turn.  A wild-eyed crazy
		man (SAMUEL PLATT), filthy, ragged, in a long trench coat,
		bursts into the newsroom frantically in search of...

					PLATT
			Lois Lane!

		When he spots her, he races for her desk, followed by two
		Security Guards.

					PLATT (CONT'D)
			It's going to explode! Here...

		He reaches into his trench coat and someone yells...

					NEWSPAPER WORKER
			He's got a bomb!

		Instant pandemonium.. Everyone drops to the ground.  Platt
		looks around, confused, slowly removes a brown
		paper-wrapped package from under his coat.

					PLATT
			It's my credentials.

		He takes another step closer to Lois, and is grabbed by the
		guards. His package falls to the floor in the ruckus.

					PLATT (CONT'D)
			You don't understand! The space
			station has been sabotaged! The	*
			Messenger is going to explode!	*
			Miss Lane! You must tell my story!

					SECURITY GUARD

			Sorry, sir.  He ran right past

			Please!  You have to believe me!

			Okay, folks.  Show's over.
			Everybody back to work.

		The staff returns to work, chatting about the intrusion.
		Lois sits down at her desk, watches as a secretary picks up

					TV ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
			Dr. Toni Baines, Director of the 
			Extra Planetary Research And 	*
			Development agency, reminds us 	*
			that timing is crucial.  A series 	*
			of delays and launch failures has 
			put EPRAD's back to the wall.	*

					DR. BAINES
			Unless all modules are in place 	*
			within the next weeks, Space 	*
			Station Prometheus will lose its 	*
			orbit and fall back into Earth's 	*
			atmosphere.  That kind of 	*
			occurrence would surely spell the 	*
			end to any future projects and the 	*

					CAT (O.S.)
			Morning, Lois.  On your hands and

		newspapers are stacked everywhere.

					PLATT
			They said I was crazy, but wouldn't

					LOIS
			Dr. Platt, how could the Messenger
			have been sabotaged?  In order to
			bypass security...
				(beat, thinking)
			Unless the orders came from high

					PLATT
			You see, under extreme temperature

					LUTHOR
			Honored guests.  We're here tonight
			for a good cause.  Thanks to your 
			generosity, Luthor House for 
			Homeless Children will soon be a 
			reality.  As you know, I have 
			dedicated my life to improving the 
			quality of the lives of the 
			citizens of Metropolis.  Tonight, 
			I'd like to go further.  It is my 
			sad understanding that due, in 
			part, to the terrible tragedy that 
			befell the Messenger last week, the 
			Congress of Nations intends to 
			cancel Space Station Prometheus.
				(beat)
			I cannot stand by and allow that to 
			happen to the citizens of this 
			planet.  Profit aside, potential 
			benefits that a zero gravity 
			laboratory could bring -- most 
			importantly, pharmaceuticals that 
			could end crippling diseases here 
			on Earth -- must not be lost.  
			Therefore, I have decided to commit 
			my total.financial support toward 
			the building of a privately owned 
			space laboratory.  I have submitted 
			my proposal to the Congress of
			Nations and I am awaiting their 
			go-ahead.  Ladies and Gentlemen, I 
			give you... Space Station Luthor.

		Luthor pulls the curtain.  There, on the stage, is a huge
		mock-up of the proposed space station with the insignia,
		LL, emblazoned on its side.  The crowd oohs and aahs,
		breaks into thunderous applause.

			An engineering marvel.  Signpost to
			a new age in exploration and
			scientific advancement.  A gift to
			the future of mankind.

	178	INT. LEX LUTHOR'S PENTHOUSE - DAY		178

		Superman lands on Luthor's wide penthouse balcony, enters
		Luthor's study.  Luthor sits behind his enormous
		computerized desk in his leather chair.  When he sees
		Superman enter he rises to greet him.

					LUTHOR
			An astonishing debut, Superman.

					SUPERMAN
			Super...

					LUTHOR
			Haven't you heard? That's what
			they're calling you. It's
			international news.
				(beat)
			To what do I owe this honor?

					SUPERMAN
			I came to tell you that I know who
			you are.  Who you really are. I
			suppose, on its face, it was a good
			plan.  Destroy Prometheus so you
			could put your own space station in
			its place. Then, not only would
			you make billions from the patents
			of vaccines developed, but you'd
			also be the supposed savior of the
			space program.

					LUTHOR
			A very interesting theory,
			Superman. But that's all it is.

					SUPERMAN
			And profits aside, you are also
			responsible for the deaths of at
			least three people. Commander	*
			Laderman, Samuel Platt... Dr.
			Baines.
				(beat)
			Those probably aren't the only
			skeletons in your closet.

					LUTHOR
			So, you become both my judge and
			executioner?

					SUPERMAN
			Like any other citizen of the
			planet, I must obey the law.  I am
			not above it.  You, it seems,
			believe you are.

					LUTHOR
			I hold a certain position in this
			city.



		Rev. 3/9/93					106A.

	178	CONTINUED:					178

					SUPERMAN
			Yes.  And there is nothing that
			would please me more than to see
			you dethroned and behind bars, like
			any common criminal.  That day will
			come.

					LUTHOR
			I trust not.  But, then, as they
			say... let the games begin.

	178	CONTINUED:					178

		Superman walks back onto the terrace, Luthor following.  As
		Luthor watches, Superman begins a slow vertical ascent.

					SUPERMAN
			One other thing.  If you ever need
			to find me, all you have to do is
			look up

		Luthor does, indeed, have to look up as he watches the Man
		of Steel go ever higher, then disappear into the clouds.
		Luthor turns, walks back into his study, his anger
		building.  At that moment, Asabi enters carrying a wet
		suit, oxygen tank, and harpoon.

					ASABI
			The tank is ready sir.  The Mako is
			a particularly fine specimen.

					LUTHOR
			Send it back to the aquarium.

					ASABI
			Sir?

		Luthor slowly walks to his desk, sits down in his chair,
		swivels it toward the lights of the city.

					LUTHOR
		I have bigger fish to fry.


	179	INT. DAILY PLANET - NEWSROOM - DAY		179

		Clark Kent enters the newsroom, only to be accosted by Lois
		and led out once again.

					LOIS
			Clark, where've you been?

					CLARK
			Around.

					LOIS
				(sarcastically)
			Well, not that it's anywhere near
			as exciting as the stories you
			covered on the Smallville Press,
			but Superman was here in the	*
			newsroom and I've just about	*
			nailed down the exclusive.	*

					CLARK
			Congratulations.

					LOIS
			You should see him, Clark, up	*
			close.  He's the most magnificent	*
			figure of a man I've ever...	*



							108.

	179	CONTINUED: 					179

					CLARK
				(annoyed)	*
			Sounds like he made quite an	*
			impression on you.	*

					LOIS
			He did... why?  Are you jealous?	*

					CLARK
			Of Superman?  Should I be?	*

		Lois takes Clark by the arm, leading him toward the	*
		elevators.	*

					LOIS
			Come on, let's get going.	*

					CLARK
			Where to?	*

					LOIS
			Terrorist shoot-out on Sixth.

		They reach the elevators, but Lois suddenly stops, turns to
		Clark.	*

					LOIS (CONT'D)
			And Kent?
				(beat)
			I'll ask the questions.

		Lois turns back, is off again.  Clark shakes his head,
		follows.  The elevator doors close, but this is just the
		beginning.  Lois and Clark are off in search of another 
		story, another adventure in the city of Metropolis and so 
		we
