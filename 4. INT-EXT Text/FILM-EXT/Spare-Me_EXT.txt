An empty causeway spans a bay somewhere along the south shore
of Long Island. The sky is overcast. SHEILA, a woman in her
late twenties, wearing a full length heliotrope pleather coat
over a waitress outfit, kneels in the middle of the road. A
souped-up Vespa motor scooter stands nearby.
KEN AND BARBIE
Sheila holds a Bridal Barbie and Ken doll set. She sets them
down on the road, pulls out a can of lighter fluid and soaks
the dolls. She pulls out a bowling pin-shaped lighter and
torches the nuptial tableau.

Theo's sedan blasts past the camera down the empty road.
BURNING DOLLS
The flaming couple stand in the middle of
the bridge. Theo's car hits the pair and
they fly into the air in slow-motion. A
distant SOUND of pins scattering is
heard. The two dolls smoke as they spin
into the sky, then hit the water with
dual HISSES.

PIN RESET MACHINERY

An American Machine and Foundry pin reset machine performs
its functions like a mechanical ballet as the camera follows
a bowling ball through its journey. The "Spare Me!" theme
MUSIC (similar to "Balboa Blue" by the Marketts) swells.
TITLE: SPARE ME! appears on the bowling ball. Pins tumble
across the back plate, are loaded into the pin conveyor,
lifted up to the crown feeder, distributed into the rotating
carousel, and then set down in perfect formation upon the
polished bowling alley.
BURN-IN PRINCIPAL PLAYER TITLES. Titles appear on the pins.
The ball trundles along the return trough straight into the
lens.

Theo pulls into the empty parking lot of Babylon Lanes beside
a cheap looking American sedan.

JUNIOR, a dumpy man in his late thirties with a rat tail, bad
skin and wearing a white straitjacket and fluorescent orange
pants, runs desperately through dark woods. Bloodhounds BARK
in the distance.

Theo drives over the draw-bridge and past the Peter Pan Diner
with its huge neon sign.
12
Theo's car pulls up in front of a modest suburban house. A
rooftop weather vane in the shape of a bowler CREAKS
ominously in the wind.
13
13
Theo rings the doorbell. The porch light comes on, and
MILLIE, a fifty-five year-old woman dressed for a night on
the town in Reno, but with fuzzy slippers and a hairnet,
opens the door. A miniscule neurotic poodle leaps at Theo's
bowling ball bag, YAPPING and snapping at it.
THEO
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
MILLIE
Who wants to know?
(to dog)
Zeus!
THEO
I'm a bowler.
MILLIE
I'm sick of you people. Why don't you
leave him be?
BUZZ (OS)
Let him in, Millie. And don't frisk him.
14
15
Millie's furry slippers protrude from the driver's side door.
Zeus chews furiously on the yellow plastic 'Bowler On Board'
sign. She rifles through the contents of the overstuffed
glove compartment. She notices her dog.
MILLIE
(under her breath)
Get that outta your mouth!

23
Theo, bathed in sweat, practices his release form with
obsessive determination. He is alone near the empty bridge.
Sheila spies on him from behind the bridge control booth.
Theo takes a long slug from a bottle of liquor. He hears a
motor scooter start and ROAR off into the night.
24
25
Millie kneels on the front lawn patting dirt down on a little
grave marked by a wooden cross. Theo walks up.
MILLIE
He's not here.
THEO
I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
MILLIE
(points to grave)
This is a sign! Someone's coming to take
Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're
the guy or what, but I'm not letting it
happen. I'm leaving him first.
THEO
I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help.
Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the
trunk of her car.
MILLIE
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but
himself.
THEO
He's my father, Millie.
MILLIE
He's no father to you.
Theo lifts a box full of new bowling pins into the trunk.
MILLIE
Careful with that one. He won't tell me
anything, but I know there's something
strange going on over at the lanes. If
you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to
die.
THEO
Where can I find him?
MILLIE
(looks at her watch)
The Peter Pan.
Millie gets into the car.
MILLIE
You tell Buzz I went to my sister's in
Ronkonkoma. Oh, I'm sorry about trying to
kill you last night, Theo. It was nothing
personal. Millie puts on a pair of
sunglasses and patches out in a cloud of
gravel and dust.

27
Junior is running at breakneck speed through the thick brush.
Bloodhounds BARK. Junior slows down and drops to his knees,
gasping for breath. He looks up to the sky. The camera pushes
up to his sweaty, tortured face.
JUNIOR
(shrieks)
SHEILA!

Theo drives through the full parking lot of Babylon Lanes. He
pulls around the back and sees dark figures slip into a back
door. He parks his car, walks over to the now closed door.
It's locked. Theo finds another entrance and sneaks in. He
creeps his way through the darkened alley towards the sound
of raucous partying.
BUZZ (OS)
Welcome to Buzz Fazeli's Dwarf Bowling,
folks, where we bring you the finest in
specialized bowling entertainment.
THEO'S POV
Through a crack in a door Theo can see
Buzz standing in the spotlight.
BUZZ
I would like to draw your attention to
the top of the lane.
(a Casio drum roll PLAYS)
Weighing in at sixty-nine pounds and
standing exactly three feet - the
diminutive dominatrix Teeny Weenie Tina
the Terrible! The crowd CHEERS as the
spotlight moves to Tina, a masked lady
dwarf duded up in a combination black
leather and cowhide western style S&M;
outfit. She CRACKS a whip and leers at
the bowlers. They HOWL with excitement.
BUZZ
Don't be shy, folks!
Tina straps into her customized skateboard. A drunken
customer forks over a wad of bills, steps up and grabs hold
of the mini-human projectile.
BUZZ
And - bowl 'er!
Tina is hurled head-first towards the pins. The crowd goes
wild.
TINA'S POV
The camera tracks low behind Tina as she
crashes into the pins.
31
Theo is thrown onto the asphalt. Sid kicks Theo.
SID
You shoulda taken our advice, busyboy.
34
Theo sits in his parked car outside the Peter Pan diner.
Squinting in the bright light, he examines the cuts on his
face in the sideview mirror. He is looking scruffier. He sees
Sheila come out of the diner, start her scooter, and pull out
into traffic. He follows her.
35
He follows the Vespa at a discreet distance as Sheila drives
over the bridge. The weather is windy and threatening.
Thunder RUMBLES.
36
Theo pulls in next to Sheila's scooter under the big neon
sign for Miles 'O' Lanes Bowling Center. With a huge CLAP of
thunder and the SOUND of falling pins, the skies release a
pounding downpour.
37
KEN AND BARBIE, MACRO C.U.				 37
Sheila's Vespa is parked in the handicapped space. The dolls
are wired to the headset of the scooter. Large droplets of
rain roll down their faces.

The heels of Junior's running feet.
KASTLE (OS)
Junior's a problem child. He has a thing
about -
JUNIOR
(wails)
SHEILA!

46
Theo and Sheila blast along the dark roadway on her Vespa,
Theo sitting behind Sheila.
THEO
(shouting above the engine)
This is a vicious cycle.
SHEILA
I think that a motorbike is one of the
last really free things that people can
do.
THEO
Isn't this technically a scooter?
SHEILA
When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild
person.
(she looks sideways at Theo)
Better than any sex I've ever had.
THEO
Kinda tough on the butt.
SHEILA
Everything has it's drawbacks.
THEO
Where did your brother escape from?
SHEILA
The mental hospital.
THEO
What does he do?
SHEILA
He follows me, he tries to have sex with
me, and then they send him to the nut-hut
for a while and then he gets out and then
he follows me, he tries to have sex with
me, they send him to the nut-hut for a
while...
THEO
Whoa.
SHEILA
It's a vicious cycle.
CUT TO:

Sheila and Theo motor across an empty beach parking field
towards a lone station wagon. Swing-a-delic MUSIC drifts from
the parked vehicle.
47
47
Sheila pulls up beside the wagon. She leads Theo towards a
group of partying people at the tailgate of the car; three
white women, three white men and Luna. Luna pulls a rubber
hookah hose out of his mouth and offers it to Theo.
LUNA
Hookah?
THEO
No thanks, I don't hookah.
LUNA
Theo, you ever do the 'Swing'?
Theo shakes his head.
SHEILA
These guys all work at the alley, too.
This is John, Susan, Jon, Suzanne,
Jonathan, and Sue. Everyone welcomes Theo
and Sheila.
LUNA
(screams)
Dance Break!
Luna throws himself into a wild body-whip as the music THROBS
massively.
Luna and Sheila do a wild jitterbug-derived Swing-a-Delic
dance surrounded by weaving white folk.
One of the guys is on crutches, has a neck brace, a chest
cast, and one arm in a truss. He stands by the barbecue and
flips burgers with his one free hand. Theo walks over to him.
GUY
Hey man, howyadoin'?
He wiggles his hand out of the end of his cast. Theo shakes
his fingers.
THEO
Don't tell me, John.
JOHN
Cool!
THEO
Theo. Howzitgoin.
JOHN
Hey man, welcome to our parking lot.
Lemme give you some advice, if she asks
you to dance, make sure her brother's not
around. Somebody blew out Junior's pilot
light, if you get my meaning.
THEO
How's that?
JOHN
I was doing the lambada with her and the
guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to
kill me. I swear man, the guy thought I
was a piata. If nobody else hadn't a
been there, he wouldn't have stopped. He
woulda killed me. Fuckin' guy man, just
snapped. How do you like your burger?
THEO
(meets eyes with Sheila)
Uh...over easy.
JOHN
(throws a blackened burger on
Theo's styrofoam plate)
I'll tell you one thing, you won't see me
around that alley with that freak on the
loose. Stay away from his ass - and don't
play any of his fuckin' knock-knock
jokes.
Luna comes over to Theo and grabs him. They start to dance.
LUNA
Sheila wants me to show you a few steps
before you two swing-a-delic.
THEO
(uneasily)
So, you're the pinman around here?
LUNA
...And one, and two, and yes, I am. But
no one gets them working like Junior used
to...and two, and one.. - they call him
The 'Quasimodo of the lanes.' He's the
best pinman there is.. and one and
two...People used to say he got the
machines working so well 'cause he
lubricated them with blood...and two, and
one...but people just love saying things
about Junior.
SHEILA
Mind if I cut in?
THEO
No, not at all.
Theo pulls out his resin bag, powders up his hands, and goes
for Sheila. Theo and Sheila get low and nasty on the tarmac.
Sheila turns and does the freak to Theo, rubbing her rear end
into his crotch. As Theo and Sheila dance over near John he
makes a throat slitting gesture across his neck. Theo's hands
leave white prints on Sheila's butt. The Swing-a-delic funks
so hard it causes spontaneous audience dance riots and
structural damage in theaters across the country.
SHEILA
You and your sideburns are the talk of
the party, Theo.
THEO
The ladies in Akron call them thigh-
ticklers.
SHEILA
Can I ask you something personal?
THEO
I'd rather you didn't.
SHEILA
Do you have a girlfriend?
THEO
Not while I'm in training.
SHEILA
Do you have a boyfriend?
THEO
(surprised)
No. Do You?
SHEILA
No. Not at the present.
Sheila and Theo toast marshmallows over the barbecue as the
rest of the party dances in the background.
THEO
So this brother of yours is hazardous to
the health of your dates?
SHEILA
Nobody in this town really understands
Junior. When I went to family sessions
for him I realized he was the sanest one
in the family. Actually, he's the only
one in this whole fucking town who knows
exactly who he is and what he wants.
THEO
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
SHEILA
So, what about you?
THEO
Do I want you?
SHEILA
We'll get into that later.
CUT TO:
48
Theo and Sheila lie on the roof of the station wagon. "Devil
With The Blue Dress" by Shorty Long plays on the stereo. The
rest of the party throws marshmallows at each other in the
distance.
SHEILA
Theo, what would you do if you couldn't
bowl?
THEO
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to
do.
SHEILA
I wanted to be a motocross champion. My
folks didn't really care what I did. Then
Junior blew a fuse and I became their
last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed
down their throats, I got bowling. I
never understood how anyone could take it
so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting
you.
THEO
No, I'm fascinated.
SHEILA
Why were you suspended?
THEO
I used to be kind of wild. They used to
call me the bad boy of bowling.
SHEILA
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re-
instated?
THEO
Well, that was plan A.
SHEILA
What's plan B?
THEO
Plan B is your dad.
SHEILA
What do you think my dad's gonna do for
you?
THEO
He said he'd sponsor me.
SHEILA
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
THEO
Nothing.
SHEILA
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do
anything unless there's something in it
for him.
THEO
He asked me to keep an eye on you for a
couple of days.
SHEILA
What? Be my body guard?
(she laughs)
Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my
dad's sake. For your career. Sheila
starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.
THEO
Sheila, please.
SHEILA
Come on Theo, what about plan C?
THEO
(looking worried)
What's plan C?
SHEILA
Plan C...
(opens her shirt, showing off
her brassiere)
...is me.
Sheila takes Theo's nervous hands and places them inside her
shirt.
THEO
(torn)
Look, Sheila, I really like you but...
Sheila rolls on top of him, and plants a
hickey on his neck.
THEO
(stopping her)
Forget it, Sheila.

Breeze and Sid speed down a road in their damaged hulk. The
TENOR of Enrico Caruso can be heard from inside.

Theo, wearing sunglasses and dressed in a jogging suit
similar to Miles Kastle's, steps out of the diner with a bag
containing four orange whips. He goes over to his parked car.
Buzz walks up.
BUZZ
(in deadly serious)
Theo, I want you to get out of this town.
THEO
I'm getting to like it here.
BUZZ
Did that porcupine say he'd get you back
on the tour?
THEO
I gotta survive.
BUZZ
(shaking his head)
He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest
of your life.
THEO
You got a better offer?
BUZZ
No...
THEO
I didn't think so.
Theo takes a long drag from his orange whip.
BUZZ
Not for somebody who hit a man with his
ball on national television.
THEO
(bitterly)
That's right, Buzz, and you know when I
did it? Last match, last frame. All I
needed was one spare for the crown - and
I get stuck with the seven-ten, the
Fazeli Split.
BUZZ
You never even took the shot. You
couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz
in a threatening manner.
THEO
(repressed fury in his voice)
I was beaten on a shot named after my own
dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and
climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.
BUZZ
Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.
(taps chest)
I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm
finished - dead from my ankles up.
THEO
I couldn't care less.
Theo starts his car.
BUZZ
You know what I think? You didn't
come here to find a father. You didn't even come here for
help. You just came here to take it all out on somebody. Well
it ain't gonna be me! Theo pulls out of the parking lot. Buzz
yells after him.
BUZZ
(at the top of his lungs)
I SHOULDA HAD MY TUBES TIED!

The Kastle home is a huge nouveau riche Brady Bunch style
house with a large deck jutting over the driveway. The doors
are open on the spacious two car garage.
Sheila has the headset of her Vespa disassembled. Theo walks
up the driveway, orange whips in hand.
SHEILA
I don't think your new outfit suits you,
Theo.
THEO
(flicking dust off the suit)
Really? I kinda like it.
He sits nearby.
SHEILA
Do you talk with your mom?
THEO
It's been awhile. She didn't want me
looking for my dad.
SHEILA
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
THEO
So why do you stay?
SHEILA
I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a
binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm
trapped in his easy payment plan.
THEO
I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible
bowlers.
SHEILA
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes.
I'm looking for a professional man.
THEO
(he ponders the thought)
I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no
amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
SHEILA
(touches his lips)
How much would you charge me for the
lips?
THEO
More than you could afford.
SHEILA
Come on, bargain with me.
THEO
I could let them go for ten.
SHEILA
(she pulls away, slightly)
You professional men drive a hard
bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on
me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
THEO
(smiles)
If you want a professional man, you have
to be willing to pay for him.
54
54
Sheila and Theo stand on the deck. Sheila scans the road
leading to the house with binoculars.
THEO
What are you going to do about your
brother?
SHEILA
You're here.
THEO
What about the guy he put in the body
cast?
BINOCULAR POV
The road is empty
SHEILA
Momentary relapse. Except for that, he's
been making progress. Sheila laughs. Theo
nervously pulls his collar up over the
hickey on his neck.
SHEILA
Junior is like a faithful doggy. He loves
his birthday so much, that every year,
before we can go pick him up...
BINOCULAR POV
Kastle's car appears, driving hell-for-
leather towards the house.
SHEILA
...he breaks out of the hospital and
comes home on his own. Here they come.
She hands the binoculars to Theo, who
immediately trains them on the road.
SHEILA
My mom once had an affair. When my dad
found out, he had Junior kill the man.
The body was never found, but I think
Junior took him to the alley. Theo lowers
the binoculars and looks at Sheila.
THEO
Then it's true, isn't it? About...
SHEILA
...lane six. Yes.
55
Kastle's car comes belly-flopping to a stop in front of the
house. Kastle climbs out and gesticulates wildly to the
couple.
KASTLE
(a loud whisper)
He's here! Come on down!
BLACKNESS INSIDE THE TRUNK
KASTLE (OS)
(muffled)
OK, hats on everybody.
SOUNDS of the group gathering outside can be heard.
SHEILA (OS)
(muffled)
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.
KASTLE (OS)
(muffled)
Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three.
One...two...three!
The lid flies up and Kastle, Sheila, and Theo stand there,
with party hats and party horns in their mouths. They all
cheer and throw confetti.
EVERYONE
Surprise!
Kastle takes a flash snapshot. Junior, lying on some folded
blankets in the trunk, looks at his family with a stunned
expression. He is in a straitjacket. Junior's new watch
begins to PLAY "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head". He
struggles to pull his arm out, but can't. Kastle reaches in
to untie the straitjacket.
KASTLE
Steady boy, steady.
Untied, Junior presses the BEEPING watch against his ear. His
face breaks into a beatific smile.
CUT TO:

Kastle pulls shish kebab chunks off a skewer. He looks down
to see that one of the chunks is a melted Ken head. He throws
it away in disgust.
KASTLE
I bet you didn't know that you and Junior
have something in common, Theo: Junior
can't bowl anymore either. Isn't that
right Junior? Kastle SLAMS the ketchup
bottle down on Junior's right hand. The
table settings jump from the shock.
Junior sits impassively, his face a
blank.
KASTLE
See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened
to your hand, Junior.
SHEILA
After we eat, Dad.
KASTLE
He stuck it in the ball return machine
when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve
endings. Junior starts stroking the
ketchup bottle with his dead hand.
JUNIOR
It's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels
like someone else. Sheila grabs the
bottle from Junior, opens it and pours
some on her shish kebab. She leans over
and whispers furiously to her father.
SHEILA
Do you have to get your hooks into every
guy I'm interested in?
KASTLE
(whispers back, defensively)
You're just like you mother! Always
jealous!
SHEILA
That's why Mom ran away, because you had
to control everything!
KASTLE
She ran away to be with that...
(spits out his words)
that Motocross champion.
JUNIOR
Your turn, Theo. Why can't you bowl?
Sheila and Kastle sit up.
THEO
I don't like to talk about it.
JUNIOR
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't
you?
THEO
It depends.
JUNIOR
It feels good to let it out, doesn't it?
Sheila leans over and whispers furiously
to her father.
SHEILA
You're using Theo for your own deviant
purposes!
KASTLE
Look who's talking!
SHEILA
Leave him alone!
KASTLE
Just because your mother signed part
ownership of the lanes over to you,
doesn't mean you have a right to tell me
how to run my business! I can have my
lawyers take that deed away from you like
that.
(snaps his fingers)
Sheila and Kastle sit up.
KASTLE
Junior, how 'bout a riddle?
JUNIOR
(turns to Sheila)
Sheila. Knock-knock.
Sheila glances nervously at Theo.
JUNIOR
(impatiently)
Come on Sheila, knock-knock.
SHEILA
Who's there?
JUNIOR
Junior.
SHEILA
Junior who?
JUNIOR
J'you-and-your-friend do it yet?
(laughs)
KASTLE
(laughing)
Fantastic! What talent.
SHEILA
(caustically)
You still got the touch Junior.

A bowling pin-shaped cake with candles ablaze is presented to
a seated Junior. He is wearing a paper birthday hat. The four
orange whips are arrayed around the table.
KASTLE
Make a wish, son.
Junior stares into Sheila's eyes for several seconds.
JUNIOR
Same wish as last year.
Sheila blows out the candles in a hurry.
SHEILA
It won't come true, Junior.
Kastle places a gift-wrapped box in front of Junior and lifts
the lid. He reaches in and pulls out a huge, intricate claw-
like arm-shaped device made of plastic and metal and covered
with cables.
KASTLE
It's a bowling claw. You can bowl now,
Junior. With the whole family. Junior
beams at the group.
KASTLE
(puts one arm around Junior and
one on Theo)
Pretty soon everybody can bowl!
The two sleazeballs walk up onto the deck and over to the
table.
SID
Hello Mr. Kastle.
(nods to seated party)
Junior, long time. I thought they locked
you up and threw away the warden!
BREEZE
Is it true they blacked out the whole
county giving you electro-shock? Junior
looks from one man to the other,
breathing heavily, his nostrils flaring.
JUNIOR
Knock, knock.
BREEZE
Who's...
SID
(interrupting)
Don't do it Breeze!
(to Junior)
You ain't getting us into that.
Kastle gets up.
KASTLE
Hey, enough fun and games. We have work
to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for
his car. Junior gets up and follows. The
two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.
SID
(to Theo)
If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy-
bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap
dance on your spleen.
(pokes Theo in the side)
BREEZE
(pulls down Theo's collar to
reveal the hickey)
With cleats.
The two men turn, laughing, and follow Kastle.
58
Kastle huddles with Sid and Breeze, Jr. stands nearby
fiddling with his new bowling arm.
KASTLE
Buzz has been moving the cash out in
hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw
sideways glances at each other.
SID
No!
KASTLE
I want you two to pick up Buzz and bring
him to lane six. Junior will take it from
there.
JUNIOR
(perks up at mention of lane
six)
I'm gonna play Blue Face!

Buzz checks if the coast is clear and then stuffs boxes of

Theo and Kastle stand on the deck watching the sleazeballs
put Junior into the trunk of their car. Kastle lights an
oversized cigar and hands one to Theo.
MILES
Champ, as soon as you get back on the
tour, we should do an instructional
videotape. 'RAMBOWL' Theo Skinner teaches
Power Bowling. You on the cover with a
flame thrower. Kastle lights Theo's cigar
and they puff away.
KASTLE
Theo, how would you like to be my new
partner?
THEO
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle.
Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car
pulls out of the driveway.
KASTLE
I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I
think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls
out a shiny gold credit card and holds it
in front of Sheila.
KASTLE
Here, Bunny. Why don't you two go and do
something fun tonight, on me. Sheila is
lured to the scent of the plastic like a
junkie to a fix.
KASTLE
One thing, stay away from the lanes. If
Junior sees you two together, he'll
swallow his tongue.
She reaches for the card and Kastle
snatches it away from her with a chortle.
KASTLE
What did I say?
SHEILA
Don't go near the bowling alley.
KASTLE
(enunciating clearly)
Bowling "Center"!
Kastle hands her the card and heads into the house.
SHEILA
It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in
danger, would it?
THEO
Nope, I couldn't care less.
SHEILA
I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed
your help, right?
THEO
Why should I help that old fuck.
SHEILA
(sarcastically)
Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for
you?
THEO
Zip.
SHEILA
And besides, it's probably too late,
anyhow.
THEO
(exhaling cigar smoke)
Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history.
(goes to take another drag,
then stops)
Too late for what?
She turns away.
SHEILA
Nothing.
THEO
Too late for what, Sheila?
SHEILA
You know how people with broken bones
know when there's a storm coming?
THEO
You got any broken bones?
SHEILA
No, but something's gonna blow in this
town. I can feel it.
THEO
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is
something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila
seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is
unable.
SHEILA
(faltering)
I can't tell you, Theo.
THEO
Why not?
SHEILA
I saw your eyes when you hit that guy
with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles.
Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.
THEO
(gently)
Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of?
Sheila shakes her head.
SHEILA
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
THEO
It's Junior, isn't it.
SHEILA
(starting to cry)
I can't - I can't do it.
(she looks up through her tears
at Theo)
He's my brother.
THEO
He's my father.
CUT TO:
61
61
Sid and Breeze's car sits in front of Buzz's house. 8-track
opera PLAYS on the car stereo. A man screams and glass
smashes.
62
Theo and Sheila walk her Vespa up to the darkened alley. Theo
is wearing his own clothes again. The SOUND of a lone bowler
is heard. Theo straps on his wristbrace. Sheila pulls out
keys.
SHEILA
These open the back door. Don't let him
catch you behind the machines; if he
does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at
the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila
grabs his arm.
SHEILA
You don't have to do this. We could just
cut out of here, go to Akron,
or
anywhere else.
THEO
(dislodging her hand gently)
I'll be at the bridge.
63
Theo drives up to the erect draw-bridge. He stops and gets
out. The night is silent.
THEO
(loud whisper)
Sheila! Where are you?
Sheila pops out of the bushes and walks towards Theo.
THEO
(angry)
You told Junior that we did it.
SHEILA
It?
THEO
It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to
squeeze my fucking head off. What did you
say to him?
When they reach each other, they stop.
Sheila seems to weigh her answer.
SHEILA
I told him you were my boyfriend.
THEO
(very pissed off)
What the hell did you go doing that for
Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
SHEILA
We would have sooner or later.
THEO
Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew
he would go off if he thought I fooled
around with you.
SHEILA
Did you - kill him?
Theo paces up and down in front of the upright bridge.
THEO
How do you get this thing down?
SHEILA
Tell me what happened Theo.
Theo backs Sheila towards the bridge control booth.
THEO
(glares at Sheila)
You wanted me to kill him, didn't you?
SHEILA
(in shock)
If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
THEO
He's dead Sheila.
SHEILA
I feel sick.
THEO
You should.
SHEILA
Are you sure he's dead?
THEO
I didn't stop to take his pulse.
Theo boosts Sheila up the ladder to the control booth. The
hydraulic machinery of the bridge heaves into motion and the
bridge begins to lower. Theo walks over to his car. Sheila
jumps down from the bridge control booth and follows him.
SHEILA
Where are you going?
THEO
I think your brother may have already
gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
SHEILA
Can I come with you?
THEO
I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now
fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila
standing alone. She watches his car
recede with a thoughtful expression, then
turns on her heel.
CUT TO:
65
67
Theo jerks awake. His car is parked by the Fazeli house. It
is a clear, blustery day.
A gust of wind pulls the screen door open, then SLAMS it
shut. He gets out of the car and walks unsteadily towards the
house.
68
Theo waits through several rings.
GRACE
Hello?
THEO
Hello, mom?
GRACE
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
THEO
I found dad.
GRACE
He's dead, isn't he.
(pauses)
Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died
before you were born.
THEO
Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did
it a little too late.
GRACE
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not
bowling are you?
THEO
I gotta go. Love ya mom.
Theo hangs up the phone. Alfie shuffles over.
ALFIE
Did you hear about that bowler who got
smeared? I saw them pull a body bag out
of the alley. I heard he was kacked but
good. They had to take apart the pin
machine to get him out.
THEO
(stunned)
The pin machine?
ALFIE
Just like Junior did the last time; lane
six. All's I know is it's gonna be a
closed coffin. My advice to you is to lay
low. He puts on a pair of dark 7-Eleven
shades, flips up his collar and skulks
away.
70
Theo pulls into the parking lot. The place is cordoned off
with day-glo yellow emergency tape printed with "Bowling
Police - Do Not Cross". A black bowling police van, its blue
light spinning, is parked in front. Bowling cops herd dwarfs
and customers into the van. Mothers and daughters mill around
behind the yellow tape. A group of little people brandish
"Right to Work" signs. Theo gets out of his car. The crowd
moves in as Kastle, hands cuffed behind him, emerges from the
door.
LITTLE GIRL
There he is!
Camera flashes POP all over the place. Two black-jacketed
bowling cops step out behind him. They are Sid and Breeze.
BREEZE
Bowling police, step back, give him room.
SID
Nothing going on here, everybody stand
back. Let him through, ladies. Ladies,
please. As they start to move through the
female throng, a little girl pops out in
front of them, holding her ball.
LITTLE GIRL
Mr. Kastle, we know you wouldn't do
anything bad.
KASTLE
Thank-you, sweetheart.
(turns to Breeze)
See that you pinheads! Character witness.
(with sweeping head gesture)
They're all character witnesses!
(he sees Theo)
Thanks to Buzz Fazeli, bowling is dead in
this town! He KILLED it! The two officers
hustle Kastle towards the van. Theo steps
out in front of him.
KASTLE
(between clenched teeth)
You fool, we could have done great things
together!
THEO
Where's Junior?
KASTLE
He killed your stoolie embezzler father,
and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and
Breeze push him towards the van as the
crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns
and yells over his shoulder.
KASTLE
(shouting)
Lock your daughters up, ladies! Junior's
out there! Mothers and daughters send out
a cacophony of screams and scatter for
their cars. The BP cops hoist Kastle into
the back of the van. Sid slams the doors
shut. The van screeches off, sirens
wailing. Sid and Breeze walk up to Theo.
BREEZE
Sorry about your loss.
THEO
(shaking his head)
I should've pegged you guys for bowling
dicks from day one.
SID
You should probably hit the road. Go
home. This place could get hazardous for
your health.
THEO
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
SID
You call it stooling, we call it
cooperating. Breeze looks under Theo's
car.
BREEZE
Did you know you were parked in the
handicap space?
SID
Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.
Theo gets into his car and starts the engine. Sid and Breeze
poke their heads in the windows.
SID
She told us you went after Junior to save
your old man's hide. You got some balls
goin' after that psycho.
BREEZE
Only problem is, you didn't put his
lights out, you just got him mad. Then he
took it out on poor Faz, God rest his
soul. Theo patches out.
SID
Think he bought it?
BREEZE
I'd buy it!
Sid chews his lip worriedly.
71
72
Theo pulls up to the old party spot and gets out. He walks
over the dunes and towards the beached station wagon. A huge
flame rises down the beach. A woman is visible in its light,
tossing objects into the fire. Theo walks towards her.
Sheila is stripping Barbie and Ken dolls and tossing them
onto the pyre. Each one goes up in an exaggerated
WHOOSH of
flames. She notices Theo when he steps into the light.
SHEILA
Once my father walked in on me while I
was making Barbie and Ken do it. He
freaked. I was seven. He took all my
dolls away from me and cut them in half.
He gave the top halves back to
(more)
SHEILA
me. Then he made me watch him burn the
bottom halves in the fireplace. Theo
kneels down nearby and throws a Barbie
onto the bonfire. It goes up with a
WHOOSH.
SHEILA
I can see Junior's face in the fire.
Theo puts his hand on Sheila's hand. She looks at him.
SHEILA
Why did you come back?
THEO
When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even
think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in
his arms and kisses her passionately. She
stops him and looks around nervously.
SHEILA
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
THEO
I killed him once, I'll just have to kill
him again.
SHEILA
You don't get two chances with Junior.
THEO
At least I'll die smiling.
Sheila pushes him over. He falls backwards, her on top.
SHEILA
And you only get two chances with me.
Sheila yanks her shirt over her head and tosses it away.
FIRE
The shirt CRACKLES and burns.
She pulls Theo's head up to her breasts.
SHEILA
What's it gonna be, Theo?
A Barbie's breasts blister from the heat.
THEO & SHEILA
Theo bends Sheila backwards, down on her
back. She grabs the tail of his shirt,
yanks it over his head and off his body.
Sheila rubs her hands up Theo's back.
SHEILA
What's the plan, Theo?
A Ken back bubbles and melts. Theo lifts Sheila's back off
the sand and works her jeans down her legs.
SHEILA
Say something, Theo. Give me something. A
doll's legs catch fire. Theo stares into
Sheila's eyes.
THEO
Plan C. From now on it's gonna be plan C.
Both bodies throb and grind, their sandy
hands sliding over each others' sweaty
skin.
THEO
It's gonna be you, Sheila.
They humpty-hump to the beat of "Scientist's"
'DEMATERIALIZE.' We hear Theo and Sheila's stereophonic
MOANING as a Barbie and a Ken doll collapse and vaporize from
the blazing heat.
We pan up through the flames, the MOANS increasing in volume
and intensity as they reach the you-know-what-we've-all-been-
waiting-for.
CUT TO:
73
73
A coffin moves slowly forward as a solemn DIRGE plays. The
top is in the shape of a bowling alley with a miniature black
bowling ball inscribed with "The Faz" at the head. The
pallbearers; Theo, Breeze, Sid, Tina, and two other bowlers
place the coffin on poles above the grave. A rotund priest
sprinkles holy water. Sheila stands next to Theo, crying.
(more)
Theo wears a glazed look. The priest clears his throat with a
loud AHEM.
PRIEST
(with pomp and vigor)
Bowling!
(pauses to reflect)
Bowling is a little like faith. Every now
and then, we are blessed with the ability
and strength to send a full roller down..
(makes bowling gesture)
...and scatter those babies like nobody's
business. And every now and then we end
up in the gutter.
(pauses and gets glum)
Buzz Fazeli found himself in the gutter
of life. Trapped in hook alley, throwing
nothing balls. But before he left us for
that pie alley in the clouds, he pulled
himself out of that gutter.
Buzz Fazeli died cleaning up the sport of
bowling. Now he lies at peace alongside
his lane brothers here in Bowlers' Field.
(makes sign of the cross)
He died so that we could bowl - with
dignity. Millie, decked out in mourning
black, lets out a wail, steps up and
throws a bouquet of flowers onto the
coffin.
MILLIE
(sniffles)
I forgive you Buzz.
Sid leans over to Theo.
SID
(in loud whisper)
The Faz sure took care a her.
(points to Millie, does the
cash rub with fingers)
Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to
suppress a snigger. Sid - trying to keep
a straight face - elbows him. Sid and
Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls
an orange whip out of a paper bag and
carefully places it on the coffin lid.
BREEZE
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
SID
See ya 'round Faz.
Tina steps up to the grave with a handful of papers.
TINA
These are all your perfect games.
(she drops scoresheets onto the
coffin)
Bowl with God, Buzz.
Mourners sniff and cry. The coffin starts descending into the
ground. A stiff breeze scatters the scoresheets. Sheila
nudges Theo who approaches and tosses a handful of soil into
the grave.
THEO
Maybe you were right Buzz. Maybe I did
just come here to take it out on
somebody. But, I had to find my father...
The muffled BEEPING of "Raindrops Keep
Falling On My Head" begins playing from
inside the coffin. Theo's body jolts. He
runs after Sheila who is walking towards
her scooter.
THEO
Buzz is alive, Sheila.
The two sleazeballs gaze surreptitiously at him as they walk
towards their car. Theo grabs Sheila's jacket.
SHEILA
Theo, Buzz is dead.
THEO
I didn't come this far to bury a guy
that's not my dad. He owes me.
SHEILA
(bitterly)
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all
over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
SHEILA
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my
whole life. She walks over to her
scooter, and mounts it.
SHEILA
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm
the one who's free. If I gotta do this
alone, I might as well start now. She
revs up and peals out.
THEO
(yells)
SSHHEEIILLAAA!
74
74
As Sid and Breeze walk up to their car, Theo catches up with
them.
THEO
Why is Junior's watch in that coffin?
Something stinks around here.
SID
Your time is up, busyboy.
THEO
Who identified the body?
SID
The body was identified along proper
Bowling Congress guidelines for
processing a bowling related fatality.
THEO
I'm the next of kin. I should've seen
him.
BREEZE
After we ID, we bury the body. Case and
casket closed.
THEO
You tried to make it look like Junior
trashed his place. Junior's underground
in that coffin you dicks put him in.
BREEZE
It's splitsville for you.
Sid and Breeze back away from Theo.
THEO
You faked my dad's murder. You used him!
Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze
around their car. He catches Sid and
grabs the middle fingers on his right
hand. Sid howls.
SID
Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back
on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze!
Breeze pulls a copy of "New York Bowler"
from his pocket. The headline reads "RUB
OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM
KINGPIN" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli.
SID
It's official, you're an orphan.
Happy now, busyboy? Theo stares at the newspaper. He lets
Sid's fingers drop.
75
75
Sheila speeds along, her Vespa maxing out at 30 mph. From
behind her we see Theo's car approaching rapidly. He pulls up
beside her.
THEO
(shouting and pointing
frantically)
What makes you think you know me so well
that you can give me an ultimatum? Huh?
SHEILA
Who said anything about an ultimatum? You
want to find your father? Get a shovel
and start digging. Hurry up, he's
probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila
makes a pathetic attempt to speed away
from Theo. He moves up beside her again.
THEO
You're really pissing me off.
SHEILA
I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I
said I'd do. What the hell are you doing?
What about your word?
THEO
My word is good, and it'll always be
good. When did I ever give my word to
you?
SHEILA
What about plan C?
THEO
Fuck plan C!
SHEILA
Your word is so good, you're never gonna
give it to anyone.
THEO
You think I'm dumping you to get back
into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
SHEILA
I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.
THEO
Sez you!
SHEILA
Suck my dick!
She speeds ahead.
76
76
Theo THUNDERS along in his car. He listens to his SONG over
the stereo. Theo digs into his pocket and pulls out the golf
ball from Buzz's house.
77
GOLF BALL
77
The logo on the ball reads "PARADISE."
THEO
Paradise.
The white ball fills the frame.
THEO (OS)
(whispers to himself)
Paradise. Hmmmm
The camera pulls back from the ball to reveal:
78
The billboard fills the frame. It reads "Paradise Putt-Putt",
and underneath: "A heavenly experience." A motorized cheesy-
looking smiling dwarf-angel swings a golden club.
Miniature golf obstacles are bathed in the light of the
setting sun. The camera passes a huge cement centaur
surrounded by astro-carpeting.
WOMAN (OS)
I just hold it loosely with both hands?
MAN (OS)
That's right, sugar, find the grip that's
right for you. Then grasp firmly.
The camera weaves past a five foot pink
whale with a gaping green mouth leading
onto a mini-green.
WOMAN (OS)
Grasp firmly. Then what?
MAN (OS)
Line up where you want it.
WOMAN (OS)
Yeah.
MAN (OS)
Now swing it out a little to the right...
WOMAN (OS)
Like this?
MAN (OS)
No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle
stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead,
now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes
around the side of the whale, we see an
elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports
coat and white slacks hunched over a
diminutive fiftyish woman.
His back is
to the camera and he is wearing a
baseball cap with a plastic halo attached
to it.
WOMAN
Strokin'. Here goes nothin'.
She swings a club, sending a golf ball puttering into a cup.
MAN
Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke!
WOMAN
Yippy!
Theo strides towards the couple. The man under the halo is
(more)
Buzz. He raises the club at the approaching Theo, keeping the
woman in front of him as a shield. The front of Buzz's cap
reads "I'm No Angel."
BUZZ
Get away from me!
WOMAN
Who the hell are you?
THEO
Hi Dad.
WOMAN
Dad? You said you was single.
BUZZ
We ain't married no more.
THEO
He says that to all his wives.
As she tries to wiggle away from him, the club conks Buzz on
the noodle, squishing his halo.
WOMAN
(freeing herself - to Buzz)
Geez Maynard, is he telling the truth?
BUZZ
Don't pay him any mind, sweetheart.
WOMAN
You're a nice guy, Maynard, but if you
got two wives - I ain't into no
polybigamy. Buzz is silent. He takes the
club out of her hand. She steps away -
startled - then turns and jogs away. Buzz
throws down his club in a fury.
BUZZ
Goddam it! I was just about to make a
love connection. You sure got a way with
women. You show up, women get away.
THEO
(laughs)
The whole world thinks you're
underground.
BUZZ
I am underground.
Buzz removes his damaged cap.
THEO
It could just as easily have been me in
that box.
BUZZ
I told you to get lost. You forced
yourself into this mess, so the mess
accommodated you.
Buzz straightens out and carefully
remolds the bent out of shape halo.
THEO
What about bowling?
BUZZ
(takes a practice swing)
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides,
I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
THEO
You're a scumbag.
Buzz pats his hair down and slips the cap back on his head.
BUZZ
I'm a live scumbag.
Theo digs into his pocket and retrieves the golf ball. He
tosses it to Buzz.
THEO
Nice knowing you, dad.
Theo turns and walks towards his car. Buzz pauses and walks
after him.
BUZZ
So, eh, you never saw me. Right?
THEO
I never saw you.
BUZZ
Thanks, kid.
(pause)
Where are you goin' now?
THEO
I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts.
Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the
open window.
BUZZ
Listen, if straight doesn't work out, you
come work for me.
(hands Theo his card)
Just make sure nobody's following you.
Buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of
the sunset, his halo bouncing in the
breeze.
BUZZ
I didn't mean that stuff I said. I was
trying to keep you out of this muddle.
I'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh,
and by the way, I made a call for you
before I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his
card and scrawl on the back with a gold
pen.
BUZZ
(hands the card back)
You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling
Congress a call.
(taps the card)
Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's
expecting you, and he owes me. He'll
getcha back in like Flynn.
(pats Theo's cheek)
Don't say I never gave you nothing.
THEO
(cracks a half smile)
See ya 'round Maynard.
Buzz backs away from the car as Theo peels out in reverse.
Buzz stands and watches as Theo pulls away.
80
80
The sign has been changed to "SHEILA'S ALLEY." A sparkling
new badass super-chromed Vespa is parked in the handicap
zone. The Barbie and Ken dolls are wired to the headlamp.
They look incredibly worse for the wear. A parking ticket is
nestled between them. Theo's car pulls in nearby.
81
84
Alfie, hands trembling, lays a tiny wreath on Buzz Fazeli's
grave. The headstone reads, "Maynard 'Buzz' Fazeli 'I Never
Met A Bowler I Didn't Like.'" A muffled watch beeper CHIMES
"Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head." The camera pulls up to
show ten headstones laid out in a bowling pin set-up with
Buzz's at the head.
DISSOLVE TO:
85
Buzz's silhouette against an orange sunburst sky. He wears
his halo hat. He takes a beautiful PGA-perfect slow motion
fluid golf swing, connecting with a THWAP. As he follows
through, divots of turf dance at his feet. MUSIC swells. He
holds the afterswing pose and gazes after the ball, off into
the distance.
