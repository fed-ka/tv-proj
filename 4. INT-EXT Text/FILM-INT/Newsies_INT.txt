The huge printing PRESSES POUND out the morning edition,
setting a rhythm that carries us through the scene as the
newspapers are printed, collated, folded, and spit out
onto a rapidly-growing stack.
Pressmen bundle the papers and toss them into carts.

A large room filled with boys sleeping in hammocks,

On the wall by his head, the commanding visage of Teddy

KLOPPMAN
Ink's wet, the presses are rolling,
the papers are stacking -- rise

Jack jumps out of his bunk and shakes the BOY below.

SEITZ
The news is slow, Chief, the
Trolley Strike's all we got --
PULITZER (O.S.)
It's all Mr. William Randolph
Hearst has, too -- see how he
covers the strike!
The magnifying glass swings to a copy of the New York
Journal with a large black headline: "NUDE CORPSE ON
RAILS -- NOT CONNECTED TO TROLLEY STRIKE." The CAMERA
COMES AROUND to reveal JOSEPH PULITZER, himself, a
thundering presence in smoked-glasses and a beard,
wielding the magnifying glass like a gavel of judgment.
PULITZER
Hearst is killing us in the
circulation war -- and you give
me headlines that would put a
whirling dervish to sleep!
BUNSEN

We'll get a new headline writer,
Mr. Pulitzer.
PULITZER

SEITZ

You mean the Newsies...? Charge
the Newsies more for their papers?
Bad idea, Chief.
JONATHAN
Very well. My next proposal --
salary cuts, particularly those
at the very top --
PULITZER
Wait. What
do the Newsies pay
now -- fifty cents per hundred
papers? If
you raised it to
sixty cents --
JONATHAN
A mere tenth of a cent per paper --
PULITZER
-- then that, multiplied by forty
thousand papers a day, seven days

Not necessarily. As newspapermen,
Hearst and I would cut each other's
throats to get the best of the
other. But as businessmen -- and
gentlemen -- we often agree on
ways to keep down certain operating
costs. If I know Willie Hearst,
he's going to wish he thought of
this himself.
SEITZ
What about the other papers -- ?
PULITZER
If we do it, they'll all do it.
It's only a tenth of a cent --
nobody gets hurt! It's good for
the Newsies -- an incentive, make
'em work harder, sell more papers!
Now get me Hearst on that

SNYDER pops a messy eclair in his mouth -- from a large

Crutchy, with a featherduster, is eyeing the eclairs
when he sees the picture in the Sun.
CRUTCHY
That's Jack -- ! Hey, he looks
just like hisself!
Snyder looks at the picture:
instant recognition.
SNYDER
You know this boy...?
CRUTCHY
Him?
Nah.
SNYDER

You have a famous friend, this
'Jack.'... Do you know where he
lives...?
CRUTCHY

his palm)

You're afraid of them, too...

Medda's gotta look out for herself

How can they make a whole city

the lobby making handbills, signs, posters. Kloppman
comes in and stops short, seeing a dark figure at his
counter, going through his register.
KLOPPMAN
Can I help you?
The figure turns -- Snyder smiles his smarmy smile.
SNYDER
Do you have a 'Jack Kelly'
registered here? I wish to see
him.
The boys look up, alert.
Kloppman dislikes Snyder on

Behind Snyder, they see Jack bouncing in the front door.
Racetrack tries to signal him --
RACETRACK

in his shoe and beat it.
Jack sees Snyder -- but instead of running back out the
door, he can't resist mocking him behind his back. The
Newsies snicker; Kloppman is dying.

around suspiciously. Racetrack thrusts a leaflet in his
face.

Snyder tries to look around the leaflet -- then it

prisons, Mayor -- a convicted
thief who's been at large for some
time under the alias of 'Jack
Kelly.' His real name is...?
Snyder slinks out of a corner, humble in such august
company.
SNYDER
Sullivan, Your Honor -- Francis
Sullivan. I would have caught him
before now but --
PULITZER
You know Warden Snyder, don't you,
Mayor? I believe you appointed
him.
The Mayor nods ruefully; not one of his best appoint-
ments.
MAYOR
If this boy is a fugitive, then
the chief can quietly arrest him
and --
PULITZER
Not quietly -- I want an example
made. I want this rabble he's
roused to see what happens to
those who dare to -- well, they
should see justice in action.
MAYOR
Arrest him at the rally?
But...
PULITZER
By the way, Mayor, I'm having a

you'll join us -- we can talk

A butler leads Seitz, Snyder and Jack across a marbled
floor, their FOOTSTEPS ECHOING in the luxurious hall.
JACK
Very impressive. So where do they
keep the trains in this station?
Seitz shows
him into an elegant library. Snyder tries to
follow but
Seitz stops him, closing the doors. Inside,
Jack looks
around to see the imposing figure of Pulitzer
staring at
him, framed by luxurious furnishings. For a
moment, the

PULITZER

Civil War.
JACK
I heard of it. You win?
PULITZER
People think wars are about right
and wrong. They're not. They're
about power. You know what power
is?
JACK
Heard of that, too.
I don't just
sell ya papes, Joe.
Sometimes
I read 'em.
Pulitzer ignores the impudence, continues quietly.
PULITZER
Power means that I could see to it
that you serve your full sentence
at the Refuge. Or I could pull
strings and have you free tomorrow.
It means I could give you my
pocket change -- and you'd have
more money than you'd likely ever
earn.
JACK
You bribin' me, Joe? Thanks for
the compliment, but I ain't got
the power to stop the strike --
PULITZER
I disagree. You're the spirit of
the strike, without you, they'd
fall apart in a few days.
JACK
Ring for my coach, willya?

offering you a choice -- is that
what you choose?
JACK
I told ya... I can't call off the
strike.
PULITZER
I'm not asking you to. All I ask
is that you return to your old
job -- as Newsie for the The World.
JACK
And be a scab? Forget it --
PULITZER
For a few days. Then the strike
ends -- and it will end, boy, make
no mistake -- and you can go
wherever you want to buy a ticket.
Free and clear, with money in your
pocket... and no one chasing you.
Jack is silent, troubled.
Pulitzer pushes a buzzer.
PULITZER
You go back to the Refuge. Think

As Jack steps back into the light, the CAMERA WIDENS and
we realize he's back in the House of Refuge. Jack begins
to sing softly: REPRISE: "SANTA FE."
Jack sits in a small dark room -- an isolation room;
moonlight shines through barred windows; there's a door
with a small serving panel in it.
JACK
SANTA FE

Jack looks up as the serving panel opens and Crutchy
peers through, offering him something furtively: a
boiled potato.
CRUTCHY
Snitched it offa Snyder's plate
when I was servin' him -- the
biggest one!

head, looks away)
Snyder was eatin' good tonight --

reading a headline: "HOUSE OF REFUGE, HOUSE OF SHAME"
