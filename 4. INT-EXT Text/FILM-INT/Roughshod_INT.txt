ANGLED to include sheriff's office. The blacksmith, Sam Ellis,
an elderly bent man in a leather apron stands at the forge
in which he is heating the rim from the big wheel which lies
on the table nearby. Clay, a long-legged wrangler in clean
but faded work clothes stands near the forge pumping the
bellows and watching his brother, a freckled kid of sixteen
trying to roll a cigarette. Steve has progressed to the most
difficult step, that of licking and sealing the paper. Clay
reaches over and takes it from him. He puts the skinny
cylinder in his mouth and Steve lights it for him. The first
third of the cigarette burns with one quick flare.
STEVE
How does she draw?
CLAY
A little hot.
Sam lifts the rim to the wheel.
SAM
You want to get out of here before
noon, maybe you should lend me a
hand.
Clay, the cigarette dangling from his lips, moves over to
the table, picks up a hammer and helps Sam hammer the rim on
the wheel. Steve stands watching.
CLAY
Rate you're goin', we'll be here
until winter.
Together they lift the wheel and plunge it into the tub of
water. Steam rises to fill the blackened shed.
SAM
(amiably grumbling)
Account of you, I miss out on the
only excitement Aspen's had for
months.
CLAY
You're too old to watch such goin's
on.
STEVE
And I'm too young.
Clay and Sam spin the wheel in the tub.
CLAY
That's right.
STEVE
I don't see no sense to makin' people
leave town if they don't want to
leave.
SAM
I don't either -- when people are
that good-lookin'. Maybe that's why --
they were too good-lookin'.
(philosophically)
But there'll be others along to take
their place after a while when this
quiets down. And everything will be
fine until some busybody starts
stirring up trouble.
CLAY
(mildly)
Don't you ever run down?
SAM
(to Steve)
Some people just have to run other
people's lives. Now take Clay. You
want to amble up the street and see
the fun and what does he say?
CLAY
(good-natured)
You stick to your blacksmithin' and
let me take care of Steve.
From O.s. comes the SOUND of the approaching buckboard and
crowd. Steve hears the noise and moves to the front of the
shed.
ANGLED PAST Steve. Clay comes up to stand beside Steve. Sam
joins them. Steve looks up at Clay hopefully.
CLAY
We'll both take a look. Anything's
better than listenin' to Sam.
(to Sam)
Don't forget to shoe the mule.
Clay and Steve exit. Sam looks after them, shrugs disgustedly
and goes back to the wheel.
ANGLED PAST Wyatt. This is the main room of the house -- a
living room and kitchen combined: wood-stove against one
wall, a sink with a pump against another, a fireplace, some
simple furniture and, hanging from one of the rough walls, a
concertina. Through an open doorway can be seen the Wyatt's
bedroom. Another door, closed, leads into the second bedroom.
The house has a warm, well-scrubbed look. Wyatt enters.
Mrs. Wyatt, stoking the stove, turns. She glances nervously
in the direction of the bedroom. Wyatt shifts his glance to
the fireplace -- there is no gun hanging from the hooks above
the mantel. Lednov appears in the doorway of the bedroom.
WYATT
What are you doin' --
LEDNOV
Lookin' around.
He crosses to the fireplace. He is carrying Wyatt's rifle,
gun belt and six gun.
LEDNOV
These all the shells you got?
Wyatt has had as much of this as he can stand. He starts
angrily across the room.
WYATT
Put my guns down and get out of here --
MRS. WYATT
Ed -- no, Ed.
She crosses to him and stands in his way. Wyatt pushes past
her and grabs for the guns. Lednov gives him a swipe with
the back of his hand, knocking him away easily.
LEDNOV
Your old woman's got sense -- you
listen to her.
Mrs. Wyatt helps Ed to his feet. She puts an arm around him.
LEDNOV
I asked you -- these all the shells
you got?
MRS. WYATT
(quickly)
They's a box in the cupboard over
the sink.
Lednov crosses to the cupboard and opens it. Finding the box
of shells, he slips it in his pocket.
LEDNOV
(to Ed)
Get on about your chores.
(to Mrs. Wyatt)
And hurry that grub up.
Wyatt and his wife look at each other. Then meekly they obey.
DISSOLVE OUT
ANGLED THROUGH window, PAST Wyatt. Clay opens the gate and
hurries up the steps and across the porch.
Wyatt goes to the stove and starts stoking the fire. Mrs.
Wyatt takes the lamp from the wall bracket and goes into the
bedroom.
FULL SHOT. It is a pleasant room with a large, handmade,
double bed, white flour sack curtains at wide windows. Mrs.
Wyatt puts the lamp on the dresser. Going to the bed she
pulls back the covers, feels the sheets.
MRS. WYATT
(calling)
Wrap a stove lid in dish towels and
bring it in here. This bed's like
ice.
MED. SHOT
Turning from the bed, she crosses to the dresser. Beside the
dresser is a camel-back trunk. She starts to open a dresser
drawer, pauses and looks down at the trunk. Moving to the
trunk, she hesitates. Then making up her mind, she bends
down and throws open the trunk.
MED. CLOSE SHOT
DOWN ANGLE. A girl's clothing is neatly packed in the trunk.
A framed picture is face down on top of the clothing. Mrs.
Wyatt kneels by the trunk, pushes the dresses aside and finds
a nightgown. CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS as she rises and shakes it
out. It is frilly, dainty, very feminino; obviously the
nightdress of a young girl. She closes the trunk, turns and
as she goes to the bed, Wyatt comes through the door carrying
the towel-wrapped stove lid. She lays the nightgown on the
bed, takes the stove lid and puts it between the sheets.
Wyatt is staring down at the garment.
WYATT
(cold)
Put it back.
They face each other. Wyatt reaches out and takes the
nightgown.
MRS. WYATT
Someone might as well get some good
out of it. Wyatt crosses to the trunk.
MRS. WYATT
It isn't as if she was dead.
Wyatt opens the trunk, puts the nightgown in and closes the
lid.
WYATT
(cold)
It stays there, understand!
The slamming of a door o.s. interrupts them. They turn and
start for the door.
MRS. WYATT
(calling)
Right in here, Mr. Phillips.
She follows Wyatt to the doorway, CAMERA DOLLYING WITH her.
She stops in the doorway.
ANGLED PAST Mrs. Wyatt. Clay, carrying Elaine, bundled in
blankets, comes forward. Wyatt has stopped just inside the
kitchen. Mary and Helen follow Clay through the door.
MRS. WYATT
The bed's all ready and warm --
She stops, staring at the girl.
MED. CLOSE SHOT
The Wyatts in the doorway. They recognize the girl. Wyatt's
expression hardens. Clay, carrying Elaine, pushes between
them into the bedroom.
MED. SHOT. Clay carries the girl to the bed and gently puts
her down. Her eyes are closed. Slowly the Wyatts enter the
room to stand close together staring at the girl on the bed.
Clay suddenly realizes that something is wrong. He glances
up. Elaine opens her eyes and looks up at her mother and
father.
MRS. WYATT
(softly to Wyatt)
Go out and make some coffee.
Wyatt doesn't move.
MRS. WYATT
Go on. You too, Mr Phillips.
As Clay waits, Wyatt moves through the door unable to argue
back.
FULL SHOT. Mary and Helen stand close to the steve, looking
anxiously toward the bedroom door as Clay and Wyatt come
out. Clay closes the door. Wyatt, dazed by the shock of seeing
his daughter again, stands momentarily staring at the closed
door. Then very slowly he turns and looks at Helen and Mary.
MED. SHOT
his ANGLE. Mary and Helen, seeing the two men's expressions,
look from one to the other, puzzled.
MARY
Is she very sick?
WYATT
(cold, flat)
Get 'em out of here. I won't have
'em in this house.
He crosses to the kitchen door, exits, slamming the door
behind him.
MARY
(softly)
So that was why she tried to run
away.
CLAY
(sharp)
Didn't you know she had a father and
mother out here?
MARY
(hurt and angry)
I didn't know anything about her
except she wanted a job because some
man had left her stranded. I couldn't
leave her in the street. Let's go.
CLAY
Hold on.
MARY
We can't stay here!
CLAY
It's a long walk back to Aspen.
Turning from them, he exits. Mary and Helen look at each
other. Then Helen grins wryly and goes over to the cupboard.
HELEN
I don't know about you. But I'm not
being thrown out on an empty stomach.
Helen is sitting at the table, eating a piece of bread and
drinking coffee. Mary stands at the window. Steve is heard
coming up the steps and across the porch. He pushes the door
open and enters.
STEVE
(cheerfully)
Where do I put your things?
Mary turns from the window.
MARY
Back in the wagon.
Steve stands with his arms full, looking at Mary.
STEVE
Aren't we stayin'?
MARY
No. We're not stayin' --
She crosses to him and smiles wryly.
MARY
Everything's all mixed up, so don't
ask questions.
Steve hesitates.
MARY
(soft)
Go on, Steve.
Steve exits.
MED. SHOT. Mary crosses to the stove.
HELEN
Sit down and eat, why don't you?
Mary lifts the stove lid and puts a stick in the firebox.
HELEN
It isn't like this was the first
place we were ever thrown out of.
MARY
That's not what's worryin' me. Why
didn't she tell us? Maybe we could
have done somethin' -- gone somewhere
else -- puttin' a poor sick kid
through this --
HELEN
Quit worryin' about Elaine.
She motions to the bedroom door.
HELEN
She's home, isn't she? So worry about
us. We want to get to Sonora.
Footsteps across the porch. The two girls look toward the
door.
ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT
SHOOTING PAST Mary. The door slowly opens. Wyatt enters. He
crosses to the bedroom door, CAMERA PANNING WITH him. It is
as though he doesn't see the two women. He stands in front
of the door, staring at it. Then his hand moves to the knob.
Slowly he turns the knob and opens the door. The two girls
watch him as he hesitates on the threshold. Then he enters
and closes the door softly. Helen looks over at Mary and
smiles.
MED. SHOT as Wyatt stops, looking at Elaine, resting back
against the pillow, seeming very young in the nightgown. For
a moment it is difficult to know what is in Wyatt's mind.
Then he sees the twin tintypes. CAMERA MOVES TOWARD Wyatt's
face as tears come to his eyes.
MED. SHOT as footsteps cross the porch and the screen door
creaks open. Clay enters the kitchen, carrying the girls'
suitcases and some blankets. He nods to the girls, then goes
to the door leading to the other bedroom. There he stops.
CLAY
This will be your room until Mr.
Wyatt finds time to take you to the
nearest stage station.
As he carries their belongings in:
DISSOLVE OUT
The room is lighted only by the moonlight. Mary and Helen
are in the big four poster bed, close to the window. Clay's
footsteps are heard on the porch. The kitchen door closes
softly. There is the rattle of a stove lid being lifted.
HELEN
(whispering)
That sounds like him.
Mary slides out of bed and slips into a robe.
HELEN
This time don't talk about cooking!
Clay turns from the stove to the cupboard over the sink and
takes down a coffee cup. The door into Elaine's bedroom is
closed. The door into Mary's bedroom opens and Mary enters
the kitchen. He turns back to the stove and fills his cup as
Mary comes up.
CLAY
Coffee?
MARY
No, thanks.
(indicating Elaine's
bedroom)
I hope we won't be a burden to them.
CLAY
I hope so, too.
He picks up his coffee and goes out on the porch. Mary
hesitates, then follows.
MED. SHOT. Save for the moonlight coming through the window,
the room is dark. Mary enters softly, throws off her robe
and slips into bed beside Helen.
MED. CLOSE
on bed. Moonlight falls across the bed. Mary pulls the covers
up. Helen turns her head.
HELEN
Did you make it interesting?
Mary snuggles down on the pillow.
MARY
I tried my best, but these things
take time.
HELEN
And we're running out of that.
MARY
There's still tomorrow morning.
DISSOLVE
MED. LONG SHOT - ANGLED THROUGH window PAST Mary. The early
morning sun fills the yard. Steve is in the corral harnessing
the mules. Clay and Wyatt are taking Mary's and Helen's trunks
out of the wagon.
HELEN'S VOICE
Those trunks look like ours.
Mary, who was in profile, turns.
MARY
They are.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Helen is seated at the table. Mary stands with her back to
the window near the sink.
HELEN
How long do you think we'll have to
stay here?
MARY
Until Pa gets around to driving us
to Minden.
HELEN
We don't want to go there.
MARY
No we don't. But that's where we're
going. From Minden we take a stage
to Reno, then another one over to
Auburn and another one to Placerville.
Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
HELEN
Clay could save us an awful lot of
time.
MARY
He certainly could. About a month.
HELEN
What are you waiting for? Do
something.
Mary comes over to stand by the table. Her expression is
thoughtful.
HELEN
(sharp)
You're not giving up?
MARY
How many ways can a man say no.
Helen rises. Her manner is determined.
HELEN
(crosses to door)
Maybe I better start working on him.
MARY
You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's
sake, at least...
CLOSE SHOT
as she stops, apparently inspired by Mary's last remark. She
looks out into the yard where Clay is working on the wagon.
ANOTHER ANGLE
SHOOTING TOWARD Elaine's bedroom door. Helen crosses to Mary.
HELEN
(sweetly)
If you can't bring him around, nobody
can.
She puts her arm around Mary's shoulder.
HELEN
Go on. Have another try at him.
MARY
What's the use.
HELEN
(cajoling)
Please. Maybe he'll take a good look
at you and stop thinking so much
about his horses.
As she speaks she edges Mary to the door leading outside.
HELEN
A man has only so many no's in him.
Mary smiles at her, shrugs and exits. Helen looks after her.
Mary's footsteps are heard going down the steps. Then Helen
swings around and going to Elaine's door, opens it.
MED. SHOT. Elaine is sitting up in bed. There is a small
table by the bed and on it is a breakfast tray. Mrs. Wyatt
sits by the bed. Elaine looks happy for the first time. Mrs.
Wyatt is holding a cup to her lips. Helen enters and closes
the door.
HELEN
Look at you, sitting up already.
Crossing to the bed she takes the cup from Mrs. Wyatt.
HELEN
Let me do this while you get some
breakfast.
MRS. WYATT
But I like to do it.
HELEN
You're worn out.
As she pushes Mrs. Wyatt toward the door.
HELEN
Now don't argue. You've got two able-
bodied girls to help you so take
advantage of it. And don't let me
catch you touching the dishes.
She closes the door behind Mrs. Wyatt and comes back, sits
on the edge of the bed and holds the cup to Elaine's lips.
HELEN
Well -- it's going to be good for
all of us -- having a nice long rest
here. After all -- Sonora will still
be there next month. Maybe we can
rehearse a new number -- try it out
on your folks.
Elaine tries not to show her panic at this suggestion.
ELAINE
Helen -- why don't you and Mary go
on with Clay?
HELEN
He won't take us.
(then, hurt)
Don't you want us around?
ELAINE
Of course I do -- but it'd be better
for you -- and the house is kind of
small --
HELEN
If you're worried about Mary and me
talkin' too much, don't. No matter
how many questions your old man asks.
We know how to keep our mouths shut.
ELAINE
It isn't that --
HELEN
Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get
you well quick as we can so we can
all get out of here.
ELAINE
But I want to stay.
HELEN
Drink this and stop being silly. Why
would anyone want to live in this
place. You might as well be dead and
buried. Nothing to do but look at
mountains. In a week you'd be talking
to yourself.
(then, brightly)
Maybe that's what got you started in
the first place.
Elaine pushes the cup away, sits up straighter.
ELAINE
(distraught)
I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying
here where I belong.
HELEN
Not if I know Mary. When she rides
into Sonora, you'll be with her. And
mighty glad to be there after this.
I don't see how you stood it as long
as you did.
ELAINE
(sobbing)
Stop it -- stop it.
HELEN
(contrite)
Darling -- now I've got you all upset.
Elaine buries her head in the pillow.
ELAINE
Go away -- please.
HELEN
That's right -- you go back to sleep.
Tomorrow when you feel better things
will look a whole lot different.
Don't you worry about anything --
Mary's going to talk things over
with your folks --
Elaine sits up and grabs Helen's arm.
ELAINE
(fiercely)
She mustn't -- don't you let her --
HELEN
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
ELAINE
(wildly)
If she says anything to them I'll
kill her.
The door opens and Mrs. Wyatt enters. She hurries over to
the bed, pushes Helen aside, and takes the sobbing girl in
her arms.
ELAINE
(sobbing)
I don't want to leave you, ever.
Mrs. Wyatt flares at Helen.
MRS. WYATT
What did you do to her?
HELEN
Nothing. The poor child's worried
about Mary --
Turning, she goes to the door.
HELEN
I won't let her say anything --
She exits.
MED. SHOT. Leaving the door open, Helen enters the kitchen.
She glances back at the bedroom, half smiling, then crosses
to the window and looks out.
MED. SHOT. Helen turns from the window and walks hurriedly
to the second bedroom door. Clay's footsteps cross the porch.
Helen enters the bedroom and closes the door as Clay comes
in. Clay looks around, then seeing the open bedroom door,
crosses to it.
ANGLED PAST Clay in doorway. Mrs. Wyatt is holding the sobbing
girl in her arms. She looks over at Clay.
CLAY
Well, I'm off --
Then realizing that something is wrong he steps into the
bedroom.
MED. SHOT
CLAY
(puzzled)
What's the matter?
Hearing his voice, Elaine lifts her head from her mother's
shoulder.
ELAINE
Don't let them stay here, Mr.
Phillips. They'll spoil everything.
Clay looks from one to the other, frowning. Elaine tries to
get out of bed. Her mother holds her.
ELAINE
(wildly)
Take them with you -- Mary's going
to talk to dad -- she's going to
keep talking and talking to me until
maybe I won't want to stay here --
MRS. WYATT
Please take them.
CLAY
I can't --
ELAINE
You've got to -- don't you understand --
they want me with them and they'll
fix it so I have to go --
CLAY
(sharp)
No they won't.
Turning, he exits. Mrs. Wyatt holds Elaine close.
The shelter is dark. Lednov strikes a match and looks around.
The place is empty. There is a bunk, made up. On the left
hand wall a curtain of gunny sacks covers the clothes hanging
there. The match burns down to Lednov's fingers. There is a
SOUND of a scuffle outside a blow, and a groan. Lednov drops
the match and hurries out.
MED. SHOT. Shelves filled with bottles line the room, for
the doctor is also the druggist. There is a glass cabinet in
which are the doctor's instruments. The room is cluttered.
The lamp, held by Clay, throws a circle of pale light down
on Steve. The doctor is working on Steve's shoulder and arm.
MED. CLOSE - UP ANGLE
featuring Clay. Clay suddenly averts his glance and winces
as the doctor probes the wound in Steve's arm. Steve groans.
The lamp wavers.
DOCTOR
(sharply)
Hold her steady. I'm not hurting
him.
STEVE
Maybe you're not, but I'll sure be
glad when you stop pokin' me.
Footsteps are HEARD approaching. Clay tries to steady his
shaking hand. He is focusing his attention on a far wall. A
woman's hand comes in the scene and takes the lamp from him.
He reacts. CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Mary, who has moved
in beside him.
CLOSE SHOT
Steve. He smiles up at Mary.
MED. CLOSE SHOT
ANGLES PAST doctor.
MARY
Is it very bad?
DOCTOR
(grumbling)
Course not. A scratch.
He suddenly realizes that a strange woman is in the room and
reacts.
DOCTOR
What are you doin' here?
MARY
Holding the lamp.
DOCTOR
Then hold it a little lower.
Mary lowers the lamp.
CLOSE SHOT
Clay and Mary. UP ANGLE PAST lamp.
CLAY
Thanks for taking over.
MARY
(softly)
Thanks for loading me on the stage.
I know now why you did it.
CLAY
Like I said, women get in the way
sometimes.
STEVE'S VOICE
He tried to get rid of me, too, Miss
Wells.
DOCTOR
Keep still, will you.
He straightens into the shot. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO MED. SHOT.
Steve is now bandaged.
DOCTOR
Put him over there on the cot.
Goodnight... He'll be all right.
As Clay lifts Steve to the cot the doctor exits. Mary watches
Clay cover Steve. Then she goes to the door leading to the
street, stops with her hand on the knob.
MARY
Goodnight.
STEVE
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
MARY
(looking back)
If you need me, I'll be --
Clay straightens and turns.
CLAY
Where you going?
MARY
To the other side of the street.
She opens the door and starts out.
ANGLED PAST Steve on cot. In the b.g. through the open
doorway, Clay and Mary kiss. Steve watches a moment, then
turns his head toward camera. He smiles and closes his eyes.
