      ALICIA.  Being questioned.  As usual.  

                                  SHERIFF (O.S.)
                    And there s no contraband in the 
                    apartment?

                                  ALICIA
                    That s correct.

                                  SHERIFF
                    Any firearms?

                                  ALICIA
                    None. 

                                  SHERIFF
                    Any other weapons of any kind?

      Alicia pauses, stares at the COOK COUNTY SHERIFF.  Tall, 
      muscular, not unkind.  Official language, but human delivery. 

                                  ALICIA
                    Well, knives.  Do they count?

                                  SHERIFF
                    What kind of knives?

                                  ALICIA
                    Steak knives.  

                                  SHERIFF
                    Can I see them please?

      Okay.  Alicia opens a drawer.  Kitchen knives.  The Sheriff 
      inspects them, concludes:

                                  SHERIFF (CONT D)
                    That s fine.  Which room would your 
                    husband inhabit?    

      Alicia pauses, leads him toward the maid s quarters.  Points 
    in.  Not bad.  Snug, but warm.  The sheriff looks it over.

                                  SHERIFF (CONT D)
                    Ifthe judge approves electronic

                    by the front door for the receiver.  
                    Do you have wifi?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #113     "Hi"     GREEN COLLATED     1/7/10       2.

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes. 

                                  SHERIFF
                    I ll have to test it to make sure 
                    there s no interference.

      Alicia nods, looks up to see JACKIE watching from the 
      kitchen: still pale from her stroke, but mobile, feisty.

                                  SHERIFF (CONT D)
                    Now I have to ask your children a 
                    few questions if you don t mind.  

                                  ALICIA
                    What kind of questions?

                                  SHERIFF
                    Nothing invasive.  The same 
                    questions I asked you.
                          (off Alicia s reluctance)
                    Please.

      Okay.  Alicia leads him toward the living room:

                                  ALICIA
                    Zach.  Grace.

      A fascinated ZACH and GRACE have been listening all along and 
    pop out of the living room, ready:  Yeah?    What? 

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Do either of you have contraband in 
                    your rooms?

    The Sheriff looks toward Alicia, not what he expected.  Zach 
    and Grace take a second.

                                  ZACH & GRACE
                    No. 

                                  ALICIA
                    Do you have firearms?

                                  ZACH & GRACE
                          (trade a look)
                    No.

                                  ALICIA
                    Any other weapons?

      They shake their heads as Alicia s cellphone rings...


                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #113     "Hi"     GREEN COLLATED     1/7/10       3.

                    I think that should do it.  Would 
                    you excuse me, Sheriff?
                          (answering)
                    Hello?

                                  DIANE (O.S.)
                    Alicia?  Hello, this is Diane.  I m 
                    sorry to interrupt your evening, but 
                    we ve had-- we need you to come in. 

      Alicia looks up at Jackie, Zach, Grace, the Sheriff.

                                  ALICIA
                    Now?

                                  DIANE (O.S.)
                    Yes, I m sorry.  It s very 
                    important.

    And we re with...


      ...DIANE, in an elegant dress-- as if called from a party-- 
      rushing down the 28th floor hall.  (We should say right now-- 
      everything in this episode happens at a rush.)

                                  DIANE
                    And could you bring a few things?  
                      Toiletries, clothing for 48 hours.  
                    And a man s tie... 

      And-- ding-- the elevator doors open, a woman exiting.  SONYA 
      RUCKER (35).  African-American, a power woman in a power 
      suit.  CEO of an internet firm.  

                                  DIANE (CONT D)
                    Sonya, I m so sorry.

      Sonya opens her mouth: used to knowing exactly what to say.  
    But she starts to cry.  Diane reaches out, hugs her, as...


                                  JACKIE
                    What is it about?

      Alicia finding a man s tie in her closet, stuffing it quickly 
      into a small overnight bag.

                    just a phone call away.  

      Jackie nods, smiles.  Some kind of corner turned in their 
      relationship?  More understanding.

                                  JACKIE
                    Is Peter really coming home?

                    I don t know.  They just do this to

      Alicia starts out; and we re suddenly with...


      ...CARY kissing a pretty SEATTLE CHICK passionately, half-
      undressed.  Whispering.  Just the two...

                                  CARY
                    So when is something supposed to happen?

                    About an hour.  Maybe more. You never

      Seattle laughs, pulls at his shirt...

                                  CARY (CONT D)
                    So, what, does your face turn into 
                    a cow s head or something?

                    Just wait.  24 hours of bliss.

    But Cary s cellphone rings.  He reaches down for it...

                                  SEATTLE CHICK (CONT D)
                    No, no!  No cellphones.

                                  CARY
                    Hey!

    He kneels down, hearing the muffled ringing, as Seattle Chick 
      collects his discarded clothes.  Answering the phone... 

                                  CARY (CONT D)

                    tomorrow off, but we need you in, now.   

      Will, in gym clothes, with gym bag, rushing into the lobby...

                                  CARY
                    Ummm, okay.  I-- Why, what is it?

                    on hold for 48 hours, okay?  

      Shit.  Cary looks around, sees Seattle Chick dumping his 
      clothes out the front door.

                                  CARY
                    Hey!

    He races for them, while...

      ...Will hangs up, dials again, pushes the elevator button... 

                                  WILL

      Diane questions an overwrought, rambling Sonya:

                                  SONYA RUCKER
                    I was at work.  Our security company 
                    called.  A panic alarm was triggered at 
                    home and no one was picking up.  So I 
                    rushed home-- the security guard was 
                    there, but I-- I ran to the twins  room. 


                                  EUGENE HORNER
                    The kids were fine.   She took them 
                    to their grandparents.  

    The security guard.  EUGENE HORNER (29).  A suburban Dirty 
      Harry.  Excited by all the attention.  Burtonand Johnson *
      question him in the upscale living room, Kalinda watching. 

                                  EUGENE HORNER (CONT D)
                    I said she should wait for you guys 
                    here-- that you d want to talk to 
                    her and Mr. Rucker.

                                  DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    So Mr. Rucker was with her?  

                                  EUGENE HORNER
                    No, it was just her.  

      Kalinda takes everything in.  Children s toys on the floor.  
      A little baggie of pot.  A half-smoked joint perched on the 
      edge of a coaster/ash tray.

      Kalinda sees the fireplace.  A stand holding a fireplace

      toward the floor.  The blood getting thicker, thicker.Pools 
    of it now.  Hushed.  Just Murphy s voice...

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON(CONT D)*
                    More struggle.  More defensive 
                    spray.  On the door.  Handprint.  
                    What s this?

      A black dot on the floor-- about the size of a dime.  Blood 
    all over it.  Burtonkneels, studies it.  A black rubber nub.  *

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON(CONT D)*
                    Hey, Brian.  Get a picture of this?  
                    What is it?

    The CSI snaps pictures, as Kalinda studies it too.

                                  KALINDA
                    Looks like a rubber nub from under 
                      a computer.

      Burton, Johnson, the CSI look over at her.  She shrugs:*

                                  KALINDA (CONT D)
                    Just a guess.

      Meanwhile, Burtoncarefully nudges the door open.  It s a *
      beautiful white-tiled master bathroom, but it s been sprayed 
      with blood, and a pale naked body lies crumpled on the floor, 
      halfway into the shower stall, the walk-in door open.

                                  DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    Is that the babysitter?      THE GOOD WIFE #113     "Hi"     GREEN COLLATED     1/7/10       10.




                                  SONYA RUCKER
                    Yes.  Lisa Pruitt.  I found her-- 
                    she was-- in my bathroom.  

      Sonya swallows tearfully, studying a photo of a sweet young 
      English major pulled from her Facebook page.

                                  DIANE
                    I m sorry to ask you this, Sonya, 
                    but our investigator at the scene 
                    is saying there was marijuana.  Did 
                    Jason smoke pot?  

                                  SONYA RUCKER
                    No.  I mean, in college.  Why?


      JASON RUCKER (34).  Handsome, Caucasian, professorial.  With 
    an antic spirit.  A grown boy.  And unaware that he s on the 
      verge of having his life explode.  He approaches the lobby 
      elevators, smiles at Alicia approaching the other way, with 
    her night bag.  They push the up button.  He recognizes her:

                                  JASON RUCKER
                    Sorry.  You re...?  

      Alicia smiles, nods, used to it.  Something cheerful, not 
      dangerous about this guy.

                                  JASON RUCKER (CONT D)
                    You get that a lot?

                                  ALICIA
                    Less so.

                                  JASON RUCKER
                    Sorry, I m a news junkie.  Your 
                    husband-- I heard he s getting out.

                                  ALICIA
                    I don t know.  It changes day to day.

                                  JASON RUCKER
                    I hope he does.   

                                  ALICIA
                    Thank you.

      Ding-- the elevator arrives, and...      THE GOOD WIFE #113     "Hi"     GREEN COLLATED     1/7/10       11.




                                  JASON RUCKER
                    Which floor?

                                  ALICIA
                          (surprised)
                    You just pushed it.

                                  JASON RUCKER
                    Oh, you work at Stern, Lockhart?  
                    Then maybe you know what this is 
                    about?  Something about my wife s 
                    company? 

                                  ALICIA
                    Sorry.  Junior Associate.  I m the 
                    last to know.

      Ding-- the doors open on the 28th floor, revealing Sonya 
      there.  She goes to her husband, hugs him, holds him tight.  

                                  JASON RUCKER
                    What s wrong?  What happened?

                                  SONYA RUCKER
                    I...

    But she starts to cry.  Uh-oh, Jason pales...

                                  JASON RUCKER
                    The twins--?

    No, no, Sonya shakes her head, crying, as Alicia eyes the two.  

                                  WILL
                    Mr. Rucker, do you have a second?

      They turn to see Will coming out of the conference room.


      Kalinda stands behind, just observing, as Johnson and Burton*
      lean over the pale, bloody corpse, hushed...

                                  DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    Not a knife.  Those aren t deep 
                    enough for knife wounds.  

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON*
                    Looks like a blunt instrument.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #113     "Hi"     GREEN COLLATED     1/7/10       12.

                                  DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    Something from the bedroom?

      They look around as Kalinda watches them.  

                                  KALINDA
                    Check the fireplace poker 
                      downstairs.  It s missing.

      Johnson finally sighs... 

                                  DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    You ve seen enough.  Let s go.


      A stunned Jason stares at Will, Alicia, Cary.  Having just 
      heard what happened.  He starts to say something.  Stops.  

                                  JASON RUCKER
                    Oh my god.  I... But I just saw her.

                                  WILL
                    You just saw her-- the babysitter-- 
                    when you picked her up?

                                  JASON RUCKER
                    Yes.  I picked her up at her dorm, 
                    and drove her to...
                          (slowing down as he 
                            realizes)
                    I m in trouble?  I m the last one 
                    who saw her?  They ll suspect me?

                                  WILL
                    Yes.

                                  JASON RUCKER
                    On my god.

      Alicia watches, sympathizing.  As Cary next to her raises his 
      hand, stares at it.  Um, Alicia turns to him: what are you doing?

                                  JASON RUCKER (CONT D)
                    Then why--?  I need to go to the 
                    police, don t I?

                                  WILL
                    I just spoke to them.  I agreed to 
                    surrender you in the morning.  
                                  (MORE)

                    But these first few hours of an 
                      investigation are always the most 
                    important.  Anything can be 
                    misinterpreted.

                                  JASON RUCKER
                    Well, won t my coming here-- be 
                    misinterpreted?

      Alicia sees Cary starting to move his hand from side-to-side, 
    up and down.  Um.

                                  WILL
                      Unfortunately it s a risk we have to 
                    take.  This early in an investigation, 
                    it s all about leverage.  You have the 
                    right to remain silent, so our leverage 
                    is in how much access we allow the 
                    police.  They want more.  We want less.  
                    So we are the gatekeepers to... you. 

                                  CARY
                    Yep.

      Will looks over at Cary-- um, what s that about?-- but a 
      balding man with a suitcase passes in the hall.  

                                  WILL
                    We are going to have you take a 
                    polygraph, Mr. Rucker.  This is not 
                    about truth or innocence.  

                                  JASON RUCKER
                    I m sorry-- a lie detector test?

      Will nods, as he motions to the balding man to enter. 

                                  WILL
                    Yes, I need information.  It s 
                    about how much to let you talk vs. 
                    how much to keep you silent.  

      Alicia hands Jason the tie she brought in:

                                  ALICIA
                    Here you go.

                                  JASON RUCKER
                    Thank you.  

      Meanwhile, Will sees his cellphone ringing, steps away...




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #113     "Hi"     GREEN COLLATED     1/7/10       14.

      INTERCUT with...


      Skiddddd--squad cars skid up outside the building, sirens 
      screaming!  As upstairs...


      ...Will watches the polygraph test, Alicia and Cary standing 
      behind him:

                                  WILL
                    In about five minutes the police 
                    are going to burst through these 
                    doors.  I need you to be on for the 
                    next 48 hours.  That s how long 
                    they have to charge him with murder 
                    or release him.

      Alicia sees Cary starting to raise his hand again.  She 
      reaches out, stops him.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #113     "Hi"     GREEN COLLATED     1/7/10       15.

                    It s now the most crucial 48 hours of his 
                    life. If the police charge him, bail s a 
                    long shot and he could be in prison for a 
                    year before he comes to trial.

      Cary tries to pull his hand away, but Alicia holds on.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    Even if he s found innocent, that s a 
                    year of his life gone.  So these 48 
                    hours are like a mini-trial.  We need 
                    to get the cops to look somewhere 
                    else and get him released.  Okay?

                                  ALICIA
                    I rode up in the elevator with him.  
                    Either he s the best actor in the world 
                    or he didn t know any of this happened.  

                                  WILL
                    Okay, good.  It would be nice if he 
                    was innocent.  It s a better hand-- 

      Ding-- two elevators arrive-- and BOOOOM!--four cops pile 
      out, heading toward the conference room...

    But Burtonignores him, sees Jason in the conference room, *
      plows inside, rips him from the incomplete polygraph test:

      PETER FLORRICK enters court between two guards.  In all his 
      suited glory: big man on campus...

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    Hey, Dominic, how are the kids?  
                    Cammy, you look like you re getting 
                    younger.  How s it going, Frank?

      DANIEL GOLDEN eyes Peter joining him at the defense table.

                                  DANIEL GOLDEN
                    You seem happy.

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    The fog dissipates, the rain 
                    clears, and everything makes sense.

                                  DANIEL GOLDEN
                    You made a decision?

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    Yep.  Where s Alicia?

    But Peter sees GLENN CHILDS entering court, starting toward 
    the prosecutor s table, pausing beside him...

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                    What offer might that be?

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                          (smiles)
                    Freedom today-- if I don t fight 
                    the conviction, stay disbarred, 
                    can t run again.

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                    Oh, yes, that offer.  The smart move 
                    would be to take it, so I think I 
                    know what you re going to say.

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                     Go to hell? 

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                    Something like that.

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    Do you want the longer version?

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                    Can t wait.

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    I m coming for you.  Watch your 
                    back.  I m coming.

      Childs smiles, shakes his head, goes to the prosecutor table.  
      Peter whispers to Golden, determined:

                                  PETER FLORRICK (CONT D)
                    I m testifying.

                                  DANIEL GOLDEN
                    Would it help if I told you that s 
                    a mistake?

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    If I end up in a twelve by twelve 
                    cell for the next nine years, I want 
                    to know I did everything I could.  
                    Try Alicia again.

      Golden nods, turns to his cell, dials, as... 


      ...Alicia checks her cellphone...  No Service.   She and Cary 
    sit with a nervous Jason, waiting in a cinder block 
      interrogation room.  Bare boned.  Video camera on a tripod.  
    No one-way mirror.  Just a window looking out. 

                                  JASON RUCKER
                    I liked her.  I wouldn t hurt her.

      Alicia looks at the camera, goes to it, checking: it s off.

                                  ALICIA
                    You were at the movies?

                                  JASON RUCKER 
                     Legend of Condor Hero.   It s a

                                  JASON RUCKER
                    Wuxia.  Wire-fu.  Chinese flying.

                                  ALICIA
                    Oh, like  Crouching Tiger ?

      Jason gives her a look.  Clearly a tourist.  Alicia smiles.

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Sorry.

                                  JASON RUCKER
                    They play them every Thursday night 
                    at Armour Square.  Chinatown.

                                  ALICIA
                    Do you have the ticket stub?

                                  JASON RUCKER
                    No, I threw it away.

                                  ALICIA
                    You--?  Okay, we ll have to find 
                    someone there who saw you.

                                  CARY
                    My shoes feel like they re walking 
                    on their own.

      They both look at Cary.

                                  ALICIA
                    Cary, could I talk to you a second?

    And she steps away.  Cary grins, follows her...

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Are you on something? 

                                  CARY
                    No.  I like you, Alicia. 

                                  ALICIA
                    I like you too.  I need you to pull 
                    it together.

                                  CARY
                    Okay.  Here we go.  Pulling.

      Alicia sighs, peers out, sees... 


      ...Will and Detective Johnson, as different as two people can 
    be, negotiating in whispers...  

                                  WILL
                    I showed you his lie detector test--

                                  DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    --a partialtest youconducted--

                    --By a top FBI polygraphist; and he 
                    was passing with flying colors.   

                                  DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    Then let me question him.  

                                  WILL
                    With conditions.  

                                  DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    I could charge him right now.

                                  WILL
                    Then do it.  What s stopping you?

      Johnson stares at Will, doesn t like him.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    You don t have enough.  Two of my 
                    lawyers stay in with him at all 
                    times.  They have freedom to 
                    consult privately with camera off.  
                    15 minute breaks every hour.

                                  DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    What, no food?

                                  WILL
                    Pizza.  In one hour.

      Johnson stares at him, frowns, clearly going to give in, while... 


      ...Will looks up from his cell, reading the text as Detective 
      Johnson continues to question a nervous Jason.

                                  DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    Then what did you do?

                                  JASON RUCKER
                    Well, I dropped her at the house.  
                    I made sure she had my cell number, 
                    then I went to the movies.

                                  WILL
                    Did you see the security guard 
                    anywhere near the house?

      Johnson looks over at Will, smiles, sees what he s doing.

                                  JASON RUCKER
                    The guard?  Sure.  He s always around.

                                  WILL
                    Have you seen him around much when 
                    you dropped off Lisa Pruitt?

                                  JASON RUCKER
                    I guess.

                    Yes, thank you, Mr. Gardner, we re 
                    following all leads.

                                  WILL
                    Really, because I see you have another 
                      interrogation room unoccupied.  


      Peter Florrick.  He straightens his tie as he sits.  On the 
      stand.  Clearing his throat.  Golden faces him.

                                  DANIEL GOLDEN
                    So... very simply, you are in jail 
                    right now, sir, because you D.P. ed
                    cases?  Is that right?  

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    Yes, sir.

                                  DANIEL GOLDEN
                    Could you explain?

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    Well, D.P. means  Declining to 
                      Prosecute.   It s when a State s 
                    Attorney moves an investigation from 
                    an active stage to an inactive one.

                                  DANIEL GOLDEN
                    And you did this often?

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    Yes, pretty much every day during the 
                    six years I served.  A State s 
                    Attorney s job-- which even our 
                    current State s Attorney should know--

    He nods toward Childs at the prosecution table beside LANDRY.

                                  PETER FLORRICK (CONT D)
                    --is about marshalling your troops: 
                    using your limited resources for 
                    greatest advantage.

      Judge Winter sits back listening.  

                                  DANIEL GOLDEN
                    And what cases did you decline to 
                    prosecute?


                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #113     "Hi"     GREEN COLLATED     1/7/10       25.

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                      Investigations into allegedly 
                    corrupt real estate practices.  
                      Speculators were buying up depressed 
                    properties around the land where 
                    Olympic stadiums were to be built.

                                  DANIEL GOLDEN
                    So?  Why did you stop these 
                    investigations?  They sound promising.

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    For a very simple reason.  Lashkar-e-
                    Taiba.  A jihadist extremist group 
                    believed to be active in Chicago and 
                    allegedly involved in the Mumbai 
                    attacks last year.  I pulled 
                      investigators from these other cases 
                    because I thought the pursuit of 
                    Islamic extremists was more important. 

      Childs rolls his eyes.  Can t believe it.  Florrick wrapping 
      himself in the American flag.

                                  DANIEL GOLDEN
                    In fact, wasn t there just an 
                    arrest in December?

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    Yes, sir.  David Coleman Headley. 
                    Allegedly a key L.e.T. member. 

      Golden pauses, pleased at Peter s answer.

                                  DANIEL GOLDEN
                    And why didn t you testify about 
                    all this at your trial?

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    Well, I should have.  But there was 
                    a larger consideration.  A failing 
                    in my personal life-- 

      Peter looks toward the court: no Alicia.

                                  PETER FLORRICK (CONT D)
                    --was being used against me.  I 
                    wanted to protect my family from 
                    further pain; and I knew I couldn t 
                    testify about these false 
                    corruption charges without 
                    testifying about my... life.

                                  JUDGE WINTER
                    Mr. Landry, your witness.

    But Childs reaches over, stops Landry from standing.

                    Actually my witness, your honor.

      Golden and Peter turn toward him, startled.  Simply...

                    Um, your honor... objection.

                    Mr. Childs, you re not the judge here.

                    Apologies, your honor.

                                  DANIEL GOLDEN
                    Mr. Childs is instrumental in the

                    Well, then, let s take a short 
                    break for lunch, and take up right 
                    where we left off.


      Cards, flowers, burned-out candles grouped around a dorm 
      door.  A half-dozen kids support each other.  Kneel.  Weep.  
      Kalinda joins them, sees Burtonand a cop in the dorm room, *
      talking to a roommate.  Meanwhile, in whispers:

                                  BETH
                    She was selling drugs-- I bet it 
                    was a drug deal gone bad. 

      Kalinda turns, interested, to two Juniors gossiping in 
      whispers.  A couple.  English major types.  Wannabe poetess, 
      BETH (21), and MAX (22), long-haired Jack Kerouac vibe.

                                  MAX
                    Come on, you don t know that.  

                                  BETH
                    I knew her better than you did.

                                  MAX
                    I think it was that guy from the 
                    neighborhood where she babysat.  
                    She always said he was a nuisance.  

                                  KALINDA
                    Hi.  Excuse me.  Do you have a 
                    minute?

    Max turns to her, looks her up and down.  Attractive.

                                  BETH
                    I have to get to class.

                                  MAX
                    Are you a cop?

                                  KALINDA
                    Nope.  Homicide.  




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #113     "Hi"     GREEN COLLATED     1/7/10       28.

    Max nods, sounds official.  Kalinda sees the cops finishing 
    up questioning, starting out... 

                                  KALINDA (CONT D)
                    This way please.

                                  MAX
                          (yells back to Beth)
                    See you after Comp.

      Kalinda leads Max down the hall...

                                  KALINDA
                    So what were you saying about Miss 
                    Pruitt s babysitting?  Did she say 
                    something about a security guard?

                                  MAX
                    No.  A security--?  No.  It was the 
                    dad she was working for.  Um, what s 
                    his name?  Burkle?  No, Rucker.   

      Kalinda stares at him.  Damn.  

                                  MAX (CONT D)
                    She said he was getting too close.  
                    Making her uncomfortable.  They 
                    were working on something together.  
                    Some project.  And she said she was 
                    gonna quit.

      Kalinda looks up, sees the police approach.  Uh-oh.

                                  MAX (CONT D)
                    So do you want me to make a 
                    statement or something?

                                  KALINDA
                    Yes, but not right now.  Maybe you 
                    and I could meet up later and I ll 
                    take it down then.  Can I get your 
                    number?

                                  MAX
                          (joking)
                    Yeah, but I m dating somebody.

      Will studies a text on his cellphone, looks up at Cary and 
      Alicia.  Unhappily.  Alicia looks toward him: what?  

                                  DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    So you threw away your ticket stub, 
                    is that it?

                                  JASON RUCKER
                    Yes.

                                  DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    Okay.  And this Chinese movie, what 
                    was it about? 

                                  JASON RUCKER
                     Legend of the Condor Heros?   It s 
                    about two sons learning martial 
                    arts in Mongolia.  

                                  DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    Sounds exciting.  And you know Chinese?

                                  JASON RUCKER
                    Chinese?  No.

                                  DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    So how did you understand it?

                                  JASON RUCKER
                    The subtitles.

                                  DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    Odd.  We checked.  There were no 
                    subtitles on the print last night. 

      Will and Alicia trade a look as Johnson continues:

                                  DETECTIVE JOHNSON (CONT D)
                    Usually there are subtitles.  But 
                    not on that one. 

                                  WILL
                    Let s take a break for a second.

                                  DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    Yes, you do that, Mr. Gardner.  

      Johnson smiles, gets up from the table...

    Oh.  Johnson returns to the camera.  Showily clicks it off.  
      Nothing up his sleeves, exits.

                                  WILL
                    What s going on?  

                                  JASON RUCKER
                    It has nothing to do with this.

                                  WILL
                    Mr. Rucker, you don t understand,

                    you ll be regretting for decades if

                    Yeah.

      Cary.  Oddly repeating.  Alicia and Will look toward him.  

                                  JASON RUCKER
                    Look, I just-- you don t know what 
                    it s like to be out of work: to be 
                    just stuck at home.

                    I do.  So tell me.

                    I... I have a place to work: to 
                    do... I do graphic novels.  But 
                    just on spec.  I m not being paid.

      Will trades a look with Alicia: oh jeez.

                                  ALICIA
                    So you have an office where you do 
                    this work?  That s where you were?  
                    Not at the movies?

                                  JASON RUCKER
                    Yeah, it s just a studio to draw.  
                    It s nothing.  It s the size of a 
                    closet. 

                                  WILL
                    And Lisa Pruitt was working with you?

                    can preserve for our uses anything 
                    you find.

      Alicia frowns as she lets herself...


      ...in, looks at the walls, covered with graphic novel panels.  
      Dark, gritty.  Good stuff.  A small studio.  On the cell...

                                  ALICIA
                    Has Jason said anything?

                                  WILL
                    No.  But the police could 
                      misunderstand something they find.  
                    And Kalinda thinks the security 
                    guard is heating up.

      Alicia frowns.  Doesn t sound kosher to her.  But she looks 
      around.  Studies a desk.  Sees a sheaf of writing.   By Lisa 
      Pruitt  on the title page.  A short story.  

                                  ALICIA
                    There s something written by her.  
                    A short story.

                                  WILL
                    Okay, I think we could use that.

      Alicia pauses.  Fuck.  Is this right?  She looks at the short 
      story, takes it.  Finds underneath it.  A card for a lawyer.  
       Logan & Harper.   She takes that too.  Turns toward the 
      studio s restroom.  Peers in.  A toilet, sink, shower.

                                  ALICIA
                    Blonde hair on a brush.

      Will winces.  Considers it.  Alicia considers it too.

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    What do I do?

                                  WILL
                    Is it a long hair?

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes.

      Will frowns, looks toward Johnson heading toward the 
      interrogation room.

                                  WILL
                    Take it.

      Alicia nods: does so.  Opens the shower door, checks the 
      drain.  

                                  ALICIA
                    No hair in the drain.

                                  WILL
                    Thanks.  Good. 

    She starts to close the shower door when she sees something 
      hanging by the towel.  A piece of clothing?  She lifts it 
      slightly.  A bra.  Alicia winces.  

                                  ALICIA
                    A bra.  By the shower.  

      Will slumps.  Fuck.  Torn.  Running the ethical permutations:

                                  WILL
                    One second.

    But Alicia hears noise outside.  Skidding.  She rushes to the 
      studio window, peers out.  Sees police cars skidding up two 
      stories below.  Dammit.  


                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #113     "Hi"     GREEN COLLATED     1/7/10       35.

                                  ALICIA
                    They re here.

      Hurrying, Alicia hangs up, rushes back into the bathroom, 
      sees a trash pail, empty, a small plastic lining.  Takes the 
      lining, pushes her hand through it to grab the bra, wraps it 
    in the lining.  Frowns.  Fuck.  Fuck.


      Alicia quickly rushes out the studio door.  Takes the key, 
      quickly clicks it back into the hide-a-key compartment.  
      Hearing footsteps coming up the stairs.  

    She sticks it back in the planter, steps down the hall away 
      from the stairs as... 

      ...the cops and Burtonrace to the top, find the door open.  *
      Damn, Alicia didn t close it all the way.  They enter as 
      Alicia exhales and starts down the stairs.

    The plastic lining is put on Will s desk.  The brush.  Then 
    the short story.  Will looks up at Alicia. 

                                  WILL
                    Thanks.  Are you alright?

                                  ALICIA
                    I think so.

                                  WILL
                    You were well within the law?

                                  ALICIA
                     Well ?

                                  WILL
                    You were within the law.  I know 
                    sometimes it feels like a game, but 
                    we re not here to pursue the truth.  
                    We re here to defend a client.

                                  ALICIA
                    And if he s guilty?

                                  WILL
                    Then he s guilty.  Truth is above 
                    our pay grade.

      Alicia nods.  Okay.

                                  ALICIA
                    Who s with Jason now?

      Alicia pauses.  Uh-oh.  Starts to talk, stops.

                    Take a few hours off.  Get some

      Alicia nods, starts out, sees Diane in her office, talking 
      with Sonya...

                                  ALICIA
                    Is she telling her?

                                  WILL
                    Yep.  That can t be a fun 
                      conversation.


    And we re inside now with... Sonya listening.

                                  DIANE
                    Why do you not look surprised?  You 
                    knewhe had a studio?

                                  SONYA RUCKER
                    No, but-- every marriage runs on a few 
                    secrets, Diane.  Men need their caves.  

      Diane studies her.  Her blase reaction.

                                  DIANE
                    Did you know he was working with 
                    her on writing a graphic novel?

                                  SONYA RUCKER
                    No.  I knew something.  It s been 
                    hard for him to be out of work: for 
                    me to be the one making money.  

                                  DIANE
                    And you never thought he and 
                    Lisa...?

                                  SONYA RUCKER
                    Why do I suddenly feel like I m 
                    under suspicion? 

                                  DIANE
                    Sonya.  The question is going to be 
                    asked.  If there s something you 
                    want to tell me, now is a good time.

                                  SONYA RUCKER
                    No.

                                  DIANE 
                    Well is he... innocent?

    Not the answer Diane expected.  She treads carefully:

                                  DIANE
                    Hurting her?  

                                  SONYA RUCKER
                    Yes, he s innocent of that.

                                  DIANE
                    But, sleeping with her?  He s not 
                    innocent of sleeping with her? 

                                  SONYA RUCKER
                          (upset)
                    I don t know. 

                                  DIANE
                    Is there-- I m sorry to do this, Sonya, 
                    but Jason isn t being up-front with us-- 
                    is there anything that would lead the 
                    police to believe he is guilty?

                    Yes, thank you.  And just to be even

                    was away?

      Peter stares right at Alicia as he answers...

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    No.

      Childs appears satisfied with the answer.  Still...

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                    And you know you re under oath?

                          (turns to court reporter)
                    Cammy, I know I m under oath, and I 
                    know that Mr. Childs is attempting 
                    to catch me in a perjury trap, and 
                    yet my answer is still: no.

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                          (smiling)
                    Thank you, Mr. Florrick.

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    No problem.

    And Peter gets up, starts back toward the defense table as 
      Alicia exhales deeply.  Peter sits beside Golden.  At the 
      prosecution table, Childs looks happy and confident.  
      Meanwhile...


      ...Diane paces outside her office, on her cellphone, Sonya 
      still inside behind her... 

                                  DIANE
                    She set up a nanny-cam to tape the 
                    living room.  To see if her husband 
                    was sleeping with the babysitter.

      INTERCUT with...


                                  KALINDA
                    I m not testifying.

      Kalinda following Childs.  An intent Childs.  

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                    Then you re going to jail.

                                  KALINDA
                    I have nothing to offer.

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                    You have everything to offer. And you 
                    know you do. Peter Florrick lied on the 
                    witness stand. Tell the truth and he 
                    spends the next nine years in prison.

                                  KALINDA
                    Don t do this.

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                    Oh, come on, Kalinda, what do you care? 
                    You re out for yourself. You ve always 
                    been out for yourself. And either way, 
                    you re going to tell the truth.

                                  KALINDA
                    You don t know that.

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                    I know the sun is coming up 
                    tomorrow.  I know you re gonna tell 
                    the truth on the stand and Florrick 
                    is going back to prison.

      Childs starts off Kalinda stands there, upset.  Worried.

      Cary stands in a corner, facing the wall, tapping his forehead 
      against the cinder block.  Alicia looks toward him.  Goes to 
      him.

                    I was... freaking out.

                    It was a friend from the Peace

                    Yes.  Cary, I didn t tell him.

                    lined up against us.  I just don t

      Diane finishes conferring with Will and enters her office, 
      faces Sonya, shoots a look toward Sonya s laptop case, zipped 
      open, the aluminum computer peering out.

                    until you got the call from

                    Our investigator checked the nanny-

                                  DIANE
                    Yes.  We thought only four people

                    Justin, your housekeeper, the

                    Yes.  Why?  What s wrong?

                    You signed for delivery at 7:30 pm.

      Alicia studies the lawyers card she found under Lisa s short

      Kalinda sits next to her, sips a drink.  Distracted.

                    Do you want to know?

                                  ALICIA
                    I-- I don t know.  God, I don t know 
                    anymore.  The truth always seemed so 
                    simple.  Lying, not lying.

                                  KALINDA
                    Do you want him out?

      Alicia takes her drinks.  Downs it.

                                  ALICIA
                    I want things to stop spinning.  
                          (considers it)
                    You re right, I don t want to know.

                                  KALINDA
                    Stay away from court tomorrow.

      Alicia s cell phone rings.  She answers.

                                  ALICIA
                    Alicia Florrick. Yes, thanks for getting 
                    back to me. So, about Lisa Pruitt... I 
                    see. Right. Well thank you...
                          (hangs up)

                                  KALINDA 
                    What?

                                  ALICIA
                    That was this lawyer.  
                          (the card)
                    Found it near the victim s 
                    belongings in Rucker s studio.

                                  KALINDA
                    Lots of lawyers running around this one. 

                                  ALICIA
                    I don t even know who we re defending 
                    anymore.  It s gotten very confusing.

                    Yeah.

                                  ALICIA
                    The lawyer on the phone wouldn t tell 
                    me if Lisa Pruitt had been to see her.

                                  KALINDA
                    Of course not.  That dbe too easy.

                                  ALICIA
                    But she said what kind of work they 
                    do.  Matching pregnant women with 
                    families who want to adopt.

      Kalinda looks toward Alicia sharply.

      Alicia barrels into the interrogation room in the middle of 
      Detective Johnson s questioning, a sober Cary sitting with Jason.

                                  ALICIA
                    Detective, I need you to stop 
                      interrogating my client and step 
                    out for a second.

                                  DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    I was just asking a question, ma am.

                                  ALICIA
                    You can finish in a minute.  Please.

      Johnson sighs.  Gets up.  Starts out.  

                                  JASON RUCKER
                    What s wrong?

    But Alicia crosses to the video camera, shuts it off.

                                  ALICIA
                    You got her pregnant. Lisa was at your 
                    little studio, and you got her pregnant.

                                  JASON RUCKER
                    No.  What?  No.

                                  ALICIA
                    She was going to a law firm for 
                    adoption.

                    Tell me now because they re going to 
                    find it out during an autopsy.  You 
                    got her pregnant.

                                  JASON RUCKER
                    No, I couldn t have.

                                  ALICIA
                    She was at your studio!

                                  JASON RUCKER
                    Yes, I know, but I didn t get her 
                    pregnant. 

                                  ALICIA 
                    Tell me the truth.

                                  JASON RUCKER
                    I couldn t have got her pregnant.  
                    I had a vasectomy.  

      Alicia pauses, stares at him.  Stunned.  


      Knock-knock-knock.  Kalinda knocks at a dorm door.  Kerouac 
    on the door.  Max opens it, thrilled to see Kalinda...

                                  MAX
                    Hey.  I was wondering when you were 
                    coming back for that statement.

                                  KALINDA
                    Yeah, sorry I m so late.  But a 
                    couple more questions have come up 
                    about Lisa Pruitt.  Did she ever 
                    mention being pregnant?

    Max looks around, lowers his voice...

                                  MAX
                    Who said that?

                                  KALINDA
                    A lawyer.  She was contacting a law firm 
                    about putting a baby up for adoption.   

                                  MAX
                    Yeah, she told me.  

                                  KALINDA
                    Do you know who the father is?

                                  MAX
                    Yeah.  Who she babysits for.  
                    Rucker.  

                                  KALINDA
                          (eyes him)
                    Really?

                                  MAX
                    Yeah.  That s why I think he did 
                    it: killed her.  He wanted her to 
                    get an abortion, she said no.

      Kalinda nods, looks past him, sees a laptop open on his desk.

                                  KALINDA
                    She told you that?

                                  MAX
                    Yeah, he didn t want to be pinned down.  

                                  KALINDA
                    Well, this is helpful.

                                  MAX
                    You want me to say the same thing 
                    to the cops?

                                  KALINDA
                    Yeah, would you mind?  Can you come 
                    with me now?

                                  MAX
                    Sure.  Give me a minute.

    Max slips into his dorm room. Kalinda watches him enter his 
      bathroom. Nudges the door open.  Goes to the desk. The laptop.  
      A large dent on one side. She stares at it. Turns it over.

      Three rubber nubs.  There-- there-- there--and--

      ...the fourth is missing.  Kalinda smiles.

                                  MAX (CONT D)
                    What s wrong?

      Kalinda sees Max behind her.

                                  KALINDA
                    Nothing.

                                        ACT FOUR


      Kalinda makes herself comfortable on the stand.  It s 
      momentarily disorienting seeing her on the stand.

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                    Miss Sharma, the defendant fired 
                    you from the State s Attorney 
                    office, didn t he?

      Kalinda makes eye contact with Peter at the defense table.

                                  KALINDA
                    Yes, he did.

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                    In your own words, could you 
                    explain why he did that?

                                  KALINDA
                    He said I was working two jobs.

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                    And were you?

                    Yes.

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                    You were working for him; and you

                    You.

      Peter stares at Kalinda as Golden looks up from his notes.

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                    What work were you doing for me,

                                  KALINDA
                    I was running down Bimbo eruptions.

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                    Would you explain that 
                      colloquialism?

                    Your honor, again, we would object 
                    to this line of questioning.

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                    This is our last witness, your

                                  JUDGE WINTER
                    Granted.  Overruled, Mr. Golden.

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                    What were  bimbo eruptions ?

                                  KALINDA
                    You were worried that lawyers and 
                    judges were being coopted by 
                    powerful forces who used 
                      prostitutes to blackmail.


      Alicia stands outside the courtroom door, leaning against the 
      wall, listening...

                                  GLENN CHILDS (O.S.)
                    And when you started this task 
                    force, there was no sense that 
                    Peter Florrick was involved with 
                    these  bimbo eruptions ?


                                  KALINDA
                    That is correct.  You were more 
                    concerned about judges and ASAs.

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                    But then you discovered Mr. 
                    Florrick s involvement with Amber 
                    Madison.  Could you explain how she 
                    was used to coopt Mr. Florrick? 

                                  KALINDA
                    Yes.  A procurer assigned specific 
                      prostitutes to flatter and pursue 
                    certain clients.  The clients were 
                    referred to by number.  For 
                    example, one of the clients was 
                    Client #14... 

      Judge Winter looks up almost imperceptibly.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #113     "Hi"     GREEN COLLATED     1/7/10       54A.

                    These prostitutes?

                    They would discover the marital 
                    status and sexual predilections of 
                    these clients.  To use the example 
                    of Client #14: he was found to be a 
                    judge, a married judge, with three 
                    daughters.   

      Glenn pauses, studies Kalinda.  What are you doing?

                                  KALINDA (CONT D)
                    He was deemed to be interested in 
                      African-American prostitutes, and 
                    the imagery of southern plantation 
                    life.  

      Judge Winter squirms, getting more and more uncomfortable 
      (obviously Client #14), as Peter looks up, seeing where 
      Kalinda is going.

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                    Okay.  And-- um--  So once Mr. 
                    Florrick was involved with Amber 
                    Madison, then no money traded 
                    hands, isn t that correct?  

                                  KALINDA
                    Yes.  And if the client tried to 
                    pay, the procurer would return the 
                    client s money.  For example, when 
                    Client #14 tried to pay for an 
                    evening with two African-American 
                    women, that money was refunded.

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                          (eyeing Winter)
                    Miss Sharma-- You don t need to 
                    refer to a particular client.  Just 
                    answer the question.  

                                  KALINDA
                    I ve been asked to answer in my own 
                    words.  These are my own words.  

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                    Yes, but your words could be more 
                     on point.   Now did Mr. Florrick 
                    have sexual relations at home with 
                    Miss Madison?





                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #113     "Hi"     GREEN COLLATED     1/7/10       56.

                                  KALINDA
                    To answer that question, I have to 
                    talk about my job, and how it was 
                    important to know the names of all 
                    the clients.  Including Client #14.  

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                    Kalinda!

                                  KALINDA
                    I m here under subpoena, Mr. 
                    Childs.  If asked to name the 
                    client names, I must.

      Judge Winter stares at Kalinda as Childs hesitates.  No idea 
    how to go forward.  Golden smiles, stands...

                                  DANIEL GOLDEN
                    Your honor, I must again object to 
                    this sexual line of questioning.  
                    It is irrelevant-- just as these 
                    client s names are irrelevant.  We 
                    would respectfully submit that this 
                    is beneath the dignity of this 
                    court.

                                  JUDGE WINTER
                    I would tend to agree, Mr. Golden. 

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                    Your honor, surely there is a way 
                    to elicit this testimony-- possibly 
                    in chambers--

                                  DANIEL GOLDEN
                    --not without these clients  names 
                    becoming part of the public record.  
                    Isn t that correct, Miss Sharma?

                                  KALINDA
                    Yes, I m afraid so.

      Judge Winter takes a moment.  Adjusts his robe.

                                  JUDGE WINTER
                    I ve given too much leeway with 
                    this sexual testimony, Mr. State s 
                    Attorney.  Now I must call it to a 
                    halt--

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                    Your honor--


                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #113     "Hi"     GREEN COLLATED     1/7/10       57.

      CONTINUED: (4)5050


                                  JUDGE WINTER
                    No, sir.  It is four p.m. and I find 
                    myself unpersuaded by your arguments 
                    of Mr. Florrick s guilt.  I believe 
                    this was nothing more than a sexual 
                    witchhunt.  But that is not for me 
                    to decide.  My job is merely to 
                    determine if there is enough for a 
                    new trial, and, yes, Mr. Florrick, I 
                    believe there is.

      Peter closes his eyes, moved.  Golden s hand goes over his, 
      squeezes.  Both speechless.  

                                  JUDGE WINTER (CONT D)
                    I m sorry, Mr. Florrick.  I m sorry 
                    this has happened to you.  And I m 
                    sorry I don t have the power to do 
                    more than order a new trial.  But 
                    that is exactly what I m going to 
                    do.  You, Mr. Florrick, have been 
                    granted a retrial.  

      Peter finds his eyes wet.  He looks toward the back of the 
      court.  No Alicia.  We find her in...


      ...the antechamber, standing there, stunned.  Stunned with 
      pleasure?  Or ambivalence?  


      Will and Diane.  They stand side-by-side, watching Sonya and 
      Jason hug in Diane s office.

                                  WILL
                    Max-- the kid from the dorm was 
                    right about the motive.  It was 
                    just his motive, not Jason s.  

                                  DIANE
                    She wouldn t get an abortion?

                                  WILL
                    They argued, and he killed her.

                                  DIANE
                    How did Lisa s bra get in Jason s 
                    studio?




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #113     "Hi"     GREEN COLLATED     1/7/10       58.

                                  WILL
                    Jason gave her the keys.  She and 
                    Max would go there when he wasn t 
                    around.

      They look back in at Sonya and Jason.  A tense hug, smile.

                                  DIANE
                    They don t look so happy, do they?

                                  WILL
                          (shakes his head)
                    I don t understand marriage.

                                  DIANE
                    It s a mysterious institution.

                                  WILL
                    You ve never wanted it?

      Diane smiles at him...

                                  DIANE
                    Is that a proposal?

                                  WILL
                    Yes.  I ve been watching you from afar.

    The two smile, start off.  As...


      ...Alicia s apartment is quiet.  The kitchen.  It s empty.  
      Just the hum of the refrigerator.  The master bedroom.  A 
      drip-drip-drip from the off-screen bathroom sink.  The maid s 
      quarters.  The sound of a furnace coming on.  And...

      ...in the living room, Alicia, Zach, Grace, and Jackie sit.  
      Tensely.  In nice clothes.  Trying to look casual.

                                  GRACE
                    This is weird.

                                  ALICIA
                    Maybe you should watch TV.

                                  ZACH
                    There s nothing on.

                                  JACKIE
                    We could play twenty questions.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #113     "Hi"     GREEN COLLATED     1/7/10       59.

      Zach and Grace roll their eyes.

                                  ZACH
                    Does he have a key?

                                  ALICIA
                    He ll knock.

                                  GRACE
                    And it ll be electronic monitoring?  
                    He ll have to stay in the apartment?

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes.  We ll all have to adapt.

      Another second of silence.  Alicia exhales, gets up:

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Okay.  Let s all just get on with 
                    our-- 

      But-- bzzzzzt--the doorbell rings.

                                  GRACE
                    Here we go.

      Alicia smiles, looks at her kids.

                                  ALICIA
                    I love you both.

      Zach and Grace nod.  Stand awkwardly.  Preparing.

      Alicia starts toward the door.  Pauses in the foyer.  Looks 
    in a mirror.  Straightens her hair.  Not sure why she did 
      that.  She looks away.  Reaches for the knob.  Opens the 
      door, finding...

      ...Peter there.  A Sheriff behind him.

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    Hi.
