    GUS watches as a gaggle of DESK SERGEANTS and UNIFORM 
      OFFICERS are gathered around SHAWN as he  holds court.   He 
    is in mid-psychic demonstration, focused on a FEMALE OFFICER.

      SHAWN VISION - Her Academy graduation plaque, reads - 1983. 
      SHAWN VISION - The roots of her hair (slightly grey).     
      SHAWN VISION - CLOSE on her desk.  Splayed under some papers, 
    her  Count-A-Carb  cards.

                    I m gonnasay... forty-one years 
                    old and 127 pounds!

    The room goes SILENT for a moment as the group hedges the

                          (big smile)
                    That was amazing, how did you do 
                    that? 

    The room breaks out in APPLAUSE.  Shawn nods  thank you .

                    I have to admit though that sadly, 
                    I am actually 134 pounds. 

                                  SHAWN
                    My bad.  You know what it is, I m 
                    actually getting a  future reading  
                    from next week.  It happens 
                    sometimes, my apologies.

      ANGLE- down the hall - We see INTERIM CHIEF VICK hand off a 
      case folder to DETECTIVE LASSITER, who cracks it open, but 
      quickly hands it right back, shaking his head  no.   She 
      hands it to him again and the folder gets traded back and 
      forth this way till, hearing the sound of more APPLAUSE, they 
      turn their attention to SHAWN.  They both have the same idea. 

                                  LASSITER
                    Hey, Spencer!

    Gus attempts to get Shawn attention, thinking he s about to 
    get yelled at for taking everyone away from their work.

                                  LASSITER (CONT D)
                            (approaching Shawn)

                    No catch, it s just right up your 
                    alley.  Could use your  insight.

      Shawn and Gus enter to see a large NAKED guy, FRED TURK, 
      seated.  A pile of his clothes are stacked neatly on the 
      table in front of him.

      Shawn and Gus both GASP in shock at the sight, but Shawn 
      quickly recovers.

      ANGLE ON - Lassiter, pleased with himself, grinning and 
      waving at Shawn through the one-way glass of the 
      interrogation room. 

    Gus tries moving to leave, but Shawn catches him.

                                        ACT ONE


      Shawn is following after Chief Vick.

                                  SHAWN
                    Chief, I m telling you, yougotta 
                    hire me on this case.

                                  INTERIM CHIEF VICK
                    There is no case to hire you on.
                          (stops walking turning to 
                          Shawn)
                    Okay, maybe you didn t realize that 
                    this was Lassiter playing with you. 
                    Now, I think we both know that 
                    humor is not his strong suit, but 
                    this was his attempt at a joke. 

                                  SHAWN
                          (psych mode)
                    But I sense that the victim was 
                    dragged somewhere.  There was a 
                    crime committed here!

                                  INTERIM CHIEF VICK
                    First of all, we don t call him the 
                    victim, we call him the perpetrator 
                    and there wasa crime committed, 
                    it s called indecent exposure and 
                    we arrested him for it.  Now, if 
                    you really want to follow the case, 
                    I believe his hearing is in two 
                    weeks.


      Shawn and Gus are eating lunch in the office.  We can see 
      Gus s food, but don t reveal what Shawn is eating.  Sitting 
    on the table is a copy of the SANTA BARBARA GAZETTE.  On the 
      front page is a picture of Fred Turk, draped in a towel.

                                  GUS
                    For whatever it s worth, I believe 
                    you on this one.  There is a case 
                    here.

                                  SHAWN
                    Seriously?  You agree with me?  I 
                    usually have to drag you into 
                    cases.  I feel like we should toast 
                    to this.  Pineapple juice boxes?

      Shawnstarts humming the CLOSE ENCOUNTERS theme, while 
      hitting his fork against different surfaces, his plate, his 
      glass, etc.  He hits the glass a couple times, then takes a 
      couple sips, then hits it again, trying to match the right 
      tone.

                    Okay, well, this is what I have so 
                    far.  This guy was dragged out  
                    there, but otherwise, no apparent

                    other than the embarrassment of 
                    waking up naked in a field, there s

      Shawn and Gus are walking into the salon.  They approach the

                    So what does this case have to do

                    loser thinks getting a tan will 
                    help them get a woman?

      Just then, a GUY exits one of the booths in flip flops and a

                    The real question is, what are you
                    doing here?

                                  SHAWN
                    Well, George Hamilton, we re on a 
                    case.  Maybe you didn t see the 
                    pictures in the paper of the guys 
                    in the field?

                                  HENRY
                    Of course I did.   The Nudist.  The 
                    guy who thought he was abducted?  
                    What does that have to do with this 
                    place?

                                  SHAWN
                    Maybe you can tell me, both those 
                    guys are regulars in here and are 
                    single.  Could be a stalking case. 

                                  GUS
                    Hey, your dad is single too and he
                    comes here.

                    Look, your problem right now is you 
                    have a case and you are being short-
                    sighted.  It s all very impressive 
                    that you were able to look at a 
                    couple of nude guys and put a fix 
                    on them here, but that s not 
                    enough.

                                  SHAWN
                    Not impressive enough?  Guess how 
                    many hats were in the room?  That s 
                    right, NONE!  Look, I know these 
                    guys are connected.

                                  HENRY
                    I m sure there s a link, Shawn, but 
                    it isn t this place.  What do I 
                    always say-- you just need to look 
                    closer.

                                  SHAWN
                    To tell you the truth dad, I think 
                    I ve looked about as close as I can 
                    take.

    He grabs Gus s hand and stamps his wrist before he can say 
    no.

                    Yeah, I tried the speed-dating 
                    thing a couple of times.  I just 
                    didn t think it had anything to do 
                    with the case and I was kind of 
                      embarrassed about it.

                    We believe it has everythingto do 
                    with the case.  Both Philip Keiser 
                    and the man that turned up dead 
                    also attended the speed-dating 
                    events.  

      Just then, dozens of  cuckoo clocks  scattered about the 
      room, begin to chime and  cuckoo  causing a loud cacophony.

                    Do you remember anything odd 
                    happening there?  Or seeing anyone 
                    strange?

                          (loudly)
                    The only odd thing was that for 
                    some reason the women didn t take 
                    to me the way they usually do.

    One last  cuckoo  and the clocks finally finish their 
      routine... wait, one more.  Then...

                    I can t imagine why.

                    Here s the thing though, other 
                    strange stuff has been happening to 
                    me since I was at the event.

                                  GUS
                    Like what?

                                  TURK
                    Well, I applied for a job recently.  
                    I was a perfect candidate for it 
                    and had several interviews and then 
                    suddenly after my final one... I

      Shawn, Gus, Lassiter and Juliet stand by the bar, waiting for 
    the event to begin.  A long table is set up with chairs on 
      either side.  We see Marvin (the host) placing bowls of the 
      green popcorn on the bar.

                                  LASSITER
                    Okay, Spencer, I checked out that 
                    pattern of yours.  It s a high 
                      performance tire, manufactured 
                    after 2002, so we re looking for a 
                    woman who drives a late model 
                    sports car, probably American made.

                    to get to know someone so, myself

                    How s it feel?  You got goose 
                    bumps?

                                  JULIET
                    This isn t a date, Shawn.  It s 
                    work.

                                  SHAWN
                    Okay, well still, you have six minutes 
                    to ask me anything you want.  Go for 
                    it.  What are you dying to know about 
                    Shawn Spencer?  The man.

                                  JULIET
                    Oddly enough, I don t think I have 
                    anything I m dying to know.

                                  SHAWN
                    Okay, then I ll go.  Me, you, Gus, 
                    Lassiter and McNabare stranded on 
                    a deserted island?  Who are you 
                    gonnasleep with?

                                  JULIET
                    None of the above.

                                  SHAWN
                    But you have to, in order to 
                    procreate the species.  Keep in 
                    mind though, if you choose 
                    Lassiter, your kid s first words 
                    will be,  Freeze, maggot!  

      Juliet can t help it.  She finds him amusing.

      They just sit in silence in front of each other.  Not a word 
      spoken.  They both fiddle awkwardly, looking at their watches 
    or tapping the table. 

      LORRAINE sees this and leans over to Lassiter.

                    What happened to the sisterhood?  
                    Lassiter came up empty too.  What

                                        ACT FOUR


      Shawn and Gus stand at the ball rack.  Gus is thumbing 
      through the balls nervously.  As they talk we can see Darcy 
    in the BACKGROUND, lacing up her bowling shoes.

                                  GUS
                    Look, I don t know what to say to 
                    her.  I ran out of topics in the 
                    car on the way over.  Plus, she 
                    keeps wanting to rub my head.  Why 
                    is that?

                                  SHAWN
                    Look, I find myself wanting to rub 
                    it sometimes, too.  It s just that 
                    kind of head.  Look, you re doing 
                    great! 
                          (handingGus a note)
                    Here is a list of topics, 
                    conversation starters... now just 
                    pick out a ball and go back there.  
                    I ll be right over.

      Gus, grabs a ball and begins to walk away, but turns.

                                  GUS
                          (reading from note)
                     You re on a deserted island and 
                    have to procreate the species...  
                    Really?

      Shawn picks up a ball, striking a pose for fun.  He looks 
      down the row of lanes.  He does a double take, thinking he 
      sees Juliet.  He does!  Is she on a date?

      Shawn moves  serpentine  like, weaving in and around people 
    and counters, working his way over to get a closer look.

      It s her and she s laughing and giggling as some GUY, 
      handsome, preppy, is cradling her, demonstrating the proper 
      ball handling technique. 

      SHAWN S FACE SINKS.  Juliet has a real date?  She dates?  Why 
      does this bother Shawn so much?

    He fiddles with a ball at the ball rack.  When he hears 
      Juliet GIGGLE and hug her date, he is thrown.  The ball slips 
      from his fingers and drops, making a loud NOISE.

      Juliet turns to see Shawn.

                                  JULIET
                    Shawn?

      Shawn looks around but he has no choice.  He has to own this.

                    I m bowling.

      Shawn moves to the open lane next to them lays his ball on 
    the return.  He fans his fingers over the cold air blower.

                                  JULIET
                    Really, I had no idea you were

    She thought she was happy with her date, but seeing Shawn, 
      throws her a bit.  Has she been thinking about the 100% 
      match?

                     looker  you mean, a  dollface  a 
                     peach  a  spicy tomato , then yes, 
                    She s a  looker. 

                                  HENRY
                    Good for Gus. 

                                  SHAWN
                    Oh, one more thing, she may or may 
                    not be a murderer.

    On Henry s  what?  look, the front door knob TURNS.

      ANGLE ON - Gus and Darcy ENTER.  We hear the SMATTERINGS of 
      their conversation as they make it inside and over to the 
      couch.  They sit.

                                  DARCY
                          (looking around)
                    Wow, you really like fishing?

                                  GUS
                    Oh, God, no.

      Then Gus looks around to see every square inch of the place 
    has a fishing item. Even the throw pillow next to him has a 
      fish on it.

                                  GUS (CONT D)
                    Yes, actually.  Love it. 
                      Luuuuv..it.  Love me the fishing.

      Shawn looks into Henry s bathroom.  SHAWN VISION - dried 
      soapy residue on the edge of the tub.

                                  HENRY
                    I was.

      SHAWN VISION - corner of the tub.  A tiny bubble POPS.

                    With bubbles?

                                  HENRY
                    Yes, Shawn, with bubbles.

                                  SHAWN
                    Who ARE you? 

                                  HENRY
                    Shawn, I have always taken baths. 
                    That s where I THINK.  I ve solved 
                    dozens of cases in the tub.  Real 
                    men take baths.

                    Okay, anyone since the Old West?

      Just then, from the other room we hear a DING.

                                  SHAWN (CONT D)
                    What was that?

                    unreal, you can t go out there!  
                    Gus is in the middle of goading our 
                    possible murderer.  You are gonna
                    compromise the investigation.

                                  HENRY
                    What s gonnabe compromised is my 
                    roast.  It s drying out as we

                    Dad!

    Too late.

      ANGLE ON - Gus and Darcy on the couch.  Henry ENTERS.  Darcy 
      jumps a little.

                                  HENRY
                    Please kids, pay no mind.  Just 
                    passing through to the kitchen, 
                    squeeze some juices on my roast.

                                  DARCY

                    Making a roast?

                    Your roommate?  I didn t know you

      Henry crosses through and back to the bedroom.

                                  DARCY
                    Look, it s fine that you have a 
                    roommate, but honestly, it s 
                    cramping our style.  What do you 
                    say we go somewhere more private?

                    play this thing out.  We got you

                    Look, I had nothing to do with any 
                    crime.  I was just using the names 
                    and numbers to get dates, man.  I 
                    can t afford the hundred dollar 
                    entrance fee on my crapsalary.  
                    Besides,they came to that thing

                    and I will be able to psychically 
                    pick them out.  I promise.

      Vick thinks for a moment.  Then hit s the intercom button 
      that feeds into the interrogation room.

      ANGLE ON - Lassiter and Marvin

                                  VICK (O.S.)
                    Detective, let him go.

                          (to one-way glass)
                    What??  But..

                                  VICK (O.S.)
                    Release him. 

      Lassiter pouts like an eight year old who dropped his ice 
      cream cone.


      When Shawn, Vick, and Lassiter walk in, the speed dating 
      event is already in progress. 

      Lorraine approaches them.

                                  LORRAINE
                    Excuse me, can I help you people?

                    We re here for the speed-dating 
                    event.

                    I m sorry, it s already begun.
                            (recognizinghim)
                    Wait, I remember you.  Look, you 
                    seem like a decent man and I 
                    wouldn t want you to waste another 
                    hundred dollars.  I watched you the 
                    other night.  You re not very good 
                    at this.  Maybe try something less 
                     inter-active ?  Maybe place an ad 
                    in the penny saver?

                                  LASSITER
                          (pulling out badge)
                    This is police business. 

      Lorraine steps aside.  Shawn begins to move to the dating 
      table.

                                  SHAWN
                    Okay, let me go do my thing.

      Just then, Gus walks in, a little disheveled but wearing a 
      pale yellow shirt with a small flower on the breast pocket.  
    He approaches Shawn.

                                  SHAWN (CONT D)
                    Oh good, so you got the message?  
                    Turns out it wasn t Darcy after 
                    all.

                                  GUS
                    You re gonnapay Shawn.  You re 
                    gonnapay.  Believe it.

                                  SHAWN
                    No offense, Buddy, but it s kinda
                    hard to feel threatened by you in 
                    that shirt.  Is that a daffodil? 

                                  GUS
                    It s not my shirt Shawn, it s your 
                    dad s shirt.  He lent it to me 
                    because mine was covered in snot
                    tears.

      Shawn reacts  My dad s shirt?  But this will have to wait.  
      Shawn scans the dating table.  He approaches a GUY, an Andy 
      Berman type, from behind who s on a date with a PRETTY GIRL. 





                                                                            (CONTINUED)  PSYCH - Episode 1014 "He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not..." - Studio/Network Draft 9/14/06     47.

                          (tapping guy on shoulder)
                    Hey, may I cut in?

    The guy is so surprised by Shawn s request that he just gets 
    up, letting Shawn sit down. 

                                  SHAWN (CONT D)
                    I m sorry, I didn t mean to just 
                    jump in there.  That is a little 
                    rude.

                                  PRETTY GIRL
                    Actually, I should thank you.  He 
                    was awful.
                          (then)
                    But youare cute. 

    The Pretty Girl continues to talk as the date carries on.  
      However, Shawn begins to focus on the couple next to him.  It 
    is Glenda, the woman Shawn had his very first date with.

                                  GLENDA 
                    Oh, so navy blue is your favorite 
                    color?  Mine is Green.  You know, 
                    you seem European.  You sure you 
                    don t have family history there?  
                    What is your mother s maiden name?  

      Shawn hears this and reacts.  SHAWN VISION FLASHBACK  - 
      Glenda from the first date,  Wow, maybe you can change it.  
      What s your mother s maiden name?  Did you have any pets 
      growing up?  What were their names?  What s your favorite 
      color? 

                                  PRETTY GIRL
                    So, after volunteering for the 
                    animal shelter, I decided to start 
                    my own Beagle rescue but... 

                                  SHAWN
                    I m sorry, will you give me a 
                    moment?

      Shawn, rises, lifts his water glass and CLINGS it, getting 
      everyone s attention.  The dates stop and everyone focuses on 
      Shawn.

    We see Juliet enter the room, ALONE.  She stands at the bar 
      with the others.

                    to fall in love.  They aren t even

                    You, Glenda, and you, Marvin, are a 
                    couple.  An odd couple, perhaps.  A 
                    couple I wouldn t want to picture 
                    in the sack, but a couple.  In 
                    fact, you re married!

      Everyone looks at Glenda seated, and Marvin at the bar.

                                  GLENDA

      Both Glenda and Marvin cover their hands, guiltily.  The 
      DATERS are horrified.

                    it s the perfect place to pull off

                    You, Marvin, didsteal those

                    Glenda, feigning interest in these 
                    people, cleverly got the answers to 
                    questions such as  What is your 
                    mother s maiden name, favorite 
                    color and pet s name.  Questions

                    share with you!  But allquestions

                    authorize their credit cards.  A 
                    perfect plan.  All that was left to 
                    do was get the credit card numbers 
                    from these men but not have them 
                    suspect they were robbed.  So, you 
                    conceived a plan of following

                    can t bowl.  And that is a deal 
                    breaker.

                                  SHAWN
                    I see.

                                  JULIET
                    But Shawn, I only sat down because 
                    I wanted clear one thing up.  I 
                    don t take any stock in those 
                    profile matching  thingies  we did 
                    the other night.

                                  SHAWN
                    Me neither.
                          (then)
                    Especially since I just copied 
                    yours verbatim.  You don t actually 
                    think I like to knit, do you?  

                                  JULIET
                    Good, cause I didn t want their to 
                    be any weirdness between us.  I 
                    mean seeing how fast you solved 
                    this case, looks like we ll be 
                    working together a lot.  Nice job 
                    by the way.

                                  SHAWN
                    Thanks.

                                  JULIET
                          (getting up)
                    Well, I ll see ya at work then. 

                                  SHAWN
                    Yes, at work it is. 
                          (then)

                    Hey, have you tried the Blarney 
                    Stone fajitas here?

                                  JULIET
                    Are they good?

                                  SHAWN
                    Their awful.  But come on, you 
                    gotta try  em.  It s like a rite of 
                    passage.

    As Shawn, signals for a WAITRESS, Juliet sits back down.

                                        EPILOGUE

      CLOSE SHOT - of Shawn and Henry.  We see them basically from 
      their necks up.  They are facing out, side by side, talking 
    to each other.

                                  SHAWN (CONT D)
                    I have accused you of being a lot 
                    of things in the past but  metro-
                    sexual  was never one of them.

                                  HENRY
                    I m not metro-sexual Shawn.  I m 
                    just an average Joe who cares about 
                    his health and his appearance.  

                                  SHAWN
                    But how did you hide it from me all 
                    these years?

                                  HENRY
                    I never hid anything in my life.  
                    You just don t pay attention.  And 
                    it s a shame, because you could 
                    really learn a thing or two.

                                  SHAWN
                    What are you trying to say?  
                    There s something wrong with my 
                      appearance?

                                  HENRY
                    Oh, don t be so insecure.  Man up  
                    a little here.  It s embarrassing.  
                    Now hold your breath.

                                  SHAWN
                    What?

                                  HENRY
                    Hold your breath Shawn!

      Henry takes a DEEP BREATH and holds it.  Shawn follows doing 
    the same.


    We see them side by side in their swim trunks.  Seconds later 
      they get sprayed with the orange mist of the INSTA-TAN
      tanning solution. 

    As the guys turn orange...
