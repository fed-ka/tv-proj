  CLOSE ON fifteen year old NIKKI PRETTY.  She has pigtails and 
  braces and smiles at the camera.

                              LEO (V.O.)
                I mean, that WAS her.  At fifteen. It s 
                cool, I was fifteen too.

  We see Leo at fifteen; a smiling Goth kid with braces.

                              LEO (V.O.) (CONT D)
                We were young and stupid, but that didn t 
                make it any less real...

  Nikki leans in, SLOW-MOTION, and kisses him on the cheek.  
  Leo is over the moon.

                              LEO (CONT D)
                We fell madly, hopelessly in love.  My folks 
                were on another of their mommy-and-daddy-
                          need-alone-time-in-Reno-you-understand-don t-
                  you-sweetie trips, so Nikki and I spent that 
                whole summer together.

  He plays guitar while she dances around.

  Sharing ice-cream, they look very happy.

                              LEO (CONT D)
                Those days in the park were some of the 
                happiest of my life.  We laughed, we cried, 
                we talked about our dreams; Her s to be an 
                actress on Broadway and mine to make music.  
                It was just her and I... that is until she 
                said,  daddy wanted to meet me. 


  CLOSE ON DOOR

  Nikki nervously walks up with Leo and she knocks on the door.

  QUICK PULL OUT: SUPER-WIDE SHOT

  We see that they are entering a HUGE MANSION.

                              LEO (V.O.)
                You see Nikki was Nikki Pretty, middle 
                daughter of Roman Pretty, one of the 
                richest men in America.

  QUICK ZOOM BACK

  The door is opened by ROMAN PRETTY, a supremely confident 
    billionaire.  He looks at Leo up and down.

                              LEO (V.O.) (CONT D)
                Since their mother passed away, Roman was 
                very protective of his three daughters. 
                But he seemed to take to me right away.

  Roman smiles and gives Leo a great big hug.  He pulls him 
  inside leaving Nikki alone on the porch.


  We see KELLY PRETTY, a gorgeous Paris Hilton-type.  She wears 
  oversized sunglasses and carries a tiny dog.

                              LEO (V.O.)
                Kelly was the youngest Pretty daughter.  
                They say it s wrong to label your 
                  children, but I have no idea what it does 
                when they re labelled wrongly.  Roman 
                called Kelly his  little genius. 

  Kelly makes kissy-faces at her dog.

                              KELLY
                Does Brandon have to go poo-poo?  Will 
                Brandon make poo-poo for mommy?

  Kelly puts the tiny, shakey dog down and it starts to do it s 
  business.  Suddenly flashes light it up.

  WIDE - We see that Kelly is surrounded by a horde of 
    paparazzi.  Kelly  tsks  and puts a tiny privacy-screen 
  around her dog. The paparazzi follow her every move.

                              LEO (V.O.)
                And then there s Nikki. My sweet Nikki.  
                Smart, beautiful, down-to-earth, she dreamed 
                of being on the stage and that s why she 
                came to my office three months ago...   Roman s Empire Writer s Second 03/14/085.




  We hear laughing.

                              SEB (O.S.)
                ...then I said,  I didn t know nipples had 
                  feelings.  And that s when your daughter 
                punched me right in the Adam's apple.


  We follow an extension cord from the main house into a window 
  where we see Jace, hiding in his bedroom, playing an X-Box.

                              LEO (V.O.)
                I think living so close, yet so far, from 
                all that wealth drove Jace a little 
                crazy. Plus, there was the issue of 
                Jenny s  wonderful news. 

  Jenny bursts into the room, excited.  She shoves a pregnancy 
  stick into Jace s face.  He sees the dreaded plus sign.

                              LEO (V.O.) (CONT D)
                And of course they re going to get married.

  Jace drops the X-BOX controller and immediately flees.

                              LEO (V.O.) (CONT D)
                At least that s what Jace decided after a 
                little soul-searching in Argentina.


  Argentinian solders pull a bearded Jace out of a dusty rat-
  hole (a la Saddam Hussein.)


                                                                          (CONTINUED)   Roman s Empire Writer s Second 03/14/0813.

                Great!  You had hordes of Nazis here 
                forever and yet you can t hide one 
                  freaked-out hippie?!  Unbelievable!

  Roman walks up, smiling, and puts an arm around him.

                              ROMAN
                Let s go home, son.


  We PAN ACROSS a moving van to reveal Leo unloading boxes.

                              LEO (V.O.)
                Without Nikki, there was no use staying 
                with the Prettys.  Luckily, my parents, 
                just before leaving on a three months 
                 couples cruise , said that my old room 
                was available, although they were now 
                using it for storage.


  Leo goes for another box as A BLACK LIMO pulls up to the curb.  
  The back window rolls down and UNCLE JESUS  snakey head peers 
  out, think Christopher Guest in  The Princess Bride .

                              LEO
                      (as if swearing)
                Uncle Jesus.

                              LEO (V.O.) (CONT D)
                The most nefarious Pretty.  He and Roman 
                used to be business partners; both 
                  shepherding the original hardscrabble 
                family fortune...

  Slave-White Tooth Polish.  Made with REAL slave teeth! 


  Jesus leans out and beckons to Leo.

                              JESUS
                Yoo-hoo, Leo!

                              LEO
                What is it, Jesus?

                              JESUS
                Hello, Leo.  So good to see you, too.  I 
                heard about you and Nikki.  
                      (hollow concern)
                How you holding up, buddy?

                              LEO
                Nice. Feels like the same concern I d get 
                trapped in a pit in your basement. 

  Jesus hands him a business card.

                              JESUS
                Very funny.  Listen, I ve got a little 
                business to discuss with you, my dear.  
                But let s not do it out here with all the 
                tramps and trash.

  Leo looks around and sees the street is clean and empty.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)   Roman s Empire Writer s Second 03/14/0822.

                Meet me at that address tomorrow at two.  
                Oh, and Leo...

  PUSH IN ON JESUS, OMINOUS.

                              JESUS (CONT D)
                You mustn t tell anyone about this.

                              LEO
                No.

                              JESUS
                What?

                              LEO
                I m not going to meet you.

                              JESUS
                Ha!  Why Leo, I think you don t trust me.

                              LEO
                How observant of you.

                              JESUS
                My dear, trust is a two way street.  Let me 
                show you something I learned a very long 
                time ago.  Put out your hand.  Go on.

  Leo sticks out his palm.  Jesus pulls out three, hundred 
  dollar bills and lays them on Leo s fingers.

                              JESUS (CONT D)
                Now, put your wallet right beside the bills.

  Confused, Leo takes his wallet and puts it by the bills.  
  Jesus quickly grabs the wallet and money.

                              JESUS (CONT D)
                      (screams)
                Drive!

                              LEO
                Hey, my wallet!

  The limo peels out and down the street.

                              JESUS (O.S.)
                You can pick it up tomorrow at two!!   Roman s Empire Writer s Second 03/14/0823.




  Leo is walking, looking for an address.  He finds it.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)   Roman s Empire Writer s Second 03/14/0826.

                              LEO  (V.O.)
                Having worked with Roman made getting a 
                new job easier than I thought.  I had an 
                  interview at a Razor manufacturer at 
                three but I couldn t do anything until I 
                got my wallet back from Jesus.

  Leo rings the bell.  

                              JESUS (O.S.)
                      (through intercom)
                Come in.


  Leo, sweaty, is running down the street.

                              NIKKI (ON PHONE)
                Left.  Oh, Leo, I knew I could count on you.

                              LEO
                Nikki, I--

  She has hung up the phone.


  Paparazzi and people mill about.  Leo runs past and into the 
    restaurant as a limo drives up.

  ON LIMO - The window rolls down and we see Kelly looking out.

  ON PAPARAZZI - They are gathered around Kim Mardashian 
  pulling Britney Pears on a leash.  She smacks Britney s 
  bottom and the paparazzi go crazy.

  ON LIMO - Kelly, frustrated, motions the driver to drive on.   Roman s Empire Writer s Second 03/14/0832.




  Jesus and Mr. Solo are trying to make their escape as a LIMO 
  drives into frame knocking them to the ground.  Kelly opens 
  the door to the limo.  She steps one foot out and stays 
  there, smiling.  The paparazzi go crazy.
