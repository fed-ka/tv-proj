Kipper and the Boy hide In the coal bin of the abandoned building
as we HEAR the pursuers searching around above in the alley.

                            KIPPER
                        (whispering)
              Who re those guys chasing you?

                            BOY
              They re from Waverly.

                            KIPPER

                            BOY
              The foster home    Waverly Hall.
              You heard of it?

Kipper shakes his head...

                            BOY
              They whack you and pretend they re
              helping you. It s e slime pit.

              They catch me, I m dead meat...

                            KIPPER
              What do you mean?

                            BOY
              Kids even disappear...

                            KIPPER
              Disappear..?

                            BOY
                      (agitated)
              That s what they re trying to do
              to me.
                      (listening for sounds
                      of the men)
              Think they re gone?

                            KIPPER
                      (confused)
              I don t know...

The boy a arts to climb out of the coal bin. .

                                      (exiting)
              Far away from Waverly.

The boy scurries up the chute and disappears. Suddenly we HEAR
YELLS and SHOUTS O.S... The boy tries to dodge them but they grab
him end drag him off kicking and yelling...

KIPPER

He watches this, deeply distressed...

                                                          CUT TO:


Vincent is showing Father a diagram he has drawn for a new water
purification system in the tunnels...

                    Our conduits then cycle the
              water through the filters at this
              point...

                              FATHER
              And that would be sufficient..?

                              VINCENT
              Our water would be more pure than
              New York City tap water...

Kipper enters, still quite disturbed by his encounter with the boy
from Waverly...

                              FATHER
              Kipper, you re late for your
              lesson.

                            KIPPER
              I know... I m sorry...

              No    to beat you.

Vincent and Father chuckle. Kipper stands there with a troubled
expression.

                            FATHER
                      (noticing)
              Kipper takes the game quite
                seriously.

                            VINCENT

              A kid was being chased, and I
              helped him hide...

              Who was chasing him?

                              KIPPER
              Two men    from this place called
              Waverly.

                              VINCENT
                Waverly..?

                            KIPPER
              It s a foster home. He said bad things happened there,
              kids got whacked    kids even disappeared.

                      (looking at Vincent)
              I wanted to bring him down here.

              The men grabbed him. They dragged

              Do you think this boy was telling

Vincent looks at Kipper, proud of the boy s compassion..

Cathy comes home from a late night at work, her arms full of legal
briefs and investigation reports. FOLLOW as she enters her
bedroom, dumps the workload on her bed. .. She steps out on the
terrace from a breath of night air. On her small outdoor table she
finds e book    a very old copy of Shakespeare s Sonnets. Inside
the book is a message which reads:  Until then.. . 

Cathy checks her watch, quickly puts her coat back on and hurries
out...

It s pitch black inside the duct. The predators peer in.
Looking for their prey. She seems to have vanished.
Suddenly we HEAR a terrifying SNARL, SEE a FLASH of TEETH.
The predators run for their lives...

                I know there ve been some problems in various foster

                Waverly the exception. We truly try to do the best we
              can for the children.

                                        CATHY

He leads her into a dormitory room with a. dozen beds. It s clean
and functional. A few kids sit on their beds playing quietly. The
  children seem very well behaved.

                              MB. GUFFEY
                This is a typical dorm room.
                Everything clean and. ordered.
              We stress that.


                              CATHY
                I can see...

HOLD ON one of the children in the room    a nine-year old BOY.
He looks up at Cathy. He stares at her with big beseeching eyes.
He doesn t avert his gaze. It s haunting. . . Cathy notices the
boy looking at her    as Guffey leads her out.


MOVING with Cathy and Guffey...

                      We re limited to ages 6 through 12. So they re out
              of here before they become major monsters... We get the
                occasional tantrum or a runaway situation, but for the
                most part it s uneventful...

As children pass, all seems quite normal...



  A classroom of 4th graders watch a teacher write multiplication
tables on a blackboard. They sit quietly.

                  Structure. We give them

                  structure.

As Cathy and Mr. Guffey continue down the corridor, we SEE the
Boy from the dormitory who stared at Cathy.

                                MR. GUFFEY
                I think kids need a sense of structure, especially
                these kids,..

The Boy continues to pin her with his eyes. As be approaches and
ii about to speak with Cathy, an older girl, about twelve, pulls
him away. Cathy takes all this in...

                  compared to the squalor and depravity these kids come

Naj and the Custodian usher Elite down the steps to a large
basement area. The apace has been divided into makeshift rooms
using plywood and blankets. In a common area we FIND a group of
  tough looking kids ranging from 7 to 17, lounging on torn
furniture and watching T.V. Ellie looks around, disoriented,
terrified.

                                        NAJ

                This is Ellie. She s stayin  with
              us.

A few perfunctory glances from the group.

                                        NAJ
              Hey Deb    help her get settled.
                Take care of her...

" DEB, a waif like 15 year old girl comes forward. Despite her
diminutive appearance, she has a husky voice..

Ellie doesn t respond. She looks around trying to figure the
place out...

                                        MATRON
              We don t put up with that kind
              of stuff, here.

A beefy older man, her HUSBAND stands behind her...

                                        ERIC
              Let me out...

                                        MATRON
" (laughs)
                Let you out?!

The Matron steps back    her HUSBAND sets down a tray of food.
Eric stares at the pathetic meal. The door is locked again.


                                                            CUT TO:
-NIGHT

It s after dinner. Some of the kids are watching T.V. It s quiet.
There doesn t appear to be any adults around... Cathy enters the
  darkened T.V. room...

                                        CATHY
                                      (quietly)
              I m looking for Eric Pierson.

The kids turn, look at her.

                              BOY #1

                Never heard of him...

                          (to Boy #1)
                  What s the new kids s name?

                                CATHY
                  Where is the new kid?

                          (smirking)
                  In detention, down the ball...

                                BOY #1
                  Locked up...


  Cathy moves off    down the hallway..



    FOLLOW AS Cathy moves down the hail, checking doors. The door at
  the end of the ball is locked...

                                  CATHY
                          (tapping softly)
                  Eric..?

                                        ERIC
                          (O.S., through the door)
                  Yeah..?


  Now a thick hand grips Cathy s arm. It s the Matron... MATRON

                          (startled)
                  What s this?! What are you doing?

                                  CATHY
                  I want to see Eric.

                                  MATRON
                  Who are you??

                                  CATHY
                  Unlock the door.

  ANGLE - SOME OF THE KIDS

  They stand in the hall watching.

                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                39.

                                        MATRON

                I think you better leave.,. -

Cathy holds her ground. Eric starts pounding on the door.

                                        MATRON
                      (pushing Cathy)
              Get out. .  Now!
                      (calling out)
              Nick..!

Cathy suddenly breaks the Matron s hold, grabs her wrist, steps
behind her and subdues her in a hammer lock.

                                        CATHY
                I don t like to be pushed...

Cathy reaches into the Matron s pocket and takes her keys. The
kids in the hall watch, loving it...

                                        CATHY
              Which key..?

She applies more pressure to the Matron s arm. The Matron yelps in
pain...

                                        MATRON
              The square one...

Cathy unlocks the door. Eric appears, sees Cathy    he almost
  smiles...

                                        ERIC
                                  (in disbelief)
" It s you...

                                        CATHY
                Eric, get in the car, out In
                front. .

Eric runs out. Cathy still controlling the Matron in the hammer
lock, guides her down the hall toward the front door. ..
  Suddenly, the Husband appears at the end of the hell. He rushes
toward them. Cathy shoves the Matron into the Husband,
  momentarily tangling them up. She dashes out, past the kids, who
  silently cheer...                                                                                40.


    CAMERA MOVES along lengths of steam pipe of varying diameters as
  we HEAR a message being TAPPED IN CODE... At certain points
  along the way we SEE HANDS tapping on the pipes, relaying the
    message down. . . At the final terminal point, we FIND KIPPER
  with his ear to the pipe. He listens carefully, then runs off..



    Vincent is finishing a pencil drawing of Naj based on his
    observation In the alley. Kipper runs in.

                                        KIPPER
                  Vincent..! She s in the park
                  she s waiting there...

                                      VINCENT
                                      (teasing)
" Kipper, why the big smile? Who s
                  she come to see? Me or you?

  He rises quickly and exits...

                                                              CUT TO:

  Cathy stands alone In the dimly lit tunnel off the Park.
  She checks Eric who sleeps nearby, wrapped in a blanket...
  When she turns she FINDS Vincent standing at the end of the
    tunnel. .

                                        CATHY

                  Vincent...

  She goes to him. .

                              CATHY
                I ve got the boy. I found him...

                              VINCENT
                I knew you would.

                              CATHY
                They ve separated him from his sister. They ll be
                looking for him. If I take him back, I m afraid I ll
              lose him again. Vincent, I can t take that chance...

                              VINCENT
                He ll be safe with us.

                              CATHY
                        (relieved.)
                Good. I was hoping.

As Vincent moves toward the sleeping boy, Cathy clasps his arm.

                              CATHY
              No, wait. I m afraid that...

                              VINCENT
                        (looking at her)
                That he ll be afraid?

                              CATHY
                          (embarrassed)
                He s been through a lot. I don t
                know.
                              VINCENT

                It s alright. . . Wake him..

Vincent steps back as Cathy wakes Eric...

                              CATHY
                Eric..?

The boy opens his eyes...

                              ERIC
                                      (sleepy)
                What..? What are we gonna do?

                              CATHY
                We re going to a safe place, where
                no one can hurt you.

              You going, too?

                                        CATHY
                                        (nods)
                We re going with a friend of mine. Someone very
                extraordinary. I want you to meet him. His name is
                Vincent.

Vincent now appears from behind Cathy and kneels down beside Eric.

                                      VINCENT
                                      (softly)
                Eric.

Eric stares at Vincent, at first shocked. Then, as be looks, he
stares into Vincent s eyes and realizes they are smiling at
him... Eric s usually sullen eyes are then filled with startled
  fascination.

                                        ERIC
                        (studying Vincent s
                                        face)
                What is that? Is it real?

                                      VINCENT
                It s real...

Eric reaches out, touches Vincent s face...

Cathy watches the two of them, greatly moved...

                                        ERIC
                How d you get like that?

                                      VINCENT
                I don t know. I don t think I ever will. I never knew
              my mother or father.

                                        ERIC
              So you were born like that?

                                      VINCENT
                                      (smiles)
                      Well, it didn t happen because
                I was bad.

They both chuckle.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:                                                                                44.

Vincent, Cathy and Eric make their way through the tunnels, Into
the world below (possible matte shot)...

                                        ERIC
              Where are we going?

                                      VINCENT
                    Deep below the city    to a world of tunnels and
                chambers as old as the city.. . It s a forgotten place
                 but it s a place where people have always found
                safety...

                                        ERIC
              How will I find my way back?

                                      VINCENT
                Don t worry, you won t have to
              do it alone.

                                        ERIC
                What about my sister. .?

                Yea, you can stay for awhile.

                      Yes, of course, but there are
                some promises you have to make
              and keep.

                                        ERIC
                What kind of promises?

                              FATHER
                      To give help and support those In the community who

                It s a very important promise.
                It s how we exist...

                                        ERIC
                What about not telling anybody

                Eric, even if you did tell the secret    who would
                believe It? And even if they did, could they ever find
              the way down..?

                                        ERIC

  adjoining curtained off area...                                                                                55.


Naj is tying Ellie to a chair.


                                        ELLIE
                        (struggling, weeping)
              Don t... I won t do it again...

                                        NAJ
              You re stayin  right here. I
              can t trust you...

Naj storms off...

                                        NAJ
                                      (yelling)
              Deb..! Where are you..?

He disappears down the corridor of curtains and blankets..

                                        NAJ
                                        (O.S.)
                You re supposed to keep an eye
              on her..!

CATHY

She s behind the curtains in a nearby area. She waits until Naj is
safely away, then comes through the curtains, ENTERING the girls 
  quarters. She approaches Ellie.

                              CATHY
                        (whispering)
                Ellie.

Ellie looks confused., knowing she s seen Cathy s face before.

                              CATHY
                I m taking you out of here    to Eric.

                              ELLIE
              Who are you?

                              CATHY
                        (untying her)
              Shh    we have to hurry. I m the
              one Eric talked to at Waverly...

                              ELLIE
              You found him?

                              CATHY

                Yes... Let s go...

                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                88.

Cathy starts to lead her out  - when they DISCOVER Deb
standing there( -

                                        ELLIE
              Deb, don t say anything  -
              please.

                                        CATHY
              Come with us... You can all
                come..

A moment    Deb grapples with what to do. At first she looks about
to cry, then she turns tough again.

                                        DEB
                                      (yelling)
                Naj..! Naj..!

Deb runs out...

Before Cathy and Ellie can escape, Naj is there...

                                        NAJ
                What s this??
                      (to Ellis)
              You know this woman?

                                        CATHY
              I m taking Ellie out of here.
                Don t try to stop me.

                                        NAJ
                                      (laughs)
                      Wouldn t think of it.

Es grabs Cathy by the wrist. Cathy breaks the hold and drives the
flat of her hand Into Naj s face, shattering his nose... Naj is
sent to his knees, reeling in pain...

Deb hides a smile..

Cathy grabs Ellie by the hand and they run    through the walls
of curtains...

                                        NAJ
                        (screaming)
                Freddie! Freddie..

FREDDIE

One of Naj s big, young sergeant at arms comes running... As he
rounds a corner, Vincent s arm reaches out from an air vent and
snares him by the leg, upending him then sweeping him through the
vent with frightening force...

                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                  67.

NAJ



His nose bleeding, Naj charges after Cathy. As he barrels through

  the blankets, he pulls a small revolver.


  CATHY AND ELLIE

  They dart through the curtains, just ahead of Naj, trying to get
  to the air vent...

67 NAJ87

  He whips aside a curtain and FINDS

    VINCENT


  Fangs bared, poised to strike. He lets go a blood curling

  SNARL and brings both claws down on Naj, crushing him...

  DEB AND THE OTHER KIDS

  They react to the strange snarl from behind the blankets, not
yet realizing that it heralds their freedom..

    VINCENT S CLOAK

  As it disappears through the vent, and the grill work is
    replaced.

88 TNT. WAVERLY BALL - NIGHT 88

  The place is swarming with police. Children watch solemnly as
    Guffey, the Custodian and the Receptionist are led out in
    handcuffs. All the files are wheeled out, confiscated...
