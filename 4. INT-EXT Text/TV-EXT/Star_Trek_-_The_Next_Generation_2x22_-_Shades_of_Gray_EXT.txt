   Data turns the vine over -- and we can now see a meanlooking

   The area around Geordi and Data begins to move. Large

  111I FULL SHOT - AWAY TEAM 
 
   Picard's VOICE is heard. 
 
       PICARD'S COM VOICE 
      (tense, tight) 
     What just happened down there? 
     Number One! Report! 
 
 
   Tasha and Data APPROACH him. They monitor the energy 
   field with their tricorders. 
 
       PICARD'S COM VOICE 
     Report! Report! 
 
   Tasha and Data examine the energy field. 
 
       TASHA 
     He can't answer you, Captain. 
 
       DATA 
     Commander Riker has been encased 
     in some kind of energy field. 
 
       PICARD'S COM VOICE 
     Is he alive? 
 
   Data and Tasha continue to examine the energy field 
   containing the inert form of Commander William T. 
   Riker. 
 
       DATA 
     Unknown. 
 
  111K POV (STOCK, #107 SC. 42-43) 
 
   Backlit by LIGHTNING, THREE SMALL, HAIRLESS HUMANOIDS 
   with protruding cupped ears, dressed in strange 
   clothing. They are armed with odd whip-like weapons. 
 
       RIKER (V.O.) 
     Who are you? 
 
   At that, the leader snaps his whip toward them, 
   unleashing a rippling electro-plasmic WAVE that races 
   TOWARD CAMERA (OPTICAL).

  111L CLOSE - OUR TEAM 
 
   Riker, Data and lucky-day Geordi are whacked with the 
   WAVE all together... putting Geordi back to sleep. 
   Data falls unconscious, too. Riker fights it but is 
   hit again, and falls, unconscious.

   As it BLOWS UP. 
 
           QUICK CUT TO: 
 
 
   The Enterprise and the Tsiolkovsky are still tied by 
   the tractor beam, motionless. Riker's voice reveals 
   the strain he is under. 
 
       RIKER'S VOICE 
     Ship's log, First Officer Riker. 
     The star has begun disintegrating. 
     Enterprise will be destroyed 
     unless it can be moved out of the 
     path of the star material 
     hurtling... 
 
 
   It is large, irregularly shaped, moving very fast as it 
   was hurled off the star's surface with more power than 
   a hydrogen bomb. To gain a sense of size, it should 
   BLOCK OUT A WHOLE SECTION OF THE STARFIELD as it PASSES 
   CAMERA. 
 
       RIKER'S VOICE 
      (continuing) 
     ... toward us. Our only hope is 
     for Lieutenant Commander Data in 
     the time we have left, to regain 
     his senses and reconnect engine 
     power to the bridge. 
 
 
   hurtling through space -- too fast. 
 
   CLOSE ON DATA AND HIS HANDS 
 
   UNDERCRANK CAMERA. His hands are flying -- almost a 
   blur. More and and more of the isolinear optical chips 
   are set in the command computer board.

     If we had just a minute more, 
     sir...

   CLOSE ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL) 
 
   The mass of star material closer, hurtling toward them. 
 
   WIDER ANGLE 
 
   as Picard bursts in, presses his hypo against 
   MacDougal, then Riker, then another person, etc. 
 
       RIKER 
     We didn't make it, Captain. If 
     we had just a minute or so more... 
 
 
   with the star material looming large as it rushes down 
   upon them. 
 
 
   The Tsiolkovsky now begins drifting to one side, 
   beginning to spin clear with the Enterprise moving away 
   from it. 
 
 
   The mass of material crashes into the Tsiolkovsky. 
   Her warp and impulse engines EXPLODE SIMULTANEOUSLY 
   on impact in a mighty BLAZE OF LIGHT. But Enterprise 
   is accelerating out of trouble. 
 
           CUT TO: 
 
 
   as a galaxy class starship (USS Yamato) explodes in 
   a blinding flash. When the flash subsides, we have a 
   forward view of space and a barrage of fiery objects 
   hurtling toward us. Suddenly the saucer section, 
   engulfed in flames and explosions, sails past us...
