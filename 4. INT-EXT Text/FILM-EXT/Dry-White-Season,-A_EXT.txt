Dan Pienaar school is a typical Johannesburg Afrikaan
school. The students are mainly from middle-class
families. School athletics are in progress. The stu-
dents, in their smart school uniforms, are cheering
enthusiastically a relay race on the immaculately-kept
sports ground.
GORDON NGUBENE, a 47-years-old African laborer is work-
ing in the school garden. A few feet away is his 15-
years-old son JONATHAN leaning against a wall watching
the games.
BEN DU TOIT, a 50-year-old Afrikaaner history teacher, is
enthusiastically cheering his son JOHAN, a 15-years-old,
who is leading neck-and-neck with another boy in the last
leg of the race. The excitement increases as they
approach the tape. Ben is beside himself, egging his son
with shouts. The young teacher, VIVIERS, standing next
to Ben, is shouting "come on Johan," and slapping the
father on the back.
Johan breasts the tape just ahead of the other boy. The
ground is invaded by boys running to congratulate Johan.
Ben hurries towards his happy but exhausted son; the proud
father pushing his way through the animated boys. As he
reaches Johan he pats him on the back.
BEN
This was your best race.
JOHAN
(excited)
I beat him, Papa.
BEN
(proudly)
You did son. Come on, shower.
They walk happily towards the school buildings in conver-
sation, Johan being slapped on the back by friends. Ben
stops to talk to Gordon who jumps to his feet.
BEN
I'll be expecting you. There
isn't much to do, only weeding
the marigolds and watering the
lawn and flowers.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
GORDON
We'll be there, Mr. Ben'sir,
Jonathan come to help me.
Ben hadn't seen Jonathan.
He turns to him.
BEN
And how's the algebra?
Still
giving you trouble?
JONATHAN
(with respect)
Just a little, Mr. Ben'sir.
JOHAN
Me too.
GORDON
(straightening himself)
He's working hard, Mr. Ben'sir,
and your money will not be
wasted. Emily and me will always
thank you.
BEN
(as he leaves)
See you both later.
Gordon returns to his work a little distance further. A
group of students are laughing and pushing each other
boisterously. As they near Jonathan, two nudge each
other and giggle. Then, one of them trips Jonathan. He
falls to the ground and jumps up aggressively, about to
attack the boy. Gordon shouts "Jonathan."
The headmaster, MRS. CLOETE, aged 65 years, has observed
the incident, but takes no action.
Jonathan stands panting with rage.
He suddenly strides
away towards the gate in a rage.
GORDON
(shouting angrily)
U ya phi?
(Where are you going?)
Jonathan turns to look at his father and continues to
walk off.
TITLES.
The beer hall is a large complex with a drinking area
with long rows of low benches.
(CONTINUED)
3.
CONTINUED:
Men sit drinking African beer in one-half and one gallon
plastics containers. The place buzzes with noise.
Several people are touting wares for sale.
Suddenly a group of about twenty youths walks into the
drinking area, obviously to cause trouble. The LEADER
starts to address the clients.
LEADER
Your children are starving and you
are drinking. We demand freedom
and our fathers are drunk. We ask
you to boycott these beer halls.
Revolution and drink don't work
together!
A large MAN WITH SIDEBURNS, obviously drunk, stands up, a
stick in his hand.
MAN WITH SIDEBURNS
Since when do children talk like
this to their fathers? They need
thrashing.
The man and several others advance on the boys. The boys
run into the serving area, close the doors and start
breaking up the place. Two police Land Rovers SCREECH to
a halt outside. The boys run out through a side en-
trance. They are chased by the police who are black.
Jonathan and his best friend Wellington, also 15 years,
are walking towards the beer hall when the boys come
running out chased by the police. It is prudent for
them to run down the street. The boys and police are
bearing down on them. Their escape is cut off by the
apperance of another police Land Rover. Two policemen,
two blacks and two whites join in the capture. Jonathan,
Wellington and about ten of the boys are arrested.
As they are hundled into the vehicle, they protest their
innocence without success and are driven away.
The MUSIC STOPS. The doors open. The 40 years-old-
minister Bester comes to the door, then stands and greets
his parishioners as they file out of the church.
Amongst them, Ben Du Toit -- his wife, SUSAN, a clean-
cut, immaculate, "toe-the-line" beauty and his son, Johan
-- the blond, blue-eyed, tanned and torsoed fourteen-
year-old every father dreams of. Susan greets friends
and acquaintances, pausing to chat... mostly formalities.
Johan, his eyes on a girl his age. She is with her
father, Mr. Cloete, the headmaster -- she smiles at Johan
from a distance; he waves awkwardly as she drives off
with her parents.
SUZETTE his daughter, sophisticated -- groomed. She
takes her baby from the black nanny waiting in the car,
carries the child to the group chatting with CHRIS, her
husband. She shows it off proudly. Ben is chatting,
concerned, to a WOMAN. She looks drawn and worried.
MRS. COETZEE (WOMAN)
He won't come to church. He lies
in bed all day, listening to his
headphones.
BEN
I wondered why he wasn't at
school. Would it help if I came
to see him? He's always seemed a
good kid to me.
MRS. COETZEE
Oh, would you?
BEN
Of course. I'll phone and we can
fix a time.
Mrs. Coetzee smiles her gratitude.
SUSAN
Ben!
Ben!
She's waving impatiently at him.
He crosses back to her.
Suzette's BABY is HOWLING.
(CONTINUED)
5.
CONTINUED:
She rocks it back and forth, holding it at arm's length.
The BABY SCREAMS. The nanny comes forward -- Suzette
hands it over.
SUSAN
Mrs. Coetzee.
She looked worried.
BEN
She's having trouble with her boy.
He won't come to school.
SUSAN
So you said you'd have a word with
him?
BEN
Yes!
She smiles and walks him to the car affectionately.
The Du Toit family.
Susan is bringing out the salads. Chris, her son-in-law,
is at the barbecue, stinging his eyes. Ben is bouncing
his grandson, little Hennie, in a small, portable pool.
The black nanny sits in attendance in the shade, a towel
at the ready. The good life...
... Suddenly disturbed by... Gordon and Jonathan standing
uncertain at the far side of the garden; Gordon's hat
pressed flat against his chest, Jonathan defiant.
Susan looks up -- as do each in turn -- curious at the
intrusion... then the black nanny -- and finally Ben.
After a moment, Ben walks up to Gordon.
BEN
Gordon!
What are you doing here?
Ben watches
the black man and his son trudge down the
long drive,
the father's arm on the son's shouldre. At
the foot of
the drive the nose of an exotic Soweto cab
can be seen
waiting... a large butterfly painted on the
hood.
Ben takes his place at the table.
Susan brings a piece
of boerwors and a mug of beer.
SUSAN
Trouble?
BEN
Jonathan has been caned, by the
police.
She places the boerwors and the beer before him.

SUSAN
He probably deserved it.
School grounds of the Orlando Secondary School. Students
are milling around in high spirits. One group is putting
finishing touches to a banner reading: "no to aparhteid
education."
There are two other banners being carried around the
school yard, followed by the younger children. They
read:
"No to the Oppressor's language"
"Bantu education is slave
education."
A BOY, one of the eldest, aged about 18 years calls for
silence. The STUDENTS immediately obey.
STUDENT LEADER (BOY)
You all know why we are going to
march.
The crowd shouts:
STUDENTS
'No to Bantu education'
'No to apartheid'
'Freedom Now'...
STUDENT LEADER
There must be discipline. We
start marching from here and we'll
join up with the others at the
main road. Please take care of
the younger ones. Let's go.
The Students start marching led by one of the banners,
singing a freedom song.
Amongst them is Jonathan and Wellington. They are sing-
ing. The march turns round one of the streets.
CROSSROAD
Several groups of students marchers converge to join the
march that has already started, including Jonathan's
group. There are several banners condeming Bantu
education, apartheid, etc.
(CONTINUED)
9.
CONTINUED:
Examples:
"EQUAL EDUCATION NOW"
"ONE MAN ONE VOTE"
"FREE OUT LEADERS"
"NO TO THE AFRIKAANS LANGUAGE"
There are chants of slogans as they march:
STUDENTS
'If we learn Afrikaans vorster
must learn Zulu.' 'Bantu
education! Stinks! Stinks!
Stinks!' 'Equal education! Now!
Now! Now!'
They also start singing a freedom song.
FURTHER UP STREET
Three police Jeeps block the route of the march. A
little distance behind are police troops carriers
('hippos'). About six police-dog-handlers in camouflage
uniforms stand across the road waiting for the march to
approach.
As the march gets closer the students' singing increases
in volume.
The Soweto
police COMMANDANT steps forward with a loud-
speaker in
hand.
He confronts the lead of the march. He
signals for
them to stop. The dogs are straining at their
leashes and
their handlers taunt the leading group.
COMMANDANT
Now listen to me, this is an
illegal demonstration. I order
you to disperse immediately.
The Students start singing the African national anthem
'Nkosi Sikelele.'
Children of 8, 9, 10 years singing lustily with their
fists clenched as everyone else.
Jonathan and Wellington singing.
Camouflauged police scrambling out of Jeeps with guns and
tear gas grenades. They stand with the rifles pointing
at the marchers. The singing continues.
The Commandant confers with a junior officer who hurries
to the group of policemen and gives them instructions.
The ones carrying tear gas move towards front. The
police start donning gas masks.
(CONTINUED)
10.
CONTINUED:
COMMANDANT
This is the last warning.
Disperse immediately or I will
take action.
A voice in the crowd shouts "Banutu education..."
The crowd shouts back "Stinks, Stinks, Stinks."
The Commandant gives a hand signal.
Tear gas canisters are thrown into the crowd, the dog-
handlers attack. There is panic with Students running in
all directions, several choking.
Some of the students start throwing stones at the police,
hitting one in the face; he is helped away by a black
policeman.
Without warning, SHOOTING STARTS.
Children drop, wounded; friends trying to help the dying
and seriously wounded, others helped away.
Some boys appear with dustbin lids as protection and they
pelt the police with stones.
The police in the 'hippos' are jumping off and pursuing
Students, some SHOOTING.
Woman grabs two of the running children age about 9/10
and hustles them into house.
Jonathan and Wellington are running with
a group.
In the
distance the sound of an AMBULANCE SIREN.
A Jeep cuts
off their escape, they turn back running
as SHOTS are
FIRED towards them, a little girl drops,
shot in the
back. Jonathan shouts to Wellington who
is ahead of him.
JONATHAN
Wellington!
Wellington!
Wellington looks back, sees Jonathan trying to help the
little girl. He runs back to help. Another girl, aged
about 17 years, is also trying to help.
Two policemen suddenly appear from behind a house, they
are about 18 years old.
The girl straightens up and confronts the two policemen
shouting hysterically.
GIRL
Shoot me!
Come on, shoot me!
Shoot me!
(CONTINUED)
11.
CONTINUED:
She slumps to the ground crying.
Jonathan, Wellington and the Girl are hustled into a
crowded van amid punches and kicks from the police. The
van drives off leaving the injured Girl on the road,
neighbors run to assist the Girl.
As the van is passing, see a burning car, in the distance
a building on fire; another AMBULANCE SIREN.

MONTAGE
B) The screams, the laughter of white kids playing at
their school, massed in conviviality, Johan one.
C) Behind, aboard a mower, motors Gordon, in the blue
overall of a groundsman, intent in his task.
OVER this white pacifist content, hear...
... GUNSHOTS, SCREAMS, TERROR.
The carnage, the dead, the wounded. The stunned
bewilderment of blacks and police alike... even the
latter unnerved by their own brutality.
END MONTAGE.
Soweto train rushing through suburb of Johannesburg.
REVERSE SHOT FROM train.
Gordon, Emily and their friends cross to Stanley's great
white elderly Dodge, this "etembalami" with the big butter-
fly. For, amongst other things, he is the owner and
driver of a pirate taxi.
They get in. Stanley pauses -- looks across at a small
red VW Beetle parked nearby, waiting. He shakes his
head -- the VW flashes its lights and drives off.
Gordon is at work already -- 8 AM -- mowing the lawn.
He's intense, unsmiling, burdened as he goes about his
task, expertly.
Sounds of BEN and JOHAN LAUGHING coming from inside.
Ben adjusts the sash of his robe and takes the offensive
towards Johan, as he sees Gordon.
JOHAN
Hi, Gordon.
No response.
Ben does a double-take and stops playing.
BEN
(to Johan)
Hold it, champ.
He crosses the yard to Gordon, fluffing his hair dry,
Johan follows behind.
BEN
Gordon, you okay?
No response again. Gordon continues to work.
Ben and
Johan exchange puzzled looks.
JOHAN
Isn't this Jonathan's day to help
you?
BEN
How is he, recovering?
Gordon stops, switches OFF the MACHINE, stands not looking
at Ben.
GORDON
I don't know, Mister Ben, sir --
the police took him.
BEN
Again?
JOHAN
What for?
(CONTINUED)
18.
CONTINUED:
GORDON
They arrested many. They even
deny they've got him. He's
disappeared...
BEN
Disappeared? He's a child -- why
didn't you tell me?
Gordon just looks at him, sadly, patiently.
BEN
Okay!
I'll see what I can find
out.
Ben walks off with Johan as Gordon STARTS the MOWER.
The playing fields, not of Eton but as good as...
... Cries and whistles rise through the still, warm air
from a game of schoolboy rugby being played below us by
immaculately-fitted teams.
On another part of the field Gordon's lawnmower off to
the side -- two figures pace -- slowly -- one white, one
black --
A VOICE overlays all this... strange... ironically
African.
GORDON
Mister Ben, sir. If it was me,
all right. And if it was Emily,
all right. We are not young. But
he's out child. My time and your
time, it's passing. But the time
of our children is coming. And
now if they kill our children --
if we let them -- what is it that
we lived for?
BEN
(places a hand on
Gordon's shoulder --
comforting)
What can we do, Gordon? You or
I... We can't change it.
GORDON
That day, Mr. Ben, sir, when they
whipped Jonathan, you also said we
can do nothing. But if we had...
if someone heard what we had to say
this would not have happened.
BEN
It's a terrible thing, Gordon --
God knows I'm sorry. But you have
other children to live for... I'll
help them too with their schooling.
(CONTINUED)
23.
CONTINUED:
GORDON
(interrupting)
How did he die, Mister Ben, sir?
BEN
I told you, Gordon... He died on
the day of the riots.
GORDON
That's what
they say. But I got
to know for
certain. How can I
have peace?
I must know how my
son died and
where they buried
him.
The game on the next pitch finishes with a pierce of the
whistle. The kids run off past Ben and Gordon. Gordon
climbs onto the small lawn mower and STARTS the ENGINE.
BEN
Gordon.
The police -- if they've
said...
GORDON
I don't care what they say. He is
my child. God is my witness today:
I cannot stop before I know what
happened and where he lies. His
body belongs to Emily and me.
And drives away -- chugging across the field... leaving
Ben -- helpless -- behind him -- watching.
From his:
OFFICE WINDOW
in the school behind -- a worried headmaster watches.
We hear his voice over.
CLOETE (V.O.)
... This business of Gordon's son.
Be careful, Ben. These are not
normal times -- one has to make
allowances.
CUT TO:
The car park. He and Ben are getting into their cars at
the end of the day.
(CONTINUED)
24.
CONTINUED:
BEN
Don't worry! I'm no crusader.
I've known Gordon a long time,
that's all.
CLOETE
I understand -- it's your
Christian duty to your neighbor.
BEN
Something like that -- yes.
CLOETE
Just don't get too close.
Teachers must stay out of
politics. Love to Susan!
And drives off, leaving Ben watching him, shaking his
head at the man's obtuseness.
Emily is watering a tiny vegetable plot in the yard, with
a bucket and a pierced tin.
Robert is playing nearby with the youngest child.
Robert sees Gordon walking slowly to their house and says
playfully to the baby:
ROBERT
Look who's coming? It's baba!
Emily turns to look. She immediately realizes that some-
thing is wrong. She drops the tin and walks a few steps
toward the gate.
Gordon sees her and stops.
Emily starts to break down.
EMILY
Oh, no... oh no, Lord.
Gordon hurries to embrace her.
EMILY
(sobbing and repeating)
Please don't tell me...
Gordon starts to lead her to the house.
Margaret, Emily's neighbor, comes, hurries, helps her,
comforts her, escorting them to the house.
25.
Stanley and Gordon are driving along Soweto main road.
A 10-years-old BOY stops the car.
Wellington and a few pals are standing outside the shop
-- they greet Stanley as they see the car -- Stanley
shouts back greeting.
STANLEY
Take it easy, boys. Hey
Wellington!
Wellington comes to the car.
He's limping, wearing
sunglasses.
As he's approaching the car, Stanley opens the back door
for him.
He enters and removes the glasses.
Stanley notices a deep scar from the forehead to the
cheek.
STANLEY
What happened... Don't tell me...
GORDON
Did they do that to you?
(CONTINUED)
26.
CONTINUED:
Wellington has a nervous arm-twitch... and nods to the
question.
GORDON
(anxiously)
I want to know what happened to
Jonathan.
WELLINGTON
Isn't he out yet?
(pause)
I last saw him weeks ago.
STANLEY
Jonathan is dead.
GORDON
I have to know how he died.
Ben appears on the other side of the veranda. He is in
Cloete's company -- the little big man... grey hair...
65 years old. The headmaster.
They stop in before Ben's colleague, Vivier, passing,
shakes hands with him. A woman arrives and waits. Cloete
says something to Ben, then laughs.
(CONTINUED)
34.
CONTINUED:
Ben smiles and Cloete goes into the office.
The woman approaches Ben... talks to him... they both turn
back to see...
... Emily standing there, a soaking headscarf tied native-
style around her head.
Ben thanks the woman and crosses the yard.
BEN
What's happened, Emily?
EMILY
(calmly)
I'm sorry, Baas... but it's
Gordon.
... Stanley is waiting in his car.
His sunglasses on his
nose...
... The SCHOOL BELL RINGS to give the end of the tea inter-
val. Ben walks out with Emily to Stanley's car. Stanley
gets out, they stare at each other. Finally Stanley
breaks the silence.
STANLEY
(putting out his hand)
How's it? I'm Stanley! I heard
about you!
Ben feels a little uncomfortable.
EMILY
This is Stanley Makhaya... He
helps us all the time.
Stanley opens the door to Emily.
BEN
Don't worry too much, Emily, I'm
sure Gordon will be home in a few
days.
Stanley slaps the door with a big laugh.
He gets into the
car and drives away.
CLOSE ON BEN
perplexed.
35.
Johan is sitting, waiting, in the parked car... the RADIO
ON. He's bored.
Ben opening his car. Johan is sitting in the front seat.
As Ben gets into the car, he glances at the John Vorster
Square building.
BEN
(almost to himself)
God! I never thought Gordon could
commit suicide.
STANLEY
Did you understand me? I said,
they said he committed suicide.
BEN
How do we know?
STANLEY
Gordon wasn't a coward.
(CONTINUED)
57.
CONTINUED:
BEN
Yes, but...
STANLEY
(interrupts aggressively)
What do you mean 'but'? What
about Timol who they said had
jumped from a top-floor window?
What about Ngudle? What about
Mosala? Joyi? Malele? They all
died in that John Vorster Square.
All suicide, eh?
Ben stares at him. There is something like a strange
silence between them. Ben is confused and Stanley is
staring at him. Ben breaks this embarrassing mood.
BEN
Anything I can do to help?
STANLEY
He's got brothers.
BEN
(surprised)
Brothers?
STANLEY
I'm his brother, man, we all are!
We'll take care of everything.
(with pride)
That's the African way.
BEN
Stanley, I'd like to see Gordon.
STANLEY
Don't look for trouble, man. You
know there are riots all over
Soweto. You're out of it. Why
don't you stay out?
BEN
Don't you understand?
I've got to go.
STANLEY
(with a mischievous
smile)
You got to go? Of course, Lanie... the
last farewell. But we have to be careful.
STANLEY
(like a tour guide)
We are now about to leave the
white jungle and entering the land
of love and glory.
The car approaches a huge perimeter notice:
"YOU ARE NOW ENTERING SOWETO TOWNSHIP.
NO PERSON WITHOUT
THE NECESSARY PERMIT IS ALLOWED..."
Ben is driven into a different world; children playing in
dirty streets, in wrecks of cars, open spaces devoid of
vegetables, smoke from large rubbish dumps, burnt-out
skeletons of buses, beer halls and buildings. Clusters
of policemen in battle dress patrolling in the distance.
BEN
So this is Soweto.
STANLEY
(like an actor, with
big expansive gesture)
Land of love and glory, Lanie!
(turning suddenly
to Ben)
But watch out for the police and
army. They're patrolling all the
time.
The car follows an isolated broken stretch of tarred road
hill cluttered with rusty tins, cardboard containers,
bottles.
A group of young children playing under the blinding sun
in a muddy ditch, notice the big painted butterfly on the
hood of Stanley's car.
They wave and scream at Stanley in their language and he
screams back at them.
Two little girls start running, heading toward the car.
Stanley notices the red VW parked in a corner. He man-
euvers and parks his car nearby.
STANLEY
(opening door)
Hurry up, Lanie.
60.
BEN'S POV
A modern funeral parlor with its name painted on the side:
"MOROKA FUNERAL DIRECTOR (PTY) LTD."
BACK TO SCENE
Stanley notices the two little girls with dusty smiling
faces, standing there waiting for him.
STANLEY
(checking his pants'
pockets)
No sweets today. I'm sorry,
babies.
The children give Stanley a coy disbelieving look as they
watch him go with the "white man."
CHILDREN'S POV
On the doorstep of the funeral parlor: Stanley and Ben
run into a young woman coming out with a shoulder bag
and a camera.
The young woman and Stanley exchange a quick, friendly
greeting -- it's MELANIE BRUWER, the Rand Daily reporter
-- and keep moving.
BACK TO SCENE
Ben turns back for a moment. Her face seems familiar to
him. He would like to talk to her, but there is no time.
Stanley is already inside.
Outside the "sunlight," the children's laughter and
Stanley, hands in pockets, waiting for Ben by the car.
The same two little girls approach Stanley who gives them
some coins -- they run off happily.
Ben is coming outside blinking in the glaring sunlight.
Stanley glares at Ben, who is pale, shaken and silent.
They get into the car in silence.
STANLEY
(turning to Ben)
'The living close the eyes of the
dead. The dead open the eyes of
the living.'
Stanley starts the car.
BEN
Please, take me to Emily.
Stanley looks at him.
STANLEY
Look, we'd took one hell of a
chance to get here, let's not push
it.
BEN
I really have to see her, Stanley.
Stanley drives off.
STANLEY
(determined; looking
through rearview
mirror)
I said don't push it. I have to
keep you alive. What's more the
house is full of mourners.
(CONTINUED)
62.
CONTINUED:
They drive in silence... then:
STANLEY
What are your thoughts now?
BEN
What do you mean?
STANLEY
(aggressively)
Come on. I know you came to see
the body. What do you think now?
BEN
(exposed)
I... I cannot think.
I'm
confused.
STANLEY
You either believe what you saw
or maybe you still prefer the
government version.
BEN
For Christ sake, just get off my
back, Stanley.
STANLEY
Okay.
It was a simple question.
Stanley turns his RADIO ON and BANTU MUSIC invades the
car as it speeds away in a cloud of dust.
The big brassy Dodge is threading its way through the
leafy calm of the white suburb.
The "Bantu" MUSIC is STILL PLAYING on the radio under
Stanley's animated conversation with Ben.
STANLEY
You know, Lanie, when you run a
taxi, especially a pirate taxi
like me, you have eyes and ears
everywhere. Even when a policeman
farts in his bed you know. People
want a reference book, a permit to
stay in Soweto, a house, anything,
we taxi drivers know the routes.
I'll tell you something...
A news bulletin in African language interrupts the music.
Stanley listens.
(CONTINUED)
63.
CONTINUED:
STANLEY
Shit!
BEN
What?
STANLEY
Dr. Hassiem has been picked up.
BEN
Who's he?
Stanley silently pulls up along the curb and comes to
rest at Ben's gate.
STANLEY
Dr. Hassiem is the doctor we got
to represent Emily at Gordon's
autopsy. We wanted the truth.
Ben suddenly realizes the significances.
BEN
He would have testified.
Bloody
hell!
STANLEY
A smart move by your Boer
brothers. They have silenced
Hassiem.
BEN
His report has to be important.
We can only use what we have.
Therefore, Lewinson must get a
very good advocate.
(pause)
If only we could get
hold of this
Hassiem's report.
STANLEY
What's the use? It's one big game
and we blacks are merely
spectators. Hey Lanie, can one be
a spectator as he's being kicked
around?
He laughs.
(CONTINUED)
64.
CONTINUED:
BEN
It's not a question of being
spectators. The courts are
impartial, the law is what
matters.
STANLEY
(quite seriously)
That's what you all say. I have
to move man. Your neighbors!
Now, be careful. They will put
their marks on you!
BEN
Who?
Stanley takes an empty cigarette packet from his pocket,
he writes on it.
STANLEY
You'll find out!
(handing the packet
to Ben)
In case you need me. Don't give
your name -- just say 'Lanie'
phoned -- right?
Ben gets out of the car.
BEN
Now tomorrow at ten...
STANLEY
(interrupting)
Sharp! At our smart liberal
friend's office, yeh!
BEN
Good night.
Stanley drives vigorously away.
Ben walks slowly and thoughtfully towards his house.
He
notices Susan watching him through the window.
He slumps on a chair on the veranda as Susan comes out of
the house followed by Johan -- they both stand slightly
worried at his moroseness.
BEN
I went to Soweto and saw Gordon's
body. They have lied to me, my
own people -- they killed him! I
saw the body.
(CONTINUED)
65.
CONTINUED:
Johan looks horrified.
SUSAN
Ben, you're not a doctor. His
death was announced officially.
They wouldn't say anything unless
they were certain of their facts.
BEN
(more animated)
Facts? There's a doctor who
participated at the autopsy.
A
Doctor Hassiem and he...
SUSAN
(interrupts)
You mean the Indian doctor who's
been arrested?
JOHAN
It was in the five o'clock news,
Papa.
BEN
That's him, he represented Emily
at the autopsy.
SUSAN
(suddenly desperate)
Ben, I'm sorry about Gordon's
death, but please for all our
sakes, forget about this whole
thing. Let's get back to a normal
life.
BEN
Can I have a drink?
JOHAN
A brandy?
BEN
You always know what I need.
Johan hurries into the house.
SUSAN
(pleading)
Please, Ben, I'm frightened.
She turns and walks into the house, leaving Ben.
66.
The large Soweto cemetery has scores of graves ready for
burials. The chief mourners, Emily, Robert, his sister,
Margaret, four relatives and Stanley are standing on
either side of the PRIEST. Gordon's coffin is in the
grave; several wreaths are on the side of the grave.
There are about fifteen hundred mourners, and half are
youths. There are several local reporters and overseas
television reporters.
The police are in attendance in large numbers at the edge
of the crowd, some in battle dress and some with dogs.
PRIEST
Before I conclude, I have to say
we are tired of making this
journey every day, sometimes twice
in one day, burying our children,
and those, like our departed
brother, Ngubene who were merely
seeking the truth; and those who
have been denounced by traitors
amongst us; and those who have
been brutally killed for no
reason, yes I shall say it, by the
police. Let those who rule this
land of ours listen to the word
of God; let them listen to our
peaceful and just demands; let
them be humble and go down on
their knees and seek forgiveness,
then listen to God.
The crowd roars:
"Amanda!
Amanda!"
The Priest starts a short hymn and the crowd joins in.
At the end of the hymn.
PRIEST
We will have a few words from Mr.
Pilani our father and leader.
The crowd starts singing a freedom song with arms raised.
The funeral has now become a political demonstration.
Mr. Pilani, who is a dignified, educated 70-years-old,
walks slowly and waits beside the chief mourners. He
is handed a loudspeaker.
(CONTINUED)
67.
CONTINUED:
A SENIOR POLICE OFFICER threads his way through the
crowd, a loud hailer in his hand. As he reaches the
grave he turns. The crowd is quiet. He says something
to the Priest then addresses the crowd.
SENIOR OFFICER
The funeral is over. I order
everyone to go home. This is not
a political rally. I repeat,
disperse.
As though by signal the police start attacking the
mourners with truncheons and dogs. There is pandemon-
ium, women screaming, people falling into graves or
covering in them.
The Priest and Stanley lead Emily and the family away
in the opposite direction.
The press and television are recording the scene. The
police start throwing tear gas canisters. There is no
confrontation, the crowd is fleeing in all directions.
One television cameraman is purposely pushed into a grave
by a very young policeman, his round recordist is pulled
up into the adjourning grave by the connecting cord.
Melanie stands on a tombstone watching and making notes.
Stanley and Ben are driving in the outskirts of
Johannesburg.
Stanley drives seemingly alone at very high speeds, which
he maintains through the streets of Soweto... using his
horn to scatter people out of his way, to the anger and
indulgence of others.
The CAR SCREECHES to a halt outside Emily's house.
Stanley gets out of the car and greets the startled
neighbors... and acknowledges the friendly shouts of
children.
Stanley looks around, then goes back to the car, opens
the back door, leans and says something. Suddenly, to
everyone's astonishment, Ben crawls out of the car;
Stanley hustles him into Emily's house.
Stanley waves at the people, a sign of assurance, then
closes the door behind him.
A small group of youngsters are there, hands thrust into
their pockets, hanging around in a stony silence.
Robert is standing by the door.
Stanley calls one of them and talks to him -- the boys
look around and say something.
As Stanley goes back to the door, passing Robert, he
ruffles his hair.
STANLEY
(to Robert)
Take it easy.
(then to Ben)
It's okey, dokey, but hurry.
Ben hurries out of the room.
The children stare at him.
BEN
(as they go to the
car)
Do I...
(CONTINUED)
73.
CONTINUED:
STANLEY
(interrupts)
Yes, on the floor man.
Stanley opens the back door for Ben.
Who crouches on
the floor.
Some of the boys snicker and one bursts out laughing.
As Stanley gets into the car he shouts at them:
STANLEY
Okay. Kids, time to go home.
Be
careful.
BOY
(shouting back)
Sure 'bra' Stanley. Take it easy.
Stanley drives off at speed.
Stanley is driving, they have left Soweto.
Ben still on
the floor.
BEN
Are we still in Soweto?
STANLEY
Why don't you look for yourself?
Ben rises and sees that they're at least a mile out.
He
is not amused.
BEN
(sitting up)
What the hell are you playing at?
STANLEY
(as he bursts into
loud laugh)
Precautions, Lanie.
BEN
(exposing)
Don't call me Lanie!
What does
that mean anyway?
STANLEY
(still laughing)
You will not understand, Lanie.
They drive off.
74.
Emily, Margaret, Stanley and a man, are sitting outside
the court eating fish and chips.
There are various Africans sitting around for their lunch
break.
CUT TO:
Melanie drives into the yard. The house is an old
Colonial style house amidst flowers, bushes and trees, a
controlled wild garden.
A figure is bent over a beehive. A large brimmed old hat
with a net hides his head and features.
Melanie stops the car in the driveway.
MELANIE
(pointing from the
car)
There he is by the eucalyptus
tree, on the left. That's old
Bruwer.
They get out of the car and walk towards him.
BEN
How long have you lived here?
MELANIE
Oh, about twenty-one years.
I
love this house.
BRUWER
(without looking up)
Is that you, Melanie?
MELANIE
Of course, Dad. I want you to
meet a friend.
BRUWER
Does anyone have a friend
nowadays?
(CONTINUED)
92.
CONTINUED:
He straightens up and throws the net over his head and
studies Ben. MR. BRUWER is seventy years old; an
interesting face with a goatee beard.
MELANIE
Mr. Du toit, Dad.
BRUWER
Do you like bees?
BEN
(smiling)
I have nothing against them.
MELANIE
(to Ben)
Be careful, I can see philosophy
coming.
BRUWER
You shut up.
(to Ben)
Let me tell you about bees, and
for that matter ants: a bee has
a completely altruistic sense of
purpose -- based on the common
good. A course from which he
cannot be deflected. Greed,
ambition, they mean nothing to
him. He lives solely to serve
his fellow bee.
MELANIE
What about individuality, Dad?
BRUWER
There's the rub, my girl. There's
the rub. One of these days I'll
ask the bees. I'm sure they have
the answer. Now, you two run
along!
He replaces his net and continues with the hive.
MELANIE
A drink, Dad?
BRUWER
I've been peeing too much this
morning.
(CONTINUED)
93.
CONTINUED:
MELANIE
(as they walk toward
the house)
That's my Daddy.
Melanie and Ben enter the house.
Ben walks
out of the shop. The newspaper under his arm.
A group of
three middle-aged women turn to look at him.
Ben didn't
see them. A little further on, he meets Mrs.
Coetzee.
He tries to greet her but she walks straight by.
Further on, he notices two men obviously talking about
him. Then a couple of boys on bikes snigger as they
pass him. He begins to wonder what's it all about, and
spontaneously checks his clothes.
Susan and Suzette sit there. Suzette's holding a news-
paper -- the Ossewa -- Susan's thoughtful, her face is red
and discomposed -- obviously she had cried. The PHONE
RINGS but they deliberately ignore it.
Ben appears with the newspapers under his arm, sees
Suzette's sports car and hurries to join them.
Suzette doesn't even give him a chance to kiss her.
SUZETTE
(jumping up and showing
the cover of Ossewa)
Now, Papa, this is going too
far! How could you?
BEN
(surprised)
How's that, Suzette?
Ben takes the newspaper and looks at the cover. A picture
of himself and Emily outside the courtroom. The two faces
are close together with the notes:
"EMILY NGUBENE, wife of native who
died in detention, comforted by a
friend of family, Mr. BEN DU TOIT."
And in parenthesis "see page two."
He throws the Ossewa on a chair and checks into the Rand
Daily Mail. Inside there is a long article with Emily's
picture, titled "the Face of Grief."
Ben folds up the newspapers, and shakes his head. He
suddenly realizes why the people reacted like that outside.
(CONTINUED)
99.
CONTINUED:
SUZETTE
You didn't stop to think of the family.
Poor mother, how can she face anyone?
And tomorrow is Sunday!
BEN
Now listen...
Johan steps into the veranda.
JOHAN
What's everybody yelling about?
SUZETTE
You listen, Papa, just tell me, why?
Recognizing his father in the photo, Johan has picked up
the newspaper from the chair.
BEN
Do you really think I specially
arranged for the photographers to
take that picture? And what's
more it's distorted.
SUZETTE
What's distorted about it? Your
face is practically touching that
meid's face, like you were about
to kiss her.
BEN
(disgruntled)
Suzette, pull yourself together!
SUZETTE
Today the whole country has seen that
photograph. We, your children, are
going to suffer. At this very moment
Chris is negotiating with the Provincial
Council. Would you like to see them
cancel it? You have no feeling, Papa!
BEN
(shocked)
Suzette!
She leaves in rage.
JOHAN
(conciliating)
What's Papa done, anyway? If
something happened to him,
wouldn't you be upset?
(CONTINUED)
100.
CONTINUED:
SUSAN
(standing up)
Not enough, Johan, to throw myself
into the garden boy's arms.
BEN
That goes without saying.
JOHAN
(trying to joke)
There must be easier ways of
getting your name in the paper.
Before she can stop herself, Susan slaps him across the
face, although not hard. Johan leaves without a word.
She clutches her hand, shocked at having it against him.
The PHONE starts to RING.
Susan runs out sobbing.
Ben looks at her then walks into the living room to pick
up the phone.
The farm is a typical transvaal farm covering thousands of
acres.
In the distance there's a range of mountains.
Several cattle are grazing, herded by a poorly-clad African
and his son, aged 8 years.
Bester and Ben are leaning on the wooden fence of the
cattle kraal with calves penned in.
BESTER
Everything was examined in depth
in court.
BEN
Did you read the papers, Dominee?
Were you happy with what came to
light? And is it the Magistrate's
work to pretend that the facts
which came to light didn't exist?
BESTER
Was it really facts, Ben?
Just then the African "HERDBOY" walks up to them taking
off his lattered greasy hat.
BESTER
Ja?
What is it Tom?
TOM (HERDBOY)
Does the Baas want me to bring the
bull now?
BESTER
Later, Tom.
TOM (HERDBOY)
Dankie, Baas.
Tom hurries away.
BESTER
I bought a bull last week.
BEN
I know, Gordon. What they said about
him, that he was plotting against
the government -- is a downright
lie. He was only doing what I
would have done as a father;
searching for his son.
BESTER
No one but God can see what's in
our hearts.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
102.
CONTINUED:
BESTER (CONT'D)
Isn't it presumptuous to pretend
we can speak for someone else?
BEN
Have you no faith in your fellow
men, Dominee? Don't you love your
neighbor?
BESTER
(confronting Ben)
Wait a minute, instead of
criticizing blindly, don't you
think we have reason to be proud
of the judiciary we have?
suppose
this had been Russia; what do you
think would have happened then?
BEN
What's the use of reaching a
court when a handful of people
have all the power to decide what
is going to be said in that court
and by whom? The one man they
allowed to speak for himself, that
young Archibald Chigorimbo, didn't
he immediately deny everything
they forced him to say in his
statement? And the girl who
spoke of her own torture?
CUSTOMER PAGE 99 MISSING
BEN
That did not refer to our
situation in this South Africa.
Do you know what I believe in,
Dominee, that once in one's life,
just once, one should have enough
faith in something to risk
everything for it.
BESTER
One can gain the world and still
lose one's soul. Tea must be
ready.
Bester and Ben walk towards the house still in
conversation.
103.
Ben stops the car in the Bruwer driveway. From the
driving seat he searches the garden for Bruwer.
He walks up to the front door and knocks, but there's no
reply. He goes 'round to the back and finds the old man
on his knees weeding his vegetable garden.
BEN
Good afternoon, Professor.
BRUWER
(looking up)
Melanie isn't home. You are...
BEN
Ben Du Toit. You have a nice
vegetable garden.
BRUWER
You mean the area or the produce?
BEN
Both.
What plants are these?
(CONTINUED)
105.
CONTINUED:
BRUWER
What's the world coming to? It's
herbs, can't you see? Thyme
there, oregano over there, feunel
next to the tomatoes, sage here
and rosemary somewhere. Poor
plants, they re not in their ideal
soil or climate. Next time, I'll
bring some soil from the mountain
of Zeus. Perhaps the old man's
holiness will do the trick.
He throws down the small weeding-fork.
BRUWER
Come, you are just the person to
sample my greengage wine. I don't
suppose you've ever tasted it?
I'm sure I'm the only person in
the country making greengage wine.
He leads Ben to the two old chairs by the back wall. He
enters the kitchen and returns with a bottle of greengage
wine and two glasses.
BRUWER
(as he pours)
The first bottle this year, and
you don't have to tell me if you
like it or not. Tell me, did you
ever study philosophy?
BEN
Not really.
I've read a few
books.
BRUWER
(taking a sip)
Not bad, in fact quite good. Now
where was I... Oh, I was going to
say after decades of philosophy, I
find myself being forced back to
the earth. Do you know, Ben, we're
all living in the spell of
abstractions. Hitler, apartheid,
the great American dream, the lot?
BEN
What about Jesus?
BRUWER
Misunderstood.

(CONTINUED)
106.

BRUWER (CONT'D)
(referring to the
wine)
You don't have to finish it.
BEN
(lying)
It's quite nice.
BRUWER
Melanie has told me a little about
you. It's not an easy road you
have chosen.
BEN
I feel I have no choice.
Bruwer farts loudly, Ben is taken aback, but the
Professor continues.
BRUWER
Of course you have a choice.
Damn it. One always has a choice.
Only thank God you made the choice
you did. But all I want to say
is, keep your eyes open, young
man.
BEN
That's encouraging.
BRUWER
We are both Boers, Ben. We know
how hard our people worked to get
a toehold on this land; it was a
good life. Now look at the mess.
It's all systems and no God!
Sooner or later people start
believing in their way of life as
an absolute: unmutable,
fundamental, a precondition. Saw
it, with my own eyes in Germany,
a nation running after an idea.
Sieg heil, sieg heil. I left
there thirty years ago because I
couldn't take it any longer. And
now I see it happening in my own
country, step by step.
Terrifyingly predictable. This
sickness of the great abstraction.
He farts and sips his greengage wine.
(CONTINUED)
107.
CONTINUED:
Ben is so fascinated by the old man's conversation he
didn't react. He is learning form his old Afrikaner.
BEN
What you say is very interesting
and important.
BRUWER
Take for example the way the
government is handling the
electorate; like a bloody donkey.
Carrot in front and kick at the
backside. The carrot is
apartheid, Dogma. The kick is
quite simply, fear. Black peril,
red peril, whatever name you want
to give it.
(pause)
Fear can be a wonderful ally, Ben.
I talk too much, I always do with
younger people, they don't fall
asleep to me.
BEN
(laughs)
We Afrikaners have to stop to turn
a blind eye and look around us and
at ourselves.
BRUWER
You are right. We still have
time. History should teach us
about those who regarded
themselves as the chosen people.
BEN
(standing up
comforted)
Professor Bruwer, may I say I have
needed to hear somebody say some
of the things you said. I still
have hope for our country.
BRUWER
If you lose that you have lost
everything. I'll get back to the
earth.
BEN
(shaking hands)
Thank you.

BRUWER
I'll tell that hot-head daughter
of mine that you came to see her.
Ben takes his leave.
It's lunch time and the working population of Jo'burg
has paused for lunch. Ben and Melanie are sitting at a
table outside. The cafe is on the outskirts of a very
affluent part of Johannesburg.
(CONTINUED)
109.

MELANIE
I didn't think you would want to
have anything to do with me after
that crap in the Ossewa.
BEN
Why?
You didn't write it.
MELANIE
I'm a journalist, perhaps tarred
with the same brush.
BEN
No.
MELANIE
So what happened? I can imagine.
The family, the dominee,
colleagues, neighbors...
BEN
A distorted photograph and a few
poisoned words and meneer Du Toit
is a leper. That's why I called
on you the other day, I needed to
talk to somebody rational.
MELANIE
Thanks for the compliment. But
remember, you're an Afrikaner,
you're one of them. In their eyes
they regard you as the worst kind
of traitor.
BEN
You are an Afrikaner too, and your
articles, in a liberal English
paper?
MELANIE
My mother was a foreigner, I'm not
pure, wragte Afrikaner. They
don't expect the same loyalty from
me that they demand from you.
BEN
What kind of loyalty? Blind
loyalty. Until the deaths of
Jonathan and Gordon, I gave all
the loyalty I could give, laager
loyalty. You know, Melanie, we
Afrikaners have always lived in
our laager, we have not seen
what's beyond the mountains.
(CONTINUED)
110.
CONTINUED:
MELANIE
Has it ever occurred to you that
the Volk may be scared to leave the
laager? That's the downfall of
this country. So, where do you go
from here?
BEN
We carry on.
There has to be
justice.
MELANIE
Justice.
BEN
We lost at the inquest, so we
pursue them in a civil action.
I
consulted the attorney Dan
Lewinson.
MELANIE
We know each other well.

However you go about it.
STOLZ
I can understand you're upset
about having your house searched

Ben and Father-In-Law are having a drink after a round of
golf, outside the club house.

FATHER-IN-LAW
I'm getting tired of the trek to
Cape Town and then back to
Pretoria. If I had my way,
Parliament and government would
be in the same city. There's
nothing wrong with Pretoria.
BEN
I thought you'd prefer Cape Town;
the sea and Table Mountain.
FATHER-IN-LAW
That's for
holidays. Anyway, Ben,
one of the
reasons for this visit
was that I
wanted to have a
discussion
with you.
BEN
What about?
FATHER-IN-LAW
It's that photograph in the
papers. Ben, a thing like that
could be an embarrassment for
someone who is a member of
Parliament. It's a grievous day
when one's family's behavior
comes between him and his duty
to the fatherland.
BEN
Are you blaming me for trying to
help those people?
FATHER-IN-LAW
I've been doing that all my life,
be they black or white. But no
member of our family has been seen
with a Kaffir woman before, Ben.
Father signals the African waiter for more drinks.
BEN
I am glad you mentioned it, Father.
Because I'd like to discuss the
whole thing with you. First,
there's the matter of Gordon
Ngubene himself.
FATHER-IN-LAW
What about him? I thought the
case was closed.
(CONTINUED)
115.
CONTINUED:
BEN
The inquest didn't clear up half
of what happened.
FATHER-IN-LAW
Oh, really?
BEN
We have no irrefutable evidence
yet, but we have enough to
indicate that something serious is
being covered up.
FATHER-IN-LAW
You're jumping to conclusions,
Ben.
BEN
I know what I'm talking about.
The black waiter places the drinks on the table.
FATHER-IN-LAW
All right, Ben, I'm listening.
Perhaps I can use my influence.
But you'll have to convince me
first.
BEN
If they have really nothing to
hide, why is the special branch
going out of its way to intimidate
me.
FATHER-IN-LAW
(practically choking)
What's this about special branch?
BEN
They raided the house; they are
tapping my phone, and I have been
threatened by one of the officers.
FATHER-IN-LAW
I'm sorry, Ben, I'd rather not
have anything to do with this sort
of thing.
BEN
Why?
FATHER-IN-LAW
If the special branch are involved
they must have good reasons.
(CONTINUED)
116.
CONTINUED:
BEN
It's exactly what I said, Father,
when Jonathan first got into
trouble. Of course, they have
good reasons: hushing up how
Gordon died and how his son died!
FATHER-IN-LAW
(angry)
Ben, how could you side with the
enemies of your people?
BEN
You mean you're prepared to sit
back and allow an injustice to be
done.
FATHER-IN-LAW
(his face grows
purple)
It's you, Ben, who talk about
injustice? A man who teaches
history at school? Did you forget
what our people have suffered
under the English oppressors?
Now that we have at along last
come to power in our own land.
BEN
Now we're free to do to others
what they used to do to us. What
will you do if you were a black
man in this country today, Father?
FATHER-IN-LAW
Don't you realize what the
government is doing for the blacks?
It's a slow process, Ben. One of
these days the whole bloody lot of
them will be free and independent
in their own parts of the land, the
bantoustans -- what can be more
just than that? But they're not
ready yet.
The waiter returns -- Father-in-law pays the bill, and as
he rises to leave, he puts a paternal arm on Ben's
shoulder.
FATHER-IN-LAW
We have nothing to be ashamed of
before the eyes of the world, my
boy.

Don't underestimate us, Ben.
Our
power of survival. We are
Afrikaners!
Stanley is parked in a street corner in the last
white
suburb on the way to Soweto. Ben pulls up in his
car
behind Stanley's. He walks over to Stanley's car
and
enters the back. Stanley smiles as he points at
his
watch.
STANLEY
African time.
BEN
I'm sorry.
They drive off towards Soweto.
STANLEY
Doesn't matter, Lanie -- as long
we are on time for the revolution.
BEN
The special branch searched my
house four days ago.
STANLEY
The S.B. searches your house?
(chuckles)
Did they take anything?
BEN
A few journals, letters -- nothing
much. Just wanted to scare me,
that's all.
STANLEY
Don't be so sure. They may think
you're onto something big.
BEN
They're not that stupid.
(CONTINUED)

Stanley laughs.
STANLEY
'Lanie' -- don't you believe it --
nothing's as stupid as the old S.B.
If they decide it's a bomb they're
looking for, you can shove a turd
in their face and they'll swear
to God it's a bomb.
He laughs... making Ben smile.
A pause.
STANLEY
And did they?
BEN
What?
STANLEY
Scare you?
BEN
No.
They tried too hard.
Stanley laughs again.
STANLEY
Hallelujah!
(offers his huge
hand)
Shake, man. Join the club.
Ben accepts the handshake.
CUT TO:
A 40-year-old African woman walks up to Ben's kitchen
door. She knocks.
Ben opens the door in pyjamas and dressing-gown.
She
hands him a note and leaves.
Ben reads the note and goes back into the house.
Vrededorp is a colored section of Johannesburg. It's
rundown area vacated by whites. There are children play-
ing in the street. Some unemployed men are sitting on
old chairs outside a doorway; a vendor is serving two
women from his milk churn.
Ben drives into the street
searching for an address. He
stops outside a house. As
he gets out of the car the
children and everyone stop
to look at him with interest.
He walks up to a door and
knocks.
A COLORED WOMAN appears as the door opens.
She is young
and obviously educated.
COLORED WOMAN
Mr. Du Toit?
Ben nods, hesitatingly.
COLORED WOMAN
Please, come in.
Ben walks into the living/dining room. It's a
very tidy
room with a three piece sitting room suite, a
sideboard
with a clock on it. At one end of the room is
the dining
area. The floor is linoleum and covered with
a rug in
the middle.
Stanley is lounging on a settee, beer in hand. On the
chair next to him a black man in a brown striped suit,
drinks orange squash. Thirtyish, pleasant face but very
tense. He rises as Ben walks in.
STANLEY

hands with Ben)
How's it? No trouble finding this
place? You met Sadie. She's one

SADIE (COLORED WOMAN)
Please sit down, Mr. Du Toit. A
beer, tea or orange squash?
BEN
A beer would be nice.
Sadie goes to a cupboard and brings out a bottle of beer
and a glass. She opens the beer and hands it to Ben.
She disappears into the bedroom with a curtain at the
door.
STANLEY
You know they call this place
Vrededorp, but we baptize it
Malay Camp. Your first time in
Malay Camp, Lanie?
BEN
I've driven through here many
times.
STANLEY
The main road, eh?
BEN
(smiling)
Ja.
The woman re-enters.
SADIE
You'll excuse me. Stanley, you
know what to do with the key.
STANLEY
Sure, Sadie. And thank you. Can
I help myself to another beer?
SADIE
You know it is. Goodbye, Mr. Du
Toit, and you, be careful.
To the Seroke.
(CONTINUED)
131.
CONTINUED:
SEROKE
(trying to smile)
Okay, Sadie.
Sadie leaves.
STANLEY
That woman can die for you. We
mustn't be long, Johnson has to
be back on duty.
BEN
Alright, let's get on with it.
Stanley tells me, you work at
John Vorster Square.
SEROKE
I had no choice, they transferred
me there.
BEN
Yet you smuggled out letters to
Emily?
SEROKE
(pulling the fingers
of his left hand one
by one cracking the
joints over and over)
What do you do if a man asks you,
and he's in trouble?
STANLEY
If they find out he'd be in very
big trouble.
BEN
I know that. Tell me, what do you
know about Gordon?
SEROKE
Very little.
BEN
You did talk to him from time to
time?
SEROKE
He gave me the letters.
BEN
When was the last time you saw
him?
(CONTINUED)
132.
CONTINUED:
SEROKE
Just before he died.
BEN
Did you attend any of the
interrogations?
SEROKE
No. I'm not a member of the
Special Branch. But once I had to
deliver a letter to Capt. Stolz,
Gordon was there.
BEN
(concerned)
How were they interrogating him?
Seroke hesitates and looks at Stanley.
STANLEY
It's okay.
Tell him what you told
me.
BEN
(anxious)
What?
SEROKE
They were using the pole.
BEN
The pole, what's that?
STANLEY
(demonstrating)
They handcuff you and manacle your
feet then they put a pole between
your arms and the back of your
knees. Then you're like a chicken
ready for the oven. They hang you
between two tables. Then they do
what they like with you. The S.B.
call it the aeroplane.
Ben is horrified.
BEN
I see. Who were in that room?
Stolz...
SEROKE
Lieutenant Venter and a black S.B.
(CONTINUED)
133.
CONTINUED:
BEN
You are sure?
STANLEY
He's sure.
BEN
(to himself)
It's very interesting. When was
the last time you saw him?
SEROKE
(nervous)
I saw them take the body away to
the cells. He was limp.
BEN
You did! Johnson, why do you stay
with the police? You don't really
belong there.
SEROKE
It's a job. And how can I go
away? I love my family.
He jumps up and faces Ben with a look of anger and panic.
SEROKE
They must never know I told you
anything. Right?
BEN
I understand.
I promise.
STANLEY
This is strictly between the
three of us. Don't worry, man.
Seroke shakes hands with them as he's leaving.
STANLEY
(slapping his back)
Take it easy.
Stanley goes to the cupboard for another beer.
STANLEY (O.S.)
A beer, Lanie?
BEN
(shouting)
No, thank you. You know, Stanley,
after what happened the other
night I was about to give this
whole thing up.
(CONTINUED)
134.
CONTINUED:
STANLEY
(intrigued)
What happened, man?
BEN
My wife nearly got killed. Three
shots were fired into the house.
What right have I to expose my
family to harassment and actual
physical danger? That's what I
asked myself.
STANLEY
Three bloody shots and you crawl
on your hands and knees to people
like Stolz, and say 'I give up.'
What is the beginning for you is a
version of what we suffer all our
bloody life. Shit, I thought you
had more guts than this, man!
BEN
I didn't say I'm giving up.
STANLEY
But you thought about it.
BEN
Johnson has revived my
determination.
STANLEY
It's a hell of a time, Lanie, but
we'll survive. You and me. I
tell you!
BEN
You think we may still win in the
end, Stanley?
STANLEY
Of course not, Lanie -- but we
needn't lose either -- what
matters is to stick around.
Ben nods.
STANLEY
By the way, man, I'm off on a trip
-- Botswana -- thought I'd tell
you in case you get worried.
BEN
Why are you going there?
(CONTINUED)
135.
CONTINUED:
STANLEY
Business. Tell you next week.
Now for the bad news I've been
saving to the last.
BEN
What?
STANLEY
Julius has been arrested. He
broke his banning order and
visited his sister. You know what
that means? At least a year's
imprisonment.
BEN
A year in jail just for visiting
his sister?
STANLEY
That's the chance he took. And
he'll be the last to complain.
BEN
Don't you think the real reason
for this arrest was that they
found out he was helping us?
STANLEY
So what? Lanie, you're not
getting guilt complexes now, are
you? That's a luxury only
liberals can afford. Julius will
be back, man. All refreshed by a
spell in the deep-freeze.
BEN
How can we shrug off a man we've
been working with?
STANLEY
Who said we're shrugging him off?
Best way of remembering a man,
Lanie, is to carry on fighting.
Parked outside the house is a municipality truck already
half-laden with Emily's furniture and possessions. Four
Africans in khaki overalls are loading the truck -- super-
vising the eviction of Emily are a white Soweto official,
Captain Stolz and Lt. Venter. In the b.g., a hundred yards
away is a "hippo" with black and white armed policemen.
Behind the truck are two police Land Rovers.
Emily is sitting outside on one of her chairs as neighbors
walk up to her to comfort her and say their goodbyes. Her
daughter is carrying the youngest child and standing next
to Emily -- several children are watching. A woman in
the crowd starts singing a freedom song: "UMZIMA
LOMTHWALO" ("THIS BURDEN IS HEAVY"). The song is taken up
by the other women.
Venter tries to stop them and disperse them. Stolz
signals to him to leave them alone. One of the Africans
then walks up to her for the chair. She refuses to get
off the chair. The man looks at the white official as
though to ask "what do I do." The official looks at
Stolz. Venter walks up to Emily and, about to pull her
off the chair.
EMILY
Don't you touch me!
Venter pulls back. The women start to ululate. Emily
rises majestically, takes the youngest in her arms and
walks slowly to the truck followed by her daughter.
People cluster around her, singing with rage and shaking
her hand. Stolz observes the scene, impassive.
WOMAN (V.O.)
Come back!
Buya!
CROWD
(shouts)
Buya!
Buya!
Emily and the children are helped onto the back of the
truck which drives away preceded by the police "hippo" and
escorted from the rear by the Land Rovers. The crowd
continues singing.
Ben is leaving his home. This is a Saturday morning. Two
men are sitting in a car a few yards from the entrance to
the house. Ben doesn't pay attention to them. When he
is about twenty yards past, one of the men, Jaimie -- who
was present when Gordon was arrested -- gets out of the
car and follows Ben. Ben stops at a corner for a car and
again the FOOTSTEPS stop.
(CONTINUED)
140.
CONTINUED:
He turns furtively and sees the man, stopped, turning his
head. Ben decides to turn the corner, and listens to the
FOOTSTEPS. The man is still following. Ben then decides
to turn right back to have a good look at the man. They
pass each other and Ben takes a good look at him and turns
back onto the streets to the local shops. The man decides
not to follow.
Stanley peers through the curtains: he sees a car parked
outside the house. In it Jaimie and another S.B. They
are watching the house. Stanley quietly opens the door
and walks outside.
Stanley walks past his car and approaches the policeman.
STANLEY
(using his usual
humor)
Good evening. I'd like to invite
you into my humble home, but it's
full of terrorists.
The two policemen get out of their car, obviously angry.
JAIMIE
(pointing at Stanley's
car)
Open the boot! You cheeky bastard!
STANLEY
Okay, with pleasure.
They search and find nothing.
JAIMIE
Open the door and remove the seat.
Stanley executes the order. Jaimie and the OTHER POLICE-
MAN peer in, their eyes sweeping the car.
OTHER POLICEMAN
Now, your pass, bliksem.
Stanley
produces his passbook and hands it to the Police-
man who
inspects the pages laboriously, then throws the
book to
the ground. Stanley doesn't pick it up and just
watches
the man.
JAIMIE
You watch your bloody step!
Right?
They return to their car and drive off. Stanley looks at
them thoughtfully, then picks up his book.
All the students are in classes. Cloete walks
out of a
classroom and sees Capt. Stolz walking towards
the build-
ing. Cloete stops to wait for him. They shake
hands and
walk to Cloete's office talking affably. They
enter
office.
142.
It's the end of the school day. The yard is practically
deserted. Only Viviers waiting for Ben under the veranda.
Ben appears.
VIVIERS
Oom Ben, I was waiting for you.
I have something interesting to
tell you.
BEN
(striding on towards
his car)
Later, Viviers.
VIVIERS
(keeping up)
But, Oom Ben, it's about the
S.B. they came to question me.
Before they started questioning
me I told them they were wasting
their time.
Ben doesn't react.
VIVIERS
They asked if I was cooperating
with you. What I knew about the
A.N.C. Can you imagine that! They
then said: 'Mr. Viviers you come
from a good Afrikaans family and
it's important that you realize
that communists are looking for
people like you and before you
know where you are they're using
you! And, Oom Ben...
BEN
(reaching the car;
interrupting him)
I'm sorry, Viviers. I never
wanted you to get involved.
(getting into his
car)
I have just resigned.
VIVIERS
(amazed)
What...?
Ben drives away.
145.
The immaculate blue of the pool. Johan hurls himself out
of the water, flops down at the side.
Suzette and Ben nearby, sitting in the sun.
Pieter at the barbecue, sizzling thick steaks.
A servant in white uniform soundlessly laying the table
on the patio behind him.
The nanny with the baby in the shade.
BEN
-- How's she doing?
SUZETTE
Better... She's waiting for you to
ask her to come home.
BEN
I doubt it.
(CONTINUED)
154.
CONTINUED:
She turns to Ben, squinting in the sun.
SUZETTE
Papa, I don't want to interfere...
BEN
Then don't.
A pause.
SUZETTE
I know this is going to sound
strange coming from me... I mean
I haven't exactly been supportive
for the past months... I can't say
I agree with what you've done but
I respect you for what you are...
ON Johan listening.
SUZETTE
I'm just... destroyed by what's
happening to us as a family.
BEN
Suzette...
SUZETTE
(interrupts, squeezing
his arm.)
Please, Papa, for Mom's sake...
For all of our sakes... Let's
try and patch it up.
Ben smiles sadly at her... Suzette understands.
Johan
looks at them.
MIX TO:
Ben and Johan in the car.
Suzette leans in through the
driver's window.
SUZETTE
Let me know if there's anything I
can do to help.
BEN
Thanks.
I'm glad you understand.
(CONTINUED)
155.
CONTINUED:
SUZETTE
I don't want to worry about you.
That search, this vandalism, those
shots... they're really after the
evidence you've been accumulating
... Can I look after them for you,
Papa?
Ben smiles.
BEN
You don't have to worry.
They'll
never find them.
SUZETTE
(smiling)
Where on earth do you keep them?
ON Johan looking at Suzette then at Ben with concern.
Ben has parked his car in a street corner of the upmarket
section of the Asian township. He peers around him, then
walks away.
Ben knocks at a door.
The door is opened cautiously by DR. HASSIEM, a tall,
handsome Indian, aged 35 years. His clothes are casual
but expensive. His six-year-old daughter, large dark
eyes, is clinging to his leg. We recognize the little
girl of the photograph near the telephone, from earlier.
BEN
Dr. Hassiem? I'm Ben Du Toit.
I'm a friend of Gordon Ngubene's...
DR. HASSIEM
(raising his hands)
The inquest is over, Mr. Du Toit.
BEN
Not for me, Doctor. I've got to
know what happened to Gordon.
Dr. Hassiem looks shaky, nervous.
DR. HASSIEM
I only came home yesterday. After
three months in detention and now
I'm banned and confined to the
house. There's nothing I can do
for you.
(CONTINUED)
156.
CONTINUED:
The little girl still clinging to his leg, watching Ben.
BEN
I know it may be painful to you,
Doctor, but I need to talk to you.
DR. HASSIEM
How can I be sure you weren't
actually sent by them?
BEN
Ask Emily. Doctor, we are in the
process of filing a civil claim.
And your help is vital.
Hassiem gives Ben a long look.
He picks up his daughter
and opens the door fully.
DR. HASSIEM
Come in.
Ben walks into the large living room, tastefully
furnished.
DR. HASSIEM
Sit down.
Ben is still looking 'round at the opulence.
He sits in
a chair.
BEN
Thank you for inviting me in.
DR. HASSIEM
(the little girl on
his knees)
What do you want to know?
BEN
Just one thing, Doctor. Why did
you sign the State Pathologist's
report on the autopsy if you drew
up your own report as well?
DR. HASSIEM
(disconcerted)
What makes you think I signed Dr.
Jansen's report.
BEN
The report produced in court had
both your signatures on it.
(CONTINUED)
157.
CONTINUED:
DR. HASSIEM
Impossible.
BEN
What did you write in your report?
DR. HASSIEM
Dr. Jansen and I didn't disagree
on the facts. After all we
examined the same body in the same
time. But just on the
interpretation. For example, if
Gordon, had really been hanged,
the marks on his throat would have
been concentrated on the front.
(he touches his
larynx)
But in this case, the bruises
were more obvious on the sides.
Pause.
Ben nods, silent.
DR. HASSIEM
Something else really upset me,
perhaps it isn't important.
BEN
What was it?
Dr. Hassiem puts down his daughter.
DR. HASSIEM
(leaning forward)
You see, through a misunderstanding
I arrived at the morgue too early
for the autopsy. There wasn't a
soul around except a young African
attendant. When I told him I'd
come for the autopsy, he let me in.
The body was on the table dressed.
I noticed blood on the clothes.
BEN
And then?
DR. HASSIEM
As I examined the clothes more
closely, a police-officer came in
and said I wasn't allowed in the
morgue before Dr. Jansen arrived.
When I returned with Dr. Jansen,
half an hour later, the body was
naked.
(CONTINUED)
158.
CONTINUED:
BEN
(excited)
Doctor, we've already got the
African attendant's affidavit. He
testified that Capt. Stolz ordered
him to burn the clothes.
(pause)
Did you mention what you said in
your report?
DR. HASSIEM
Of course.
I found it most odd.
BEN
Doctor Hassiem would you be
prepared to put that in writing?
Dr. Hassiem thinks it over for a while then:
DR. HASSIEM
Please excuse me for a minute.
Ben watches him leave the room, the little girl following
him. He gets up from the chair, walks to the window,
glances through it, then steps to look at some family
photographs on the mantlepiece. Amongst them a photograph
of Dr. Hassiem before "Big Ben." Dr. Hassiem returns
with a file, the daughter still following.
DR. HASSIEM
(opening the file)
This is my report. I only have
one copy.
BEN
(astounded)
You have a copy of the report?
Hassiem grins.
DR. HASSIEM
I know how to hide things from the
S.B., Mr. Du Toit.
Ben congratulates him by a deep laughter.
CUT TO:
Ben and Johan arriving at the house. An unsympathetic
small crowd is there waiting... They react, murmuring
in Afrikaans, watching them with hostility as Ben and
Johan get out of the car and discover the chaos. The
wreckage. The garage and Ben's study have been bombed.
Johan leaves Ben and rushes to the house. The crowd
starts to disperse.
The entire
tools cupboard has been methodically ripped
apart and
the contents strewn on the garage floor.
Everything
is half-burnt... charred... Ben has sunk onto
the stool
in total defeat. There's silence.
Then Johan appears at the door. He hands Ben a large
envelope -- in it, the file with all the papers. Ben looks
up at Johan.
JOHAN
(very proud)
I took it out. Hide it in my
secret place.
Ben grabs his son, hugs him and holds on for dear life.
BEN
Thank you, son. You did a man's
job.
CUT TO:
Ben and Johan are walking towards the entrance, Johan
wheeling his bike. Ben hugs his son.
(CONTINUED)
168.
CONTINUED:
Johan gets on the bike and rides out.
CUT TO:
It's raining. Stanley driving in the rain on the same
road as Johan.
CUT TO:
Suzette's sports car pulls up outside the cafe where Ben
is waiting.
CUT TO:
Suzette gets into her car and drives off. The parked
car follows. The two cars turn at the next corner.
The two cars approach following each other. As the second
car overtakes, he draws Suzette's attention with his HORN
and signals her to pull up.
As she gets out of her car holding the brown envelope,
Capt. Stolz gets out of the other side.
Suzette walks over to the passenger:
Colonel Viljoen.
VILJOEN
(smiling)
I see you got the goodies.
(CONTINUED)
171.
CONTINUED:
SUZETTE
(happily)
I was on my way to your office,
Colonel.
STOLZ
We thought we'd save you the
trouble, Mrs. Klopper.
She hands Viljoen the envelope.
SUZETTE
Here it is, Colonel.
VILJOEN
Thank you. This country needs
more people like you.
SUZETTE
I must hurry, Colonel.
Goodbye.
She drives off.
CUT TO:
Stanley is parked near the building. He's drumming on
the steering wheel to the rhythm of AFRICAN MUSIC from
his car RADIO.
CUT TO:
Johan hurries out of the building and is about to get on
his bike. His attention is drawn by Stanley's familiar
HOOTER.
Johan turns, sees Stanley, and with a grin makes thumbs-
up sign which happy Stanley returns with his large thumb.
Johan cycles away followed by Stanley.
CUT TO:
Captain Stolz alone in the car.
He drives around the
corner into the cafe street.
Just then, Ben is hurrying across the road to his car.
Captain Stolz sees him, accelerates and hits Ben, hurling
him high into the air. And speeds away.
People rush to Ben's side... crowd quietly gathers.
