FADE IN:

EXT. GREENWICH VILLAGE - DAY (STOCK)

A sunny spring day. The Village streets bustle with their
own unique life.

2 INT. MUSTY BOOKSTORE   DAY 2


A booklover s paradise; cramped, chaotic, but with treasures amidst
the junk. The aisles between the floor-to-ceiling bookshelves are
narrow, old hardcovers jammed into every possible inch of shelf.
Stacks of unsorted books cover the proprietor s desk and surround it
on every side. Daylight streams through the front door, and we SEE
the establishment s street address SILHOUETTED ON THE FLOOR. The
numbers are 777. As we HOLD on the address, the bell over the door
JINGLES as Cathy enters with an impatient JOE MAXWELL at her heels.

                          JOE
            How long is this going to take?
            We re running late already...

                          CATHY
            I just want to browse for a few
            moments. I love old books.

Joe picks the top book off a stack, blows the dust off the pages,
flips it open.

                          JOE
            Here, this one s old.

Cathy glances at the title page: THE COLLECTED SERMONS OF COTTON
MATHER.

                          CATHY
            Not quite what I had in mind.

The proprietor, MR. SMYTHE, steps out of an aisle behind them. He s
in his late sixties, a formidable character with a cultured voice and
a magnificent gray moustache.

                          MR. SMYTHE
            Perhaps I can be of help?

                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                              2.
2 CONTINUED:2

                          JOE
            She s looking for a book.

Smythe arches one eyebrow, glances around.

                          CATHY
            Something very special... maybe
            a first edition... poetry...

Joe rolls his eyes; Smythe picks up on it.

                          MR. SMYTHE
            English poetry is down aisle
            three... toward the back... feel
          free to browse for as long as you like.

Joe glances at his wristwatch, sighs.

                          JOE
            Radcliffe, we ve only got--

                          MR. SMYTHE
            Young man, there is a video store
          on the next block. I understand
          they have Vampire Cheerleaders
          in stock.

                          JOE
                      (defensive)
          Hey, I read! I m a lawyer...

                          MR. SMYTHE
                    (drily)
          We shan t hold that against you.

Joe gives him a put-upon look, glances at his watch.

                          JOE
          I ll be back in twenty minutes.
            You re on your own for lunch,
            Radcliffe.

As Joe starts out the door, Smythe calls after him.

                          MR. SMYTHE
          We shall miss you, young man!
                    (Cathy laughs)
          This way, if you please.

He escorts Cathy back to the poetry section.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:                                                                          3.

3 IN THE STACKS - A FEW MINUTE LATER 3

Cathy browses among the poetry books. The volumes are old,
dusty, the aisle dark and narrow. Cathy removes a book
from a shelf, leaving a GAP, and through it.

4 ANGLE THROUGH THE BOOKS 4

An EYE watches her through the gap in the books. Cathy,
intent on the book, doesn t notice.

5 RESUME CATHY 5

as she leafs through the book, puts it back in piace. She
has to stand on her tiptoes to reach for a different volume
on the top shelf. As she strains to reach it, we hear a
VOICE from behind her.

                            KRISTOPHER (O.S.)
            Try this one...

Cathy turns to see Kristopher. He s a boyish thirty-five,
attractive in a sort of rumpled, unkempt way, dressed in
faded denim and a Mets cap, and he s holding a book,
offering it to her. He presses it toward her, and she
takes it, almost by instinct... but when she sees what
she s holding, she REACTS with delight.

5A INSERT - ON THE BOOK 5A

as Cathy turns its pages. It s a real antique, in
excellent condition, fine paper, gold-tipped pages, sewn
signatures, color plates. No doubt; this is the one.

                            CATHY
              Tennyson... a first edition.

5B RESUME5B

as looks up, smiling, happy with the find.


                            CATHY
            It s wonderful... thank you...

But she STOPS suddenly in mid-sentence, her smile turning
to a look of puzzlement. She s alone in the aisle. She
looks behind her, peers around a corner, but there s no
sign of Kristopher anywhere. Cathy shrugs, takes the book,
and walks toward the front of the store. At the end of
the aisle, she looks back.                                                                              4.

6 CATHY S POV  6

The aisle is still empty.

                          MR. SMYTHE (O.S.)
            I see you ve found your book.

7 RESUME7

as Smythe gently takes the book from Cathy.

                          CATHY
            My book?

                          MR. SMYTHE
          Mr. Tennyson s book, actually.
          It was waiting for you, young
            lady.

Cathy gives him a bemused look. The proprietor expands on
the theme as he leads her to the front desk.

                          MR. SMYTHE
            All books wait. They sit
            patiently on their respective
            shelves, gathering only the most
            refined dust, until the day their
            covers are opened and their pages
            turned by the proper person.

He sits behind the desk and checks the price inside the
book s front cover. Cathy rummages in her purse and offers
him a credit card just as Joe returns.

                          JOE
            Okay, Radcliffe. Lunch is over.
            We re due back in court in ten
            minutes.

The proprietor looks up and sighs.

                          MR. SMYTHE
            Oh, joy! The tit-willow is back!

Cathy LAUGHS as the old man takes the card from her hand.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

8 INT. DA S OFFICE LOBBY - SEVERAL HOURS LATER 8


Cathy and Joe push through a revolving door with a crush of
people. They cross toward the elevators, talking about the case.
Joe s annoyed.

                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                              5.

                          JOE
            Six continuances! At this rate,
            I m gonna be drawing social
            security before we get to trial
          on this thing- -
                    (elevator starts to
                    close)
            Hey, hold the elevator!

Joe JUMPS forward, and makes it into the crowded elevator
just in time. Cathy, a step behind, doesn t. She gets an
exasperated look as the doors slide shut in her face.

Cathy presses the UP button to call another elevator. As
she waits, a HAND enters frame and taps her shoulder.

                            KRISTOPHER (O.S.)
            Excuse me.

                                                        SMASH CUT TO:

9 INT. FATHER S CHAMBER - SIMULTANEOUS 9

Father is sorting through a stack of books, searching for a
particular title, while Vincent watches.

                          FATHER
            Here we are... no, that s not
            right. I know it s here
              somewhere... one of these days
            I really must ask Cullen to build
          me some bookshelves...

Vincent smiles. Then, suddenly, he experiences a CHILL at
the moment when Kristopher touches Catherine. Father
notices and looks up from his books.

                          FATHER
            Vincent? What is it?

                          VINCENT
              Nothing.. - for a moment I felt...
            a coldness...

                          FATHER
          Is there a draft? I hadn t
            noticed...

Vincent sounds puzzled; he s never felt anything like this
before.

                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                        6.

as Cathy turns to Kristopher. We never see him enter; he s just
there. It takes her a beat to recognize him.

                          CATHY
            You...

                            KRISTOPHER

            Look, this sort of thing is never

                          CATHY
                    (suspicious)
            What sort of thing?

                            KRISTOPHER
            Are you... ah... often approached
            by strangers?

                          CATHY
            This is New York City. I m

                            KRISTOPHER
              Lunatics?

Cathy SMILES despite herself. Emboldened, Kristopher digs
around in his pocket, and offers her a business card. It s
crumpled and creased, smudged, much used.

                            KRISTOPHER
            I m not a lunatic. But...
                    (beat, smile)
            I m the next best thing.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                7.

            Too eccentric?

              something... you know to... well,
            make sure I didn t, ah... try
              anything....

The notion of Vincent chaperoning while she sits for Kristopher
brings a SMILE to Cathy s face.

                          CATHY
            That would be... interesting..

                      (elevator arrives)
              Thanks, but... I don t think so.

She shoves the card into a jacket pocket as she boards the
elevator. Kristopher follows close behind.

                            KRISTOPHER
              Wait...

Cathy hands the card back to him as the elevator doors
close. She can t resist a GRIN.

                          JENNY
            He took back his card?

                          CATHY
            He said he only had one.

                          JENNY
            Sounds like an artist all right.
            Remember Craig?

                          CATHY
            Oh god, yes. The one with the
            pony tail...

                          JENNY
            ... and the unheated loft. I
            posed for him for three weeks.
            In February. In a sheet. When
              I finally looked at the painting,
            I wasn t even in it.

                          CATHY
                      (laughing)
            What?

                          JENNY
            He told me he just liked to look
            at naked women while he worked..
            it helped his creative juices or
              something... but don t let me
              influence you. They can t all
            be like Craig. This guy might
            turn out to be the next Picasso
            or something.

Joe appears, and heads towards Cathy s desk, a stack of
file folders under his arms. He overhears them talking.

                          CATHY
            So you think I ought to pose for
            him?

                          JENNY
            You might wind up on the wall of
            the Metropolitan. Then I cari buy
              postcards of you to mail to my
              friends..

                      (laughs, delighted)
            Maybe you could publish a
              calendar.

                          JENNY
            Sure. We ll have framed prints,
            wrapping paper, coffee mugs...
              there s no telling where it might
            end.

Joe has overheard the last few exchanges in their
conversation. He drops the file folders on Cathy s desk
and looks down at her, waiting.

                          CATHY
                      (laughing)
            Well, this better end right now.
            The tit-willow needs me.
                      (laughs)
            No, no, no. I ll tell you next
            week at dinner. Bye.

She hangs up the phone.

                          JOE
            What was that all about?

                          CATHY
                      (lightly)
            An artist followed me back from
            the bookstore. Jenny thinks maybe
              I ought to pose for him.

                          JOE
            Pose for him?
                      (alarmed)
            Cath, you got to watch out for
            these arty types. They get you
            alone, give you a little wine,
            and the next thing you know
              you re... well.., you know...
              I mean, these guys, they ve got
              a line, they like to take
              advantage...

Joe is clearly finding this a tad embarrassing. Cathy,
amused, plays it with mock innocence, with puzzled looks
and small nods to keep him going.

                          CATHY
            How s that, Joe?

                    Well, you know.., they try and
                    talk you into..., out of... it s
                    not like fashion models, some of
                    the time you pose, well,
                    without... without any... you
                    know... kind of... well, nude.

                          CATHY
                            (amused relief)
                    Oh, is that all? Don t worry.
                    I posed for a life study class
                    in college.
                            (off his reaction)
                    Joe, are you blushing?

      Flustered, Joe looks away, turn ng his attention to file
      folders he s brought here.

                          JOE
                    Never mind. Hey, it s none of
                    my business. Look, I need the
                    Ketter testimony broken down by --

                    You sure this guy is on the up-

                          CATHY
                    Kristopher Gentian. Relax, Joe,
                    he s harmless.

                          JOE
                    Famous last words. I want that
                    stuff tomorrow morning..

                          CATHY
                    I ll take it home, do it tonight.

      Cathy watches with a bemused smile on her face as Joe turns
    and walks off. RITA ESCOBAR, headed for Cathy s desk, is
      crossing past Joe when he stops and looks back.

                    In college... that d be Radcliffe,
                    right?

                    You had me going for a minute
                    there, Chandler. Radcliffe s a

15 ANGLE PAST CATHY ON VINCENT 15

    as reads a random passage from the book.


                          VINCENT
                    But in her web she still delights/
                    To weave the mirror s magic
                    sights/ For often through the
                    silent nights/ A funeral, with
                    plumes and lights,/ And music,
                    went to Camelot:

      They both REACT as an unseen voice finishes the poem.

                            KRISTOPHER (O.S.)
                    Or when the moon was overhead!
                    Came two young lovers lately wed/
                     I am half sick of shadows  said/
                    The Lady of Shalott..                                                                                  13.

16 RESUME16


we hear a faint RUSTLING of bushes as someone approaches.
Vincent instinctively draws back toward the shadows, then
hesitates and looks at Cathy. She urges him on.

                      (urgently)
            Go... before you re seen...

A brief hesitation... then Vincent whirls and vanishes
inside the tunnel, almost simultaneous with Kristopher s
stepping out of the darkness. Cathy STEPS BETWEEN THEM, to
make sure Kristopher cannot see Vincent.

            What century did he walk out of,

            blue bird, singing of beautiful
            and impossible things, of things
            that are lovely and...

Frustrated beyond endurance, Cathy SEIZES Kristopher by
the arm and drags him away from the tunnel entrance.
He comes along docilely.

Cathy makes a sound as if she d gladly strangle him, and
yanks him at harder. They move off across the park
together, Kristopher stumbling along beside her.

            my life. Do you think I could ever

19 EXT. VILLAGE STREETS - NIGHT 19


The streets shine, dark and wet, but there s still plenty
of foot traffic as Cathy and Kristopher walk through the
Village, back toward the artist s usual haunts. Kristopher
is several steps in front, walking backwards so he faces
Cathy, almost skipping, and gesturing widely with his hands
as he talks. Other pedestrians have to detour to avoid
him, but he s almost oblivious.

            Would I have seen him?

                          CATHY
              I don t who you think you saw,
            but--

                            KRISTOPHER
            Oh, yes you do. When are you
            going to tell me about him?

                          CATHY
            You are being very trying,
              Kristopher.

                            KRISTOPHER
              I can t help it. I m an - -

                          CATHY
            - - artist, yes, I know. Since
            when is invasion of privacy part
            of the creative process?

                            KRISTOPHER
            I had to follow my heart...

                          CATHY
            Next time you may follow it right
            past the Louvre into city jail.

As they pass in front of the CAFE ARPEGGIO, a Village
coffee house, a SPRY OLD WOMAN in a beret exits.
Kristopher grabs her by the shoulders and dances her around
happily in a circle..

                            KRISTOPHER
            Did you hear that? She said next
            time! She s forgiven me!

The old woman breaks free and staggers away, looking at him
as if he s mad.

                            KRISTOPHER
            It s all right, I ve got artistic
            license. We re allowed to be peculiar...

                    (drily)
            Don t worry, we ll have him
              committed soon.

The old woman backs away quickly, shaking her head at both
of them. Cathy can t help smiling.

                            KRISTOPHER
            She s smiling. Yes, that s
            definitely a smile...

                            CATHY
              I thought you were shy.

                            KRISTOPHER
            I am large, I contain multitudes.
            Do you like expresso?

              Cappuccino? Cafe au lait?
              Canoli? They have a zabaglione
            in here that will break your heart.

                      (wearily)
              Kristopher...

            Just an hour, that s all I want.
            Well, maybe two... I won t ever
            say a word about Vincent or bother
            you again.

Cathy gives him a long dubious glance and starts to shake
her head no. Kristopher grins his most child-like
disarming grin. Despite herself, Cathy begins to weaken.
As she begins to smile, we

20 INT. CAFE ARPEGGIO - LATER 20


A cross-section of Greenwich Village characters sit on
wrought-iron chairs at tiny marble-topped table . In the
b.g. is a case full of Italian pastries and a gigantic
expresso machine that has seen a lot of use over the years.
The waitresses wear black leotards and the walls are hung
with oil paintings in heavy ornate frames.

Kristopher and Cathy sit in one corner. A trio of ART
STUDENTS occupy the adjoining table, books and sketch pads
piled on an unoccupied chair between them. Cathy glances
at the walls and the general decor.

                            KRISTOPHER
            It s great, isn t it? I love this
            place. It always makes me feel
            like Lorenzo de Medici may walk
            in at any moment to discuss a
            commission

                            CATHY
            With you?

                            KRISTOPHER
            Who else? But he ll have to wait
            till I ve finished having coffee
            with Simonetta Vespucci.
                    (off her look)
            She was Sandro Botticelli s great
              inspiration. You can see her face
            in his paintings.

A WAITRESS arrives at the table, serves Cathy a cup of
expresso and a small sandwich cut in quarters, and
Kristopher a zabaglione and a frothy cappuccino. He looks
worriedly at Cathy s sandwich.

                            KRISTOPHER
                    (to waitress)
            You used to cut the crusts off
            those sandwiches...

                            CATHY
            It s okay, I m allowed to eat
              crusts.

The waitress moves off as Cathy tastes her sandwich.

                            CATHY
            So, did Botticelli have coffee
            with Simonetta on a regular basis?

                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                              20.


20 CONTINUED: 20


                            KRISTOPHER
            He was very fond of her...
                    (shy smile)
            ... even though she was destined
            for another. She married Guiliano
            de Medici. Botticelli took both
            of them to his heart.

Kristopher sips his cappuccino, leaving a mustache on his
upper lip. He wipes it off, reaches over to the next
table, and snags a big art book belonging to one of the art
students. The owner, an attractive blond girl, about nineteen,
protests.

                            ART STUDENT
            Hey...

                            KRISTOPHER
            It s all right...


He opens the book to show to Catherine.


21 INSERT - THE BOOK 21


A close shot of a full-color reproduction of Botticelli s
Venus and Mars. Kristopher points to the faces.

                            KRISTOPHER (O.S.)
            See... Simonetta and Guiliano.


22 RESUME22

                            KRISTOPHER
            They both became inspirations.

Catherine looks from the book to Kristopher, while he
remains lost in the image on the page. She s amused.

                            CATHY
            And they all lived happily ever
            after?

Kristopher gives a little shrug, a sad half-smile.

                            KRISTOPHER
            Guiliano was killed during the
            Pazzi Rebellion. Simonetta was
            taken by a fever. Nothing is
            forever, Cathy.

                            CATHY
            That s a strange thing for an
            artist to say.. They re here...
                    (taps the page)
            ... forever.

The art students are getting ready to leave.

                            ART STUDENT
            Can I have my book back?

                            KRISTOPHER
            Sure.
                      (hands it over)
            Hey, you using that sketch pad?

                            ART STUDENT
                      (confused)
                    I just bought it.

                            KRISTOPHER
            Great.
                      (takes it)
              Thanks.

The girl exchanges looks with her friends. One of them
shrugs and gives her a warning look. She shakes her head,
and they exit, leaving Kristopher with the sketch pad.

                            CATHY
                    (drily)
            You know, they sell those.

                            KRISTOPHER
            Only to people with money.

                            CATHY
                    (gets the drift)
            What gallery do you exhibit at,
              Kristopher?
                    (off his shrug)
            You haven t sold too many
            paintings, have you?

                            KRISTOPHER
            Well, maybe my stuff is a
              little... well... strange... they
            had to drag me kicking and
              screaming into the twentieth
            century. Still.., look up
            there. .

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                      22.

He points to a nearby painting. Like the rest of the rest
of the art in the Cafe Arpeggio, it s lush, romantic,
suggesting a by-gone time. Cathy looks up at it for a long
beat, then at Kristopher.

                            CATHY
                      (quietly)
            Yours?

Kristopher gives the smallest and shiest of NODS.

                                  KRISTOPHER
            I ran up quite a tab. The owner
            took it in payment. He was about
              a million years old, you would
            have loved him.
                    (sadly)
            He s dead now.

                            CATHY
            I m sorry.

                            KRISTOPHER
            Still.., that s a sale, right?
            Kind of... do you like it?
                    (before she can answer)
            No, don t, I don t want to know.
            If you hate it, I ll be crushed.

                            CATHY
                      (smiles)
              Kristopher, it s lovely. You re
            very talented..

                            KRISTOPHER
            You like it?
                          (off her nod)
            I knew you would. So you ll pose
            for me, right?

                            CATHY
            You don t give up, do you?

                            KRISTOPHER
            Does a moth give up when he sees
            the most beautiful flame he s ever
              beheld?

                            CATHY
            That s a good way to get your
            wings singed.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                            23.

              singed...
                      (opens the sketch pad)
            Okay, don t pose. Just sit there,
            drink your expresso, let me sketch
            you. What can it hurt?

Cathy looks at him for a long beat, glances back up at the
painting on the wall, then back at Kristopher.

                            CATHY
              I can t believe I m doing this.

Kristopher s joy is written all over his face. Grinning
like a child at Christmas, he props the sketchpad against
the edge of the table, fumbles in his pockets.

                            KRISTOPHER
              Great.. You won t be sorry, I

In darkness. Vincent is in bed, stirring restlessly in his sleep,
tossing and turning, caught in the grip of a dream.
We PUSH IN CLOSE on his face, and

24 INT.. SURREAL WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 24

Vincent s dream POV. He is walking through the vast
echoing interior of an old dark WAREHOUSE. Thick white
MISTS cover the unseen floor, flowing around his feet,
obscuring the vague shapes of old furniture and wooden
crates that loom on all sides. Everything is dusty,
cobwebbed, surreal; the mists are white some great eerie
white blanket. Distorted, surreal.

Catherine appears ahead of him, barefoot, her hair flowing,
dressed in a pale, flowing, filmy white nightgown, sexy
but somehow eries as well. She seems lost, frantic,
searching for someone or something. She turns her head this
way or that.

                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                  24.

Her voice ECHOES. Vincent rushes toward her.

                            VINCENT
              Catherine...

But Catherine does not seem to see him or hear him. She
calls out again and dashes off.

                            CATHY
            Where are you?

Vincent begins to move faster, pursuing her..

25 SERIES OF SHOTS - - VINCENT S POV 25

as he races after Catherine, around and about the gloomy,
otherworldly warehouse, through the ground fog, past all
manner of strange cobwebbed objects, broken furniture and
old toys and disorting funhouse mirrors. This dream chase
should be as weird and scary as we can make it, full of
strange sights and sounds. Finally, up ahead of an
endlessly long aisle that narrows the further along it
goes, he sees Catherine standing, and flies toward her.

As Vincent reaches her, she looks up, SMILING.

                            CATHY
                      (sweet and sad)
            He s dead.

Catherine DISAPPEARS, fading out slowly with her smile
still on her face.


26 VINCENT26

finds himself standing over an old TRUNK. There s a sound
coming from inside it... the sound of SCRIBBLING. Vincent
leans forward, opens the lid.                                                                                      25.
27 ANGLE DOWN INTO TRUNK - VINCENT S POV 27

Inside, with the strange logic of dreams, the trunk is much much
bigger than it has any right to be. There s a LITTLE
BOY inside, no more than four or five. We cannot see his
face. He s wearing a METS CAP and scribbling - - furiously,
franticly, wildly - - inside a COLORING BOOK. The boy is completely
intent on what he s doing. He s surrounded by crayons, half-buried
in them, and as he colors, we see that
he does not pay any attention to the lines. He colors
inside and outside the lines. We only get a glimpse of
the picture that he s coloring, but it s something
mystical, mythical, magical.

PUSH IN TIGHT on the crayon in the little boy s hand and

                                                                  MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

We PULL BACK to

INT. DA S OFFICE - THE NEXT MORNING

Cathy looks a little dreamy as she doodles idly across the
pad. Joe s approach snaps her out of her reverie.


                            JOE
            Done with the Ketter breakdown?

                            CATHY
            I m about half way through. Give
            me a couple more hours...

                            JOE
              I thought you were going to finish
            it at home last night.

                            CATHY
                    Something came up...

                            JOE
            This something didn t have
            anything to do with that so-called
              artist, did it?

It did, of course; Cathy s reaction gives that away. Joe
Maxwell hesitates a moment, then continues awkwardly.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                26.

                    Ah, look, Cath... I don t know
                    how to say this, but... well...
                    I d stay clear of that guy, if
                    I were you. He s running some kind
                    of scam on you, Radcliffe.

                            CATHY
                    I don t know what you re talking
                    about. Kristopher s an artist.

                            JOE
                    Con artist, you mean. Look, he
                    told you he was Kristopher
                    Gentian, right?
                        (she nods)
                    Well, he can t be...

                            CATHY
                    What does that mean?

Joe looks a little embarrassed, but plunges on.

                            JOE
                    I had Escobar run a little check
                    on him...

                            CATHY
                          (incredulous)
                    You what?

                            JOE
                        (sheepish)
                    I know, I know, it s none of my
                    business, but... well... I was
                    worried.

Cathy doesn t know whether to be flattered, amused, or mad.
Joe rushes on before she can make up her mind.

                            JOE
                    You ought to be glad I made it
                    my business.
                        (beat)
                    Kristopher Gentian died almost
                    two years ago.

29 INT. MUSTY BOOKSTORE - DAY 29


The bell over the door JINGLES as a determined Cathy pushes
through into the interior of the bookstore. Joe, bemused,
trails after her.

                            JOE
            This is nuts. Radcliffe, why
            don t you just let me buy you lunch
            and forget about this...

                            CATHY
                        (ignoring him)
            Hello? Anyone here?

                            JOE
            What s it going to take to
            convince you? The guy s dead!

                            CATHY
            Then a dead man did a sketch of
            me last night.

                            JOE
            Hey, you said it, I didn t.

                            CATHY
            We went to a coffee house. I had
              expresso. He had zabaglione.
            Dead men can t even spell
              zabaglione.

              Five ll getcha ten he stuck you
            with the check too.

He did; Cathy s face gives it away, and Joe sees it.

                            JOE
            A-ha! I told you it was some
            scam. He s

                            MR. SMYTHE
            May I be of some
                        (recognizes them)
            Oh. You.
                      (to Cathy)
            Did you enjoy Mr. Tennyson s book?

                            CATHY
            Very much. Listen, there was a
            man in the shop yesterday when
            I was here...

                            MR. SMYTHE
            Of course there was.

Cathy shoots a triumphant see-I-told-you-so look toward
Joe, then turns back to Smythe.

                            CATHY
            I need to find him. . . talk to
            him...

Smythe raises an eyebrow.

                            MR. SMYTHE
            That shouldn t be hard. He s
            standing right behind you...

Half-thinking that Kristopher might have made one of his
mysterious appearances, Cathy glances over her shoulder.
Joe gives her a smug smile. Her frustration increases.

                            CATHY
            Not Joe...

                            MR. SMYTHE
              I quite understand.

                            JOE
            She s looking for some guy she
            saw back in the poetry.

                            MR. SMYTHE
            Definitely not you, then.

                            JOE
            Claims he s an artist.

                            MR. SMYTHE
            We get quite a lot of artists.
              Occasionally one even purchases
              a book.

29 CONTINUED: (2) 29

                            CATHY
            About so tall, kind of rumpled,
              wearing a Mets cap... his name s
            Kristopher Gentian.

Smythe blinks and looks at her for a long beat. His face
gives no clue to what he might be thinking.

                            MR. SMYTHE
            I m sure I don t recall any such
              person. Perhaps you saw him
              somewhere else...

                            CATHY
            He was here, you had to have seen
            him...

Smythe busies himself sorting the books on his desk.

                            MR. SMYTHE
            I m afraid not. Now, if there s
              nothing else...

Cathy gapes at him. She can t believe it, and for a moment
she s at a loss for words. Joe takes her arm.

                            JOE
            C mon, Cath, give it up.

Frustrated, Cathy glares at Smythe s back for a moment,
then opens her purse and pulls out a business card.

                            CATHY
              I don t know what s going on, but
            if your memory should suddenly
              return, give me a call...

She drops the card on the desk in front of the old man.
She and Joe EXIT. As the bell over the door JINGLES to
their departure, Smythe turns to watch them go. He picks
up Cathy s card and fingers it thoughtfully.

30 INT. VINCENT S CHAMBER - DAY 30

Vincent lies in bed. The room is VERY DARK, lit only by a
single reading candle. Pools of SHADOW hide the corners of
the room. Vincent can feel Catherine s agitation; it makes
him feel strangely uneasy. He picks up the Tennyson book,
leafs through a few pages idly, then notices something and
STOPS.                                                                              30.

31 INSERT - THE BOOK 31

Inside the front cover, long ago, someone has pasted a
small personal book plate with the name Kristopher Gentian
written in. Vincent stares at it as we HEAR a faint SOUND
in the stillness of the chamber.

32 RESUME32

as Vincent closes the book and looks up.

                            VINCENT
            Who s there?

There s. no answer. Only silence. Vincent rises.

33 VINCENT S POV 33

Something that looks like a human form stands in the
shadows behind the iron pillar, but the room is so dark
it s hard to be certain.

34 RESUME34

as Vincent takes up a candle and strides forward. The
shadows fills with light as he crosses the room; there s no
one there. Vincent stops, baffled, raises the candle,
looks around carefully. Nothing at all. Suddenly we HEAR
running FOOTSTEPS just behind him. Vincent whirls toward
the sound, and GROWLS.

MOUSE bursts into the chamber, wearing his homemade helmet
with its mismatched flashlights. He s DRENCHED, absolutely
soaking wet, dripping everywhere. Mouse stops dead,
startled by the growl.

                            MOUSE
            Uh-oh. Bad time?

                            VINCENT
            Mouse... I thought for a moment...
                        (beat)
              I thought I saw... an intruder. .
            standing in the shadows...

Mouse doesn t quite know what to make of that.

                            MOUSE
            Down here? In your chamber?

Mouse looks around, suddenly a little nervous.

                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    31.

34 CONTINUED:34

                            VINCENT
            It makes no sense...

Vincent s voice trails off as he stands lost in thought.

                            MOUSE
            Finished the new acqueduct.
                        (moves, squishes, makes
                        a face)
            Little problem.

Vincent has made up his mind about something.

                            VINCENT
            So I see.

                            MOUSE
            Need your help.

                            VINCENT
            To stop a flood?

                            MOUSE
            No. Fixed it.

Mouse shakes off the moisture, looks disgusted.

                            MOUSE
            Swimming lessons.

Vincent SMILES and puts a hand on Mouse s shoulder.

                            VINCENT
              Tomorrow. We ll go to the mirror
            pool.
                        (Mouse grins)
            I m going to see Narcissa. Tell
            Father I ll be back by evening.

Vincent exits, leaving Mouse alone in the chamber. Mouse
looks around curiously, wondering what Vincent saw.

                            MOUSE
                        (musing)
              Intruders..
                        (with bravado)
            Don t scare Mouse.

But just at that moment, Mouse happens to DRIP on the only
candle in the chamber, extinguishing the flame and flunging
the space into TOTAL BLACKNESS except for the flashlights
on his helmet. Off Mouse s sudden nervous gasp of fear
and scramble for the exit, we
                                                                  CUT TO:                                                                  32.

35 INT.. DA S OFFICE   AFTERNOON 35

Rita Escobar is typing as Cathy approaches.

                            CATHY
            Joe tells me you ran the check
            on Kristopher Gentian.
                        (off her wary nod)
            I need to know what you turned
            up... anything that might help
            me find him...

                            RITA
            Find him? You mean - - if you need
            to know where he was buried, I
            can - -

                            CATHY
            Somebody was buried.. I m not so
            sure it was Kristopher.
                        (beat)
            The world has a funny way of
            ignoring live artists and
              celebrating dead ones. Kristopher
            wouldn t be the first painter to
            fake his own death to get a little
              attention...

                            RITA
            You think it s a hoax?

                            CATHY

              a ghost with a cappuccino
              moustache before... tell me what
            you found out about our elusive
            Mr. Gentian.

            Well, he was a native New Yorker,
            went to Cooper Union... an arts
              scholarship. Family s all
              deceased. He had a small
              inheritance, but it must have run
            out... he owed money to everybody
            when he died. . -

            How did he die?

                            RITA
              Natural causes. He d been living
            on the street. .. that night the
              temperature got down to twenty
            below... they found the body in
            an alley off Bleeker.

                            CATHY
            ... carrying all of Kristopher s
            ID, of course.

            Driver s license, social security,
            draft card. It seemed pretty cut
            and dried, but there was a friend
            who viewed the body and confirmed
            the identification...
            a Mr. Smith...
                    (shuffles papers)
            No, Smythe... Jonathon Smythe.

                            CATHY
            You have an address?

Rita digs through some more papers, finds it. She
scribbles it on a memo pad, hands it to Catherine.

                            CATHY
                      (looking at address)
            Seven - seven - seven...

She CRUMPLES the memo paper in her fist; her face tells us
that she s figured it out.

36 INT. NARCISSA S CHAMBER - DAY 36

CLOSE on a shiny black ceramic bowl, half-full of water.
Narcissa s face is reflected in the liquid. As we watch,
she crushes some plants, sprinkling the powder across the
water, then moves the bowl in a small, circular motion.
The water SWIRLS, and the image breaks up and runs.
Narcissa s half-blind eyes stare down into the depths of
the water, finding her own truths beneath the surface.

Vincent appears silently in the doorway behind her. He
does not speak, but somehow Narcissa is aware of him. She
speaks without turning to look at him.

                            NARCISSA
            Come, Vincent..

Vincent steps slowly into Narcissa s chamber.

                            VINCENT
            You heard me approach?

                            NARCISSA
            I saw you... in the waters... oh
            yes, child... come... look...

Vincent studies the dark water in Narcissa s bowl.

                            VINCENT
            I see only ripples...
              Reflections...
            the flame of the candles...

Narcissa gives a strange, enigmatic half-smile.

                            NARCISSA
            You are your father s son.

Vincent considers that for a long beat.

                            VINCENT
            What do you see?

                            NARCISSA
            The past. The future. The faces
            of the dead... spirits seek their
            own level, Vincent... like
            water...
                        (she laughs)
            But I am crazy old lady. -. ask
            the Father... did he tell you
            ghost stories when you were young,
            child?

                            VINCENT
                        (fondly, remembering)
            I fled the headless horseman...
            rode in Kipling s phantom
              rickshaw.., yes... I remember
            Marley s ghost...

                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                35.

                            NARCISSA
            ... bound by the chains he forged
            in life... but there are other
            kinds of chains, Vincent. Fear,
            love, hate... dreams...

Vincent listens to her solemnly, his face impassive. But,
while he respects the old womans beliefs, Vincent remains
skeptical of the things she suggests.

                            VINCENT
            Your world has room for spirits,
              Narcissa... but Catherine lives
            in another world... a world where
            ghosts walk only in stories...

                            NARCISSA
            Are you so sure, child? Come,
            then. Look again.

The old woman picks up a bit of DRIED HERB, crushes it
between her fingers, sprinkles it over the surface of the
water, then stirs the bowl so the water moves again..

                            NARCISSA
            Open your eyes. Look deep.

37 ANGLE DOWN ON BOWL 37

as the water moves round and round, then slows. The last
ripples die, the water grows still. Vincent s own
REFLECTION stares straight up back at him. We HEAR
Narcissa s voice..

                            NARCISSA (O.S.)
            Could such a being as this...
            walk the world your Catherine
            lives in?

Reflected in the water, Vincent s expression undergoes a
subtle change as he understands and REACTS.

                                                                CUT TO:
38 INT. MUSTY BOOKSTORE - EVENING 38

Smythe is totalling up the cash receipts on an old-
fashioned manual adding machine as Cathy throws open the
door, with its 777 address, and barges in.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                36.
38 CONTINUED: 38

                            MR. SMYTHE
            I m afraid we re closed...
                        (beat)
            Ah. You. You are a persistent
            one

                            CATHY
            Is that a compliment...
                        (very pointed)
            Mr. Smythe?

Smythe realizes that the game is up when she calls him by
his name. Smythe SIGHS; there s no use pretending now.

                            MR. SMYTHE
            Oh dear.

                            CATHY
            You lied to me.

                            MR. SMYTHE
            Well, fibbed...

                            CATHY
            How long have you known
              Kristopher?

                            MR. SMYTHE
            When he was a little boy, he used
            to come in and sit for hours,
              reading book after book...
              folklore, mythology, poetry...
            even when he grew up, he would
            rather read than eat.

                            CATHY
            Then why did you pretend you d
            never heard of him?

                            MR. SMYTHE
            It s just... such a bother...
            no one ever believes me anyway...
            you re not the first, you know...

                            CATHY
            Not the first what?

                            MR. SMYTHE
            Why, to see his ghost. - - he
              materializes for all the... more
              attractive.., young ladies.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              37.
38 CONTINUED: (2) 38

                            CATHY
              I can t believe this!

                            MR. SMYTHE
            See.

                            CATHY
            You re still claiming he s dead?

                            MR. SMYTHE
            My dear young lady. Of course
            he s dead. I identified the body
              myself. Such a waste. He had
            so much talent...

Smythe sounds utterly sincere, utterly convincing. Cathy
just stares at him for a long beat, but he stares right
back, unwavering. Finally she throws up her hands in
helpless exaggeration -

                            CATHY
            That s it! I give up!

She turns to leave, but halfway to the door, something
occurs to her and she turns back.

                            CATHY
            His paintings...
                        (beat)
            There was no family, no will...
            none of the paintings had ever
            been sold... what happened to
            them?

                            MR. SMYTHE
                        (sadly)
            His landlord took everything..
            A dreadful man.

                            CATHY
            For the back rent...

                            MR. SMYTHE
                        (nods)
            His books too, but I bought those
            from him. It seemed only right...
            old friends coming home again.

                            CATHY
            The landlord must have tried to
            sell the paintings too...

                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                      38.
38 CONTINUED: (3) 38

                            MR. SMYTHE
              Undoubtedly. The only portraits
            he valued were the ones on dollar
            bills. But I don t imagine he
            had much success. Kristopher s
            work is probably off in storage
              somewhere... presuming it still
              exists...

                            CATHY
            It still exists. Otherwise what s
            the point of this charade?

                            MR. SMYTHE
            So young and so cynical.. I
            wouldn t be so certain if I were
            you, dear lady. This world
              devours our certainties... and
            all our beauties as well...

Off Cathy s REACTION, we

                                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

39 EXT. OLD WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 39

OPEN TIGHT on an old rusted PADLOCK, very formidable,
securing several HEAVY CHAINS across a set of doors.
Painted on the doors, in faded gilt turn-of-the-century
lettering, is CORRIGAN MOVING AND STORAGE, but a bright
yellow printed notice has been slapped across the name,
advising of a BANKRUPTCY SALE JULY 18 1987.

Catherine s hand ENTERS FRAME, touches the lock, tugs at it
in helpless frustration.. The chains rattle.

We PULL BACK to find her on a deserted street in front of
the warehouse. The windows are broken and boarded up.
Cathy s CAR is parked at the curb.

Cathy looks up and down, searching for a way inside the
warehouse. There s nothing; no way in. Frustrated, she
tries the chains once again for want of anything better to
do, but the padlock shows no sign of budging. At her wit s
end, Cathy returns to her car.

She opens the door, slides into the driver s seat, and is
just putting the key into the ignition when we HEAR the
metallic CLICK of the padlock opening. Cathy freezes and
looks over.                                                                              39.
40 CATHY S POV - THE DOOR 40

The padlock is wide open. As we watch, it slides OFF the
chain and hits the ground. The doors SWING OPEN a few
inches, in dead silence, and hang ajar. Within is nothing
but darkness and dust.

41 RESUME41

Cathy turns off the car and gets out. Slowly, warily, she
moves across the pavement, up the steps. She pushes at
the door.. It swings all the way open, revealing only dust
and darkness. Cathy stops, calls out.

                            CATHY
            Hello?

There s no answer.. She steps inside.

42 INT. OLD WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 42

It s VERY VERY DARK. A sea of dark gray, its corners lost
in huge pools of pitch black shadow, the vague shape of
rooms and furniture more suggested than felt. The only
light comes from the street, through the open door.

Cathy lights a match, holds it up, edges forward. Her
footsteps ECHO. She moves through a dark, dusty emptiness;
then, suddenly, the door SWINGS SHUT behind her. Cathy
whirls, startled. Her match blows out, leaving her in
TOTAL DARKNESS.

43 BLACK FRAME 43

                            CATHY
            Who s there?

Her words ECHO, but there s no other sound. We HEAR Cathy
fumbling for another match. She finds one, and we hear
her strike it.

44 RESUME44

The match flares to life, Cathy raises it... and GASPS,
startled for an instant, when she finds a grim, silent
Vincent standing right in front of her..

                            CATHY
            Vincent... for a moment I
            thought... thank god it s you,
            I tell you, I m...

                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                      40.
44 CONTINUED: 44

                            VINCENT
                        (slow, serious)
            ... half-sick of shadows...

Gently, Vincent takes the match from her fingers and uses
it to light the LANTERN he s brought. The darkness pushes
back. They re in a huge, cavernous storage warehouse,
piles of cobwebbed furniture, old trucks, and other
forgotten and cast-off junk looming all around them.
The detritus of modern life, many piles covered with old canvas
tarpulins -

                            CATHY
            Yes. .. I was about to give up and
            go home until.., thanks for
              opening the door...

Vincent looks at her curiously.

                            VINCENT
              Catherine...
                        (beat)
            I did not open any door...

                            CATHY
                        (stunned)
              Then... who...

Behind them, we HEAR the sound of someone apologetically
clearing his throat. There, a few feet away, looking
rumpled and forlorn, is Kristopher.

                                                                FADE OUT

                                      ACT IV

FADE IN


45 INT. OLD WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 45

The floor of the warehouse is a maze; crooked aisles wind
between piles of abandoned goods. Kristopher leads
Catherine and Vincent through the labyrinth, but he seems
vague, almost confused.

                            CATHY
            How long have you been here?

                            KRISTOPHER
            Here? I... I don t know... it
            seems... that s funny, you know,
              I can t seem to... to remember...

He stops, looks around. He seems lost for a moment.

                            KRISTOPHER
            I don t... this way, I think..

They resume walking.

                            CATHY
              Kristopher, I want some answers.
            How did you open that padlock
              without my seeing you?

                            KRISTOPHER
            I just did. I didn t want you
            to go away...


                            CATHY
            Are you living here now, is that
            it?

                            KRISTOPHER
            So many questions. Watch out,
            you might get answers. You ll
              explain all the wonders and
              mysteries in life. Then the
              wonders and mysteries...
                        (beat)
            ... die. I hate questions.
                        (stops suddenly)
              Wait... here...

                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                              42.
45 CONTINUED: 45

A faded canvas tarp covers a rather forlorn pile of
possessions. An old TRUNK is partially covered by the
tarp. Kristopher tugs at it ineffectually, until Vincent
steps forward and pulls it out from under the tarp.
Kristopher seems surprised to recognize it.

                            KRISTOPHER
            That s my stuff!

Vincent and Cathy exchange a look as Kristopher blows off a
thick covering of dust, and throws open the lid. Inside,
the trunk is filled with old COLORING BOOKS.

                            VINCENT
                        (wonderstruck)
            Coloring books...

                            KRISTOPHER
            I couldn t get enough of them when
            I was little.

Vincent picks one off the top, opens it, and gazes at the
colored picture for a long beat. Cathy looks too. The
drawing is vividly, wildly colored, but the young artist
has resolutely colored everywhere, inside and outside the
lines, ignoring those boundaries..

                            CATHY
            You went outside the lines.

                            KRISTOPHER
              I liked going outside the lines.

                            VINCENT
            Some men ignore boundaries.
                        (beat)
            All the boundaries...

Vincent and Cathy exchange looks. She frowns.

                            CATHY
            Coloring books are one thing.
            Pretending to be dead is something
            else.

Kristopher starts to wrestle with the tarp as he replies.

                            KRISTOPHER
                        (nonchalant)
            Dead? What do you mean? Who s
            dead?

                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                              43.

                            CATHY
            Good question. Look, I don t
            think you planned it.

                            KRISTOPHER
              I never plan anything, if I can
            help it.

                            CATHY
            You d hit bottom... your work was
            gone, you were on the streets,
            no one cared... then you stumbled
            on a dead man... roughly the same
            build and age...

Kristopher is still struggling with the heavy tarp. His response
doesn t seem wholly responsive.

                            KRISTOPHER
                        (musing)
            Maybe I am dead... good as dead,
              anyway... an artist is only as
            alive as his work, right?
            Botticelli will live forever, but
            me...

The tarp is too much for him. Vincent FLINGS IT BACK
easily, revealing the meagre pile of Kristopher Gentian s
final worldly possessions. They re a few beat-up pieces of
furniture, some records and magazines&, and DOZENS of
paintings, large, small, and every size in between, stacked
up aginst each other, propped on the couch and chairs,
leaning up against the sides of the furniture.

Cathy and Vincent fall silent, regarding the artwork.

46 CATHY S POV46

PANNING SLOWLY across the paintings. They re very
different, but all recognizably the work of the same
artist. Lush, romantic, erotic, sensual, each of them
evoking a feel for by-gone ages. They re full of myth and
magic, of lost yesterdays and impossible tomorrows. The
technique is superb, the passion undeniable. In their own
way, evoking the feel of times past, Kristopher s
unsaleable paintings are gorgeous.

47 RESUME47

as Cathy REACTS to the beauty of the paintings. Clearly
she is moved and impressed.

                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                              44.

                            CATHY
            Oh, Kristopher. . . they re
            wonderful, you must...

As she speaks, Cathy turns to where Kristopher stood a
moment ago, but her smile fades when she realizes that he s
GONE, vanished as mysteriously as he appeared.

                            CATHY
              Kristopher? Kristopher, where...

She turns, looking for him, but there s no one there. Only
her and Vincent, dust and darkness... and the art.

                            CATHY
            I hate it when he does this.

                            VINCENT
            He s gone, Catherine... I have
            no sense of him.

                            CATHY
            That s impossible.

                            VINCENT
            Is it?

                            CATHY
            He s hiding somewhere... maybe
              there s a secret door...

                            VINCENT
            Or perhaps a magical one.

                            CATHY
              I don t believe in magic.

Vincent SMILES, and makes a sweeping gesture, to indicate
the legacy that Kristopher has left them.

                            VINCENT
            Then - - Catherine - - what is this?

She looks at the paintings once again, then back up at
Vincent, and Catherine s expression SOFTENS. Suddenly she
realizes that it doesn t matter whether Kristopher Gentian
is dead or alive, a ghost or a fake. The art is all that
matters and it s here in front of them.

                                                                  DISSOLVE TO:                                                                45.
48 INT. JENNY ARONSON S OFFICE - THE NEXT MORNING 48

Jenny s desk is covered with manuscripts and galley proofs
of books in progress. A mug of coffee sits on top of one
manuscript while Jenny talks on her phone.

                            JENNY
            If he doesn t get the revisions
            in this week, we won t make the
            fall list. You tell him...
                        (her intercom BUZZES)
            I got another call. You just tell
            him, okay? Later.
                        (switches lines)
            Yes? Who? Of course she can come
            in...

Jenny starts to get up, looking pleased but curious, as
Cathy enters her office.

                            JENNY
            Hello stranger...

                            CATHY
            Sorry to pop in unannounced.

                            JENNY
            Are you kidding? I love it when
            you pop in unannounced... it
              doesn t happen often enough these
            days. Want some coffee?

                            CATHY
            No coffee... just help...
                        (off her curious look)
            All those art books you ve
              edited... you must know a few
              gallery owners.

                            JENNY
                        (laughs)
            Some of them a lot better than
            I ever wanted to..

                            CATHY
            I want to arrange a show. Can
            you help set it up?

                            JENNY
            Well, sure, I ve got a couple
            people owe me favors...
                        (beat, gets it)
            Is this for that guy? The one
            who wanted you to pose?

            Did you do it? My god, you did
            it... you have to tell me
              everything... Is he any good?
            And how s his painting? What

49 INT. TRENDY GALLERY - NIGHT 49

Weeks later. Cathy has put the arm on a lot of friends,
both from her old life and her new, and Kristopher s
opening is a huge success. A fashionable uptown crowd sips
champagne as they move from room to room, discussing the
paintings on the walls.

Joe Maxwell, looking a little uncomfortable in his rented
tux, stands in one corner of the gallery, studying one of
Kristopher s paintings: a fantastic, extravagent, romantic
nude featuring an especially striking woman. Joe is very
impressed. He moves closer to the paintings, and begins
examining the frame, looking for a price tag. He s
engrossed in his search when Cathy, stunning and sexy
in a silk evening gown, comes up behind him.

                            CATHY
              I don t think you ll find the
              model s phone number there...

                            JOE
            How much you figure they d want
            for something like this?

                            CATHY
                        (surprised)
            You re thinking of buying it?

                            JOE
            Hey, why not? The guy s dead,
            it d be a good investment...

                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                              47.
49 CONTINUED:

Joe gives the woman in the painting another long, admiring
look, and GRINS at Cathy.

                            JOE
              I think I could stand looking at
            her for a long time. What do you
            think? I could put it over the
            couch...

                            CATHY
                        (teasing)
            Then what would you do with your
            black velvet Elvis?

Joe gives her an exasperated scowl, but before the
conversation can continue, Cathy happens to glance past
Joe, through the crowd into the next room.

50 CATHY S POV - ANGLE PAST JOE 50

In the b.g., a WAITER offers champagne to Jenny Aronson and
a male companion. The waiter seems to feel Cathy s gaze,
glances up, smiles. It s Kristopher.

                            CATHY
                        (O.S. to Joe)
            Excuse me...

51 TRACKING WITH CATHY 51

as she moves quickly through the milling art lovers toward
Kristopher. But by the time she reaches Jenny Aronson,
Kristopher has vanished again. Cathy stands beside Jenny,
frustrated, looking around.

                            CATHY
            Where is he?

                            JENNY
            Who?

                            CATHY
            The waiter... with the
              champagne...

A DIFFERENT WAITER passes, carrying a tray. Jenny snags one and
gives it to Cathy.

                            JENNY
            Here you go.

                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                              48.
51 CONTINUED: 51

                            CATHY
            I m not thirsty...

Jenny looks completely lost as Cathy turns around, still
looking for Kristopher. Instead she finds Smythe standing
directly behind her.

                            CATHY
            Mr. Smythe. Did you come with
              Kristopher?

                            MR. SMYTHE
                        (amused)
            From the family crypt?

                            CATHY
            I knew he wasn t going to be able
            to resist his own opening.

                            MR. SMYTHE
            I m sure he s here in spirit.
                        (beat)
            When I think how close we came
            to losing all this... You ve done
              a marvelous thing.

                            CATHY
            All I contributed was a setting...
            the marvels belong to
              Kristopher.
                        (beat)
              They ve sold a half-dozen pieces
            already. The rest will be gone
            before the show is over. The
              gallery takes a commission off
            the top. I told them to send the
            rest to you.

                            MR. SMYTHE
                        (very surprised)
            To me? My dear young lady,
            whatever for?

                            CATHY
            For Kristopher, of course...
            he ll need money for paints...
              canvas... rent. .

                            MR. SMYTHE
                        (bemused)
            But Kristopher is dead.

                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                      49.
51 CONTINUED: (2) 51

                            CATHY
            So you don t want the money?

                            MR. SMYTHE
            You mustn t put words in my mouth
            now. There s always... ah...
            cemetary upkeep.
                        (clears his throat)
            As long as I m here... I wonder
            if you would mind terribly
              introducing me to the proprietor
            of this establishment?

Cathy cocks her head, and gives him an inquiring look.

                            CATHY
            Just in case, say, some more work
            by Kristopher Gentian should
            happen to turn up?

Smythe is absolutely unflappable, but there is perhaps the
tiniest hint of a twinkle in his eye as he replies.

                            MR. SMYTHE
            Well, I daresay... you can never
            tell.

They look at each other for a long beat. Then Cathy SMILES
BROADLY, links arms with Smythe, and leads him through the
crowd to do the introductions.

52 EXT. TRENDY GALLERY - NIGHT 52


Jenny and Cathy are the last to leave. They say their
goodbyes on the sidewalk in front of the gallery as the
lights begin to go off behind them.

                            JENNY -
            It went great. Don t you think
            it went great? I didn t know they
            made artists like Kristopher any
            more.

                            CATHY
            They don t...

Jenny hails a TAXI. It brakes to a stop.

            No. I feel like walking. The
              night s so lovely...
                        (hugs goodbye)
            Thanks for everything..

                            JENNY
            You take care now.

Jenny climbs into the cab. Cathy watches her drive off,
then starts down the street with a dreamy smile on her
face. But she hasn t gotten more than a few feet when the
gallery owner pops out of the front door, carrying a large
painting carefully wrapped in cloth..

                                GALLERY OWNER
            Oh, Cathy darling, I was so afraid
            you d gone... here...

He thrusts the painting at her. She s baffled.

                            CATHY
            What s this?

                            GALLERY OWNER
            Well, I couldn t say for certain,
            but whatever it is, it s yours.
            It turned up when  we were rooting
            about in that dreadful
              warehouse... way in back, all
            sealed up, but it has your name
            on it, see?
                          (he shows her)
            I put it aside for you.

                            GALLERY OWNER (Cont d)
            Did you know the artist when he
            was alive? Oh, well, you must
            have, of course, never mind.
            Enjoy.

He hurries back inside the gallery and leaves Cathy
standing on under a streetlight, holding the canvas. Off
her mystified expression, we

53 INT. - VINCENT S CHAMBER NIGHT 53

ANGLE ON CATHERINE AND VINCENT

as they stand side-by-side regarding the gift, now
unwrapped. We should see the canvas in the foreground, but
only the back of it, not the painting itself.

                            CATHY
            He had his sketch of me to work
            from, I suppose... but he must
            have painted you from memory...
              astonishing, isn t it?

                            VINCENT
            You might even say... magical...

                            CATHY
                        (smiles)
            Now you re starting to sound like
              Kristopher.

                            VINCENT
            Am I?

The camera begins to MOVE SLOWLY AROUND as Vincent reaches
out gently to touch the painting. He SMILES a strange,
enigmatic half-smile. Cathy notices.

                            CATHY
            What s that smile for?

                            VINCENT

            This canvas...

THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO MOVE as Cathy puts a finger to
Vincent s lips to quiet him.

            Don t say it... I have to hold
            on to some of my certainties.
            Don t I?

on the painting as we HEAR:

                                  KRISTOPHER (V.O.)
            We shall lay our hands upon the
              basilisk, and see the jewel in
            the toad s head. Champing his
            gilded oats, the hippogriff will
            stand in our stalls, and over our
            heads will float the blue bird,
              singing of beautiful and
            impossible things, of things that
            are lovely and that never happen,
            of things that are not and that
            should be.

                                                          FADE OUT

                                      THE END
