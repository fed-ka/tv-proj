      Father and son finish breakfast.  The car HONKS outside. 

      ED LANE (30s), shovels in his food.  He's powerfully built, a 
      handsome man, outgoing, competitive.  A good guy who's worked 
      hard to get where he is.  An alpha male who's not afraid to 
      let the rest of the world know it.

                                  ED 
                    I gotta go.  That's my ride.

      He sneaks the last sausage off his son's plate. 

      CLARK (13) is fine-boned, shaggy-haired, and bespectacled, in 
      the Harry Potter vein.

      Clark retaliates.  Snatches his dad's last piece of toast.  
      Both enjoying the game.

                                  SOPHIE 
                    I don't understand.  You knew about 
                    this.  

      SOPHIE, 36, is fair-haired, Polish, petite, and fiery.  A 
      strong woman, but just a little worn down living the cop's 
      wife life of constant compromise.

                                  ED
                    Tell your folks I really wish I 
                    could.  But I don't have a choice 
                    here.  It's the thing for Barney.  
                    His retirement.

      Clark makes himself scarce.

                                  SOPHIE
                    Jakub and Dorota are flying in, Dad 
                    wants to show you off a little.  
                    Clark's quartet is going to play-- 

      In the LIVING ROOM:  Clark starts sawing out SCALES on his 
      CELLO.

                      Anniversaries happen every year.  
                    That's what they're for.  This is a

                    not something I can miss.

      OMITTED INCORPORATED INTO SC. 788


      A subway train, packed shoulder-to-shoulder, on an ordinary 
      early morning rush hour.  

      People read, doze, stare into space, dulled by early morning 
      routine.  All except one MIDDLE-AGED MAN, fair-haired, 50s.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                            Flashpoint Pilot -  1/31/08  7A.

      He's alert, edgy.  Shifts around a lot.  Like he's 
      uncomfortable.  Or in a hurry.

      It's the Gunman - GORAN TOMASIC.                                              Flashpoint Pilot -  1/31/08  8.



      Commuters swarm off the train, folding their newspapers.  
      Office workers line up for coffees in a bustling plaza.  
      Check messages on their cell phones.  Order toasted bagels.  

      We pick out our Man, amongst them.  He's steps onto an 
      escalator and is swept upwards in the stream of people.


      A MAINTENANCE WOMAN, 50s, stops at a maintenance closet.  
      This is Goran's wife, MARTA.  

      She unlocks the closet.  Pulls out a cleaning trolley.  Shuts 
      the door.  Turns around-- Goran stands in front of her.

      She freezes.

                                  MARTA

      Off the woman, terrified.                                              Flashpoint Pilot -  1/31/08  9.



        A SHAGGY-HAIRED MAN strides down an airport hallway.  

      He's lean, blond, boyishly good-looking.  Carrying a worn 
      khaki duffel bag and a grim expression.  


      Parker, Ed, Roland, Spike, and Wordsworth do the walk and

      He raises the gun, lips pressed in fury.  

      He SHOOTS HER.  

      Her body JERKS FORWARD.  She SCREAMS, stumbles, falls. 

      He strides towards her.

                                  GORAN (CONT D)
                    Kurva.  [Bitch.]

                                  MARTA
                    Goran...

      He AIMS AT HER HEAD... hesitates.  Everything's gone still.

      He notices the people around him, crouched, hiding, a few 
      whispering into cell phones.  Someone covertly holds up a 
      CELL PHONE CAMERA.

      He lowers his weapon, trembling, uncertain.

      He stuffs the gun into his belt and hurries away.


      Parker finishes briefing the team -- Ed, Jules, Roland, *
      Wordsworth, Spike, Shakes and Carl.

      The room's filled with maps, aerial photos, whiteboards.  An 
      overhead projector illuminates a TACTICAL ENTRY PLAN behind 
      Parker.

                    line-up:  Number eight, on  D-D's, 
                    Spike. 

      Spike makes an explosion noise, like a kid in a classroom.

      A crowded elevator, filled with Latte-clutching office 
      workers.

      The doors slide open to reveal an UNHOLY APPARITION. 

      Ed.  Towering above them.  In full battle gear.  Helmet, 
        bullet-proof vest and high-powered rifle.

      He steps into the elevator.  The workers nervously make room.

                                  ED
                    Hit eight for me?  Thanks.

      Ed winks at a young woman.  She blushes.

      The doors close.  


      Ed's POV, still distorted:

      The Inspector escorts Ed through the foyer.

                                  INSPECTOR STAINTON 
                    You're sequestered.  No talking.  
                    Alright?  

      Through a crowd of staring office workers.  


      Ed sits alone in the SRU station's empty conference room.  

      Slumped in a chair.  Surrounded by duty rosters, tactical 
      diagrams drawn on whiteboards. 

      His phone rings.  He doesn't hear it.


      Sophie, in a pastry chef's apron, makes a phone call.  She 
      twists the curly wire, concerned.  

      High on a shelf, a SMALL TV plays the news: RUSH HOUR HOSTAGE 
      DRAMA. 

      No reply.  She hangs up.  Exhales.  At a loss.


      The door opens.  Ed starts.

      BLAIR KOWALSKI, 40s, enters with a UNIFORM COP.

      Kowalski's serious - bordering on dour, wears a sweater.  

      The cop throws large, CLEAR PLASTIC BAGS on the table.

                                  KOWALSKI

      Ed does.  The cop takes off Ed's utility vest and puts it 
      carefully into a bag.

                    Boots and socks.

      Ed hands them over, numbly.

                    Pants.

      The cop bags them.

      Ed stands there, stripped to his underwear.  His impressive 
      physique exposed.

      Kowalski tosses Ed his civilian clothes and cell phone.  He 
      pulls on a pair of jeans and a white T-shirt.  Kowalski bags 
      his uniform.

      LETHAL.

                    Just about.  Were you aware that 
                    the suspect's son was at the scene?

                    Good.  We'll see you at the 
                    inquest.

      Kowalski leaves, accompanied by the Uniform carrying the 
      BAGGED EVIDENCE.

      Ed goes to stand.  He wants out of there.

                                  MCANDREW
                    Hang on.  Someone else you gotta *

      Ed sits.  Drained.

        A HAUNTINGLY BEAUTIFUL MELODY begins on a violin, echoing his 
      mood...


      ...and the rest of the STRING QUARTET joins in, Clark at the 
      cello.

      Clark's cell phone VIBRATES discreetly.

      He glances at it, gives his friends a "keep going" gesture, 
      and flips it open.

                          (quietly)
                    Hey Mum.

      He listens.

      Still listening, he rises, leans his cello on the chair, and 
      walks slowly to the window.

      Keeps listening.  Troubled.


      Jules slams ammunition into a GLOCK.  *

      She thrusts some NIGHT-GOGGLES at him and opens the CQB.

                                  SAM
                    Live ammo?

      She nudges him in.

      She locks the door.


      Sam wears the goggles flipped up.  Surveys a mocked-up 
      apartment.  Open doors lead to a warren of rooms.

                                                                INTERCUT:


      Jules watches Sam on various MONITORS.  There s a set of *
      controls in front of her.  

      As she presses buttons, TARGETS pop from the FLOOR and WALLS.

      Sam fires instinctively at CUTOUT BAD GUYS.  Rolling and 
      spinning.  Clearing rooms. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                            Flashpoint Pilot -  1/31/08  55.

                    OK.  Let s see how you do against 
                    Granny.

      She taps more buttons.  Several targets pop at once.

      BLAM-BLAM!

      Then -- 

      An OLD-LADY CUTOUT.

      Sam swings the Glock at her.  Holds his fire.  Keeps moving.

      Jules purses her lips.  Hits a switch.*

      The LIGHTS GO OUT on Sam.

                                  JULES (CONT D)*
                    Good night.

      Sam flicks the night-goggles on.  EVERYTHING GOES GREEN.  
      Jules s hand hovers over the controls.  She watches him move *
      through the room...

      Then unleashes FIVE TARGETS on all sides.

      BLAM! BLAM!

      He avoids a WOMAN & BABY.

        BLAM-BLAM-BLAM!!

      The lights flick on.  Sam flips up the goggles, breathing 
      hard.  Wipes sweat.  Silence.

      Then--

      A target drops from the CEILING.

      Sam, lightning-fast, shoots straight up.  Nails it.

      Jules scowls.  Shit.*


      Jules re-enters.  Sam s grinning like a kid.*

                                  SAM
                    Cool.  What else you got?

                    You know where to find me.  Not

      And she's out.

      Ed stares straight ahead, his smile fading. 


      Ed's on the shooting range with a RIFLE.  Alone.  Wearing 
      earmuffs.

      SPENT SHELLS litter the floor.  

      Ed lets off shot after shot.  

      Every bullet hits dead centre, punching a perfect ragged 
      hole.  

      SMOKE fills the air.

      He goes to reload and then STARTS.  There's a hand on his 
      shoulder.  It's Wordsworth:  time to go.


      It's the retirement party.  The bar's packed with Police 
      Force types, out of uniform.  A few wear COP BALL-CAPS.

      Jules, Shakes, Wordy, Carl and Spike are digging into some *
      beer and wings. 

      Near the bar, RETIRING COMMANDER BARNEY FLETCHER (60s) holds 
      court.  He's tall, white-haired, barrel-chested, wrapping up 
      a story. 

                                  RETIRING COMMANDER 
                    Anyway.  Now the wife's got me 
                    where she wants me.  Let's just 
                    hope the Stockholm Syndrome kicks 
                    in fast.

      Laughs.

      The bar door swings open.  Ed steps in.  He tries to sneak 
      around the side but The Retiring Commander spots him.

                      outstanding reason for being late.

      Ed takes in the joke, and makes his way through the bar.  

      A cop picks up his beer and thumps it on the table.  Another 
      joins in.  Then another, until there's a barful of cops 
      thudding bottles and glasses on tables.

      Ed makes an awkward victory gesture.

      The Retiring Commander holds his glass up to Ed.  The 
      thumping stops.  All the cops lift their glasses.

                                  RETIRING COMMANDER (CONT'D)
                          (quiet)
                    Good job, son. 

      They drink to Ed.

      Ed sits with his teammates, embarrassed.

      The Retiring Commander tips his glass to Commander Holleran, 
      who stands nearby with Sam.

                                  RETIRING COMMANDER (CONT'D)

                    hands.  I'm done.  As you were.

      APPLAUSE.  Music and TV's blare as the noise level rises.   

      Commander Holleran approaches the table with Sam.

                                  COMMANDER HOLLERAN

                    Hey, Katie.

      Jules blinks at this unexpected informality. *

                                  JULES*
                    Hey, ah... "Sammy."

      Awkward pause.  Ed keeps his eyes steady on Sam.  Then Shakes 
      eagerly pulls over a chair.

                                  SHAKES
                    Sam.  Have a seat.

      Sam sits.  Conversations resume around the table.  Shakes is 
      star-struck but tries to play it cool.

                                  SHAKES (CONT'D)
                          (to Sam, confidentially)
                    So.  How many Al-Qaedas you guys 
                    take out?  

                                  SAM
                    What.  You mean like, to dinner?

                                  SHAKES
                    Come on.  You guys were there.  
                      Aghanistan.
                          (looking around, under his 
                            breath)
                    Haiti, Rwanda.

                                  SAM
                    I'd tell you.  But then I'd have to 
                    kill you.

                                  SHAKES 
                    Oh right.  Yeah.  Awesome.

      Meanwhile:

      Wordsworth tips his CHICKEN BONES into a TUPPERWARE 
      CONTAINER.

      What?  Why?  Yeah, how many.

                      WORDSWORTH*SPIKE*
      It's this thing.  Shel said.  Like, seven.
      We're not allowed to make any 
      garbage.

                        ROLAND*SHAKES *
      What?!Do it.

                  WORDSWORTH *SPIKE*
      Yeah.  Kind of a pain in the What?
      ass, eh?  But she says we

                        ROLAND*SHAKES*
      You can't throw anything out.  Come on, do it.
      What about--

                  WORDSWORTH *SPIKE*
      Yeah, that's what I said.  Naw.
      Shel, I got two words for 
      you.  'Toilet' and 'Paper'.

                    OK.

      Spike does a hilarious imitation of a guy getting tased again 
      and again. 

                                  SPIKE (CONT'D)
                    Don't get up!  Okay I won't get up.  
                    I'll tase you again you get up! 
                    Okay I won't get up!  Bzzzzt!  You 
                    got up!

      UNDER THE TABLE:  Jules puts her HAND on Ed's KNEE.*

      They crack up.

      Meanwhile Ed catches an image on TV: a recap of the incident. 

      Grainy footage of the GUNMAN holding the HOSTAGE.  

      A PHOTO of Goran's family in happier times: his wife, their 
      boy...  

      Camera pushes in on the SON.  Up close.

      Ed watches.  Expressionless.

      Jules sneaks a look at him, still touching his knee.  No *
      response.

      She pulls her hand away. 

      ED'S POV is distorted.  He's hearing only snatches of 
        conversation...

                                  WORDSWORTH
                    ...guy was so loaded, taking seven 
                    tases like that?

                                  SHAKES 
                    I could take seven.

                                  SPIKE 
                    Shut up you could not.

                                  ROLAND
                    I'll give you seven.

      Ed leaves the table.  Sam's eyes follow him.


      Ed splashes cold water on his face.  

      His hands are shaking.  He steadies them on the edge of the 
      sink.

      Ed hunches there, face dripping.  Then--

                                  SAM (O.S)
                    'S messed up, eh?




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                            Flashpoint Pilot -  1/31/08  63.

      CONTINUED:6565

      Ed starts.  Looks at Sam in the mirror.

      Sam's hands are in his pockets.  This isn't easy but he keeps 
      it light.

                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                    Day starts out normal and then the *
                    shit hits and somehow you're *
                    supposed to get back to the normal 
                    again.  

      Ed blinks.  That lands in him.

      Sam sees that.

      Then --

                                  ED
                    Do I know you?

      Sam smiles.  Turns to go.  Then--

                                  SAM
                    You'd think it'd be easier.  From 
                    500 yards away.

      They look at each other.

      Beat.

      Ed breaks away.  Turns the taps back on.

      Sam leaves.


      THE CITY MORGUE.

      Goran's SON identifies his father's body.

      He's shattered.


      JULES sits at a POKER TABLE.  Relaxes.  Like a nomad at an *
      oasis.   

                                  JULES*
                    Deal, Denis.                                              Flashpoint Pilot -  1/31/08  64.



      Sam's settled into his motel.  On a bureau:

      The PHOTO of Sam's father with his pearl grips, in army 
      uniform.

      The COLT beside it...

      Balls of YARN...

      Pan down to Sam.

      He's sitting in an armchair.  Thoughtful.  Busy doing 
      something.  

      Reveal: he's KNITTING.


      Ed enters his darkened home.

      The house is absolutely still.  A clock ticks quietly.  The 
      fridge hums.  Nothing moves.

      He drops his duffel bag on the floor.  Goes to the living 
      room.

      The TV flickers silent images.

      Ed, bathed in blue light, raises his hand to his face.

      It's SHAKING.

      His breath comes faster.

      The shakes take over his body.  A single, ragged gasp twists 
      itself free.  

                                  CLARK (O.S.)
                    Dad.

      Clark is at the bottom of the stairs.  He walks cautiously 
      toward Ed.  Ed struggles to control himself.

      Next thing, he's got his ARMS WRAPPED TIGHTLY around his son.  

      Clark's at a loss: they don't do hugs much.  In fact, this is 
      a first.  This is a father he's never met.






                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                            Flashpoint Pilot -  1/31/08  65.

                          (quietly)
                    Dad?

      Sophie has come quietly down the stairs, unseen.  

      She looks at Ed with concern.  Hesitates, about to 
      approach... Then decides to give them their space.  

      She walks quietly back up.

      Clark returns his father's hug.  

      They stand in the middle of the shadowy room.

                                                              FADE OUT.
