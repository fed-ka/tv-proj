                                            ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      INT. ALLISON S CAR - NIGHT11

      The TIP of an EYELINER PENCIL presses down on the pale skin 
      of Lydia s forearm where the mark left by the mysterious Girl 
      has begun to fade.

      With Allison driving, Lydia finishes going over the bruise. 
      She raises her arm to Allison s, connecting the strangely 
      patterned contusions into an odd SYMBOL.

                                  LYDIA
                    I don t know. Doesn t look like 
                    much to me.

                                    ALLISON
                    It s a pattern. It means something.

                                  LYDIA
                    You really think Scott s going to 
                    know what it is?

                                    ALLISON
                    No. But he might know someone who 
                    does.

                                  LYDIA
                    How are you so sure it means 
                    anything at all?

                                    ALLISON
                    Because that girl wasn t just 
                    looking for Scott. It s like she 
                    needed to find him. Like she had 
                    to. And that means something.

      Speedometer needle rising, Allison sends the car racing down 
      the dark roads of Beacon Hills.

      EXT. SUBURBAN STREET/SIDEWALK - NIGHT22

      Hurrying along the sidewalk of a suburban neighborhood, 
      Stiles glances over to Scott.

                                  STILES
                    What?              TEEN WOLF "CHAOS RISING"EP#302GOLDENROD5/7/132.

                                  SCOTT
                    What do you mean what?

                                  STILES
                    I mean what. And you know what. 

                                  SCOTT
                    What what?

                                  STILES
                    That look you were giving.

                                  SCOTT
                    I wasn t giving a look.

                                  STILES
                    Oh, there was a distinct look.

                                  SCOTT
                    What look?

                                  STILES
                    The one that says the last thing 
                    you feel like doing is going to a 
                    party.

                                  SCOTT
                    It s not that. It just feels a 
                    little weird going to a different 
                    high school s party.

                                  STILES
                    One drink, you ll be fine. I went 
                    to nursery school with this girl. 
                    She promised to introduce us to all 
                    of her friends. So no Allison, no 
                    Lydia. We re moving on.

      Scott glances to his phone seeing a MISSED CALL from Allison. 
      But he slips the phone back into his pocket.

                                  SCOTT
                    You re right.

                                  STILES
                    That s right I m right.

                                  SCOTT
                    Moving on.

                                  STILES
                    Onward and upward.              TEEN WOLF "CHAOS RISING"EP#302GOLDENROD5/7/133.

                                  SCOTT
                    Let s do this.

                                  STILES
                    That s what I m talking about.

      They turn down a walkway to the door of an upscale house.

                                  SCOTT
                    How s my breath?

                                  STILES
                    I m not smelling your breath.

                                  SCOTT
                    Do you have any gum?

                                  STILES
                    No gum. You re fine.

                                  SCOTT
                    Can you at least tell me what kind 
                    of party it is?

      INT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT33

      A beautiful but slightly inebriated girl named HEATHER raises 
      a red cup to several others held by her friends.

                                    HEATHER
                    It s my birthday!

      The girls HOLLER in approval and everyone drinks. Emptying 
      her cup, Heather pulls her friend, Danielle, to her side.

                                    HEATHER (CONT D)
                    Tonight.

                                  DANIELLE
                    Really tonight? For real? You know 
                    your first time is usually sort of 
                    gross and kind of hurts.

                                    HEATHER
                    Fine with me.

                                  DANIELLE
                    No romance? No waiting to fall in 
                    love?

                                    HEATHER
                    Are you kidding? When I fall in 
                    love I want to be good at it.              TEEN WOLF "CHAOS RISING"EP#302GOLDENROD5/7/134.

                                  DANIELLE
                    Oh lord. You at least got a target 
                    of opportunity?

      Glancing past her, Heather smiles wide.

                                    HEATHER
                    Stiles!

      Heads turn to Stiles and Scott who have wandered inside. 
      Throwing her arms around Stiles, Heather lands a kiss right 
      on his lips.

                                    HEATHER (CONT D)
                    So happy you made it. Come help me 
                    pick out a bottle of wine.

      Shocked by the kiss, Stiles glances to Scott who gives him an 
      encouraging nod. As Heather draws Stiles away, Scott s phone *
      buzzes. Another MESSAGE from Allison.

      INT. PARTY HOUSE/WINE CELLAR - NIGHT44

      Pulling Stiles by the hand, Heather descends the stairs to 
      the wine cellar.

                                  STILES
                    You remember when we were little 
                    and we used to come down here to--

      She kisses him again. Sensual this time. Hands gliding down 
      his chest to his belt.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Yeah, we never did that.            TEEN WOLF "CHAOS RISING"EP#302GOLDENROD5/7/134A.

                                    HEATHER
                    Stiles, I just turned seventeen and 
                    you know what I want for my 
                    birthday? To not be a seventeen 
                    year-old virgin.

      She kicks off her high heels, sending them into the shadows. 
      Moving in to kiss him again, she pauses, noticing the excited 
      yet fearful expression on his face.

                                    HEATHER (CONT D)
                    You haven t done it either.

                                  STILES
                    Turned seventeen? Not yet, no.              TEEN WOLF "CHAOS RISING"EP#302GOLDENROD5/7/135.

                                    HEATHER
                    Stiles?

                                  STILES
                    Maybe that other thing too.

                                    HEATHER
                    Do you want to? I mean, are you 
                    okay with it?

                                  STILES
                    I believe I am okay with it. Very 
                    okay with it. Very, very--

      She kisses him again, fingers reaching to unbuckle his belt. 
      But he grabs her hands.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Sorry, but I don t have any--I ve 
                    got no--

                                    HEATHER
                    My brother has some. Upstairs 
                    bathroom. Go.

                                  STILES
                    Going.

      Stiles whirls around, nearly running right into a wine rack. 
      He ducks around it and soars up the stairs.

      EXT. SUBURBAN STREET/SIDEWALK - NIGHT55

      Stepping away from the house, Scott hurries to the sidewalk 
      where he finds Allison waiting under a streetlight. But he 
      slows when he notices Lydia as well.

                                  SCOTT
                    This isn t the talk we were going 
                    to have, is it?

      Allison shakes her head. Then pulls up her sleeve to reveal 
      the mark on her arm.

      INT. PARTY HOUSE/BATHROOM - NIGHT66

      Stiles whips open the bathroom s medicine cabinet and 
      searches the contents. Nothing. He yanks open a drawer and--

                                  STILES
                    Thank you, God.

      He pulls out a BOX OF CONDOMS.               TEEN WOLF "CHAOS RISING"EP#302GOLDENROD5/7/136.

        CONTINUED:66

      But then he notices they re labeled XXL. A look of concern 
      crosses his face as he slowly peers down at himself.

      INT. PARTY HOUSE/WINE CELLAR - NIGHT77

      Bare feet stepping across the cellar floor, Heather pulls out 
      a bottle of wine to glance at its label. She pushes it back 
      into its slot and reaches for another when--

      BOTTLES CLINK against each other. Almost like the room had 
      been shaken by the lightest tremor from an earthquake.

      Heather glances about, eyeing the shadows, the dim light from 
      the stairs.

                                    HEATHER
                    Stiles?

      A ROW OF BOTTLES rumble, sides knocking against each other. 
      Heather s eyes dart from row to row, landing on one bottle. 

      Which slowly begins to turn. 

      Breath caught, Heather watches the bottle make a slow and 
      ominous rotation as if someone were twisting it around from 
      the other side until--

      The bottle PUSHES out of the rack, CRASHING to the floor in a 
      puddle of wine and glass shards.

      Heather flinches back with a surprised gasp. Then holds still 
      in the silence, trying to peer into the shadows to find 
      whoever s responsible.

                                    HEATHER (CONT D)
                    Okay, that s not funny.

      Behind her, a BOTTLE hurtles out of its rack and SMASHES to 
      the floor next to the first. Heather jumps back as DROPLETS 
      of RED WINE SPLATTER her arms.

      Another bottle CRASHES DOWN. One FLIES OFF its shelf 
      EXPLODING against the opposite rack.

      Hands up to shield herself, Heather whirls around, bare feet 
      stepping into BROKEN GLASS. As she CRIES OUT in pain, another 
      bottle EXPLODES to the floor.

      She stumbles across the SHARDS, blood mixing with wine. Her 
      back hits the wall as she s literally hemmed in by smashing 
      bottles.

      And then it stops.              TEEN WOLF "CHAOS RISING"EP#302GOLDENROD5/7/137.

        CONTINUED:77

      Shaking, tears running down her cheeks from both fear and 
      pain, Heather does not notice she s backed herself right 
      underneath a WINDOW.

      Hearing a CREAK of metal, Heather gazes up to find the window 
      opening above her as--she lifts right off the floor. With a 
      MUFFLED SCREAM, her bloodied feet are dragged up, kicking 
      against the wall.

      FOOTSTEPS pound down the stairs, Stiles charging in. But he 
      looks about in confusion.

      Strangely, the cellar appears completely untouched. No broken 
      bottles, no spilled wine, and no sign of the birthday girl.

                                  STILES
                    Heather?

      He turns, peering about. Never noticing the window behind him 
      slowly closing shut.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. DEREK S LOFT - DAY88

      Sunlight spills in through the windows of a bare, stone-laden 
      loft. Isaac passes through the light, pacing nervously, while 
      Derek sits patiently at a work table.

                                  ISAAC
                    I m starting to not like this idea. 
                    It sounds dangerous. I definitely 
                    don t like it. And I definitely 
                    don t like him.

                                  DEREK
                    You ll be fine.

                                  ISAAC
                    Why does it have to be him?

                                  DEREK
                    He knows how to do it. I don t. 
                    It d be more dangerous if I tried 
                    it myself.

                                  ISAAC
                    You know Scott doesn t trust him.

                    Do you trust me?

                                  ISAAC
                    Yeah. But I still don t like him.

                                  DEREK
                    No one likes him.

      THE STEEL DOOR of Derek s loft slides open to reveal the man 
      they re talking about. Peter Hale.

                                  PETER
                    Boys, just an F-Y-I. Yes, coming 
                    back from the dead left my 
                    abilities somewhat impaired, but 
                    the hearing? Still works. So I hope 
                    you re comfortable saying whatever 
                    it is you re feeling straight to my 
                    face.

                                  DEREK
                    We don t like you. Now shut up and 
                    help us.

                                  PETER
                    Fair enough.

      Peter snaps open his hand, CLAWS UNSHEATHED.

      MOMENTS LATER - Isaac sits in a chair, nervously gripping the 
      arm rests. He flinches as Peter delicately touches his claws 
      to the nape of his neck. 

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    Relax. I ll get more out of you if 
                    you re calm.

      Looking nervous as well, Derek watches Peter gently feel for 
      the right placement of his claws on Isaac s neck.

                                  ISAAC
                    How do you know how to do this?

                                  PETER
                    It s an old ritual. Used mostly by 
                    Alphas since it s a skill that 
                    requires quite a bit of practice. 
                    One little slip and you could 
                    paralyze someone. Or kill them.              TEEN WOLF "CHAOS RISING"EP#302GOLDENROD5/7/139.

                    Wait, does that mean--

      But Peter JAMS his claws in. Isaac s head jerks up in shock, 
      the world suddenly spinning around him. Both of their eyes 
      begin to GLOW, Isaac s turning a fiery YELLOW while Peter s 
      suffuse with a brilliant BLUE.

      Derek watches Peter s head wrench to the side, eyes moving 
      about as if seeing something--

      INT. ABANDONED BANK/VAULT - NIGHT - FLASHBACK99

      A small shaft of light slips into the vault illuminating two 
      sleeping teenagers. Just silhouettes in the darkness. 

      Figures rush in suddenly, hands reaching for them--

      Isaac jerks up in his chair as Peter struggles to keep his 
      grip on him. Derek starts forward to intervene.

                    Wait. I see them.

      INT. ABANDONED BANK/VAULT/CORRIDOR - NIGHT - FLASHBACK1111

      Hands wrap around the two teenagers, dragging them to their 
      feet. RED ALPHA EYES flare in the darkness amid a series of 
      confusing images. 

      The blind Alpha known as Deucalion steps into the light. Boyd 
      shouts, trying to break free of Ennis s arms pulling him 
      back. 

      Deucalion turns sharply, attention grabbed by SOMEONE 
      reflected over a metallic surface.

      Isaac. 

      Peering through the open vault door, he spins to run. But 
      hands grab at him, dragging him down and--            TEEN WOLF "CHAOS RISING"EP#302GOLDENROD5/7/1310.

      Peter yanks his hand free of Isaac s neck. He staggers to his 
      feet, breathless. Isaac dips forward as if to pass out, but 
      Derek grabs him, pulling him back against the chair.

                    What did you see?

                                  PETER
                    Not much. It was confusing. Vague 
                    images, phrases--

                                  DEREK

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL/UNDERPASS - DAY1313

      In the underpass leading to the athletics field, Lydia and 
      Allison hold their arms together, forming the complete symbol 
      on their skin. Derek stands before them while Scott and 
      Stiles look on at his sides.

      Derek raises his eyes to meet Allison s. Neither of them 
      blink, glaring at each other.

                    Hey, no one died. There might have 
                    been some maiming. A little

      turns too late to see their faces. They seem somehow similar.

      Taking the quarter, Coach returns to his desk. He grabs his

      Ethan. Danny smiles. And walks into a cart of books.

      While Lydia shakes her head at him, Allison returns to her 
      book. She pauses, however, noticing Lydia s COFFEE CUP. She 
      slowly turns it around to view the coffee company s logo.

      ICE pours into a steel tub filled with water, the kind of tub 
      typically used to bathe animals. Dr. Deaton approaches to

      then gives them a nod.

      Isaac BURSTS UP from the icy water, GASPING through his fangs 
      as his body convulses from the cold.

      Derek and Scott push Isaac beneath the swirling ice, 
      struggling to keep him submerged while Stiles clutches at his 
      ankles. Isaac s body shudders, jerking upward.

      Isaac s eyes snap open, GLOWING YELLOW. Strangled gasps come 
      from his throat. But then, finally, his body relaxes. Breath 
      slowing, he slips back amid the ice and closes his eyes.

      He tenses, rising up from the water. Derek and Scott gently 
      press him back, but he begins to struggle.

      But he stops at a turn. His hearing focuses on a VOICE, low 
      and distinct.

      A hand reaches up to grasp the CHAINS wrapped around the 
      bank s entrance doors. Allison gives a yank, but it s locked 
      tight. She examines the padlock. Then lets it drop.

      Slowly retreating back from the ominous building, Allison s 
      gaze falls on the image that brought her here. The bank s 
      LOGO, a decal on the glass doors.

      Exactly the same as the pattern left on her and Lydia s arm.

      When she finally turns to hurry to her car, something else 
      appears just behind the logo. A PAIR OF GLOWING RED EYES 
      watching her car roar off into the night.

      Shaking and weak, Isaac pulls the towel tightly around him

                    they siphoned all of the cash up 
                    through that one little shaft in

                    Oh really, tough guy? Make a fist.

      Derek holds out his clenched fist. Stiles puts one hand on 
      Derek s elbow and the other a few inches from his fist.

      Derek s eyes on him, waiting.

                    What about you?

      Scott peers down at the bank vault circled on the blueprint.

      In the shadowy, barely lit vault, Boyd paces, unable to stand 
      still as time ticks away. Past him, sits an unfamiliar face. 
      A young woman with her knees pulled close to her chest.

      The other girl.

      INT. ABANDONED BANK/CORRIDOR - NIGHT3535

      Carefully moving around a corner, Allison peers about the 
      cavernous bank. She continues on, glancing back with every 
      few steps. But she stops short, listening...

      From somewhere in the building comes the sound of WATER 
      DRIPPING. Swallowing her fear, she starts forward again and--

      SOMEONE HURTLES OUT OF THE SHADOWS.

      Reflexes kicking in, Allison brings her hands up to defend 
      herself. But her ATTACKER moves just as swiftly. The blows 
      come quick, two dark shapes striking out with well-trained 
      precision until--

      Allison SLAMS against a wall, an elbow pressed to her throat. 
      She blinks in surprise at her assailant.

                                    ALLISON
                    Ms. Morrell?

      The School Guidance Counselor--looking very unlike a Guidance 
      Counselor at the moment--takes a quick glance down the 
      corridor to make sure they re alone.

                                  MS. MORRELL
                    Keep your mouth shut and listen 
                    close. You have no idea what you 
                    just stepped into. Right now, 
                    you ve got maybe twenty seconds to 
                    get your ass hidden.

                                    ALLISON
                    What are you doing--

                                  MS. MORRELL
                    There s a storage closet down the 
                    hall. Get in there. Lock the door. 
                    When you hear the fighting start,

      Morrell steps back, releasing her. Confused, Allison retreats 
      back as instructed while Morrell hurries off in the opposite 
      direction.

      INT. ABANDONED BANK/STORAGE CLOSET - NIGHT3636

      The closet door clicks open and Allison slips inside. Quickly 
      pushing it closed, she holds still when she hears--MOVEMENT. 

      Right outside the door. Several people walking quickly past.

      INT. ABANDONED BANK/CORRIDOR - NIGHT3737

      TWO BARE FEET pause in the corridor. While Ennis and 
      Deucalion continue forward, Kali glances back.

      She cocks her head and then breathes in the air, trying to 
      catch a scent. After a moment, though, she shrugs it off and 
      moves to catch up to the others.

      INT. ABANDONED BANK/STORAGE CLOSET - NIGHT3838

      Pressed against the wall, Allison holds still while her foot 
      rests atop a spilled bottle of AMMONIA, liquid spreading 
      across the floor.

      Inching back, she reaches out to steady herself. Her hand 
      touches down on something leathery. Squinting in the dark, 
      she turns to find--

      Erica s dead and contorted face. 

      Allison sucks in a shocked breath at the sight. Paralyzed in *
      an expression of terror, Erica looks as if she must have *
      faced something truly horrifying in her last moments.*

      Hands rising to her own mouth, Allison retreats back, trying 
      not to scream as well.

      INT. DEREK S LOFT - NIGHT3939

      Stiles peers out a window at the rising moon while gnawing 
      nervously at his fingernails.

      printouts.

      EXT. ABANDONED BANK/ALLEY - NIGHT4040

      Making a cautious approach through the alley behind the rear 
      of the bank, Scott and Derek pause beneath the fire escape.

                    me.

      Derek grabs the steel rung of the fire escape and begins to 
      climb. With a last glance at the rising moon, Scott reaches 
      up to follow.

      INT. DEREK S LOFT - NIGHT4141

      At the work table, Stiles rifles through pages of information 
      on the bank, sheets falling to the floor around them.

      FADE IN:

      INT. ABANDONED BANK/VAULT - NIGHT4242

      A thin shaft of light falls over the interior stone of the 
      vault. The wall shakes with a low BOOM, something hitting it 
      from the inside. Another hit and a CRACK ripples through the 
      stone.

      With a sudden CRUNCH, a FIST SMASHES through. Stone crumbling 
      outward, Derek bursts into the dark vault. 

      Right behind him, Scott tumbles in through a dissipating 
      cloud of dust. Rising in the dark, he feels Derek s hand on 
      his chest, holding him back.

                                  DEREK
                    Boyd?

      From the opposite side of the room, a DARK SHAPE inches 
      forward. A hulking figure, its breath harsh and ragged.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    Boyd, it s me. It s Derek.

      A BUZZING snaps Scott s attention to his pocket. He fumbles 
      for his phone.

                                  SCOTT
                    Stiles, now is not a good time--

                                  STILES (V.O.)
                    Scott, you gotta  get out of there.

      INT. DEREK S LOFT - NIGHT4343

      With Peter at his side, Stiles rattles off a frantic warning.

                                  STILES
                    The walls of the vault--they re 
                    made with a mineral called 
                      hecatolite. It scatters the 
                      moonlight.

                                  SCOTT (V.O.)
                    What? What does that mean?

      INT. ABANDONED BANK/VAULT - NIGHT4444

      Derek takes a cautious step toward TWO FIGURES in the dark. 
      One is Boyd, struggling to keep the transformation at bay.            TEEN WOLF "CHAOS RISING"EP#302GOLDENROD5/7/1340.

                    We re here to get you out.

      Scott recedes back, cell phone pressed to his ear as he 
      listens to both Stiles and Peter trying to explain.

                                  STILES (V.O.)
                    The hecatolite keeps the moonlight 
                    out--they haven t felt the full 
                    moon in months--

                                  PETER (V.O.)
                    Think of it like the gladiator 
                    fights in the Roman coliseum. They 
                    used to starve the lions for three 
                    days to make them more vicious, 
                    more out-of-control.

      Scott watches the MOONLIGHT spill across the floor of the 
      vault, seeping in.

                                  PETER (V.O.)
                      Deucalion s kept them from shifting 
                    for three full moons, diminishing 
                    their tolerance to it.

                                  STILES (V.O.)
                    They re going to be stronger--

                                  PETER (V.O.)
                    More savage, more blood-hungry. 
                    They re the lions, Scott. They re 
                    the starved lions and you and Derek 
                    just stepped into the coliseum.

                                  SCOTT
                    Derek. We got a problem. Really big 
                    problem.

      But Derek is no longer moving, a look of shock spreading 
      across his face.

                    Cora?

      A dark-haired, beautiful young woman also struggling against 
      the moon steps into the light. Her name is CORA HALE.            TEEN WOLF "CHAOS RISING"EP#302GOLDENROD5/7/1341.

                    Derek, get out. Get out of here.

      Scott lowers the phone even as Stiles yells through the 
      speaker--

                                  STILES (V.O.)
                    Scott? Scott, are you there?

      His eyes focus on an odd, powdery SUBSTANCE lining the 
      baseboard against the wall of the vault.

                                  SCOTT
                    Oh damn...

      He follows the line of MOUNTAIN ASH to the vault door. It 
      lies open, moonlight seeping in.

      A SILHOUETTED WOMAN appears just past the threshold of the 
      vault. She opens her hand, letting the last bit of ash fall 
      from her palm.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    No--no, wait!

      But even as he starts forward, the barrier connects, stopping 
      him in his tracks.

      On the other side of the vault, Boyd lets loose an enraged 
      snarl, GLOWING YELLOW EYES locked on Derek. Cora s head jerks 
      up, fangs bared as the transformation takes hold.

      Claws unsheathed, Derek raises his hands to defend himself.

      INT. DEREK S LOFT - NIGHT4545

      With the cell phone held between them, Stiles and Peter 
      listen to the sounds of chaos rising inside the vault.

                                  STILES
                    Scott? Scott, are you there?

      The phone clicks off. A DIAL TONE blares back at them.

      INT. ABANDONED BANK/VAULT CORRIDOR - NIGHT4646

      Outside the vault door, Ms. Morrell wipes the remaining 
      mountain ash from her hands. She pauses, eyeing her palms.

                                  DEUCALION
                    Don t kid yourself, Marin. This

      CONTINUED:4646

      Deucalion reaches out his own hand. Reluctantly, Morrell 
      gives him her arm and leads him away, their quiet FOOTSTEPS 
      rapidly drowned out by the sounds from inside the vault. 

      LOW SNARLS rising to VICIOUS GROWLS, building to a crescendo. 
      To an all-out attack.

      INT. ABANDONED BANK/STORAGE CLOSET - NIGHT4747

      A distant CRASHING jolts Allison from her hiding spot. Moving 
      to the door, she presses her ear to it. Just as Morrell 
      predicted, she hears the sounds of fighting.

      Allison reaches for the door knob as--

      INT. ABANDONED BANK/VAULT - NIGHT4848

      Scott SLAMS to the floor, tumbling painfully. A SNARLING Boyd 
      leaps down to attack. Derek grabs him, yanking him off his 
      feet and launching him into the air.

      But then Derek lurches forward, SLASHED in the back by Cora. 
      She comes at him, swiping with razor-sharp claws until Scott 
      crashes into her, dragging her down. 

      Derek pulls Scott back to his feet.

                                  SCOTT
                    You know her?

                                  DEREK

                                  DEREK
                    Like I have a clue? I thought she 
                    was dead.

      Past them, the two werewolves--silhouetted figures with 
      GLOWING YELLOW EYES--rise for another assault.

      Catching a scent, Scott turns back in surprise to see Allison 
      standing just outside the vault door.

                                    ALLISON
                    Look out--

      Boyd DRAGS Scott off his feet, SMASHING him against the wall. 
      Derek turns to help, but Cora blocks his way, attacking with 
      renewed ferocity.            TEEN WOLF "CHAOS RISING"EP#302GOLDENROD5/7/1343.

      CONTINUED:4848

      Allison watches in horror as Boyd digs into Scott with his 
      claws, dragging him up the wall. Blood at his lips, Scott 
      cries out in agony.

      Trying to hold Cora back, Derek sees Allison approach the 
      MOUNTAIN ASH BARRIER.

                                  DEREK
                    No, don t--don t break the seal!

      But as Scott slides down against the wall, Boyd raises a 
      clawed hand for a killing strike--

                                    ALLISON
                    Boyd!

      He spins, YELLOW EYES focusing on her. Allison whips her 
      hands across the seal. The MOUNTAIN ASH swirls up into the 
      air and a break appears in the barrier.

      ROARING, Boyd charges toward her. Allison whirls back behind 
      the safety of the vault door as both Boyd and Cora hurtle out 
      of their prison, racing for freedom.

      With their FERAL GROWLS growing fainter in the distance, 
      Allison steps out from behind the door and is GRABBED by 
      Derek.

                                  SCOTT
                    Don t touch her.

      He yanks Derek s hand from her, locking eyes with him. Derek 
      shakes free of Scott s grasp, glaring at Allison.

                                  DEREK
                    What were you thinking?

      The CITY LIGHTS of Beacon Hills flicker brilliantly 
      underneath a massive full moon. 

      TWO OMINOUS SILHOUETTES slowly approach the edge of the 
      cliffside. Breathing low, fierce growls through fanged teeth, 
      Boyd and Cora turn a murderous gaze on the unwitting town
