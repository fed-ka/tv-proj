plain chapel, in virtual darkness. PHILIP II, King of Spain
bows his head low, abasing himself before his God.
T
S/I CAPTION:
scorial Palace, Spain, 1585.
Now, slowly, he raises his head. His eyes open, and we see
there the glow of a new certainty. God has spoken to him.
PHILIP

God.)

Philip walks rapidly down a long corridor that opens out
into a broader hallway, moving from the darkness of the
chapel into ever brighter light and more visible glory. On
his face the far shining gaze of a man who now knows his
mission. Silent servants press themselves to the walls as
he goes by. Through the hallway to a grand salon. COURTIERS
fall silent and bow as he passes. So into the grandest
salon of all, where his magnificent court is gathered;
among them his 12-year-old daughter, the INFANTA. As he
enters, all kneel.
His eyes scan his ministers and courtiers, all kneeling,
heads bowed before him. His gaze falls on one who wears the
plain black robes of a Jesuit priest: Robert Reston, the
face we glimpsed in the opening montage. He speaks to all.
PHILIP
(God has made his will known to
me. The time for our great
enterprise has come.)
The Jesuit looks up and his eyes too show a powerful but
disciplined satisfaction. He murmurs softly to himself.
RESTON
At last.
Cathedral bells ring out. The cheers of a crowd are heard
through the open windows.
The king passes out onto the salon's first-floor balcony.

An agitated group is gathered in this room where the
business of state is transacted. We catch glimpses of the
Queen in their midst, preparing to leave, as her ministers
try to persuade her of the seriousness of the situation:
SIR CHRISTOPHER HATTON, 30s, an ambitious courtier; LORD
HOWARD, 50s, a weathered old campaigner; and standing back
from the rest, watching from the side lines, SIR FRANCIS
WALSINGHAM, the Queen's veteran friend and adviser.
HATTON
Be warned by the atrocities in
France! God-fearing Christians
murdered by Papist cut-throats
inflamed by hatred of the truth!
HOWARD
We know the Catholics take their
orders from Spain. The Spanish
speak openly of Mary Stuart as
Queen of England in waiting.
ELIZABETH
(sharply)
Mary Stuart is a Queen cast out
by her own ungrateful nation.
HATTON
With respect, majesty - a
Catholic Queen. Your loyal
Protestant supporters don't
understand why Mary Stuart lives
under our protection, at our
expense - very considerable
expense -
ELIZABETH
Mary Stuart is my cousin. She is
our guest. And she is under our
control.
HOWARD
But while she lives, majesty, she
is a beacon that draws our
enemies' eyes and hopes.
ELIZABETH
While she lives?
HATTON
She is the poison at the heart of
England. The poison must be cut
out.

ELIZABETH
You'd have me make a martyr of
her. What is her crime?

ELIZABETH
What would you have me do? `Cut

HOWARD
We must act, majesty. Our
inaction is taken to be weakness.
ELIZABETH
If any of my people break the
law, they will be punished. Until
that day, I wish them to be let
them alone.
HATTON
Until the day they rise in
rebellion! Majesty, we have
proven reason to fear every
Catholic in the land -
ELIZABETH
Fear creates fear, sir. I will
not punish my people for their
beliefs. Only for their deeds.
am assured that the people of
England love their Queen. My
constant endeavour is to earn
that love.
The royal party enters the Cathedral. Elizabeth and
Walsingham advance into the wide empty nave, followed by
the Queen's ladies and the guards. Bess is now back in her
place among the ladies.
E
LIZABETH
Ship builders are being recruited
in Spanish ports at double wages.
The sea wall at Dover is
cracking. There's no money to
rebuild our defences. I don't
need advisers to tell me my
business.
WALSINGHAM
They care for your safety,
majesty. The threats to your
person are real.
ELIZABETH
And they know very well that if I
fall, they all come tumbling down
after me.
She goes on to the steps at the foot of the altar, and
kneels to pray. As she kneels she holds out one hand behind
her, not looking round. Bess steps forward, and taking her
hand, kneels and prays with her.

The terrier scampers ahead of Annette to its mistress, MARY
STUART, who sits embroidering a pink satin petticoat. She
is a handsome but bitter woman in her mid-thirties. Round
her stands her small retinue of three ladies and a
chaplain.
MARY
This is so pretty I'm inclined to
send it as a present to my dear
cousin Elizabeth.
She holds up the delicate work to show her ladies.
May 1 Blue Draft - p.12
MARY (CONT'D)
It is an intimate garment, of
course. But even Elizabeth must
have the occasional intimate
moment.
Annette reaches her mistress and kneels before her, holding
out the letter.
ANNETTE
My Queen.
Mary lays down her needlework and takes the letter from her
and reads it for herself.
MARY
Our friends write to give us
hope.
ANNETTE
(low)
Soon England's true believers
will rise up against the bastard
usurper Elizabeth, and slit her
throat, and throw her down to
hell.
MARY
That's enough, Annette.
(But she loves it.)
Slit her throat? Please.
ANNETTE
And when the bastard usurper is
dead, my lady will be queen.
The chaplain gives a sharp cough of warning.
The Warden of Chartley Hall, SIR AMYAS PAULET, enters the
room. He is soberly dressed, but has charming manners, and
is clearly susceptible to his handsome ward. Mary turns to
him at once with a teasing smile.
MARY
Here's my noble jailer, come to
smack my hand.
She holds out one hand to be smacked. The other hand holds
the letter out of sight.
MARY
Have I sinned again, sir?
PAULET
No, no, my lady. Unless beauty is
counted a sin.

Oh, you jailer. I don't trust

Mary signs to her ladies. One of them brings her the
embroidery, discreetly receiving in exchange the hidden
letter.
MARY
See how I pass my time in my
lonely prison.
PAULET
Charming, ma'am. Distractingly
charming.
She holds the intimate garment against her body. Paulet
seems to be too fascinated by it to notice he is being
duped.

A pistol is being loaded: a fiddly process involving a
powder horn, wadding, and an iron ball the size of a

ARMOURER (O.O.V.)
So what's it for, my young
friend? Not for shooting rabbits,
I'm guessing.
SAVAGE
We live in dangerous times.

Savage moves close as if to study the loading process. We
see the two of them talking from outside the window.
SAVAGE

The conspiracy gains strength.
Tell our master one of the circle

The Armourer nods. He hands the pistol to Savage. Savage
takes it and leaves.
Immediately after, a man enters and walks up behind the now
seated Armourer. The Armourer turns round.

Moving with speed, he seizes the Armourer's head, twists it
to one side, and snaps his neck.

Bess Throckmorton is late. She comes running through the
crowd of lesser petitioners who wait in the hope of gaining
access to the Queen. She passes Calley, the two native
Americans, and a group of sailors holding large hampers.
Raleigh is trying to persuade the doorkeeper to let him
past.

mud.
Raleigh takes out a potato beneath the Ambassador's nose.

He beckons forward the second basket, which is full of
leaves. Again Don Guerau tracks his every move. He takes
out a tobacco leaf. R

Very stimulating.
Now Don Guerau realises he's being laughed at on all sides.
He draws himself up with angry pride, wrinkling his nose.

sensitive to the smell of open
sewers.
A glare at Raleigh, a bow for the Queen, and Don Guerau
leads his Spaniards out.

With a broad smile, Raleigh gestures forward the third
basket. This one really is full of gold. He takes out a
gold coin and presents it to Elizabeth.
RALEIGH
Gold. You spend it. Very
satisfying.
Elizabeth examines the fat gold coin, with its image of
Philip of Spain. She tries not to smile.

Elizabeth drops the gold coin back into the basket.

singling out Bess.

to thank you. Without your help,
I'd still be in outer darkness.

They're listening to a young Austrian make a formal speech
of love. The AUSTRIAN AMBASSADOR stands to one side,
mouthing the words to prompt him.
The ARCHDUKE CHARLES is still a boy: sixteen years old,
slight, pale, trembling with shyness. He struggles through
his rehearsed speech.
ARCHDUKE CHARLES
Your majesty's beauty is dazzling
to my eyes. Your learning is
famed throughout Europe. I see
before me perfection in human
form. Oh, Elizabeth! How blessed
am I to stand in your fabled
presence, warmed by your
greatness as by the rays of the
sun. Oh Elizabeth! To speak your
name is to hear celestial music.
May that sweet sound guide me
through my life to come -
Elizabeth! Elizabeth! I have
travelled here, to this
illustrious court, in the hope
that our two great nations might
be joined in love. But now that I
am bathed in the radiance of your
glory, I am overwhelmed. I am
conquered. I die. Only your love,

Raleigh enters the Great Hall, trailed by Calley, as the
dinner gets under way. They join the much larger group who
simply stand and watch. Royal meals are in part a spectacle
for the court. A JESTER moves from group to group, playing
pranks on the guests.

Raleigh is now dressed in court fashion, and looks very
well; as the glances of several court ladies show. He
catches Bess's eye and they share a smile.
COURT LADY

sea battles - how do you sink an
enemy ship? You shoot holes in
its sides, I suppose.

Calley, listening, rolls his eyes.
Elizabeth, at the table with the Archduke by her side,

court ladies. Then back to the young Archduke, who has
hardly touched his food.

The Archduke's eyes open very wide. He glances at
Elizabeth, and sees on her face a conspiratorial smile.
ARCHDUKE CHARLES
(I daren't even think what I'm
really thinking.)
ELIZABETH
(You're thinking, perhaps, that
you would far rather be home.)
ARCHDUKE CHARLES

He's grateful to her, and his shy face shows it.
Raleigh is still being entertained by the court ladies.

I don't presume to raise my eyes
so high.
They both look at the Queen. She's watching Raleigh. He
bows.
BESS
It seems you've presumed after
all.
RALEIGH
It seems you're determined to
think the worst of me.
BESS
Tell me what it is you really
want.
RALEIGH
What every man wants. Money.
Fame. Love.
BESS
In that order?
RALEIGH
Each leads to the next. The money
will buy and equip ships for a
return voyage to the New World.
The success of my infant colony
there will make me famous. The
fame will bring me love.
BESS
It seems rather a long way round.
RALEIGH
There are benefits along the way.
It is something, after all, to
take a blank on the map and build
there a shining city.
BESS
Which you will no doubt name
after yourself.

RALEIGH

No doubt. B
ESS
Well, then. I am answered.
RALEIGH
May I ask a question in return?
BESS
Of course.
RALEIGH
How am I to win the Queen's
favour?
BESS
Why should I tell you that, sir?
RALEIGH
I've little enough to offer, I
know. But whatever I have to give
- ask, and it's yours.
Bess thinks for a moment.
BESS
My advice to you is, say what you
mean to say as plainly as
possible. All men flatter the
Queen in the hope of advancement.
Pay her the compliment of truth.
She gives him her hand. He kisses it.
RALEIGH
I don't even know your name.

leave. She speaks to the company.
ELIZABETH
His highness the Archduke informs
me that my charms overwhelm him.
He will retire to his private
quarters to rest.

This causes much amusement. Don Guerau sneers openly. The
Archduke rises. All rise. The Archduke bows solemnly to the
Queen, and leaves with his entourage. Elizabeth beckons to
Walsingham, and speaks low to him.
ELIZABETH
He's a sweet boy. I don't want
him hurt by your schemes.

Bess is reading to Elizabeth. Elizabeth watching her, her
mind elsewhere.
ELIZABETH
I suspect him of being a
professional charmer. Am I right?
BESS
He is certainly charming, my
lady.
ELIZABETH
There are duller professions. And
what is it he hopes to gain by
his charms?
BESS
He hopes for glory in his New
World. He dreams of building a
shining city.
ELIZABETH
Which I'm to pay for, no doubt.
(Beat)
You like him, don't you?
BESS
It's refreshing to meet a man who
looks to a world beyond the
court.
ELIZABETH
So it is. We shall let him come
again.

Dismissed? On whose orders?
She looks up at the laundress, who stands red-eyed and
snuffling, with a guard by her side.
MARY
Do stop snivelling.
ANNETTE
The Warden, my lady.
MARY
The Warden? My Warden?
As she speaks, Sir Amyas Paulet enters. Mary's voice
becomes seductive.
MARY
What have you done now, you bad
man? Sent away my laundress? How
am I to have clean clothes? Or do
you want me to go about naked?
Paulet smiles at the notion of Mary naked.
PAULET
That was not my motive, ma'am.
Much though -
(Thinking better of it)
Your laundress was found to be
carrying letters in her washing.
Not her job, I think.
MARY
How am I to send my intimate
letters?
PAULET
Through me.
MARY
And you will read them.
PAULET
With respectful admiration.
MARY
Am I to have no privacy?
PAULET
No.
Beneath the charm, steel.
MARY
You disappoint me, sir.

PAULET
The Queen orders these measures
for your protection.
MARY
The Queen! Am I not a Queen too?
What if I wish to write a love
letter? Is Elizabeth to be sent a
copy? Is she so starved of lovers
that she must feed on mine?
PAULET
The Queen grieved when your
husband died, ma'am. As she
grieved when your second husband
died. And the third. If there is
a possibility of a fourth -
MARY
Tormentor! Is that Elizabeth's
order too? That you torment and
mock me?
She turns to go, but stops before leaving the room: bitter,
haughty, not deigning to look back.
MARY
They say she's a beautiful woman.
Is she so very beautiful?
PAULET
I don't presume to comment on the
Queen's person.
MARY
She's called the virgin queen.
Why is that, sir? Can it be that
no man will have her?
Mary changes mood again, thinking it more politic to keep
the Warden under her spell. She waves Annette and the
laundress away.
MARY
My friend, forgive me. You are my
friend, are you not?
PAULET
I am your servant, ma'am, and
your admirer.

I shall send no more letters. I
shall stay here quietly, in my
prison. With you.

The same crowd of petitioners wait in vain for access to
the Queen. The same door keeper. Raleigh enters, and this
time the door keeper bows, and ushers him through the open
doors.
Over this we hear Raleigh's voice telling of his
adventures:
RALEIGH (V.O.)
It begins with a journey. You
must cross an ocean.

Elizabeth listens attentively, her eyes looking far away
into the distance, as Raleigh tells of his adventures.
RALEIGH
Can you imagine - can you feel -
what it is to cross an ocean? For
weeks you see nothing but the
horizon. All round you. Perfect,
and empty. Your ship is small -
tiny - a speck in such immensity.

Walsingham is talking to Elizabeth about matters of state.
We are on her face, and we can see that she hears nothing
of what he tells her. Her mind is all on Raleigh's voice.
RALEIGH (V.O.)
You live with fear, in the grip
of fear - fear of storms, fear of
sickness on board, fear of the
immensity. What if you never
escape? How can you escape?
There's nowhere to go. So you
must drive your fear down, deep
into your belly, and study your

hope.

Let them wait!

Go on, Mr Raleigh. You were

Elizabeth dances with Raleigh. As they dance, his voice
continues over; and Elizabeth seems to be listening to him.

Then it's a smudge, a shadow on
the far water. For a day, for
another day, the stain slowly
spreads along the horizon, and
takes form - until on the third
day you let yourself believe. You
dare to whisper the word - land!
The music ends, and the dance finishes.
Elizabeth is seated now - it's later in time. Raleigh is
speaking intently to her, and she is captivated.

Land. Life. Resurrection. The

vast unknown, out of the

The Queen lives for her people.
You will therefore forgive me,
sir, if after much thought and
prayer I decline your offer of
marriage.
The Archduke, barely able to conceal his relief, turns to
the Austrian ambassador.
ARCHDUKE CHARLES
(Can I go home now?)
Elizabeth inclines her head, trying not to smile.
ELIZABETH
(Go home, my friend. Don't be in
a hurry to grow old. Youth is so
very precious.)
Elizabeth rises and takes the Archduke's arm as they start
to leave the chamber. Bess, in her wake, finds an
opportunity to speak softly to Raleigh.

Queen's favour?

I like your immensities. Your
ocean is an image of eternity, I
think. Such great spaces make us
small. Do we discover the New
World, Mr Raleigh, or does the
New World discover us?
RALEIGH
You speak like a true explorer.
ELIZABETH
I like you, Mr Raleigh.
RALEIGH
And I like you.
She stops and turns to meet Raleigh's eyes. She's not used
to such direct replies. Bess is watching them.

You know, of course, that when I
like a man, I reward him.

And what have you to say about
it?

Then she looks ahead, and her face fills with fear.

in confusion.
ELIZABETH
No, don't stop. I like it.
Bess returns to her gentle caresses, and Elizabeth to her
thoughts.

known the simple pleasure of
being liked for myself?
BESS
I hope you believe that I like

A man who looks like a shop assistant sits grabbing a quick
lunch. He's the TORTURER. Nearby on a blood-stained bench
lies a huddled half-naked figure, trembling uncontrollably.
It's Francis Throckmorton. He's neither manacled nor
guarded. His body is so broken it's not necessary.
Walsingham enters. The torturer jumps to his feet.
Walsingham goes to Throckmorton. He gazes at him, shaking
his head. He's getting too old for this dirty business.

true?

sent an innocent man to his death. Tears rise to her eyes.

What if I was his last hope? What
if I was the one person he
thought he could trust?

He wipes away a tear from her cheek. In desperate need of
comfort, she throws herself into his arms. He holds her
close as she sobs.
RALEIGH
We're all mortal, Bess. We do
what we can.
He strokes her cheek. She meets his eyes, filled with
gratitude. She takes the hand that touches her face and
moves it to her lips. She kisses it, still holding his
eyes. He draws her back into his arms, and they kiss.
Suddenly they're kissing eagerly, greedily, their long pent-
up passion released at last.

The finest library in England. The greatest array of
scientific instruments. Part study, part laboratory, part
magician's lair, Dr Dee's house is crammed with the
evidence of his wide-ranging curiosity.
May 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 64
The magus sits at a table before an astrological chart,
while Elizabeth and Walsingham look on.
DEE
The alignment of the planets is
most unusual this year. Mars is
due to take the ascendant three
days after the anniversary of
your birth - your majesty was
born on September 7th - and I see
that twelve days before the
anniversary of your birth -
He transfers his attention to a different, astronomical
chart.
DEE
- there will be a full moon - the
moon which -
He moves back to the astrological chart.
DEE
- governs the fortunes of all
princes of the female gender.
ELIZABETH
Princes of the female gender.
DEE
I mean to say, a prince who is
also a woman.
ELIZABETH
Yes, Dr Dee. I am following you.
So what does it all mean?
D
EE
It means the rise of a great
empire, majesty. And it means
convulsions, also. The fall of an
empire.
Elizabeth listens, a faraway look in her eyes. She knows
nothing of the planets, but she feels it deep within
herself: her moment of destiny is near.
ELIZABETH
Which empire is to rise, and
which is to fall?
DEE
That I can't say. Astrology is,
as yet, more an art than a
science.
May 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 65
Walsingham has been idly examining the scientific
instruments. He speaks now as if his question is casual.
WALSINGHAM
Nothing more, Dr Dee? No more
specific calamities that we can
guard against?
ELIZABETH
He means, Will I be assassinated?
WALSINGHAM
Queens are mortal.
Dr Dee smiles as he gently contradicts him.
DEE
Elizabeth is mortal. The Queen
will never die.
ELIZABETH
You see, Francis? This is a
mystery.
(to Dee)
He has no patience with
mysteries. W
ALSINGHAM
What I don't know, I can't use.
DEE
And yet mysteries have power.
Have you not learned that?
ELIZABETH
Francis. Leave us for a moment.
Walsingham leaves. Elizabeth turns to Dr Dee. Now for a
short private moment the Queen becomes a woman.
ELIZABETH
And the private life of this
prince of the female gender, Dr
Dee? What do the stars foretell
there? Or is this too a mystery?
DEE
These are matters of state,
majesty.
ELIZABETH
Do the stars not foretell matters
of state?
DEE
For such a prediction, I must
look in a different chart.
May 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 66
He means her face. He murmurs to himself as he studies her
features, reading her character.
DEE
Wonderful... Out of such
suffering, to have forged such
strength... You will need all
your strength in days to come...
And love... So much love...
But as he looks, he finds something more that disturbs him.
DEE
But you doubt yourself, my
child... I've not seen fear in
your face before.
ELIZABETH
Have I reason to fear?
DEE
Something has weakened you...
There is danger, yes... Your
strength lies in your spirit.
Nothing else matters. There are
hard days coming. You must trust
the power of your spirit.
Elizabeth is shaken by these words. Dee turns to look out
once more at the night sky.
DEE
But I'm no prophet. I see no more
than the shadows of ghosts.
ELIZABETH
An art, not a science. I
understand.

Burton hands him the letter. Reston opens it and reads it
at speed. Then he hands it to a man we don't see.
RESTON
What do you think? There must be
clear and valid authority.
He gazes at the unseen man, waiting on his verdict.
WILLIAM (O.O.V.)
No. It won't do.
Reston nods agreement. He returns to the table and dashes
off a letter, muttering as he does so.

He completes the note and gives it to Burton.

Bess lies restlessly asleep. Suddenly she gives a start and
wakes. She stifles a scream with her hands. On the far side
of the room, sitting watching her in silence, is
Walsingham.
BESS

been a loyal servant of the
Queen. I'd never betray the
Queen, never -

But you have, my dear. And you

DANCING MASTER
Jump!
The dancing master is instructing Bess in the dance called
La Volta, watched by the Queen, her ladies and courtiers. A
trio of musicians plays a jaunty tune.
ANCING MASTER
(to Bess)
When I push like this, my lady,
give a jump into the air.
ELIZABETH
Let him throw you round, Bess.
You can trust him.
The dancing master spins Bess round and lifts her up into
the air. Her feet fly out as she spins. It's a bold, even
risqu dance, and the onlookers laugh to see it.
DANCING MASTER
And round - and round - and round
- and down!
He lowers Bess to the ground. She loves it. As the spinning
begins again, Raleigh enters.
LIZABETH

require all my ladies to learn

Raleigh watches Bess dance.

To tell you the truth, Mr
Raleigh, there are times when I'm
tired of being always in control.
RALEIGH
Nonsense.
ELIZABETH
What?
RALEIGH
You don't mean a word of it. You
eat and drink control.
ELIZABETH
Do you say so?
The exercise ends. All clap.
ELIZABETH
Bess, you must try a dance with
Mr Raleigh. He's eager to show us
his skill.
RALEIGH
No skill at all, majesty. I don't
know the steps.
ELIZABETH
Oh, it's very simple.
he goes to Bess to demonstrate, holding her by the waist.
ELIZABETH
You stand like this, with your
hands firmly clasped here - and
when she jumps, on the eighth
step, you swing her round - once,
twice, three times - and you're
back to the beginning. What could
be simpler?
DANCING MASTER
Your majesty knows the dance
better than I.
ELIZABETH
So come, Mr Raleigh. Take your

ELIZABETH
Hold her tight. I don't want her
dropped.

to the musicians)
Play!
The dance begins again. Bess jumps, and Raleigh swings her
round and round, finding the knack after an awkward start.
Elizabeth watches, smiling, nodding to the beat. She can
see the faces of the dancers; and so long as she controls
the intimacy between them, she's excited by it.
Walsingham enters and stands by her side, watching.

Mary's latest letter is now in Reston's hand. Babington and
Ramsay sit staring at Reston. This time the Jesuit is
pleased. He reads the letter aloud to the unseen man.
RESTON
`If our forces are in readiness,
both within and without the
realm, then your Queen commands
you to set the gentlemen to
work.'
May 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 71
RESTON(cont'd)
(with quiet steely
satisfaction)
I think we have it.
He hands the letter over. For the first time we see who it
is: William, now revealed as one of the conspirators.
William reads the letter for himself.
WILLIAM

This is the spark that will set
England ablaze.
Reston takes out pistols, and hands one to Ramsay, one to
Babington.

William enters, wrapped in a cloak, one hand concealed.
WILLIAM
It's me. William.

Where have you been? We haven't
seen you for days.
WILLIAM
I met up with some old friends.
WALSINGHAM
From Paris, no doubt.
WILLIAM
Yes.
WALSINGHAM
And now you've come back.
He looks up at last.
WALSINGHAM
Do you know, I can still remember
the day you were born?
He smiles, but there's sadness in his eyes.
May 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 72
WALSINGHAM
I was eleven years old. And you,
this helpless bundle. I looked at
you in your crib, with your
little wrinkled face, and I loved
you from the first. I vowed then
to look after you. I watched you
grow up with your head in the
clouds, always a dreamer. I
couldn't follow you there. And
now I've failed you, haven't I?
Forgive me if I haven't loved you
enough.
Clink. Something falls from William's hand to the floor.
His face has gone grey.
WALSINGHAM
Did you really think I didn't
know?
On the floor - a dagger.
William opens his mouth to answer, but no sound comes out.
Walsingham raps twice on his desk. The door opens, and
Agents 4 and 5 enter.
WALSINGHAM
Was it for money? At least tell
me you got a good price.
W

WALSINGHAM
What then? What would you murder
your own brother for?

kneeling, masking the figure in front of the altar - he
pulls out a pistol -

Elizabeth turns and rises to confront the assassin's gun.
Babington stares at her, hypnotised by her fearlessness.
Then he pulls the trigger.
Bang!
Elizabeth still stares at him. She's unhurt.
Babington lets out a cry of anguish, and crumples to the
ground. Elizabeth stares on into space, frozen by the
moment, magnificent.

Mary paces impatiently in her room, trailed by her little
dog. She hears the sound of bells. Joy floods her features.
Pounding feet. She turns to see Sir Amyas Paulet hurrying
towards her, through a gate in the wall.

And you, ma'am, are under arrest.
He has led up to this deliberately, and now stands smiling
at her utter confusion. The man who looked like a fool has
been playing his own game all along.
MARY
Me? What has any of this to do
with me?
Paulet makes a sign. Burton the brewer comes through the
gate: Walsingham's man after all.
P
AULET
That's the trouble with intrigue,

He takes the hollow bung out of one pocket and admires it.
PAULET
My own invention. Theatrical, but
effective. My master has every

Now she knows it's over. She begins to weep.

Walsingham has a lamp in his hand. He moves slowly along a
passage, bowed down by a sense of failure.
He directs the light of his lamp through cell bars onto a
face. The Jesuit. Reston looks back, unafraid.
WALSINGHAM
Ready to die, I see, Jesuit.
RESTON
I have done what I was sent to
do.
WALSINGHAM
Why was the gun not loaded?
Reston doesn't answer. Walsingham gazes at him a moment
longer. Then he moves the lamp along. There, shackled and
white-faced, sit Babington and Ramsay. Walsingham studies
their faces.
Walsingham carries his lamp down the passage and shines it
into the next cell. Here lies a man in chains, huddled on
the floor. He looks up as the light falls on him. William.
Walsingham looks down on the pitiful sight.
W
ALSINGHAM
What was the Jesuit sent to do?
WILLIAM
To kill the Queen. You know it.
You know everything.
WALSINGHAM
Not quite everything.
WILLIAM
I've told you all I know. Go
ahead and kill me. Take what's
left of me. I don't care any
more. All my life you've had
everything and I've had nothing.
So finish it. There's a better
world waiting for me. We'll all
be judged in the end, brother.
Even you.
Walsingham gazes down on this pitiful show of pride.

WALSINGHAM
You're no martyr. You weren't
even much of a murderer. Go back
to France. Back to your dreams.
Never let me hear of you again.
Walsingham turns away. As he goes we see what he won't show
William: that the hurt of the betrayal is almost more than
he can bear.
He goes back up the passage. As he passes Reston, the
Jesuit calls out softly.

A dismissive shrug. Clearly she does not think herself

I've done terrible things - just

Philip of Spain is a God-fearing

just cause. He sent the Jesuit to
kill a Queen. But not you.

Mary Stuart into the murder plot.

letter. He waited until she wrote
the words that sealed her guilt.
Now Elizabeth gets it.

And I ordered her execution. I
murdered God's anointed Queen.

ELIZABETH
A kiss?
He takes her in his arms, and they kiss. One kiss to hold
all that might have been, all that they both know can never
be.
When at last they part she turns away from him, head bowed,
eyes still closed, holding on to the sweet moment.
The palace is galvanised by the invasion threat. Armed men
go by at the double, passing servants hauling out trolleys
bearing valuables, as the court prepares for the worst.
Raleigh and Howard stride fast across the Guard Chamber,
the first of the sequence of great rooms. They are deep in
war talk.
Bess appears ahead, and beckons him to a secluded corner.

ALEIGH
Bess, I've been ordered to my
ship -
Bess stops his mouth with one finger.
BESS
I'll be quick. I have something
to tell you. But I ask for
nothing. Is that understood? Your
life is your own. Nothing will
change.

RALEIGH
What is this, Bess?
Two court officials hurry by. Bess lowers her voice.
BESS
I'm -
Her hand touches her waist.
RALEIGH
You're pregnant?
BESS
No one knows. My plans are made.
I shall ask the Queen for
permission to leave court. I
shall live quietly in the country
with - with my child. The Queen
must know nothing.
Raleigh stares at her, stunned. More people are passing.
This is no place for R
displays of strong feeling.
ALEIGH
Where will you go?
BESS
To my mother's house.
RALEIGH
You can't go!
BESS
I'm a ward of the Queen. I can't
court a man without her
permission. I can't marry without
her permission. As for having a
child -
Another official passes by.
RALEIGH
When were you planning to leave?
BESS
As soon as I'm allowed.
Raleigh finds himself caught in an impossible situation.
His internal struggle shows itself in the twists and jerks
of his body.
RALEIGH
Am I not to see you again? What's
to become of the child? Bess -

Hush! We've no choice. You know

RALEIGH
All I know is nothing's as it

BESS
Please listen. You once said to
me, `Whatever I have to give, ask
and it's yours.' Do you remember?
RALEIGH
Of course I remember.
BESS
I ask that you forget me. Go to
your ship. Do your duty. Forget
me.

aleigh gazes at her, deeply moved.
RALEIGH
Oh, Bess...
The Queen's ladies come hurrying by. Margaret calls to Bess
as they go.
MARGARET
Bess! We're summoned.
ESS
I'm coming.

Goodbye.
She runs after the ladies.
Raleigh walks slowly after them down the hall. On his face
a new look forms. He knows now what he's going to do.

ELIZABETH
This Spanish Armada is at sea
carrying an army of ten thousand
men.
(indicating on the map)
The Duke of Parma has fifteen
thousand men on the French coast.
WALSINGHAM
They plan to cross the Channel in
barges, under the protection of
the Spanish fleet, and sail up
the Thames.
ELIZABETH
But they don't yet have enough
barges at Calais. We have a
little time.
WALSINGHAM
(surprised)
That is so.
ELIZABETH
Our forces defend the Thames
entrance at Tilbury. How many
men?
HATTON
We have three, possibly four
thousand, majesty.
WALSINGHAM
If the Spanish fleet reaches
Calais in strength, the combined
armies will be beyond our power
to resist.
LIZABETH
Therefore, the Spanish fleet must
not reach Calais.
HOWARD
Majesty, this vast Armada will
surely smash through our naval
defences. We must be prepared for
the worst.

WALSINGHAM
How did you know about the
numbers of the Dutch barges,
majesty? I don't recall supplying
you with that information.
ELIZABETH
You may observe, Walsingham, that
I don't see my way with only one
eye. Nor do I hop along on only
one leg. Why then would I rely on
only one source of information?
She sweeps into her quarters. Her ladies, waiting there,
jump up in haste. She scans them.
LIZABETH
Where's Bess?
Her eyes coem to rest on Margaret. She sees that Margaret
knows something.
ELIZABETH
Where is she?

Doors burst open and Elizabeth comes storming out, barely
containing a powerful rage.

Bess comes running from the far end.

BESS
Here, my lady!
ELIZABETH
Tell me! Is it true? Are you
married? Are you with child? Are
you WITH CHILD?
Bess stands before her with her head bowed.
BESS
Yes, my lady.
Elizabeth falls on her with uncontrolled rage, striking out
at her, beating her about the head, shrieking out the words
that so inflame and wound her. Bess takes the blows in
silence.
ELIZABETH
You traitress! You dare to have
secrets from me! I am your Queen!
You ask my permission before you
rut - before you marry - before
you breed! My bitches wear my
collars! Do you hear me? How dare
you be with child!
Walsingham comes hobbling up.
WALSINGHAM
Majesty, please! Dignity - mercy -
But Elizabeth is too far gone. She turns on him, eyes
blazing.
ELIZABETH
This is no time for mercy! That's
what you said to me. I don't
forget. But you showed mercy,
Walsingham! Go to your traitor
brother, and leave me to my
business!

Is the child his? Tell me! Say

Yes, my lady. It is - my

Raleigh has come up to them unnoticed. He has seen and
heard all. He speaks to Elizabeth quietly, sadly.
RALEIGH
This is not the Queen I love and
serve.
Elizabeth stares at him. He meets her eyes. His gaze is so
unflinching that slowly the madness drains out of her. When
she speaks next, she is her proud self again.
ELIZABETH
This gentleman has seduced a lady
under my care. This lady has
married without my consent. These
are offences punishable by law.

Arrest him.

Dr Dee watches as Elizabeth prowls his cluttered rooms,
releasing the tension that has swelled to bursting point
within her.
ELIZABETH
The fall of an empire, you told
me. Did you mean the English
empire? Because by God, England
will not fall while I am Queen!
If that's your prophecy, sir,
prophesy again!

You want me to tell your majesty
only what your majesty chooses to
hear?

ELIZABETH
I will not be a toy of the fates!
Have I not faced an assassin's
bullet and lived?
She turns to Dr Dee and sees his quizzical gaze on her, and
she lets her rage pass.
E
LIZABETH
Just tell me there's no
certainty. The shadows of ghosts,
you said. Any outcome is
possible. Give me hope.
DEE
The forces that shape the world
are greater than all of us,
majesty. How can I promise you
that they'll conspire in your
favour, even though you are the
Queen? But this much I know. When
the storm breaks, each man acts
in accordance with his own
nature. Some are dumb with
terror. Some flee. Some hide. And
some spread their wings like
eagles and soar on the wind.
Elizabeth understands. She draws herself up, finding now
the self-belief she needs for the battle to come.
ELIZABETH
You're a wise man, Dr Dee.
DEE
And you, madam, are a very great
lady.

Raleigh lies awake and fully dressed on the bed in his

nave of St Paul's. As they make their way towards the
altar, Elizabeth issues commands.

The bells are to ring in every
church in the land.
Hatton bows to show he has received the order.
ELIZABETH
Labourers are to leave the fields
and take up arms. The harvest
must wait.

Hatton bows and leaves. Elizabeth continues up the nave,
now followed only by Walsingham. She turns to him with
another order.
ELIZABETH
Release all prisoners. England is
their country too.
She moves forward again. Walsingham follows, waiting,
knowing there's more. Elizabeth turns to him one last time.
ELIZABETH
Release Raleigh. He is
forgiven... As I too pray to be
forgiven...
Walsingham leaves. Elizabeth goes forward to stand before
the altar alone.
ELIZABETH
Leave me. All of you.
The remainder of her entourage bow and withdraw. Elizabeth
goes on down the nave to the altar, and there, at the foot
of the steps, sinks to her knees. She does not bow her
head.

Lord Howard bent over a mass of charts with his commanders
round him: HAWKINS, DRAKE, FROBISHER and Raleigh. The boom
of Spanish cannon shakes the air. Flashes of fire light the
faces of the English officers.
DRAKE
We must attack! What choice do we
have?
HOWARD
We're decisively outgunned,
Drake. We are losing too many
ships. We must defend the coast.
DRAKE

the Armada's progress)
There has to be a way of getting
inside this crescent formation.
RALEIGH
Our ships may be smaller but
they're nimbler. We should use
the strengths we've got.

I tell you, we're out-gunned. Do
you want to lose the whole fleet?

Break their formation and we have
a chance.

Philip reaches the steps at the foot of the altar. He goes
down on his knees. Then he drops further down, to abase
himself on the hard stone floor. The cardinals turn their
backs to him.

Walsingham speaks to his Queen with difficulty.

Permission - to go -
Elizabeth looks tenderly down on him, shaking her head.

You always did do as you pleased,
whether I wanted it or not. I've

cheek.

dancing slowly about, and crooning a low song, in the
oddest way.

Now in his solitary dance Raleigh turns, and we see he's
holding a new-born BABY BOY. He kisses the baby's little
bald head, and sings his wordless song.
Footsteps outside. The door opens, and a royal servant
enters, followed by other servants and guards.
OYAL SERVANT
Her majesty the Queen!
Elizabeth enters, in formal style. She stands and takes in
the scene - Raleigh holding his baby son - the room beyond -
Bess rises at once and comes through to make her curtsey to
the Queen. Elizabeth seems not to see her.
A regal wave at the servants and guards. They withdraw.
Elizabeth stalks round the room. No reason to suppose her
displeasure has passed.
ELIZABETH
When was the birth?
RALEIGH
F
our nights ago.
ELIZABETH
The mother is well?
RALEIGH
Thank God.
Now Elizabeth turns to Bess, and their eyes meet. The Queen
puts out her hand and touches Bess lightly on one cheek. A
silent forgiveness.
ELIZABETH
And the child?
RALEIGH
My son is well.
Now for the first time she looks at the baby.
ELIZABETH
Your Elizabeth has a child. You
must be proud.
RALEIGH
Yes.
Elizabeth moves away, unable to bear seeing the baby.

ALEIGH
More than ever.
She turns to go. But before she reaches the door, she
stops.
LIZABETH
I'd like to give your son my
blessing.
RALEIGH
I would be honoured.
Elizabeth takes the baby in her arms. She holds him
carefully. She finds herself more moved than she had
expected. She bends her head over him, and turns her back
on Raleigh.
Raleigh watches and waits. And waits.
ON ELIZABETH: her cheek pressed to the baby's head. Her
eyes closed.
LIZABETH (V.O.)
I am called the Virgin Queen. And
yet I have many children... You
are all my children. There is no
jewel, be it never so rich a
prize, which I put before this
jewel: I mean, your love. I want
no more wars. England is enough
for me. I want no lordship over
your souls. Only a free people
can love.

And in your love - is my life.
