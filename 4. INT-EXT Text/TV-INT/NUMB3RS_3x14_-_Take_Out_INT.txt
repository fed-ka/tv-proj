  Swanky San Fernando Restaurant, tables filled, three deep at 
  the bar.  TWO BUSINESSMEN sit near the back, scan the room,

  ...when TWO MASKED MEN burst through the front door.  Dressed 
  in black, body armor, one with a Glock, one with an FN-P90. 

                                MASKED MAN #1
                      (light Spanish Accent)
                Wallets, purses, cell phones. 
                  Everything goes in the bag. If you 
                hold back, you get shot. 

  The second man moves through the room with a small duffle 
  bag, collecting the loot; one victim, not quick enough to 
  empty his pockets, gets pistol-whipped.

                                MASKED MAN #2
                      (heavier Spanish accent)
                Mobile. Now.

  Meanwhile one of the businessmen surreptitiously sends a text-
  message, then nods to his friend...

  ... and the two men make their move, standing and pulling 
  their own pistols on the robbers.

                              BUSINESS MAN
                LAPD.  Don t move...

  Both robbers freeze --

                              BUSINESS MAN (CONT D)
                ...drop your weapons. 

  Both men nod, bend over and place their guns on the ground, 
  drop to their knees, lace their hands behind their heads.

                              BUSINESS MAN (CONT D)
                Put your hands in the air.

  One cop keeps the robbers covered as his partner holsters his 
  gun, takes out handcuffs, moves in their direction --

  -- when TWO OF THE OTHER PATRONS --an Hispanic MAN AND WOMAN, 
    attractive -- pull out guns of their own and open fire. 

  The cops, caught unaware, go down in withering gunfire...

  ... and all four robbers (TEAM #1: MARIA CAMPOS, MASKED MAN 
  #1, MASKED MAN #2, HISPANIC MAN) gather their items -- the 
  two killers collecting their bullet casings, and exit.


  A black tie reception. CHARLIE, spiffily dressed in a tuxedo,

  The aftermath of the robbery.  LAPD, FBI Techs work the crime 
  scene, interviewing witnesses, studying the blood spatter. 

  DON gets off his phone, joining COLBY and LAPD SERGEANT 
  POWELS.  The sergeant is visibly shaken.

                              POWELS
                We were chasing a pattern robbery. 
                Two guys in masks and body armor, in  
                and out of upscale restaurants in 
                under ten minutes.

                                POWELS
                They ve been hitting all over the 
                valley; no way to predict where 
                they d go next.  We had to spread 
                out; two man spotter teams in a dozen 
                  restaurants, with Rapid Deployment 
                Teams waiting for a signal.

  Don stares at the blood on the floor for a moment.

                              DON
                They couldn t call it in?

                                POWELS
                They did.  We weren t fast enough.

                I got these guys killed.  What do I

  Powels trails off.  Don looks at Powels, empathizing, but 
  what is there to say.  He and Colby move off...

                              COLBY
                  Witnesses said the officers ID d 
                  themselves, disarmed the robbers... 
                then two of the customers pulled 
                  handguns, opened fire.
                      (beat)
                And they collected their bullet 
                casings before they left.

                So, we re looking at a four man

  Charlie erasing, scribbling, erasing on his board, doesn t 
  notice when Millie enters.  She waits, not wanting to

  staring back at him.

                A few months back, I read about the 
                system used to differentiate between 
                  institutional targets, like banks -- 
                and civilian targets --

                                MILLIE
                It may serve your purposes better.

  Charlie thinks about it.

                              CHARLIE
                There was an article, maybe a year 
                ago...

  Millie hands him a file.

                                MILLIE
                This one?

  Charlie takes the file.

                              CHARLIE
                How did you know?

                                MILLIE
                You run off to help the FBI, I see a 
                news story about two police officers 
                being killed... my math degree allows 
                me to put two and two together.

  Charlie pores over the article.

                              CHARLIE
                  Professor -- Millie -- thank you.

  Millie starting to leave --

  David sits with RICKY JONES.  Gray jumper indicating he s a

                Cred or a kind word to the parole 
                board, Ricky.  Your choice.

  Jones flips through the paperwork, considers:

                You re not looking local, I ll tell 
                you that much.  I don t know of a

                              DAVID

                Hell yeah.  This kind of work 
                attracts two kinds; the ones about

                So these guys are about violence.

                They figured they could back us off

                This Threat Matrix isn t quite right 
                yet.  It s set to predict the 
                  unpredictable -- terrorist attacks -- 
                and robberies have their own unique 
                  characteristics.

                              AMITA
                Why did you start off with the Threat 
                Matrix in the first place?

                              CHARLIE
                It was Millie s suggestion.

                But we can t point to specific money 
                unless they let us look at their 
                  accounts.

                              DAVID
                That particular Catch-22 has made 
                Nauru a favorite banking center for 
                all kinds of high-end lowlifes.

                No luck on the ex-military angle 
                either.  Immigration couldn t narrow 
                the field much.  Nicaragua, 
                  Argentina, Guatemala... over the past

  of the Homeland Security Threat Levels (green, blue, yellow, 
  orange, red) pop on the screen.

                Then I went further... evaluating the 
                  restaurants in terms of architecture 
                and access to fast escape routes.

  Charlie pushes a key again, leaving only 120 RED spots.

                              DAVID
                Looks pretty much like the LAPD s 
                list.

                Which told me I was on the right 
                path.  But Set Theory wasn t working, 
                so I applied a mixture of 
                  multidimensional graph Laplacians

                It s a way to investigate a group of 
                things, and identify their shared 
                  properties.  

  Colby and David exchange glances.  You get it?

                              CHARLIE
                Think about a refrigerator --

                  separately at any number of places...

  -- from the items, we see the corresponding stores -- a

                High food rating means a trendier 
                  restaurant, and the fattest credit 
                cards.

                              CHARLIE
                Exactly. 
                      (pushes the key)
                We used those variables to narrow it 
                  further..

  Now there s only 15 dots on the screen, most are light pink, 
  but one is dark, BLOOD RED, almost blackish.

                              DAVID
                      (pointing to the single, 
                        blood red dot)
                You think this is their next target?

                              CHARLIE
                Since you can t cover all 15... 
                      (the map goes to a single, 
                        pulsing dot)
                ...this site has the highest 
                  probability.


  Another upscale locale, but this time as we scan the room, we 
  see familiar faces.  Colby sits at the bar, drinking club 
  soda.  David s enjoying the company of a female FBI agent. 
  More undercover agents chatting at the front, waiting for a 
  table.


  The door opens -- all of the FBI agents tense --


  The door pushes all the way open, Colby has his gun half way 
  out of his holster... 

  ... then puts it away as a young kid holds the door for his 
  date--


  As the robbers sweep through the restaurant, terrorizing the 
  patrons --

                      (Spanish accent)
                Wallets, jewels, purses, cell phones. 
                  Everything goes in the bag.  If you 
                hold back, you get shot. 


  FBI agents still waiting.  David s cell phone rings,

                              DAVID
                  Sinclair...

  Colby s phone starts ringing, he exchanges a glance with 
  David, answers --

  -- as we start to hear other agents  phones going off --


  Don enters with Colby, catches Megan getting off the phone.

                              MEGAN
                State Department had no luck with 
                Nauru.  Their courts turned down our

                on banking.  They re protecting their 
                asset.

                              MEGAN
                And making our life hard.  Without 
                the account information, we have no 
                  identifying information.  No way to 
                  backtrack to the killers.

                spot in the system, maybe someone 
                here in LA that we can pressure.

  Colby heads off as Don gathers his keys and phone.

                              MEGAN
                You got your thing with the

                              DON
                Yeah.

  Megan debates what she says next, then:

                I know it s just an appointment for

  Not the banter he d hoped; Don exits.


  Don enters to meet with WILLIAM BRADFORD (older, African-
  American, physically intimidating) the FBI consultant hired 
    specifically for Trauma Recovery.

                              BRADFORD
                Have a seat.

  Don sits, then Bradford.

                              BRADFORD
                So?

  Don stands, crosses to Bradford and hands him his paperwork.

                              BRADFORD
                I have the originals.

  Don sits.

                              BRADFORD
                No problem.  The FBI wanted us to 
                talk.

                              BRADFORD

                      (sighs)
                I don t hate my dad, I like women but 
                respect them as people, and pulling 
                my gun doesn t get me excited.  Okay?

                              BRADFORD
                How do you feel when you pull your

                              DON

                              BRADFORD

                I m here because I shot Crystal 
                Hoyle.  Who was a spree murderer.  
                Who had just kidnapped one of my 
                agents. Who was driving straight at a 
                  roadblock with a car full of hand 
                  grenades.

                              BRADFORD
                There was a trained sniper on the 
                scene, an...
                      (checks paperwork)
                ... Agent Edgerton.  Why do you think 
                he didn t take the shot?

                              DON
                He probably would ve.  I shot first.

                              CHARLIE
                And which way does this balance out?

                              ALAN
                No idea.  My wisdom s currently being 
                  stretched as an angry renter, 
                  wondering when my landlord s getting 
                the spider people to come back.

  Charlie stands to help his Dad clear the last two cobwebs...

  FLASH CHARLIE VISION

  An enormous, elaborate spiderweb fills the screen.  A large 
  grasshopper hits the web, struggles sending shockwaves up the 
  silk until... a large Golden Orb spider, size of a dinner 
  plate, strikes, lightning quick, killing the grasshopper.

  But Charlie s already out the door.


  Come up on Charlie s dotted map, full spectrum from Green to 
  Red.  Don alone.

                Where s everyone?

                              DON
                Working.

                              CHARLIE
                I know I screwed up --

                              DON
                You didn t screw up, Charlie. 
                  Sometimes I think you don t even know 
                what screwing up looks like.

  Charlie concedes.

                              CHARLIE
                Okay, well, my math wasn t wrong, my 
                  assumptions were -- assuming all data 
                belonged to the same set. Think of it 
                like searching for a spider or its 
                prey by studying a web...

  BEGIN AUDIENCE VISION

  A web sits pristine, dew drops shining in the morning sun.

                              CHARLIE (V.O.)
                We can use Tension Values of the silk 
                web, vibrations, mixed with weather 
                  conditions, surrounding terrain, 
                other variables...

  Various colored dots from Green to Red fill in the web, 
  almost looking like a target with greener shades farthest 
  from the center and the darkest red shades near the center.

                              CHARLIE (V.O.)
                ...to reliably predict both where the 
                Spider s located and where the next 
                insect will get tangled.

  All the color disappears, except for a single dark red spot. 
  On cue, a Fly trying to get to food on the other side of web 
  flies right into the spot, getting tangled. 



                                                                          (CONTINUED)   NUMB3RS    314/51  "Take Out"  BUFF Rev   12/12/06    29.

                              CHARLIE (V.O.)
                However, there are some species...

  The web with the perfect, target-like colors, reappears.  
  Then the colors start to mix and match, the perfect pattern 
  falls apart and dark red dots start to appear in odd 
  locations - a Jumbled Web.

                              CHARLIE (V.O.)
                ...that build overlapping webs.

  A second web appears, covered by the perfect pattern, then 
  overlays part of the first web and we now see two patterns 
  mixed together.

                              CHARLIE (V.O.)
                Assuming only one web when dealing 
                with this species will give you false 
                answers about where it s safe to fly.

  A FLY zooms straight into the web.

  David sits across from the stony, silent FEMALE ROBBER (MARIA 
  CAMPOS).  Her chair is at an odd angle as she stares down.

                              DAVID
                What s your name?

  No response, refusing even to make eye contact.

                              DAVID
                Where are you from?


  Same milieu, only Don standing above a seated MALE ROBBER 
  (HISPANIC MAN).  Don continues the interrogation pattern.

                              DON
                Why are you here?

  Just like the woman, no response.

                              DON
                When did you--

  Don s interrupted by the male robber lightly tapping on the 
  table top.  Don waits until he s finished, then continues.

                              DON
                When did you enter the country?


  Back with David and the woman.

                              DAVID
                ...enter the country?

  No response.

                              DAVID
                What s your--

  Almost the same tapping... David waits, then starts again.

                              DAVID
                What s your name?   NUMB3RS    314/51  "Take Out"  BUFF Rev   12/12/06    32.




  David and Don continue their questioning, same four questions 
  over and over, in the background.

                              COLBY
                We should end this.

                They re trained in counter-

                      (beat)
                Look at the way they re sitting; they 
                moved the chair so the light s behind 
                them.  Refusing to make eye contact--

  On the speaker, we hear tapping coming from both rooms again.

                              COLBY
                And that.  They re tapping to knock 
                the interrogators off their rhythm.   
                We re all working from the same 
                manuals.

                The village I mentioned... three 
                children survived.  Six young eyes 
                that saw the faces behind the masks.

                And this weakling, this Colonel, had 
                  a choice; be a good soldier, turn the 
                children over to the death squads... 
                or to smuggle them to Los Angeles.

                              MEGAN
                The death squad followed you north, 
                looking for the children.

                They tried to wring words from a man 
                who taught silence.  Would have 
                killed me... but knew if they did, my

                to make a mistake, to lead them to 
                the ones they would kill.

                              MEGAN
                Why the robberies?

                              BERNARDO
                In Mexico, they killed farmers for 
                the coins in their cushions, the gold

                You said you trained them.  Did you 
                train them how to move the money too?

  Bernardo scribbles a list of names.

                There are lawyers in Los Angeles...

                money to run your operations.

                  Salazar s murder gave us the wedge we 
                needed with the offshore bank.  They

                Even after they gave us access to the 
                offshore accounts, we lost the money 
                in the massive transfers into Mexico.

                              AMITA
                Most of the money stayed in Mexico--

                So they re living off the land?

                              CHARLIE
                Exactly.  Death Squads can t be 
                cheap, it was a matter of using a 
                  target-specific optimization model.  
                  Something called Outlier Detection.

                              AMITA
                Not a big deal, since Charlie helped 
                develop it for the Treasury 
                  Department s Terrorist Financial 
                Tracking Program.

                              CHARLIE
                You see, we had been doing a  brute 
                force  search --

                Outlier Detection, though, is target-

    A Fisherwoman weighs each  fly  for the stream conditions,

                cast our rod exactly where we wanted, 
                and catch exactly the type of fish we 
                needed.

  Fisherwoman catches a salmon, yanking it out of the water. 

  BACK TO SCENE

                              CHARLIE
                Knowing the exact variables -- how 
                much stolen money existed, the 
                robbery dates and where the transfer 
                would originate from -- we were able 
                to zero in on seven wire transfers 
                from Nauru to an East LA wire office.

                              AMITA
                The transfers weren t exact matches 
                for the numbers or times, but they 
                fit a general pattern.

                              CHARLIE
                To pick up a wire transfer, you have 
                to present a driver s license... 

  Charlie puts a Mexican Driver s license picture, of MARIA 
  CAMPOS on the screen...

  The woman David attempted to interrogate.

                              MEGAN
                Yeah, I recognize her...

                              CHARLIE
                  Fortunately, so did I.

  Charlie, with trepidation, enters to find Millie already 
    entertaining a suit, MEISNER, from MacMillan Pharmaceutical.

                In all honesty, Professor, I could 
                not see this project going forward

  Bradford goes back to his office.  Don scans the room, looks 
  at his watch, looks at the door, then...

  Don sits down, picks up a magazine and waits.
