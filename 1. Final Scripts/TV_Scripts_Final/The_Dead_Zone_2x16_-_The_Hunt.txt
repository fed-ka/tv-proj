                                    "THE HUNT FOR OSAMA"

                                              TEASER


  11OVER BLACK WE READ:

          "Following the events of 9/11, the United States Government
          has been using all available means to track down the
            perpetrators of this crime against the American people. 
          This story, while fiction, is based on facts provided by
          sources close to the investigation.  The U.S. government
          will neither confirm nor deny that similar events have
          actually occurred."

          As the text fades, we hear a RECORDING of a man speaking
          in Arabic.  The audio is staticky, the voice labored, as
          though the speaker is struggling with a respiratory or
          other ailment as he delivers his strident message.

          And now the black of the screen is threaded with vertical
          white lines, the entire image pulsing in rhythm with the
          voice like some animated abstract painting, until we
          realize we are slowly pulling away from --


22ECU ON A VOCAL WAVEFORM

          as it snakes across a MONITOR SCREEN.  A computerized
          VOICE VERIFICATION ANALYSIS is underway.  As the man
            continues speaking, sections of the waveform are
          highlighted and isolated, while data relating to cadence,
          pitch, tone and volume is plotted in a color-coded
            TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP in an adjacent window: a 3D vocal
            signature taking shape.  A percentage underneath the
          graphic ticks rapidly upward, stopping at 97.3 PERCENT.

          Then the recording stops, the screen goes black and lines
          of TEXT start scrolling across:  VOICE PRINT VERIFIED...
          SUBJECT ID CONFIRMED... SEARCHING MOST RECENT PHOTO...

          ...and a PHOTO OF OSAMA BIN LADEN fills the screen.  A
          final text message flashes:  STATUS:  AT LARGE.  And as
          we PUSH IN on the eyes of the world's most wanted terrorist
          until all we can see are FLICKERING PIXELS, we hear a
            telephone RING.  Once.  Twice.  Then a machine answers.


  33EXT. SMITH HOUSE - DAY

          The gate's shut, yellow hazard tape strung across.  A
          sign warns:  "Hazardous Material Removal in Progress."




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "THE HUNT FOR OSAMA" - TEASER - 2/6/03 WHT-2  2.


    3CONTINUED:3

                                        JOHNNY (ANSWERING MACHINE)
                        Hey, sorry I can't pick up...

          We CRANE UP, see TRUCKS and VANS from an asbestos removal
          firm parked by the front door.

                                        JOHNNY (ANSWERING MACHINE)
                        ...but I'm away for a few days
                        while some work's done on my house.

          PUSHING IN CLOSER, finding a worker wearing a white HAZ-
          MAT SUIT and carrying a cardboard box as he enters --


  44INT. SMITH HOUSE - DAY (JOHNNY WARDROBE: DAY 1)

            Following the man into the living room, which has been
            transformed, though not as we might expect.  Furniture
          has been pushed aside or removed to make way for a mobile
          command center's worth of high-tech gear, including
          monitors and laptops displaying biomedical data, manned
          by more "asbestos workers" in hazmat suits.

          Our guy sets his box down and opens it to reveal several
            STARBUCKS COFFEES.  He brings two to a man and woman
          dressed in dark business suits, seated in front of a
          monitor whose screen we don't yet see.

          The man is FRANK, 35, mild-looking with thoughtful eyes. 
          He wears a radio headset with a small boom mic.  He accepts
          the coffees, passes one to HARRIET, 30, attractive in a
          guarded, Jody Fosterish way.  Frank speaks into his mic.

                                        FRANK
                          Anything, John?

          And now we REVEAL THE MONITOR SCREEN, which shows Johnny
          sitting alone in a pool of light, also wearing a headset. 
          Electrodes are attached to his temples and run inside his
          shirt.  His eyes are closed.

                                        FRANK
                        John, can you hear me?

          PUSHING IN as Johnny's eyes open.  And in a sudden RUSHING
          SHOT, we FOLLOW THE VIDEO CABLE from the back of the
          monitor across the living room floor, under the closed
          door to the kitchen, under the closed door to the dining
          room, and up to a VIDEO CAMERA mounted on a tripod in --


  55INT. DINING ROOM

          where Johnny is scrunching a brightly colored scarf, his


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "THE HUNT FOR OSAMA" - TEASER - 2/6/03 WHT-2  3.


    5CONTINUED:5

          face showing his frustration.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I hear you but I can't help you.

            INTERCUTTING now with the living room as a technician
          observes Johnny's fluctuating bio readings and takes notes
          on a clipboard.

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        Like I said, it doesn't always
                        work.

                                        HARRIET
                                (sotto, annoyed)
                        Or as he should've said, "it never
                        works."

          Frank shoots her a look, then speaks patiently to Johnny.

                                        FRANK
                        That's fine, John.  Let's move on
                        to the next item and retarget.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Retarget.  Right.  Gonna retarget
                        right now.

          ON THE MONITOR, he picks up a ziplock containing a
            cigarette lighter, as Harriet again mutters her annoyance.

                                        HARRIET
                        This is what we get for recruiting
                        from the tabloids.

                                        FRANK
                                (covers his mic)
                        Halsey wants "new blood."  He
                        thinks the program's at risk.

                                        HARRIET
                        If anything's at risk, it's his
                        job.  And guess who's not going
                        to save it?

          She nods to the monitor, on which Johnny can be seen
          handling the lighter.  Frank sighs, speaks into his mic.

                                        FRANK
                        John, again, we just want you to
                          describe the current location of
                        the agent that lighter belongs
                        to, and what he or she is doing
                        there.

  5CONTINUED: (2)5

                                        FRANK (CONT'D)
                        Start with anything that comes to
                        mind.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'd love to, only nothing does.

                                        FRANK
                                (to Harriet)
                        Maybe it's, you know, stage fright.

                                        HARRIET
                        Or maybe it's, you know, a scam. 
                        Either way, we're done.

          She prepares to leave.  Frank nods resignedly, turns back
          to the monitor.

                                        FRANK
                        John, I'm afraid this isn't working
                        out.

          Johnny's frustrated as well.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sorry, I told you before we
                          started, I can't touch anything
                        and get a vision just because
                          someone's keeping score.

                                        HARRIET
                                (rummaging in purse)
                        Car keys.  Where did I leave my
                          damn...?

          This time Johnny overhears, then sees a set of keys on
          the dining table.  He reaches to grab them...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Someone looking for these?

          ...and on contact we RAMP TO HIS FACE.

          CLOSE ANGLE ON A LAPTOP SCREEN as Johnny's bio readings
          go nuts.  The technician monitoring them looks toward
          Frank, who turns back to his monitor, where Johnny is
            clutching the keys tightly.

                                        FRANK
                        John?

          But Johnny's eyes seem to be staring right out of the
          monitor at Harriet.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Agent Stone, call 911 in
                          Connecticut, get an ambulance to
                        827 Franklin Street in Cos Cob.

                                        HARRIET
                        That's my father's house.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's just had a heart attack. 
                        Don't think, just call.  Now.

          And as Harriet finally fumbles for her cell...


  5A5AINT. LIVING ROOM - TIME CUT

          A little while later.  The workers are packing up
          equipment, moving out.  Harriet closes her cell, turns to
          Frank and Johnny.  She's still somewhat stunned and
            overwhelmed, as anyone would be in these circumstances.

                                        HARRIET
                        The paramedics... They used a...
                        a lytic agent to open up his
                          coronary arteries.  He's going to
                        be okay.

          And off the looks between the three...


  66EXT. INDUSTRIAL FACILITY - DAY - ESTABLISHING

          TITLE:  GOVERNMENT REMOTE VIEWING UNIT, MOUNT GARNET,
          VERMONT

                                        HARRIET (V.O.)
                        Our military began using psychics
                        in so-called "remote viewing"
                          programs in the late 70s.


  6A6AEXT. INDUSTRIAL FACILITY - DAY (JOHNNY WARDROBE: DAY 2)

          Harriet leads Johnny, who has a DUFFEL BAG over his
            shoulder, toward the building's entrance.


  77INT. GRVU - OUTER BUILDING - DAY

          Harriet escorts a curious Johnny past uniformed workers,
          industrial machinery and some glassed-in factory offices.

                        Operations have included finding
                        hidden nuclear weapons, tracking
                        drug shipments, and, more... 
                        generally, uncovering intelligence
                        that couldn't be obtained by more
                          conventional means.

          ANGLE - A DOOR LABELED "MAINTENANCE" SWINGS SLOWLY CLOSED

                                        HARRIET (V.O.)
                        In 1995, however, the program was
                          transferred to the CIA, which saw
                        it as a potential embarrassment
                        and shut it down.  That, at least,
                        is the official story.


  88INT. JANITOR'S CLOSET

          Amidst mops and cleaning supplies, Harriet attaches a
          magnetic ID/DOOR CARD to Johnny's lapel, then holds her
          own card against a metal wall at the end of the closet.

                                        HARRIET (V.O.)
                          Unofficially... well, let's just
                        say that a program that no longer
                        exists can no longer be an
                            embarrassment...


          ANGLE ON THE METAL "WALL"

          as multiple locks retract and it slowly swings open,
          proving to be a thick, safe-like security door.

                                        HARRIET (V.O.)
                        ...if it were to exist.  Which,
                        of course, it doesn't.


  99INT. GRVU - INNER BUILDING - CORRIDOR

          A simple beige corridor punctuated by doors with swipe
          card locks.  There are no windows in this facility, so
          we'll mostly dispense with designating night and day. 
          Harriet and Johnny walk along, passing other personnel,
          some in military uniform, most frumpily dressed civilians.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No phone booth.  I was hoping for
                        a phone booth.  And maybe a Cone
                        of Silence.

                                        HARRIET
                        We've heard all the jokes, but if
                        you actually come up with something
                        new, by all means share.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No windows, either, I see.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "THE HUNT FOR OSAMA" - TEASER - 2/6/03 WHT-2  7.

                        The inner building is completely
                          self-contained.  Separate power
                        grid and com lines.  We need them.

          She stops at a door with a FLASHING RED LIGHT above it
          and swipes her ID card, as a Security Officer takes
          Johnny's duffel.


  1010INT. GRVU - WAR ROOM

          Harriet and Johnny step into a large facility that's a
          cross between Mission Control and the control room of a
            recording studio.  It's dominated by a TRIPTYCH OF HUGE
          PLASMA SCREENS currently showing a mix of SATELLITE IMAGES
          and data.  Rows of consoles and computers are staffed by
          a mix of military and civilian personnel, while a large
          window overlooks another space containing a big grey cube: 
              a "room-within-the-room" that's suspended over a pool of
          water, accessed by metal catwalks. 

          As Johnny reacts...

                                        HARRIET
                        Welcome to the War.
                                                                              FADE OUT.

          FADE IN:

  1111INT. WAR ROOM - CLOSE ON A TABLOID NEWSPAPER

          Showing Johnny next to Bigfoot, with the headline:  "Johnny
          Sez Bigfoot Lives."  The paper lowers to reveal Johnny
          and Harriet moving into the room.  We're watching with
          two technicians seated at consoles.  TECHNICIAN #1 sets
          the tab down, observes wryly...

                                        TECHNICIAN #1
                        Elvis has entered the building.

          MOVING NOW with Harriet and Johnny as other skeptical
          looks are aimed his way.

                                        HARRIET
                        We call this the War Room, but
                        it's really just an information
                        way station.  All the intelligence
                          developed here is sent on to the
                          Pentagon and CIA, where, if it's
                        deemed actionable, it's relayed
                        to forward military bases, carriers
                        supporting long-range recon and
                        strike teams.

          Johnny reacts to the grey cube, raises an eyebrow...

                                        JOHNNY
                        What is it?

                                        HARRIET
                        The Tank.  Built with active audio-
                          screening materials, suspended to
                        prevent any intercept of vibrations
                        that might result from voices,
                          machinery or electronic media.
                                (dry)
                        Our "Cone of Silence."

                                        JOHNNY
                        Who's in there now?

                                        HARRIET
                        Major Granowitz, our senior viewer.

          And now she indicates a trim man in an army uniform
          (COLONEL HALSEY, 50s) standing behind an OPERATOR'S STATION
          manned by Frank, the other agent from the Teaser.  Both
          watch an ARRAY OF FLAT PANEL MONITORS.

                                        HARRIET
                        And that's Colonel Halsey, our
                        C.O.  He won't mind if we observe.

          And as she leads Johnny closer...


          FAVORING THE MONITORS

          The largest one shows a high angle view of GRANOWITZ, 40,
          dark, shadowed eyes; ex-Special Forces, now a different
          type of warrior.  The interior of the Tank is furnished
          with just a small desk and an ergonomic chair.  There's a
          DRAWING PAD on the table, and a SECOND MONITOR is focused
          on it as Granowitz SKETCHES the interior of a well-
          buttressed mine-like tunnel that's filled with crates of
          rifles, mortar and RPG rounds, and other military hardware. 
          Granowitz's voice comes through a speaker.

                                        GRANOWITZ (MONITOR)
                        I'm moving through one of the
                        outer tunnels.  It's cooler here. 
                        Some sort of forced ventilation. 
                        Hmm.  I'm tasting metal.  Steel,
                        no trace of rust oxides.  They
                        must've reinforced the walls with
                        new girders since my last session. 
                          Construction here seems much more
                          sophisticated than Tora Bora. 
                        You could drop thousand pounders
                        on this place all day and barely
                        rattle their teacups.

                                        FRANK
                        What about a tactical nuclear
                        device?

          But Halsey, who's been listening with mounting impatience,
          leans over him and punches an intercom button.

                                        HALSEY
                        What about the target, Reg?

                                        GRANOWITZ (MONITOR)
                        Sorry, I'm not sensing him right
                        now.  They could've moved him,
                        maybe to a new part of the complex
                          I haven't discovered yet.

                                        HALSEY
                                (under his breath)
                        We're spinning our wheels.




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "THE HUNT FOR OSAMA" - ACT ONE - 2/6/03 WHT-2  10.

                                        FRANK
                        Sir?

          Halsey indicates the "Viewscreen," which shows overlapping
            SATELLITE IMAGES of a region of Iran bordering Afghanistan.

                                        HALSEY
                          Sixty-eight hours of satellite
                        time, and imagery analysis can't
                        come up with a shred of
                          corroboration.  We let him keep
                        this up, he'll bust our budget
                        for the entire op.

            A cutaway to the monitor shows Granowitz looking up at
          the camera, annoyed.  Neither Halsey nor Frank notice.

                                        FRANK
                        But what if he's still right about
                        the target?  If the Mujahideen-i-
                        Kalq are sheltering him...?

                                        HALSEY
                        They're arms smugglers.  They
                          wouldn't want the heat.  Anyway,
                        there's no other intel supporting
                        his Iran theory.

                                        GRANOWITZ
                                (on monitor, pissed)
                        Hey, you guys wanna have a private
                        talk, maybe you should turn off
                        the goddamn intercom first.

                                        HALSEY
                        For Chrisssakes, Frank.

          He punches it off, as we cut away to the two technicians
          seen earlier, who roll their eyes.  Halsey rubs his brow,
          clearly under pressure.

                                        HALSEY
                        This is no good.  I've got the
                        Three Blind Mice coming in to
                        review the entire program.  If I
                        can't show them some progress...

          That worry hangs in the air as his anxious eyes find
          Johnny, then narrow.  He turns to Frank, indicates
            Granowitz on the monitor

                                        HALSEY
                        Tell Reg that he's, uh, earned a
                        rest, take him out of the rotation.

                        I think maybe it's time for a new
                          perspective.

          He moves to Johnny and Harriet while Frank talks to
            Granowitz MOS in the b.g.  Harriet makes intros.

          Halsey doesn't offer his hand, eyes Johnny appraisingly.

                                        HALSEY
                        You're a psychometric, right? 
                          Touch-enabled cognitive episodes --
                          "visions" -- with full-spectrum
                          real-time feedback.

          During which, through the observation window we see a

                        Don't think I've ever heard it
                        put quite that way before.

                        We like to think we trade in
                        science here, Mister Smith...

                          ...though I guess you also could
                        say I'm something of an enthusiast. 
                        Even been rated with some psychic
                        ability of my own.  Nothing in
                        your league of course.

            Granowitz enters from the outer room, eyes them both coolly
          as he accepts a water bottle from a technician.  Halsey
          barely glances at him...

                                        HALSEY
                        Your last encounter with the
                        Agency, that Grissom business,
                        may've irritated a few of my
                          colleagues...

                        Now I know you're not familiar 
                        with our protocols, but I'm betting
                        if we work together, we can achieve
                        some remarkable results.

            Granowitz just shakes his head wearily and exits.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'll do my best, sir.  It might
                        help if I had a better idea of
                        what exactly I'm here to do.

                                        HALSEY
                          Actually, that would be a bad
                        idea.  We call it "front loading."

                        If we tell you too much in advance,
                        it could skew the results of your
                          sessions.

          Halsey steps closer to Johnny.

                                        HALSEY
                        Bottom line:  You're here because
                        you want to make a difference,
                        help your country win this war,
                        am I right son?

          A beat as Johnny considers how to answer this, but in the
          end he just nods an acknowledgment.

                                        HALSEY
                        Good.  Then you do your job, and
                        let us do ours.  That's the Army

                        So what do you say?  Ready to get
                        your feet wet?

          And as Johnny turns to eye the Tank, looming behind the
          glass like some forbidding alien artifact...

          Harriet now at the operator's console, Johnny on her

                        I'm not much of an artist.  I try
                        drawing a horse, it ends up looking
                        like a beagle.

                          Doodling.  With my Dead Zone.

          In the Tank, the last technician exits and locks the door. 
          Johnny shifts nervously.

                                        HARRIET
                        Just consider this a chance to
                        get acquainted with our process. 
                        The first set of items are intended

                        when you're ready.

          Johnny takes a deep breath, then opens the first bin. 
          There are a bunch of items inside, all the detritus of
          war.  Among them:  a SHARD OF BURNED METAL; DOG TAGS;
          BUSTED NIGHT VISION GOGGLES, etc. 

          As he touches these things, we INTERCUT A SERIES OF
          FLASHES, all DIGITALLY MANIPULATED STOCK IMAGES from the
          war in Afghanistan.  Images familiar to us but experienced
          by Johnny in his own unique way.  He handles them and
          reacts, almost as though identifying cue cards, starting
          with the metal shard which sparks --          DEAD ZONE: "THE HUNT FOR OSAMA" - ACT ONE - 2/6/03 WHT-2  14.

                        This is from a bomb.  A "smart

          Halsey's excited; his hunch seems to be paying off.  He
          turns to Harriet.

                        Enough warm-up.  Cut to the chase.

          Harriet nods, then speaks into her headset.

                        John.  I want you to open the
                        next container.

          Johnny does.  There's just one item inside, a torn and
          begrimed CAFTAN with a distinctive PATTERN.  As he touches
          it... BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!  The Tank shakes as if it's
          being depth-charged.  RAMP TO HIS FACE.

          and Taliban fighters trying to evacuate.  We HEAR shouting
          in a mix of Arab languages (predominantly Arabic and
          Pashtu, and note that no fighters will actually be seen
          shouting on-camera; the dialogue will be dubbed over a
          general hubbub of panic) as one-ton bombs rock the chamber. 
          Debris rains down, fluorescents flicker and swing...
            illuminating a MAN partly buried by rubble at Johnny's
          feet.

          eyes closed as he grips the garment tighter with one hand
          and, almost unconsciously, starts to draw with the other. 
          (NOTE: the tablet doesn't show what he draws; instead we
          will see the result on a monitor in the War Room.)
          Tentatively at first, but soon it will seem as though his
          drawing hand indeed has a mind of its own.  And as he
          draws...

          Some of the technicians are beginning to show interest as
          well while Halsey continues to watch the monitors,
            including one that shows Johnny's drawing-in-progress,
          images beginning to take shape within the welter of lines.

                        Now they're helping another man
                        who's buried under the debris.

          The men clear away debris, revealing part of that
          distinctive clothing pattern...

          Halsey rests a hand on the back of Harriet's chair, growing
          more excited.

                        Is he alive?

          Johnny's pen steps up the pace, scratching quick jagged
          strokes across the surface of the tablet, like the needle
          of an old-fashioned polygraph machine.


  2121INT. CAVE

          a would-be rescuer checks the pulse in the buried man's
          wrist, shakes his head at his companion.

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        No.


  2222INT. WAR ROOM

          the technicians are perking up too, wondering if Johnny's
          about to confirm that this man is who they think he is. 
          Halsey punches the intercom.

                        John, can you describe him?

          And now under the flickering lights, we see Johnny
            crouching beside the dead man, whose face has been exposed. 
          It's a young Arab fighter with a wispy beard.

                                        JOHNNY

                        I'm looking right at him.


  2626INT. WAR ROOM

          Surprise yields to disappointment.  Halsey makes a gesture
          to Harriet to wrap it up.

                                        HARRIET
                        Okay, John.  That's all for today.


  2727INT. CAVE

          But now, a scrum of fighters clustered tightly around
          another man they're shielding rush toward Johnny.  A
          BEARDED MAN wearing FLASHY GOLD AVIATOR GLASSES leads the
          pack, shouting in Arabic to clear a path.

                                        BEARDED MAN

                        Hurry!  Hurry!  Go!  Go!  Go! 

          And as Johnny rises from his crouch, starts to repeat the
          same words...

          ...We hear them coming from his TRANCED IMAGE ON A MONITOR.

                        Hurry!  Hurry!  Go!  Go!  Go!

          Halsey turns, surprised.  He thought they were done.

                                        HALSEY

          Johnny is now watching the scrum rush past.  In their

          "GUTRA" (i.e., Osama's hat).

                        can't see his face but he's wearing

          And now everyone in the WAR ROOM is riveted, technicians
          looking up from their monitors, murmuring to each other.

          others rush on ahead as he stoops to pick them up.  But
          they're broken.  He leaves them and rushes on, but not
          before giving Johnny a good look at his face.

          And then another bomb hits.  Johnny looks up as THE ENTIRE
          CEILING COMES CRASHING DOWN, OUR WORLD AND HIS GOING BLACK.


  3232INT. TANK

          Johnny comes out of the vision, collects himself, then
          reacts to the pen still clutched tightly in his hand. 
          And off this...


  3333INT. WAR ROOM - ON THE TRIPTYCH VIEWSCREEN

          And now we see what his pen has wrought:  images emerging
          from a tangled welter of dark lines, as though rising up
          from a dark well:  the face of the dead young fighter,
          the scrum of fighters, the man with the glasses.  This
          last face is isolated and overlaid with a grid of lines
          and graphics.

          TILTING DOWN to see a FACIAL COMPOSITE -- a nearly
            photographic "police sketch" -- taking shape on a smaller
            eye-level screen, a technician working the console, then
          panning to the original drawing in Halsey's hands.

                                        HALSEY
                        Still claim you're not an artist?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't even remember picking up
                        my pen.

          Johnny's handing Harriet his wireless headset and receiver,
            unsettled by this strange new manifestation of his powers,
          and by what those powers have just shown him.

                                        HALSEY
                        There's been a persistent theory,
                        one you may've laid to rest, that
                        our target...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Can we at least call him by his
                          name...?

                                        HALSEY
                        ...that our target died during
                        the Tora Bora campaign.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Osama Bin Laden.

                                        HALSEY
                        I'm afraid I can't confirm or
                        deny the target's identity.

          He moves to another station, Johnny and Harriet trailing.

                                        HARRIET
                        It's like we said, John, the less
                        you know, the less you'll be
                          influenced.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Influenced by what?

                                        HARRIET
                        Media images, popular beliefs,
                        even your own preconceptions.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Only my visions aren't subjective.

          Harriet and Halsey exchange guarded looks.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Look, I admit, there is one image
                        I can't get out of my head.  Two
                        towers crashing down.

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        But that image is why I'm here,
                        it's why we're all here.  That
                        image and how it makes us feel.
                                (beat)
                        I want to find that bastard as
                        much as anyone.  I just want to
                        be clear that's what I'm doing.

          Halsey eyes him for a beat, then smiles wistfully.

                                        HALSEY
                          Clarity.  What we all wouldn't
                        give for a little clarity.
                                (hands him his pad)
                        You've had a big first day, John. 
                        Settle in, and we'll get back to
                        it tomorrow.

          Halsey heads off.  Johnny looks after him, but Harriet
          start to steer him toward the door.

                                        HARRIET
                        This way, John.

          They pass the two technicians we saw when we entered.

                                        TECHNICIAN #1
                        Elvis has left the building.

          But some of the derision is gone from his tone as he turns
          back to his work:  reviewing TIME-CODED VIDEO of Johnny
          in the Tank.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

          FADE IN:

  3434OMITTED


  3535INT. GRVU - BREAK ROOM

          Still no windows but it's a much warmer space than the
          war room, designed as an off-hours retreat for the remote
          viewers.  PLANTS flourish under GROW LAMPS.  There are
          comfy chairs, books, board games, and a FOOSBALL TABLE.

          There are three people inside:  Granowitz, who's misting
          the plants; SYLVIA, late 40s, seated at a CONFERENCE TABLE
          laying out Tarot cards; and an older, courtly gentleman
          named MONTY, late 60s, who sits across from her smoking a
          PIPE as he daubs paint on a tiny intricately carved bird.

            Granowitz looks up, sensing something.

                                        GRANOWITZ
                          Company.

          A second later, the door clicks open.

                                        HARRIET
                        Reg, Sylvia, Monty.  Meet John
                        Smith.
                                (no response; to John:)
                        You can wait here while I check
                        on your room. 
                                (about to exit)
                        Oh, and we have one very firm
                        rule:  no comparing notes on
                        current ops.

          She shuts the door, leaving Johnny feeling like the new
          kid at school.  He nods to Granowitz...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey.

          ...and is ignored.  Johnny sighs and goes to a COFFEE
          STATION, then picks up a MUG with a slogan on it.

          INSERT - MUG

          as Johnny turns it to read:  WHEN THE GOING GETS WEIRD,
          THE WEIRD TURN PRO.  He smiles in recognition, turns to
          display the mug.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So who's the Hunter Thompson fan?



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "THE HUNT FOR OSAMA" - ACT TWO - 2/6/03 WHT-2  22.

          Sylvia finally looks up, eyes him appraisingly.

                                        SYLVIA
                        Guilty as charged.  I take it you
                        approve of the maestro's work?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (nods)
                        "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas." 
                        "Fear and Loathing on the Campaign
                        Trail."  Fear and loathing, in
                          general.

                                        SYLVIA
                        In that case, welcome to the
                        asylum.  And, since you've got my
                        mug, why don't you fill it up? 
                        No decaf, no milk, no sugar, no
                        apologies.

          Her wry tone is uniquely hers, but all three viewers share
          the jaded weariness of war vets.  Johnny comes over with
          two coffees, noticing her Tarot cards.

                                        SYLVIA
                        Just a hobby I picked up. 
                                  (sing-song)
                        Oh Mon-tey, we have a guest.

                                        MONTY
                                (immersed in his work)
                        Mmm.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (re: bird)
                        Amazing detail.

          He notices the thick-lensed glasses hanging from a cord
          around Monty's neck.

                                        JOHNNY
                        But wouldn't it help to wear those?

                                        MONTY
                        I only need them in the Tank. 
                          Sometimes I have trouble reading
                        signs or making out faces.  During
                        my viewing sessions, I mean.
                                (smiles)
                        Guess you could say I've got lousy
                          "remote" vision.

                                        SYLVIA
                        Pick a card.  Let Madame Sylvia
                        read your fortune.

          Johnny picks one, but instead of releasing it, she holds
          on tightly, staring intently into his eyes, speaking as
          if from a trance.

                                        SYLVIA
                        The weight.  So much weight. 
                        Like you're carrying the world on
                        your shoulders.  Like you've got
                        to save us, all of us.

          Johnny abruptly lets go.  Sylvia exhales and smiles, taps
          her head...

                                        SYLVIA
                          "Limited empathic ability."  Just
                        enough to help in this line of
                        work, and make family reunions
                          particularly hellish.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm impressed.

                        No you're not.  And neither are
                        we.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Look, Reg right?  I'm not sure
                        what I've done to offend you but --

                        Ted Williams.

                        I'm sorry?

                                        GRANOWITZ
                        You're the kid with the hot bat
                        they've brought up from the minors
                        to "save the team."  So tell us,
                        "John," what's your average?
                                (off Johnny's confusion)
                        How often are your "visions" on
                        the money?

                                        MONTY
                        Or "on target," to use the local
                          parlance.

                        They don't always show me the
                        whole truth, at least not right
                        away, but they've never lied.

                        .406 in his best year.

          He turns back to his plants, shaking his head.  The door
          opens and Harriet pops her head back in.

                                        HARRIET
                        Sylvia, they're ready for you.

                        Well, it's been... great meeting
                          everyone.

          Sylvia stands, indicates the deck of Tarot cards.

                                        SYLVIA
                        Care to cut it?

          Johnny does.  She turns over the top card.  It bears the
          name "The Star," a card that needs little explanation.

                                        SYLVIA
                        Enjoy your fifteen minutes, cowboy.

  3636INT. GRVU - RESIDENCE ROOM

          Harriet is showing Johnny into what resembles a no-frills
          motel room.  A bed, TV/VCR, door to a bathroom.  Johnny's
          suitcase is already open on a stand.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Like a motel room without windows.

                                (re: TV)
                        No satellite or cable, either,
                        though you can borrow a movie
                          downstairs.  Halsey's fond of
                          westerns.

                        is at oh-six-hundred...

          And as Johnny takes the SCHEDULE, we TIME CUT to him
          sitting on the edge of the bed, alone now in the room.

                                        HARRIET (V.O.)
                        Oh seven hundred, orientation. 
                        Nine hundred, physical, followed
                        by a psychiatric evaluation...

          Johnny lies back on the bed as her drone fades into the
          sound of his answering machine.

                                        JOHNNY (ANSWERING MACHINE)
                        Hey, it's Johnny.  I took a little
                          spur-of-the-moment vacation, so
                        don't look for me for a while.

                                        BRUCE (ANSWERING MACHINE)
                        Yo, man, what vacation?  Where? 
                        And why couldn't you take a brother
                        with you?

          The voices bleeding into each other as Johnny closes his
          eyes and as we begin a gradual PUSH IN on his face, we
          INTERCUT a series of images...

          pedestrians moving by on either side like water sluicing
          around a rock in a stream.

          Johnny stands, taking in the scene:  Three to four-story
            buildings line both sides of the street, banners with
          Arabic slogans slung between them.  A row of bazaar stalls
          sell foods, weapons, DVDs, computer chips, even ecstasy

          Johnny sees SUNGLASSES nearby at the auto parts stall. 
          He crosses to him.

                        But there's our man.
                                (following him)
                        He got new sunglasses and shaved
                        his beard, but it's definitely
                        him.

          At the stall, Sunglasses is examining a length of FLEXIBLE
          TRANSPARENT TUBING while questioning the vendor in Pashtu. 
          The man nods enthusiastically, affirming whatever he's
          being asked. 

          But now Johnny's distracted by a LOUD NOISE that almost
          sounds like gunfire.  He looks to the other end of the
          market, where a man is having trouble with a MOPED that
          is backfiring.

          Johnny turns back to see that Sunglasses is gone.  He
          moves into the crowd again, looking one way, then another. 
          But there's no sign of him.

                        Where'd he go? 

          Johnny stands in the center of the street, turning... and
          in a PIVOTING POV ANGLE, matching his turn, camera pans
          past a WINDOW... then double-takes back to it.  A white
          drape rustles in a breeze, beckoning.

          Johnny's concentrating intently, still gripping the broken

          a point on the tablet.

          A shadowy, apartment-like space, or maybe the upstairs of
            a private house.  Johnny finds himself standing by a
          bearded man who's typing on a LAPTOP displaying an ARABIC

          Someone knocks several times on the door in a pre-arranged
          signal.  The man at the laptop stands, covering the door,
          while the other man cautiously unlocks it.  The man with
          the sunglasses enters with a bag of food and supplies.

          a man's voice calls out harshly, and Johnny turns to see
          a fourth man -- severe-looking, clean-shaven, 40s, a
          STETHOSCOPE around his neck -- emerge from another room,
          shutting the door behind him.  We'll call him the DOCTOR.

          The Doctor just grabs it from him, then moves toward a
          bulky object that is covered by a blanket.  He uncovers
          it, revealing a large, high-tech appliance (a DIALYSIS

          when it doesn't quite fit.

                        I know how much you believe in
                        this program, Colonel.  For the

                        You think you've found our target,

                        Sir, I've never been told exactly
                        who the target --

                                        SENATOR
                                (quietly)
                        We all know who it is.  Did you
                        find him or not?

                        But he has seen known associates
                        of the target, and medical
                          evidence.  His description of the
                        village has been verified by
                          satellite and aerial recon... and
                          independent intelligence obtained
                        from captured al Qaeda sources
                          indicate the target has been seen
                        in this region recently.

                                        GENERAL LASSITER
                                (agreeing)
                        That's actionable intelligence,
                          Senator.

                                        DEPUTY SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
                          I agree.  We act now or we risk
                        losing him, like we did with the
                          Predator incident last year, and
                        I'm sure as hell not going to
                        tell that to the President.

          The Senator nods, it's pretty convincing...

          unable to sleep.  Around the darkened room we can make
          out discarded clothes, briefing papers and notebooks:

          Johnny looks at him, and Granowitz has put the wise-ass
          attitude aside... seeing how badly the rookie needs
          support...

                        At least, the good ones do.

                        Any of you?

          He looks to the others for an answer.

                        I've only had these abilities for
                        a year.  It's still all too new
                        to me.  You'll have to teach me
                        how to tune out the faces of the
                        kids who die... and their
                        parents... and even their future
                        lives that I've seen that they'll
                        never get to live... because of

          One of the Deltas shouts and Johnny turns to see an N.D.
          being hit in the shoulder, then spun into a wall.  A bullet
          smacks into Grimes' thigh, he goes down on one knee.

                        Damn it!  We got a sniper!

                        They've got two major threats.  A

                        down the north-facing alley...

          Finster crouches by the alley opening and rolls a grenade
          backhanded down the alley.  It lands by the minigun. 
          BOOM!  The gun is taken out, along with several fighters,
          though others are already regrouping...

          sees a FRIGHTENED VENDOR abandon a makeshift stall with a
          GREEN AWNING at the east end of the market, lift up a
          section of a CORRUGATED METAL WALL behind it and escape
          into a hidden alley.

                                        JOHNNY
                        There's another exit.  An alley
                        on the northeast corner that's
                        blocked by a corrugated metal
                        wall.  Look for the green awning...

          The Command Radio Voice now crackling over the Sergeant's
          headset as he covers an ear to hear better.

                          awning...

          He looks and sees the awning, points to it...

                        There!  Finster, make a hole.

          Finster crouches, aims and fires his grenade launcher. 
          The GRENADE zips toward the wall.  KABOOM!  No more wall.

          And as the team now rushes across the dangerous
            intersecting alley while sending covering fire down it,
          heads across the street, each man again providing covering
          fire, Finster and Grimes are last, Finster helping to
          support his larger wounded friend, as Johnny moves
            alongside them as if he could somehow shield them both
          with his body.

          We can HEAR a chopper arriving in the distance.  It means
          safety.

          Finally, Johnny watches with relief as the last of the
          squad makes it safely into the other alley.  He turns
          then to take in the street, empty now, gunfire slacking...

          And as we PULL UP AND AWAY FROM JOHNNY and the scene WHITES

          Harriet, Sylvia, Monty, and Granowitz have gathered to
          say good-bye.

                                        MONTY
                        Johnny, we hardly knew ye.  You
                        sure you won't reconsider?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Harriet had me pegged from the
                        start.  I'm just not "Company"
                          material.

                                        HARRIET
                          I wasn't being fair.  The fact
                        is, with proper training...

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's not about training, it's
                        about having a temperament for
                        this kind of work.  As a wise
                          philosopher once said, "A man's
                        gotta know his limitations."

                        Which wise philosopher was that?

                        Clint Eastwood, in "Magnum Force." 
                        Or maybe it was "Sudden Impact. 
                                (beat)
                        Anyway, at least this way the
                        Colonel has someone to blame for
                        this little fiasco.  Which is
                        fine by me.

                                        HARRIET
                        John, you gave a few young men
                        their futures back today. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        We did.  All of us.

                                        MONTY
                        No one around here would have
                        given it a second thought...

                                        GRANOWITZ
