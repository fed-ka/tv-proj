          FADE IN:

  11INT. JOHNNY'S FOYER - DAY

          Bleary-eyed and bed-headed, Johnny hurries down the stairs
          in his pajamas as we hear the doorbell CHIME (O.S.).

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm coming.  Hang on...

          He tightens the belt on his robe as he pulls open the
          door to find --


          SARAH

          standing on the stoop.  She's holding a Venti Starbucks
          in each hand and smiling perkily. 

                                        SARAH
                        Latte?

          Off Johnny, squinting at her like a mole in the rising
          sun --


  22INT. JOHNNY'S KITCHEN - DAY

          Johnny and Sarah enter.  She's embarrassed to have woken
          him, but whatever's on her mind is too important to hold
          until a civilized hour.  Of course, she can't come right
          out and say that...

                                        SARAH
                        So I was dropping J.J. off at his
                        six thirty soccer practice --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Six thirty am?

                                        SARAH
                        Uh-huh.
                                (Johnny shudders)
                        When I suddenly got this craving
                        for a sinfully delicious,
                          outrageously fattening coffee
                          beverage.





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: NO QUESTIONS ASKED - TEASER - 12/9/03 YELLOW  2.


    2CONTINUED:2

                                        JOHNNY
                        And you... didn't want to drink
                        alone?

                                        SARAH
                        I'm sorry I woke you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's okay.  I had to get up anyway. 
                        You know, in an hour or two.
                                (reaching for a
                                  Starbucks)
                        Gimme one of them bad boys.

          He takes a sip of the coffee as Sarah shifts nervously. 
          Her worry is showing through her chipper facade, clearly
          enough for even a half-awake Johnny to see that something
          is on her mind.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, not that I don't appreciate
                        the early morning sugar rush and
                        all, but is something bothering
                        you?

                                        SARAH
                        Am I that obvious?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're very subtle.  I'm just
                        highly intuitive.  Share.

                                        SARAH
                        It's Walt.  Last couple of days
                        he's been... not himself.

          Johnny takes a seat, ready to hear the story.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not himself how?

                                        SARAH
                        Short tempered.  Evasive.  I
                        feel... I don't know, like he's
                        keeping something from me. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe he's just in a bad mood. 
                        Happens to the best of us. 

                                        SARAH
                                (shakes her head)
                        After I dropped J.J. off I went
                        over to his place.

  2CONTINUED: (2)2

                                        SARAH (CONT'D)
                        There are these insurance papers
                        he needs to sign and I told him
                        I'd bring them by this morning.

          Johnny takes a second look at the cup in his hand.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Let me guess.  You stopped first
                        and got him coffee.

                                        SARAH
                                (nods guiltily)
                        It's like a little tradition we
                        have.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm drinking a hand-me-down mocha?

                                        SARAH
                        Well, yes, but only because he
                        wasn't there.  At seven am, Johnny. 
                        Where could he be at seven am?

                                        JOHNNY
                        The gym.  Work.  Breakfast.  It
                          probably just slipped his mind
                        you were coming over.

                                        SARAH
                        No, it's more than that.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't get it.  More like what?
                                (off her look)
                        What, like another woman?  Walt? 
                        Our Walt?  Come on...

                                        SARAH
                        I've never seen him like this.  I
                        just... I have to know what's
                        going on.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So ask him.  He'll tell you the
                        truth.

                                        SARAH
                        That's what I'm afraid of.
                                (off his look)
                        My dad always said, never ask a
                          question you don't want the answer
                        to.  I was hoping you could talk
                        to him.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: NO QUESTIONS ASKED - TEASER - 12/9/03 YELLOW  4.


  2CONTINUED: (3)2

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know.

                                        SARAH
                        He trusts you, Johnny.  If he's
                        got a problem, you could help. 
                        And if there's something I should
                        know...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I get the added thrill of breaking
                        it to you gently.  Sarah...

                                        SARAH
                        Please.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (after a moment)
                          Alright.  I'll go see what I can
                        find out from Walt.  Just as soon
                        as I'm done drinking his coffee.

          Off Sarah's relief and Johnny's ambivalence --


  33INT. SHERIFF'S STATION BULLPEN - DAY

          Johnny enters the bustling precinct.  Glances at Walt's
          door, which is closed.  ROSCOE sees Johnny and greets
          him.

                                        ROSCOE
                        Hey Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Roscoe.  Walt around?

                                        ROSCOE
                        Got somebody in his office, but
                        if you want to wait --

          Which is when the door opens and WALT emerges with a pretty
          blonde.  He's guiding her along, his hand at the small of
          her back, but he drops back when he spots Johnny in the
          bullpen.  For the record, the woman's name is ALISON.

                                        ROSCOE
                        Perfect timing.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (looking at Alison)
                        Guess so.

          Walt and Johnny nod a greeting.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: NO QUESTIONS ASKED - TEASER - 12/9/03 YELLOW  5.


    3CONTINUED:3

                                        WALT
                        Gimme a minute.

          Johnny nods as Walt and the woman say a quiet goodbye. 
          He keeps his voice low so they don't overhear --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Roscoe, that woman looks kind of
                          familiar.

                                        ROSCOE
                        You mean Alison?  She's Jeremy
                          Roberts' widow.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Jeremy Roberts?

                                        ROSCOE
                        Cop from over in Newport.  Killed
                        about ten years ago.  Real shame.

          Alison leaves as Johnny heads for Walt's office.

          Walt is standing behind his desk, rifling papers.  As
          advertised, he's somewhat abrupt and distracted through
          the following.  We may even get the impression that he's
          taking care not to let Johnny touch him.

                                        WALT
                        What's up?

          Johnny takes a seat in the guest chair.  Goes for casual.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not much.  Just wondering if you
                        wanted to grab some lunch later.

                                        WALT
                          Something on your mind?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, just felt like catching up
                        with you.  Friend-like.  How's it
                        going?

                                        WALT
                                (tense)
                        Good, except that I'm kind of
                        underwater here, so do you think
                        maybe we could do lunch another
                        time?

                        back to it.

            Disappointed, Johnny stands as Roscoe enters with a
          clipboard.

                                        ROSCOE
                        Boss, can you sign these overtime
                          vouchers?

          Walt steps across the threshold to sign the paperwork.

          THE PAPERS

          Walt had been shuffling.  They're actually part of a file,
          and the name on the front reads:  CANTRELL, FRANCIS.  The
          audience may register this information, but Johnny doesn't
          as he lays a hand on the papers, triggering --


55A VISION - BASEBALL FIELD - NIGHT

          Walt is arguing with a DARK-HAIRED MAN.  Walt shoves him
          back, pinning him against a chain link fence.

                                        WALT
                        Leave Alison alone!  She's got
                        nothing to do with this!

                                          DARK-HAIRED MAN
                        You think I don't know what's
                        going on?

          Dark-Haired Man throws a bottle onto the ground, smashing
          it.

                                          DARK-HAIRED MAN
                          Sonofabitch! 

          The Dark-Haired Man lunges for Walt.  Walt punches him. 
          They struggle.  Dark-Haired Man reaches for Walt's gun.


  66RESUME SCENE

          Walt comes back in, ripping Johnny out of the vision.

                                        WALT
                        You alright?

                        Because you've got that "look."
                                (glances at the
                                  paperwork)
                        You see something?

          Johnny suddenly feels like a kid caught stealing.

                        I saw you get into a fight with

                        Okay, thanks for the heads up. 
                        Listen, I've got to be in court

                        robbery case.  We done here? 

          Johnny blinks.  Walt's never been so dismissive of one of
          his visions before.

                                        JOHNNY

          Walt closes the door behind him.  Leaving Johnny wondering
          if he really does know Walt.

  1111EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION PARKING LOT - DAY

          Walt, having changed out of his uniform, hurriedly pulling
          on a blazer as he exits the building and climbs into his
          personal car as we reveal --


          JOHNNY

          hunkered down in the driver's seat of a RENTAL CAR parked
          several spaces away.  Johnny registers Walt's change in
            wardrobe.  Not exactly court appropriate attire.


  1212INT. RENTAL CAR - CONTINUOUS

          As Walt pulls out, Johnny follows from a safe distance.


  1313EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

          Walt's car is sailing along in the right lane.  Passes --


          A SIGN

          which reads: Newport - 10 miles.  A moment later, we see
          Johnny cruising right behind him.


  1414EXT. ALISON'S HOUSE - DAY

          We're in a poorer area -- a poorer town -- than the one
          we just left.  Small houses all very close to each other. 
          Postage stamp yards.  A neighborhood on the edge.  Walt's
          car is parked at the curb. 


  1515INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY

          Johnny pulls into a spot further up the street.  Turns to
          look out the rear view window as Walt exits his car and
          heads up the walk.


          JOHNNY'S POV

          Walt knocks on the door of a small, well-kept house. 
          Alison opens the door.  She and Walt hug.  Off Johnny,
          who doesn't know what the hell to think --

  15A15AINT. RENTAL CAR - SHORT TIME LATER

          Johnny is in his car, still parked in front of Alison's
          house.  His CELL PHONE rings.  He checks the ID and answers
          it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, Sarah.

  1616INT. BANNERMAN KITCHEN - DAY

          Sarah is unpacking groceries, still worried but trying
          not to sound it.  What she really wants is reassurance,
          and for Johnny to tell her that she's just overreacting.

                                        SARAH
                        Hey, I thought maybe I'd hear
                        from you by now.  Did you see
                        Walt?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Uh yeah, I saw him.

                        And...?


          JOHNNY'S POV

          As the front door opens again and Walt and Alison emerge. 
          She seems upset.  Walt smoothes her hair and she gives
          him a hug goodbye.  It could be a tender moment between
          friends, or it could be something more. 

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny?  Are you there?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah.  Listen, don't worry.  I'm
                        sure everything's okay.

          This palliative statement alone is enough to provisionally
          relax Sarah, since it's what she wants to believe anyway.

                                        SARAH
                        Really?

          But we understand as Johnny watches Walt walk back to his
          own car and start the engine that he's trying to reassure
          himself as well.

          Walt's car drives by him.  Johnny hunkers down.

          And they hang up.  Johnny starts the car --


  1717EXT. STREET - DAY

          Johnny pulls up to a large plot of neglected land.  A
          RUNDOWN HOUSE sits at one edge of the property, and in
          the back is a freestanding GARAGE which has been converted
          into an apartment. 


  1818EXT. GARAGE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

          At the door, Walt removes a CREDIT CARD from his wallet
          and slips the lock.  Then he enters, closing the door
          behind him.   

          A moment later, Johnny creeps up to the garage door.  We
          hear NOISE coming from inside.  Sounds like Walt is tossing
          the place.  Then the noise abruptly STOPS.  Johnny moves
          past the front door and along the side of the building
          toward --


          A SMALL WINDOW

          He pauses, his back pressed against the wall.  Then he
          cautiously leans forward and takes a look inside.


    1919JOHNNY'S POV

          The interior is a cluttered mess.  Old furniture, a couple
          of tattered Vargas posters, a television with an antenna. 
          Johnny strains to see further inside without revealing
          himself, but Walt is not there.

          Suddenly --

2020A VISION - EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

          Walt, in a suit and tie, is being hustled downstairs by
          his LAWYER.  A CRUSH OF REPORTERS shove microphones toward
          him.

                                        REPORTER #1
                        Will you step down as Sheriff?

                        What if the jury finds you guilty?

          Walt moves forward, stoic, but clearly devastated by what's
            happening to him.


  2121BACK TO SCENE

          Johnny turns.  Walt is standing behind him, and he does
          not look happy.

                        The situation is under control.

                        The hell it is.

          Walt turns and heads toward the main house.  Johnny
          follows.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm getting visions of you on
                        trial.  Losing your job.  Now
                        what's going on?

          Walt stops.  Absorbs what Johnny is telling him.  This is
          exactly what he was afraid of, but he's still unwilling
          to ask for help.

                                look)
                        She's worried about you.  So am
                        I.

                        Do me a favor, Johnny, and for

                        can handle my own problems, you
                        know.  Did it for a lot of years
                        before you showed up.

          Walt starts to walk away but Johnny grabs his arm.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Listen, I know we've been through
                        a lot together.  Maybe too much. 
                                (then)
                        But don't be stupid.  Let me help
                        you. 

          Walt exhales.  Glances away.  Knows Johnny's right.

                                        WALT
                        That vision you had.  The fight
                        on the baseball field?  That was
                        from last night.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Who was the guy?

                        An ex-con named Frankie Cantrell. 
                        We had words.  Frankie got in a
                        lucky punch... took my service
                        weapon.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Did you report it?

                        I'm trying to avoid that particular
                          humiliation.  Sheriff loses his
                        gun?  That's a page one story.

                        So you figured if you could just
                        track down this Frankie, you could
                        get your gun back before anyone
                        finds out.

                        Only according to your visions
                        I'm not doing such a great job of
                        it.

                        What's this place?

                          Frankie's crash pad.  His mom
                        lives in the house.  But it looks
                        like he hasn't been home since
                          yesterday morning.  I've got no
                        leads on where he could be.

                        That's usually about the time you
                        call me.  I don't get it.  Why
                        all the secrecy?

                          a chance you'll see some things
                        from my past.  Things I thought
                        I'd put behind me a long time
                        ago.

                        I know that.

          Walt takes a moment.  Chooses his words carefully.

                          There've been times, Johnny, when
                        you asked me to ignore the law,
                        ignore my own instincts, and just
                        trust you.  I guess I'm asking
                        for a little of that trust back.

          Johnny's not altogether comfortable with this, but Walt
          isn't giving him much of a choice.  He nods, accepting
          the conditions.

  2222EXT. LINDA CANTRELL'S HOUSE - DAY

          Walt and Johnny stand at the front door.  Walt KNOCKS and
          a moment later the door is opened by LINDA CANTRELL, 60. 
          Linda is a former beauty who's been beaten down by life. 
          She's fairly certain things weren't supposed to end up
          like this, and she spends a goodly amount of her time
          looking for someone to blame.  Today, it's going to be
          Walt.

                                        LINDA
                        Well well, little Walter Bannerman.

          Johnny reacts -- little?

                                        WALT
                        Hello, Mrs. Cantrell.

                                        LINDA
                                (eying Johnny)
                        Who's your friend?

                                        WALT
                        This is Johnny Smith.

                                        LINDA
                        The psychic boy? 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Nice to meet you.

                                        WALT
                        We're looking for Frankie.

                                        LINDA
                        Join the club.  Haven't seen him
                        for days.  You'd think after being
                        locked up in prison for ten years,
                        he'd want to spend a little quality
                        time with his mother, wouldn't
                        you?

          The men don't answer, until she pointedly makes it clear
          to Johnny that the question wasn't rhetorical.

                                        LINDA
                          Wouldn't you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yes ma'am, I would.

          A look between Walt and Linda, and then Linda steps aside.

          Walt and Johnny enter --


  2323INT. LINDA CANTRELL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          The interior has that well-worn look of a place that's
          been lived in for many years with only the bare minimum
          of care shown to it.  Linda lights a cigarette.

                                        LINDA
                        So, what's Frankie done now?

                        I just need to talk to him.

          Linda heaves the sigh of the relentlessly persecuted.

                        When I picked him up at the prison
                        he was full of big plans.  "Ma,
                        I'm gonna buy me a lobster boat. 
                        I'm gonna get us a new house. 
                        I'm gonna go straight."  A week
                        later, I got cops and psychics at
                        my door.  What's next, bloodhounds?

                                        WALT
                                (to Johnny)
                        I'll start upstairs.

          Walt and Linda move off as Johnny steps into --


  2424INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny's eyes take in the decor.  Orange carpet.  Ragged
          sofa and chair.  And a chrome and glass DISPLAY CASE
          against one wall.  Here's where Linda keeps her dolls
          from the Richard Simmons Collection, and her "Precious
          Moments" figurines.  And something else.

          A BASEBALL TROPHY

          It seems out of place among the breakables.  Plus, upon
          closer inspection we'll see it's small and plastic and
          not even a real trophy at all.  It's something you'd buy
          at a gift shop.  Johnny bends down to read the plaque:
          MOST VALUABLE PLAYER.  He picks up the trophy, triggering --


2525A VISION - CANTRELL LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Johnny turns to see four high school age kids enter the
          room.  They are: YOUNG WALT, a bit of a street tough. 
          YOUNG FRANKIE, thin and hyperactive.  YOUNG ALISON, pretty
          and shy.  She can't quite believe that her boyfriend is
          YOUNG JEREMY.  He's handsome and charismatic.  A born
          leader.

          The boys are all wearing BASEBALL UNIFORMS and carrying
          gym bags, having just come from a game.  Young Jeremy
          carries the CHEAP TROPHY.  He and Walt toss it back and
          forth, keeping it away from Frankie through the following --

                                        YOUNG FRANKIE
                        Give it back, Walt.

                                        YOUNG WALT
                        It's just a cheap piece of plastic.

          Johnny reacts.  Can't help but grin seeing his friend as
          a jock teenager. 

                                        YOUNG FRANKIE
                        Yeah, but still, they gave it to
                        me. 

                                        YOUNG JEREMY
                        As a joke, Frankie.
                                (to Walt and Alison)
                        He really believes the girls think
                        he's MVP?  Dude, you got more
                        errors than RBIs.

                                        YOUNG FRANKIE
                        Shut up, Jeremy, what do you know? 
                        Walt, the game against Portland,
                        didn't I catch that line drive up
                        the center to shut down their
                        rally?

          Jeremy just rolls his eyes, but Walt feels a pull of
          sympathy for Frankie, who wears his need for approval
          like a scratchy sweater. 

                                        YOUNG WALT
                        Yeah, I guess you did.

                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: NO QUESTIONS ASKED - ACT TWO - 12/9/03 YELLOW  19.

                                        YOUNG FRANKIE
                        That's why they gave the trophy
                        to me.  It wasn't a joke.  Right,
                        Alison?

          Walt and Alison's eyes meet, both feeling guilty. 

                                        YOUNG ALISON
                        Of course not.

                                        YOUNG JEREMY
                        What are you gonna do with it
                        anyway?  Sleep with it?  Put it
                        in a place of honor or something?

                                        YOUNG FRANKIE
                        What do you care? 

                                        YOUNG WALT
                        Ah forget it.  Here.

          Walt tosses it to Frankie, as Jeremy catches the smaller
          boy in a headlock and playfully chokes him.  Despite the
          teasing, there's an underlying affection that cannot be
          denied.

                                        YOUNG JEREMY
                        God Frankie, you're just lucky we
                        hang with you, you know that?

                                        YOUNG FRANKIE
                        I know that.

          Frankie happily tightens his grip on his trophy as Jeremy
          lets him go to grab Alison up for a kiss.  Johnny watches
          Walt, who looks at Jeremy and Alison, then looks away,
          feeling very much alone.  Looks like Walt had a thing for
          Alison in high school.  Is he following through on it
          now?


  2626BACK TO SCENE

          Linda enters and sees Johnny holding the trophy.  She
          reaches over and SNATCHES it out of Johnny's hand.  SMACKS
          it back onto the display shelf, rattling the bric-a-brac.

                        You sure are a suck up.  I bet
                        Uri Geller never sucked up like
                        you do.

          Walt appears in the doorway.  Gives Johnny a shake of the
          head to indicate Frankie is not on the premises.

                        Ready to go, John?

          Johnny nods -- oh, yeah -- and they head out as Linda

          -- and Linda SLAMS the door behind them.  Johnny and Walt
          just look at each other.

                        She's a breath of fresh air, huh?

          Walt gives him a look.

  2828EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - DAY

          For this poor town, the field is rather spiffy.  A new
          SCOREBOARD hangs behind the outfield, and the bleachers
          are a shiny chrome.  Johnny and Walt walk along the grass.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not a bad place to play ball.

                                        WALT
                        Believe me, it didn't look like
                        this when we were kids.  I heard
                        the City Council voted to fix it
                        up a couple years ago, but when I
                        was playing?  We had to bring our
                        own cement bags or we didn't have
                        any bases.

          Walt stops at the old DUGOUT and climbs inside.  Johnny
          follows.

          Walt takes a seat on the bench, smiles at the memories.

          all the way up the sides, including Walt, Jeremy, and
            Frankie's (except Frankie's name isn't finished, just 
          FRA).  Must have been a rite of passage for the players.

          Johnny runs his hand along it, and as his fingers touch
          Walt's name it triggers --

          The younger Walt, standing on the bench and carving his
          name on the post.  Frankie and Jeremy are rough-housing

          Johnny watches as Walt finishes and hands the pen knife
          to Frankie.

                        You're up.

                        Bet ya ten bucks he misspells his
                        own name.

                        Shut up. 

          Still laughing, Frankie stands, teetering precariously as
          he carves F-R-A-N before Jeremy bulls into him, knocking
          Frankie on his ass.

                                        YOUNG JEREMY
                        You're done, "Fran."

                        Later, I'm thirsty.  C'mon "Fran,"
                        let's go get some beer. 


  3131RESUME SCENE

          Johnny comes out of the vision.  Sees Walt watching him
          with a questioning look.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Nothing.

                        Tell me.  I want to know.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw you, Jeremy and Frankie
                        carving your names.  Having fun.

                                (lets out a sigh)
                        When I got back from Desert Storm,
                        Jeremy Roberts was the first person
                          I called.  Hearing his voice,
                        that's when I really knew I was
                        home.  He'd just joined the Newport
                        Police Department.

                        the favor.  He put in a good word
                        and they took me on.

                        Yeah, only I was never supposed
                        to be Sheriff -- he was.  Everybody
                        knew it.  Jeremy was going places,
                        getting out of this town.  They'd
                        been saying it since we were kids.

                        But then he was killed.
                                (off Walt's look)
                        It was Frankie, wasn't it?  Is
                        that why he was in prison?

  3232EXT. BLEACHERS - DAY

          Johnny wanders the first row of seats, but is getting
          nothing.  Walt watches him from an upper row.  Johnny
          jumps back down to the field.  Looks down and sees --


          A BROKEN BEER BOTTLE

          in the dirt.  He reaches down and touches one of the
          shards, triggering --


3333A VISION - BASEBALL FIELD - NIGHT

          As the bottle reforms itself and flies back into Frankie's
          hand.  Johnny turns to look behind him as day oozes into
          night.  Walt and Frankie are facing off.  It's the same
          vision as in the teaser, but it's longer and more coherent.

                                        WALT
                        I don't know anything about your
                        damn money!  I never even saw it.

          Johnny reacts -- what money? 

                                        FRANKIE
                        Don't lie to me!  We had a deal! 
                        I did my ten years, you got what
                        you wanted, now I want what's
                        mine.

                        I don't have it!

                        Maybe I'll ask Alison, huh?  Maybe
                        we'll have a little talk. 

          Walt shoves Frankie back, pinning him against the chain
          link fence.  Johnny takes a step toward them.  This is a
          side of Walt he hasn't seen before.

                                        WALT
                        Leave Alison alone!  She's got

                        going on?

          Frankie pushes Walt off and throws the bottle onto the

          Frankie lunges for Walt, and they struggle.  Bam!  Frankie
          throws an uppercut into Walt's ribcage and Walt hits his
          knees.  Frankie jumps to his feet and drops a forearm
          onto the back of Walt's neck.  He pitches forward.

          Frankie comes up with Walt's gun and aims it at Walt's
          head, but can't bring himself to pull the trigger.

                        Sorry Walt, but I need my money.  
                        When I get it, you can have this
                        back. 

          And he hightails it out of there.  


  3434BACK TO SCENE

          Johnny comes out of the vision.  Walt is watching him. 
          Already knows the visions are more revealing than he'd
          like.  Asks the question for which he doesn't really want
          an answer:

                        Doesn't matter what it was about. 
                        Did you see where he went?

                        Guess it's too much to hope you'd
                        get a vision of Frankie hanging
                        out at the Newport Diner, showing
                        my gun off to some pretty waitress,

                        nothing to do with it.

          Johnny and Walt lock eyes.  Walt isn't budging on this
          one.  Alison is as much off limits for Johnny as she was
          for Frankie the night before.  The stand off is broken
          only when Walt's cell phone rings, and he answers it.

                                        WALT
                        Bannerman.  Okay.  I'm on my way.

                        north of here.  Description sounds
                        like Frankie.

                        Think it's him?

                        I hope not.

          They head off.


  3535INT. BAR - DAY

          Johnny and Walt enter.  The lights are up and the few
            CUSTOMERS are being interviewed at various tables by TWO
            DEPUTIES.  The OWNER, a grizzled man of about sixty, is
          wiping down the counter.  Walt and Johnny approach.

                        I'm Sheriff Bannerman, I'm gonna

                        And now you can give it to me.

                        Then let's start with the basics.

          Walt pulls FRANKIE'S MUG SHOT from his pocket and flashes
          it to the owner.

                        the cops.  One of the guys made a
                        move and the thing went off. 
                        Scared the crap out of him.  Don't

          Johnny nods to Walt that he's going to go and check it
          out, and moves off.  We follow Johnny to the back of the
          room. 


          THE SLUG

          is embedded in the wall.  Johnny looks around.  No one's
          watching him.  Then he opens a small PENKNIFE and digs
          the slug out.  Holds it in his fist.  Nothing.  He pockets
          the slug and heads back to Walt.

          Johnny shakes his head.  They start to leave.  Walt pulls
          open the door.  Johnny catches it, and it triggers --


  35A35AA VISION - GARAGE APARTMENT

          Walt is standing over the body of Jeremy Roberts.   He's
          holding a gun, breathing hard.  Clearly scared.  The sofa
          is covered with drugs and cash.  Frankie is there as well,
          freaked out.  Walt runs a hand through his hair.  This is
          a guy who's gotten himself into a bad situation and doesn't
          know how to get out.

  3838EXT. BAR - DAY

          Johnny and Walt exit and head for Walt's car.  They're in
            mid-conversation, and Johnny is finally giving in to the
          frustration of not being able to ask questions about his
          visions.

                        Walt, you can't keep stonewalling
                        me like this. 

          Walt gives Johnny a look -- let's discuss this in the car. 
          They both climb in and Walt pulls out into the street.

                        you know it.  I'm seeing visions
                        of the past for a reason.
                                (beat)

          heated than it already has.

                        giving me some answers?

          Johnny is floored.  Walt's never confronted him like this
          before.  He doesn't answer as Walt pulls the car over
          beside Johnny's rental.  Walt nods.  Johnny's silence has
          given him the answer he already knew in his heart.

                        That's what I thought.

          Johnny and Walt look at each other, and then look away.

                        I'm not sure.  Maybe in the attic.

                                        SARAH
                        I found it in the back of the
                        guest room closet.

          Sarah steps aside as Johnny moves toward the uniform.  He
          touches it.  Nothing.  Tries the holster.  Nothing.

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny, what's going on?

          He shakes his head, ready to give up when he sees the
          BADGE, oxidized and worn.  He touches it and it triggers --


4444A VISION - GARAGE APARTMENT - NIGHT

            Fractured and chaotic.  The vision almost seems to be
          tied in to the pumping adrenaline of the participants. 
          Everything is bright and confusing, much as someone who
          was frightened and panicked might experience it.  This is
            a continuation of Johnny's vision in the bar.  We ZOOM
          OUT from Walt's badge, which hangs on his uniform pocket. 
          Clean and sparkling here in the past.  Hardly been used.

          Johnny watches as a scared Walt takes in the scene before
          him.  There's an OPEN GYM BAG full of cash.  Another GYM
          BAG has spilled BAGS OF WHITE POWDER out onto the couch.

          Walt makes a decision.  He starts shoving the drugs into
          an empty bag.

                                        FRANKIE
                        What're you doing?  

                                        WALT
                        I'm taking it with me.  I'm taking
                        everything with me.

          Frankie puts a hand on his arm, but Walt flings him off.

                                        WALT
                        This was never here, you got it?

                                        FRANKIE
                        But --

          Walt grabs him by the shirt with one hand.

    44CONTINUED:44

                                        WALT
                        Listen to me!
                                (Frankie holds it
                                  together)
                        You need to do exactly as I say. 

          Walt releases him.  Turns and ZIPS UP the gym bag full of
          cash.


  4545BACK TO SCENE

          Johnny shakes off the vision.  Disturbed.  Sarah is
          watching his reaction, and she doesn't like it a bit.

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Did Walt ever talk to you about
                        Jeremy Roberts' shooting?

          Sarah blinks at hearing the name -- it's been a long time.

                                        SARAH
                        Not really.  It happened before I
                        met him.  When he still lived in
                          Newport.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What did he say about it?

                                        SARAH
                        Just that one of his friends had
                        shot the other one in a fight.
                                (then)
                        But what does that have to do
                        with anything that's happening
                        now?

                                        JOHNNY
                        That advice your dad gave you,
                        about not asking questions you
                        don't want to know the answers
                        to...
                                (she nods)
                        Now's a good time to follow it.

          He starts to move past her but she grabs his arm.

                                        SARAH
                        Wait a minute.  We're talking
                        about my husband.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, we're talking about a man
                        you've never met.

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny --

          Johnny starts to back away, heading for the door.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And I can't be in the middle
                          anymore.  You asked me to help
                        Walt, okay.  But if there's
                          something you want to know, talk
                        to him yourself.  You're his wife.

          Sarah knows he's right, much as she hates being in this
            position.  She also knows what's important right now.

                                        SARAH
                        But... you are helping him?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm trying.

          Sarah nods, grateful.  That's good enough for her.  Johnny
          turns and heads out.


  4646EXT. STREET - DAY

          Johnny pulls his rental car in front of Linda Cantrell's
          house.


          THE GARAGE APARTMENT

          stands empty and, thanks to Walt's B&E earlier, unlocked.


  4747INT. GARAGE APARTMENT - DAY

          Johnny pushes open the door and enters.  Looks around. 
          No one here.  The place is a mess.  Johnny moves aside A
          THROW RUG to find underneath --


          A FADED BLOOD STAIN

          This is where Jeremy Roberts bled to death.  The cement
          has been scrubbed, but the sin remains.  Johnny lays a
          hand over it, triggering --          DEAD ZONE: NO QUESTIONS ASKED - ACT THREE - 12/9/03 YELLOW  35.


4848A VISION - INT. GARAGE APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Again, it feels chaotic and hyper-real -- subject to
            different interpretations.  This is the middle part of
          the fight between Frankie and Jeremy that led to the
            shooting.  Jeremy is aggressive, angry at Frankie for
          some perceived betrayal.  Frankie is incredulous, self-
          righteously innocent, but his twitchy demeanor and shifty
          aspect make him look guilty regardless.

                                        FRANKIE
                        Jeremy, I would never do that! 
                        You can't think I would do
                          something like that to you!

                                        JEREMY
                        You want me to trust you?  You're
                        a drug dealer!

                                        FRANKIE
                        With all due respect my friend,
                        so are you.

          Johnny reacts -- this is new information. 

                                        JEREMY
                        Not anymore.  This partnership is
                        over.  I'm taking what's mine and
                        forgetting I even know you.

          Frankie grabs a small gym bag full of cash and practically
          flings it at Jeremy.

                                        FRANKIE
                        Here.  Twenty-five grand.  That's
                        your half.

                                        JEREMY
                        You're a loser, Frankie.  You
                        always were a loser, even when we
                        were kids!

                                        FRANKIE
                        At least I'm not a hypocrite,
                        dealing drugs from behind a badge. 
                        What do you think the people in
                        this town would say if they found
                        out who you really are?

          Jeremy pulls a gun from the back of his waistband.  Holds
          it on Frankie.

                                        JEREMY
                        You threatening me?
                                (scared, Frankie shakes
                                his head)
                        You know what?  I want it all.

                        I'm taking your cut too.  And the
                        drugs.  You're out of business,
                          Frankie. 

                                        FRANKIE
                        This isn't right, man.  I'm gonna
                        buy a lobster boat with that money. 
                        You can't take my ticket outta
                        here --

                                        JEREMY
                        After what you did to me!

                                        FRANKIE
                        I'm telling you, you got it wrong!

          Johnny reacts -- what did Frankie do to Jeremy?

          Jeremy advances on Frankie, who winces as the gun touches
          his stomach.  Jeremy is calm.  Deadly calm.  But his eyes
          are wild.  Johnny almost wants to put a hand out to stop
          it; knows this going to go very wrong.

                                        JEREMY
                        Give me that money.  Or I'll beat
                        your ass, and tear this place
                        apart until I find it.

                                         FRANKIE
                        No way.

                                        JEREMY
                        Who's gonna stop me?  You?

                                        FRANKIE
                        Don't do this.

          Jeremy pistol whips Frankie on the side of his head.

                                        JEREMY
                        Now give me that money.

    48CONTINUED: (2)48

          Frankie lunges for the gun and tries to wrestle it from
          Jeremy's hand.  They struggle.  The gun GOES OFF.  And
          then Jeremy drops to the floor.  His eyes are wide.  Dead.


  4949BACK TO SCENE

          As Johnny's vision abruptly ends and he snaps back to
          reality.

          Johnny puts his hands up.  Turns.  Comes face to face
          with Frankie, and he's pointing WALT'S GUN right at
          Johnny's head.  Johnny and Frankie face each other.  Johnny
            indicates the gun with a nod.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Be careful with that.  It belongs
                        to a friend of mine.

          Frankie squints.  Takes a good look at Johnny.

                        Oh yeah.  Walt told me about you. 
                        Said you came out of a coma and
                        the next thing he knew his life
                        was a mess.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, that's pretty much what
                          happened.

                                        FRANKIE
                        He also said you were a good guy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can be.  I was hoping maybe you
                        and I could talk...

                                        FRANKIE
                        Talk about what?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Well for starters, about you giving
                        Walt back his gun.

          Over the following Frankie paces, gestures often with the
          gun which makes Johnny more than a little nervous.

                                        FRANKIE
                        In a day or two.  I just need to
                        get some business done first.

                        Shut up.  He was my friend.

          The first part of the Frankie and Jeremy fight.  Frankie
          is on his sofa, scooping cocaine into baggies when the
          door FLIES OPEN and Jeremy enters.  He's furious, advances
          on Frankie who stands, his hands held out protectively in
          front of him.

                        Jeez, you scared the crap out of
                        me.

                        Just tell me, Frankie.  How long
                        has it been going on?  Weeks?

                        Things got out of hand.  Jeremy
                        was shot and you called Walt for
                        help.  What did he do, flush the
                        drugs?

          Jeremy nods, a little freaked that Johnny knows all this.

                        Thanks to him I did ten years for

                        I know.  But I need that money to

                        My old supplier.  I'm thinking
                        he's got my cash.  Why, did you

          JOHNNY*

          is watching them, still holding Alison's shoulders in the*
          present. *

                                        ALISON
                        What is this?

                                        WALT
                        Jeremy asked me to hold that for
                        him a couple weeks ago.  Said he
                        won it gambling.

                                        ALISON
                              (a sad smile)
                        Jeremy?  He never wins.
                                (then)
                        I can't take this. 

          Walt smoothes her hair.  Clearly in love with this woman.

                                        WALT
                        You've got two boys to raise. *
                        Just take it.  Don't ask questions.

          A long moment.

                                        ALISON
                        What about you and me?

                                        WALT
                        I don't know. 

          Alison nods.  She knows what that means.

                        How did everything get so screwed
                        up?  

          Walt just shakes his head, wishes he knew.  Alison starts
          to cry and Walt pulls her close and they hold on to each
          other.

                                        JOHNNY*
                                (to Alison)*
                        You were in love. *


  54B54BBACK TO SCENE

          As Johnny lets go of Alison.  She nods, starts to cry.*

                                        ALISON*
                        My marriage was falling apart and*
                        Walt... he was there for me. *
                        He'd always been there, since we*
                        were kids. *

                                        JOHNNY
                        But then Jeremy was killed. *

                                        ALISON
                        And Walt broke it off.  I guess*
                        he felt too guilty.  But even*
                        after all these years, he looks*
                        after me and my sons... *

                                        JOHNNY
                        Are you still in love with him?

                                        ALISON
                                (shakes her head)
                        But sometimes I can't help
                          thinking, "what if...", you know? 
                        If I could just go back and change
                        one little thing, life might be
                        so different...
                              (a sad smile)
                        Does that sound crazy?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, no it doesn't.

          The doorbell CHIMES.  Alison wipes her eyes.

                                        ALISON
                        That's gonna be him.
                                (then)*
                        Please don't tell him I told you.*

                        Don't worry.  I can keep a secret.*

          Johnny waits as she opens the door, and talks quietly to
          Walt in the doorway, telling him that Johnny is there. 
          Walt's voice is raised.  Johnny looks up as Walt strides
          toward him --

                                        WALT
                        You've crossed a line, Johnny --

                                        ALISON
                        Walt, don't.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I talked to Frankie.  He thinks
                        the money was stolen by his old
                          supplier.  Some guy named Vic.

                                        WALT
                        His supplier?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You have any idea who that might
                        be?

                                        WALT
                        Yeah, I know exactly who it is.

          Off the two of them --


  5555EXT. USED CAR DEALERSHIP - NIGHT

          Johnny and Walt walk across the lot toward the office. 
          Lots of cars, but no people to be seen.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Frankie's old supplier is a used
                        car dealer?

                                        WALT
                        About five years ago he went
                          straight.  But not too straight.

          Johnny looks over, sees a NEON SIGN that reads "USED CARS."



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: NO QUESTIONS ASKED - ACT FOUR- 12/10/03 GREEN  48-48A.


    55CONTINUED:55

          The "S" covers a small window.  Johnny grabs Walt's arm.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Walt, this is the place from my
                        vision.  I saw you shoot Frankie
                        inside.

          They push open the door, and we hear YELLING from inside. 
          Walt draws his weapon --

                                        WALT
                        Stay back.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Just be careful.

                                        WALT
                        Always.

          -- and they both head inside.


  5656INT. CAR DEALERSHIP OFFICE - NIGHT

          Walt enters with Johnny right behind him.  Frankie is
          holding Walt's gun on Victor Russell.  Let's just say
          Victor is proof of the fact that if you put a former drug
          dealer in a suit, he'll end up looking like a used car
            salesman.  Frankie and Victor turn to see Johnny and Walt --

                        FRANKIEVICTOR
            Walt, stay out of this!Oh thank god!  The cavalry!

                                        WALT
                          Frankie, give me back my gun.

                                        FRANKIE
                        He's got my money.  He took my
                        cash and he opened this business. 
                        That's all I want to do, Walt.   
                        I just wanna buy a lobster boat
                        and start a business. 
                                (to Victor; losing it)
                        You stole that from me!

                                        VICTOR
                        I don't have it!

                                        WALT
                        It's true, Frankie.  Victor did
                        three years for possession, and
                        when he got out his dad staked
                        him for the down payment on this
                        place.

                                        VICTOR
                        I got loans flying out of my butt. 
                        I'm serious.  I owe every bank in
                        town.  I wish I had stolen your
                          twenty-five grand, 'cus I could
                        use it.
                                (then, to Walt)
                        You know what I mean, Sheriff.

                                        WALT
                        I know what you mean.  Now shut
                        up.
                                (to Frankie)
                        Put the gun down.

                                        FRANKIE
                        I don't believe any of you!
                                (to Vic)
                        You've got my money and I want it
                        back!

          Walt pulls his weapon.  Aims it at Frankie.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Walt, don't.

                                        WALT
                        He's not gonna hurt anybody else. 
                        Not over a bag of drug money that's
                        long gone.

                                        VICTOR
                                (to Walt)
                        Tell him.  Tell him I don't have
                        his money.

                                        WALT
                                (to Frankie)
                        Last warning.

                                        FRANKIE
                        That money was my future, Vic!

          Johnny takes a look at Frankie's twitchy trigger finger. 
          Realizes this will play out just as he saw it happen in
          the visions.

                        Put the gun down, Frankie. 

          Without even thinking Johnny STEPS BETWEEN Walt and

          Johnny turns to Frankie.

                        Look, I know how you feel.  It's
                        like you had to go through so
                        much bad stuff, you think there
                        should be something good waiting
                        for you on the other side to make
                        up for it.  But take it from me,
                        life doesn't work like that.

                                        FRANKIE
                                  (weakening)
                        I just, for once, wanna come out
                        on top.  You know?  I wanna be
                        the guy buying a round of drinks. 
                        Or driving a nice car.  I'd like
                        to not be living in a garage.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You can have all those things. 
                        They're all ahead of you.  But
                        you have to leave the past where
                        it belongs.

                                        WALT
                        Listen to him, Frankie.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (re: Victor)
                        Anyway he doesn't have the money.
                                (off Frankie)
                        Trust me.  I'm a psychic.

          The fight begins to seep out of Frankie.  He lowers the
          gun just slightly, and Walt is on him in a flash, disarms
          him and holsters both weapons.  He turns to Victor.

                                        WALT
                        You wanna press charges?

          Sounds more like a threat than a question.  Victor just
          shakes his head.

                                        VICTOR
                        Nah, I had a little trouble
                          readjusting my first week out

                        I'm not sure this is such a great
                        idea.

                                        FRANKIE
                        I'm over it.  I swear.  But I
                        gotta know.
                                (to Johnny)
                        You understand, right?

                                        JOHNNY
                        As long as we're all in agreement
                        on this.

                                        FRANKIE
                          Wherever that money is, that's
                        where it stays.  You have my word.

          Johnny looks to Walt, who shrugs.  Go ahead. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Okay, where's the secret hiding
                        place?

          Frankie hesitates.  Walt starts to lose his temper.

                                        WALT
                          Frankie, for god's sake there's
                        nothing in it.  Show him where
                        the hiding place is.

                                        FRANKIE
                        Right, right okay.

          He leads Johnny to the corner, and indicates a LOOSE
          FLOORBOARD.

                                        FRANKIE
                        Under there.

          Johnny kneels down and lifts up the floorboard.  Puts his
          hand inside the space below.  WE HEAR a Dead Zone WHOOSH.

          A long moment.  Frankie turns to Walt --

                                        FRANKIE
                        Is he doing it?  How do you know
                        when he's doing it?

                                        WALT
                        Quiet.

          Johnny looks up at them.  Smiles.

                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: NO QUESTIONS ASKED - ACT FOUR - 12/9/03 YELLOW  52.


    57CONTINUED:57

                                        FRANKIE
                        What?  You know where it is?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Oh, yeah... 

          Off Johnny's amused grin --


  5858INT. GARAGE APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Johnny, Walt, Frankie and Linda are in the garage.  Frankie
          sits beside his mother on the sofa and holds her hand.

                                        FRANKIE
                        Ma, when Johnny told me you'd
                        ripped me off, I couldn't believe
                        it.

          Linda yanks her hand back.  Offended.

                                        LINDA
                          I didn't rip you off.
                                (to Walt and Johnny)
                        I was cleaning the apartment,
                        that's all.  And the mop kept
                        running over a loose floorboard.
                                (shrugs)
                        I got curious and pulled it up. 
                        Inside there was a bunch of money.

                                        FRANKIE
                        My money.

                                        LINDA
                          Nobody's money.  That money was
                        cursed.  It would have brought
                        nothing but pain to you, Frankie. 
                        I knew that.  First, I was gonna
                        burn it --

                                        FRANKIE
                        Oh god, no...











                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: NO QUESTIONS ASKED - ACT FOUR - 12/9/03 YELLOW  53.


    58CONTINUED:58

                                        LINDA
                        But then I started thinking about
                        you kids, and how happy you'd all
                        been.  Before everything went so
                        wrong.  I'd never seen better
                        friends...

                                        FRANKIE
                        Yeah yeah fine.  Mom, what did
                        you do with the money?  Did you
                        spend it?  Please tell me you
                        bought something that I can sell.

          Walt shoots Frankie a look, and he quiets. 

                                        LINDA
                        You can't sell what I bought. 
                        Because you can't sell peace of
                        mind.  Besides, I didn't spend
                        the money.  It was more like... a
                          donation.

          Johnny looks over at Walt.  Walt smiles.  They know what
          she did with the money.


  5959EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - NIGHT

          The three men walk the field, tossing a baseball back and
          forth between them.

                                        FRANKIE
                        It is a pretty nice field.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Enjoy it, Frankie, you paid for
                        it.

                                        WALT
                        Now a whole new generation of
                        kids gets to use it.

                                        FRANKIE
                        I never thought of myself as a
                          philanthropist before.  Maybe we
                        could put up a plaque or something.

          Walt throws the ball at him, hard.

                                        WALT
                        Forget it.  You're staying an
                          anonymous donor.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So what's your plan?

                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: NO QUESTIONS ASKED - ACT FOUR- 12/10/03 GREEN  54.


    59CONTINUED:59

                                        FRANKIE
                        Get a job, I guess.  I'll start
                        looking tomorrow.
                                (then)
                        But, it would really help if the
                        County Sheriff was willing to
                        give me a recommendation...

                                        WALT
                        I'll see what I can do.

          Walt tosses the ball to Johnny, triggering --


  59A59AA VISION - BASEBALL FIELD - DAY

          As Walt and Frankie continue walking down the field, Johnny
          turns and sees the younger versions of Walt, Frankie and
          Jeremy, rough-housing, heading in the opposite direction. 
          Johnny just smiles as we PULL AWAY.


  6060EXT. BANNERMAN HOUSE - DAY

          It's early morning.  Walt is standing at the front door,
          holding a Venti Starbucks in each fist as Sarah opens the
          door.  Reacts.

                                        WALT
                        Thought you might like some coffee.

          She takes one.  Smiles.


  6161INT. BANNERMAN KITCHEN - DAY

          Walt and Sarah enter, both a little nervous in each other's
            presence.  There's an awkward moment, when they realize
          neither one knows how to start this conversation.

                        WALTSARAH
              I just wanted to tellI've been thinking and I
            you that --really --

          They smile and stop.  Awkwardness acknowledged and now
            hopefully dispelled.

                                        SARAH
                        You go ahead.

                                        WALT
                          I wanted to apologize for the
                        last couple of days.  An old friend
                        of mine got back into town...


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: NO QUESTIONS ASKED - ACT FOUR - 12/15/03 WHT-2  55.


    61CONTINUED:61

                                        SARAH
                          A friend...?

                                        WALT
                        This guy.  We had to work some
                        stuff out.

          Sarah doesn't say anything.  Walt knows he's being evasive
          again.

                                        WALT
                        It's just... There are things
                        about me you don't know, Sarah. 
                        Things I've done in my life that
                        I've been... ashamed to tell you
                        about.

          Sarah moves toward him.  Takes his hand.

                                        SARAH
                        I love you.  Nothing you could
                        have done in the past will change
                        that.

                                        WALT
                        And I feel the same way about
                        you.

          She looks away.  Feels too guilty to meet his eye.  He
          takes her chin and brings her gaze back to his.

                                        WALT
                        I don't care what happened.  Just
                        tell me, is it over?

          She summons everything she has to make sure he understands
          and believes her.

                                        SARAH
                        Yes, it's over.

                                        WALT
                        Because I think it's time we left
                        the past where it belongs, and
                        start concentrating on our future.

          He pulls Sarah into his arms and they hold each other. 
            Reunited.  Off Sarah, happy, contented and forgiven --

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                        END OF ACT FOUR

                                              THE END
