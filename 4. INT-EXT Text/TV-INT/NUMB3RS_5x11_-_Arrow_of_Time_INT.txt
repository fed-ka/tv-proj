      ... to DON, wearing a suit and tie, looking in a 

      HEBREW PRAYER BOOK --

      Foreign letters looking like so much abstraction... he looks 
      up at the stained glass for guidance... listens to the CANTOR 
      singing in an alien tongue...

      Don gives up; closes the prayer book... gets up and walks

      Before Larry and Amita have a chance to recover from their 
      initial surprise, David and Liz enter...

      ... and Liz tosses the DENTAL FLOSS ROPE LADDER (bagged as

                    We might be able to apply a Simplex

      Colby paces behind Deanne... Nikki sits across the table...

                    You watch TV, Deanne... you have to 
                    know that if you sneeze, we can DNA 
                    match a booger off the dashboard. You 
                    can go down that road with us...

      Deanne doesn t answer, but you can see the nervousness in her 
      face.

                    So far, you don t look like a good

      Deanne silent for one more long beat -- Colby and Nikki let 
      her be -- then --

      Nikki heads for her desk, pauses...

                    Hey, boss... for what it s worth, I 
                    read the file, talked to some

                    Floss is generally fabricated from

      Robin stands in the background as Nikki interrogates Gray; 
      with two women in the room, he exudes an easy charm...

                                  NIKKI
                    How d you get Pynchon to hide you 
                    out?

                                  GRAY
                    Ask Pynchon.

                                  NIKKI
                    He s hard to understand with tubes in 
                    his throat. You don t get 
                      interesting, you might get hard to 
                      understand, too.

      Gray considers a beat; then, with half a smirk...

                    same stories 23 hours a day. For 
                    grins, I tell Pynchon about a drug 
                    stash the cops didn t find on my last

                    This is when he finds out about

                          (beat)
                    For a smart guy, Pynchon believed 
                    what he wanted to believe, you know? 
                    Got obsessed, started planning his 
                    way out...

                    After he jackpotted that appeal, he 
                    obsessed on me getting out, leading 
                    him to the buried treasure.

                                  NIKKI
                    You strung him along. Him and Deanne.

                    Is anyone really surprised by my lack 
                    of character?

                    crime I can prove is a by-product of

                    So there s this thing called a 
                    Viterbi Algorithm... a way of finding 
                    the most probable sequence of hidden 
                    states...

                    which one to do based on the season, 
                    the time of day, and the weather... 

    ... SYMBOLS of day/night, a figurative calendar of four 
      seasons, and weather icons spin out as well -- they begin to 
      mesh with the three men in various combinations --

      Don starts out the door --

      -- and David puts a hand on his chest. Stops him cold.

      Don looks David squarely in the eye; not defiant, not 
      anxious; just calm, even impassive.

                    or maybe he figured it out those last 
                    few seconds... I don t know. 

      Silence. Buck puts his hand on the butt of his gun.

                                  BUCK (cont d)
                    You ve got three seconds to go for 
                    it...

                    It s not going to be like that.

      Don makes a brief hand signal...

      ON DAVID AND THIBODEAUX --

                                  DAVID (ON RADIO)
                    Adam and Charlie are going in -- 
                    Bravo hold your position.

      They move out... along with

      SWAT TEAM CHARLIE --

      Colby and his team advancing -- MP5s aimed and ready as they 
      close in on Buck s back...

      DON --

      Makes a fist -- holding the two assault teams up fifty or 
      sixty feet away... 

      ON BUCK --

      Wavering in the face of the firepower... hand still on the 
      butt of the gun.

                                  DON
                    That s 180 bullets ready to come 
                    downrange on you. You ll never get 
                    the gun out of your belt. 

                                  BUCK

                    Two years planning this, and you let

                    But I had to kill her... I don t have 
                    to kill you.

      Buck pauses a beat... his eyes start to water...

                                  BUCK
                    Why? Why can t you do this for me? 
                    You owe me this!

                    how I live with it.  

      There s still a long, pregnant moment in which it looks like 
      Buck might do it...

      ... and then he collapses to his knees... SCREAMING out with 
      animal pain...

      ... as Colby and Thibodeaux rush in... slam him to the ground 
      and handcuff him...

                    but when the window breaks, the cold 
                    air still rushes in. Gears fail... 
                    oil leaks...


      OFF the stained glass -- and Alan,  vision-esque ...

      Don looks at the crying, devastated Buck with empathy... even 
      sadness....

      ... looks at David...

                    No... it wasn t easy.

      David walks away... past Colby, who meets Don s eyes...

                    Whatever you were planning, you 
                    should ve brought us in right away.

                    If not because we re your teammates, 
                    then because we re your friends.

      Colby turns and walks off as well... joining David and Nikki 
      and Liz...

      ... and, after a moment, Don is left alone.

                    Dad... a few of us at Calsci have 
                    been talking about putting a think 
                    tank together... meet once a month, 
                    kick some ideas around...

                    The very first good idea that came 
                    up... well, we were wondering if you 
                    might be interested in joining us.

                                  ALAN
                          (demurring)
                    You know, I still remember the day 
                    you asked me about an estimate for 
                    the remainder term in a Taylor 
                    expansion of the hyperbolic cosine.

      Larry and Amita exchange smiles... 

                                  AMITA
                    That s a very specific memory, Alan.

                                  ALAN
                    One never forgets the moment he 
                    realized he had nothing left to teach 
                    his 7 year-old son about math.

                                    CHARLIE
                    But look at how much you ve taught me 
                    about everything else since then.

      Alan considers for a beat, smiles softly:

                                  ALAN
                    I think you ve given me another very 
                    specific memory.

                                  AMITA

                    To our new venture.

      The others raise their coffee cups as well...

                                  LARRY
                    To the causal arrow of time... within 
                    the small sphere of our lives, we can 
                    stare into the past...


      Don looks up at the frieze again...
