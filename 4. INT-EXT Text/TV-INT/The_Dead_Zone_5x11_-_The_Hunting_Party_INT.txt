      Frost's eyes burn with intensity as he rants in front of a
      video camera.  His engineer, PHIL, checks the camera, then
      steps back into the adjoining room which is separated by a
      large picture window.

                                      FROST
                    You're monitoring the Evening Frost,
                    the first truly independent political
                    webcast of the people, by the people,
                    and for the people.  I'm Marshall
                    Frost and we're talking about my
                    favorite subject, the raping of the
                    American ideal.

      Frost wipes the sweat from his brow.

                                      FROST
                    It's not too late to take this country
                    back from the power hungry, right
                    wing conservatives who stole it. 
                    Fight back.  Make the ultimate
                      sacrifice.  Blood for blood.  Life
                    for life.  Let's take an email.

      Frost checks his monitor.

                    Carol from Bridgewater asks, 'What
                    kind of American are you?'
                          (laughs)

      We see Frost as he appears on the computer screen on Phil's
      desk.

                    gone?  Did she post her picture on
                    the website?  No?  Too bad, she sounds
                    kind'a hot.

                    Hear that, Carol, honey-baby-sweetie? 
                    That's the wolf.  And you, my
                      misinformed little love slave, are
                    one of the sheep!

      RESUME STUDIO

                    When are we gonna kick this 'love it

                    the answer is self sacrifice?  I'm

                    Seems old Danny boy is also under
                      investigation for embezzlement,
                    bribery and forgery.  I've been pretty
                    tough on this guy the past few months 
                    and I intend to keep it up.  Eric
                    Danbury is exactly the enemy our
                    founding fathers were trying to
                    protect us from... a tyrant driven
                    by arrogance, ego and greed.

      Phil begins to gesture at him through the window that he has
      a phone call.  He gets on his computer and begins typing.

                    God, if it were only that easy.

      Frost notices something on his monitor.

                    Let's take one last break.  This is
                    the Evening Frost.

      Frost is quickly up and out of his chair as he lights a smoke
      and grabs the phone.

                                      FROST
                    Marshall Frost.



      All we SEE is a COMPUTER MONITOR, and TIGHT SHOTS of the
      MAN'S MOUTH, his HANDS, the BACK OF HIS HEAD, stuff that
      doesn't give away his identity.  THE CONVERSATION IS INTER-

                    Mister Wolf.  It's been almost a

      Taking a mindless step backwards, he stumbles over something

      gathering himself, he raises a palm into view and realizes

      Dead.  His eyes wide, a single bullet wound in the center of

      looks back, just as the butt of a pistol swings through FRAME;

                    What else do you know about him?

                                    WALT
                    Fancies himself some kind of a gonzo

                    Danbury.

      SPOTLIGHT POV - DARK FIGURE

      The light suddenly finds a FIGURE walking in the shadows. 
      He looks back and we see it's Marshall Frost.  He seems
      confused and terrified.

                                    WALT
                    Speak of the devil.

                                      JOHNNY
                    And the devil appears.

                          (through a loud speaker)
                    This is Sheriff Bannerman!  Stay
                    where you are!

      Frost hesitates, then takes off up a small passage between
      two buildings.      DEAD ZONE: "The Hunting Party" - ACT ONE - 8/9/05 - PINK 9.




      Walt drops the hand mic.

                    Don't run.  Hang on.

      He punches the gas as the cruiser tears around the corner
      and roars towards the far side of the complex.

      FAR SIDE OF COMPLEX

      Walt's car fishtails around the far end of the building, as
      Frost dashes out from between buildings.

      WALT/JOHNNY'S POV - FROST

      As he runs, glancing back over his shoulder.  He's obviously
      in a panic.

      WIDER SHOT

      As Walt uses the car to cut Frost off, then he jumps out of
      the car and backs him into a corner, his flash light in
      Frost's eyes.

                                      FROST
                    Don't kill me!  I didn't see anything!

      Walt lowers the light as Frost finally sees who they are.

                    Phil.  They killed my engineer.

                                                                                CUT TO:


      Walt flips on the lights.  The floor is spotless.  No Phil. 
      No blood.  No sign of anything.

                                    WALT
                    You sure this is where he was?

                                      FROST
                    Yeah, I'm sure.  The body was right
                    here.  There was blood.  It was all
                    over my hand.

      He shows his open palms; clean.

                                      FROST
                          (realizes)
                    They must have cleaned it off.  After
                    I was knocked out.

      Walt and Johnny exchange a look, as...

                          (defensive)
                    I'm not crazy.

                                    WALT
                    Relax.  We believe you.

                                      FROST
                    I can take a Goddamn lie detect...
                          (taken aback)
                    You believe me?

                                      JOHNNY
                    The shooter came in through here. 
                    He was dressed in dark fatigues and
                    wore a black ski mask.  It was quick,
                      professional.

                                      FROST
                    Who the hell are you?

                                    WALT
                    His name is John Smith.

                    Smith.  The psychic who was stalking
                    Greg Stillson?

      Johnny ignores the comment.

                                      JOHNNY
                    The killer could have shot you, but
                    he didn't.  Any idea why?

                                      FROST
                    No.

                                    WALT
                    What was your engineer's last name. 
                    I need to talk to his family.

                                      FROST
                    He didn't have any family.  No friends
                    I know of.  He was a fan, just showed
                    up one day about a year ago and never
                    left.  He was a good guy. 

                                    WALT
                    I'll get CSU to sweep the place.  If
                    there's anything here, we'll find
                    it.

                                      FROST
                    What about me?

                                    WALT
                    Go home.  I'll be in touch.

                                      FROST
                    Sure.

      Frost stumbles slightly.  He's too drunk and too woozy to
      drive.

                                      JOHNNY
                    I'll drive him home.

                                      FROST
                    No offense, but I'd prefer the guy
                    with the big gun.

                                    WALT
                          (pointed)
                    Wait in the car.

      Frost drops his car keys in Walt's hand and walks away.

                                    WALT
                    I can have a deputy take him.

                    Something isn't right here.  I'll
                    see what I can pick up, then catch a
                    cab home.

      Johnny walks away, as Walt looks around...



      The inside is as unsavory as the exterior.  Endless stacks
      of books and papers occupy the cramped space.  A spattering
      of spent liquor bottles and beer cans.

                                      JOHNNY
                    All clear.  Can you think of
                      anybody...

                                      FROST
                    Shhh!  They might be listening.

      He switches on the stereo and blasts MUSIC.  He digs into a
      stack of papers and looks back.

                                      FROST
                    You can go now!

      Johnny turns the MUSIC OFF.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Tell me about Mister Wolf?

                                      FROST
                    How do you know...?  You're psychic.

      Frost relents, making himself a drink.

                    He first called the show about four
                    months ago.  Said he had sensitive
                      information concerning Vice President
                    Danbury.  I thought he was just
                    another whack job.

                                      JOHNNY
                    He wasn't?

                                      FROST
                    Next day, I found a package on the
                    front seat of my car.  Danbury's CIA
                    file.  Names, dates, the whole
                      enchilada.  Documentation linking
                    him to a half dozen illegal or, at
                    the very least, unethical situations. 
                    I was going to have copies made and
                    sent to every major newspaper.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You didn't?

                                      FROST
                    The file vanished.  I had it long
                    enough to read and then it was gone.

                                      JOHNNY
                    That's when you went after the Vice
                    President on your show?

                                      FROST
                    Wolf started calling me once a week. 
                    Dropping information about Danbury's
                    personal and political life.  I have
                    an obligation to my audience.  People
                    need to know they have a criminal in
                    the White House.

                                      JOHNNY
                    How can you be sure it's all true?

                                      FROST
                    Because of the silence.

                                      JOHNNY
                    The silence?

                    Four months I've been pounding Danbury
                    on the web, in all that time do you
                    know how many denials have been

                    Maybe he just doesn't want to give
                    you any credibility?

                                      FROST
                    Yeah, maybe.  Or maybe I'm right on
                    the money.

                    Who do you think he is?  Wolf.

                                      FROST
                    I've narrowed it down to two
                      possibilities... State Department or
                    NSA.  Wherever he is, he's got his
                    nose in deep.

      Johnny and Frost both TURN towards the bedroom door,
        REVEALING... 

      KENDRA CROWE (35)

        a statuesque blonde in nothing but an open silk robe, bra
      and panties.  She's in tremendous physical condition.  She
      takes a deep drag off her cigarette, pursing lips painted in
      cherry red lipstick.

                                      FROST
                    What are you doing here?

                    My neighbors are having a party and
                    I needed someplace quiet to crash.

                    John Smith.  Kendra Crowe.  Kendra
                    was just leaving.

      She slides up to Frost and runs her hand across his chest.

                    Baby, you seem wired.  Did you take
                    your medicine?

                                      FROST
                    I'm in no mood.  I need to think.
                          (to Johnny)
                    That means both of you.

      Kendra snuffs out her cigarette in a nearby ashtray.

                                      KENDRA
                    Fine.

      She disappears into the bedroom.

                                      FROST
                    The front door!

                    I'm getting my stuff!

      Johnny pulls out his cell phone and dials.  Frost reacts,
      horrified; knocking it away.

                                      FROST
                    What the hell do you think you're
                    doing?

                    Not from here you aren't.  Microwaves
                    are traceable.  Don't you know
                    anything?

      Before Johnny can respond, a partially dressed Kendra
      reappears looking for her shoes.

                                      KENDRA
                    I need to have my head examined.  I 
                    come all the way out to this dump
                    and for what?  To get the cold
                    shoulder from a computer geek.

                                      JOHNNY
                    I hate to bother you, but would you
                    mind...

      She reads his question.

                                      KENDRA
                    Come on.

      Frost grabs her and kisses her.

                    I ever tell you how sexy you are

                    Screw you!

      She blows out the front door.  Johnny exits.



      Kendra drives.  Johnny tries to inconspicuously study her.

                                      KENDRA
                    Go ahead and ask.  What's a girl
                    that looks like me doing with a guy
                    like Marshall Frost?

                                      JOHNNY
                    It is a little curious.

                                      KENDRA
                    We have a... business arrangement.

                    Oh.

                    Oh!

                    It's not like that.  I mean, I don't
                    sleep with him or anything.  Mitch
                    hates being alone, especially since
                    his wife left him.

                    When was that?

                                      KENDRA
                    Almost a year.  Took his little girl. 
                    Nearly destroyed him.  Mostly I listen
                    to him rant about the world.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Do you think he's dangerous?

      She seems taken aback by the question,

                                      KENDRA
                    I think Mitch Frost believes
                      everything he says.

                    This is me on the corner.

      She pulls over.  Johnny opens his door and steps out.

                                      KENDRA
                    Yes.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Excuse me?

                                      KENDRA
                    You asked me if I thought Frost is
                      dangerous.  The answer is yes.

      The late model sports car tears away up the street.


      He walks in and clicks the television ON.  WHOOSH! 

      As the NATIONAL NEWS is on.

                                    NEWS ANCHOR
                    Tonight, a nation mourns, as the
                    White House has now confirmed reports
                    that Vice President Eric Danbury is
                    dead. 

      Johnny freezes; stunned.

                                    NEWS ANCHOR
                    As reported, it appears that a lone
                    gunman was able to breach security
                    and shoot the Vice President once in
                    the head.  Details remain extremely
                    sketchy.

      FADE IN:



      as he weaves through, heading for his office...

                                    WALT
                    I made a call to the Secret Service
                    and they took the information.

                                      JOHNNY
                    That's it?  A phone call?

                                    WALT
                    Do you have any idea how many death
                    threats the White House gets every
                    year?

                                      JOHNNY
                    It isn't a threat.  The Vice President
                    is going to be assassinated some
                    time in the next 48 hours.

                                    WALT
                    Where?  How?  By who?

                                      JOHNNY
                    I don't know.

                                    WALT
                    That's the problem.  Truth is, I'm
                    not exactly high on the FBI's
                      credibility list.  Not after what
                    happened out at that commune.

                                      JOHNNY
                    That wasn't your fault.

      ROSCOE approaches, presenting Walt with a manila folder.

                                      ROSCOE
                    Forensics report from the Webcast
                    studio.

      Walt takes the folder, scanning the contents.

                                    WALT
                    CSU didn't find anything.  Not a
                    hair, not a trace of blood.

      Johnny just stares at him.



                                                                (CONTINUED)      DEAD ZONE: "The Hunting Party" - ACT TWO - 8/9/05 - PINK 19.

                                    WALT
                    John, I believe you.  But if we want
                    anybody else to take it seriously,
                    we're going to need something solid
                    to give them.

      Johnny considers the challenge, then heads for the door.

                                    WALT
                    Where are you going?

                                      JOHNNY
                    To find Frost.

                                    WALT
                    John, there's something you should
                    know about him before you go.

      Johnny stops at the door and looks back,



      Frost is asleep on the couch, as someone grabs the blanket
      and yanks it, spilling him hard onto the floor.

                                      FROST
                    What the fu....

      He looks up to FIND Johnny staring down at him.

                                      JOHNNY
                          (angry)
                    Why didn't you tell me you were
                    stalking Eric Danbury?

      Frost struggles to his feet.

                                      FROST
                    What are you talking about?

                                      JOHNNY
                    Don't play stupid with me, I saw
                    copies of the police reports.  You
                    crashed your car through the front
                    gate of his house.  The police found
                      a 38-caliber pistol under the front
                    seat of your car.  Shall I continue? 

                                      FROST
                    Whatever floats your boat.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You spent 6 months in a psychiatric
                    hospital.  2 months in isolation
                    under a suicide watch.

                                      FROST
                    I had issues and I dealt with them. 
                    Why does all this matter so much to
                    you anyway?

                                      JOHNNY
                          (blurts it out)
                    It matters because in the next 36
                    hours someone is going to kill Vice
                    President Danbury!

      Frost seems stunned, then begins to laugh.

                                      FROST
                    And they think I'm crazy!
                          (off Johnny's look)
                    You're serious? 
                          (beat)
                    What?  You think it's me?

      Frost begins searching for a cigarette.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You've got the resum .

                                      FROST
                    Look, I've made some mistakes and I
                    paid for them.  I lost my wife and
                    my daughter, both of which I'm trying
                    to get back.  If you think I'd do
                    anything to jeopardize that, you
                    need to take another look into your
                    crystal ball or whatever it is you
                    do.

      Johnny can tell he's sincere.  Frost fingers an empty pack
      of cigarettes. 

                                      FROST
                    You don't have a cigarette, do you?

                                      JOHNNY
                    I don't smoke.

      He continues searching, as Johnny notices the partially smoked
      cigarette that Kendra snuffed out the night before.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Here.

      Occupied Jimmy Choo stilettos's gliding across polished
      marble.  We TRAVEL UP a pair of shapely legs, to REVEAL...

      KENDRA CROWE

      now a completely different animal; sporting a tailored
      pantsuit, her hair pulled neatly back, carrying a leather
      attach .  Moving with purpose through an ornate corridor,
      right past Observer Johnny as she flashes her credentials to
      a GUARD.

      Cleared, she continues on, drawing the leering stares of a
      delegation of JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN.

      satisfaction, slipping through a doorway.  Observer Johnny
      comes up from behind, pausing to read the door placard:
      COALITION FOR A BETTER AMERICA.



      A SECRETARY looks up from her desk, acknowledging Kendra.

                          (thinking)
                    Phil.  Phil recommended her.

      Something continues to gnaw at Johnny.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Do you know where she lives?



      Frost leads Johnny past numbered apartment doors.

                                      FROST
                    No offense, Smith, but your radar's
                    on the fritz.  Kendra may not be the
                    sharpest tool in the shed, but she
                    isn't a liar.

                                      JOHNNY
                    She dates strange men for money.  I
                    think she's whoever she needs to be. 

      They WALK PAST an open utility closet where an elderly looking
      MAINTENANCE MAN is working.  There's a huge key ring full of
      keys sticking out of the door knob of the open closet door.

                                      FROST
                    This is it.

      Frost KNOCKS... he KNOCKS again.

      Johnny steps quietly up to the open closet door, retrieves
      the key ring and steps back to where Frost is standing.  He
      finds the labeled key and unlocks the apartment door.      DEAD ZONE: "The Hunting Party" - ACT TWO - 8/9/05 - PINK 23.




      Johnny and Frost ENTER.  The apartment is fully furnished;
      casual country.  Dirty plates in the sink, fresh cut flowers,
      and open newspapers give it a comfy, lived-in feel.

                                      FROST
                    What are we looking for anyway?

                                      JOHNNY
                    I'm not sure.

      Johnny begins touching things, then he picks up a half glass
      of water off the breakfast table, WHOOSH! 


3030MOVE, MATCH, MORPH

      Someone fills the glass with water, but it's not Kendra. 
      Instead it's a MAN (#1) in a dark blue phone jumpsuit; a
      partially concealed earpiece visible.  He sets the glass on
      the table.  Observer Johnny watches curiously...

      Another, almost identical MAN (#2), passes by with a stack
      of newspapers; spreading them out to appear read.  A third 
      MAN (#3) carries a box through FRAME; Johnny follows...


3131BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

      The man unloads the box under Johnny's gaze; a worn toothbrush
      goes on the counter, prescription bottles into the medicine
      cabinet, a depleted shampoo bottle into the shower and even
      a few loose strands of hair in the drain.  No detail
      overlooked in this elaborate set dressing.  WHOOSH!



      Johnny flashes out of the vision, surveying his faux
        surroundings with a fresh perspective.

                                      JOHNNY
                    It's a set-up.

                    What?

                    The apartment.  It's been created to

      INSERT - PHOTOGRAPH

        A middle-age man in a wheelchair.

                                      FROST (O.S.)
                    He was injured in Vietnam.  A great
                    guy.

      RESUME JOHNNY AND FROST

      Johnny takes the frame, WHOOSH!

                                      JOHNNY
                    You've met him?

                                      FROST
                    Uh, no, not in person.

      Johnny turns the frame over and opens it from the back.  He
      slips out the picture, which we now realize is actually a
      page cut out of a magazine.  He unfolds the page as we see
      that the picture is actually part of a national advertisement
      for electric wheelchairs.  The man is simply an
        actor/spokesman for the product.

                                      FROST
                          (stunned)
                    I don't understand.

      Frost grabs a few other pictures and tears them out of their
      frames.  They're all fake.  Magazine ads meant to fool.

      The phone suddenly RINGS.  They share a look.  Frost slowly
      lifts the receiver to his ear...

                                      FROST
                    Hello? -- Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Okay.

      He offers the phone to Johnny.

                                      FROST
                    It's for you.

      He hands the phone to over to Johnny...

                                                                  INTERCUTTING WITH:      DEAD ZONE: "The Hunting Party" - ACT TWO - 8/9/05 - PINK 25.



3333E.C.U. - WOLF'S MOUTH

      talking into the mouth piece.

                                    WOLF
                    This is truly an honor, Mister Smith.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Who is this?

                                    WOLF
                    You can call me The Wolf.

                                      JOHNNY
                    What do you want?

                                    WOLF
                    We need to talk.  Go to Anderson
                    Park.  Bring Mister Frost with you.

                                      JOHNNY
                    How will I know you?

                                    WOLF
                    Go to the water fountain.  If you're
                    as good as they say, you'll find me.

      Click.  Dial tone.


      LATER

      Walt and Johnny talk with the medical examiner, DR. WENTZ.

                                      WENTZ
                      Preliminary tests indicate the victim
                    had a high concentration of serotonin
                    in the brain stem.

                                      JOHNNY
                    From the injection?

                                      WENTZ
                    Normally, I'd say it could be a
                      combination of serotonergic
                      medications... but not in this case. 
                    The initial ToxScreen came back
                    negative across the board.

                                    WALT
                    So how did he die?

                                      WENTZ
                    Off the record.  I'd say his brain
                    was turned off.
                          (beat)
                    The only problem is there's nothing
                    I'm aware of that could do that to a
                    human being in such a short period
                    of time.  At least nothing anyone is
                    supposed to know about.

                                    WALT
                    Meaning?

                                      WENTZ
                          (uneasy)
                    I've read about tests conducted by
                    the military.  Experimental chemical
                    agents meant for use on the
                      battlefield.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You think that's what killed this
                    man?

                                      WENTZ
                    Let me show you something...



                                                                (CONTINUED)      DEAD ZONE: "The Hunting Party" - ACT THREE - 8/9/05 - PINK 31.

      The Medical Examiner pulls open a particular drawer... Empty! 
      Wolf's body is gone.


4242MAIN OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER - THE MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE

      Walt, Johnny and the Medical Examiner stand over the desk of
      a young, female LAB TECH.

                                    LAB TECH
                          (nervous)
                    There were two men.  They said they
                    were from the FBI and that they were
                    supposed to pick up the body.

                                    WALT
                    They showed you proper ID?

                                    LAB TECH
                    Yes sir. 

      She presents the paperwork.  Walt scans the document.

                                      JOHNNY
                    These guys really clean up after
                      themselves.

                                    WALT
                    And we've got nothing again.

                                      WENTZ
                    That's not completely true.

      He retrieves an envelope and hands it to Walt.

                                      WENTZ
                    I always do a set of polaroids, just
                    in case.  I'll be in my office when
                    you're finished.

      Wentz and his Assistant exit, leaving Johnny and Walt alone
      to go over the pictures.  Walt flips through the photos.

                                      JOHNNY
                    First they kill Frost's engineer and
                    now Wolf, and they do it right in
                    front of us.  Why? 

                                    WALT
                    I've seen this before.

      Walt hands him one particular picture.





                                                                (CONTINUED)      DEAD ZONE: "The Hunting Party" - ACT THREE - 8/9/05 - PINK 32.

                                    WALT
                    That tattoo.  I've seen that design
                    before.

      INSERT PHOTO

      A CLOSE-UP of an elaborate tattoo covering the inside of
      Wolf's forearm; an ornate dragon, wrapped around a sword.

                                    WALT
                    I think it's military.  I'll make a
                    few calls. 
                          (beat)
                    John, if this Wolf character was
                    telling the truth, we could all be
                    in danger.

                                      JOHNNY
                    They could have killed me anytime
                    they wanted, but they haven't.  I
                    know this sounds crazy, but I think
                    they want us to know.  It's like
                    they're daring us to stop them. 

      As Walt considers the thought... 



      The door flies open.  A clearly intoxicated Frost, half bottle
      of booze in hand, and another tucked under his arm as he
      stumbles in.

                                      FROST
                    Honey, I'm home!
                          (beat)
                    That's right, they're all gone.

      Off balance, he barely makes it to the kitchen as he flips
      on the light and heads for the refrigerator.

                                      FROST
                    Ice cubes.  I need many, many ice
                    cubes.

      He grabs a bag of ice from the freezer, TURNS and FREEZES.

                                      FROST
                    Hello.

      He awkwardly dumps the bottles and the ice into the sink and
      MOVES to the far counter, REVEALING...

      RIFLE ON THE COUNTER

      A high-powered M-24 SNIPER RIFLE.

      Frost curiously studies the weapon, then picks it up.  A
      beat of uncertainty before raising the scope to his eye...

      FROST'S P.O.V. - THROUGH THE SCOPE

      moving across the trailer's furnishings; the crosshairs
      dancing over the refrigerator, the television, the couch...
      then everything goes DARK.

      RESUME SCENE

      Frost lifts his eye from the scope and SEES...

      A MASKED COMMANDO

      A SOLDIER, cloaked in black commando gear and a black ski
      mask standing directly in front of him.

                                      FROST
                          (even drunk he knows
                            this is bad, low)
                    Damn.

      As ANOTHER SOLDIER, grabs Frost around the neck from behind
      and quickly chokes him unconscious.  The Soldier in front
      takes the weapon from him as he drops to the floor.

      A THIRD SOLDIER helps lift and carry Frost's body away.

      Soldier 1, wearing gloves, carefully bags the sniper rifle
      leaving no prints and not disturbing the ones left by Frost. 
      And then he's gone. 



      Johnny ENTERS, as Walt meets him.  Walt seems edgier than
      usual.

                                      JOHNNY
                    What was so important we couldn't
                    talk on the phone?

                                    WALT
                    Let's go in my office.


4646WALT'S OFFICE

      Walt locks the door behind him and lowers the shade.

                                    WALT
                    I talked to a friend of mine.  We
                    were in the Marines together, then
                    he went to work in Washington for
                    the Army.

                                      JOHNNY
                    And?

                                    WALT
                    I sent him a picture of the tattoo. 
                    And he sent me something back.  This
                    is classified.

                    I only got it because I saved this
                    guy's ass once, and I swore that I'd
                    burn it after I was done. 

                                      JOHNNY
                    What is it?

      Walt slides a b/w, 8x10 photograph across the desk.

                                    WALT
                    Turns out I was right.  The tattoo
                    was the symbol for a low profile
                    Ranger unit.  The team officially
                    disbanded in 1997 after some secret
                    missions in Afghanistan.  Our dead
                    man in the park is front left.

      INSERT - PHOTOGRAPH

      About ten soldiers in full camouflage and carrying numerous

      bit younger, but it's definitely the same man.

      RESUME JOHNNY AND WALT

      Walt is clearly uneasy.

                                      JOHNNY
                    What kind of unit was this?

                                    WALT
                    The kind nobody talks about.

                                      JOHNNY
                    If Wolf was just a soldier, how could
                    he know the things he told Frost? 
                    He had to be getting information
                    from....

      Suddenly Johnny's expression shifts as he stops speaking.

                                      JOHNNY
                          (low, ominous)

                      I recognize a few more faces here.

      Johnny lays the photo between them on the desk.

      Johnny turns away to gather his thoughts,

                                    WALT
                    Stillson?  You don't think he's
                    involved in this thing, do you?

      Johnny suddenly grabs his jacket off the couch and heads for
      the door.

                                    WALT
                    Where are you going?

                    I think I know where to find Janus. 
                    I'll call you later.

      Johnny exits.  Walt picks up the photo, lights a match and
      sets the photograph on fire.  Once it's burning, he drops it
      into the waste can.

      INSERT PHOTOGRAPH

      CLOSE-UP as the fire burns away the FACES of CROWE, PHIL and
      WOLF.  The SHOT PUSHES TIGHTER on JANUS' face as the flames
      eventually burn away his image.

                                                                          DISSOLVE TO:



      Johnny, as he powers through the same marble hallway seen in
      his earlier Kendra Crowe vision.

      He slips past a distracted SECURITY GUARD, passing through
      the doorway marked: COALITION FOR A BETTER AMERICA.



      The now familiar secretary looks up from her computer.

                                      SECRETARY
                    Can I help you?

                                      JOHNNY
                    I want to see Janus.

                                      SECRETARY
                    There's no one here by that name.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Lady, I don't have time for this.

      Johnny reaches over and activates the door release buzzer. 
      He blows through the inner office door...

                                      SECRETARY
                          (on the phone)
                    Security.      DEAD ZONE: "The Hunting Party" - ACT THREE - 8/9/05 - PINK 38.




      Johnny bursts into the empty conference room.  He quickly
      closes the door and locks it.

      Johnny MOVES CAUTIOUSLY around the conference table, trailing
      his hand along the backs of the lush leather chairs, ending
      at the head position.  As he touches the back of the chair, 
      WHOOSH! 


5151MATCH, MOVE, MORPH

      Bodies materialize around him, filling the empty chairs; 4
      or 5 older MEN in suits.  Distinguished.  Severe.  This is
      the BOARD MEETING that's not on anyone's day planner.

      Across the expanse of the table, GREG STILLSON occupies the
      chair directly in front of Johnny.

                                      STILLSON
                    I'm not sure I'm comfortable with
                    this idea.  

      The chair at the far end of the table swivels slowly around
      to REVEAL MALCOLM JANUS.  He carries no knife, but he's just
      seems just as deadly...

                                      JANUS
                    Not comfortable?  We've invested a
                    great deal of money and effort into
                    you Congressman.  Tremendous
                      sacrifices have been made and will
                    continue to be made in order for you
                    to realize your place in history.

                                      STILLSON
                          (with politician ease)
                      I appreciate everything you've done. 
                      Concerning my father and... my wife.  

                                      JANUS
                    You're appreciation is neither
                    expected or required.  Your commitment
                    is all we ask, all we've ever
                    required. 
                          (beat, lost in himself)
                    There's a storm coming.  The winds
                    of change are howling.  And when
                    they strike, our great nation will
                    ascend from the rubble and once again
                    become the beacon of power and dignity
                    by which all other civilizations
                    will be judged.

                                      JANUS (CONT'D)
                    The question is are you the man to
                    stand above the rest?  The voice
                    that will lead us from the darkness
                    into the light?  Are you?  Can you
                    be?  Can you? 

      An eerie silence hangs over the room; tension palpable. 
      Everything Stillson has ever dreamed about is at his feet
      for the taking.  The door opens and the secretary enters... 

                                      SECRETARY
                          (to Janus)
                    Excuse me, sir, the Vice Presidential
                    party has left Andrews.  We expect
                    wheels on the ground in less than an
                    hour.

                                      JANUS
                    It's time, Congressman.  What will
                    it be?

      Stillson seems slightly uneasy under the scrutiny of those
      gathered, as he finally rises from his chair. 

                                      STILLSON
                    This is for my country.  My people.  

                                      SECRETARY
                    Right this way, Congressman. 

      Stillson follows the woman to the door. 

                                      JANUS
                    Happy hunting, sir.

      Janus watches as Stillson walks out.   WHOOSH! 



      as the puzzle picture begins to take shape, TWO SECURITY
      GUARDS suddenly bust the doors OPEN.  As they rush in and
      grab Johnny, the Secretary comes in behind them.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Wait!  You don't understand what's
                      happening!

                                      SECRETARY
                    Remove him from the building. 

      The Guards strong arm Johnny out of the room.

                    Good-bye, Mister Smith.

      She gives him that creepy smile, as Johnny realize just how
      deep and twisted this thing really is...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:



      Johnny opens the door and ENTERS.  There's nobody here.  He
      disappears into the bedroom, then returns.  He checks out
      the kitchen.

      THE KITCHEN

      Johnny notices the mostly melted bag of ice and whiskey
      bottles in the sink.  He reaches down and picks up the half
      full bottle, as WHOOSH!



      Frost holds the sniper rifle to his eye, aiming it.  Observer
      Johnny circles around him, taking in the startling image.

      Then Frost is assaulted and carried out of the trailer.  The
      rifle wrapped and taken away.  WHOOSH!

      reacting; ducking down below the counter.  Johnny slides
      open a kitchen drawer and takes out a steak knife.  He knows
      if Janus wants him dead, he'll have to fight. 

      Then approaching FOOTSTEPS; closer and closer until they are
      right over him.  He takes a deep breath then rises quickly,
      the knife poised to attack, as we REVEAL...

                                    WALT
                    Feds got an anonymous tip that Frost

                    out. 
                            (determined)
                    I'm staying here.  I need to know. 
                    I need to see it for myself.

      Johnny quickly OPENS the car door.

                                    WALT
                    John, wait!

      It's too late.  He's already disappeared into the crowd.



      Johnny enters; exhausted.  Defeated.  He eases himself onto
      the couch, remotely turning on the television...

      A MALE/FEMALE NEWS TEAM delivers the tragic news...

                                    MALE NEWS ANCHOR
                    The White House has now confirmed
                    that surgeons were unable to revive
                    Vice President Danbury.  The official
                    time of death 3:47PM.

      A photo of STILLSON comes up...

                                      FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR
                    The condition of Maine Congressman
                    Greg Stillson, wounded in the attack,*
                    has now been raised to stable.  The
                    President is calling Stillson an
                    American hero as the charismatic
                    young leader returned fire in defense
                    of the Vice President, killing the
                    lone gunman with a single shot.  The
                    assassin has been officially*
                      identified as controversial media
                      personality, Marshall Frost.  Frost,
                    who had a history of mental health
                    problems, often attacked the Vice*
                    President on his weekly webcast. 
                    It's too early to speculate, but
                    early word out of Washington pegs
                    Stillson as a likely candidate to
                    fill the now vacant Vice Presidency.

      Johnny can hardly believe what he's hearing.

                    Like you said, Julie, it's too early
                    to know which way the political winds
                    may blow, but if there was an election
                    held tomorrow, I do believe Greg
                    Stillson might be elected President.

7979JOHNNY

      His face wrought with emotion.  He closes his eyes...

                                      JANUS'S VOICE
                    From his lips to God's ear.

      Janus steps out of the darkness like a phantom.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You did this.  You murdered the Vice
                      President.

                                      JANUS
                    I prefer to see it as a liberation. 
                    The freedom to usher in new*
                      perspectives of leadership.*

                                      JOHNNY
                    You're insane.

                                      JANUS
                    Again, I believe we'll have to agree
                    to disagree. 

                                      JOHNNY
                    Why let me in on it?  You knew I'd*
                    see the truth.  *

                                      JANUS
                    I thought I made that clear in our
                    last conversation.

                                      JOHNNY
                          (remembering)
                    The third ruler in the Kingdom.

                                      JANUS
                      Technically, you'd be number two,
                    but everything's negotiable.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Those people that you killed, they
                    were your soldiers.  Did you offer
                    them a chance to negotiate their*
                    lives?

      The question seems to strike a nerve with Janus.

                                      JANUS
                    Their mission was to serve the greater
                    good of the unit.

                                      JANUS (CONT'D)
                    In that respect, they died heroes. 
                    We should all be thankful to pass
                    with such dignity.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Dignity?  Is that what it took to
                    poison Miranda Ellis on her wedding
                    day?  Or was she just more collateral
                    damage on your way to the White House?

                                      JANUS
                    We have philosophical differences, I
                    accept that, but at the core we both
                    desire the same things.  A safe and
                    powerful land in which to raise our
                    children and build our future.  You've
                    seen what we can accomplish without
                    you, imagine the things we could do
                    together.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Are you suggesting this was all some
                    kind of audition for my benefit?

                                      JANUS
                    Not an audition.  A preview.  The
                    opening act of the greatest drama
                    ever conceived by a man.  An epic
                    tale born of victory and penned in
                    blood.  You simply need to decide on
                    which side of the curtain you'll
                    stand.

                                      JOHNNY
                    And if I turn away?

                                      JANUS
                          (cold)
                    You won't need psychic powers to see
                    that future.  There won't be one.  
                          (stepping to the door)
                    Think it over, John, it's almost
                    show time.

      Janus vanishes into the darkness.  As Johnny is left to ponder*
      the implication of his threat.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                            THE END
