                ...Then we had sex, fell asleep and 

                when I woke up this morning he was 

                gone.  

                                  ANDI

                So what you re saying is... you may or 

                may not be engaged?

                                  JULES

                Right!  (TO BOBBY) You have to find 

                out.  

                                  BOBBY

                Me?  How am I supposed to find out?

                                  JULES

                When you guys hang out.

                                  BOBBY

                When are we  hanging out? 

                                  JULES

                Soon.  Remember, Lowell said,  we 

                should hang out soon  and you said, 

                   absolutely.       Friends With Better Lives - "PILOT"    24.


                                  ANDI

                  Actually, you said  absosmurfly,  

                which was so weird.   

                                  BOBBY

                The guy makes me nervous.

                                  JULES

                Lowell s free tomorrow night.  

                                  ANDI

                Will you go?

      BOBBY THINKS.  SIGHS.  

                                  BOBBY

                Can it count as your anniversary 

                present?

                                  ANDI

                Your romance knows no bounds.  (THEN 

                TO JULES) And you have to tell Kate. 

                                  JULES

                I know.  (THEN) Why do I?

                                  ANDI

                Because.  She s one of your best 

                friends.  

                                  JULES

                I know.  But I m scared of her.  

                                  BOBBY

                Oh my God, me, too!  She s terrifying!  

                How have we never discussed this in 

                twelve years?       Friends With Better Lives - "PILOT"    25.


                                  ANDI

                Think of it this way: would you rather 

                she find out on her own?  

      AS JULES AND BOBBY CONSIDER JUST HOW SCARY THAT WOULD BE, THE 
      DOOR BURSTS OPEN.  IT S WILL.

                                  WILL

                Hey, what s everyone doing Saturday 

                night?  

                                  ANDI

                Watching Dance Moms and eating an 

                entire Pavillions cake after Bobby 

                goes to bed.  

                                  WILL

                Well, cancel that,  cause I m having a 

                party.  

                                  BOBBY

                What?  You hate parties.  

                                  WILL

                I know, I know, but, well... (TO 

                JULES) I thought about what you said 

                and maybe I could be a little more 

                  positive.  So I started thinking about 

                the upside to not being married and it 

                turns out, there s a lot.

                I don t have to organize Kim s 

                iPhotos, or spend the better part of a 

                weekend trying to teach her parents 

                how to do e-mail, or live in a shoe-

                free home because she spent a semester 

                in Japan.  I ve been wallowing when I 

                should have been celebrating.  

                                  JULES

                This is amazing, Will!  A party will 

                be so healing.  We can bury your 

                marriage license, make a list of 

                things you want to manifest in your 

                next relationship, read excerpts from 

                  spiritual masters and--

                                  WILL

                No, no, don t do that.  It s just a 

                party where people get together and 

                say mean stuff about Kim.

                Kate, I have to tell you --

                What the hell, Will?  (TO OTHERS) He 

                set me up with a tiny man on purpose!  

                                  WILL

                What?  He s a  nice  guy...    Friends With Better Lives - "PILOT"    27.

                that!  

                                  WILL

                That doesn t sound very Volvo-like.

                                  KATE

                Shut up.  This is a nightmare.  I had 

                to pretend I wasn t feeling well to 

                get out of going home with him and now 

                what am I supposed to say when he 

                calls?    

                                  WILL

                Nothing.  He s not going to call.  For 

                your information, he wasn t interested 

                in you, either.  

                                  KATE

                Of course he was interested.  He was 

                very interested.  

                                  WILL

                Not according to him.

                                  KATE

                  I don t... I don t understand.

                He didn t like you.    Friends With Better Lives - "PILOT"    28.

                  I understand, I just don t understand!  

                He s, like, two feet tall!  How could 

                he not like me?!

      WILL SHRUGS.  HORRIFIED AND FURIOUS, KATE TAKES THIS IN.

                vibing the other night, but good on 

                you for reaching out.

                                  BOBBY

                Well, I mean... I was kind of 

                  responding to your invitation.  (OFF 

                LOWELL S CONFUSION) At dinner?  You 

                said,  we should hang out soon. 

                                  LOWELL

                If I m being honest, I was just being 

                polite.  I didn t think you d actually 

                call.

                Well, if I m being honest, I didn t 

                want to.  Andi thought it d be nice 

                for us to hang out and I forgot our 

                  anniversary and it just seemed easier 

                to come.      Friends With Better Lives - "PILOT"    30.

                I wonder why you forgot your 

                  anniversary.  Subconsciously, there 

                must be a reason, right?  How s your 

                  relationship?  Are you guys in a good 

                place?  Do you do nice things for each 

                other?

                                  BOBBY

                Of course not.  We re married.

                How often do you have sex?

                What?  That s very... I don t... How 

                often do you?   

                                  LOWELL

                Not a lot.  Three, four times a week.  

      BOBBY REACTS.  THAT S A LOT.

                That s not really her thing.  Per se.

                years.  I didn t give it to you  cause 

                I didn t want to make you feel worse 

                for not getting me anything.  (TO 

                JULES) And if you re going to do that, 

                at least have your boyfriend-fiance-

                  whoever-he-is, have the decency to 

                keep it to himself.  You re ruining it 

                for everyone.

      WILL IS AT HIS DESK.  A VERY, VERY PREGNANT WOMAN SITS

                So I ll see you next week.  If you

      SHE NODS AND HOISTS HERSELF OUT OF THE SEAT AND WOBBLES 
      TOWARDS THE DOOR AS BOBBY ENTERS.  THEY DO THAT AWKWARD DANCE 
      WITH HIM TRYING TO DODGE HER ENORMOUS BELLY, WHICH SEEMS TO 
      BE EVERYWHERE.  THEY FINALLY GET PAST EACH OTHER ONLY WHEN

                                  BOBBY

                Because Andi wanted a surprise 

                  Anniversary party and she got me this 

                watch and the place that makes flowers 

                out of fruit closed down.  

                                  WILL

                Well why should I let you in on my 

                party?

                                  BOBBY

                Because it s all the same people and 

                we can do it at my house and I ll pay 

                for half.  

                                  WILL

      SMILING FACES IN A HEART.  THE OTHER CAKE SAYS  MARRIAGE 
      SUCKS  AND HAS A PHOTO OF WILL AND KIM, BUT KIM S FACE IS X-

      DECORATED WITH A HAPPY ANNIVERSARY BANNER AND A  PIN THE TAIL

                gonna be here any minute!  And what

                A pinata of Kim s parents being 

                  strangled.  Where can I hang it? 

                                  BOBBY

                You know, tonally, a pinata is not so 

                much what I was imagining.   

                                  WILL

                Who doesn t love a pinata?    

      WILL TAKES DOWN A HANGING PLANT AND REPLACES IT WITH THE 
      PINATA.  BOBBY GOES AND STANDS BEHIND THE CURTAIN, ON THE 
      LOOK-OUT FOR ANDI.  HE PASSES JULES AND LOWELL, STANDING 
      TOGETHER IN AWKWARD SILENCE.  WE STAY ON THEM.  LOWELL OPENS

                                  KATE

                I can t stop thinking about him.  He s 

                not even that short. 

      JULES IS TOO NICE TO CORRECT HER BUT HER FACE TELLS US HE IS 
      THAT SHORT.

                Well maybe I just don t see it because 

                we had a deeper connection.  Maybe 

                I ve grown up, Jules.  Maybe I m 

                finally ready for a mature

                Why would you think that?

                Because I can t think of a single

                Can we talk about it when we get home?

                                  JULES

                In sixth grade I by accident told Hugh 

                Eaton I loved him so I totally get it 

                if it just slipped out.  I mean, we ve 

                only been dating two months so it d be 

                crazy if... I just want you to know 

                I m okay, either way.  Whether we are 

                or we aren t so let s just acknowledge 

                it and then we can move on.

                                  LOWELL (CONT D)

                Okay... fine.  The truth is, it did

                didn t want it to happen like that.  I 

                don t want it to happen like this, 

                either, for the record.

                days are hell.  But no matter how much 

                fun I m not having, there s no one in
