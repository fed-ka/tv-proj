                  ...in the past few days wildlife 
                  officials have been swamped with 
                  hundreds of phone calls from 
                  Agrestic residents who have 
                  reported seeing a large, tan 
                  mountain lion...

                  The thing stole a three pound rib-
                  eye right off the barbecue.  I 
                  threw a grill brush at it but it 
                  hopped the fence.  Moved quick for 
                  its size.

                  it came right up to them and 
                  growled-- scared the (BLEEP) out of

                  cat-- in two days.  But I don t 
                  know, would a big cat eat a little 
                  cat?  Isn t that like cat 
                  cannibalism?

    We MOVE through the long line of identical tract houses all 
    lined up in a row.  It looks like a lit up runway at LAX as 
    we travel all the way to the end of the line and come upon a 
    half constructed house.

    Shane s perched along the edge of the roof, BB gun in hand.

    REVERSE ON-- the bloody and raw microwaved steak that rests 
    on the ground of the backyard below.

    Shane takes a sip of Coke to stay awake.
