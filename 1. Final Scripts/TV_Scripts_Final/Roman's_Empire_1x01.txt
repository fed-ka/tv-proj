                                        ACT ONE

  FADE IN:

  INT. AIRPORT - MORNING

  We PAN ACROSS a busy airport.  We hear GRUNTING AND THRASHING.  

                              LEO (V.O.)
                This is a story about love...

  The camera rests on LEO PARK, a real go-getter, think a young 
  Michael J. Fox.  He is angrily shoving a bouquet of flowers 
  through a frustratingly small hole on top of a trash can.

                              LEO (V.O.) (CONT D)
                And what happens when love slips away 
                from you and sort of turns on you, biting 
                and biting, like some rabid, vicious 
                dog... of love.

  An old woman stops Leo and points:  Cans Only.   Leo 
    sheepishly digs the flower pieces out of the tiny hole.

                              LEO (V.O.) (CONT D)
                You see, I have a problem; this is Nikki, 
                the girl I love.

  EXT. PARK

  CLOSE ON fifteen year old NIKKI PRETTY.  She has pigtails and 
  braces and smiles at the camera.

                              LEO (V.O.)
                I mean, that WAS her.  At fifteen. It s 
                cool, I was fifteen too.

  We see Leo at fifteen; a smiling Goth kid with braces.

                              LEO (V.O.) (CONT D)
                We were young and stupid, but that didn t 
                make it any less real...

  Nikki leans in, SLOW-MOTION, and kisses him on the cheek.  
  Leo is over the moon.

                              LEO (CONT D)
                We fell madly, hopelessly in love.  My folks 
                were on another of their mommy-and-daddy-
                          need-alone-time-in-Reno-you-understand-don t-
                  you-sweetie trips, so Nikki and I spent that 
                whole summer together.

  SUPER-8 SHOTS OF NIKKI AND LEO

                                                                          (CONTINUED)   Roman s Empire Writer s Second 03/14/082.

  He plays guitar while she dances around.

  Sharing ice-cream, they look very happy.

                              LEO (CONT D)
                Those days in the park were some of the 
                happiest of my life.  We laughed, we cried, 
                we talked about our dreams; Her s to be an 
                actress on Broadway and mine to make music.  
                It was just her and I... that is until she 
                said,  daddy wanted to meet me. 

  EXT. PRETTY MANSION

  CLOSE ON DOOR

  Nikki nervously walks up with Leo and she knocks on the door.

  QUICK PULL OUT: SUPER-WIDE SHOT

  We see that they are entering a HUGE MANSION.

                              LEO (V.O.)
                You see Nikki was Nikki Pretty, middle 
                daughter of Roman Pretty, one of the 
                richest men in America.

  QUICK ZOOM BACK

  The door is opened by ROMAN PRETTY, a supremely confident 
    billionaire.  He looks at Leo up and down.

                              LEO (V.O.) (CONT D)
                Since their mother passed away, Roman was 
                very protective of his three daughters. 
                But he seemed to take to me right away.

  Roman smiles and gives Leo a great big hug.  He pulls him 
  inside leaving Nikki alone on the porch.

  INT. MANSION KITCHEN

  Roman sits laughing at the counter with Leo.  Leo, eating, 
  has food on his chin.  Roman tries to point this out.

                              LEO (V.O.)
                When Roman loved you, he loved you fully.  
                  Intensely.  Some might even say, 
                  inappropriately.  But it was just how 
                Roman showed his love.

  Roman takes a napkin, wipes Leo s chin, then tucks it into 
  Leo s shirt.  He starts to feed Leo with a spoon.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)   Roman s Empire Writer s Second 03/14/083.

    CONTINUED:


                              LEO (V.O.) (CONT D)
                And boy did he love me.  Roman treated me 
                like the son he never had.  I entered his 
                life at fifteen and never left. 

  INT. NIKKI S BEDROOM - NIGHT

  Roman tucks Leo into bed and gives him a kiss on the forehead.

  We REVEAL that Nikki is also in bed with Leo.  Roman gives 
  her a wave.  Nikki waves back, a little uncomfortable.

  INT. ROMAN S OFFICE

  Roman sits working hard at his desk.

                              LEO (V.O.)
                Although a loving family man, Roman took 
                his work seriously.  Since splitting with 
                his brother Jesus he s had to run the 
                Pretty family real estate empire all by 
                himself.  So, he always seemed to enjoy 
                it when I stopped by...

  Leo, still dressed like a punk, sits strumming his guitar.  He 
  is curious to what Roman is working on.  Roman waves him over.

                              LEO (V.O.) (CONT D)
                In fact he soon took me under his wing... 
                and held me there.  Really tightly.  But in 
                    a teaching/smothering/loving kind of way.

  Leo walks over.  Roman immediately throws Leo s guitar to the 
  side, excitedly showing Leo business plans and blueprints.

  INT. MANSION - LATER

  Roman puts his arm out and his three daughters (NIKKI, KELLY 
  and JENNY) flock to him.  He gives them each a kiss on the 
  head then waves Leo over for his kiss.

                              LEO (V.O.)
                We were one big happy family.  Just me, 
                Roman and his three beautiful daughters. 
                Jenny, his oldest, was a bit of an earth 
                  mother... 

  INT. MANSION FOYER

  ON JENNY PRETTY

  She is beautiful, has braided hair and wears a batik dress.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)   Roman s Empire Writer s Second 03/14/084.

    CONTINUED:


                              LEO (V.O.)
                  I thought she would be perfect for my friend 
                Jace, who s a bit of a free-spirit himself.

  JACE, a bearded hippie-type, enters frame and embraces Jenny.  
  He smiles as he looks around the incredible mansion.  

                              LEO (V.O.) (CONT D)
                Jenny was a principled girl who recycled, 
                reduced and reused.

  Jenny takes the awestruck Jace through her beautiful mansion.

                              LEO (V.O.) (CONT D)
                  Rejecting all the trappings of wealth, 
                she virtually lived off the grid in the 
                West Wing of the Pretty Mansion.  

  Jenny opens a door to reveal her place:  A cramped hovel 
  filled with ratty furniture, thrift-store paintings and 
  sixteen recycle bins.  Jace s face falls.

  EXT. STREET - DAY

  We see KELLY PRETTY, a gorgeous Paris Hilton-type.  She wears 
  oversized sunglasses and carries a tiny dog.

                              LEO (V.O.)
                Kelly was the youngest Pretty daughter.  
                They say it s wrong to label your 
                  children, but I have no idea what it does 
                when they re labelled wrongly.  Roman 
                called Kelly his  little genius. 

  Kelly makes kissy-faces at her dog.

                              KELLY
                Does Brandon have to go poo-poo?  Will 
                Brandon make poo-poo for mommy?

  Kelly puts the tiny, shakey dog down and it starts to do it s 
  business.  Suddenly flashes light it up.

  WIDE - We see that Kelly is surrounded by a horde of 
    paparazzi.  Kelly  tsks  and puts a tiny privacy-screen 
  around her dog. The paparazzi follow her every move.

                              LEO (V.O.)
                And then there s Nikki. My sweet Nikki.  
                Smart, beautiful, down-to-earth, she dreamed 
                of being on the stage and that s why she 
                came to my office three months ago...   Roman s Empire Writer s Second 03/14/085.



  INT. LEO S OFFICE - THREE MONTHS AGO.

  Leo, now dressed conservatively, is busy at work at his desk.

                              NIKKI
                Leo, do you have a minute?

                              LEO
                Just one, hon, your dad needs these 
                figures by tomorrow.

                              NIKKI
                I ve been offered a play, Leo, it s 
                called  Wrestling with my Demons. 

                              LEO
                That s wonderful!  See, I told you if you 
                just put yourself out there it would 
                happen.  Congrat--

                              NIKKI
                It s in Berlin and I ll be gone for three 
                months.

                              LEO
                Oh.

                              NIKKI
                I know, it s a really long time.

  Nikki looks into Leo s eyes.

                              NIKKI (CONT D)
                Leo, just say the word and I won t go.

  Leo takes her face in his hands.

                              LEO
                Listen.  Nikki.  This is what you ve 
                always dreamed of... I want you to do 
                this play.

  FREEZE ON LEO S FACE

                              LEO (V.O.) (CONT D)
                And that was the worst mistake of my life...

  The stylized poster is labelled:  Ich bin L sst der Pochende 
  Teufel! Nackte Frau, Ringen uns!

                  Apparently the title  Wrestling with my 
                Demons  was a very loose translation.

  The translation shows up underneath:  I am the Throbbing 
  Devil!  Naked Woman, Let us Wrestle!

                              LEO (V.O.) (CONT D)
                The play was basically an hour and a half 
                of Nikki, nude, wrestling with a guy 
                covered in red paint.

  END OF THE PLAY

    Avant-garde, bespectacled Germans quietly clap as a nude, red-
  smeared Nikki takes a bow next to guy in a big devil head.  

  Roman is in the audience, proud.

                              ROMAN
                      (tearily in perfect German)
                Das ist meine nackte Tochter dort drin. 

  Translation under: That s my naked daughter up there.

  INT. AIRPORT - EARLIER TODAY

  Leo, carrying flowers rushes through the airport.

                              LEO (V.O.)
                And here we are three months later.  Me 
                waiting for the girl I love to get off 
                that plane.

  There is a commotion as a crowd pours from the gate.  The 
  crowd parts and Leo spots the beautiful Nikki exiting.

                              ROMAN (O.S.)
                Nikki!

                              NIKKI
                Daddy!

  Roman appears as if by magic.

                              LEO
                I guess I should have told them I was coming.

                              LEO (V.O.) (CONT D)
                I was always amazed that Roman, with all 
                his business and wealth, still had time 
                to pick up his children from the airport. 



                                                                          (CONTINUED)   Roman s Empire Writer s Second 03/14/087.

  Roman rushes over, hugs Nikki then kisses her on the lips... 
  for an uncomfortably long time.  Roman ends the kiss then 
  notices Leo.

                              ROMAN
                Ah, Leo my boy!

  Roman comes over and kisses Leo on the mouth for an 
    uncomfortably long time.  Roman turns back to Nikki.

                              ROMAN (CONT D)
                How was your trip?  Three months!  That s

                              LEO
                Eh-hem.

  Leo sheepishly motions to his flowers.

                              ROMAN
                Oh, I m sorry.

                              LEO
                      (smiling)
                Welcome home, Nikki.

                      (sorry)
                Oh, Leo.  I really should have called...

                              SEB (O.S.)
                There you are.

  A large, handsome, preppy-looking guy, SEB, grabs Nikki in 
  his arms and bends her back with a passionate kiss.

                              SEB (CONT D)
                  I thought I lost you, Sweetie.

  Leo is in shock.

                              NIKKI
                Everyone this is Seb, my... my new

                  Gentlemen.

  Leo blinks, still in shock.

                              ROMAN
                Wow.  This is quite a shocker... But, I m 
                double parked, so we should get those bags.

                I m sorry, Leo.  I didn t mean for this

  FADE IN:

  EXT. PRETTY MANSION

  We hear laughing.

                              SEB (O.S.)
                ...then I said,  I didn t know nipples had 
                  feelings.  And that s when your daughter 
                punched me right in the Adam's apple.

  INT. PRETTY MANSION

  The family is gathered around Seb and Nikki.  Leo watches 
  from the sidelines, angry.

                              SEB
                But after that first rehearsal we got 
                along just fine.

  Leo approaches Nikki.

                              LEO
                Can I talk to you?

                              NIKKI
                Not now.

  Leo heads back to the sidelines.

                              ROMAN
                So, Seb, how much acting have you done?

                              SEB

  INT. MANSION - JENNY AND JACE S PLACE - LATER

  Leo rants around the room. Jace sits on his crappy couch.

                              LEO
                No warning, no call, no anything.  You 
                should have seen him at dinner, Eating 
                and carrying on, everyone pretending to 
                laugh.  And Nikki?  She won t even talk 
                to me.  Like it s my fault or something.

                So what you re saying is, you re free.

                              LEO
                What?

                You can leave here.  We could both go.  
                We could disappear into a foreign jungle.

                Jace had been acting a little strange 
                  lately...

  EXT. PRETTY MANSION WEST WING

  We follow an extension cord from the main house into a window 
  where we see Jace, hiding in his bedroom, playing an X-Box.

                              LEO (V.O.)
                I think living so close, yet so far, from 
                all that wealth drove Jace a little 
                crazy. Plus, there was the issue of 
                Jenny s  wonderful news. 

  Jenny bursts into the room, excited.  She shoves a pregnancy 
  stick into Jace s face.  He sees the dreaded plus sign.

                              LEO (V.O.) (CONT D)
                And of course they re going to get married.

  Jace drops the X-BOX controller and immediately flees.

                              LEO (V.O.) (CONT D)
                At least that s what Jace decided after a 
                little soul-searching in Argentina.

  INT. NIKKI S BEDROOM

  Nikki, finishing unpacking, hears a noise at the window.

  Leo is inching the window up from the outside.  He smiles, 
  triumphant.  Nikki calmly goes over to the window and pushes 
  it back down, unknowingly trapping Leo s fingers.

                              LEO

  INT. MANSION - IN THE PAST

  Roman stands in the middle of the Foyer pantsless and confused.  
  Leo quickly wheels past him with a cart and one of Jenny s 
  recycle bins.  After a beat he wheels back with a passed out 
  Kelly now on the cart.  He hands Roman his pants. Nikki, dressed 
  nicely, stands to the side looking at her watch, disappointed.

  We PAN ACROSS a moving van to reveal Leo unloading boxes.

                              LEO (V.O.)
                Without Nikki, there was no use staying 
                with the Prettys.  Luckily, my parents, 
                just before leaving on a three months 
                 couples cruise , said that my old room 
                was available, although they were now 
                using it for storage.

  INT. LEO S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

  Leo carries his box into a room filled with various sex 
    equipment; chains on the wall, a sex swing, blow-up doll, 
  etc.  He sets his box down next to a vat of love lotion.  

                              LEO (V.O.)
                That was that.  Ten years of my life, 
                gone.  I was done with the Prettys 
                  forever....

  EXT. LEO S PARENTS APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

  Leo goes for another box as A BLACK LIMO pulls up to the curb.

                company and concentrate on commercial real 
                estate, Jesus split, taking with him their 
                core business: household family products.

                Roman soon built one of the largest real 
                estate empires in the Western Hemisphere  
                and Jesus, now racked by jealousy, covets 
                  everything Roman has achieved; his house, 
                his family, even the caps on his teeth.

  Jesus leans out and beckons to Leo.

                Nice. Feels like the same concern I d get 
                trapped in a pit in your basement.

  INT. LEO S ROOM - NIGHT

  Leo is trying to sleep but his  mattress  has extra holes, a 
  headboard filled with ties and handcuffs, and oddly wedged 
  pillows.  He finally settles into a compromised position.

                It was going to be rough, but starting 
                over was the best thing for me right now.

                              JESUS
                It s nice of you to join us on such a 
                special occasion.  The total humiliation 
                of my brother Roman.

                              LEO
                What are you talking about?

                              JESUS
                You didn t let me explain at our little 
                get together.  Without you watching out 
                for Roman, I have managed to infiltrate 
                this place at the highest levels.  What 
                should be his shining moment shall 
                instead be the worse embarrassment of his 
                  career.... The hors d evours are coming 
                out, why don t you try a canape?

  Jesus slinks back into the crowd.  Leo grabs a canape.

                              LEO
                Ewww!

  Leo sees other customers trying the horrible hors d evours.  
  Jenny walks up with Jace, who is in an itchy hemp suit.

                              JACE
                I feel like a fool in this suit.

                              JENNY
                It s hemp.  You look wonderful.

                              JACE
                I smell like my cousin s basement.  Leo, 
                did you try the food?  I ve step in stuff 
                better than this.

  Nikki and Seb run up.

                              NIKKI
                What s going on?  This food is terrible!

                              SEB
                      (creepily)
                Hey, Leo.

  Roman walks up and gives Leo a big hug

                              ROMAN
                Leo!  I m so glad you could make it!

                              LEO
                Roman, is everything all right?

                      (still cheery)
                Not at all.  Andre is going crazy in the 
                kitchen and the food tastes like poo.  But 
                don t worry, my boy, you have a good time.

  Roman gives him a weak smile.  Leo surveys the Pretty family 
  all looking to him expectantly.

                              LEO (V.O.)
                They were the most over privileged, 
                spoiled,  out of touch group of people I 
                had ever met.  They drove me crazy but 
                what could I do?  They were family...

  Leo goes into action.  He sees people starting to leave.

                              LEO (CONT D)
                All right, we can deal with this.  First 
                off, we need to get that food thrown away.

  Roman and Jenny head off to do this.

                              LEO (CONT D)
                Now, we have to keep them entertained 
                while we come up with a new menu.

                              SEB
                I could do m  wang shapes.

  Seb immediately pulls out his wiener.

                              SEB (CONT D)
                I call this the miracle of birth.

                              LEO
                Eww.

  Nikki tilts Leo s head.  He now sees it and melts.

                              LEO (CONT D)
                      (like seeing a sweet baby)
                Oh.
                      (then, catching himself)
                No.  We need something else--

  Jace is smiling and starts to back away.

                              LEO (CONT D)
                Where are you going?

                This could be it.  Roman s failed.  First 
                the restaurant, then the building, the 
                  empire... I could be free.

  Jace heads towards the door.

                              JACE (CONT D)
                I m free!

  Jace is immediately set upon by a pair of drug sniffing dogs.

                              JACE (CONT D)
                No!  It s hemp!  Nice puppies-- Ahhh!!!

  A crowd gathers to watch as the dogs continue their attack.

                              LEO
                All right, we ve got them entertained.  
                Nikki, Seb, we need some more food, run 
                out and get what you can.  Where s Kelly?

                              NIKKI
                She s said something crazy about 
                  paparazzi and making a grand entrance.

                              LEO
                I can t worry about that, I ve got go see 
                if I can help Andre Agassi save this damn 
                  restaurant.  Let s move!

  INT. KITCHEN

                              ANDRE AGASSI
                No! No! No!  This is the third time one 
                of you bitches stunk up my demi-glace!

  Andre Agassi dumps out a big pot of sauce.  Leo runs in.

                              LEO
                Andre, your kitchen s been infiltrated.  
                There s someone here who has been 
                  sabotaging you...

  WE PAN ACROSS the motley looking crew.

                              LEO (CONT D)
                I ve got to think if Jesus said anything 
                to give me a clue who it could be...

  THE CAMERA STOPS at a gap between cooks.  PAN DOWN - We see 
  Mr. Solo, dressed as a chef, looking around nervously.   Roman s Empire Writer s Second 03/14/0836.



  INT. OUTSIDE KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

  Andre Agassi throws Mr. Solo out on his ass.

  INT. KITCHEN - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

  Leo stands with Andre and Roman.  Nikki and Seb come in with 
  bags of food.

                              NIKKI
                We re back.

                              LEO
                Great! -- Wait, what is all this?

  Leo pulls out doughnuts, Slurpees and various jerkies.

                              SEB
                It was great, there s a 7-11 on the 
                corner.  We bought them out. -- Dude, 
                those lottery tickets are mine.

  Seb takes the tickets from Andre.  Roman is crushed.

                              ROMAN
                Well, there s always a first time for 
                failure.  It ll be all right.  I ll be fine. 
                -- What s it mean when your arm goes numb? 

                              LEO
                Roman, you ll be okay... We can deal with 
                this. -- Andre, Roman has told me for six 
                months how great of a cook you are.  
                We re two sets down, man.  We need this.  
                Is anything you can do?

  Andre stares intently at the food then holds up his hand.

                              ANDRE AGASSI
                Whisk me.

  QUICK DISSOLVES of Andre cooking, possessed.  He finally 
  paints the plate with a swath of sauce.

                              ANDRE AGASSI (CONT D)
                We have jalape o-burger-beef-dog done in 
                three ways.  Sauced with a blue woo-hoo! 
                slurpee reduction accompanied by a Slim-
                Jim and maple log ragout.

  They all watch expectantly as Roman takes a bite.

                Amazing.

  INT. RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER

  The party is in full swing.  People are having a great time 
  with the new food.

                              LEO (V.O.)
                With Andre s amazing food, the restaurant 
                was a complete success.  Oh, and Kelly 
                finally made her entrance...

  INT. LIMO

  Kelly, still thinking, grabs a soda from the mini-bar.  She 
  notices that the plastic label peels off and gets an idea.

  EXT. RESTAURANT

  Jesus and Mr. Solo are trying to make their escape as a LIMO 
  drives into frame knocking them to the ground.  Kelly opens 
  the door to the limo.  She steps one foot out and stays 
  there, smiling.  The paparazzi go crazy. 

                                PAPARAZZO #1
                Does that say what I think it does?

                She was on the covers for three weeks.  
                Doing what she could for mankind...

  Leo walks up to Roman.  Roman is on his cellphone.

                Wait, you had Wolfgang Puck lined up for 
                the food?  Roman, you could have handled 
                this.  Why did you let me...

  Roman smiles and motions with his head.  Leo turns as Nikki 
  runs up.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)   Roman s Empire Writer s Second 03/14/0838.

  Just like at the beginning of the show, Nikki leans in, SLOW-
  MOTION, and kisses Leo on the cheek.  Leo smiles.

                              LEO (V.O.)
                And that was that.  No matter how hard I 
                tried I knew I would be part of the 
                Pretty family for a very, very long time.

  Roman puts his arm around Leo.

                              ROMAN
                Welcome home, son.
