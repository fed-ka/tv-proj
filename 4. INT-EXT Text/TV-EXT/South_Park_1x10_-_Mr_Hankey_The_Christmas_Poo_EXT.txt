               snow are falling from the sky.

                         tongue, it's fun!

               VINCE GUARLDI piano MUSIC kicks in as all the kids catch 
               snowflakes.

               A flake lands on Stan's tongue.

               A flake lands on Cartman's tongue.

               Kenny points his head up, but just then a bird flies by and 
               shits in Kenny's mouth.

                         Hey! What the hell are you doing?! 
                         Jewish people can't eat Christmas

                         OFFICER BARBRADY!!

               Barbrady is standing in an intersection, directing traffic.

                                     BARBRADY
                         What?

                         IS IT ILLEGAL FOR JEWS TO EAT

                         Yes.

               Kyle stares down at the ground, pouting.

                         the mall and tell Santa Claus what 
                         we want for Christmas!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Yeah, we'll see you later, Kyle. 
                         Guess there's no reason for you to 
                         come since you don't get Christmas 
                         presents.

                         No, but I get Hanukkah presents for

                         Too bad it's usually a dreidel or 
                         something lame like that.

               Stan walks away from Kyle.

                                     STAN
                         We'll catch up with you later, Kyle.

               The kids all start to walk away from Kyle.

                                     KYLE
                         Wait! I may not have Santa, but I do 
                         have Mr. Hankey the Christmas poo!

               The boys all stop.

                                     STAN
                         What is this about Christmas poo 
                         dude?

                         Mr. Hankey. He comes out of the toilet 
                         every year and gives presents to 
                         everybody who has a lot of fiber in

                         Oh Kyle, c'mon seriously, you are 
                         really reaching right now.

                                     KYLE

                         see me riding around on Santa's sleigh 
                         with Mr. Hankey, fat ass!

                         You're not gonna ride on Santa's 
                         sleigh 'cause you're a Jew, KYLE.

                                     STAN
                         See ya, dude.

               Everyone leaves. Kyle stands there alone... Sad. Sad, soft 
               music begins.

                                     KYLE
                         It's hard to be a Jew on Christmas 
                         My friends won't let me join in any 
                         games 
                         And I can't sing Christmas songs 
                         Or decorate a Christmas tree 
                         Or leave water out for Rudolph 
                         'Cause there's something wrong with 
                         me 
                         My people don't believe in Jesus 
                         Christ's Divinity 
                         I'm a Jew 
                         A lonely Jew 
                         On Christmas...

               Kyle walks over to where he sees children laughing and playing 
               and sitting on Santa's lap. Kyle watches from the distance, 
               behind a tree.

                                     KYLE
                         Hanukkah is nice, but why is it that 
                         Santa passes over my house every 
                         year? 
                         And instead of eating ham I have to 
                         eat kosher latkeef. 
                         Instead of Silent Night 
                         I'm singing Ooo chach to ga vive and 
                         what the fuck is up with lighting 
                         all these fucking candles tell me 
                         please! 
                         I'm a Jew 
                         A lonely Jew 
                         I'd be merry, but I'm Hebrew 
                         On Christmas.

               The song ends. Kyle slowly walks away.


               It appears that the whole town has come to protest.

               Everybody is AD LIBBING complaints and shouts.

               The Mayor tries to quiet everybody down as she walks up to a 
               podium on the steps.

                                     MAYOR
                         Okay, everybody, settle down!

               A random WOMAN steps up, followed by a few townmembers.

                                     WOMAN
                         Mayor, we are deeply offended by the 
                         nativity scene in front of the capital 
                         office! Church and State are 
                         SEPARATE!!

               Her followers cheer. The town erupts again into complaints.

               Kyle walks up to where the other boys are.

                                     KYLE
                         What's going on you guys?

                                     STAN
                         The whole town is pissed off at each 
                         other. It's really sweet.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         That isn't all Mayor! The school 
                         play is doing a nativity scene! It 
                         isn't being sensitive to the Jewish 
                         community!

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         You ARE the Jewish community!

               The townspeople all AD LIB shouts and complaints again.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh boy, super bitch is at it again.

                         Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!

               The town Priest steps up to the front of the crowd.

                                     PRIEST
                         Mayor, the nativity is what Christmas 
                         is all about! If you remove Christ, 
                         you must remove Santa and Frosty and 
                         all that garbage too!!

               The Christians all cheer, some 'Boos'. The Mayor rolls her 
               eyes.

                                     OLDER MAN
                         And we must put a STOP to the cutting 
                         down of Christmas trees!!

                                     JIMBO
                         And I'm sick and tired of those little 
                         flaps on coffee lids! If you don't 
                         want to spill your coffee then you 
                         shouldn't be driving with it!!

               Silence... The townspeople all look around...

               Finally, they all cheer again, in spite of themselves.

                                     MAYOR
                              (Quieting them again)
                         Okay, people... Clearly we need to 
                         reach a compromise... Perhaps we 
                         need a new icon for Christmas.

               The mayor makes a specific 'all encompassing' gesture with 
               her hands (see Trey).

                                     ASSISTANT #2
                         Ooh! Brilliant idea Mayor!

               The townspeople think.

               The townspeople all AD LIB agreement.

               Everybody turns and looks at Kyle.

               Cartman and Stan roll their eyes.

                                     MAYOR

               The townspeople start taking decorations off the front of 
               the buildings.

               Jimbo is on a ladder in front of his store's doorway.

               Cartman, Stan and Kenny are waiting at the busstop.

                                     STAN
                         You guys!! I'm getting that John 
                         Elway football helmet for Christmas!

                                     CARTMAN
                         How do you know?

                                     STAN
                         'Cause I looked in my parents closet 
                         last night!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Yeah, well I sneaked around my mom's 
                         closet too and saw what I'm getting: 
                         The 'UltraVibe Pleasure 2000'.

                                     STAN
                         What's that?

                                     CARTMAN
                         I don't know, but it sounds pretty 
                         sweet.

               Kyle walks up, carrying a little shoebox.

                                     KYLE
                         Hello, everybody!

                                     STAN
                         What's in the box, Dude?

                                     KYLE
                         It's a surprise!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Lemme see!

                                     KYLE
                         Oh, okay, but don't scare him...

               Stan slowly opens the lid and peers into the box. Cartman 
               and Kenny look in as well.

               Silence...

               Silence...

               Kyle is the only one smiling, the other boys look deeply 
               disturbed.

                                     STAN
                         Dude! SICK!!!

               Kyle looks in the box, again Mr. Hankey is just a lump of 
               shit. No eyes, no hat, no gloves...

                                     CARTMAN
                         Is this some kind of Jewish 
                         tradition?!

                                     KENNY
                         Mph rmph rm rmph!

                                     KYLE
                         Wait you guys! He's alive!

                                     STAN
                         Kyle... I think you better get home 
                         and get some sleep.

                                     KYLE
                              (To the box)
                         COME ON, DANCE!! DANCE!!!

               Cartman, Stan and Kenny look at each other with deep concern.

                                     KYLE

                         This is horrible. Everybody's fighting 
                         and my best friend is in an 
                         institution... All because we didn't 
                         believe in Mr. Hankey.

                         Well, you can believe in him now.

               Two parents go hurling through frame, beating the shit out 
               of each other.

                                     STAN
                         I believe!

               Stan looks at Cartman.

                                     WENDY
                         I believe in Mr. Hankey!

                         HOWDY HO!!!

               The boys all turn to see Mr. Hankey! Who has flipped out of 
               his shoebox and is magically floating in the air.

                                     MR. HANKEY
                         HOWDY FOLKS! Gosh you sure do smell 
                         nice and flowery!

                         Whoa!!!

                         Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, 
                         I'm going home. Talking poo is where 
                         I draw the line.

                                     MR. HANKEY
                         What's all the ruckus?

                                     CHEF
                         I'm glad your here Mr. Hankey, the 
                         whole town is about to kill each 
                         other.

               Stan and Cartman watch this exchange with open mouths and 
               wide eyes.

                                     MR. HANKEY
                         I reckon this could be a job for Mr. 
                         Hankey!
