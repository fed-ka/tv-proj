      Peeling paint, chipped counter... and one very terrified
      male CLERK behind the counter.

      The Clerk slides a canvas bag across the counter to a MASKED
      BANDIT.  The Bandit wears a grey FEDORA pulled down over his
      eyes, a HANDKERCHIEF tied over his face and brandishes an
      old-fashioned TOMMY GUN.

                                    CORY
                    Relax!  I'm not going to hurt you.

      He stops, getting the BUZZ.  A BELL TINKLES behind him.  The
      Masked Bandit spins just as the front door swings shut behind
      Amanda.

                                      AMANDA
                    Uh, oh.

      Amanda and the Masked Bandit lock eyes.  A flash of
        recognition.

      The Clerk sees his chance to hit the ALARM.  SIRENS galore.

                                    CORY
                    Damn!

      He grabs the money from the counter, grabs Amanda's arm.

                    C'mon!  Time to blow.


      CORY RAINES is at the wheel.  Unmasked, fedora cocked back,
      he looks every part the handsome, debonair, gentlemanly...
      thief.  Amanda rides shotgun, feeding off his adrenalin rush,
      matching his excitement whoop for whoop.

                                    CORY
                    Seems like old times.

                    Yeah, I do.

      Cory glances at her out of the corner of his eye.

                                    CORY
                    Miss anything else?

      Amanda smiles mischievously, fondly remembering...

                                      AMANDA
                    Well --

      They both get the BUZZ.  Cory checks his rearview.  It's
      Richie on his bike.

                                    CORY
                    Hmmm... persistent little devil.

      speeds up alongside the driver's side.  He cranes his neck
      to look in the window and sees

      But Cory just shrugs it off -- a well worn gesture.

                    Maybe I want you all to myself.

      Richie sits poring over a glossy antique car book.

                                      MACLEOD
                    If you've got a better idea, I'm

                    Wait.  Here.

      He points to a gorgeous shot of a car that looks just like
      Cory's.

      The TELEPHONE RING ricochets off the walls of the empty loft.


      A vintage Pierce Arrow sits perched up on the garage lift. 
      Underneath a well-oiled mechanic, REYNALDO, puts the finishing
      touches on the exhaust system as Richie and MacLeod enter.

      Reynaldo turns back to the job at hand, ignores them.  Richie
      taps his shoulder.

      proud of himself.  He shoots Richie a look.

                                      RICHIE
                    I'll applaud later.

                                      MACLEOD
                    That'll be nice.


      In the B.G., two UNIFORMS take notes while they talk to the
      Clerk.  Off to one side, Robbery Detective DENNIS TYNAN, has
      just finished interviewing the owner, SAM GRINGKOV.  Gringkov,
      from hard-working, immigrant stock, is clearly upset.  Tynan,
      rumpled, Peter Falk at 40, is on top of the case.

                                      DETECTIVE TYNAN
                    Well, Mr. Gringkov, look at it this
                    way.  No one got hurt.  And they
                    didn't get away with much.

      Agitated, flustered, Gringkov nods quickly.

                                      GRINGKOV
                    Yeah.  Yeah.  Few thousand, I guess. 
                    Too early to tell.

      Tynan waves the Uniforms over.

                                      DETECTIVE TYNAN
                    Okay, boys.  We've taken up enough
                    of these folks' time today.  I'll
                    finish up here... meet you back at
                    the car.
                          (pats them on the
                            back)
                    Save me a donut.

      The Uniforms exit.  Tynan closes the door and turns back to
      Gringkov.

                                      DETECTIVE TYNAN (CONT'D)
                    So what happened?

      Gringkov's eyes turn to ice.  He drops the poor confused
      victim routine, spits his reply --

                                      GRINGKOV
                    You tell me.  There was one-point-
                    four mil in laundered cash and I
                    want it back!  What the hell I pay
                    you for?  So lowlife can waltz in
                    through front door and clean me out!?

                                      DETECTIVE TYNAN
                    I've already put the word out on the
                    street.  Nobody knows nothing.  The
                    guy came outta nowhere.

                                      GRINGKOV
                    I don't want hear no stinking excuses. 
                    All I know is I'm one and half million
                    poorer than I was this morning.  And
                    I am not happy.

                                      DETECTIVE TYNAN
                    I'll make it right.

      Gringkov gets in Tynan's face.

                                      GRINGKOV
                    You bet you make it right.  Find
                    money and bastard who stole it or
                    it's your ass.

                    I got the message.


      A fire CRACKLES in the big stone fireplace.  Bearskin rugs
      blanket a gleaming wooden floor.  Gershwin TINKLES from
      concealed speakers.  And standing center stage, Cory, in a
      burgundy silk robe, fills a crystal champagne flute with the
      best bubbly stolen money can buy.

      He gets the BUZZ.  No time to react.

      MacLeod bursts through the front door.  Richie kicks in the
      back.  They rush the room, swords at the ready.

      Richie lunges for Cory.

                                      RICHIE
                    Where is she, you bastard!?

      He looks to his partner for backup, but MacLeod is LOWERING
      his sword!

                                      MACLEOD
                    Cory!?

      Amanda appears from another room.  She almost drops her
      champagne glass.

                                      AMANDA
                    MacLeod!?

      Now it's Richie's turn.  Relaxing his attack stance, he aims
      his dropped jaw in her direction.

      And through it all, ever the charming host, Cory extends a

      FADE IN:


      Like a game of "Statues," everyone is still frozen.  Cory
      breaks the ice first.

                                    CORY
                    Serial monogamy, Amanda?

      He looks from MacLeod to Richie and back again.

                                    CORY (CONT'D)
                    Unless I'm seeing double... I count
                    two of them.

      He offers a champagne flute to MacLeod.

      RICHIE

      rushes up, knocks it out of his hand.  The glass SMASHES on
      the floor.  Cory turns to Richie, snaps his fingers --

                                    CORY
                    Now I recognize you.  You look a
                    little different flying over the
                    hood of a car.

      Richie cracks.

                                      RICHIE
                    How would you like to go flying
                    through a wall!?

                                      AMANDA
                    Listen, Richie.  Cory didn't mean
                    anything personal by it.
                          (beat)
                    Did you, Cory?

                                    CORY
                    No, of course not.  I don't know him
                    well enough to dislike him yet.

                    Alright!  That's it!

      Richie moves on Cory but MacLeod blocks him.

      Cory puts his arm around Amanda.

                    Let's everybody relax.  As you can

      Amanda taunts him with a smile.

                    four's just not sanitary.

      Cory turns to Amanda.

      At the wheel of her convertible roadster, Amanda argues with
      MacLeod.  She is dressed in her circus spangles and wearing
      a glittery turban.

                    But we signed on to Barnum and
                    Bailey's for a year.  We can't just

                    an act to replace us?

                    Let 'em use that third rate lion
                    tamer.  The "Amazing Amanda" does
                    not take second billing to anyone.

      She punches it again.  MacLeod grips the door handle.

                    And then expecting me to work that
                    tacky fortune teller scam between
                    shows!

      She tears off the turban and tosses it out of the car.

                          (trying to calm her)

                    that turban and crystal ball...
                    could've fooled me.

      Amanda growls and tromps on the accelerator.

                            (dismissive)

                    that why I spent sixty years
                      perfecting my tightrope technique?

      MacLeod mistakes this for a rhetorical question and doesn't
      reply.  Besides, he's got his eye on a HERD OF COWS looming
      up ahead.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)

                    these one-pump towns night after
                    night.  Where's the glamour?  Where s
                    the glitz?  Where's the Great White
                    Way?

      Up ahead, a herd of cows move slowly across the road.  MacLeod
      tries to get Amanda's attention.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Amanda!

      Taking desperate action, MacLeod wrenches the wheel from her
      grip and stomps on the brake with his foot.

      The roadster SKIDS to a stop centimeters from the cows.

                                      AMANDA
                    Edgy today, aren t we?

      An ARMORED CAR pulls up and stops on the other side of the
      herd.  MacLeod takes a deep breath and begins to relax, then
      he gets the BUZZ.  Amanda checks her mirror but MacLeod points
      through the windshield.

                                      MACLEOD
                    There.

      They watch as a sleek black ROADSTER pulls up beside the
      Armored Car.

      Out of this roadster jumps Cory, Tommy Gun in hand.  He runs
      to the Armored Car and hurtles a GAS GRENADE through the
      view slot.  It EXPLODES in a burst of SMOKE.

      MacLeod and Amanda are out of their car in a flash.  MacLeod
      starts moving through the cows that block his path.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Damn!
                          (to the cows)
                    Excuse me. Pardon me.

      On the other side of the herd, the two SECURITY GUARDS stumble
      out of the armored car, coughing and gagging from the gas. 
      Cory cold-conks both of the Guards, apologizing as he goes.

                                    CORY
                    Sorry, fellas.  But it's all in the
                    name of charity.

      The Guards lie motionless as Cory drags a couple of money
      bags from rear of the armored car.

      He takes a few bills, stuffs them into their shirt pockets.

                    There's a little something for your
                    trouble.  I'll mail you a receipt
                    for the rest.

      Cory tosses the money bags into his roadster, jumps in, does
      a 180.

      In the midst of the cows, MacLeod silently curses.

      tips his grey fedora, waves a cheery adieu to his captive
      audience as he speeds away.

                    So?  He saw it first.  C'mon,
                    Chicago's still fourteen hours away.


      Cory backs out of a small town bank, Tommy Gun aimed and
      ready.

      SUPER OVER   NEWSPAPER spins into frame, old newsreel style -
      front page headline reads  OKLAHOMA STAR - BANK ROBBERY SPREE
      SPREADS NORTH" as --

      SIRENS approach. Cory jumps into the waiting getaway car
      with Amanda at the wheel. They speed off down the road.


      Richie looks to Amanda and Cory.

                                    CORY
                          (fondly)
                    Boy, those were the days.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Are you out of your mind?  How many
                    bullets did they pump into you?

                                    CORY
                    More than Bonnie, less than Clyde. 
                    What's the difference?

      MacLeod signals to Richie, they're leaving.

                                      MACLEOD
                    C'mon Richie.
                          (to Amanda)
                    Amanda?

      Amanda knows that tone, she puts her champagne glass down. 
      She gathers up her things, follows Richie and MacLeod to the
      door.  Cory calls after --

                                    CORY
                    Amanda... think about tomorrow.

      Amanda just smiles.  As they move out, she blows him a kiss
      goodbye.


      MacLeod paces back and forth in front of an obstinate Amanda. 
      From the sidelines, Richie's eyes track MacLeod like a tennis
      ball at Wimbledon.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You're not actually thinking of
                    helping Cory rob the Federal Reserve!?

      Amanda only plants her feet firmer.

                                      AMANDA
                    So what if I am?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Amanda, this is not some Ma and Pa
                    outfit in Hicksville.  You're talking
                    about the Federal Reserve!

                                      AMANDA
                    C'mon MacLeod.  It's not the whole
                    Federal Reserve.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (dryly)
                    That's a relief.

                                      AMANDA
                    It's more like... a Federal Reserve
                    truck.  A little one.  And Cory
                    promised no one will get hurt.

                                      MACLEOD
                    He can guarantee that?

                                      AMANDA
                    He's got a plan.

                                      MACLEOD
                    He always has a plan!

                                      AMANDA
                    You are jealous.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I am not jealous.

                                      AMANDA
                          (doubts him)
                    Oh yeah?
                          (beat; believes him)
                    Why not?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Because this is all a big joke to
                    Cory, that's why.  You're shot, you
                    die, bingo, you pop back up again.
                          (with feeling)
                    Amanda, Immortality is a gift, not a
                    game.  You don't go running people
                    down for fun.

                                      RICHIE (O.S.)
                    Damn right.

      They both turn to stare at Richie.  In the heat of the moment,
      they forgot he was there.  A LONG BEAT as Richie feels their
      eyes on him.  He reddens.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    Not that I'm taking sides.

      MacLeod turns back to Amanda.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Listen, you get in over your head,
                    don't come looking for me to bail
                    you out.

      Amanda swallows.  Richie does a double take.

                                      AMANDA
                    What are you saying?  You're throwing
                    me out?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I didn't say that.

                                      AMANDA
                    Sounded a helluva lot like that to
                    me.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You don't need the money.

      But she stopped listening long ago.

                                      AMANDA
                    Far be it from me to stay where I'm
                    not wanted.

      She picks up her jacket, puts it on.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I didn't say I didn't want you here.

                                      AMANDA
                    I know what I heard.  You don't need
                    to tell me twice.

      She spins on her heels and storms out.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Amanda!

                                      RICHIE
                    Very smooth.

      MacLeod throws Richie a dark look.


      MacLeod comes out of the stairwell as Amanda moves toward
      the dojo entrance.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Amanda!

                                      AMANDA
                          (turns around; with
                          an edge)
                    What?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Why are you doing this?

                                      AMANDA
                    Why shouldn't I do this?

                                      MACLEOD
                    'Cause it's dangerous and it's stupid.

                                      AMANDA
                    So now I'm stupid, too.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Please...

                                      AMANDA
                    Please what?  Please don't rob the
                    Federal Reserve.  Please stay away
                    from Cory?

                                      MACLEOD
                    What you do with Cory is your
                    business.

                                      AMANDA
                    Exactly.

      Amanda starts to walk away.  MacLeod steps in front of her.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    Are you gonna stop me?

                                      MACLEOD
                    No.

                                      AMANDA
                    Then move out of my way.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Amanda, what do you want from me?

                                      AMANDA
                    It's amazing, MacLeod.  We've known
                    each other for 350 years and you
                    still don't know.

      MacLeod can only watch as she walks out the door.


      A surprised Cory opens his front door to find... Amanda.

                                    CORY
                    Well, well, well.  I thought you
                    said you weren't interested.

      She brushes past him.

                                      AMANDA
                    Yeah... I say a lot of things.  I
                    changed my mind.

                                    CORY
                    Woman's prerogative.

                                      AMANDA
                    Okay, let's see this plan of yours.

      She plops down on his sofa.  Cory accepts his good fortune
      and decides to shut his mouth as well as the door.  He pours
      Amanda a glass of wine, pulls out a map.

                                    CORY
                    Let's get down to business.


      Amanda lounging on the sofa.  She gets the BUZZ and glances
      toward the window.  She smiles, a knowing look on her face.

                                      AMANDA
                    I knew you'd come after me.

      But it's not MacLeod who comes through the back door.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    Richie!?  Where's MacLeod?

                                      RICHIE
                    Where's Cory?

                                      AMANDA

                    Forget it.  I'm doing the job, and
                    that's that.

                                      RICHIE
                    I'm not talking about the heist.
                          (beat)
                    I'm talking about you and Mac.

                                      AMANDA
                    You're wasting your time.

                                      RICHIE
                    Look, you don't really want to be
                    with Cory.  You're just doing it to
                    get back at MacLeod.

                                      AMANDA
                    Thanks for the insight, Oprah.  But
                    you're wrong.  I miss the good old
                    days.  Racing from town to town,
                    always one step ahead of the cops.

                    I know Mac comes on a little strong. 
                    But that's only because he cares
                    about you.

      Amanda looks up at him, half-hoping  -

                                      AMANDA
                          (beat)
                    He send you here to tell me that?

      As soon as Richie shakes his head, he realizes his mistake.

                    And that's the difference between
                    MacLeod and Cory!

      Amanda gets up, paces the room.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    A woman wants to be wanted.  Hell,
                    not just a woman... everyone wants
                    that.

                                      RICHIE
                    But he does want you.

                                      AMANDA
                    Then why didn't he tell me to stay.

                                      RICHIE
                    Amanda, nobody tells you anything.

                                      AMANDA
                    That's beside the point.

      She stops pacing, declares to no one in particular

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    No.  This is the right thing.  It's
                    time to cut loose again.  Time to
                    have some fun.
                          (beat)
                    You want to come along?


      Amanda spreads out Cory's map on a table, motions Richie
      over to see.

                                      AMANDA
                    This is the armored car route.

                                      RICHIE
                    Yeah, so?

      She points to an intersection on the map.

                                      AMANDA
                    And here's where they're gonna stop.

                                      RICHIE
                      Because...

      BLAM!  The cops fire at Richie.

      Tuck and roll and Richie somersaults to the back door,
      shoulders through it and into the surprised COP who waits.
      they both go down.  Richie takes him out with a punch and
      takes off.96506     "Money No Object"    40.    Final Shooting Script 8/14/96

      as CORY watches from behind cover.  He scans up and down the

                    She's been arrested.  Thanks to you.

      Sensing another impending blow, Cory puts up his hands in
      surrender.

                    but we've got us a little situation
                    here.

                    And I set the Saab to blow at 8:28.

      At this precise moment, the air is blasted by the strident
      strains of John Philip Souza.

      A HIGH SCHOOL MARCHING BAND swings around the corner. 
      Trombones booming, trumpets blaring, cymbals crashing...
      it's a nightmare of off-key ADOLESCENTS.  A BAND LEADER
      backpedals frantically in front of the band.

                    The plan.  Give me the keys!

      He grabs the keys and runs to the Saab.  Starts it and peels
      off down the road... in the opposite direction of the marching
      band.

                    just have to steal it.
                          (snaps fingers)
                    I got a plan!  We go for the Federal
                    Reserve truck again tomorrow --

                                      MACLEOD
                    No!

                                    CORY
                    C'mon.  It was a beauty of a plan. 
                    Uh, except for that little timer
                    thing.

      MacLeod smiles a frightening smile, bears his pearly whites
      in Cory's direction.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I've got a better idea, Cory.


      The briefcase sits in front of Gringkov and Tynan.

      Gringkov tries to open it, but it's locked with a COMBINATION
      LOCK.  He looks up at Cory who stands beside Amanda.

                                      GRINGKOV
                    What gives?

                                    CORY
                    You give up Amanda, and I give you...
                          (taps his head)
                    ...the combination to the briefcase.

      Gringkov aims his gun at the briefcase lock.

                                      GRINGKOV
                    Screw the combination.

                                    CORY
                    Uh uh uh... any attempt to tamper
                    with the lock will detonate the
                    contents.

                                      DETECTIVE TYNAN
                    You're bluffing.

      Cory shrugs...

                                    CORY
                    Your call.

      A BEAT as they all look at each other.

                                    CORY (CONT'D)
                    Mild weather for this time of year.

                                      GRINGKOV
                    Okay, untie her.  Get her outta my
                    sight.

                                      AMANDA
                      Pleasure's all mine.

      Cory unties Amanda, she gets up.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    Coming, Cory?

                                      GRINGKOV
                    He stays.

                                    CORY
                    You get going.  I'm right behind
                    you, doll face.

      Amanda leaves.  Gringkov gestures with his gun.

                                      GRINGKOV
                    The combination.

                                    CORY
                    Oh, yeah.  Lemme see if I can remember
                    how that goes.  Three, two, one...

      He opens his jacket, reveals the explosive vest, his finger
      on the plunger --

                                    CORY (CONT'D)
                    BOOM!  Can you say "incendiary
                    device?"

                                      GRINGKOV & TYNAN
                    You wouldn't!?

                                    CORY
                    Sixty seconds... and leave the money
                    on your way out.

      Gringkov stands there nervously.

                                      GRINGKOV
                    You're bluffing.

                                    CORY
                      Forty-five to go.

                                      DETECTIVE TYNAN
                    Hell, it's not my money.

      He rushes out.

                                      GRINGKOV
                    You're not that crazy.

      Cory reaches into his pocket and takes out a stick of
      dynamite.  He lights it.

      Gringkov runs out the door.  Cory smiles and pulls the fuse.


      MacLeod enters, sees Amanda's bags packed.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (re: suitcases)
                    Somebody leaving?

      Amanda tries to keep it light.

                                      AMANDA
                    Cory already blew town.  Said he had
                    a plan.  Time I hit the road, too. 
                    Least 'til Gringkov stops looking
                    for me.

      MacLeod watches her face.  He knows what she wants to hear. 
      It hangs like an unseen barrier between them.  Much to his
      own surprise, he says it --

                                      MACLEOD
                    I wish you could stay.

      And the invisible obstacle vanishes.  Amanda's up and across
      the room without touching the floor.  She looks up at MacLeod,
      into his eyes.  He meets her gaze -- no walls.

      They both know how much it took for him to give that to her.

                                      AMANDA
                    That's nice to hear.

      They kiss.  She pulls away and glances at her watch.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    But I really do have to go.

      MacLeod smiles.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Of course you do.

      Amanda gathers up her suitcases, starts for the door.  A
      toss of her head --

                                      AMANDA
                    Hey, Mackie-boy.  Maybe I'll see you
                    in Paris?

                    But of course, my cherie, but of
                    course.

      And she's out the door.

                                                                              FADE OUT.
