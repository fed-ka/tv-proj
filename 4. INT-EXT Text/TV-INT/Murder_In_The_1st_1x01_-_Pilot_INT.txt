      HILDY MULLIGAN (29), asleep in her bed, slowly opens her 
      eyes to discover her daughter LOUISE (6) standing next to 
      her, holding a phone. She speaks sleepily.

                                        HILDY
                      Who is it?

                                        LOUISE
                      It s dad. He said to wake you up.

      Hildy slowly sits up and takes the phone from Louise. She 
      looks at her CLOCK: 7:00 AM. She overslept.

                                        HILDY
                    Go get dressed, babe. Bobby s mom will be 
                      here any minute. 

      Hildy waits for Louise to leave, then pushes her dirty 
        blonde hair out of her face and moves to the window. 
      She s wearing a Ramones t-shirt, lace boyshorts -- she s 
        self-assured and sexy without knowing it, or caring.

                                        HILDY (INTO PHONE) (CONT D)
                      One of the rules of divorce is that you 
                    no longer get to wake me up.
                              (listening)
                      Mike. Stop. Lawyers? Are you threatening 
                      me? 
                              (listening, then exhales)
                      I get paid on Friday. I ll cut a check on 
                      Saturday. That s the best I can do. 

      She clicks off, dumps the phone on her bed. A beat, then 
      A CAR HORN BLASTS, outside. 

                                        HILDY (CONT D)
                      That s your ride! Put on your jacket!

      Hildy pulls on a SHIRT and PANTS and we follow her out 
      into the KITCHEN. Louise is looking in the FRIDGE: empty. 

                                        LOUISE
                      We re out of food.

                                        HILDY
                      I like your outfit.

                                        LOUISE
                      How was your date last night?

                                        HILDY
                      A disaster.

        Louise smiles and turns to her mom. She s mature for her 
      age and their rapport is more friendly than parent-child. 

                                        LOUISE
                      What happened?                                                                                        4.


                                        HILDY
                      Men always seem better on paper.
                      I ll get groceries after work.

                                        LOUISE
                      What about lunch?

                                        HILDY
                      You ll have to buy it at the cafeteria.

        Louise makes a disgusting face.

                                        HILDY (CONT D)
                      Relax. You ll survive. Take five bucks 
                      from my purse.

        Louise finds Hildy s purse and looks inside, accidentally 
        discovering HILDY S SIG SAUER P239. She takes it out and 
        turns, extending it to Hildy, trying to be helpful.

                                        HILDY (CONT D)
                      LOUISE! NO!

      HILDY RIPS THE GUN OUT OF HER HAND. Louise wells up. 
      Hildy grabs her in a hug, heart thumping, overwhelmed.

      [MOS] PRE-LAPPING SOUND: HEART MONITOR BEEPING

                                                                              CUT TO:



      CLOSE ON A MAN S HANDS, as they carefully assemble a 
      MODEL SAILBOAT, snapping pieces into place.

      TERRY SEAGRAVE (43) works at a desk cluttered with tiny 
      MODEL PARTS. He s rugged, built like a welterweight. 
        There s mileage on his face. His eyes have seen things. 
      But right now he s focused like a scientist on his boat.

      His wife EMILY (38), watches him from the hospital bed. 
      She s in grave physical condition, dying of cancer, but 
        currently smiling sideways as she eyes his contraption. 

                                        EMILY
                      Any chance that thing ever sails?

      Emily has a dry, sarcastic sense of humor -- it s her 
        defense mechanism, and her survival technique. Terry 
      turns to her and smiles. He didn t know she was awake.

                                        TERRY
                        Superstructure s intact. Deck beams are 
                      giving me trouble. I d say we re two 
                      nights away from a proper christening.
                              (beat)
                      How d you sleep?                                                                                        5.


                                        EMILY
                      The machines keep me up. The blinds don t 
                      close. There s no circulation in here. 
                              (beat, deadpan)
                      I slept great.

      Terry moves to her side and puts his hand against her 
      face, smiling. His eyes saying, you are beautiful.

                                        EMILY (CONT D)
                      I ve been having these vivid dreams, 
                      where I find myself reliving memories.
                              (beat)
                      It s probably the drugs. 

      Terry shrugs, then moves to the closet and puts on a 
      fresh shirt. He lives in this room these days. 

                                        EMILY (CONT D)
                      Remember the Redwoods up by Mendocino? 
                      That little State Park we went to?

                                        TERRY
                      Montgomery Woods.

                                        EMILY
                              (smiling)
                      You got naked in the Hot Springs with all 
                      those hippie pot-heads.

                                        TERRY
                      When in Rome.

      Emily cracks up at the memory, laughing.

                                        EMILY
                      You thought there was a snake in the 
                      water, remember? You went tearing out of 
                      there, sprinted all the way to the 
                      parking lot! God, that was funny. You 
                      looked so ridiculous!

      Terry forces a smile -- not that amused. Emily closes her 
      eyes, suddenly drained. There s some distance between 
      them, emotionally. Neither of them knows how this works.

        DOCTOR SHRAKE (50) pokes his head in from the hallway. He 
      sees Emily asleep, then indicates Terry outside.

                                        DR. SHRAKE
                      Got a minute?

                                                                              CUT TO:



      TERRY is outside Emily s room talking to their 
        oncologist, DR. SHRAKE. A tough, stark conversation.                                                                                        6.


                                        TERRY
                      What about Hopkins, the experimental 
                      injections? Let s do that.

                                        DOCTOR SHRAKE
                    We crossed that bridge two months ago. 
                      It s no longer an option.

                                        TERRY
                      She s a fighter, Doc. We re not going to 
                      give up. 

        Shrake exhales, determined to force Terry into reality.

                                        DOCTOR SHRAKE
                      She has stage-4 pancreatic cancer, Terry, 
                      and it has spread to her liver and lungs. 
                      The yellowing of her skin and eyes? It s 
                      jaundice, a by-product of the 
                        accumulation of bile acids throughout her 
                      body. She can t eat. Her weight loss 
                      alone is unsustainable. 
                              (beat)
                      She s dying, Terry, and she knows it. 
                      She s already lived longer than we ever 
                      thought she would. But whatever 
                      treatments we do now will just postpone 
                      the inevitable. If she s putting on a 
                      brave face, she s doing it for you. 

      Terry leans against the wall, fighting back emotions. 

                                        DOCTOR SHRAKE (CONT D)
                      Take her home for hospice. Let her last 
                      days be about her, not about you. 

        Shrake pats him on the arm, then walks away. 

        A devastating beat as reality lands hard, like a shot to 
      the gut. The CELL PHONE clipped to Terry s belt BUZZES, 
      but he doesn t react; locked into a thousand-yard stare.

                                        YOUNG UNIFORM (O.S.)
                              (pre-lap)
                      Coffee, Inspector?

                                                                              CUT TO:



      HILDY stares at a DEAD MAN in a tie-dye tee-shirt sitting 
      on a couch in a pool of his own blood. His name is KEVIN 
        NEYERS (50). There s a BULLET HOLE in his forehead. 

      YOUNG UNIFORM is next to her, holding a tray of coffees, 
      eager to please. She doesn t look at him.

                                        HILDY
                      Not necessary. I m awake.                                                                                        7.


      The room is a drug den, dilapidated, with aluminum foil 
      on the windows. UNIFORM COPS and EMT TECHS swarm around, 
        bagging EVIDENCE, snapping PHOTOS, DUSTING for prints. 

                                        SLUM LORD (O.S.)
                      I don t hear nothin ! 

                                        TERRY
                      That s a .44 Caliber hole in his head--

      Hildy turns and eyes TERRY, partially visible in the 
        HALLWAY. He has the SLUM LORD (40s, Chinese, broken 
        English) cornered, and is up in his face.

                                        TERRY (CONT D)
                      --You would ve heard that bullet.

                                        SLUM LORD
                      This is Tenderloin. Chinese New Year.
                      Boom boom boom! Explosions all time. 

      Terry shakes his head, then lets the SLUM LORD down and 
      moves to Hildy. They look at the body, comparing notes. 

                                        HILDY
                        Hollow-point. Splatter marks and narrow 
                      stippling burns put the shooter at point 
                      blank. 

                                        TERRY
                              (eyeing the blood on the wall)
                      The blood s still congealing. 

                                        HILDY
                      Dry patterns put T.O.D. at around 2 AM.

      Hildy moves to a small FRIDGE and looks inside.

                                        HILDY (CONT D)
                      He s got more groceries than I do. And 
                      enough fentanyl to kill an elephant.

      She takes out a ZIP-LOCK OF MEDICAL LOLLIPOPS, shows it. 
      Then she indicates the drug paraphernalia on the coffee 
      table in front of NEYERS: spoons, needles, a full baggie. 

                                        HILDY (CONT D)
                      Nearly a grand of product left behind.

                                        TERRY
                      Guess that rules out his dealer.

                                        HILDY
                      It s all laid out for us. Neat. 

      Terry looks at her, she s seeing something he s not.

                                        TERRY
                    Go ahead.                                                                                        8.


      Hildy pulls on gloves then picks up a used syringe.

                                        HILDY
                      This was jabbed into his leg, right 
                      there. See the mark? 
                              (beat, indicating)
                      The heroin was scattered around. There s 
                      blood on the needle, but the pump tube is 
                      clean. The syringe wasn t actually used. 

                                        TERRY
                      You re saying it s a decoy?

                                        HILDY
                      Just another dead junkie. 

                                        TERRY
                      Smart.

      They nod at the EMT TECHS indicating that it s safe to 
      move the body, then move towards the window. 

                                        TERRY (CONT D)

                      Out for a year.

                      Room was set and swept. Professional. 

                                        HILDY
                      Mediocre. But no accident.

        A uniformed cop, CAPUZZO (26), intercepts them.

                                        CAPUZZO
                      You should hear this. The neighbor across 
                      the street.

      Hildy and Terry nod, following Capuzzo out the front 
      door. [MOS] as behind, NEYERS is zipped into a BODY BAG.

                       round 2:30 AM. Me and the wife were up 
                      late, enjoying a smoke.--

                                                                              CUT TO:



      We re in the spacious cabin of Blount s private jet. His 
        corporate brain-trust is on board, scattered around the 
      cabin in plush leather chairs. Blount s younger than 
        everyone, but comfortably in charge. He holds up an iPAD.

                                        BLOUNT
                      --But the experience is limited by the 
                      delivery system. The future will be 
                      dominated by the first company able to 
                      eliminate the device.

        Seated across is board member SUSAN LIPTON (50, elegant). 

                                        LIPTON
                      How will that work, Erich?

                                        BLOUNT
                    By bringing the user directly into the 
                        application. An immersive, 3-D experience 
                      allowing them to travel inside our 
                      virtual worlds.

      The board members look at Blount. Blank stares. Blount 
      eyes the hourglass figure of his stewardess CINDY (29) as 
      she pours wine for board member PIERRE LECOURT (40).

                                        LECOURT
                      I don t understand, Erich. Are we opening 
                      a theme park?

                                        BLOUNT
                      That s funny.

        Lipton eyes IVAN WEXLER, seated behind Erich.

                                        LIPTON
                    Is there a prototype, Ivan?                                                                                        11.


                                        IVAN
                      Soon. We need this final investment to 
                      get us across the line.

                                        LECOURT
                      How much?

                                        BLOUNT
                      Fifty million.

                                        LIPTON
                      Can it wait until after the IPO?

                                        BLOUNT
                      This is the tech business. It s a race.

                                        LECOURT
                      Once we go public, you ll have plenty of 
                      money for R&D.

                                        BLOUNT
                      Then what are we waiting for?

        Blount looks at TINA MISHKIN (33), an attractive, sharply 
        dressed, Ivy League investment banker.

                                        TINA MISHKIN
                      After the Facebook debacle, it behooves 
                    us to do this roll out by the books.

                                        BLOUNT
                              (teasing)
                      Did you just say behoove?

      Next to Tina is DAVID HERTZBERG (40), Blount s slick, 
        powerful attorney. He s wearing a $5000.00 suit.

                                        HERTZBERG
                      She s saying we need to square away the 
                      Jeremy Leonard lawsuit. I agree.

                                        TINA MISHKIN
                      A legal challenge to the IP of your most 
                      profitable product is a major red flag. 
                      Investors are emotional. Herd mentalities 
                      are impossible to turn around. If public 
                      opinion moves against you, it could sink 
                      any potential IPO.

        There s something romantic in the way Erich looks at her.

                                        BLOUNT
                      You ve got a little food on your jacket, 
                      Tina. Right...there.

        Blount reaches over and wipes a crumb off of Tina s 
        breast. Tina can t help but smile, caught off guard. 
      Cindy shoots her a disapproving look, then exits to the 
        galley. A beat. Blount stands and looks at his team.                                                                                        12.


                                        BLOUNT (CONT D)
                      The Leonard lawsuit is a sideshow. My job 
                    is to keep this company focused on 
                      innovation. Deal with it, so I can lead.

        Blount exits to the rear galley. Everyone goes back to 
      work, chastised. Lipton eyes Tina, then shakes her head.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      Erich grabs Cindy by the arm and--

                                        CINDY
                    Is something wrong?

                                        BLOUNT
                      Absolutely.

        --steers her into the bathroom, sliding the door shut.

                                                                              CUT TO:



        Spacious, full of mirrors. They share an illicit smile. 

                                        CINDY
                      You re crazy.

                                        BLOUNT
                      Probably. But you know you love it.

      She reaches for his belt, opening it. He grabs her and 
      rips open her blouse. They start kissing, as we...


                                                                            FADE OUT:

      FADE IN:



      CITY STAFFERS and UNIFORMED COPS move in all directions, 
      in and out of open office DOORS. Terry and Hildy enter 
        through the main corridor, past the famous PLAQUE TO 
        FALLEN OFFICERS, towards the ELEVATORS, getting on.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      Terry and Hildy are suddenly alone. Terry eyes the iPAD, 
      then hands it to Hildy.

                                        TERRY
                      Take a look at this e-mail. The last 
                      message he sent.

      Hildy looks at the I-PAD, READS:  SENT MESSAGES  

              TO: ERICH BLOUNT
              FROM: KEVIN NEYERS
              Erich, my boy.

              Last chance.

      Hildy looks at Terry, caught off guard. The doors OPEN.

                                        TERRY (CONT D)
                      Who the hell is Erich Blount?

                                        HILDY
                      You re kidding, right?

                                                                              CUT TO:



        A tight, narrow room twenty years behind the times. 12 
        CUBICLES. COMPUTERS. FILE BOXES stacked to the ceiling. 

      Terry and Hildy are mid-debrief with Lieutenant JIM KOTO 
      (35), Japanese American, all business, with movie-star 
      looks and a Stanford degree.   Behind Koto are INSPECTORS 
      DAVID MOLK (45), fat, smart, but lazy; and his tall 
        partner HENRY NAVARRO (35), ambitious but not bright.

                                        TERRY
                      Erich Blount. One of these Silicon Valley 
                      brats.

      Hildy eyes Terry, sideways -- he s suddenly an expert.

                                        KOTO
                      The CEO of Applicon. I know who he is.

                                        HILDY
                      The victim sent him a threatening e-mail 
                      the night before he was killed. 

                                        TERRY
                    We found it on this. 

      Terry hands Koto the I-PAD. He turns it on.

                                        MOLK
                      Junkie with an iPad, and we re still 
                      using PalmPilots.

                                        TERRY
                      It s a threat. It implies an existing 
                        relationship.

                                        KOTO
                      It s pretty vague. 

                                        HILDY
                      I agree. We have no idea if that s even 
                      Blount s e-mail address. And there s no 
                      evidence that he ever replied. 

                                        KOTO
                    Is there an obvious connection between 
                      Blount and the victim?

                                        HILDY
                      No.

                      But we re just getting started.                                                                                        15.

                      Let me see the body.

      Hildy hands KOTO a folder of blurry photos from the crime 
        scene. He flips to a gruesome shot of KEVIN NEYERS.

                                        HILDY
                      Kevin Neyers. Age 50.

                      Twenty arrests on his record. Half a 
                      dozen convictions. Possession.

                                        HILDY
                      Not exactly a boy scout.

      KOTO holds up a photo of the FENTANYL POPS.

                      That should narrow down the dealers.

                      character and see if he got this e-mail.

                      Reach out to his office, but use 
                      discretion, Seagrave. Blount s got sway 
                    in this building.

                      Just let Mulligan do the talking.                                                                                        16.


      Terry eyes Hildy, smiling. Molk and Navarro move back to 
      their desks. Koto looks at Terry, speaks quietly.

                                        KOTO (CONT D)
                      How re things?

      Terry just shrugs. Koto pats him on the shoulder, then 
      walks away. Hildy looks at Terry kindly, they share eyes. 
      They both know that  things  are not good.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      High above, ERICH BLOUNT walks onto a floor of COMPUTER 
        PROGRAMMERS -- Applicon s nerve center.                                                                                         18.


        Everyone looks barely out of high school, dressed 
        casually, listening to music on headphones, hacking away. 
      One by one they notice Blount and stop working.

                                        BLOUNT
                      It s gametime. Who wants a promotion?

        A beat. Everyone gathers around, nervous and excited. 
        Blount s not just the boss, but a rock star to them.

                    So the game is simple. One of our 
                      corporate partners has been using a bug 
                    in one of our Apps to collect UDIDs--
                      unique device identifiers--zip codes, 
                      phone numbers, user preferences...a 
                      pretty sophisticated violation of 
                      privacy. They re storing our data on a 
                      secure database, complete with reverse 
                      track cyber forensics, the works. So, the 
                      first one who can hack around their walls 
                      and then track down our UDIDs using our 
                      preexisting digital fingerprints without 
                      setting off any alarms, wins a new job 
                      and a hundred thousand dollar raise.  

        Excitement in the room. 

                                        YOUNG PROGRAMMER #1
                      Where do we start?

                                        YOUNG PROGRAMMER #2

                              (beat, realizing; to BLOUNT)
                      Wait. What s the company?

      Half nod and jump to work. The other half hesitates. 

                                        BLOUNT (CONT D)
                      All of you still standing, you re out of 
                      the competition. 

      The hesitaters jump to their computers and hack away. 

                                        BLOUNT (CONT D)
                      Let s remind our partners that they re 
                      vulnerable, and that they shouldn t screw  
                      with our data!

                                                                              CUT TO:                                                                                        19.



      Terry and Hildy wait at the MAIN DESK in the bustling, 
        marble lobby. SUITS and PROGRAMMERS swarm to and fro. 
        SALTER approaches them. Terry smiles at his old buddy.

                                        TERRY
                      Captain Salter!

                                        SALTER 
                              (shaking hands)
                      It s just Jimmy now, Terry. Miss 
                      Mulligan.

                                        HILDY
                      Nice to meet you. I ve heard good things. 

                                        SALTER
                      You ve got two minutes. Make it snappy.

      They follow him towards the ELEVATOR BANK.

                                                                              CUT TO:



        Blount walks through the programmers, admiring the chaos 
      that he has created, as BAY-BELL DATA pours over screens. 

                                        TONIA
                      Got it!

      An attractive young female programmer, TONIA (20) with 
      funky blue hair, pushes back from her desk. Blount moves 
      to her, studies her screen. 

      ANGLE AT THE EXIT -- Salter, Terry and Hildy appear and 
      stand at the edge of the room, quietly watching.

      Then a LOUD RING. It s Blount s CELL. He looks at it, 
        caught off guard. Concern on his face. He answers, 
        putting it on speaker phone.

                                        BLOUNT (INTO PHONE)
                      This is Erich.

                                        SHEPARD (O.S.)
                              (phone filter)
                      Blount! What the hell?!

                                        BLOUNT (INTO PHONE)
                      Who s this?

                                        SHEPARD (O.S.)
                      Bob Shepard!

        SHEPARD S voice is ferocious, you can feel his anger 
        spilling out of the phone. Panic ripples across the room. 
      Terry and Hildy share eyes. Blount feigns surprise.                                                                                        20.


                                        BLOUNT (INTO PHONE)
                      What s wrong, Bob?

                                        SHEPARD (O.S.)
                    My network s being hacked. Two million 
                      customers are about to lose phone 
                      service. It s a goddamn meltdown. 

                                        BLOUNT (INTO PHONE)
                              (beat, downplaying)
                      It s gotta be China.

                                        SHEPARD (O.S.)
                      Bullshit, it s you! Your entire 
                      programming department is attacking my 
                      main frame! I ve got all the IPs right 
                      here! I m calling the FBI!

        Blount looks around at his team. Terror on their faces, 
      as they all push back from their machines.

                                        BLOUNT (INTO PHONE)
                      Slow down, Bob. Let s figure this out.

                                        SHEPARD (O.S.)
                      Who the hell s Tonia Kravitz?

      All eyes swing to TONIA. She s nervous, sweating. 

                                        BLOUNT (INTO PHONE)
                      She s new. Entry level. 

                                        SHEPARD (O.S.)
                      Let me talk to her.

        Blount indicates her over, hands her the phone. She 
        swallows hard, totally in shock.

                                        TONIA (INTO PHONE)
                      Hello. This is Tonia.

        A beat. Then a sweet new tone by Shepard.

                                        SHEPARD (O.S.)
                      Congratulations Tonia. Well done. You 
                      just got promoted.

        Everyone computes, then GROANS. LAUGHTER. They ve been 
      had. Blount eyes Tonia, as she exhales.

                                        BLOUNT
                      Nice work. That was fun.

      He turns and sees Salter standing with Terry and Hildy. 
        Salter nods, indicating him over.

                                                                              CUT TO:                                                                                        21.



        A small alcove on the other side of the elevators.  
        BLOUNT studies a photo of KEVIN NEYERS. Salter stands by 
      the door. HILDY and TERRY stare out the WINDOWS -- the 
      same CITY perspective as in the opening hologram. 

        Blount looks at Hildy. They hold eyes for a brief second  
      -- a flash of chemistry, which Terry catches. Blount 
      hands Terry the photo of Neyers.

                                        BLOUNT
                      It s hard to say. I meet a lot of people. 
                      Why? Who is he?

                                        HILDY
                      Kevin Neyers. He was killed last night in 
                      the Tenderloin.

                                        TERRY
                      Shot in the head. Point blank.

        A beat, as Blount processes, blown back.

                                        HILDY
                    We found an iPad in his apartment. The 
                      last e-mail he sent was two nights ago. 
                    It was to you.

      Terry hands Blount a printout, which he reads.

      ANGLE ON PRINTOUT, E-MAIL MESSAGE READS: 

              TO: ERICH BLOUNT
              FROM: KEVIN NEYERS
              Erich, my boy.
              Help an old man out. 
              $50,000 by dawn, or I ll go public.
              Last chance.
              KN

        Blount studies it.

                                        TERRY
                    Do you remember getting that e-mail?

                                        BLOUNT
                      No. But I m way behind on e-mails. We had 
                      a corporate retreat in Santa Fe. I ve 
                      been out of town all week. 

      Terry and Hildy look at Salter. He nods, confirming. 

                                        HILDY
                    Do you have any idea who this guy is, or 
                      what he s referencing when he says he ll 
                    go public?                                                                                        22.


                                        BLOUNT
                              (shakes his head)
                      I get three thousand e-mails a day. 

                                        TERRY
                    Do they all involve blackmail?

                                        BLOUNT
                      Most ask for money. Some send business 
                      proposals, others issue vague threats. It 
                      comes with the territory. We log them 
                      all. Jimmy can show you.

                                        HILDY
                      Any idea how he tracked down your 
                      address?

                                        BLOUNT
                      Erich at Applicon dot com. It s public, 
                    on our web site. I try to stay 
                      accessible. 

                                        TERRY
                      Man of the people.

      Hildy and Salter shoot Terry eyes: behave.

                                        SALTER
                      Okay, I think we re done. 

        Blount smiles at Hildy, who smiles back. There s a subtle 
        chemistry between them. Then Blount abruptly walks off. 

        Salter guides Terry and Hildy back to the elevators. 
      Hildy hands Salter her business card.

                                        HILDY
                    If he remembers anything, have him give 
                    me a call. That s my cell.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      Hildy drives through the city, back towards the 
        Tenderloin. Remnants from the LUNAR PARADE line the 
        streets. Terry stares out the window, thinking.

                                        TERRY
                      That stunt with his programmers? He s a 
                      pretty good liar.

                                        HILDY
                    As far as the e-mail goes, I thought he 
                      was credible.

                                        TERRY
                    He was smooth.                                                                                        23.


                                        HILDY
                    He was in Santa Fe. 
                              (beat)
                      Why? You think he knows more?

                                        TERRY
                      Guys like him always know more.

                                        HILDY
                      Well I thought he was charming.

      Terry shoots her suspicious eyes. She smiles, teasing. 

                                        TERRY
                      Let s just go find our copper thieves. 

                                                                              CUT TO:



      Terry opens the FRONT DOOR, turns on a LIGHT. A beat, 
      then a short, attractive Dominican woman, NURSE JOSEFINA 
      (35), appears from the hallway.

                                        NURSE JOSEFINA
                    Hi Mister Seagrave, I m Josefina.

                                        TERRY
                      The nurse?

                                        NURSE JOSEFINA
                      Yes. Doctor Shrake sent me over.

      Terry just stares at her. He s not ready for this.



      EMILY is lying a hospital bed, which has been situated by 
      the window overlooking the city. She s sweating, staring 
      out. Terry quietly enters, stopping and staring at her. A 
      beat. She knows he is there, but doesn t look.

                                        EMILY
                      I m not suddenly contagious.

      She turns and smiles, but none of this is funny to Terry. 

                                        TERRY
                      I met Josefina.                                                                                        27.


                                        EMILY
                    My new best friend.

                                        TERRY
                      She seems nice.

                                        EMILY
                      She s helping me die. She better be nice.

      Terry exhales, biting his tongue. He eyes a PICTURE FRAME 
      on the mantle above her bed--

      ANGLE ON PHOTO: A younger Terry standing between Emily 
      and Hildy, arm in arm at a picnic. A simpler time.

                                        TERRY
                      Your sister called me. I told her to come 
                      over in the morning.

                                        EMILY
                      Great. If cancer doesn t kill me, her 
                      stories will.

        A beat. Terry s had enough.

                                        TERRY
                      You gotta stop saying things like that, 
                      Emily.

                                        EMILY
                      Saying what?

                                        TERRY
                      Making jokes.

      She turns and looks out the window, biting her tongue.

                                        TERRY (CONT D)
                      Look. I m going to take a couple days off 
                      from work. I should be here with you.

                                        EMILY
                              (cold and firm)
                      We ve discussed this. You d go crazy. 
                      Keep living, Terry. Go to work.

      Off on Terry, exhaling. He has no idea how this works.

                                                                            FADE OUT:

                                      END OF ACT TWO                                                                                        28.


                                            ACT 3

      FADE IN:



      HILDY is working on her computer. KOTO is looking over 
      her shoulder. NAVARRO is at his desk. They all do their 
      best to ignore Terry, who is in a foul mood, struggling 
      to close a stuffed, broken drawer in his desk. 

      He rattles it around, forcing it. Angry. Then he finally 
      just rips the drawer out, SLAMMING IT ON THE FLOOR. It 
      makes a loud sound, like a GUN SHOT. 

        Everyone stares at Terry like he s lost his mind. A beat. 
      Terry leaves. Then Koto looks at Hildy.

                                                                              CUT TO:



        Terry, fuming, crosses the hall and slams into the men s 
      room, nearly breaking the door.

                                                                              CUT TO:



        Terry, at the sink, splashes water on his face, then 
      dries himself with a paper towel. He stares into the 
        mirror, angry, but trying to gather himself.

      The door opens and Hildy enters. She looks to make sure 
      they are alone, then moves next to Terry. A long beat. 
      She doesn t know what to say.

                                        TERRY
                      Don t tiptoe around me. 

                                        HILDY
                      Look, you re going through a lot. 
                      Everyone understands.

                                        TERRY
                      What do they understand? Because I don t 
                      understand any of it! 

                                        HILDY
                    So bag it and go home. Go be with Emily.                                                                                        29.


        A tough beat. He shakes his head, then turns to Hildy, 
        lowering his guard, desperation in his eyes.

                                        TERRY
                      I can t just sit there and watch her die. 

                                                                              CUT TO:



      Hildy and Terry return from the bathroom. Terry is 
        composed now, all business. They gather around Hildy s 
        computer again, with Koto and Navarro looking on.

      ANGLE ON HILDY S COMPUTER: Flickering with faces, as she 
        searches the criminal database for BIG BIRD TATTOOS.

                                        KOTO
                      How many Big Bird Tattoos?

                                        HILDY
                      Fifteen.

                                        NAVARRO
                      And who said PBS is on the ropes?

                                        HILDY
                      The problem is, none of them are blue.

                                        TERRY
                      Maybe we ve got the wrong character.

                                        KOTO
                      What else do we have?

                                        TERRY
                      Not much. Neyers doesn t seem to have any 
                      living relatives. His body s still 
                      unclaimed at the morgue.

                                        HILDY
                    We looked back through his record. He had 
                      a regular accomplice early on.

                                        TERRY
                        A girlfriend.

                                        KOTO
                    Is she worth talking to?

                                        HILDY
                      She s dead. Oakland P.D. found her in an 
                      alley 25 years ago. Coroner said it was a 
                      routine O.D.. No foul play.

                                        TERRY
                      But Neyers and this girl got in a lot of 
                      trouble together.                                                                                         30.


                                        HILDY
                      Her parents are still around. James and 
                      Betty Harbach. We ve got an address for 
                      them in Oakland. At the moment, other 
                      than Blue Big Bird, that s all we ve got.

                                        TERRY
                                (disagreeing)
                      We ve got the e-mail to Blount.

                                        HILDY
                      Blount claims he didn t get the e-mail. 
                    He was in Santa Fe.

        A beat. MOLK enters from the break room, full of vigor.

                                        MOLK
                      Just an FYI, I m on The Master Cleanse.

                                        NAVARRO
                      The what?

                                        MOLK
                      The Master Cleanse. Lemons. Cayane 
                      Pepper. Don t touch my juice in the 
                      fridge.

      They all look at him, then away -- to be ignored.

                                        KOTO
                      Molk and Navarro, take over the search 
                      for Blue Big Bird. Narrow the field. 

                                        MOLK
                      Blue who?

                                        KOTO
                              (to Hildy and Terry)
                      Take a field trip to Oakland. Talk to the 
                        girlfriend s parents. Maybe we ll get 
                      lucky.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      James Harbach triple locks the door. The house was last 
        decorated in the 1970s. A variety of old exercise 
        equipment. Oakland A s memorabilia. Golf on the TV. 

      Terry and Hildy are greeted warmly by BETTY HARBACH (70), 
        dressed like June Cleaver.

                                        BETTY HARBACH
                      Would you like some tea? 

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                      Make this quick. I m watching golf.

                                        BETTY HARBACH
                      I don t drink black teas, I m allergic to 
                      tannins. But I do have green, camomile, 
                      and pomegranate.

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                      Who died?

                                        HILDY
                      Green tea would be nice.

                                        TERRY
                      Your daughter, Sarah Harbach--

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                      She died 25 years ago. You re late.

                                        TERRY
                      --She had a friend named Kevin Neyers. 

                                        HILDY
                    He was murdered two nights ago. We found 
                      his body in the Tenderloin.

      An awkward beat, as James and Betty barely flinch. Betty 
      moves to the kitchenette, puts a pot on the stove.

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                      Well if you find out who killed him, give 
                      them our congratulations.                                                                                         32.


                                        HILDY
                      I know it s been a long time, but do you 
                      know of any enemies he might ve had? 

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                      Sure. Here s a list of them.

      James picks up a WHITE PAGES off the floor and tosses it 
      to Terry. He catches the book and eyes Hildy.

                                        BETTY HARBACH
                    He killed our daughter. You understand.

                                        HILDY
                      I thought she died from an overdose.

                                        BETTY HARBACH
                    He fed her those drugs. It s how he 
                      controlled her.

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                    He was an addict. A pimp. He turned our 
                      daughter out, knocked her up, and then 
                      left her to die.

                                        TERRY
                      When was the last time you saw him?

      Betty and James hold a look.

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                    It had been 25 years.

                                        BETTY HARBACH
                      And then about 6 months ago he showed up.

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                    He tried to squeeze some money out of us. 
                      I told him to get lost or I d call the 
                      cops. 

      Terry takes out a piece of paper and hands it to James. 

                                        TERRY
                      That s the last message Kevin Neyers 
                      sent, the night before he was killed.
                              (James studies it.)
                    Do you know the man he sent it to? 

      Betty moves to James and looks at the e-mail. Shock reads 
      on both of their faces, as they look at Hildy and Terry. 

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                      Erich Blount.

                                        BETTY HARBACH
                      Our grandson. Kevin s son.

                                                                              CUT TO:                                                                                        33.



      Hildy and a subdued Terry finish their interview with the 
        Harbach s over coffee at an old fashioned diner.

                                        BETTY HARBACH
                    It was Erich Blount who figured out that 
                    he was our grandson. I have no idea how. 
                      But he had put it together. 

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                    He has money, Betty. You could find Jimmy 
                      Hoffa with his money. 

                                        HILDY
                    So Erich came and saw you first, before 
                      Kevin?

                                        BETTY HARBACH
                    He knocked on our door about a year ago. 
                      I knew he was our grandson the moment I 
                      laid eyes on him. He has Jimmy s nose.

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                    We had him in, talked to him for hours. 
                    He had a lot of questions. We told him 
                      everything, as best we could. Then he was 
                      gone. Just like that. Didn t leave us a 
                      penny. An address. Nothing. We haven t 
                      seen him since.

                    Oh I don t blame him James. He doesn t 
                      owe us anything.

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                              (bitter)
                      A little charity wouldn t have killed 
                      him.                                                                                        35.


        A beat. Terry signals for the check.

                                        BETTY HARBACH
                      Can I ask...are you two married?

      Hildy almost drops her coffee. Terry freezes.

                                        BETTY HARBACH (CONT D)
                      Because I see you talking with your eyes 
                      the way us married couples do.

                                        HILDY
                      We re just partners. 

                                        TERRY
                      It s sort of the same thing. 

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                      But without the sex. Ha!

      Hildy looks away, embarrassed.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      Hildy drives Terry across the crowded BAY BRIDGE. They 
      are back at work, debating the investigation.

                                        HILDY
                    So let s assume Neyers was Blount s 
                      biological father and he was asking for 
                      hush money, to keep the family secret. If 
                      Blount really cared, why wouldn t he just 
                      pay the guy off and be done with it? 

                                        TERRY
                       cause then you re never done with it. 
                      The question is why did Blount lie to us.

                                        HILDY
                      We re cops. Everybody lies to us.

                                        TERRY
                    Or maybe he was involved.

                                        HILDY
                    Or maybe he just didn t want us digging 
                      into his past.

                                        TERRY
                      Too late for that, I guess.

                                        HILDY
                      Blount s interesting. There s no doubt 
                      about it. But his involvement in Neyers  
                      death is nothing more than a theory. He 
                      was in Santa Fe. We have zero evidence. 
                    We don t have a case. 
                                        (MORE)                                                                                        36.

                                        HILDY (CONT'D)
                      Now Blue Big Bird, that s a case. We ve 
                      got two witnesses placing him at the 
                      scene. 

                                        TERRY
                      Except we don t know that Blue Big Bird 
                      actually exists.

                                        HILDY
                      Molk and Navarro will find him. 

                                        TERRY
                              (shoots her eyes: please)
                      Let s have one more conversation with 
                      Blount.

      Terry DIALS A PHONE NUMBER, puts it on speakerphone.

                                        SALTER (O.S.)
                      Salter.

                                        TERRY
                      Jimmy, it s Terry Seagrave. Listen, I 
                      need to speak to your boss again. 

                                        SALTER (O.S.)
                      He s on his way to SFO. He s got a 
                      meeting in LA. 

                                        TERRY
                      When is he back?

                                        SALTER (O.S.)
                      Listen, Terry. His lawyer s David 
                      Hertzberg. You know him?

                                        TERRY
                      Pitbull. Sure.

                                        SALTER (O.S.)
                    He ripped my head off for letting you 
                      speak to Blount without him. I m on thin 
                      ice. From now on you gotta work through 
                      Hertzberg. Call his office. Set it up.

      Terry clicks off, shares a look with Hildy. He looks out 
      the front window. They are just off the BAY BRIDGE on the 
      101. Hildy puts on her blinker to exit downtown.

                                        TERRY
                      Don t exit. Stay on the 101.

      Hildy looks out the window at the SIGNS ABOVE THE 
        FREEWAY, INDICATING THE AIRPORT, then at Terry.

                                                                            FADE OUT:

                                    END OF ACT THREE                                                                                        37.


                                          ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:



      Terry and Hildy enter the main cabin, looking around in 
      awe. CINDY eyes them from the rear galley, where she 
        unloads bottles of wine and sparkling water.

                                        CINDY
                      Can I help you?

                                        HILDY
                      We re looking for Erich Blount. 

      BILL WILKERSON (40), Blount s all-American Pilot, exits 
      from the cockpit, holding his flight log.

                                        TERRY
                      Are you the pilot?

                                        WILKERSON
                      That s right. Bill Wilkerson.

      They flash their BADGES.

                                        TERRY
                    We were told to meet Mr. Blount here. 
                      He s helping us with an investigation.

        Wilkerson eyes them up and down.

                                        WILKERSON
                      He ll be here any minute. Have a seat.

      Terry and Hildy sit in the plush leather seats. They 
      share eyes. The plane is spectacular and intimidating. 
      Terry smiles at Wilkerson, on edge.

                                        TERRY
                    Do you mind if I take a look at your 
                      flight log? 

        Wilkerson looks at him, caught off guard. He hands the 
        FLIGHT LOG to Terry. He flips through it.                                                                                        38.


                                        TERRY (CONT D)
                      You flew into Santa Fe on Monday. It says 
                      here you were parked there until you flew 
                      back on Thursday?

                                        WILKERSON
                      That s right. We were there for The 
                      Applicon Board meeting.

                                        TERRY
                    So Mr. Blount was with you?

                                        WILKERSON
                      Yes. It s his company. And his plane. 
                      What s this about?

                                        HILDY
                    Is there any chance Blount left Santa Fe 
                      during that period?

                                        WILKERSON
                      Not that I know of. We went jogging every 
                      morning. He had meetings all day with the 
                      board. Dinners and drinks at night. He 
                      was the center of attention all week. I 
                      doubt he had a moment to himself.

        HERTZBERG and BLOUNT enter the plane from the TARMAC, 
        surprised to find Hildy and Terry. An awkward beat.

                                        HERTZBERG
                      What s this?

      Cindy hides in the galley. Wilkerson hesitates. Blount 
        pushes past Hertzberg, recognizing Terry and Hildy.

                                        BLOUNT
                      Inspectors Mulligan and Seagrave. SFPD. 

                                        TERRY
                    We just have a couple of questions, Mr. 
                      Blount.

                                        HERTZBERG
                              (firm, to Hildy and Terry)
                      I m his attorney. We re late. Call my 
                      office. We ll set a meeting. 

                                        TERRY
                              (undeterred, to Blount)
                      It ll just take a minute. But we can have 
                      you come down to 850 Bryant Street if you 
                      prefer. 

        Hertzberg and Blount hold eyes. A blatant threat.

                                        BLOUNT
                      I ve got exactly one minute.                                                                                        39.


      Hildy takes out the photo of KEVIN NEYERS, and the E-MAIL 
      print out and hands them both to BLOUNT.

                                        HILDY
                      You sure you don t recognize this man?

                                        BLOUNT
                      I told you I meet a lot of people.

                                        TERRY
                      Which really isn t an answer. 

        A beat, as Blount studies Terry s face, dead serious. 
        Blount makes up his mind, and opens up.

                                        BLOUNT
                      Okay, yes, I ve seen him. His name is 
                      Kevin Neyers. Chances are he s my 
                      biological father. I m adopted. I was 
                      curious. Jimmy Salter and I did some 
                      research. We narrowed it down to this 
                      guy. I went to meet him a couple of 
                      months ago, I thought it might have some 
                      meaning, maybe answer some existential 
                      questions. But you saw how Neyers lives. 
                      He s a junkie. Worthless. I felt bad for 
                      him. But I didn t feel any sort of 
                      biological kinship. I was disappointed, 
                      but I was also relieved. I realized that 
                      I wasn t missing anything. I am who I am. 
                      I was raised by loving, adoptive parents. 
                      I lucked out. Kevin Neyers was my sperm 
                      donor, nothing more. So I gave him some 
                      money and said goodbye. But I guess he 
                      figured out who I was, found my e-mail 
                      address and started asking for money. 

                                        HILDY
                    He threatened you with going public.

                                        BLOUNT
                    To announce to the world that he was my 
                      father? Do you think anybody cares?

                                        TERRY
                      Maybe you care.

                                        BLOUNT
                      No, I don t. If anything, it s kind of 
                      funny. I mean, my dad was a junkie, a 
                      pimp and a two-bit con; and my mother was 
                    an addict and a whore. And here I am, on 
                    my private jet. Only in America, right? 

                                        TERRY
                      Why didn t you tell us this before?

                                        BLOUNT
                      You didn t ask.                                                                                        40.


                                        TERRY
                      Well then, I d hate to make that mistake 
                      twice. 
                              (beat, firm)
                      Mr. Blount, did you kill Kevin Neyers? 

                                        HERTZBERG
                              (reeling, furious)
                      That s enough! Don t answer that question 
                      Erich. 

                                        BLOUNT
                      Relax, David. I didn t kill Kevin Neyers. 
                      That s ridiculous, and they know it. 

        Blount looks at Terry and smiles -- back off.

                                        BLOUNT (CONT D)
                      Now if you ll excuse me, I have $400 
                      million on a table in Century City. 
                      Someone s trying to take it from me. I 
                      need to go get it back.

      Hildy and Terry hold a look. They re done.

                                                                              CUT TO:



        Blount stares out the window, lost in his head. His mood 
      is foul, as he looks out at BEVERLY HILLS.

                                                                              CUT TO:



        A bland conference room. BLOUNT and HERTZBERG are mid-
        negotiations, sitting across from JEREMY LEONARD (29), 
        over-dressed in Brioni, and HANK HOWEY (51), his lawyer. 
      The WEST HOLLYWOOD HILLS are visible out the windows. 

                                        LEONARD
                      The contract was signed based on 
                      misleading assumptions. It was for my 
                      services, not my proprietary IP.

                                        BLOUNT
                      I bought your company. It included your 
                      services, and your proprietary IP. 
                              (indicating)
                                        (MORE)                                                                                        41.

                                        BLOUNT (CONT'D)
                      It s right there in the signed contract. 
                      Have you read it?

                                        LEONARD
                      You misled me. You never used my 
                      services.

                                        BLOUNT
                      They weren t necessary. You should be 
                      happy. I paid you to do nothing.

                                        LEONARD
                      You defrauded me, Erich! All you ever 
                      wanted was my tree game app. You turned 
                    my software into 400 million dollars of 
                      revenue! I m entitled to a big chunk of 
                      that upside! 

                                        BLOUNT
                              (holds up his middle finger)
                      You re entitled to this.

        Hertzberg shoots Blount eyes, saying let me do this.

                                        HERTZBERG
                      How much is it going to take, gentlemen?

                                        HOWEY
                      200 million seems more than fair.

                                        HERTZBERG
                      2 million. Cash. Or we ll take it to 
                      court and win.

                                        LEONARD
                      That s insulting! That s nothing!

                                        BLOUNT
                      Actually, it s exactly 2 million dollars 
                      more than nothing. More than you deserve.

                                        LEONARD
                    Do you really want a messy trial, Erich? 
                      Just as you re ramping up for an IPO? 

                                        BLOUNT
                      Are you threatening me? 

                                        LEONARD
                      You claim you re this tech genius, this 
                      modern Edison! Wait until the world 
                      learns that you re a fraud!

      All eyes on Erich, full of rage. He leans across the 
      table and gets in Leonard s face. He could kill him.

                                        BLOUNT
                      You get nothing, you ungrateful prick. 
                      Without me, you are nothing. Worthless. 
                                        (MORE)                                                                                        42.

                                        BLOUNT (CONT'D)
                      I could find a thousand Indian 
                      programmers who could do what you did 
                      with that app. You re a gold digger, 
                      Leonard, and you happened upon a diamond. 
                      But you weren t even smart enough to 
                      recognize it. You should thank me for the 
                      pants you re wearing. Everything you have 
                      you owe to me. 
                              (beat, ferocious)
                      When I m done with you, with all the 
                      lawyer fees, you ll have nothing, which 
                    is exactly what you deserve. This is war. 

        Blount slams out of the room. Leonard is shell shocked. 
        Hertzberg stands and smiles, an ice-cold professional.

                                        HERTZBERG
                      Gentleman, see you in court.

                                                                              CUT TO:



        BLOUNT is in a foul mood, staring out the window as they 
      fly up the coast. HERTZBERG is seated across, eyeing him.

                                        HERTZBERG
                      How about a glass of wine?

      No reaction. Hertzberg motions to CINDY in the back. 

                                        BLOUNT
                      I want you to destroy him, David. I don t 
                      care how much it costs.

                                        HERTZBERG
                      I m happy to take your money, but you re 
                      making a mistake. Offer Leonard ten, 
                      he ll settle for twelve point five. 
                      That s chump change compared to the price 
                    of a trial. 

                                        BLOUNT
                    He gets nothing. Just do your job. 
                              (beat)
                    Or maybe I ll find a new lawyer.

        Hertzberg doesn t react, calling his bluff. 

                                        HERTZBERG
                      Maybe you should.

        Blount shoots him eyes, then an angry smile. Cindy 
        approaches and pours Erich a glass of wine. 

      Then the plane hits a sudden BUMP of turbulence and she 
        SPILLS THE WINE all over Blount s designer t-shirt. He 
      jumps out of his seat and pushes her back, enraged.                                                                                        43.


                                        BLOUNT
                      Idiot! 

                                        CINDY
                              (trembling)
                      I m so sorry. 

                                        BLOUNT
                      This t-shirt s worth more than you are! 
                      $400 bucks!

        Erich s wipes his shirt, seething, staring at poor Cindy, 
      venom in his eyes. She s stammering, frozen to the spot.

                                        CINDY
                      I ll get a...club soda.

                                        BLOUNT
                      Don t bother. 
                              (beat)
                      Your job is to make my life easier. But 
                      you don t do that, Cindy, which makes you 
                      useless.

        Blount pulls off his shirt and THROWS IT AT HER FACE. She 
        catches it, fumbling, tearing up. Overwhelmed. 

        Blount moves to a cabinet and opens it, full of clothes. 
      Then he realizes that Cindy is still standing there, 
        frozen. He shoots her condescending eyes.

                                        BLOUNT (CONT D)
                              (low, ice-cold)
                      You re fired. Get out of my face.

      Cindy rushes back into the galley, breaking down. 

        A beat. Then Blount exhales, shaking his head. He finds a 
      fresh t-shirt in the cabinet and pulls it on. Then he 
      sits back down and flips on the TV. 

      ANGLE ON TV: The Kardashians. Sexy and stupid.

        Hertzberg looks at Blount, all business.

                                        HERTZBERG
                      Feel better?

                                        BLOUNT
                              (thinking, then:)
                      Yeah. I do.

                                        HERTZBERG
                      Are you sleeping with her?

                                        BLOUNT
                              (smiles)
                      Not anymore.                                                                                        44.


                                        HERTZBERG
                      Well you can t fire her. With the lawsuit 
                      and everything that s going on...she 
                      knows too much. She could bury you. 

                                        BLOUNT
                      She s a flight attendant. She s nothing. 
                      And she can't talk anyway. She signed a 
                        non-disclosure agreement.

                                        HERTZBERG
                    So what? Hell hath no fury like a lover 
                      scorned.
                              (beat)
                      Look, Erich, at some point you need to 
                      realize that it is far better to have 
                      your enemies inside your tent pissing 
                      out, than outside your tent pissing in.

        Blount stares at the TV -- his emotions have vanished, 
        replaced by a cool pragmatism.

                                        BLOUNT
                      I ll take care of it.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      Cindy is reeling in the bathroom, wiping away tears. She 
        reaches into her pocket, pulls out a tin of ALTOIDS. 
        Inside is a vial of COCAINE and pink STRAW. She taps out 
        a line of blow on the glass wash basin -- a total pro.

      CLOSE ON HER HEAD, as she lowers it, snorting--

                                                                      MATCH CUT TO:



        --CINDY PULLS HER HEAD UP, and we re now in her 
        apartment. She s out of uniform, in her robe, doing drugs 
      and drinking wine. The doorbell rings. She stores the 
      coke in a drawer, then moves out into the living area-- 



        A generic, mid-80s, two-story TOWNHOUSE, decorated with a 
        woman s touch. Cindy passes the staircase to the second 
      floor as the bell RINGS again. She opens the front door.

      Her estranged husband MARCO (34, Hispanic) is outside. He 
      looks harmless in his chinos and eyeglasses. But the 
      edges of tattoos are visible at his collar and cuffs.

                                        CINDY
                      What are you doing here, Marco?                                                                                        45.


                                        MARCO
                      I ve left you a bunch of messages. You 
                      won t return my calls.

                                        CINDY
                      Right. Get a clue.

                                        MARCO
                      Why you gotta be that way?

                                        CINDY
                      Because I don t want to see you. We re 
                      getting a divorce. That s how this works.

      Marco stares at her, takes a long look.

                                        MARCO
                      You re off.

                                        CINDY
                      I m what?

                                        MARCO
                      You re high. I can see it in your eyes.

                                        CINDY
                      You just can t handle the fact that we re 
                      done. Good bye, Marco.

                                        MARCO
                      When did you relapse?

      She starts to shut the door but Marco blocks it with his 
      foot. He s tough and not to be fucked with. He tries to 
      push past her, inside. But she blocks him, pushing him 
        wildly. He grabs her. She scratches at him, yelling.

                                        CINDY
                      Leave me alone!

      Marco pulls her inside and throws her to the ground. 
      She s reeling, scared. Marco looks around, in her purse, 
      on the shelf...then in the bathroom, opening the drawer 
      and finding the cocaine. He shows it to her.

                                        MARCO
                      What s this?!

                                        CINDY
                      I can use if I want. I can do what I 
                      want. I can sleep with whoever I want!

      Marco SLAPS HER, HARD right across the face, knocking her

      Cindy cries, in a heap on the floor.

                                                                            FADE OUT:

      FADE IN:



      Hildy is sitting on Louise s bed, tucking her shirt into 
      her jeans, then kissing her on the forehead.

                                        HILDY
                      Off to school, sweet Lou Lou.

                                        LOUISE
                      Mom, can I ask you a question?

                                        HILDY
                    Of course, babe. What is it? 

                                        LOUISE
                      What happens if you get shot at work?
                      Will I have to live with Dad?

                                        HILDY
                    No one s going to shoot me, Louise. 

                                        LOUISE
                      Then why do you have to carry a gun?

                                        HILDY
                      Because I m a cop. We all carry guns. 
                      That s why the bad guys don t shoot us.

                                        LOUISE
                              (beat; furrows her brow)
                      I don t like being divorced.

                                        HILDY
                      Trust me, it wasn t my original plan.
                      But when life gives us lemons...

                                        LOUISE
                      ...we make lemonade.

      Hildy looks at Louise lovingly. A car honks.

                                        HILDY
                      There s your ride.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      The front door is open, as Louise hugs her mom, then 
      exits with her backpack.

                                        HILDY
                      Have a great day, sweetie.                                                                                        47.


                                        LOUISE
                      I will! Bye! 

      She disappears down the stairs. Hildy closes the door.

      She exhales, then picks up a few of Louise s TOYS on the 
        floor. The TV is on low, playing THE GREAT MUPPET CAPER. 
      She moves to turn it off, but then one of the characters 
        catches her eye.

      ANGLE ON TV: As a giant, grumpy BLUE BIRD speaks.

                                        SAM THE EAGLE (ON TV)

                      American."

        A flicker in Hildy s eyes. Lightbulb.

                                        HILDY
                      Blue Big Bird!

      She opens up her LAPTOP, logs into the SFPD CRIMINAL 
        DATABASE and types in three search terms.

        TATTOO - NECK - SAM THE EAGLE

        A beat, then a MUG SHOT and PROFILE of a man named CHRIS 
        WALTON (38), flashes on screen. A perfect match. A long 
      list of convictions. She dials TERRY, smiling.

                                        HILDY (CONT D)
                              (into Phone)
                      I found our man.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      On the onboard COMPUTER SCREEN is an image of CHRIS 
        WALTON. Hildy and Terry scan the scene outside.

                                        TERRY
                      Looks like Christmas.

                                        HILDY

      Terry looks to the side where a smaller group of addicts 
        huddle in an alleyway, transacting business. 

                                        TERRY
                      That s our boy.

      She nods, then she looks in the rearview MIRROR -- Molk 
      and Navarro are in the cruiser behind.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      --A KITCHEN, full of CHINESE COOKS. Walton jumps around 
      the startled workers, towards the other side. He grabs a 
      pot of NOODLES, spilling it on the floor. Countermeasure.

      Hildy is through the door, right on his tail. She slips 
      on the steaming pile of noodles, CRASHING HARD TO THE 
        GROUND. Pain, as Walton escapes out the door, ahead.                                                                                         49.


      Hildy grabs the counter top, pulling herself back up to 
      her feet, then weaving through the COOKS, out the door.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      Hildy and Terry huddle with Koto as ASSISTANT DA LOPEZ 
      (34, Hispanic) approaches, clearly annoyed and pressed 
      for time. Hildy hands Lopez the FILE on Chris Walton. 

                                        HILDY
                      How much room do I have with this guy?                                                                                        50.

                      No. No family. No friends.

                    as a mitigating factor.

        WALTON is handcuffed, seated at a table, wearing a dry 
      set of jail-house REDS, staring at a VIDEO CAMERA in the 
      upper corner of the room. HILDY and TERRY enter. Hildy 
      sits across from Walton, as Terry takes off his cuffs.

                                        HILDY
                      Talk to us about Kevin Neyers.

                                        WALTON
                      Who s Kevin Neyers?

                                        HILDY
                      The guy you killed two nights ago.

        A beat. Walton shoots her eyes and smiles.

                                        WALTON
                      Sounds like I need a lawyer.

                                        HILDY
                      Okay. That s your right. 
                              (beat)
                      But you understand that once you lawyer 
                      up, any chance of a deal goes out the 
                      window. 

                                        WALTON
                      I don t need a deal. I didn t kill 
                      nobody.

                                        TERRY
                      You know a man named Erich Blount?

                                        WALTON
                      No.                                                                                        51.

                      Were you hired by Erich Blount to kill 
                      Kevin Neyers?

                                        WALTON
                      Only ones ever paid me to kill a man was 
                      the United States Army.

      Hildy eyes Terry, she doesn t want to go down this road.

                                        HILDY
                      Let s go back to the night you killed 
                      Kevin Neyers. Why d you leave the 
                      fentanyl in his fridge?

                                        WALTON
                       cause you got the wrong man, understand? 
                      I didn t kill him. Now I want my lawyer.

      Terry leans against the wall behind Walton. Hildy looks 
      down at her notes, eyeing his rap sheet.

                      We ve got your prints at the scene, and 
                      the Fentanyl Pops we found on your person

                      What kind of a deal are we talking  bout?

      She pushes a pen and pad across the table.                                                                                        52.

                    Do I look like Travelocity? Would you 
                      like a rental car during your stay? 

                                        WALTON
                      FCI Herlong, up in the Sierras. Put me 
                      there at 20 and 15, and I ll confess.

                      Write it out and you ve got a deal.

        Walton looks at her, then picks up the pen and starts 
        writing. Hildy stands to leave.

                                        WALTON
                              (beat, shit-eating grin)

                      thing. Come close.

        Terry, behind him, SMACKS WALTON IN THE HEAD, then yanks 
      his chair backwards, spilling him onto the floor. Hildy s 
        frozen in the doorway, as Terry KICKS HIM in the ribs.  

                                                                              CUT TO:



      As Terry slams out of the Interrogation Room, followed by 
        a seething Hildy. She gets right up in his face.

                      What the hell was that all about? It was 
                      over! He was writing the confession!

                                        TERRY
                    He needed to learn some manners. I took 
                      him to charm school.

                                        HILDY
                              (fierce and angry)
                    Oh and what are you, Prince Charming

                      helpless female partner?                                                                                         53.


                                        TERRY
                    He deserved what he got. I was just 
                      trying to help.

                                        HILDY
                    If I needed your help, I would ve said 
                      so. 

      Terry leans against the wall, surprised by her response.

                                        HILDY (CONT D)
                      Look, I understand what you re going 
                      through, but that was over the line. What 
                    if he doesn t sign that confession? What 
                      happens then?

                                        TERRY
                      He ll sign. He s got no choice.

                                        HILDY
                              (firm, an order)
                    Go home. Be with your wife. Deal with 
                      your anger. I don t want to see you again 
                      until you re under control.

      Hildy walks away as Terry reels, frozen to the spot.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      EMILY stares out the window at the sheets of RAIN. TERRY 
        quietly enters. JOSEFINA is in the corner, folding 
        hospital sheets. She smiles at Terry, then leaves. 

      Terry stares at his wife. She s beautiful, illuminated by 
      the soft glow of CITY LIGHTS out the window. She can t 
      bring herself to look at him. An everlasting beat.

                                        EMILY
                    We had a good time, Digger.

      Terry smiles, his heart quietly breaking.

                                        TERRY
                      You haven t called me that in years.                                                                                        54.


      She turns and smiles, then motions him over. He gets into 
      the bed next to her, puts his arm around her. She rests 
      her head on his shoulder. They stare out, into the city. 

                                        EMILY
                      I was just thinking about your 30th 
                      birthday. 

                                        TERRY
                      Roller coasters.

                                        EMILY
                      There was that one we kept riding over 
                      and over again.

                                        TERRY
                      The Inferno.

                                        EMILY
                              (she smiles; a good memory)
                      You were scared.

                                        TERRY
                              (feigns defensive)
                      You were the scared one. 
                              (beat; then smiles, admitting)
                    It was pretty high.

                                        EMILY
                      I d never seen you scared before. Until 
                      then, you were just this rock. Strong. 
                      Fearless. But the Inferno broke you down.

                                        TERRY
                    It was embarrassing. I was worried you 
                      were going to dump me right there. 

                                        EMILY
                      No, baby. That was the exact moment when 
                      I realized I loved you. That I would 
                      always love you.

        A long, raw beat. They share vulnerable, loving eyes. 
      Then Terry speaks quietly, tinged with desperation.

                                        TERRY
                      I m scared, Em.

                                        EMILY
                      I know. 
                              (beat)

      Terry looks at her, then out the window, welling up.

                                        EMILY (CONT D)
                      I m so sorry to be leaving you, Digger. 
                      Promise me that you ll keep on living. 
                      Live for the both of us. Cherish every 
                      sunrise, every cup of coffee. Keep 
                      laughing. Fall in love.                                                                                         55.


                                        TERRY
                      I ll never love anyone the way that I 
                      love you.

                                        EMILY
                    So love them differently. But don t stop 
                      loving. Don t look back. I ll be right 
                      there, making wise-cracks by your side.

      He looks at her, studying her face, her eyes, desperate 
      to remember this moment. Knowing it could be their last.

                                        TERRY
                      I m going to miss you, Em. Every minute 
                    of every day.

      Tears well for both of them, as we 

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:



        Wilkerson presses buttons, loading in his next flight. 
      Shaw sticks his head in. He s worried.

                                        SHAW
                      I tried her home, her cell. Sent her a 
                      text. She s MIA. You sure she doesn t 
                      still think she s fired?

                                        WILKERSON
                      No, I talked to her last night. She said 
                      Erich apologized. She promised me she d 
                    be here. 

                                        SHAW
                      I ve got a weird feeling.

      They share a troubled look. Wilkerson looks at his watch.

                                        WILKERSON
                      We ve got a couple hours. I ll go to her 
                      house. Can you finish this up?

                                        SHAW
                    Of course.

        Wilkerson pushes out of the pilots seat, exiting.

                                                                              CUT TO:                                                                                        56.



      Emily is asleep. Her sister KAREN (45) is sitting by her 
      side, reading a book. Terry enters, showered and dressed, 
        holding his phone. He looks at Karen, uncertain.

                                        KAREN
                      It ll be fine, Terry. Go to work. 

                                        TERRY
                      You ll call me.

                                        KAREN
                      I promise.

                                                                              CUT TO:



        LANDLADY and WILKERSON enter. The room is dark. The 
        shades are closed. Wilkerson turns on LIGHTS, revealing--

        CINDY, LIFELESS, NAKED, sprawled at the bottom of her 
      steep STAIRCASE. It looks like she took a brutal fall.

                                        LANDLADY
                      Dear Lord!

        Wilkerson rushes to Cindy, turning her head. Her eyes are 
      open, her neck broken. Terror on his face, and certainty. 
        Landlady leans against the wall, dizzy. Wilkerson sees a 
      PILL BOTTLE and scattered PILLS near Cindy s body.                                                                                         57.


                                        WILKERSON
                      Damnit, Cindy!

        Wilkerson turns and eyes the Landlady. She s frozen.

                                        WILKERSON (CONT D)
                      Call the police!

        A beat. Then she rushes, flailing, looking for a phone, 
      then heading outside.

        LANDLADY POV AS SHE OPENS THE DOOR -- BLINDING SUN FROM 
        OUTSIDE, WHICH WE HOLD, THEN-- 

                                                            SEAMLESS TIME CUT TO:



        --MATCH ON THE SUN, THEN PAN DOWN TO REVEAL-- 

        A GIANT CRIME SCENE. LANDLADY S POV now belongs to HILDY. 
      She s standing in the same spot, staring out the door. 
        UNIFORM COPS and EMT TECHS swarm the property. The street 
      is lined with CRUISERS, FIRE TRUCKS, and AMBULANCES. 

      Hildy turns back into the Townhouse. UNIFORMS work the 
      room, snapping photos, dusting for prints, collecting 
        evidence. Terry is by the body with an EMT TECH (40). 

                                        EMT TECH
                      Best guess is, it was an accident.

                                        TERRY
                      Couldn t she have been pushed?

                                        EMT TECH
                    If she d been pushed, she would have gone 
                      down the stairs head first. But she 
                      slipped backwards at the top, cracked the 
                      back of her head. 
                              (indicating)
                      You can see the indentation on her skull. 
                      And there s a blood mark on the top 
                      stair. That probably knocked her out. 
                      Then she tumbled down the staircase like 
                      a rag doll, hit her leg on the rail 
                      there, which caused that contusion and 
                      twisted her around. She landed on her 
                      neck. We can t confirm cause-of-death 
                      until the autopsy and toxicology report. 
                      They ll verify her injuries, and see how 
                      many pills she took. But the lady 
                      obviously fell down the stairs. 

      Terry and Hildy walk towards the front door. There s 
        tension between them, still lingering from Terry s 
        outburst with Walton.                                                                                        58.


                                        TERRY
                      Did Walton sign off on the confession?

                                        HILDY
                      Yes.

                                        TERRY
                      Are we okay?

                                        HILDY
                      You tell me.

      They stare out at the crime scene. On the front lawn, a 
        visibly shaken WILKERSON is giving his statement to a 
        UNIFORM COP.

                                        WILKERSON
                      She d never been late before. We knew 
                      something was wrong.

      Terry grabs a FRAMED PHOTO from the ENTRY TABLE next to 
      the door. He looks at it, then hands it to HILDY.

      ANGLE ON THE PHOTO: CINDY and ERICH BLOUNT, arms around 
      each other like lovers, standing in front of his jet.

                                        HILDY
                      Two deaths. 

                                        TERRY
                      One common denominator.

                                        HILDY
                        Coincidence?

                                        TERRY
                    No such thing.

                                        HILDY
                      What about Walton?

                                        TERRY
                      Guess we need to circle back.

      They share eyes, then stare back out at the wild scene.

                                        HILDY
                      Dust off your top hat. This is going to 
                    be a circus.

      Terry smiles. Then his cell phone BUZZES. He takes it out 
      and stares at the screen. His face is suddenly white, 
        drained of blood.

                                        TERRY
                      Emily.

      He stands there, frozen to the spot. Hildy pushes him.                                                                                        59.


                                        HILDY
                      Go!

      Terry snaps to and races out the door, to his car.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      Terry stares at Emily, by her bedside. Emily s sister and 
        Josefina are behind him. The sister indicates them out of 
      the room, leaving Terry alone to say goodbye.

        A beat. He wipes away a tear. He looks at her face, her 
      eyes are closed. He puts his hand to her cheek, lovingly. 
      But it s different now. Just her body. She is gone.

      He reaches down, finding her hand, sliding off her 
        wedding ring. He stares at it in his hand, grasps it 
        tightly. He kisses her on the forehead, then stares out.

                                        TERRY
                      I m not saying goodbye. 

      He looks upward, as a tear streams down his face.

                                        TERRY (CONT D)
                      Don t you dare leave me.

      He wipes away the tear, then puts his head down, resting 
      it on her body, breaking down.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      Terry sits in front of the TV. It s on, but he s not 
        watching it -- a thousand-yard stare.

      Emily is gone. The family, the nurses, the hospital bed, 
      it s all gone.

      He stands up and moves to the table and stares at TWO 
      BOXES full of his belongings from the hospital. 

      He takes out his model SAIL BOAT and carefully places it 
      on the DINING TABLE, centering it, then straightening the 
      thin wooden mast. He looks at his boat, sadness in his 
      eyes, then RAGE-- 

      HE SMASHES THE BOAT WITH HIS FISTS, over and over, 
        breaking it into a million little pieces. He sinks to his 
        knees, drained of emotion. 

        A long beat. The DOOR BELL rings, but he doesn t move.

                                        HILDY (O.S.)
                      It s me. I got your message. Open up.                                                                                        60.


      He slowly stands, then opens the door. Hildy is standing 
      on the front porch with a pizza and six-pack of beer. 
      He s too vulnerable to look her in the eyes.

                                        HILDY (CONT D)
                      Sausage, mushrooms and onions. 

      Terry indicates her inside. She puts the pizza and beer 
      on the kitchen table, pushing aside the scraps of wood 
      that used to be his MODEL BOAT. She takes off her jacket.

      They stand and look at each other. She moves to him, puts 
      her arm around him. Hugs him. He hesitates at first, then 
      lets her, taking refuge in her embrace. 

                                        TERRY
                      She was this beautiful light, this 
                      flower. 
                              (beat)
                      She was so much better than me.

      He looks at Hildy, then lets her go. She moves to the 
      table and cracks open two beers, handing one to him.

                                        HILDY
                    To Emily.

        A beat. Terry nods, then looks up and smiles. Silently 
        saying his farewell. They clink bottles and drink, moving 
      to the window, staring out. 

      RED AND BLUE LIGHTS dance across the horizon. The SFPD.

                                        TERRY
                      This job. What we do. I give it 
                      everything. 

                                        HILDY
                      You give it too much.

                                        TERRY
                      No. It s my chance, my one chance. To 
                      live right. To do good. 
                              (beat)
                      But no matter how hard we try, the world 
                      isn t just.  cause if it were, I d be 
                      dead, and she d get to live.

        A beat. Then he looks at Hildy and smiles, grateful.

                                        TERRY (CONT D)
                      You ve kept me going through this, Hildy, 
                      kept me on the rails.

      She smiles, then holds up her beer bottle.

                                        HILDY
                      Partners.                                                                                        61.


        A beat. He smiles, then clinks her bottle with his. They 
      stare out at the city together. Humbled. Alive.

                                                                            FADE OUT.

                                        THE END
