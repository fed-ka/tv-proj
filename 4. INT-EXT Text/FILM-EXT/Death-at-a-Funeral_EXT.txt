END CREDITS
We see NORMAN'S CAR speeding along the freeway.
We see Norman's car exiting the freeway.
MUSIC: "PAPER PLANE" by M.I.A.
Elaine and Oscar are walking up the stairs of a typical college
apartment building.
CAMERA is in the entry way now shooting outside. A TOWN CAR
exits, leaving Ryan in front of the house. RYAN, Aaron's
younger brother is taller, more confident, and more successful.
He moves slowly towards CAMERA and through the front doorway as
CAMERA PULLS BACK with him.
RYAN
Hello! Mom!
We see Norman's car turn into "Lakeview Retirement Community."
He drives past the sign and through a gate.
Norman is driving behind three OLD LADIES on mobile chairs.
He's honking at them. He finally sees Uncle Russell.
NORMAN
There he is.

DEREK
You didn't tell me the guy was in a
wheelchair.
UNCLE RUSSELL, an elderly man in a wheelchair, sits in his
chair.
Norman drives forward and stops alongside the old man. He rolls
down his window and speaks very slowly with a huge smile on his
face.
NORMAN
(OVER ENUNCIATING)
Hello, Uncle Russell. How are you?
We're here to take you to the funeral.
UNCLE RUSSELL
Where the fuck have you been, you fat
bastard? You're late. If you took
any longer I'd be dead, too.
The fake smile falls off Norman's face.
Norman gets out of the car. The other car contains Jeff, Oscar
and Elaine. Jeff gets out first followed by Elaine.
NORMAN
Elaine, I was going to park there.
ELAINE
Are you family, Norman?
NORMAN
Well, no, but I'm like family.
ELAINE
No such thing.
Derek leans out the window.
DEREK
Hi, Elaine.
(CONTINUED)
21.
CONTINUED:
ELAINE
What are you doing here?
DEREK
Your father invited me.
ELAINE
Oh please.
She grabs Oscar and heads to the house followed by Jeff.
Oscar, Elaine and Jeff are walking to the house as other people
arrive.
OSCAR
It's very green here, isn't it?...
Green... Very green... Very...
green.
Elaine takes Oscar to the side.
ELAINE
Oscar, are you alright?
OSCAR
What do you mean?
ELAINE
All this talking about phantom dogs
and things being green... What's
going on?
OSCAR
What are you talking about? I' fine .
Never been greener.
Oscar wanders off, leaving Elaine with Jeff.
JEFF
Elaine, what's wrong with Oscar?
ELAINE
I don't know. Something's not
right...
ANGLE ON: Oscar as he wanders around the yard.
ELAINE (CONT'D)
I think it's the Valium.
JEFF
Valium?!
ELAINE
I gave him a Valium at your place. I
think he's just not used to it.
JEFF
Oh, right.
(CONTINUED)
23.
CONTINUED:
Jeff's face reveals his realization of what's happened. He
walks off, leaving Elaine watching Oscar.
Norman's car is almost at the corner still being forced
backwards by the flower van. We see that Derek is still lost in
his own thoughts.
Uncle Russell is poking at Norman with his cane.
UNCLE RUSSELL
You're going the wrong way!
NORMAN
Ow! That hurts.
DEREK
Stop the car, Norman.
NORMAN
What?
DEREK
Stop the car. I have to speak with
her. I have to speak with Elaine.
Norman reluctantly stops the car. Derek gets out.
NORMAN
What about Uncle Russell? I need help
with Uncle Russell!
It's too late. Derek is gone. The van in front of Norman honks
the horn.
UNCLE RUSSELL
What's going on here? Where are we?!
We're going to be late!
Russell hits him on the arm with his cane.
NORMAN
Ow! Can you please stop doing that?!
The van keeps beeping. Norman backs up.
Norman parks the car and gets out. He goes to the trunk and
removes the wheelchair.
UNCLE RUSSELL
What are you doing?! Be careful with
that.
Uncle Russell bangs his cane on the floor impatiently.
UNCLE RUSSELL (CONT'D)
Hurry up, we're late.
Norman slams the trunk closed.
WIDE SHOT: Norman struggles to push Uncle Russell up a hill.

CONTINUED:
UNCLE RUSSELL
Come on, put your back into it.
You're supposed to be a young man.
Don't you have any strength?
Elaine and Jeff are talking to some mourners.
ELAINE
It's so nice to see you.
WOMAN
I'm so sorry to hear about your uncle.
But he's in a better place now. I
hear Ryan is doing the eulogy.
Oscar, carrying a leaf, interrupts the conversation.
OSCAR
Look... Isn't it beautiful?
He wanders off again. Elaine doesn't know what the hell is
going on.
JEFF
Elaine, can I speak to you for a
minute?
ELAINE
(to the mourner)
I'll see you inside.
Jeff takes Elaine's arm with some urgency and moves off to the
side.
(CONTINUED)
32
CONTINUED:
ELAINE (CONT'D)
What? What is it?!
JEFF
I have to tell you something and, I'm
warning you in advance, you're not
going to like it.
Elaine looks at Jeff concerned.
Elaine is looking at Jeff in absolute shock.
ELAINE
What do you mean it's not Valium?
(CONTINUED)
34.
CONTINUED:
JEFF
I mean what you thought was Valium,
wasn't actually Valium. It's a
hallucinogenic. Like, acid,
mescaline... Special K...
Oscar moves in the background behind Elaine and Jeff. Elaine
looks at him. He's making strange contorted expressions with
his face and pointing at the sky. Other people are starting to
notice him and think he's slightly odd.
ELAINE
This isn't funny, Jeff.
JEFF
I'm not being funny. Look at him,
he's high as a kite!
Oscar sticks his head into a huge bush.
ELAINE
What the hell are you doing leaving
that stuff around your house?!
JEFF
A friend left it. And who the hell
just goes into someone's house and
takes pills?
ELAINE
I thought they were Valium!
(takes a deep breath)
What am I supposed to do? Should I
tell him?
JEFF
No, don't do that. It'll just freak
him out... We'll just keep a close
eye on him, and make sure he doesn't
get out of control... And don't let
him spend too long talking to one
person... or bush.
Oscar wanders into the front door. Elaine quickly follows him.
Jeff reluctantly follows Elaine. Derek arrives in time to see
this and follows as well.
We see Oscar emerging from the front doorway followed by Jeff.
Then comes Elaine.
Jeff approaches Oscar and stands with him as Elaine watches from
the doorway. Derek walks up.
DEREK
You look nice, Elaine.
ELAINE
I'm dressed for a funeral.
DEREK
Yeah, but you make death look sexy.
She looks at him.
DEREK (CONT'D)
So, I heard about the engagement.
ELAINE
Hey, hey. I don't really have time to
deal with whatever happened between
you and me. But I have not told my
dad yet, so I would appreciate it if
you would keep your mouth shut.
DEREK
Sure. Anything for you.
Derek looks over and notices Oscar looking bewildered.
DEREK (CONT'D)
So that's him? That's the man you're
going to spend the rest of your life
with?
Elaine looks over at the drugged up Oscar. Oscar leans over
like he's on a nod. Jeff leans down with him, watching. Right
before Oscar falls over, he comes up really fast.- Then he
starts walking.
ELAINE
Yep, that's him.
Oscar who has been walking in circles with a look of awe on his
face, changes direction and flies by Elaine and Derek back into
the house with Jeff in tow.
(CONTINUED)
38.
CONTINUED:
DEREK
Elaine., I-
Elaine follows the guys, leaving Derek behind.
Norman pushes Russell up the stairs close to where Derek is
standing. He looks like he's about to collapse from exhaustion.
Norman lets go of the wheelchair and catches his breath. Derek
grabs the chair blocking Norman from view just as Aaron arrives.
AARON
Thank you, Derek, you're a life saver.
Hope it wasn't too much trouble.
DEREK
No problem at all.
Aaron wheels Uncle Russell inside.
AARON
How are you doing, Uncle Russell?
(CONTINUED)
39.
CONTINUED:
UNCLE RUSSELL
Terrible.
Derek follows, leaving Norman standing there out of breath.
NORMAN
Can I get a little help?
Elaine drags Oscar out the back. Jeff follows.
Aaron storms out to Elaine who is trying to comfort Oscar. He's
looking very disturbed. Jeff is also there, looking guilty.
AARON
Elaine, what the hell was that?!
ELAINE
I'm so sorry, Aaron.
AARON
Oh, okay. My dead father's sprawled
out on the living room floor, but it's
okay, you're sorry.
OSCAR
But the coffin was moving.
ELAINE
Please, Aaron. Go back inside. I'll
explain later.
An annoyed and confused Aaron turns and walks back to the house.
He's almost to the door when Michelle arrives.
MICHELLE
AARON--
AARON
No, I haven't made the call about the
down payment yet.
MICHELLE
I wasn't going to say that.
AARON
No I'm not going to have sex with you.
MICHELLE
I wasn't going to say that.
AARON
What were you going to say?
(CONTINUED)
47.
CONTINUED:
MICHELLE
(WEAKLY)
Hi.
He goes inside leaving Michelle standing there. Duncan comes
out and heads for Oscar.
DUNCAN
I'll kill him!
Elaine tries to keep Duncan away from Oscar, who is stressed
enough and looks terrified.
ELAINE
Dad, leave it alone!
DUNCAN
Leave it alone?! He just knocked my
brother-in-law out of his coffin.
ELAINE
It wasn't his fault.
DUNCAN
Yes it was. My sister is in tears. I
can't believe you brought this idiot!
I don't ever want to see him again, do
you understand me?
ELAINE
I can't do that.
DUNCAN
Why not?
ELAINE
Because we're... moving in together.
Duncan looks over at Oscar, who looks like he's just seen a
ghost. He's struggling to stand up straight, with Jeff who's
doing his best to look after him.
DUNCAN
Are you crazy?
ELAINE
Dad, this isn't actually what he's
like. He took some drugs and--
DUNCAN
Drugs?! Is he on the pipe?
(CONTINUED)
48.
CONTINUED: (2)
Jeff looks over, his eyes pleading with Elaine not to tell on
him.
ELAINE
No he's not on the pipe. He took some
Valium and had a.bad reaction.
Jeff looks grateful.
DUNCAN
Valium?! That's not a Valium high.
Your mother was on Valium for forty
years. She never knocked over a
coffin.
ELAINE
Dad, please.
DUNCAN
I just want to point out that you
won't see Derek knocking over a
coffin.
ELAINE
Not right now, Dad.
DUNCAN
Fine. I've got to check on Cynthia,
but this isn't over.
Duncan walks back to the house. Elaine walks over to Oscar who
is hugging a tree.
ELAINE
Oscar.
OSCAR
Elaine.
ELAINE
Come and sit down.
Oscar, Elaine and Jeff are standing together.
OSCAR
I swear it was moving. I must be
losing my mind...
(looks at his hands)
Why are my hands so big?!
ELAINE
Oscar, listen to me. I need to tell
you something...
Elaine sits him down on the bench.
(CONTINUED)
50.
CONTINUED:
OSCAR
What is it?
ELAINE
Now... You remember I gave you some
Valium earlier?
OSCAR
Yes.
ELAINE
Well it turns out that it wasn't
actually Valium.
Oscar just looks at Elaine. Jeff slinks off into the
background.
ELAINE (CONT'D)
Can you hear me?
OSCAR
(YELLS)
Hello?
Elaine is trying to explain to Oscar.
ELAINE
Do you understand? Hallucinogenic.
Oscar recoils. He turns to Jeff.
JEFF
Yeah, now, the best thing to do is
relax and just go with the flow. Try
and enjoy it.
(CONTINUED)
52.
CONTINUED:
Oscar stands up, panicked and grabs Jeff by the lapels. We see
the bottle of "Valium" falls out of his pocket.
OSCAR
You!
ELAINE
Oscar!
She tries to pull him off Jeff.
OSCAR
How long does it last?
JEFF
I don't know... eight hours?
OSCAR
Eight hours?! Of this?!!
ELAINE
Oscar let go.
She pulls him off Jeff.
ANGLE ON: Derek watching from the window.
OSCAR
I'm going to be sick.
ANGLE ON: Derek smoothing his hair seeing his opportunity.
ANGLE ON: Oscar runs inside. Elaine follows with Jeff in tow.
ELAINE
Oscar! Come back.
They head into the house.
Cynthia is sitting quietly with Duncan.
DUNCAN
I'm sure we'll start soon.
He looks toward the house and sees Norman exit. Duncan wants to
avoid him.
DUNCAN (CONT'D)
(TO CYNTHIA)
Let's go inside.
CYNTHIA
In a moment.
Duncan gets up and heads toward the house. He passes Norman.
NORMAN
Doctor, I just have a--
Duncan doesn't stop, leaving Norman holding his wrist. Norman
looks over and sees Cynthia. He sits next to her.
NORMAN (CONT'D)
I'm sorry... you know... about... you
know...
CYNTHIA
Thank you. I'll be alright. I know
he's watching over me.
NORMAN
You think so?' I mean, there are a lot
of fine ones up in heaven. Anna
Nicole Smith's dead too, you know.
might be watching over her.
Norman sits next to Cynthia.
NORMAN (CONT'D)
Death is a terrible thing... Did you
check to make sure he.was wearing
shoes? I hear they steal the shoes.
And I hope you took off his ring,
'cause if it's worth anything, someone
is going to take that, too.
Cynthia stares at Norman.
(CONTINUED)
68.
CONTINUED:
NORMAN (CONT'D)
Before he died, did he have a rash?
She gets up and exits. Norman notices Jeff's pill bottle on the
ground. He picks it up and puts it in his pocket.
Jeff frantically searches the bushes where Oscar pushed him,
looking for the pill bottle. He finds nothing.
From a rooftop POV we see the window slide open and Oscar,
dripping with sweat and not wearing a shirt, lean out. He takes
a deep breath of fresh air and listens to the birds.
He climbs out the window revealing he's completely naked. He
stands on-the roof and lifts his hands to the sky.
Oscar stands on the roof, naked, breathing in the fresh air.
Cynthia is knocking on the door.
CYNTHIA
Aaron?
Oscar is leaning over the ledge playing with his spit and
laughing uncontrollably.
Oscar is squatting down rolling his head around when he hears
Elaine's voice.
ELAINE (O.S.)
Derek, get over yourself.
Oscar turns to look at the window and sees Derek and Elaine
kissing.
Oscar moves away from the window and further out on the ledge.
Elaine opens the window and sticks her head out.
ELAINE
Oscar! What are you doing? Get back
here and put your clothes on right
now!
OSCAR
I saw you kissing him.
ELAINE
I wasn't kissing him. I swear.
Please, baby, put your clothes on.
We're at a funeral!
Derek sticks his head out the window behind Elaine.
OSCAR
You cheater! You cheater! You're
committing adultery!!!
ELAINE
Calm down.
OSCAR
I'm going to jump right now.
ELAINE
Remember you've got drugs in you.
This isn't really happening. Oscar,
look at me.
She turns to Derek.
ELAINE (CONT'D)
(TO DEREK)
Get out of here!
She pushes him back inside.
As mourners mill about the lawn we hear:
OSCAR (O.S.)
I'm going to jump. I'm jumping.
You're a cheater!
(CONTINUED)
100.
CONTINUED:
People gather. around and look up. We only see Oscar from the
waist up.
ANGLE ON: Oscar.
OSCAR (CONT'D)
I'm going to jump. She's cheating on
me!
ELAINE (O.S.)
Oscar, please. Come back here.
Jeff runs through the kitchen door and joins the mourners
looking at Oscar on the roof.
ELAINE
Get back here. Be careful!
OSCAR
I believe I can fly! I believe I can
touch the sky!
ANGLE ON: Aaron who steps out and sees everybody watching Oscar.
Elaine is still leaning out the window.
ELAINE
Oscar, come inside. We'll have some
coffee.
OSCAR
(PETULANTLY)
No!
He climbs up on the roof.
ELAINE
Oscar!
She climbs out the window.
103.
The mourners see that Oscar is naked. He stumbles. Everybody
GASPS!
Aaron notices that everybody is captivated by the drama.
Elaine follows Oscar on the roof.
Duncan sees Elaine on the roof.
DUNCAN
Elaine, what are you doing?!
Elaine sees Oscar climbing further up the roof.
DUNCAN (CONT'D)
Elaine!
Elaine follows Oscar.
Aaron realizes this is his chance. He heads back inside.
Michelle catches him at the door.
MICHELLE
What are you doing?
AARON
I think I can get rid of this guy, but
I need you to stay out here and try to
stop anyone from coming in.
MICHELLE
Okay. I'll do what I can.
She heads back to the crowd on the lawn. As Aaron goes through
the doorway of the kitchen, Derek passes him on the way out to
the lawn to see what's happening.
DUNCAN (O.S.)
Elaine!
Elaine is stepping off the fire escape ladder and onto the roof
peak. Oscar sits sadly on the roof peak with his back to the
crowd.
ELAINE
Oscar... Please don't do this...
love you.
OSCAR
Then why were you with him?
ELAINE
I wasn't with him.
OSCAR
Yes, you were! I saw you!
Derek is laughing next to Jeff. We see the view from their POV.
Elaine finally gets closer to Oscar.
OSCAR
I'll never be good enough. Not for
your dad, and not for you.
ELAINE
Oscar, please just come inside.
OSCAR
No. You go inside.
ELAINE
Come with me.
OSCAR
Why?
ELAINE
Because you're going to be a father.
Oscar looks at her, shocked.
OSCAR
What?

ELAINE
I'm pregnant. We're going to have a
child...
ANGLE ON: Oscar and Elaine.
OSCAR
You're pregnant?
Oscar is overcome with emotion. Elaine holds out her hand.
ELAINE
I won't be able to do it without you.
Very slowly, a naked Oscar, walks toward her and they embrace.
The crowd applauds.
ANGLE ON: Michelle.
MICHELLE
What about me?! I want a baby. Would
somebody get me pregnant?!
Everybody looks at Michelle. She smiles weakly.
Seeing Oscar is safe, Jeff is very relieved.
Oscar turns toward the crowd.
(CONTINUED)
109.
CONTINUED:
OSCAR
(ANNOUNCING WILDLY)
We're having a baby.
General approval noises and applause come from the crowd.
Duncan looks appalled.
DUNCAN
Great.
Duncan heads toward the kitchen door. He passes a shocked
looking Derek.
Michelle follows and speaks loudly as Duncan is about to enter
the kitchen.
MICHELLE
Aaron?! Oscar's off the roof!
Cynthia walks up to Aaron.
CYNTHIA
Baby, I really think we should start
again now. Have you seen Uncle
Russell?
Aaron remembers where he is and looks at Ryan. They rush off to
the study, passing Jeff. Jeff checks his pockets and realizes
the pills are gone again. He goes off to find them.
The house has emptied out. All the cars are gone.
