                    taught me how to write my name on it!

                                  GEORGE
                    You liked that.

                                  EMILY
                    Yeah. It was really neat!

                                  GEORGE
                    Is this your homework?

                                  EMILY
                    Uh huh. Just math. It's easy.

                                  SUSAN
                    Will you help her with it while I get 
                    dinner?

                                  EMILY
                    I don't need any help, momma.

      George looks at Susan. Allows himself a little, proud 
      smile. Susan rises, straightens the counter tops. Buck 
      enters.

                                  GEORGE
                    How was it at your school, Buck?

                                  BUCK
                    {Finiksa, huh dad?}

                                  GEORGE
                    I want you to use your English name now.

                                  BUCK
                    {why? It sucks.}                                  GEORGE
                    Please use it. How was your school?

                                  BUCK
                    It was okay.
                          (he exits)

                                  SUSAN
                    You didn't eat much lunch, Em.

                                  EMILY
                    Wasn't too hungry.

                                  SUSAN
                    Did anybody eat with you?

                                  EMILY
                            (intent on her homework)
                    Huh? No.

      Susan's jaw sets. George pats Emily's arm, goes to Susan.

                                  GEORGE
                      ...What...?

                                  SUSAN
                            (quiet, intense)
                    What do you think! How do you think I feel 
                    knowing that she's sitting there at lunch 
                    all by herself.

                                  GEORGE
                    I'm sure that happens to a lot of kids on 
                    their first day.

      She turns. Stares at him a moment. Then turns sharply away.

                                  SUSAN
                    Right, George.

      He watches her a moment. Eases off the subject.

                                  GEORGE
                    Matt was rather amazing, wasn't he?                                  SUSAN
                            (softening slightly)
                    Yes, he was. I called to thank him. Left a 
                    message on his machine. Invited him over.

                                  GEORGE
                    He only said about ten words to me the rest 
                    of the day.

                                  SUSAN
                    ...That's more than Emmy got.

      She moves off. George stands, silently.


      which works sometimes, opens, Sikes gets out, noticing two 
      moving men struggling to get a bureau into an apartment.

                                  A WOMAN'S VOICE
                    Yeah, that's it. Little bit left.

      He pauses to check out his new neighbor. And as the movers 
      go in through the door they reveal CATHY - an attractive 
      female NEWCOMER. She finds herself looking right at Sikes. 
      Smiles.

                                  CATHY
                    Hi.

      Sikes nods. She disappears into her flat. Sikes turns to 
      unlock his door. Majorly disgruntled.

                                  SIKES
                      Wonderful. ...Why My building?

      He is unlocking his door when Cathy reappears, carrying a 
      cardboard file box.

                                  CATHY
                    Excuse me... Matthew Sikes?                                  SIKES
                    Yeah.

                                  CATHY
                    A woman dropped this off, asked me to give 
                    it to you.

                                  SIKES
                    Thanks.

      He goes inside, closes the door. Cathy stares at it, 
      wryly...

                                  CATHY
                    Nice meeting you, too.


      Cluttered, eclectic. A large N gauge train set occupies one 
      corner. He looks curiously at the file box, starts to open 
      it as the phone RINGS. He grabs it.

      He hangs up slowly. Looks at the phone. Then at the file 
      box. He opens the box. There are a list of papers.

                            (off his grunt)
                    That was the morgue. The body of that 
                    vagrant we brought in...?

                    It disappeared last night.

      Sikes looks up, shocked. George and Sikes leave their desks 
      and head toward the morgue.


                                  GEORGE
                    I want to thank you again for how you 
                    helped Emily.

                                  GEORGE
                    It seemed like more than that, it seemed 
                    like someone who really identified with 
                    her, somebody who knew what it was like to 
                    be an underdog.

      Sikes ignores him, pressing the elevator buttons.

                    I knew a man once who was discriminated 
                    against, when he was young, because he was 
                    small for his age. Made him different from 
                    the others. They always picked on him, 
                    chose him last for teams.

      Sikes gives George a LOOK.

      She frowns, stares at him as he looks very carefully at a 
      table top, then sets down his armload of stuff. She catches 
      a glimpse of his shoulder holster and pistol. Gets a trifle 
      uneasy...

      the specific inch that a drawer is open.                                  CATHY

                    Then why stroke 'em?

                                  GEORGE
                    To be more accepted. We're different, Buck. 
                    It's written all over us. There's a natural 
                      resentment against us. So we have to be 
                    better, more patient - just to be accepted 
                    as even equal. We have to adapt.

                                  BUCK
                    It's a lotta crap. We should be able to be 
                    what we are, man. Without the brown-nosing.

                                  GEORGE
                    It takes time, Buck. But look at the 
                    progress already. We're in a better 
                      neighborhood-

                                  BUCK
                    Where half the people won't talk to us.

                                  GEORGE
                    Change happens slowly. But some Newcomers 
                    are already crossing - over. Because of 
                    their skill or intelligence. Look at Dr. 
                    Fallon at Cal Tech, or Chuck Winslow who 
                    just signed with the Dodgers.

                                  BUCK
                    Just P.R., man.                                  GEORGE
                    No, it's because he's a great hitter. And 
                    how 'bout Martine Bennett on the L.A. city 
                    council?

                                  BUCK
                    Right. But does she get a vote?

                                  GEORGE
                    If Proposition 16 passes she will - we all 
                    will.

                                  BUCK
                    Good luck. you seen the opinion polls?

                                  GEORGE
                    Yes. There's almost a fifty-fifty chance. A 
                    lot of humans want us to vote.

                                  BUCK
                    And a lot of them don't.

                                  GEORGE
                    It could go either way, you're right - but 
                    that means that almost half of the people 
                    are on our side.

                                  BUCK
                    Well I haven't met any of 'em.

                                  GEORGE
                    Maybe you're not looking in the right 
                    places. ...C'mon and have dinner with us, 
                    will you?

                                  BUCK
                    I'm really not hungry.

      He thrums sullenly on his instrument. George sighs.


      Two NEWCOMERS dressed in surgical gowns and masks lean over 
      the body, carefully inspecting the sores, testing samples.

      The atmosphere is very tense.                                  THE NEWCOMER SURGEON
                    {It's much worse than I thought.}

                                  THE OTHER NEWCOMER
                    {What do we do?}

                                  THE NEWCOMER SURGEON
                    {I don't know. ...Pray?}

      He wipes his brow. Looks at the other surgeon. Then BLACK.


 


                                       ACT THREE


      George lies on his stomach on their bed, only a sheet 
      covering the lower part of his body. Susan is in the 
      bathroom.

                                  SUSAN (O.S.)
                    Mostly it's because he's a teen-ager.

                                  GEORGE
                    ...Maybe.

                                  SUSAN (O.S.)
                    Why don't we just tell him it's not working 
                    out, and to please come back when he's 
                    grown.

                                  GEORGE
                          (a smirk)
                    Now that's an idea.

                                  SUSAN (O.S.)
                          (a pause)
                    Why do you think that factory smelled like 
                    our spacecraft?

                                  GEORGE
                    I don't know.

                                  SUSAN (O.S.)
                    Was Matt impressed that you could smell 
                    something he couldn't?

                                  GEORGE
                    More annoyed, I think. He spends a lot of 
                    time annoyed.

                                  SUSAN (O.S.)
                    Diane - the woman who brought us that plant 
                    I'm trying not to kill - I saw her in the 
                    market and she was amazed that I could 
                    smell and see the pesticides on the 
                    produce. Made me promise to pick out all 
                    her fruit from now on.

      She comes out wearing a thin nightie. The light from the       bathroom behind her outlines her body underneath. Alien or 
      not, she looks like someone you'd went to have pick out 
      your fruit.

                                  SUSAN
                    The produce manager was pretty annoyed with 
                    Me. Heard him whisper I had a head like an 
                    over-ripe crenshaw melon. I don't think 
                    they realize how acute our senses are.

                                  GEORGE
                    No, they don't. Thanks for having Matt 
                    over.

                                  SUSAN
                            (settling beside him)
                    No problem.

                                  GEORGE
                    You made him very comfortable.

                                  SUSAN
                            (stroking his back)
                    Would you like me to make you comfortable?

                                  GEORGE
                    Wellll...

                                  SUSAN
                            (mimicking)
                    Wellll... I saw you lying here with your 
                    back exposed... waiting for a little 
                    hummer...

      She leans down, touches her lips just below his shoulder 
      blade, and HUMS a long note. George's body relaxes with a 
      wave of warm sexuality. Susan moves her lips slightly and 
      HUMS a slightly lower, longer note. George closes his eyes 
      and breathes deeply.

      He reaches around and MASSAGES a spot on the back of her 
      knee - and Susan draws a breath of pure sexual pleasure.

                                  SUSAN
                    Oooo... yes...

      She HUMS on his back again, getting into it. Until he       chuckles...

                                  SUSAN
                    ...I beg your pardon...?

                                  GEORGE
                    I'm sorry I was just thinking...you know in 
                    their movies, particularly that X-Rated 
                    video we rented, how humorous we find some 
                    of their foreplay rituals...

                                  SUSAN
                    Mmmm hmmm...

      She HUMS on his back again, clearly getting a rise out of 
      him. Her body moves sensually...

                                  SUSAN
                      Well,...you know what they say...
                            (humming on him again)

                                  GEORGE
                          (a breathless whisper)
                    ...What do they... say...?

                                  SUSAN
                      {Different strokes for different folks.}

                                  GEORGE
                            (embracing her)
                    { ...Is that what they say...}

                                  SUSAN
                      Mmmmmmmm....

      He increases the stimulation behind her knee, her body 
      arches with ecstatic pleasure...


      scrunches her face, frustrated with a math problem. Looks 
      at Emily who is breezing along. Jill whispers tentatively.

                                  JILL
                    ...I don't get it.

                            (looks up, smiles)

                                  JILL
                    Here, see...

                                  EMILY
                    Well, y'multiply those two.

                                  JILL
                    Okay, twenty one, but where-

                                  EMILY
                    Carry the two up to there. And just hold 
                    it. Now multiply these - six - and add-

                                  JILL
                    The two. Eight!

                                  EMILY
                    Yeah.

                                  JILL
                    Thanks. Wow, you're in the blue book 
                    already?

      Emily nods. Mark wheels past.

                                  MARK
                    Talk to spongeheads and your hair'll fall 
                    out.

                                  JILL
                    Shut up, Mark. He's a jerk. Hey, thanks for 
                    the help.                                  EMILY
                    Sure.

      Jill returns to her desk, glances back to see Emily 
      touching the back of her smooth head. Then Emily feels 
      Jill's eyes, they share a glance. Then Emily goes back to 
      work. But Jill keeps looking at her. Pondering something.

                                  DR. HURWITZ
                    Well... We have no evidence that such a 
                    virus exists.

                                    GERALDO
                    But it could exist?                                  DR. HURWITZ
                    Well, there were those of us who argued 
                    that the quarantine period may not have 
                    been sufficiently long enough to thoroughly 
                    isolate extraterrestrial bacteria, but-

                                    GERALDO
                    So such a virus could exist.

                                  THE PURIST LEADER
                    And that's exactly why we never should have 
                    let the damned aliens outs - And now this 
                    elitist conspiracy to give them the vote.

                                  THE DISTINGUISHED NEWCOMER
                    Can we please stick to the subject we 
                    agreed on -

                                  THE PURIST LEADER
                            (flaring)
                    Don't you tell me what to stick to, you 
                    filthy slag!

                                  THE NEWCOMER
                            (rising to leave)
                    Excuse me...

                                  THE PURIST LEADER
                            (jumping up)
                    Just sit the hell back down there, boy - we 
                    want some straight answers and we want-

      The Newcomer struggles to rise. The Purist Leader grapples 
      with him. Geraldo intervenes. The audience REACTS wildly!

                                  BLENTU
                    {Shut up, jerk.}

      He flips the channel. A BASKETBALL GAME comes on. The 
      camera follows two NEWCOMER PLAYERS. They are DAZZLING.

                                  ANNOUNCER
                    And once again the two newest additions to 
                    the Bruins proved that their skills could 
                    leave their opponents in the dust. Chip 
                    Weston and Nicholas Nickleby led their team 
                                  (MORE)                                  ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                    to a staggering 113 to 75 upset over 
                    Loyola. Prompting Coach Jim Harrick to quip 
                    that other teams oughta be allowed to play 
                    with seven men against UCLA.

      The crowd, which includes several Newcomers is cheering 
      wildly, carrying the Newcomer heroes on their shoulders. 
      Even Buck and some of the toughs are pleased, "Alright! 
      Show the terts! Way to go!" etc. Until Svabo and Blentu 
      SMIRK.

                                  BLENTU
                    {Stupid sellouts.}

                                  SVABO
                    (Yeah.}

      Buck tries to adopt their attitude. Nods. Wants to fit in.

                                  BUCK
                      {...Yeah.}


      are alone in the room. The others are playing outside.

                                  JILL
                    I got it out of the stuff we use for the 
                    drama club. I thought it might make you 
                    feel... well...

      She pulls a wig out of her desk. It's brown and a little It 
      tattered. Emily looks at it.

                                  EMILY
                    I'm not sure.                                  JILL
                    Oh, go on and try it.

                                  EMILY
                    How do you put it -

                                  JILL
                    Here, like this. That's it. No, more around 
                    this way...

                                  EMILY
                    Oww, wait...that hurts. Here...

      She bends her head down and fidgets with it a moment, then 
      rises up. The wig is askew and doesn't really fit her head.

                                  EMILY
                    What do you think?

                                  JILL
                    Well...
                            (starting to giggle)

                                  MARS (O.S.)
                    I think it's hysterical

      Emily looks toward the door where a bunch of the kids have 
      started coming in. They all shriek with LAUGHTER as they 
      see her. Emily is mortified. She looks at Jill, who can't 
      suppress her own GIGGLE.

      Emily's eyes well with angry tears. She pulls the wig off 
      and throws it in Jill's face - then runs out the back door.


      Susan has sculpted the face of the pissy Homeowner woman 
      she encountered earlier. It's an excellent likeness. Susan 
      looks at it a moment, then PUNCHES her fist hard into it. 
      Now she feels better.

      George has entered through the back door. Susan is still 
      looking at the bust, she doesn't see that George is darkly 
        preoccupied.

                                  SUSAN
                    Hi, honey... Listen, we've gotta talk. Emmy 
                    had a real rough day and Buck's school 
                    called. ...He's never been there.

      George stops. Looks at her. Flares, heads out of the 
      kitchen.

                                  SUSAN
                    George. Wait. I want us to do it together. 
                    George!


      is thrumming on his instrument, making an interesting 
      rhythm, when George steamrolls in fiercely and grabs him - 
      scaring the living shit out of him.

                                  BUCK
                    What!! What, dad!! wait!!

      George SLAMS him up against the walls Bellows at him -                                  GEORGE
                    - Listen you little ingrate slag, I've 
                    worked my ass off so you can have a better 
                    life and won't have to live like a damn 
                    slave - and I'll be damned if I'm gonna let 
                    you piss away your Chances! I catch you 
                    ditching any more school - or catch you 
                    running with those smartass hoods, I'll 
                    have your head in a buckets - Got that?! 
                    You GOT THAT!?

                                  BUCK
                            (mumbling angrily)
                      ...Yeah... yeah...

      George slings him to the floor and stands glowering. Buck 
      starts to say something. Stops.

                                  GEORGE
                            (snapping)
                    What.

                                  BUCK
                    You don't want to hear it.

                                  GEORGE
                    You got something to say, say it.

                                  BUCK
                    I think you're just roasting me cause of 
                    the crap you eat at your job.

                                  GEORGE
                            (bristling)
                    I'm roasting you cause you're turning into 
                    a little screw-up slag who's ditching 
                    school-

                                  BUCK
                    - And because crap rolls downhill.

      George is furious. He raises his hand to hit Buck.

                                  BUCK
                    Go on - but just remember, man, I didn't 
                    like amp you to move here! 
                                  (MORE)                                  BUCK (CONT'D)
                    I didn't ask ya t'sell your soul t'the 
                    terts.

      They stare at each other angrily. Finally George just 
      chuckles bitterly. Shakes his head. ...And leaves.


      is RINGING. A hand picks it up. It is Burns.

      The phone goes dead. Burns stares at it. Hangs up. Runs 
      off.

      has a cup of tea and Tuggs' files spread before him. He's 
      squinting at a particular file with the handwritten title, 
      "Newcomers - Slaves from Deep Space." He mumbles Tuggs' 
      words.

                    "And from two of them I have heard a word

      Sikes looks up with a thoughtful frown.

      Sikes looks at Burns, who nods to emphasize his point.


      the woman who had brought Susan the flowers at the 
      beginning is watching her TV with some concern. Burns'

      Diane has moved to the back door, opening it to find

      Diane tries to cover her uneasiness with a smile. And 
      can't. Susan senses it immediately. Holds up some flowers.

                                  SUSAN
                    I was really pleased. I've usually got sort 
                    of a black thumb, every time I look at a

                    Oh. Well, sure. Thanks again.

                                  DIANE
                    Yeah.

      She closes the door. Stands inside looking at the flowers 
      like they might be diseased. Susan stands outside. A beat.

      Buck and his gang are bringing in more stolen furniture.                                  SVABO
                    {Yeah, this's great man! Just like home!}

                                  BUCK
                    {Damn straight.}

      Suddenly part of a wall crashes down, revealing EIGHT BLACK 
      YOUTHS. Tough-looking and dangerous.

                                  THE BLACK LEADER
                    You picked the wrong place to hunker, 
                    slags!

      And they erupt at Buck's gang, one has a C02 extinguisher! 
      It's spray incapacitates one of the Newcomers.

                                  THE BLACK LEADER
                    How 'bout a little salt water, dude!?

      He squirts it right in Svabo's face! Svabo yelps as the 
      water burns and smokes on his skin like acid!

      Buck dives onto the black leader. The fighting is furious - 
      hand to hand - and the blacks quickly realize they may have 
      underestimated the Newcomers' prodigious strength.

      Svabo throws one through a window.

      Blentu fights his way through the C02, grabs his opponent 
      throat. Slugs him mercilessly.

      Another black kid dives on Buck, knocking him down into the 
      area where The Vagrant had been in scene one. Buck gets 
      some of the SLIME on his jacket.

      The blacks pound him, but Buck's fury is no match for them. 
      He hurls the one away, bouncing him off a wall. During the 
      struggle, a real PISTOL falls from one kid's pocket. Buck 
      looks up to see the leader pull out a pistol of his own - 
      and FIRE a SHOT at Buck.

      Buck scrambles across the floor, scoops up the fallen 
      pistol as another BULLET RICOCHETS near him. He rolls over 
      and FIRES - hitting the leader in the stomachs The youth 
      drops, gasping.      Buck stares - amazed and frightened. The others have 
      reacted to the shot - startled! The blacks break off the 
      fight, panicky, two rush to their leader, SHOUTING EPITHETS 
      at the Newcomers. There are distant SIRENS approaching.

                                  SVABO
                    Out! Get him out or we'll kill you all!

      The blacks retreat, carrying their badly wounded comrade. 
      The Newcomer gang is jubilant around Buck.

                                  BLENTU
                    (Great shot, Finiksa!}

                                  SVABO
                    {Yeah! You see that sucker fold up! Boom?!}

                                  BLENTU
                    {I think you killed him, man! That'll teach 
                    'em!}

      The SIRENS are closer.

                                  SVABO
                    {C'mon, let's dust it.}

      They start to run off, look back at Buck who's frozen in 
      place, pulse racing, breathing hard, staring.

                                  BLENTU
                    {Finiksa! C'mon, man!}

      Buck comes into the moment. Pockets the gun. Runs with 
      them.


      moves to Cathy's door. Knocks gently. She opens it. Is 
      surprised to see the Newcomer surgeon, RAMNA. Her first 
      instinct is to close the door in his face.

                                  RAMNA
                    Jelana, please, I assure you it's a matter 
                    of great importance or I never would've 
                    come. Please put the past behind us.

      A beat. Cathy is very reluctant.                                  RAMNA
                    It's truly a matter of life and death... 
                    most probably death.

      She stares - just as Sikes comes out of his door - dressed 
      in the old ratty clothes. By explanation he winks, says:

                                  SIKES
                    Late date.

      Cathy forces a little smile, preoccupied with Ramna, whom 
      she admits and closes the door.


                                  GEORGE
                    Maybe the girl... Jill... was trying to 
                    help you before, Em. When she gave you the 
                    wig.

                                  EMILY
                    But then she laughed with the rest of them, 
                    daddy.

                                  GEORGE
                    And that hurts, I know. I feel badly at 
                    work sometimes... get angrier than I 
                    should... It's... going to take a little 
                    time, Em... But it'll -

      Susan gets up abruptly. Walks out. George keeps focused.

                                  GEORGE
                    - It'll change. You'll see. ...You have 
                    much homework?

                                  EMILY
                    A little. About Indians.

                                  GEORGE
                    Oh - I'd like to hear about that. I'll be 
                    right back, okay?


      is loading the washer. Tight-lipped. The back door opens 
      and Buck enters. Wired. Overly cheerful. Even Kisses her.                                  BUCK
                    Hey, mom. How's it going

                                  SUSAN
                    ...About like usual. Give me that jacket, 
                    you've got something all over it.

      He strips it off. A bit of the SLIME brushes onto Susan's 
      arm, but she ignores it as George enters.

                                  GEORGE
                    Sus...

                                  BUCK
                    Hey, pops. Be down in a minute.

      He exits. George glances after him, curious about Buck's 
      upbeat attitude. Then looks at his wife.

                                  GEORGE
                    Sus, we've really both got to -

                                  SUSAN
                    It's hard for me sometimes at S.C., but at 
                    least I'm older.

                                  GEORGE
                    Does everyone treat you badly?

                                  SUSAN
                    Of course not. And the ones who do I can 
                    deal with. But Emmy's only nine, I can't 
                    stand it when people hurt her. I hate it, 
                    George. I hate it!

                                  GEORGE
                    So do I, Sus. But we -

      THEIR LIVING ROOM WINDOW

      is SHATTERED as a rock CRASHES through its - Emily screams:

                                  EMILY
                    Momma!! MOMMA!

      George and Susan rush in. Susan pulls Emily into a doorway.                                  SUSAN
                    Em! Emmy!? Are you okay!?

                                  BUCK
                            (running in)
                    What happened?!

      George has run to look out the window. He sees

      A PICK UP TRUCK IN THE STREET - INTERCUT

      peeling away with a few men, including a couple of blacks, 
      on the back. Shouting "Dirty slags!" - "Damn BUG people!" - 
      "Go back to Slagtown!" - "Get the hell out!" - "We're gonna 
      exterminate ya!" - George and Buck watch them speed away.

                                  SUSAN
                    Do you see! Do you SEE, dammit!

                                  GEORGE
                    Sus -

                                  SUSAN
                    NO! DON'T START! It's not worth it, George! 
                    Nothing's worth this! I don't want my 
                    children to go through this anymore, do you 
                    hear me!? I want to go back. I'd rather 
                    live in that Slagtown hovel for the rest of 
                    my life-

                                  GEORGE
                    And how about the rest of their lives? And 
                    their children's lives?

                                  SUSAN
                    It's not worth it, George. Not to me.
                            (exiting with Emily)
                    ...Not for my kids.

      George stares after her. Then looks back at Buck, who 
      stands in the middle of the shattered glass, feeling the 
      weight of the rock in his hand - and looking off into the 
      night.                                        ACT SIX


      is entering. Grazer looks up.

                                  GRAZER
                    Hey Sikes, have fun playin' homeless last 
                    night?

                                  SIKES
                    Almost as much fun as bein' a captain.

                                  GRAZER
                    Hey. I'm sorry they promoted me and not 
                    you, okay? You and George see any bugs last 
                    night?

                                  SIKES
                    No. And I was out on my own. He had a 
                    problem at home.

                                  GRAZER
                    Sounded like you two had a problem here 
                      yesterday. That what this is about?

                                  SIKES
                    No. ...I want an autopsy on Tuggs.

                                  GRAZER
                    What? He's dead and buried.

                                  SIKES
                    They never did an autopsy.

                                  GRAZER
                    C'mon, you saw him. So did I.

      He reaches into a box and extracts a thin cigar.

      SIKES - CLOSE - INTERCUT

      the CAMERA moves closer as he watches Grazer light the 
      cigar.                                  GRAZER
                    What's an autopsy gonna show?

                                  SIKES
                    ...Can I order one?

      Grazer eyes him, rolls the cigar between his fingers...

                                  GRAZER
                    ...Sure.


      enters stiffly, aware that she's the only Newcomer in the 
      room.

                                  SUSAN
                    I'd like to see the principal.

                                  THE RECEPTIONIST
                            (smiling)
                    You must be Emily's mother.

                                  SUSAN
                    How'd you guess.

                                  THE RECEPTIONIST
                    Oh, we all know which one She 
                    is. ...Y'know, I'd just like to tell you 
                    that my husband works with a couple of your 
                    kind down at that post office. And they're 
                    real polite. They're just fine.

                                  SUSAN
                    I'm so glad.

      The BLACK TEACHER moves through the b.g., overhearing.

                                  THE RECEPTIONIST
                    Can I tell Ms. Stevens what you want to see 
                    her about?

                                  SUSAN
                      Withdrawing my daughter.                                  THE RECEPTIONIST
                    Oh. I'm sorry t'hear that. Well, she's in a 
                    meeting right now. If you'd like to wait -

                                  SUSAN
                    Yes. Where's the women's room?


      is rinsing off her face, looking at her tired eyes. The 
      Black Teacher enters, washes her hands, CHUCKLES. Susan 
      looks at her.

                                  THE BLACK TEACHER
                    Just thinking about when there used t'be 
                    three kinds of restrooms.

                                  SUSAN
                    Three?

                                  THE BLACK TEACHER
                    Men, Women, ..and Colored.

                                  SUSAN
                      ...Really?

                                  THE BLACK TEACHER
                    I'm old enough to have aped 'em. ...Things 
                    change, though. They do change. If you want 
                    'em to badly enough. I remember this old 
                    black woman, Miss Jane Pittman. She used to 
                    pass this particular water fountain every 
                    day. The White Folks' water fountain. Then 
                    one day, y'know what she did? She went 
                    right up to it and took a drink.
                            (smiling)
                    Lord, but didn't all hell break loose. 
                    "Nigger drunk outta the white fountain! 
                    Nigger done this, nigger done that!" - One 
                    of 'em became the mayor of Los Angeles. One 
                    of 'em's the mayor of Atlanta. Atlanta! One 
                    of 'em ran for President. ...One of 'em 
                    will be President someday.
                            (she smiles, sighs)
                    Hard to take that first drink, though. 
                    Takes a lot of courage to be like old Miss 
                                  (MORE)                                  THE BLACK TEACHER (CONT'D)
                    Jane.

      A pause. Susan looks at her for a long moment, but finally 
      looks away.

                                  SUSAN
                    ...At least they weren't afraid she'd turn 
                    into an insect.

                                  THE BLACK TEACHER
                          (a chuckle)
                    Honey, I can show you people who still 
                    think black people have rabbit blood - and 
                    that Jews have horns.
                            (giving her a pat)
                    You don't look like a cockroach t'me.

      Their eyes meet again. The woman smiles and leaves. Susan 
      stands alone. And then she looks at herself in the mirror.


      lies in bed reading "David Copperfield." She hears a TAP at 
      her window. Frowns. Moves to it. Sees Jill outside. Opens 
      it.

                                  EMILY
                    What're you -

                                  JILL
                    My mom went out to one of her stupid Purist 
                    meetings. I want to say I'm sorry. ...
                                  (MORE)                                  JILL (CONT'D)
                    I really am.

                                  EMILY
                    You made me put that wig on just so they 
                    all could laugh at me. That wasn't very 
                    nice.

                                  JILL
                    No, really! I thought it might make you 
                    feel better. More like one of us, you know? 
                    It just didn't work.

                                  EMILY
                            (agreeing)
                    Yeah, it was a dumb idea. I can't be 
                    something I'm not.

                                  JILL
                    Well anyway, I just wanted you to know I 
                    felt bad.

                                  EMILY
                    Thanks.

                                  JILL
                    My mom doesn't want me to play with you.

                                  EMILY
                    Yeah, okay.

      She reaches to close the window. Jill stops her.

                                  JILL
                    But I want to. We could play at your house,

                    if you want.

      Emily smiles.


      enters, whistling, carrying a pizza and a six-pack. He taps 
      his phone machine. Pulls off his ratty clothes, his hand is 
      bandaged.

                    Daddee! Hi, it's your number one daughter. 
                    Listen, I've really been missing you. So 
                    let's have dinner Saturday, can we, huh? 
                    Can we? I'd like you to meet this really 
                    neat guy I've been spending some time with. 
                    His name's Mark Twain. Now don't freak out-
                    Sikes sourly shuts off the machine. Puffs

      The door opens slightly. It's unlocked. His antennae go up.      CATHY'S PLACE - SIKES

      peers in. It's uncharacteristically NEAT. Something's 
      wrong. He reaches for his gun, but has taken it off. Then A 
      MAN in a three piece, pin stripe suit comes out of the 
      bedroom.

                      ...Lieutenant... Lieutenant..?

      Sikes eyes open slightly, dazedly, as though drugged.

      SIKES' SUBJECTIVE POV - HAZY, DISORIENTED

      Agent Randall is leaning over. Someone else, a big NEWCOMER 
      hovers in the b.g., taking a hypodermic from Randall, whose 
      voice echo's throughout.

                                    RANDALL
                    That's it... here I am... can you hear 
                    me...?

                    ...Good. Very good... Now I want you to 
                    tell me something, Lieutenant... And you 
                    want to tell me, don't you...?
                            (off Sikes' bleary nod)
                    That's very good...Just tell me what you 
                    know about ...The Overseers...

      Sikes blinks heavily. Struggles to think. Finally shakes 
      his head slightly.

                                    RANDALL
                    Surely you must know something.

      Sikes shakes his head again. The Newcomer in the b.g. is 
      annoyed, angry. Randall eases him back.                                    RANDALL
                    If he knew anything, he'd talk. This is 
                    powerful stuff.
                          (to Sikes)
                    ...Are you sure, lieutenant?
                            (off Sikes reaction)
                    Alright then, just go back to sleep... 
                    that's right... and when you wake up you 
                    won't remember this little conversation, 
                    will you? ...You won't remember...

      Sikes' eyes drift closed again. He sleeps. Fitfully.


      the Latino whom Sikes & George busted earlier, is lying in 
      the shadows on his bunk, gasping. His breathing is pained, 
      he rolls over into a beam of light - which reveals the UGLY 
      SORES which have spread over his face and neck. He GROANS 
      in anguish. He's in big trouble.                                      ACT SEVEN

                    swung back the other way - showing about

                    sixteen year old black youth who was 
                    wounded in a gang-related shooting 
                      yesterday. His condition worsened during 
                    the night, and he has been placed on the 
                    critical list. Authorities are still 
                    looking for his assailant, believed to be a 
                    member of a rival Newcomer gang. on Wall 
                    Street at this hour...

      Buck is immobile. His blood is ice.


      is just finishing a shower, drying off inside the stall. 
      George is fixing his tie in the mirror. Her voice reflects 
      a new, more centered fortitude.

                    George...

                    He pauses. Smiles.

                                  SUSAN
                    You're smiling, aren't you?

                                  GEORGE
                    Yes.

                                  SUSAN

                                  GEORGE
                    I won't.

                                  SUSAN

                    You must be pretty pleased with yourself, 
                    after last night.

                                  GEORGE
                    It was rewarding, yes. Just to know that 
                    that creature was only a fiction and there 
                    was nothing seriously - biologically - 
                    wrong.

                                  SUSAN
                    Well, I'm proud of you.

      She gives him a little HUM on the neck. He smiles, exits. 
      Susan spreads on some lotion - and notices a small red RASH 
      on her arm. Touches it quizzically. Shrugs it off.


      is moving through, passing

                                  DOBBS
                    Hey Sikes, Grazer wants t'see you.

      Sikes nods, heads off. Dobbs returns to paperwork, sipping 
      coffee from a Styrofoam cup. Albert approaches tentatively.

                                  ALBERT
                    Sc-Scuse me, ...Sergeant Dobbs?

                    here...

      He holds out Dobbs' personalized mug, which he has 
        meticulously reconstructed and glued together. Dobbs 
      blinks.                                  ALBERT
                    There's st-still a few chips. I c-couldn't 
                    find 'em all, but -

      Dobbs is turning the mug over in his hands. Genuinely 
      touched by Albert's effort.

                                  DOBBS
                    ...It's fine, y'did a nice job.

                                  DOBBS
                    Yeah. Lookit.

      He puts the mug on his desk and pours his coffee into it.

                                  DOBBS
                    Good as new. ...Thanks a lot.

                    You're w-welcome. And I'll try t'be m-more 
                    careful.

      Dobbs smiles at him and nods. Albert walks away. Dobbs 
      starts to lift the mug - but the handle BREAKS OFF in his 
      hand. He mumbles in annoyance -

                                  DOBBS
                    Aw, dammit. Hey, Albert!

      Albert turns to look back, with a gentle smile.

                                  ALBERT
                    Yes, s-sergeant?

      Dobbs looks at Albert's childlike, hopeful face... A beat. 
      Then Dobbs HIDES the broken piece in his palm.

                                  DOBBS
                    ...Thanks again, man.

                            (beaming)
                    You're w-welcome. ...Man.

      Albert walks away - on air. His day is made. Probably his       whole week. Dobbs watches him. Reflectively.

                    Full metal, steel jacket. 30 caliber.                                  SIKES
                            (looking up)
                    That's what the SWAT teams use.

                                  GEORGE
                            (nodding, quietly)
                    Be may have been assassinated by a police 
                    weapon.

      Sikes glances at George, then off toward

      CAPTAIN GRAZER'S GLASS-PARTITIONED OFFICE - INTERCUT

      Grazer has been looking at Sikes, but now looks away. Puffs 
      his thin cigar.

      Sikes ponders it all for a long moment.

                                  SIKES
                    What have we got here, George old 
                    boy? ...What have we got?

                                  GEORGE
                    Honestly, Matt? ...Beats the hell outta me.

      Sikes looks up at George. Their eyes hold.


                                        THE END
