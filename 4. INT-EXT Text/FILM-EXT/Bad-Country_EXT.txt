Rain pours. A beat-up PLUMBER'S VAN is parked in the distance.
Marandino winds through gears, as Ray hits the yard
running...
POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: Marandino swings the wheel hard,
SLAMS INTO RAY -- launching him through trash bins, into the
mud.
Cobb jumps from the van and pounds Ray into handcuffs.
Simultaneously, Shepard sprints for the trailer door...
Grace explodes from the back door, bolting across the yard.
I/E. GRACE'S TRAILER - SAME
Bud scrambles on the floor of the demolished trailer. .45
held tight, he runs out after Grace.
ACROSS THE YARD
the chase rages.
MOVING WITH GRACE
as he jumps a link fence, lands and trips into a roll of
chicken wire. His sleeve catches, rips as he pulls free...
MOVING WITH BUD
at a searing pace. He slips in the mud. Staggers up. SEES
Grace disappear in the shadows.
Grace throws himself against the side of a power unit. Eyes
darting. Wheezing hard... Tries to slow his breath. Then
turns the corner...
GRACE'S POV: A SHOVEL swings from around the corner, WHAM!!!
The blow sends Grace sailing back. He SLAMS on the ground,
with a blood-covered broken face. As he tries to get up...
Bud's gun is there. And like that, it stops.
A dark, stone monolith off the 110 highway.
Raining.
An unmarked chevy is staked down the block from a tract home.
BUD V.O.
Jesse Wheeler. Thirty-one.
Front door opens and the shadowy figure of JESSE WHEELER,
whose face we cannot see, emerges.
SHEPARD
(waking Bud)
Target's out.
Jesse fires up his '74 battered green PICK-UP TRUCK. He backs
from the driveway and proceeds down the street.
BUD
(into radio)
Alright. Give him room.
Bud's car starts and we move off with them...
BUD
(into radio)
We're mobile.
In the rain, Bud and Shepard tail Jesse from a distance.
They pass an alley where a waiting BUICK falls in behind the
Chevy; Marandino and Cobb are inside.
Bud, Shepard, Cobb and Marandino, vests and shotguns, move in
unison around the house.
Bud and Cobb stay to the shadows, down a side yard...
Shepard, Marandino reach the front door. Locked. A tv plays
quietly inside. No one in the windows.
Shepard signals to Marandino...
Dim and desolate.
High stone walls topped with concertina wire. Looming guard
towers. Thick FOG blankets the yard filled with CONVICTS.
Jesse takes hold of a metal bar, lifts it from a bench press.
He does two reps. The weights BANG down and Jesse sits up.
RAY O.S.
This place is bad...
Ray adds weight to the already excessive amount. He sweats as
he talks nervously over Jesse's shoulder...
RAY
There's eyes everywhere. Like I got a
sign on my back, Jesse, they all think I
talked.
Jesse scans numerous WHITE CONS watching the Wheeler brothers.
RAY
Just the other day... some spic fish got
hit with a weight. Ten other cons, they
beat him and stabbed him till there
weren't nothin' left. And the guards let
it happen.
Ray fastens the safety collars and Jesse leans back.
RAY
His brains were on the wall, Jesse. Like
somebody painted 'em.
Jesse does another set. Weights BANG down. He slowly sits up.
JESSE
They come at you?
RAY
Not yet... But it's in the mail. I can
feel it fuckin' coming.
Ray shoots a look at a group of ARYAN BROTHERS across the
yard. CZAPP, their "leader," and ROACH. Jesse turns. Czapp
looks at him. Eyes meet. Jesse leans back.
The press shakes as Jesse does a last set. His red strained
face as the bar lands with a CRASH.
Pouring rain. Ray's corpse is loaded onto an ambulance.
Jesse steps through his fence into deep WOODS, to find a CAR
waiting idyll on a dirt road.
Dark. Eerie and desolate. The car arrives. Jesse steps out
and disappears into the shadows of a towering crane.
On the jetty, a nondescript MAN stands alone against the calm
Mississippi. His back is to us.
Jesse approaches, stands quietly beside him.
MAN'S VOICE
How's your family?
We realize now...It's Bud.
JESSE
Let's get somethin' straight. I ain't
here 'cause I'm scared. I done what I
did, 'cause certain people crossed the
line. They didn't keep their word.
BUD
Well my word counts.
They stand together, facing the liquid horizon...
BUD
I want a body, Jesse.
JESSE
How many you want?
Bud finally looks at Jesse.
A swamp area used as a mud retrieval source for the levy.
Amite River. FOG OBSCURES NEARLY EVERYTHING.
Jesse slowly emerges... Then Bud and Metro, on all sides, MAG-
LIGHTS, FLAK JACKETS and SHOTGUNS. A DUFFEL BAG of SHOVELS.
The sounds of the swamp are terrifying. Herons and bobcats.
Boots hitting water. The buzz of a million mosquitos.
SUDDENLY A RUSHING SOUND -- An ALLIGATOR shoves off the mire.
COBB
'The fuck is that?
Cobb's light catches the tail whipping into the swamp.
BUD
Yard dog. Relax.
SHEPARD
Where's this motherfucker taking us?
Jesse suddenly STOPS. LISTENS. BREATHES. Bud and Metro stare.
JESSE
(directly to Bud)
Dig here.
Metro exchanges looks, ANXIOUS. Bud nods "okay".
TIMECUT:
Metro engulfed in fog. Picks and shovels rise and fall.
MARANDINO
Bud! We hit something!
Bud excitedly descends the pit to scrape gravel from metal.
BUD
Clear it off! Come on, find the edges!
Jesse watches as a pair of STEEL DRUMS emerge.
Jesse is under the hood of his truck, fixing the engine...
When a '71 Mustang, white-on-white, roars up the street.
Jesse glances over as the car pulls alongside the driveway.
It's CATFISH, at the wheel. A wolfish grin.
CATFISH
'Bout time to get a new truck there,
Jesse.
Jesse tightens a nut with a torque wrench, says nothing.
CATFISH
Good to see you out. A free man now.
JESSE
What's goin' on, 'Fish?
CATFISH
On a Sunday drive, that's all. The good
Lord ridin' shotgun, through another
glorious Louisiana mornin'.
Jesse EYES his .45 atop the engine block, within reach.
CATFISH
Say, Jesse... Lucian's askin' about you.
Fact, a lot of people are.
Jesse stays on the engine, never turns around.
JESSE
You tell him I'll come by.
CATFISH
(no longer smiling)
That's good. I'll see you real soon then.
As Catfish drives away... We HEAR a series of photos being
taken at high-speed. FREEZE FRAME to BLACK & WHITE.
PULL BACK to a distant CONSTRUCTION TRAILER. Bud with a long
lens camera, triggers snapshots.
Bud stalks out to his car. Braddock follows, agitated. They
say nothing till they reach the car.
BUD
I set this up. Me and Jesse. If the Feds
want to help, that's fine. But not him.
BRADDOCK
What do you mean, "me and Jesse?" He's
not your partner, Bud. This case is
beyond our capacity. It requires
resources we don't have.
Bud unlocks the car. They stand, talking across the roof.
BUD
They ain't takin' us serious, Mike. They
send us some kid with a year under his
belt?! He don't even know what state he's
in... You want him in charge?!
BRADDOCK
You're God damn right I do! You're out on
a limb on this already, Bud! It's my job
to make sure you get back!
BUD
This is bullshit.
BRADDOCK
That may be. What it ain't, is open for
discussion.
Braddock walks away. Bud simmers a moment, gets in his car.
Jesse's truck moves over an old wooden bridge through
sweeping fields that stretch to a vast, wooded area.
Jesse stops at a long drive protected by locked iron gates.
A surveillance camera zooms in. Jesse looks up. A second
camera pans on Jesse, staring...
MOVE IN as crackling, electronic pixels FILL THE FRAME and...
CUT TO:
Marandino looks through BINOCULARS: As an electric fence
slides back. Jesse's truck approaches, drives through.
A twin-engine PLANE idylls. Lines of blue lights, strobe like
rivers, air traffic above... And Bud, leaning against a
nearby car with Shepard and Cobb.
Jesse helps Lynn and the baby from his truck. Together, they
walk toward the plane...
Bud, watching from a distance, nods to Lynn.
OUTSIDE THE PLANE
Jesse and Lynn stare at each other. She's crying as he pulls
her close, one arm around the baby. He says something to them
we cannot hear...
Then with the baby, Lynn boards her plane. An AGENT shuts the
door. The engine SCREAMS to life, taking off...
Jesse turns to shield his face. Lights STROBE and BLAST...
Then, ABRUPT DARKNESS AND SILENCE...
ON JESSE
now alone on the tarmac. Bud approaches; then...
JESSE
Lucian took the stones. Talked about
jobs. High-end, boxcar.
BUD
Your family's safe now.
(beat)
Let's go to work.
CUT TO:
Bud and Jesse parked next to each other, trading info.
E/I. VARIOUS HIDEOUTS - NIGHT
AB counterfeiting bills... Printing press and metal plates...
Hands stain bills with coffee grounds and cigarettes, then
industrial dryers... Jesse at a table behind tall stacks of
cash, inspecting, approving...
Jesse on the line... Bud on the other end, taking notes...
Parked under the interstate. Bud looks over Jesse's info.
A large fishing boat arrives. Numerous Fisherman load marlin
onto refrigerated trucks... Catfish, Buzz, numerous AB start
up the trucks... Jesse hands the Head Fisherman a canvas bag
of cash...
PULL BACK to reveal Shepard, Cobb and Marandino on the roof
of a neighboring port, snapping photos. Taking notes.
E/I. ISOLATED BARN - NIGHT
Trucks arrive. AB bring the marlin inside... Atop a crate,
Jesse slices a marlin open, revealing kilos of cocaine. More
marlins are cut. More cocaine.
Wood secluded. Lucian, Jesse and Kiersey sit around a table.
KIERSEY
There's a variety of matters to discuss
today, gentlemen. Eddie Moran's trial
starts next week. One of the jurors
reached out. He's asking six thousand up
front plus a job at four hundred a week.
That guarantees a hung jury with a push
for an acquittal.
LUCIAN
Three hundred. Give him a no-show at the
trucking firm.
KIERSEY
(as he writes)
Construction on the building Morris
brought us, in south-east Florida, is
complete. Every unit sold. We should see
revenues of one point four million over
our original projections.
Lucian lights a cigar, smoke curls from his lips.
KIERSEY
Lastly, our "friends" from the Middle
East. They put a final offer on the
table. They'll fund our operation in
Louisiana if we agree to act on their
behalf. Political targets mostly, on the
basis of our approval...
(beat)
I advise we do a test case. Perhaps a
sample of their resources.
LUCIAN
"Final offer?" Demands...
(beat)
Close the deal. We'll cook the cash for
it. By the time they realize, we'll have
our return.
(laughs to Jesse)
You believe they're travelin' all the way
to Louisiana just to get fuckin' robbed?
CUT TO:
Jesse and Lucian walk together through green, expansive
countryside. A pair of Arabian mares graze nearby.
LUCIAN
I want you runnin' point on this one...
JESSE
I'll be honest, I was hopin' for
somethin' bigger.
LUCIAN
What do you got in mind?
JESSE
How 'bout a few of them heads off the
list?
LUCIAN
We got guys for that now. Catfish, Buzz.
What do you want to go back to that for?
JESSE
The money's worth twice this. Bring back
a head it's fifteen grand; Bring a heart,
it's thirty, right?
Lucian looks at Jesse, who feels Lucian's scrutiny.
LUCIAN
Tell you what. Do this other thing we got
lined up...
(beat)
Then I'll give you that taste.
Dark, factory skyline. Burnt out cars sit before a WAREHOUSE.
Closed for construction. A VAN arrives. A blinking barricade
is pulled back, allowing entrance...
Generators light the scene: A group of SHIITE MUSLIMS wait by
a pair of idle FREIGHT TRUCKS. A crew of five AB SOLDIERS
exit the van: Jesse, Catfish and Buzz among them.
CUT TO:
The door to one Freight truck rolls to the top, revealing a
converted ASSAULT WEAPONRY SHOWCASE.
Below covered scaffolding, both crews stand. Guns bulge
through their coats. No talking. No sudden movement.
Shiites watch Jesse and Catfish examine the merchandise: SEMI
AUTOMATICS, SHOTGUNS, CARBINES, SUB-MACHINE GUNS...
Everyone looks at each other. Jesse acknowledges worth.
Catfish pulls a large CANVAS BAG from the van, filled with
cash. As he carries it toward a bench, a large Shiite (OMAR)
reaches for the bag before Catfish can set it down...
...Both men hold tight. Neither letting go. And there's a
moment.
JESSE
(low)
Catfish.
Catfish and Omar are eye-to-eye. Then, Catfish lets go with a
smile:
CATFISH
Go 'head. Count it.
The Shiite leader, NASEEM, sees the strife.
NASEEM
There a problem?
JESSE
No problem. Money's all there.
Omar hands the bag to Naseem. The count starts. Both crews
watch closely...
...All except Catfish, fixated on Omar, who stares back.
CATFISH
'The fuck you lookin' at...?
The count stops. Naseem looks to Omar. Questions in Arabic go
back and forth. The pressure getting to the group...
JESSE
(low)
Catfish, would you shut the fuck up? This
ain't the time.
NASEEM
(to Catfish)
Yes, listen to your boss.
CATFISH
What?! What fuckin' "boss?" You best
watch your ass, sand nigger.
NASEEM
Piece of shit--!
Everyone reaches for their guns. Threats SHOUTED in Arabic
and English.
JESSE
Take it easy! Take it easy!
SUDDENLY ARC LIGHTS BEHIND A DISTANT BARRIER IGNITE, flooding
the scene. Everyone turns.
A VOICE
(over a loud speaker)
ATF! THE PERIMETER'S SURROUNDED!
Omar reaches for the bag of cash...
BLAM! Catfish FIRES, point blank, shooting Omar in the face.
And World War III erupts.
AB's FIRE. Shiites RETURN FIRE. From several stakeout
locations, ATF AGENTS deploy and OPEN FIRE.
Jesse is grazed in the shoulder, slips, staggers-runs.
SHIITE #1 FIRES THREE SHOT BURSTS at AB #1, who's blown
apart. A generator and ATF #1 collapse.
ATF #2 and #3 with pump shotguns OPEN UP on the AB's van.
Naseem, over a Mercedes roof, FIRES A BURST at ATF, then
swings onto AB #2 and FIRES, killing him. Naseem jumps into
the Mercedes, yells at the DRIVER to go.
Buzz RAPID FIRES, hits Shiite #1 in the back. Shiite #1 is
spun around and Buzz shoots him in the head.
Catfish FIRES into the lot... Hitting SHIITE #2.
IN THE MERCEDES, Driver floors it. ATF re-emerges, kneels and
PUMPS SHOTS into the Mercedes.
Jesse has taken off, past the lumber storage. Catfish and
Buzz follow, breaking for the Freight truck.
IN THE MERCEDES, Driver is blown apart by ATF. The car
CRASHES into a dumpster, knocking Naseem out.
Jesse, Catfish and Buzz jump into the Freight. ATF FIRES.
WINDOWS EXPLODE. SHIITE #3, trying to climb in is shot down.
Jesse, behind the wheel... BURNS rubber pulling out of the
stop, over and through a scaffold, collapsing it.
The Freight truck draws everyone's FIRE. Jesse pilots it
through the CHAOS. Scaffold DRAGGING behind. Sparks fly.
JESSE'S POV: Where he's going. An opening in the
construction, leads back to the HIGHWAY and ONCOMING TRAFFIC.
ATF CARS speeds in, the opposite way...
AS THE VEHICLES PASS: JESSE AND ATF
lock eyes. And the Freight makes the highway, scattering
traffic, to the sound of ongoing GUNFIRE...
CUT TO:
The moon hangs low as Jesse parks the Freight truck among
tall grass, where a vacant BREAD TRUCK is waiting.
TIMECUT:
As Catfish exits the truck...
...Jesse takes Catfish's gun, grabs him by the neck and SLAMS
him against the cab. FACE TO FACE.
JESSE
You're a piece of work, Catfish.
Buzz grabs at Jesse; Jesse HURLS him to the ground.
CATFISH
Them niggers crossed the line...I had to
burn 'em--
JESSE
--You had to keep your mouth shut! On a
job, you don't do fuckin' shit 'less I
say!
CATFISH
'The fuck off me--!
Jesse slams him back again. HOLDS his throat.
JESSE
(low, deadly)
Fuck me up again, you hear me? I'll leave
you where I find you. Got that?
PAUSE. Catfish glares, then concedes.
JESSE
Unload the fuckin' truck.
Jesse starts moving crates from the Freight onto the bread
truck. Catfish and Buzz watch for a moment, then join.
Off a deserted street. A DENSE FOG resides, far as the eye
can see. And Jesse, in a PHONE BOOTH, drops a dime and
dials...
LYNN V.O.
(clearly asleep)
Hello...
JESSE
It's me.
LYNN V.O.
You okay?
(off Jesse's silence)
Honey, you alright?
JESSE
I'm okay. Just need to hear your voice.
How's little Ray...?
LYNN V.O.
I'll put him on.
SILENCE for a moment...then a quiet baby's voice.
LYNN V.O.
It's daddy on the phone, say hello.
Emotion rises to Jesse's face. He holds it in, barely.
ANGLE: DOWN THE STREET
a lone CAR is parked in the shadows, fog rolling past...
...Jesse sees it, can't see who's inside it.
LYNN V.O.
Jesse?
He hangs up.
A LONG MOMENT... Jesse stands there, watching the car... He
slowly makes his way toward the back of the store, where his
truck is parked. Pulse pounding, he tries the door...it's
locked. Eyeing the car, he unlocks his truck.
THERE'S SUDDEN MOVEMENT. Jesse spins. And out of the darkness
-- steps Bud -- ready to pounce...
BUD
Where the hell you been?
(Jesse's look)
Two days missin', you broke protocol.
Three, and you're a flight risk.
Agents'll hunt your ass down.
JESSE
(anger spiking, pacing)
I can't keep doin' this. I can't fuckin'
breathe. Even the shadows got eyes.
BUD
This is the job. If I don't hear from
you, I can't protect you.
JESSE
(in his face)
Protect me?! I about got my head fuckin'
shot off, 'cause your guys was
"protecting" me!
BUD
Those ain't my guys!
JESSE
I don't give a fuck-- I don't want your
protection! I want out!
BUD
There is no "out." Not for either of us.
Not till it's done...
(low, definitive)
Get me that list.
Jesse STARES -- a malevolence in his eyes that freezes Bud to
the spot. Then, Jesse climbs in his truck and drives off.
CUT TO:
Jesse climbs into his truck and pulls out to the street...
CUT TO:
JESSE'S TRUCK heading up the INTERSTATE, crossing into EAST
BATON ROUGE, then driving through dark RESIDENTIAL STREETS of
Bud's neighborhood...
I/E. JESSE'S TRUCK - LATE NIGHT
He pulls to the curb, parks. Jesse racks a MOSSBERG SG, loads
it with solid shot, then lays the gun on his lap.
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: Bud's house in the distance.
And Jesse sits there, several moments...WAITS...BREATHES...
Then he exits the truck...
Jesse moves -- fast, soundless -- toward the house. With his
shotgun, scales the fence, as we--
CUT TO:
A VAN arrives, stops. No headlights, two hundred yards from
the house. INSIDE THE VAN: Catfish and Buzz. Several AB
SOLDIERS in back, armed to the teeth.
BUZZ
That's his truck.
CATFISH
(nods)
Let's see what he does.
The motor ticks and ticks and...
It's dark, quiet; but the muted glow of a tv in the living
room. JESSE MOVES IN SHADOW, shotgun leading... He stops.
LISTENS...
WE HEAR THE SOUND OF HARD WATER FROM A SINK OFF-SCREEN
...Jesse moves toward it...
Through a window, WE SEE Bud washing dishes. Then, slipping
INTO FRAME...
JESSE
watching him. Pulse pounding, his mind on overdrive, trying
to untangle identity and consequence... Then...
He taps the window, and Bud looks up...
CUT TO:
THE BACK DOOR
Bud opens it:
BUD
Jesse. 'The hell you doin' here?
JESSE
You been made, Bud. We gotta skin out.
BACK TO:
Jesse hurries down the lawn. Bud to his Chevy.
SUDDENLY THE SOUND OF TIRES BURN... CATFISH'S VAN SEARS DOWN
THE STREET...
...THE DOOR SLIDES OPEN AS AB SOLDIERS OPEN FIRE FROM SUB
MACHINE GUNS.
Jesse drops behind a neighbor's sedan.
Bud dives behind the Chevy. ROUNDS SLAM through sheet metal,
interior, and out the other end.
AB Soldiers exit the van, spread and keep FIRING. Jesse's
sedan takes hits. WINDOWS AND TIRES EXPLODE.
Bud and Jesse aim over their roofs. Take and RETURN FIRE.
Catfish emerges, kneels and pumps SHOTS into Bud's Chevy.
The WINDSHIELD is BLOWN APART -- Shattered glass covers Bud.
CUT TO:
Buzz rounds the van and OPENS FIRE.
Jesse and Bud cover. Their eyes connect. Bud signals towards
the house. Jesse nods...
...then lays cover fire with the Mossberg. AB #3 is spun and
thrown.
Bud, under fire and firing back, races back into the house.
Jesse keeps FIRING.
I/E. BUD'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Bud YANKS an M-16 from the closet and slams the door.
OUTSIDE
Jesse, on his knees, pulls a secondary .45 from his waistband
and fires over the hood of the sedan.
CATFISH FIRES HIS SHOTGUN AND JESSE'S HAND EXPLODES IN HALF.
JESSE
(crumbles hard)
Fuck!
Jesse hits the dirt, WRIST PUMPING BLOOD.
AB #4 and #5 move in for the kill, when out of nowhere --
SHEPARD'S CAR SPEEDS ON SCENE -- His door kicks out; SHEPARD
PUMPS SHOTS, EXCHANGING.
Buzz comes up from behind, aims -- BULLETS FLASH AND PUNCH
THROUGH SHEPARD.
INSIDE THE HOUSE
Bud swings the M-16 through the glass and BLASTS AWAY,
killing AB #4, as Jesse staggers toward the house, holding
his wrist...
...and DIVES inside, then kicks the door shut.
CUT TO:
Catfish, Buzz and AB Soldiers flank the house.
A LONG-HAIRED AB on the lawn fires dozens of shots from an
M-1.
Catfish and Bud exchange CROSSFIRE as...
...Buzz starts up the van and Catfish jumps in, followed by
Long-Hair...
I/E. BUD'S HOUSE + STREET
Bud runs out to the street, M-16 FIRING at the fleeing van.
Bullets shatter the back window as the van speeds around the
corner through garbage cans and a residential fence...
ON BUD
standing there. He turns, and STOPS when he SEES...
SHEPARD
inert, bullet-ridden.
BUD
Shepard!
(runs over)
No...
Bud holds his partner, horrified. Around them, bodies on the
lawn. Disabled vehicles. Doom overlays the property.
TIMECUT:
Pandemonium as the street is clogged with POLICE VEHICLES and
MEDIC UNITS. Braddock arrives with Cobb and Marandino.
Bud moves alongside a PARAMEDIC wheeling a gurneyed Jesse,
with a pressure bandage and splint, onto an ambulance.
BUD
(turns to Braddock)
We run 'em now, Mike. Right fuckin' now!
BRADDOCK
(nods)
What do you need?
SMASH TO:
E/I. LUCIAN'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - PRE DAWN
A huge BATTERING RAM knocks it right off the hinges. SWAT,
Bud rush in with rifles...
...Room by room. Everyone clears. The house is empty.
SWAT #1
Nothing.
E/I. STEEL MILL - PRE DAWN
SWAT TEAMS have secured the premises. Two HELICOPTERS sweep
the grounds via SPOTLIGHT. A manhunt for Lucian Adams.
INSIDE, Cobb on his radio:
COBB
No one here, Bud...
SHEPARD'S FUNERAL. UNIFORMED POLICEMEN saluting as a PRIEST
gives the eulogy.
BUD
at the gravesite, with Braddock, Cobb and Marandino. A salute
is FIRED with rifles.
LATER
Bud stands alone. Dry-eyed, vacant stare.
CUT TO:
Flashbulbs burst rapid-fire as coroner crews and police
secure a crime scene: Richard Morris sits dead at the wheel
of his car, a plastic bag over his head filled with blood.
IN THE FOREGROUND, lit by police lights, is Bud and Cobb.
COBB
...His cranium was smashed with a lead
pipe. Then the plastic bag. He choked to
death while it filled up with blood.
BUD
Got I.D.?
COBB
'Name's Richard Morris. He's a top dog
lawyer-lobbyist out of Washington.
Cobb proffers Morris' wallet. Bud sifts through cards --
Several businesses, out of state -- Then stops cold at one:
"Daniel J. Kiersey, Attorney at Law"
BUD
Put a tap on that line.
COBB
Braddock ain't gonna like it.
BUD
Do it.
Braddock arrives on scene. Disturbed expression:
BRADDOCK
Bud. I just got off with Nokes.
BUD
And?
BRADDOCK
We got a problem.
CUT TO:
Lynn emerges from the grocery, looking sad and prematurely
aged. Her baby in the cart, tucked between bags of food.
FBI #3 (TOM) helps Lynn and the baby into an Unmarked Car.
A CARGO VAN pulls up and parks. The Labor Team abandons it,
dumping gloves and outer clothing into plastic bags,
REVEALING: A CREW OF AB SOLDIERS LEAD BY CATFISH.
The bags go in the back of a waiting SUBURBAN. Catfish takes
the wheel. The crew climbs in, drives away.
BACK TO:
Pouring rain.
It's a madhouse outside. A crowd is gathered around a police
action in progress. MEDICS are tending to the broken nose of
a bartender (PETE) in his 30s. METRO COP #1 stands by.
A car pulls up and Cobb gets out with Marandino. They
approach the bartender.
BARTENDER
(to Metro #1)
He's out of his mind. 'Asked him to slow
down; and he punched me in the face.
Cobb and Marandino approach.
COBB
(to bartender)
Hey, Pete. You alright?
BARTENDER
I'm alright. The bar ain't.
MARANDINO
(to Metro #1)
We'll smooth it out. Clear the street.
Cobb and Marandino start toward the bar.
A lone, dilapidated HOUSE BOAT sits heavily in the bayou.
Lights on inside. Dense FOG overlays.
The front lights go out. A terrible darkness.
Engulfed in flames. SIRENS and LIGHTS as FIRE TRUCKS and FIRE
BOATS douse the burning boat with hard water.
Among a crowd of SPECTATORS, the shaken Hooker is being
questioned by Marandino.
Bud and Cobb stand apart.
COBB
We've had a tap on Kiersey's line forty
eight hours now. It's clean. Whatever's
he's up to, Bud, it ain't comin' through
the front door.
Bud starts leaving the scene. Suddenly FITCH and two AGENTS
barge forward.
FITCH
Carter! We need to talk.
BUD
Get out of my way, Fitch.
FITCH
(following Bud)
This is my investigation. Jesse's cowboy
bullshit is not how it's done!
BUD
While your agents build their cases and
set for court, he'll erase the debt owed
to all of you. Overnight.
FITCH
So you're implying I should thank him?
Bud shakes his head in disgust, keeps walking...
FITCH
Look, Carter, whether we like it or not,
you and I have to work together on this.
We entice Jesse back. I'll get him full
protection, if he agrees to testify.
BUD
That'll never happen.
FITCH
Why the hell not?!
BUD
(turns)
'Cause it's over, Fitch. It's done. He
has nothing. Why do you think he lit that
fire? To plant a flag. To let us know he
doesn't need our protection. Doesn't want
it. He would've just left 'em for dead.
FITCH
For God sakes, listen to me! I'm not
taking the fall for this! The plan is--
BUD
No, the truth is, Fitch, you ain't got
balls big enough to relate to this guy.
If you had listened to me, we wouldn't be
in this situation. Jesse wouldn't be in
this situation. And you wouldn't be
askin' stupid fuckin' questions!
(walking away)
I'll bring him in myself. Just keep your
agents off my ass.
Bud storms off.
BLACK.
FADE IN:
Lynn stumbles through the woods, holding her baby. Scared.
Lost. Their skin bleached-out. Eyes hollow. Like apparitions.
We're in a dream. A sadistic enhancement.
DISSOLVE TO:
JESSE'S EYES
His family's image dissolves inside them.
WIDEN to reveal Jesse before a cracked mirror in a SERVICE
STATION BATHROOM. Perspiring, he re-bandages his hand as
blood swirls down the drain.
Cars line crowded streets in the heart of New Orleans.
I/E. BUD'S CAR - LOWER FRENCH QUARTER - DUSK
TIGHT ON A DASHBOARD CLOCK: 5:04 p.m.
Bud, waiting, parked outside a POLICE PRECINCT in the Lower
French Quarter. Kiersey's pager on the dash. Waiting. Then:
THE PAGER BUZZES.
Bud grabs it, hurries out to a nearby pay-phone. Dials...
BUD
(into phone)
It's Bud. I got a number.
INTERCUT:
A busy promenade near the down river end of the Mississippi.
Bud waits low in his car, parked in a distant lot. Through
the windshield, WE SEE the subject of his surveillance...
A PAY-PHONE
on a crowded sidewalk. Faces pass. A Man in a JACKET arrives
at the phone. He waits. Checks his watch...
...Bud checks his clock: 6:10
The "Jacket" picks up the phone and dials...
KIERSEY'S PAGER GOES OFF.
BUD
Here we go.
Jacket waits. No call. Walks away. Bud FOLLOWS on foot...
A sprawling swirl of humanity, live jazz and bars. The Jacket
passes through. Twenty feet back, Bud keeps pace...
ANOTHER PHONE BOOTH
Jacket enters. Pumps coins into the PAY-PHONE. Dials...
RECEPTIONIST V.O.
(recording)
You've reached the law offices of Daniel
J. Kiersey--
Jacket hangs up. More coins. Another number...
KIERSEY'S VOICE V.O.
(recording)
Hello, you've reached the Kiersey
residence. No one's home right now--
Jacket hangs up. Exits east onto BARRACKS STREET. Glances
over his shoulder, then ahead, as Bud rounds the corner...
Jacket crosses into a LIQUOR STORE.
Bud stalls at the corner, casing the street. Takes everything
in. He reaches for his cigarettes, finds a crumpled back.
Then crosses the street to...
A NEWSSTAND
outside the liquor store. Bud buys cigarettes and a newspaper.
He opens the paper, glances at the headlines. At the same
time, peers into the LIQUOR STORE WINDOW...
...The Jacket walks toward the back of the store and out a
door to an ALLEY.
Bud heads south on Decatur. Lights a cigarette, as he passes
various stores on the block. A private two-story building
with blacked out windows at the far end: "TIBEDAUX'S TAVERN".
Bud turns into...
Lined with boutiques on one side. Back of Tibedaux's on the
other. A cargo gate is up and MEN are hoisting crates into a
truck...
The Jacket is there, talking to them:
JACKET
Should've been on the road twenty minutes
ago. Hurry it up.
Bud pauses at a DRESS SHOP. Stares into the storefront glass,
reflecting the Jacket and Men...
Jacket walks off. Bud flicks his cigarette, enters...
Jacket exits the Colonial and enters a corner CAFE. INSIDE,
WE SEE Jacket move to a pay-phone and dial...
AERIAL SHOT: LOOKING DOWN as a TOWN CAR circles the block.
COBB V.O.
(radio filter)
Got a possible here.
The TOWN CAR passes slow... REVEAL NOW: MARANDINO, staked,
having dinner outside the cafe. Crowded tables around him.
COBB V.O.
(radio filter)
Town Car. Black. Second time around.
MOVING WITH THE TOWN CAR, as it turns onto ESPLANADE AVENUE
and parks before the Colonial.
REVEAL NOW: COBB, in a nondescript VAN. Parked a quarter
block off Esplanade. He triggers photos through tinted glass.
STILL PHOTOS CLICK -- the Town Car doors open. Two AB
SOLDIERS step out. Bulges where their holsters are. Then a
third man from in back: A boss, HAROLD KAY, 50s.
COBB
(into radio)
Bud, you see this?
Bingham, Kay, Mills and two Soldiers start toward the CAFE.
COBB V.O.
(radio filter)
Marandino, they comin' your way.
Marandino looks up from his table, to find this crew of men
walking right for him. Marandino stares. A frozen moment...
The crew of men getting closer now, a few yards away...
Marandino - heart racing - slides his Browning 9MM out and
slips it onto the table, below his napkin, aims...
...When the crew abruptly turns and enters the cafe.
Marandino exhales relief...
Marandino watches as Bingham, Kay and Mills pull their coats
on and exit the cafe...
MARANDINO
(into transmitter)
Call went down.
FOLLOW Marandino as he walks down the street, knocks on the
back of the Van.
Cobb approaches the front door, where a pair of large DOORMEN
stand.
DOORMAN #1
Can we help you?
COBB
Just lookin' for a drink and a bite to
eat.
DOORMAN #1
Think you'll find what you're lookin' for
across the street.
(gestures)
Try the cafe.
Cobb stares at both Doormen #1 and #2, immovable forces.
COBB
Alright. Thanks.
SHOTS OF COBB AND MARANDINO
waiting. Patrons empty out. Cars drive away.
DISSOLVE TO:
Lights from a CADILLAC and a GRAND MARQUIS appear and come
down the street - past Cobb - SLOWLY. Blacked out windows...
Cobb looks over his shoulder, SEES the Figure 75 yards away,
moving briskly across Esplanade...
We still can't see his face.
Jesse slaps a clay plastique with a DETONATOR onto Tibedaux's
back door, then covers.
There's a loud EXPLOSION as the DOOR BLOWS OPEN.
Bud bursts outside, full throttle. Shouts into the radio:
BUD
Jam the alley! No one goes in or out!
Marandino hits the gas. TIRES SCREECH as he slides sideways
and secures the mouth of the alley. Door kicks out. 12-gauge
levels.
Doorman #1, HEARING the commotion turns...
...SEES INSIDE THE CAFE, Cobb cuffing Jacket and Barkeep.
Doorman #1 draws a Para-Ordnance .45, FIRES. A VOLLEY OF
SHOTS SLAM INTO THE CAFE.
Cobb can't make it through INCOMING FIRE and covers.
Remaining PATRONS SCREAM, drop under tables.
Doorman #1 KEEPS FIRING, advancing towards the Cafe, when--
BOOM! A SHOTGUN BLAST takes his head off -- REVEALING BUD --
behind him, running toward Tibedaux's.
I/E. TIBEDAUX'S, DOWNSTAIRS
PATRONS stampede for the door. Lucian, Bingham and Kay with
AB #7 and #8 follow...
OUTSIDE TO THE STREET
...and Bud is coming right for them.
CLOSE ON LUCIAN. The shock of seeing Bud.
Lucian FIRES.
Bud kneels and PUMPS SHOTS - hits AB #7 and #8 - killing them.
Lucian, Kay, Bingham flee back inside.
Cobb runs out of the cafe, pushing through civilians.
COBB
Down! Get down!
Bud pursues Lucian...
BUD
Stay on the door! I'm goin' in!
AB #10 and #11 run out and swing their SMGs, FIRING onto the
alley and KILLING MARANDINO... Then charging to the front--
COBB FIRES. AB #10 is BLOWN APART, as AB #11 FIRES back,
hitting Cobb in the vest. His ribs broken, he sits down
stunned.
COBB
(into radio)
I'm hit. I'm fuckin' hit.
AB #11 running past as several BLACK AND WHITES now arrive.
TAKE AND RETURN FIRE -- AB #11 is shot dead.
Police shouting. Civilians running, as...
The sun is out. The sky above is clear.
