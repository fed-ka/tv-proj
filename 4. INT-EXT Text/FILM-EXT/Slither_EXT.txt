Celebratory banners are strung over this street, including
one that reads: "DEER SEASON STARTS TODAY!" We're in the
center of Wheelsy, South Carolina, a moderately depressed
small town. Today's a big day, as HUNTERS from far and
near crowd the streets in their massive pickups.
MEN spill in and out of a gun store buying loads of
ammunition. OLD HUNTERS with faces like prunes stand
outside Angell's Tavern getting drunk. A MAN WITH FEW
TEETH has a dead deer strung out across the back of his
truck, skinning the carcass, its innards spilling loose.
JACK, an older, uptight man in fancy clothes, is driving
through town in his big old Cadillac. He comes upon a
hunter's truck, double-parked, jamming up traffic. Jack
jams on his HORN.
JACK
Get the fuck out of the way,
cocksucker!
Jack turns to see a MOTHER and her two CHILDREN on the
sidewalk, listening and staring in shock.
MOTHER
Mornin', Mayor.
Jack smiles, a bit embarrassed. Jack notices a group of
HUNTERS on the sidewalk, looking and pointing at something
up in the sky.
He looks up to see a small meteor plummeting toward earth.
Students file out of the open door for the day. Kylie,
Starla's pretty student, is among them. She and her FRIEND
are looking up at the falling meteor.
KYLIE
Prolly go find it later, sell it
on eBay.
A RANCHER with a cleft palate turns his head to see the
meteor, much closer to him. It's rushing down toward the
treetops of a nearby forest.
3.
Four cops -- BILL PARDY, the town's young,
relaxed, and
handsome Chief of Police, WALLY, an older,
toad-like cop,
TREVOR, a younger, somewhat goofy cop, and
MARGARET, a
mannish cop -- are standing stock-still in
the station
parking lot. They CHUCKLE.
TREVOR
Did ya' feel that?!
They enter the station.
A sizable two-story suburban home.
All the lights are
off but one.
GRANT (O.S.)
So I get home today, phone's
ringing. It's Hank Wilcox.
Grant sits on a boulder beside a creek, looking miserable,
downing a six pack.
He throws an empty can into the creek, when he glances
down and sees particles flowing down the river.
Grant slides off the boulder. He kneels and examines the
particles. They shimmer in the moonbeams coming down
between the trees.
Grant peers up the creek from where the particles are
coming.
11.
He sees a gap on the edge of the creek, where water
splashes and is diverted in streamlets down the hill.
He approaches the spot, and comes upon a small crater on
the side of the creek. The meteorite is inside the crater,
but it's cracked into pieces. The rock seems almost
organic, like a shell. The shimmery specks are part of
the shell itself, flecking off into the creek and rushing
downstream.
Grant crouches. He touches the meteorite, and feels some
sort of goo inside it. It's sticky.
He notices a strip of the same slime leading out of the
crater itself and into the woods.
Grant, curiously, slowly, follows the slimy trail.
He comes to a flurry of colorful wild flowers. Something
is rustling the flowers ever so slightly. He moves in
closer.
A gelatinous yellow organism slithers sluggishly between
the flowers. The organism is a mound a few inches high,
gross and veiny, yet as colorful as the flowers around
it. A small cavity on the apex of the organism constricts
and expands lightly. I guess it's not worth keeping secret
that this thing looks a tad like a bright yellow vagina.
GRANT
What the...?
Grant is a little freaked-out by this thing, even
frightened. He looks around for someone else.
GRANT
Hey, anybody 'round here?
'Lo?
No one answers. Grant looks down at the organism, unsure.
He picks up a tree branch.
Grant softly prods the organism with the pointy end of
the branch.
Nothing happens.
He does it again.
The thing pulses a little, and surges
toward Grant.
Grand pokes it again.
A small, thin quill -- a SPORE -- emerges from the cavity
in the center of the organism. The spore is quivering
and, as it trembles upward, little bulbed spurs pop up as
well.
Grant slowly bends down to look at it when --
12.
The SPORE suddenly SHOOTS OUT.
It strikes Grant in the
stomach.
GRANT
Ow!
Fuck!
Grant yanks up his shirt, looking at a wound on his
abdomen. He watches as the spore quivers and disappears
inside him.
He clutches his stomach, SCREAMS in agony. He falls back
into the colorful flowers. His body convulses.
MATCH CUT TO:
Grant steps out of the truck in his driveway, when he
hears --
NEIGHBOR (O.S.)
Hey ya', Grant.
Grant swings his head toward his NEIGHBOR, who is taking
a happy BEAGLE for a morning walk.
NEIGHBOR
What were ya', night-fishing again?
You catch anything?
GRANT
I caught a little somethin', yeah.
Grant walks inside his house.
Grant backs his pickup toward the garage. Meat is piled
into the bed. Wrapped packages of meat fill the seats
around him.
Starla pulls into the driveway.
She presses the button
on her garage door opener.
The door SHUDDERS but stays closed.
Starla's confused.
She gets out of the car and examines the door. She looks
down and sees a new padlock, locking the door to the cement
driveway with bolts on both sides.
Grant steps onto the front porch to get some air. He's
blinking and seems a little dizzy. He gazes around the
neighborhood:
Down the way, a BOY in a little league uniform and his
MOTHER get out of their car and walk toward the front
door.
Across the street, THROUGH A KITCHEN WINDOW, a PLUMP MAN
and his WIFE are eating dinner.
At another home, a SHORT MAN steps on a stepladder,
changing the dome light on his porch.
Grant stares at these individuals, looking like an animal
ready to lunge at its prey, fighting the urge.
21.
GRANT
Meat.
He HEARS a BARKING. Grant turns to see the beagle next
door, tied to the tree, YAPPING at him.
Grant looks around to make sure no one's watching.
Starla walks to get the paper in her robe, and she sees a
BOY, aged thirteen or so, stapling a LOST: REWARD flyer
to a telephone pole, with a picture of the beagle.
STARLA
Roscoe's gone?
The Boy's face is streaked from a long night of crying.
BOY
You haven't seen him, have you?
Starla shakes her head.
STARLA
I'm sure he'll show up, Tim.
The Boy nods, and walks to the next telephone pole to put
up another flyer.
Grant moves up a hill, between trees, looking around for
something. He comes to a stop, trying to remember which
way to go. He does, and moves on.
OLD BARN - LATER
Grant comes upon an old wooden barn. The structure is
maybe a hundred years old, and long abandoned. It's
spattered with graffiti. Grant stares at it.
MOMENTS LATER
Grant gathers large fronds and other foliage in his arms.
A banner hangs across the front of the lodge, "DEER CHEER
'05" -- the first Friday of deer season in Wheelsy.
Inflatable deer totems decorate the front of the wooden
lodge. RAMBUNCTIOUS MUSIC comes from inside. Partyers
enter.
Grant and Starla step out of his truck. As they do, one
of Starla's students, Will, sees her and waves. Starla
waves back.
Grant notices this and grabs Starla's arm, a bit too hard,
pulling her back.
GRANT
Who's that?
STARLA
It's just one of my students, Grant.
Grant stares at the boy with distrust, and ushers Starla
towards the lodge.
Bill, Trevor and Margaret are hanging out on a large rock
outside the entranceway, drinking beer. Bill watches
Grant and Starla cross the lot. Trevor sees this.
TREVOR
What's she see in that douchebag?
BILL
That's the mystery of the ages
there, Trev. Starla was seventeen
when they got engaged. He was,
like, in his thirties. No one
even knew they were goin' out till
she had that ring on her finger.
MARGARET
Ain't no mystery to it. She's
raised in them shanties off St.
Luc. Dirt-poor.
TREVOR
Gold-digger, huh?
BILL
Hell, you don't know that, Margaret.
Margaret shrugs, BELCHES. Jack, the mayor, with his WIFE,
stops beside them after she does, staring at her.
JACK
Bill, you're Chief of police now.
(MORE)
24.
JACK (CONT'D)
Comes with some Goddamn
responsibility, like keeping your
people in line.
BILL
You're right, Jack.
Margaret,
you're fired.
Margaret and Trevor LAUGH. Jack shakes his head with
disdain, and enters the party.
Grant steps outside, and looks around.
Across the parking lot is a playground. Two YOUNG CHILDREN
are spinning on a little carousel there.
Grant starts toward them.
The Children GIGGLE, unaware of Grant inching up on them.
Grant gets closer, excited, when he hears:
25.
BRENDA (O.S.)
Hey there, handsome.
Grant turns and see Brenda Gutierrez standing there.
Once again, she's very drunk.
BRENDA
Must be fate, us meeting again
like this.
Grant smiles.
GRANT
Well, you might be right...
Grant sees if anyone's watching.
He circles around her.
GRANT
You're lookin' awful pretty.
BRENDA
Shut up.
Brenda SNICKERS.
GRANT
Where's the old half-Mexican?
BRENDA
Took the kids to his Mom's for the
weekend.
Grant smiles.
Grant holds Brenda's hand, and he pulls her between the
trees. She GIGGLES.
BRENDA
Where you takin' me, you bad boy!
Grant stops in a secluded place, beside the creek, looking
around. No one's there. He turns toward her, smiles.
GRANT
Take off your shirt, doll.
Brenda looks at him, confused.
GRANT
Guess it's hard to explain how
amazin' a human brain is to someone
who that's all they know.
26.
BRENDA
What?
GRANT
Stuff you can never imagine.
Feelings. Big thoughts. And love.
Yeah. I'm inclined to parlay it
into somethin' more. So, go ahead
there, beautiful, and take off
your shirt.
Brenda, though startled, leans back on a boulder and starts
unbuttoning her blouse. After a moment, she looks at
Grant, trying to be sexy while she does it. Grant looks
at her in her bra.
GRANT
Nice.
Grant unbuttons his shirt as well.
As he removes it
completely, he turns toward her.
Brenda sees the wound on his stomach has blossomed into a
veiny, blue-moss-encrusted yellow spout, huge and pulsing.
BRENDA
Grant!?
What -- ?!
Grant grabs her.
She tries to push his arms away.
BRENDA
No, no, we --
Brenda gets up, trying to run away. But Grant grabs her
necklace, yanking her back. The necklace snaps and falls
into the creek beside them.
Grant pins Brenda's wrists against the rock.
She struggles
to get free.
Brenda's eyes widen as she looks down to see the writhing,
tentacle-like tubule emerge from Grant's wound. She
SCREAMS.
Grant shoves his hand over her mouth, shutting her up.
He's extremely strong. She watches as the tubule twitches,
feeling its way like a blind snake.
The tubule comes to rest on her abdomen. Tears stream
down from Brenda's eyes. It pushes into her flesh.
Brenda goes into convulsions. Something -- a fluid --
pumps through the tubule and into Brenda.
Grant watches Brenda without emotion as her body spasms
there beside him.
27.
Then she falls back, unconscious.
The tubule retracts
into Grant's torso.
Starla is leaning over a wooden rail, looking at the lights
of the town below. She turns to see Bill lean on the
rail beside her. She looks genuinely happy.
STARLA
Hey, Bill!
Starla catches herself, and looks around to see if Grant
is watching.
BILL
Don't worry. The lurker ain't
around. I checked.
STARLA
That's not funny.
BILL
Sorry.
STARLA
Whatcha' doin'?
BILL
Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm
too buff. Too much muscle mass.
Starla LAUGHS.
BILL
What you up to?
STARLA
Just checking out the lights.
Bill and Starla look out over the city together.
BILL
Pretty, ain't they?
STARLA
I don't know. I've seen them so
many times before. I guess any
spot gets boring after awhile.
BILL
Well that's only if you're in the
wrong spot.
Starla looks at him.
28.
BILL
There's a place over there on the
bluffs. When the fog is just right,
like tonight, the lights of Main
look like a kaleidoscope.
STARLA
Oh, yeah?
BILL
Mm hm. But only a few folks know
how to get there. Wally. Rollo
Linkski coulda taken you, but
'course he got hit by that train.
Me.
STARLA
I'll get Wally to show me sometime
then.
Starla LAUGHS out loud.
So does Bill.
BILL
Oh, will you now?
STARLA
GRANT (O.S.)
Or Rollo's ghost.
Starla.
They turn to see Grant approaching.
He's a mess.
His
pants are streaked with mud.
STARLA
Grant, where'd you go?
BILL
Hey, Grant.
Grant eyes Bill with suspicion.
He grabs Starla.
GRANT
You ready, sugarplum?
Starla nods.
She looks at Bill and mouths:
STARLA
Bye.
Bill watches Grant and Starla head off, as he downs the
rest of his beer. Wally walks up beside him.
WALLY
Surprised you're able to lift a
mug after carrying that torch for
so long.
29.
BILL
Hey, Wally. Glad you're here.
There was something I wanted to
tell you...
Bill SNAPS his fingers, trying to remember.
WALLY
What?
BILL
Oh yeah.
Fuck you, fat ass.
They both LAUGH.
Starla, in her car with groceries, comes to a stop sign.
She looks at the telephone pole beside it and sees that
it's covered with flyers for missing pets.
Grant looks around to make sure no one's looking, as he
places the garbage bag full of meat into his trunk, closes
it.
Grant moves through the forest, in massive pain, dragging
the garbage bag.
Grant comes upon the old wooden barn.
Bill runs out into the backyard. Wally runs up behind
him. They look around at the trees surrounding the area.
Grant is nowhere to be seen.
We CRANE UP and AWAY from them as we...
FADE TO BLACK.
O.S. SNIFFLING.
PASTOR (O.S.)
Jesus, these past few days have
been a trying time for us.
Starla's high heels CLACK on the pavement as she moves
quickly to her car.
BILL (O.S.)
Starla.
Starla turns to see Bill coming after her.
She stops.
BILL
I talked to the CDC. They didn't
have nothin' on file consistent
with Grant's... symptoms.
Starla nods.
STARLA
How about Brenda?
BILL
New? No. We're hoping we find
Grant, he'll lead us to her.
Starla nods. The wind is strong. Her hair is flying
over her face. Tears come to her eyes.
BILL
You all right?
Starla nods.
STARLA
Yeah.
She moves away from him.
Bill watches her go.
POV: A dead rottweiler is lying on its back in the long
grass, its gut split open and intestines spilling out,
almost perfectly symmetrical.
41.
WALLY (O.S.)
It looks like one of them psyche
tests. What do they call it?
Bill and Wally are staring at the dog from above.
BILL
Rorschach.
WALLY
What do you see? I see a butterfly.
Bill moves on through the windswept weeds.
BILL
I see we're fucked.
Three ranches
in three days.
Margaret is taking measurements and writing in a note
pad; she sees Bill.
MARGARET
So, I think I got it part-way
figured. You want to hear it?
Bill nods.
MARGARET
So Grant -- I mean, we're saying
this is Grant, right?
Bill nods.
MARGARET
Grant kills a cow right about here.
See there's the blood, musta slit
its neck.
Margaret walks backward, showing the trail of blood in
the crushed grass.
MARGARET
So he drags the cow backwards here.
Only he prolly didn't know 'bout
the Castavets had them dogs.
TREVOR (O.S.)
Hey, look!
Bill looks over at Trevor, standing up between the tall
weeds, holding a dog's head in his hand.
TREVOR
He knocked this'n's head clear
over here!
42.
WALLY
Put that down, numbnuts!
Bill peers at the various slaughtered dogs around them.
MARGARET
So the dogs attacked, somehow he
slew 'em all, and he stole off
with the cow into the forest.
Trevor heads toward them. Bill looks off into the dark
forest on the edge of the ranch.
BILL
He's gotta be in the forest. All
three ranches run alongside it.
TREVOR
Think we should get up a search
party, head in there?
WALLY
It's a hundred thousand acres. Be
finding a needle in a fuckstack.
Bill has a realization.
He moves quickly for his car.
BILL
Wally, come on. Trevor and
Margaret, get some folks together.
I think I know where he's gonna
hit next.
The posse loads up their vehicles, and start taking off
out of the parking lot.
Bill and Wally walk out to their police car.
Bill tosses
the leather satchel into the trunk.
They get in the car, Bill starts the engine, when --
Starla Grant pulls quickly into the parking lot. Bill
rolls down the window as she gets out of her car and runs
toward them.
STARLA
Bill, I heard what you're doing.
I think I should go along.
BILL
Why? Listen, it doesn't matter.
I gotta go.
Bill starts to roll away, but Starla holds on to the car,
following.
STARLA
Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's
still out there, how will you find
her? How, unless you bring Grant
in alive? Your best chance of
doing that is with me. I can talk
to him --
BILL
He tried to kill you, Starla.
STARLA
He did. I know. But I got him
angry 'cause I wasn't calm. This
time I could --
45.
Starla's on the verge of tears.
STARLA
Please, Bill. What happened, it's
my fault, I know it.
BILL
Starla, it ain't --
STARLA
It is. He'd been acting strange.
And the physical changes. I should
have told someone right away...
But I was just blind. I wanted to
pretend it wasn't happening... If
I don't do what I can to help now,
I just couldn't live with it.
Bill looks at her.
He looks at Wally.
Wally shrugs.
Bill nods for Starla to get in.
Kylie's Dad steps onto the front porch of this quaint
family farmhouse. He sees Jack heading toward the ranch,
and waves. Jack gives a little salute, while muttering
to the Older Cop.
JACK
This turns out to be a mountain
lion we're gonna look like a damn
bunch of idiots.
The Redneck and Good Ol' Boy make their way to the ranch
as well. They see Bill with Starla.
REDNECK
Didn't know it was date night.
The Good Ol' Boy LAUGHS.
REDNECK
I'll be expecting you toss my salad
at the end of all this then,
Charlie.
GOOD OL' BOY
Shut up.
The posse fans out over this grassy land where the cattle
graze, finding places to hide. The sun sets behind them.
FADE TO:
Darkness has crept over the ranch, and the beautiful,
pastoral scene has become distinctly more sinister.
The wind blows hard, WHISTLING through the long weeds.
A rusty rooster windmill atop the old barn twists and
CLINKS on its half-bent perch.
A piece of tarp hangs down from the barn roof, FLAPPING
incessantly against the wooden wall.
Trevor and Jack; the Redneck and the Good Ol' Boy; and
Margaret and the Older Cop are hidden around the ranch,
waiting, watching or dozing.
47.
Jack smokes a cigarette as he keeps an eye out for the
cow killer. The burning ember of the cigarette is blown
off by the wind. Jack searches for it in the dry grass,
trying to catch it before it starts a fire. He crawls
forward, slapping the ground, when he glances up and
sees...
A large, shadowy shape hulking through the trees on the
edge of the forest.
Jack and Trevor watch in amazement as Grant slithers across
the field, his large, dark, watery eyes searching out
prey. Jack turns to Trevor, pissed, and whispers:
JACK
You said 'squid'!
TREVOR
It got worse.
The Redneck and the Good Ol' Boy watch too, mouths dropped.
The diseased Grant slithers through the grass just a few
feet beside Margaret and the Older Cop. They duck below
the grass, looking as if they're going to have heart
attacks.
Grant approaches a cow. The cow makes a little MOO of
protest when he gets too close, and steps back.
The Grant-creature stabs one of his tentacle growths into
the cow's neck, piercing it. The cow stumbles, choking.
Blood spurts from her neck. And she topples over.
49.
Grant wraps a feeler around the cow's horns, and starts
dragging it back in the direction of the forest.
Margaret motions to Trevor.
Trevor motions to the recruits.
And Starla moves slowly in toward Grant.
STARLA
Grant?
Grant turns and looks at her with his half-human eyes.
His breathing is loud, raspy, and sick. He sees, in a
wide circle around him, the nervous posse standing up,
their guns at the ready.
Starla moves even closer.
Bill and Wally are coming in
close behind her.
STARLA
Grant?
It's okay.
As Starla and the posse get closer, Grant looks almost
scared. His eyes dart around from cop to cop.
STARLA
You're just sick is all. But we'll
take you to get help right now.
I'll stay by your side, Grant,
just like I swore I would. For
better or worse. Remember?
50.
Grant's huge milky eyes betray that he does.
STARLA
Okay?
The posse inch in closer, tightening the circle.
Grant lets out a PIERCING SCREECH of protest.
All of the
posse stop, terrified.
Everything is quiet and still except for Grant's gross
breathing. Deep: In, out.
STARLA
Okay, Grant?
It's gonna be all
right.
Grant SCREECHES again: a warning. He looks from Starla
to Bill, with hurt, jealous eyes, and GROWLS.
Then Grant's eyes close to half-mast, and he turns away.
His tentacle tightens around the cow's horns, and he again
drags it toward the forest.
While Bill tries to decide what to do, the Good Ol' Boy
nervously blocks Grant's path. He aims his pistol at
him.
GOOD OL' BOY
You stop right there, you son of a
bitch. I don't care what kinda
leprosy you got. We need to find
that girl. Now you can make this
peaceful, or you can make it hard.
Pause.
Grant and the Good Ol' Boy stare at each other.
And then Grant SNAPS out a tentacle-arm, whipping it up
the front of the man's body, and back.
The front of the Good Ol' Boy's whole body is split neatly
in half. For a split second, he remains alive: the two
different sides of his split head look down in disbelief
as his organs spill out from inside him. And then he
topples over.
BILL
Fire!
Fire!
The posse SHOOT at Grant.
Starla covers her head.
Grant is struck; he SCREECHES in pain. He lets go of the
cow. He slithers with incredible speed off toward the
forest.
Bill and the other posse members take off after him like
hounds on the heel of their prey. They SHOOT madly.
51.
Starla watches as the posse follows Grant into the woods.
Starla stands alone and worried a moment, and then she
darts off after them.
The posse run through this very dark forest after Grant,
leaping over brush and rocks. They're nervous, but also
excited, as the primordial hunting urge takes over. Their
eyes are filled with anger and bloodlust.
They're able to follow Grant only by catching glimpses --
a flash of flesh between trees, a tentacle disappearing
around brush.
WALLY
There he is!
Over there!
They FIRE at the creature, taking chunks out of trees,
but missing. He's too fast.
Grant slips around a boulder and splashes through a creek,
and into the plentiful trees beyond. He rustles thick
fronds as he moves up alongside the creek.
The posse run up the creek itself, splashing, trying to
peer through the leaves to get a shot at Grant.
Jack, carrying his revolver, trips and falls in the creek.
He cuts his knee on a sharp rock. He stands, and keeps
going.
They come to --
The posse come up out of the creek. They've completely
lost track of the diseased man-beast.
They stop, out-of-breath and looking around.
They whisper:
52.
TREVOR
Where'd he go?
MARGARET
We ain't never gonna find that
girl now.
The Redneck is WEEPING with rage.
REDNECK
I'll kill that asshole what he did
to Charlie.
Bill sees Starla run up behind them.
He waves her back.
BILL
Starla, get the hell out of here!
Starla takes a couple steps back, but doesn't leave. She
watches there, half in shadows as the posse creep around,
searching for some trail of Grant.
Margaret looks down into the bubbling creek. She sees
it's turning red. She looks up the trail of red, which
is rippling downhill in the water. The red flow starts
somewhere near a boulder.
Bill and Wally are searching in front of the boulder.
Margaret SEES, but they don't, Grant pulling himself up
on a tree branch and RISING behind them. Blood from a
shotgun wound is dripping into the creek. Grant, pissed,
lifts a tentacle.
MARGARET
Bill!!
Bill turns as the tentacle swings down toward him. He
falls back; the tentacle slashes inches from his face.
Bill BLASTS his shotgun up at Grant, but Grant is already
slithering swiftly back into the thick brush.
The posse squeeze themselves though the brush, following.
The posse emerge on the other side of the brush, only to
be confronted by a terrible odor. They cover their noses
and mouths as their faces shrivel in disgust.
TREVOR
What the hell's that smell?
WALLY
It's something dead.
53.
The posse gaze up at the old ramshackle barn where Grant
had brought Brenda.
JACK
It's coming from in there, ain't
it?
Margaret looks at Bill.
MARGARET
Think he's inside?
Bill takes the lead, carefully approaching the barn.
The posse follows, their weapons drawn. The closer they
get to the barn, the more unbearable the smell becomes.
Only Bill, intent on the task in front of him, doesn't
react to the stench at all.
Bill leans his ear in close to the front door, and listens.
Through the door he can HEAR a QUIET SOBBING. Bill and
Wally exchange a look.
Bill steps back. He and Wally aim their shotguns at the
door. Bill nods to Margaret, and gestures for her to
open it. Starla watches all this from the rear.
Margaret swings open the door.
Trevor vomits into some bushes.
55.
Trevor sees the things flooding over the posse in the
barn. The parasites are especially drawn to the posse's
heads. Because there are so many, the weight of the beasts
knocks most of them down.
Trevor runs, but the things make it out the doorway,
covering him like lava in One Million B.C., and he buckles.
Trevor pulls his face from the dirt and stands. He spits
violently and wipes the dirt off his tongue with his wrist.
TREVOR
They wanted us to eat 'em!
Why
would they want that!?
Parasites crawl over rocks and out of the forest and onto
the ranch. The Strutemyer farmhouse looms nearby.
The parasites squirm up the side of the house, sticking
to the wood siding.
58.
THROUGH THE WINDOW we see Kylie's Mom start to close the
door.
KYLIE'S MOM
Sleep tight.
Don't let the bed
bugs bite.
Numerous parasites slither INTO FRAME, up the side of the
house, approaching the girls' bedroom window, which is
open a few inches for air.
Kylie steps onto this shingled, angled canopy over the
front porch. She turns to see the parasites slithering
out towards her. She looks down. It's probably too far
to jump, but she has no choice.
So she jumps down onto --
Kylie lands, hard, tumbling over.
She glances back at the front of the house.
THROUGH THE KITCHEN WINDOW she sees her Mom and Dad, eyes
rolled back, convulsing, spitting up blood.
More parasites are crawling towards Kylie through the
grass.
She spots her family's old Luv pickup truck on the driveway
in front of her. She breaks for it.
She throws open the front door, and jumps inside.
The things approach, crawling in after her. Kylie tries
to slam the door shut, but it won't; many things are stuck
in the door jamb.
63.
They SQUEAK in a chorus of pain, trying to wriggle toward
her.
So she SLAMS the door AGAIN, and AGAIN, and she slices
the little bastards in half.
Bill runs into the small glade, and looks around, trying
to remember which way he came from.
He gazes between some greenery, some distance away, and
spies a long-lashed deer munching on foliage. A couple
more deer and a fawn are eating as well. Bill looks at
them a moment, peaceful, perhaps a sign of some hope...
And then a parasite crawls up the deer's neck and slithers
into its mouth. Parasites crawl up the bodies and necks
of the deer behind it. The deer buck and flounce and
scratch trying to get the things off of them.
Bill runs away as fast as he can.
Trevor and Margaret carry Jack out of the barn. He's
bloated, corpse-like and covered in varicose veins.
Margaret is wearing a gag-like swatch of clothing tied
around her mouths, to protect themselves. Trevor's gag
is down around his chin so he can chatter.
TREVOR
It's got to be some Goddamn
biological weapons. Government's
testin' 'em out on us! 'Cause who
gives a shit if Wheelsy disappears,
right?!
They set down Jack and head back toward the barn.
TREVOR
I hope it ain't contagious. I'll
be pissed as hell I turn into a
big mollusk. I'll fuckin' sue, I
swear to God.
Starla, also wearing a gag, is kneeling beside Wally, who
is similarly sick and bloated. His lips are parched and
cracking.
Starla squeezes a wet cloth, dripping all the water onto
Wally's lips. Then she stands, and heads toward the creek.
66.
She doesn't see Wally open his eyes behind her. He sits
up, and stares over at Starla with milky eyes as she kneels
down beside the water.
Starla dips the swatch of clothing into the creek, re-
wetting it.
She stands, and turns, only to see Wally directly in front
of her, standing between trees, almost completely covered
in darkness.
WALLY
Hey, sugarplum.
Pause.
Starla pulls the gag from her mouth.
STARLA
What?
Wally speaks with Grant's cadence.
WALLY
Marriage. It's a sacred bond.
Just like you said.
Starla stares at him.
Wally almost looks weepy.
WALLY
I'm sorry 'bout trying to strangle
you and all. I lost -- Lost my
head. I didn't want to do none of
the things I done. Not kill them
pets. Not make Brenda a womb.
But it's my nature, ain't it? How
can you blame a one for actin'
according to his nature?
Starla, too freaked to speak, takes a step back from him.
WALLY
I wanted to tell you what was going
on. But I didn't - didn't think
you'd love me no more. I never
knew... love, Starla, I --
Trevor and Margaret are setting down the Older Cop.
They
see Wally standing. Margaret pulls down her gag.
MARGARET
Wally?
Wally turns and stares at her like some angry animal.
MARGARET
You all right?
Wally doesn't answer.
67.
MARGARET
Maybe you better sit back down.
You don't look so good.
TREVOR
Margaret.
Trevor's staring at something. Margaret follows his eye
line. Jack and the Older Cop are sitting up, staring at
her, just like Wally.
The Redneck stumbles into the barn doorway, also staring
at them.
Kylie is still alone in the Luv truck. The windows are
clear; the parasites have abandoned their quest, just as
they did with the posse in the barn. But Kylie stays in
the car, trembling, afraid to leave.
She HEARS a DOOR OPEN. She sees her parents and her
sisters come stumbling out the front door of her home.
They're also bloated and diseased. Their chins and shirts
are stained with the blood they spit up.
KYLIE'S DAD
Kylie, honey, you okay? Come on
out.
Her family lumbers up to the truck. They peer in with
their milky eyes. Her youngest sister pushes her face up
close to the window.
KYLIE'S SISTER 2
Hi, Kylie.
It's me.
Her family tries the door handles, but they're locked.
KYLIE'S MOM
Open the door, sweetie. I know we
don't look so good, but your mommy
and daddy love you.
KYLIE
Get away!!
KYLIE'S MOM
Now, Kylie, there's no excuse why
not to be with your family. This
is family fun day, isn't it?
They continue RATTLING the door handles, over and over.
They SLAP the windows.
Kylie SOBS.
Her sister speaks in a singsongy voice:
68.
KYLIE'S SISTER 1
Kyyy-leee, this is your last cha-
ance.
Her Dad leans over and picks up a large rock. He carries
it toward the truck. He holds it up over the windshield.
Kylie SCREAMS as he SMASHES it down. The windshield
CRACKS, but doesn't shatter. He holds it up again.
Bill, out of breath, runs out of the forest --
Bill emerges on the edge of the ranch, stretching five or
six acres out in front of him. On the other side of the
field is the gravel road, where his police car is parked.
Beside the field is the Strutemyer's farmhouse.
Bill HEARS a CRASH. He turns to see the diseased
Strutemyers in their driveway, all holding rocks now,
smashing the pickup's windows.
BILL
Hey!
The Strutemyers stop, mid-swing.
They turn toward him.
Kylie sees Bill through the rear windshield.
She unlocks
the door, and jumps out of the car.
BILL
What's -- ?
Kylie runs past her family and up to Bill.
She grabs
onto him, and hides behind him, WEEPING.
BILL
What's going on here?
Kylie's Dad's cadence is also like Grant's:
KYLIE'S DAD
Well, hello there, Pardy.
BILL
What happened to you, Dwight?
Kylie's Dad looks down at his own bloated arm.
KYLIE'S DAD
Poison ivy out back, maybe?
69.
KYLIE'S SISTERS
We're itchy!
Kylie is obviously in shock.
KYLIE
They're not my... They killed...
BILL
Okay. Y'all just wait in this
spot. I'm gonna call the paramedics
for you. Kylie can come with --
RANCHER (O.S.)
Hey there, killer.
Bill turns to see the RANCHER with the cleft palate, now
diseased, holding a shovel. He swings it into Bill,
knocking him down.
Kylie SCREAMS. Her family runs in toward them. She looks
around to see a couple more DISEASED RANCHERS rushing
toward them through the fields.
The Cleft Palate Rancher stands over Bill and raises the
shovel to bring it down again.
Bill feels for his shotgun, which has fallen into the
dirt beside him. He yanks the trigger.
The BLAST hits the Rancher in the foot.
He buckles.
Bill stands, pulling Kylie with him as the other diseased
folks rush toward them through the fields.
BILL
Come on.
Bill and Kylie dash toward the cluster of cars as the
diseased chase them.
The infected posse -- Wally, Jack, the Older Cop, and the
Redneck recruit -- are all coming in towards Trevor and
Margaret.
MARGARET
Now, what'd I say?! Y'all just
sit down! You need to get some
Goddamn rest! You're sick!
Starla watches this, by herself, next to the creek.
She
eyes a rifle in the dirt.
70.
Jack grabs a fistful of Trevor's hair and restrains his
arms. Wally pulls his pistols from their holsters and
tosses them into the dirt.
TREVOR
Let go!!
Margaret goes to grab her pistol, when the Redneck opens
his mouth wide and --
GLEEKS; that is, he sends a yellowish globby-stream
shooting out of the back of his throat. The glob SPLASHES
on Margaret's hand. Margaret SCREAMS, drops the pistol.
MARGARET
It burns!!
Margaret looks at her hand as the gleek-liquid sinks into
her skin. The hand is swelling monstrously. It's soft.
Parts of it are nearly dripping off the bone.
MARGARET
What'd you do to my fuckin' hand?!
Jack opens his mouth and GLEEKS too -- shooting the stream-
glob forward and onto her neck. Margaret SCREAMS again,
grabbing onto her neck.
Margaret tries to speak, but she struggles just to breathe,
as her neck puffs up, impeding her thorax.
OLDER COP
Meat.
The Older Cop buries his fingers into her neck. The puffy
flesh comes off easily; it's soft, almost creamy. He
stuffs the flesh into his mouth, eating it.
As Margaret topples over, dying, the other posse members
turn to look at a very freaked-out Trevor. The Redneck
opens his mouth at him, when --
STARLA (O.S.)
Let him go!
The posse turn and see Starla, who has made her way over
to where the rifle was on the ground, and is now pointing
the rifle at the posse, trembling.
STARLA
Trevor, come on.
Surprised, they release Trevor.
STARLA
What'd you do to her?!
71.
Jack stares at Starla.
He too speaks with Grant's cadence.
JACK
There you go, sugarplum! Why you
choosing camps 'fore you hear --
JACK
REDNECK
Both sides of the story!?
Both sides of the story!?
STARLA
Why are you talking like Grant?!
The posse moves toward her. Starla is CRYING. The posse
makes a COLLECTIVE SCREECHING sound, then speaks again:
WALLY
'Cause I am Grant!
WALLY
REDNECK
I'm you husband --
I'm you husband, Goddammit --
JACK
You swore to honor and obey --
OLDER COP
REDNECK
Obey me --
Obey me, so put that Goddamn
gun down.
STARLA
Don't come any closer.
I'll...
shoot.
WALLY
You ain't gonna shoot me! You
always needed me to protect you!
You for damn sure ain't got the
balls to --
Starla BLASTS Wally, blowing open a big crater into his
face.
Wally falls to his knees.
Starla and Trevor look on in
shock, as they see...
A slithering parasite squirming out of the crater on his
face -- out of the Wally's brain.
The little thing squirms down Wally's body and slithers
off quickly into the woods. Wally falls over, dead.
The sick posse look at Starla, surprised, infuriated.
And then they leap at her.
Starla tries to shoot them.
But she's out of ammo.
72.
She and Trevor turn and dash away as quickly as their
legs can take them.
Trevor and Starla run in a zigzag pattern through trees
rooted closely together, panicked, breathing heavy.
TREVOR
Oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit!
Bill and Kylie arrive at his police car. Bill throws the
door open, and shoves Kylie inside. As he starts to get
in, he turns to see the two little girls closing in.
One opens her mouth and GLEEKS -- it shoots out and lands
on the car right beside Bill's hand.
The other little girl opens her mouth to GLEEK as Bill
jumps into the driver's seat. He slams the door shut
just as the oozy liquid splashes on the window beside
him.
Bill is grossed-out by this, but he doesn't have much
time. He goes to reload his shotgun, when he remembers.
BILL
Shit.
Ammo's in the trunk.
He grabs the police radio.
BILL
Trevor!
Margaret!
Trevor turns and sees Jack, the Redneck, and the Older
Cop leap powerfully over the brush behind them, coming in
fast. But he's able to grab onto his radio.
TREVOR
They killed Margaret!
Kylie's two sisters jump onto the hood, SCREECHING.
They
SLAM rocks on the windshield. Kylie SCREAMS.
BILL
(into radio)
Where are you?!
73.
TREVOR (O.S.)
We're coming your way, man!
Bill JAMS the car forward, knocking the sisters off the
hood. Then he slams on the brakes.
He looks back and sees the two little girls running toward
the car again.
And he sees the mass of diseased ranch families also
running toward the car. Kylie is SCREAMING and CRYING.
KYLIE
Go!
Go!
Please!
But, instead, of pulling forward on the gravel road, Bill
turns up and onto the ranch itself -- back towards the
running diseased.
BILL
My friends are still in the forest.
Bill speeds the police car over the dirt field, trying to
avoid approaching ranchers. Some leap at the car, holding
on and getting tossed aside. Bill zooms back toward the
trees.
Just as Bill gets a little headway on the diseased, the
car gets stuck in some mud. The wheels spin, spraying
mud, as the infected approach.
The infected arrive at the car. Bill just lets his foot
off the gas, and sits there, letting the ranchers leap
onto the car. Kylie looks at Bill, panicked by his choice
to do nothing.
BILL
We need their weight.
Bill slams down the gas again, and the car zooms forward.
The diseased get knocked off.
BILL
Dumbshits.
Bill rushes toward the trees of the forest.
74.
The police car pulls up and out of the forest. The car
is in bad shape. Steam rises from the smashed grill.
Bill looks to his side; he's down a bit from the
Strutemyers' ranch. He pulls away, heading back toward
town.
The foursome sit in a stupefied daze. Starla's beside
Bill. Trevor and Kylie are in the back. Bill grabs the
police radio.
BILL
Shelby?
75.
Nothing. STATIC.
Everyone notes this, worried.
Bill
tries again:
BILL
Shelby, you there?
For a moment, there's nothing.
And then:
SHELBY (O.S.)
Yo, Chief.
How y'all doin'?
Bill and Starla look at each other, relieved.
Bill, Starla, Kylie, and Trevor step slowly out of the
car. They look around the deserted road.
79.
The wide-open night is shrouded in darkness. Quiet.
They can see the lights of Wheelsy down the road in front
of them.
Bill speaks into the radio again, as he gets his leather
satchel of weaponry out of the trunk. Trevor grabs ammo
from the satchel to reload his pistol.
BILL
Shelby, we broke down on 22, a
mile outside town. Come pick us
up.
SHELBY (O.S.)
I got to leave my post.
BILL
Do it.
MOMENTS LATER
The foursome walks down the road, toward the city.
Starla
and Bill are in the lead.
BILL
Hey, Starla.
She looks at him.
BILL
Was always curious why you...
married Grant in the first place...
Just never seemed outta love.
STARLA
I know what people say, Bill.
I... Remember, back in high school
I worked at my father's gas station?
Bill nods.
STARLA
Grant used to get filled up every
day. I knew it was just to see
me. He was too old -- But he was
handsome. And he had that big ol'
Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
BILL
Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess
I would have flirted with him too.
Starla smiles, thinks.
80.
STARLA
My father, he was -- he was real
close to evil. People didn't know.
Still don't. From the time I was
a toddler he'd beat the hell out
of me. I don't mean just like a
smack for smart-mouthing... he
took a real enjoyment in it. And
when I turned eleven or twelve,
things... well, they got worse.
Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
BILL
When you wanted to run away, I
called your dad.
STARLA
That wasn't a good night, no.
BILL
I'm sorry.
Starla shrugs it off.
STARLA
Anyway, Grant rolls in one day. I
fill his tank with like an eighth-
a-gallon as usual. And he notices
my lip's all swollen up, and starts
asking me how it happened. I don't
know why I chose then, why Grant --
I guess I saw an opportunity. And
I told him everything, first time
I told anyone. Grant was furious.
He picked up a tire iron, walked
straightaway into the garage, and
beat my father half to death. You
say it's not about love, Bill.
But that was the closest thing to
it I ever knew.
Pause.
STARLA
Grant asked me to marry him a few
weeks later. I felt... safe with
him.
Bill nods.
Starla looks at him, smiles.
STARLA
After all this shit tonight, I
know for sure now you regret not
running off with me to Hollywood!
81.
BILL
Hell, Starla.
I always regretted
that.
Starla looks at him, moved.
Trevor looks at Kylie, shivering and terrified.
TREVOR
Don't worry, kid. Pretty soon,
we'll be in town, everything'll be
fine.
A slithering parasite squirms over a paint-chipped sign
that reads "WELCOME TO WHEELSY, SOUTH CAROLINA, THE WHEELS
OF THE FUTURE," featuring early-'sixties graphics of a
utopian future.
THE CAMERA MOVES DOWN to the road, where hundreds of
slithering parasites squirm into the city. They divide
off in thin lines heading toward the various homes.
We MOVE UP TO a WINDOW on a SMALL HOUSE, through which we
can see an OVERWEIGHT WOMAN in spasms with a slithering
thing in her mouth.
We PAN TO the WINDOW of the HOME NEXT DOOR, where we can
see a FAMILY gathered around a CORPSE, feasting on his
goopy flesh.
STARLA
What's that?
Our foursome look up to see a Buick Century parked at a
haphazard angle in the middle of the road. The driver's
side door is open. The headlights are still on.
They look at each other. Bill takes his flashlight off
his belt and aims it in front of him. They all slowly
approach the car, in the darkness.
Bill aims his flashlight into the Buick.
The keys are
still there, but no one's inside.
Trevor looks at the grill of the car.
It's dented.
TREVOR
They musta hit a deer. Probably
got out to see if it's okay.
Bill and the others look around.
82.
Bill hears a LAPPING sound behind him.
He turns, aiming
the flashlight downward.
A DISEASED DEER is lapping a thick purple tongue on the
wound of a dead man. The sick creature is mostly hairless
and pink and covered in veins. Bulbous black eyes hang
on the sides of its head like a goldfish's.
The diseased deer glances up at Bill and GROWLS a low
growl.
BILL
Fuck me.
The deer springs upward, bringing his hoofs into Bill's
chest. Bill is knocked violently to the gravel, dropping
his shotgun and satchel. The deer rears back and brings
his hoofs down into Bill again. They CRACK Bill's head
against the hard road.
Kylie, Trevor, and Starla see diseased deer coming in at
them from different directions. The deer SCREECH like
dying rabbits.
TREVOR
Bambi-rats!
Trevor aims his pistol at a DEER jumping toward him. He
SHOOTS, misses. The deer knocks him down. The deer stomps
his feet, rearing up and down on Trevor's ribs, almost
like a little dance. The deer tears at Trevor's sleeve
with decidedly carnivorous teeth, forcing him into letting
go of his gun.
Kylie SCREAMS. She dives into a small space beneath a
rock overhang on the side of the road. She watches what's
going on from there.
Starla sees the Buick a few yards away. She glances beside
her to see the largest diseased deer of all, a HORNED
BUCK, careening toward her.
She dashes toward the Buick as fast as she can.
A TUMOROUS DOE leaps onto Bill, biting into his shoulder
and tearing at his flesh, so now he has two deer on him.
Bill is bleeding, dizzy, and disoriented, but he's able
to turn, just a bit, to see the barrel of his shotgun
above him. He tries to scoot himself back as he's being
battered. He reaches up for the shotgun; but the tips of
his fingers barely graze the muzzle.
Starla arrives at the Buick, and starts to crawl into the
front seat.
But the horned buck is upon her.
He bites into Starla's
ankle. She SCREAMS.
83.
He yanks back on her, half pulling her onto the road.
But Starla grabs onto the steering wheel with all her
might, and pulls against the horned buck's massive power.
The deer on Trevor starts pulling him off, dragging him
down the road as he HOLLERS.
Kylie, underneath the rock overhang, watches Bill try to
scoot himself back and reach for the shotgun. It's just
a little too far away. She works up her nerve and slowly
starts to crawl out toward him.
As Starla is stretched between the horned buck pulling on
her ankle, and her hand on the steering wheel, she's able
to flip on her side and turn the keys in the ignition;
the ENGINE STARTS. She reaches one hand down to the
floorboard, pressing on the gas.
The Buick lurches forward, wrenching her away from the
horned buck's mouth.
Bill reaches again for the barrel of his rifle. It's too
far away. But then he sees Kylie, at the butt of the
rifle. She reaches out and pushes it just a little, into
Bill's hand. Bill grips the muzzle like a baseball bat,
and swings it into the face of the deer jumping on him,
knocking the beast back.
The deer tries to stumble forward again, but its whole
head and neck have been knocked askew. It topples over,
dead.
Bill flips the shotgun forward into his hands. He stuffs
the muzzle into the tumorous doe biting into his leg.
The deer looks at him. Blood is running down Bill's face
and he looks half-crazed. Bill glances down and sees the
telephone wire wrapped around her ankle.
Bill pulls the trigger, destroying her.
He stands, looking around for the deer with Trevor. It
has dragged him a fair distance down the street. Bill
SHOOTS once, missing it, and again, hitting it straight
on.
Kylie looks around to see more diseased deer running
through the fields toward them.
Starla pulls herself into the driver's seat and backs up
alongside her friends. Throws open the passenger door.
STARLA
Get in!
84.
Shelby, sick and bloated, speaks into his radio, as he
moves down the street with a hoard of the infected.
SHELBY
Already on our way.
BACK TO BUICK
Kylie turns her head, and glances out the window.
And
SCREAMS. Starla, Bill, and Trevor turn to see --
An SUV barreling straight towards them.
It SLAMS hard into the side of the Buick.
And SMASHES the car back, across a short lot, and through
the glass storefront of a flower store.
The diseased townsfolk surround the little store on all
sides. They SCREECH.
86.
The diseased townsfolk WAIL and SLAP their hands on the
walls, almost rhythmically, like some tribal ritual.
Some push on the doors.
The FACE-SAWED MAN backs away from the hole, clutching
his bleeding eye.
The diseased townsfolk have all gathered on one side of
the building now, putting all their efforts into tearing
down one door. Some have even climbed onto the roof above
it, curling off the gutter and roofing overhead.
Bill follows her. Two DISEASED PEOPLE appear, SCREECHING
and running toward them. Bill SHOOTS them both. And he
makes a break for it, running as fast as he can across
the street.
He turns, expecting to see Starla right behind him. But
she has stayed behind, staring quietly at the ground.
Starla has tears in her eyes. She motions with her head
for Bill to go. Bill is confused.
The diseased townsfolk come up around Starla from the
sides of the flower store, no one paying attention to
Bill. They encircle her, slowly. Some SCREECH angrily
at her. She's too disgusted or fearful to even look in
their eyes. They BREATHE with SICK, RASPY breath.
DISEASED WOMAN
DISEASED KID
Starlaaaaaaa!
Starlaaaa!
And they WAIL, in a cacophony of simultaneous voices, all
the deep angers, fears, frustrations, and jealousies they
inherited from Grant Grant, such as:
SMASHED-FACE MAN
You said for better or worse! You
lied!
NO LONGER PRETTY
BRENDA'S HUSBAND
I gave you everything!
I.
Loved. You!
89.
SHELBY
FAT SICK GUY
It's not just about lesson
I wanted you by my side,
plans! Hank Wilcox wants
sugarplum. But I'm too
your pussy!
ugly now, huh!!?
MR. INAPPROPRIATE
WAITRESS
Your daddy'd still be
You always thought I was a
fucking your every hole
joke, ain't you?
weren't it for me!!
BRENDA'S HUSBAND
You like Pardy better'n me? That's
who you want to screw now?!
STARLA
Grant... Please...
They surround her. They touch her body, her ass, her
breasts. Pull on her clothes. She trembles.
STARLA
I'm sorry... I know I haven't
behaved how you -- how you want.
I know. Don't... hurt... me.
Starla glances down to see a diseased dog licking her
calf, tasting her.
STARLA
We need... to... talk.
A DISEASED MAN grabs the side of her neck and face.
DISEASED MAN
BRENDA'S HUSBAND
Then talk.
Then talk.
STARLA
Not here, though, okay? Not all
of you. I'm not used to -- I want
to talk to your face, Grant. Your
more real face. Your --
The diseased townsfolk grab Starla, enveloping her, and
start dragging her away.
A few townsfolk remain behind.
They look around for Bill.
SMASHED-FACE MAN
Pardy?!!
Where are you, Pardy!!
But he's nowhere to be seen.
They SCREECH angrily.
Bill runs as fast as he can across the street here -- the
same direction the hoard took Starla, but down a block.
90.
Bill falls against the side of this building, hiding in a
dark crevice. Down the way, he can see numerous dead
bodies, and a WOMAN chased down and tackled by some
infected townsfolk.
Some diseased townsfolk wander by Bill, looking for him.
Bill crouches down so he isn't seen.
DISEASED WOMAN
SHELBY
Pardy.
Pardy. Pardy.
Come on out, Pardy.
PASTOR
We've surrounded the town, you
prick! Ain't no way outta here!
Bill waits for them to pass. When they're gone, Bill
looks up toward the next street -- he can see the hoard
moving Starla across that street.
He makes sure no one's looking, and follows her.
One of the diseased pushes Starla too hard, and she falls
to her hands and knees. They keep pushing her. She
stumbles back to her feet and moves on. She's almost
hyperventilating.
Here, the Diseased Townsfolk around Starla stop. She
looks up to see that they've led her onto her own front
yard. Starla gazes up at her home:
The diseased have done a little remodeling. Part of the
front wall has been torn away, replaced with some primitive
thatched woodwork. The front doorway has also been
partially destroyed. Because of the sloppy reconstruction,
the roof is caved-in and sloping.
Diseased people sit in meerkat-like poses on all sides of
the Grants' home, watching out for trouble.
Bill, out of breath, arrives across the street. He can
see Starla standing with the diseased. He hides behind
some shrubs.
91.
The diseased push Starla up between them, violently, to
the front door.
Starla stops at the dark hole on the front of the house.
It's pitch black inside. She looks back at the rotting
faces behind her. And then slowly enters.
Bill looks at the diseased surrounding the Grant home.
They seem impossible to get through.
Bill eyes the house next door, maybe twenty-five feet
from the Grants'. He makes sure no one's paying attention
for a moment, and he darts across the street to a parked
car. The diseased don't see him. Bill gazes down the
street beside him.
The sun is just barely beginning to rise.
They don't
have much time to move in the darkness.
Bill makes a break for the house next door.
Bill has made his way into the backyard. He looks over
at the Grant home. Some diseased townsfolk in the backyard
could conceivably see or hear him. He tries the back
door, but it's locked.
Bill notices a window slightly open.
He starts to push
it up. It SQUEAKS LOUDLY.
He peers over at the diseased. They don't hear. He throws
the window up further, and crawls inside the home.
Bill raises his shotgun and BLASTS as Starla jumps away
from the window.
The diseased townsfolk enter the kid's bedroom, rushing
toward Bill on the balcony. But Bill won't stop. He
BLASTS the shotgun again.
Bill is out of shells. He drops his shotgun. He grabs
the grenade out of the pocket on the black leather bag.
The diseased GLEEK at Bill, but Bill throws himself
forward, letting himself fall through the flimsy balustrade --
97.
Bill lands hard on the lawn between the two homes. He
grabs a .38, and stands beside the window on Grant's house.
Through the window he sees Grant barreling down the stairs.
Bill SHOOTS Grant with the .38, SHATTERING the glass.
He UNLOADS the clip into him.
The diseased townsfolk surround Bill, grabbing him. Grant,
using the others' eyes to see, snaps his tentacle forward,
wrapping it around Bill's neck, raising him up. Grant
SCREECHES.
Grant's exploding flesh sends Bill flying backwards.
Around the house, the diseased's eyes gaze lifelessly
upward as they each plummet to the grass.
FADE TO:
Bill unwraps what's left of the tentacle from his bruised
neck, and looks around at the dead diseased. Grant's
splattered flesh is around him.
98.
Bill hears a quiet RATTLING sound. He looks around him.
And then sees, down at his feet, what is actually a
distorted piece of Grant's cerebellum. Sticking out of a
new organic slit in the cerebellum is the quill-like spore.
It quivers and trembles upward, its little bulbed spurs
popping out.
Starla comes around the side of the house, holding a paper
towel roll to the slice on her ribs. She sees Bill
standing there. She smiles.
STARLA
Hey.
Bill smiles too.
BILL
Hey.
Bill and Starla hobble down the town center. The leather
bag is slung over Bill's shoulder. Everything around
them is dead: the victims who were being feasted on, as
well as the various diseased. The torture is over, but
no life remains.
Bill finds an abandoned Nissan Maxima in the middle of
the street, with the keys still in it.
BILL
Starla, over here.
In the Maxima now, Bill and Starla pull around a toppled
ambulance and through a spouting fire hydrant, and out
onto --
99.
The sun is bright and beautiful, glistening on the car.
Bill and Starla breathe more easily and smile a little as
they head up this long, barren road outside the city.
Bill and Starla pass through a small block of stores.
Starla gazes out the window to see people -- real, actual,
HEALTHY HUMAN BEINGS: men and women and children -- going
about their daily chores. Tears come to her eyes.
Bill grabs Starla's hand.
She clenches his tightly.
STARLA
We can probably get some first aid
and food at this gas station up
here.
BILL
Yeah.
Good.
The Maxima pulls into the station, and stops.
A stunned Starla steps with Bill out of the station, moving
toward the car.
100.
Starla stops.
STARLA
Shit. I- I forgot... I wanted to
get aspirin.
She starts to move back inside.
Bill stops her.
BILL
I'll get it for you.
Ibuprofen or
aspirin?
STARLA
Aspirin.
Bill smiles, and goes back inside. Starla moves quickly
with the bag of stuff toward the car.
Bill walks out; the Maxima is still there.
As the Maxima sits in the lot, ANOTHER GUNSHOT CRACKS
OUT. Then we hear the HORN BLARING.
The car door flips open.
The horn stops blaring.
And Bill's body is kicked out of the car, sliding onto
the pavement.
