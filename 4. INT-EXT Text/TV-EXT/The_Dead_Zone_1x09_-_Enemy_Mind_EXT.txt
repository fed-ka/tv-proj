          A desolate, industrial area of Portland and we may see a
          sign that says the word 'Portland' on one of the several
          old warehouses.  Not a soul in sight.  A squad car rolls
          into the frame.  JOHNNY, WALT and a Portland cop, OFFICER
          KOHLAN (20's) get out.  This young cop is still excited
          about just "being" a cop, a rather "gung ho" type. 

                                        OFFICER KOHLAN
                        You're sure she's in there?  You
                        get some kind of tip?

          Walt glances at Johnny who, we understand, must have had
          a vision before we faded in...

                                        JOHNNY
                          A "tip".  Yeah.  In a manner of
                          speaking.

          The cop nods, not surprised, as they move toward the
            warehouse...

                                        OFFICER KOHLAN
                          Runaways always find their way to
                        this part of the city.  The
                          abandoned warehouses are easy to
                        break into.    

          The trio enter the warehouse...







          where we MATCH CUT with a 6-year-old Jill turning around,
          responding to A CHILD'S HAND grabbing her shoulder.  Jill
          is wearing a Halloween costume -- Tinker Bell from "Peter
          Pan," complete with wings and a magic wand/pinwheel.  We
          hear sounds of a children's Halloween party near-by...

                                        BOY'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Boo!

          Jill SCREAMS, frightened, and runs away into the dense
          October woods.  WIDEN TO REVEAL BOY#1 (8) dressed in a
          scary Halloween costume.  FINDING JOHNNY standing off to
          the side, a passive observer.

                        Jill, come back!  You'll get lost.

          The boy runs after her, disappears into the trees.  The
          vision ends... and we...

  88RESUME JOHNNY

          as he puts the picture down... his eye is caught by another
          photo, partially hidden among the various frames... and
          he sees an older Jill posing with some friends... one of
          them is the girl Johnny saw with her at the warehouse...

                                        MRS. DERR
                                (to phone)
                        You must have patrols... how can
                        a city like Portland allow kids
                        to... to... live in conditions
                        like that.  I really can't imagine
                        what would take priority over...
                                  (frustrated)
                        Yes, fine... I'll call you later,
                          Sergeant...

          She hangs up, stands there for a beat and gathers
          herself... wipes a tear from her cheek... she glances
          over at Johnny... lets out a helpless sigh that says  
          much about her life.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mrs. Derr... do you know the girl
                        with the blonde hair in this
                          photo...?

          Mrs. Derr moves over.  The second photo was shot a year
          or so ago and the girls are not as far into the rave
          culture yet but there's no doubt it's the same girl.

                                        MRS. DERR
                                (nods)
                        Tammy.  Tammy Moe.  That's not
                        how she looks now.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know.  I saw her in Portland
                        with Jill.

                                (sighs)
                        I might have known.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Did they run away together?

                                        MRS. DERR
                                (getting angry)
                        Tammy doesn't have to run away. 
                        Tammy's mother... she lets her
                        stay out at all hours of the night,
                        I can't even begin to talk to the
                          woman...

          She stops herself as though getting angry is not allowed
          in this house; she sighs... sits...

                                        MRS. DERR
                        I have no right to criticize.  I
                        haven't been the world's best
                        mother, Mr. Smith.  Sometimes I
                        haven't been a mother at all.  In 
                        my own loneliness, I leaned on
                        her too much, asked too much of
                        her.  It wasn't fair.  There are
                        so many things I regret...

          She studies a Chinese cork sculpture of a tiny village on
          a hill on a coffee table... a pleasant memory crosses her
          face...

                                        MRS. DERR
                        Jill always loved our little
                        Chinese village... I'd come into
                        the room and find her staring at
                        it... hypnotized almost... god
                        knows what she saw in there...
                        have I already told you this?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (smile, gently, just
                                being there for her)
                        Yes, ma'am.

          The phone rings again...

                                        MRS. DERR
                        I'm sorry; it doesn't stop ringing. 
                        And every time it rings... I pray
                        to God it's her.

          She takes a beat and answers the phone...

                        Tammy's address is 14290 Roblar

                        I'll bet she slept in her own bed
                        last night.


          POV

          DIGITAL CAMERA moving down streets and narrow alleys,
          turning, twisting, finally it finds a six-year-old Jill
          as Tinker Bell standing incongruously looking down by a
            dumpster, where two legs of body can be seen; she looks
          at our approach... as we reach a close-up... suddenly a
          large hand with a Cougar tattoo covers her mouth as someone
          grabs her from behind and on her shock... and ours...


  1111RESUME JOHNNY

          As Tammy finally breaks Johnny's grip... and she's shaken
          by the experience...

                        Get this pervert away from me! 
                        Mom??!

          The strange vision lingers with Johnny.  Tammy moves to
          her mother in the outer office.  Walt follows to the door,
          looks to the deputy:

                        Book her on possession.  Call the
                        designated court worker.

          Johnny's face registers his reaction to the strange vision
          he saw.  Walt looks at him with concern.

                                        WALT

                        see it's a Cougar.

                        I'll call that into the Portland
                        police.  Maybe someone with that

          on the edge of the woods with her and the little girl is
          very much aware of him - interactive in a way we never

          begins to pulse, to rustle rhythmically.  As the techno
          music from the rave slowly enters this vision, MORE trees
          start moving.  

          Like an ominous heartbeat, they pulse in rhythm to the
          music.


          OVERLAY AN ALTERED SHOT OF...

          the kids in the rave, stretched thin like the trees, and
          lit in a strange brownish light... This is NOT a literal
          morph, but they appear to emerge directly out of the trees --
          they have gray, bark-like bodies...

          Ultimately, this distorted/fused image goes beyond either
          of its two origins, i.e., the rave and the October woods. 
          Lit by this strange brownish light, the dancing kids could
          also be trapped souls writhing in the sulfurous fires of
          hell, the trees could be that infamous lake of fire's

                        John, I've said it before, I'll
                        say it again: there's only so
                        much you can do.  And you've
                          obviously reached the limit.  Get
                        in the car.

          Bruce takes his keys out of his pocket...

                        Look, just give me a few hours...

                        John, get in the car.  

          Bruce grabs Johnny's arm and when he does --          THE DEAD ZONE: ENEMY MIND - ACT TWO - 05/27/02 - GOLD  21.



          as he surprises Bruce, grabbing the keys out of his hand
          and shoving him hard with his elbow into some garbage
          cans... Bruce falls over the cans as Johnny jumps into
          the PT Cruiser, starts the engine and drives away as Bruce
          stumbles to his feet, chases the car but too late...

                        Sarah, he's in bad shape.  We've

          are more disjointed, trippier.  Think: "Run Lola Run.")

          6-year-Jill is "sparing for change," panhandling in a
          seedy part of town.  A man gives her a coin.  Behind her,

          and "Truckers welcome".

          True to the vision, Jill - the teenage version - is there
          sparing for change.  She hasn't slept.  Pedestrians on
          their way to work mostly ignore her.

                        I just want to talk.

          She studies him.  And she has an attitude.  But hunger
          dictates her approach to this guy.  At least there may be
          a free meal ticket here.  If a conversation is the price
          of a meal, so be it.

                                        JILL
                        Okay.  I get a breakfast burrito.

          She studies him a beat, decides the meal is worth the
          risk and promptly ups the ante...

                        I'll even throw in some hash
                        browns.

          As they move toward the diner, Johnny's eye is caught by
          a stray alley cat toying with a dead mouse... the cat
          freezes as it sees Johnny as though afraid Johnny will
          take his catch... and Jill touches the door as she
            enters... RAMP TO JOHNNY'S FACE... as he suddenly finds

  4242RESUME ROSIE'S DINER - INTERIOR

          Johnny has been holding the door for an extra beat.  The
          stray cat takes his mouse and runs down the alley.  Johnny
          nods uncomfortably.  Enters the diner with Jill.



          By the dumpster where Johnny saw Tinker Bell in his
            vision... Malcolm slams Scott up against the wall... holds
          a blade against his neck...

                        Okay, Scott.  I'll talk to Jill.

                        Go?  Maybe you didn't understand
                        me.  You had twelve seconds.
                        They're up.  

          He removes the blade from his throat and off camera buries
          it deep into Scott's gut... Scott's eyes show the shock
          of the impact...



          As Malcolm walks toward the diner's entrance, the
          Bannerman's SUV pulls to the curb... Bruce, Sarah and
          Walt (in civvies, not in uniform) get out... Bruce moves

          He leads the way into the diner...



          Johnny is making his way down the street as quickly as he
          can, moving well even though he still uses his cane. 
          Jill goes with him, carrying the big bag of food for

          Suddenly the sound of an old truck...


          P.O.V. - THE END OF THE ALLEY

          The old truck turns... its wide body almost filling the
          space between the buildings... at the wheel, the silhouette
          of Malcolm...



          Walt, Bruce and Sarah listening to the motorist describe
          the accident he almost had...

                                        DRIVER
                        All I can tell you is that he ran
                        out into traffic like he was blind
                        or something, like he didn't even
                        see us...  

                                        SARAH
                        Did you see where he went?

                                        DRIVER
                        He took off after a girl... down
                        that alley... toward the old
                          warehouses...



          Walt, Bruce and Sarah move down the alley... Sarah spots
          a pair of legs sticking out from behind the dumpster...

                                        SARAH
                        Oh no... Oh no...

          Thinking it's Johnny, she runs down the alley... Bruce
          and Walt are right behind her...


          ANGLE - AS SARAH ARRIVES

          reacts with a mixture of horror and relief as she sees
          it's not Johnny...

                                        WALT
                        It's the kid we saw with Jill the
                        other day.
                                (to Sarah)
                        I don't want you to see this.

                                        SARAH
                                (shaken)
                        It's a little late for that, isn't
                        it?

          Walt is already dialing his cell.  

                                        WALT
                                (to cell phone)

          As he waits... to Bruce and Sarah --

                        Club drugs are big business down
                        here.  Most of the major dealers
                        are mobbed up.  Not a good field
                        for the young entrepreneur.  
                                (to phone)
                        Yeah.  Officer Kohlan, Walt
                        Bannerman.  I've just found a
                        body, male, Caucasian, early
                          twenties.  Remember Mister
                          Science...?  Uh huh.  An alley in
                        the warehouse district...            THE DEAD ZONE: ENEMY MIND - ACT FOUR - 05/17/02 - BLUE  40.



          as the Cougar looks over and sees Johnny and the teenage
          Jill in matching positions to the industrial plant... 

                                        JOHNNY

                                (gentle voice)
                        He's more scared of us than we
                        are of him...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not so sure.

                                        JILL
                        I am.  Trust me.  We'll just stand
                        here as he passes by.

          And indeed he moves out of view into the woods... Johnny
          relaxes. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's gone.  You were right.

          Matching Johnny and Jill...

                        You're good at this.

                                        JILL
                        You've never done drugs before...?

                        Well, a long time ago, once.  But
                          I didn't inhale.

          Looking ahead to a light from outdoors...

                        It's not that far now...

          But as she says it, the hand with the Cougar tattoo spears
          out from out of the darkness grabs her around the mouth
          as in Johnny's early vision... she's pulled away from
            Johnny... and as he reacts...

          But she's gone... he pushes through the trees, desperately
          trying to find her...


          WIDER - JOHNNY ALONE IN THE WOODS



          Officer Kohlan has joined Sarah, Walt and Bruce... they
          have found the abandoned Dodge truck...

                                (mind working)
                        I know this truck... this truck
                        belongs to a local hood... what's
                        it doing out here?

          Her eyes narrow as she looks around; she unstraps her
          gun...

          as Malcolm glances out from a crack in the wall and sees
          the four people around his truck... as the cop looks this
          way, he ducks out of sight and, still holding the girl,
          retreats back into the darkness of the industrial plant...



          tries to see something, anything beyond the woods...
            moving... he hears rolling thunder and looks up to see

          DARK CLOUDS ROLLING IN INCREDIBLY FAST IN THE SKY 


          JOHNNY

          pushes through the woods... but as lightning strikes,
          some trees catch fire - unusual bright white fire... Johnny
          runs from the flames which seem to take on a life of their
          own... like we saw earlier, the trapped souls writhing in
          the sulfurous fires of hell, the trees could be that
          infamous lake of fire's flames... fiery plasma arcs
          reaching to grab him... as he reacts to the flames burning
          his skin... and that's when he yells...



          Sarah, Bruce, Walt and Kohlan react to his yell...

                        That's Johnny... 

          And they run toward the industrial plant...



          moves to her voice... desperately trying to see through
          smoke from the fire...

            Suddenly, he hears the Cougar's snarly GROWL behind him. 
          Johnny turns and suddenly he is back in the --

          and the Cougar has changed into Malcolm.  Malcolm drags
          Johnny to the ground.  The two men fight... thunder and
            lightning... Johnny is no match for Malcolm... Malcolm
          starts kicking the crap out of him...  Then, Johnny's
          hand reaches out and finds a short broken branch...

          Johnny gets to his feet and SWINGS the branch at Malcolm,
          when it lands, we suddenly cut to:
