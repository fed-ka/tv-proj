      Filing out from the courtyard toward a queue of waiting 
      limos, Blair and Serena find themselves face-to-face.  The 
      silence?  Deafening.  Serena breaks it.

                                  SERENA
                    So.  Off to Yale?

                                  BLAIR
                    Your deductive reasoning skills are 
                    perfect for a place like Brown. 

                                  SERENA
                          (say what?)
                    A  place like Brown? 

                                  BLAIR
                    An enclave of trustafarians and the 
                    children of celebrities who major in 
                    drum circles and  semiotics,  
                    whatever that is.  I can t wait till 
                    you come home next Thanksgiving a 
                    militant veganista, anemic and proud.

                    Brown is an Ivy League school.

                                  BLAIR
                    Everyone knows the only real Ivies 
                    are the holy trinity: Harvard, Yale 
                    and Princeton.

      Blair has now officially managed to offend Serena.

                                  SERENA
                    This might be hard for you to 
                    believe, but not everyone wants to go 
                    to Yale, because not everyone wants 
                    to be Blair Waldorf.

                                  BLAIR
                    Not everyone can be.  Since we re not 
                    friends anymore, let me speak 
                    frankly.  You re not that smart, and 
                    you lack focus and discipline.  Charm 
                    is all well and good, but in the real 
                    world knowledge is power.  You d 
                    never make it past the first round of 
                      admissions at Yale, no matter how 
                    hard you tried.
                          (as Serena reels)
                    Have fun in Providence!  Maybe you 
                    can get your hair dreadlocked while 
                    you re there? 

      Blair walks off, leaving a seething Serena.  As her limo 
      DRIVER opens her door...

                                  GOSSIP GIRL (V.O.)
                    Gossip Girl s hardly a war buff, but 
                    I did cram for a quiz or two on the 
                    American Revolution.  The last time 
                    New Haven was invaded was in 1779.

      Serena takes out her cellphone, with resolve. She calls:

                                  SERENA
                          (into phone)
                    Mom, it s me.  Is that invitation 
                    from Yale still sitting around...? 

                                  GOSSIP GIRL (V.O.)
                    Heads up, B, there's a cannonball 
                    coming your way -- and it s got your 
                    name on it.

      Shots of the classic Gothic buildings; blazing fall foliage; 
      students with bookbags, headed for the library.  Dan runs 
      through the Quad, late somewhere.  We see him bound up the 
      steps of the administration building, and we CUT TO:


      Nate and Chuck are sitting in the picturesque quad.  Nate is 
      watching life pass him by, while Chuck could care less -- 
      he s resting with his hat over his face.

                    I thought we were going to do 
                    something.  What happened to your 
                    master plan?  Finding Skull & Bones?

                                  CHUCK
                    You don t find them, they find you. 

                                  NATE
                    Great.  So we just sit here?
                          (reads an itinerary)
                    There s a football game at one, and a 
                    tour of the University art gallery at 
                    three...

      A couple of YALE GUYS walk by with three SUPER-HOT GIRLS.

                                  NATE (CONT D)
                    Or there s that. 

      As one of the girls, JORDAN, looks at Nate and smiles, he 
      gets up, with:

                                  NATE (CONT D)
                    Maybe this place does have more to 
                    offer than USC?  Good luck sitting on 
                    your ass.

      Nate takes off after the group.  As soon as he s gone, Chuck 
      stands.  Looks at his watch.  He starts to walk through the 
      campus.


      Chuck walks around a corner where he is immediately bumped 
      into by a GUY passing.  He s nearly knocks him over.  Winded 
    and off-balance, Chuck turns to confront him.

                                  CHUCK
                    What the hell...

      Another GUY throws a hood over Chuck s head.  As Chuck is 
      roughly dragged off by two SKULL AND BONES MEMBERS --

                                  SKULL AND BONES LEADER
                    Chuck Bass.  We ve been waiting for 
                    you.


      Nate hangs out on the lawn with the hottest girl from the 
      group he followed, JORDAN.  Her FRIENDS lounge beside them.

                    Whatever major you decide on you can 
                    mix up with electives.  Yale s are 
                    better than most.

                                  NATE
                    Oh yeah?  What s your favorite?

                                  JORDAN
                    It s a toss up between  The Role of 
                    Sex in Art  and  Great Hoaxes in 
                      Archeology. 

                                  NATE
                      Seriously, that s a class?

                                  JORDAN
                    Atlantis, aliens... I researched my 
                    term paper just by watching the Sci-

                    St. Judes?  Then you must know Nate 
                      Archibald.  I heard he s on campus 
                    this weekend.

      Nate freezes.  Will he be exposed?

                                  JORDAN
                    Why does that name sound familiar?

                                  YALE GUY
                    He s the son of Howard  The Captain  
                      Archibald.  We ve been talking about 
                    him in Econ.  Guy s like a modern 
                    Milken.

      Nate hesitates, then doesn t say anything. Turning to Jordan:

                                  NATE
                    Hey, Jordan.  You want to show me 
                    around campus?

                                  JORDAN
                          (flirting)
                    Sure.  But before I go anywhere with 
                      a stranger, I think you should maybe 
                    tell me your name?

                                  NATE
                    Of course.  My name?  

      Nate looks to the group of guys and thinks fast.

                    Is Dan.  Dan Humphrey.

      Jordan stands and grabs Nate s hands, pulling him up. CUT TO:


      Blair comes out of the Admissions Building with a head of 
      steam, only to see: Serena, standing by a table manned by 
      COLLEGE STUDENTS.  They have given her a course catalogue and 
      she s paging through it, looking at things they recommend to 
      her.  Blair crosses to her, hot. 

                                  BLAIR
                    What are you doing, Serena?

                                  SERENA
                    These lovely people are just showing 
                    me the course --

                    No, here.  Yale.  Yale is mine.

      Serena knows where this is going, and:

                                  SERENA
                    While I ll admit I came to punish you 
                    for what you said to me this 
                      morning...

                                  BLAIR
                    Fine.  Consider me punished.  You can 
                    go home now.

                                  SERENA
                      I actually like it here.  Everyone s 
                    so nice, the campus is beautiful, and 
                    do you know how great the Drama 
                    School is? 

                                  BLAIR
                    Of course I know, it s world 
                    renowned! 

                                  SERENA
                    The Dean really made me realize that 
                    by being so set on Brown I closed 
                    myself off to all other options.
                          (off Blair s disgust)
                    Maybe you were right.  Maybe it s 
                    time I focus.

                    While that s a lovely epiphany, I m 
                    afraid it s irrelevant.  It s not as 
                    if you re actually going to get in 
                    here. 

      That s when Serena s phone rings.  Answering --

                    Hello?  An intimate gathering at the 
                    Dean s house tonight?  I d be

                    address, I ll look out for it.  Bye.

                    You should make other plans.  She 
                    said I was her last call.

      Blair can t hide her vulnerability.  Her mood darkens.

                    Of all the things-- Nate, my mom, the 
                    girls at school -- you wouldn t take 
                    this away from me.  Because if you 
                    do, I swear I will take you down.

                                  SERENA
                    I m not taking anything from you, B.  
                    I was invited.  And as for taking me 
                    down?
                          (newly confident)

                    This crowd might get... particular.   
                          (hangs up, to Serena)
                    I know you re not a geography whiz, 
                    but you are aware that Providence is 
                    in Rhode Island?

                                  SERENA
                    I don t have time to explain.  I ve

                      Apparently the Dean asks invitees

      Nate is walking through the Campus, alone, when his cell

                    Blair, a guy died.  And you use it as

                                  BLAIR
                    It s not a game, and this isn t just 
                    another thing on a laundry list.  
                    This is Yale.  My dream.  You crossed 
                    a line.

      Now Blair shoves Serena.

                    So did you, when you brought up Pete. 
                    And as for my being here, take that 
                    up with the school.  

      Serena shakes her off and turns to leave, but Blair beans her 
      with her handbag.  Serena stops -- she did not just do that!

                                  BLAIR
                    Why do you think you were invited?  
                    You know on paper you're not Yale 
                    material.  Could it be your face on 
                    Page Six?  Your name everywhere?  
                    Face it, Serena -- Yale needs to up 
                    their Q rating just like all the 
                    other schools, and girls like you are 
                    what they re going to use to do it. 

      Finally Serena can take no more, practically runs at Blair --

                    No, you shut up --

      Blair tries to duck but Serena grabs her dress.  Blair slaps 
      her away.  Serena slaps her back.  And they re into it.  A 
      full-on S and B catfight.  As we leave them, mid brawl --

    if one said something, the other would follow, but instead:

                                  SERENA
                    Sounds great.

                                  BLAIR
                    I agree.

                                  SERENA
                    Goodbye, Blair.

                                  BLAIR
                    Goodbye, Serena.

    And with that, the girls walk their separate ways.  As they 
      disappear into opposite corners of the campus...

                    This just in: our favorite duo has

                    Are our beloved BFF s really over and

                    what they like even less is a series 
                    finale.  Say it ain t so?

      Dan, Nate and Jordan are having their morning coffee on 
      benches in the Quad.  Jordan has read Dan s stories.  Nate is 
      happy to have brokered this meeting.  He looks on, proudly:

                                  NATE
                    So you think maybe you can help?

                                  JORDAN
                    I can t promise anything, but I m 
                    pretty sure I can get someone in the 
                      department to read these and write 
                    you a recommendation. 

                                  DAN
                          (to Jordan and Nate)
                    Thanks, seriously.  It s nice to know 
                    my dream of Yale isn t totally dead.  
                      Humiliated and embarrassed, sure, but 
                    not dead. 

      Jordan and Nate laugh.

                                  NATE
                          (to Jordan)
                    And I m sorry about lying.  As I told 
                    Dan last night, I just wanted to be 
                    someone else for a while, and being 
                    him seemed like a good choice.

                                  DAN
                    Let me tell you, you did Dan Humphrey 
                    better than Dan Humphrey.  That 
                    thousand yard squint?  Can I steal 
                    that?

      Jordan shakes Dan s hand, and then turns to Nate:

                                  JORDAN
                    Next time you re up here, maybe just 
                    be yourself?
                          (kissing him:)
                    I would have liked you whatever your 
                    name was. 

      As she leaves, Dan gives Nate a thumbs-up.  Nate laughs.    GOSSIP GIRL - Episode 206 - McNally & Safran - Double White   48.



      Chuck exits his dorm to come face to face with angry Skull & 
      Bones Members.

                                  SKULL AND BONES LEADER
                    Looks like someone messed up last 
                    night and sent us after the wrong 
                    guy.

                                  CHUCK
                    He may not have been who you were 
                    looking for, but he was the right guy 
                    for me.

      Skull and Bones make a move towards Chuck, but The Leader 
      pushes his way to the front and pulls them back.

                                  SKULL AND BONES LEADER
                    No, not now.  Not here.  It would 
                    look bad.  We ll make him pay for it 
                    when he gets here next fall.

                                  CHUCK
                    Oh, I'm not coming here next year.  

      As the Members all look at each other, confused:

                                  CHUCK (CONT D)
                    Those girls I brought to the party

                    Keep it.  I ve got plenty. 

      Chuck walks off, leaving the stunned Skull and Bones members 
      to argue amongst themselves. 


      Serena rushes up the stairs and in through the front door.  
      Running smack into -- BLAIR -- who s exiting.  The two girls 
      look at each other, a tense moment.

                                  BLAIR
                    What are you doing here, making sure 
                    the Dean knows it was all my fault?  

                                  SERENA
                    No.  I came to tell him that Yale is 
                    your dream, and that you deserve to 
                    go here more than I do.  What are you

                                  SERENA
                    I was up all night thinking about the 
                    first time we came here together when 
                    we were nine.  Remember when your dad 
                    took us to the Harvard/Yale game, and 
                    you tackled Senator Schumer s 
                    daughter because she was in a Harvard 
                      sweatshirt?

                    I bet those grass stains never came 
                    out.
                          (off Serena s smile)
                    I don t want to not know you.  I   
                    can t not know you.

                    But everything we said to each other 
                    last night...

                                  BLAIR
                    Was the truth that needed to be said.  
                    Like this: I'm jealous because it all 
                    seems so easy for you, and I have to 
                    fight for everything.

                                  SERENA
                    Or this: I only take things from you 
                    because if you want them, I know 
                    they re worth having.  I don't know 
                    what I want, or who I am, without 
                    you.

      Serena takes Blair s hands in hers.  Blair s eyes well up.

                    I know who you are.  The only person

                    Maybe we had that fight because the 
                    reality of being separated next year 
                    is just too scary to think about?
