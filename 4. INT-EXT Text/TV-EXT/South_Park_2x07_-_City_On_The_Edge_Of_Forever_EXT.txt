               The school bus drives up a snowy mountain road.


               The bus slips off the road, and flips over down the side of 
               the mountain.


               The bus continues to do flips. Finally, it lands, right-side 
               up in a fast moving river.


               The bus floats helplessly down the river. All the kids have 
               their heads out the windows, screaming.

               The river is moving faster and faster, the bus goes an amazing 
               distance. Finally, it reaches a waterfall where it plunges.

                                     EVERYBODY
                         AAAAHGHGhGH!!!!


               A group of properly dressed bird watchers happily hike through 
               the forest.

                                     BIRD WATCHER
                         And right up here, you can see a red 
                         bellied chickadee. They're indigenous 
                         to this area.

               A couple old people snap some photos.

               They give each other quizzical looks when a very strange 
               sound seems to be coming closer.

               Just then, the school bus flips through frame. All the kids 
               on board screaming as they go. As quickly as it came, it 
               disappears.

                                     OLD LADY
                         What was that?

                                     BIRD WATCHER
                         What was what?


               The bus flips into yet another river, where it hurls further 
               into the unknown.

               Finally, after several shots, the bus washes up onto a piece 
               of dry land, where it teeters dangerously over a huge abyss.


               Ms. Crabtree climbs down some large rocks towards what she 
               hopes to be a road.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         Had to happen to me, didn't it?

               Finally, she gets to a road.


               A big, burly lecherous TRUCKER drives along the deserted 
               road, singing.

                                     TRUCKER
                              (singing)
                         Looking for love in all the wrong 
                         places. Looking for love in too many --

               Suddenly, he notices Ms. Crabtree hitchhiking.

                                     TRUCKER
                         Oooh, it's supper time. Come to papa.

               He checks himself in the mirror, slicks back his hair and 
               pulls his rig over to Ms. Crabtree.

                                     TRUCKER
                         Hello, little lady. Going my way?

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         Shut up and help me in to this thing.

               The trucker is taken back by her abrasiveness.

                                     TRUCKER
                         Oh, uh --

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         Come on. I haven't got all day.

                                     TRUCKER
                         Uh, alright, sure. Of course.

               He helps her into the cab.

               The trucker looks down at Crabtree voluptuous thighs.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         Take me to the nearest town and make 
                         it snappy, you freak-ass crackpot.

               The big, burly trucker now cowers under Ms. Crabtree's 
               assaults.

                                     TRUCKER
                         Uh, yes ma'am. Right away, ma'am. So 
                         uh... What's a fragile little doe 
                         like yourself doing out on a night 
                         like this?

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         Look mister, I've got a busload of 
                         kids trapped up on that pass. I need 
                         a crane, helicopters all that crap. 
                         Here, let me have some of your 
                         aspirin.

                                     TRUCKER
                         Ma'am those are actually rufies.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         Rufies, aspirin, right now I don't 
                         give a rats ass.

               Crabtree scarfs the rufies down.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         How far to the nearest town?

                                     TRUCKER
                         A ways...


               The truck drives on into the horizon.


               The bus is still teetering dangerously on the side of the 
               cliff.

               Just then, a huge ice cream truck comes out of Cartman's

                         Yeah, right, let me come with you.

               Ms. Crabtree jumps out of the truck. The Trucker follows 
               her. The back of the truck reads 'Red's Rufies -- They're a 
               knock out!' The town is deserted except for one building 
               with a bright, flashing neon sign that reads "Pauly Shore's

               They see the kid look left, then right, then start walking 
               straight ahead.


               The boys watch on, horrified, as a HUGE, horrible monster 
               scoops up the kid in the red shirt with one enormous claw.

               back of her head blows apart, and her body is sent flying 
               backwards and an Alien comes out of her body.

               The crowd GASPS!!

               Mr. Garrison fires off a few rounds, killing the alien.

               Death is chasing the boys down South Park Avenue. (From 
               episode 106)

               The boys run screaming down South Park avenue. Death pursues 
               them on a tricycle.

               Grandpa is pursuing Death in his wheelchair.

                                     GRANDPA
                         Come back here you pompous son of a 
                         panzy!

               Slowly, Death catches up to the boys, he stretches out his 
               bony hand...

                                     STAN
                         AAGH!!

                         Don't let him touch you! You die if 
                         he touches you!!

                                     GRANDPA
                         I'm over here you son of a whore!

               Death reaches out to touch Kenny, but Kenny grabs on to 
               Death's cloak, pulls him off the tricycle, and beats the 
               shit out of him.

               Kenny kicks death in the ribs until death is a bloody, pulpy 
               mass.

                         OH MY GOD!! KENNY KILLED DEATH!!

               Now it's daytime, and the kids are all still sitting on the 
               bus, with a huge hole ripped off the top.

                                     CARTMAN
                         I wonder when the monster's gonna 
                         come back to feed again!

               The kids all exchange looks.

                                     KYLE
                         We've just got to stick together.

                              (thinking)
                         Yeah, there's got to be a way out of 
                         this...

                                     KYLE

                         What?

                         Remember that time... Fonzie jumped 
                         over the busses with his motorcycle?

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:


               Everybody is gathered in the parking lot of Al's. Fonzie is 
               dressed like Evil Kneival on his motorcycle.

               Fonzie revs the engine.

                                     JOANIE
                         GO FONZIE!!

                                     FONZIE
                         Ayyyyyy.

               The boys cheer Fonzie on.

                                     CARTMAN
                         YOU CAN DO IT, FONZIE!

                                     STAN
                         WE BELIEVE IN YOU FONZ!!

                                     FONZIE
                         Ayyyyy.

               Fonzie gives a THUMBS UP, then puts on his helmet. He revs 
               the engine some more, and then hauls ass towards a large 
               ramp in front of the busses.

               Fonzie JUMPS! He clears the busses!

               Everybody cheers!

               But when Fonzie lands, his bike spins out of control! Fonzie's 
               bike flies into Kenny, crushing him instantly.

                                     FONZIE
                         Ayyyyy,

               Fonzie pulls out an ice cream cone and starts eating it.

                                     STAN
                         Oh my God! They killed Kenny!

               The bus slides a few feet, and tilts further down into the 
               chasm!


               Again night has fallen. The bus goes CREEEEK as it tilts 
               further down the slope.


               They see the kid look left, then right, then start walking 
               straight ahead.


               The boys watch on, horrified, as a HUGE, horrible monster 
               scoops up the kid in the red shirt with one enormous claw.

                                     KYLE
                         HOLY CRAP, DUDE!!

               The beast raises the screaming child up to its mouth, and 
               swallows it whole. Then it pulls out a large scooper and a 
               box.

                                     KYLE
                         Hey look! It's got ice cream!!

                         Hooray!!

               A huge hole is ripped in the top of the bus, and ice cream 
               cones are dropped all around.

               The kids all merrily eat the ice cream.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:


               Ms. Crabtree and Marcus sit on a fallen tree, holding hands 
               and looking out over the beautiful scenery.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         Wow... This is gorgeous. I don't 
                         think I've ever seen anything so 
                         beautiful.

                                     MARCUS
                         From a distance this place looks 
                         like a cold, damp marsh, but once 
                         you get inside it... You realize 
                         that it has an inner beauty far 
                         surpassing others.

               Ms. Crabtree stares at Marcus.

                                     MARCUS
                         Thank you for sharing your time with 
                         me Ms. Crabtree.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         Me too Marcus. I've forgotten all 
                         about my cares in the world...


               ***MAKE THIS LIKE TITANIC***

               It slides off the cliff and spirals towards the ground. We 
               can see the children's horrified faces as they plunge to the 
               depths.

                                     KIDS

                                         EPILOGUE

               The bus falls and falls, and finally lands in a HUGE container 
               of ice cream!

               The kids all sit there stunned for a minute...

                                     STAN
                         HEY! WE LANDED IN ICE CREAM!!

                         Wait, wait, wait... this doesn't 
                         make sense... This whole thing doesn't

               Crabtree is in the lily covered forest with her lover.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         I want to thank you for making me 
                         feel alive again, Marcus.

                         Ms. Crabtree...

                         What is it? What's wrong?

                                     MARCUS
                         You realize I can't stay. None of 
                         this is real. It's all been a little 
                         eight year old's dream.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         Oh I know... I know, Marcus. But let 
                         me just pretend as long as I can.

                                     MARCUS
                         Sure.

               Marcus puts his arm around Ms. Crabtree. The camera PULLS 
               BACK as they are silhouetted against a gorgeous sky.

                                         THE END
