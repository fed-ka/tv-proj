GROCERY STORE.
DAY.
Now wearing the pin in his own jacket along with the neckerchief and
a stern expression, YURI strides to the front of the line in the
store.
YURI (V.O.)
Where I grew up, everyone was equal.
Some
were just more equal than others.
The female STORE CLERK is about to order Yuri to the back of the
line when Yuri flashes the pin.
Intimidated, the Clerk smiles and pulls a special tray from under
the counter.
In contrast to the meager offerings on the shelves,
the tray contains bags of sugar, coffee, bananas, even Pepsi.
APARTMENT - ODESSA.
DAY.
A Soviet-style apartment building.
Front door opens - YURI enters,
shopping bag in hand.
His mother, IRINA, pokes her head out of the kitchen.
Yuri holds up
a banana.
YURI
(in subtitled Ukrainian)
Shortages?
What shortages?
Irina shakes her head in amazement.
APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM.
DAY.
While a parade of weapons in Red Square plays silently on the state-
controlled TV, father ANATOLY and Military Cadet older brother
VITALY, shoulder bandaged, sit at a tiny table, drinking cheap vodka
and listening intently to an illegal shortwave radio - coat hanger
for antenna.
YURI (V.O.)
My father was a wounded hero of World War Two, my
younger brother was wounded in Afghanistan - a
war without heroes.
I'd gotten out of military
service due to a heart problem - it wasn't
completely a lie.
YURI joins them, careful not to interrupt the broadcoast.
He goes to pour himself a glass of vodka.
Without looking away from
the radio, his father's hand grasps Yuri's in a vice-like grip,
preventing him from lifting the bottle.
RADIO ANNOUNCER
(impossibly upper-crust British
accent)
--Finally, in response to human rights
protests and in an effort to encourage the
United States to sell grain to the Soviet
Union after two successive crop failures, it
is reported that the politburo has consented
to permit a limited number of Jews to
emigrate from the Soviet Union to Israel.
(beat)
And that concludes this edition of news from
the BBC World Service.
Anatoly, deep in thought, switches off the radio.
IRINA enters,
puts Yuri's "feast" on the table.
They speak Ukrainian, subtitled.
ANATOLY
(incredulous)
Trading Jews for grain.
VITALY
(reaching for a banana)
It's good P.R. - for the Moscow Olympics.
IRINA
(shrugs)
Good for the Jews.
YURI
And us.
All eyes to Yuri, family confused.
YURI (cont'd)
(matter-of-fact)
We're Jewish.
VITALY
(scoffing)
We're not Jewish.
YURI
(shrug)
We're Jewish if we say we're Jewish.
The stunned family stares at him - out of the mouths of babes.
Anatoly
finally breaks the silence, pours Yuri a drink.
ANATOLY
Mazeltov.
Yuri and the family drink to their new identity.
UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT OFFICE.
DAY.
ANATOLY, with YURI at his side, presents the rubbing along with
other crudely forged paperwork confirming their Jewish ancestry to a
CLERK.
"ORLOVITCH" now "ORLOV".
YURI (V.O.)
The rubbing from the Jewish headstone was my
first forged document.
Little about my life
has been kosher ever since.
The Clerk gives Anatoly and Yuri the once-over, then
stamps an emigration visa.
APARTMENT, BEDROOM.
NIGHT.
Suitcase in hand, YURI surveys his bedroom for the last time.
A car horn.
He glances through the window to the communist-style
plaza below.
ANATOLY beckons impatiently to Yuri.
VITALY and IRINA
load overstuffed suitcases into an old Russian sedan driven by an
old Russian Military Officer, UNCLE DMITRI.
Yuri stares at himself in the mirror.
He replaces his stolen Soviet
pin for a necklace - a Star of David.
BEN GURION AIRPORT - TEL AVIV.
DAY.
CLOSE UP on a heavily-retouched photograph of GOLDA MEIR.
She's
still not pretty.
YURI stares up at it.
YURI (V.O.)
We Russian Jews were supposed to be headed
for Israel but I didn't see much of the
country on that first trip.
We reveal he is standing in a jam-packed, standing-roam-only
"TRANSIT" lounge.
YURI (V.O.)
Real Jews or fake Jews, eighty-five percent
of us ended up in that other "promised
land".
The Pan American destination board reads: "PA 447 to NEW YORK".
"CRIMEAN RESTAURANT" - LITTLE ODESSA.
DAY.
A typical Jewish establishment with all its paraphernalia - menorah
on the mantle, etc.
The family sits in a small dining room
attached to the restaurant.
ANATOLY reads the Torah as he waits
for dinner with YURI and VITALY.
YURI (V.O.)
I had no idea my father would take his
assumed identity so much to heart.
I guess
he just stayed in character.
YURI, older, as we now know him, studies school work.
Long-haired
VITALY watches "Band Aid" on TV.
IRINA puts a plate of mussels in front of Anatoly.
ANATOLY
(glaring at the plate,
incredulous)
How many times--I can't eat shellfish.
It's
"treyf".
IRINA
You're not Jewish.
ANATOLY
I like it.
(picking up his felt fedora)
I like the hat - to remind us there's
something above us.
I like that.
Anatoly dons his hat.
ANATOLY (cont'd)
I'm going to temple.
IRINA
You're not going to temple.
You go to
temple more than the rabbi!
Vitaly begins eating his father's plate of mussels.
Yuri watches his
father exit.
YURI (V.O.)
I was suffering an identity crisis of my own.
We focus on orientation booklets from a careers fair.
Yuri shuffles
between the eagle of the CIA and the dove of the U.N.
YURI (V.O.)
My gift for languages made me highly sought
after.
The C.I.A. and U.N. were both heavily
recruiting Russian immigrants.
Yuri settles on the dove.
ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER.
DAY.
The blue helmeted YURI is seated in a white U.N. armored personnel
carrier, the background behind him morphs from
one Third World location to another: Third World desert
to Third World rainforest to Third World slum.
YURI (V.O.)
The fastest way to find out you can't change
the world is to actually go there.
PRESIDENTIAL MANSION RESTROOM.
DAY.
BAPTISTE pisses at a urinal.
YURI and the BODYGUARDS hang back a
respectful distance.
BAPTISTE
(taunting Yuri)
Aren't you going to help me hold my cock?
YURI
(glancing towards the urinal)
Doesn't look like a job for two men.
The BODYGUARDS stiffen at the insult.
Baptiste stares Yuri down for
a moment, then suddenly bursts into laughter.
The TWO BODYGUARDS
also start to laugh - cautiously.
Baptiste washes his hands, stares at Yuri in the mirror, smiles.
BAPTISTE
You know you are fighting a losing battle,
my young friend.
War is nature.
If you
take away the guns, we will kill each other
with knives.
Take away the knives, we will
kill each other with sticks.
Take away the
sticks, we will kill each other with your
peace treaties.
(turning to face Yuri)
You cannot stop this bath of blood.
YURI
It's not "bath of blood".
It's, "blood
bath".
BAPTISTE
Thank you.
But I like it my way.
Baptiste smiles and exits, leaving the words ringing in Yuri's head.
CAPTAIN CARLISLE'S PRIVATE QUARTERS.
NIGHT.
CLOSE ON two blue helmets lying beside each other.
YURI and CAPTAIN VIVIAN CARLISLE are under the mosquito netting of a
bed in her private quarters - trying to get each other out of their
respective clothes as fast as possible - mouths and hands
everywhere.
Even in the heat of the moment, VIVIAN is unable to completely let
go of her work.
VIVIAN
(between heavy breaths)
What are we doing here, Yuri?
YURI
(kissing her nipple)
Whatever you want.
VIVIAN
You know what I mean.
Here, in this
country.
Are we doing any good?
YURI
(finally telling her what she
wants to hear)
Would nothing be better?
Satisfied with the answer, she completely gives in to the throes of
passion - pulls him to her.
LATER
VIVIAN, satiated, dozes amongst the rumpled sheets, backside
exposed.
YURI uses the opportunity to take an impression of the key attached
to her belt.
"THE CRIMEAN" RESTAURANT - BRIGHTON BEACH.
DAY.
The BULLET has been turned into a pendant, replacing Yuri's Star of
David.
YURI, wearing a sharp, new suit, enters the family restaurant.
One
table of CUSTOMERS - not exactly a thriving concern.
YURI (V.O.)
The starting salary for a U.N. interpreter
back then was $32,000.
I made fifty K on
"misplaced" weapons on that one trip alone.
I doubt the Secretary General noticed.
The
U.N. spends more on lunch.
Yuri kisses father and Maitre d', ANATOLY, who is adding more Jewish
decoration to the window.
He bear hugs mother, IRINA, nearly
causing her to drop the plates she is carrying.
YURI (V.O.)
My tour as a peacekeeper was the perfect
preparation for war.
Irina notices the change in her son's appearance.
IRINA
(calling after him)
Who are you?
You're not my son.
My son
doesn't own such a suit.
Yuri flashes his killer smile in response.
Out of their sight, he slips a hundred dollar bill into the cash
register and breezes into the kitchen.
"THE CRIMEAN" RESTAURANT - KITCHEN.
DAY.
VITALY, now chef in the family business, prepares a Russian borscht
in a kitchen unlikely to pass a health inspection.
YURI tastes the food, pretends to gag, spits it out in the sink.
Vitaly affectionately cuffs his older brother - the joke
obviously a familiar ritual.
Yuri takes his brother to the kitchen's rear door.
CONVENTION CENTER - PARIS.
DAY.
A platoon of attractive YOUNG WOMEN in camouflage mini-dresses show off
the latest sniper rifles and grenade launchers.
An ASIAN BUSINESSMAN pitches hardware to YURI.
VITALY is more
interested in the girls.
ASIAN BUSINESSMAN
(brochure in hand)
--I can get you the shoulder-fired SA-7
surface-to-air missiles.
The older Chinese
model.
Not so effective against modern
military aircraft but deadly if used against
a commercial airliner.
I'm giving them away
at eight-fifty.
Yuri notices that his vendor's attention has wandered to a suave
older gentleman, SIMEON ZAHAROFF, surrounded by eager VENDORS of all
nationalities.
The Asian man joins the enthusiastic throng.
YURI (V.O.)
It was the eighties and the Cold War was far
from thawed.
Most of the deals were
government-to-government.
There were some go-
betweens - freelancers - but it was a mostly
private club with a lifetime club president.
Yuri drags Vitaly away from the sales girls.
YURI
That's him.
The guy Eli told me about.
Simeon
Zaharoff.
Brokered deals in the Iran/Iraq war
- both sides, sold missiles to Argentina in the
Falklands.
Hets a fucking legend.
I've got to
talk to him.
Yuri pushes past Zaharoff's entourage.
YURI
Simeon!
Simeon!
A BODYGUARD tries to step between Yuri and Zaharoff.
VITALY
(stepping between the bodyguard
and Yuri)
They're talking.
Zaharoff, irritated, nonetheless humors Yuri.
SIMEON
May I help you?
YURI
A mutual friend, Eli Kurtzman from Brighton
Beach Import-Export said to contact you.
I
have a business proposal.
Perhaps we can
discuss it - over a drink.
Simeon looks him up and down.
SIMEON
You're in the wrong place my young friend.
This is no place for amateurs.
Simeon walks away without another word.
Vitaly shrugs.
Yuri
fumes.
YURI
(under his breath in Ukrainian)
Yob tvayu mat.
(Subtitled - Motherfucker.)
Yuri watches Simeon go, surrounded by flunkies.
YURI (V.O.)
Curious how you always revert to your native
tongue in moments of extreme anger...
HOTEL ROOM - PARIS.
NIGHT
Camouflage minidress and beret are now discarded on the floor - a
contrast to the blue helmet seen earlier.
YURI (V.O.)
...and ecstacy.
YURI and VITALY are getting it on with two SALES GIRLS.
We pan from one couple in the living room, Vitaly, to the one in
the bedroom, Yuri.
We focus on Yuri, in the midst of the act - hears his brother's
moans in Ukrainian.
VITALY (O.C.)
Boh...Boh.
Oh, Boh! (Subtitle:
God...God.
Oh, God!)
Yuri smiles at Vitaly's cries.
Something catches Yuri's eye on TV.
CLOSE UP OF A TV SCREEN
showing images of the aftermath of the suicide bombing at the U.S.
barracks in Lebanon.
YURI (V.O.)
Vitaly and I found our niche in under-the-
counter gunrunning - regimes suffering under
sanctions.
BEIRUT WAREHOUSE.
DAY.
Inside the warehouse is a ten foot high, unruly pile of junked
weapons.
YURI (V.O.)
When the United States leaves a war zone,
they generally don't take their munitions.
It costs more to bring it back than buy new
stock.
YURI and VITALY usher the CUSTOMER over to an industrial scale
loaded with assorted weapons.
YURI
I sell by the kilo.
The CUSTOMER checks the combined weight of the weapons.
YURI (cont'd)
(shrug)
They're second-hand weapons but they're
still okay.
Both men pullout calculators and start haggling over the price.
YURI (V.O.)
For all my language skills, I soon
discovered that what talks best is money.
As long as you can speak dollars, dinars,
drachmas, rubles, rupees, pesos, escudos,
lira, krones, kwanzas, trancs, guilders,
deutshmarks, yen and pounds-fucking-
sterling, you can communicate anywhere in
the world.
Money is finally exchanged.
Yuri and Vitaly leave the Customer with
his munitions pot-pourri.
WAREHOUSE - BARRANQUILLA, COLOMBIA.
DAY.
YURI, now heavily bandaged around the waist, and VITALY keep a
watchful eye as the NARC LEADER inspects crates of machine guns and
other ammunition.
YURI (V.O.)
The second rule is always ensure you have a
foolproof way to get paid.
Credit card,
check, cash.
Preferably in advance, ideally
to an off-shore account.
It's why I choose
my customers so carefully.
Say what you
like about warlords and dictators, they tend
to have a highly developed sense of order.
They always pay their bills on time.
The Narc Leader nods his approval.
NARC LEADER
(referring to Yuri's wound)
I apologize for earlier.
YURI
(slight wince)
I understand.
WORKERS start loading the crates into a truck.
The Narc Leader
hands Yuri the suitcase.
NARC LEADER
It's all there.
Yuri snaps open the suitcase - inside six kilos of cocaine.
YURI
What is this?
NARC LEADER
Six keys of pure.
YURI
(incredulous)
I can't hand this to my fucking bank teller
at Chase Manhattan.
NARC LEADER
(hair-trigger temper flaring
again)
You should be thanking me.
(waving his cell phone)
Have you checked the street price today?
With the seizures at the border last week,
it's jumped thirty percent.
YURI
I sell guns.
I don't sell drugs.
NARC LEADER
(shrug)
Diversify.
The Narc Leader walks away.
YURI
(calling after him)
I've got standards.
The Narc Leader ignores him, climbs in his Jeep and drives off.
The
truck, loaded with munitions, also exits.
Yuri and Vitaly are left alone in their warehouse.
VITALY
(staring at their "remuneration")
Now what?
Yuri shrugs, slices open one of the packs of cocaine.
He takes a
bill from his pocket, rolls it into a tube.
He goes to hand Vitaly the tube but his brother has already rolled
his own.
Vitaly dips his tube into the coke - snorts, keeps snorting - a
longer inhale than should be possible for a human being.
HOTEL ROOM - BARRANQUILLA, COLOMBIA.
NIGHT.
Six kilo-sized coffee cans.
YURI, still bandaged, is pouring the
coffee down the toilet and replacing it with the bags of cocaine,
mumbling Ukrainian profanities as he works.
The last bag is missing.
YURI
(sighs, exasperated)
Vit.
HOTEL HALLWAY.
NIGHT.
In the hotel corridor, YURI discovers the door to the adjacent room wide
open.
Inside, the room is vacant.
BOLIVIAN BUS.
DAY.
YURI, clearly fuming, is standing in a standing-roam-only Bolivian
public bus along with an assortment of PEASANTS, MIGRANTS and
FARMYARD ANIMALS.
On the wall of the bus Yuri notices a cellphone ad featuring AVA
CORDOVA.
YURI (V.O.)
I found Vitaly twelve days, two thousand
miles and 150 grams later in a Bolivian
boarding house.
VITALY'S ROOM - BOARDING HOUSE.
LA PAZ, BOLIVIA.
DAY.
The outline of Ukraine drawn with cocaine.
VITALY, out of his mind, pupils the size of nickels, humming a
Ukrainian folk tune, is putting the finishing touches to the map
from his badly depleted bag of cocaine.
with him, two BOLIVIAN PROSTITUTES, who appear to have passed out or
worse.
A pounding on the door.
YURI (O.C.)
Vitaly!
Open this fucking door!
Vitaly, absorbed with the task at hand, appears not to notice.
Yuri
breaks in the door.
VITALY
(happy - way too happy)
Yuri!
(to the comatose prostitutes)
It's my brother, Yuri.
He's my big brother.
Yuri stares at the cocaine map.
YURI
What the fuck is that?
VITALY
Ukraine.
(indicating the direction he is
going to snort)
I start in Odessa, work my way to the
Crimea--
YURI
(staring at the map, appalled)
--You'll be fucking dead before you reach
Kiev.
Yuri opens a window, the cocaine blows off the table.
VITALY
You fuck!
Vitaly freaks out, slams the window so hard it shatters.
(The
Hookers still don't rouse.)
VITALY (cant'd)
You fucking fuck!
Vitaly desperately tries to snort the cocaine out of the shag pile
carpet - the straw constantly clogging with carpet fibers.
Blood oozes from Vitaly's nostril.
Yuri gazes down at his pathetic
brother.
CATHOLIC CHURCH - BRIGHTON BEACH.
DAY.
IRINA lights a candle in front of the Virgin Mary.
YURI (V.O.)
Vitaly never got completely clean despite
the prayers of my mother...
SYNAGOGUE - BRIGHTON BEACH.
DAY.
ANATOLY prays in front of the menorah.
YURI (V.O.)
...and father.
In fact, my younger brother
was the only reason my father ever had to
question his new religion.
AIR MAROC JETLINER.
DAY.
An EXECUTIVE sits in his Business Class seat.
On the tray table in
front of him, calculator and spreadsheets.
YURI (V.O.)
After Colombia I became a one-man-operation.
A sole proprietor as you say on your tax
return - that is if you're foolish enough to
fill one out.
He exchanges a collegial smile with YURI who has similar
entrepreneurial paraphernalia in front of him.
YURI (V.O.)
By then I'd mastered my craft.
Selling arms
is not so different to selling vacuum
cleaners.
You advertise, pound the
pavement, take orders.
The businessman's smile dissolves when he catches a glance at the
brochure lying next to Yuri's "Day-Runner" - glossy photos of
GRENADE LAUNCHERS.
A MONTAGE OF SCENES - ILLUSTRATING THE ANATOMY OF AN ARMS DEAL.
It takes place in an unidentified country in North Africa.
YURI (V.O.)
Of course, a good arms dealer also has to be
a political scientist.
I go by a seven-step
approach.
YURI gets off a plane.
YURI (V.O.)
One: identity a government and an opposition
where the opposition is ignored.
YURI immediately picks up a newspaper, eager for the latest news.
YURI (V.O.)
Two: Wait for a radical group to break away
from the opposition.
YURI is buoyed by the front page news, over-tips the NEWSPAPER
SELLER.
YURI (V.O.)
Three: Immediately approach the radical
group and offer them arms.
YURI meets a group of REVOLUTIONARIES in a backstreet bar, shows
them an arms catalogue.
YURI (V.O.)
Four: Whether they buy or not, inform the
government that the radical group approached
you and offer the government arms.
YURI meets a GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL in the parliament buildings, shows
him the same catalogue.
YURI (V.O.)
Five: Whether they buy or not, re-approach
the radical group and offer them more arms
but now at a higher price.
Increasing
tension is a means of generating demand and
the ideal situation is to sell to both
sides.
YURI meets the REVOLUTIONARIES a second time in the same bar - this
time they are more enthusiastic and Yuri has his calculator out.
YURI (V.O.)
Six: If they start shooting at each other,
the escalation is underway.
YURI, now accompanied by bodyguards, is escorted into the government
buildings, where he's given a fat envelope.
Back at the bar, YURI is given an even fatter envelope.
YURI (V.O.)
They are consuming small arms and ammunition
and the cash register is well and truly
ringing.
YURI stands at his hotel window, sneaking a look through grimy
venetian blinds.
A street battle is taking place.
However, in Yuri's mind the sound of the gunshots is gradually
replaced by the sound ot a cash register.
Each time a gun is fired,
the register rings.
Yuri shuts the window.
YURI (V.O.)
Seven: Don't forget that the success of a
radical group in one country can inspire a
radical group in a neighboring country.
Yuri boards a plane, taking off for a new conflict zone.
AIR MAROC JETLINER.
DAY.
YURI leans back in his Business Class seat - eyes closed.
They
suddenly blink open.
He feels someone watching him.
Sure enough, he is face-to-face with AVA CORDOVA - staring at him
from a magazine cover in the seat pocket next to him.
MODEL AGENCY.
DAY.
A gallery of MODELS from the late-eighties on VOGUE, HARPER'S
BAZAAR, ELLE magazine covers, blown-up and framed on a white wall.
An AGENT with a window-office overlooking Park Avenue talks on the
phone.
In front of her, the headshot of AVA CORDOVA.
AGENT
(into phone)
--There's really no one else you'd consider?
Christie and Brooke are both available...not
the right look?
It's just that Ava doesn't
generally do print.
The agent examines an envelope stuffed with cash.
AGENT (cont'd)
However, since you are willing to double her
rate and pay cash in advance.
She loves
working with Herb and you say the campaign
will only be seen in Asia?
(examining a first class plane ticket
Destination: St. Barts)
I certainly can't see her objecting to the
location.
(inspecting an itinerary)
What is the product again...?
ARMS SHOW CONVENTION HALL.
DAY.
YURI talks on a phone as he browses at an arms show.
He stops at a
display of handguns.
YURI
(into phone)
The product?
Er,...Colt .45.
(a beat)
The beer.
EDEN ROCK HOTEL - ST. BARTHELEMY, FRENCH CARIBBEAN.
DAY.
An idyllic beachfront hotel.
AVA CORDOVA enters an empty reception area.
The RECEPTIONIST hands
her a fax - Ava's face falls.
YURI sits by the deserted pool, observing her entrance.
YURI (V.O.)
It cost me twenty for the fake booking,
another twelve to buy out the hotel.
You
can't force someone to tall in love with you
but you can sure make ita damn sight
easier.
HOTEL RESTAURANT.
DUSK.
A large restaurant overlooking the ocean.
AVA and YURI are the only guests, both eating alone.
They make eye-
contact - exchange polite smiles.
LEAR JET.
DAY.
YURI and AVA sit beside each other on a white leather sofa in the
customized cabin drinking Cristal champagne.
Yuri glances through Vogue magazine - a photo spread on Ava.
Ava
takes in the plane's sumptuous appointments.
YURI
(pretending to be impressed with
the photos)
I had no idea.
He hands her back the magazine.
YURI (cant'd)
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.
You must
think me very rude.
AVA
Don't apologize.
I put on clothes for a
living.
YURI
(wry grin)
At least you aren't taking them off.
AVA
(smiling at his irreverence)
I would be if half the photographers had
their way.
(shrug)
But I can't complain.
I'm paid to say,
"Cheese".
(meeting his gaze)
What about you?
YURI
Nothing so glamorous.
I'm in transport -
international air freight mostly.
AVA
What, like UPS or something?
YURI
Something like that.
AVA
(glance to her champagne flute)
Business is good.
YURI
Like you, I can't complain.
They both drink.
A thought occurs to Ava.
AVA
But if you did?
YURI
Well...I don't know.
(reluctant admission)
It's just that I travel all around the world
but I can't help feeling sometimes that I'm
going nowhere.
Ava regards him closely.
He's echoed her thoughts.
Yuri pours Ava
another drink.
YURI (cont'd)
Here's to...
(raising his glass)
...a hurricane.
They toast.
YURI (cont'd)
Without it, I'd never have met you.
She meets his eye.
AVA
This is no accident, is it, Yuri?
Yuri freezes - doesn't answer.
AVA (cont'd)
It feels like fate.
YURI
(never averting his eyes)
I don't believe in fate.
AVA
What do you believe in?
Yuri gazes at her a moment - he answers her question with a kiss.
Ava does not pull away.
LEAR JET - BEDROOM.
DAY.
CLOUDS rush by the faces of YURI and AVA, heads close to the plane's
oval windows.
They make love in a wall-to-wall bed built into the rear of the jet.
The camera moves past the couple through one of the plane's windows,
and the clouds begin to rain.
UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT.
DAY.
YURI carries AVA over the threshold of their new home to cheers of
the assembled GUESTS.
ANATOLY and IRINA gape in amazement at the grand house.
They draw
their son aside.
ANATOLY
(touching his yarmulke)
Always remember, son, there's something
above you.
YURI
(looking up, gently joking)
Sure, Dad.
A forty-thousand dollar crystal
chandelier.
Anatoly forces a smile.
Irina presses a gift into Yuri's hand.
YURI (cont'd)
Mom, we don't need anything.
IRINA
You need this.
Irina takes Anatoly's arm, they walk away.
Yuri, alone for a moment, opens the package - a small Roman Catholic
Bible, conveniently bookmarked at the Ten Commandments.
DISSOLVE TO:
UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT.
DAY.
A newborn baby boy, NICOLAI, plays in the wrapping paper of opened
gifts beneath an extravagantly-decorated Christmas tree.
New York - December 25, 1991
YURI (V.O.)
I was still living way beyond my means,
mortgaged to the hilt, using one credit card
to payoff another.
Anything to keep Ava in
the style to which she had, thanks largely
to me, become accustomed.
Then suddenly all
my Christmases came at once.
A family Christmas - Anatoly, Irina and Ava open gifts.
Baby Nicolai
wriggles on a blanket, trying to reach a piece of tinsel.
ANATOLY
(to Irina, regarding a nativity
scene on a Christmas card)
Jesus was Jewish.
You're worshipping a Jew.
Irina ignores him.
She regards a gift - a silver goblet set from
Tiffany's.
IRINA
Ava, this is too much.
AVA
Yuri likes to spoil you.
Nicolai crawls an inch.
AVA beams proudly.
AVA
Nicki!
You did it.
Good boy!
ANATOLY
That's my grandson.
Ava looks around for Yuri.
AVA
(calling out)
Yuri.
Don't you want to see what your son
is doing?
No reply.
Ava wraps the piece of tinsel around the baby's head.
A loud shout from the other room.
YURI (O.C.)
Tak!
Tak!
Tak-fucking-tak!
(subtitle:
Yes!)
Ava scoops up the baby.
With Anatoly and Irina, they go to
investigate.
On the television, MIKHAIL GORBACHEV, is making his famous speech,
officially ending the Cold War.
Yuri kneels in front of the TV as if it is an altar.
ANATOLY
What the hell's the matter?
YURI
It's over!
It's over!
AVA
What's over?
YURI
The Cold War, the Soviet Union, the Evil
Empire.
Mikhail's saying "no mas".
He's
throwing in the towel.
It's over.
Yuri kisses Ava, Nicolai, Anatoly, Irina, kisses the TV.
AVA
That's nice.
(referring to Nicolai)
Your son is crawling.
Yuri's too busy kissing Gorbachev's birthmark.
He gazes at the TV, revelling in the plan taking shape in his head.
LATER
In the living room, AVA and IRINA play with NICOLAI.
YURI and
ANATOLY drink Johnnie Walker Black label.
ANATOLY
(contemplating the day's events)
At least there'll be religious freedom.
YURI
I think I'll go back for a visit.
(trying to sound casual)
Do you stay in touch with Uncle Dmitri?
ANATOLY
(face lighting up)
Dmitri Volkoff?
Now and then.
YURI
How is he?
ANATOLY
The luckiest man alive.
You know he was one
of the first men at Chernobyl.
Off-duty, at
his daughter's wedding, he was roaring
drunk.
He was the only one who survived.
Later they found that alcohol in your blood
resists radiation.
YURI
He's still a General in the army?
ANATOLY
Major General.
He got promoted.
Two of his
rivals were also there that day.
I told you
- he's the luckiest man alive.
YURI
He may be luckier than you think.
Yuri goes to pour himself a drink.
Anatoly grabs his son's hand the
way he did many years earlier.
ANATOLY
(lowering his voice)
We're not fools, Yuri.
What's between you and
your wife is your own business but I don't
think you're going to Odessa to open a
McDonald's.
(meeting his son's eye)
Is this how you want to be remembered?
YURI
(shrug)
You're only remembered when you're dead.
Yuri knocks back his vodka, tries to lighten the mood.
YURI (cont'd)
I'll bring you back some caviar.
ANATOLY
It's not kosher.
A crash.
VITALY and a call-girl, ANGEL, dressed in a low-cut fairy
dress, stumble through the front door - both the worse for drink and
drugs.
VITALY
Merry fucking Christmas!
Angel laughs.
The family gazes at Vitaly and his friend, appalled.
ANATOLY
(paternal)
Vitaly, who is this?
ANGEL
Angel.
VITALY
Her name really is Angel.
She's a fairy.
(hoisting Angel)
Let's stick her on top of the Christmas
tree.
Vitaly and Angel laugh.
No one else does.
Vitaly collapses on the floor.
Nicolai cries.
VITALY (cont' d)
(at a loss for anything better)
I love you all.
Yuri firmly escorts Angel to the door and pays her off.
UPPER EASTSIDE APARTMENT.
DAY.
AVA and NICKI kiss YURI goodbye.
PUBLIC STORAGE FACILITY - MANHATTAN.
MORNING.
YURI enters a public storage facility, opens a locker with a
combination lock.
YURI (V.O.)
There's no problem leading a double life.
It's the triple and quadruple lives that get
you in the end.
He produces several passports from the locker, shuffles the
passports like playing cards.
YURI (V.O.)
Back then I carried a French, British, Israeli and
Ukrainian passport and a student visa for the
U.S., but that's another story.
The locker also contains five identical briefcases - presumably he
can tell them apart.
YURI (V.O.)
I also packed five different briefcases
depending on the region of the world I was
visiting.
ODESSA MILITARY BASE - OFFICE.
DAY.
YURI has a stack of VCR's, cartons of cigarettes, Johnnie Walker
Black Label on the table in front of DMITRI who drinks from his hip
flask throughout the conversation.
DMITRI
I can't just sell you government property,
Yuri.
I have to report--
YURI
--Report to who?
Moscow?
As of last week
Moscow is in a foreign country.
DMITRI
(shrug)
New flag, new boss.
YURI
There is no new boss yet.
They're too busy
squabbling over who gets the presidential
holiday home at the Black Sea.
Dmitri can't deny it.
YURI (cont'd)
(talking like an evangelist)
It's beautiful.
The ones who know don't
care any more.
The ones who care don't
know.
(nodding to a safe built
into the floor)
Show me your inventory.
Dmitri hesitates, knocks back his vodka, then opens the safe -
produces a document.
ODESSA MILITARY BASE - ARMORY.
DAY.
Crates of machine guns from floor to ceiling.
DMITRI gives YURI a
tour of the armory.
YURI
How many Kalashnikovs do you have?
DMITRI
(referring to the inventory in
his hand)
40,000.
YURI
(looking over Dmitri's shoulder)
Is that a "4"?
It doesn't look like a "4"
to me.
It looks more like a "1".
DMITRI
(missing the point)
No, it's a "4".
YURI
It's whatever we say it is because no one
else knows the difference.
Dmitri finally gets it.
Yuri examines a Kalashnikov.
YURI (cont'd)
10,000 Kalashnikovs for a battalion.
Your
stocks are dangerously depleted, Dmitri.
You should order more from the factory.
This is too much for Dmitri.
He stops, confronts Yuri - takes back
the AK-47 Yuri is inspecting.
DMITRI
Someone will work this out, Yuri.
What
happens then?
YURI
(shrug)
We'll cut them in.
Anyway, what could
happen - you're the luckiest man alive.
ODESSA HOTEL BAR.
NIGHT.
YURI and SIMEON sit at a table near the back of the bar.
Yuri flirts with
the BARMAID delivering drinks and a shellfish appetizer.
BARMAID
(to Yuri, impressed)
You sell guns?
YURI
Maybe you'd like to come to my room and see
my bazooka.
The Barmaid giggles and exits.
Simeon is clearly disquieted by the change in the balance of power or
maybe it's the bad early-nineties pop music.
His BODYGUARDS sit
at the table behind.
YURI
You look a little lost, Simeon.
Is the
world changing too fast?
SIMEON
I am here, aren't I?
YURI
Not all of you, I think.
Simeon's look begs explanation.
YURI (cont'd)
You've gotten so rich selling for the CIA,
you can't get that ideology completely out
of your head.
The empire was evil for too
long.
Simeon shrugs.
SIMEON
I can't deny, it takes some getting used to.
Last week we were trying to beat their
brains in and now we're going into business
together.
YURI
There's no place in gunrunning for politics
anymore, Simeon.
I sell to leftists,
rightists.
I'd sell to pacifists but
they're not the most regular of customers.
Yuri leans forward.
YURI (cont'd)
Of course, you're not a true internationalist
until you've supplied weapons to kill your own
countrymen.
Simeon regards the young man with a mixture of fear and admiration pours
himself another drink.
SIMEON
I understand you have Ukraine in your pocket
but there are the other satellite states.
Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Belarus.
Instead
of cutting each other's throats, it may be
more profitable to work together.
What do
you think?
Yuri smiles - the proposal is the victory he has been seeking.
YURI
I think you are the amateur now.
I think
you suffer from a philosophical disadvantage
- you have a philosophy.
I think you should
go with your instincts - your first
instinct.
Simeon is confused.
YURI (cont'd)
I am the same man who was not good enough
for you before.
I am not good enough for
you now.
Simeon blanches.
Yuri gets up.
Simeon holds his rival's arm.
SIMEON
The problem with gunrunners going to war is
there's no shortage of ammunition.
Yuri departs.
HOTEL ROOM - ODESSA HOTEL.
NIGHT.
YURI and the BARMAID never make it to the bed.
Still clothed, they bang
each other against the door of his hotel room.
YURI (V.O.)
Back then, it was all for sale...
UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT - MANHATTAN.
DAY.
A darkened bedroom.
AVA is fast asleep in her bed, curled up with
NICOLAI.
The phone rings.
Half-asleep, Ava reaches for it.
AVA
(still groggy)
Yes, I'll accept the charges.
We cut between the two sides of the conversation.
YURI
Ava--
AVA
Hey, baby.
(glancing to a clock - 3am)
You forgotten what time it is?
YURI
Sorry.
I, er...
(talking about anything other than
what's on his mind)
How was your audition?
AVA
(resigned smile)
They're going in another direction.
The
direction of someone who can act.
YURI
Don't say that.
You're good.
AVA
And you're biased.
Ava grabs her robe - goes to the balcony so as not to disturb
Nicolai.
AVA
(sensing something amiss)
Where are you?
Is everything okay?
YURI
Rough day at the office.
AVA
Come home.
We miss you.
YURI
Soon.
(more desperate than he intended)
How's Nicki?
AVA
Asleep in our bed.
It's lonely without you.
From a bar down the street comes the sound of gunfire - MOBSTERS
firing at other MOBSTERS escaping in a car.
Yuri tries to cover the phone but Ava overhears.
AVA (cont'd)
Yuri, what's that?
YURI
A party.
AVA
It's always a party where you are.
More gunfire interrupts.
YURI
I'd better go.
I just wanted to call--hear
your voice.
Kiss Nicki for me.
AVA
I love you.
But Yuri has gone.
HOTEL AFRICA - LIBERIA.
DAY.
YURI enters the hotel.
At the reception desk, two HOTEL PORTERS watch a small, portable TV
- CNN coverage of the O.J. Simpson trial - gruesome evidence photos.
HOTEL PORTER #1
(never averting his eyes from the
screen)
My God, he nearly cut off her head.
HOTEL PORTER #2
When I get to America, I will not live in
Brentwood.
The CONCIERGE hands Yuri a key.
HALLWAY / HOTEL ROOM.
DAY.
YURI goes to open his hotel room door - hears music from inside,
enters.
Two stunning LIBERIAN GIRLS sit naked on the bed bopping to
Madonna's lILike A Prayer".
YURI (V.O.)
In the most AIDS infested region of the
globe, where one in four is infected,
Andre's idea of a joke was to put a young
Iman and a young Naomi naked in my bed and
no condom within a hundred miles.
GLORIA
Hello, Mr. Yuri.
FAITH
We'd be happy to make you happy.
The two goddesses drape themselves around him.
GLORIA
Don't worry, we don't have anything.
YURI
How do you know?
FAITH
Do we look like it?
YURI
(fending them off but with little
commitment)
What if I have AIDS?
Don't you worry?
Gloria's lips gently touch his.
GLORIA
You worry too much.
Faith begins to unbutton his shirt.
FAITH
(sultry)
Why worry about something that can kill you
in ten years when there are so many things
that can kill you today?
Gloria's hands go to his belt buckle, start to unfasten it.
GLORIA
How can we make you happy?
With great reluctance Yuri reaches behind him and opens the door.
YURI
By leaving.
BAPTISTE'S PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE - MONROVIA.
DAY.
A Glock .45, Heckler & Koch .40 and a Beretta 9mm sitm on the ostentatious
mahogany desk in front of President of Liberia, ANDRE BAPTISTE - a few
pounds heavier, still wearing the same size uniform.
ANDRE JNR. watches
over his shoulder.
Andre Baptiste examines each handgun methodically.
In front of him, a pensive YURI, taking in his surroundings.
Half a
dozen gun-toting ELITE GUARDS keep an idle watch.
Several HOSTESSES tend
to a refreshments table.
On a nearby sofa, a LIEUTENANT flirts with one
of the hostesses.
Baptiste glances over to the Lieutenant, irritated.
YURI
(providing a commentary)
--that's the Beretta, comes with a 36
cartridge, easy-operating clip--
Baptiste tests the loading mechanism.
The Lieutenant on the sofa is still not paying attention.
Baptiste casually points the gun at the Lieutenant and shoots him in
the head - a large portion of his brain splattering across the
fleur-de-lis wallpaper.
YURI (cont'd)
(shocked)
Jesus, why did you do that?
Baptiste, clearly not used to having his actions questioned, turns
the gun on Yuri.
He's next.
BAPTISTE
What did you say?
Yuri, staring down the barrel of the Beretta, recovers fast.
YURI
(feigning anger, gesturing at the
gun)
Now you're going to have to buy it.
(grabbing the gun from Baptiste)
It's a used gun.
I can't sell a used gun.
Baptiste is taken aback.
He suddenly bursts into laughter.
BAPTISTE
A used gun.
That's a good one.
The other Officers laugh uncertainly.
The Lieutenant's body is dragged out - leaving a smear of blood
across the marble floor.
Baptiste, seemingly oblivious to the carnage he's wreaked, resumes
talking to Yuri, in a measured way as if he's discussing the sad
state of punctuality in contemporary society.
BAPTISTE (cant'd)
(confiding in Yuri)
There's no discipline with the young boys.
I try to set an example but it's difficult.
I blame the MTV.
Yuri nods, disguising his terror.
Baptiste, checking his Rolex Oyster, rises from his desk.
BAPTISTE (cont'd)
Let me show you something.
LIVING ROOM - NEW YORK APARTMENT.
NIGHT.
YURI enters the front door, drops his luggage at the door.
AVA, talking excitedly on the phone, hangs up, runs to greet him.
VITALY, in the background, cocktail in hand, with another dubious-
looking GIRLFRIEND, is examining another of Ava's paintings.
AVA
Yuri, I just got off the phone with the
dealer.
I sold my first painting.
Yuri and Vitaly greet each other with a nod.
YURI
(feigning surprise)
Fantastic.
Who bought it?
AVA
Someone important.
They want to remain
anonymous.
(asking in a way that does not
expect an answer)
How was your trip?
YURI
You know.
Same old, same old.
(quickly changing the subject)
Where's Nicki, in bed?
AVA
I'm sorry.
Poor darling.
He tried to stay
up.
YURI
I'll kiss him goodnight.
VITALY
(opening champagne)
This calls for a drink.
YURI
What doesn't?
AVA
(still giddy at the news)
My first painting.
I'm officially an
artist!
He watches Ava showing off more of her paintings to Vitaly and the
latest girlfriend.
YURI (V.O.)
I figured I was a patron of the arts and of
everything else Ava had tried and failed at
after modelling.
Acting, her own cosmetics
line.
I didn't sabotage her careers but I
can't deny it was convenient for me in
maintaining a low profile.
She was a
beautiful bird in a gilded cage.
BEDROOM - NEW YORK APARTMENT.
NIGHT.
YURI kisses his sleeping son, NICOLAI, now three years old.
He places a gift at the end of his bed - an expensive-looking
microscope.
At the same time he spies an object in Nicolai's toy box - a toy
gun.
KITCHEN / LIVING ROOM - NEW YORK APARTMENT.
NIGHT.
YURI tosses the toy gun in the trash.
VITALY, still in the kitchen, catches him - pretends he didn't see.
YURI
How are you, brother?
VITALY
(shrug)
You know, still the resident family fuck-up.
YURI
Someone has to do it.
They watch Ava in the living room sharing a joke with Vitaly's
girlfriend.
VITALY
She knows, right?
YURI
We don't talk about it.
Vitaly looks askance.
YURI (cont'd)
(shrug)
How many car salesmen talk about their work,
how many executives at cigarette companies?
And both of their products kill more people
every year than mine.
At least mine has a
safety switch.
If those guys can leave
their work at the office, why can't I?
VITALY
Shit, you're good.
You almost had me
convinced.
(to his girlfriend, knocking back
his drink)
We're going, baby.
LATER
Yuri and Ava are alone at the window, overlooking Central Park.
He
hands her a fresh glass of champagne.
YURI
(raising his glass for a toast)
To Manet, Monet...and Ava Cordova.
Ava grins, goes to drink when she notices two huge diamond earrings
laying at the bottom of the glass.
AVA
(gasp)
Yuri!
YURI
(shrug)
The trip went better than expected.
AVA
(fishing out the damp baubles)
Yuri, they're beautiful.
(flirtacious grin)
But what am I going to wear them with?
YURI
(flirting back)
I know just the outfit.
They kiss.
BEDROOM - NEW YORK APARTMENT.
NIGHT.
CLOSE UP on the diamonds dangling from AVA's ears.
She wears the
earrings and nothing else as she and YURI make love.
YURI (V.O.)
I didn't know how much she knew and how much
she ignored.
I was a good provider and as
far as she was concerned - loyal.
Despite
the other women, I always made love to Ava
as if she was the only one.
HELICOPTER - MANHATTAN.
MORNING.
From an unmarked helicopter, JACK VALENTINE and his INTERPOL AGENTS
shadow a Mercedes sedan as it weaves through midtown traffic.
SEDAN.
MORNING.
YURI rides in the back seat of the sedan, scouring the world affairs
sections of several newspapers.
A thought interrupts his homework.
He opens the sunroof a crack, spies the helicopter tailing the car.
He closes the roof.
YURI
(to the DRIVER)
Take Park.
HELICOPTER - MANHATTAN.
MORNING.
VALENTINE observes the sedan cruising through the heart of Yonkers.
VALENTINE
Where in God's name is he going?
Is he
lost?
PUBLIC STORAGE FACILITY.
MORNING.
With some reverence, YURI props Ava's painting against the wall of
his private sanctuary, then goes about his business - shuffling
passports, deciding who he will be.
COCKPIT - ILYUSHIN-76 CARGO PLANE.
DAY.
The cargo hold of an Ilyushin-76 cargo plane.
It's so overflowing
with weapons, many are strapped into the passenger seats.
Sierra Leone - 1999
YURI (V.O.)
I was now the best merchant of death alive.
I
didn't own my own plane.
I owned a fleet -
running guns into Liberia, Sierra Leone or the
Ivory Coast at least once a week.
Unfortunately, my friends at Interpol were
also starting to find West Africa on the map.
Most trips I had phoney paperwork.
If the
deadline was tight, I had no paperwork at all.
In the cockpit, an American PILOT and CO-PILOT keep an idle watch on
their instruments as they fly over the endless plains of Sierra
Leone.
YURI sits in the jump-seat, reading the Wall Street Journal.
PILOT
(to his co-pilot)
--Even taking into consideration the pay-off
to the parents, a week with a girl in
Burkina Faso is cheaper than a night with a
girl in Jersey.
CO-PILOT
Plus, they're cleaner--
PILOT
--and a lot of them speak better English.
CO-PILOT
(shrug)
Personally, I prefer a language barrier--
An unmarked military jet appears through the starboard window.
The
voice on the radio is familiar.
VALENTINE (O.C.)
--Charlie, Echo, India.
Descend for landing
on heading zero...two...nine.
The Pilot picks up the radio, looks to Yuri.
Yuri shakes his head,
dialling his satellite phone.
Yuri's call is answered.
YURI
(into phone, trying not to sound
too desperate)
Colonel Southern, it's Yuri.
Sorry to call
you on this number but I've got an Interpol
jet and--
The jet outside the window falls back.
A PENTAGON OFFICE.
DAY.
A mid-rank office dominated by a computer terminal.
We look over
COLONEL SOUTHERN's shoulder.
He is admiring a new medal.
Two other MEN
IN SUITS sit opposite.
COL. SOUTHERN
(into phone, measured voice)
I can't know you right now.
It's not a good
time.
Southern hangs up.
COCKPIT - ILYUSHIN-76 CARGO PLANE.
DAY.
YURI, hearing the response, explodes.
YURI
(gaping at the phone in disbelief)
Not a good time!
Suddenly machine gun fire strafes the Ilyushin - bullets tearing
through the fuselage, perilously close to Yurirs very combustible
cargo.
CO-PILOT
Motherfucker!
The jet appears again at the window.
VALENTINE
(radio)
--Charlie, Echo, India.
Comply immediately.
That was your last warning.
YURI
Where was the first fucking warning?!
VALENTINE
(radio)
Rock your wings if you intend to comply.
PILOT
(to Yuri, anxious)
I'm putting us down.
YURI
(incredulous)
You land and we're all going away!
I don't
have paperwork!
PILOT
(incredulous)
We're in a flying fucking bomb!
They're
firing bullets at our bullets!
Forget about
going away!
They shoot again, we're going
away for good!
I'm putting us down.
YURI
(knowing he's right)
Okay!
Okay!--Fuck!!
The pilot responds on the radio.
PILOT
(into radio)
This is Charlie Echo India.
Descending
on heading zero two nine.
The Interpol jet takes the lead towards a small airport.
Yuri surveys the
terrain below, getting his head back in the game.
YURI
(pointing out a narrow highway)
Not the airport.
There.
The highway.
It's
our only fucking hope.
PILOT
(concerned)
A pothole could set us off.
YURI
Don't underestimate yourself.
You're the
best, Tony.
The pilot doesn't buy it but reluctantly changes course anyway.
INTERPOL JET.
DAY.
From his own wingseat, VALENTINE observes the Ilyushin's detour,
landing on the highway.
INTERPOL PILOT
I can't land there.
VALENTINE
(to the pilot)
He can't get far.
I want a truck waiting on
the tarmac.
HOTEL AFRICA - YURI'S HOTEL ROOM.
NIGHT.
A weary YURI enters his room.
Sitting on the green sofa - bound and
gagged, face reduced to pulp, silver hair matted with blood -
SIMEON.
YURI
Jesus!
Simeon!
ANDRE JNR., a FLUNKY and his CHEERLEADERS appear from behind the
door, laughing at his shocked reaction.
YURI (cont'd)
Andre!
What in heaven is he doing here?
ANDRE JNR.
A gift for you.
Yuri stares into the old gunrunner's terrified eyes.
ANDRE JNR. (cont'd)
You got here just in time.
I was afraid he
would die before you got a chance to kill
him.
He offers Yuri a Beretta.
YURI
Me?!
ANDRE JNR.
Who do you think informed on you - cost you your
plane?
He came to meet my father, hoping to take
your place.
Yuri spits on Simeon.
YURI
You stupid old fuck!
ANDRE JNR.
(knowing smile)
He killed your man when he tried to kill
you.
Andre again offers Yuri the Beretta.
YURI
No.
ANDRE JNR.
(confused)
You want us to let him go?
YURI
No.
No.
I...
Andre offers him the gun a third time.
Yuri refuses it.
ANDRE JNR.
So you do want him dead.
You just don't
want to kill him yourself?
I understand.
Andre grabs Yuri and presses the gun into Yuri's palm, clasping his
own hand over Yuri's.
ANDRE JNR.
We'll do it together.
A bonding experience.
Andre forces Yuri's finger onto the trigger as he aims at the
terrified Simeon - eyes pleading.
Yuri attempts to pull his hand away but Andre is too strong.
ANDRE JNR.
You can stop if you want - but
you do.
Just say the word.
Andre stares at Yuri not Simeon.
ANDRE JNR. (cont'd)
Say, "stop".
Yuri opens his mouth but no word comes.
Andre presses Yuri's finger
onto the trigger.
The gun goes off.
A splash of blood across the sofa's green
upholstery.
The gunshot echoes around the room.
Simeon is very dead.
YURI
(quietly)
Stop.
Andre smiles.
ANDRE JNR.
(surveying the blood-spattered
room)
I'll get you another room with a nicer view.
HOTEL AFRICA - LIBERIA.
DAY.
YURI collapses on the bar - gestures to the BARMAN who immediately
pours a line of cocaine in full view.
YURI hoovers it up.
YURI (V.O.)
I started doing a lot of cocaine in West
Africa.
I wasn't medicating myself.
I was
simply playing catch-up.
I was constantly
dealing with people who are chemically
imbalanced without the aid of chemicals.
It's just a matter of etiquette.
It's rude
to act sane in a room full of lunatics.
The Barman nods to a patron at a corner table - a SEASONED FIGHTER
- no more than eighteen years old.
BARMAN
He bought you "brown-brown", Mr. Yuri.
YURI
(wiping his nose)
What?
BARMAN
"Brown-brown".
YURI
What is it?
BARMAN
(laughs)
A mixture - cocaine and gunpowder.
YURI
What does the gunpowder do?
BARMAN
It's magic.
They give it to the small boys
before battle - they do anything.
YURI
Some other time.
BARMAN
You have to try it at least once, Mr. Yuri.
The Barman starts chopping another line.
YURI
Why?
BARMAN
(laughing)
Because it's your gunpowder.
Sure enough the Barman pours the gunpowder from one of Yuri's 39mm
shells into the cocaine.
The SEASONED FIGHTER, assault rifle slung over his shoulder,
intimidating air, sidles up to Yuri - stares him down.
Yuri has no
option, does a line.
He washes it down with a swig from a vodka bottle, raises his glass
to the fighter.
The Barman puts on a Ukrainian folk song.
Yuri picks out one of the
PROSTITUTES in the bar, starts dancing.
He drunkenly dances with one PROSTITUTE after another - the dance
almost violent, the prostitutes flung aside, none lasting more than
a few seconds - caught in the arms of the other PATRONS.
To Yuri, the bar swims before his eyes.
The music stops.
Yuri, wild-eyed, looks at the stunned bar room.
YURI
(to no one in particular, whipping his
vodka bottle off the bar)
I'm going for a walk.
UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT.
DAY.
From behind the cover of a sofa NICOLAI shoots at an unseen foe, his
finger as the gun.
The camera pans around the room to find AVA in an armchair opposite
AGENT VALENTINE.
AVA
Hush, Nicki.
(to Valentine)
I don't believe you.
Valentine is unfazed.
AVA (cont'd)
Can you prove any of it?
Where is your
evidence?
VALENTINE
I was hoping you could help us with that.
(opens an old file containing a
copy of a newspaper clipping,
headlined, "Cordova
Disappearance" )
I understand your parents died tragically in
EI Salvador.
(meeting Avars gaze)
That regime has startling similarities to
several of the regimes supplied by your
husband.
AVA
Get out.
Valentine rises to leave.
Ava holds Nicolai, her mind reeling.
FASHION SHOW - NEW YORK.
NIGHT.
Impossibly thin MODELS strut along a transparent lightbox of a
runway, flanked by SOCIALITES and PAPARAZZI.
Projected on the wall behind them, the words, "FASHION AGAINST HATE
- Dress Not To Kill" and various images from the world's warzones.
Each outfit is enthusiastically applauded.
MASTER OF CEREMONIES
And now, one of the sponsors of tonight's
evening, former Miss World, Ava Cordova.
AVA appears from behind the wings in a designer gown.
She modestly
accepts the applause - gradually becomes aware of a projection on
her face.
She turns to see the projected image of a CHILD holding an AK-47.
When she turns back, tears are rolling down her face.
NEW YORK HOUSE.
NIGHT.
Back to us, AVA naked, sits on the end of her bed, clothes laid out
beside her.
YURI (O.C.)
Ava?
YURI, still carrying his suitcase, appears in the doorway.
He drops
the case.
YURI
Ava, what's wrong?
Where's Nicki?
AVA
(still with her back to us)
He's with your parents.
Yuri senses something very wrong.
YURI
Why aren't you dressed?
I thought we were
going out.
He finds a robe from the closet - gently places it around her.
She
pulls it off her shoulders.
AVA
(turning back to look at him)
I can't wear the clothes.
I can't wear the
jewelry.
I can't drive the car.
I can't
live in this house.
Everything1s got blood
on it.
Yuri pulls the robe back onto her shoulders, walks to the window.
YURI
Don't be so melodramatic.
Ava pulls the robe to her, follows Yuri to the window.
AVA
Of course I'm melodramatic.
I'm a failed actress,
remember?
We need to talk about it.
YURI
Why?
We never have before.
AVA
Now we do.
Yuri notices the Interpol business card on the bedside table.
YURI
These people - you can't trust them--
AVA
--I've talked to your parents.
Why do you
think they don't want your money?
They know
where it comes from.
We all know.
Yuri sighs, resigned.
YURI
I sell people a means to defend themselves,
Ava.
That's all.
I don't hold a gun to any
one's head and make them shoot--
AVA
--Yuri, I see the news.
Sierra Leone--
YURI
--I don't sell machetes.
AVA
--What do you think is pointing at the
victims when they use those machetes?
I see
the pictures.
Yuri, the guns are bigger
than the boys.
YURI
(angered)
There's nothing illegal about what I do.
AVA
I don't care if it's legal, it's wrong.
Ava meets his eye.
AVA (cont' d)
I can accept the drugs.
I can even accept
the other women.
I can't accept this.
Yuri looks away.
AVA
Please stop.
YURI
(looks back)
It makes no difference if I stop.
Someone
will take my place the next day.
AVA
Let them.
We have enough.
You're not that
little boy in Odessa anymore, lining up for
a loaf of bread--
YURI
--It's not about the money.
AVA
What is it?
He doesn't answer - perhaps he doesn't have one.
Ava looks out of
the window at their expensive view.
AVA (cont'd)
I feel like all I've done my whole life is
be pretty.
All I've done is be born.
I'm
not just a failed actress.
I'm also a
failed writer, failed artist, failed
businesswoman.
I'm not much good as a
mother.
Come to think of it, I'm not even
that pretty any more.
I've failed at
everything, Yuri.
(turning back to him)
But I won't fail as a human being.
I'm
leaving.
The words finally register with Yuri.
YURI
You can't leave.
I'll stop.
(as if trying to convince himself)
I'll stop.
Ava is skeptical.
He holds her, reassures her.
YURI (cont'd)
I've been thinking about it for a while.
A
lot, lately.
(as if trying to convince himself)
I'm making more from the oil and timber
anyhow.
(further reassurance)
I'll stop.
She interrogates his eyes for the truth.
AVA
(pleading eyes)
You will?
You promise?
YURI
(deadly serious)
Yes.
(changing the subject a
millisecond too fast)
Now get dressed.
We'll go out.
Ava picks up the dress off the bed.
Yuri gazes at her.
YURI (cont'd)
By the way, you're wrong about not being
pretty any more.
She turns back and smiles.
UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT.
DUSK.
YURI toys with his old BULLET pendant as he talks on the phone.
For once the spreadsheets in front of him deal with oil and timber.
YURI (V.O.)
Thank God there are still legal ways to
exploit developing countries.
With the cordless phone to his ear, Yuri wanders to the kitchen.
He
tosses the pendant down a trash chute.
Back in the den, Yuri punches a calculator as he continues his phone
call.
YURI (V.O.)
But the only problem with an honest buck is
they're so hard to make.
The margins are
too low.
Too many people are doing it.
Finally we are privy to the conversation.
YURI
(into phone)
--Impossible.
Two and a quarter?
I can't
make a profit at two and a quarter.
Why
don't you take my oil and I'll fucking pay
you?
Yuri hangs up, stares down from his apartment window.
Valentine's panel truck drives away.
LATER
Night has fallen over Central Park - criss-crossed by a necklace of
lights.
Yuri continues to stare out of the window.
He is perplexed by the sight of a diplomatic motorcade parked in front of
his building.
Before he can make sense of it, the house phone rings.
AVA enters.
AVA
(confused)
Yuri, the President of Liberia is in the
lobby.
Yuri, stunned for a millisecond, recovers with a smile.
YURI
(glance to his watch)
He's early.
LOBBY - UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT.
DAY.
ANDRE BAPTISTE is admiring his new uniform in a gilt edged mirror.
ANDRE JNR. is flirting with two TEENAGE GIRLS - residents of the
building.
The perplexed DOORMAN stares at the motorcade outside his
door - flashing lights on the police escort.
ANDRE JNR.
(to the girls)
--You should come to Liberia with me
tomorrow.
It is beautiful this time of
year.
TEENAGE GIRL
Liberia.
Is that on Long Island?
YURI, ashen-faced, hurriedly exits the elevator into the ornate
lobby - strides up to Andre Snr.
ANDRE JNR.
Yuri!
YURI
(nervous as hell)
What the fuck are you doing here, Andre?
ANDRE BAPTISTE
(hugging Yuri)
We're here for the peace talks at the U.N.
YURI
(pulling him out of earshot of the
curious Doorman, anxious whisper)
So at the same time you thought you'd drop
in on your arms dealer?!
ANDRE BAPTISTE
Is that what you still are?
You're a hard
man to get hold of all of a sudden.
YURI
I--
ANDRE BAPTISTE
--But now you mention it, we are doing a
little shopping while we're here - that is
if you open for business.
YURI
(anxious look past Andre to the motorcade
on the street)
They've got to be watching.
ANDRE BAPTISTE
(disdainful shrug)
Of course they blame me.
They always blame
me.
They are on a--
YURI
(unable to resist)
--hunt for a witch?
ANDRE BAPTISTE
(a smile, for once correcting
Yuri)
"Witch-hunt".
But I have been granted
diplomatic immunity due to the escalation
in hostilities.
(conspiratorial)
That is why I need you.
They are making
life difficult to re-supply.
It will
require a man of your unusual ingenuity.
YURI
I can't help you.
I'm sorry.
ANDRE BAPTISTE
(nods)
I understand.
He shakes Yuri's hand firmly.
ANDRE BAPTISTE (cont'd)
But you should know that our present
difficulties compel us to be unusually
generous.
Yuri realizes that Andre has placed a huge uncut diamond in his
hand.
ANDRE BAPTISTE (cont'd)
(hugging Yuri)
Farewell, Lord of War.
ANDRE JNR.
You still haven't brought me the gun of
Rambo.
Andre Baptiste and his son breeze out of the lobby.
UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM.
NIGHT.
YURI enters, sits in an armchair.
AVA and NICOLAI are cuddled on
the sofa - Ava reading him a fairytale.
AVA
(looking up from the book)
Was that about the oil or the timber?
YURI
Both.
Everything.
Ava smiles, carries on reading.
Yuri looks to his hand - we rack focus to the uncut diamond.
Yuri
gets up.
UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT - GARBAGE ROOM.
NIGHT.
YURI, still in his suit, stands in a dumpster, searching.
YURI (V.O.)
At four and a half months a human fetus has
a reptile's tail - a remnant of our
evolution.
Amongst a pile of rotten food he finds his necklace containing the
BULLET.
YURI (V.O.)
You can fight a lot of enemies and survive
but if you fight your biology you always
lose.
Yuri places the bullet around his neck.
NEW YORK APARTMENT.
MORNING.
AVA is fastening eight-year-old NICOLAI's coat, readying to go out.
YURI, half-dressed, appears in the hallway.
YURI
Hey, not even waiting to say goodbye?
I'm
leaving in ten minutes.
AVA
Sorry, Nicki has swim practice.
Nicolai kisses his father.
NICOLAI
Bye, Papa.
YURI
(hugging him)
See you, big guy.
Ava kisses Yuri.
AVA
(teasing him)
Personally, I'm glad you're going.
You've
been here so long you're starting to get on
my nerves.
YURI
(taking the teasing good-
naturedly)
This oil concession should be wrapped up by
Thursday.
I'll be back for the weekend.
We'll go somewhere - the sea.
AVA
That would be fun.
A thought occurs to Yuri.
YURI
You trust me, right?
Yuri's turn to interrogate her eyes.
Ava smiles.
YURI (V.O.)
She looked me directly in the eye the way
I've looked in the eyes of a thousand
customs officials, government bureaucrats
and footsoldiers from every law enforcement
agency in the world - and she lied without
flinching.
AVA
Yes, I trust you.
YURI (V.O.)
She'd learned from the best.
Ava gives Yuri a final kiss, hurries Nicolai out the door.
MERCEDES SEDAN.
DAY.
From the rear seat of a Mercedes sedan we observe YURI exiting the
apartment building and entering a waiting Mercedes sedan of his own.
AVA (O.C.)
(to the DRIVER)
That's him.
We reveal AVA and NICOLAI in the car.
Yuri's car pulls away and
Ava's car follows.
NICOLAI
(confused)
Where are we going, Mama?
AVA
It's a game.
NICOLAI
Like hide and seek?
AVA
Yes.
PUBLIC STORAGE FACILITY.
DAY.
AVA, NICOLAI in tow, approaches Yuri's locker.
She tries a combination - fails.
Tries another - fails.
A third -
same result.
YURI (V.O.)
I can put myself in Ava's place.
She might
have understood if the combination was the
last four digits of my social, my birthdate,
even her birthdate but not Nicolai's.
Ava looks to Nicolai, tries one more combination, reluctantly.
CLOSE ON the numerals on the lock - "10...6..."
YURI (V.O.)
My son's birthday unlocked what the government
would later describe as, "a catalogue of
carnage".
"90".
The lock opens.
AVA
(whisper, to herself)
Not that.
Not that, Yuri.
Ava opens the storage room door - at first struck by the exhibition
of her paintings inside the locker.
Shaking the image from her
head, she turns her attention to the briefcases and other documents.
She shuffles through the passports in horror - different photos of
Yuri, different names: "George Eagleman", "Georges D'Aigle", etc.
Who
is her husband?
Is he any of them?
"THE CRIMEAN" RESTAURANT - DAY.
VITALY is back at work in the kitchen of the family restaurant.
YURI approaches - Vitaly senses something amiss.
VITALY
Come to see how the other half lives?
YURI
I miss your borscht.
Mom and Dad say you're
clean.
VITALY
You too.
They said you went legitimate -
hard to believe.
YURI
That's because it's not true.
Vitaly is hardly surprised.
Yuri glances to his parents, ANATOLY and IRINA, at the restaurant
counter, folding napkins - observing their two sons.
They avert their eyes.
YURI
Only you know.
I'm leaving tonight - on a
job.
I want you to come.
VITALY
I can't.
I'm thinking of opening my own
place.
YURI
Maybe this trip will help.
It's good money.
VITALY
(looking to his parents)
I've given my word.
YURI
They don't have to know.
We'll tell them
we're going for a little "r" and "r".
VITALY
Why do you need me all of a sudden?
YURI
West Africa's fucked-up.
(off Vitaly's look)
More than usual.
I can't trust anybody.
I
need someone to watch my back.
The notion touches Vitaly.
Yuri closes the deal.
YURI (cant'd)
"Brothers in arms".
Vitaly looks to his PARENTS.
They stare at him until he averts his
eyes.
Vitaly can't refuse his brother.
TRUCK.
DAY.
The prongs of a hammer on a box of grenades.
VITALY is prying open
the lid.
Andre Jnr. appears behind him - M60 poised ominously on his hip.
ANDRE JNR.
What are you doing?
VITALY
Something for Yuri.
ANDRE JNR.
Step away - slowly.
Vitaly closes the lid - a ruse.
He picks up the hammer and in one
sudden, violent motion swings it across Andre's face, smashing his
jaw, teeth flying, Andre's body flopping like a rag doll.
Vitaly grabs two grenades from the box, pulls the pin from one and
bowls it into the truck.
He runs.
The truck explodes in a fireball - instantly incinerating Andre Jnr.
Yuri's head whips around.
The Rebel Leader's head whips around.
YURI
Vit!!
Vitaly dashes for the second truck.
The REBEL LEADER opens fire, raking Vitaly with machine-gun fire -
still trying to run with legs torn to shreds.
YURI (cont'd)
No!!
A second hail of gunfire - all REBELS firing.
Vitaly's legs betray
him.
He collapses to the ground in a pile of blood and dust.
We focus on Vitaly's still FACE - he has taken enough bullets to
kill him three times over.
But he is not quite dead.
Agonizingly slow, he raises the grenade hand to his mouth - pulls
the pin with his teeth.
CLOSE on Vitaly's HAND, trying to summon the strength to throw the
grenade.
A hand appears, grasps Vitaly's hand - gently but firmly removing
the grenade.
YURI.
The Rebels keep their guns trained on Yuri, unsure where his
loyalties lie.
Yuri holds the fate of the camp in his hands - he
could still toss the grenade, destroy the second truck, sacrifice
his life.
Yuri stares to his brother and then to the grenade in his hand.
He
reaches down and delicately takes the pin from between Vitaly's
lips.
The eyes of the brothers meet for the last time.
Yuri inserts the
pin into the grenade, disarming it - the life goes from Vitaly's
eyes forever.
Yuri removes any last doubt by tossing the disarmed grenade to the
Rebel Leader.
Yuri walks away from Vitaly's dead body and returns to the
negotiating table - Yuri now the living dead.
The Rebel Leader
looks to the two trucks - one burning, one not.
He removes half of
the diamonds from the table.
REAR OF TRUCK.
DAY.
A lone gun crate, emptied of its contents has been put to use as
VITALY's makeshift coffin.
YURI (V.O.)
Coffins are hard to come by in Sierra Leone.
Demand is so high.
Fortunately, we had a lot
of boxes just the right size.
J.F.K. AIRPORT - CUSTOMS BAY.
DAY.
CLOSE ON the screen of an X-RAY machine.
Innocuous oversize cargo
passes in front of the screen - a surfboard, a double bass, then the
crate containing VITALY's body.
YURI (V.O.)
For twenty Monrovian dollars a doctor removed the
lead from Vitaly's body and wrote a bogus death
certificate.
I should have paid more.
The OPERATOR of the machine, stops the conveyor belt.
YURI (V.O.)
I've smuggled millions of rounds of
ammunition and the bullet that lands me in
jail is found under my dead brother's rib.
In Vitaly's chest, a bullet.
J.F.K. AIRPORT - CONVEYOR BELT.
DAY.
The other oversize items move down the conveyor belt for collection
- YURI waits with two burly PORTERS.
No other items are appearing - finally the coffin containing VITALY.
Two ATF AGENTS appear behind Yuri.
AGENT
(flashing some ID)
Yuri Orlov, we're with the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
YURI
(resigned smile, regarding the
insignia on their jackets)
Believe it or not, I only use the first two.
The agents are not amused - handcuff Yuri.
AGENT
You have the right to remain silent.
Use
it.
They march him away.
NEW YORK APARTMENT.
DAY.
A phone rings.
AVA, out in the hallway, surrounded by suitcases, looks to the
phone, senses the identity of the caller.
She hustles NICOLAI out of the door, closes it behind her.
The
phone continues to ring.
MANHATTAN CENTRAL JAIL.
DAY.
YURI, on a payphone, in the jailhouse corridor, reluctantly hangs
up.
He makes another call.
"THE CRIMEAN" RESTAURANT - BRIGHTON BEACH.
DAY.
ANATOLY, lighting a candle, picks up the phone.
ANATOLY
"Crimean Restaurant".
YURI (O.C.)
Papa?
Anatoly looks at the telephone receiver in his hand - without
another word he passes the phone to IRINA.
ANATOLY walks away.
IRINA
(into phone)
Both my sons are dead.
INTERVIEW ROOM.
DAY.
CLOSE ON a SLUG in an evidence bag tossed onto a table - by VALENTINE.
The
Agent can scarcely contain his excitement.
YURI sits at the small table, stares at the slug.
VALENTINE
One of yours?
Yuri doesn't take the bait.
Two other AGENTS sit at the back of the room observe the
interrogation.
VALENTINE (cont'd)
(referring to a document)
Curiously, the death certificate says he
died of heart failure.
YURI
(shrug)
Maybe he did.
(referring to the slug)
If I saw one of those coming at me, l'd have
heart failure.
The flippant comment gets under Valentine's skin but he keeps his
temper in check.
VALENTINE
We performed the autopsy and released your
brother's body to your family.
You tried
to do something decent, Yuri.
You went
against your nature.
And now it's cost you.
(unable to resist)
Your brother's funeral is looking a lot like
your funeral.
YURI
Falsifying a death certificate?
That's not
going to hold me.
VALENTINE
You're right, as usual.
Yuri not so cocky now - waits to see where this is going.
VALENTINE (cont'd)
(putting a copy of the New York
Times in front of Yuri)
Have you seen today's paper?
A front photograph of VALENTINE posing beside Yuri's documents including
his five BRIEFCASES.
The headline reads, "MERCHANT OF DEATH IN CUSTODY".
Caption - "Catalogue of carnage."
VALENTINE (cont'd)
(pacing, lauding it over Yuri)
Fake end-user certificates, cut-out
companies, all meticulously catalogued.
There's hardly a dictator, warlord or despot
anywhere in the world you aren't on first
name terms with.
(producing another evidence bag
containing Ava's diamond earrings
and an engagement ring)
Your trophy wife gave us the prize.
She
also provided us with these - which we
suspect are conflict diamonds.
Yuri takes all this in.
VALENTINE (cont'd)
She has agreed to testify against you.
Yuri nods - picks up the newspaper.
But instead of reading about
his own front page news, he opens the paper, turns to World Affairs
- various items on the warzones at the end of the millennium.
Yuri reads, takes his time.
Valentine cannot believe his audacity.
Finally Yuri reacts.
A broad smile - his killer smile.
YURI
Enjoy it.
VALENTINE
(confused)
What?
YURI
This.
Tell me that I am everything you
despise, that I am the personification of
evil, that I'm responsible for the breakdown
of the social fabric of society and world
order, that I am a one man genocide.
Say
everything you want to say to me now -
because you don't have long.
Valentine is infuriated by Yuri's casual demeanor.
VALENTINE
Are you not paying attention or are you
delusional?
You've broken every arms
embargo written.
There's enough in those
briefcases to buy you consecutive life
sentences.
You'll spend ten years going
from a cell to a courtroom before you even
start doing your time.
Yuri is looking away, apparently completely unconcerned.
His
attitude further angers Valentine.
VALENTINE (cont'd)
You don't seem to fully appreciate the
seriousness of your situation!
YURI
(snapping back - his emotion
finally showing)
My family has disowned me.
My wife and son
have left me.
My brother is dead.
Trust
me, I fully appreciate the seriousness of my
situation.
But I promise you I won't spend
a single second in a courtroom.
Valentine laughs derisively.
VALENTINE
You are delusional.
Yuri is still unfazed.
He leans forward to close the deal.
YURI
I like you, Jack.
Well, maybe not.
But I
understand you.
You feel your loyalty to
your badge has finally been rewarded.
But
you haven't counted on the people who gave
you that badge.
Valentine's turn to hesitate.
YURI (cont'd)
(meeting Valentine's gaze)
Let me tell you what's going to happen so
you can prepare yourself.
Yuri nods to the interview room door.
YURI (cont'd)
Soon there's going to be a knock on that
door and you're going to be called outside.
A montage of scenes - Yuri's prediction plays out accompanied by his
commentary.
INTERVIEW ROOM.
DAY.
A knock at the door and an AGENT nods to VALENTINE.
YURI (O.C.)
In the hall there will be a man who
outranks you.
HALLWAY - JAIL.
DAY.
Sure enough, a decorated military OFFICER talks to VALENTINE in the
hallway as Yuri describes.
YURI (O.C.)
First, he will compliment you on the fine
job you've done, how you're making the world
a safer place and then he is going to tell
you that I am to be released.
We observe valentine's reaction - vigorously arguing with his
superior.
YURI (O.C.)
You are going to protest, you will probably
threaten to resign.
The Officer, still turned away from us, tries to calm Valentine.
HALLWAY - JAIL.
DAY.
The door to the interview room opens.
YURI (O.C.)
But in the end I will be released.
Yuri exits the cell to freedom.
We return to the present.
INTERVIEW ROOM.
DAY.
VALENTINE's eyes burn into YURI.
YURI
(glancing to the open newspaper)
The reason I'll be released is the same
reason you think I will be convicted.
I do
rub shoulders with the most vile, sadistic
men calling themselves leaders today.
(referring to the newspaper)
But some of those men are the enemies of
your enemies.
Valentine is starting to get a sick feeling.
YURI (cont'd)
And while the biggest arms dealer in the world
is your boss, the President of the United
States - who ships more merchandise in a day
than I do in a year - sometimes it's
embarrassing to have his fingerprints on the
guns.
Sometimes he needs a freelancer like me
to supply opposition forces he can't be seen
supplying.
You call me evil, but,
unfortunately for you, I am a necessary evil.
There is a long silence.
Then,
A KNOCK AT THE DOOR.
Valentine and Yuri exchange a look.
Valentine rises from the desk.
VALENTINE
I would tell you to go to hell.
But I think
you're already there.
Valentine turns on his heel.
He is at the door when Yuri finally
replies.
YURI
What if I'm not?
What if I sleep fine at
night?
What if I sleep better than you? I
think that's what truly scares you.
Valentine doesn't look back, exits.
Sure enough, the Officer is in
the hall as Yuri predicted - COLONEL SOUTHERN.
NONDESCRIPT SEDAN.
DAY.
YURI rides alone with the briefcase on his lap.
YURI (V.O.)
Most people are happy just to get out of
jail.
I expect to be paid to leave.
Yuri opens the case - BALES OF CASH.
YURI (V.O.)
I'm not a fool.
I know that just because they
need me one day doesn't mean they won't make
me a scapegoat the next.
But I was back doing
what I do best.
DAY.
A checkpoint in the desert - the fence a literal line in the sand.
YURI accompanies a convoy of trucks.
He is joking with a BORDER
OFFICER - back to doing what he loves.
The Border Officer inspects the crates in a truck, reads the
manifest marked, "UMBRELLAS - QTY: 4,040 units".
BORDER OFFICER
(skeptical)
Umbrellas - to Saudi Arabia?
YURI
Sun umbrellas.
Yuri hands the Officer a plain, brown paper bag.
The Officer looks inside
- a wad of cash.
BORDER OFFICER
Have a safe trip.
The Officer waves the convoy through.
