We see a clean moving POV illuminated by headlights.
We're
floating down an old two-lane highway through a desolate,
desert landscape.
This gliding, eerie POV continues as
credits roll. when the credits end, the headlights seem to
dim and soon we're moving through BLACKNESS.

Renee in a bathrobe, opens the front door to collect the
mail.
She sees a plain, clean, manila envelope lying on the
step.
She picks it up.
CLOSE UP ON THE ENVELOPE - No stamp, no writing, blank.
She
takes the mail from the box, and goes back into the house.
CUT TO:
Renee finds another envelope on the doorstep.
She opens it,
pulls out a videotape.
A large dog is BARKING incessantly
somewhere in the neighborhood.

she can see the dog.
CUT TO:
THE MADISON HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY
Ed and Al are standing by an unmarked police car with Fred
and Renee.
The Detectives are about to depart.
AL
We'll keep a watch on the house.
ED
As best we can.
AL
If anything else happens, you'll call us.
Al hands Fred a card.
Ed hands Renee a card.
RENEE
We will.
FRED
Thanks, guys.
ED
It's what we do.
Ed and Al get into the car and drive off.
Renee and Fred
look at each other, warily, then go back into the house.
THE

VIDEOTAPE.
FADE OUT:

Fred and Renee's car pulls up in front of their house.
Fred
jumps out of the car.

Fred enters the house, careful to turn off the alarm first.
CUT TO:
Renee is standing next to the car, shivering.
FRED
I told you to stay in the car!
RENEE
Why? what is it?
Why did you make me
wait out here?
FRED
I thought there might be somebody inside.
RENEE
Was there?
FRED
No... of course not.
They enter the house.
CUT TO:
We are in back of the house tracking slowly past the bedroom
and living room windows. Inside the house, INVESTIGATORS and
FORENSIC EXPERTS are moving around, measuring, scraping
samples of carpet, searching for fingerprints on furniture.
CUT TO:
There is a "For Sale" sign posted in front.
The camera pans
slowly as in the videotape across the front of the house.
The interior of the house is dark, but fleetingly we are
aware of movement, shadows inside.
CUT TO:
We see a clean moving POV illuminated by headlights.
We are
floating down an old two-lane highway through a desolate,
desert landscape.
This gliding, eerie POV continues until the
headlights illuminate a figure standing at the side of the
road.
This figure is a man, PETE DAYTON.
Pete turns,
unsettled, as he looks directly at us as we move closer to
him.
The ghost image of a house appears behind Pete.
There
is a girl, SHEILA, standing on the lawn in front of the
house.
She is afraid and is trying to communicate with Pete.
Pete doesn't seem to hear her and continues to stare directly
at us.
Now Pete seems to move toward us as we move toward
him.
His head fills the screen.
DISSOLVE TO:
We watch the sun rise outside the prison, ascending over the
strands of barbed-wire above the wall.
CUT TO:
Bill, Claire and Pete pull into the driveway of a bleached
out, 60's ranch-style house on a street lined with many more
of the same.
Bill and Claire get out of the car first, then help Pete out
and up into the house.
CUT TO:
An unmarked police car pulls up across the street from the
Dayton house.
In the front seat are the Detectives, Ed and
Al. Al, who is on the passenger side, is holding two
styrofoam cups filled with coffee.
Ed removes from his
inside jacket pocket a 5" x 7" photo of Pete Dayton, which he
props up on the dashboard so that it is visible for both
himself and Al.
Al hands one of the cups to Ed.
ED
Thanks, Al.
Al studies Pete Dayton's face in the photo.
AL
Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is
up to.
ED
Yeah.
Ed and Al sip their coffee and stare at the house.
FADE OUT:
FADE IN:
Pete Dayton is lying on a chaise lounge.
His forehead is
still swollen, but his eyes are less red.
He stares up into
the sky - a hot breeze blows over him.
CUT TO:
Pete slowly moves up to a sitting position, then stands.
He
stretches and walks around the yard feeling the dry,
unwatered lawn on his bare feet.
He walks over and leans over the neighbor's fence.
His eyes
fall on a plastic toy boat floating in b child's plastic
swimming pool.
He watches the boat as the warm breeze blows
it lazily in a circle.
A small plane drones overhead.
In the distance, a WOMAN finishes hanging out some wash and
goes in the back door of her house.
The slamming of her
screen door sounds a thousand miles away.
Pete continues to observe these seemingly peaceful
surroundings - but something doesn't feel right to him.
CUT TO:
Ed and Al sit in their unmarked police car watching the
bowling alley entrance and "V's" car.
FADE OUT:
CUT TO:
Pete fires up his souped up Camaro and listens happily to the
engine purring.
He eases the big Camaro out of the driveway
and blasts off down the street.
CUT TO:
Pete cruises into his parking place and cuts the engine.
ARNIE comes rushing toward him, sporting a big smile.
ARNIE
Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you,
Pete.
How are you?
PETE
(climbing out of the Camaro)
Feeling good, Arnie.
Ready to get to
work.
ARNIE
Wonderful, Pete.
Really wonderful.
Alotta people Pete... alotta people are

Arnie takes Pete by the arm and they go inside the garage.
CUT TO:
Ed and Al pull to a stop down the street from the garage.
Ed
kills the engine and they stare at Arnie's.
DISSOLVE TO:
A large black Mercedes 600 Pullman pulls into the garage.
CUT TO:
Ed and Al don't notice that Pete is in the big black
Mercedes, as it cruises past them.
CUT TO:
Mr. Eddy takes the big Pullman along the scenic Mulholland
Drive - cruising smoothly.
A silver-gray Infiniti is moving
up fast behind the Mercedes.
CUT TO:
The Pullman pulls off the street into Arnie's.
Mr. Eddy and
his assistants stay in the car.
Pete opens his door.
MR. EDDY
Wait a minute ...
Mr. Eddy takes out a couple of one hundred dollar bills and
puts them into Pete's hand.
PETE
Thanks, Mr. Eddy.
MR. EDDY
No... Thank you!... I'll be bringin' the
"Caddy" by tomorrow.
Mr. Eddy reaches into the glove compartment and takes out a
videotape.
He holds it out to Pete.
MR. EDDY (CON'T)
You like pornos?
PETE
Pornos?
MR. EDDY
Yeah.
Give ya a boner.
PETE
No thanks, Mr. Eddy.
Mr. Eddy tosses the tape back in the glove compartment.
MR. EDDY
Suit yourself, champ.
PETE
Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
MR. EDDY
You will.
CUT TO:
Ed and Al are staring at the Pullman.
They see Pete get out.
They notice the man driving the Pullman.
ED
You recognize that guy?
AL
Yeah... Laurent.
FADE OUT:
FADE IN:
Pete walks out his front door with a lunch box and jumps in
the Camaro.
He fires up the big engine and heads off for work.
Ed and Al follow.
DISSOLVE TO:
Ed is behind the wheel.
Al is in the passenger seat.
Ed is
looking at the Dayton house.
Al's head is bent, looking
down.
At first we hear nothing, then the sound of Al's piss
streaming into an empty coffee cup.
The camera stays on the
top of Al's head until he has completed the last few spurts
of his micturition.
Al's head comes up and he opens the
passenger side door and dumps the urine into the street.
He
closes the door and zips up his trousers.
CUT TO:
Ed and Al watch Pete get in his Camaro and drive off.
They
follow.
CUT TO:
Pete drives through the night - up Ventura Boulevard with the
"Cruisers".
He looks in the other cars and looks at the
GIRLS on the street.
He drives past "Tops", but doesn't see anyone he knows.
He turns off the boulevard and drives through San Fernando
valley neighborhood streets.
He pulls up in front of Sheila's house and honks his horn.
He lights a cigarette while he waits.
In a few minutes Sheila comes out and leans in the passenger
side window.
SHEILA
What do you want?
PETE
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
SHEILA
I don't know.
PETE
Come on... get in.
Sheila hesitates for a moment, then gets in.
CUT TO:
Pete and Sheila drive along dark streets.
PETE
Come here.
Sheila slides across and sits close to Pete.
Pete puts his
arm around her.
She takes a drag from his cigarette and puts
her head on his shoulder.
Pete pulls over into a dark shadow under a tree and stops the
car.
He cuts the engine, turns to Sheila and kisses her.
She
breaks away.
SHEILA
Why don't you like me?
PETE
I do like you, Sheila.
Sheila puts her lips up' close to his and whispers.
SHEILA
How much?
Pete kisses her and she kisses him back.
They start to feel
each other and Sheila takes off her tight sweater.
She's
wearing no bra and Pete begins to feel her breasts while she
unbuttons his shirt.
They continue to kiss hard throughout.
CUT TO:
Ed and Al are stopped a half a block behind Pete and Sheila.
They're watching the couple as they make love in the front
seat of Pete's car.
CUT TO:
Pete and Sheila are naked in the front seat.
Sheila clings
to Pete as they make love.
She's hopelessly in love with
him.
FADE OUT:
FADE IN:
Pete and Alice pull up to the cheap motel in Pete's Camaro.
Pete gets out and leaves Alice in the car.
She waits and watches him go into the office.
CUT TO:
Ed and Al are watching Pete and Alice.
They watch Pete come
out of the office and take Alice into one of the motel rooms.
ED
'Fucker gets more pussy than a toilet
seat.
Al shakes his head with anger mixed with a lot of envy.
CUT TO:
Ed and Al watch Pete and Alice leave the motel room, get in
the car and drive off.
Ed starts his car and he and Al follow them.
CUT TO:
Establish.
CUT TO:
Pete kick-starts his big Harley and roars angrily out of the
driveway.
CUT TO:
Pete rides his cycle fast through neighborhoods.
CUT TO:
Pete rides up the boulevard with the "Cruisers".
He spots
"V's" car parked at "Tops".
He pulls in beside "V's" car and shuts down the engine.
The
usual crowd is at the drive-in, including Sheila.
Pete goes up to "V" and Carl and says hello.
He lights a
cigarette and leans up against a steel pole supporting the
awning above.
"V" and Carl both notice that Pete is in a bad
mood.
Sheila is over with her girlfriends.
She hasn't seen Pete
arrive.
Suddenly Sheila looks over in Pete's direction.
She looks
like she's seeing something, yet not seeing anything.
She
keeps looking - staring.
Sheila's POV she sees "V", Carl and a lot of PEOPLE, but
Pete is not there.
Pete looks at Sheila.
He's unsettled and confused by her
staring, but not seeming to see him.
He watches her turn
away and take one of her girlfriend's hands - leading her out
to dance to the LOUD music.
Pete watches her dance.
Suddenly, he can't see her.
He
thinks maybe she may be dancing on the other side of the
building - out of view.
He moves to look and his head is
struck by a violent pain.
He grabs his head with his hand
and leans forward.
"V" grabs his arm.
"V"
You okay, man?
PETE
What?
"V"
You okay?... What's wrong7
Pete looks up at "V".
He doesn't seem to recognize him -
"V's" head is a featureless blur.
Pete shakes his head
trying to drive out the pain.
He looks over again for Sheila.
He sees her there dancing
with her girlfriend.
"V"
Pete... You okay?
PETE
Yeah.
Pete stands back up against the post - turns to "V" -
recognizing him.
PETE (CON'T)
I'm, okay... You okay?
"V"
Sure, I'm okay.
Some drunk GUYS move over to Sheila and her girlfriend.
They
cut in on the girls.
The guy with Sheila puts his hand
around her waist and pulls her against her will into a grind.
She tries to push him away, but he holds on tighter -
laughing with his buddy.
"V" and Carl look at Pete as he pushes off the post.
Pete
crosses quickly to the man dancing with Sheila.
He slams his
fist into the man's nose - almost snapping the man's neck in
the process.
The man goes down bleeding.
Pete attacks the other man who is turning toward him ready
for a fight.
He hits the man in the gut - the man's head
goes down and Pete brings his knee up cracking the man's
face.
The man's torso flies up with Pete's knee - then
continues on as the man falls to the floor.
Pete picks him
up, ready to hit him again, but the crowd pulls him off.
Pete stands and turns - pulsating with anger.
Sheila is
there beside him.
SHEILA
Where'd you come from?
PETE
I've been here.
You were lookin, right
at me.
SHEILA
I was?
PETE
Yeah.
Sheila sinks into his arms.
SHEILA
I didn't know you cared.
PETE
Come on.
Pete takes her to the Harley and they blast off.
CUT TO:
Ed and Al are staring silently at the motel and the Harley
parked out in front.
AL
What a fuckin' job.
ED
His or ours?
AL
Ours, Ed.
DISSOLVE TO:
Pete pulls his Camaro into the parking lot.
When he gets out
of the car, he hears a voice and looks.up.
ALICE
Up here... Come on.
Pete takes a stairway past a "Coke" machine and meets Alice
in front of a second floor room where the door stands open.
ALICE (CON'T)
I already got the room.
Pete follows Alice into the motel room and she shuts the
door.
CUT TO:
Ed and Al are parked across the street - watching.
DISSOLVE TO:
Pete drives up and parks his Camaro in the driveway.
When he
gets out of the car, he sees Sheila standing by the front
step.
She is looking in his direction, but doesn't seem to
see him.
She SUDDENLY turns and looks up the street - she
YELLS.
SHEILA
(total horror)
THERE'S SOMEONE WITH HIM!!
As she yells, she starts to look around wildly - then her
eyes follow the path the Camaro took into the driveway - then
the path Pete took to where he has been standing all this
time.
Her eyes find Pete and she stands by the front step.
PETE
(frightened)
Sheila?
She heads toward him.
PETE
Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin'
here?
SHEILA
You've been fucking somebody else haven't
you?
PETE
Sheila...
SHEILA
You fuck me whenever you want... You
don't call... Tell me who she is.
Sheila has come up and is grabbing Pete by the front of his
shirt.
PETE
Hey... Sheila.
SHEILA
What's the BITCH'S name?!
PETE
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
SHEILA
YOU'RE SORRY!!
PETE
Go home, Sheila.
Sheila starts beating him in the face and chest.
SHEILA
YOU'RE SORRY!! YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!
YOU'RE SORRY!!
She starts crying and hitting him harder.
SHEILA (CON'T)
FUCK YOU!!
Sheila's screaming is reverberating around the neighborhood.
INSIDE PETE'S MIND the SOUNDS are even LOUDER.
Bill comes out of the house.
Claire is behind him waiting on
the front porch.
Sheila beats Pete and trips him to the ground.
She is
sobbing as she tears at him.
PETE
Sheila... Stop...
SHEILA
FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
Bill comes up to Sheila and takes her gently by the
shoulders.
Sheila jerks around and looks up at Bill.
BILL
Why don't you two come inside and talk
things over quietly... Come on... Come on
in, Sheila.
Sheila gets to her feet - crying.
She looks down at Pete,
who remains lying on the front lawn.
For Pete, every word and every sound is LOUD and DISTORTED.
The DRONING SOUND returns.
SHEILA
(to Pete)
You are different.
BILL
Sheila...
SHEILA
(to Bill)
TELL HIM!
The phone inside the house starts to ring.
Claire turns in
the doorway and goes to answer it.
BILL
Sheila... Don't.
SHEILA
I don't care anyway... I'm sorry, Mr.
Dayton... I won't bother you or any
member of your family again.
Sheila runs off crying.
Pete and Bill watch her go.
Claire comes to the door.
CLAIRE
Pete... There's a man on the phone.
He's
called a couple of times tonight.
Pete pulls himself up.
PETE
Who is it?
CLAIRE
He won't give his name.
Pete walks slowly inside - stares at the phone and picks it
up.
PETE
Hello.
MR. EDDY
(phone voice)
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
PETE
Who is this?
MR. EDDY
You know who it is.
Bill and Claire have stopped in the living room - watching
Pete.
Pete is going crazy with Mr. Eddy on one end, and his
parents staring at him on the other.
He waves his parents
away, but they leave slowly and reluctantly.
PETE
Mr. Eddy?
MR. EDDY
Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
PETE
Okay.
MR. EDDY
You're doin, okay?
That's good, Pete.
PETE
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
MR. EDDY
I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.
Pete doesn't know what to say.
MR. EDDY
You sure you're doin' okay? Everything
all right?
PETE
Yeah.
MR. EDDY
That's good, Pete.
Hey... I want you to
talk to a friend of mine.
Pete can hear the phone being handed over to someone.
There
is a long silence.
Pete can hear breathing.
VOICE
We've met before, haven't we?
Pete freezes.
His mind is scrambling.
PETE
I don't think so.
Where was it that you
think we've met?
VOICE
At your house.
Don't you remember?
PETE
No. No, I don't.
VOICE
We just killed a couple of people...
PETE
What?
Pete can hear Mr. Eddy laugh in the background.
VOICE
You heard me... We thought we'd come over
and tell you about it.
Pete is getting pale with fear.
PETE
What's goin' on?
VOICE
Great question!! In the east ... the far
east... when a person is sentenced to
death... they're sent to a place where
they can't escape... never knowing when
an executioner will step up behind them
and fire a bullet into the back of their
head... it could be days... weeks... or
even years after the death sentence has
been pronounced... This uncertainty adds
an exquisite element of torture to the
situation, don't you think?
It's been a
pleasure talking to you.
Pete can hear the phone being passed again.
MR. EDDY
Pete... I just wanted to jump on and tell
you I'm really glad you're doin' okay.
The phone goes dead and Pete sits - fearfully pondering his
fate.
He hears a NOISE and turns.
Down at the far end of the hall he sees his parents staring
at him.
CLOSE UP ON PARENTS staring in the direction of the living
room as if sensing something, but not seeing.
PARENTS POV - The hall and living room beyond.
There is no
one there.
DISSOLVE TO:
A City Bus pulls up to the stop.
The doors open and Pete
climbs on.
CUT TO:
The bus stops and Pete gets out.
He starts walking.
CUT TO:
We see a street sign saying "Deep Dell Place".
Pete walks up
the street looking at numbers.
He finds 2224 Deep Dell Place - Andy's House.
He stares at the house from the sidewalk.
Lights are on upstairs and down.
The hot wind moves big
shadows of trees over the front of the house.
Pete looks at his watch.
It reads: 11:05 p.m.
He walks down the driveway, crosses through some bushes and
comes to a fence separating the front yard from the back.
He stops and listens.
He pulls himself up and over the
fence, but crashes on something on the other side.
He freezes - listening. He hears the wind blowing through
the trees, and distant music from inside - a slow jazz piece.
He hears echoing sounds of love making.
He makes his way around back - goes up the stairs and tries
the back door.
It opens.
CUT TO:
Alice takes Pete to Andy's car and throws him the keys.
ALICE
You drive.
Alice jumps in Andy's car and tosses the bulging pillowcase
in the back.
Pete takes the revolver out of his belt.
He
opens the driver's side door of Andy's car and slowly sits
inside.
He sets the pistol on the seat between them.
He
looks up at her.
She smiles wildly.
Pete slalms the door -
starts the car and they drive off.
CUT TO:
Alice and Pete pull up into the driveway of a house at the
end of a street at the edge of a desert.
Alice gets out into
a hot wind.
Pete stays in the car as she goes up to the
house.
Pete's POV: He watches Alice ring the doorbell.
She waits
in front of the door for a few moments, her hair blowing in
the wind.
A HOUSEBOY opens the door.
Alice says something to him -
Pete cannot bear anything that is said, even though his
driver's side window is down.
All he can hear is the hot
wind blowing.
The Houseboy moves out to where he can see Pete, waiting in
the car.
The Houseboy and Alice exchange information.
The
Houseboy points out toward the desert.
Alice turns back to
the car. The Houseboy watches her.
CUT TO:
We see the clean moving POV illuminated by headlights.
We're
floating down an old two-lane highway through a desolate,
desert landscape.
CUT TO:
Pete and Alice pull off the two-lane highway onto a barely
discernible dirt road that cuts through the dark desert.
CUT TO:
Pete and Alice drive up to a ONE ROOM CABIN built on stilts
next to a dry lakebed.
They both get out and go up the
stairs to a porch where Alice knocks on the door.
There is
no answer.
Alice opens the door, but there is NOBODY INSIDE.
ALICE
We'll have to wait.
The hot wind continues to blow.
Alice and Pete walk back down to the car.
The HEADLIGHTS are on and Alice reaches in through the window
and switches on the RADIO.
She can't get anything in but
static, with bits and pieces of old tunes fading in and out.
She hits the "seek" button.
The radio starts to search.
Pete is standing in the glare of the headlights watching her.
Alice walks slowly to him.
The camera captures this from a back seat perspective - then
drifts toward them.
PETE
Why me, Alice?
Why choose me?
The radio sticks on a particular tune - a tune filled with
longing. Alice begins to dance.
She takes Pete's hand and
pulls him close to her.
ALICE
So we can be together... You still want
to be with me, don't you Pete?
Alice gives Pete that wild smile.
ALICE (CON'T)
More than ever?
She kisses Pete over and over.
He begins to kiss her back.
She starts to move him in a dance to the music in the glare
of the headlights, the hot wind caressing them.
The scene is out of a dream.
Alice and Pete help each other
undress as they dance in and out of the light, and the wind
whips at their bodies.
They sink down on the soft ground and start making love.
The lights from the headlights combine with the starlight,
bathing them in a pristine glow.
The music fades and the radio begins to "seek" through static
for another station.
The music it finds now is LOUD and
INTENSE.
Alice - her hunger appearing, now becomes carnivorous in her
approach to love making with Pete.
She is the aggressor,
highly-charged - she wants more and more - taking, not
giving, insatiable.
The headlights flare their bodies in blinding light.
They
become amorphous, glowing shapes burning in the light.
Pete is trying desperately to please her - to have her.
The driving music fills with cracks of piercing static.
The
radio strains to hold the station.
Pete's white-hot body clings to Alice.
He chokes with
emotion.
PETE
I want you... I want you...
With a burning smile, Alice rolls them out of the beams of
light into the darkness.
The wind billows a black cloud of
dust around them.
Alice pulls away from Pete and brings her dark mouth to his
ear.
ALICE
You'll never have me.
Alice glides away from Pete and stands up looking down at him
from above.
She turns and walks, naked, to the cabin where she disappears
within it.
Pete turns, face down on the ground in the darkness.
He's
holding his head and shaking.
As he starts to stand - he turns into the glare of the
headlights and we see that it is NOT PETE - BUT FRED.
As Fred stands up, the car's LIGHTS DIM and the RADIO FADES.
Fred looks at the car.
He sees some movement inside.
Fred
looks closer and sees the figure of a man in the back seat.
CLOSE UP OF THE MAN - it's the Mystery Man from Andy's party.
VOICE FROM BEHIND
FRED
Hello.
Fred turns toward the cabin and sees the Mystery Man now
standing in the doorway.
Fred turns again to the car, but this time it's empty.
He
looks back at the cabin and sees the Mystery Man still in the
doorway.
MYSTERY MAN
Here I am.
Fred is dizzy with fear and confusion.
He pulls on his trousers and shoes and walks up the steps to
the cabin toward the Mystery Man, who goes inside.
Fred
stops in the doorway.
He looks around.
FRED
Where's Alice?
MYSTERY MAN
Alice who?
Fred looks around again but there is no one there except the
Mystery Man - standing in the center of the room.
Fred
stares at him.
MYSTERY MAN
(CON'T)
Her name is Renee.
If she's told you her
name is Alice, she's lying.
(filled now with anger)
AND YOUR NAME, WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR
NAME?!
Fred freaks, scared to death. He bolts down the stairs to
the car, stumbling more than once.
Fred attempts to start the car which is drained of electrical
charge by the use of the headlights and radio.
The Mystery Man appears in the doorway of the cabin.
He
starts toward Fred.
The starter motor moans as Fred twists the key frantically.
The smiling Mystery Man is almost at the car,
The engine catches.
Fred revs it - throws the car in reverse
and peels out away from the Mystery Man, whose hand is
reaching for him.
Fred swerves the car around - throws it in drive, and takes
off across the dark desert.
CUT TO:
Fred pulls up onto the two-lane highway.
An old, rusted
roadsign is posted there.
It reads: "LOST HIGHWAY".
CUT TO:
Fred is driving along the two-lane desert "lost highway".
The wind is picking up even stronger than before.
A big
storm is blowing in.
Fred sees a sign glowing just ahead that reads: LOST HIGHWAY
HOTEL.
The sign is swaying and blinking as the gusts hit it.
Fred pulls in and stops under the sign and stares at it.
He gets out of the car, tucks the pistol in his belt under
his shirt and enters the hotel, which is an old two-story
building.
CUT TO:
Fred is driving along the road.
Suddenly he pulls the car
off the road and drives over the dirt and brush to a deserted
spot, stops and gets out.
Fred opens the trunk. When he does ...
Suddenly, Mr. Eddy/Laurent charges up and attacks Fred -
knocking them both to the ground.
Mr. Eddy/Laurent tries to
strangle Fred, but Fred's anger is too great.
Fred tears
loose and gets Mr. Eddy/Laurent in a hold bending his head
back.
Fred's hand reaches out behind him - feeling,
searching.
A KNIFE appears.
it comes into Fred's hand from another.
Fred slices Mr. Eddy/Laurent's throat, and throws him down.
Mr. Eddy/Laurent squirms on the ground - his hand grasped
around his throat - trying to hold his neck together.
Blood
is flowing rapidly through his fingers and over the front of
him as be turns and opens his mouth with a gurgling sound.
Fred stands, facing him, his pistol out now - pointing right
at Mr. Eddy/Laurent's forehead.
CLOSE UP ON MR. EDDY/LAURENT - he lifts his head and stares
at Fred.
Blood is rushing out of him.
MR. EDDY/LAURENT
(wet and jagged)
What do you guys want?
The camera pans around to Fred - we see that the Mystery Man
is standing beside Fred, and it is the Mystery Man who is
holding the gun, not Fred.
The Mystery Man reaches into his pocket and pulls out a
little watchman TV.
He turns it on and hands it over to Mr.
Eddy/Laurent, who manages to take it.
Mr. Eddy/Laurent looks down at the small television screen.
Mr. Eddy/Laurent's POV: As he watches the TV screen, we move
in until the screen fills the frame - as with the former
videotapes.
The full frame of the TV screen reveals -
On the Watchman TV screen Mr. Eddy/Laurent sees an image of
Fred and the Mystery Man staring at him.
The Mystery Man's
image speaks.
MYSTERY MAN
(on TV screen)
Now you can hand it back to me.
Mr. Eddy/Laurent sees the Mystery Man's image reach out a
hand.
Mr. Eddy/Laurent looks up.
The Mystery Man has his arm
outstretched just as it was on the video image.
Mr. Eddy/
Laurent hands the Watchman back, and locks eyes with the
Mystery Man.
MR. EDDY/LAURENT
(wet and jagged)
You and me, mister, we can really out-
ugly the sumbitches, can't we?
The mystery Man unloads the pistol into Mr. Eddy/Laurent, who
jerks and dies in the dust.
The Mystery Man then leans close to Fred and whispers in his
ear.
The camera moves in, past the Mystery Man to a CLOSE UP OF
FRED'S EYES as he listens.
The camera cuts back wide to reveal Fred holding the gun.
He
is standing alone - there is no Mystery Man.
Fred turns to
go back to the car.
CUT TO:
Fred drives up to his house in Mr. Eddy/Laurent's Mercedes
600 Pullman and stops in front.
He gets out of the car, goes
to the front door and RINGS THE DOORBELL.
There is a BEEP sound.
FRED
(into intercom)
Dick Laurent is dead.
CUT TO:
As Fred finishes this sentence we see the cop car containing
Ed and Al pull in to the curb just up the street from Fred
and Renee's house.
CUT TO:
Fred turns and sees the cop car.
He jumps in his car, fires
it up, and peels out.
The cops give chase.
CUT TO:
Fred is behind the wheel of his car.
Behind him are the
cops.
CLOSE UP ON FRED'S FACE - through the front windshield.
The
shot is wide enough to reveal the cop car in hot pursuit.
Fred's face begins to change again, grotesquely contorting as
he races into the vortex.
His tormented SCREAM blends with
the howling SIREN of the police car gaining on him.
