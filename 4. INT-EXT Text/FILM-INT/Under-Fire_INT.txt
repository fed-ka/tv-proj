A door slams o.s. and the figure of RUSSELL PRICE, 30, appears
at the top of some stairs. Sleepy-eyed, he pulls on a multi-
pocketed fishing vest over a baggy shirt. He carries a beat
up canvas bag over his shoulder.
A BLACK WOMAN, 40, sleeps at the lobby switchboard desk.
Another OLD BLACK MAN sweeps the floor. Price mumbles a 'good
morning' and goes to two vintage WW II vending machines --
one for candy, one for Coca-Cola. He buys two candy bars and
a coke, and begins eating his "breakfast" as he crosses the
lobby.
CLAIRE STRYDER, 40, reads a report over the telephone as she
times the call with a stopwatch. A photograph of Claire's
high-school-aged daughter sits on her dresser.
ALEX GRAZIER, 50, struggles with his tie and a drink at a
dresser in the adjoining room. Their connected rooms are
littered with hand washed laundry and the paraphernalia of
their trade -- typewriters, tape decks, books, notes,
pictures.
Their love affairs of three years is ending.
CLAIRE
(on the phone)
"...and so this strange war that
features two provincial governments,
three rival liberation fronts, and
at least twenty-five tribal
associations, grinds into its seventh
year..."
Alex picks up a Melodica, a novelty wind instrument, and
tries to court her with "Caravan" as she files her story.
Though mildly put off, she maintains her cool throughout the
call. He thinks he's Paul Desmond.
CLAIRE
"...The Battle for the Airfield at
Abou Deia is just another chapter in
this endless story. From Ndjamena,
Chad, this is Claire Stryder."
(beat)
No -- you didn't hear any music --
must be the connection. Okay? So
long.
She hangs up and rises more irritated than angered.
CLAIRE
Alex, don't play that God damn thing
when I'm filing.
(beat)
We're late.
Quickly expressed, her anger passes.
ALEX
It's my party -- we'll be late. You
called it a "strange war" and an
"endless story." If you filed that
story for me, I'd say you were
editorialishing.
CLAIRE
I like to editorialize. You drunk?
Alex loves to be melo-dramatic and is quite conscious of his
ability to charm. He's also aware that it's worn off with
her.
ALEX
Drunk? Only with the memories of
making love with you on the plains
of Fianga as the first Army of
Liberation marched in and opened
fire.
CLAIRE
And freed the Proletariat.
Alex raises a drink.
ALEX
Right.
CLAIRE
I'm going to the party without you.
She leaves -- he quickly puts on his coat and follows her.
CUT TO:
ALEX
Christ, I don't want to go to this
stupid party. I'm bad at false
modesty.
CLAIRE
You're great at it.
She straightens his half-tied tie in an act of familiar
affection rather than motherliness. Nervousness. She speaks
calmly -- this is ground they have already covered.
CLAIRE
Alex, you're going to make a great
anchorman in New York and undoubtedly
I could be a Pulitzer Prize winning
hostess -- but I'm not going with
you.
ALEX
You can work out of the East Coast.
We'll get a place on Long Island and
burn our suitcases.
CLAIRE
I still like suitcases.
ALEX
Every Saturday night we'll have a
party... invite all our friends, sit
out on the veranda and interview
each other.
CLAIRE
I've done all that.
ALEX
I haven't.
(beat; changes tack)
Well, God dammit, I'm getting tired
of memorizing who's the president of
the... Republic of Maldives.
CLAIRE
Mamoon Abdul Gayoom.
ALEX
Yeah, he succeeded Mamoon Abdul
Gayeem.
They both smile slightly as the elevator comes to a stop.
The door doesn't open, and the light flickers.
ALEX
And I'm tired of Third World
elevators.
He bangs the door with his fist. It opens, and they enter a
dismal hallway. The sounds of a party come from beyond.
ALEX
Don't leave me.
CLAIRE
I already have.
As they approach the door to the party, he speaks with new
toughness.
ALEX
Fuck Abou Deia and New York. I'm
going to Nicaragua with you.
CLAIRE
No.
ALEX
I've heard it's a neat little war
with a nice hotel.
CUT TO:
A cheer goes up for Alex as he and Claire enter. Party hats,
booze, hand-made signs reading "Bon Voyage," etc. Fifteen
journalists of varying nationalities cover this backwater
war.
Though both upset, they act as if everything is normal.
PRICE STANDS ON A CHAIR AT THE CENTER summoning Alex who
moves through the group with ease, instantly at home. Price
holds up a bottle of champagne in toast.
PRICE
Alex, get up here!
Alex climbs on a chair next to Price who puts his arm around
him.
PRICE
To the man who gave me my first job,
and fired me from my first job...
and gave me my second job...
VOICE FROM CROWD
And fired you from your second job...
PRICE
Just a few words, Alex.
VOICES FROM CROWD
Impossible! Can't be done! etc.
However miserable, Alex shines in these situations. He raises
his hand -- silence.
ALEX
You may be asking yourself what
exactly are you doing here in this
"strange war, just another chapter
in an endless story... that grinds
into its seventh year..."
Claire slips to the side bar and pours herself a drink,
watching Alex and shaking her head with some affection.
JIMMY, THE CAB DRIVER, ENTERS WITH A CAKE covered with
candles. The crowd parts for the cake shaped like the country
of Chad. The crowd begins singing "Caravan" in a half-drunken
tribute to a man they like and respect.
PRICE MOVES AROUND THE ROOM TAKING PICTURES of the party; it
is all casual, silly, fun.
THROUGH CAMERA P.O.V.'S OF ALEX IN A PARTY HAT, whip pan to
CABBY WITH THE CAKE, whip pan to DRUNKEN JOURNALISTS.
THROUGH CAMERA P.O.V. OF CLAIRE -- FREEZE FRAME, pan follows
her as she moves through the room -- FREEZE FRAME, she picks
up another drink and leaves through a side door -- FREEZE
FRAME.
ALEX GIVES IN AND JOINS THE SINGING, enjoying his own tribute
once he has managed to give in to it.
CUT TO:
Claire's face is also covered with tears as she smokes,
wandering idly among clothespinned photos. A part of her
life is ending -- life with Alex -- but it's not ending
neatly.
A ROW OF HANGING PHOTOGRAPHS catches her eye. She stops and
looks closely -- then laughs in spite of herself at a series
of pictures: PHOTO OF A TALL AFRICAN NATIVE WITH A COCK SO
LONG IT IS TIED IN A KNOT; PHOTO OF A BEAUTIFULLY BREASTED
AFRICAN WOMAN; PHOTO OF SEVERAL POSING SOLDIERS; PHOTO OF A
PHOTO -- THE RANCH HOUSE WITH POOL; PHOTO SELF-PORTRAIT OF
PRICE BLOWING SMOKE RINGS; PHOTO OF CLAIRE AND ALEX IN HAPPIER
DAYS.
CLAIRE PULLS THE PHOTO OF ALEX AND HER from the clip and
looks at it.
THE DOOR OPENS, AND PRICE ENTERS
PRICE
Oh. I didn't know you were here.
CLAIRE
Sure you did. You were taking pictures
of me all over the room.
PRICE
Well... yeah... you looked great.
Why aren't you partying?
CLAIRE
In a minute.
He notices the picture she's looking at.
PRICE
I printed that up for Alex.
CLAIRE
It wouldn't be the greatest thing
you could give him right now...
(beat)
We just split up.
PRICE
Jesus, I'm sorry. Who left who this
time?
CLAIRE
I'm the villain... I thought it could
be a little cleaner this time -- me
in Central America, him in New York.
PRICE
That's pretty clean.
CLAIRE
But he's decided to go to Nicaragua
too.
PRICE
To cover you or the war?
CLAIRE
To cover everything.
Silence. Price moves behind her and gently kisses her on the
ear. She smiles quickly and nervously.
CLAIRE
No.
He kisses her on the neck.
CLAIRE
For godsakes, Russell, listen.
The sounds of the party can be heard. He ignores them and
moves around her, trying to kiss her on the lips. She puts
her hand over his mouth.
Price reacts strongly, flaring slightly and withdrawing.
PRICE
I don't want to wait for you again.
We've been circling each other since
the Montreal Olympics.
CLAIRE
You're a genius of bad timing.
(beat)
I'm going back to the party.
She heads to the door; Price stays. She stops before getting
there, hesitates, then pulls the PHOTO OF THE ELEPHANT from
the string and returns to Price, handing him the photo.
CLAIRE
This is a great shot.
PRICE
Thanks.
CLAIRE
I've heard the light in Nicaragua's
even better.
He doesn't respond. They stand for several moments -- the
sounds of the party get louder. She turns and heads to Alex's
celebration, leaving Price alone in the darkroom.
PRICE LOOKS AT CLAIRE AS SHE LEAVES, stares aimlessly for
several moments, then focuses back on his PHOTO OF THE
ELEPHANTS.
DISSOLVE TO:
NICARAGUA 1979
Overlooking Managua is a sub-tropical paradise that seems
far removed from a brutal civil war, this one time tourist
watering hole serves as home base to the international press.
The cab pulls up, and Price gets out. The driver unties his
luggage from the roof as TWO PRESS CORPS MEMBERS recognize
Price and greet him as an old friend.
CUT TO:
Corrugated metal roofs, thatched hut booths, a strange
combination of decorative and architectural devices. DAISY
WILLIAMS, a large black woman from Nicaragua, sings "I Left
My Heart in San Francisco" with a mediocre jazz group.
HUB KITTLE is present, and other journalists drop by the
table to say hello.
A BOY PHOTOGRAPHER, 13, aims an ancient bellows type polaroid
at a booth in which Claire sits between Alex and Price. They
are holding a pose indefinitely while the boy struggles with
the camera. They hold up the TIME COVER and a couple of beers
in celebration, and when he finally snaps the picture -- no
flash.
The boy puts the camera down disappointedly.
BOY PHOTOGRAPHER
(in broken English)
Sometimes it doesn't work.
The three journalists relax their pose.
PRICE
Let me look.
ON THE BANDSTAND Daisy has just finished "San Francisco" and
spots Alex, motioning to him.
DAISY
Ladeez and Gen'mun, hep me get Aaleex
ov' here...
Daisy applauds lightly for Alex to join them. Alex is equally
pleased and embarrassed.
ALEX
There's not many piano bars left
where I'm still welcome.
CLAIRE
Go ahead.
ALEX
If she can't sing in the key of C
I'm in trouble.
Alex excuses himself and joins Daisy on the bandstand. Price
and Claire are left alone in the booth as Price hands the
repaired camera back to the boy.
ALEX AT THE PIANO begins a slow, easy cocktail version of
"Stardust," the song of his generation perhaps, and he seems
happy, seduced by his own chords.
PRICE AND CLAIRE RESUME THEIR POSE, and this time the camera
FLASHES. Price pays for the picture from the boy.
At first there is a moment of awkwardness between them.
PRICE
Well...
CLAIRE
"Well"... you finished your assignment
in Chad?
PRICE
Got Africa all wrapped up and pouched
to my editor.
She smiles and relaxes a bit at the typical Price remark.
CLAIRE
You're going to love this war,
Russell... there's good guys, bad
guys, cheap shrimp...
(an afterthought)
And Alex is still singing in the
background.
(beat)
I missed you.
PRICE
We gotta get alone somewhere to talk.
ALEX BEGINS SINGING as he plays. He sings like a trumpet
player -- no voice but great phrasing. He half smiles as he
sings, enjoying the song and enjoying making them
uncomfortable.
ALEX AT THE PIANO
ALEX
Sometimes I wonder why I spend these
lonely nights, Dreaming of a song...
BACK AT THE BOOTH
CLAIRE
Jesus... he's doing it on purpose.
PRICE
Alex is one of the world's leading
experts on military strategy.
They don't really want to talk about Alex though his presence
is unavoidable. Price changes gears, gets slightly goofy,
and steers the conversation to more comfortable turf.
PRICE
Well, hell, I just got off the boat...
gimme the scoop on Nicaragua...
CLAIRE
Well... about sixty years ago the
U.S. Marines invaded to protect
American business interests and put
down a peasant revolt led by a little
man who wore a giant cowboy hat --
his name was Augusto Sandino... In
nineteen thirty-four he was murdered
at a peace conference, and the Somoza
family has ruled ever since...
PRICE
No, no, no... I don't mean the stuff
about the peasants -- I mean the
real stuff.
She knows what he means, but she wants to tease him a bit
first.
CLAIRE
The "real" stuff?... you mean a
history of class struggle in agrarian
societies?
PRICE
No, c'mon!
CLAIRE
Oh. Okay... well...
(beat)
Just a couple things.
(beat)
One -- there's only two kinds of
beer available -- Tona and Victoria.
Victoria's better.
(beat)
And two -- if you see Miss Panama
hanging around the hotel bar -- hot,
hot, hot -- but don't touch. She
belongs to Tacho, and if anybody
gets caught with her then El
Presidente has promised to personally
cut off the guy's...
(unsure which word to
use)
PRICE
Pecker?
CLAIRE
Yeah... and throw it into Lake
Managua.
PRICE
Jesus.
CLAIRE
And the lake's already polluted.
Price is impressed, and yet another new face drops by the
booth -- they both recognize and see him coming, a
contemporary of Price, REGIS FLYNN, a scraggly British
journalist who heads over to their table holding three beers.
PRICE
(mutters to Claire)
Is there anybody here we don't know?
CLAIRE
No.
Regis slides into their booth, happy to see them.
REGIS
G'damn, Price... kudos on the African
snaps.
(shakes hands, a
perfunctory kiss on
her cheek)
Jeez, Claire, I haven't seen you
since...
CLAIRE
Three Mile Island.
REGIS
Yeah... shit...
(wistfully)
Holiday Inn, right?
He nods; they all sip beers and watch Alex sing.
CUT TO:
A teenage DISHWASHER looks around nervously, then pulls a
paper sack from off the shelf, removing a strange mask from
it. He pulls the mask over his head. Then from the bag he
removes a hand-made zip gun, puts a bullet in it, and darts
into the shadows of a nook, waiting.
BACK TO THE BOOTH where Regis softly croons a few bars of
"Stardust" into Claire's mike. The three of them are having
a good time, mildly drunk at best, and uninhibited.
CUT TO:
As Isela and the man enter, commanding attention without
trying. Isela stops at the piano long enough to kiss Alex
gently before sitting in the booth with the man.
IN PRICE'S BOOTH the new arrivals have caught their attention --
Price and Alex still clown slightly, and Claire teases them.
CLAIRE
Jesus... Louis Jordan walks in, and
I'm sitting with the Everly Brothers.
REGIS
Before you fall in love -- that's
Marcel Jazy... friend of wine, women,
and Somoza. They say he's a
businessman...
CLAIRE
(interrupting)
He's a businessman in search of a
business... he doesn't try very hard
to cover up his connections to the
C.I.A...
P.O.V. OF JAZY LIGHTING ISELA'S CIGARETTE
CLAIRE
But look at his moves -- can the
C.I.A. light cigarettes like that?
PRICE
What's wrong with the Everly Brothers?
THE WAITER ARRIVES AT PRICE'S BOOTH and sets down three shrimp
cocktails and more champagne, as:
It opens quickly, and three more MEN IN MASKS enter quickly.
BACK TO THE BOOTH as the waiter speaks with a firm coolness.
WAITER
Please stay at your table, and you
won't be hurt.
A FACE IN A MASK MOVES QUICKLY PAST PRICE'S TABLE
ANOTHER MASKED FACE COMES OUT OF THE KITCHEN The dishwasher
waves a gun.
TWO MASKED FACES -- THE COUPLE -- ENTER THROUGH THE FRONT
DOOR The woman carries an automatic rifle and guards the
entrance.
THREE MASKED FACES APPEAR Almost materialize from thin air,
moving silently and without commotion. The music winds down
slowly. (Six Guerrillas total)
A GUERRILLA QUICKLY SPRAYS AN IMAGE ON THE WALL With a few
deftly drawn strokes, the FACE OF RAFAEL magically appears.
The name "RAFAEL" is written under the face, then other names
and revolutionary slogans. As this takes place:
A WOMAN GUERRILLA HAS A GUN AT THE HEAD OF A NICARAGUAN
BUSINESSMAN The middle-aged, well-dressed local sits with
his wife and two other men. They freeze in fear, the nightclub
freezes, as the GUERRILLAS take control of the room swiftly
and smoothly.
ONE GUERRILLA FACES THE NICARAGUAN BUSINESSMAN at the table
and speaks loudly but without panic. The masked Guerrillas
around the room are serious but nervous.
GUERRILLA LEADER
(in Spanish)
We do not want to waste any ammunition
on a head as empty as yours -- but
we will.
BUSINESSMAN
(in Spanish)
What is this?!
GUERRILLA LEADER
(in Spanish)
Shut up! Get up!
The BUSINESSMAN refuses. The GUERRILLA LEADER takes a hand
grenade from his pocket and pulls the pin without hesitation,
then holds the grenade in front of him fearlessly, inches
away from the Businessman's face.
The Businessman rises slowly. The LEADER motions toward the
back door of the club.
GUERRILLA LEADER
(in Spanish)
You are coming with us -- you will
not be hurt -- we will trade you for
the release of some Nicaraguans who
care about Nicaragua.
The woman with the gun shoves it into the man's head forcing
him to move toward the kitchen door.
PRICE TAKES PICTURES QUICKLY WITH A TINY CAMERA that fits
into the palm of his hand. Neatly, surreptitiously, and calmly --
Price is coolest in any crisis.
CLAIRE PUNCHES ON HER TINY TAPE RECORDER instinctively, and
a tiny red light comes on.
THE BUSINESSMAN IS SHOVED TO THE DOOR He hesitates, afraid
to leave the room. The Guerrilla shoves the grenade in his
face; the woman sticks the gun into his neck even deeper.
MASKED GUERRILLA AT THE FRONT DOOR SHOUTS FOR THEM TO HURRY
THE BANDMEMBERS -- INCLUDING ALEX -- BACK AWAY FROM THE
BANDSTAND Alex trips over the drum set slightly -- a clanging
clash of cymbals startles everyone, and as the drama freezes:
THE KITCHEN DOOR SWINGS OPEN, AND THE BOY PHOTOGRAPHER EMERGES
Innocently, the young boy struts out of the kitchen to see
what's going on, and as he does the DOOR STRIKES THE ARM OF
THE GUERRILLA WITH THE GRENADE, and:
THE GRENADE IS KNOCKED FREE For an instant, everything
freezes, and:
THE GRENADE ROLLS ACROSS THE FLOOR Daisy Williams, the singer,
runs away screaming as the grenade comes to rest near a
crowded section of the club.
A Guerrilla guarding the side door rushes for it, picks it
up, and as he does:
THE GRENADE EXPLODES IN THE GUERRILLA'S HAND A brutal
explosion -- the ceiling caves in partially, the musical
instruments explode, and:
THE SANDINISTA GUERRILLAS DART FROM THE ROOM through various
doors. The boy photographer lies bloodied. The Guerrilla who
picked up the grenade is a barely recognizable corpse. The
Businessman is soiled but unhurt.
ONE HALF OF THE CLUB BREAKS OUT IN FLAME As a broken gas
pipe feeds a sudden outburst of fire, the club's patrons
panic -- screaming and shoving towards the door as the ROOM
LIGHTS UP, and:
PRICE'S LIGHT METER IS OUT AT ONCE followed quickly by a
35mm camera, quickly clicking off picture after picture of
the club amid the flames and panic. The new light makes his
job easier.
PRICE TAKES A LIGHT READING near the body of the boy
photographer. He sees the boy's camera lying nearby. Price
puts away his light meter and feels the boy's pulse, then
puts his ear to the boy's heart -- making sure he is not
still alive.
LA GUARDIA SOLDIERS AND FIREMEN FILL THE ROOM
CUT TO:
The chaos of a busy, cramped Telex room. A switchboard --
several journalists trying to place phone calls. Press come
and go -- coffee, cigarettes, and half-eaten sandwiches.
CLAIRE TEARS A STORY OFF THE TELEX while Price stands to the
side of the action eating a sandwich and watching.
ALEX STANDS AT THE CENTER OF IT ALL Established as the senior
figure (or one of them) to whom other, younger journalists
come for information.
A YOUNG JOURNALIST, a Time stringer, is slightly distraught
on the phone, and interrupts Alex's dealing with others,
cupping the phone, to announce:
TIME STRINGER
...it's Charlie, from New York --
says that a terrorist bombing of a
Central American restaurant isn't
big enough to hold for the world
section...
ALEX
Tell him we have pictures.
YOUNG JOURNALIST
He knows.
ALEX
Tell him there were pieces of body
in the piano, and somebody was
singing, "I Left My Heart in San
Francisco."
(beat)
What's he got better than that?
TIME STRINGER
He's got the Pope visiting Egypt.
Alex grabs the phone in disgust and launches in.
ALEX
Forget the Pope, Charlie. Every week
you got the Pope somewhere. This is
a very big story down here because
it's the first sign of fighting in
Managua.
(beat)
Yeah, well get a map and look up
Nicaragua -- ya drive to New Orleans
and turn left.
While Charlie argues on the other end of the phone, Alex
initials papers and performs several jobs at once.
ALEX
Like hell I'm editorializing, the
whole thing happened in a roomful of
C.I.A. and press. What do you want?!
(beats)
How do I know they were C.I.A.? They
wore name tags, what do you think?
We're backing a Fascist again -- I
know that ain't news, but see if you
can find an angle!
HUB KITTLE has been floating through the room and, upon
hearing the word "fascist," takes offense and approaches
Alex.
HUB
Hey! There's fascists and then there's
fascists, right? Be careful how you
throw words like that around.
Alex ignores Hub though he is slightly pestered by him, and
continues on the phone as he initials papers brought to him.
ALEX
We don't have any pictures of Rafael
because nobody knows where the son
of a bitch is, and anybody crazy
enough to go after him...
Alex spots Price who is standing nearby, still eating a
sandwich, still enjoying the high energy buzz of the room.
Alex directs his next line so that Price cannot fail to get
the message. Alex plays the moment coolly.
ALEX
...is liable to get his nuts shot
off.
Hub nods seriously, in agreement. Price turns. Alex smiles.
Price smiles. Alex hangs up, grumbling, then turns his
attention to the persistent Hub Kittle.
ALEX
Yeah, well g'bye...
(to Hub)
Who the fuck are you?
HUB
(extending a hand)
Hub Kittle. I'm with Lewitsky and
Knupp -- New York. We have a client
down here.
Alex is irritated but fascinated.
ALEX
Who?
HUB
President Somoza.
Alex is incredulous that Somoza employs a New York P.R. firm.
Hub is professionally used to this reaction -- no panic.
HUB
I know, I know...
(beat)
But there's an untold story here. I
mean, the man has a point of view
too, right?
Alex turns to leave; Hub corners him.
HUB
We got a national anthem contest
going on right now, and you guys are
ignoring it. Lotta human interest.
Alex turns to other business though Hub persists.
ELSEWHERE IN THE ROOM a young NICARAGUAN WOMAN, 18, is talking
to Claire. She seems to be part of the local press.
CLAIRE
I want you to get me copies of the
Government inventory lists of all
captured Guerrilla weapons. I want
to know if the guns are Israeli,
Belgian, Russian, Cuban...
YOUNG WOMAN
The Guerrillas are not supplied by
anybody from the outside.
CLAIRE
Fine -- give me proof.
A TELEPHONE OPERATOR CALLS TO CLAIRE through the chaos.
OPERATOR
Su hija, su hija! Your daughter from
Los Angeles.
Claire sighs at the bad timing but seems delighted to be
interrupted by her daughter, and brushes aside a Stringer
forcing paperwork upon her. Claire takes the phone into a
bare, adjacent hallway for some privacy.
IN A BARE HALLWAY Claire talks to her daughter.
CLAIRE
Hi, baby! How are you?
(beat)
Has Grandmother spoiled you silly by
now? She has? Good.
(beats)
Yes, I got your letter with the
picture of your new boyfriend. He's
very good looking... but he's a bit
old, isn't he? No? Just how old is
he?...
P.O.V. FROM THE TELEX ROOM TO CLAIRE Price knows this is not
his world, and he wanders outside.
CUT TO:
Blue walls, bare bulbs, several pictures on the wall, and an
old woman lying in a hammock. Music in the b.g. Price
approaches her and hands her a $100 bill -- there is a brief
negotiation of the black market value.
PRICE
(in broken Spanish)
Cuanto?
OLD WOMAN
Quince.
PRICE
Veinte.
OLD WOMAN
Diezysiete.
She shrugs, declaring the negotiation ended, and leaves the
room to change the dollar into cordobas. Price idly studies
the pictures on the wall:
PICTURE OF ANASTAZIO SOMOZA IN WHITE, PICTURE OF THE VIRGIN
OF GUADALUPE, PICTURE OF SANTA CLAUS, FADED NEWSPHOTO OF
HANK AARON HITTING HIS 715TH HOME RUN.
PRICE SMILES AND TURNS RIGHT INTO A SHARP BAYONET mounted to
a rifle held threateningly by a Guardia soldier.
THE SMALL ROOM IS FILLED WITH NATIONAL GUARDS We haven't
heard them enter over the sounds of music and our
preoccupation with the pictures.
PRICE
What is this? I'm a journalist!
No answer. Price pulls a thick passport and press credentials
from a pocket, handing them to the Officer in charge.
PRICE
Journalista, journalista!
The officer looks at Price's passport photo, studies it
briefly and takes the passport. He nods.
A rifle butt is jammed violently into Price's belly -- he
doubles over. The Officer nods, and Price is led away.
As the Guard hauls him outside, the OLD WOMAN appears in the
doorway with a stack of local currency.
CUT TO:
Price is led into a dark cell where another PRISONER, 50,
lies in street clothes on the floor. The Prisoner is spat
upon by the Guards and kicked awake. Price cringes.
GUARD
Padre Puta, Padre Puta, Padre Puta...
(in Spanish to Price)
Here is a Priest for you to confess
your sins.
The Guards laugh and leave. The Prisoner rises to his feet.
Price keeps his distance. The Prisoner looks in bad shape.
PRISONER PRIEST
Cigarillo?
Price hands him a cigarette and lights it. A long, deep drag.
PRICE
Priest?
(the man nods)
(in broken Spanish)
What are you doing here?
PRISONER PRIEST
(in Spanish)
The government accused me of using
the church to hide Rebels and guns.
PRICE
(in Spanish)
Governments are always wrong, eh?
PRISONER PRIEST
(in Spanish)
This time they're right. Who are
you?
PRICE
(in Spanish)
Un periodista.
PRISONER PRIEST
(in Spanish)
Whose side are you on?
PRICE
(in Spanish)
I don't take sides. I take pictures.
PRISONER PRIEST
(in Spanish)
No sides?
PRICE
(in Spanish)
No.
The Prisoner Priest looks at Price with disdain.
PRISONER PRIEST
Periodista Puta, todos periodistas
son putas.
(All journalists are
whores)
The Prisoner sits down in the corner ignoring Price who is
surprised to be treated so despicably.
PRISONER PRIEST
(quietly)
Go home.
CUT TO:
Price is led into a lineup of 10 people, all Nicaraguans.
The room is narrow and so brightly lit that at first he covers
his eyes.
FIGURES MOVE IN THE SHADOWS A Guardia soldier moves up and
down the lineup, stopping to point at a prisoner. In the
line we recognize the WAITER from the Viking Club. Price
speaks to the soldier in a calm, reasoned tone.
PRICE
Mi amigo -- mala interpretacion, eh?
Periodista, comprende? Famoso. Time
magazine.
The soldier whirls at Price in a rage out of all proportion
to Price's tone, shouting:
SOLDIER
(in Spanish)
Shut up!
Price holds up his hands -- he may be fearless, but he's not
stupid. The soldier pulls a knife, then pulls his own tongue
from his mouth, and makes motions with the knife as if cutting
out his tongue. The message is clear -- Price doesn't speak.
The soldier walks up to the Waiter and points. The Waiter is
frightened.
Through the shadows we see an officer talking with a civilian
in a hat. The civilian points to a door.
THE WAITER IS LED AWAY THROUGH A DOOR protesting desperately
as he goes. The soldier moves to the next prisoner -- he too
is led away. This repeats itself until the soldier arrives
at price.
THE SOLDIER POINTS TO PRICE
PRICE'S P.O.V. THROUGH THE SHADOWS The civilian is in a
discussion with the officer -- it is clear that his opinion
affects the decisions. For a moment Price doesn't know where
he's going to be led. The civilian points to a different
door -- it opens -- and Price steps down off the display
rack into a room.
THROUGH THE DOOR as Price steps through, the action continues
with the other Nicaraguan prisoners. Price looks around
quickly, but the Civilian and Officer are gone. He is quickly
shown into a bare office.
Pictures on the wall of Somoza and the FLAG RAISING AT IWO
JIMA. Price's cameras and bag sit on a desk.
P.O.V. THE CIVILIAN THROUGH A DOOR -- IT IS MARCEL JAZY His
rumpled elegance is at odds with the brutal surroundings.
The door closes.
A SENIOR OFFICER ENTERS THE BARE ROOM, and Price addresses
him at once.
PRICE
Soy un periodista.
SENIOR GUARD OFFICER
(in excellent English)
Mr. Price... you must accept our
deepest apologies for the
misunderstanding. Somebody saw you
taking photographs of terrorists
hooligans in the parade and at the
nightclub -- our young officers get
carried away... they're always looking
for traitors.
PRICE
That film is half way to New York by
now.
SENIOR GUARD OFFICER
I know, I know... It was all a
misunderstanding... una mala
interpretacion. Your cameras.
The Officer reaches for one of Price's cameras and hands it
to him, but as he does:
THE CAMERA DROPS TO THE GROUND AND BREAKS -- SILENCE The
Officer would love for Price to get angry.
SENIOR GUARD OFFICER
I'm sorry.
Price smiles barely, and refuses to pop off.
PRICE
Forget it.
Price puts his cameras in his bag, and as he is shown from
the room he notices a copy of the TIME MAGAZINE WITH ELEPHANT
sitting on the desk.
SENIOR GUARD OFFICER
This way.
Price is shown to a door, handed over to a soldier, and led
outside into the night.
DISSOLVE TO:
The pool is visible in b.g. His house, like the pool, is
rumpled and slightly sloppy though it betrays the taste of
its occupant -- books everywhere, pictures on the wall,
nothing cheap or tacky but everything is well worn.
JAZY
You were arrested because the Guardia
are clowns who specialize in excess.
You were released because I told
them to release you.
CLAIRE
These are not the normal duties of a
businessman.
He looks at them directly.
JAZY
But they are the normal duties of
a... spy, eh? You win, I'm a spy.
(smiles)
There, are you happy? I feel better.
He refills their glasses.
JAZY
Now we can relax. You can turn off
your little thing.
The red light of her recorder is on. She smiles slightly,
undisturbed, and turns it off.
JAZY
Oh, I trust you won't say anything
to hurt me. In some ways I'm a
terrible spy. I used to be much better
at it, but now it seems everyone
knows who I am. I have too many
girlfriends. I like to be
photographed.
(beat)
I talk too much.
Price and Claire are almost afraid to speak, afraid to
interrupt this strange performance.
JAZY
I always talk too much... but my
girlfriends like that... No matter.
(pointing to the
swimsuited woman)
You know who she is?
CLAIRE AND PRICE
No.
JAZY
That's Miss Panama. Do you know who
that is?
CLAIRE AND PRICE
Oh, yeah, yes, etc.
JAZY
She's in love with me. I've got to
get some water in the pool.
(beat)
And once a week I have lunch with
President Somoza to discuss security
measures against the Sandinista
insurgents, but all he wants to talk
about is Miss Panama... he's worried
about her.
Claire interrupts with a smile.
CLAIRE
Because he thinks she's seeing another
man?
Jazy smiles slightly before confirming.
JAZY
...and he assigned me to find out
who the man is.
They all smile at this complication. Price is impressed.
Jazy changes the subject with fluent and disturbing ease.
JAZY
We all know the Revolutionaries are
going to win, don't we?
Silence. They don't know how to respond.
THEIR P.O.V. AS MISS PANAMA STRETCHES LIKE AN ENORMOUS CAT
They all are slightly entertained and glad for the relief.
Unsure what to say next, Price notices a picture on the wall:
CLOSEUP - A BLOWN-UP FRAMED PHOTO OF THE RANCH HOUSE WITH
POOL
The same picture we saw on the leaflets in Africa.
PRICE
There's a rumor about this picture.
Some people say you're a genius --
that you invented this scheme.
JAZY
It was lots of people's idea... Have
you been to Leon?
CLAIRE
We're going to Masaya... they say
the Rebels have hit the cuartel.
PRICE
It's supposed to be nasty there... a
lotta people think Rafael's in the
South. I want to find out.
JAZY
No, no, it's not "nasty" yet. Another
week maybe.
(beat)
You would love Leon. A nice cathedral
and beautiful light... et un peu de
bang-bang.
CLAIRE
We're not doing a travelogue, you
understand.
JAZY
Of course, of course... only I have
heard that Comandante Rafael has
recently had his unit in the area.
PRICE
(surprised)
Rafael is near Leon?
JAZY
Well... it's a rumor, what do I know?
The voice of Miss Panama.
MISS PANAMA
Estoy desemperado!
JAZY
She's lonely!
CLAIRE
Don't let us stand in the way.
JAZY
It's my job.
(beat)
You think I talk too much?
He doesn't wait for an answer, but excuses himself and goes
out to tend to Miss Panama.
P.O.V. OF JAZY AND MISS PANAMA BY THE EMPTY POOL as Jazy
touches her, whispers, and she waves to Claire and Price.
DISSOLVE TO:
Early morning. Price lathers up with shaving cream for the
first time, cleaning up. As he applies the lather he stops,
and slowly draws a face on the mirror with shaving cream
until he is staring at:
THE IMAGE OF RAFAEL IN SHAVING CREAM ON THE MIRROR
CUT TO:
PRICE AND CLAIRE WALK SLOWLY INTO LEON
Looking around warily as they go, they are the only people
entering the town. Claire speaks softly into her tape recorder
as they walk in, recording the event without editorializing.
CLAIRE
...June tenth... the evacuation of
Leon... a woman carries a pig...
signs for the F.S.L.N. are
everywhere... a body...
THE BODY OF A YOUNG MAN lies ignored on the sidewalk. They
continue walking and soon come to:
AN INTERSECTION HELD BY LA GUARDIA TROOPS WITH A TANQUETTA
Price and Claire duck into a doorway, protected in effect by
the Government soldiers who wait silently, guns ready, around
the corner of a building. We see what they're waiting for.
A YOUNG SANDINISTA COMES OUT OF A BUILDING a block away,
holding a handgun. Momentarily confused, he begins running
toward us, toward the soldiers waiting in ambush. The
Guerrilla races quickly to his waiting death, and as he turns
the corner right into a dozen Guardia troops:
THE GUARDIA GUNS OPEN UP ON THE YOUNG GUERRILLA, killing him
instantly.
CLAIRE TURNS HER HEAD AWAY unable to watch.
PRICE RECORDS THE EVENT WITH HIS CAMERA
THE GUARDIA FOLLOW THE TANQUETTA SLOWLY down the street toward
the Rebel youth's house. Suddenly the intersection is empty.
PRICE AND CLAIRE MOVE DOWN A SIDESTREET SLOWLY as:
SEVERAL GUERRILLA MUCHACHOS DART OUT OF AN ALLEY with
sharpened sticks, a spear gun, and one home-made gun. The
Muchachos hesitate briefly, lost, and see Price.
THE MUCHACHOS QUICKLY POSE FOR A PICTURE motioning for Price
to record them. They pose instantly in "tough-guy" posture.
PRICE TAKES THEIR PICTURE and just as quickly they dart away
through a bombed out building.
THREE SANDINISTAS LEAP OFF A ROOFTOP and race toward Claire
and Price who freeze:
CLAIRE
Russell?!
For a moment they aren't sure what this means -- are they in
trouble? The Sandinistas shove past the two journalists,
pushing open a doorway and disappearing inside. For a moment
Price and Claire are alone on the street.
THE DOOR OPENS AGAIN SLOWLY and a middle-aged WOMAN appears,
motioning for them to come inside.
The Three Sandinistas, dressed half in khaki, half recycled
disco, are pleading with a young man, PEDRO, 15.
SANDINISTA #1
(in Spanish)
You must come and help us... one
more time.
PEDRO
(in Spanish)
No, please...
One of the Sandinistas brings Pedro his rumpled baseball
jersey from another room.
SANDINISTA #2
(in Spanish)
For Leon... for Nicaragua!
Pedro sees Price and Claire and is more interested in them.
He speaks in broken but understandable English.
PEDRO
Americans? Journalists?
CLAIRE AND PRICE
Yes.
Pedro lights up, and runs to a shelf where he returns with a
baseball he is signing.
PEDRO
Ah! I put my autograph on this ball.
SANDINISTA #1
(in Spanish)
Pedro! There is no time to waste.
Pedro is more interested in the two Americans.
PEDRO
When you get back to the United
States, I want you to give this ball
to Tippy Martinez for me. He is from
Nicaragua.
Pedro hands Claire the baseball as the Sandinistas plead
with Pedro for his help. He is more interested in getting
the baseball delivered to Tippy Martinez. Claire accepts the
ball graciously, exchanges awkward glances with Price, and
puts it in her shoulder bag.
SANDINISTA #1
(in Spanish)
Enrique is dead! Roberto has
disappeared! The Guardia has the
church, and we need you!
PEDRO
(to Claire and Price)
You come, eh?
(to the Sandinistas)
Can they come with us?
SANDINISTA #2
Come! Everybody come!
They go to the door and open it a crack to look out.
P.O.V. THE TANQUETTA PASSES as Soldiers kick open doors across
the street.
The Sandinistas go to a corner of the room and push a book
shelf out of the way. A large hole has been broken in the
wall. They climb through the hole into the living room of
the next house; the woman pushes the shelf back over the
hole with great effort.
A family huddles in the corner as the MAN OF THE HOUSE pulls
back a couch and a hanging blanket, revealing another hole
knocked in the wall. The Sandinistas, Pedro, Claire and Price
scramble through.
P.O.V. THROUGH A SERIES OF DOOR-SIZED HOLES IN THE WALLS of
all the houses on the block, connecting the homes with a
secret passageway. The six of them race through the houses,
each hole opening and then closing magically.
The Three Sandinistas, Pedro, Claire, and Price emerge. A
WOMAN, 50, runs the cafe and welcomes them. The SIX crawl so
as not to be seen from the street; they stop long enough to
survey the plaza.
P.O.V. THE CENTRAL PLAZA OF LEON DOMINATED BY A HUGE CATHEDRAL
Half a dozen bodies are scattered across the plaza. Otherwise,
it is empty.
P.O.V. SIX GUARDIA SNIPERS IN THE CHURCH TOWER control the
plaza. As we watch, they fire off occasional shots in
different directions--there is no way to cross the plaza.
THE WOMAN PULLS A TRAY OF "CONTACT BOMBS" from the oven,
home-made grenades that look like muffins on a tray. Pedro
grabs one and pretends to bite into it. The Sandinistas start
to laugh and catch themselves as Pedro clowns. Claire and
Price aren't sure what the "muffins" are and don't respond;
mostly they are on edge. The contact bombs are put in a sack.
The woman opens a trap door in the floor, and the six of
them climb down a ladder into a tunnel.
CUT TO:
Pedro leads them with a candle through a dark passage under
the street. Overhead we hear gunfire. Rats scurry, and water
runs through an open sewer.
CUT TO:
A tapestry rug is pulled away, and Pedro's head appears. He
climbs out and soon all the party is in the church. A PRIEST
leads them quickly through an immense, nearly. European
interior of ornate altars and burning candles. The small
party is led to a small corner of the sanctuary where a long,
rickety ladder leads up to the roof.
THE SANDINISTAS SCRAMBLE UP THE LADDER as it sways. Pedro
follows with his sack of contact bombs. Then Price goes up
as the Priest holds the ladder. The American is much larger
than the Nicaraguans -- the ladder squeaks and sways, and
when he is nearly at the top:
THE LADDER CRACKS as Price reaches the top and is helped to
safety. The Priest steadies the ladder now made unsafe and
clearly Claire wants to go onto the roof.
PRIEST
(in Spanish)
No, please... it's not safe. You
must come with me.
Claire looks at Price -- she wants to go on the roof but the
sound of close gunfire settles the dilemma. Claire hurries
off to safety with the Priest.
CUT TO:
IN A NEARLY DARK ROOM full of hanging hammocks, Claire sits
on the floor lit by a low wattage bulb hanging from a cord.
In another room through a door Price can be seen with a family
in the hammock workshop. Claire talks softly into her
recorder.
CLAIRE
Hello sweetheart, this is your mother.
I'm in Leon and I miss you. Don't
worry about me -- it's not dangerous
at all. I guess you can't believe
what you hear on the news. I'll put
this this tape in the mail when I
get back to Managua, but knowing
what the mail service is like, I may
be home before it arrives. I think
about you all the time and hope I
can make it back before you graduate
from Jr. High.
As she speaks Price bids the family farewell and comes into
the room with Claire where he lies down in a hammock.
CLAIRE
I love you and I'll finish this letter
when I get back to the hotel.
Claire lies down on a mat, exhausted, after turning out the
light. Several moments pass before Price speaks.
PRICE
I know who shot Pedro. I knew somebody
was in the tower.
CLAIRE
Why didn't you tell the guerrillas?
PRICE
I don't know... then they would've
killed him I guess. I didn't want to
interfere.
CLAIRE
It wasn't an easy choice.
PRICE
I think I made the wrong one.
Silence.
CLAIRE
You didn't take any pictures when it
was over.
PRICE
I didn't?
(beat)
I picked up a gun. Jesus.
(beat)
Is something happening to us?
CLAIRE
Yes.
Silence. They lie for a long time in the dark. A light in
the house is turned off. Finally:
PRICE
Are you asleep?
CLAIRE
No.
Price gets out of the hammock and lies down next to her.
They don't speak. They kiss. She unbuttons his shirt. He
unbuttons her blouse. They undress just enough to begin making
love softly, quietly.
DISSOLVE TO:
The first light of dawn strikes Claire's bare torso.
PRICE'S LIGHT METER APPEARS AT HER BACK Price takes a reading,
then moves the meter to her neck, another reading. He moves
it down her nude body lit beautifully in the vague light,
partially covered with a blanket.
He scurries across the room, stark naked, with a camera.
Price begins photographing her.
He moves back to her and gently removes the blanket from the
rest of her body. His actions are quiet and easy. He stops
frequently to admire her.
Claire lies sleeping nude, except for her socks. Price moves
around the room -- picture, picture, picture.
CLAIRE WAKES UP SLOWLY and pulls the blanket back over her.
She opens her eyes and sees Price sitting in a chair several
feet away with his camera.
PRICE
G'morning.
CLAIRE
What are you doing?
PRICE
You look beautiful.
She realizes what he's been doing.
CLAIRE
How long have you been doing this?
PRICE
'Bout ten frames. Wait'll you see
the pictures -- you look great.
Her sense of violation is balanced by this notion. For a
moment we sense her attitude can go either way -- outrage or
some sense of being flattered, however ill conceived. She
chooses the latter.
CLAIRE
I'll bet I look great -- give me the
film.
PRICE
After they're printed.
CLAIRE
I'll develop them myself -- give it
to me or I'll start taping what you
say in your sleep.
Price hands her the film and climbs back under the blanket
with her.
PRICE
I talk in my sleep?
CLAIRE
Girl's names and F-stops. Terrible.
They curl up together, holding onto each other. A small child
crosses the courtyard, peeking at them. A rooster crows.
PRICE
Call the office. I don't want to go
to work today.
The peacefulness is shaken by the roar of an engine close
by.
A HELICOPTER GUNSHIP PASSES OVER THE COURTYARD They look up,
jolted out of the moment. The war is back.
CUT TO:
Alex comes out a door chatting with somebody, and passes a
mini-cam crew, old friends.
ALEX
How was Matagalpa?
MINI-CAM CREW #1
No bang-bang, Alex... none at all.
ALEX
You find anything?
MINI-CAM CREW #2
Half the press corps.
A small laugh. They continue on. Alex enters Claire's room.
Alex enters. Nobody there. As he turns to leave he sees some
pictures in a stack of papers on her desk. He picks one up.
CLOSE UP: A PICTURE OF CLAIRE SLEEPING IN LEON It's all over
and he knows it. He stares at, even admires, the image. He
puts it down and turns to leave as:
CLAIRE ENTERS
CLAIRE
Oh!
ALEX
Oh.
(awkwardly)
How was Leon?
CLAIRE
Bloody.
ALEX
Yeah... I'll bet... Claire...
Alex finally acknowledges that it is over with Claire, but
refuses to say it directly.
ALEX
I'm tired of Nicaragua.
CLAIRE
You haven't been here very long.
ALEX
Long enough, lets face it, you were
right... everybody was right.
CLAIRE
About what?
ALEX
My cheekbones. What do you think of
'em?
CLAIRE
I like your cheekbones. Alex, are
you all right?
ALEX
This is a face made for television.
CLAIRE
You decided to go with the network.
Alex nods, then seems to hit the end of his own resilience
and gets vitriolic.
ALEX
Is he a good fuck?
CLAIRE
Alex...
In a simple monologue Alex goes from outrage to acknowledgment
of what he already knew.
ALEX
That's a reasonable question for a
reporter to ask, isn't it?!
(beat)
I shoulda never come down here, eh?
This is the way it's going to be.
(beat)
I'll make a shitload of money in
television for just sitting there.
(beat)
I'm gonna show up to work at
Rockefeller Center every morning and
they're gonna hand me the news with
my coffee and toast.
(beat)
I shoulda never come down here, eh?
This war down here belongs to you
guys, okay? I'm on tommorrow's plane.
CLAIRE
Alex...
ALEX
You want to take me to the airport?
It's okay.
(beat -- resigned)
I shoulda never come down here.
CUT TO:
Overlooking the gathering from his private living room, Somoza
grants Claire her interview. He close the window to muffle
the singing.
CLAIRE
You're late to your own luncheon,
Mr. President -- we can schedule
this for another time.
SOMOZA
Nonsense -- let them wait. We are a
stunning couple, eh? My stomach is
very flat -- I've been working out.
CLAIRE
We are a stunning couple. Mr.
President, you own one fifth of all
the land in Nicaragua, you own the
shipping port, the national airlines,
the Mercedes dealership...
SOMOZA
I am on a salt free diet...
He takes her hand and leads her to two large portraits hanging
on a wall -- his parents.
CLAIRE
Do you always hold hands with
reporters?
SOMOZA
(ignores her)
This is my mother and father. They
were very special to me. Every Sunday
morning I drive out to the cemetery
and put flowers on their grave. I
think people should know that.
CLAIRE
Would you care to comment on the
fall of Leon to the rebels?
Somoza just smiles unaffected by her questions; she knows
the game is undaunted.
CUT TO:
SOMOZA
My people love me. My stomach is
flat. Did I say that already? No
matter. It is flat.
CLAIRE
There are reports that the Guardia
operates a torture chamber at
Coyotepe.
Somoza ignores the question and reopens the window, flooding
the room with the Tony Bennett classic.
SOMOZA
I like this song.
CLAIRE
Since the earthquake in 1972 destroyed
half of Managua, over three hundred
million dollars in foreign relief
aid have poured into the country,
yet nothing has been re-built. It is
said that the money has gone into
your pocket.
SOMOZA
I love the press, I really do. Some
of my best friends are journalists.
CLAIRE
Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Brazil, and
Panama are reportedly on the verge
of breaking off diplomatic relations
with your regime. Would you comment?
HUB KITTLE AND AN OFFICER BURST INTO THE ROOM interrupting
the interview. Something has happened. Somoza initially lashes
out at them -- the first time we've seen him lose his cool --
then recovers.
SOMOZA
(in Spanish)
I am busy! Get out of here at once
or I'll put my foot up your ass!
The OFFICER seems familiar with these tirades and grabs Somoza
by the arm, whispering into his ear. Somoza seems delighted
with the news and turns to Hub for confirmation. Hub nods.
SOMOZA
(to Claire)
I'm sorry to have to conclude this
most pleasant encounter, but something
has happened.
As Somoza leaves the room with the Officer and Hub, Hub turns
to Claire to squeeze in one final P.R. stroke.
HUB
Did he tell you about his parents in
the graveyard, the flowers and all
that?
(she nods)
Good, good...
Claire is left alone momentarily in Somoza's room. A soldier
enters and accompanies her outside to the luncheon.
CUT TO:
A YOUTH at the wheel props a board under the steering wheel
and races to the back as ANOTHER YOUTH opens the door as the
bus races past Claire toward the tank.
THE TWO YOUTHS LEAP OUT THE BACK DOOR where they tumble into
the dirt just before:
THE BUS SMASHES INTO THE TANK AND EXPLODES
GUARDIA SOLDIERS SHOOT THE TWO YOUTHS before they get away,
as:
GUERILLAS APPEAR ON EVERY ROOFTOP opening heavy fire on La
Guardia.
GUARDIA TROOPS RETREAT QUICKLY ON FOOT AND IN TANQUETTAS
THE SHERMAN TANK TRIES TO DISLODGE ITSELF FROM THE BUS but
cannot, and drags the bus with it as it backs down the hill.
PRICE RUNS OUT TO CLAIRE and huddles with her. She is shaken
but unhurt.
SANDINISTAS ARE EVERYWHERE, moving into Matagalpa as Price
and Claire move past several bodies to higher ground.
SANDINISTA BARRICADES ARE ON EVERY CORNER where women serve
food to their men. Claire and Price wander through,
momentarily disoriented. A small boy runs through the street
kicking a soccer ball, occasionally avoiding a body. He runs
right up to them and speaks.
BOY
Busca triquitraques?
CLAIRE
Si.
BOY
Venga.
They follow him up a hill.
CUT TO:
THEY ARE SEARCHED IMMEDIATELY, asked to put down their gear,
asked for credentials, and led down the hallway of a house
that is very American middle class.
ANOTHER SOLDIER WITH RIFLE detains them momentarily before
showing them into a room used as a Revolutionary Command
office.
ISELA STANDS IN MILITARY FATIGUES talking to her Sandinista
colleagues. Clearly she commands respect and makes decisions.
She finishes and turns to Claire and Price in a very
businesslike way, never acknowledging directly that they
have met before.
ISELA
You are looking for Rafael?
They are somewhat taken aback at her directness and
information.
PRICE
Yeah. If it's possible.
CLAIRE
Do you know why we're here... exactly?
ISELA
Mr. Price doesn't do anything before
announcing it first in the bar.
(beat)
It's a good story. You'll be more
famous.
The tent is filled with Sandinista officers and soldiers
standing and sitting around.
RAFAEL'S BODY LIES ON A TABLE The shirtless upper torso
propped slightly upright, still wearing glasses, the figure
of Rafael is distinctly non-heroic. He is slightly overweight,
slightly balding, but as he lies there surrounded by his
men, the the glow of lanterns, he looks almost alive.
Price and Claire look at each other.
COMMANDANTE CINCO
Usted es un fotografo magnifico.
(beat)
Queremos que vive.
(You are a great
photographer. Make
him alive.)
Price laughs -- the request is ridiculous.
ISELA
(to Claire)
Why is he laughing?
PRICE
You're crazy.
Cinco steps forward -- his presence commands attention. His
delivery is forceful but not emotional. As he begins to speak,
Price stops laughing.
CINCO
(in Spanish)
We have momentum, but many more lives
will be lost. Even Washington is
starting to admit that the butcher
Somoza is not loved by his people.
They have detained twenty-five million
dollars in new arms shipments for
Somoza at an airfield in Florida
until they find out if Rafael is
alive or dead. We know about these
things.
He pauses briefly.
CLAIRE
If Washington thinks Rafael is dead,
they will ship the arms to Somoza.
Do you understand.
PRICE
Yeah.
(without enthusiasm)
Commandante... Soy un periodista.
CINCO attacks that defense with new vigor.
CINCO
This has nothing to do with journalism --
there is more to the world than
journalism. We are going to end this
war with you or without you.
(beat)
People don't really believe in Rafael --
they believe in the idea of Rafael,
no? Because for now the idea of Rafael
is enough for the people of Nicaragua.
When the war is over -- none of this
matters.
PRICE hesitates, his manner devoid of its usual cockiness.
PRICE
I don't do things... like this.
CINCO
Enough lives have been lost already.
(beat of empathy)
It's difficult, I know -- but you
must do it.
COMMANDANTE CINCO PLACES AN ARM ON PRICE'S SHOULDER and speaks
in broken English.
CINCO
In the morning, eh? When there's
better light!
CUT TO:
Price lies on his back on a table. Claire sits in a chair, a
lantern is on the table. His reclining body is not unlike
Rafael's. He plays with a camera without looking at it,
turning it slowly, removing and replacing a lens. He's never
been this calm, this unmoving.
Claire, however, moves around the tent like a caged animal --
like Price normally is. She smokes. She's nervous and wired.
CLAIRE
I spend my whole life separating how
I feel from how I think and what I
see from what I say -- that's called
journalism, isn't it?
He nods slightly.
CLAIRE
It's disciplined. It civilized. It
involves distinctions. I'm great at
distinctions. I wish I wasn't so
good at them. Sometimes I envy you --
you don't make any -- it's very
convenient.
(beat)
The only time I don't worry about
all those things is when I'm with my
daughter.
PRICE
Or when you're in bed.
CLAIRE
Yes!
(beat -- changes
direction)
My job is to find a story, then tell
a story -- whatever it is -- because
I believe that if enough people hear
enough stories then somehow, through
information alone, we all have a
better chance to survive.
(beat)
I believe in information.
(beat)
That's a very romantic streak I have
running through me -- maybe it's a
weakness. Information is good --
lack of information is bad. Simple,
eh?
PRICE
Not so simple.
CLAIRE
You're God damn right it's not.
(beat)
You take that picture you'll take it
for all the right reasons -- I
understand.
PRICE
I'm not gonna take it.
He fiddles with the cameras.
CLAIRE
That's fine for you. But do I go
back and say I interviewed Rafael?
Do I go back and say I missed the
biggest story of the war? Or do I
say Rafael was stone cold dead --
that's the information, isn't it? Or
do I say he entertained us all in
his inimitably charismatic manner
around the ol' revolutionary campfire?
(beat)
Can we throw up our arms and say we
fell in love with the querillas
because their cause was...
sympathetic?
(beat)
Journalists don't fall in love.
(beat)
Which story do you want me to tell?
Silence.
PRICE
Do what you want to do.
CLAIRE
Christ, what the fuck are we doing
here?
PRICE
I want to be here.
(beat)
With you.
(beat)
What do you want.
Silence.
CLAIRE
I want this war to end.
(beat)
I'm not going to tell the world that
Rafael is dead.
Silence. Claire lies down on the cot. Exhausted but high.
Price gets off the table and goes to her.
PRICE
I love you.
CLAIRE
I think I love you.
PRICE
Don't think so much.
He gets on the cot with her. They kiss deeply, passionately,
and begin making love.
Red light in the bathroom as Price pulls several photo prints
from the bath and plasters them wet against the mirror.
PHOTO OF RAFAEL IN THE CAMP, and he looks very much alive.
He pulls more shots from the bath: THE PRIEST FROM LEON, THE
BUSINESSMAN, COMMANDANTE CINCO AND ISELA. He dries them off
and hides them with their negatives under a pile of equipment.
He picks up the shot of Rafael and leaves.
CUT TO:
The newspaper headline sits on Jazy's desk as Jazy studies
it unemotionally. We hear Miss Panama's voice:
MISS PANAMA
Marcel!
He spins on his chair as she glides in modeling a new dress.
She spins magically for him -- he blows her a kiss.
CUT TO:
Two MASKED GUERILLAS hold a gun to the head of a pilot. A
large sack is crammed into the tiny compartment with them.
Journalists are gathered to watch the fighting which is now
on the outskirts of Managua. Price stands to the side casually
taking pictures of Journalists taking pictures of the war.
Hub Kittle floats around providing drinks and P.R.
P.O.V. A PUSH-PULL AIRPLANE MAKES BOMBING PASSES on the
capitol. Columns of smoke rise throughout the city.
REGIS MOVES HIS MINI-CAM CREW INTO POSITION AT THE RAIL
REGIS
We got the smoke in frame?
CREWMEMBER
(moves the camera
slightly)
We got the smoke.
REGIS
Roll it...
CLAIRE STANDS TO THE OTHER SIDE with binoculars watching.
She accepts a drink from Hub and speaks into her tape deck.
CLAIRE
Under a steel gray July sky... start
again... under a gray steel Managuan
sky... scratch it... In an
extraordinary development in Managua,
President Anastazio Somoza has ordered
the Air Force to begin bombing his
own capitol, under a sky... fuck
it...
She fires down the drink and puts down the mike. She picks
up the binoculars again and, glancing below, is shocked:
P.O.V. BELOW -- ALEX GETS OUT OF A CAB WITH HIS SUITCASES
He starts into the hotel, glances up, and they see each other.
CLAIRE
Oh my God...
Price sees Alex at the same time. Alex waves to both of as
he heads into the hotel. Price and Claire look at each other.
Claire sits down at a table, stunned to see Alex. Price
commandeers a waiter and joins her with a fresh tray of
drinks.
CLAIRE
A Scotch, please...
(he nods)
Double.
Price joins her as other journalists jockey for position at
the railing. He is equally upset and confused.
PRICE
What's he doing here?
CLAIRE
I have no idea.
ALEX COMES THROUGH THE DOOR with a couple journalists, sees
Price and Claire and comes over to join them. A polite kiss
on Claire's cheek, a handshake for Price. A moment of
awkwardness.
ALEX
Congratulations.
PRICE
On what?
ALEX
On what?! The Washington Post, the
Times, networks, wire services --
everybody's picked up the picture.
It's fabulous.
CLAIRE
(nervously)
Well, yes... it's fabulous.
PRICE
Fabulous.
Unsure silence.
CLAIRE
Why are you back?
ALEX
I came back because of Russell.
PRICE
Because of me?
ALEX
Yeah... the whole fucking East Coast
is falling in love with Rafael --
they were sure he was dead this time.
Somebody wants to do a musical about
him and his mug's on every T-shirt
in Central Park.
Alex enjoys the lunatic mixture of politics and popular
culture.
ALEX
I think he's bigger than Farrah
Fawcett.
Claire and Price struggle to enjoy this supremely
uncomfortable moment. It's not easy to enter the game. Claire
attempts to change the subject.
CLAIRE
You look good. Things're okay?
ALEX
I'm happier in New York, sure, things
are great. You guys?
PRICE
Terrific... now... I'm a little slow
here, Alex... what exactly did you
come back for?
No more games. Alex addresses Price with conviction.
ALEX
It's a great story.
(beat)
I want to talk to Rafael... and you're
the only man in the world that can
take me to him.
Price's and Claire's hearts sink. They look at each other.
Alex, despite his reluctance to return to Nicaragua, seems
genuinely enthused about the possible story. Before Price or
Claire respond, Hub Kittle notices Alex and comes over with
a tray of drinks, extending genuine greetings to the Senior
Correspondent.
HUB
Alex! Couldn't stay away, eh?
The fresh round of drinks are put on the table. The sound of
bombs ripping the capitol are the only thing we hear.
CUT TO:
Claire and Price now have adjoining rooms. She is staring
out the window as he comes in. The mood is strained.
CLAIRE
We've got to tell Alex what happened.
PRICE
No way.
CLAIRE
I'll tell him. He deserves to know.
PRICE
We don't owe him anything!
CLAIRE
We owe him that!
(beat)
He got you started in this business...
he covered for your missed deadlines
and made excuses for your
unprofessional attitude before the
world fell in love with your
pictures...
(beat)
Before kids fresh out of journalism
school were rushing off to any war
they could to interview bullets and
take pictures of bodies -- like Price!
(beat)
He took care of you before you were
hot!
Silence. She's hitting home but he doesn't want to acknowledge
it.
PRICE
He wouldn't understand.
CLAIRE
Before Nicaragua you wouldn't
understand. I'm not sure I exactly
understand.
(beat)
What are we going to do?
There is something calculating in Price's tone, this is not
the fearless, boyish innocent anymore.
PRICE
I'll take Alex to find Rafael --
we'll go to Sebaco on the road to
Matagalpa -- the Guardia heavily
control the area and they're scared
right now -- they'll never let us
through. We won't be able to get
near Rafael. Alex will understand --
and we'll turn around and drive back
without a story.
Claire is disturbed at this compounding of the lie.
CLAIRE
That's a lie!
PRICE
Tell me about lies!
Silence. They are co-conspirators and they know it.
CLAIRE
I don't want to tell him either.
CUT TO:
Price hangs a U-turn at the roadblock and heads back to
Managua. He drives crazily.
PRICE
Some-motherfucker-took-my-fucking-
pictures-I-don't-fucking-know-what-
happened!
(beat)
Fuck me!
Silence.
ALEX
Didn't you ship the film to New York?
PRICE
I developed it in my room.
(pleads)
Jesus Christ, Alex?!
Silence. The car races.
ALEX
Slow down.
(compassionately)
It wasn't your fault if somebody
stole your stuff...
PRICE
It was.
Alex doesn't force the issue, nor does he understand it
entirely.
ALEX
What about Rafael?
No answer -- the car races back to Managua. Alex stares at
Price trying to figure out what is wrong.
CUT TO:
A MAID IS CLEANING HIS ROOM which is the usual disaster.
Price enters, just returned, and quickly looks for his
negatives under the equipment where he had hidden them.
PRICE
Algo no esta aqui. Fotografias.
(Something is not
here. Photographs.)
MAID
(in Spanish)
Everything's always a mess here. You
should be neater.
PRICE
Negativos, negativos!
The maid shrugs -- Price is crazy anyway, and:
CLAIRE WALKS INTO THE ROOM She too looks shaken. He looks
up.
CLAIRE
Commandante Cinco's body was just
found on the road to Matagalpa.
The maid starts crying. They look at her helplessly as she
sobs, 'Cinco, Cinco...'
CUT TO:
CLAIRE sighs with frightened relief and hurries upstairs to
join Price.
JAZY'S BEDROOM as she enters. A rumpled bed, a spilled wine
glass -- a pleasant mess.
CLAIRE
Russell?
(no answer)
Russell?
A door off the bedroom is open -- light spills out. Claire
stops cold at what she sees:
PRICE STANDS IN A ROOM FULL OF PHOTOGRAPHS Hundreds of
pictures of all sizes, photographic equipment, an enlarger,
cameras and lenses, etc. Pictures of Sandino, newspaper
photos, snapshots.
P.O.V. OF RUSSELL'S PHOTOGRAPHS FROM RAFAEL'S CAMP cropped
and blown up -- Commandante Cinco, the Priest of Leon, the
Businessman, Isela. Photographs of other slain rebel leaders.
The pictures include faces that have been circled with names
written in -- exactly as in the pictures Oates possessed.
They are both stunned.
PRICE
Let's get out of here.
THEY HURRY DOWNSTAIRS and as they get to the front door --
the sound of somebody opening it. They freeze.
THE DOOR OPENS AND MISS PANAMA ENTERS She smiles and greets
them in a friendly, aloof manner, and continues toward the
waterless pool.
MISS PANAMA
Hola.
Price and Claire return the greeting and continue out the
door.
CUT TO:
PRICE AND CLAIRE LIE IN BED sweating. A siren and distant
mortar can be heard outside. Price goes to the window and
shuts it -- the room is quieter and hotter. He pounds a broken
air conditioning duct.
PRICE
Damn air conditioning.
He looks out the window -- it never used to be this
complicated.
CLAIRE
I wish I was home.
Silence.
PRICE
C'mere.
She goes to him, lies down, and they embrace.
CLAIRE
Do you think it's almost over?
A loud, long burst of automatic weapons fire is heard
somewhere outside. Their eyes are open as they hold onto
each other.
CUT TO:
A hastily called press conference. Tacho takes a quick drag
on a cigarette and makes the announcement.
SOMOZA
It is with grave concern that we
announce that Alexander Grazier,
senior American correspondent, has
been murdered at the hands of
terrorists...
A shock wave goes through the room -- hands raised, questions.
SOMOZA
Mr. Kittle has prepared statements
for you.
Somoza turns and leaves as Kittle passes out press statements.
CUT TO:
TV is on. She's at the typewriter working on a story.
A PHOTOGRAPH OF ALEX COMES ON THE TELEVISION NEWS, with
Spanish language commentary over the image.
CLAIRE KEEPS WORKING AND GRADUALLY TYPES LESS AS SHE HEARS
the story, finally rising and moving in front of the
television as a local newsman reads of Alex's death and we
see the Somoza press announcement.
The phone rings: Claire picks up the phone and listens
silently before hanging up. She sits down shakily on the bed
and starts crying.
CUT TO:
Journalists are everywhere -- suitcases packed -- trying to
get out of the country. The registration desk is chaos. Regis
tries to get the attention of the clerk -- so does everyone
else.
REGIS
Get my bill and get me a cab, hey,
amigo!
The clerk is under attack.
CLERK
No cabs.
REGIS
Cabs!
CLERK
No cabs!
CLAIRE GETS OFF THE ELEVATOR AND MOVES THROUGH THIS CHAOS
Regis sees her and tries to give her comfort -- she's beyond
that. She wears a jacket and carries her bag -- she's going
somewhere.
REGIS
I'm sorry, Claire...
She pushes him away politely; she is single-minded now.
CLAIRE
Heard from Russell?
REGIS
Nobody has.
CLAIRE
Wanta help me find him?
Regis looks at her like she's crazy.
REGIS
Claire... it's on the weird side out
there...
Hub Kittle enters the lobby, sees Claire and volunteers:
HUB
Jesus Christ, Claire, a human tragedy,
what can I say?
Claire is nearly in tears, but resists.
CLAIRE
Fuck off, Hub, get outta my way.
CLAIRE EXITS THE HOTEL AND GETS INTO HER PRESS CAR
CUT TO:
Nothing is said. Price is led into a room, one of many --
but this room is boarded over. There is no escape. Price is
in pain, his arm bleeds, he's tiring.
WOMAN
(in Spanish)
This is the best I can offer.
PRICE
Gracias.
PRICE STANDS IN THE TINY ROOM WAITING
He leans against the wall behind the door. He shuts his eyes --
a noise at the door. When he opens them:
THE WOMAN IS STANDING THERE WITH A GUN
She hands it to him and leaves, bolting the door.
PRICE LEANS AGAINST THE WALL HOLDING A REVOLVER and he waits --
cameras around his neck, gun in hand, bloody, slightly
ridiculous, and scared.
CUT TO:
He hears the Guard breaking in, and he cocks his gun.
as the Squadron Leader and three soldiers burst in -- the
woman stands in the middle of the room and lies.
WOMAN
(in Spanish)
Nobody is here. Get out.
The Sqaudron Leader points to different rooms for each
soldier, and they proceed to kick in each door, automatic
rifles ready.
PRICE'S ROOM AS HE HEARS A SOLDIER AT THIS DOOR.
THE DOOR IS KICKED OPEN, AND A SOLDIER STEPS INTO THE ROOM
For a moment he doesn't see Price -- then he whirls and faces
the photographer who's so scared he's forgotten to raise his
gun.
PRICE AND THE SOLDIER ARE FACE-TO-FACE The soldier is a
fourteen-year-old boy fighting back tears. He, too, is scared
to death. Neither is quite sure why he is there -- they just
want it to end.
PRICE AND THE BOY AIM THEIR GUNS AT EACH OTHER as they hear
the voice of the Squadron Leader in the other room.
LEADER
Esta alli?!
(Is he there?)
No answer.
LEADER
Esta alli?!
SQUADRON LEADER HEADS TOWARD THE ROOM but as he does, the
boy soldier appears in the doorway.
BOY SOLDIER
No esta aqui.
The Leader grunts an order, and the squadron quickly heads
to the next house.
PRICE'S BODY SLUMPS AGAINST THE WALL EXHAUSTED, and the woman
enters as soon as the last soldier has gone.
Price's brief moment of peace is shattered by the screaming
of Guardia troops and the explosions of rocket fire from the
gunship. He looks outside.
THE GUNSHIP FIRES INTO THE SHANTYTOWN killing several of its
own Guardia troops. A GUARDIA OFFICER screams at the gunship
and fires a hand gun at the giant chopper.
GUARDIA OFFICER
(in Spanish)
We are you! We are you! What are you
doing?!
GUARDIA TROOPS EVACUATE THE SHANTYTOWN in a panicky scramble
to escape their own gunship.
PRICE RACES THROUGH THE BACK OF THE SHANTYTOWN, taking
advantage of the chaos, and without slowing down, breaks
free of the maze of the barrio.
CLAIRE'S P.O.V. OF PRICE RACING ACROSS THE STREET, past a
body and an overturned, smoking car, back into the rubble
strewn blocks of the edge of the city. A tanquetta comes
around a corner and sees Price a block away.
CLAIRE
Russell!
PRICE SEES HER, and races along a wall until they meet,
grabbing her on the run -- each is panicky and frightened --
and they duck into very shallow cover, barely safe.
PRICE
What're you doing here?!
They embrace quickly and tightly, but look around nervously
as they do. Price isn't sure if anybody knows about Alex.
CLAIRE
Alex!
PRICE
The Guardia did it -- I got pictures.
P.O.V. A TANQUETTA PASSES ON THE NEXT STREET, visible through
shattered holes in the buildings. A Guardia squadron passes.
PRICE AND CLAIRE RUN DOWN THE STREET in the opposite
direction, their path guided somewhat by an overturned bus
in an intersection, abandoned barricades and roadblocks, and
the rubble of street fighting.
CUT TO:
JAZY STANDS WITH A THIRD GUN AT HIS HEAD, being held by the
most forceful and crazed of three young Muchachos. With guns
on Jazy, Price, and Claire, there is much confusion as to
who's in charge and what exactly they're doing.
MUCHACHO #1
(in Spanish)
Who are you?
JAZY
They are my friends.
MUCHACHO #2
(in Spanish)
Shut up. We kill them all.
MUCHACHO #3
(in Spanish)
No. Only him.
The guns are aimed back and forth in confusion -- Price and
Claire don't have a chance to respond, and they're not sure
what to say.
MUCHACHO #1
(in Spanish)
Him or him or her?
The Muchachos begin arguing rapidly among themselves; and as
they do, Jazy addresses Price and Claire coolly.
JAZY
Well, here we are, eh?
MUCHACHO #1
(in Spanish)
Assassin! Shut up!
JAZY
The boys are confused -- they think
I had their family killed.
PRICE
You murder people.
JAZY
"Murder" is a word for criminals. I
have a job to protect the stability
of a continent.
MUCHACHO #3
Pig! Hijo de puta!
JAZY
Please...
He is not begging for his life as much as for them to calm
down.
CLAIRE
You got caught by some boys?
JAZY
Yes. Poets too, I imagine.
(beat)
Is your recorder on?
CLAIRE
(hesitates)
Yes.
JAZY
Good. I have a speech to make.
The Muchachos don't understand what he's saying, but they
stop to listen to his style. The guns remained trained on
all three.
JAZY
I like you people, but you are
sentimental shits. You fall in love
with the poets, the poets fall in
love with the Marxists, the Marxists
fall in love with themselves. The
country is destroyed with rhetoric,
and in the end we are stuck with
tyrants.
MUCHACHO #1
(in Spanish)
Shut up!
Jazy turns to the boy who jams the gun into his head and
speaks with tired authority.
JAZY
Un minuto, por favor.
MUCHACHO #2
(to Price and Claire,
more calmly)
Who are you?
JAZY
(in Spanish)
They are journalists.
The Muchachos are immediately surprised and delighted, and
one of them speaks in excited, broken English.
MUCHACHO #1
Periodistas! Take this picture! I'm
going to blow his head off.
The Muchachos quickly withdraw their guns from Price and
Claire and aim them all at Jazy's head.
JAZY
Somoza? He is a tyrant too, of course.
A butcher.
(beat)
But finally that is not the point,
you see. If we wish to survive -- we
have a choice of tyrants, and for
all the right reasons, your poets
choose the wrong side.
MUCHACHO #1
(impatiently)
Fotografia!
PRICE
No.
JAZY
Yes.
(beat)
Your picture of Rafael was
brilliant... but I am alive, and
better looking. A good looking
Frenchman with a sympathetic face is
murdered in cold blood while fighting
for the survival of Europe and
America.
(beat)
You will have another magazine cover!
(smiles)
Muy complicado, no?
MUCHACHO #1
(in Spanish)
Ready! Now!
CLAIRE
You picked the wrong side.
JAZY
In fifty years we will know who's
right.
(beat)
Are you going to take the picture as
the bullet enters the skull or as it
comes out? This wall's a nice color,
eh? I can move into the sunlight.
CLAIRE TURNS AND WALKS AWAY, her back to the scene.
JAZY
(to Claire)
It's just a story!
PRICE REMAINS AND STARES AT JAZY as the Muchachos grow
increasingly impatient. Some part of him wants to take the
picture.
MUCHACHO #1
(in Spanish)
Shut up!
JAZY
They say that if somebody's holding
a gun on you, you should never stop
talking... that's the theory -- who
knows?...
PRICE TURNS AND WALKS AWAY toward Claire. Still -- Jazy talks.
JAZY
Maybe it's a good thing that I talk
too much...
A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT.
Price grimaces. Claire shuts her eyes. They turn to look at
the fallen Jazy as the Three Muchachos, frightened by their
own act, race back into the street. For several moments Price
and Claire stand, frozen, until the rumbling sound of a
helicopter gunship nearby forces them to hurry outside.
PRICE AND CLAIRE GO TO THE DOORWAY and look out as a jeep
full of Guardia screams past
P.O.V. SEVERAL GUERRILLAS RETREATING FROM AN ADVANCING
TANQUETTA a block away. The neighborhood seems to be changing
hands again.
Price and Claire slump in the darkness near the doorway; she
touches near his wounded arm.
CLAIRE
You okay?
(he nods)
Russell... what did Alex do?
PRICE
Nothing. He asked for directions.
She shakes her head and leans it against Price's shoulder
but the distant popping of guns does not even allow her a
moment of mourning. Their heads pop up nervously.
PRICE
We gotta get outta sight -- half the
fucking army's looking for me...
CLAIRE
They're not looking for me.
Silence.
CLAIRE
Let me have the film...
(beat; unsure)
...if I can't get to the hotel I'll
come back here...
Price doesn't want her to go alone, but he's not that excited
about hiding out in the middle of the city either.
PRICE
Aw, Christ...
(frustrated)
I've wrecked everything else, at
least let me take care of you here.
CLAIRE
Russell... it's more dangerous being
with you than being alone.
He knows she's right. He loves her, and he's made enough
disastrous decisions lately. He hesitates, then pops open
his camera and removes the film. Price ties the film into
the white flag that hangs from a stick stuck into her belt.
PRICE AND CLAIRE EMBRACE AND KISS BRIEFLY
PRICE
Don't get hurt.
CLAIRE
(affectionately)
That's great advice.
They kiss, and Claire runs out after a Red Cross truck. Price
watches nervously until they turn a corner, out of sight,
then goes back inside Jazy's courtyard. PRICE NEARLY STUMBLES
OVER JAZY'S BODY, stops, stares -- he'd forgotten already.
The body makes him uneasy, and after several moments he finds
a sheet and covers Jazy. Price then sits down and waits
nervously, sharing the courtyard with Jazy.
CUT TO:
THE BOY PEDALS slowly, in no hurry, past La Guardia troops.
Some of them watch him curiously, some ignore him. The white
flag flutters as he rides.
CUT TO:
CLAIRE ENTERS and stops. She calls out his name, no answer.
Price is gone. She hurries back outside.
CUT TO:
CLAIRE WALKS INTO THE POOL AREA where chairs and tables float
in the pool, the bar is overturned, and the once sumptuous
press oasis is a disaster.
CUT TO:
CLAIRE ENTERS A DESERTED LOBBY, also a mess, and hesitates
before climbing the circular stairs.
CLAIRE LOOKS INTO PRICE'S ROOM, and finds it empty, and
typically messy.
CLAIRE WALKS INTO HER OWN ROOM -- PRICE STANDS AT THE BALCONY
looking out at the jubilant city from which smoke still rises.
CLAIRE AND PRICE EMBRACE DEEPLY, holding onto each other
without the slightest intention of letting go.
DISSOLVE TO:
PRICE AND CLAIRE COME DOWNSTAIRS to the lobby. They are
cleaned up in fresh clothes; they have survived and the war
is over.
THE LOBBY IS COMING TO LIFE AGAIN with Regis' camera crew,
who look like they've had a long night, a BUS BOY, A MAID,
AN OLD COUPLE, and A WHITE WOMAN, 38, with TWO SMALL DAUGHTERS --
all either sit or mill in the b.g.
PRICE AND CLAIRE STOP SHORT at what they see.
PRICE
Alex.
P.O.V. -- A HANDMADE CASKET SITTING IN THE LOBBY with the
name, "A. Grazier" scrawled in felt pen.
Price and Claire stand next to the box silently -- there is
nothing to say -- but the silence is interrupted by a familiar
voice that is polite, unforced, and sincere.
VOICE OF HUB KITTLE
It was the best I would do under the
circumstances. The casket, I mean.
Awkward silence until they realize that he's sincere.
CLAIRE
Can you help us ship it home?
HUB
I've already taken care of it.
(beat)
I always liked the guy. I can't even
get tickets for my own family, but I
could get you two on the plane if
you want.
We see the woman and little girls as Hub's family.
PRICE
Yes, please...
HUB
Tacho's in Miami.
A shared silence at the lunacy of the moment, interrupted by
the tired voice of one of Hub's daughters.
HUB'S DAUGHTER
Daddy!
HUB
(to Price and Claire)
I am sorry. I had a job to do --
that's all -- it put me in some
unhappy situations.
Hub goes over to take care of his family.
CUT TO:
