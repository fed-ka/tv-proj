GRUG
Come on, come on. Darkness brings death!
We know this.
The Croods RUN INSIDE THE CAVE. Ugga picks up a heavy
stick off the floor.
UGGA
The moon is full. Bath night.
(grumbling, Gran tries to run
AWAY)
You too, Mom.
GRAN
Run for your life.
Ugga pulls Gran back.
GRAN (CONT'D)
I don't want to lose my protective layer.
UGGA
Mom, you've got ants.
(hanging Sandy up)
Whack! Like she's cleaning a rug, Ugga SMACKS Sandy hard
with the stick. Dust and bugs fly off of her.
UGGA (CONT'D)
See? Sandy doesn't fuss.
Ugga CLAPS her hands together and Sandy knows to let go.
She hits the floor and SCAMPERS away.
GRAN
(UPSET)
Aaaaaaaaaah.
Grug enters and looks around the cave.
GRUG
Is she still out there?
UGGA
You know she hates the cave, Grug.
ON EEP clinging to the side of the sheer rock face above
Crood cave. She RAISES HER HAND to `catch' a few more
moments of sun.
10.
EEP
Please come back tomorrow.
ON GRUG getting his `bath.'
GRUG
How can she not like the cave? It's so
cozy.
UGGA
It is a little, dark, Grug.
GRUG
It's not that dark.
Grug is finished with his bath.
GRUG (CONT'D)
(LOSING PATIENCE)
Eep! Eep?
Eep begins to climb down the wall outside when she hears
a sound in the distance. Curious, she begins to climb
even higher. Grug leaves the cave, searching for her.
GRUG (CONT'D)
Come on, I gotta close the cave...
ON GRUG exiting the cave... Grug sees that Eep is at the
very top.
GRUG (CONT'D)
Eep!
Eep continues to climb.
EEP
Okay, okay!
GRUG
Come on.
Behind Grug, the Bear Owl appears up the canyon. It
SPOTS Grug and the open cave and RACES to attack. Grug
sees the BearOwl in full attack mode.
GRUG (CONT'D)
EEP! COME DOWN!!
Grug throws a rock which momentarily stuns the creature,
allowing Eep to JUMP DOWN and DART into the cave. Grug
barely gets the cave closed in time.
11.
GRUG (CONT'D)
SIGH
CUT TO:
SEQ. 210 - BEDTIME STORY
The Bear Owl PUSHES his paw through the narrow opening,
and FEELS around for the Croods. The Croods are like
mice in this world.
GRUG
That was too close!
EEP
I was watching. I was fine.
GRUG
What were you doing up there, Eep?
EEP
I don't know.
GRUG
What were you looking for?
EEP
Nothing.
GRUG
Well then why did you go up there?
EEP
(ANNOYED)
I don't know.
GRUG
Why don't you know? Stop looking for
things. Fear keeps us alive Eep. Never
not be afraid.
Eep climbs up on a ledge and curls up in the corner where
a tiny spot of light seeps in.
EEP
(TO HERSELF)
What's the point of all this?
GRUG
Hmmm? What was that?
12.
EEP
(a little louder)
I mean, why are we here? What are we
doing this for?
CROODS
GROAN
GRUG
No one said survival was fun.
EEP
Nothing is fun.
GRUG
Hmm? Would you come down here. Eep?
No answer. Grug CLIMBS up. Ugga PULLS Grug back down.
UGGA
Grug. Off.
GRUG
Yes.
Grug climbs back up.
UGGA
Off!
GRUG
I just don't see why she needs her own
ledge. That's all. That's what this is
about.
UGGA
She's working through some things and
needs her own space.
GRUG
What things? How long is this going to
take? Really? I mean she already
doesn't listen to me.
A pebble hits Grug in the head. It came from Eep's
ledge.
GRUG (CONT'D)
Hey!
UGGA
See? She's listening.
13.
GRUG
If she wants to survive, she has to
follow our rules.
UGGA
How about a story? Eep loves those.
Grug brightens.
GRUG
(BRIGHTENING)
That's a good idea ... How about a story,
huh?
THUNK
Oh yeah, tell us a story.
The Croods minus Eep gather in a semi-circle on the
ground. Grug retrieves Sandy and her Krispy Bear from
the bone-crib.
GRUG
Ok. Can I borrow that? Thank you. Eep!
Your old favorite?
EEP
I haven't played with that thing in
years.
GRUG
Tonight we'll hear the story of Krispy
Bear.
Grug sits and waits a beat for Eep to join, but she stays
put.
As Grug talks, he gestures at a rough sketch on the wall
of the cave.
GRUG (CONT'D)
A long time ago, this little bear was
alive. She was alive because she
listened to her father and lived her life
in routine and darkness and terror. So
she was happy. But Krispy had one,
terrible problem. She was filled with...
curiosity.
UGGA
Grug!
Ugga covers Sandy's ears.
14.
GRUG
Yes. And one day, while she was in a
tree, the curious little bear wanted to
climb to the top.
THUNK
Wha?
GRUG
And no sooner than she climbed to the
top, she saw something new and died.
Grug SWATS the painting.
THUNK
Just like that?
GRUG
Yes! Her last moments of terror still
frozen on her face.
Grug holds out Krispy Bear. The family is terrified.
GRAN
Oh, same ending as everyday.
THUNK
(FREAKED OUT)
I get it, dad. I get it. I will never
do anything new or different.
GRUG
Good man, Thunk.
Pan across the walls to reveal they are covered with
stories all seemingly with the same ending.
UGGA
Alright, everyone sharpen your teeth and
let's pile up.
All their worst fears confirmed, the Croods snuggle into
one big heap, warm and comfy. Grug casts a glance to
Eep's ledge. She doesn't budge.
FADE TO BLACK:
SEQ. 500 - FOLLOW THE LIGHT
15.
The Croods sleep peacefully in their pile. Except Eep,
who tosses restlessly on her LEDGE. Outside, we hear the
ROARS and HOWLS of prehistoric creatures fighting.
But then, SILENCE.
And then cutting through the primordial night is a
MUSICAL SOUND. Unsettling. Unearthly. Eep creeps
around her sleeping family and cautiously approaches the
"door" to peer outside, when suddenly--
WHOOSH! A bright light blazes through the gaps around
the boulder door, bathing Eep in an OTHER-WORLDLY GLOW.
She chases the flash of light around the cave trying to
catch it in her hands.
Eep presses her face against the cold boulder, trying to
get a look at what is outside, but she can't get more
than a blurred glimpse of the canyon beyond - and the
disappearing light.
Desperate to see more, Eep braces her back against the
cave and PUSHES the plug rock with her legs. Slowly, she
shifts the rock, careful not to wake her father. It takes
all of her strength, but she manages to move it just
enough for her to BARELY SQUEEZE out.
Grug is awakened by wind coming from the cave opening.
He pushes the "sleep pile" off of him. Checks Eep's
ledge... but she is gone.
GRUG
(TO UGGA)
Eep's gone.
UGGA
What? Grug!
GRUG
Stay in the cave!
Grug stands outside the entrance to the cave. Peering
into utter darkness. He steels himself... and then
releases his hand from the "door."
CUT TO:
SEQ. 560 - CLOSE ENCOUNTERS (PART II)
Grug grabs two pieces of flint and starts clicking them
together, just as Guy did earlier. They ignite. Grug
has created his very first fire.
GRUG
(PLEASED)
Hey, I did it.
Another earthquake shakes the cavern. Grug moves over to
a wall and uses some nearby mud to paint a portrait of
his family. He paints each member individually and then
looks longingly at the family he will never see again.
The torch begins to go out. Grug blows on it and is
startled by the massive Macawnivore beast, growling at
him.
GRUG (CONT'D)
Ahhhh! Back! Stay back! Stay back!
The Macawnivore blows out the torch. Another meteor hits
the cave with a loud boom! The Macawnivore stops growling
and starts blowing on the torch along with Grug. It is
just as frightened as Grug. Grug reaches out and pets
the now gentle carnivorous beast.
Grug and the Macawnivore huddle together in a prehistoric
armistice. When suddenly, Grug hears the dim tone of
Eep's "shell signal." He rushes to the entrance to the
cave. He surveys the raging CATACLYSM outside the cave
as the world is being torn asunder.
He hears the SHELL ALARM blow TWO MORE TIMES. His family
is in trouble.
GRUG
They're in trouble. Hang on! I'm
coming.
The scale of his problem sinks in.
GRUG (CONT'D)
How do I get across? Gotta think. What
would Guy do? What would Guy do?
Something occurs to Grug.
86.
GRUG (CONT'D)
What would I do?
He absent-mindedly hands the torch to the Macawnivore.
GRUG (CONT'D)
Hold this.
Grug CLOSES HIS EYES, and CONCENTRATES.
The ember of a thought FLICKERS TO LIFE in Grug's brain.
GRUG (CONT'D)
I... have... an... IDEA!
MACAWNIVORE
Erm?
