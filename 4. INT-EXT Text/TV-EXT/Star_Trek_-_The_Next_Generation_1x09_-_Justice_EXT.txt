2  CLOSER ON ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

    emphasizing the starship's line.

                      PICARD (V.O.)
                  (continuing)
            ... them with all their basic
              necessities, we have discovered
              another Class M planet in the
              adjoining Rubicun star system.


  The same lovely planet.

                      PICARD (V.O.)
            We are in orbit of a planet
              designated Rubicun Three... and
            have found it to be the home of
            a life form who call themselves
            the Edo.


  The planet is as described. We are at an inhabited
    part of it... clean, neat, the "streets" appearing more
    like a running track, bordered with flowers. The
    TRANSPORTER EFFECT brings in our new away team of Riker,
    Troi, Tasha, Worf and Wesley. In the near distance, a
    group of very human appearing people have seen them
    arriving and two of them turn and race in this direction.
    Worf is quickly aware of it and prepares to interpose
    himself protectively.

                      WORF
              Careful, sir...

                      RIKER
            It's all right, Lieutenant, these
            are the Edo we met.

8  ANGLE ON THE EDO

    ARRIVING at high speed. A young female and male who,
    like other Edo we'll meet, are both tall, full haired,
  with even white teeth, great bodies. They're also
    dressed in loose, sexy clothing and these two wear a
    silvery necklace indicating high rank. Riker is
    watching an attractive Edo woman, saying:

                      RIKER
            They certainly are... fit, right?

  Troi is looking at an Edo male.           STAR TREK: "Justice" - 9/4/87 - ACT ONE           7.

8  CONTINUED:

                      TROI
            They certainly are.

                      RIVAN
              Health and happiness!

                      LIATOR
            A pleasant day to you!

    Troi gives Riker an even sharper second look as the Edo
    ARRIVE and RIVAN, the woman, gives Riker a close and
    rather intimate hands-on hug which, although it touches
    upon the sensual, also combines genuine friendship, too.

                      RIVAN
            You did return as promised!

  The man, LIATOR, is looking over Troi and Tasha with
    healthy interest. Like Rivan, although slim and very
  well muscled, he has a quiet dignity that fits well with
    this necklace-badge of leadership.

                      RIKER
              Rivan, Liator...
                  (indicating)
            Also from our vessel is Troi...

                      LIATOR
              Slowly, slowly...
                  (embraces Troi)
            I must also welcome this lovely
              one...
                  (embracing Tasha)
            ... and this lovely one...

    Riker waits, watching with interest until Tasha
    disengages. She understands his look.

                      TASHA
                  (smiles)
            My pleasure.

                      TROI
              Healthy sensuality, sir. I feel                                    
          mainly happinessand friendship.

                      RIVAN
            And I welcome this huge one...
                  (hugs and fondles Worf)
            ... oh, yes, yes...           STAR TREK: "Justice" - 9/4/87 - ACT ONE           8.

                      WORF
                  (pleased)
            Nice planet!

    Rivan moves to Wesley, stops quizzically.

                      RIVAN
            But you are a young one. I do
            not know your custom regarding
            love.

    Wesley is clearly nervous, although intrigued too. He
    clears his throat:

                      WESLEY
            Uh... I guess... whatever you
              usually do...

    Rivan shows excellent taste, giving Wesley a "hug" but
    without any "extras."

                      RIKER
              Others would like to visit here
            too. If you'll tell us what
              limits you'd place on the
              number...

                      LIATOR
              Whatever pleases you. We can
              discuss it at the Council
              Chambers.

                      RIVAN
                  (to Riker)
            Shall we go there now or remain
            and play?

                      RIKER
            Play?

                      RIVAN
            At love. Unless you don't enjoy
            that.
                  (to Worf)
              Perhaps you do?

                      LIATOR
                  (to Troi)
            And you? Yes, I can see that you
            do.           STAR TREK: "Justice" - 9/4/87 - ACT ONE           9.

8  CONTINUED: (3)

                      WESLEY
              Listen, maybe I'll just go on
              ahead...

                      RIVAN
                  (indicates Wesley)
            This is unfair to him.
                  (to Wesley)
            We'll go to the Council Chambers.
              You'll find young people your age
              there.

                      WESLEY
                  (warily)
              Well... I really can't make any
              promises...

                      LIATOR
                  (laughs)
            You don't have to. Our rules are
              simple. No one does anything
              uncomfortable to them.

                      RIVAN
            Come! Our people will want to
            know you.

    Then she turns back, glancing at the more formal
    clothing worn by the humans.

                      LIATOR
              Rivan, perhaps they...can't...run.

                      WESLEY
                  (to Riker)
            Can't run? Sure we can run, right
            sir?

                      RIKER
                  (to the others)
              That's the custom here, running...
                  (to Wesley)
              Right! Lead the way!

    Rivan, Liator, and Wesley LEAD OFF, the Others JOGGING
    AFTER them.          STAR TREK: "Justice" - 9/4/87 - ACT ONE          10.

    Rivan and Liator leading the Enterprise people along
    another lovely pathway where an elderly but very trim
    FIRST EDO CITIZEN and a pair of younger N.D. EDO
    CITIZENS see them coming and break into a run to join
    them. Lots of smiles and waves.

9B TRUCKING - EMPHASIZING AWAY TEAM AND FIRST EDO CITIZZEN

  The Enterprise people very much taken with the joy and
    good health they're seeing. First Edo citizen notes
    Tasha's light complexion and amazon form.

                      FIRST EDO CITIZEN
            Good health to you!

                      TASHA
              Happiness to you!
                  (to Troi)
            It's like an "Eden" here.


  A combination of conference and recreation facilities,
    lots of light and air and spectacularly healthy looking
    people in revealing but comfortable garb. SOUND of
    delighted ADULT LAUGHTER from inside the chambers too.
  Two adults and a child DEPART on the run, another older
  woman ARRIVES -- on the run too. She doesn't seem to
  be breathing very hard at all.

11 ANGLE ON RIKER AND TEAM

    ARRIVING on the run with their Edo companions. They
    haven't done too badly. Rivan stops, looks Riker and
  the Enterprise people over, then moves in and embraces
    Riker again.          STAR TREK: "Justice" - 9/4/87 - ACT ONE          11.

                      RIVAN
            Good health! I thought you might
            be out of breath.

  A SHRIEK from children at play, several Edo children
    race INTO SIGHT.

                      LIATOR
              Children, we've brought you a new
              friend!

                      FIRST EDO BOY
              Hello! Join us!

                      EDO GIRL
            Yes, please!

    Wesley joins the smiling children.

                      RIKER
                  (grins)
            We may surprise you in a lot of
            ways.


  The same lovely planet.

30 CLOSER ON ENTRY

  as Wesley comes INTO VIEW with THREE EDO YOUTHS of about
  his own age, two male and one a very pretty young female
  who has very much caught Wesley's attention. The boys
    have a ball; they're all smiling, laughing.

                      FIRST EDO BOY
              Watch! You can't do this!

  The Edo boy stands expertly on his hands. Wesley eyes
    this, decides to do something else. He turns a series
  of cartwheels. The Edo kids CHEER with enthusiasm,
    especially the girl who hugs Wesley impulsively.

                      EDO GIRL
            I want to do something too! With
            you.

                      WESLEY
                  (loses smile; warily)
            Uh... What?

                      EDO GIRL
              Something you can teach me. Will
            you?          STAR TREK: "Justice" - 9/4/87 - ACT TWO          21.

            Well, actually, there are some
            games I... uh, don't quite know
              yet...

                      EDO GIRL
            It's playing ball. Will you teach
            me?

                      WESLEY
                  (relieved)
            Oh, sure. If you have a bat for
            the ball, I'll show you my
              favorite.
                  (sees their puzzlement)
            A bat...
                  (shows measurement)
            ... a stick or branch, about this
              thick, this long...

                      EDO GIRL
            We can get it from the gardens.

    They race OFF leading the way, beginning to toss the
    ball back and forth.


    Wesley INTO VIEW with his friends, still tossing the
    ball back and forth. He makes a difficult catch,
    capturing the Edo girls' admiration again. (In b.g.
  is an attractive, glassed potting shed surrounded by
  a low white fence.)

                      EDO GIRL
              You're very clever at this!

    Wesley decides to show off, runs ahead...

                      WESLEY
            At home we play a lot of it.
                  (gestures; running
                 ahead)
            Here, toss the ball ahead of me!

  Which is done, but it is going over his head.

35   CLOSE ON EDO GIRL

    registering concern.

                      EDO GIRL
            No, Wes...

36   PANNING WESLEY

    making a strong effort to reach the ball, leaping a
  neat white fence at the potting enclosure. The Boys
  are now registering too.

                      FIRST EDO BOY
                  (shouting)
            No! It's forbidden to disturb
            the new plants... !

    Leaping for the ball, missing... falling into the
    potting shed.         STAR TREK: "Justice" - 9/4/87 - ACT THREE         26.

38   GROUP SHOT - THE YOUNG PEOPLE

  The girl hanging back, ANXIOUS. The boys pressing in,
    short of the white fence. Wesley lying in the broken
    glass of the Shed.

                      FIRST EDO BOY
              Couldn't you see the fence?
              That's for new plants...

                      SECOND EDO BOY
                  (overlapping first)
            Don't ever go past a white

                      WESLEY
                  (getting up)
              What's wrong?

  The the girl sees someone approaching from O.S., reacts
    horrified, SCREAMS.

39   WIDER ANGLE

    REVEALING a pair of Edo MEDIATORS (local law
    enforcement) hurrying toward the potting shed area in
    b.g. They are middle-aged men, exceedingly trim and
      healthy-looking, also kindly in appearance. Their only
    indication of office is a neat belt and pouch. But at
  the sight of them the girl SHRIEKS AGAIN and it is from
    genuine despair and fear for Wesley.

                      EDO GIRL
            Oh, no! Oh, please, no!

40   PAN THE MEDIATORS IN

  as Wesley climbs back over the fence, brushing himself
  off. The Edo young people now back away, awed at what
  has happened.

                      FIRST MEDIATOR
            Speak the truth. We are

                  (genuinely)
            How very sad. But this zone has
            been selected.

                      FIRST EDO BOY
            He doesn't understand!

                  (nods)
            It's always sad... now doubly so.

    SOUND OF RUNNING STEPS, heralding:

              What's happening here?

41   ANGLE TO INCLUDE RIKER AND TROI

    HURRYING IN to where the two Mediators stand with

                  (to Riker)
            I was chasing a ball...
                  (indicating shed)
            ... and fell into that. I'm
              really sorry!

                        MEDIATOR
            You admit you did that? Freely?

    Wesley straightens up, throwing a look toward Riker.

                      WESLEY
            I'm with Starfleet. We don't
            lie.

    Riker gives Wesley a look with some pride hidden in it.         STAR TREK: "Justice" - 9/4/87 - ACT THREE         28.

                  (to Mediators)
            It won't happen again. We
              apologize.

                      FIRST MEDIATOR
            We're sorry, too. But that
              changes nothing.

  TO INCLUDE the rest of the away team, Tasha and Worf,
  as they ARRIVE.

                      TASHA
              Careful, Commander, they've got
            some strange laws here...

                      RIKER
            I thought you reviewed the laws
            here.

                      TASHA
            But they list nothing about
              punishment. That's what all this
            is about.

                      FIRST MEDIATOR
            One moment, please...
                  (to young Edo)
            Is there a witness to this
              transgression?

    Hesitantly, sadly, the other young people nod.

                      FIRST EDO BOY
            But it was my fault; I threw the
            ball past him...

                      FIRST MEDIATOR
            We have a visible transgression,
            ample witnesses, and an admission
            of guilt...
                  (to Wesley)
            ... and it deeply pains us to do
            what we must. Are you prepared
            for punishment?

    First Mediator has opened his pouch during this, brought
  out a small device (to be identified as a syringe).
    Second Mediator has stepped to get to the rear of
    Wesley, trying to get past Riker.

                      SECOND MEDIATOR
                  (to Riker)
              Please?

                      WORF
              Punishment? If you mean what the
              others were talking about...

                      RIKER
                  (demanding)
            What kind of punishment? Name
            it!

                      FIRST MEDIATOR
              Death, of course! Don't make
            it...
                  (raising syringe)
            ... difficult for the boy...

    Second Mediator has now squeezed past Riker, obviously
    intending to grab Wesley's arms from the rear... and
  is up-ended fast by Riker while Tasha and Worf bring
  out phasers trained directly on First Mediator.

                      WORF
            Drop that; drop it now!

  The Mediators seem even more stunned by what the humans
    have done. The syringe has been dropped; Tasha
    retrieves it, holds it for Riker's examination.

                      TASHA
            It's a kind of syringe...

    Riker grabs it, holds it under First Mediator's nose.         STAR TREK: "Justice" - 9/4/87 - ACT THREE         30.

                      RIKER
            What is this? You said "death;"
            is it "poison?"

                      FIRST MEDIATOR
                  (offended; very upset)
              But... but of course it is!
              Completely painless; the boy would
            have felt nothing...
                  (indicating Wesley)
            But look at him now. You've
              frightened him!

                      WESLEY
                    (disbelieving)
            He was going to kill me?

                      SECOND MEDIATOR
                  (to Riker)
            And if this Zone were still in
              effect, you would all deserve
              death.

                      FIRST MEDIATOR
            It was announced you came as
              friends. Is this how friends act?

    During which Riker has touched his insignia.

                      RIKER
              Enterprise from away team, come
            in.
                  (waits)
            Are you receiving us, Enterprise?

                      TASHA
                  (touching insignia)
              Urgent, Enterprise. Please
              respond!

              Captain's log, supplemental. We
            have encountered a strange
              vessel-like object, one with
              frightening power, which appears
            to exist partly in another
              dimension. On the world below...


    ESTABLISHING. As before, both young and old are seen
    traveling easily at a run.

              opportunity among delightful
              inhabitants of a lovely Earthlike
              planet... has led incredibly to
            a death sentence...


    still in orbit of the planet together.


  The mystery object between starship and planet, their
    relative positions not moving.

              Whatever the object or vessel in
            orbit with us, it hangs there like
            a "nemesis". It is one thing
            to communicate with something
              mysterious...


    Only a few Edo in sight. It's getting late in the day.


    both still in orbit.


  as it begins leaving orbit.
