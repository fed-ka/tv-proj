  Showtime/Sony/Original Film      EXT. CATHY S HOUSE/BACK YARD - MORNING (D-1)

      Cathy  (prettier than she realizes, tendency to apologize for 
    no reason, dry sense of humor) stands in her modest back yard 
      with BRADLEY, a burly, early 40 scontractor.  

                                  BRADLEY
                    You want me to put a pool in this 
                    yard?

                                  CATHY
                    Yes.  Please.  Yes, please.

                                  BRADLEY
                          (laughing)
                    Unless you want to tear that fence 
                    down and ask your neighbors to go 
                    in halvsieswith ya, I don t think 
                    it s going to fit.

                                  CATHY
                    I know it s small but--

                                  BRADLEY
                     Cause once you get your patio 
                    around it--

                                  CATHY
                    I was thinking--

                                  BRADLEY
                    And that s a nice shade tree over 
                    there so you ll wanna leave that.  

                                  CATHY
                    I don t care about--

                                  BRADLEY
                    By then you ll have to make it so 
                    narrow that you wouldn t want to go 
                    any deeper than three feet and 
                    Hell, if you want to get wet that 
                    bad, I d tell you to save your 
                    money and take a bath.

      Beat.

                                  CATHY
                          (disappointed)
                    I m sorry I wasted your time.  I 
                    guess--                                                                                      2


                                  BRADLEY
                    What you oughtta do is let us bump 
                    out your deck here, put in a sunken 
                    hot tub and a little bbq pit over 
                    here, and I think that d be nice.  
                    An outdoor living room if you will.

                                  CATHY
                          (hesitant)
                    Okay, that s fine.  Just do that.
                    How fast could you finish it?

                                  BRADLEY
                    Well, it s the first day of summer, 
                    our busy season--

                                  CATHY
                    I ll pay extra.

                                  BRADLEY
                    I still got three jobs ahead of you-

                                  CATHY
                    I ll pay double.

                                  BRADLEY
                    I ll have a crew out here in the 
                    morning.

                                  CATHY
                    Sounds perfect. 

      They shake hands.

                                  CATHY (CONT'D)
                    Happy first day of summer.  

                                  BRADLEY
                    And to you.

      Bradley heads up the driveway and gets into his truck with a 
       COOL POOLS  sign on the side of it.  As he pulls away, 
      CATHY S HUSBAND PAUL(kid at heart, irresponsible but 
      lovable) rides up on his Vespa.

                                  PAUL
                    Is that your new lover?  Is that 
                    why I m sleeping on my sister s 
                    couch? (singing)  Everybody s 
                    Cooler with a Pool!  Be cool with 
                    Cool pools!  Is the Cool Pool s guy 
                    filling your pool, Cathy?                                                                                       3


                                  CATHY
                    I m going to bump out the deck and 
                    put in a hot tub.

                                  PAUL
                    I thought you wanted a new 
                      backsplashfor the kitchen.  I 
                    don t know who you are anymore.  

                                  CATHY
                    Shouldn t you be at work already?  

                                  PAUL
                    I came by to get the heating pad 
                    you use for your cramps.

    He turns his back and puts his hand on his shoulder.

                                  PAUL (CONT D)
                    Feel this.

    She does.

                                  CATHY
                    That s a big knot.  

                                  PAUL
                    Lisa s couch is giving me adult 
                    onset scoliosis.  I m going to have 
                    to start making my own shirts with 
                    an extra sleeve in the back.  Could 
                    you just rub it for one second?

    She does.

                                  PAUL (CONT D)
                    Oh yeah.  Really get in there.  

      He s hunched over, leaning into the rub.

                                  PAUL (CONT D)
                    Oh, I miss this.  I miss you. 
                    You ve gotta tell me what s going 
                    on so we can fix this, Cathy.  

    She stops rubbing.

                                  CATHY
                    I m sorry.  I have to go, Paul.  I 
                    have an appointment with the 
                      dermatologist.                                                                                      4


                                  PAUL
                    Can we have dinner tonight?  So we 
                    can discuss the fate of our 
                    marriage or at the very least 
                    decide what we re going to tell 
                    Adam tomorrow?  Because right now 
                    my story is--Adam, your mom s a 
                    meanie.

                                  CATHY
                    Okay.  Dinner.

                                  PAUL
                    Good.  Where s the heating--

                                  CATHY
                    In the linen closet.

                                  PAUL
                    Which one s the linen--

                                  CATHY
                    In the hallway.

                                  PAUL
                    I love you.

    He heads into the house.  Cathy notices her ELDERLY NEIGHBOR 
      SITTING ON THE PORCH OF HER RUN DOWN HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET. 
    She has a faraway look and a scowl on her face.  Grass is 
      growing up around her TIRED OLD BASSET HOUNDwho lays in the 
      yard.  Cathy smiles and waves at the old woman.

                                  CATHY
                    Happy first day of summer!

    The old woman gets up and goes inside.  

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                          (to herself)  Okay, then.

      INT. DOCTOR S OFFICE - LATER (D-1)

      Cathy sits on an exam table in a PAPER ROBEtalking to young 
      handsome DR. TODDwho listens patiently.

                                  CATHY
                    We didn t really have that much 
                    money growing up but we did have a 
                    pool in our back yard and my 
                    brother and I would stay in it all 
                    summer making up dives.  My 
                    signature was the Banana Split and 
                    Dive.                                                                                        5


                                  DR. TODD
                    Sounds fun.

                                  CATHY
                    Except when Sean would hold me 
                    under the water and fart on my 
                    face.  

    She glances down to see that her paper robe is slightly open 
    in the front.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    Oh, hello breast.  How long has 
                    that been happening?

                                  DR. TODD
                    I didn t notice.

                                  CATHY
                    Well, screw you.  Anyway, in regard 
                    to your question, I don t think I 
                    want to do that.

                                  DR. TODD
                    Not at all?

                                  CATHY
                    I just have always liked my hair.  
                    I cry every time I get it cut. 

                                  DR. TODD
                    You won t necessarily lose your 
                    hair.

                                  CATHY
                    My nose is another story.  If you 
                    told me I was going to lose my nose-

    He hands her A BROCHURE.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    What s this?

                                  DR. TODD
                    Some information on alternative 
                      treatments.

                                  CATHY
                    Oh, crap.  I thought it was a cure.

                                  DR. TODD
                    How does your husband feel?                                                                                      6


                                  CATHY
                    He has a knot in his back from 
                    sleeping weird.  He s using a 
                    heating pad. Is that what you d 
                    recommend? (offDr. Todd s look)  I 
                    haven t told him yet.

    Dr. Todd is clearly taken aback.

                                  DR. TODD
                    I grew up with parents who 
                    perfected the art of talking about 
                    each other in front of each other 
                    but not actually to each other, and 
                    still, you ve shocked me.  

                                  CATHY
                    I m just kind of a private person.  
                    Except around you.  I can t seem to 
                    shut up around you.  

    He hands her ANOTHER BROCHURE.

                                  DR. TODD
                    Here are some tips on how to tell 
                    your loved ones.  A lot of people 
                    find it difficult.  

                                  CATHY
                    Are you married?

                                  DR. TODD 
                    No.  But I think I d want to know.

                                  CATHY
                    I planned to tell him.  But when I 
                    got home that day, he had trapped a 
                    mouse under a skillet and was 
                    standing there waiting for me to 
                    come do something about it and I 
                    just found myself saying  I need to 
                    be alone for a while.   

    He hands her yet ANOTHER BROCHURE.

                                  DR. TODD
                    Some support groups you might be 
                    interested in. 

                                  CATHY
                    I just got an image of when you do 
                    get married, you and your bride 
                    standing at the altar passing 
                    brochures back and forth.                                                                                      7


                                  DR. TODD
                    Don t you think you should be 
                    honest with your family?  

                                  CATHY
                    Honesty is overrated.  White lies 
                    can really keep a marriage 
                    together.  You re single so you 
                    still romanticize the idea of a 
                    symbiotic relationship with no 
                    secrets.

                                  DR. TODD
                    Can you tell your brother?

                                  CATHY
                    I m afraid he d just try to squeeze 
                    in one last attempt to fart on my 
                    face for old times sake.

                                  DR. TODD
                    I don t have a brochure for that.

                                  CATHY
                    Then are we done?

    He hands her a prescription.

                                  DR. TODD
                    As needed for discomfort.  

                                  CATHY
                    Wow.  I should get in touch with my 
                    college boyfriend and see if he 
                    still has his bong.

                                  DR. TODD
                    You don t have to.  You can get it 
                    in cigarettes, tea, cookies, 
                      brownies...

                                  CATHY
                    Can I mix and match?

                                  DR. TODD
                    I believe you can.

                                  CATHY
                    I believe I will.

                                  DR. TODD
                    Tell someone, Cathy.

      Beat.                                                                                      8


                                  CATHY
                    Can I tell you?

    Dr. Todd smiles and exits.  Cathy looks at the prescription 
    in her hand.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    Cookies, huh?

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      INT. CAR   LATER (D-1)

      Cathy eats A BIG POT COOKIE as she drives and sings DELTA 
      DAWNalong with the radio.  

      EXT. GROCERY PARKING LOT - LATER (D-1)

      SEAN, (LATE 20 S, POSSIBLY HOMELESS, ATTRACTIVE IN THAT 
      HEROINE CHIC WAY, SKINNY, LONG HAIR) is jumping rope in front 
    of the store.  His rope is made of plastic shopping bags tied 
      together, a stone tied to the middle of it for weight.  He s 
      proselytizing to shoppers as they exit with groceries.

                                  SEAN
                    It takes one plastic bag two 
                    hundred years to disintegrate in a 
                    land fill!  When you carry your 
                    eggs home in a plastic bag you 
                    might as well put it over your 
                    child s head and suffocate them 
                    with it because you re destroying 
                    their future!

      Cathy pulls up in front of him and lowers her window.

                                  CATHY
                    Did you go to business school to 
                    learn to appeal to people like 
                    that? 

                                  SEAN
                    No, I went to Shut the Fuck Up 
                    Technical Institute.

                                  CATHY
                    I bet you were first in your class. 

                                  SEAN
                    No, but I slept with her.

                                  CATHY
                    Lovely.  Get in the car.                                                                                      9


                                  SEAN
                    Come back and pick me up on a bike.

                                  CATHY
                    I have something to tell you.

                                  SEAN
                    Go tell it on a mountain.

                                  CATHY
                    Get in the damn car, Sean.  

      Beat.  Sean reluctantly rolls up his jump rope like a garden 
      hose and gets in.

                                  SEAN
                    You could at least buy a hybrid.

                                  CATHY
                    You could at least take a shower.

      Cathy holds her breath and leans out the window as they drive 
      off.

      INT. MCDONALD S - LATER (D-1)

      Sean waits calmly next to a trash can as a DAD WITH THREE 
      KIDSapproaches with their garbage.

                                  SEAN
                    I ll take that for you, sir.

                                  DAD
                    (confused)  Oh.  Okay, thanks.

    He hands over their trays and exits with his kids.  Sean 
      picks up a half eaten burger and shoves it in his mouth as he 
      joins Cathy at a table.  She has a mountain of food in front 
      her.

                                  CATHY
                    Gross. 

                                  SEAN
                    I know you are.  

                                  CATHY
                    I would have bought you a meal.

                                  SEAN
                    We throw away a ton of food in this 
                    country every single day.  And not 
                    a figurative ton, an actual ton.

                                  SEAN (CONT'D)
                    (re: Cathy s tray)  Besides, I 
                    wouldn t want to take food out of 
                    the mouths of all those tape worms 
                    you re feeding.  

                                  CATHY
                    Never comment on a woman s meal.

                                  SEAN
                    You ve never been a woman to me, 
                    Cathy. (then)  So what did you want 
                    to tell me?

      Cathy stares at him for a beat.

                                  CATHY
                    You re an asshole.

      Cathy takes a check out of her purse and hands it across the 
      table.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    Here.

                                  SEAN
                    I don t want this.

                                  CATHY
                    Just some money to tuck away--

                                  SEAN
                    (robotic)  I. Do. Not. Want. It. 
                    (normal)  Have we met?

                                  CATHY
                    Look, you don t have to spend it, 
                    just put it in savings and if you 
                    decide to get an apartment or stay 
                    in a hotel for a while, if it gets 
                    cold out--

                                  SEAN
                    I feel like I m on a train in 
                    Europe and you re a little German 
                    man and I m me and we re sitting 
                    across from each other and we re 
                    talking but neither of us can 
                    really understand the other one.

                                  CATHY
                    I understand that you love shocking 
                    people and you think the way you re 
                    living is a good idea right now.

                                  CATHY (CONT'D)
                    But...just take it as a favor to 
                    me.  

                                  SEAN
                    Fine.  I ll give it to the 
                    Salvation Army.

      Beat.

                                  CATHY
                    Fine.  If you don t want it I ll 
                    keep it.

    She takes the money order back.

                                  SEAN
                    Okay, wait a minute. So you want me 
                    to have it as long as I do what you 
                    want me to do with it.  

                                  CATHY
                    I want you to spend it on yourself!  
                    I want you to be happy.

                                  SEAN
                    No, YOU want to be happy and you 
                    think this will do it for you.  
                    This isn t about me.  I mfriggin  
                    ecstatic.  I wish you knew what 
                    that felt like.

                                  CATHY
                    What does that mean?  You don t 
                    think I m happy?

                                  SEAN
                    Look, I don t want to be a judge 
                    because that s your thing, but 
                    eight out of the ten times I saw 
                    you last year all you could talk 
                    about was whether you were going to 
                    buy a couch from Crate and Barrel 
                    or Pottery Farm--

                                  CATHY
                    Barn.                                                                                    12


                                  SEAN
                    Like I care.  One was cheaper but 
                    the other one had a nicer fabric 
                    and ultimately you decided to stick 
                    with the one you already had 
                    because it s a safe neutral with a 
                    few good years still left in it and 
                    the cushions are reversible so if 
                    you turned them over you really 
                    couldn t see that stain.  Oh God am 
                    I glad you worked through that!  
                    Meanwhile, I still close my eyes at 
                    night and see color swatches with 
                    names like Harvest Light and 
                    Crimson Rose!   

                                  CATHY
                    That doesn t mean I m not happy.

                                  SEAN
                    Oh, good, then you re just really 
                    fucking boring. 

                                  CATHY
                    Well, at least I don t smell like 
                    feet.

                                  SEAN
                    I know you re embarrassed of me, 
                    Cathy.  You don t have to make 
                    little jabs about it because they 
                    hurt you more than they do me.  But 
                    I m embarrassed of you, too.  
                    Because somewhere along the way my 
                    fun, interesting, kooky sister got 
                    boring.  And even more than 
                      embarrassed that makes me sad.

      Cathy is speechless as she takes this in. Suddenly, Sean 
      jumps up and cuts off a GUY HEADED TO THE TRASH.  Sean takes 
    a drink out of his hand.   

                                  SEAN (CONT D)
                    May I have this if you re just 
                    going to throw it away?

    The guy hands it over as Cathy quietly passes them and exits.

      INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT (N-1)

      Cathy stares at Paul as the WAITRESS writes on her pad.                                                                                    13


                                  WAITRESS
                    Great.  I ll be right back with 
                    those drinks.

    She exits.  Paul looks through the menu.

                                  PAUL
                    I m craving pasta but I also love 
                    their chicken so if you were going 
                    to get pasta, maybe I ll get the 
                    chicken so we can share--

      Paul looks up to see Cathy staring at him.

                                  PAUL (CONT D)
                    What?  I know you wanted to tell me 
                    something but I thought we d order 
                      first--unlessyou want to tell me 
                    now.

                                  CATHY
                    I wanted a new couch because you 
                    spilled fruit punch while you were 
                    bouncing on the cushions.

                                  PAUL
                    Not bouncing.  Dancing.  Do you 
                    want me to just order for both of 
                    us?  

                                  CATHY
                    What forty year old man dances on a 
                    couch sober?

                                  PAUL
                    I can t be the only one.

                                  CATHY
                    And now I have to reverse the 
                    cushions to hide the stain and I 
                    used to lie awake at night upset 
                    about that because even though you 
                    couldn t see the stains I knew they 
                    were there.

                                  PAUL
                    I told you to go ahead and pick out 
                    a new couch.

                                  CATHY
                    I don t want to be the one who 
                    picks out the new couch.  I want to 
                    be the one who spills the Fruit 
                    Punch.                                                                                    14


                                  PAUL
                    You re not the Fruit Punch type.

                                  CATHY
                    Because I read that high fructose 
                    corn syrup is so bad for you.  
                    (then) Do you think I m boring? 

                                  PAUL
                          (hesitant)
                    Just tell me how to get back in the 
                    house.  

                                  CATHY
                    You do.  You think I m boring.

                                  PAUL
                    It s not a bad thing.  It s just 
                    the way our personalities break 
                    down.  I like to do fun things and 
                    you like to do things that some, 
                    let s say a majority people might, 
                    if they were forced to categorize 
                    them, might consider boring.

                                  CATHY
                    Like what?

                                  PAUL
                    Like clean and organize. 

                                  CATHY
                    That s what I like to do?

                                  PAUL
                    You live for it.

                                  CATHY
                          (getting angry)
                    I tried to be the fun one.  I 
                    wanted to buy the house with the 
                    pool so I could teach Adam the 
                    Banana Split and Dive but you 
                    wanted to be closer to your job so 
                    you could Vespa to work.

                                  PAUL
                    You said that was probably a better 
                    idea because so many people die in 
                    pools.                                                                                    15


                                  CATHY
                    People die everywhere.  I said it 
                    was a better idea because you threw 
                    a tantrum in front of our realtor.  

                                  PAUL
                    I made my point in an emotional 
                    way, sure.

                                  CATHY
                    You made your point in a childish 
                    way.  

                                  PAUL
                          (getting annoyed)
                    Well, it s hard not to act like a 
                    kid when every time we leave the 
                    house you ask me if I need to pee.  

                                  CATHY
                    Well it s hard not to treat you 
                    like a child when every time I make 
                    you a sandwich you ask me to cut 
                    the crusts off your bread.

                                  PAUL
                    Oh sue me.  I love a crustless
                    sandwich.

                                  CATHY
                    Well, I love onions but I haven t 
                    been able to eat them for five 
                    years because you say they re 
                    stinky poopoo.And now Adam 
                    doesn t like onions and he s never 
                    even tried them.

                                  PAUL
                    They are stinky poopoo.Stinky 
                    poopooyuck yuck!(laughing; 
                    then)  Come on, Cathy, am I really 
                    sleeping at my sister s because you 
                    want to start cooking with onions?

                                  CATHY
                    Yes, Paul. That s it.  I want 
                    onions to be a major part of my 
                    life in the next year.   

                                  PAUL
                    Well, first of all, you re whacked 
                    and second of all, I hope you feel 
                    better because I feel like shit.                                                                                    16


    The Waitress returns with drinks.

                                  WAITRESS
                    Are you ready to order?

                                  CATHY
                    I m just doing desserts.

      EXT. CATHY S HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT (N-1)

      Cathy puts her key in the front door.

      INT. CATHY S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

    She enters the dark house and turns on a light.  As she does,  
      someone, out of nowhere, screams and jumps on top of her.

                                  MUFFLED MALE VOICE
                    Your money or your life!

      Cathy yells and flails and runs into the corner of the room.

                                  CATHY
                    Don t kill me don t kill me don t 
                    kill me!  Jewelry s in the bedroom!  
                    I have a child!

      Laughter.

                                  MALE VOICE
                    Hey, Mom.  Did you miss me?

      ADAM, CATHY AND PAUL S THIRTEEN YEAR OLD SON (GOING ON EIGHT)
      turns on another light.

                                  CATHY
                    Adam!   I told you!  Stop doing 
                    that!  Stop it stop it stop it!  
                    That s not funny!

                                  ADAM
                    It was kind of funny from this 
                    side.  Awman, I should have taped 
                    it.  I could send it in and win 
                    something.  Aw, man.

                                  CATHY
                    Why are you home?  

                                  ADAM
                    Brent s parents just drove really 
                    fast.  Some vacation.  They fought 
                    the whole time.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    17

                                  ADAM (CONT'D)
                    Brent thinks they re going to get a 
                    divorce.  He s all, fine, twice the 
                    stuff.

                                  CATHY
                    Why didn t you call and tell me you 
                    were coming?

                                  ADAM
                    I didn t think of it.  We taped a 
                    bunch of their fights.  Brent s 
                    going to make a documentary about 
                    his life.

      Cathy shakes her head in bewilderment.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    Where s Dad?

                                  CATHY
                    Um...he s staying at Aunt Lisa s.

                                  ADAM
                    Why?  

                                  CATHY
                    We re just--sometimesadults just 
                    need a little breathing space. 

                                  ADAM
                    Jesus, what did you do?  

                                  CATHY
                    What does that mean?  And don t say 
                    Jesus. 

                                  ADAM
                    Jesus.  Are you getting a divorce, 
                    too?  

                                  CATHY
                    Honey, it s going to be fine.  
                    We re building a deck on the house 
                    with a hot tub so you and your 
                    friends--

                                  ADAM
                    I don t like hot tubs.

                                  CATHY
                    You don t?                                                                                    18


                                  ADAM
                    You said they re like sitting in a 
                      petriedish, everybody s germs 
                    crawling up in your butthole. 

                                  CATHY
                    I m pretty sure I didn t say 
                    butthole.(then)  But speaking of 
                    butthole, what s that smell?

    She tracks the smell over to his duffel bag.  

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    What s in there?

                                  ADAM
                    I don t now.  My clothes.

                                  CATHY
                    You were gone a month, they didn t 
                    have a place for you to do laundry?  

                                  ADAM
                    They said something about it.  But 
                    I didn t see anything.  

                                  CATHY
                    You re tired.  Go to bed.

                                  ADAM
                    Geez.

    He goes to his room.  Cathy opens his duffel bag and gags.

      EXT. BACK YARD - THE NEXT MORNING (D-2)

      Construction workers are building the deck.  Cathy approaches 
      Bradley who is talking on his cell phone.

                                  CATHY
                    I want a pool.  Not a hot tub--a
                    pool. 

                                  BRADLEY
                          (into phone)
                    Let me call you back, Brian.  

    He hangs up the phone.

                                  BRADLEY (CONT D)
                    (to Cathy)  What do you want?                                                                                    19


                                  CATHY
                    I want you to dig a hole as deep 
                    and wide as you possibly can.  
                    Everywhere there s yard now there 
                    should be pool.  Dig up the shade 
                    tree.  Rip off the deck.  And dig 
                    right up to the house so I can dive 
                    into my pool from the porch.  I ll 
                    pay you overtime to work through 
                    the night.  If you don t want the 
                    job, I ll find somebody else to do 
                    it.  No skin off my nose.  I have 
                    no loyalty to you.  We just met.

      Bradley chuckles at this.

                                  BRADLEY
                    Hey, lady, if that s what you want.  
                    I ll get a digger out here this 
                    afternoon.

                                  CATHY
                    Great.  Get your digger out here.  
                    The bigger your digger the better.  

    She heads back to her house.  

      EXT. DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS (D-2)

    As she does, she notices the old woman across the street 
      sitting on her porch.  The Basset is asleep in the yard.

                                  CATHY
                    I m Cathy.  It s weird that I ve 
                    lived across the street from you 
                    for over a year and I never got 
                    your name.  I apologize for that.  
                    (re: dog)  You know, there s a dog 
                    park pretty close to here.  I don t 
                    know if your dog likes other dogs 
                    or not.  Or parks.  But I could get 
                    my son to--

    The old woman gets up and goes inside. 

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    (sotto; to herself)  Well, guess 
                    who is not going to swim in my 
                    pool.                                                                                    20

      Cathy sits at her desk eating a POT BROWNIE.She s shops 
      online at her computer looking at CAMPING EQUIPMENT, TENTS, 
      SLEEPING BAGS, ETC. The high school students sit at their 
      desks staring at her, confused.  

                                  STUDENT
                    Are you going to teach us anything 
                    today?

      Beat.  Cathy looks up at them.  

                                  CATHY
                    Have I ever taught you anything?  
                    Really?  This is summer school so I 
                    guess the answer is obvious. 

    She gets a DVD out of a file cabinet and holds it up.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    Anybody ever seen The Patriot?

                                  STUDENT 2
                    I think I saw that.  Oh, wait, no.

    She puts the DVD into the player.

                                  CATHY
                    It s depiction of the American 
                    Revolution is about twenty per cent 
                    accurate at best but if you 
                    understood this version as truth 
                    you d still know more about that 
                    time in history than ninety nine 
                    per cent of Americans.  And Mel 
                    Gibson is medium good.  Enjoy.

    She presses play as the door opens and her OVERWEIGHT STUDENT 
      ANDREA ENTERS.Andrea has a tough, don t mess with me 
      attitude about her and the size to back to up.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    You re late again, Andrea.

                                  ANDREA
                    Yeah, sorry about that.  But I 
                    figured that since you usually 
                    spend the first ten minutes of 
                    every class trying to get to your 
                    point, I probably didn t miss 
                    anything.                                                                                    21


      Andrea launches into a dead on impression of Cathy saying a 
      series of  I m sorry  that has the class in stitches. 

                                  CATHY
                    Funny.  Come get your test.

      While the class fixates on Mel Gibson, Andrea meets Cathy at 
    her desk.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                          (Soto)
                    You can t be fat AND mean, Andrea.

                                  ANDREA
                          (taken aback)
                    What?

                                  CATHY
                    You heard me.  If you can dish it 
                    out you gotta be ready to lick it 
                    up.  Fat people are jolly for a 
                    reason.  Fat repels people but joy 
                    attracts them.  Get it?  I know 
                    these people are laughing at your 
                    cruel jokes but nobody s asking you 
                    to prom.  So you can either be fat 
                    and joyous or a skinny bitch.  It s 
                    up to you.  I know what I d choose.    

      Andrea just stares at her in shocked silence.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    Sit down.  We re watching a movie.

      Andrea sits.  Cathy goes back to her online shopping.  She 
      pulls up a picture of a sleeping bag.  She reaches for a pen 
      when something outside catches her eye.  She looks out the 
      window and has to turn her head to see PAUL standing up 
      against the side of the school, staring at her with puppy dog 
      eyes that are pouring with tears as he eats a GIANT RED ONION 
      like an apple.  Cathy breaks into a smile and immediately 
      exits her class.

      INT. SCHOOL/HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

      Cathy heads down the empty hallway toward the exit.

                                  PAUL
                    Wanna bite?  

    She turns to see Paul, still eating the onion, standing in an 
      empty classroom.                                                                                      22


                                  CATHY
                    You re a freak.

                                  PAUL
                    Uh huh.

    He takes a bite.

                                  CATHY
                    Stop that!  I get it.

    She takes the onion away and he pulls her to him.

      INT. CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                  PAUL
                    Please kiss my big onion mouth.

                                  CATHY
                    Oooh, no.

                                  PAUL
                    See, they re stinky, aren t they?  
                    Admit it.

      They kiss.

                                  CATHY
                          (through kisses; laughing)
                    They are.  They re stinky poopoo
                    yuck yuck.

                                  PAUL
                          (spitting out onion)
                    It s going to be all about you now 
                    Cathy.  For as long as it takes, 
                    forever, it s all about you.

    He shuts the door and locks it and kisses her neck.

                                  CATHY
                    I m at school.

                                  PAUL
                    Good.  I m going to teach you 
                    something.  How to have fun. 

    He sits her on the teacher s desk and kisses down her body as 
    we FADE OUT.

      EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - LATER (D-2)

      Sean is chained to a WATER DELIVERY TRUCK parked on this 
      residential street.                                                                                      23


                                  SEAN
                    Poison delivery!  Poison delivery!  
                    Sign up for your poison delivery!

    A couple walks by and eyes him suspiciously. 

      EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - CONTINUOUS (D-2)

      Cathy drives up beside Sean and lowers her window.  

                                  CATHY
                    I have something for you.

                                  SEAN
                    I want for nothing.  The air is my 
                    food, the sun is my roof.

    She pushes a sleeping bag through the window.  It lands at 
    his feet.

                                  CATHY
                    I get it.  You don t want to take 
                    up any space or resources on the 
                    planet.  But I figured you could 
                    still get a good nights sleep. A 
                    hundred per cent organic.  I know 
                    you re impressed. 

    He points to the tags with his foot.

                                  SEAN
                    What s that?

                                  CATHY
                    Oh, it s just the tags.  Tells you 
                    about it s features and how to 
                    clean it.  

                                  SEAN
                    Oh, my God, you bought it new?  

      Beat. Cathy blanches.

                                  SEAN (CONT D)
                    We are being suffocated by stuff in 
                    this country.  So much so that 
                    there s a bill in Congress right 
                    now to send rockets full of our 
                    crap into space--ha!Space--ironic, 
                    isn t it. 

                                  CATHY
                    I thought--                                                                                    24


                                  SEAN
                    You just don t get it.

    The TRUCK DRIVERcomes out and approaches Sean.

                                  TRUCK DRIVER
                    You gotta get off my truck, man.  I 
                    gotta move.

                                  SEAN
                    I thought I d go with you on your 
                    poison delivery today.  Go ahead if 
                    you must.  I ll run along behind. 
                    (shouting)  Poison delivery!

      Cathy shakes her head and drives away.

      EXT. CATHY S BACK YARD   EVENING (N-2)

    A bull dozer digs a hole in the back yard, tearing up the 
      landscaping.

      INT. CATHY S HOUSE  - KITCHEN (N-2)

      Freshly showered, hair still wet and in a robe, Cathy is in 
    the kitchen cutting up vegetables when Adam enters.  

                                  ADAM
                    I m starving my face off.

                                  CATHY
                    Help me cut.  I m making chili.  
                    Your favorite.   

                                  ADAM
                    Chili s not my favorite anymore.  
                    We had sushi on vacation.  It was 
                    awesome.  

    She hands him a knife and some carrots.  He wields the knife 
      around in a figure eight.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                          (weird voice)
                    I am a warrior.  This is my weapon.    
                    I will teach you many things.

                                  CATHY
                    Dad s coming over for dinner.    

                                  ADAM
                    Ew.Are you guys dating now?                                                                                      25


                                  CATHY
                    Adam, everything s going to be 
                    okay.  We all love each other and 
                    that s what matters.

      Suddenly Adam screams and grabs his hand.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    What s wrong?

                                  ADAM
                    I cut my damn finger off!  Oh my 
                    Jesus!  I cut it off!  

      Cathy looks at the cutting board and sees the SLIGHTLY BLOODY 
      FINGER TIP.  She flies into action, handing Adam a tea towel 
    and grabbing ice from the freezer.

                                  CATHY
                    Hold your finger tight with this.  
                    Get in the car.  I ll put the tip 
                    on ice and they can sew it at the 
                    hospital!  Go go go!

    She puts the finger in a baggy with ice and heads out the 
      door.  Beat.  She re-enters and stares at Adam who is 
      laughing his head off and holds up his finger--intact.She 
      looks at the rubber finger in the baggy, then throws the 
      whole thing at him.  

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    That wasn t funny.

                                  ADAM
                    Let s take a vote.

                                  CATHY
                    We re going to discuss your 
                    punishment with your dad at dinner 
                    tonight.

                                  ADAM
                    I don t want to be a third wheel on 
                    your stupid date.  

      Cathy walks into the bathroom, then comes right back out.

                                  CATHY
                    Did you not flush the toilet?

                                  ADAM
                    It won t flush.                                                                                    26


                                  CATHY
                    Did you try to plunge it?

                                  ADAM
                    No.

                                  CATHY
                    Well, plunge it.

                                  ADAM
                    You plunge it.  I m going to eat at 
                    Brent s.  

    He exits.  Cathy stares after him.  Suddenly she hears 
      sirens.


      EXT. CATHY S BACK YARD -- MOMENTS LATER (N-2)

      A COP CARwith lights spinning sits in the driveway.  The 
      workers have stopped working.  Cathy comes hurriedly into the 
      backyard and approaches a police officer.

                                  CATHY
                    What s the problem?

                                  POLICE OFFICER
                    This your house?

                                  CATHY
                          (sarcastic)
                    No, I live in the next town over, I 
                    just take walks around here in my 
                    robe.

                                  POLICE OFFICER
                    Well, tie your belt  cause your 
                    boob s hanging out.

      He s right.  She wraps her robe tighter and ties her belt.

                                  POLICE OFFICER (CONT D)
                    You don t have permits for this 
                    job.

                                  CATHY
                    So?  I m not bothering anybody. 

                                  POLICE OFFICER
                    One of your neighbors complained.

                                  CATHY
                    Which one?                                                                                    27


      EXT. THE OLD WOMAN S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER (N-2)

      Cathy rushes up to the front door, and without knocking, 
      walks right in.

      INT. THE OLD WOMAN S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - (N-2)

    She sees the old woman sitting in front of the TV. As Cathy 
      crosses the threshold into the living room, she trips on the 
      basset hound lying there.

                                  CATHY
                          (to dog)
                    Oh, God!  Are you okay?

                                  OLD WOMAN
                    You can t just walk into my house.

                                  CATHY
                    You have no idea what I can do.

                                  OLD WOMAN
                    You re a pain in the ass.

                                  CATHY
                    You re a fucking cunt. 

                                  OLD WOMAN
                    Get out.

                                  CATHY
                    You have never said hello to me, 
                    you have never even smiled even a 
                    little bit.  You sit out there 
                    scowling at everybody who goes by 
                    in your run down house that looks 
                    like shit and smells like chicken 
                    that you fried twenty three years 
                    ago.  And then I do one small 
                    construction project, and you have 
                    to go behind my back...(getting 
                    suddenly emotional) And I really 
                    wanted to teach my son the Banana 
                    Split and Dive and I have very 
                    little time left...because summer 
                    in Minneapolis isn t very long.  
                    It s here and then it s over.  It s 
                    just over.  And that makes me so 
                    fucking mad I can t even tell you!  

      Beat.  She turns to go and trips over the dog again.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    Oh God!  I am sooosorry!                                                                                    28


                                  OLD WOMAN
                    My husband built this house. 

      This gets Cathy s attention and she turns back.

                                  OLD WOMAN (CONT D)
                    And he just loved puttering around, 
                    putting a new coat of paint on this 
                    or that and working in the yard.  I 
                    accused him of loving that lawn 
                    more than me once. 

                                  CATHY
                    Let me guess--

                                  OLD WOMAN
                    --he died five years ago.  And all 
                    my friends are dead.  So I just sit 
                    out there and wait until I can see 
                    them again.  Sorry I m not in a 
                    better mood.  

      Beat.

                                  CATHY
                    Well, if you think you re going to 
                    be waiting at least another day 
                    then do your neighbors a favor and 
                    mow your fucking grass.

      Cathy exits.

      EXT. CATHY S HOUSE - A MOMENT LATER (N-2)

    As she heads back to her house, Paul is pulling up on his 
      Vespa.  She inadvertently cuts him off.  He swerves to miss 
    her and topples over.  

                                  PAUL
                    Sorry I m late. 

    He picks himself up and pulls up his pant leg to reveal a 
      scraped knee..

                    I could sure use a band aid and a 
                    lollipop.

    Off Cathy s blank stare we CUT TO:

      INT. CATHY S HOUSE - LATER (N-2)

      Cathy gets the first aid kit and tends to Paul s knee.                                                                                     29


                                  PAUL
                    Do you remember Angel from work?

                                  CATHY
                    Yep.

                                  PAUL
                    He got engaged to that girl who we 
                    met at that party and she made that 
                    snotty face when you talked to her 
                    that made you feel like you had bad 
                    breath.  I took him out for a drink 
                    to celebrate but then the game was 
                    on and it was really close so I 
                    stayed til the end. (re: knee)  On 
                    behalf of all the soldiers, thank 
                    you so much Mrs. Nightingale.  
                    Where s Adam?

                                  CATHY
                    Doing his charity work.

                                  PAUL
                    That s nice.

      SFX. The PHONE RINGS.  Cathy puts the first aid kit away and 
      let s the machine get it.  

                                  PAUL (CONT D)
                    What charity is it again?  

                                  DR. TODD (V.O.)
                    Hi Cathy, it s Dr...Smilovic.Dr. 
                    ...Todd.  It s Todd.  This isn t 
                    business it s, just personal.  
                    Anyway, I was thinking 
                      about...you...  I can t seem to 
                    stop thinking about you actually.  
                    If I m being honest.  I know you go 
                    either way on honesty (he 
                    chuckles)... Anyway, I want to make 
                    sure you have my cell number--

                                  PAUL
                            (suspicious)
                    Who s that?

                                  CATHY
                    I ve been meaning to talk to you 
                    about something--

                                  PAUL
                    Are you fucking kidding me?  So 
                    this is why you need your space?  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    30

                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                    But what, you want to see if it 
                    works out before you let me go 
                      completely?  What, a computer geek
                    with a heart of gold doesn t do it 
                    for you anymore?  What kind of fun 
                    were you really looking for, Cathy?  
                    Trips to the Riviera?  Well, am I 
                    right?  (beat; emotional)  Are you 
                    having an affair?   

    She doesn t respond.

                                  PAUL (CONT D)
                    I need to be alone for a while.

    He grabs his jacket and exits.  She stares after him for a 
      moment, then turns to the phone and plays Dr. Todd s message 
      again. 

      EXT. OUTDOOR CAF   THE NEXT MORNING (D-3)

      Cathy has three pieces of cake in front of her.   Dr. Todd 
      picks at an omelet.  

                                  DR. TODD
                    So who have you told so far?

                                  CATHY
                    You re like a dog with a bone about 
                    that.  

                                  DR. TODD
                    Eventually you ll have to tell 
                    them.

                                  CATHY
                    Maybe not.  Maybe I ll just leave a 
                    Post It on my front door that says--
                    heardMorocco was great this time 
                    of year.  

                                  DR. TODD
                    Morocco s so random.

                                  CATHY
                    Maybe you should tell them for me.  
                    After all, you have more practice  
                    with giving this sort of news.  
                    Does it get easier?  Do you kind of 
                    like it?  Does it give you a bit of 
                    a God complex?

                                  DR. TODD
                    You re my first.                                                                                    31


      Beat.

                                  CATHY
                    Really?

                                  DR. TODD
                    I mean...I ve been in on other 
                    diagnoses, with other doctors when 
                    I was in training--  

                                  CATHY
                    How old are you?

                                  DR. TODD
                      Thirty-one.

                                  CATHY
                          (teasing)
                    Holy Shit. (sarcastic)  Shows you 
                    how good my insurance is.  I got 
                    the new guy.  What if I m healthy 
                    as a horse and you just got caught 
                    up in youthful exuberance?

                                  DR. TODD
                    That s what second opinions are 
                    for.

                                  CATHY
                    So, as your first, how was I?

                                  DR. TODD
                    The first thing you said was,  It s 
                    okay.   Like you were more worried 
                    about me.

                                  CATHY
                    That s a bad habit of mine.  It 
                    takes twenty eight days to break a 
                    habit, right?  I have that.

                                  DR. TODD
                    So how was I?

                                  CATHY
                          (thinking)
                    Very matter of fact and 
                    professional but detailed.  You 
                    dumbed it down just enough to be 
                    clear but not insulting.  And 
                    underneath it all you seemed sad, 
                    and I appreciated that.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    32

                                  CATHY (CONT'D)
                    But after you left the room I heard 
                    you joking with a nurse about 
                    putting the donuts too close to the 
                    urine samples and was that what you 
                    were supposed to wash them down 
                    with.

                                  DR. TODD
                          (horrified)
                    You heard that?

                                  CATHY
                    Made me question your sincerity.  

                                  DR. TODD
                    Well, I can t just fall apart in 
                    the hallway at work.  

                                  CATHY
                    Couldn t you though?  I would have 
                      appreciated a little screaming to 
                    the heavens on my behalf.  

                                  DR. TODD
                    They discourage that in medschool.

                                  CATHY
                    You asked my opinion.

                                  DR. TODD
                    I did.  And...thin walls.  I ll 
                    remember that.

                                  CATHY
                    You ll remember more than that.  

                                  DR. TODD
                    I will?

                                  CATHY
                    Of course.  Because you always 
                    remember your first.

      They share a smile.  The WAITER approaches.

                                  WAITER
                    How are you all doing?

                                  CATHY
                    I don t know about him but I m 
                    almost finished.

    The WAITER nods and exits.  Cathy winks at Dr. Todd.                                                                                    33


                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    That was a double entendre. 

      INT. SCHOOL/CLASSROOM - LATER (D-3)

      Cathy presses play on another Mel Gibson movie.  

                                  STUDENT
                    Wow.  This went from being my least 
                    favorite class to my most favorite.

                                  CATHY
                    Oh, good.  Another dream came true 
                    for me this week.

      Cathy takes something out of her desk drawer and leaves the 
      classroom.

      EXT. SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER (D-3)

      Cathy steps outside, leans up against the wall of this 
      secluded area of the school and starts to light one of her 
    pot cigarettes.  As she does, she sees Andrea come out of 
      another door and take something out of her purse.

                                  CATHY
                    Andrea?

      Andrea turns, startled, and hides something behind her back.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    Are you skipping my class?

                                  ANDREA
                    Are youskipping your class?

      Cathy approaches her.

                                  CATHY
                    What are you-- Are you smoking? 

                                  ANDREA
                    Are you?

      Cathy grabs her arm and wrestles a cigarette pack from 
      Andrea s hand and crushes it. 

                                  CATHY
                          (re: cigarettes)
                    Think of every one of these you 
                    smoke as taking six months off your 
                    life.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    34

                                  CATHY (CONT'D)
                    So with every one of these you can 
                    say goodbye to your mom, your 
                    brother, your dog, your husband you 
                    might have someday, your--

                                  ANDREA
                    I d rather die young and skinny 
                    than be fat forever.

      This stops Cathy s rant.

                                  ANDREA (CONT D)
                    What can I say?  Fat camp didn t 
                    work.  

                                  CATHY
                    Yeah, well, there s gotta be--

                                  ANDREA
                    The protein diet, the blood sugar 
                    diet, the starvation diet, the 
                    pretending I don t care strategy.  
                    You d be mean, too.  

                                  CATHY
                            (stammering)
                    Well...you just...you need 
                      motivation.

                                  ANDREA
                    Oh, thanks.  I m healed.  I should 
                    have come to you sooner Mrs. 
                    Jamison.

      Beat.

                                  CATHY
                    I ll pay you a hundred dollars for 
                    every pound you lose.

      Andrea is stunned.  Cathy takes a roll of bills out of her 
      pocket.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    Here s a good faith hundred.  We 
                    meet in the gym every Friday at two 
                    for weigh ins.  If you smell like a 
                    cigarette the deal s off.

                                  ANDREA
                          (elated)
                    This skinny bitch llsee you 
                    Friday.                                                                                    35


    She exits.  Cathy uncrumplesthe pack and lights a broken 
      cigarette.


      EXT. CATHY S DRIVEWAY   AFTERNOON (D-3)

    As Cathy gets out of her car, she sees Marlene waiting for 
      her.

                                  OLD WOMAN
                    My name s Marlene.  My dog s name 
                    is Thomas.  He doesn t like 
                    walking, but thanks for your offer.

                                  CATHY
                    It s nice to meet you, Marlene.  

                                  MARLENE
                    Could I borrow your lawn mower?  
                    Mine s dead.  Add it to the list.

                                  CATHY
                    Sure.  It s in the garage.

      Cathy motions to the garage and Marlene heads in.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    Marlene.

      Marlene turns.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    If you were ready to go, did you 
                    ever think about--justgoing?

                                  MARLENE
                    Why?  Does a friend of yours want 
                    to buy my house?

      Cathy shakes her head.  Marlene goes into the garage.  Cathy 
      looks at THOMAS lying in Marlene s yard.

                                  CATHY
                    (to Basset)  Don t look so 
                    miserable.  Nobody else s day is 
                    any better than yours.

      INT. CATHY S HOUSE - LATER (D-3)

      Through a series of DISSOLVES we see Cathy at home.

      *She smokes a pot cigarette and watches a funny movie.                                                                                    36


      *She puts a stack of hundred dollar bills into an envelope 
    and labels it  Andrea .

      *She writes something on a Post It and sticks it to the front 
      door.  

      INT. CAR - NIGHT

      Paul pulls up to Cathy s house with Adam.  Adam is in the 
      passenger seat playing a video game on an iphone.

                                  PAUL
                    It doesn t matter if I m at work, 
                    any time of day, call me whenever 
                    you want to.  Call me when we re 
                    together if you want to.  Call me 
                    right now. 

      Adam ignores him and continues to play the game.

                                  PAUL (CONT D)
                    It s a phone, too, you know.

                                  ADAM
                    I know.

      Adam gets out of the car and heads to the house.

                                  PAUL
                    I love you, buddy.

      Adam ignores him and heads to the house.  

      EXT. CATHY S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

      Adam looks at the Post It that reads--ILOVE YOU.  He pulls 
    it off and enters.

      INT. CATHY S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

    The house is mostly dark.

                                  ADAM
                    Mom!  (beat)  Mom!

    He glances in the kitchen.  Not there.  He sees the light on 
    in the bathroom and the door half open.  He opens the door 
      completely and looks in.

      INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

    In the brightly lit bathroom, Cathy is lying in the bathtub, 
      filled with water bright red with blood.                                                                                      37


    One arm hangs over the tub revealing a slit wrist and the 
      blood from that wound drips onto the floor.  

                                  ADAM
                          (in shock; Sotto)
                    Mom?  Mom?

      Adam goes ballistic.  He starts screaming like a lady and 
      running in panicked circles.  He looks for the phone, but 
      it s not on it s base.  He starts to run out the front door 
      when Cathy, in a robe, appears at the bathroom door.

                                  CATHY
                    Why aren t you laughing?

      This stops Adam.  Then he instantly goes ballistic again.

                                  ADAM
                    No!  No!  No way!  You suck!  You 
                    suck!  You suck!

    She grabs him and pushes him against the wall.

                                  CATHY
                    Someday I am going to be dead and 
                    as a courtesy to the world, I don t 
                    want to leave them the guy who 
                    doesn t know how to get his shitto 
                    flush.  And let me be clear, your 
                    dad isn t living here because I 
                    only wanted to raise one kid, and I 
                    chose you.  So from now on, I m 
                    going to raise you so hard your 
                    head s going to spin.  Now come 
                    here.

    She pulls him into the bathroom where she has a crock pot of 
    the leftover chili sitting in the sink.  She dumps its 
      contents into the toilet.  

                                  ADAM
                    What are you doing?  

                                  CATHY
                    Sorry it s not sushi.

    She hands him the plunger.  

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    The instructions are in the name.  
                      (enunciating) PLUNGE-HER.

    She exits the bathroom and holds the door shut.                                                                                    38


                                  ADAM (O.S.)
                    Let me out!

    She pulls a heavy trunk in front of the door.  She then 
      notices Adam s iphone.  

                                  CATHY
                    Where did you get this phone?

                                  ADAM (O.S.)
                    Dad bought it for me.

                                  CATHY
                    Yeah, I don t think so.

    She takes the phone with her and exits.

      EXT. GROCERY STORE - DUSK - (N-4)

      Sean is standing silently in front of the store, holding a 
      rope made crudely from plastic bags around his neck like a 
      noose.  Cathy pulls up and lowers her window.  

                                  CATHY
                    I brought you some chili.

                                  SEAN
                    I want for nothing.

                                  CATHY
                    It s leftovers.  I was going to 
                    throw it away. 

      Sean lets the noose dangle around his neck and takes the bowl 
    and spoon from her.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    It has onions in it.

                                  SEAN
                    Yum.

      Cathy leans on the open window and watches him eat.

                                  SEAN (CONT D)
                    Take a picture it lasts longer.

    She takes theIPHONEout of her purse and takes his picture.

                                  SEAN (CONT D)
                    Are you wearing a robe?

    She stares at the picture she just took.                                                                                    39


                                  CATHY
                    I ve never noticed what a handsome 
                    guy you are.  No wonder my friend 
                    Holly had such a crush on you in 
                    high school.  She d come over to 
                    hang out and I d catch her in your 
                    room staring at your clothes.

                                  SEAN
                    You never told me that.

                                  CATHY
                    It grossed me out to think of you 
                    with my best friend so I told her 
                    you were gay.

                                  SEAN
                    Oh well.  I guess she thinks she 
                    lost her virginity to a gay guy 
                    then.

                                  CATHY
                    No way!

                                  SEAN
                    Way!

      Cathy starts to leave.

                                  CATHY
                    Oh, I m burning my couch in the 
                    back yard on Friday if you want to 
                    come over for a bonfire.

      Beat.  Sean smiles.

                                  SEAN
                    You re starting to get your weird 
                    back, Sis.

                                  CATHY
                    You have no idea.

    She smiles back and drives away.  She turns up the radio and 
      sings loudly to DELTA DAWN as we FADE OUT.  

      EXT. CATHY S BACK YARD   NIGHT (D-5)

      Cathy sits on a couch, emotional, sharing her secret.

                                  CATHY
                    ...and they could do chemobut I 
                    have the rare kind that comes back 
                    a hundred per cent of the time.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    40

                                  CATHY (CONT'D)
                    Which is weird, because I never win 
                    anything. So I d just be buying a 
                    little more time and it would mean 
                    a lot of people...taking care of 
                    me.  And that s not my thing.   
                    Plus, you know, quality of life.  I 
                    had a sinus infection once and 
                      thought--I drather be dead.  
                    Seriously.  You know what makes me 
                    feel better though?  If I m being 
                    honest? It makes me feel better to 
                    think that we re all dying.  And 
                    when you have a kid, you expect 
                    that you ll die before they do even 
                    if you try not to think about it.  
                    I mean, you hope to God you will 
                    because the opposite is 
                      inconceivable.  So if I think about 
                    it that way--hey, I m living the 
                    dream! (shelaughs at herself)  
                    Come on, that s pretty funny.  
                    Gotta give it up for me a little 
                    bit.  Death comedy.  I m here all 
                    year.  Performing at Stage Four.  
                    I m just warning you that this 
                    laughter might turn into a sob in a 
                    minute.   (itdoes)  Yep, there it 
                    is.  As long as I m being raw and 
                    vulnerable here, I might as well 
                    tell you that I m feeling very much 
                    in love with you right now.  It 
                    could just be gratitude.  Who 
                    knows.  Who cares.  

      REVEALthat she s actually pouring out her heart to THOMAS
    who sits next her on the couch which sits in the pool hole.  
    He stares at her with compassionate Basset eyes.  

    As Cathy alternates between laughter and sobs WE PULL UP AND 
      AWAY and the woman and dog get smaller and smaller until they 
      disappear and all we can see is the hole and then nothing at 
    all and WE FADE OUT.

    THE END
