A BLACK AND WHITE image slowly becomes COLOR.
Great Neck,
1957.
An upper-class Jewish neighborhood.
In the street,
crewcut BOYS play t-ball, laughing and shouting.
A fat
convertible pulls up to the smallest house, and STANLEY
KAUFMAN, 40, gets out.
Still in his suit, he's a well-
meaning slave to his job -- tired, responsible.
Stanley goes over to admire the t-ball game.
At bat is his
son MICHAEL, 6, a natural charmer.
Michael swings -- crack!
-- and hits a solid single.
Stanley smiles.
STANLEY
That's my boy!
Good swingin',
kiddo.
(warm beat; then a
look)
Hey -- Michael... where's your
brother?
MICHAEL
He's inside.
Instantly -- Stanley's mood turns black.
He frowns angrily,
then snatches his briefcase and marches in.
Sobbing Andy bursts out the door.
He steps onto the
sidewalk -- and IMMEDIATELY STOPS CRYING.
Just like that.
Andy lifts his big case and starts walking.
Andy shakes his
head angrily.
He turns down a dark street, hurrying alone through an
unsavory New York neighborhood.
But then... TWO MEN
appear... silently approaching.
Andy stops uncertainly --
debating whether to turn around.
But in that second -- the
thugs are upon him, glaring menacingly.
THUG #1
Give us your wallet.
Andy stares fearfully.
An anxious moment.
He thinks...
considering his options.
Then, he suddenly stammers in a thick FOREIGN ACCENT.
ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
I -- doo not unterstand!!
THUG #1
Give us your money!
ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
What??
What mooney?
Abu daboo!
I
do not have mooney!
The thugs glance at each other.
ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)
Pleaze!
I just move to America
yezterday!
I do not know!
THUG #1
What's in the case?
ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
NO!
Eeet, eet is just perzonal
trifles from my homeland --
THUG #2
Shut up!
Gimme that thing!
The guy snatches the case.
He impulsively BREAKS the
lock... and clothes, congas and records fall out.
The thugs are dismayed.
THUG #1
Goddamn immigrants!
THUG #2
This guy's pathetic.
Let's go.
Harsh glances.
They angrily turn and leave.
Andy takes a nervous breath, then starts picking his things
off the street.
He shouts after the guys:
ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
Tank you veddy much...!
CUT TO:
The Improv, the biggest comedy club around.
People are
lined up, waiting.
The man strides up -- GEORGE SHAPIRO, a
Hollywood talent manager.
George is old school: Bronx
accent, shmooze and a hug... but with a surprising sweetness
that is quite disarming.
A DOORMAN sees him, grins, and
waves George in.
The sun is setting.
In an ugly shopping district, Andy
walks along with sexy, wholesome MIMI.
MIMI
... so after I finish junior
college, I'll go to work for my
dad's accounting firm.
Unless, I
decide to live with my friend
Valerie, but she wants to move to
Anaheim, and I don't want to do
that.
A disinterested beat.
ANDY
Oh.
Another beat.
ANDY (cont'd)
So do you wanna wrestle?
MIMI
Excuse me -- ?
ANDY
Do you wanna wrestle?
It's a good
way of breaking the ice.
(pause)
That instant physical intimacy
really brings two people together.
Mimi is bewildered, and offended.
MIMI
What are you talking about?!
We
just met an hour ago.
ANDY
(calm)
No no no, it's not sex!
I mean --
it can lead to sex... but really,
it's just wrestling.
MIMI
I don't wanna talk about it!
An awkward silence.
They continue walking.
She points up.
MIMI (cont'd)
The sunset is really beautiful.
ANDY
What do you mean?
MIMI
(a bit offput)
I mean -- uh -- the colors in the
sky are so vibrant.
I love this
time of day.
ANDY
(he shrugs dully)
I've never understood that.
It's
just... getting dark.
(pause)
But I like you!
Hey!
Why don't we
fill the car with gas, drive to
Tijuana, and GET MARRIED???
ANGLE - MIMI
Fear.
She shivers, then hoarsely speaks.
MIMI
I think I wanna go home.
CUT TO:
A marquee says "TEXAS A&M; PRESENTS - ANDY KAUFMAN"
Inside, a ROAR of APPLAUSE surges.
Andy and Zmuda walk out, Zmuda squinting groggily.
They
drag the suitcase containing the props.
They walk slowly
towards their rental car, the campus totally deserted.
ZMUDA
Nobody likes anarchy more than me...
but this is science fiction!
Andy nods uncomprehendingly.
ANDY
Let's get some breakfast.
CUT TO:
A tattered sign says "Welcome to the MUSTANG RANCH."
The
world-famous whorehouse sits behind a barb-wire fence.
Dusty connected trailers sit in the sand.
A CAR idles out front.
Zmuda and a scared Andy sit inside.
ANDY
I dunno about this...
(worried)
What will my mother think?
ZMUDA
She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
ANDY
It's so dirty.
ZMUDA
Nah.
The girls sponge off between
johns.
Andy nods.
ANDY
Okay.
George runs for his life.
He knocks aside a rack of
costumes and serpentines between people.
At the gate, Tony's being dragged, kicking and screaming.
TONY CLIFTON
Stop!
HELP!
You wouldn't do this
to Wayne Newton --
The guards toss Tony out the gate.
He lands in a heap.
In the b.g., George crazily flies by.
He gets out the exit.
George doubles over, trying to catch his breath.
He glances
down... and Tony is lying next to him.
Little Wendy and
Zmuda run up, out of breath.
They all look at each other.
There's a moment of
understanding.
TONY CLIFTON
Hey.
Good hustlin'.
George slowly smiles.
George is driving in his convertible.
Suddenly, something
catches his eye -- and in shock he HITS the brakes.
Three
cars behind him SCREECH crazily, trying not to hit each
other.
George is oblivious.
He's staring up at a BILLBOARD.
The BILLBOARD: It says "HARRAH'S TAHOE PRESENTS, ANDY
KAUFMAN & TONY CLIFTON!
TOGETHER ON STAGE!
ONE NIGHT
ONLY!"
George is flabbergasted.
George is shouting into a payphone.
GEORGE
Gene, you misunderstood!!
You're
not getting BOTH of them!
(upset)
It's physically impossible!
BOOKER (O.S.)
Why's that?
You said over and over
and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy
Kaufman --
GEORGE
Yeah, I KNOW what I said!
But --
trust me, it's not gonna happen!
BOOKER (O.S.)
Sure it is.
Tony called me himself.
He yelled at me, insisting that his
dressing room be bigger than Andy's.
They're both going on tonight,
believe me!
George is stupefied.
He looks at his watch.
CUT TO:
Magnificent HARRAH'S dominates the skyline.
The marquee
blares "TONY CLIFTON AND ANDY KAUFMAN!"
George screeches up
in a rental car.
He jumps out and runs inside.
ANDY is standing in front, waiting.
A CAB stops and out
steps -- Lynne.
ANDY
Hi...
LYNNE
Hi... am I late?
ANDY
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
Andy gives Lynne her ticket.
They enter the theater.
They leave the theater and walk down the sidewalk.
LYNNE
Why did you call me?
The last
person I ever expected to get a call
from was you.
ANDY
Gosh.
Gee, Lynne... I was just so
impressed with your wrestling moves.
ANDY is standing in front, waiting.
A CAB stops and out
steps -- Lynne.
ANDY
Hi...
LYNNE
Hi... am I late?
ANDY
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
Andy gives Lynne her ticket.
They enter the theater.
They leave the theater and walk down the sidewalk.
LYNNE
Why did you call me?
The last
person I ever expected to get a call
from was you.
ANDY
Gosh.
Gee, Lynne... I was just so
impressed with your wrestling moves.
LYNNE
You were impressed with something.
It's pretty odd when a man sports a
hard-on that large on national
television.
Andy is shocked.
ANDY
Oh!
Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.
LYNNE
I'm here, ain't I?
A charged moment.
Andy's eyes widen.
His speech gets
faster.
ANDY
Do you wanna to go to Memphis and
get married?
LYNNE
(incredulous)
Do I wanna go to Memphis and get
married?
ANDY
Yes.
Beat.
LYNNE
Why Memphis?
ANDY
(he SPEAKS VERY
FAST)
Because Memphis is the wrestling
capital of the world!
I'll go in
the ring, and I'll announce that I
will shave my head and marry any
woman who beats me!
Then you'll
come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let
you win!
Then you'll scalp me, and
we'll get married on Letterman, like
Tiny Tim did on Carson... right
there on the show!
What do you
say???
Whoa.
Lynne stares into his eyes.
LYNNE
And all this will be for real?
ANDY
(a soft smile)
If you want...
CUT TO:
We hear NOISE from the main event above.
Andy and Lynne
hurry along.
She is disgruntled.
He swaggers arrogantly,
still in his fighting outfit.
LYNNE
Is this an act -- or are you
addicted to causing trouble??
ANDY
(he jokingly
impersonates a
drunk)
I can shtop whenever I want...
She's unamused.
LYNNE
Then stop treating me like a fucking
prop.
ANDY
(he drops the act)
I-I'm sorry.
I got caught up in the
action...!
She shoots him a stern look.
LYNNE
I'm warning you, Kaufman:
One
morning you're gonna wake up... and
your head's gonna be shaved.
Andy laughs.
CUT TO:
A crowd of reporters parts.
They make way for Andy, who is
carried out on the stretcher and loaded into a waiting
AMBULANCE.
He is "unconscious."
Cameras CLICK and FLASH.
The ambulance speeds away, siren
WAILING.
George is eating with the Saturday Night Live Producer,
Lorne Michaels.
They're eating lunch in an outdoor cafe.
GEORGE
Thanks for seeing me on such short
notice.
(he takes a careful
beat)
I... I wanted to talk to you about
booking Andy on "Saturday Night
Live."
Lorne Michaels squirms uncomfortably.
He chooses his words.
LORNE MICHAELS
George -- I don't know if Andy works
for our show anymore.
That
wrestling stuff... is such a
turnoff.
GEORGE
We agree completely.
(tactfully begging)
Andy has to reconnect with his core
audience.
So I got him on Letterman
tonight.
He's gonna apologize to
Jerry Lawler, then repent for all
his bad guy shenanigans.
Lorne Michaels mulls this over.
LORNE MICHAELS
That's smart.
GEORGE
He's very sincere.
(quietly emphatic)
And he needs your show...
Beat.
Lorne Michaels nods.
LORNE MICHAELS
Okay.
It'd be good to have the old
Andy back.
CUT TO:
A moving van outside a funky 60's house.
MOVERS carry boxes
in.
George is driving down Melrose, listening to the radio.
He
glances at the passing marquee -- then does a doubletake.
It says "ANDY KAUFMAN - 9 P.M."
Andy and George walk sadly down the street.
There is a
horrible gloom over them.
ANDY
The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks.
So I was just giving 'em what they
want...
GEORGE
(sadly)
Andy, they don't think you suck.
They've just... lost a reason to
love you.
The guys stop walking.
George gently speaks.
GEORGE (cont'd)
You've gotta make the public embrace
you again.
You have to win back
their sympathy...
ON ANDY
He nods.
ANDY
I'll come up with something.
CUT TO:
George pulls up in his convertible.
He jumps out.
He walks to the door and starts to knock -- when suddenly it
creeps open.
It's Lynne, putting her finger to her lips:
Shh!
A dressy NEW YORK CROWD pushes into Carnegie Hall.
The
marquee says "ANDY KAUFMAN."
A thousand people file out -- and THIRTY-FIVE SCHOOLBUSES
are parked up and down Fifth Avenue!!!
The crowd is AWED.
Andy euphorically marches out, pushing his endurance.
He's
the Pied Piper.
ANDY
Single file!
Don't rush!
There's
enough cookies for everyone!!
The schoolbuses pull up to a school.
The disoriented
passengers step out, not sure what to expect...
A stucco SPA RESORT sits in the middle of the rocky desert.
Zmuda stands with a swarmy ADMINISTRATOR.
ADMINISTRATOR
Your friend is doing four crystal
sessions a day, but it's just not
helping.
ZMUDA
I know...
(beat)
The cancer's terminal.
ADMINISTRATOR
Yes.
That wasn't made particularly
clear to us when he checked in...
ZMUDA
(irked)
Look, personally, I think rubbing
rocks on people is a load of
horseshit.
But if it makes Andy
happy, that's all that matters.
The man purses his lips.
ADMINISTRATOR
I'm sorry to sound crass -- but we
don't want to be "that health resort
in New Mexico where Andy Kaufman
died."
(beat)
I'm going to have to ask you to
leave.
Zmuda is speechless.
The sun is setting, purple and orange over the hills.
Andy
and George lie on chaise lounges, serenely staring out.
Andy has a blank look on his face, and has lost more weight.
He is a shadow of himself.
ANDY
I can't move my arm.
GEORGE
(awkwardly)
You've got good days and bad days.
Andy softly sighs.
ANDY
My hair is coming out.
GEORGE
(whispers)
Yeah...
George silently pats Andy.
Andy's energy is sapped, but he
forces himself to be upbeat.
ANDY
I've got an idea for a new TV show
for me to star in.
It's called
"Uncle Andy's Fun House" -- it'll be
a Saturday morning thing where I can
goof off with the kids.
You know,
puppets, magic tricks...
George is choked up.
He goes along with it.
GEORGE
(long pause)
I think we can sell that.
Silence.
George struggles not to shatter Andy's enthusiasm.
Andy smiles gratefully.
ANDY
Hey... thanks for always backin' me.
George clenches Andy's hand.
GEORGE
Did your -- doctor say it's okay for
you to go back to work?
ANDY
Ehhh, you know those guys.
If he
had his way, I'd be stuck in the
hospital, running tests all day.
(beat)
And anyway, I've found a new guy
who's gonna be able to instantly
remove the cancer.
GEORGE
(startled)
Really?
ANDY
Yeah!
He's a psychic surgeon in the
Philippines, and he's amazing!
He
rubs you and sucks the disease right
out!
Andy beams.
George stares sadly.
GEORGE
The Philippines?
I dunno... Andy...
he sounds like one of your
characters.
TIGHT - ANDY
His voice gets hushed.
ANDY
No... this guy's special.
(very sincere)
He performs miracles.
George doesn't know how to respond.
Andy looks up pleadingly.
ANDY (cont'd)
He's my last chance.
CUT TO:
Baguio, a tiny scratched-in-the-dirt Philippine city.
Suddenly, a rattletrap COMMUTER PLANE lurches out of the
sky.
It hits a dirt runway.
Dust flies.
Chickens squawk
and run.
They reach a brick building.
A sign says "CLINIC," with an
eye over a triangle.
A SUPER slowly appears:
"EXACTLY ONE YEAR LATER"
On Sunset, TWO DUDES come riding along on skateboards.
Suddenly they reach -- INSANITY.
Traffic on Sunset is
jammed.
HONKING limousines jockey to squeeze by.
Confused, one Dude squints into the distance -- and his eyes
pop.
DUDE #2
Oh my GOD.
(stupefied)
That's the freakiest thing I've ever
seen!!
Look!
He points.
His friend turns -- and gasps.
AT THE COMEDY STORE - The marquee says "TONY CLIFTON: LIVE!"
DUDE #1
Man, we were right!
He's not dead!
DUDE #2
He's just been lyin' low for a year!
WE GOTTA GO!
Hysterical, the guys race up to the club.
But outside,
there's a CRAZED, PULSING MOB.
People are screaming.
Police have barricades.
Everybody cries to get in.
