                    Good thing music is his life.  So
                    there's one for you, Spence and Gwen.

                                    ZACK
                    Didn't you ask...what's her name?

                    Oh, she turned you down.

                    She was busy.  Anyway, so tomorrow
                    night we'll meet at the stage door

                    Why don't you just ask your Dad if
                    it's okay?

      OFF Zack considering the possibility --


      To establish.

                                    ZACK (O.S.)
                    You know, Dad...


      Zack drops from above into frame fully dressed for school.

                                    ZACK
                          (Keanu-esque)
                    Whoa.

      Zack's arrival startles his pal SPENCER SHARPE (13, intense).

                                      SPENCER
                    Zack.  Where'd you come from?

      In the background, the school custodian FLOYD HOGGMEISTER
      (large and scary) waters the lawn.

                                      FLOYD
                    You there!  No jumping out of the
                    sky onto my lawn.

                                    ZACK
                    Sorry, Floyd.

                                      SPENCER
                    Zack, your shoes are on the wrong
                    feet.

                                    ZACK
                    They are?

                    It's a wish?  And why did the fortune

                                    ZACK
                    It didn't.  It predicted that my
                    wishes would come true.  It's a
                    fortune cookie, Cam.

      They walk past FLOYD the custodian as he waters the lawn.

                                    ZACK
                    I think we could have a lot of fun
                    with this.

                                      SPENCER
                    No.  We should run some tests... 

                                    CAM
                    And we should use this to benefit

                    Can we keep focused?  Zack, wish for
                    something small.  Something easy.

                    You know I kinda feel like lobster.

                    So I have expensive tastes.

                    Okay.  I wish that snack truck had
                    lobster.

                    Hey, wait, I gotta nice tuna sandwich.

      The Snack Truck Guy reaches into his cooler and pulls out...a
      live, snapping lobster.

      OFF Spence staring at the lobster intensely --

                    I need the full Zack File kit.

                                    ZACK
                    Spence don't go hiring that camera

                    Why not Greenburg?  I hear that your
                    daddy won't let you out at night.

                                    ZACK
                    And I heard that your parents won't
                    let you back in.

                                      VERNON

      Spence and GWEN KILLERBY (13, dressed with rock show
        sophistication) wait with the electrics trucks at the Forum's
      Artists' Entrance. 

                                      SPENCER
                    They're in trouble.

                                    GWEN
                    They're only an hour late.  Bands
                    are always late.  It's part of their
                    mystique.

                                      SPENCER
                    No, Cam and Zack.  I think Zack's
                    wishing power's gotten out of control.

                                    GWEN
                    Wishing power?  Get real.  In
                      California all the snack trucks sell
                    lobster.

                                      SPENCER
                    And what about Floyd hosing down
                    Vernon?

                                    GWEN
                    We all wish for that.  Listen Spence,
                    you want to be a scientist, right?

                                      SPENCER
                    Yes.

                                    GWEN
                    So be a scientist.  Don't rely on
                    your emotions.  Be logical.  When
                    you see something paranormal don't
                    let the excitement of the moment run
                    away from you -- oh...my...God! 
                    It's Little Ricky from Scrap Heap! 
                          (screams)
                    OH MY GOD!  He is so cute!  He's
                    epic!  Little Ricky!  OH MY GOD!

      Gwen screams again.  She starts to weep.

                    By now we've missed the sound check. 
                    And the lame warm-up band.  We've
                    even missed where Little Ricky tosses
                    his scarf and some girl loses it.


      Zack and Cam slog through the mess looking for an exit.

                                    ZACK
                    You know, you'd really think that
                    they'd sort the plastic from the

                                    CAM
                    Why?  It was your stupid wish that
                    got us here. 

                                    ZACK
                    There's gotta be an exit around here
                      somewhere.

      OFF Zack's determination--      The Zack Files - Misfortune Cookie                       18.



      Cam stops Zack at a pile of rusted cars.

                    Zack, this Beamer.  We passed it
                    before.

                                    ZACK
                    We're going in circles.

                                    CAM
                    We're lost.

                                    ZACK
                    Wait.  Maybe we're trapped.  What
                    did you say?

                                    CAM
                      We...are...lost.

                                    ZACK
                    No.

                    No, I said I wish we were in our
                    front row seats to see Scrap Heap. 
                    Then you added "Scrap Heap forever." 
                    So maybe we're stuck in this...scrap
                    heap...

      Zack trails off.

                                    CAM
                    Forever?  I'm stuck with
                      you...forever?
                          (to the Gods)
                    Why couldn't it be Samantha Sax?


      Dan in a cab on the road.  (Production note: sixteen cars
      idling in the parking lot).

                                    TAXI DRIVER
                    Let's take the side streets, you
                    said.  Less traffic, you said. 

      Frustrated, the TAXI DRIVER leans on his horn.

                                    DAN
                    I'm sorry.  You see my son's home
                    alone -- he's supposed to be home --
                    and I worry.  You know what it's
                    like.  You have kids, right?

      The Taxi Driver leans out his window and screams at the
      traffic:

                                    TAXI DRIVER
                    Hey!  Move it or lose it!  Or there's
                    no desert for you!

                                    DAN
                    I'm guessing three or four.      The Zack Files - Misfortune Cookie                       21.



      Cam and Zack.

                                    CAM
                    Weeds.  The first of your five basic
                    food groups of the junk yard.  For
                    protein, rats.  For dairy, rats milk.

                                    ZACK
                    The wishes worked for me at first. 
                    Maybe the fortune cookie was trying
                    to teach me something.

                                    CAM
                    Zack, nobody learns anything from a
                    fortune cookie.

      Cam spots something in the rubbish.  He picks up:

                                    CAM (CONT'D)
                    But a magic eight ball -- now that's
                    powerful juju.  Does Samantha Sax
                    like me?
                          (shakes the toy and
                            reads:)
                    "Maybe."  Will we ever get out of
                    here?
                          (shakes and reads)
                    "Highly Doubtful."

      He throws away the magic eight ball.

                                    ZACK
                    I could wish that none of this ever
                    happened.

                                    CAM
                    Great.  Then maybe we were never
                    born.

                                    ZACK
                    Well, I could wish for my Dad to be
                    here.  He'd know what to do.  This
                    is all my fault.

                                    CAM
                    I'm okay with that.

      Cam walks away from Zack.

                                    ZACK
                    Wait.  Come back.

                                    ZACK (CONT'D)
                    The fortune cookie said only my best
                    wishes would be granted.  The wishes
                    started to work against me after I
                    lied to my Dad.

                                    CAM
                    Your best wishes?

                                    ZACK
                    They weren't my best wishes anymore,
                    my best intentions.  I should have
                    been straight with my Dad.  You know
                    what I wish?

      Cam braces himself for disaster.

                                    CAM
                    Here we go.  All we are is dust in
                    the wind.

                                    ZACK
                    I wish I'd done the right thing.

      THUNDER RUMBLES and...


      Gwen stares at the camera.

                                    GWEN
                    And then for their encore, Ricky,
                    Jimmy and Stu played "You're My Girl". 
                    It was like they were singing just
                    for me.  Just for me.  Ricky, if you
                    are watching this, please write me
                    back.  Anyways, they are really
                    skilled musicians.  Julliard trained. 
                    Half the time you can't even tell
                    that they're lip-syncing.
