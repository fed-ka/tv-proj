BILL
I have no idea. I thought he was

TOM
Jen, I gave you specific orders to
get some handlers and keep Brad
locked down until after the

JEN
I did! They flew to the ranch in
Maui last night!
TOM
Maui?! Wasn't he at the villa in
South Hampton?

I thought he was at the chalet in
Aspen.

Nope... It was the compound in

Brad holds out his fist and Bill reluctantly hits it.
On
his way out, Brad chest-bumps Tom.
TOM
Bill, you've got to shut this
down, now. Tell Brad he can't
work with you, period.
BILL
No, no. I love his enthusiasm...
It's just a little misguided.
There must be something he can do
for the campaign, where he can't
hurt us.

Exactly.

Sounds dangerous...
BRETT
It'll be perfectly safe.

JEN
We hire actors to play gangsters.
TOM
They car-jack Brad,

Uh... just this...
Brad pulls out another pager, a phone, another phone.
Sean and PJ both pull several more out of his other
pockets, as well as his wallet.
PJ
All that James Bond electronic
crap can't save you now, fool.
Sit ya ass down.
Brad does, and PJ duct-tapes his hands behind his back.
PJ
We gonna go call yo daddy.
SEAN
You better pray he home. If he
not, you're one dusted trick!
Sean, PJ and Shondra exit, slamming the door behind them.

SEAN
Sure, Shondra, sorry. You're on.
Go play good cop. We've gotta

Shondra rolls her eyes and heads back into the room.

Shondra enters.
Brad turns away.
SHONDRA
You a'ight in here?
BRAD
Oh yeah. I just been kidnapped,
carjacked, hands tied behind my
back, but other than that, it's
all good.
SHONDRA
Look, I'm sorry about all that, it
wasn't my idea.
BRAD
I thought you liked me.
SHONDRA
I do.
BRAD
Then how come you set me up?
SHONDRA
I had to. They...

For Real?!
SHONDRA
Lemme school you on something,
help you to stay alive, a'ight?
The one thing they hate more than
anything, that really sets them
off, is posers.
BRAD
I feel you, girl, me too.
SHONDRA
I'm talkin' 'bout you!
BRAD
Me? But I hate posers! I got a
Ph.D. -- a Poser-Hater Degree.
SHONDRA
Come on.
Quit frontin'.
BRAD
I ain't fron'in'.
SHONDRA
Listen to reason. If you just be
a nice little white boy and say
you're sorry, I think I can
convince them to let you go.
BRAD
Damn. I am who I say I am. Why
won't anyone believe me? This is
a issue that's been comin' up a

BRAD
Huh?

That he'd have to think about it.
BRAD
(incredulous)
What?
Straight up?
PJ
He's not sure he wants you back,

SEAN
Can't see as I blame him.

PJ
And a fifth of Henny.
(to Sean)
Anything else?
BRAD
I'd like some Pringles.
SEAN
This ain't a picnic, bitch!
BRAD
I'm sorry, I'm sorry... y'all got
some duckets, 'cause I'm tapped.
SEAN
You about to go up in there and
give this Korean bitch yo ends?
Hell no.
PJ
You jack that shit.
SEAN
And if the Asiatic gives you any
static, show the brotha this...
He hands Brad one of the prop guns -- a Glock.
It's
heavier than Brad thought. He drops it.
PJ
Little trick claims he down, can't
even swing a gat.

Do it, punk, or I'll use that on

Brad sticks the prop gun into his pants and gets out.
As
soon as he's in the store, Sean and PJ burst into
laughter.
PJ
This is gonna be classic.
SEAN
He's gonna run out of there a
scared little white boy.
They laugh again and pound it.

Brad walks in, very nervous.
He looks back -- his car is
parked so that PJ can see him
through the door. PJ
smiles and shows him the gun
again. Brad swallows and
approaches the counter. The
KOREAN GUY behind it watches
him closely.
KOREAN GUY
Yes?
BRAD
Yeah, uh, where the Old English
at?
KOREAN GUY
Back there, under security camera.
BRAD
Thank you, sir.
Brad hurries to the back of the store, and spots a door
by the beer cooler. He tries to open it. It's locked.
Brad looks up to the security mirror and sees that the
Korean Guy is watching him. He moves to the beer cooler
and tries to calm down.

BRAD
Namyoho renge kyo, namyoho renge

It's not working. Brad tries a cleansing
breath. It
doesn't help either. Brad gathers up an
armful of Old
English 40s and heads for the front. The
Korean Guy
watches him as he walks past the counter
toward the door.
KOREAN GUY
Can I help you?
BRAD
Naaw, but I'ma help myself to all
this O.E., and whatever else I
want!
KOREAN GUY
No, stop.
Brad drops the beer. It CRASHES to the floor in SLOW
MOTION. Brad makes a crazy, threatening face as he pulls
back a fist, but the Korean Guy throws a fast right hand,
landing squarely on Brad's chin. Brad goes down like a
sack of hammers; then we FLASHBACK TO:
Moments earlier: We realize we've just been in a fantasy,
as Brad again approaches the counter with his beer.
KOREAN GUY
Can I help you?
BRAD
(nervous)
Let me axe you something.
Ever
been robbed?
KOREAN GUY
Oh sure. Last week was my fifty-
fourth time. But they were cool,
no gun to head, never scream; you
know, good people.
BRAD
Cool.
He sets the 40s on the counter, then reaches into his
waistband for his gun, and we...

SEAN
How much did you have to give this
guy, anyway?
PJ

SEAN

When you set this thing up
yesterday, what did you pay?
PJ
I thought you set it up.
SEAN
You mean the owner doesn't know
this is all fake?
PJ
Oh damn.
SEAN
Get in there!
He could get shot!
PJ
I'm not going in there!
You go in

They continue to argue as we...

Brad finishes reaching into his waistband for the Glock,
but feels something else. He pulls out a small wallet
that was Velcroed to his belt.
BRAD
My emergency stash.
Thank you

He pulls out a hundred and kisses it.
KOREAN GUY

Glad you got cash, 'cause if you
try to jack me, I was gonna have
to lay you out wid dis...

He whips a .44 from under the counter and aims it at
Brad.
KOREAN GUY
... and wid dis.
The Korean Guy's wife has an AK-47 on Brad, the red dot
of its laser sight trained steadily in the middle of his
forehead.
KOREAN GUY
... And wid dat.
The Korean Guy's six-year-old boy has a sawed-off shotgun
pointed at Brad's knees. The gun is bigger than the boy.
The Koreans laugh at Brad. Brad drops the hundred on the
counter.
BRAD
Keep the change.
KOREAN GUY
(ringing it up)
Thank you very much. Come again.
As Brad looks out to make sure PJ and Sean haven't seen
anything, the Korean Guy sticks the receipt in between
two of the 40s. Unaware, Brad gathers his stuff and
heads to the door.
BRAD
Uh, I know this is gonna sound
wack, but what I'm about to do is
just a joke, so don't shoot me,
okay?

Brad snaps out of it for a minute.
BRAD

Great, fine. Terrific popcorn.

KICKS IN; Brad's eyes snap back to the

Brad enters and takes in the club. Think 8 Mile.
Hardcore GANGSTER TYPES and some tough HOME GIRLS check

show you exactly what kind of place you're in.
SEAN
How you feelin' now, Malibu?
BRAD
Finally, a place where I feel at
home.
PJ
(disgusted)
Get yo' ass in there.
Brad boldly fist-shakes jaw-dropped patrons as he wades
through the crowd, AD LIBBING "Whassup?" and "Pardon me,
homey."
ON STAGE
DROP finishes and the MC brings up STEEL and YOUNG DRE,
announcing the Battle Rap Competition. Steel and Young

expressionless.
SHONDRA
None of your damn bizness, Tec.
Now let go.
She yanks her arm away from him.
TEC
Y'all been busy, huh?
SHONDRA
Too busy for you.
TEC
You been gettin' busy?
SHONDRA
Hell no.
TEC
Come on, girl, I'm cool.

All you need to know is that it

TEC
You know, you ain't shit, Shondra.
You're just a chickenhead, and

Damn, man. Don't you know how to

SHONDRA
Brad, don't --
TEC
It's cool, Shondra.

Tec releases Shondra's arm and immediately grabs Brad by
the throat and hangs him over the balcony.
TEC
Didn't yo mama teach you to mind

BRAD

Don't be hatin'.
SHONDRA
Don't do it, Tec!

Sean and PJ finally make it to the MC, who stands with

Yo!
Sean bumps the DJ table. A vicious look from the DJ, as
Sean tries to play it off. The MC just looks at him
disdainfully.
PJ
Uh... My boy want Young Dre next.
The MC looks them over...
MC
Hell, nah...
SEAN
Maybe a C-Note would open some...
equal opportunities?
MC

A-ight y'all. Up next, to

rad from Malibu.
Looks of confusion, as the Crowd searches for "B-rad."
SHONDRA
Wait a second. Brad, don't do it.
Brad turns to Shondra, looks at the keys, and shakes his
head.
BRAD
Shondra, I gots to do 'dis. this
is my shot. I gotta prove myself.
Shondra can't argue. Brad starts to the stage. A WAVE
OF SHOCK, as the crowd realizes who B-rad actually is.
SHONDRA
This is gonna be like an episode

Brad gets his game face on and walks the gauntlet on his
way to the stage -- an imposing path of intimidating
looks.

He is then dragged up onto the stage. He misinterprets
the ANTAGONIZING CHANTS as encouragement and tries to
high-five the crowd -- no takers. The MC and Young Dre
laugh at him.
YOUNG DRE
Nah, nah, nah... I ain't gonna
battle no bitch. What am I? Ike
Turner?
The crowd LAUGHS.
Brad cluelessly laughs along with
them.
MC
A-ight, a-ight... We gotta do

BRAD
Tizzaizzlszzs!
Everyone is totally confused.
BRAD

Tails... I want tails.
The MC flips and "tails" it is.
MC
You wanna go first?
BRAD
Nah... Ladies first.
Brad LAUGHS, turning to the crowd to appreciate his lame
burn... Nothing. Young Dre looks furious.
Young Dre grabs the mic and the DJ spins. Young Dre
proceeds to incinerate Brad. With every line, the crowd
goes insane. (NOTE: Actual Young Dre Rap to Come.)
As Young Dre flows, Brad is visibly shaken, but tries to
play it off -- not so discreetly scribbling notes on his
hand and up his arm.
Young Dre finishes with devastating blow, dropping the
mic on the stage. The crowd goes wild...

Whooo... GOD DAMN! Now, let's see

place.
TAUNTS and LAUGHS as the beat plays again. Brad wags his
head, ready to come in strong. He looks down at his
notes... He's sweating so badly his arm is a mess of
runny ink.
He freezes again... The crowd is really on him now --
collectively making the "choke" sign.
BRAD
I'm cool... I'm cool.
Brad finally starts up.

You're so pretty.
SHONDRA
Thank you.
Brad leans in and kisses her tenderly. She kisses him

SHONDRA
I said kiss, fool. Damn.
She gets up and heads for the door.
SHONDRA
I offered you a snack, not the

Right, right, I'm liking it.
They start riffing on the idea, getting excited.
GARY
With a dead son, the sympathy
factor could give us big spike in
the female and gay demos.
BRETT
We've had such a problem with
Bill's rich guy image, we could
spin the issue to make him more
'Everymen,' you know, 'crime
touches everyone,' like that.
TOM
What about a voter backlash, like
how could he run on the heels of a
tragedy?
GARY
No -- we push the 'courage under
adversity' angle.
BRETT
Helps with his leadership profile.
JEN

Tom leans in, with a "Manager" nametag, whispering
angrily:
TOM
Push the Mega Meal, or you punks
are so fired.

Shondra puts the finishing touches to a woman in a chair.
BRAD (V.O.)
She styled up all the ladies in
Malibu so they were stone-cold
ghetto fabulous.
Shondra spins the chair to REVEAL: BEES GLUCKMAN with a
crazy ghetto hairstyle. She looks like Busta Rhymes.
She checks herself in the mirror.
BESS
I love it.
(alternate)
Boo-ya!
She smiles revealing a GOLD TOOTH with a DIAMOND in it.

CHEERS, as Bill takes the mic (As he speaks, we SLOWLY
PULL BACK, gradually revealing the people next to him on
stage).
BILL
This is a monumental day for our
glorious state and there are
several people I need to thank
here tonight...
(beat)
There's the International
Brotherhood of Police Officers...
APPLAUSE, as POLICE OFFICERS salute Bill.
BILL
The Southern California Rotary
Club...
A table full of well-dressed PROFESSIONALS wave politely.
BILL
And our friends at the
Environmental Defense Fund...
A group of granola-type ENVIRONMENTALISTS smile.
Brad CLEARS HIS THROAT, causing Bill to look at him.
Brad gives Bill a "reminder" nod...
BILL
Oh, and of course...
PULL BACK TO REVEAL:
We're actually in the PROUD BIRD...
BILL
(matter of factly)
... all the Bitches and Ho's...

A pod of SKANKY WOMEN snap their fingers in Bill's
direction.
BILL
The Pimps... The Hoodrats...
The lavishly-dressed PIMPS raise their canes to Bill.
BILL
The Association of Korean Grocers.
An ASIAN FAMILY give Bill the "thumbs-up."
BILL
The Playas. The Ballers. The
Shot Callers. And a special shout
out to the I-9's.
ANGLE ON TEC
and his gang.
They wear dark suits and do rags.
BILL
And... The Women's Organization of
California.
A table full of prim ELDERLY LADIES golf-clap and smile.
BILL
And most of all, I'd like to thank
my campaign advisor on urban
affairs, and my son, B-rad G.
APPLAUSE as Brad grabs the mic at the podium.
BRAD
West Coast Reprezzizzin'!
Bill and Brad hug.
HIP HOP MUSIC KICKS IN and the entire
Ballroom turns into
one huge dance party. Bill raises the
roof as he
meanders into the celebrating crowd.
People of all
different races and backgrounds dance
together, all
having a blast...
Hadji grinds on an ELDERLY CONSTITUENT's ass... she's
into it.
HADJI
I'm totally taxing your ass.

Bess compares her diamond ring to Tec's Bling-Bling.
BESS
You get that from Tiffany?
TEC
I think that was the Bitches'
name, yeah...
They continue to marvel at each other's decorative
accessories...
ANGLE ON ELSEWHERE IN THE PARTY
We see Sean and PJ are caterers, wearing "Wiener on a
Bun" outfits/hats and circulating among the guests.
They approach a well-to-do PARTYGOER.
PJ
Would you care for a wiener?
Courtesy of Wiener on a Bun.
SEAN
Or perhaps I can interest you in a
head shot? I'm trained in jazz
dance, tap, and I can do a
Southern accent.
Tom enters wearing a "Wiener on a Bun" manager's outfit.
TOM
Idiots. What did I tell you about
bothering the guests? Now move
it, those wieners aren't serving
themselves.
He pushes them out of there.
BRAD (O.S.)
Yo, yo, yo...
Everyone turns to see Brad still at the podium.
Confusion...
BRAD
Last time I was here, y'all threw
my ass out. But now that I haves
yo attention, I gots somethin' I
gotta say... And I have to do it
the only way I know how... Kick
it, Moch.

TEETH RATTLING BASS THUNDERS, as Brad pulls the mic out
of the stand and begins prowling around the stage.
(NOTE: Rap can be shortened.)
SLOW MOTION:
Panic, as everyone realizes Brad is about
to rap...
BRAD
I wrote this one just for you,
Dad.
(starts to rap)
Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah,
yeah... Yeah...
(stops)
I'm sorry, I lost my place again.
(remembers)
Oh, here we go...
Election, erection,
I got an infection.
My pops, he won,
Defying all the pre-dections...
Sean and PJ (waiters) drop their serving trays; Tec and
the I-9's dive for Brad at the podium; Shondra screams,
"NOOOOOO"...
Brad is grabbed and thrown off the stage by the I-9's and
is projected out over the audience, where we...
FREEZE ON:
Brad's terrified face.
BRAD (V.O.)
(cocky as ever)
What can I say, ain't nothing but
a thang...
UNFREEZE and Brad falls to the ground.
