A private day school. Twenty 10th grade boys are sitting in desks in geometry class. They are dressed in school uniform, light blue shirts and khakis. The boys look dazed and sleepy.
The teacher, MR. ADAMS, is at the front of the room, finishing a complicated equation on the chalkboard.
MR. ADAMS
Except when the value of the x coordinate is less than or equal to the value of the -- Yes, Isaac?
A boy named ISAAC has raised his hand
ISAAC
What about that problem?
Isaac points to a startling and intricate arrangement of huge numbers and strange symbols filling up a forgotten corner of the chalkboard. The heading above it says Extra Credit.
MR. ADAMS
Oh, I really just put that up there as a joke. That's probably the hardest geometry problem in the world.
ISAAC
How much extra credit is it worth?
MR. ADAMS
Well, I've never seen anyone get it right before, including my mentor, Dr. Leaky at MIT. So I guess if anyone here can do it,
(pause)
I'd see to it that none of you ever have to open another math book again for the rest of your lives.
There is some quite murmuring. The name Fischer is repeated over and over. The boys begin to look to a student in the back row.
Unlike his classmates, he wears the Rushmore school blazer with insignia on the breast pocket and a Rushmore rep tie knotted tightly. His hair is smartly parted and swept back. He is extremely skinny and pale. He is MAX FISCHER.
Max has a cup of coffee on his desk and he is reading the Wall Street Journal.
MR. ADAMS
Max ? You want to try it ?
Max looks up.
MAX
I'm sorry. Did someone say my name?
Everyone laughs. Max smiles slightly. He buttons his blazer and straightens his tie. He picks up his cup of coffee and takes a sip. He goes to the chalkboard and sets to work.
The boys watch with nervous anticipation. Mr. Adams compares Max's progress with e notes in his book. Max's equations quickly fills up most of the chalkboard. He finishes it with a flourish, throws his piece of chalk in the trash, and turns to face the
class.
Everyone looks to Mr. Adams. Mr. Adams raises an eyebrow. He nods.
The classroom erupts into wild, ecstatic applause. Everyone surrounds Max, cheering, as he walks calmly back to his desk. They hoist him into the air.
CUT TO:
Max with his eyes closed, smiling serenely, listening to the applause. He mutters:
MAX
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please.
A little hand grabs Max's arm and shakes him. Max opens his eyes. The person shaking him is his chapel partner, DIRK CALLOWAY, a fourth grader with neatly white hair. Max looks around.
They are in chapel, surrounded by rows of boys in school uniforms. Dirk puts his finger to his lips.
DIRK
Shh.
Max rubs his eyes and sits up in the pew. The applause dies down and Max looks to the pulpit as the guest chapel speaker, HERMAN BLUME, steps up to the microphone.
Mr. Blume is a tough looking guy about fifty years old in a black suit. He begins his chapel speech.
MR. BLUME
You guys have it real easy. I never had it like this where I grew up. But I send my kids here. Because, the fact is, whether you deserve it or not: you go to one of the best schools in the country.
Max's eyes light's up.
MR. BLUME
Rushmore. You lucked out.
Max leans forward to the railing and begins to listen intently.
MR. BLUME
Now, for some of you it doesn't matter. You were born rich, and you're going to stay rich. But here's my advice to the rest of you: take dead aim on the rich boys. Get them in the crosshairs. And take them down.
Some of the students and faculty begin to look at each other with puzzled expressions. Max is nodding and taking notes on the flypage of a hymnal.
INSERT HYMNAL:
Rushmore -- best school in country.
rich kids -- bad?
MR. BLUME
Just remember: they can buy anything. But they can't buy backbone. Don't let them forget that. Thank you.
Mr. Blume leaves the podium. Max leaps to his feet and leads the applause. The organ starts and everyone stands up.
A paneled room with wooden floors, an old electric fan in the windowsill, and paintings of ducks and geese on the walls. Dr. Guggenheim is seated at his little oak desk. Max sits across from him and in an antique leather armchair.
DR. GUGGENHEIM
We're putting you on what we call sudden death academic probation.
MAX
(pause)
And what does that entail ?
DR. GUGGENHEIM
It entails that if you fail another class, you are going to be asked to leave Rushmore.
MAX
I see.
(raises an eyebrow)
In other words, I'll be expelled.
DR. GUGGENHEIM
Right.
Silence.
MAX
Dr. Guggenheim. I don't want to tell you how to do your job. But the fact is no matter how hard I try, I still might flunk another class. And if that means I have to stay on for a post-graduate year, then so be it. But if --
DR. GUGGENHEIM
We don't offer a postgraduate year.
MAX
Well. We don't offer it yet.
(pause)
And what about the fact that I'm probably dyslexic?
DR. GUGGENHEIM
You're not dyslexic.
MAX
Well, I'm a terrible speller.
DR. GUGGENHEIM
Just bring up the grades.
Max sighs. He looks out the window and says quietly:
MAX
Do you remember how I got into this school?
DR. GUGGENHEIM
Yeah, I do. You wrote a play.
MAX
That's right. A little one act. And my mother read it and felt I should go to Rushmore. And you read it, and you gave me a scholarship, didn't you ?
Dr. Guggenheim nods.
MAX
Do you regret it?
DR. GUGGENHEIM
No, I don't regret it. But I still might have to expel you.
Max nods. He smiles sadly and whispers:
MAX
Couldn't we just let me float by? For old times' sake?
DR. GUGGENHEIM
(grimly)
Can't do it, Max.
A long table in the Rushmore library. Max is reading a library copy of a book about Jacques Cousteau. He is also playing backgammon with a freshman named ALEX.
ALEX
Did you hear they're teaching Japanese next year?
MAX
That's the rumor.
ALEX
And they're canceling Latin.
MAX
What? I tried to get Latin canceled for five years. "It's a dead language," I'd always say.
ALEX
Well, I guess they finally heard you.
Max shakes his head as this sinks in.
MAX
At least I saved Dirk from the horror.
Max turns the page of his book. There is a little note written in the margin in pencil with an arrow pointing to the text. Max frowns. He turns the book sideways to read it.
INSERT FRAGMENT OF NOTE IN BOOK:
which reminds me of a quote from Henry James: Try to be one of the people whom nothing is lost.
Max's frown disappears. A change comes over his face. His eyes glaze over dreamily. He looks to Alex.
MAX
Who's Henry James?
ALEX
I don't know.
Max looks back at the book. He studies the quote. He gets up and goes to the check-out counter. He shows the book to the LIBRARIAN.
MAX
What does this mean?
The librarian reads the Henry James quote.
LIBRARIAN
It means try to be worldly.
MAX
You mean like smart.
LIBRARIAN
More or less. Yeah.
MAX
I'd like to see a list of all the people who've checked out this book in the past year.
The librarian goes through the cards in a little wooden box.
INSERT SCRAP OF PAPER:
Miss. Cross, 1st grade, room 121
Max walks down a hallway in the lower school. He is carrying the little scrap of paper, checking room numbers as he walks.
He looks in some of the rooms. He sees kids sitting at tables with scissors and paste. Kids watching a movie on science. Kids curled up on mats during naptime.
And then he sees room 121. He goes up to the door and looks through the window.
A class of first graders is sitting Indian-style in a little circle on the floor. The teacher is in a tiny little kids' chair, reading aloud from Kidnapped. She is twenty-eight. She wears a cardigan sweater and her hair pulled back like a ballet dancer. She is MISS CROSS.
Max's eyes are glued to the glass. He cracks open the door an inch to listen to her voice.
MISS CROSS
I have seen wicked men and fools, a great many of both; and I believe they both get paid in the end.
(darkly:)
But the fools first.
She looks up mysteriously. She turns the page and continues:
MISS CROSS
Chapter fifteen. The Lad with the Silver Button.
Mr. Blume has a gigantic office with paintings of battle scenes and Viking ships, a coat of armor and a statue of a discus thrower. The concrete plant is outside the window.
A portrait of the Blume family hangs on the wall behind Mr. Blume's desk. His wife and twin sons are all fair-skinned redheads. Mr. Blume is dark and sullen. He is smoking a cigarette in the painting.
Mr. Blume sits at his desk with a silver military issue. 45 automatic disassembled in front of him. He is cleaning it and drinking a Bloody Mary. His SECRETARY buzzes him on the speakerphone. Mr. Blume pushes a button on it.
MR. BLUME
Yeah?
SECRETARY
Mrs. Blume wants you to pick up the twins from school at --
MR. BLUME
Tell them to take the fucking bus.
SECRETARY
OK.
Max is sitting in a parked Jaguar with Dirk's mother, MRS. CALLOWAY. She is beautiful. She is dressed in tennis clothes and wears a terrycloth visor.
Max is wearing a fluorescent orange crossing guard's belt with a badge at the shoulder that says Patrol Chief. He hands Mrs. Calloway his phone number.
MRS. CALLOWAY
Thank you, Max. I told Mr. Calloway the other day how fortunate we are to have someone like you looking out for Dirk.
MAX
My pleasure. I'm just trying to impart some of the experiences I've accrued to help Dirk. There he is now. Nice talking with you, Mrs. Calloway.
They shake hands. Max gets out of the car and puts his hand on Dirk's shoulder.
MAX
How'd the math test go?
DIRK
What math test?
MAX
I thought you had a math test today.
DIRK
No. Did you turn in your paper on the Berlin Airlift ?
MAX
Yeah, I got an extension.
Dirk gets in the car and drives off. A seventh grader named BOBBY goes over to Max.
BOBBY
How'd it go?
MAX
I shook hands with her.
BOBBY
Big deal.
MAX
And I gave her my phone number.
BOBBY
Buchan said he'd have already banged her by now.
MAX
He said that?
Max looks across he yard at MAGNUS BUCHAN, the burly foreign exchange student from Scotland. He is seventeen. He has a straw in his mouth and he shoots a little blowdart at a little kid's neck.
Half of Buchan's ear was blown-off in a hunting accident.
MAX
That's a really crude thing to say. That's Dirk's mother.
BOBBY
But I thought that's why you picked Dirk as your chapel partner.
MAX
(looks at Bobby, pause)
What are you, a lawyer? All I'm saying is that gorilla is a guest at our school for the year, so respect our women the say way we would in his jerkwater country.
Mr. Blume pulls up in a brand new black Bentley.
MAX
Mr. Blume!
Max goes over to Mr. Blume's car.
MAX
It's Max Fischer.
MR. BLUME
(weary)
Hi, Max.
They shake hands through the open car window.
MAX
How's the concrete business?
MR. BLUME
Oh, I don't know. By the time you hit 45 you're been fucked over so many times you don't really care anymore.
MAX
I'm sorry to hear that.
Mr. Blume sighs deeply. He stares out the windshield.
MR. BLUME
What's the secret, Max?
MAX
The secret?
MR. BLUME
Yeah. You look like you've got it all figured out.
MAX
(pause)
I don't know. I think you just gotta find something you love to do, then do it for the rest of your life.
(shrugs)
For me, it's going to Rushmore.
Max looks very serious. Mr. Blume smiles and nods.
MAX
Hey, Ronny. Hey, Donny.
Mr. Blume's red-headed twins RONNY and DONNY come over to the car. They're Max's age but much more thick and solid.
RONNY
Shotgun.
Donny gets in the front seat anyway. Ronny hollers:
RONNY
I said shotgun, Donny!
MR. BLUME
Get in the back, Ronny.
RONNY
I said, "Shotgun." Get in the back, Donny.
Donny punches three different buttons on the dash that crank up the AC full blast. Mr. Blume's hair dances in the cold burst of air. He shuts off the AC.
MAX
See you tomorrow, Mr. Blume.
(looks off)
Mrs. Reynolds!
Max goes over to shake hands with somebody else's parents. Mr. Blume looks at Max fondly.
MR. BLUME
Did you invite that kid to your party?
DONNY
(shocked)
Max Fischer?
RONNY
Come on, Dad. There's gonna be girls there.
DONNY
I'd rather die. Pull your head out of your ass.
Mr. Blume turns Donny quickly like he is going to attack him. Donny cowers grinning in the backseat with his fists up. Ronny pipes in:
RONNY
Remember what Mom said. Hugs not hits.
The school auditorium. The stage is bare except for two folding chairs. A tall senior plays FRANK. He is wearing a stocking cap and sunglasses. A fat kid plays WILLIE.
FRANK
Wait a second. What time did the old lady place the 911 call?
WILLIE
Ten-fifteen.
FRANK
(snaps his fingers)
That's it.
Frank jumps out of his seat.
FRANK
Meet me on the corner in ten minutes.
WILLIE
Where are you going?
FRANK
I'll tell you in the squad car.
He heads towards the wings, then stops.
FRANK
Oh, and, Willie. You were wrong about Enrique Sanchez. He died in his sleep.
He exits.
MAX
Excellent!
Willie looks into the darkness beyond the stage. Max emerges and quickly climbs the steps onto the stage. He is followed by Dirk who is holding a script.
MAX
Excellent. Irving?
The stage manager is a wavy-haired sophomore named IRVING. He comes out from the backstage. Max pulls some money out of his pocket and hands it to him.
MAX
Get some rootbeers for anybody who wants one. I don't want one. OK. Next scene. (looks at Dirk's script) Frank, you enter stage right with a bag of cocaine.
A small, clean barbershop. MR. FISCHER is a white-haired man of sixty-five in a white a white barber's shirt. He has finished giving a buzzcut to a twelve year-old boy named GORDON.
GORDON
May I see the back, please?
Mr. Fischer holds up a hand mirror so Gordon can see the back. Gordon nods. Max comes in rolling a Japanese ten-speed at his side.
MR. FISCHER
Hey, Max. How was your day?
MAX
Hm. I'd say
(thinks for a second)
98% good, 2% not so good. I need a signature on this geometry test, by the way.
Max leaves his test on the counter and rolls his bike into the back room. Gordon gives Mr. Fischer ten dollars.
GORDON
Thank you very much.
Gordon goes out the door. Mr. Fischer looks at the geometry test. Max comes out of the back room drinking a glass of chocolate milk with a straw.
MR. FISCHER
Hm.
MAX
I know.
MR. FISCHER
A 37.
MAX
Pathetic. Just pathetic.
MR. FISCHER
Well. It could have been worse. You were right more than a third of the time.
MAX
(exploding)
Come on, Dad! That stinks! I can do better than that!
MR. FISCHER
Of course, you can.
MAX
For once, will you please try not to look on the bright side?
MR. FISCHER
Sit down and let me give you a trim.
Max sighs deeply. He sits down. Mr. Fischer signs the geometry test. He puts a pale blue smoke over Max and gives him a haircut.
MAX
Do you think I'm stupid?
MR. FISCHER
No! You're just not very good at math.
MAX
But I'm failing English and History, too.
MR. FISCHER
(pause)
Well. Maybe you'd be better off at a school where there's not so much emphasis on academics.
MAX
What, like barber college?
Mr. Fischer is stricken. Max says quietly:
MAX
No, I love Rushmore. I don't want to go someplace second rate. Besides, it would ruin my chances of getting into Oxford.
Silence. Mr. Fischer looks very sad.
MR. FISCHER
I wish I knew how to help you. But I just don't. I'm sorry, Max.
Max looks at his dad. Mr. Fischer looks down at the floor.
MR. FISCHER
You want to see the back?
MAX
No, thanks. You know how I like it.
An Archie Bunker-type house. Max and Mr. Fischer sit on the sofa in front of the TV having TV dinners.
MAX
You think I'm spending too much of my time starting up clubs and putting on plays?
MR. FISCHER
I don't know. It's possible.
MAX
I should probably be trying harder to score chicks. That's the only thing anybody really cares about. (sighs deeply) But it's not my forte, unfortunately.
MR. FISCHER
It'll happen, Max. It's just. You're like one of those clipper ship captains. You're married to the sea.
MAX
Yes, that's true.
(pause)
But I've been out to sea for a long time.
A crowd of MIDDLE SCHOOLERS has gathered around Max. He is holding a clipboard. One of the kids finishes signing a piece of paper on it.
MAX
Good. Now you.
(points to the next kid)
Sign here.
The kid signs.
INSERT PIECE OF PAPER:
A long list of signatures. Many of them are written in little kid's handwriting. Some are neater. Across the top, it says PETITION. This is written in calligraphy.
CUT TO:
The administration conference room. TEN TEACHERS sit in chairs around a long table. Max stands before them finishing a speech. The petition is tacked-up on the wall behind him.
MAX
In summation, I have only one question: is Latin dead? Nisilum sacnus (pause, looks at his notecards) estne? Only you can say. Thank you for your time.
Applause.
INSERT ANNOUCEMENT:
Thanks to part of the efforts of 10th class member Max Fischer, Latin will now be a required course for grades 7 through
Max and a bunch of other kids are reading this announcement on the bulletin board. Max is smiling serenely. The others are cursing and looking at Max with angry faces. Magnus Buchan is one of them. He has a strong Scottish accent.
MAGNUS
Bugger off, Fischer. Ya bleedin' little bollocks.
MAX
Is that Latin?
Not bad, Buchan. Maybe you'll place out of your first year.
Mr. Blume's son Ronny is in a wrestling mach. He has his opponent in a chokehold and is slowly strangling him. Mr. Blume looks on distastefully from the stands. Max is at his side.
MR. BLUME
What does your dad do, Max?
MAX
(frankly)
He's a neurosurgeon. Over at St. Joseph's. Personally, I could never see myself cutting open somebody's brain. But he seems to enjoy it.
Max shrugs. Mr. Blume nods.
MAX
You were in Vietnam, if I'm not mistaken, weren't you?
Mr. Blume nods. Max thinks for a minute.
MAX
Were you in the shit?
MR. BLUME
Yeah. I was in the shit.
They look back out at the wrestling match. Ronny is crushing his opponent's face into the mat with his fist. Mr. Blume shakes his head.
MR. BLUME
Tell me something, Max. What do you think of Ronny and Donny?
MAX
(automatically)
I like them.
MR. BLUME
(surprised)
Really?
MAX
Sure.
Ronny flips his opponent on the mat and flattens him with his body. Donny screams encouragement.
MR. BLUME
No. You're right. They're good kids.
Max nods solemnly.
WRESTLER
See you Sunday, Mr. Blume.
A stocky Wrestler with an ice pack on his arm walks by on his way to the showers. Mr. Blume nods to him without looking up.
MAX
What's Sunday?
Mr. Blume looks to Max. Silence.
MR. BLUME
The twins are having a birthday party. And I'd love it if -
MAX
Oh, that's right. Yeah. I'm not going to be able to make it to that one.
Max smiles very sincerely. Silence.
MR. BLUME
Come work for me.
MAX
(stiffens)
What do you mean?
MR. BLUME
I mean, I could use somebody like you. I could -
MAX
I may not be rich, Mr. Blume. And my father may only be a doctor. But we manage.
MR. BLUME
(hesitates)
I didn't mean it like that. I just -
MAX
No, thank you. I mean, I appreciate the offer. But I've got everything I need right here at Rushmore. Besides, it wouldn't be fair.
REFEREE
110s!
MAX
Excuse me, Mr. Blume. Nice talking with you.
Max pulls off his blazer. He is wearing wrestling tights underneath. Mr. Blume looks surprised.
MR. BLUME
You're on the team?
MAX
(shrugs)
I'm an alternate.
Max heads out to the mat, pulling on his headgear. Mr. Blume calls after him:
MR. BLUME
What wouldn't be fair, Max?
MAX
(smiles crookedly)
We'd make way too much money working on the same team.
Mr. Blume smiles faintly. He watches as Max begins his match. Max is outclassed and quickly gets pinned.
Miss Cross is shepherding her class into her classroom. They are singing a song as they walk down the corridor. Across the hall, a fourth-grade teacher, Mrs. Guggenheim, comes out of her classroom. She is a handsome woman in her late sixties with black and silver hair.
MISS CROSS
Hello, Mrs. Guggenheim.
MRS GUGGENHEIM
Hi, Rosemary. Did you find a place?
MISS CROSS
Well, I'm just staying over at Edward's parents' house for now. They're out of town.
MRS GUGGENEHIM
Oh. That's good.
(pause)
Edward was one of my students, you know.
Miss Cross smiles and nods. Silence. Miss Cross points to a photograph in a collage on a wall.
MISS CROSS
I think I met that boy yesterday.
Mrs. Guggenheim looks at the picture.
INSERT PHOTOGRAPH:
It is black and white of Max in fifth grade singing a show tune. His arms are opened wide and he has a top hat in one hand and cane in the other.
MRS GUGGENHEIM
(frowns)
That's Max Fischer. How'd you get mixed up with him?
MISS CROSS
He introduced himself to me. I liked him, actually.
MRS GUGGENHEIM
(resigned)
Yeah, I know. So do I.
Miss Cross' classroom. The walls are lined with fish tanks that glow blue and make bubbling sounds. There are maps and pictures everywhere. A model of a 747 hangs from the ceiling. A record player plays the Vienna Boys' Choir at a low volume.
There is only one Kid in the room. He is taking a test. Miss Cross sits at her desk grading papers.
Max cracks open the door.
MAX
Miss Cross?
Miss Cross and the kid look back at Max. Miss Cross holds her finger to her lips and gets up. As she walks past the kid, she puts her hand on the top of his head. She goes to Max at the door. She whispers:
MISS CROSS
He's taking a make-up test.
MAX
These guys have tests?
MISS CROSS
Of course.
MAX
I thought they just did coloring and stuff.
MISS CROSS
Oh, no. They're good readers.
MAX
I'm Max Fischer. We met the other day.
MISS CROSS
I know who you are. How are you?
MAX
Fine, thank you.
Max just stands there.
MISS CROSS
You want to help me feed the fish?
MAX
Yes, please.
Max follows her from tank to tank as she shakes out fish food. They continue to whisper to each other:
MAX
I thought I would just let you know, as per our conversation the other day -
MISS CROSS
Latin?
MAX
Right. The Romance Languages. I gave a little speech -
MISS CROSS
I heard about this.
MAX
You did?
MISS CROSS
Uh-huh. I understand you made a very convincing argument.
MAX
I thought you'd be pleased to hear they're going to continue the Latin program.
She looks at Max. She sets down the fish food and shakes his hand.
MISS CROSS
I'm very impressed.
MAX
Thank you very much.
Max picks up the can of fish food and shakes some into one of the aquariums.
MAX
You need an assistant?
MISS CROSS
(smiles)
Do we get to have assistants around here?
MAX
I doubt it. I'm on scholarship, though. Academic scholarship. So sometimes, I get to do odd jobs.
(pause)
How did you decide to teach at Rushmore?
MISS CROSS
My husband went here.
Max drops the can of fish food into the tank. He quickly fishes it out.
He picks some little bits of fish food out of the water and throws them away. Pause.
MAX
I didn't know you were married.
MISS CROSS
Well, he's dead now. So I'm not actually married.
MAX
When did he die?
MISS CROSS
Last year.
Max nods. Silence.
MAX
My mother's dead.
MISS CROSS
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.
MAX
She died when I was seven. (raising an eyebrow)
So we both have dead people in our families.
They look at each other for a minute.
MAX
Now what's going on in here?
Max kneels down and looks into one of the fish tanks. There are a hundred little seahorses swimming around in it.
MISS CROSS
Those were just born.
A look of wonder comes across Max's face. He stares into the blue water.
MAX
You really love fish, don't you?
Miss Cross nods. Max puts his fingers to the glass.
MAX
How much do these cost?
Mr. Blume's office. HE is talking on the telephone. Max sits in a chair across from him.
MR. BLUME
I don't want any alloys. I want steel.
(pause)
I don't give a rat's ass if he did. (pause) Steel, Harry.
He hangs up.
MR. BLUME
You change your mind? You want the job?
MAX
No. But I've got an idea. And need some money.
Mr. Blume's secretary buzzes him on the speakerphone.
SECRETARY
Mr. Blume, they're ready for you in Hydraulics.
MR. BLUME
Come with me. Let's hear your idea.
Max, Mr. Blume, and a big foreman named Ernie race across the factory in a souped-up golf cart. They're squeezed together with Max in the middle.
MAX
Rushmore deserves an aquarium. A first class aquarium where scientists can lecture, and students can study marine life in their natural -
MR. BLUME
I don't know. What do you think, Ernie?
ERNIE
(skeptical)
An aquarium?
MAX
A huge aquarium. An entire building.
MR. BLUME
What kind of fish?
Mr. Blume and Max, wearing hard hats, stand on a scaffolding overlooking a huge cat of bubbling concrete.
MAX
(shouting)
Electric eels. Barracudas. Stingrays. Hammerheads. Piranhas.
MR. BLUME
Piranhas?
MAX
That's right. Piranhas. I talked to a man in South America.
MR. BLUME
Really. So you might have piranhas.
MAX
We will have piranhas.
Back in Mr. Blume's office. They're seated as before. Max is still wearing his hard hat.
MR. BLUME
What does Guggenheim say?
MAX
Nothing. I felt I should go to you first.
MR. BLUME
Why?
MAX
Because at this moment I feel our best strategy is to keep a low profile. The more preparation I can do, the stronger our case will be when we go to the administration.
Long pause.
MR. BLUME
How much do you want?
MAX
$35.000 for the initial plans.
Max holds Mr. Blume's gaze. Mr. Blume picks up a pen.
MR. BLUME
I'll give you $2500.
Max nods. Mr. Blume writes out a check, tears it off, and hands it to Max. Max sticks it in his pocket like it is a five-dollar bill.
RESEARCH MONTAGE:
All of the following events occur during school hours.
Max strides across the quadrangle with a determined expression. He's got an armload of books on marine life.
Max watches a Jacques Cousteau film on 16mm in an empty classroom. Dirk runs the projector.
Max visits a marine research facility and talks with a Scientist. Max holds up a fish at the edge of a pool. A killer whale jumps out of the water and takes it in its teeth.
Max flies over Rushmore in a chopper with Mr. Blume. He shouts out details of the landscape and Mr. Blume nods enthusiastically. They are both eating sandwiches.
They set down on the soccer field. Kids come running out to meet them. Max waves to them as he jumps out of the chopper. He looks back to Mr. Blume and gives him a thumbs-up. Mr. Blume smiles and waves as the chopper takes off.
Max walks with a young Architect among the trees between the gym and the baseball diamond. They look at some blueprints. Max pulls up third base and slides it over a few feet.
Max points to some beautiful fish in an aquarium in a pet shop. The pet shop Owner reaches in with a little net.
Max pokes his head into Miss Cross's classroom. He holds up two plastic baggies full of water with tropical fish swimming around inside them.
Kids gather all around them as they put the new fish into the aquariums. Max smiles mysteriously.
MAX
You need any help grading papers or anything?
INSERT BOOK REPORT:
The title is 'Young Ben Franklin'. Miss Cross writes Magnificent! Keep up the good work! And draws two stars across the top of the page with a red pen.
Max is staring at Miss Cross in a strange from a desk opposite hers in the empty classroom. She looks up at him. He continues to stare at her as if she were a statue.
Miss Cross rubs her eyes and sighs. She sets down her red pen. She looks back at Max. He is still staring at her.
MISS CROSS
Max?
Max looks quickly down to his papers.
MAX
Uh-huh?
MISS CROSS
Can I ask you something?
MAX
Sure.
MISS CROSS
Has it ever crossed your mind that you're way too young for me?
Max looks up. Miss Cross smiles faintly. Silence.
MAX
It's crossed by mind that you might consider that a possibility, yes.
MISS CROSS
Not to mention that you're a student -
MAX
And you're a teacher. And never the twain shall meet. I know, I'm not trying to pressure you into anything, Miss Cross. I'm surprised you brought it up so bluntly.
MISS CROSS
I just want to make sure -
MAX
We've become friends, haven't we?
MISS CROSS
Yes.
MAX
Good. That's all that matters to me.
Max thinks for a second, then presses on:
MAX
And the truth is neither one of us has the slightest idea where this relationships is going. We can't predict the future.
MISS CROSS
We don't have a relationship, Max.
MAX
But we're friends.
MISS CROSS
Yes. And that's all we're going to be.
MAX
That's what I meant by relationship. You want me to grab a dictionary?
MISS CROSS
I just want to make sure we understand each other.
MAX
I understand. You're not attracted to me. C'est la vie. I'm a big boy.
MISS CROSS
Max. You're fifteen. Attraction doesn't enter into it.
MAX
If you say so. All I'm getting at is I've never met anyone like you. Take that for whatever it's worth.
She thinks about this for a minute.
MISS CROSS
I think I can safely say I've never met anyone like you, either.
MAX
You haven't, have you?
Miss Cross shakes her head. Max says quietly:
MAX
You want to shake hands?
She puts out her hand and they shake hands across the desk. But they don't let go. They just look at each other.
MAX
I'm glad we had this conversation.
MISS CROSS
Me too.
They finally let go of each other's hands. Miss Cross looks away. She's not exactly sure what they just decided.
MAX
By the way. Are you free? Thursday night?
MISS CROSS
Free for what?
MAX
Dinner.
She looks at Max strangely.
MAX
We're getting a group together after the play.
INSERT PLAYBILL:
SERPICO
A new play by Max Fischer.
A very realistic set for a New York tenement apartment.
Four men sit at a table. Three wear dark suits: O'Reilly, Burnum and Fields. One has long hair, a beard, leather pants and a big silver crucifix around his neck. This is Frank Serpico. They are all played by high schoolers.
FRANK
I can't wear a wire! They're feeling me up every day!
O'REILLY
Come on, Frank. You'll have complete protection.
FRANK
(walking off)
I've heard that one before. I got to go put a dime in the meter.
BURNUM
Look, Officer Serpico. If you agree to testify in open court -
Frank wheels around and knocks the clipboard out of O'Reilly's hands. He grabs O'Reilly by both arms. Fields instinctively draws his firearm.
FRANK
Promise me one thing, O'Reilly. You're going to follow this all the way. To the end (snaps) Of the line, (snaps) where I got to be.
O'REILLY
(looking Frank right in the eye)
So help me, God.
The audience is deeply engrossed. A row of small kids are sitting on the floor very front.
Max watches from the wings. He looks out at the audience.
He sees Mr. Blume smiling proudly in the third row.
He sees Miss Cross sitting next to a big, curly-haired Medical Student in surgical scrubs. She leans close to him and whispers something in his ear. He smiles and nods and whispers something back.
Max stares at them blankly as a shoot-out erupts onstage.
Frank comes offstage with a bandage of his cheek and a cane in his hand. Max is waiting for him backstage. Max has on a headset and carries a clipboard. He is extremely keyed-up.
MAX
What happened to the cannoli line?
Max follows Frank as Frank walks quietly toward the dressing room.
MAX
You're supposed to say, "Forget about it, Sanchez -"
FRANK
(very angry)
I made a mistake, all right? It doesn't make any difference, anyway.
MAX
Hey, I'm letting it go. But don't tell me it doesn't matter. Every line matters.
FRANK
(yelling)
Get off my back!
MAX
Don't fuck with my play!
Frank turns around and punches Max in the nose. Max takes a swing and misses and they wrestle as people try to break it up.
The whole cast is onstage bowing as the audience applauds. Some of the actors motion to the wings.
Max walks out on the stage. He has a bloody Kleenex in each nostril. He waves to the audience. The applause roars.
The crowded dressing rooms. Actors are taking off their make- up. Max is drinking a champagne cocktail and talking with his father and an elderly Woman.
WOMAN
I thought the acting tonight was excellent.
MAX
It was better in rehearsals.
(to his father)
I'll catch up with you later, Dad. I've got a dinner to go to.
MR FISCHER
(interested)
Oh, yeah?
MAX
(pause)
Yeah. Cast and crew only.
Mr. Fischer feels left out but tries not to show it.
MR FISCHER
OK. Well, have a good time.
Miss Cross walks over to Max through the crowd. Her friend the medical student follows behind her. Max's expression is polite but inscrutable.
MISS CROSS
That was great, Max.
MAX
I'm so glad you could come.
MISS CROSS
I want you to meet a friend of mine. John Coats. Max Fischer.
MAX
(not looking at him)
Who's this guy?
MISS CROSS
(pause)
John.
Max looks at John. John smiles. Pause.
JOHN
I really liked your play, man. It was really cool.
Max nods. He drinks a long sip of his champagne cocktail.
MISS CROSS
What happened to your nose?
MAX
I got punched in the face.
(to John)
What's your excuse?
Mr. Blume comes over to them.
MR. BLUME
Am I going to get to meet your dad tonight, Max?
MAX
Nah. The old man's on call tonight. Mr. Blume, I'd like you to meet Miss Cross, and I didn't catch this young gentleman's name.
A fancy restaurant. Max is having dinner with Mr. Blume, Miss Cross and John. Max is drunk.
MAX
I like your nurse's uniform, guy.
JOHN
They're OR scrubs.
MAX
(pause)
OR they?
Mr. Blume laughs suddenly and wine goes up his nose. Max glances to him slyly, then looks back at John.
MAX
Well, they're totally inappropriate for the occasion.
JOHN
Well, I didn't know we were going to dinner.
MAX
That's because you weren't invited.
MR. BLUME
Take it easy, Max.
MISS CROSS
(angry)
You're the one who ordered him a Scotch and soda.
MAX
What's wrong with that? I can write a hit play. Why can't I have a drink when I want to unwind a little? So tell me, Curly. How do you know Miss Cross?
JOHN
We went to Harvard together.
MAX
(shrugs)
And I wrote a hit play. And directed it. So I'm not sweating it, either.
MR. BLUME
(signaling the waiter)
I'm going to get the check.
MAX
What do you think you're doing?
MR. BLUME
I'm getting the -
MAX
No, you're not.
The Waiter comes over. Max intercepts him:
MAX
I just wanted to thank you again for accommodating us. We only expected to be a party of three, but somebody invited himself along. I apologize.
WAITER
That's perfectly all right.
The waiter walks away. Miss Cross frowns.
MISS CROSS
You're being rude, Max.
MAX
No I'm not. I'm just trying to figure out why you brought this gentleman to my play. And my dinner, which was invitation only.
John reaches in front of Max for the butter. Max grabs his spoon and swats John on the back of the hand.
MAX
Would you like me to pass you the butter?
Max hands John the butter.
MISS CROSS
What's wrong with you?
MAX
(raising his voice)
What's wrong with YOU?
Max is making a scene. People all over the restaurant are watching. Max stares at Miss Cross.
MAX
You hurt my feelings. This night was important to me.
MISS CROSS
How did I hurt your feelings?
MAX
I wrote a hit play!
(pause)
And I'm in love with you.
John looks to Miss Cross. She doesn't know what to say. Max looks drunk and dejected.
MAX
How do you like that, Curly?
Max kneels on the floor in the hallway, emptying out his locker. Papers and trash are scattered all around him. There is a trashcan beside him. He is throwing away his books, one at a time.
Mr. Blume opens the door at the end of the hallway. Max looks up at him. Silence. Max looks up back to his locker and starts throwing his books in the trash again.
Mr. Blume walks over to Max. He looks very sad. He kneels down beside Max. He starts helping him pick up the trash off the floor and put it in the trashcan.
TITLE:
October.
Grover Cleveland is a public high school with two thousand five hundred students.
Max sits in a front row of a math classroom. He is dressed in his Rushmore uniform, with coat and tie, but his clothes are wrinkled and his head has been shaved like a marine's. His eyes have dark circles around them. He has a little stack of index cards in his hand.
The teacher, Mrs. Whitney, stands at the front of the room. She is about fifty with a horn-rimmed glasses and a slight English accent. She has a bemused expression on her face.
MRS WHITNEY
We have a new student with us today. His name's Max Fischer and he's actually asked to say a few words to the class. Max? You want to take it away?
MAX
(standing up)
Sure. Thanks very much. I just wanted to introduce myself.
Max looks quickly at his notecards.
MAX
I'm Max Fischer. I'm a former student of Rushmore Academy, which I recently got expelled from.
Max flips to the next notecard.
MAX
This is my first time in a public school. And I know you probably think I was born with a silverspoon in my mouth. But I'm no elitist. I think you've got some great facilities, and I'm really looking forward to making the best of it over here at Grover Cleveland.
Max sighs deeply. He rubs his eyes. His Classmates have no idea what to make of him. However, one Asian girl in the back row is smiling faintly. She has short-cropped hair. The spine of one of her book covers says Margaret Yang.
MAX
One footnote: I noticed you don't have a fencing team. I'm going to start one up. Let me know if you'd like to join. Thanks.
The wide halls of Grover Cleveland High School are lined with orange lockers. A banner stretched down the wall says 'Murder the Mustangs'. A bustling throng of high schoolers rush to class.
Max walks slowly, alone, down the middle of the hall. A blonde cheerleader-type Girl asks him:
GIRL
Why are you so dressed up?
Max looks down at his clothes. Max looks back to the girl.
MAX
Are you insane?
The girl walks off. Margaret Yang catches up to Max.
MARGARET
Max?
MAX
Yes?
MARGARET
Hi. I'm Margaret Yang. I'm in Mrs. Whitney's class. I just wanted to tell you I liked your speech. I don't think I've ever heard of anyone asking to give a speech in class before.
MAX
How unfortunate.
MARGARET
The silver spoon remark might rub some people the wrong way. But I think I know how you meant it.
MAX
Glad to hear it. Goodbye, Miss Chang.
Max ducks into the men's room. Margaret walks quietly away.
A tiny figure dressed all in white stands alone at the far end of the huge gymnasium with a fencing oil. He lunges, parries, and thrusts.
The basketball team suddenly floods dribbling into the gymnasium, throwing passes and taking free throws. Max stops fencing as they take over the room. He watches them in silence. He shakes his head. He walks off the court.
Max puts a quarter in a pay phone. He is still wearing his fencing costume.
MAX
Janet. Max Fischer. Is he in?
Mrs. Whitney watches from her classroom window at:
Max opens a red metal door on to the empty concrete courtyard. He looks left and right. He sneaks across the courtyard to the bike racks, quickly unlocks his bike, and rides away.
Max burst through a doorway followed by a little ENTOURAGE of underclassmen that includes a sophomore named WOODY. Woody has long hair and a Led-Zepplin shirt. He is carrying a clipboard.
They go down the hallway and quickly pass Margaret Yang. She is very nicely dressed in a grey turtleneck.
MARGARET
Hi, Max.
MAX
Hi.
Max keeps walking.
He stops. He turns back to Margaret Yang. He looks her up and down. She is slightly uneasy. Max looks to Woody. Woody shrugs. Max looks back to Margaret.
MAX
What was your name again?
MARGARET
Margaret Yang.
MAX
Are you free seventh period?
MARGARET
Well, I'm supposed to have guitar lessons.
MAX
(pause)
Classical?
MARGARET
Rock.
MAX
You can get out of it.
(to Woody)
put Margaret down for 3:30 in the auditorium, Woody.
Max turns away and walks briskly down the hall with his entourage. He calls back to Margaret:
MAX
And bring a headshot.
A class of Rushmore FOURTH GRADERS file past a big painting of a ship caught in a storm and disappear into the next room. One of them immediately comes back and looks around the corner. It is Dirk. He has seen something:
Miss Cross and Mr. Blume are sitting on a bench in front of a Rembrandt. They are holding hands.
Dirk narrows his eyes.
The school auditorium . Max is onstage dressed as a South Central lowrider called Little Juan. He is opposite a senior named 40 OUNCE and Margaret Yang, who plays Blue Eyes. While they are rehearsing the scene a MESSENGER comes in with an envelope for Max.
LITTLE JUAN
The killing has got to stop, esse. It's getting too loco. No more gats.
40 OUNCE
Nigger, you're the crazy one. Motherfuckers be wanting to kill you. Are you talking about getting rid of your gun?
LITTLE JUAN
It's time, homey.
BLUE EYES
Kiss me, Little Juan.
MAX
(suddenly out of character)
Then he kisses her and we're out. OK.
(pointing to the messenger)
Is that for me?
The messenger gives Max the envelope. Max opens it.
INSERT LETTER:
Written neatly in blue crayon on paper torn from a spiral notebook. Dirk reads in VOICEOVER dripping with sarcasm.
Dear Max,
I'm sorry to say that I have secretly found out that Mr. Blume is having an affair with Miss Cross. My first suspicions came when I saw them frenching at the museum, and then I knew for sure when they went skinny dipping in Mr. Blume's swimming pool, giving each other hand jobs while you were taking a nap on the front porch. Why am I telling you this now? Because you're such a good friend. Take care, pal.
Fondly,
Dirk Calloway
Miss Cross' class. A little boy named BENJAMIN reads his story in front of the class. Miss Cross sits in a chair at the back. Max appears in the doorway.
BENJAMIN
On the planet I'm from the sun only comes out once a year. That is -
Max coughs loudly. Miss Cross turns around. Max motions to her. She holds up her index finger for him to wait.
BENJAMIN
That is why my skin is the color of a cloud, said the old -
MAX
(loudly)
I just came by to thank you for wrecking my life.
Max slams the door.
Max stands alone smoking a cigarette in front of a pile of leaves. A LAWN CREW is raking in the background.
Max strikes a match, throws it on the leaves, and watches sadly as the leaves burn and smoke rises black into the crisp autumn air. He takes off his Rushmore blazer and throws it on the fire. He looks up at the sky and says quietly:
MAX
Sic transit gloria, Mr. Blume.
Sic transit gloria.
The vast lobby of the Bilby-Flickenger. Mr. Blume is leaning against the counter at the front desk. His luggage fills up two carts behind him. A faint smile plays across his lips as he stares off into space. The CONCIERGE is checking him in.
CONCIERGE
And how long will you be staying with us, Mr. Blume?
MR. BLUME
Indefinitely. I'm getting a divorce.
CONCIERGE
(typing away)
Very good, sir.
Mr. Blume yells to the BELLMAN.
MR. BLUME
Yo!
The bellman looks up. Mr. Blume waves. The bellman waves back. The concierge gives Mr. Blume his room key.
CONCIERGE
Here you are Mr. Blume. Charles will show you to your room.
MR. BLUME
Wonderful. Where's the pool, by the way? I might want to take a dip before dinner.
CONCIERGE
It's on the roof, sir.
MR. BLUME
Terrific!
Mr. Blume gets on the elevator with the bellman. The bellman looks at him and smiles.
BELLMAN
You certainly seem happy today, sir.
MR. BLUME
You bet your little ass I am, shorty. I lost my family. But I gained a woman I love.
BELLMAN
Not a bad tradeoff.
The living room of Mr. Blume's suite. Mr. Blume is dressed in a bathrobe with the Bilbly-Flickenger stitched on the pocket. He sits at his table having breakfast and reading the newspaper. There is a little basket in front of him with a jar of hone in it. A note attached to the jar says, "Enjoy your stay."
A little bug flies around Mr. Blume's head. He swats it away and keeps reading.
Two more bugs come buzzing around him. Mr. Blume looks up and frowns. They're bees. Mr. Blume slaps at his neck and jumps to his feet as he gets stung.
MR. BLUME
Shit!
Bees are circling all over the room. Mr. Blume looks around frantically. He sees something at the bottom of the front door. It is a little plastic tube with bees crawling out of it and taking off.
Max comes out of the freight elevator wearing a red room service jacket with the Bilby-Flickenger stitched on the pocket. He has a wooden box with Rushmore Beekeepers stenciled on it. Max throws the jacket in a laundry cart and goes out the back door.
The front gates of the concrete plant. Max rides up on an old grandmothers' bicycle with fenders and a handlebar basket. He's got a black duffel bag strapped to his back.
Max waves to the SECURITY GUARD. The guard waves back:
Max rides onto the lot and pulls over next to Mr. Blume's Bentley. He leans his bike against the car door. He unzips his duffel bag and slides underneath the car.
The county lock-up. Mr. Fischer watches through bulletproof glass as Max walks down a long, lonely corridor.
The door buzzes open. Max comes into the waiting room.
MAX
Thanks for bailing me out, Dad. Can you drop me off at Rushmore? I got to go settle a score.
MR. FISCHER
(hesitates)
You think that's wise, Max?
MAX
(angry)
Dad. Please. Stay out of it.
A little salon with Persian rugs. There is a fire in the fireplace and a harpsichord plays softly on the radio. Dr. Guggenheim is sitting at a little table having tea with Max.
Dr. Guggenheim has several bottles of prescription medicine in front of him and a blanket wrapped around him like a shawl. He stares at Max stonily. There is a manila envelope on the table in between them.
MAX
Did you receive the package?
Dr. Guggenheim motions to the envelope. Max nods.
MAX
Good. I just wanted to inform you about what's going on.
Dr. Guggenheim stares at Max with contempt.
DR. GUGGENHEIM
I never took you for an informer, Max.
MAX
(frowns)
What's that suppose to mean?
Silence. Max reaches out to take the envelope. Dr. Guggenheim slams his hand on it and leans across the table at Max.
DR. GUGGENHEIM
(fiercely)
She resigned this morning.
Before I even got your little snapshots. So your latest attempt at sabotage has backfired.
MAX
(pause)
But she's one of the best teachers you've got.
(yelling)
How could you let her resign?
DR. GUGGENHEIM
Why are you trying to get her fired?
MAX
You stupid old fool! I'm trying to win her back!
Dr. Guggenheim starts coughing and turning red. He knocks the envelope off the table and the pictures spill out all over the floor.
INSERT PHOTOGRAPHS ON THE FLOOR:
They're of Mr. Blume and Miss Cross kissing in the window of a Chinese restaurant.
A crew of MOVERS is rolling one of Miss Cross' aquarium out of the classroom on a dolly as Max comes to the door. Miss Cross is on the other side of the classroom taking down a map from the wall. Her books and papers are stacked in boxes.
Max watches her in silence for a minute before saying:
MAX
Miss Cross?
She turns around to look at Max. Silence.
MISS CROSS
Hi, Max.
MAX
You need any help?
MISS CROSS
No. I have it.
She pricks her finger and holds it to her mouth.
MISS CROSS
Dammit.
Max starts to go in the room to help her.
MAX
Here. Let me see.
MISS CROSS
No. Please, don't come in here. Look. I'm sorry I hurt you. I'm sorry I love your friend instead of you. But just. Please, Max.
Miss Cross has tears in her eyes. Max goes slowly toward her.
MAX
You honestly believe you love Blume instead of me?
MISS CROSS
Yes.
MAX
You'll forgive me if I won't take your word for that.
MISS CROSS
Stop. If you don't stop with that ping-pong talk, I'm going to lose it. Do you understand me?
Max takes Miss Cross' hand and kisses it. She pulls her and away. Max tries to embrace her. They struggle and Miss Cross overpowers Max. She holds his arms behind his back.
MAX
Let me go!
Max struggles some more. Miss Cross pushes him hard across the room. Max smashes into some chairs and knocks over a desk. He yells at her:
MAX
I got kicked out because of you!
MISS CROSS
You got kicked out because -
MAX
Rushmore was my life. Now you are!
MISS CROSS
That's bullshit!
Silence.
MISS CROSS
What do you really think is going to happen between us? You think we're going to have sex?
Max looks shocked.
MAX
That's kind of a cheap way to put it, don't you think?
MISS CROSS
(pause)
Not if you've never fucked before, it isn't.
MAX
(stunned)
Oh, my God.
MISS CROSS
How would you put it to your friends? Do you want to finger me? Or maybe I could give you a hand job in the back of a Jaguar. Would that put an end to all of this?
Miss Cross moves towards Max with her hand outstretched. Max retreats backwards, banging into desks and chairs. Miss Cross stops.
MISS CROSS
Please. Get out of my room.
Max walks out of the room and stands in the doorway.
Miss Cross turns away and goes back to taking down her maps from the wall. Max watches her for a minute.
Max leaves.
There is a wreath on the door and some blinking lights are strung-up. The last customer of the day comes out and walks away through the snow. Mr. Fischer is putting on his sweater while Max washes some combs and scissors in the sink.
MR. FISCHER
It's been nice having your company here at the shop, Max.
Max nods.
MR. FISCHER
Have you put anymore thought into giving school another shot?
Max shakes his head. Mr. Fischer puts on a hunting cap with earflaps and a down parka. He zips it up. Pause.
MR. FISCHER
Max, I like being a barber. I'm good at it and I enjoy it. But I always thought you'd try a different line of work.
MAX
Like what?
MR. FISCHER
I don't know. You talked about being a diplomat. Or a senator.
MAX
Pipe dreams Dad. Nothing but pipe dreams. I'm a barber's son.
Max turns on the radio and goes back into washing the combs and scissors. Mr. Fischer sighs. He puts on his gloves. He goes out the door.
Max flips the sign on the door from open to closed. He takes off his barber's jacket and hangs it on the coatrack. He goes into the back room.
He comes back into the room carrying a broom. He stops.
Dirk is sitting in one of the barber's chairs across the room. Silence. Max starts sweeping the floor.
MAX
(not looking at him)
Hello, Dirk.
DIRK
Hi, Max.
MAX
What can I do for you?
DIRK
I thought I might get a haircut.
MAX
We're closed.
Dirk nods. Max keeps sweeping.
DIRK
Well, I just wanted to tell you I'm sorry I threw rocks at you the other day.
(getting up)
But I guess I'll go now.
Dirk sets a little gift-wrapped present on the counter.
DIRK
Merry Christmas.
MAX
Max stops sweeping and looks over at Dirk.
MAX
What in the hell is that?
Dirk shrugs. Max goes over to the counter and picks up the present. He unwraps it. It is a Swiss Army Knife with an inscription on it.
INSERT SWISS ARMY KNIFE:
Max Fischer
Rushmore Yankee
1985-1997
Max looks at the knife for a minute. He says wearily:
MAX
OK. Sit down.
Dirk sits back down in the barber's chair. Max puts his white jacket back on and starts giving Dirk a haircut. There is just a sound of scissors snipping for a minute.
DIRK
Have you heard the news?
MAX
I doubt it. I don't really follow the news anymore.
DIRK
Dr. Guggenheim had a stroke.
MAX
I'll send him a box of candy.
DIRK
Maybe you ought to go visit him.
Max stops snipping. Pause.
MAX
No, thanks.
Max starts snipping again.
Max waves back to Dirk. He reaches into the cooler and takes out a bottle of Schlitz. He pops it open with the bottle opener on the Swiss Army Knife. He drinks a sip and looks out into the lightly falling snow. He says quietly to himself:
MAX
I always thought I'd be the one to give him a stroke.
Dr. Guggenheim is in his hospital bed with his eyes half-shut and a bunch of plastic tubes sticking out of him. Mrs. Guggenheim sits in a chair at the foot of the bed reading a biography on Churchill. She looks exhausted.
Max appears in the open doorway. He has a bouquet of violets in his hand. He knocks.
MAX
Mrs. Guggenheim?
Mrs. Guggenheim looks up. Her face brightens and she goes to greet Max.
MRS. GUGGENHEIM
Hello, Max. How are you?
MAX
(desolate)
Fine, thanks.
Max starts to shake hands, but Mrs. Guggenheim hugs him and kisses him on the cheek. Max is caught a little offguard by this. There is lipstick on his cheek.
MRS. GUGGENHEIM
These are glorious. Let me put them in some water. Sit down.
She takes the flowers and points to a chair beside the bed. Max sits down and stares at Dr. Guggenheim while Mrs. Guggenheim puts the violets in a vase.
MAX
Should I say hello to Dr. Guggenheim? Or can he not hear anything?
MRS. GUGGENHEIM
Oh, no. He can hear you.
MAX
OK.
(sadly)
Hello, old timer. It's Max Fischer. I was just thing about you the other day. And Rushmore. And I -
Dr. Guggenheim's eyes suddenly open. Max is taken aback. Dr. Guggenheim looks at Max suspiciously and whispers:
DR. GUGGENHEIM
What do you want?
Mrs. Guggenheim looks up quickly. Max hesitates.
MAX
I just came to pay my respects.
DR. GUGGENHEIM
(frowns)
No, you didn't. You don't respect anybody.
Dr. Guggenheim tries to spit at Max, but his mouth is too dry. Mrs. Guggenheim comes over to him.
MRS. GUGGENHEIM
Nelson?
Dr. Guggenheim mutters deliriously.
DR. GUGGENHEIM
Dammit. Goddammit.
Mrs. Guggenheim takes Dr. Guggenheim's hand and holds it. He calms down. His eyes close and he relaxes. Silence.
Mrs. Guggenheim looks to Max.
MRS. GUGGENHEIM
That's the first thing he's said in ten days.
MAX
You think he recognized me?
MRS. GUGGENHEIM
I'm not sure.
CUT TO:
Dirk hidden in the bushes across the street from the hospital. He checks his watch. He raises his binoculars to his eyes and looks on mysteriously as:
Mr. Blume pulls into the parking lot in his Bentley.
INSERT NOTEBOOK:
5:25 Fischer arrives via old woman's bicycle.
5:47 Blume arrives via black Bentley.
Max rides down in the elevator with a NURSE and a wheezing OLD WOMAN in a wheelchair. The doors open in the lobby and Max waits while the nurse wheels out the old woman.
Then he sees Mr. Blume in front of him, waiting for the elevator. He has a bouquet of carnations in one hand and a diet Coke in the other. He has a black eye under his sunglasses. He is very disheveled.
MR. BLUME
Hey, amigo.
MAX
You look horrible.
MR. BLUME
You don't look too great yourself. Good to see you.
MAX
You here to see Guggenheim?
MR. BLUME
Yeah. Your partner told me he was under the weather.
MAX
(frowns)
What partner?
Silence. Mr. Blume shrugs.
MR. BLUME
OK. If you want to play it that way. You getting off?
MAX
I'll ride up with you.
MR. BLUME
(getting on)
Suit yourself.
Mr. Blume presses the button for the 14th floor. The doors close and they go up. Mr. Blume takes out the little airline bottle of vodka and pours some into his diet Coke. He swirls it around and drinks a sip.
MAX
Who gave you the shiner?
MR. BLUME
Honestly? I don't actually know. It was either Ronny or Donny. But I can't tell the difference anymore.
MAX
Well, he really clocked you.
MR. BLUME
Yeah? Well, kids don't like their parents to get divorced.
MAX
I don't blame them.
MR. BLUME
Me, either.
Silence.
MAX
How is she?
MR. BLUME
I wouldn't know.
MAX
Why not?
MR. BLUME
Because I haven't seen her in six weeks.
MAX
(frowns)
What happened?
Mr. Blume shrugs.
MAX
She left you?
Mr. Blume nods.
MAX
How come? I thought she loved you.
MR. BLUME
So did I. I guess maybe I am too old for her after all.
MAX
(sadly)
Maybe so. Maybe so.
MR. BLUME
She's still in love with the dead guy, anyway.
MAX
You mean Edward Appleby.
MR. BLUME
Oh, yeah. She's fucked up.
Mr. Blume lights a new cigarette. Max points to Mr. Blume's first cigarette, balanced on the handrail.
MAX
You've already got one going, Mr. Blume.
Mr. Blume picks up his first cigarette and puts it in the opposite corner of his mouth from the second. He smiles at Max through the smoke. They get off to the 14th floor and the doors open.
MR. BLUME
Adios, amigo.
Max waves good-bye. But Mr. Blume does not get off the elevator. He bends over and puts his hands on his knees and takes a series of deep breaths. The door starts to close. He reaches out and holds them open. Max looks concerned.
MAX
Are you OK?
Mr. Blume looks up at Max. He laughs and shakes his head.
MR. BLUME
I'm kind of lonely these days.
Mr. Blume sighs. He gets off the elevator. The doors close behind him as Max watches him walk down the hall.
CUT TO DIRK'S BINOCULARS:
Max comes out of the hospital and stands quietly in the cold for a minute. He gets on his mother's old bicycle. He rides off down the street.
Miss Cross is sitting up in her bed reading Treasure Island and listening to the radio. She is wearing pale blue pajamas. There is a knock on her windowpane. She looks up.
She hears someone trying to open the window. She gets up and pulls open the blinds. Max is outside on the roof wearing his parka and ski cap in the falling snow. He waves.
MISS CROSS
Max!
Miss Cross opens the window.
MISS CROSS
What are you doing here?
MAX
(dazed)
I don't know. Jesus. They came at me out of no where. It was -
MISS CROSS
What?
MAX
So sudden. I just -
(pause)
I'm sorry. Can I use your phone? I just got hit by a car.
Max points down at his destroyed ten-speed in the street under a street lamp. Parts are scattered all around it.
MISS CROSS
Oh, my God. Are you OK?
MAX
(disoriented)
What?
Miss Cross notices a little cut over Max's eye. She lifts up the front of Max's ski cap. There is blood all over his forehead. She looks shocked.
MISS CROSS
Come inside.
MAX
(climbing in)
Thank you.
Max goes to Miss Cross' bed. He lies down and stares at the ceiling.
Miss Cross goes into the bathroom. She puts on a white bathrobe and gets some cotton balls and hydrogen peroxide out of the medicine cabinet.
Max looks around the room.
MAX
So this is where it all happens?
MISS CROSS
(from the bathroom)
All what happens?
MAX
I wouldn't know.
Miss Cross comes back into the bedroom.
MAX
Why'd you dump Blume?
Miss Cross stops. Pause.
MISS CROSS
That's none of your business.
MAX
I know it's not. But I'm a little confused right now. I mean. I thought you dumped me for Blume. Then I hear -
MISS CROSS
I never dumped you because we were never going out.
MAX
But it doesn't make any sense. I -
MISS CROSS
Well, I am confused, too. But why don't we just deal with getting you -
MAX
Because it would help me if you would talk to me for a minute. And tell me what happened.
Silence.
MISS CROSS
OK.
(pause)
Well. A. He's a married man.
And B. He hates himself.
I mean. He smashed your bicycle, didn't he?
MAX
(pause)
My previous bicycle. Yes.
MISS CROSS
Well, what kind of person does something like that?
MAX
I don't know.
(pause)
War does funny things to men.
Silence. Miss Cross sits down in a rocking chair beside the bed. She opens the bottle of hydrogen peroxide.
MAX
He thinks you dumped him because of Edward Appleby.
MISS CROSS
What does that mean?
MAX
I don't know. I mean. You live in this room.
Max looks around the room. There are trophies and ribbons, a chemistry set, a poster from the Olympics, three large fish tanks, a picture of Jacques Cousteau, and some model planes in dogfights hanging from the ceiling.
MAX
With all his stuff. It's kind of --
MISS CROSS
I was married to him.
MAX
(pause)
I know you were.
Silence.
MISS CROSS
Although I will say Edward has more spark and character and imagination in one fingernail than Herman Blume has in his entire body.
MAX
One dead fingernail.
Miss Cross fixes Max with a hard stare.
MISS CROSS
Right. One dead fingernail.
Silence.
MAX
How'd he die?
MISS CROSS
He drowned.
(pause)
How'd your mother die?
MAX
She got cancer.
Miss Cross nods. She sighs.
MISS CROSS
Lie still for a minute, OK?
MAX
OK.
Miss Cross pushes Max's hair back with her hand. She looks at him for a minute. She touches the blood on his forehead with a cotton ball. She stops.
MISS CROSS
Is this fake blood?
MAX
(pause)
Yes, it is.
MISS CROSS
You know, you and Herman deserve each other. You're little children. Let me show you to the door.
Max gets up and goes over to the window. He climbs out onto the roof. He looks back to Miss Cross.
MAX
That wasn't a very satisfying conversation.
Miss Cross shrugs. Silence.
MAX
All right. Goodbye, Miss Cross.
MISS CROSS
Goodbye, Max.
Max disappears into the darkness.
Mr. Blume follows Max into the barbershop. Mr. Fischer looks up from his newspaper.
MR. FISCHER
Well, looks what the cat dragged in.
MAX
Sorry, I'm late. I want you to meet somebody.
(looks to Mr. Blume)
Mr. Blume, this is my father, Bert Fischer.
Silence. Mr. Blume nods slowly.
MR. BLUME
Nice to meet you, Mr. Fischer.
MR. FISCHER
(smiles)
Mr. Fischer's my father's name. Call me Bert.
MR. BLUME
(pause)
OK, Bert.
MR. FISCHER
Max tells me you could use a haircut.
Mr. Blume hesitates.
MR. FISCHER
Let's have a look at you.
Mr. Blume sits down in one of the barber's chairs and looks in the mirror. Max and Mr. Fischer stand on either side of him. Mr. Blume looks terrible. He sighs deeply.
MR. BLUME
I don't know, Bert.
MR. FISCHER
Don't worry. We might have to throw in a shave, too. Max? Why don't you get Mr. Blume a cup of coffee?
Max stands at the counter in a huge construction supply warehouse. A SALESMAN says:
SALESMAN
Fifteen sticks?
MAX
Yes, please. And make the order out to Ready Demolition, Tuscon.
Max holds up a driver's license. The salesman looks at it and writes something on a clipboard. Max walks out of the warehouse with several large boxes over his shoulder. The boxes say DYNAMITE on them in large red letters.
The school auditorium.
We see many familiar faces in the audience: Mr. Fischer, Dr. Guggenheim in his wheelchair, Mrs. Guggenheim, Mrs. Calloway, Mrs. Whitney, the Indian groundskeeper, the yearbook photographer, Coach Beck, Ernie, Mr. Holstead, Mr. Adams, the police who arrested Max, some old men from the barbershop. They are all dressed nicely in evening clothes.
Miss Cross' friend John, whom Max humiliated at dinner after the Serpico play, is seated in the third row. He is dressed in a coat and tie.
An USHER directs Miss cross to her seat. She is surprised to see that it is right nest to Mr. Blume's. She reluctantly sits down beside him. Mr. Blume sees her.
MISS CROSS
Hi, Herman.
Mr. Blume nods. He pulls his ticket out of his inside pocket and checks the seat number. He looks to Miss Cross. Miss Cross smiles.
MISS CROSS
Looks like Max pulled a fast one on us.
Mr. Blume nods.
MISS CROSS
How's your aquarium coming along?
MR. BLUME
Not too bad. It should be finished in October.
Miss Cross nods.
MR. BLUME
I just made a deal with a guy in Singapore for half a dozen electric eels.
MISS CROSS
That sounds good.
The lights go down. A spotlight appears and Max walks onstage in a tuxedo. He goes to a microphone in the middle of the stage.
MAX
I don't usually do this, but this play means a lot to me, and I wanted to make a dedication. So I'll just say that this play is dedicated to the memory of my mother, Eloise Fischer. And to Edward Appleby. A friend of a friend.
Neither Mr. Fischer nor Miss Cross were expecting this announcement, and they are moved by it.
MAX
Also you'll find a pair of safety glasses and some earplugs underneath your seats. Please feel free to use them. Thank you very much.
Max exits the stage and the audience applauds. There is a moment of rustling and whispering in the dark theater.
The curtain opens on:
Vietnam. Napalm smolders in the sky above the jungle.
Dirk runs onstage dressed in a Green Beret uniform and sunglasses. He has an M-16. He yells to Max as Max shimmies down out of a palm tree:
DIRK
Let's rock, Esposito!
MAX
Lock and load, Surf Boy!
There is an explosion and Max and Dirk run through the smoke. Suddenly the stage is swarmed by VC regulars. Everyone starts shooting at once.
Bursts of gunfire light-up the audience's faces and smoke floats over their heads as we hear the sounds of jets flying over, bombs exploding, choppers taking off, and a SOLDIER'S voice screaming into his radio:
SOLDIER
Mayday! Mayday! Seven niner Almighty! Adjust your coordinates!
Some members of the audience put on their safety glasses and earplugs. Woody stands nervously in the wings with a fire extinguisher.
One of the extras accidentally clubs Max in the temple with the butt of his rifle. Max's eyes close. He crumples to the floor. The fighting stops. The audience begins to murmur.
Max opens his eyes. He sees the frightened soldiers looking down at him.
He grabs his M-16 and opens fire. The battle resumes.
INSERT SIGN WRITTEN IN CALLIGRAPHY:
Intermission.
The sign is leaning on an easel in front of the curtain. Little roses and tulips are painted around its edges.
Actors run around frantically backstage. Max has a band-aid on his forehead. He is touching-up a gory makeup effect over Dirk's eye. He turns to Woody.
MAX
How much time we got, Wood?
WODDY
(checks his watch)
Two minutes.
MAX
Bring me some more ketchup.
(points to the band-aid on his head)
And make this look real.
Max and Magnus Buchan, with a three-day beard and a cigar, stand together among the fallen bodies and smoldering trees.
MAX
I want you to have something, Sarge.
Max hands Magnus Mr. Blume's silver .45 automatic.
MAX
I won't be needing this anymore.
MAGNUS
Semper fi, Esposito. Semper fi.
MAX
Sic transit gloria, sir.
Max looks out to Mr. Blume. Mr. Blume looks back at him.
MAX
Say a prayer for Surf Boy. Wherever he is.
MAGNUS
Good luck, soldier.
Magnus salutes Max and walks off. We hear his voice as he goes into the wings:
MAGNUS
Tag 'em and bag 'em, cherries! We're moving out! Let's DD!
Max throws down his rifle into a foxhole and begins to cry quietly. Someone moves slowly toward him out of the settling smoke. Max wheels around and whips out his Swiss Army knife.
But then he sees it is Margaret Yang as a Vietnamese villager. She has been through hell.
MARGARET
Hello, Esposito.
Max drops his knife and it stabs into the floor. He puts out his hand. Margaret takes it. He pulls her in and hugs her.
Miss Cross smiles sadly.
Max looks into Margaret Yang's eyes.
MAX
Will you marry me, Le-Chahn?
MARGARET
(instantly)
You bet I will.
Wagner's Flight of the Walkyries begins to play loudly from behind the stage as Max kisses Margaret and the curtain drops to wild applause.
Mrs. Guggenheim looks on in amazement as Dr. Guggenheim stands up out of his wheelchair and leads the ovation. The rest of the audience quickly follows suit.
The Indian groundskeeper is laughing hysterically.
The gymnasium has been filled with palm trees and decorated like an Army barracks. Flares burn in circles around the tables. A banner at the entrance says The Heaven and Hell Cotillion.
Dirk and a couple of his CLASSMATES are looking at some vintage Playboy centerfolds taped-up on the wall as part of the Army barracks motif.
Miss Cross and John are talking at the punchbowl.
MISS CROSS
Max sent you an invitation?
JOHN
Yeah. And he told me to wear a tie.
Max and Margaret are drinking ginger ales and chatting with Mr. Fischer and MR. and MRS. YANG.
MAX
Thank you, Mrs. Yang. I actually wrote a different version of the play two years ago. But I couldn't get it done over at Rushmore.
MRS. YANG
Why? Too political?
MAX
No. A kid got his finger blown off during rehearsals.
Max sees Mr. Blume and Miss Cross approaching.
MAX
Miss Cross, this is my father Bert Fischer. He's a barber.
(to Mr. Fischer)
This is my friend Rosemary Cross.
Mr. Fischer smiles as they shake hands.
MR. FISCHER
Hi, Rosemary.
MISS CROSS
Nice to finally meet you, Bert.
MAX
And, of course, you know Mr. Blume. I also want everyone to meet Mr. and Mrs. Yang. And this is Margaret.
Miss Cross and Margaret smile at each other.
MISS CROSS
Hello, Margaret.
MARGARET
Hello, Miss Cross.
The Indian groundskeeper is talking with Coach Beck and Mr. Blume's foreman, Ernie.
COACH BECK
I'm surprised they let him build a real campfire onstage. That's a safety hazard.
ERNIE
Well, last year he tried to raise piranhas.
COACH BECK
What'd you think of the play, Mr. Littlejeans?
GROUNDSKEEPER
Best play all year, man.
Mr. Blume, Magnus Buchan, and the Rushmore yearbook photographer are having a conversation.
MAGNUS
Well, Fischer stepped on half of my bleedin' lines.
MR. BLUME
Really? I didn't notice.
PHOTOGRAPHER
Are Ronny and Donny having a good time at military school?
MR. BLUME
(instantly)
They love it.
MAGNUS
Lucky bastards.
Mr. Fischer is talking with John.
JOHN
I understand you're a neurosurgeon.
MR. FISCHER
No. I'm a barber. But a lot of people make that mistake.
Mr. Fischer laughs.
Dirk and Dr. Guggenheim watch Max laughing and dancing with Margaret Yang. Max points to Dr. Guggenheim. Dr. Guggenheim smiles and points back to him. He says in a hoarse whisper:
DR. GUGGENHEIM
Who's the Chinaman with Fisher?
DIRK
That's Margaret Yang. She's actually Korean.
DR. GUGGENHEIM
(pleasantly surprised)
I know the Koreans. They're good people.
Max and Margaret are talking as they dance:
MAX
You were incredible tonight, Margaret. You were that poor girl.
MARGARET
Thank you. I loved it when you grabbed onto the bottom of the chopper as it was taking off.
MAX
That was totally improvised.
Margaret nods. They look at each other smiling.
MAX
Can I ask you a question?
MARGARET
Of course.
MAX
Can you do an Australian accent?
Margaret looks puzzled. Max smiles.
MAX
I'm working on something that's set in the outback.
Mr. Fischer is sitting at a table having a glass of champagne with Max's math teacher, Mrs. Whitney. She has a slight English accent. Mr. Fischer wears a sky blue blazer.
MR. FISCHER
That's a beautiful dress, by the way.
MRS. WHITNEY
Why, thank you, Bert. That sportscoat is rather smashing in its own right.
MR. FISCHER
I know it's a little loud. But I feel like celebrating.
MRS. WHITNEY
Would you care to dance?
MR. FISCHER
(surprised)
I'd love to.
Mr. Blume brings Miss Cross a glass of champagne as Max and Margaret dance by.
MARGARET
Hello, Mr. Blume!
MR. BLUME
Hi, Margaret!
(to Max)
May I cut in? I haven't had a change to cut a rug with your new girlfriend yet.
MAX
(embarrassed)
New girlfriend.
MARGARET
Yes, I am. And find your own partner, Mr. Blume. No offense, but I'm spoken for.
MAX
No, it's OK. He's my friend.
Margaret and Mr. Blume dance off together. Max and Miss Cross are left alone.
MISS CROSS
Well, you pulled it off.
MAX
(shrugs)
It went OK. At least nobody got hurt.
MISS CROSS
Except for you.
MAX
(smiles sadly)
Nah. I didn't get hurt that bad.
Max looks to Miss Cross. Miss Cross sips her champagne. She looks back at Max for a minute. She smiles. Mr. Fischer calls out to them as he dances by with Mrs. Whitney:
MR. FISHCER
Come on, you two! Shake a leg!
They wave to Mr. Fischer. Miss Cross looks to Max.
MISS CROSS
You want to dance?
MAX
Certainly. But let's see if we can get the DJ to play something with a lithe ---
Max snaps his fingers. He turns to the DJ and yells:
MAX
Rueben!
The DJ looks to Max. Max makes a little gesture that seems to say, This is the one. The DJ nods.
The music cuts off in the middle of the song. Everyone stops dancing. They look around wondering what's going on.
A new song starts up. It is the saddest song of the night.
Max looks to Miss Cross. Miss Cross puts out her hand. Max takes it and walks with her onto the dance floor, into the crowd, as everyone slowly begins to dance.
