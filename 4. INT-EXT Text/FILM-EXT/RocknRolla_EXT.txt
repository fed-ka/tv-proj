Bob jumps out of his truck and runs down to the second getaway
car waiting. We SEE One Two and Mumbles get out of their
car and run over to the Range Rover on its side, they are
carrying an axe and bolt cutters. Inside, CHECHNYAN 2 slowly
opens his dazed eyes, to SEE an axe chopping through the
window. TWO CHOPS and the window gives in. One Two leans
in and grabs the case, but it's chained to CHECHNYAN 2's
wrist. One Two pulls the arm out of the window and Mumbles
uses massive bolt cutters to cut the case free.

There's another case, grab it.
One Two leans in and grabs the second case from Chechnyan 1.
As he is about to chop this one loose, he is pulled into the

Major confusion is setting in. They run back to their car,

and jumps in the drivers seat.

Go, go, go, go!!!!!!
With his window open, Mumbles wheel spins out of the situation
and turns to check on One Two. From out of nowhere a very
large CHECHNYAN arm shoots through the window and puts Mumbles
in a neck lock. The CHECHNYAN 2 is holding on and not letting
go.

has a mezzanine. The car comes to a halt on a precarious

The pair of them are bleeding profusely, they're bashed to a

on and on. CHECHNYAN 2 has ripped off his jacket, we can
see his massive scar covered torso dripping in blood and
sweat, he seems unstoppable. One Two gets confident and
starts to run backwards egging CHECHNYAN 2 on, CHECHNYAN 2
is a good runner, but not good enough. Deep hate fills his
eyes as One Two makes a fool out of him, CHECHNYAN 2 will
remember this man. One Two is taking complete liberties, he
almost stops and waits until CHECHNYAN 2 has caught up to
him and then he tears off, the CHECHNYAN keeps coming.
One Two see's in the distance a tiny moped approaching from
a distance, its CHECHNYAN 1 who completely out sizes the
machine. However, he's moving and it's moving faster than
One Two. One Two ducks off the tracks and over a wall, the
moped gets nearer. At least when he gets over the wall, the
moped won't follow right? One Two's over. He can hear the
moped on the other side, One Two looks over his shoulder he
can see the moped being lifted over the wall. "Oh shit."
This is where One Two's "zone" comes into play. He drifts
in to a place that he can not be disturbed and he runs and
runs and runs. Up, down, through and in.
