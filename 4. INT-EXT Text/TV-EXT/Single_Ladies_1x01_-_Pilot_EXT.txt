      An establishing shot of Buckhead, an uptown district within 
      Atlanta, Georgia.  The jewel of the city.  The shopping  
      mecca.  Where old money lives and new money parties.


      It s dark inside but the streetlights illuminate the interior 
      of a business that has closed down.  However, the large 
      windows post signs of hope:  OPENING SOON - VAL S BOUTIQUE.  

                                  DARRYL (O.C.)
                    Pardon me.  But someone needs to 
                    explain the difference between one  
                    man saying  when I get that feeling 
                    I want sexual healing  and another  
                    one saying  I wanna lick lick lick 
                    lick you from your head to your 
                    toes then move from the bed down to  
                    the floor.  

      The CAMERA PANS UP, taking us to a sophisticated, spacious 
      TWO-BEDROOM APARTMENT that sits directly above the empty 
      store and STOPS at a bay window.  Inside, we see SEVERAL  
      FRIENDS drinking, laughing, having a good time.      


                                  QUINN 
                    Val, don t do this right now. 

                                  VAL
                    Don t do what?  Wonder about my 
                    future or where this is going?

                                  QUINN
                    Where it s going?  Live in the 
                    present.  We re still together 
                    aren t we?  

                                  VAL
                    Yeah, but after five years I would 
                    think you d want to take it to the 
                    next level.  I m so tired of making 
                    up excuses to my parents - and 
                    everyone else for that matter - as 
                    to why I m not married yet.  It s 
                      embarrassing, like right now.

                                  QUINN
                    Damn embarrassment.  Why do you 
                    keep trying to fix something that s 
                    not broken?  We re good.  You re 
                    career is poppin .  Ain t that a 
                    reason to be happy?  

                                  VAL
                    Yeah, but I didn t give up styling 
                      full-time, hand off all of my A-
                    list clients and take out loans to 
                    open up the store just for me.  I 
                    made that choice for both of us.

                                  QUINN
                    Key words:  You made that choice.  
                    You were living out of hotels and 
                    always on a world tour with Usher 
                    or Beyonce or somebody.  I just 
                    suggested you open up your own spot 
                    right here at home so you could be 
                    more stable.  You agreed.  

                                  VAL
                      I compromised.  My traveling 
                    bothered you, not me.  Remember?  
                    You wanted me home when you weren t 
                    on the road, next to you every 
                    night.  You know, like a wife.

                                    VAL(CONT'D)

                    I assumed being more stable meant 
                    marriage.  You re unbelievable. 

                                  QUINN 
                    Are you done making a scene?

                                  VAL 
                          (sudden epiphany)
                    Oh my God.  Wow... Wow. 

                                  QUINN
                    Wow what, Val?

                                  VAL
                    I am such a fool.  I don t know how 
                    it took me this long to realize it.  

                                  QUINN
                    Here we go with the dramatics.  
                    Can t we just have a good time?

      The balcony doors are open so everyone hears Val and Quinn.

                                  VAL
                    Just have a good time, Val.  Just 
                    go with the flow, Val.  If it ain t 
                    broke don t fix it, Val.  You 
                    always have an answer for me but 
                    it s  never the right one.

                                  QUINN
                    Look, if you ain t happy then --

      He stops himself.

                                  VAL
                    Then what?

                                  QUINN
                          (you asked for it)
                    Then leave, go.  I m not holding 
                    you prisoner.  You re a grown ass 
                    woman.  

                                  VAL 
                    That would let you off the hook, 
                    wouldn t it?  Then it would be all 
                    on me.  I don t think so.  But I ll 
                    tell you what.  How about I throw 
                    you the ball and you can choose to 
                    run with it or drop it.   

                                  QUINN
                    What are you talking about now?

                                  VAL
                    I m saying if you like it then put 
                    a ring on it.  If not, let s stop 
                    wasting each other s time.  Life is 
                    too short.

                                  QUINN
                    You re seriously giving me an 
                      ultimatum?  Right here, right now?

      Val hadn t planned to, but the train was moving so she got on 
      it.  Now they have everyone s full attention.

                                  VAL
                            (unconvincingly bold)
                    Yeah.  Right here, right now.

                                  KEISHA
                    Okay, guys.  Let s not get stupid.  
                    We ve all had a lot to drink and 
                    we re not thinking clearly.  

                                  APRIL
                    Yeah, let s all say good night so 
                    these two can work it out.

                                  DARRYL
                    Yeah, you guys just need to calm 
                    down before this gets blown even 
                    more out of proportion.

      They all begin to gather their things.

                                  QUINN
                    You guys can stay here.  I m out.

      Quinn WALKS BACK INSIDE, to the front door. 

                                  DARRYL
                    Come on, man.  Think.  Don t do 
                    something you might regret.  

      Quinn STOPS with his hand on the doorknob then turns to Val.  

                                  QUINN
                    Too late.

      He WALKS OUT.  Everyone is stunned into silence.  

                                  KEISHA
                    Okay, what the hell just happened?

                                  VAL
                          (feigning dignity)
                    I just became a single woman.

      Another few beats of silence as it all sinks in.  

                                  WOODY
                    Damn... I guess he didn t like it.

      The FRONT DOOR OPENS; it s Quinn.  A wave of relief goes over 
      everyone, especially Val, but she plays it cool.  Quinn HEADS 
      TOWARD Val but stops when he reaches a table where he left 
      his  KEYS.  He turns and LEAVES again - this time for good.  

                                  KEISHA
                    You okay, Val?

                                  VAL
                    I d say I m pretty freakin  far 
                    from okay.  

                                  KEISHA
                    Is there anything we can do?

                                  VAL 
                    Not right now.  I just really need 
                    to be alone. 

      Val gets her purse and walks out.  April moves to follow her 
      but Keisha pulls her back, respecting Val s request.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                        ACT TWO

                                                                            FADE IN:


      Val s Grand Opening party is packed.  Celebs like Jermaine 
      Dupri, Janet Jackson, Outkast and players from the Atlanta 
      Hawks and the Atlanta Falcons can be spotted. 

                                  OMAR
                    Where s Val?

                                  KEISHA
                    She and Quinn talked last night.  
                    Haven t seen or heard from her 
                    since.   
                          (noticing outside)
                    Is that her? 

                                  OMAR
                    Guess the talk went well.

      Confused, Keisha moves through crowd, heads outside.


      Val stands next to her BRAND NEW 2010 JAGUAR eyeing it 
      proudly.  Keisha joins her and circles the car.

                                  KEISHA
                    Damn.  Did Quinn buy you back?

                                  VAL
                    As if.  But he did inspire me to go 
                    out and buy it for myself.  

      April and Darryl walk up to join Keisha and Val.

                                  APRIL
                    Hey, sorry we re late.  How come 
                    you guys aren t inside?

                                  DARRYL
                    Whoa.  Who s new whip?  Nice.

                                  VAL
                          (jingling her keys)
                    Guilty.  

                                  APRIL
                    How the hell can you afford this?

                                  DARRYL
                    I m going to go inside and let you 
                    three talk.  See you in a minute.  

      Darryl kisses April then goes inside to join the party.  
      Keisha and April stare at Val expectantly. 

                                  VAL
                    Okay, so, what had happened was... 

                                  APRIL
                    You had it out with Quinn and went 
                    on an emotional spending spree.

                                  KEISHA
                    Then some slick salesguy preyed on 
                    your vulnerability and got a big 
                    ass commission off of it.

                                  VAL
                    Can I tell my own story please?

      They shut up.

                                  VAL (CONT D)
                    Okay, you re both right.  But when 
                    I woke up this morning I had 
                    already decided I would no longer 
                    settle for that old car I ve been 
                    tired of driving for years and that 
                    I never really loved.  No one 
                    should ever settle for anything 
                    that doesn t make them feel good or 
 whole or valuable.

      A moment while they glean wisdom from their friend.

                                  KEISHA
                    Can you afford this mug?

                                  VAL
                    No, and I ll probably take it back 
                    tomorrow.  But right now, I feel 
                    great.  And I m more determined 
                    than ever to make this store a 
                    success and reinvent myself!

                                  APRIL
                    That sounds good, but something s 
                    up.  What s the real deal?

                    Yeah, we know you too well.  When 
                      something s wrong, you go to the 
                    extreme to pretend it s all good.

                          (snapping)
                    It s nothing, okay?  Can we just 
                    please drop it and go inside?

      Keisha and April give each other a look and drop it.

                    Hey, is that Mayor Howard?  I heard 
                    he was a real cool, down-to-earth 
                    dude.  Guess it s true.  

                                  VAL
                    And he s even cuter in person.  
                    That his wife?

                                  APRIL
                    Yep, that s her.

      The Mayor of Atlanta, TREVOR HOWARD, 41, HANDSOME, a Cory 
      Booker type, holds hands with his WIFE, early 40 s.  He 
      politely waves hello, goes inside.  They wave back, smitten. 

                                  KEISHA 
                    He could get it.

                                  VAL
                    Mmph.  Yes he could.

                                  APRIL
                    He is gettin  it.  All of it.

      They head toward the entrance.  Wait for it... 
                          VALKEISHA
      Girl no!Stop!  You re doing Mayor 
                                                    Howard?!


                                  APRIL (CONT D)
                    You wanna get on the mic next time?  
                    I don t think everyone heard you.

      April heads nervously inside.  They follow, in shock.

                                                                          FADE OUT.
