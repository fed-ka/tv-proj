        NANCY still stands in front of the mirror, staring at the DEA 
        jacket.  She snaps back to reality.  Shit.  And she s on the 
      move to his dresser.  She finds his wallet and sees the badge 
        inside.  She finds his gun, still holstered.  She pulls it 
        out and examines it like the scary foreign object it is to 
      her.  She carries it into the bathroom and sits on the 
        toilet, holding the gun.  She pees as she examines the 
        weapon.  She hears a voice from the other room.   

                                    PETER (O.S.)
                      Nancy?

                                    NANCY
                      Just a minute.

        She hastily wipes, then puts the gun away on the way back to 
        the bedroom.  She realizes she s still wearing the jacket.  
        She takes it off and leaves it in the hallway.  PETER smiles 
      when he sees naked Nancy standing before him.  

                                    PETER 
                      You are so beautiful.  Come here.

      He holds out his arms to her and she falls back into bed with 
      him.  He kisses her, he disappears under the covers.  
        Pleasure and fear wrestle on her face.

                                                                              CUT TO:


        SHANE is in the doorway to Nancy s room.  

                                    SHANE
                      Mom?

        Her bed is still made.  No one is there.  Shane continues 
      down the hall.

      He passes Andy s room where ANDY snores loudly atop his 
        covers, clad in only boxers and a t-shirt, clutching a copy 
      of  Rejuvenile  by Christopher Noxon!

      We hear soft moans.  Shane continues down the hall and the 
        sounds of sex grow louder.  He s outside Silas s door.  He 
        tries the knob and lets the door swing wide.  We see MEGAN 
        and SILAS making love on the bed.  Megan s back is to Shane, 
        but for a brief moment, Silas and Shane make eye contact.  
        Silas is furious.

        Shane quickly runs away, back down the hall, back into his 
        mother s room where he turns down the covers and gets into 
        her bed, hugging her pillow and clicking off the light.

                                                                              CUT TO:          WEEDS #2001    "Corn Snake"     5th Rev (GOLDENROD)   5/26/06 6pm     2




        Nancy is mostly dressed and searching the room.  She looks 
        under the bed.  Peter sits up and addresses her backside.

                                    PETER
                      Checking for monsters?

                      What?  Oh.  No.  I can t find my 
                      shoe.  Sandal.  It s a sandal.

                      So I m guessing no breakfast.

                                    NANCY
                      No.  I m not really a breakfast 
                      person.  I have to have coffee in 
                      the morning, but after that, I m 
                      good  til lunch.  Usually.  
                      Sometimes I have a bagel around ten-

                      My feet used to be smaller, but I 
                      went up a size with each kid.

                      It s just sitting there on your

        Peter gets out of bed and walks up to her.  He s naked.

      He grabs a shirt from nearby and ties it around his waist.

                                    PETER
                      I want a kiss goodbye.  Otherwise, 
                      I ll feel cheap and used.

        She kisses him.  He kisses her.  They kiss.

        Isabel rummages through a grocery bag that s sitting next to 
      her.  She pulls out a bag of peanut butter-filled pretzels.

        Celia reaches back to grab the bag and her foot slips off the

      gets out of the car.

                      Jew, I couldn t go to Rabbinical 
                      school?  I can go if I m gay and my 
                      lover is Jewish.  I can go if I m 
                      single, but I m not eligible if I

                      all American Jews marry outside the 
                      tribe.  Clearly there s a problem, 
                      and yet when a Jewish person is 
                      interested in pursuing his or her 
                      religious calling, if he or she 
                      fell in love with someone outside 
                      the faith, and lord knows, we don t

                      and I don t need to defend my 
                      actions to my teenaged child.

                      I got scared.

                      Oh, honey.  You were asleep.

                      I woke up.

                      I m sorry, sweetie.  I didn t mean 
                      to make you nervous.  I was just at 
                      a friend s house.

        Nancy finishes her coffee and goes to put the cup in the 
        dishwasher.  Silas stops her.

                      Maybe if you spent a little more 
                      time around here you d know that. 

        LUPITA enters.  The boys rummage cabinets and fridge for 
        breakfast.

                                    NANCY
                      Lupita, could you do the dishes,

                      The machine is broken.

                                    NANCY

                      Makes my hands crack.  You need to

                                    NANCY
                      Maybe I need a new housekeeper.

                                    LUPITA
                      Maybe you have too much love and 
                      TRUST for me to ever let me go.

        Lupita pours herself a cup of coffee and takes a big whiff.

      Andy sits opposite a young, hot, Israeli admissions director, 
      YAEL HOFFMAN.  Yael is wearing a semi-sheer blouse with a

      Yael crosses her arms and assesses him.  Andy feels obligated 
      to fill the silence.

                      amusing.  I wish you all the best

                      Rabbinic trait.

      Yael gets up.

                      time.  I guess I ll just have to 
                      find another Rabbinical school.  
                      One that recognizes my talent.  One 
                      that respects my ambition.

                      Yes.  Our loss.  Good luck to you.

      Yael closes the door behind him and goes back to her desk.  
        The door bursts open.  Andy drops to his knees.

                      I m begging you.  This is the end

                      Are you walking out because I 
                      fucked a DEA agent or because I 
                      fucked someone else?

                      Wow.  This ain t about your 
                      arrogant white ass.  Let me tell

        Conrad gets past her and exits into the bakery, letting the 
        screen slam.  Nancy sits down heavily.  She tries to sip the 
      iced latte dregs in her cup.  Sanjay walks out.

                                    SANJAY

        Celia stands at a mic before the COUNCIL in a large, sparsely 
        populated civic room, demanding justice.  DOUG is making 
        paper footballs out of scrap paper and flicking them all over 
        the room.

                      how and you have ignored all of my 
                      requests, but that does not change 
                      the fact that there needs to be a 
                      light at that intersection!  It s a 
                      matter of public safety.

                      Celia, lights cost money.

                      pigs in a blanket are bullshit.  

        The meeting breaks up.  Doug flicks a paper football and it 
      hits Celia right between her new boobs.

                      Ooh.  Sorry, Celia.  Although I do 
                      think that counts as a touchdown.

        Off on Celia seething.

                                                                              CUT TO:


        Nancy is sitting, nursing her eighteenth coffee of the day 
        and flipping through a magazine.  Celia approaches.

                      Celia!  

        Celia sits down across from Nancy, puts down her coffee,   
        Picks up the edge of the magazine to see what it is.

                                    CELIA
                      I read that.  There s a great 
                      article on injecting human growth 
                      hormone to stay young.  But they 
                      never say where they re getting it 
                      from.  Makes you wonder if they re 
                      sucking the youth out of small 
                      brown children somewhere so actors 
                      and trophy wives can stay in

        Celia and PAM sit in the family room.  The coffee table is

        piled in the sink.  Andy is at the table, writing in a 
        notebook.  Shane is playing video games with headphones on.  
        Nancy puts down her bags and kisses Shane on the head.  He 
        doesn t take his eyes off the screen.  She pulls one 
        headphone out.

                      He was going to come today, but I 
                      was out and Lupita had a hair 
                        appointment, so he ll be here 
                      tomorrow.  What s in the bags?

        Nancy starts unpacking boxes and containers.

                      I ve got work to do, Nance.  This 
                      is my last chance to get into 
                      seminary and the admissions chick 
                      is smoking hot.  Plus if I don t 
                      get in I ll be sent to Iraq.

                                    NANCY
                      Glad to see your priorities in 
                      order.  Now clear your crap off the 
                      table.  Where s Silas?

        Silas has entered from the stairs.

                                    SILAS
                      I m here.  I told Megan I d have 
                      dinner at her place.

                                    NANCY
                      Well, call her and tell her not 
                      tonight.

                      I made plans.

                                    NANCY
                      Well, I bought chicken.  And you 
                      are my son and you re going to sit 
                      down and we re all going to eat.  
                      So call her.

        Nancy holds the phone out to Silas.  He doesn t take it.

        Silas tries to walk around her.  She blocks him.  

                                    NANCY (cont'd)
                      We are having family dinner.  

        She steps closer to him.

                      You are a member of this family.  

        Another step closer.  He backs up.  She steps, he backs up.  
      He s at the wall.  She s right in his face.

        She presses the phone into Silas and lets go.  He doesn t 
      take it.  It falls to the floor.  She kicks it across the 
        room.  Andy hastily gathers his things off the table.  She 
        walks over to Shane and pulls off his headphones.  

                                    NANCY (cont'd)
                      Game over!  Wash your hands.  Andy,

                      Shut up.

        Everyone settles down at the table.  Paper plates are 
        dispersed.  Food is doled out.  Nancy is calming down.

                                                                              CUT TO:          WEEDS #2001    "Corn Snake"     5th Rev (GOLDENROD)   5/26/06 6pm     30

                      I m writing about what being a Jew 
                      means to me.  If I write well, I ll 
                      be allowed to attend rabbinical 
                      school and if I don t, I m going to 
                      be shipped overseas to die.  So far 
                      I ve written,  Being a Jew means I 
                      have no foreskin and I may be a Tay 
                      Sachs carrier.   So, I think I m 
                      going to die.

                      What s Tay Sachs?

                                    ANDY
                      It s a fatal genetic lipid storage 
                      disorder prevalent in European 
                      Jews, but you don t have to worry 
                      because your mother isn t Jewish 
                      and if you had it, you d already be 
                      dead.

                      Nancy, nothing s going to happen to

                      You don t know that.  You deal with

                      I ve been hurt too, but I m willing 
                      to take the risk with you.  I 
                      think...  I have very strong 
                      feelings for you and... what I do 
                      is mostly a desk job, Nancy--

                      You carry a gun.  I can t.  I just.

        Nancy hangs up.  

        End Cross Cut.

        She takes a moment.  She feels sad.  She looks over at the 
        flowers he sent her which are now sitting on her night table.  
        She re-reads the card.  She tucks it into her drawer.

        Then, she takes a deep breath, and picks up a stack of 
        papers.  We see it s an insurance claim form.  She starts 
        filling it out.  She starts to hum,  There s no business like 
      show (grow) business. 

      FADE OUT.
