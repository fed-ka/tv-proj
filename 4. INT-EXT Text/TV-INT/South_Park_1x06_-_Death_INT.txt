               Stan's Family (Father, sister and Grandfather) are seated at 
               a table. Mother walks up holding a birthday cake with a 
               ridiculous number of number of candles.

                                     STAN & FAMILY
                         Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday 
                         to you! Happy birthday dear grandpa!

               Grandpa drools a little from his wheelchair.

                                     STAN & FAMILY
                         Happy birthday to you!

                                     STAN'S MOTHER
                         Now blow out the candles grandpa!

               Grandpa manages the smallest wheeze, which doesn't even make 
               the flames of the candles flicker.

               Stan's family members all applaud.

                                     STAN'S FATHER
                         How does it feel to be a hundred and 
                         two, paps?

                                     GRANDPA
                         Shoot me.

                                     STAN'S MOM
                         Make a wish grandpa!

                                     GRANDPA
                         I wish I were dead.

                                     FATHER
                         Ha, ha! That's our silly grandpa!

                                     GRANDPA
                         I'm not being silly! Kill me! I'd do 
                         it myself, but I'm too damn old!

                                     STAN'S MOM
                         Oh, who wants ice cream with their 
                         cake?

                                     STAN
                         I will.

                                     FATHER
                         Me.

               Stan looks up and the clock and gasps.

                                     STAN
                         It's eight o'clock! My favorite T.V. 
                         show is on!

                         stupid!

                                     STAN
                         Can I eat my cake in the living room, 
                         mom? Please? Can I?

                                     STAN'S MOM
                         Oh, alright. But take your grandpy 
                         with you.

                                     STAN
                         Aw, dammit.

                         Language!


               Stan is sitting on the couch watching television and eating 
               cake.

                         And now back to Terrance and Phillip!

               ANGLE - TELEVISION

               Two average looking teens (animated in a slightly different 
               style) are sitting on a couch.

                                     PHILLIP
                         Hey Terrance, I think I have to fart.

               Stan laughs.

                                     TERRANCE
                         Wait! before you do, Pull my thumb.

               Phillip pulls Terrance's thumb. Terrance FARTS loudly.

               The laugh track laughs. Stan laughs.

               PAN OVER to reveal grandpa, who is trying to point a shotgun 
               at his head.

               Grandpa pulls the trigger -- BLAM!! He misses, blowing a 
               picture of the wall.

                                     GRANDPA
                         Aw Dammit!!

               Grandpa looks at Stan.

                                     GRANDPA
                         How would you like to make a dollar, 
                         Billy?

                                     STAN
                         My name's not Billy, grandpa, it's 
                         Stan.

                                     GRANDPA
                         Dammit, Billy! Do you want a dollar 
                         or don't ya?!

                                     STAN
                         Sure.

                                     GRANDPA
                         Okay, you just have to do one thing 
                         for me...

                         I'm not going to kill you, grandpa.

                                     GRANDPA
                         WHY NOT?!

                         'Cause! I'll get in trouble!

                                     GRANDPA
                         I killed my grandpa when I was your 
                         age!

                                     STAN
                         Leave me alone, grandpa.

                                     GRANDPA
                         What has America's youth come to?! 
                         Kids won't even kill their own 
                         grandparents!!


               Kyle is sitting in front of the T.V. watching the same T.V. 
               show.

               ANGLE - TELEVISION

                                     PHILLIP
                         Hey Terrance, now that you've farted, 
                         I think I might fart too!

               Phillip leans over and rips a big one. The laugh track laughs.

                                     TERRANCE
                         Ooh! You farted!

               The laugh track laughs again.

               Kyle laughs painfully. He holds his stomach. Just then, Kyle's 
               mother walks in.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Kyle boopie, What are you watching?

               But Kyle is laughing too hard to speak. His mother looks at 
               the television.

                                     TERRANCE
                         Hey Phillip, would you like a flower?

                                     PHILLIP
                         I sure would Terrance.

                                     TERRANCE
                         Alrighty then, here's a Tulip PUUU!! 
                         Terrance farts.

               Kyle is rolling around on the floor laughing wildly.

                         What is this? It's horrible!

                                     KYLE
                              (Collecting himself)

                         WHAT did he say?!

                                     TERRANCE
                         You're an asshole, Phillip!

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         What-what-WHAAAATT?

               Kyle's mom snaps the T.V. off.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Young man, you are not to watch that 
                         show anymore! It's immature toilet 
                         humor!

                                     KYLE
                         But EVERYBODY watches Terrance & 
                         Phillip!

               Cartman is on the couch eating cheesy poofs and watching 
               television.

               ANGLE - TELEVISION

               Terrance and Phillip are floating out in space.

                                     TERRANCE
                         Oh no, Phillip! looks like you're 
                         about to fart!

                                     PHILLIP
                         You're exactly right, Terrance!!

               A huge FART sound. Cartman laughs wildly.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Sweet!

                                     CARTMAN'S MOM
                         Eric dear, I just got a call from 
                         your friend Kyle's mother. She said 
                         that this show is naughty, and might 
                         make you a potty mouth.

                                     CARTMAN
                         That's a bunch of crap. Kyle's mom 
                         is a dirty jew.

                                     CARTMAN'S MOM
                         Oh, okay hon.


               Stan walks up to his bedroom door and looks at his list of 
               chores. 'Take Out Trash' followed by 'Feed Sparky' then 'clean 
               up room' and then, sloppily scribbled in crayon, 'Kill 
               Grandpa'.

               Stan looks confused, then realizes that grandpa is down the 
               hall.

                                     STAN
                         I'm not going to kill you, grandpa!

               Grandpa appears in the background.

                                     GRANDPA
                         Ingrate!

                         G'night grandpa.

               Stan goes into his room.

                                     GRANDPA
                         You pompous son of a whore!


               The kids are filing into their desks.

               Kyle gets into his desk, and immediately gets slugged in the 
               head by Cartman.

                                     KYLE
                         OW! What the hell was that for?!

                                     CARTMAN
                         That's for your stupid mother! She 
                         made me miss Terrance and Phillip 
                         last night!

                                     CLYDE
                         Yeah, what's the big idea having 
                         your mom call all our moms last night?

                                     KYLE
                         Well, I didn't have her do it, she 
                         did it on her own!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Why does this happen every month? It 
                         seems like right about the same time 
                         every month Kyle's mom gets a hair 
                         up her ass about something -- and I 
                         always end up getting screwed by it!

               Mr. Garrison steps in front of the class.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Children, children, a certain 
                         student's mother called me last 
                         night...

                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh gee, I wonder whose mother THAT 
                         could have been!

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         She informed me that some of you 
                         might be watching a naughty show 
                         called 'Terrance and Phillip'.

               The whole class smiles and cheers.

                                     CLASS
                         YEAH!

                         Watching that show is bad, Mr. 
                         Garrison.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         That's right, Mr. Hat, shows like 
                         Terrance and Phillip are what we 
                         call 'toilet humor'. They don't expand 
                         your minds.

               The kids blink.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         You see, children, these kind of 
                         shows are senseless, vile trash.

               Kenny walks in.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Kenny, why are you late to class?

               Kenny says nothing, but just hands Mr. Garrison a note.

               ANGLE - NOTE

               'Please excuse me from being late. I have explosive diarrhea'.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Oh. Okay, Kenny. Be seated.

               Kenny walks to his desk.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Now, as I was saying, the reason 
                         that parents of South Park are so 
                         upset is because you -- yes Kenny, 
                         what is it?

               Kenny has his hand raised.

                                     KENNY
                         Mph rmph rm.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         I thought you just came from the 
                         bathroom.

                                     KENNY
                         Mph rm rmph rm mph mph rm rm mm.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Oh okay, okay, go ahead.

               Kenny walks into a little bathroom.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         As I was saying, you all seem to 
                         enjoy this show, even though it isn't 
                         based in reality. There is much more 
                         to life than two young men farting 
                         on each other.

               Suddenly, we HEAR the sounds of splashing water and explosive 
               diarrhea.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         And throughout history there have 
                         always been shows that have come and 
                         gone that have been very bad. Usually 
                         they get taken right off the air. 
                         You see you should be spending your 
                         time enlightening your mind with 
                         more intelligent entertainment.

               Kenny walks out of the bathroom and takes his seat again.

                                     STAN
                         Whew! Smells like you slaughtered a 
                         cow in there, Kenny!

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Pay attention, children! I'm going 
                         to join your parents in requesting 
                         that you don't watch Terrance and 
                         Phillip anymore, ever.

                                     CARTMAN
                         WHAT?!

                                     CLYDE
                         Not watch Terrance and Phillip EVER?

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         That's right, children, are there 
                         any questions?
                              (Pause)
                         Yes, Stanly?

                                     STAN
                         Is it okay to kill somebody if they 
                         want you to?

               Garrison is taken aback.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         What do you mean?

               STAN

               The whole class sits and thinks.

                                     STAN
                         My grandpa keeps asking that I kill 
                         him all the time, and sometimes I 
                         wonder if I should.

                                     KYLE
                         Well then you should. I think that a 
                         person has a right to die if they 
                         wanna.

                                     STAN
                         Really?

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah, there's this guy named Jack 
                         Laborkian that goes around and murders 
                         people that ask him to, and he doesn't 
                         get in trouble at all.

                                     STAN
                         Wow.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Hey! Maybe we could get him to kill 
                         Kyle's mom!

                                     STAN
                         So IS it okay to assist somebody 
                         with suicide, Mr. Garrison?

               Mr. Garrison thinks.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Uh, Stan... I'm not touching that 
                         one with a twenty foot pole.

               Stan looks bummed.

                                     KENNY
                         Mph mph mph!!!

               Kenny dashes to the bathroom, slams the door, and let's go 
               of horrible, explosive diarrhea.

                                   COMMERCIAL BREAK #1


               The boys are in line for lunch.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Man, I can't believe we're gonna 
                         miss Terrance and Phillip today! I 
                         think I'm already having withdrawal!

               Cartman starts shaking and quivering uncontrollably.

                                     STAN
                         Don't worry, dude. We can all go 
                         watch it at my house! My parents 
                         don't get home until late.

                                     KYLE
                         But won't your grandpa be there?

                                     STAN
                         Yeah...

                                     CARTMAN
                         Just kill him, dude, maybe he'll 
                         give you some money.

                                     CHEF
                         Hello there, children!

                                     STAN
                         Hey Chef.

                                     CHEF
                         How's it going?

                                     STAN
                         Bad.

                                     CHEF
                         Why bad?

                                     STAN
                         Chef, Is it okay to kill your grandpa?

                                     CHEF
                         You can't kill my grandpa, Stan, 
                         he's already passed on.

                                     STAN
                         No I mean kill MY grandpa.

                                     CHEF
                         No I don't think that's okay, Stan. 
                         In fact I think that's illegal.

                                     STAN
                         See, I told you, dude.

                                     KYLE
                         Well yeah, but what if the grandpa 
                         wants to die, 'cause he's really 
                         old, and he's just asking for help?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Yeah, like assisted suicide, what 
                         about that?

               Chef thinks again.

                                     CHEF
                         I don't want to touch that with a 
                         forty-foot pole.

               Chef runs away.

               They boys just sit there and blink.

                                     STAN
                         What's the big deal? Why won't anybody 
                         talk about this?


               A large group of parents have gathered in a small meeting 
               hall. Kyle's mother is at the head of the group, speaking at 
               a podium.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         ...and I myself was not aware of 
                         this outrageous, horrible show until 
                         recently. I have a clip of this show 
                         to demonstrate exactly what I mean.

               Kyle's mom hits a button of a remote. A video image of 
               Terrance and Phillip starts.

               ANGLE - TELEVISION SCREEN

                                     TERRANCE
                         Hey, Phillip, guess what?

                                     PHILLIP
                         What?

               FARRRRRRT...

               The clip ends.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Now, apparently that's supposed to 
                         be FUNNY.

               Laughing is heard from the back of the room. CUT TO Stan's 
               Father, who is giggling to himself.

                                     STAN'S DAD
                         Ha, ha... He farted right on his 
                         head!

               The other parents look at Stan's dad, disgusted.

               Kyle's mom sighs.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Not allowing our kids to watch this 
                         show is not enough. We need to BOYCOTT 
                         THE ENTIRE NETWORK!! ALL THOSE IN 
                         FAVOR?!

               Hands bolt up into the air.

               Suddenly, violent poo sounds emerge from the toilet.

               Mr. Garrison steps out.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Ooh, I think I've caught a touch of 
                         flu from little Kenny this morning. 
                         I've got the green apple splatters.

               Some of the men in the audience laugh.


               Stan walks in the door followed by the other boys.

               Grandpa is sitting in his wheelchair trying to stick a fork 
               into a light socket.

                                     STAN
                         Hi, Grandpa. I brought my friends 
                         over to watch T.V. if that's okay.

                                     GRANDPA
                         Billy, help grandpa stick this fork 
                         in the outlet.

                                     STAN
                         No Grandpa, I'll get in trouble!

                                     GRANDPA
                         Kill me God damnit!

                                     STAN
                         No! I can't even kill a deer!

                                     GRANDPA
                         Well then have one of your little 
                         friends do it!!
                              (To Cartman)
                         You can kill me, can't you?

                                     CARTMAN
                         I would never kill somebody -- not 
                         unless they pissed me off.

                                     GRANDPA
                         Oh, is that a fact? Well, let me 
                         tell you something, Porky, your mom 
                         was over here earlier and I humped 
                         her like a little bitch.

                                     CARTMAN
                         WHAT?!

                                     GRANDPA
                         That's right.

                                     STAN
                         GRANDPA!!

                                     GRANDPA
                         And then I dug up your great grandma's 
                         skeleton and had my way with her 
                         too! Choice piece of ass, your great 
                         grandma!!

                                     CARTMAN
                         HEY! YOU PIECE OF CRAP! I'LL KILL 
                         YOU!!

                                     GRANDPA
                         That's the spirit, Tubby!!

                                     STAN
                         Come on, Cartman, he's just trying 
                         to get to you!

               Stan grabs Cartman and pulls him away.

                         in the kitchen.

                         boofed your dad, fatso?


               The boys are standing next to a small T.V. set and a phone. 
               Cartman is still fuming.

                                     CARTMAN
                         I can't believe that son of a bitch!

                         Ooh, snacky cakes? Good deal...

               Cartman starts to gorge himself.

                         you should ask the Lord for guidance.

                         in a lot of pain? You know, like 
                         assisted suicide. Is that okay?

               The two very plain looking teens are sitting on a couch.

                         Oh oh... I bet I know what's coming!

               Grandpa wheels himself in and nonchalantly hands Stan a piece 
               of rope.

                                     GRANDPA
                         Billy, would you mind holding this 
                         for grandpa, please?

               Stan doesn't take his eyes off the T.V.

                         the way of the T.V.

               Stan takes the rope. Grandpa heads to the background.

                         beans might make me fart!

               The boys all laugh merrily. Meanwhile, Grandpa is doing 
               something odd in the background.

               He is throwing the other end of the rope around a crossbeam.

                                     KYLE
                         Dude, he's gonna fart on his head 
                         again!!

               Suddenly, Kenny jumps up and rushes to the bathroom. We HEAR 
               a door SLAM and then the sounds of splashing water and 
               explosive diarrhea.

                                     KENNY

                         Hey, you're gonna miss it, Kenny!

               A fart sound comes from the T.V. The boys all break out 
               laughing hysterically.

                                     PHILLIP

               The boys laugh even harder.

                         DOING?!?!

               Stan jumps up and stands in front of the T.V.

                                     STAN
                         We're not watching Terrance and

                         was watching it.

                         DOING TO GRANDPA?!

               Stan looks down at the rope in his hand, then follows it up 
               over a crossbeam, and finally sees grandpa at the other end, 
               hanging by the neck.

                                     GRANDPA

               Stan lets go of the rope and grandpa crashes to the ground.

               The boys are running around the house like crazy. Garbage 
               and food is everywhere.

               Stan sighs and follows his grandfather.

                                     GRANDPA
                         I realized that the reason you won't 
                         kill me, is because you don't 
                         understand how I feel, Billy.

               They walk to one of the bedroom doors.

                                     GRANDPA
                         But I found out a way to show YOU 
                         what it feels like to be grandpa.


               Grandpa leads Stan into a little bedroom and closes the door, 
               locking both himself and Stan inside.

                                     STAN
                         Hey, what are you doing?

               Grandpa hits a switch, and the lights in the room go out.

               Stan tries to look around the dark room.

               Grandpa reaches down and puts a tape into a tape player.


                                     GRANDPA
                         Now, you're about to see what it's 
                         like to be as old as me. Are you 
                         ready Billy?

                                     STAN
                         I guess.

               Grandpa flips the switch on the tape player. A slow ENYA 
               Song begins to play.

                                     ENYA
                              (Singing)
                         Take a look, take a look...

               As the song continues, Stan is forced to just sit in the 
               dark room and listen to it.

               Finally, Stan grabs the doorknob, but its locked.

                                     STAN
                         Okay, you can let me out now.

                                     GRANDPA
                         Not just yet.

               Grandpa turns the song up louder. Stan pulls on the door.

                                     STAN
                         LET ME OUT, GRANDPA!!

               The song gets even louder still.

                                     STAN
                         I can't take it anymore! This music 
                         is terrible!! It's cheesy but lame 
                         and eerily soothing at the same time!!

                                     GRANDPA
                         THAT'S IT!!!! NOW YOU KNOW WHAT IT 
                         FEELS LIKE TO BE GRANDPA!!!!


               The boys run inside. Death is just behind them. It makes a 
               horrible sound.

                                     DEATH
                         Mrrrrr...

               The boys all run up into Stan's room and slam the door shut. 
               Death is just on the other side, pounding on the door.

                                     THE BOYS
                         Help, run run run!

                                     CARTMAN
                         What are we gonna do?!

               Stan looks over at his telephone.


                                     STAN
                         Mom, death is here and he's trying 
                         to take all of us away with him.

               The boys all look worriedly at the door which is still 
               pounding and shaking.


               Stan hangs up the phone. Death starts carving away at the 
               door with his sicle.

                                     STAN
                         Dammit! You know, I think that if 
                         parents would spend less time worrying 
                         about what their kids watch on T.V. 
                         and more time worrying about what's 
                         going on in their kids' lives, this 
                         world would be a much better place.

                                     KYLE
                         Yes, I think that parents get only 
                         get so offended by television because 
                         they rely on it as a babysitter and 
                         the sole educator of their kids.

                         Good point man.

               Suddenly death BURSTS THROUGH THE DOOR!!!

                                     STAN
                         AAGH!!

                         Quick! Jump out the window!!

               Just before Death can reach them, the boys jump out the 
               window.

               Stan's mom and dad walk in the door. Kyle's mom is with them.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Here they are!

               The boys all look terribly disappointed.

                                     CARTMAN
                              (To Kyle)

                         But look what they put on!

               Kyle's mother flips on the television.

                                     TELEVISION
                         And now back to 'She's the Sheriff!'!

               The boys look horribly disappointed.

                                     CARTMAN

               The parents all dash out the door.

                         Phillip has been taken off the air, 
                         what are we going to do for 
                         entertainment?

                                     STAN
                         I dunno... We could start breathing 
                         gas fumes...

               Grandpa wheels out wearing tourist garb and holding pamphlets.

                                     STAN
                         What are you doing grandpa?

                         you know over 400 people are eaten 
                         naturally by lions in Africa every 
                         year?

                                     STAN
                         That's my silly grandpa!

               The boys all laugh and fart.
