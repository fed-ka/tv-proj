      EXT. SMALL FARM - DAY 

      ... And we re SOARING over rolling hills, proverbial Irish 
      Heather, as we super:  Callan, Ireland.   DESCENDING on a 
      FARM, we see a rugged FARMER tending to goats and chickens.  
      The image is a portrait of peace and stillness... and THEN: 

      An MH-60 BLACKHAWK RIPS IT TO SHREDS.  Animals SCATTER as the 
      copter descends, deploying MEN IN TACTICAL GEAR who race 
      toward a FARMHOUSE.  The stunned FARMER tries to process 
      what s happening -- and it HITS HIM:

                                  FARMER
                    Walter -- 


      INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - SECONDS LATER

      BOOM!  The door s KICKED OPEN as the TACTICAL TEAM POURS IN, 
      a startled WOMAN (Mom) SHRIEKS and drops her pan, TERRIFIED:

                      WOMANTEAM LEADER
      What s-- what s happening?!  United States Government 
      WHO THE HELL ARE YOU PEOPLE?!Cyber Joint Task Force, stand 
                                                  aside -- 

      The men head toward a CLOSED DOOR at the end of the hall:


      INT. YOUNG BOY S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

      -- again: BOOM!  The door s KICKED OPEN to find... AN 11-YEAR-
      OLD BOY, young WALTER O NEIL.  Standing there expectantly.  
      Waiting.  

      Behind him, a HOME MADE COMPUTER fabricated from spare parts 
      and Mickey Mouse speaker ears -- the walls are PLASTERED with 
      BLUEPRINTS FOR THE SPACE SHUTTLE, watermarked  Classified.   
      The team STOPS SHORT, stunned to find their target is a 
      child, as Walter holds up a typed PIECE OF PAPER.  With an 
      IRISH LILT, swallowing fear:

                                  YOUNG WALTER
                    Immunity Agreement and Extradition 
                    Waiver.  Sign them and I tell you 
                    how I hacked into NASA.

      The men trade looks.  Team Leader keys his headset:

                                  TEAM LEADER
                    Crossbow to Command: We have 
                       Scorpion.   He s... just a kid. 

      The SNAP-SNAP of HANDCUFFS on Walter s wrists takes us to:                                                                                       2.


      EXT. FARMHOUSE - DUSK

      The armed men lead the boy out the front door:

                                  WALTER
                    Before you lock me in a room, 
                    please tell the shuttle designers 
                    that the shape of the nose cone 
                    tiles create a single point of 
                    failure -- people will die burning 
                    up on re-entry.

      Team Leader doesn t respond as they slow near the chopper, 
      where Walter s parents have been sidelined, as heartbroken as 
      they are furious.  Mom s quietly crying into dad s shoulder.  
      The boy s eyes go down... fear + regret...

                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    I... just wanted the blueprints for 
                    my wall.  

      But we see it in his father s face: this was the last straw.  
      Finally, he looks at Team Leader, quietly broken:

                                  FARMER/DAD
                    Don t bother bringing him back.

      HOLD: their last, painful moment as a family, as -- 


      EXT. HILLSIDE ABOVE HOUSE - DAY

      A 14 YEAR-OLD RED-HEAD GIRL appears cresting the hill.  STOPS 
      in shock, sees Walter being strapped into the chopper.  He 
      looks up.  MEETS HER EYES with a small, helpless wave and...

      The girl BREAKS INTO A RUN -- desperate -- too late -- as the 
      chopper RISES INTO THE SKY -- 


      INT. BLACKHAWK - RISING - CONTINUOUS

      CLOSE ON WALTER S FACE, looking out the window as he sees the 
      REDHEADED GIRL below in the wind-whipped wildflowers, looking 
      up at him in tears and calling out his name -- SURREAL ECHO -- 

                                  REDHEADED GIRL
                    Walter!  WALTER!!!

      And from Young Walter s face we MATCH CUT TO:

      ADULT WALTER, 36 years old, staring out a window, as if lost 
      in this memory -- the Redheaded Girl s desperate  Walter  has 
        TRANSITIONED to a WOMAN S VOICE also saying:

                                    WOMAN S VOICE
                    Walter?  Are you listening?                                                                                      3.


      He turns, jarred from his reverie -- we are:


      INT. DINER - LOS ANGELES - 22 YEARS LATER

      In case you haven t guessed yet, Walter s a genius, which may 
      begin to explain his t-shirt:  Intelli-Gents.   The slogan: 
       Extraordinary heroes for ordinary problems.   

      22 years have passed since Ireland -- years that have scarred 
      Walter in ways we ll soon understand.  Now, he s in the 
      middle of breaking up with JANICE, attractive, 30s.  He does 
      this with no malice, just factualness born of the certainty 
      he s always right.  Gone is any trace of that Irish brogue:

                                  WALTER
                    Yes, you said  I didn t see this 
                    coming at all. 

                                  JANICE
                    I can t believe you re breaking up 
                    with me...

      Not surprised to hear that, he pulls out a TYPED DOCUMENT:

                                  WALTER
                    Here, I thought this might help: 
                    you ve accused me -- correctly --  
                    of not being able to connect with 
                    you and your emotional states.  So 
                    to best recognize your feelings, 
                    I ve mapped a chart of what I 
                      anticipate you ll experience during 
                    the next 2 to 3 minutes.

                                  JANICE
                    You wrote a document... to connect 
                    with me emotionally?

      She SNATCHES the paper from him, anger building.  Walter s 
      actually trying to be kind, to make this gentler for her.  As 
      NEMOS, 50 s, the greek DINER OWNER, rushes past:

                                  NEMOS 
                    Hey: I m paying you to fix 
                    wireless, not talk!

                                  WALTER
                    Almost done here.

                                  JANICE
                          (beat: are you kidding?!)
                    You scheduled our breakup... on a 
                    job?                                                                                      4.


                                  WALTER
                    Well I needed 18 minutes to 
                    download the patch.  That gives us 
                    a buffer of at least 2 or 3 minutes 
                    after you showed up 4 minutes late  
                    -- your normal, on average -- then 
                    we d have 45 seconds of small talk 
                    before we got to the point, which 
                    is where we are now.  

                                  JANICE
                          (flips pages, angrily) 
                     Our relationship s run its course 
                    of usefulness  --  Walter s 
                    pragmatic tips for optimized joy   
                    What the hell are these?  How long 
                    is this thing?

                                  WALTER
                    That topsheet is page one, what 
                    follows is a decision tree. 
                          (her look: a what?)
                    Strategic options for a potential 
                    path to your happiness.  

      Furious, she starts grabbing her things -- 

                                  JANICE
                    Hey, guess what: you can take your 
                     decision tree?   And shove it up 
                    your ass.  The only part of me that 
                    needs to be fixed is the part that 
                    thought it was a good idea to go 
                    out with a human robot!  Actually, 
                    I m wrong about the human part -- 
                    that s the one thing you don t know 
                    anything about.  And as hard as you 
                    try?  You re never gonna get that 
                    right.  Never.

      -- she THROWS HER WATER at him, but Walter HOLDS UP his 
      laminated menu to BLOCK IT.  A beat: insult to injury...

                                  JANICE (CONT D)
                    You knew I d do that...

                                  WALTER
                          (quietly, not wanting to 
                            twist the knife)
                    If you look at page 2, you ll see 
                       irrational behavior  and 
                       predictability  as two of your 
                    points of vulnerability.

      She STORMS OUT.  Walter drops the wet menu, checks his watch:

                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    One minute to spare.                                                                                      5.


      INT. DINER - CORNER BEHIND THE COUNTER - SHORT WHILE LATER

      Walter works on the wireless -- a task so beneath him he does 
      it without looking; instead, his eyes land on a KID at the 
      counter playing with salt and pepper shakers.  This is RALPH, 
      he s 7, an introvert, and there s something about him that 
      ignites a spark in...

      ... WALTER, as we PUSH IN ON HIM watching the kid, the sounds 
      in the diner begin to ECHO and AMPLIFY... We re moving into 
      the world as Walter often sees it: the odd puzzle geometry of 
      objects and shapes takes on a pointillist, sun-bleached hue.  
      Everything starts to SLOW DOWN, EXCEPT WALTER.  Why?  Because 
      his mind moves at speeds so far ahead of everyone else s the 
      world around him seems eternally slow... 

      Everyone, that is, EXCEPT RALPH, who s moving those salt and 
      Pepper shakers around at WALTER SPEED.  Soon, we ll 
      understand why.  Suddenly, we re SNAPPED BACK to normal as:

                                  NEMOS
                          (heavy Greek accent)
                    No making a mess!  Paige.  Again 
                    your boy is all over with the 
                    shakers!

      And in rushes PAIGE DEATS: 30 s, waitress, real pretty.  
      She s everything we want in a hero: capable and strong-
      willed, damaged but proud, and nobody s fool:

                        PAIGEDINER OWNER
      Sorry, Nemos---- This is business, not day 
                                                  care.

                                  PAIGE
                    -- IknowIknow, he s just having 
                    trouble adjusting to school.  He ll 
                    be back there next week, promise.

      Nemos grumbles off.  Paige takes Ralph s hands, smiles:

                                  PAIGE (CONT D)
                    It's ok, Honey: Mr. Gianakos just 
                    doesn't want a mess.  Doesn't mean 
                    there's something wrong with you; 
                    you just have to think about some 
                    of the things you do, okay?

      Finally, Ralph nods.  Paige kisses his head, moves on... all 
      of which has been WITNESSED BY WALTER, who clocks how 
      effectively Paige just calmed Ralph.  A beat, then Walter 
      gets up and APPROACHES the kid.  Ralph looks up.  Something 
      UNSPOKEN seems to pass between them.  

      And then... Walter MOVES A SALT SHAKER TWO INCHES.  Ralph 
      studies Walter... then moves a PEPPER.                                                                                        6.


      Then Walter moves a salt.  Ralph moves a pepper.  Pace 
      quickens -- back and forth -- shakers bang down with 
      authority.  Until... they stop.

      WE RE NOT SURE WHAT JUST HAPPENED, but one thing is certain: 
      Ralph s eyes have LIT UP, as Paige sees this weird man with 
      her boy and rushes in protectively:

                                  PAIGE (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    Excuse me, can I help you?

                                  WALTER
                    No... but you should help him.

      Paige doesn t hear that as Walter intends it, rather as yet 
      another hurtful snap judgment about her  problem child :

                                  PAIGE
                    He s just fine.  If you re done 
                    here?  The door s over there.

      Beat: Walter grabs his things and heads off.  At the door, he 
      stops by Nemos at the register:

                                  WALTER
                    Wireless is up.  It s Novell -- old 
                    software, you need an upgrade.
                          (then)
                    Don t yell at the kid.

      And he s out.  Off Nemos, as  I M BROKE  by Black Joe Louis & 
      The Honeybears KICKS IN -- 


      EXT./INT. WALTER S 1989 NISSAN 300ZX - DAY

      ON A WORN TIRE cruising down the road.  Might still be worth 
      more than the car it s attached to.  Walter drives...

                                  RADIO DJ (OVER RADIO)
                    Okay, for $104.7 dollars... which 
                    month has 28 days?

                                  WALTER
                    All of  em.

                                  CONTESTANT (OVER RADIO)
                    February.

                                  RADIO DJ (OVER RADIO)
                    That s right! You re a winner!

                                  WALTER
                    Idiots.

      Then he hits a BUMP and coffee spills on him.                                                                                        7.


      As he slows to park, we BOOM UP to reveal a run-down, 
      prototypically North Hollywood warehouse on its last legs:


      INT. LOW-RENT INTELLI-GENTS GARAGE-LIKE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

      SYLVESTER POTTS: 35, Black, Statistics Guru, neurotic genius, 
      works an algorithm on a blackboard.  We notice his chalk is 
      lined up PERFECTLY in size order (can you say  OCD? ): 

                                  SYLVESTER
                    If my math s right, and it is, we 
                    can siphon 700kW a month through 
                    the Fall before anyone notices...

      He turns to HAPPY QUINN, standing on a ladder wearing a tool 
      belt: 28, emotionally guarded, Happy can fabricate anything.  
      She s working on a TRANSFORMER BOX, jerry-rigging WIRES to 
      run out the window:

                                  HAPPY
                    Dammit, these re all frayed --

                                  SYLVESTER
                    Careful, more than 30,000 shock-
                    related accidents happen a year.

                                  HAPPY
                    ... Please.  I got this. 

      And on cue, SPARKS FLY.  Lights flicker, STAY OUT -- just as 
      Walter walks in, sees Happy, and does the math:

                                  WALTER
                    Are you... stealing electricity?

                                  HAPPY
                    No.  I m borrowing it until they 
                    turn our power back on.

      Walter, instantly concerned, rushes to a COOLER APPARATUS:

                                  HAPPY (CONT D)
                    Don t worry, I hooked up your 
                    cooler to a car battery.  Your 
                    mouse brain s safe.

      He carefully removes a dish with a grey substance -- yep, 
      it s a brain.  Notes numbers on the cooler s readout, jots 
      them in a GREEN FILE labeled  IMMORTALITY PROJECT.   To 
      Sylvester:

                    I thought you were paying the bills 
                    after the Credit Nationale job?                                                                                      8.

                          (nervous, guilty)
                    I was, I mean, I worked 3 days on a 
                    loss algorithm for credit risk.  
                    They loved it, Walt, really loved 
                    it --

                          (putting it together)
                    You got lost in the numbers again 
                    and forgot to pay the electric 
                    bill...

                                  HAPPY
                    And the water bill.  And our rent.

                                  SYLVESTER
                    Not so much  forgot  as  couldn t : 
                    they wanted me to analyze their 
                    Mexico operation, you know I don t 
                    do Mexico -- the stats on foreigner 
                      kidnappings?  They think we re a 
                    nation of Lindbergh babies.

                                  WALTER
                          (a sigh)
                    How long s it been since you ate?

                                  SYLVESTER
                    You mean, like, food? 

      Walter chucks him an APPLE -- among geniuses, he s their 
      shield.  Happy senses Sylvester s shame, tries to cover:

                                  HAPPY
                    It s cool, I finished the Lynwood 
                    job.  Doc s picking up the fee now.

                                  WALTER
                    Why d Toby go get it?

                                  HAPPY
                    I built the contractor an automated

                    Sugar.
                          (simply)
                    So I hit him in the mouth.

      20 yards behind a car CHASES, slaloming garbage cans Toby 
        purposefully topples in his wake.  The car screeches to a 
      stop; 2 THUGS jump out as Toby races into... 


      INT. LOW-RENT INTELLI-GENTS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

      Toby LOCKS the door, the thugs POUNDING on the other side:

                                  THUG #1 (THROUGH DOOR)
                    Get out here, Cheat!

                    I don t have to cheat: you get a

                    like the Fat Kid when the pi ata

                                  TOBY
                    Hey, it s only gambling if you 
                    can t read the table -- I merely 
                    used my talents to raise our 
                    coffers.  

                                  WALTER
                    Where.  Is.  It. 

                                  TOBY
                    When a man called The Gooch pulls a 
                    bat you don t stick around to 
                    gather your chips, that s just 
                    common sense...

      OUTSIDE the pounding STOPS as the thugs move off to a 
      dumpster and starts searching for something... 

      INSIDE, Walter tosses his laptop bag on the couch with the 
      certainty that their prospects are, in fact, fucked:

                                  WALTER
                    The motto says  Extraordinary

                    Our combined IQ s almost 800 and we

                          (getting nervous)
                    Look, we-we-we had a bad day--                                                                                    10.


                                  WALTER
                    -- it s been a bad two years.  This 
                    was supposed to be a first step to 
                    something greater, not the only 
                    step -- 

      This conversation s igniting Sylvester s OCD/anxiety: these 
      people are his family, and it stresses him out to no end to 
      have it fraying, so he starts rearranging chairs around the 
      table:

                                  SYLVESTER
                    Yeah, well, this needs to work, 
                    cause out there is not an option.  
                    No one else would have us -- I 
                    don t even have an apartment.  
                    Seriously -- I haven t not slept in 
                    this warehouse for like... ever.

      Everyone TALKS OVER EACH OTHER, a cacophony of dysfunction:

                          TOBYSYLVESTER
      I can take one of the (as one sentence:)
      standing teaching offers from I ve got enough money left

                                                  car which would give me an 
                   HAPPYextra 2 months but drops the 
      Please.  Rutgers wouldn t odds of me getting to 33% of

                   TOBYSylvester, take a breath -- 
      Princeton was a 
        misunderstanding, I should ve           SYLVESTER
      never used Undergrads as test -- which gives me a 51% 
      subjects... they cry too chance I ll be living under a 
      easily.bridge in 4 and a half   
                                                    months-- 


        A commanding FINGER WHISTLE from Walter STOPS THEM, all 
      except for Sylvester, who s spinning out in an OCD chair-
      arranging frenzy.  Walter SNAPS his fingers to Toby, who -- 
        ritualistically -- pulls out a DECK OF CARDS, tosses them to 
      Walter, who SHUFFLES them like a pro and spreads them on the 
      table:

                                  WALTER
                    Hey, Sylvester: put the deck back 
                    in order.

      Sylvester SHIFTS from chairs to cards like a MAGNET, begins 
      ordering... Jacks, Kings, etc... the process calming him:                                                                                    11.

                          (deep breath, BIG smile)
                    Thanks, Walt.  

      BOOM!  They all turn to the door now VIBRATING from IMPACT --


      EXT. ALLEY BEHIND INTELLI-GENTS HEADQUARTERS - SAME TIME

      As the thugs SMASH a metal pole they ve pulled from the 
      dumpster into the door, two BLACK SEDANS screech into the 
      alley, skid to a STOP: ND AGENTS exit car #1.  Federal Agent 
      CABE GALLO (45, NY blue collar, no nonsense) exits car #2:

                                  THUG #1
                    Good, cops.  Guy in there owes me 
                    money -- 

                                  CABE
                    Drop it, or I ll put a bag of pills 
                    in your pocket fat enough to get 
                    you a room in Lompoc.  Understand?

      As the thugs RUSH OFF, Cabe slides his badge under the door:

      Sylvester picks up the badge, alert, tosses it to Walter, who 
      checks it: it s real.  Nods to Sylvester, who OPENS the door 
      to reveal Cabe -- ON WALTER as he sees him and PALES:

                    Even with half my IQ, I wouldn t be 
                    dumb enough to believe you twice.

                    record.  You got your pound of 
                    flesh.  We re even.

                                  WALTER
                    The fact that you think we re even 
                    is why I ll never trust you.

                                  HAPPY
                    Give us a minute -- 

      Happy takes Walter s arm, leads him to a quiet corner.  Cabe, 
      anxious, folds his arms to wait.  Beside him, Toby folds his 
      arms too.  Cabe glances over:

                                  CABE
                    The hell re you doing?

                                  TOBY
                    Mirroring you so your subconscious 
                    relates to me better -- it s a 
                    little tense in here, thought it 
                    might calm you down.

                                  CABE
                          (not at all calm)
                    And how s that working out for ya?

      WITH HAPPY AND WALTER: they speak sotto:

                                  HAPPY
                    Is that the guy?  The one you told 
                    me about?
                          (Walter nods)
                    I hate him already.  But money s 
                    money and we need it, especially 
                    you. 
                          (points to the Cooler)
                    Think about what 50 thou could do.  
                    For her.                                                                                    15.


      Her?  What does that mean?  Whatever it is, it s tempting for 
      Walter, his very lifeblood... yet, it s not nearly enough:

                                  WALTER
                    A drop in the bucket.

                                  HAPPY
                    Every flood starts with a drop, 
                    right?  
                          (small grin)
                    I know you don t trust him.  But 
                    the difference between then and 
                    now... 
                          (gestures: the team)
                    ... is us.

      That buoys him.  Point: Happy.  Walter looks over at Cabe who 
      shifts his weight, eager to get going.  Toby does the same.  
      Cabe turns to him; Toby takes a semi-fearful STEP BACK.  
      Walter makes a split-second CALCULATION, moves toward Cabe:

                                  WALTER
                    LAX Tower Control is the main hub 
                    for all the other airports -- 

                                  CABE
                    Fix the software there, it auto 
                    corrects Long Beach and Burbank.

                                  WALTER
                    The new software s the glitch: 
                    first step s to delete it, download 
                    the old software -- that s enough 
                    for the planes to land.

                                  CABE
                    So you ll do it -- 

                                  WALTER
                    You had your social security re-
                    issued through the Witness 
                      Protection Program so I couldn t 
                    hack you again.  Give me your new 
                    number.  

                                  CABE
                    No way.

                                  WALTER
                    Then you don t get our help.  I 
                    need assurance to guarantee trust.  

                                  CABE
                          (a beat, shit...)
                    Fine.  038--                                                                                    16.


                                  SYLVESTER
                          (like a shot)
                    -- Nope.  038 means Rhode Island 
                    issued.  

                                  TOBY
                    Your accent and aggression says New 
                    York.  Queens.  Bronx, maybe.

                                  CABE
                          (busted: double shit)
                    ... 101-58-5875.  Can we go now? 

                                  TOBY
                    He s telling the truth.

                                  WALTER
                          (to Cabe)
                    You re trying to outsmart the wrong 
                    people.  Lie to me again... and I 
                    will erase you.  

      Walter grabs his bag and walks out.  Happy grins at Cabe, 
      grabs her gear, and follows, as do the others -- SMASH TO:


      EXT./INT. PLANE - SKIES AT 30,000 FEET - DAY

      WHOOSH: a 747 JETLINER rips past camera, cutting clouds --
      CAPTAIN JASON PIKE radios to no avail, growing concern:

                                    CAPTAIN PIKE
                    Still no contact -- 

                                  CO-PILOT
                    At 10,000 feet I might get a 
                    signal.

                                    CAPTAIN PIKE
                    If we descend without comms, we 
                    could run into another plane.  

                                  CO-PILOT
                    Less than 100 minutes of fuel...

      Grave looks, off which the SCREAM OF A SIREN takes us to:


      EXT./ INT. GOVERNMENT SUV S - 405 FREEWAY - DAY

      Two GOVERNMENT SUVs shred down the 405.  In the LEAD VEHICLE, 
      Cabe and Walter up front: Walter s writing some kind of LIST 
      on a pad -- Cabe glances over:

                                  CABE
                    What re you doing?                                                                                    17.


      Walter turns from view and doesn t answer, no trust here.  
      Toby, Happy, Sylvester in the backseat:

                                  SYLVESTER
                    I knew the slogan was a mistake: 
                    this isn t an ordinary problem and 
                    we sure as hell aren t heroes.  
                    These t-shirts are a polyester 
                    blend of lies.

                                  TOBY
                    It s marketing psychology.  Who s 
                    gonna hire someone with the slogan 
                         Nerds-That-Never-Got-Laid-In-High 
                          School-Who-Can-Fix-Your-Router?  

      SUDDENLY: SCREECH!  Everyone LURCHES forward as Cabe BRAKES 
      HARD: UP AHEAD, an OVERTURNED TRUCK.  Unmoving traffic. 

                                  CABE
                    Dammit -- 

                                  SYLVESTER
                    Odds of success just fell to 36%.  

                                  HAPPY
                    This is going great so far.

      Cabe steps out in frustration to see if he can move traffic; 
      Walter gets out too, as Toby says:

                                  TOBY
                    Ah, yes, getting 3 feet closer will 
                      definitely help you move that 
                    truck...


      EXT. 405 - CONTINUOUS

      Walter and Cabe in the gridlock -- HORNS BLARING -- YELLING -- 

                                  WALTER
                    You re a Fed, get us a copter -- 

                                  CABE
                    Air traffic s been shut down til 
                    the situation s resolved.

      Sylvester s head PEERS out the window:

                                  SYLVESTER
                    No copter?  Now it s 17%!

      As Cabe heads forward to see what he can do, we go CLOSE ON 
      WALTER as the SYMPHONY OF CHAOS blares around him... and the 
      closer we get, the sound begins to FADE AWAY until it goes...                                                                                    18.


      ... DEAD SILENT.  As before, everything around Walter has 
      SLOWED.  HIS EYES SNAP BACK AND FORTH AT REM SPEED, 
      CALCULATING -- and now, an echo on the wind, he hears:

      A YOUNG GIRL S LAUGHTER.  As we -- FLASHCUT: POV dreamlike -- 
      we re running behind that REDHEAD GIRL from our opening -- 
      chasing her through PURPLE WILDFLOWERS -- she turns to us:

                                    REDHEAD
                    C mon, Walter... catch me!  You can 
                    do it!

      A DOPPLER HORN SMASHES US BACK TO: 

      WALTER ON THE HIGHWAY, his eyes STOP MOVING AT REM.  Somehow, 
      this memory has GALVANIZED HIM -- he knows what to do:

                                  WALTER
                    CABE!
                          (up ahead, Cabe whirls)
                    We need a reliable wireless signal 
                    with no chance of going down -- I 
                    just fixed one a mile West of here.  


      INT. DINER - DAY

      BAM: our team bursts in -- Cabe, ON FIRE, beelines to Paige, 
      who looks up in surprise as she sets food down on a table:

                                  CABE
                    Owner -- 

      Startled, she POINTS and asks  What s happening?  but Cabe s 
      already moving to an equally startled Nemos -- 

                                  CABE (CONT D)
                    I need to commandeer your diner for 
                      a National Emergency -- you and 
                    your staff can stay but that s it.

      He flashes his BADGE and throws down an ENVELOPE OF CASH:

                                  NEMOS 
                    Everybody out!  You pay tomorrow!

      As he shoos people out, our team RAPIDLY sets up gear.  Paige 
      pulls Ralph to her protectively -- the kid s rapt, watching 
      WALTER, as Sylvester takes ANTI-BACTERIAL WIPES to the table:

                                  CABE
                    What re you doing? 

                                  SYLVESTER
                    Any idea the levels of bacteria 
                    found on counter-tops?  From 
                    chicken alone--                                                                                    19.


                                  CABE
                          (SNATCHES away the wipes)
                    Forget the chicken -- 

      ON NEMOS, sidling up to Paige, whispers:

                                  NEMOS
                    My immigration status makes me not 
                    so comfortable around Federal 
                    Agents, understand?  You lock up?

      She nods, Nemos is quickly OUT the back door.  This is 
      noticed by Walter, who glances over at Ralph and Paige:

                                  WALTER
                    Good to see you again, Ralph.
                          (to Paige, curt)
                    I ll take a Coke, easy ice.

                                  PAIGE
                    Uh, normally  please  makes its way 
                    into that sentence.

      He glances over -- registers her tone -- says, softer:

                                  WALTER
                    Please. 

      As Paige moves to the soda fountain, she sees Sylvester skim 
      an  LAX EMERGENCY PROCEDURES  binder as Cabe brushes urgently 
      past, on his cell:

                                  CABE
                    Roughly a hundred and nine minutes 
                    til the first planes go down --

                                  PAIGE
                    Is-- is something wrong at LAX? 

                                  SYLVESTER
                    It s top secret.

                                  PAIGE
                    How secret can it be if the guy who 
                    set up our wireless is working on 
                    it?  

      -- as we WHIP TO WALTER, slipping on a headset -- he runs the 
      show like a master conductor tuning his orchestra -- 

                                  WALTER
                    Happy: prep a POST check so after 
                    the system s stabilized we can make 
                    sure there s no overheating 
                    hardware --
                          (she s OFF)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    20.

                                  WALTER (CONT'D)
                      Sylvester: run odds on the patch 
                    linking back into the system, I 
                    don t want the same problem 
                    tomorrow.  Toby: profile the Black 
                    Hat Hacker boards, look for a 
                    saboteur -- 

      Everyone SPINS into motion as Paige sets Walter s soda down.  
      This time he looks up at her says, unprompted, meaning it:

                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    Thank you.

      The MOMENT holds -- a small CONNECTION -- then he s back to 
      work -- Sylvester swallows, feeling the pressure:

                                  SYLVESTER
                    We screw up, brains and testicles 
                    are gonna bounce all over town.

                                  HAPPY
                    Actually, fuel tanks ll ignite on 
                    impact.  You won t find a body 
                    part. 

                                  TOBY
                    Except maybe the more viscous 
                    organs.  A blood-soaked spleen will 
                    burn at a slower rate -- 

                                  PAIGE
                    -- HEY.
                          (everyone looks up)
                    I d appreciate it if you d all 
                    check your language around my 7-
                    year-old.

                      SYLVESTERHAPPY
      Sorry.My bad.

                                  TOBY
                    It s just science.

                                  PAIGE
                    -- no, it s just common courtesy.
                    Be decent in my place of work.

      With that, Paige moves back to Ralph.  Walter watches her go, 
      pretty damn IMPRESSED, as Cabe starts tossing out WALKIES 
      from a duffel bag -- hands one to Walter:

                                  CABE
                    Secure channel to LAX, Air Traffic 
                      Supervisor s on the line, his 
                    name s Brooks --                                                                                     21.


                                  WALTER
                          (works laptop + walkie)
                    I m hacking into airport security -- 
                    Mr. Brooks, I m gonna rotate your 
                    cameras to point at the monitors.  
                    I ll see it remotely and walk you 
                    through the steps -- 


      INT. LAX CONTROL TOWER - SAME TIME

      It s MADNESS here: Air Traffic Controllers scramble as 
      BROOKS, HEAD ATC (60 s, non-techie), responds into walkie:

                                  BROOKS
                    Whoa, who am I on with here?  I m 
                    not comfortable with you hacking 
                    into anything at this airport--

                                  WALTER
                    Then don t make it so easy.  My 
                    name s Walter O Neil and I was 
                    brought in to fix your problem 
                    since you re not capable of doing 
                    it yourself.  Look behind you at 
                    the camera -- 

      Brooks turns: the CORNER SECURITY CAMERA pivots on its own.  
      ON WALTER S LAPTOP we see the image rotate, but it STOPS 
      moving when it only has a SLIVER of the monitor inside the 
      control tower in sight.

                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    Dammit, the camera doesn t turn far 
                    enough.

                                  HAPPY 
                            (lightbulb!)
                    Wait a minute -- uh, Brooks, is it? 
                    Can you put your chair under the 
                    camera, please?

                                  BROOKS 
                    My... chair?

                                  HAPPY 
                    Just do it... Now stand on it and 
                    take a coin from your pocket.  
                    Reach to the top of the arm that 
                    rotates the camera and use the coin 
                    to remove the screw. 

      As Brooks does that, Walter leans back to give Happy access 
      to his keyboard and her fingers fly.  The camera begins to 
      turn 20 MORE DEGREES...                                                                                    22.


                                  HAPPY (CONT D)
                    Wait for iiiit....

      ... giving a FULL VIEW of the tower on the computer screen! 
      The image FLICKERS every two seconds.  Jesus, she s good... 

                                  WALTER
                    Brooks, we see the room -- now hit 
                    Control C right in-between the 
                    flickers on the screen.  You gotta 
                    get it at the exact moment I say 
                     now  -- ready? 

                                  BROOKS 
                    Oh, okay -- 

                                  WALTER
                          (the FLICKER, then)
                    Now -- 

      Brooks tries, stressed -- NOTHING -- 

                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    You missed.  Try again.

                                  BROOKS
                    It s too fast -- 

                                  WALTER
                    Forget it.  We ll use the function 
                    keys, once we re in I m gonna need 
                    you to do a core dump --

                                  BROOKS
                    Uh... full disclosure?  I don t 
                    really  use  the computers.  I just 
                    look at blips on screens and tell 
                     em when to land. 

      Walter s eyes SNAP to Cabe: who the hell is this guy?

                                  WALTER
                    He doesn t know basic prompts?!

                                  RALPH
                          (softly)
                    He s old.  He doesn t understand.

      Walter TURNS to Ralph.  Paige is STUNNED -- Ralph never talks 
      to strangers -- starts ushering him away:

                                  PAIGE
                    Ralph, sweetie, let s let  em 
                    work...                                                                                    23.


                                  WALTER
                    No, he s right... Brooks, go to the 
                    terminal and find me a kid -- a fat 
                    kid -- playing a video game in an 
                    Anthrax T-shirt or something, now!


      INT. LAX TERMINAL - MOMENTS LATER

      TRAVELERS SCATTER as Brooks and Security SPRINT through the 
      terminal shouting  MOVE ASIDE  -- 

                                  SECURITY (INTO WALKIE)
                    Sweep Gates 1 through 12!  And have 
                    a team search the food court! 

                                  BROOKS
                    There!

      ON A FAT KID (15) playing a video game in a PRIMUS t-shirt: 

                                  BROOKS (CONT D)
                    Kid, you any good at computers?

                                  FAT KID
                          (not looking up from game)
                    Whaddayou think?

                                  BROOKS (INTO WALKIE)
                    I found a fat kid but he s wearing 
                      a  Primus  t-shirt?  That work?!

                                    THURMAN
                          (fat kid?!)
                    Hey -- 


      INT. DINER - DAY - INTERCUTTING

                                  WALTER (OVER WALKIE)
                    Let me talk to him!

      Brooks hands the EXTREMELY CONFUSED FAT KID the walkie -- 

                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    Hi, there -- what s your name?

                                  FAT KID
                    ... Thurman?

                                  WALTER
                    Thurman, you code?

                                    THURMAN
                    Like a ninja.  Why?                                                                                    24.


                                  WALTER
                    Get him to the tower now! 

      Security Guard YANKS THURMAN OUT OF HIS CHAIR --


      INT. LAX CONTROL TOWER/ DINER - DAY - INTERCUTTING:

      Brooks and Security RUSH THURMAN in as Walter guides him:

                                  WALTER 
                    There s a problem with the 
                      computers, I need you to get into 
                    BIOS, help re-install software.

                                    THURMAN
                    Hell I am.  Y all called me fat.

      Walter SPINS to Paige, hands her the walkie:

                                  WALTER
                    Talk to him like you talked to 
                    Ralph this morning.

                                  PAIGE
                    ... What?  N-- no, I don t know 
                    what to say --

                                  WALTER
                    Yes you do.  Pretend he s your son 
                    and follow your instincts.  Do it 
                    now.

      Ralph is WATCHING her expectantly.  Finally, Paige nervously 
      clears her throat, takes the walkie, in the fire now:

                                  PAIGE
                    Um, Thurman?  Hi.  I m Paige.  I 
                    have a son and sometimes kids tease 
                    him too.  And it sucks.  That s why 
                    he likes to get lost in video 
                    games.

                                    THURMAN
                    I don t  get lost  in them.  
                    They re just cool.

      Nerve struck, the kid s reacting defensively -- Sylvester 
      slips Walter a note that reads: 6.8% Success Rate.  Walter 
      BRUSHES the note away, laser focus -- THIS IS TENSE AS HELL --  
      but Paige, God Bless her, stays right with the kid:

                                  PAIGE
                    I know, right?  They are cool.  The 
                    new GTA?  You played that yet?                                                                                    25.


                                    THURMAN
                    You... let your kid play  Grand 
                    Theft Auto ?

                                  PAIGE
                    I play with him -- that way I can 
                    explain the violence.  Check out 
                    the new add on s, by the way -- 
                    there s this Lamborghini 
                      Murci lago?  Killer.

                                  CABE
                          (no time for this!!)
                    Lady -- 

      Feeling the squeeze, Paige SNAPS her fingers at Cabe to pipe 
      down -- he does -- another moment not lost on Walter -- 

                                  PAIGE (INTO WALKIE)
                    This is real, Thurman, it s not a 
                    game: real people up in planes are 
                    gonna die if you don t help.  They 
                    need you.  The buttons you push 
                    right now will actually make a 
                      difference.  You up for it, Buddy?   

      Our team is taking in Paige too, impressed -- then, Thurman s 
      hands lower to the keyboard in front of him:

                                    THURMAN (OVER WALKIE)
                    Okay... game on.

      Walter takes the walkie from Paige, nods thanks -- she smiles 
      back and SIGHS in relief -- Happy leans in to Paige, a grin:

                                  HAPPY
                    Nice work.

                                  PAIGE
                          (secretly proud)
                    ... You, too.

      A MOMENT between them as Walter keys the walkie to Thurman:

                                  WALTER
                    Do a core dump and restart the BGC. 
                    Brooks, give Thurman the original 
                      installation disc to download.

                                  BROOKS
                    Software was installed 15 years 
                    ago.  I don t know where the hell 
                    it is and the company went outta 
                    business.

                                  WALTER
                    When do you back up your data?                                                                                    26.

                                  WALTER
                    I can hack in and get it --

                                    THURMAN
                    No go, dude.  System s air-gapped. 

                                  WALTER
                    The live system s an Open House but 
                    the back up s Fort Knox: this is 
                    why people hate government.

                                  CABE
                    You wanna have this conversation 
                    now?  We ve got an hour and a half.  

                                  WALTER
                    If we get a copy of the old 
                    software from the back-up server, I 
                    e-mail it to Thurman -- he clicks a 
                    link and the system s up and 
                    running as if the corrupted 
                    software was never downloaded.

                                  CABE
                    I ll get you clearance, take my car 
                    and stay in contact -- 

      He tosses Happy his keys -- as she CATCHES them we SLAM TO:


      INT. DATA CENTER - HALLWAY - 20 MINUTES LATER

      Toby/Happy RUNNING down a hall with the BUILDING MANAGER:

                                    MANAGER
                    We just finished renovating the 
                    whole place.  Each room s airtight 
                    and fireproof --  

      Manager enters a code, a door SLIDES open.  Toby/Happy rush 
      into what s essentially a small SERVER ROOM, stacked with 
      servers 7  high), quickly start setting up laptops:                                                                                    27.


                                  TOBY
                    Which one of these backs-up LAX?

                                    MANAGER
                    We keep that info in our Inventory 
                      Listings...

      He turns to a shelf to retrieve the listing... but the shelf 
      is empty.  His face FALLS as he realizes...

                                    MANAGER (CONT D)
                    ... Oh God.  We packed up all the 
                    binders when we renovated.  We 
                    haven t brought it all back from 
                    storage yet--

                                  TOBY
                    -- Where is it?

                                    MANAGER
                      A Store-N-Stuff in Northridge... 
                    look, it s after 5, I m the only 
                    one here, but I ll leave right now 
                    and call you in 30 minutes with the 
                    number of the server--

                                  HAPPY
                    -- Just shut up and go!

      Manager closes the door, and RACES OFF -- 


      INT. DINER - CONTINUOUS

      CLOSE ON KETCHUP BOTTLES, STACKED MOUTH-TO-MOUTH.  RACK TO 
      PAIGE, marrying the bottles.  Her eyes go to WALTER at his 
      laptop, writing installer code.  Their eyes meet; he scans 
      her hands, tactless as always... 

                                  WALTER
                    You have anemia.  It turns 
                      fingernails pitted, that s why your 
                    polish looks streaky and cheap.  
                    You need more iron.

      Paige STOPS, offended.  Moves to the booth seat across from 
      him... PUSHES the top of his laptop DOWN, CLOSING IT.  He 
      looks up, trance broken, startled.  Her voice is FIRM, 
      controlled, like a parent scolding a child:

                                  PAIGE
                    You... are an ignoramus.  Even if 
                    you re right?  And that s why my 
                    polish looks  cheap?   Who the 
                    hell re you to walk into my diner 
                    and judge me?  You don t do that.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    28.

                                  PAIGE (CONT'D)
                    It hurts my feelings.  Do you 
                      understand?

                                  WALTER
                    ... I recognize I ve been told 
                    things like that.  Before.  
                          (beat)
                    A lot.

                                  PAIGE
                    And for the record, you re wrong -- 
                    my polish streaks because Ralph 
                    likes to do it, he loves to paint, 
                    and I don t appreciate you telling 
                    me he needs  help,  either.  I get 
                    it from everybody -- yes, he s 
                    slow, have some empathy.

      ON WALTER.  The barest twitch of musculature in his jaw 
      belies a seismic reaction to that.  Paige has no clue that 
      she has no clue what she just said:

                                  WALTER
                    When was he diagnosed?

                                  PAIGE
                    It s none of your damn business.
                          (but just as quickly:)
                    His whole life.  I ve been to nine 
                    experts -- six doctors -- 

                                  WALTER
                    M-hm.  And all these  experts ... 
                    lemme guess, they diagnosed Ralph 
                    with ADHD, OCD, and mild autism, 
                    then prescribed Ridalin and told 
                    you it d be better in the morning.
                          (off her SURPRISE)
                    How close am I?  I ll take 
                     exactly  if that s the answer.

      Paige -- amazed and confused -- how does he know all this?

                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    Take a look at your son right now.

      She glances over: Ralph is at a table, having once again 
      arranged condiments and silverware, moving them around:

                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    The Sweet & Low?  That s the King.  
                    The Stevia s The Queen, the Sugar 
                    In The Raw packets are the Knights, 
                    the vinegar s the Bishop, the 
                    spoon s The Rook, and the forks are 
                    the pawns.                                                                                      29.


      SLOWLY, WE PUSH IN ON PAIGE.  We watch the insane, impossible 
      moment of her realizing what he's saying... in a nanosecond, 
      her brain scours her son s life, and every wrong assumption 
      that she, and everyone else, has made.  She exhales, SHOCK:

                                  PAIGE
                    He s... he s playing chess?

                                  WALTER
                    He s imagining a 64 square board 
                    and 8,902 possible outcomes.  In 
                    his head.  With only eight objects.  
                    At Master Level.
                          (reads her tag)
                    I hate to be the bearer of bad news 
                       Paige ... but your son s a genius.  
                    And he doesn't  like to paint.   He 
                    does your nails because he wants to 
                    hold your hand and be close to you, 
                    but he doesn't know how. 

      Paige s eyes WELL.  With a mother s love comes the guilt of 
        misunderstanding her son s pain, which Walter reads 
      instantly.  He re-opens the laptop and goes back to writing:

                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    It won t help you to feel guilty -- 
                    this is a  get out of jail free  
                    card.  You weren t able to see it, 
                    not because you don t love him, or 
                    because you re not trying... 
                          (beat)
                    But because it s literally 
                      impossible for you.  

      Paige swallows.  He starts to gather up his computer, which 
      fires an immediate need in her, desperate for his guidance...

                                  PAIGE
                    How... how can I help him?

                                  WALTER
                    You can pretend to understand him, 
                    but soon he ll hit the realization 
                    he s surpassed you as a source of 
                      authority.  That's when it ll get 
                    harder for you... and more lonely 
                    for him.
                          (beat)
                    I m sorry, I have work to do.

      And moves off.  Off Paige, mind tumbling, wildly emotional... 
      her eyes go to RALPH, their lives now and forever changed.  

                                      END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    30.

      INT. DATA CENTER - SERVER ROOM/CLOSET - SAME TIME

      Happy and Toby test servers, she checks her watch, anxious:

                                  HAPPY
                    Where the hell s the manager?

      Suddenly, a POPPING NOISE -- SPARKS FLY from the server 
      Toby s at -- then a BURNING SMELL and TRAIL OF SMOKE -- she 
      looks over at him, holding a USB cable with a GUILTY LOOK:

                                  HAPPY (CONT D)
                    What d you do?

                                  TOBY
                    I tried to plug the USB into the 
                    USB connector to scan the drives 
                    but it wouldn't fit, so I wiggled 
                    it around and pushed harder.

                                  HAPPY
                    You shorted out the machine -- the 
                    USB s on the other side, that s the 
                    HDMI port.  Where re your glasses?

                                  TOBY
                    I... I thought I looked better 
                    without them. 

      SUDDENLY: BEEPBEEPBEEP!  They look UP -- the SMOKE has hit 
      the SMOKE ALARM -- WATER SPRAYS FROM CEILING SPRINKLERS -- 
      Happy SCRAMBLES to protect equipment -- more servers SPARK -- 
      she grabs the laptop, hits the door pad: BZZZ!  RED LIGHT:

                      HAPPYTOBY
        Nononononono -- Stop messing around, open the 
                                                  door!

                    I can t!  The server you fried had 
                    the door codes!

                                  TOBY
                    The room s vacuum-sealed... that 
                    means water-tight too!

      Happy LUNGES for her Walkie on a shelf:

                                  HAPPY (INTO WALKIE)
                    Walter!  The room s filling up with 
                    water and we can t open the door!                                                                                    31.


      INT. DINER - SAME TIME - INTERCUTTING:

      Everyone REACTS -- Cabe snatches his walkie:

                                  CABE
                      Seriously?

                                  HAPPY (OVER WALKIE)
                    No!  I thought now was the right 
                    time for a prank call!  Yes, we re 
                    seriously trapped in here!

      Walter gets on his laptop, types FURIOUSLY, keys his walkie: 

                                  WALTER
                    Gimme dimensions of the room,

                    3  pipe.  7  corrugated shelving -- 

                                  WALTER
                    -- How high is it now?

      Water s to the KNEES on Happy and Toby, pouring in HARD --

                                  TOBY
                    At our knees!  IT S AT OUR KNEES, 
                    WALTER!

                                  WALTER
                          (spins to Sylvester)
                    Figure out how much time they have.

      Sylvester spins to the  SPECIALS  blackboard but is AGHAST to 
      find DIFFERENT SIZES OF CHALK PILED WILLY-NILLY IN THE HOLDER 
      -- pours the chalk onto the table, starts lining them up in 
      size order (just like in the teaser)...

                WALTER (CONT D)SYLVESTER
      Not now, Sylvester.Just-- just lemme do my  
                                                  thing -- 

                      CABE SYLVESTER
      What the hell s he doing?  (frantically moving 
      What are you doing?chalk)
                                                    I can t calculate until 
                                                    there s order!  It s my 
                                                    process --


                                  CABE
                    Your process?  My process involves 
                    my foot and your ass--                                    Pink (mm/dd/yyyy)32.


                                  HAPPY (OVER WALKIE)
                    Just pick a piece of chalk! 

      ON PAIGE -- AN IDEA -- GRABS all the chalk EXCEPT ONE PIECE 
      and shoves them in her pocket, offers the piece to Sylvester:

                                  PAIGE
                    Here.  One piece. It s the biggest 
                    and the smallest.  So it s in 
                    order.  Ok?

                                  SYLVESTER
                          (a beat: yep)
                    That works. 

      He grabs the chalk, gets to work, as Paige looks to an 
        increasingly impressed Walter -- 

                                  PAIGE
                    Ralph organizes his closet by ROY-G-
                    BIV.

                                  SYLVESTER
                          (as he calculates)
                    Assuming standard commercial water 
                    pressure and reducing for the 
                    volume of their bodies and the 
                    shelving, they ll be underwater in 
                    14 minutes...
                          (STOPS, GRAVE)
                    We can t get there in time.

      Walter starts SCRIBBLING something --

                                  PAIGE
                    ... Ralph, go play in Mr. Gianakos  
                    office.

      Ralph, sensing the seriousness, hurries off... but PEEKS 
      around the corner to keep listening:


      INT. DATA CENTER - SERVER ROOM/CLOSET - SAME TIME

      The room s getting FULLER -- as they keep trying to protect 
      the laptop, Toby s falling deeper into PANIC -- 

                                  TOBY
                    The body reacts when death s 
                    imminent -- adrenal cortex in 
                      overdrive, skeletal and cardiac 
                    muscles tense while smooth muscle 
                    relaxes -- that s why you might 
                    feel the water near me getting 
                      noticeably warmer--                                                                                    33.


                                  HAPPY
                    I m not dying like this... not 
                    without a damn Christmas present.

                                  TOBY
                    ... What?

                                  HAPPY
                    Foster homes always send you back 
                    early December so they don t have 
                    to buy you anything.  

                                  TOBY
                          (as that LANDS)
                    ... Not one present?  Ever?

                                  HAPPY
                    No way I m dying before someone 
                    gets me a damn Christmas present. 
                    So I ll figure a way out if you 
                    calm down and keep looking for the 
                    software, deal?

                                  TOBY
                    If we get out of this?  I swear I 
                    will buy you a Christmas present, a 
                    Chanukah present, and something for 
                    all seven pillars of Kwanzaa -- 


      INT. DINER - SAME TIME - INTERCUTTING:

      ON WALTER -- stressed to the max as he runs calculations -- 

                                  PAIGE
                    What re you doing?

                                  WALTER
                    Greater Good Analysis: do I try to 
                    save 2 exceptional people with the 
                    ability to change the planet, or 
                    accept that s not possible given 
                    time constraints and figure out a 
                    new way to save thousands of 
                    average people?

      She just looks at him -- words that don t compute -- 

                                  PAIGE
                    Are you kidding?  You save 
                      everybody.  A normal person tries 
                    to save everybody.

      He looks up.  For the first time, HELPLESSNESS in his eyes:

                                  WALTER
                    But I m not normal.                                                                                    34.


      He reaches out... and turns OFF the walkie, SILENCING Happy 
      and Toby s PANIC on the other end.  Stands up, stoic.

                                  CABE
                    What the hell are you doing?!

                                  WALTER
                    There s no way to resolve this.

      He EXITS.  EVERYONE S STUNNED.  Cabe starts dialing his cell:

                                  CABE
                    Calling the cops --

                                  PAIGE
                    You think the cops ll get there 
                    faster?  It s L.A.

      But he s off and making the call -- Paige looks to Sylvester 
      to do something, but he just stammers, scared, lost-- 

                                  SYLVESTER
                    I-- I didn t predict this -- 

      ON PAIGE: IT S ALL ON HER.  She BURSTS through the back door:


      EXT. SIDE STREET OUT BACK - CONTINUOUS

      -- Walter -- walking away -- Paige RUSHES OUT:

                                  PAIGE
                    Hey -- 
                          (she GRABS his arm)
                    Hey.  I understand what s going on:
                    You re doing what Ralph does when 
                    he doesn t understand how to fix a 
                    problem, he panics and shuts down -- 

                                  WALTER
                    Do I look panicked to you?

                                  PAIGE
                    Not until you said that.  When you 
                    don t know something, you feel like 
                    you don t know anything, because 
                    Knowing s the only value you have.  
                    But you can do this.

      He just stares, unreadable.  Has she gotten through?  Then:

                                  WALTER
                    Let me explain something to you.
                    Left brain: logic.  Right brain: 
                    emotion.  For all practical 
                    purposes, I have no right brain.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    35.

                                  WALTER (CONT'D)
                    Emotional speeches,  pep talks  -- 
                    they don t work on me.  They work 
                    on artists, musicians, waitresses -- 
                    people who re satisfied being 
                    underpaid to serve others.  

      Paige literally FLINCHES.  As usual, Walter wasn t trying to 
      insult her; to him it s merely a statement of fact:

                                  PAIGE
                    I get it, I m the dumb waitress. 

                                  WALTER
                    I never called you that.

                                  PAIGE
                    You don t think I wanted to do 
                    something else with my life? 
                    Something my son could be proud of?  
                    But I ll tell you one thing: I m 
                    smart enough to know people almost 
                    never get second chances to make up 
                    for something they should ve done.  
                    And if you let your friends die, 
                    you re gonna wake up with it 
                    everyday for the rest of your life.  
                          (beat)
                    I promise you that.

      ON WALTER.  Paige has no idea how much she just hit the 
      bullseye, but for reasons she couldn t possibly know about:

                                  PAIGE (CONT D)
                    Come back inside with me, Walter.

      He just stares.  And right when he s about to say  no  --

                                  RALPH (O.S.)
                    It stops and starts.

      RALPH at the back door.  She turns, confused:

                                  PAIGE
                    ... What, Honey?

      He points to a WATER TAP against the wall, drips of WATER 
      coming from the pipe.  CLOSE ON WALTER, as he looks at the 
      water, at the boy... drip... drip... drip... EVERYTHING SLOWS 
      DOWN AROUND HIM, even Paige... BUT NOT RALPH.  They meet 
      eyes.  Walter s again move at REM SPEED as it HITS -- and we:

      SNAP BACK TO SPEED -- Walter s already rushing back into the 
      diner, blowing right past her:

                                  PAIGE (CONT D)
                    Walter?                                                                                    36.


      INT. DINER - MOMENT LATER

      He BURSTS IN, ADRENALIZED -- Paige/Ralph on his heels:

                                  WALTER
                    The Sherman Oaks DWP s two miles 
                    away -- if we can t turn water off 
                    to their building, we ll turn it 
                    off to the whole district. 

                                  CABE
                    We re not shutting down water to an 
                    entire city -- What if there s a 
                    fire?  What about hospitals?

                      WALTERCABE
      -- Firetrucks have tanks, -- I need to get 
      Hospitals have back-up authorization -- 
      systems--
                                                  -- Walter, there s a protocol 
      --In the next 10 minutes?-- for this, I d have to go 
                                                    through the Mayor s office -- 


                                  WALTER
                    This is exactly what you did last 
                    time -- ask for help, then play the 
                      government card, and people end up 
                    dead.  Again.

                                  PAIGE
                    Again?  What do you mean again?

                                  CABE
                    Hey, sorry you don t like it, but 
                    I m the only one here with a 
                    federal badge, so I m the only one 
                    who gets into a municipal water 
                    facility.

      ON WALTER, knowing Cabe has him bested -- and THAT S IT: he 
      SHOVES CABE, much to Cabe s SHOCK, and everyone else s... 

                                  CABE (CONT D)
                    ... Watch it.

                                  WALTER
                    I m done doing what you say.

                      PAIGECABE
      Walter --Back off, O Neil--

                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    -- Or what?  You ll arrest me?

                                  SYLVESTER
                    Guys, we re down to 4% success --                                                                                     37.


                                  WALTER
                      Sylvester, stop spouting stats like 
                    a badge of honor!

      ON SYLVESTER: something strange.  Why s he almost... smiling?  
      Walter SWINGS at Cabe, who THROWS HIM on the floor  -- a 
      FIGHT ensues -- uncharacteristically, Sylvester SPRINGS TO 
      ACTION, pulls Cabe off -- Walter staggers up:

                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    The hell with you --  

      And he s OUT the door again, passing Paige, who s FRUSTRATED:

                                  PAIGE
                    Great!  He just came back! 

      And now it s clear, Sylvester IS smiling:

                                  CABE
                    The hell s so funny?

      VRROOOOM!  A car TEARS PAST the diner window -- 

                                  PAIGE
                    ... Hey... That s my car.
                          (pats her apron)
                    Where are my keys?!

                                  CABE
                          (pales, pats pockets)
                    My badge -- 

                                  SYLVESTER
                    I palmed it when I pulled you off 
                    and slipped it to Walter.  

      CABE and PAIGE react -- realizing what s just happened -- 

                                  PAIGE
                          (it was a code)
                    ...  Badge Of Honor ...

                                  CABE
                    ... Sonofabitch...

                                  SYLVESTER
                    People like us don t resort to 
                    violence unless there s logic 
                    behind it. 
                          (snatches up the walkie)
                    Guys, hold on!  Walter s on it -- 
                    just keep looking for the LAX 
                    software.                                                                                    38.


      INT. DATA CENTER - SERVER ROOM - SAME TIME

      ON TOBY/HAPPY on top of the shelves: water at their chests --

                                  HAPPY
                    Just breathe --

                                  TOBY
                    We ll have no choice but to 
                    breathe.  When you drown, CO2 fills 
                    your bloodstream and eventually 
                    we ll breathe in, even though we 
                    know there s no air under there--

      Happy PLANTS A KISS on Toby, LONG AND HARD to calm him down.  
      When she pulls away, he s STUNNED MUTE, dazed...

                                  HAPPY
                    We calm now? 
                          (he nods)
                    Good, gimme your belt!

                                  TOBY
                          (quickly undoes it)
                    ... Are we--?

                                  HAPPY
                    NO!  I need it for the door!

      She GRABS his belt, DROPS UNDERWATER -- 


      EXT. DWP SECURITY GATE - MINUTES LATER

      Walter SCREECHES to the GATE, flashes Cabe s badge at GUARD:

                                  WALTER
                    Deputy Director Cabe Gallo.  Your

                    need immediate access -- 


      INT. DATA CENTER - SERVER ROOM - SAME TIME

      Toby, almost at the ceiling, water at his neck, plugs a 
      server to a light-fixture outlet (only dry one left), as we 
      GO UNDERWATER to find Happy, having wrapped Toby s belt 
      around the door handle, pulls with all her might:


      INT. DWP - SAME TIME

      Walter RACES to the MAINFRAME S COMPUTERIZED CONTROL PANEL, 
      starts hacking into it, as we CUT TO:                                                                                    39.


      INT. DWP SECURITY GATE - SAME TIME

      The Guard sees MONITOR READINGS shut down.  Unsure, he dials:

                    Yeah, this is DWP Station 12.  Some 
                    guy s here flashing a badge and now 
                    the system s going haywire... 


      INT. DATA CENTER - SERVER ROOM - SAME TIME

      Happy EXPLODES to the surface, GASPING.  Water s 1/2 way up 
      Toby s neck -- he s running the last server on his laptop -- 
      she reaches for the ceiling, YANKS on a 3  piece of REBAR 
      until it BREAKS FREE -- swims back under with it, WEDGING the 
      bar between the door and molding, wraps the belt around the 
      sharp bar, leaving a  tail  to pull on.  As she PULLS... 

      Toby, nose pressed into 4  OF REMAINING AIR, holds up the 
      laptop/server to keep it dry: then...  LAX BACKUP  appears on 
      screen!  A PROGRESS BAR quickly fills -- software s 
      downloaded!  Toby SHOUTS into the walkie:

                                  TOBY
                    We got it!  We can land the planes!  

      He holds the computer above the water, a last effort to save 
      the planes -- a DEEP BREATH before he s engulfed --

      Walter TYPES FURIOUSLY, downloading the backup:

      everything she s got and... WHOOOOOSH!  THEY RE FORCED OUT AT

      Beat, then the VOICE that responds is entirely UNFAMILIAR:

                    10-17, is there an Agent Cabe Gallo

      EXT. DWP WATER STATION - DAY

      The COPS have Walter in CUFFS, are using his walkie:

                                  COP #1
                    Officer Tadych of the LAPD. I have 
                    a Walter O Neil in custody, he has 
                    your badge and says he s on 
                      assignment with you?

                                  CABE
                          (well, not exactly, but)
                    ... Yes.  Call the Federal Building 
                    on Wilshire, they ll confirm this 
                    detail, but do it in transit -- I 
                    need him back here A-SAP.

      The DINER PHONE has started RINGING.  Paige answers in BG:

                                  SYLVESTER
                    It won t matter: we lost our only 
                    chance to save the planes.  At 
                    least a dozen collisions, the 
                    rest ll probably head to the ocean 
                    to avoid ground casualties...

      They all TURN -- Paige is holding up the phone in excitement:

                                  PAIGE (CONT D)
                    It s Happy!  They re alive and on 
                    their way back with the software! 

      Off Cabe, WIDE-EYED -- 


      EXT. DINER - 15 MINUTES LATER

      CABE S SUV SCREECHES TO STOP in front, just as an LAPD COP 
      CAR does too.  Toby and Happy leap from the SUV, as Walter 
      emerges from the cop car -- tosses Cabe back his badge:

                                  WALTER
                    You re welcome.

      Before Cabe can respond, Walter heads right past him to Happy 
      and Toby, who holds up the laptop triumphantly...

                                  TOBY 
                    Seats back and tray tables up, 
                      everybody, these planes are as good 
                    as landed! 

      As they ENTER, Walter sees how Happy s carrying her shoulder:

                                  WALTER
                    Your shoulder s dislocated at the 
                      glenohumeral joint.

      INT. DINER - CONTINUOUS

      Walter pops open the laptop as everyone gathers round:

                                  CABE
                    So this is it?  We re getting the 
                    planes down?

                                  WALTER
                    Simple as e-mailing a file. 
                          (into walkie)
                    Brooks, I m sending you a bug-free 
                    version of the software -- all you 
                    have to do is open your e-mail and 
                    click a link.  Thurman, can you 
                    make sure he uploads it properly?

        THURMAN (V.O.; OVER WALKIE)BROOKS (V.O.; OVER WALKIE)
      No, but I can do it -- -- Hey, watch it -- 

      As Walter types away, the tension seems to LIFT a moment...                                                                                     43.

                    We... did it.  We actually pulled

      The MOMENT of unity... is SUDDENLY BROKEN as Walter springs 
      up and KICKS OVER his chair -- 

                                  PAIGE
                    What s wrong?

                                  WALTER

                    You re the genius, find another  
                    way -- 

                                  WALTER
                    What do you want me to do?  No 
                    place else on earth has the 
                    software.

      Ralph slowly puts a finger on a PLANE on Sylvester s chart.  
      Sylvester looks at him, then the plane... an EPIPHANY:

                                  SYLVESTER
                    You re looking in the wrong place, 
                    Walter!  It s not on earth!

                                  TOBY
                    What s not on earth?                                                                                     44.


                                  SYLVESTER
                    The software -- it s on the planes! 
                    They use a duplicate copy to 
                      communicate with the tower -- if 
                    they took off before this morning s 
                    update, then they still have the 
                    old, bug-free software on board!

                    A flight from Asia would ve taken 
                    off before the bad software 
                      downloaded.  Damn, Sylvester, 
                    that s a brilliant idea...

                                  SYLVESTER
                          (looks at Ralph, amazed)
                    Not sure it was mine, actually.

                                  WALTER
                    It won t work: we still have the 
                    same problem.  What we need is 7 
                    miles over our head and there s no 
                    way to get in touch with the people 
                    who have it. 

      The air is sucked out of the room, their brief hope GONE. 
      Frustrated, Walter turns away and looks to the WINDOW, as the 
      team THROWS OUT RANDOM IDEAS in B.G... their voices go ECHOEY 
      AGAIN as we PUSH IN ON WALTER, his eyes moving at REM SPEED, 
        calculating...  but he DOESN T have the answer...

      Then... VRRROOOMMM!  A FERRARI F-360 glides past out the 
      window.  WALTER S EYES track it and... THE FERRARI RAMPS TO 
      SLOW-MOTION MID-PASS... WALTER S EYES SNAP BACK AND FORTH AT 
      REM.  The Ferrari pulls into an EXOTIC CAR DEALERSHIP a block 
      away.  SNAP TO SPEED as Walter SPINS, to Happy:

                          (rolls eyes: again?!!!)
                    What the hell for?                                                                                    45.


                                  WALTER
                    I can waste time explaining 
                    something you won t understand, or 
                    you can trust that what I m 
                    thinking has the highest 
                      probability of working. 
                          (Cabe s uncertain: trust?)
                    At least I m not stealing it this 
                    time.

      Beat... then Cabe TOSSES his badge to Walter --

                    We don t need runways.  We re gonna 
                    to do the transfer while the 
                    plane s still in the air, barely 
                    off the runway.                                                                                    46.

                    The Bugatti window s 22" and your 
                    shoulder span s at least 25", you 
                    won't fit through.

                                  TOBY
                    Guess I m your huckleberry.

                                  WALTER
                    No.  I need you to find an Asian 
                    flight and profile the entire 
                    manifest -- we re looking for a 
                      daredevil, a maniac, the exact 
                    opposite of Sylvester.

                                  SYLVESTER
                    Hey -- 

                                  WALTER
                    Fine.  Come along.  At 240 mph.

                                  SYLVESTER
                    Hell no. 

                                  HAPPY
                    I can push through it, Walt.

                                  WALTER
                          (a beat, shit)
                    I guess we have no choice.  Get in.

      Happy puts her tools down, but we can see her shoulder s in 
      pain.  Ralph PULLS on Paige s sleeve.  She looks at him: a  
      MOMENT of understanding.  Something in his eyes she almost 
      never experiences.  Ralph nods...

                                  PAIGE 
                    You sure?
                          (Ralph nods again; 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    47.

                                  PAIGE  (CONT'D)
                            then, to Walter)
                    I ll go.

      Everyone turns to Paige.  Walter calculates: her, Ralph -- 

                                  WALTER
                    ... No.  

      Paige walks up to Walter, talks SOTTO so no one else hears:

                                  PAIGE
                    Look... he needs this.

                                  WALTER
                    There are easier ways to bond with 
                    your child.

                                  PAIGE
                    What about your  greater good 
                      analysis?   Isn t saving 10,000 
                    lives worth the risk?  You told me 
                    he won t need me much longer 
                    anyway... til then, the least I can 
                    do is set an example for him.  

      That LANDS on Walter -- she has his full respect.  Finally, 
      he nods.  Paige swallows, kneels in front of Ralph:

                                  PAIGE (CONT D)
                    Happy s gonna watch you while Mommy 
                    and Walter help the people in the 
                    planes, ok?
                          (as they HUG)
                    I ll be back soon.  I ll be okay.

      Ralph nods.  Paige gets into the car.  The cop cars spin 
      their cherries providing an ESCORT and... Walter PEELS OUT.  
      A beat, Sylvester looks to Ralph:

                                  SYLVESTER
                    Odds are high she won t be okay.

      Happy SLAPS Sylvester on the back of the head as CALL IN THE 
      CAVALRY by THE SHYS KICKS IN and we HARD CUT TO:


      EXT. LA SIDE STREETS/INT. BUGATTI SUPERSPORT - MOMENTS LATER

      The Cavalry -- aka: Walter and Paige.  KICK ASS POLICE ESCORT 
      races through LA streets.  Paige holds on TIGHT, terrified:

                                  PAIGE
                    This thing has airbags, right?

                                  WALTER
                    Yes, but at these speeds they re 
                    useless.                                                                                    48.


      Toby crackles through on the walkie: INTERCUT WITH DINER 
      where the gang hacks away at personal information -- a MAN S 
      DRIVER S LICENSE PHOTO appears:

                                  TOBY
                    Think I got somebody: Duncan 
                    Dupree.  5 foot six, 140 pounds. 
                    Flat feet kept him outta Army 
                    Rangers; couldn t follow dad onto 
                    St. Louis PD due to bad hearing; 
                    suspended in high school for a 
                    fight with the football team -- not 
                    one player -- the whole team.  This 
                    little man has something to prove.

                                  WALTER
                    Perfect.  Contact him.

                                  TOBY
                    How the hell do I do that?!

                                  WALTER
                          (as he s hanging up)
                    You have a 187 IQ, figure it out!

      Paige looks over at Walter, nerves spiking, grips the door:

                                  PAIGE
                    Something I don t get.  Someone ll 
                    email us the software as the 747 
                    flies over?  Won t it be going too 
                    fast to get a wireless signal from 
                    the plane?

                                  WALTER
                    ... No.  Because when it s 30 feet 
                    off the ground, you and I will be 
                    driving directly under it.

      Paige STARES at him: WWHAAAAAAT?!  MUSIC SWELLS and -- 

 END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    49.


                                          ACT FOUR


      INT. BUGATTI SUPERSPORT RACING THROUGH LA - RESUME:

      They SHOUT against the roar of SIRENS and the car ENGINE:

                                  PAIGE
                    YOU DIDN T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT 
                    GETTING UNDER A PLANE!  I THOUGHT 
                    WE WERE GONNA BE BEHIND IT!

                                  WALTER
                    That would be more dangerous, we 
                    could be crushed by the jetwash!  
                      Underneath is safer because the 
                    pressure will be equalized --

                                  PAIGE
                    I m just supposed to sit here while 
                    a plane practically lands on top of 
                    us?!

                                  WALTER
                    No... you re gonna be on the roof.

      Beat:

                                  PAIGE
                    What?!

                                  WALTER
                    You have to lean out onto the roof 
                    and hold up the laptop to maximize 
                    chances of getting a signal!  No 
                    signal, no software transfer!  No 
                    software transfer, the planes go 
                    down.

                                  PAIGE
                    This is... this is INSANE!

                                  WALTER
                    At these speeds the force would 
                    normally decapitate you, but Happy 
                    built a shield, so, my suggestion 
                    is... try to stay under the shield.


      INT. DINER - DAY

      Cabe on the phone, preparing for the worst -- 

                                  CABE
                    Foam the runway, foam the whole 
                    city for all I care --                                                                                     50.


      He turns to find RALPH listening -- AWKWARD BEAT, then Cabe 
      grabs a pie from the PIE FRIDGE, hands it to him:

                                  CABE (CONT D)
                    Here.  Everything s fine.

      And RUSHES OFF, leaving Ralph holding the pie, as we WHIP TO: 
          Toby/Sylvester/Happy working laptops -- over tinny speakers, 
      phones ring, then voicemails -- the calls END, next number s 
      DIALED -- as they talk, their eyes NEVER leave the computers:

                                  TOBY
                    We re not getting through to 
                    anyone, send me more phone numbers!

                                  SYLVESTER
                    Trying!  Hacking isn t really my 
                    thing -- there s 440 people on the 
                    flight, and they all have their 
                    phones off  cause they re on a damn 
                    plane! 

                                  TOBY
                    There s always some narcissist who 
                    doesn t think the rules apply to 
                    him or an overwhelmed mom traveling 
                    with kids who forgot to turn it off 
                    -- basic human nature.  A phone was 
                    left on somewhere --

                                  SYLVESTER
                    -- still won t get through at

      INT. PLANE - SAME TIME (INTERCUT AS NECESSARY WITH DINER)

      GORDON DOOLEY (68, shlubby salesman) reads SKYMALL.  His 
      PHONE buzzes.  Surprised, he pulls out an old flip-phone:

                                  GORDON (INTO PHONE)
                    ... Hello?

                                  TOBY (OVER PHONE)
                    Mr. Dooley, listen carefully, 
                    there s an emergency with your 
                    flight and I need you to bring your 
                    phone to the man sitting in 19A 
                      immediately.

                                  GORDON
                          (a beat)
                    Nice try, Sully.  See you at work, 
                    jagoff.

      He hangs up, reads.  The phone RINGS again.  Gordon answers:

                GORDON (CONT D)TOBY
      Listen, ya putz---- No you listen.  Get your 
                                                  fat ass to 19A or I ll tell 
                                                  your wife about the Asian

                                                  hotel room.  Got it, My Man?


      Gordon pales, SPRINGS from his seat and hustles over to 19A. 
      Hands the phone to... DUNCAN DUPREE, 30 s, WWE t-shirt, wiry 
      and lean: a spitfire with  little man syndrome  who's up for 
      anything:

                                  GORDON (CONT D)
                    I... I think this is for you?

      Huh?  Confused, Duncan takes phone --

                    Who s this?

                                  TOBY
                    Duncan, this is the federal 
                      government.  And today, you finally 
                    get to be the hero...


      INT. COCKPIT - MOMENTS LATER

      Captain Pike and Co-Pilot -- TENSE -- prepare for the worst:                                                                                    52.

                    There s been one clean water 
                    landing in the entire history of--

                                    CAPTAIN PIKE
                    -- we re running on fumes, there 
                    are no other cards to play here.
                    We tell the cabin once we re over 
                    water.  Black box is on; if you 
                    have anything to say to anyone... 
                    say it now.

      And then -- BANG BANG BANG! on the door --

                                  DUNCAN (THROUGH DOOR)
                    Captain!  Captain!  I know what s 
                    going on!  I need to talk to you--


      INT. PLANE CABIN - SAME TIME

      MALE AND FEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS pull Duncan from the door 
      and struggle to RESTRAIN HIM:

                        DUNCANFLIGHT ATTENDANTS
      No!  I can help!  I got a -- Hold him down! 
      call from someone talking to 
      the LAX tower, he says -- God, He s really strong --
      they ve lost communication 
      and control of the approach -- -- I ve got the zip ties!
      that s why you re not being 
      waved in to land -- I can 
      help you!!


      Passengers start FREAKING OUT -- then the cockpit door OPENS:

                                    CAPTAIN PIKE
                    Let him go.  Keep the passengers 
                    calm -- 
                          (to Duncan)
                    How do you know?

      Surprised, the Flight Crew lets Duncan go and RUSHES OFF as 
      Duncan hands Pike his cell:

                                  DUNCAN
                    I got a call.  Go ahead, Toby --


      INT. BUGATTI SUPERSPORT RACING THROUGH LA - INTERCUTTING:

                                  WALTER (INTO PHONE)
                    Actually, my names s Walter! 
                    Captain, if you do exactly what I 
                    say, everyone onboard will live --                                                                                      53.


                                    CAPTAIN PIKE
                          (rushes back to cockpit)
                    -- I m all ears, Walter -- 

                                  WALTER
                    You re carrying an uncorrupted 
                    version of Control Tower software. 
                    You need to e-mail it to me so we 
                    can get it downloaded at LAX.  Only 
                    way to do that is for you to get 30 
                    feet off the ground so I can grab 
                    your wireless signal.

                                    CAPTAIN PIKE
                    Where will you be?

                                  WALTER
                    Under you in a car going 240 miles 
                    per hour.  We re doing this at 
                    Santa Monica; we called ahead, 
                    Runway Two s been cleared. 

                                    CAPTAIN PIKE
                    I m right over Santa Monica, 
                    runways are short there and my 
                    minimum cruise speed s 209 knots -- 
                    we ll only have seconds to make 
                    that connection -- how do you know 
                    it ll work?

                                  WALTER
                    That s where Duncan comes in.

      Pike looks back to Duncan, who gives a slight smile:

                                  DUNCAN
                    I m Duncan.


      INT. PLANE PROPER - SECONDS LATER

      Duncan and the CO-PILOT race down the aisle -- on the move, 
      Duncan yanks a PORTABLE WIRELESS DEVICE from a guy s laptop:

                                  DUNCAN
                    I need this, thanks -- 


      INT. PLANE - BOWELS OF PLANE - SECONDS LATER

      As they hurry through the plane s belly, Co-Pilot grabs a 
      roll of DUCT TAPE, hands it to Duncan, points to something we 
      don t see:

                                  CO-PILOT
                    Right there... Good luck!                                                                                    54.


      Duncan just nods.  Co-Pilot takes off.  Duncan s alone.  
      Looks down at what we don t see... swallows hard, and RIPS 
      OFF a piece of the tape with his TEETH -- 


      INT. DINER - SAME TIME/INT. LAX CONTROL TOWER - SAME TIME

      WHIPPING THROUGH THE TOWER, we find BROOKS and 15-year-old 
      THURMAN, relaying to Sylvester -- 

                                  BROOKS (TO SYLVESTER)
                    Did you click the link we sent?

      ON Sylvester s laptop: plane  blips  head toward each other:

                                  SYLVESTER
                    Yes.   How long until the first 
                    planes hit?

                                  BROOKS
                      2 minutes, 52 seconds -- 


      INT. BUGATTI VEYRON - OUTSIDE S.M. AIRPORT - SAME TIME

      The police escort approaches the back gate to the runways -- 
      Walter sees the 747 approaching, flips a panel, and presses a 
      button: it s NOS!  Paige SCREAMS as Walter blows past his 
      police escort, FISHTAILING onto:


      EXT. RUNWAY/INT. BUGATTI - SAME TIME

      THE BUGATTI HITS THE RUNWAY!  Walter pulls on a jerry-rigged 
      cable: THE SHIELD that Happy built POPS UP ON THE HOOD -- 

                                  WALTER
                    NOW!  YOU CAN DO THIS!

      Paige, TERRIFIED, climbs out the window with the laptop, 
      holds it high above her head as...

      THE PLANE ROARS OVER HER, ALMOST CLOSE ENOUGH TO TOUCH!  SHE 
      SCREAMS AS WALTER HOLDS THE CAR STEADY RIGHT BENEATH THE 
      PLANE.  AND NOW, LANDING GEAR LOWERS, TO REVEAL, DEAR GOD... 

      DUNCAN CLINGING TO IT LIKE A BABY KOALA, THE WIRELESS DEVICE 
      DUCT-TAPED TO HIS BODY!  He s wide-eyed and windblown, but 
      gives Paige a stunned wave  hello  as the plane and car 
      streak down the runway, just a few feet apart:


      INT. COCKPIT - SAME TIME

      Pike HURTLES toward HOMES -- Co-pilot works the keyboard:                                                                                    55.


                  CAPTAIN PIKECO-PILOT
      8 seconds before we have to File almost ready, about to 
      pull up--send... sending now....


      EXT. RUNWAY/INT. BUGATTI - SAME TIME

      PAIGE -- one hand CLINGING DESPERATELY to the car, the other 
      clinging to the LAPTOP as... SHE SEES IT RECEIVE THE FILE!  
      COLLAPSES back into the car, Walter SEES the screen --

                                  WALTER
                    CLICK THE FILE THREE TIMES!

      She does... and the e-mail is FORWARDED TO LAX as the landing 
      gear RETRACTS, sucking Duncan back into the plane, which 
      BANKS upward, causing the Bugatti to shake! 

      Walter CUTS the wheel, HITS the air brake -- the Bugatti 
      SKIDS across the runway -- SKIIIIIIIIIIIIDS -- finally, 
      barely coming to... A SAFE STOP.

      BREATHLESS, Walter looks at a disheveled Paige... and says:

                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    You stayed under the shield.  Well 
                    done.

      With that, Paige PUKES out the window.


      INT. LAX CONTROL TOWER - SECONDS LATER

      Brooks and Thurman watch a PROGRESS BAR on the computer: 98% 
      99% 100%. Lights and screens POP AWAKE -- Brooks GRABS a mic:

                                  BROOKS
                    Mayday!  Mayday!  This is LAX Tower 
                    Control, communication s restored, 
                    we ll have you all safely on the 
                    ground in moments!  Confirm 
                    contact!

      SCORES OF RESPONSES: Thank God, Control/ We were sweatin  up 
      here!  Tower crew EXPLODES IN WHOOPS/HOLLERS -- Brooks throws 
      Thurman into a BEAR HUG -- as Thurman, spent, requests:

                                    THURMAN
                    Can I please go now?  My parents 
                    are prob ly really worried...


      INT. DINER - SAME TIME

      Happy, Toby, and Sylvester go NUTS!  Toby and Happy HUG... 
      when they PART, Toby says, meaningfully:                                                                                    56.


                                  TOBY
                    Merry Christmas.

      Happy GRINS as Sylvester musses Ralph s hair, points to the 
      laptop:  FILE UPLOADED. 

                                  SYLVESTER
                    Your mom did that...

      Ralph doesn t smile... but looks pleased.


      INT. BUGATI - SAME TIME

        Walter/Paige hear the celebration via Walkie.  She leans back 
      against the headrest, wiped out, delirious.  Looks over 
      Walter, who like Ralph, doesn t smile... but looks pleased:

                                  PAIGE
                    Good thing you didn t keep walking 
                    down the alley.

                                  WALTER
                          (a beat)
                    Good thing you came after me. 

      Off the two of them -- an unlikely team.


      EXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT - TARMAC - SUNSET 

      Against the glorious sunset, cop cars everywhere, cherries 
      spinning.  The WHOLE TEAM is being interviewed by Feds, as we 
      find... Cabe, who s been handed four envelopes of CASH from a 
      fellow agent -- turns to WALTER, who s scanning the crowd:

                                  WALTER
                    Where s the waitress?

                                  CABE
                    A cop took her and Ralph home.
                          (a beat)
                    You look disappointed.

                                  WALTER
                          (reveals nothing)
                    I think you have something for me.

      Cabe hands the envelopes to Walter, who checks: $50K each.

                                  CABE
                      Everyone s real happy with your 
                    work today.  So... Deal s a deal.

                                  WALTER
                    I want a share for Paige, that 
                    Duncan guy, and the Thurman kid.                                                                                    57.


      Cabe nods, he ll do that.  Walter turns to go without a word:

                                  CABE
                    Walter.
                          (Walter turns)
                    I m sorry about what happened 
                    between us... back in the day.  I 
                    lied to you.  I thought I was doing 
                    it for the right reason.  

                                  WALTER
                          (it s still a raw wound)
                    We killed people. 

                                  CABE
                    To save tens of thousands more...
                    but I m still sorry.

      Walter stares at Cabe.  Into him:

                                  WALTER
                    I believe you.  I also know the 
                    fact you re apologizing means 
                    you ve realized we re the key to 
                    your future.

      ON CABE, called out.  He nods, okay, here goes... 

                                  CABE
                    I was reassigned here to set up a 
                    new kind of Strategic Response 
                    Team, something game-changing.  
                    See, I can t train average agents 
                    to think like you, you re a 
                    different species.  Problem is, the 
                    bad guys are getting smarter too, 
                    so we have to fight them in a 
                    smarter way: they hit our banks, 
                      electrical grids, hospitals -- we 
                    cover everything from missing kids, 
                    to stolen nukes.  You d have the 
                    full resources and backing of the 
                    U.S. Government, clearance at the 
                    NSA, DOD -- 

                                  WALTER
                    This conversation s oddly familiar.

                                  CABE
                    Look... I didn't have as much 
                    autonomy then to keep my promises.  
                    I do now.  
                          (beat)
                    We can make a real difference, 
                    Walter... but I can t do it alone.  
                    And from what I know about you and 
                    your buddies, you can t either.                                                                                    58.


      Walter looks across the tarmac at his team, protectively:

                                  WALTER
                    Failure is not an option for people 
                    like us... if they aren t 
                      protected, they ll beat themselves 
                    up inside until they break.  

                                  CABE
                    They re beating themselves up 
                    already: What s their purpose?  Why 
                    were they given their gifts and put 
                    on this planet?  What I m offering 
                    you all... is the answer.

                                  WALTER
                    Very dramatic.

                                  CABE
                          (sincerely)
                    ... I m trying here, Walter.

      Walter stares.  And then, reaches into his pocket, pulls out 
      his NOTEPAD.  Tears off a PAGE with HANDWRITTEN SCRAWL.  
      Hands it to Cabe, who reads, confused...

                                  CABE (CONT D)
                    Fixed salaries, cars, a research 
                    Lab, full control over your hires,
                    and a yearly government grant to 
                    fund your...
                          (is he reading this 
                            right?)
                    ...  Immortality Project? 
                          (looks up)
                     When did you write this?

                                  WALTER
                    In the car after we left the 
                      warehouse.  You asked me what I was 
                    doing.

      ON CABE.  Stunned, can t help but CHUCKLE a little...

                                  CABE
                    You knew I d offer you a job...

                                  WALTER
                    Your badge said  Homeland Security 
                    Strategic Initiatives Division,  
                    that's a hell of a promotion, the 
                    kind that forces you to prove 
                    yourself quickly if you wanna keep 
                    it.  I assumed if we survived 
                    today... you d see we would be the 
                      "strategy."                                                                                     59.


                                  CABE
                          (heartened)
                    So... you trust me?

                                  WALTER
                      Absolutely not... but I don t need 
                    trust, I have leverage: this time 
                    your career depends on us.  You 
                    can t hurt me without hurting 
                    yourself, and you aren t dumb 
                    enough to hurt my friends, since 
                    you d end up the sole focus of my 
                      retaliation... and we all know how 
                    that goes. 

      Damn.  Rockstar.  And to our surprise, WALTER offers his hand 
      first.  A beat, then Cabe SHAKES.  As...

                                  CABE
                     Failure is not an option... 
                          (beat)
                    Has a ring to it.

      And Cabe rejoins his squad, as HAPPY, TOBY, and SYLVESTER 
      rejoin Walter.  A beat, Toby takes one look, and...

                                  TOBY
                    Your lips are parted and you re 
                    leaning slightly forward, 
                      primordial signs of desired 
                      communication.
                          (beat)
                    You have something to tell us.

      EXT. PHYSICAL THERAPY FACILITY - NIGHT

      VROOOM: The BUGATTI screeches to a stop.  Walter exits his 
      NEW CAR, admires it, then hurries into... 


      INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY FACILITY - MOMENTS LATER

      CLOSE ON WALKING BRACES, attached to a WOMAN S ARMS -- we 
      BOOM UP THEM to reveal a RED-HAIRED WOMAN.  This is PEG, 
      working with an encouraging THERAPIST.  Quietly, from a 
      distance, Walter watches in the doorway, a DOCTOR beside him:

                                  DOCTOR
                    She never quits.  No matter how 
                    sick she gets.

      Walter never takes his eyes off Peg.  So clear he loves her.                                                                                    60.


                                  WALTER
                    My sister isn t sick.  She s just 
                    stuck in a broken machine. 

      And walks off toward her, leaving the doctor somewhat 
      confused, as we PRELAP: 

                                  PEG (PRE-LAP)
                    Tell me what you re thinking, 
                    Wally...


      INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY FACILITY - PRIVATE ROOM - LATER

        A PHOTOGRAPH on the nightstand: 11 YEAR OLD WALTER and the 
      REDHEADED GIRL we ve been seeing, who we now understand is 
      PEG as a child... as we PAN TO ADULT PEG, in a chair, Walter 
      in a a chair too, pulled close... 

                                  PEG
                    ...  Cause you seem almost... 
                    happy.  And that s not like you.

      He pulls out his green file:  IMMORTALITY PROJECT.   Opens it 
      to show her charts, neuro-scans of a MOUSE BRAIN...

                                  WALTER
                    I ve been doing research for your 
                      condition.  Mapping a mouse s 
                      neurological path when he finished 
                    a maze.  I put a chip in his 
                    brain... and was able to download 
                    the memory.

                                  PEG
                          (stunned)
                    You put the mouse s memory... on a 
                    computer chip?

                                  WALTER
                    It gets better: when I removed the 
                    chip, he couldn t do the maze 
                    anymore.  When I put the chip back 
                    in, he found the cheese.
                          (as hopeful as we ve seen 
                            him)
                    Do you understand what that means?

      She looks at him, loving him for trying so hard, but scared 
      by the prospect of actually being hopeful about this...

                                  PEG
                    I m not a mouse, Honey.

                                  WALTER
                    No.  But you re not this broken 
                    body either.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    61.

                                  WALTER (CONT'D)
                    You re your consciousness, Peg.  
                    And when I get this right?  I ll be 
                    able to transfer a human brain s 
                    contents -- memory, thoughts, 
                    emotions -- when the body fails.  
                    To a healthier body, a robotic 
                    host, whatever. 
                          (beat)
                    I ll have made death and disease 
                    extinct. 

                                  PEG
                    Walter Patrick O Neil, ALS is my 
                    fight.  Don t put it all on you...

      But he is putting it all on him, and nothing s ever gonna 
      change that, as he looks at his sister with utter devotion:

                                  WALTER
                    No one else was there for me.  Mom 
                    or dad, other kids made fun of 
                    me... but you always believed in 
                    me. 
                          (beat)
                    Don t stop now.  Please.

      A TEAR rolls down her cheek.  Since her muscles have betrayed 
      her, she has to ask him to...

                                  PEG
                    Put my hand on your face.

      He does.  Her thumb gently strokes his cheek:

                                  PEG (CONT D)
                    You amaze me, Wally.  You always 
                    have. 

      He looks at his sister.  And says:

                                  WALTER
                    I m going to fix you.  
                          (beat)
                      I promise.

      HOLD.  As a KNOCK KNOCK takes us to -- 


      EXT./INT. GROUND FLOOR APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

      PAIGE, opening the door to her small, Deep Valley apartment:

                                  PAIGE
                    ... Walter?                                                                                    62.


                                  WALTER
                    Hi.  Um, sorry for coming by late-- 
                    I just wanted to... apologize for 
                    offending you today.  Twice.  That 
                    wasn t... decent.

        A vulnerability in him she hasn t seen.

                                  PAIGE
                    ... Thank you.  It s ok.

                                  WALTER
                    I also want to offer you a job.
                          (off her SURPRISE)
                      Government-funded problem solvers.  
                    You said you wished you could do 
                    something else with your life.  
                    Something greater.  Now you can. 

      Paige is stunned... trying to understand...

                                  PAIGE
                    ... why?  I m-- I m not a genius...

                                  WALTER
                    But you re raising one.  You know 
                    what to say when we re misbehaving, 
                    or upset.  Or scared.  The work 
                    we ll do requires interaction with 
                    the world.  With people.  Not our 
                    strong suit.
                          (beat)
                    We need an interpreter.  
                          (hands her a paper)
                    Salary plus benefits. 
                          (she reads amount, even 
                            more stunned)
                    Getting in that car wasn t your 
                    second chance... this is. 

      She looks at him, overwhelmed.  And in this moment, READS 
      HIM.  Her gift.

                                  PAIGE
                    ... for you, too?

      Walter looks down.  This is a story he tells almost no one.  
      It s awkward for him.  Unusual.  We PUSH IN ON HIM, for:

                                  WALTER
                    When I was 16, my Hacker name was 
                       Scorpion.   I chose it because a 
                      Scorpion s a docile creature by 
                    nature... but if it s pushed too 
                    far, it stings.

      She nods gently, yeah.  This next part s harder...                                                                                    63.


                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    Knowing I had that kind of power 
                    made me overconfident... so when 
                    Cabe came and asked me to develop 
                    tracking software to drop first aid 
                    packages to soldiers behind enemy 
                    lines, I did.
                          (beat)
                    One day I turned on the news and 
                    saw the live feeds of us dropping 
                    bombs on Baghdad... they were using 
                    my system to kill people.
                          (on Paige, STRUCK)
                    I d designed it for speed over 
                      accuracy... so 8% of the bombs were 
                      off-target by 100 yards.  Which 
                    means... over two thousand 
                    civilians died needlessly in 
                      hospitals, shopping malls... a 
                      kindergarten school... 

      ON PAIGE, eyes welling.  Heartbroken for him.  So softly... 

                                  PAIGE
                    You were... just a kid.

      He nods.  Right now, he looks like one.  Then...

                                  PAIGE (CONT D)
                    You know... I helped Ralph with a 
                    report on arachnids once?  There s 
                    another thing about scorpions...
                          (beat)
                    They re incredibly loyal to their 
                    family.  

      Walter can t quite meet her eyes.  And offers, gently...

                                  WALTER
                    If you don t want to fail your son, 
                    tell him to ignore any sentence 
                    that starts with  Normally.   Don t 
                    ever let him be scared of what he s 
                    capable of.  And it ll be hard for 
                    him to make friends.  Sometimes 
                    it ll feel like nobody in the world 
                    likes him.  Make sure he knows it 
                    isn t his fault... the word Prodigy 
                    comes from the Latin prodigium, a 
                    monster that violates the natural 
                    order.  You ll need to protect him.

                                  PAIGE
                    From who?

                                  WALTER
                    From everyone who isn t like him... 
                    and from himself.                                                                                     64.


      Just then, RALPH walks by in the background, smiles/waves:  

                                  RALPH
                    Hi, Walter.

      Paige... is STUNNED.  Turns back to Walter, GRATEFUL... 

                                  PAIGE
                    He s never smiled or waved at 
                    anyone before.  Ever.

                                  WALTER
                          (simply)
                    He recognizes one of his own. 

      Ralph puts on a video game, subtly pushes a controller across 
      the floor beside him -- an invitation. 

      Walter looks to Paige.  She nods.  Walter enters, gently sits 
      next to Ralph.  As they play...

                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    Can you pause your dreams, Ralph?

                                  RALPH
                    Yeah.

                                  WALTER
                    Ever rewind them?

                                  RALPH
                      Sometimes.

                                  WALTER
                    ... yeah.  Me too.

      During this, we ve been PUSHING IN ON PAIGE, watching, eyes 
      wet, feeling happier than she s felt since her son s birth: 
      he s finally made a connection to another living soul. 

      She smiles, a smile like a lamp turning on.  Walter turns 
      back to look at her, and she NODS: telling him nothing on 
      earth could stop her from taking that job.
