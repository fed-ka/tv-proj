      SOARING over verdant mountains, lush countryside... we think 
      we re looking at the Hawaiian landscape, until we crest a 
      BLUFF to reveal... A MILITARY BASE.  And a CHYRON locates us:

               CAMP CASEY, DONGDUCHEON, SOUTH KOREA 


      MUSIC -- MOMENTUM -- soldiers break to their vehicles and 
      mount up -- two armored HMMWV s and a US ARMY M1126 ICV 
      (Infantry Carrier Vehicle) STRYKER: an eight-wheeled, nine-
      passenger badass combat vehicle -- 

                                  MCGARRETT (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    -- the rest of the team will head 
                    to Naples, Victor s last known 
                    location.  Let s move -- 

      When Anton s led out, he and McGarrett lock eyes: mutual 
      hatred.  Anton s placed into the Stryker.  McGarrett climbs 
      in behind him -- rear ramp CLOSES -- the caravan pulls away --


      SOARING over the highway as the MILITARY MOTORCADE chews road 
      -- in column, Stryker number 2 --     


      --  Boom  is an understatement: out of nowhere, a Chinese-
      made WZ-9 ATTACK HELICOPTER DROPS DOWN AND FIRES AN HJ-8 ANTI-
      TANK MISSILE.  The lead VEHICLE is hit -- somersaults, on 
      fire -- SLAMS back to earth in a horrendous impact! 


      The KOREAN PILOT engages the RMS (Rocket Management System) --  

      PILOT S POV -- THE HEADS UP DISPLAY: Brackets the Stryker 
      heading off the road.  Fires four HIGH ENERGY MAGNETIC 
      ROCKETS.  WHOOSH! WHOOSH! -- WHOOSH! WHOOSH! 


      -- the rockets OPEN UP in front of the Stryker and DOZENS OF 
      BOMBLETS mushroom out, LANDING on the road -- they BOUNCE 
      across the asphalt -- 

      As it passes over the bomblets, the Stryker s ARMOR ATTRACTS 
      THE BOMBLETS, which JUMP toward the vehicle, MAGNETICALLY 
      CLAMPING TO ITS HULL AND SIDES --



      But the BOMBLETS DETONATE -- not shrapnel, but HIGH-ENERGY 
      PULSE BLASTS THAT SHORT OUT AND SHUT DOWN THE VEHICLE -- The 
      Stryker rolls fast, with another swerve, clips on the right 
      and TOPPLES ON ITS SIDE, SKIDDING HARD -- trailing SPARKS -- 


      For a moment, a split second really, all is still.  The 
      Stryker just sits there, like a crippled stagecoach about to 
      be attacked. 

      The chopper HOVERS over the downed vehicle as... three 
      EXTRACTION SOLDIERS fast rope to the ground --   H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 8.


      We re CLOSE on McGarrett -- dazed -- as he starts to pick 
      himself up -- CAMERA MOVES WITH HIM and as we REORIENT, now 
      realizing he s UPSIDE DOWN -- the roof of the Stryker has 
      become the floor -- 

      McGARRETT S POV -- BLURRING IN AND OUT: We see people getting 
      out of their cars, disoriented -- running scared -- and then 
      he sees the EXTRACTION SOLDIERS LAND around the vehicle -- 

      McGarrett reaches for Anton, grabs his flex cuffs and TORQUES 
      his wrist -- Anton WINCES -- McGarrett SHOUTS to his men: 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    MOVE OUT!  TAKE POINT, I GOT HIM! 

      -- he grabs an M-4 out of the weapons rack as -- 


      The three Extraction Soldiers move in on the Stryker --  
      WHAM: the back ramp flies open as McGarrett, his Driver, the 
      vehicle commander and the two MP s leap out, GUNS BLAZING.  
      As the MP s bound toward an outcropping of rocks, they re 
      SHREDDED -- the Vehicle Commander makes it and lays down 
      suppressive fire, killing one of the Extraction Team Members:

      CLOSE ON McGARRETT, crouched behind the downed Stryker -- 

      HIS POV - THE HELICOPTER: Hovering over the road ahead -- POV 
      WHIPS DOWN to one of the machine guns on the ground. 
      Shielding Anton from the attack, McGarrett runs over and 
      grabs the 240 -- aims it at the helicopter and OPENS FIRE 
      with a stream of tracers -- 

      THE HELICOPTER - AS BULLETS TEAR THROUGH ITS SIDE -- SMOKE 
      starts to billow and the chopper VEERS OFF over the tree 
      tops, damaged -- but it ain t over:

      Rounds PEPPER the ground around McGarrett -- he scrambles to 
      the other side of the Stryker, still pulling Anton -- Out of 
      bullets, McGarrett tosses the machine gun and draws a SIG .40 
      cal from his hip -- peers out -- UNLOADS on the last soldier 
      standing -- turning his back on Anton for a SPLIT-SECOND -- 
      when he wheels back, he finds Anton GONE -- scrambling away -- 
      grabbing a SIDEARM off the dead MP -- 

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)
                    NO!!!  DROP IT!!!

      -- but Anton WHIRLS, turns the weapon on McGarrett -- no 
      choice --  BLAM!  BLAM!  MCGARRETT FIRES FIRST -- shoots 
      Anton in the chest, into the body armor -- knocking him back 
      like the sack of shit that he is.  McGarrett rushes the body  
      -- checking the armor, finds the SECOND ROUND missed the 
      armor plate and punctured Anton s chest.  A last death gurgle 
      -- COUGHING BLOOD --  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 9.

      And that s it... Anton Hesse is DEAD.  

      ON McGARRETT.  Mind tumbling, knowing with gut-wrenching 
      certainty what this means -- as we PUSH IN ON HIM, backlit by 
      the flames, the bodies, destruction.  

      RIIIIING.  He whirls -- the PHONE -- where? -- there, on the 
      ground -- but McGarrett doesn t move.  Just STARES. The phone 
      sits there like a rattlesnake you do not want to go near.  
      But he has to:  

      Finally picks it up.  Hits  Answer.  Puts it to his ear.  
      Hand shaking.  A look of pure dread.  

                                  HESSE (V.O.)
                    What happened?  

      Impossible silence.  The worst moment of McGarrett s life.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Victor...

                                  HESSE (V.O.)
                    Put Anton on the phone. 

    A forever pause -- words catch in McGarrett s throat -- he 
      can t bring himself to speak -- 


      A MASSIVE USAF C-17 GLOBEMASTER TRANSPORT PLANE flies over 
      the Pacific -- beginning its descent towards the Hawaiian 
      islands.  OVER THIS, Elvis Presley's "Rock-A-Hula" --


      The C-17 hits the runway.  TRACK as it taxis to a stop.  The 
      cargo bay door lowers and McGarrett dramatically steps out, 
      DUFFEL over his shoulder.  On a mission.  Waiting for him is 
      a black Suburban with official plates -- and RICHARD FEENEY, 
      the Governor's young, eager Administrative Assistant:

                                    RICHARD
                    Aloha!  Commander McGarrett?

      He offers a hand but McGarrett doesn t stop.  Richard trails:

                                  MCGARRETT
                    I don t know you.   H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 11.

                                    RICHARD
                    Richard Feeney, I work for Governor 
                    Jameson.  She'd like a word.

      He gestures to SECURITY AGENTS in sunglasses waiting by the 
      Suburban.  Off McGarrett, knowing he isn t being asked -- 


      TRACKING ALONG the memorial structure spanning the mid-
      section of the sunken battleship.  Richard and the agents 
      lead McGarrett past THE WALL OF HONOR.  Names of men entombed 
      here.  One stands out -- "S. McGARRETT."  His grandfather.  
      McGarrett stares, confronting his family's legacy.  

      Up ahead, a LONE FIGURE approaches to meet him -- GOVERNOR 
      PAT JAMESON, a rather beautiful woman in her early 40 s; 
      local Hawaiian with a Washingtonian s backbone, she s a 
      unique mix of brilliance, grace, and compassion:

                                  GOVERNOR JAMESON
                    Thank you for seeing me, Commander.  
                          (offers a hand; he shakes)
                    I m so sorry for your loss.  There 
                    are no words to make this easy.  

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Is this about the investigation?

                                  GOVERNOR JAMESON
                    We re doing everything we can.  We 
                    have alerts out across all the 
                    islands. 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    All due respect, you're not going 
                    to find Victor Hesse with 
                      roadblocks and search warrants.  
                    He s gone underground until he can 
                    find a safe way to leave the 
                    island.  Now why am I here? 

                                  GOVERNOR JAMESON
                    I d like to help you get what you 
                    came for. 
                         (off his look)
                    ... let s walk.

      And they do... against the endless ocean horizon... 

                                  GOVERNOR JAMESON (CONT D)
                    You know as well as I do: When 
                    people think of us, it s beaches, 
                    Luaus, and Mai-Tais -- that goes 
                    for the wallets in Washington, 
                    until I reminded them our strategic   
                      importance hasn t changed since 
                    World War Two: these islands were

                    the early warning and first line of 
                    defense against invading armies, 
                    only now we do it with 
                      international terrorists -- to say 
                    nothing of the drug smugglers, 
                    organized crime, human trafficking 
                    and prostitution -- it all comes 
                    through here first.  Except we 
                    can t just close the roads and 
                    bridges when someone pulls the 
                    alarm -- we re surrounded by water 
                    in case you haven t noticed, and if 
                    the number eight arms dealer on 
                      Interpol s watch list can just slip 
                    in undetected and murder a police 
                      officer... it s time for a game-
                    changer.
                         (stops walking) 
                    Your father s death was a wake-up 
                    call -- I can t afford to wait for 
                    the next appropriations bill to 
                    pass: I'm putting together a task 
                    force.  I want you to run it.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    ... you don t even know me.

                                  GOVERNOR JAMESON
                    I know your resume.  Annapolis. 
                    Navy SEALS.  Four years as a 
                    special investigator.  Then five 
                    with Naval Intelligence.  I can't 
                    think of anyone bett--

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Okay, lemme stop you right there: 
                    I ve been tracking Victor Hesse for 
                    five years.  His reach is far and 
                    wide, his sources are well hidden -- 
                    the man s a ghost, like I ve never 
                    seen in my career -- if he was bold 
                    enough to surface, I promise you 
                    he s already planned an exit 
                    strategy and he knows I know it -- 
                    which means I can barely even 
                    afford the hour it ll take to bury 
                    my father, let alone stand here 
                    talking to you.

      With that, he turns and starts to go... 

                                  GOVERNOR JAMESON
                    According to the Director of Naval 
                      Intelligence, you ve taken extended 
                    leave -- I assume that s because 
                    the military isn t in the revenge 
                    business?

      That STOPS him.  He turns back, eyes narrow.    H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 13.

                                  GOVERNOR JAMESON (CONT D)
                    Well I am.  And going up against 
                    Hesse as a vigilante is a mistake.   
                    At worst, it ll get you killed -- 
                    at best, incarcerated -- either 
                    way, your father will have died for 
                    nothing.  So what I m offering you 
                    isn t just common sense, it s a 
                    chance to go get the sonofabitch... 
                    with complete immunity and means.  

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Lady, I m not a cop.

                                  GOVERNOR JAMESON
                    I m not talking badges and sirens. 
                    I m talking results.  A federalized 
                    unit empowered by the Patriot act, 
                    with full blanket authority to hunt 
                    big game and get  em the hell off 
                    my island.  Your rules, my backing, 
                    no red tape.  
                          (beat)
                    And I promise you, Commander, what 
                    you see with me is what you get.

      He looks at her, steps closer -- shakes his head:

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Here s what I see: an election year 
                    coming up and a politician who 
                    needs the PR -- who s willing to do 
                    whatever it takes... including 
                    bringing me here to Pearl Harbor, 
                    where my grandfather was killed -- 
                    knowing I d have to walk past his 
                    name on that wall -- the same name 
                    my father gave me -- and feel 
                    compelled to fulfill my family 
                    destiny.  That about right?  

                                  GOVERNOR JAMESON
                          (beat; a touch of emotion 
                            now)
                    None of that makes me feel any less 
                      responsible.  

      And he sees she means it.  A real person here.  But it 
      doesn t change McGarrett s resolve:

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Pass.  

                                  GOVERNOR JAMESON
                    Just think about it.  Please. 
                    Mahalo.

      She hands him her card, goes.  McGarrett can t deny he s a 
      little impressed by her.  But fuck it.  He starts to move --  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 14.

      McGarrett wheels -- as CHIN HO KELLY (50s) approaches, Ex-
      Honolulu Police Detective turned Federal Security Guard.  
      Something FAMILIAR to McGarrett, he SOFTENS... 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    I know you...

                                  CHIN
                    You better: Chin Ho Kelly.  I 
                    worked with your father in the 7th.  
                    Back in the day, he made me go to 
                    your little league games when he 
                    was working.  I was your biggest 
                    fan.

      Chin pulls McGarrett into a BEAR HUG; McGarrett GRINS:

                                  MCGARRETT
                      I remember.  You were very loud.

                                  CHIN
                    Big lungs.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    And good ears.

                                  CHIN
                    Yeah, sorry about that.  Old habit 
                    from my last job.  You know... see 
                    and hear everything.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Looks like you've moved on to 
                    greener pastures.

                    Thanks for putting it that way.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    I m sorry, I didn t m--

                    -- no, you re right.  Let's just 
                    say the Honolulu PD and I had a 
                      disagreement over my job 
                      description.
                          (beat)
                    Your father understood.  He was 
                    very good to me after I was let go; 
                    stayed my friend and I know it cost 
                    him something.  Only wish I could 
                    pay some of that loyalty back.  But 
                    now that you're here, maybe you can 
                    do something.

                    I hear the brilliant minds calling 
                    the shots put a Haole on your 
                    father's murder investigation.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    What do you know about this guy?

                                  CHIN
                    Not much.  Word is he's fresh meat 
                    from the mainland, which means he 
                    has no clue how the island works.


      The man they're talking about, DET. DANNY WILLIAMS, is parked 
      outside a palatial ocean view gated estate in Diamond Head.  
      Danny s ex-Baltimore PD, real working man in paradise.  Only 
      guy on the island without a tan and always looks like he 
      slept in his clothes.  Next to him, in the passenger seat, 
      sits a brand new stuffed animal -- a PINK BUNNY RABBIT.  He 
      skims the McGARRETT CASE FILE as he talks on a cell:  

                                  DANNY 
                    -- I need a warrant write-up for a 
                      surveillance wire on a suspect in 
                      connection to the James McGarrett 
                    murder.  Suspect name is Frank 
                    Doran... D-O-R-A-N...   
                          (the gates start to OPEN)
                    Terrific, call me back -- 

      He hangs up and gets out, greets the 7-YEAR OLD GIRL walking 
      down the driveway, wearing a backpack and carrying a small 
      cage with a REAL PET RABBIT inside.  This is Danny's daughter 
      GRACE WILLIAMS.  The only reason he smiles occasionally.

                    'Morning, sunshine.

                                  GRACE
                    Hi daddy.

                                  DANNY
                    Who's this?

                                  GRACE
                    Mr. Hoppy.  Stan bought him for me 
                    for animal show and tell.

      Danny keeps his emotions in check, but we see the hitch, 
      feeling like he's always coming up short.

                                  DANNY
                    That's great... we better go.  We 
                    don't want Mr. Hoppy to be late for 
                    his first day of school.  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 16.

      As they get to the car, Danny manages to toss his Pink Bunny 
      into the back seat before Grace can see it.  They drive off -- 
      BAGPIPES FADING IN OVER --


      Funeral procession.  Street lined with civilians and cops in 
      dress blues, saluting.  McGarrett and his younger sister, 
      MARY ANN McGARRETT, walk behind the hearse carrying their 
      father's flag-draped coffin.  Mary wears shades, we presume 
      to hide her grief.  Multiple bracelets and nose stud betray 
      her punky roots.  There s silent TENSION between them -- 
      troubled history now forced back into the present.

      McGarrett, for his part, seems anxious, distracted, eyes 
      scanning faces.  Does not allow himself time to grieve.  
      Further up the road -- standing apart from the cops -- 
      McGarrett notices CHIN HO KELLY paying his last respects.


      Belly of the Punchbowl Crater.  Post funeral.  Last MOURNERS 
      drift away.  As McGarrett accepts condolences from a couple, 
      he gets distracted by Mary, too-loudly FLIRTING with a group 
      of cops.  LAUGHING.  It could not feel more inappropriate. 

      McGarrett leaves the couple and heads for his sister, gently 
      but firmly takes her by the arm:

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Scuze us, Gentlemen -- 

      He pulls her to a secluded spot.  She YANKS her arm away from 
      him, like an annoyed teenager -- this goes to  11  FAST:

                          MARYMCGARRETT
      What -- -- what d you take?
      -- nothing --  -- take off your sunglasses-- 
      -- No --  -- you were never a good 
                                                  liar -- 
      -- you really wanna do this 
      now?  Here?-- well, we could wait 
                                                    another three or four years 
                                                  before we see each other 
                                                  again.

      She takes off the shades to look him in the eye.  Yeah, she s 
      stoned -- and PISSED:

                                  MARY
                    It s a skill, you know?  Starting a 
                      conversation this badly.  How 
                     bout:  Hi, Little Sister, how s 
                    LA?  How s work?   Y know, like a 
                    person -- not a military drone --

                    to justify anything to you?

                                  MCGARRETT
                    I dunno, Mary, maybe because I m 
                    the one who let dad go to his grave 
                    believing you were his perfect 
                    little girl.  You called me when 
                    you got arrested, you called me 
                    when you went to rehab -- and I m 
                    glad you did, but don t pretend I m 
                      overstepping my bounds now when I m 
                    trying to keep you from 
                      embarrassing yourself.  
                          (then)
                    How s LA?

                                  MARY
                          (struck, quietly)
                    ... traffic sucks....

                                  MCGARRETT
                    How s work.

                                  MARY
                    Got fired.  

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Sorry.

      For a beat, it s quiet.  Mary exhales and sits on a bench.  
      Pause, then McGarrett sits beside her.  Staring at the gave. 

                                  MARY
                          (sad smirk)
                    Last time we were alone with dad 
                    together was mom s funeral... guess 
                    this is how we do family reunions.  

      Hear the pain in that, but anger too.  He stares off.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    He wanted me to tell you... that he 
                    loved you, Mar.  That he should ve 
                    said it more.  And he was sorry.

                    For what?  Shutting down 
                      completely?  Shipping us away when 
                    we were teenagers?  It s a little

                                  MARY
                    "Champ?"  And he apologized?  
                    You sure it was dad?

                                  MCGARRETT
                    It wasn t a normal apology.  It was 
                    like a... confession.

      She knows her big brother won t rest til he s solved this...

                                  MARY
                    You re gonna get the guy who killed 
                    him.  Aren t you. 

      He looks up at her.  His eyes say  yes.   And her voice 
      CRACKS a little, a thousand emotions pushing to the surface -- 

                                  MARY (CONT D)
                    Do me a favor?  Hurt him.  

      Brother and Sister lock eyes: at least this they agree on. 


      A TAXI rolls up.  McGarrett gets out, in civvies, duffel in 
      hand.  Been a long time since he's laid eyes on the place.  
      Ducks under the crime scene tape to the backyard -- finds an 
      old PLANTER by the back door.  Underneath there's a KEY --  


      Catherine emerges from the front doors of her building, 
      passes under the caption on the building -- US NAVY CENTRAL 
      COMMAND HQ, US FIFTH FLEET.  We are in the Persian Gulf -- 
      hot, bright and everything a desert tone.  Once clear of the 
      building she dials -- RINGING -- then:

            A $49-a-night-park-by-the-door nestled in the lush Palolo 
      Valley.  Neon blinks VACANCY.  McGARRETT pulls into the 
      parking lot -- JUMP CUT TO ROOM 47.  He KNOCKS.  A beat -- 
      the door opens: DANNY.  Sees McGarrett, case file in hand:

                                  DANNY
                    What do you want?

                    You requested a wire put on someone 
                    named Frank Doran.  Tell me about

      Beat: against his instincts, Danny lets McGarrett in -- 


      Real shithole near Ewa Beach.  Meth labs and white trash.


      Danny catches up to McGarrett, says low, sharp:

                                  DANNY
                    Cowboy.  Slow down...

      They approach the front door -- HEAR shouting inside -- two 
      people fighting -- then suddenly, the door opens and Doran's 
      girlfriend storms out, catching our heroes off-guard.  This 
      is JAYCEE, ex-arm candy turned sun bleached junkie. Danny 
      instinctively GRABS her, slaps his hand across her mouth, 
      stopping her from warning --


      Jaycee BITES Danny's hand -- breaks free -- runs back inside:

                                  JAYCEE
                    Cops!


      Our heroes duck the assault -- but not before Danny drops, 
      bleeding, GRAZED in the shoulder.  As McGarrett makes his way 
      over -- Doran unloads on a side window: GLASS EXPLODES.  
      Doran splits into a side alley -- 

                                  DANNY
                    Go!  Get him!


      DORAN -- RUNNING -- FAST, FRENETIC -- blazes across the alley 
      -- a wild dash into a neighbors house -- SHOULDER CRASHES 
      through the front door -- McGarrett chases after him -- 


      -- Doran busts from the house, leaving a trail of blood.  
      McGarrett on his heels -- they emerge from the alley -- 
      running across Kuhina Street -- Cars SKID -- Doran looks back 
      -- sees McGARRETT thirty yards behind -- Doran FIRES over a 
      car, McGarrett can't fire back -- he's got no bullets --

      TOURIST and uses her as his shield -- 

                                  DORAN
                    PUT YOUR GUN DOWN!

      As McGarrett puts down his gun -- BLAM!  DORAN COLLAPSES.  
      DEAD.  McGarrett, stunned, turns to where the shot came from -
      - and there's Danny.  Shaken.  McGarrett grabs the screaming 
      Woman and holds her as MUSIC RINGS OUT TO:


      Hectic aftermath.  Movement everywhere.  HPD CRUISERS and 
      CORONER arrive.  Danny is getting patched up by EMS.


      As the EMS finish bandaging Danny s arm, he sees McGarrett 
      exit and hand Chen-Chi off to two HPD Officers --

                    with her parents and a couple 
                    hundred refugees, but when she got 
                    here, she was traded to Doran --

                    That girl in there, she s someone s 
                    daughter too.

                    What if she was yours?  Is there 
                    anything you wouldn t do?  To hunt 
                    down the sonofabitch that did that 
                    to her?  And kill him?

      And despite his indignation, his instinct to flee, Danny 
      can t argue this one.  McGarrett comes closer -- 

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)
                    You don t have to like me -- but 
                    right now?  There s no one else to 
                    do this job.

      EYE-LOCK.  Off this stalemate: 


      MINUTES LATER, and McGarrett and Danny, now WEARING the 
      oversized shirts, leaning against their car eating shaved ice  
      -- looking RIDICULOUS and annoyed -- as people pass and grin.   
      McGarrett notices a 7-year old GIRL staring at them.  Looks 
      at her.  She keeps staring.  His eyes say:  What? 

                                  LOCAL GIRL
                    Are you a policeman?

                                  MCGARRETT
                    No.

                                  LOCAL GIRL
                    You look like a policeman.

      McGarrett lowers himself to the girl.  Eye-to-eye.  Offers 
      his uneaten shaved ice:

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Go away. 

                                  LOCAL GIRL
                    I don t like cotton candy.

                                  DANNY
                    I got something you might like... 

      He reaches into the backseat of his car.  Hands the girl the 
      pink bunny he bought for Grace.  She LIGHTS UP:   H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 39.

                                  LOCAL GIRL
                     Thanks!

      And takes off, thrilled.  McGarrett throws Danny a look: 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    You always carry around pink bunny 
                    rabbits?

                                  DANNY
                    What, you don t?

      -- and now CHIN exits the shack, sees our heroes, LAUGHS.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    You better have a name.  


      KONO KALAKAUA (23) shreds a long, MASSIVE wave.  The woman is 
        spectacular.  Not just because she's got wave cred and fills 
      out a wetsuit, but homegirl's got serious akamai (smarts).  
      Our heroes watch her from the beach, wowed...

                                  MCGARRETT
                    That's your niece?

                                  DANNY
                    She s very... talented.

                                  CHIN
                    Kid s off the charts: speaks 4 
                      languages, including Japanese and 
                    Mandarin.  2nd degree black belt --  

      ON KONO, in the mix with a half dozen guys, all vying for the 
      same set.  She takes off, has the inside track --  

                                  CHIN (CONT D)
                    -- and then there's surfing.  Had 
                    offers to compete, but all she ever 
                    wanted was to wear a badge.  
                    Graduates the police academy in a 
                    month... unfortunately she's my 
                    niece, which means the HPD will 
                    never take her seriously.    H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 41.

      Kono gets to her feet first -- drops down -- carving a BOTTOM 
      TURN at the base of the wave -- carves back up the face and 
      lines up to shoot the barrel... but ANOTHER SURFER suddenly 
      DROPS IN on her.  Kono YELLS at him to pull out.  He ignores 
      her -- and she EATS IT.  Pummeled in the washing machine -- 
      finally bursts to the surface.  Pissed, she paddles in...

                                  MCGARRETT
                    You sure about this?  She's got no 
                    street experience.

      Kono -- on shore now -- rushes up behind the surfer -- 

                                  KONO
                    Ho brah -- !!
                          (the guy turns; she SLUGS 
                          HIM HARD)
                    Think twice next time you wanna 
                    drop in on someone s wave.  

      She makes tracks, stops: surprised to see Chin.  Kisses him:

                                  KONO (CONT D)
                    Uncle...!

                                  CHIN
                    You had it, Water Woman.  Double-

                    Kono, meet Commander Steve 
                    McGarrett and Detective Danny 
                    Williams.

                                  MCGARRETT
                          (as they shake)
                    You got a nice left hook.

                                  KONO
                    Nah, Man, that was a love tap.

                                  DANNY
                          (chuckles; to Chin)
                    I think I found my Cinderella.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Your uncle tells me you're 
                      graduating from the police academy 
                    next week.  How d you like to earn 
                    a little extra credit before you 
                    do?

      She looks at Chin, then back to McGarrett, intrigued:  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 42.

                                  KONO
                    I'm listening...

      And as our latest team-member s brought into the fold:



      Golden sunset.  They emerge onto the deck, staring out at the 
      water... McGarrett clearly deep in thought... 

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)
                    So you ever gonna tell me what 
                    Danno means?

                                  DANNY
                    Maybe.  If you tell me what s in 
                    the box.  

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Truth is... I don t know yet.  All 
                    I know it was important enough to 
                    be the last thing my father said.      
                          (then)
                    Right now... it s just a puzzle. 

      Danny sees the pain, the confusion in McGarrett.  Offers:

                                  DANNY
                    Me and Grace... we love puzzles.  

      McGarrett stares, grateful.    H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 44.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    You re a good father. 

                                  DANNY
                    ... yeah, well.  I don t know 
                      sometimes... guess there s three 
                    ways of looking at that.  I might 
                    just be stupid enough to get killed 
                    chasing some scumbag meth head... 
                    and then what kind of father would 
                    I be?  Or maybe I m just a selfish 
                      sonofabitch...            
                       (beat, with some humility)    
                    ... cause truth is, I need this.  I 
                    wanna do what I m good at... and be 
                    reminded I m good at what I do.  
                    And if that means having to put up 
                    with your twisted belief that 
                    you re never wrong, so be it.           

      McGarrett sort of grins, appreciating the honesty...

                                  MCGARRETT
                    ... so what s the third?

                                  DANNY
                    Even though I do tell myself this 
                    isn t permanent... it s Grace s 
                    home now.                            
                          (beat)                      
                    And my job s to make it safe.  

      That RESONATES with McGarrett.  Words his dad lived by.  He 
      raises his longneck in a toast.  They CLINK glasses -- a nod 
      of mutual determination.  Then, his cell RINGS.  He answers:

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Yeah.

      FADE IN:



      AERIAL: AS WE RAMP ACROSS THE ISLAND and pick off money 
      shots: the resorts in Waikiki -- Honolulu financial District  
      -- Chinatown -- Aloha Tower -- Waimanalo Polo Field -- the 
      high stakes Banzai pipeline -- Dole Plantation -- and 
      finally, landing on an outrigger canoeist battling the surf.  
      The day has begun.  And it's damn near perfect.


      A large, six-bay, heavy-duty truck and trailer repair 
      facility near the airport.  Welcome to the unglamorous side 
      of the island.  The part tourists seldom see.  FOLLOW KONO as 
      she enters the Manager's Office -- 


      As McGarrett bursts from the back door -- He HEARS an ENGINE 
      FIRE UP, TIRES SCREECHING -- SANG MIN IN A VAN, BARRELING 
      TOWARD HIM!  McGarrett FIRES at it -- windshield SHATTERS, 
      tires explode -- Sang Min loses control and SLAMS into the 
      side of a container.  

      McGarrett is THERE, pulling Sang Min out of the driver's 
      seat... as Danny, Chin and Kono arrive.  That's when they 
      HEAR BANGING from inside the container Sang Min hit -- 

      McGarrett OPENS the back door to find... The container's 
      filled with terrified Chinese refugees.  Off this -- 


      Danny and Kono coordinate with HPD now on scene.  The Samoans 
      are loaded into patrol cars.  REFUGEES into buses.  Nearby, 
      an HPD CRUISER rolls up.  McGarrett OPENS the passenger door 
      for Chen Chi, leads her over to...   H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 51.

      HER PARENTS.  Who immediately embrace her, overwhelmed, tears 
      flowing.  McGarrett takes a step back, watching the emotional 
      reunion.  He glances over, meets eyes with DANNY across the 
      yard.  Shared victory.  Off the family reunited, we PRE-LAP:

                                  SANG MIN V.O. (RECORDING)
                    -- I can have your family here 
                    within a week. 


      On the cut, McGarrett BURSTS out of the manager's office -- 
      finds Danny -- they MOVE together, fast -- 

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)

                                  MCGARRETT
                    -- he put Hesse and Elstin on a 
                    cargo ship headed for China --




      Here comes the HPD cruiser they borrowed. McGarrett burying 
      the accelerator -- driving like a madman.


      -- they come in hot.  McGarrett hits the brakes. Our heroes 
      scramble out and down the pier -- only to find it empty. 
      McGarrett stops a passing DOCK WORKER -- 

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)
                    There s supposed to be a ship here.

      Off their frustration, adrenaline pumping, CAMERA RAMPS BACK, 
      leaving them alone on the empty pier, as we --

      deep cerulean blue --

      Grim, silent.  Eyes scanning for the ship.  Then, Danny s

      am ominous sound the underscores how life-or-death this is --

                    Shut up.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    I m not messing with you, Man.  You 
                    don t have to be embarrassed -- 

                                  DANNY
                    I m not embarrassed, just drop it --

                                  MCGARRETT
                    -- why can t I think it s cute --?

                                  DANNY
                    -- I don t want you thinking about 
                    it at all.  It s between me and my 
                    daughter.

                                  DANNY
                    No, the blood s rushing to my head, 
                    from the -- from the altitude.  
                          (off McGarrett s grin)
                    Leave me alone.  

      SUDDENLY -- OVER the headphones:

                                  COAST GUARD PILOT
                      Commander, I have a visual.  Three 
                    o'clock.

      McGarrett looks out, and there s the container ship just 
      ahead.  It's a big one.  15,000 TEU (Twenty-foot equivalent 
      unit).  Forty foot shipping containers stacked 6 high.


      The Jayhawk BANKS HARD, heading for the ship -- 

                                  COAST GUARD PILOT (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Container ship Emma Maersk, this is 
                    Jayhawk 25 calling you on channel 
                    16, over.


      NO RESPONSE -- the pilot tries again:

                                  COAST GUARD PILOT (CONT D)
                    Captain Emma Maersk, you are 
                    ordered to alter your course and 
                    return to port.  Do you understand, 
                    over?

      Long, crackling silence.  McGarrett and Danny meet eyes: 

                                  DANNY
                    Looks like we re being ignored.

                                  MCGARRETT
                          (to the pilot)
                    Get us as close as you can!


      The Pilot swoops in low.  McGarrett and Danny take off their 
      helmets, SLIDE OPEN the cargo door, YELLING over the engine:

                                  DANNY
                    How do you wanna do this?!

      In response, McGarrett LEAPS.  Hits the container, rolls onto 
      his side -- a perfect military parachute landing fall (PLF).

                                  DANNY (CONT'D)
                    Of course.

      Danny hesitates -- no choice really -- JUMPS too:


      -- and hits the deck, smashing his left arm on a large valve.  

      As McGarrett runs to him: BANG BANG!  They immediately take 
      on gunfire.  CREW MEMBERS with AK-47 s rush the deck --  

      McGarrett and Danny return fire, covering each other as they 
      weave through the narrow passageways between containers.  And 
      our guys are dead-on shots, as one-by-one they pick off the 
      crew -- leaving only Hesse and Elstin.  The hunt is on.   

      At the end of the passageway, Danny breaks left -- going 
      after Elstin, McGarrett right -- going after Hesse. 

      Eltsin is SHOT in the ankle, goes down, tries to get up but 
      Danny is THERE to disarm him -- using his knee to keep him 
      down, ties on the flex cuffs:

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    Don t make me shoot you again.

      MEANWHILE: McGarrett, in full pursuit -- reloading as he 
      ducks for cover -- sees movement up ahead.  Heads for it.  
      Weapon aimed.  Eyes over the sight.  Comes around a corner -- 
      rushing the container -- nobody.  Then -- BLAM!  BLAM!  
      There s Hesse, climbing the side of a container.


      As the Captain kills the engines, the huge ocean swells begin 
      to rock the slowing vessel as McGarrett climbs the container 
      after Hesse.  As he crests the top: BANG!    H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 58.

      Hesse FIRES at him -- McGarrett catches a rung before falling 
      -- but not before losing his Sig -- it CLATTERS to the deck, 
      slides away.

      Hesse races off.  McGarrett gets his wind and regains footing 
      -- accelerates after Hesse -- across container roofs.  Never 
      breaking stride.  Six foot gap ahead.  Hesse LONG JUMPS it.  
      McGarrett's right there -- jumping --

      As Hesse raises his CZ-TT .45.  BLAM!  McGarrett's leg 
      explodes crimson just as he TACKLES HESSE -- Hesse s gun 
      slides away as they both SLAM down on the container top -- 

      Adrenaline forces McGarrett on through the pain -- they 
      stagger up -- brutal HAND-TO-HAND -- on unsteady footing -- 
      exchanging punishing blows -- there's also the matter of 
      Hesse being a master at mixed martial arts, which he breaks 
      out to great effect on McGarrett.  Meanwhile: 

      The .45 skitters across the container roof -- back and forth  
      -- propelled by the motion of the ship -- McGarrett goes DOWN 
      -- Hesse pulls a knife from his pocket -- that's when 
      McGarrett sees it -- the .45 -- just sitting there at the far 
      end of the container -- the rocking of the ship about to 
      slide it back -- But there's no time -- Hesse is advancing --

                                  MCGARRETT
                    You should know something about 
                    your brother...

                                  HESSE
                    What about him?

      McGarrett buys himself an extra second.  All the time he 
      needs: the .45 slides back -- lands in McGarrett's reach --

                                  MCGARRETT
                    He died the same way you did.

      BLAM!  Hesse is blown backwards -- off the container -- off 
      the ship -- into the churning Pacific.  Holy shit!  McGarrett 
      slowly gets to his feet.  Body wracked.  Leaking blood.  His 
      gun hand drops to his side as he steps to the edge of the 
      container and looks down.

      Hesse never surfaces.

      Overhead, the chopper circles.  Coast Guard cutters approach.  
      McGarrett sees Danny leading Eltsin below.

                                  DANNY
                    What do you want me to do with him?

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Book 'em, Danno.

      Danny drills him with a look -- though, with a smirk:  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 59.

                                  DANNY
                    What d I tell you about calling me 
                    that?


      Sitting in the sand, staring out at the water are McGarrett 
      (crutches beside him) and MARY.  He s just filled her in -- 
      she s, upset, trying to make sense of it: 

                                  MARY
                    ... I don t understand... 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    When I opened the box, there were 
                    these photos... and a key to dad s 
                    desk. I found an envelope inside 
                    with all these weird things: an 
                    opera ticket, postcards from Osaka -

                                  MARY
                    -- what are they?

                                  MCGARRETT
                    I don t know.  But he kept them for 
                    a reason. 
                          (then, the kicker)
                    Mar, the photos were taken at a 
                    crime scene.  Of mom s car.  The 
                    date she died was written on them.  

      Sledgehammer.  Mary s eyes -- blinking -- what?

                                  MARY
                    What do you mean --

                                  MCGARRETT
                    She didn t die in a car accident.  
                    Mom was murdered. 
                          (beat: her SHOCK)
                    A car bomb.  I think Dad believed 
                    it was meant for him.  That s why 
                    he was apologizing on the phone.

      She s stunned silent.  Mind tumbling.  

                                  MARY
                    Who-- who wanted to kill him?  I 
                    mean, why would--

                                  MCGARRETT
                    I don t know yet.

      And we watch her brain perform the impossible backflip of re-
      examining her father, her life, in a nanosecond:  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 60.

                                  MARY
                    ... why didn t he just tell us the 
                    truth?

                                  MCGARRETT
                    We were kids.  

                                  MARY
                    So he sent us away... to protect 
                    us?

      McGarrett stares: yeah.  Mary looks off.  For a long beat, 
      she s quiet.  Then, softly:

                                  MARY (CONT D)
                    All those years he let me hate him 
                    for that.  

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Maybe hating him... was the 
                    sacrifice he lived with.  So we 
                    could grow up without being afraid. 

      And that brings it right to the surface for her.  Eyes well, 
      as she stares at him... 

                                  MARY
                    Except now I m scared for you. 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Don t be.  
                          (beat, thoughtfully)
                    This is where I belong... I think 
                    it s why I spent so much time 
                    running away from it. 

      And she sees he means it.  Their look HOLDS. 

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)
                    Whatever happened.  Why it 
                    happened.  I m gonna find out.   
                    I promise you.

                                  MARY
                    You don t owe me anything.  I m the 
                    one who should be--

                                  MCGARRETT
                    -- no.                   
                          (warm smile)

      The dam breaks and she takes his hand.  The first time 
      they ve been really connected, maybe ever.  As we POP WIDE: 
      brother and sister, sitting side-by-side as waves CRASH:   


      Commotion.  A LIFE GUARD ATV blazes by.  Arrives at a crowd 
      gathering around a FEMALE LIFEGUARD who just pulled someone 
      out of the water -- got him breathing again: it's Victor 
      Hesse.  Anemic and dehydrated.  Despite the bullet hole in 
      his shoulder and loss of blood, he tries to get up.  

                                  FEMALE LIFEGUARD
                    Sir, please, you shouldn t move. 
                    You ve been shot. 

      Hesse pushes her out of the way.  Gets to his feet and cuts 
      across the sand -- 


      Outside he finds the first VALET on duty --  

                                  HESSE
                    I need a taxi.
