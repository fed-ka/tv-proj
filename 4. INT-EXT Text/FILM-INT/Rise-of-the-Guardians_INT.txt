We glimpse a familiar-looking RED JACKET and CAP with white
trim on a coat hanger just as a pair of tongs SLAM a block of
ice onto a stone work table--
IN QUICK CUTS: A CHAINSAW shears the block in half, spraying
ice. North lifts up the chainsaw revealing a massive tatoo
on his arm, the word NAUGHTY clearly visible.
Three ELVES huddle in a doorway around a plate of cookies,
each licking their own tasty morsel.
NORTH (O.S.)
Still waiting for cookies!
As North crosses the background, the elves lower the cookies
from their mouths, their faces frozen in fear.
The elves duck out of the way as North launches himself
across the floor on his rolling chair -- CLOSE as his huge
HAND gropes furiously among his WORK TOOLS, finally grabbing
a miniature HAMMER. As North's humming along with his music,
delicately CHISELING into the ice, we see a second arm sleeve
tatoo, the word NICE clearly visible--
His INTENSE BLUE EYE magnified in a JEWELER'S EYEPIECE -- a
delicate SCULPTING TOOL cuts fine details into the ice--
His hands place the finished piece on a curving ICE TRACK: An
ice LOCOMOTIVE. It belches ice vapor and chugs down the
track, picking up speed--
NORTH
Yes!
North's hand grabs a cookie from a plate held up by the two
Elves.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 4.
One of the elves gives his cohort a look and points to the
plate as it chews with a mouth full of food, to which it then
unfurls its tongue and lets the half eaten morsels spill out
onto the plate.
NORTH
Ah, finally!
He takes a bite and leans toward the ice track. He chuckles
as the train hits a loop, and launches off a ramp into midair
-- then WINGS unfold -- JET ENGINES sprout and ignite and the
train lifts off the track--
Suddenly, the DOOR is thrown open by one of North's concerned
YETIS, sending the flying ice locomotive skidding across the
floor in pieces.
YETI
Arghbal...
NORTH
Ach!
The yeti cries out covering his mouth in shame. North cries
out, devastated. The yeti, equally emotional, lets out
another whimper. North looks down at the broken toy and
takes a moment to collect himself.
NORTH
How many times have I told you to
knock?
YETI
Warga blarghgha!
NORTH
What...? The Globe?
North leaps up -- draws a HUGE SCIMITAR from its sheath and
HEADS OUT--
A sea of tiny BELLS on the heads of panicking elves part as
North's huge boots stomp through.
NORTH
Shoo with your pointy heads. Why
are you always under boot?
He pushes his way past a couple of his YETI WORKERS --
they're looking up in fear at -
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 5.
THE GLOBE OF BELIEF
Covered with LIGHTS blanketing the continents. But North
notices that all at once, HUNDREDS OF LIGHTS suddenly go out.
NORTH
What is this?
Now MORE LIGHTS, in GREATER NUMBERS, as if something is
snuffing them out by the thousands. North's concern grows.
NORTH
(TO YETI)
Have you checked the axis? Is
rotation balanced?
YETI
(SHRUGS SHOULDERS)
Wardle bawddrel.
Before the Yeti can finish, a WIND whips up from out of
nowhere -- North stares in outrage as a blanket of SWIRLING
BLACK SAND, crawls over the lights, and shrouds the ENTIRE
GLOBE in inky DARKNESS--
The elves scurry in a panic, then all at once the BLACK SAND
WHOOSHES UP off the Globe -- rushes up through the ceiling as
the remaining sand bursts into a puff of smoke and dissipates
into the air --
As the wind dies, the scattered pieces of debris settle to
the ground, and the globes lights come back on, North whirls
to see a HUGE SHADOW flash across the floors and curving
walls of his fortress. It quickly disappears, leaving
nothing but the distant ECHO of...LAUGHTER?
North is frozen, looking up into the darkness, gravely:
NORTH
Can it be?
(then calls off)
Dingle!
A group of elves step forward gleefully pointing to
themselves, as if they're all "Dingle". The excitement
quickly turns to confusion.
NORTH
Make preparations! We are going to
have company.
North reaches out for a large EMERGENCY LEVER, TWISTS and
PRESSES IT--
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 6.
The Globe pulses with ENERGY, which lights up and ZOOMS UP
the AXIS SHAFT toward the roof--
A little fairy, carrying a coin, flies above the head of a
sleeping child. She quickly ducks under the pillow and comes
out the other side with a tooth in hand.
Dozens of tiny FAIRIES flit about. Teeth are filed away in
tiny wooden drawers. Coins are handed out.
TOOTH (O.S.)
Chicago, Sector 6 -- 37 molars, 22
bicuspids, 18 central incisors.
Moscow, Sector 9 -- 22 incisors, 18
premolars: Uh oh, heavy rain
advisory!
(BEAT)
Des Moines, we've got a cuspid at
23 Maple. Head out!
A hive of activity, and at the center a winged figure barks
out orders like a harried air-traffic controller. This is
TOOTH. A Mini Tooth Fairy flies up to Tooth as thousands of
tiny MINI TOOTH FAIRIES continue their work behind them.
TOOTH (O.S.)
Wait!
And suddenly everything stops. Tooth whips around, and we
finally see her beautiful FACE.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 7.
She's holding up a little tooth, and gazing at it with dreamy
adoration. The surrounding fairies tweet with excitement.
TOOTH (CONT'D)
It's her first tooth. Have you
ever seen a more adorable lateral
incisor in all of your life?!
(GASPS)
Look how she flossed!
The fairies' tweets turn to concern, turning Tooth's
attention to North's AURORA SIGNAL stretching across the sky.
She gasps, and flies off like a rocket toward the source of
the signal, accompanied by a few of her ranking fairies.
NORTH (V.O.)
My fellow Guardians - It is our job
to watch over the children of the
world, and keep them safe - to
bring wonder, hope and dreams.
And so, I've called us all here for
one reason, and one reason only -
the children are in danger.
Much of this we hear over the following...
We pull out from the face of a sleeping child to reveal a
stream of sand swirling overhead. It's a dream and it's taken
the shape of a child playing soccer.
We FOLLOW the Dreamsand stream out his window and up into the
sky where we see DOZENS of strands of sand descending to
earth. Keep following up, through majestic CLOUDS...
...to reveal a small, GLOWING GOLDEN CLOUD of Dreamsand
shimmering among the clouds, trailing the golden threads.
The strands are being controlled by a small portly figure,
THE SANDMAN. Suddenly, North's emergency signal zips by. The
Sandman turns to look and his eyes narrow, visibly concerned.
Sandy closes his eyes and in an instant the Dreamsand cloud
suddenly SWIRLS around him, changing form into a small
BIPLANE, with Sandy in the cockpit. He BARREL ROLLS the
plane into a dizzying dive through the spectacular cloudscape
and flies off into the distance.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 8.
NORTH (V.O.)
An enemy we have kept at bay for
centuries has finally decided to
strike back. We alone can stop
him.
Much of this we hear over the following...
A few EASTER EGGS pop up out of the ground; their little legs
carry them out of the way of a fast approaching object.
Speeding along through a subterranean tunnel, we can barely
keep up with a DIMLY-LIT FIGURE as it races at blinding
speed, leaping and zigzagging through a series of TUNNELS --
Sandy's biplane circles the massive chamber, leaving trails
of Dreamsand.
NORTH (O.S.)
Cookies? Eggnog, anyone?
BUNNYMUND (O.S.)
Oh, this better be good, North.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 9.
TOOTH (O.S.)
(to her fairies)
Montreal, sector six: ten
premolars, eight incisors and
twelve canines. Steer clear of the
wild goose migration.
NORTH
Sandy, thank you for coming.
Sandy descends from the plane and floats to the ground. He
joins North, Bunny and Tooth as they walk through the Globe
Room. Sand glyphs appear above Sandy's head communicating
that he is busy and has a lot of work to do.
NORTH
(TO SANDY)
I know, I know, but I obviously
wouldn't have called you all here
unless it was serious.
North, Bunny, Tooth and Sandy reach the center of the room.
Tooth does her best to shush her mini-fairies.
NORTH (CONT'D)
The Boogie Man was here - at the
Pole.
North points to the globe. The other Guardians turn to look.
TOOTH
(SHOCKED)
Pitch? Pitch Black? Here?!
NORTH
Yes! There was black sand covering
the globe.
BUNNYMUND
(CONFUSED)
What, what...what do you mean black
sand?
NORTH
And then a shadow!
BUNNYMUND
Hold on, hold on, I thought you
said you saw Pitch.
NORTH
Well, ah, not exactly...
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 10.
BUNNYMUND
Not exactly? Can you believe this
guy?
Bunny turns to Sandy, who shrugs while forming a Dreamsand
question mark above his head.
BUNNYMUND
Yeah, you said it, Sandy.
Bunny goes back to painting one of his Easter eggs.
NORTH
Look, he is up to something very
bad. I feel it, in my belly.
BUNNYMUND
(his eyes narrow)
Hang on, hang on, you mean to say,
you summoned me here THREE DAYS
BEFORE EASTER - because of your
belly? Mate, if I did this to you
three days before Christmas--
TOOTH
(to her fairies)
Argentina. Priority alert! A
batch of bicuspids in Buenos Aires.
NORTH
Please. Bunny. Easter is not
Christmas.
BUNNYMUND
Here we go...
North grabs Bunny's painted egg, casually juggling it in his
hand as he walks off. Meanwhile Sandy, who is being served
eggnog by a yeti, suddenly notices something high above.
BUNNYMUND (O.S.)
(LAUGHS)
North, I, I don't have time for
this. I've still got two million
eggs to finish up.
The moon rises into view, high up in the ceiling; its rays of
light begin to shine brightly through as they cascade down
the walls of the globe room.
NORTH (O.S.)
No matter how much you paint, is
still egg!
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 11.
Sandy points to the moon unsuccessfully to get the others'
attention.
BUNNYMUND
Look, mate, I'm dealing with
perishables. Right. You've got
all year to prepare.
TOOTH
(to her fairies)
Pittsburg, boy eight, two molars.
Saltwater taffy.
Sandy puts his fingers in his mouth to whistle, a silent
musical note forming above his head.
NORTH
(TO BUNNY)
Why are rabbits always so nervous.
BUNNYMUND
And why are you always such a
blowhard!
TOOTH (O.S.)
(to her fairies)
Ontario, sector nine: five canines,
two molars, and fourteen incisors.
Is that all in one house?
Sandy waves a sand flag above his head, pointing and jumping
up and down as the moonlight continues to fill the room.
NORTH
(turning his attention)
Tooth! Can't you see we're trying
to argue.
TOOTH
Sorry, not all of us get to work
one night a year. Am I right,
Sandy?
Sandy tries to signal with a golden arrow, pointing toward
the ceiling, but to no avail as the others continue their
bickering. Sandy thinks Tooth has noticed for a split
second, but then -
TOOTH
(to her fairies)
San Diego, sector two! Five
incisors, a bicuspid and a really
loose molar on stand-by.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 12.
BUNNYMUND
(MOCKING)
Come on, mate, Pitch went out with
the dark ages. We made sure of
that - remember?
NORTH (O.S.)
I know it was him. We have serious
situation!
BUNNYMUND (O.S.)
Well, I've got a serious situation
with some eggs.
TOOTH (O.S.)
Hey, I hate to interrupt the, "We
work so hard once a year club" but
could we concentrate on the matter--
Sandy can't take it anymore, grabs an elf by his hat, and
vigorously shakes it's bell. The other Guardians are finally
silenced and all turn to look at Sandy, who points up, a sand
crescent moon forming above his head. The dizzy elf staggers
away. Finally the others turn to see the shaft of moonlight
as it concentrates on the circle between them.
NORTH
Aah! Man in Moon! Sandy, why
didn't you say something?
Sandy gives him a deadpan stare, Dreamsand smoke shoots out
his ears.
NORTH
(to Man in Moon)
It's been a long time old friend!
What is big news?
Everyone looks to the center of the intense spot of
moonlight, the light ebbs away, leaving a dark spot --
-- which resolves into the shadowed silhouette of PITCH. The
Guardians look on, stunned.
BUNNYMUND
It is Pitch.
North pats his belly and gives Bunny a look.
NORTH
(back up to the moon)
Manny...what must we do?
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 13.
In answer, the shadow of Pitch disappears and the circle of
moonlight intensifies and SHRINKS, concentrating further
illuminating an ORNATE SYMBOL on the floor, at the center of
their circle. The symbol rises out of the ground revealing a
large gem at the head of a pillar.
TOOTH
Ah, guys, you know what this means?
The moons light suddenly refracts through the gem casting
light all over the chamber.
NORTH
(AWED)
He's choosing a new Guardian.
BUNNYMUND
What?! Why?
NORTH
Must be big deal! Manny thinks we
need help!
BUNNYMUND
(ANNOYED)
Since when do we need help?!
TOOTH
I wonder who it's gonna be?
A Dreamsand Four-Leaf clover forms above Sandy's head.
TOOTH (CONT'D)
Maybe the Leprechaun?
BUNNYMUND
Please not the groundhog, please
not the groundhog.
Then A BRIGHT FLASH, a rush of WIND - and a FIGURE resolves
over the central pillar: slight, hooded, bearing a familiar
hooked STAFF.
NORTH
Jack Frost.
The Mini-Teeth all sigh and swoon as the Guardians stand
there, stunned.
BUNNYMUND
Ah, I take it back! The
Groundhog's fine!
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 14.
TOOTH
(caught admiring Jack)
Well, ah, as long he helps to
ah...to protect the children,
right?
BUNNYMUND
Jack Frost!? He doesn't care about
children! All he does is freeze
water pipes and mess with my egg
hunts. Right? He's an
irresponsible, selfish...
NORTH
Guardian.
This stops Bunnymund in his tracks.
BUNNYMUND
Jack Frost is many things, but he
is not a Guardian.
As we turn toward the face of the hooded figure.
DISSOLVE TO:
SEQ. 600 - SNOWBALL FIGHT
Jamie plays with a TOY ROBOT as DRAWINGS AND CHARTS of
mystery creatures hang on the wall behind him: UFO's, aliens,
Bigfoot, you name it. There's even a drawing of Jamie flying
in midair on his sled.
JAMIE (O.S.)
...I did this jump and it was
amazing and I slide under a car and
it was awesome! Then I was flying
down this hill and I was like
whoosh, whoosh, whoosh through all
these cars, and then the sled hit
this, this thing, and I was like
way up in the air.
He mimes flying in the air with his robot, then CRASHING to
the bed as Sophie and their dog sit listening--
JAMIE
-- and then BAM! The sofa hit me,
and, and see?
(opens mouth, tries to say
`my tooth came out!)
Ah hoo hay ow!
We reveal JAMIE'S MOM in the room. Sophie LAUGHS and tries
to stick a finger in the gap in his gums.
JAMIE'S MOM
Alright you, tooth under your
pillow?
Jamie sets the TOY ROBOT on his nightstand, then grabs a
stuffed rabbit next to his pillow to reveal a CAMERA AND
FLASHLIGHT.
JAMIE
Yeah. I'm ready.
JAMIE'S MOM
Now don't stay up trying to see
her, Jamie, or she won't come.
JAMIE
But I can do it this time! You
wanna help me, Soph? We can hide
and see the Tooth Fairy!
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 26.
SOPHIE
(CRAZED)
Hide, hide, hide, hide!
Jamie's Mom picks Sophie up off the bed and lifts her over
her shoulder. Their dog gets up and begins licking Jamie's
face.
JAMIE'S MOM
Uh uh, straight to bed now, mister.
JAMIE
Mom...
...We see Jack Frost, outside, hanging upsidedown watching
them through the window. A pang. The glass frosts over.
Dreamsand floats into a window, where CUPCAKE is in bed,
hugging a stuffed unicorn in her sleep. The Dreamsand swirls
over her head, and morphs into a little girl riding a
unicorn. The girl smiles at the lovely dream as it flies
around the room.
Then the room darkens as a wispy, shadowy figure with a
familiar laugh crawls out from under the bed, and rises up.
It's Pitch. He notices Cupcake's dream.
PITCH
Ohhhh, I thought I heard the
clippity-clop of a unicorn. What
an adorable dream!
His face softens, seemingly moved...
PITCH
(leans down to Cupcake)
And look. At. Her. Precious
child. So sweet, so full of hope
and wonder. Why, there's only one
thing missing...a touch of fear.
Pitch reaches into Cupcake's dream, and touches a bony finger
to the unicorn. It turns ashen and black, and disintegrates.
Cupcake flinches in her sleep. Pitch snickers, delighted.
PITCH
Hahaha! That never gets old!
Pitch swirls the Dreamsand around and it all turns into black
corrupted Nightmare sand.
PITCH
Feel your fear. Come on. Come on,
that's right.
The black sand morphs into a horrific, shadowy bucking horse -
a NIGHTMARE.
PITCH
Yesss. What a pretty little
Nightmare.
Gleefully, he grabs the Nightmare's mane --
PITCH
Now, I want you to go tell the
others the wait is over.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 28.
-- and sends it out the window, where it joins a posse of
other Nightmares coursing through the streets. They take off
and fly into the night sky.
TOOTH (O.S.)
(to a fairy)
Tangiers! Incivie du haut, 421 rue
de Barat! Allez!
The sack flies out of the portal and lands on the floor. In
the darkness, Jack hears --
NORTH (O.S.)
He's here.
Jack struggles out of the sack to see two elves staring at
him.
TOOTH
(to another fairy)
Walla Walla, Washington. We've got
a trampoline mishap at 1340 Ginger
Lane.
NORTH
Quiet.
He then looks up to see North and Sandman looking down at
him. The Tooth Fairy is surrounded by a dozen hovering tiny
fairies who come and go as she blurts out orders.
T0OTH (CONT'D)
Canine, lateral and central
incisor. Ouch!
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 31.
North clears his throat. They all turn to a bewildered Jack.
NORTH
Hey, there he is! Jack Frost!
As North holds out his arms to welcome Jack, a Dreamsand
snowflake appears above Sandy's head.
JACK
Wow, you gotta be kidding me.
Two Yetis suddenly grab Jack by the shoulders and lift him up
onto his feet.
JACK
Hey, hey. Whoa, put me down.
NORTH
I hope the yetis treated you well?
JACK
Oh, yeah. I love being shoved in a
sack and tossed through a magic
portal.
NORTH
Oh, good! That was my idea! You
know Bunny, obviously.
JACK
Obviously.
Bunny stands off to the side, grumbling with his arms
crossed. Jack suddenly notices the MINI TOOTH FAIRIES
hovering near him, staring and twittering.
NORTH
And the Tooth Fairy?
Before Jack can answer, she's gliding toward him.
TOOTH
Hello, Jack. I've heard a lot
about you. And your teeth.
JACK
My, my what?
TOOTH
(moves in way too close)
Open up! Are they really as white
as they say? Yes!
(GASP)
(MORE)
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 32.
TOOTH (CONT'D)
Oh, they really do sparkle like
freshly fallen snow.
Several swooning Mini Teeth flutter around a confused Jack,
batting their lashes and screaming like crazed Beatles fans.
Tooth collects herself, and...
TOOTH
Girls, pull yourselves together...
Let's not disgrace the uniform.
NORTH
And Sandman.
(sees Sandy is snoozing)
Sandy! Sandy! Wake up!
Sandy bolts up awake and steps up to Jack, smiling.
JACK
Hey! Ho! Anyone wanna tell me why
I'm here?
The WISP OF DREAMSAND above Sandy's head morphs into a
BARRAGE OF IMAGES.
JACK
That's not really helping. But
thanks, little man.
(TO OTHERS)
I musta done something really bad
to get you four together.
Jack walks away from the group, frosting an elf with a tray
of cookies as it marches past, then turns around.
JACK
Am I on the naughty list?
NORTH
(CHUCKLES)
On naughty list? You hold record!
But no matter. We overlook. Now
we are wiping clean the slate.
JACK
How come?
BUNNYMUND
(more to North)
Ah, good question.
NORTH
How come? I tell you how come!
Because now...you are Guardian!
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 33.
Off Jack's confusion, yetis light CEREMONIAL TORCHES with a
WHOOSH. Elves leap from columns, unfurling homemade,
celebratory BANNERS as they descend. Jack brushes off a few
baby teeth who try to present him with a necklace made of
paper snowflakes.
JACK
What are you doing! Get, get that
offa me!
Jack's voice is drowned out by the sounds of horns and drums.
NORTH
This is the best part!
AN ELF MARCHING BAND strikes up, marching into the room. Two
yetis move Jack on to a designated spot on the floor.
Jack looks down to find an elf pointing at his bare feet.
The elf then directs his attention to two approaching elves,
carrying a pair of ceremonial boots. Jack's confusion
escalates.
JACK
Huh?
A Yeti hands North an old large book. North blows off the
dust, opens it, and begins clearing his throat. Jack
clenches his jaw as he scans the room: The Mini Teeth
continue to fawn, Sandy's smiling, Bunny's apathetic, and
North looks on with pride.
Jack suddenly SLAMS his staff down, sending a blast of FROST
and WIND across the room. The torches go out and everything
stops.
JACK
What makes you think I want to be a
Guardian?
North bursts out in laughter holding the book in his hands
then stops and looks to Jack, stone faced.
NORTH
Of course you do!
(to the elves)
Music!
The elves blare the trumpets again. Celebration!
JACK
No music!
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 34.
The music peters out again. An elf throws his trumpet to the
ground and storms off. North, displeased, glowers.
JACK
Look, this is all very flattering,
but ah...you don't want me. You're
all hard work and deadlines, and
I'm snowballs and fun times. I'm
not a Guardian.
BUNNYMUND
Yeah, that's exactly what I said!
TOOTH
Jack...I don't think you understand
what it is we do.
Tooth swoops in and turns Jack's attention to the massive
globe behind him.
TOOTH
Each of those lights is a child.
Jack looks up at the Globe, taking in the enormity of this.
North suddenly moves to Jack's side.
NORTH
A child who believes. And good or
bad, naughty or nice, we protect
them.
(BEAT)
Tooth...fingers out of mouth.
We cut back to discover that Tooth is examining Jack's teeth.
TOOTH
(REMOVES FINGERS)
Oh, sorry. They're beautiful.
Jack moves away from the Globe and back toward the center of
the room.
NORTH
Okay, no more wishy-washy! Pitch
is out there doing who knows what!
JACK
(SCOFFS)
You mean the Boogeyman?
NORTH
Yes! When Pitch threatens us, he
threatens them as well.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 35.
North points to the lights on the globe.
JACK
All the more reason to pick someone
more qualified!
NORTH
Pick? You think we pick? No, you
were chosen like we were all
chosen. By Man in Moon.
Jack turns and looks to the group.
JACK
(stares, dumbstruck)
What?
TOOTH
Last night, Jack. He chose you.
BUNNYMUND
Maybe.
JACK
The Man in the Moon, he talks to
you?
Jack looks up to the skylight, taking in the awesome sight of
the moon as it shines down on Earth.
NORTH
You see, you can not say no. It is
destiny.
Jack is still confused by the news. What does it mean?
JACK
But why, why wouldn't he tell me
that himself?
(EXASPERATED EXHALE)
After 300 years this is his answer?
To spend eternity like you guys
cooped up in some, some hideout
thinking of, of new ways to bribe
kids? No no, that's not for me.
No offense.
Jack turns to leave, the Guardians are stunned.
BUNNYMUND
How is that not offensive?
Except for Bunny, who is relieved by this turn and looks to
the others.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 36.
BUNNYMUND
You know what I think? I think we
just dodged a bullet. I mean,
what's this clown know about
bringing joy to children anyway?
Jack turns back. A little pissed.
JACK
Uhh, you ever hear of a snow day?
I know it's no hard-boiled egg, but
kids like what I do.
BUNNYMUND
But none of 'em believe in you.
(leans in to him)
Do they? You see, you're
invisible, mate. It's like you
don't even exist.
TOOTH
Bunny! Enough!
Silence. Jack tries not to look stung by this.
JACK
No, the kangaroo's right.
BUNNYMUND
(GLARES)
The, the what -- what'd you call
me? I am not a kangaroo, mate.
JACK
Oh. And this whole time I thought
you were. If you're not a
kangaroo, what are you?
BUNNYMUND
I'm a bunny. The Easter Bunny.
People believe in me.
Sandy nudges North, who acknowledges the tension in the air.
NORTH
(TO JACK)
Jack. Walk with me.
CUT TO:
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 37.
SEQ. 1000 - NORTH'S WORKSHOP
Jack and North ride an elevator, bearing the resemblance of a
Christmas ornament, down to the factory floor.
JACK
It's nothing personal, North. What
you all do, it's just, it's not my
thing.
NORTH
Man in Moon says it is your thing.
We will see!
North storms through factory floor, Jack trying to keep up.
An amazing place.
JACK
Slow down, wouldja? I've been
trying to bust in here for years, I
want a good look.
NORTH
(peeved - still rushing)
What do you mean, "bust in?"
JACK
Oh, don't worry, I never got past
the yetis.
Jack looks over his shoulder; an angry yeti pounds his fist
into his palm.
YETI
Rwwarrrrrr.
JACK
Oh, hey Phil.
NORTH
Keep up, Jack! Keep up!
North charges ahead.
North's factory is bustling with activity: Yeti's are
building toys, moving packages, while Elves are test piloting
the various flying toys.
As Jack walks behind North, surveying the factory, a duck toy
suddenly flies over Jack's head. Jack ducks just in time and
continues after North.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 38.
JACK
Whoa!
(BEAT)
I always thought the elves made the
toys.
NORTH
(WHISPERS)
We just let them believe that.
Jack looks over to see a group of elves eating Christmas
ornaments and another electrocuting himself with Christmas
lights. North smiles and calls to them.
NORTH
Very nice! Keep up good work!
North continues through the factory floor. He passes a yeti
putting the finishing touches on a blue toy robot.
NORTH
(TO YETI)
I don't like it. Paint it red.
The yeti reacts in dismay as we reveal hundreds of finished
blue robots.
NORTH
Step it up, everybody.
As North and Jack move to the opposite end of the chamber, we
finally glimpse the orchestrated chaos of the entire
workshop, in all it's magic and splendor.
Jack follows North into his office. There are shelves filled
with toys. Sketches and prototypes everywhere.
North dusts his hands and turns to Jack. His sleeves are
rolled. Jack notices that on one of North's forearms is
tattooed the word NAUGHTY, and on the other, NICE. North
grabs a plate from a nearby elf.
NORTH
Fruit cake?
JACK
Ah, no, thanks.
North hurls it - crash! A pause as North looks at Jack.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 39.
NORTH
Now we get down to tacks of brass!
JACK
(TO HIMSELF)
Tacks of brass?
As North cracks his knuckles, Jack stands silent. The wind
suddenly slams North's office door behind them. Jack looks
to the door, it locks itself, and he turns back. North moves
in close to Jack, backing him up against the door.
NORTH
Who are you, Jack Frost? What is
your center?
North pokes Jack in the chest.
JACK
My center?
NORTH
If Man in Moon chose you to be a
Guardian, you must have something
very special inside.
North stands up straight and begins to stroke his beard as he
gives Jack a curious look.
NORTH
Hmmmm?
North is standing in front of a shelf of Russian nesting
dolls. One is carved to look like North himself.
NORTH (CONT'D)
Here. This is how you see me, no?
Very big, intimidating. But if you
get to know me a little--
(hands the doll to Jack)
Well, go on.
Jack gives North a curious look, then sets down his staff.
He twists the doll in half, and inside is another carved
North doll, this one is a more typical Santa Claus - red
cheeked and cheery.
JACK
You are downright jolly.
NORTH
Ah, but not just jolly...
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 40.
The dolls get progressively smaller as he twists them open,
all versions of North, but all slightly different.
NORTH (CONT'D)
I am also mysterious.
(twist - smaller doll)
And fearless.
(twist - smaller doll)
And caring. And at my center...
Twist. As North approaches, Jack looks down and drops the
final Russian doll into the palm of North's hand. It's the
size of a jelly bean.
JACK
There's a tiny wooden baby?
NORTH
Look closer. What do you see?
Jack holds it up to examine it.
JACK
You have big eyes?
NORTH
Yes! Big eyes. Very big. Because
they are full! Of wonder! That is
my center. It is what I was born
with. Eyes that have always seen
the wonder in everything!
North raises his hands, and the toys on the shelves suddenly
spring to life. Jack-in-the-boxes pop, toy trains speed
around the room, soldiers march about, toy planes fly
overhead. An elf gets carried aloft by a balloon.
A flying toy plane glides by and we follow it as it makes its
way around the room. A Christmas tree is ablaze with bright
lights. Two double doors suddenly open as the flying car
enters the factory floor.
NORTH
Eyes that see lights in the trees,
and magic in the air!
As it crosses the frame, dozens of other toys are now flying
around the massive chamber. It's a truly magical moment.
North now stands outside his office, with Jack at his side.
NORTH
This wonder is what I put into the
world, and what I protect in
children.
(MORE)
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 41.
NORTH (CONT'D)
It is what makes me a Guardian. It
is my center. What is yours?
JACK
(BEAT)
I don't know.
Jack looks down into his open palm, the wooden baby stares
back at him. North closes Jack's hand. They exchange a look.
Then, something suddenly jets past a window outside. Almost
simultaneously, Bunny and Sandman come running down the
hallway toward North and Jack.
BUNNYMUND
We have a problem, mate! Trouble
at the Tooth Palace.
CUT TO:
SEQ. 1204 - SLEIGH LAUNCH
North shoves open a set of double doors, followed closely by
Bunny, Sandy, and Jack. Several Yeti's rush by as they
prepare the hangar for launch.
NORTH (O.S.)
(TO YETIS)
Boys, ship shape. As soon as
impossible.
JACK
North, North! I told you, I'm not
going with you guys! There is no
way I'm climbing into some rickety
old...
Suddenly: the SOUND of POUNDING HOOVES. BEASTLY SNORTING.
SANTA'S INCREDIBLE SLEIGH comes into view. It's a huge,
shiny, tricked out, jaw-dropping hot-rod of a sled.
JACK
...sleigh.
Jack is understandably gob-smacked, so much so that he almost
gets knocked over by one of the reindeer.
JACK
Whoa!
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 42.
NORTH
(TO REINDEER)
Hey! Moi deti, moi deti. Quiet,
quiet.
The sleigh comes to a standstill as the Guardians prepare to
climb inside. Several Yetis are still running around making
last minute preparations.
JACK
Okay, one ride, but that's it.
Jack jumps aboard. North smiles knowingly, and climbs
inside. Sandy hops up into the back seat.
NORTH
Everyone loves the sleigh.
North grabs the reigns, wrapping them around his arms. He
turns to see Bunnymund standing there, frozen and unnerved.
NORTH (CONT'D)
Bunny, what are you waiting for?
BUNNYMUND
I think my tunnels might be faster,
mate. And um, and safer.
NORTH
Ah, get in.
(hoists Bunnymund up)
Buckle up!
Bunny desperately looks around his seat.
BUNNYMUND
Whoa, whoa, whoa, where are the
bloody seatbelts?!
NORTH
(LAUGHS)
That was just expression!
North turns to one of the Yetis .
NORTH
Are we ready?
The Yeti throws his hands up in a fit shaking his head no.
NORTH
Good! Let's go! Clear!
(cracks the reigns)
Hyah!
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 43.
The sleigh is off. Elves and yetis scatter out of its path.
Sandy, Bunny, and Jack fly back into their seats. Bunny
clutches the edge of his, terrified. Jack can't help but
laugh.
NORTH
Out of the way!
The sleigh heads down a luge-like track. North and Jack are
enjoying the ride.
NORTH
Hyah!
BUNNYMUND
Ohhhhhh no!
North cracks the reigns, the sleigh plummets, an almost
vertical drop. Sandy grins calmly. Jack loves this.
Bunnymund - not so much.
BUNNYMUND
(WALLA)
Slow down, slow down!
North pulls a lever, kicking the sleigh into overdrive. He
looks back as the sleigh enters a corkscrew.
NORTH
I hope you like the loopty loops!
BUNNYMUND
(NAUSEOUS)
I hope you like carrots.
NORTH
Here we go!
WIDE SHOT as the sleigh reaches the bottom of the ramp, and
shoots upwards, launching them into bright blue sky.
JACK
WOOO-HOOOOOO!!!!!!
A vast chamber supported by pillars containing millions of
tiny wooden deposit boxes from floor to ceiling. North spots
a Nightmare up ahead and hands Jack the reigns.
NORTH
Here, take over!
BUNNYMUND
Huh?
Jack, though surprised, quickly grabs the reigns and smiles
as he snaps them.
JACK
Hyah!
North readies his sword and SLICES the Nightmare in half --
NORTH
Yah!
SEVERAL TOOTH BOXES spill out of the split Nightmare and rain
down into the sleigh at the Guardians' feet. The Nightmare
disintegrates into black sand.
BUNNYMUND
They're stealing the teeth!
Sandy looks at his hands and sees the Nightmare sand take
shape and drift away. He and Bunny exchange a look.
The Guardians turn -- they're headed straight for a pillar.
NORTH
Jack, look out!
Jack pulls the reins --
JACK
Aaaahhhh!
-- the sleigh nearly misses the pillar and skids to a rough
stop on a platform. They see Tooth up above.
NORTH
Tooth! Are you alright?
Tooth is flying around, visibly frustrated. This is bad.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 47.
TOOTH
They, they took my fairies! And
the teeth! All of them!
Everything is gone! Everything.
Only then does it hit her. Tooth's wings drop in defeat.
She's completely lost amidst the devastation. The Guardians
rush to comfort her. Jack stays behind as Baby Tooth pops
out from the hood of his tunic and flies over toward Tooth.
TOOTH
Oh thank goodness! One of you is
alright!
PITCH (O.S.)
I have to say, this is very, very
exciting.
Pitch's voice echoes across the open chamber. They look up to
see Pitch, standing high above them with a satisfied smile.
PITCH
The Big Four, all in one place.
I'm a little star-struck.
(BEAT)
Did you like my show on the globe,
North? Got you all together,
didn't I?
Tooth darts after Pitch, but he escapes into the shadows.
TOOTH
Pitch, you have got thirty seconds
to return my fairies!
PITCH (O.S.)
Or what?
Tooth follows the sound of Pitch's voice and finds him near
one of her tooth box columns.
PITCH
You'll stick a quarter under my
pillow?
NORTH
Why are you doing this?
PITCH
Maybe I want what you have. To be
believed in.
Jack takes this in. Pitch moves along the walls and shadows
of the chamber and emerges from behind a column.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 48.
PITCH
Maybe I'm tired of hiding under
beds.
BUNNYMUND
Maybe that's where you belong.
PITCH
Ah, go suck an egg, rabbit!
Bunny looks down past the edge of the platform to find Pitch
upside down, staring him in the face. Pitch disappears again.
PITCH (O.S.)
Hang on, is that...Jack Frost?
(LAUGHS)
Since when are you all so chummy?
JACK
We're not.
PITCH
Oh good.
Jack turns and sees Pitch standing in the middle of a column.
PITCH
A neutral party. Then I'm going to
ignore you. But, you must be used
to that by now.
BUNNYMUND
Pitch! You shadow sneaking rat-
bag! Come here!
Bunny goes after Pitch, but he disappears and reemerges on an
opposite column. Tooth spots him, grabs one of Bunny's
boomerangs and flies at Pitch in a rage...
TOOTH
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Pitch looks at Tooth with a smile and before she can reach
him, a huge Nightmare darts out of hiding and rears up at
her. Tooth falls back. Baby Tooth hides in Jack's tunic.
PITCH
(SOOTHING)
Whoa! Hey, easy, girl. Easy.
Pitch draws a wisp of black sand from Onyx's mane, twirls it
in his palm, and turns toward Sandy.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 49.
PITCH
Look familiar, Sandman? Took me a
while to perfect this little trick.
Turning dreams into Nightmares.
Pitch notices the shocked Guardians.
PITCH
Don't be nervous, it only riles
them up more. They smell fear you
know.
BUNNYMUND
What fear? Of you!? No one's been
afraid of you since the Dark Ages!
Pitch's eyes flash with anger. But then he smiles.
PITCH
(NOSTALGIC)
Oh, the Dark Ages.
The Guardians land --
NORTH
He's gone.
LATER
Tooth, deflated, sits on the ground with an empty tooth box
in her hands. Baby Tooth, resting on a nearby broken tooth
box, looks to Tooth with concern. Jack walks up and crouches
down alongside Tooth.
BUNNYMUND (O.S.)
Okay, alright I admit it, you were
right about Pitch.
NORTH (O.S.)
This is one time I wish I was
wrong. But he will pay.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 52.
JACK
I'm sorry, about the fairies.
TOOTH
(not her bubbly self)
You should've seen them. They put
up such a fight.
JACK
Why would Pitch take the teeth?
TOOTH
It's not the teeth he wanted. It's
the memories inside them.
JACK
(BEAT)
What do you mean?
Tooth leads Jack across the pond, the water freezing under
his feet as he walks.
TOOTH
That's why we collect the teeth,
Jack. They hold the most important
memories of childhood.
Tooth directs him to a MURAL, which illustrates this.
TOOTH (CONT'D)
My fairies and I watch over them
and when someone needs to remember
what's important, we help them.
Jack takes a second to admire the immense beauty of the mural
before him.
TOOTH (CONT'D)
We had everyone's here. Yours too.
JACK
My memories?
TOOTH
From when you were young. Before
you became Jack Frost.
JACK
(BEAT)
But, I wasn't anyone before I was
Jack Frost.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 53.
TOOTH
Of course you were. We were all
someone before we were chosen.
JACK
What?
NORTH
(CHUCKLES)
You should've seen Bunny.
BUNNYMUND
Hey, I told you never to mention
that!
Jack, confused, is trying to process all this.
JACK
That night at the pond...I just,
why I assumed...Are you saying, are
you saying I had a life before
that? With a home? And a family?
TOOTH
You really don't remember?
Jack's expression says it all. Finally the key to all his
questions.
JACK
All these years, and the answers
were right here. If I find my
memories, then I'll know why I'm
here.
(TO TOOTH)
You have to show me.
Jack, using his control of the wind, lifts up off the ground
and flies across the pond.
TOOTH
I...I can't, Jack. Pitch has them.
Jack floats down onto a rock, overlooking the Guardians.
JACK
Then we have to get them back!
Suddenly, a patch of Tooth's feathers fall out, and
disappears. The Guardians eyes fill with worry.
TOOTH
Oh no!
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 54.
Jack is stricken. He looks back -- the ancient MURAL begins
TO DISINTEGRATE--
TOOTH (CONT'D)
The children. We're too late.
NORTH
No! No! No such thing as too
late!
(GETS IDEA)
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait. Idea!! HAHH!!
He's gleeful. The others look at each other as if he's nuts.
NORTH (CONT'D)
We will collect the teeth!
TOOTH
What?
NORTH
We get teeth! Children keep
believing in you!
TOOTH
We're talking seven continents!
Millions of kids!
NORTH
Give me break! You know how many
toys I deliver in one night?
BUNNYMUND
And eggs I hide in one day?
North turns to Jack.
NORTH
And Jack, if you help us, we will
get you your memories.
Jack looks to Tooth, who gives him a reassuring smile. Sandy
gives to enthusiastic thumbs up while Bunny groans. Jack
looks back to North with a smile.
JACK
I'm in.

SEQ. 1350 - TOOTH COLLECTION
Jack, cocksure, arrives outside an open window. His smile
suddenly disappears when he sees a RABBIT HOLE open up in the
bedroom floor and Bunny hops out.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 57.
North pulls TWO teeth, one with each hand: TWINS.
NORTH
TWINS
(BEAT)
Yipa!!
Bunny pulls out his hand from under a pillow revealing
SEVERAL TEETH.
BUNNYMUND
Jackpot!
Pull out wider to reveal HOCKEY TROPHIES, POSTERS and
PARAPHERNALIA EVERYWHERE. Bunny grins.
BUNNYMUND
Looks like you're a bit of a
brumby, hey mate.
North stands at the side of a boy's bed.
NORTH
(LAUGHS)
Is piece of pie!
He falls into a rabbit hole, finding himself face to face
with Bunny. He growls. SANDMAN enters and takes the boy's
tooth for himself.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 58.
BUNNYMUND
Ow!
NORTH
(LOUD WHISPER)
That's my tooth! Sandy! Sandy!
Jack flies in through the window when suddenly, a rabbit hole
appears. As Jack disappears through the rabbit hole, Bunny
appears through an adjacent hole laughing to himself.
Tooth reaches under a pillow and pulls out a Tooth with a
mouse attached to the other end. Baby Tooth tackles the
mouse.
TOOTH
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy
there, champ! He's one of us!
Part of the European division.
(to the mouse)
Ca va?
The mouse gestures back angrily.
Bunny pulls a note from under a pillow instead of a tooth.
BUNNYMUND
Huh?
The note shows an arrow, pointing toward the window. He
looks up to the window: North holds up a tooth as he grins,
then leaps off the ledge laughing.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 59.
...to see BUNNY'S PAW as it LIGHTS THE FIREPLACE. Bunny
grins demonically in the firelight.
BUNNYMUND
Haha! Ho, ho, ho!
A young boy, holding a stuffed animal and a sippy cup to his
mouth, looks out his bedroom window. The Guardians, cast in
moonlight, bound across the adjacent rooftops. The young
boy, dumbfounded, drops his juice.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 61.
The SPY NIGHTMARE flies down into a dark cavernous space.
Large STEEL CAGES hang all around and trapped inside are the
MINI TEETH.
The Nightmare heads toward Pitch, standing at his own GLOBE,
which is conspicuously covered in lights.
PITCH
The lights...why aren't they going
out?
The Nightmare approaches from behind and lets out a soft
whiney; Pitch stiffens at the news.
PITCH
They're collecting the teeth?
The MINI TEETH perk up at this, and start twittering
excitedly, which echoes throughout the lair.
PITCH
Oh pipe down, or I'll stuff a
pillow with you!
The Mini Teeth begin to settle down. PITCH looks at the
Nightmare, frustrated, and scowls. The Nightmare winces and
disperses into tiny particles.
A strand of NIGHTMARE SAND from the Nightmare twirls in the
air, and Pitch twists it with his fingers, turning it into a
crude image of the SANDMAN.
PITCH
Fine, have your last hurrah. For
tomorrow, all you pathetic
scrambling will be for nothing.

SEQ. 1575 - IN JAMIE'S BEDROOM
A cool looking ROBOT TOY rests on Jamie's bedside table.
Jamie is sound asleep in bed. A smile across his face
reveals the recently formed gap between his teeth.
TOOTH (O.S.)
Left central incisor, knocked out
in a freak sledding accident. I
wonder how that could have
happened, Jack?
Jack laughs as he looks at JAMIE'S DRAWING of himself during
the SNOWBALL FIGHT on the wall. He's midair, blasting his
friends with snowballs. He smiles and then turns to Tooth.
JACK
(LAUGHS)
Kids, huh?
He watches as Tooth reaches under the pillow. She hovers
over Jamie as he stirs in his sleep. A dreamy smile comes
over her as she gazes down at the sleeping boy.
TOOTH
This was always the part I liked
most - seeing the kids.
(BEAT)
Why did I ever stop doing this?
A beat; Jack sees how much it means to her.
JACK
It's a little different up close,
huh?
Tooth gives him a look: he's right.
TOOTH
Thanks for being here, Jack. I
wish I had known about your memory,
I could've helped you.

JACK
Yeah, well, look let's just get you
taken care of. Then it's Pitch's
turn, huh?
A sudden COMMOTION. They both turn to the window.
NORTH
Here you are!
North, carrying a large sack over his shoulder, struggles to
climb in through the small window. Sandman and Baby Tooth
climb in after. Everybody whispers.
TOOTH
SSHHHHHHHH!!
NORTH
Oh, what gives slowpokes!?
Jamie is still sound asleep.
NORTH
How you feeling, Toothy?
TOOTH
Believed in.
NORTH
(LAUGHS)
Haha! That's what I want to hear.
BUNNYMUND (O.S.)
Oh I see how it is...
Bunny comes in through a rabbit hole in the floorboards.
BUNNYMUND (CONT'D)
All working together to make sure
the rabbit gets last place.
North now holds his index fingers up to his lips.
NORTH
SSSHHHHHHHHH!!!
JACK
You think I need help to beat a
bunny? Check it out, Peter

Jack lifts up his sack of teeth.

BUNNYMUND
You call that a bag of choppers?

Now that's a bag of choppers.
NORTH
Gentlemen! Gentlemen! This is
about Tooth. It's not a
competition! But if it was --
(reveals even larger sack)
I win. YEEEEEHAAAHH!
And he strikes a Russian dancing pose as...
Suddenly a bright circle of light is cast on the Guardians.
NORTH (CONT'D)
Oh no...
JAMIE (O.C.)

Santa Claus?
They all turn slowly to see Jamie sitting up in bed, holding
a flashlight, wide awake and beaming in disbelief.
JAMIE (CONT'D)
The Easter Bunny?...Sandman...The
Tooth Fairy! I knew you'd come!
TOOTH
Surprise!
(GIGGLING)
We came!
JACK
He can see us?
Jamie looks around, amazed, he sees everyone but Jack.
BUNNYMUND
Most of us.
TOOTH
Shhh! You guys, he's still awake.
BUNNYMUND
Sandy! Knock him out!
They all look to him, scandalized. Jamie looks concerned.
JAMIE
Huh?
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 65.
BUNNYMUND
With the Dreamsand, ya gumbies.
But then Jamie's GREYHOUND rises up into frame, fully awake,
its nostrils flaring at the scent he's picked up.
JAMIE
No, stop that's the Easter Bunny.
What are you doing, Abbey? Down!
The dog is nose to nose with Bunnymund.
BUNNYMUND
Alright, nobody panic.
JACK
(ENJOYING THIS)
But that's a um, that's a
greyhound. Do you know what
greyhounds do to rabbits?
BUNNYMUND
I think it's a pretty safe bet he's
never met a rabbit like me -
While Sandy forms a Dreamsand baseball, Jack rolls his eyes
and notices an alarm clock on the bedside table.
BUNNYMUND (CONT'D)
Six foot one, nerves of steel,
master of tai-chi and the ancient
ART OF--
Jack can't resist: he reaches over stealthily and SETS OFF
THE ALARM CLOCK with his staff. RRRRRIIIIING!
BUNNYMUND
Crikey.
Bunny is off like a shot, the greyhound right on his tail,
running laps in the small room, the dog barking like crazy.
JAMIE
Stop! Sit!
Sandy, amused, makes a Dreamsand baseball to stop the dog,
but bobbles it as the dog brushes past.
JAMIE
Down girl, down!
The others stand out of the way as Bunny and the dog run up
the walls and over the bed.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 66.
As Tooth tries to silence the alarm clock, Jack can barely
contain his laughter. Sandy takes aim as Bunny and the dog
run circles around him--
NORTH
Sandy, Sandy!
The dog jumps past North, knocking him back.
NORTH
Ah!
As Sandy winds up, the dog suddenly SMACKS right into him.
The Dreamsand goes flying.
TOOTH
Hey, this is not proper Tooth Fairy
behavior!
North ducks out of the way as the Dreamsand sails toward him.
The Dreamsand baseball smacks Tooth right in the face and
explodes into golden dust. Tooth and her fairy fall to the
ground as a golden tooth takes shape above their heads.
Streams of Dreamsand make their way around the room.
BUNNYMUND (O.C.)
Ah, this thing's rabid! Get this
dingo off me!
Bunny gets a whiff of the golden sand. The image of a carrot
quickly takes shape in front of his face.
BUNNYMUND
Oh no.
THUD! Bunny falls over asleep. THUD! So does the dog.
North tries to scramble out of the way, but there's no escape
in this tiny room.
NORTH
Candy canes...
He teeters for a moment as Dreamsand candy canes appear
before him, then falls like a giant Sequoia, landing - THUD! -
on the end of Jamie's bed, which sends Jamie catapulting
through the air.
JAMIE
Whoaaaaaaaaaa!
Luckily he lands -- OOF! -- in Sandy's arms. He starts to
wake up AGAIN, but Sandy is there with a fistful of sand --
BOOF! -- and Jamie too is out cold.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 67.
Jack and Sandy look down at the sleeping boy, relieved. Then
they look around -- a heap of sleeping, snoring bodies.
JACK
Whoops...
Bunny is snuggled up next to North. A carrot and candy
canes, made of Dreamsand, hold hands as they dance above
Bunny and North's head.
Jack comes down off the dresser and turns to Sandy, who has
put Jamie back in bed. Sandy lifts North's arm and lets go,
it's completely limp and falls flat. Sandy smiles at Jack,
who chuckles.
JACK
Oh, I really wish I had a camera
right now.
Sandy eyes suddenly widen. There's a Nightmare behind Jack.
Jack turns to see A NIGHTMARE staring through the window.
Without hesitation, Jack jumps out the window after it.
JACK (O.S.)
(SHOUTS)
Sandy, c'mon! We can find Pitch.
Sandy pauses for a moment, then follows Jack's lead.
BACK IN JAMIE'S ROOM - INTERCUT
The sleeping Guardians are where we left them. Jamie's
bedroom door opens, and Sophie toddles in. She takes in the
scene, amused. She toddles over to North, giggling.
She pokes at his rotund belly. Then she notices something.
She reaches into his pocket and pulls out a snow globe.
SOPHIE
Pretty!
She looks over to see the Easter Bunny, sound asleep on the
floor.
SOPHIE
Bunny! Hop! Hop! Hop!
Suddenly the snow globe lights up. Sophie's eyes widen as
she looks at the beautiful vista inside the globe. It's
Bunny's warren.
She takes the globe and toddles off for the door, when she
trips - again - and the snow globe smashes on the floor.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 68.
SOPHIE
Ow!
BOOMF!! A flash of LIGHT. She looks up to see a magical
portal open in front of her. A GUST WIND comes blowing out
of the portal. Sophie giggles, and toddles through the
portal.
North's bleary EYES pop open mid-snore.
NORTH
Whuh-huh...?
CUT TO:
SEQ. 1600 - SANDMAN ATTACKED
We're in the midst of a somber ceremony, marking the passing
of Sandy. Burning candles line the perimeter of Sandy's
stone emblem.
Tooth sets down a candle and stands shoulder to shoulder with
North and Bunny. The three hold hands in solace.
The ringing of somber bells can be heard echoing throughout
the chamber, as we reveal the elves and a yeti ringing the
elf bells as part of a ceremonial dirge.
Jack, facing a window, FROSTS OVER THE GLASS with his finger
to form a symbol of Sandy. North slowly walks up behind him.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 77.
NORTH
Are you alright?
Jack remains still, his eyes fixed on the image of Sandy.
JACK
I just, I wish I could've done
something.
NORTH
Done something? Jack, you stood up
to Pitch. You saved us.
JACK
But Sandy wo--
NORTH
(putting his hand on
JACK'S SHOULDER)
Would be proud of what you did.
Jack pulls back his hoodie and stands up.
NORTH (CONT'D)
I don't know who you were in your
past life, but in this life you are
Guardian.
JACK
But how can I know who I am, until
I find out who I was?
NORTH
You will. I feel it, in my belly.
Jack and North approach the globe which is losing lights at
an alarming rate.
TOOTH
Look how fast they're going out.
JACK
(GETTING IT)
It's fear. He's tipped the
balance.
Jack drifts up closer the globe. He looks at the lights
going out, then back to the Guardians. There's a nervous
tension in the room.

Hey, buck up ya sad-sacks. Come

We must hurry to the Warren.
Everyone, to the sleigh!

the air.
BUNNYMUND
Something's up.
Something's amiss. A faint scream begins to echo from within
the depths of one of Bunny's egg tunnels. Tiny eggs come
scuttling out from the tunnel.
Bunny grabs his boomerang, North draws his sword, and Jack
readies his staff as the sounds of booming footsteps,
screams, and the rustling of foliage grows louder.
BUNNYMUND
Ahhhh!
Bunny begins to charge toward the tunnel. At his side are
the Guardians, yetis, and sentinel eggs all bellowing their
loudest battle cries until...Sophie bursts out. All momentum
comes to a halt.
JACK
Sophie?
They immediately withdraw their weapons, mildly embarrassed.
Sophie giggles and immediately runs after one of the elves.
SOPHIE
Elf, elf, elf!
BUNNYMUND
What is SHE doing HERE!!?
North looks down at his coat pocket - ooops.
NORTH
(EMBARRASSED)
Ah, snow globe.
BUNNYMUND
Crikey! Somebody do something!
JACK
Don't look at me, I'm invisible,
remember?
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 80.
Sophie giggles as she drags the elf by the bell atop its
uniform.
TOOTH
(CONFIDENT)
Don't worry, Bunny. I bet she's a
fairy fan.
(flies up to Sophie)
It's okay little one.
SOPHIE
(TO TOOTH)
Pretty!
TOOTH
Awww! You know what, I got
something for you. Here it is.
(she pulls something out)
Look at all the pretty teeth with
little blood and gum on them.
Sophie runs away screaming.
JACK
(LAUGHS)
Blood and gums? When was the last
time you guys actually hung out
with kids?
Meanwhile, Sophie is running around the warren, exploring and
playing. Sophie pokes her head into a small tunnel.
SOPHIE
Peek-a-boo.
NORTH
We are very busy bringing joy to
children! We don't have time...
(EMBARRASSED)
...for children.
Jack walks toward her, forming a SNOWFLAKE, which floats over
toward Sophie. She tries to grab at it.
JACK
If one little kid can ruin Easter,
then...we're in worse shape than I
thought.
Sophie follows the snowflake as Jack leads it over to Bunny.
SOPHIE
Weeee! Weee, weee, weee!
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 81.
The snowflake lands on Bunny's nose and his concerns suddenly
seem to slip away. Jack's magic is taking affect.
Close up on a flower, that opens to reveal an egg. The egg
stands up wobbly on its spindly little legs. We pull out to
reveal Sophie and Bunny's faces looking on, Sophie amazed,
Bunny proud.
BUNNYMUND
You wanna paint some eggs? Yeah?
SOPHIE
Okay!
BUNNYMUND
Come on then!
We pull out further to reveal a massive stone spire, covered
in moss, as thousands of unpainted eggs stream down the side
of it toward a green meadow. North and Jack stand in the
midst of it all, slack-jawed, as the eggs rush towards them.
NORTH
Rimsky Korsakov! That's a lot of
eggs.
JACK
Uh, how much time do we have?
A GREEN MEADOW
SOPHIE
Weeeeee!
BUNNYMUND
Woooohoooo!
Bunny hops into view, Sophie clinging to his back smiling,
leading a huge mass of eggs down a wide PATH. As he passes,
FLOWERS BLOOM on either side in his wake, BLASTING the
passing eggs with color as they go.
BUNNYMUND (V.O.)
Alright troops, it's time to push
back. That means eggs!
Everywhere!
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 82.
THE SORTING STONES
North looks out over the eggs as they get sorted.
NORTH
(WALLA)
Single file!
Sophie, on her back, is carried by the eggs through the
sorting stones. She giggles as North waves at her while she
passes by.
BUNNYMUND (V.O.)
Heaps of you in every high-rise,
farm house and trailer park!
Baby Tooth flies across the screen, diverting our attention
to a multicolored stream off in the distance.
BUNNYMUND (V.O.)
In tennis shoes and cereal bowls!
Baby Tooth joins an elf, who stands alongside an egg at the
edge of a cliff. The elf pushes the egg over the cliff, into
the stream, and celebrates with a victory dance.
BUNNYMUND (V.O.)
Oh, there will be bathtubs filled
with my beautiful googies!
The elf turns just in time to see a stampede of colored eggs
come barreling toward him. They knock him off the cliff as
he and the eggs spill into the multi-colored stream below.
A SPARKLING STREAM
Colored eggs wade through the water, emerging with SECONDARY
COLORS and intricate PATTERNS of all kinds.
An unlucky egg veers off and gets stuck in a WHIRLPOOL. We
see a hand fish it out to reveal North, who looks at the egg
curiously. It's now got a SPIRAL PATTERN on it and its
little LEGS kick madly.
NORTH
Okay, that's little strange.
BUNNYMUND
Naw, mate --
Bunny's surrounded by butterflies and cute little eggs.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 83.
BUNNYMUND (CONT'D)
That's adorable.
As a technicolored elf climbs out of the stream, North sets
the egg down and lets it rejoin the herd.
A GREEN MEADOW
As Sophie leads a parade of eggs, Bunny jumps to an adjacent
rock and sits up to address the eggs as they walk in stride.
Meanwhile, Jack rides atop a group of sentinel egg that are
marching in the back ground.
BUNNYMUND
There will be springtime! On every
continent! And I'm bringing hope
with me!
A GREEN MEADOW - CONTINUOUS
CLOSE ON: a line of eggs running down curled vines as yetis
sprinkle them with glitter. They continue on down various
vine corkscrew-like shoots, decorating the eggs with stripes.
A confused elf emerges from the vines, striped with paint and
walks off.
A GREEN MEADOW - CONTINUOUS
The striped elf walks past a Yeti, painting a mound of eggs
red. Bunny enters frame and hops across the screen.
BUNNYMUND
Too Christmas-y, mate, paint `em
blue.
The Yeti throws its arms up in defeat and tosses the eggs.
A GREEN MEADOW - MOMENTS LATER
A beautifully painted egg hides in the grass.
BUNNYMUND (O.S.)
Oh, what's over there?
Sophie appears, spots the egg, and delicately lifts it out of
the grass. She holds it close to admire the intricate detail
of its shell. Sophie brings the egg to Bunny for him to
inspect.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 84.
BUNNYMUND (CONT'D)
That's a beauty!
Bunny takes Sophie by the hand and leads her through a stone
archway.
BUNNYMUND (CONT'D)
Now all we gotta do is get him and
his little mates through the
tunnels, to the top, and we'll have
ourselves Easter.
THE STREAMS OF COLORED EGGS
Bunny looks out proudly at the eggs gathered in front of the
TUNNELS in the distance.
Jack approaches from behind and makes his way alongside
Bunny, who holds Sophie in his arms. Its our first real
vista of the whole warren. It's a spectacular sight.
JACK
Not bad.
Sophie yawns and begins to fall asleep. Bunny turns to Jack
with a smile.
BUNNYMUND
Not bad yourself.
JACK
Look, I'm sorry about that whole,
you know, the "kangaroo" thing.
BUNNYMUND
It's the accent, isn't it?
North comes up from behind with Tooth at his side. They turn
toward Bunny, marveling at the sight of Sophie, fast sleep.
It's touching. Bunny's face softens, as if remembering a
distant memory.
BUNNYMUND
Ah, poor little ankle-biter. Look
at her, all tuckered out.
TOOTH
I love her!
They look up from the sleeping toddler toward Jack. He's
taught them something today.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 85.
TOOTH
I think it's time to get her home.
Bunny hands the sleeping Sophie over to Tooth.
JACK
How about I take her home?
TOOTH
Jack, no! Pitch is--
JACK
--no match for this.
(twirls his staff)
BUNNYMUND
Which is why we need you here, with
us.
The Guardians look at Jack with concern.
JACK
Trust me, I'll be quick as a bunny.
CUT TO:
SEQ. 1804 - RETURNING SOPHIE
Jack tries to lay a sleeping Sophie down in her bed, but she
won't let go of his neck. Finally, she releases her grasp
only to roll over and fall out of bed. Baby Tooth gives Jack
a scornful look.
JAMIE'S MOM (O.S.)
Sophie? Is that you?
Jack and Baby Tooth's eyes widen. Sophie, asleep on the
floor, is quickly covered with a blanket and given a squeaky
stuffed animal.
Jack continues along a long dark tunnel with Baby Tooth close
behind. Eventually the labyrinth opens up to reveal a huge
underground cavern. Baby Tooth continues to tug at Jack's
tunic.
JACK
(waving Baby Tooth off)
Baby Tooth, Baby...come on!
(BEAT)
I have to find out what that is.
Jack can't believe his eyes. Dozens of huge bird cages
hanging from the ceiling, and in them are the mini tooth
fairies. They see Jack, and immediately perk up, tweeting
and flitting like crazy.
Jack jumps up onto one of the cages, then quickly leaps and
holds onto the side of another one.
JACK
(WHISPERS)
Shhhh! keep it down.
(leaps to another cage)
I'm gonna get you out of here, just
as soon as I --
VOICE FROM A MEMORY
Jack...
Jack turns away from the fairies, distracted.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 88.
VOICE FROM A MEMORY
Jack...
JACK
(under his breath)
As I can --
Jack looks down and sees the tooth drawers from Tooth's
Palace. Mounds of them heaped to the ceiling. And inside
the drawers are the missing baby teeth. He drops down to a
mound and begins rummaging through the drawers, looking at
the names on the boxes.
In an instant he forgets his duties, and the fairies, and the
Guardians and everything except those teeth, and the chance
to finally get his memory back.
The cavern suddenly goes darker than it already was. Jack
finally looks up, as a shadow of Pitch crawls up a nearby
column.
PITCH (O.S.)
Looking for something?
Jack swings around with his staff, shooting off a blast of
ice, but Pitch isn't there. Jack takes off, following the
sound of Pitch's cackle as it echoes throughout the chamber.
Jack rounds a corner as he sees Pitch's shadow glide across
the walls into a shadowed corridor.
PITCH (O.S.)
Don't be afraid, Jack. I'm not
going to hurt you.
Jack continues along a shadowed corridor.
JACK
Afraid?
Jack sees Pitch on a bridge across the cavern and heads after
him.
JACK (CONT'D)
I'm not afraid of you!
PITCH
Maybe not. But you are afraid of
something.
Jack steadily approaches, cautious and alert.
JACK
You think so, huh?
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 89.
PITCH
I know so. It's the one thing I
always know.
Pitch finally turns to face Jack.
PITCH (CONT'D)
People's greatest fears. Yours is
that no one will ever believe in
you.
Panic flashes in Jack's eyes. As he backs away, the chamber
fills with shadows, and Jack is spun around. He's
disoriented as he thuds into a wall, which flips to reveal
that it's actually the ground.
Pitch, unseen now, chuckles.
Jack's unsure of where he is. He looks back to see the
cavern entrance -- he's right back where he started.
PITCH (O.S.)
And worst of all, you're afraid
you'll never know why. Why you?
Why were you chosen...to be like
this?
Jack discovers that the entrance has been blocked with bricks
as Pitch's shadow encroaches on him.
PITCH
Well fear not, for the answer to
that...
Pitch is now directly in front of Jack, holding out a tooth
box.
PITCH (CONT'D)
Is right here.
Jack's eyes widen at the sight - the face of a young boy
etched into the box, and under it is the name "Jack Frost."
PITCH
Do you want them, Jack? Your
memories?
He holds them out to Jack. Jack stares, fighting the impulse
to grab them. He closes his eyes, struggling to make a
decision, but when he opens them again, Pitch has
disappeared.
Pitch's shadow moves across the pillars of the cavern.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 90.
Jack heads down a corridor, cast shadows from the Mini Tooth
cages everywhere.
PITCH (O.S.)
Everything you wanted to know...
Pitch's face moves in and out of the shadows over the
following.
PITCH
...in this little box.
Every time Jack turns, Pitch disappears. It's like Jack's
trapped in a fun house.
Multiple Pitch shadows have appeared on the wall around Jack.
They're closing in on him.
PITCH
Why did you end up like this?
Unseen. Unable to reach out to
anyone.
(BEAT)
You want the answers so badly. You
want to grab them, and fly off with
them. But you're afraid of what
the Guardians will think.
Jack's breath quickens. He's been pushed into a corner.
PITCH
You're afraid of disappointing
them.
(SMILES)
Well let me ease your mind about
one thing. They'll never accept
you. Not really.
The shadows have overcome Jack.
JACK
(trying to scramble away)
Stop it! Stop it!
Almost reluctantly, the shadows back away and Pitch appears
before Jack.
PITCH
After all, you're not one of them.
Jack aims his staff at Pitch.
JACK
You don't know what I am!
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 91.
PITCH
Of course I do. You're Jack Frost.
You make a mess wherever you go.
Why, you're doing it right now.
Pitch tosses the box to Jack, who instinctively catches it.
Jack looks up. Terror comes into Jack's eyes, as he
realizes...
JACK
What did you do?
PITCH
More to the point Jack, what did
you do?
Pitch begins to back away, becoming one with the darkness,
laughing as he disappears. Jack charges towards him only to
be swallowed whole by one of Pitch's black holes.
CUT TO:
SEQ. 2200 - GUARDIANS BREAK WITH JACK
Jack flies out of Pitch's shadow, ready to strike. Suddenly,
Jack realizes he's forgotten something.
JACK
Baby Tooth!
He turns to re-enter the hole in the wall only to find
himself face to face with one of Bunny's stone emblems.
PITCH (O.S.)
Happy Easter, Jack.
Jack turns around. Suddenly, his eyes fill with dread as he
realizes where he is. Thousands of broken egg shells lay
strewn about, forming a path toward the light at the end of
the tunnel.
JACK
No.
Yetis stare at the globe of belief, in shock as more and more
lights begin to fad away. We push in toward Antarctica as we-

Come on, let's go.
Jack looks around and notices that all of the Minis are still
in their cages.
JACK (CONT'D)
What's wrong?!
The fairies are just standing around, listless.
JACK (CONT'D)
None of you can fly?
Baby Tooth directs Jack's attention to the Globe at the base
of Pitch's lair.
JACK
The lights...
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 106.
A Yeti very carefully sets the last of a group of newly
painted red robot dolls on a shelf. He breathes a sigh of
relief.
Suddenly, the entire factory begins to shake, knocking the
robot doll to the ground. He dives after it, juggles it in
the air, and catches it just before it hits the ground.
Suddenly, streaks of BLACK SAND whoosh up into and around the
factory. The dark sand snakes its way up and around the
globe, causing the Yetis and Elves to scatter and knocking
TOYS to the floor.
The Yetis and Elves look up in horror as the black sand, now
covering the globe, gives rise to Pitch, who stands before
them cackling.
PITCH
You're all free to go! We won't be
needing any Christmas toys this
year, thank you! Nor ever again!
The yeti with the robot dolls sinks his head and sighs in
defeat.
Jack lands on the ground, now standing before PITCH'S GLOBE --
and it looks almost completely devoid of light.
JACK
They're all going out...
Pitch is practically dancing across North's globe, he's so
giddy, counting down as the last few lights go dark.
PITCH
Only six left! Six precious
children who still believe in the
Guardians with all their h--
(a lights blinks out)
Make that, five.
(ANOTHER)
Oo! Four!
(MOUNTING)
Three!
(ECSTASY)
TWO!
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 107.
His eyes widen as he snaps his fingers with anticipation and
glee. All of his hard work and planning - finally paying
off!
Pitch stares down at the one last light, waiting for it to go
out. He snaps his fingers a few more times. Still nothing.
His smile fades. His face goes cold as he realizes...
PITCH
(TO HIMSELF)
One.
Jack jumps up onto the globe to closely inspect the last
light. The light is brought into full view. Jack smiles.
JACK
Jamie!
We're tight on the globe, where the LAST LIGHT flickers. We
PUSH IN to the light and...
Jamie is sitting up in bed, talking to an old stuffed rabbit,
and whispering.
JAMIE
Okay look, you and I are obviously
at what they call a crossroads, so
here's what's gonna happen -
Jack appears outside Jamie's window and moves closer to get a
better look.
JAMIE (CONT'D)
If it wasn't a dream and if you are
real, then you have to prove it.
Like right now.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 108.
Jamie waits. He looks around expectantly. Jack looks on
from outside the window, wondering if anything will happen.
JAMIE
(desperation creeping in)
I've believed in you for a long
time, okay? Like my whole life in
fact. So you kinda owe me now.
Jamie picks up his stuffed rabbit and holds it close.
JAMIE (CONT'D)
You don't have to do much, just a
little sign so I know. Anything.
(BEAT)
Anything at all.
He waits. It's excruciating.
JAMIE
(A WHISPER)
I knew it.
Jamie lets the stuffed animal fall to the floor. Jack comes
into the room and watches as the light slowly fades from
Jamie's eyes, disbelief setting in.
Jack doesn't know what to do. He takes a moment to
concentrate, then enters the room.
Then, Jamie notices the window as the panes of glass freeze
over. The image of an Easter egg suddenly appears...
JAMIE
(seeing the window)
Huh?
Jamie looks down at the stuffed rabbit on the floor. He can
barely comprehend what he's seeing. Jamie looks back to the
window as more of the window panes frost over. Jamie's eyes
get huge with amazement.
JAMIE
He's real.
Jack, excited, continues to exert himself trying to bring
life to his drawing. And when he does, the frost rabbit
comes leaping off of the window.
JAMIE
Whoa...
The rabbit hops around Jamie's room, bursting like a snowball
over Jamie's head, the snowflakes sprinkling down on him.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 109.
JAMIE
Whoa!
Jack is as amazed as Jamie. But Jamie's amazement turns to
confusion.
JAMIE
Snow?
A snowflake lands on the tip of Jamie's nose. The snowflake
glows a magic blue. And in that moment a light comes into
Jamie's eyes - an idea starts to take hold.
JAMIE
(WHISPER)
Jack Frost?
JACK
(a stunned beat)
Did he just say--?
Jamie stands up on his bed.
JAMIE
Jack Frost.
JACK
(DISBELIEF)
He said it again. He said --
(BEAT)
You said...
Jamie turns around and suddenly his eyes go wide...
JAMIE
Jack Frost.
JACK
That's right! But-but that's me!
Jack Frost! That's my name! You
said my name!
Jamie's mouth drops open. Only then does Jack realize...
JACK
Wait, can you hear me?
(JAMIE NODS)
Can you... Can you see me?
(JAMIE NODS)
He sees me. He sees me!
Jack leaps for joy, and the room suddenly explodes with snow.
Jamie can't believe it.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 110.
JAMIE
You just made it snow.
JACK
I know!
JAMIE
In my room.
JACK
I know!
JAMIE
You're real?
JACK
Yeah! Who do you think brings you
all the blizzards and snow days,
and you remember when you went
flying on that sled the other day?!
JAMIE
That was you?
JACK
That was me!
JAMIE
Cool!
JACK
Right?!
JAMIE
But what about the Easter Bunny and
the Tooth Fairy I mean--
JACK
Real-real-real! Every one of us is
real!
JAMIE
I knew it!
Jamie's mom calls from down the hall...
JAMIE'S MOM (O.S.)
Jamie, who are you talking to?
JAMIE
Um...Jack Frost.
Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 111.
JAMIE'S MOM (O.S.)

Suddenly, the sound of thunder and North's sleigh as Jack and
Jamie look to the open window.
SMASH CUT TO:
SEQ. 2800 - JACK AND GUARDIANS REUNITE
A terrified Cupcake lies in bed awake. The Guardians'
reflections streak across the window when suddenly, BOOF! A
snowball strikes the pane of glass.
Cupcake pulls the covers down to find that it's suddenly
SNOWING inside! As the snow circles around Cupcake's head,
she sits up and smiles.
A wisp of Dreamsand floats into a child's bedroom and touches
his forehead while he sleeps. Suddenly, a Dreamsand figure
forms above the child's head, it's the Tooth Fairy.
Lights begin to appear on the globe. Baby Tooth notices
this, and perks up. Her wings start to flutter.
Other fairies begin to fly. They shoot down to the tooth
boxes and begin opening them. We see one of the faces on a
box, and transition to the actual child who she goes from sad
to happy as her fondest memories flood back. We zoom out of
her face to see thousands of fluttering fairies and...
