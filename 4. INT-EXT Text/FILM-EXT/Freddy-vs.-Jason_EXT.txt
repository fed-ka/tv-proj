MEAGAN is coming down the sidewalk in slow motion.
Her dress and long hair blow slightly in the breeze.
The SOUND of CHILDREN CHANTING increases.
DREAM CHILDREN
(in chorus)
One... two... Freddy's coming for
you.
On "you" there is a RUMBLE and a flash -- like quick
lightning only evil.
(Choice flashes from Nightmare on
Elm Street 1 & 2).
Meagan turns at 1665.
A beautiful white, two-story
house, thick with lush green foliage.
Several beautiful
children, all dressed in bright white, play hopscotch
and jumprope on the front walk.
DREAM CHILDREN
(continuing; chanting)
Three... four... better lock your
door.
Close on a little girl's foot coming down on the number
"4" drawn on concrete.
Another RUMBLE and flash -- longer, LOUDER.
(Flashes
from Nightmare 3 & 4).
Meagan continues up the walk, the wind is blowing a
little harder now.
The trees are brown, the leaves
peeling away.
Moving up the walk, closer to the house... only now
it's a little darker, needs some paint.
On the front
porch, a LITTLE GIRL rides a tricycle.
DREAM CHILDREN
(continuing; chanting)
Five... six...
RUMBLE.
Flash.
(Nightmare 5 and Freddy's Dead).
DREAM CHILDREN
(continuing; chanting)
...grab your crucifix.. ix.. ix..
The "ix" echoes away, becoming the faint "Ka ka ka"
we all recognize as Jason's theme.
Meagan turns to
find that the children in the yard have vanished. It's
nighttime.
The trees are dead, the grass is gone, and the horizon
stretches off into utter nothingness.
Meagan turns
back to the little girl.
But the little girl has gone.
Only the tricycle
remains.
It circles once, the front door CREAKS open,
and the empty tricycle peddles inside.
Meagan follows
it into the...
Meagan and Lizzy climb into JESSE's car.
JESSE
Good morning! Hey, what's the matter?
MEAGAN
My mom...
JESSE
And...?
MEAGAN
I had another dream last night...
JESSE
Was I naked?
MEAGAN
No. You were Jason.
JESSE
Jason? Oh, yeech...
(then)
Was I any good?
Meagan playfully smacks him as Jesse's car ROARS off.
Murdoch gets into the command car, sitting down next
to the S.W.A.T. COMMANDER sitting behind the wheel.
MURDOCH
Damn media... oughtta be a law.
(gestures to house)
Is that shyster still in there
trying to talk them out?
S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
Yeah... he's making them some kind
of deal.
MURDOCH
Damn lawyers... what a bunch of
assholes. Shakespeare was right --
kill all the lawyers. Then we could
kill all the punks with no hassles
and the world would be a safer place.
S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
Smaller anyway.
MURDOCH
Ahhhhh... what did Shakespeare know?
Long-haired, English freak. He was
probably a punk.
The lawyer's disembodied head comes sailing out of
an upstairs window, smacking into the command car's
windshield with a loud SPLAT!
S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
Jesus Christ!
Murdoch curses and leaps out of the car, charging
the house as he BLASTS away with two nickel-plated
.45s.
Suddenly GUNFIRE erupts from every window in
the house, BULLET HITS RIDDLING the cops cars,
SMASHING windows and emergency lights.
The S.W.A.T. TEAM follows Murdoch through the hail
of GUNFIRE as he kicks open the front door.
WHACK! -- the door flies open and Murdoch and the
S.W.A.T. team move in.
The windows have been covered
with foil, the walls have been painted black with
cult slogans written in red, making the whole house
black as pitch.
The S.W.A.T. team puts on their
night vision goggles and starts moving through the
house.
P.O.V. THROUGH NIGHT VISION GOGGLES as the S.W.A.T.
team goes through the house SHOOTING cultists (ala
the computer game DOOM).
Then a blinding flash of
light and a S.W.A.T. guy goes down -- shot in the
face.
Several of the cultists lead the attacking S.W.A.T.
team deeper into the house.
As one of the S.W.A.T.
guys follows his foot trips a wire.
A trap door
opens in the floor and the S.W.A.T. guy falls into
a pit, waist deep in water.
Suddenly, the water
starts churning and the guy starts screaming -- it's
a tank of piranhas!
Two other S.W.A.T. guys grab
his arms and pull him out.
Too late -- his legs
have been shredded to the bone.
Another S.W.A.T. guy kicks in a door to a room and
steps in, FIRING his machine gun.
A large scythe
swings down and severs both his arms at the elbows.
His arms fall to the floor, still FIRING the machine
gun.
The cultists race into a room, grabbing handrailing
bolted over head.
They swing like monkeys across
the ceiling just as a S.W.A.T. guy charges into the
room behind them.
CLOSE ON S.W.A.T. GUY'S BOOTS as he steps onto a floor
covered with upturned nails.
Several nails puncture
both boots, the points coming up through the laces.
The S.W.A.T. guy screams and another S.W.A.T. guy
barrels into the room to see what is wrong.
He knocks
the first guy face-first into the floor o' nails.
Meanwhile, Murdoch is having a blast -- literally.
He kicks open the door to a room and guns down three
cultists as they try to escape out a window.
As
the last body pitches to the floor, Murdoch yells:
MURDOCH
Freeze!
Murdoch exits, laughing to himself.
The running GUNBATTLE continues as the cultists
retreat to the back of the house, throwing molotov
cocktails.
Soon the first floor is ablaze. A S.W.A.T.
guy screams as he is consumed by FIRE.
The cultists
thunder down a back staircase to the...
The S.W.A.T. commander staggers out with the little
girl, followed closely with the remainder of his men
and finally Murdoch.
The commander throws himself to
the ground, covering the little girl with his body as
-- BA-BOOM!!! -- the Elm Street house EXPLODES!
Murdoch stands as debris rains down around him.
He
mutters:
MURDOCH
Punks.
As the dust settles, the S.W.A.T. commander rolls off
the little girl and starts checking her for injury.
S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
Are you okay, honey?
Suddenly, the little girl jumps onto the S.W.A.T.
commander, flashing a glove of knives.
She hisses:
LITTLE GIRL HOSTAGE
Freddy lives!
With a quick swing, the little girl slashes the
commander's face.
She dives back for a plunge to
his throat when Murdoch walks up and kicks her off.
He puts his boot on her, holding her down as he
takes aim on her head with his pistol -- execution
style.
S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
NO!
The S.W.A.T. commander grabs Murdoch's arm just in
time.
Several cops rush in and grab the girl,
dragging her off, kicking and screaming.
S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
(continuing)
Jesus... you were going to kill
that kid, weren't you?
MURDOCH
I told you you were wasting your
time. Once these kids go rabid,
best thing to do is put 'em down.
S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
You can't be serious...
MURDOCH
Dead serious. See... the world is
made up of rules. Kids don't like
rules. They rebel for a while, but
ultimately they start to fall in
line and become ordinary Joe's like
you and me. But some kids... dope
smokers mainly, watching their MTV...
Satanic lyrics melting what's left
of their brains... these kids grow
up to be punks. And when these punks
step as far over the line as these
"Freddy" punks have -- then we as
peace officers have no choice but
to kill them.
S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
I didn't become a peace officer to
kill kids.
MURDOCH
Punks. There's a difference...
(under his breath)
...barely.
CUT TO:
Lizzy sits on the steps of her school, clutching
her books and Raggedy Ann doll... waiting. Behind
her, wearing a protective helmet, another learning
disabled kid - LEONARD - taunts her.
LEONARD
You're stupid!
LIZZY
No, you are!
LEONARD
They forgot you again!
LIZZY
No, they didn't!
LEONARD
Yes, they forgot and you're goin'
to wait out here until it's dark
and then the monsters are goin'
come and get you!
LIZZY
No they won't, because I'm walkin'
home!
Lizzy gets to her feet and starts walking.
Leonard
calls after her:
LEONARD
Come back, Lizzy! You can wait with
me! I got forgot too, you know!
Lizzy keeps going, marching across the deserted school
yard.
Leonard turns to go inside the school when he
bumps into a passing CULTIST.
The cultist pushes him
down as he follows after Lizzy.
LEONARD
(continuing)
Okay... I'm going to have to report
this!
Lizzy walks briskly along when she gets the feeling
she's being followed.
She turns and sees a cultist
standing behind a tree several dozen yards behind her.
Lizzy turns away and quickens her pace but when she
glances back, the figure is still standing... but
closer.
Scared, Lizzy turns and runs, dropping her books as
she flees down the sidewalk.
As she comes to the
street, a big black hearse suddenly pulls up in front
of her, the door swinging open wide.
Burned arms
reach out to grab Lizzy.
She screams.
The cultists grab Lizzy, pulling her into the car as
it roars off down the street.
CLOSE ON RAGGEDY ANN -- laying in the gutter.
CUT TO:
Jesse's car pulls up to a sea of police cars parked
in front of Meagan's house.
Meagan gets out of the
car and rushes inside.
As Murdoch enters, he spots Lizzy's night table and
the small glass menagerie there.
Murdoch picks up
the unicorn and admires it when a TROOPER draws his
attention to the floor next to the bed.
Laying there are several childlike drawings of Freddy,
including one that has "Freddy Lives" scrawled across
the top.
Meagan enters and sees the drawings.
She gasps.
TROOPER
Looks like she was in the cult all
along.
MEAGAN
No... no, she wouldn't do that!
Lizzy wouldn't join Freddy's cult!
TROOPER
I know it's hard to believe, miss.
But a lot of good kids get caught
up in this kind of trouble.
Murdoch stares at the drawings, his jaw muscles
tightening.
He clenches his fist, pulverizing the
little unicorn.
MURDOCH
Punks...
Murdoch drops the broken pieces of the unicorn on
the table as he exits the room, brushing past Meagan.
As the last of the cops drive away, Meagan pulls
Jesse out of the house.
JESSE
Where are we going?
MEAGAN
Over to Stormie's.
JESSE
Stormie? I thought you and her weren't
friends anymore since she stole that
twenty dollars from you.
MEAGAN
That was her "klepto" phase... when
she was dating that gang member.
She dumped him a long time ago.
JESSE
I still don't understand. What has
she got to do with Lizzy missing?
MEAGAN
She used to be in the Freddy cult.
Maybe she knows where they took
Lizzy.
They exit to Jesse's car.
CUT TO:
Jesse narrates a short, fuzzy, silent flashback as
younger-looking Renton Murdoch is BLASTING away at
Jason in panic.
JESSE
(V.O.)
Well... yeah. But Murdoch put
thirteen bullets in Jason before
he hacked his head open.
Jason cleaves Murdoch's head with a machete.
Murdoch
staggers back, raising his pistol.
JESSE
(V.O.,
continuing)
But even with his head hacked open
and his brains leaking out, Murdoch
still managed to put his last bullet
in Jason's eye.
Murdoch FIRES, the bullet SMACKING Jason in the eye.
Thick blood runs down the hockey mask as Murdoch's
body hits the ground.
Jesse, Meagan, and Stormie pull past the large sign
and into the parking lot.
As Jesse puts the car in
park, Meagan turns to him and says:
MEAGAN
I want you to stay here.
JESSE
Why?
MEAGAN
Don't be mad... it's just that you
might scare him.
JESSE
Scare him?
STORMIE
What she's subtly trying to tell
you is that this needs a woman's
gentle touch... butthead.
MEAGAN
Just stay here... okay?
Jesse grudgingly agrees.
Meagan kisses Jesse on the
cheek.
Stormie sticks her tongue out at him, then
turns as she and Meagan walk toward the main entrance.
Meagan, Jesse, and Stormie are standing in front of
a pay phone, arguing.
JESSE
No! I won't do it!
MEAGAN
Come on, Jesse! Please...?
JESSE
It's illegal! I could go to jail!
STORMIE
How will they ever know? Don't be
such a pussy!
JESSE
Oh, yeah? Why don't you call then?
STORMIE
Okay, I will!
MEAGAN
No! They'll never believe her!
STORMIE
I can disguise my voice...
(lowers voice)
Hello, how do you do? My name is
Jesse. I think I'm a man but I'm
actually a wimp.
MEAGAN
They'll never believe that. Come
on, Jesse... for me?
JESSE
Okay... okay... I'll do it.
(to Stormie)
And I'm not a wimp!
Jesse sighs and steps into the phone booth.
After a
moment's hesitation, Jesse steps out and immediately
both girls blurt out ten reasons why he should make
the call.
Jesse calls for quiet and as soon as both
girls shut up, he says:
JESSE
(continuing)
I need a quarter for the phone.
Meagan fishes out a quarter and hands it to him.
Jesse
re-enters the booth.
ANGLE IN PHONE BOOTH as Jesse dials a number.
The security guard picks up his phone as it RINGS.
SECURITY GUARD
Springwood Mental Center... how
can I help you?
JESSE
(filtered; disguising
his voice)
There's a bomb planted in your
building.
SECURITY GUARD
Who is this?
JESSE
If I were you -- I'd get my ass
out of there.
In the background, we hear Meagan and Stormie whisper
something to Jesse.
JESSE
(continuing; adding)
Oh, yeah... Freddy Lives.
CLICK! -- The guard's eyes grow wide.
The peaceful quiet of the asylum is shattered by a
fire ALARM.
Soon all the INMATES start filing out
into the yard, loosely herded by the GUARDS.
Erwin
files out with the others, still wearing his straight
jacket.
Erwin looks over at the parking lot -- Jesse's car
flashes it's lights.
Erwin starts to casually wander
off towards the fence between himself and freedom
when the SECURITY GUARD spots him and says:
SECURITY GUARD
Hey, Erwin... where do you think
you're going?
Erwin ignores him, still moving towards the fence.
SECURITY GUARD
(continuing)
I'm talking to you, asshole!
Erwin breaks into a run.
The guard takes off after
him.
In the car, Jesse, Meagan, and Stormie watch as the
guard closes the distance.
JESSE
He's not going to make it.
MEAGAN
We've got to do something!
With grim determination, Jesse starts his car.
Jesse's car tears out of the parking lot, racing for
the fence.
With a loud, metallic CHING, Jesse's car
drives into the fence, knocking that section down.
Erwin dances over the downed chain-link, diving into
an open window.
Then, with a SQUEAL of tires and the
RENDING of metal, Jesse's car backs out of the fence,
does a 180, and PEELS off.
ANGLE INSIDE CAR as Stormie and Meagan help Erwin out
of his straight jacket.
Once freed, Erwin extends his
hand to Jesse.
ERWIN
Hi, my name's Erwin. Thanks for
busting me out of there!
Jesse looks at Erwin's outstretched hand -- the
fingertips are all heavily bandaged.
JESSE
Yeah, right... Look, Erwin, just do
me one favor -- don't eat nothing
disgusting. My stomach is tight
enough as it is.
The security guard runs up to the fence, huffing and
puffing, watching as Jesse's car disappears down the
street.
Then he spots something in the fence and
plucks it out...
Jesse's front license plate.
CUT TO:
Several shadows flee into the night as Jesse's car
pulls up next to a run-down building.
Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin fall into a crazy night-
mare boiler room (visually reminiscent of the Freddy
pictures) with rusty catwalks, huge out-of-proportion
fixtures above and a sea of boiling water below.
As
they get to their feet, Meagan hears Lizzy's voice:
LIZZY
(distant)
Meagan... help me... please...
Meagan enters a shaft, following the sound when
suddenly, the shaft closes up behind her.
Stormie
and Erwin try to find the opening again but can't.
ERWIN
Freddy's trying to split us up...
Stormie and Erwin make their way through the creepy
boiler room, calling for Meagan.
A strange shadow
stalks them -- it's Freddy.
He drops down in front
of Erwin and Stormie.
FREDDY
Looking for some-body?
Freddy opens up his shirt to reveal a chest full of
lost souls.
In the center -- Meagan.
Stormie charges
Freddy, throwing her arms around him as she screams
to Erwin:
STORMIE
I've got him! Wake us up! Wake
us up!
But Erwin is paralyzed with fear.
STORMIE
(continuing)
Don't just stand there! Wake us up!
FREDDY
Hmmmmm... I feel like seafood tonight.
Suddenly, Stormie's arms have become huge lobster
claws.
She jerks away from Freddy, but too late --
Stormie starts to change into a giant lobster-woman!
Freddy smiles -- now he's wearing a chef's hat and
apron.
FREDDY
(continuing)
Stew on this, bitch!
Freddy knocks the lobster-woman over the side.
She
falls into the boiling water far below -- KER-SPLASH!
HARD CUT TO:
Stormie wakes with a start, yelling:
STORMIE
Shoot him! Shoot him!
Jesse spins, aiming the pistol.
But nothing is there.
Erwin wakes with a start.
Stormie smacks him.
STORMIE
You didn't help me, you pussy!
I could've had him!
(smacks him some more)
You gutless... spinless... jelly
fish!
Jesse looks over to where Meagan is still sleeping.
In his shack, listening to a small portable radio,
is the NIGHT WATCHMAN.
His small DOG suddenly perks
up her ears and GROWLS low.
The watchman turns down
the radio.
NIGHT WATCHMAN
What's matter, girl... you hear
somethin'?
Then the old man hears it, too... A low RUMBLE. Moving
closer.
The night watchman steps out of his shack and squints
into the darkness when a line of several hearses
approaches.
The lead hearse pulls up to the shack and
the driver's window rolls down.
NIGHT WATCHMAN
(continuing)
What's this? A funeral procession?
A Freddy cultist sticks his face out of the window
and says:
CULTIST
That's exactly what it is.
NIGHT WATCHMAN
(suspicious)
Yeah? Whose?
CULTIST
Yours.
BANG! -- the cultist SHOOTS the old man right through
the head.
The night watchman falls to the ground with
a lifeless THUD.
The little dog starts BARKING
ferociously when another SHOT silences her as well.
Another cultist leaps out of the hearse and runs to
the gate, cutting the chain with a pair of bolt
cutters.
He swings the gate open and the funeral
procession proceeds inside.
Headlights as Jesse's car zooms past a sign that
reads: CRYSTAL LAKE - 13 MILES.
JESSE
(V.O.)
We're almost there...
MEAGAN
(V.O.)
We should pull over and ask
directions.
STORMIE
(V.O.)
If it doesn't offend the men...
ooops, sorry! There aren't any.
JESSE
(V.O.)
Very funny.
Jesse pulls the car into an ol' run-down service
station.
STORMIE
I don't think they're open.
MEAGAN
It says, open all night.
Jesse HONKS the horn and yells:
JESSE
Hey! Can we get some service out
here?!
STORMIE
I don't think there's anybody
here...
Suddenly, a CRAZY OL' COOT appears on the opposite
side with a shotgun.
Everyone in the car jumps.
CRAZY OL' COOT
What do you kids want?
MEAGAN
We're looking for the old cemetery
that's supposed to be around here...
somewhere.
CRAZY OL' COOT
What do you want to know for?
STORMIE
We want to see it.
CRAZY OL' COOT
Ain't nothin' to see, girly...
'cept a bunch of ol' graves.
JESSE
Look, mister... can you give us
directions or not?
The old man gives the occupants of the car a going
over with his one good eye, hesitating a moment over
Erwin, who scrunches down in the back seat, hiding
under a baseball cap.
CRAZY OL' COOT
You're not goin' up there to do
somethin' stupid, are you?
JESSE
(laughs; nervous)
Stupid? Like what?
CRAZY OL' COOT
Like dig up Jason Voorhees --
that's what!
Everyone in the car takes a sharp breath -- cold
busted!
Then they start saying "No! No!" and shaking
their heads innocently in a big performance that
wouldn't fool a stick.
JESSE
(looks at Meagan)
Jesus... why would anyone do that?
CRAZY OL' COOT
I dunno... but people do.
STORMIE
Been dug up a few times already,
has he?
CRAZY OL' COOT
More times than I care to remember.
MEAGAN
Well, we're just doing an article
for our high school newspaper about
the dangers of breaking into
cemeteries at night. You know,
stuff that can get you hurt...
The ol' coot scans the foursome again closely as he
acquiesces.
CRAZY OL' COOT
Well... okay... as long as you're
not going up there to do something
stupid.
(pointing)
Take this road up about a mile and
make a left at the ol' saw mill.
That road will take you right on
in... Eternal Peace Cemetery --
can't miss it.
Jesse is already standing on the gas, leaving the
ol' coot standing in a cloud of smoke and dust.
Headlights skew across a rusty iron gateway -- ETERNAL
PEACE CEMETERY -- illuminating a sign: TRESPASSERS
WILL BE SHOT!
Meagan, Jesse, Stormie, and Erwin enter the shadowy
cemetery carrying lamps with shovels over their
shoulders.
As they search through the cemetery,
Meagan asks:
MEAGAN
What's the story on Jason Voorhees
anyway?
STORMIE
Where have you been? Jason was that
guy who ran around in a hockey mask,
chopping up camp counselors, duh?
MEAGAN
I knew that. What I mean was why?
ERWIN
It started a long time ago, back in
the fifties, when Jason drown at
Camp Crystal Lake. His mother went
berserk and started killing the
counselors.
STORMIE
She got her head chopped off by one
of the girls she was trying to kill!
ERWIN
Right. And then Jason came back from
his watery grave to get revenge.
JESSE
He came back from the grave?
ERWIN
Yeah. Chopped up a number of people
before they finally caught up to him.
MEAGAN
What happened to him then?
ERWIN
They killed him.
JESSE
How can you kill somebody who's
back from the grave?
ERWIN
Not very well apparently. Jason
keeps coming back to life and
chopping people up. It's a never
ending cycle of terror up here at
Crystal Lake -- a real problem.
MEAGAN
Why does he keep coming back to
life and killing people?
ERWIN
They say he's looking for revenge
on the camp counselor who murdered
him as a child. Jason just happens
to go about it in the socially
unacceptable way of hacking through
every teenager he finds until he
gets the right one.
(spots grave)
Here it is...
Erwin shines his light on Jason's grave.
ANGLE ON TOMBSTONE -- JASON VOORHEES. Born:1945.
Died:1953.
Beneath the death date, crudely scratched into the
stone: 1981, 1982, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1988, etc.
Jesse and Erwin start digging.
ELLIPSIS -- cemetery statues watching them dig.
Stormie and Meagan take their turn.
Then... Jesse
hits something solid.
Hands brush away the remaining dirt, exposing the
coffin below.
Jesse takes a sharp breath and then
jams a crowbar under the lid -- forcing it open.
The casket lid cracks open a bit when -- SSSSSS! --
noxious gas escapes.
Everyone covers their mouth
and nose, suppressing the urge to hurl.
Then roaches... hundreds of roaches.
Meagan and Stormie run off, screaming, batting at
their hair and clothing.
Jesse rolls around on
the ground.
Erwin sighs, plucks a roach off his
shirt, and calmly eats it.
CUT TO:
Meagan and Stormie stand just outside the grave,
holding the light and a can of bug spray.
Their
hair is up, covered in plastic shower caps.
Duct
tape around the cuffs of their pants.
They aren't
taking anymore chances with bugs.
Jesse and Erwin open the casket.
Everyone recoils
at the stench.
Then they shine their lights inside
-- nothing but rotting chunks and a broken hockey
mask.
CUT TO:
The kids putting several plastic trash bags full of
Jason into the trunk of Jesse's car and slamming
the lid closed.
Everyone piles into the car, exhausted.
In the back, Erwin picks his nose, unaware that
Stormie is watching him, her mouth gaping in horror.
Erwin becomes aware of Stormie's sickened scrutiny
and pulls out his finger, presenting it to Stormie.
ERWIN
Look... the boogerman!
(laughs)
Get it?!
Stormie slaps his hand away.
STORMIE
Get back, you nasty-ass bastard!
Ug! I thought I had seen the last
of those when my brother graduated
third grade!
ERWIN
We just dug up a rotting corpse and
you're worried about a little snot.
Jesse looks over at Meagan, curled up in a ball
beside him.
She purrs:
MEAGAN
I'm exhausted... wake me when we
get back home.
ERWIN
Uhhh... better not fall asleep --
we've still got a lot of work to
do and Freddy's out there... waiting.
This news sobers everyone up immediately.
STORMIE
Well, that means we've all got to
stay awake!
JESSE
Duh?!
MEAGAN
I know! We'll sing a song!
(starts singing)
Row! Row! Row your boat, gently down
the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily,
merrily... life is but a dream. Come
on, everybody!
Meagan leads the none-too-enthusiastic group in another
chorus of "Row Your Boat" as Jesse's car roars off into
the night.
DISSOLVE TO:
Meagan is leaning up against the door, murmuring softly
to herself as she drifts off to sleep:
MEAGAN
...merrily, merrily, merrily,
merrily... life is but a dream.
In the back seat, Erwin is nuzzled between Stormie's
breasts, sucking his thumb.
Both are fast asleep.
Jesse stares at the road ahead, his own eyelids
drooping.
The car starts to weave.
ANGLE OUT WINDSHIELD -- we flash past Freddy holding
a cardboard sign by the side of the road: WILL KILL
FOR FOOD.
Jesse shakes his head -- nah!
He tries to concentrate
on the road, his eyelids falling once more.
Jesse's car zooms past a billboard.
Behind the bill-
board -- a highway patrol car, a radar gun sticking
out of the driver's window.
CLOSE ON RADAR GUN as Jesse's car passes in the back-
ground, the red digits cascading up.
Freddy, now dressed as a highway patrolman, sits behind
the wheel.
The radar gun's display is reflected in
his mirrored shades.
It reads: KILL THEM.
FREDDY
Shouldn't dream and drive.
Freddy starts the car and pulls out, but what comes
out from behind the billboard isn't a patrol car --
it's Freddy's NIGHTMAREMOBILE -- big chrome pipes
belching HELLFIRE.
ANGLE IN JESSE'S REARVIEW MIRROR as Jesse's eyelids
close and his head nods forward, revealing the night-
maremobile closing from behind fast.
The nightmaremobile runs up to the back of Jesse's
car just an inch from the bumper.
Freddy moves one
of the dozen of levers on the dash.
CLOSE ON FREDDY'S HOOD ORNAMENT -- a small version
of Freddy's glove.
It extends out towards the back
of Jesse's car, one of the tiny knives inserting into
the trunk lock and turning with a slight CLICK. The
trunk lid opens.
ANGLE INSIDE TRUNK -- the plastic bags with Jason's
remains are moving!
Freddy works another level and
the tiny glove slits each bag.
The various pieces
of Jason (hands, boots, intestines, etc.) crawl out
of the bag.
FREDDY
(continuing)
Looks like the cat's out of the
bag now!
Freddy laughs as the tiny hand closes the trunk.
The nightmaremobile pulls out from behind Jesse's
car, BANGING into the rear quarter panel. WHAM! --
all four occupants of the car are jolted awake,
startled.
Meagan looks out her window and sees the
nightmaremobile as it closes in again.
MEAGAN
It's Freddy!
WHAM!
SPARKS fly.
Everyone screams.
Freddy laughs
as he falls back for another shot.
Meagan sees the
dozens of lost souls trapped in the back of the night-
maremobile, staring out at her through the back window.
A small yellow sign reads:
LOST SOULS ON BOARD.
Jesse fights to keep the car on the road when suddenly,
the pieces of Jason ATTACK, BURSTING from behind the
back seat.
One hand crawls up the back of the front
seat, leaping onto Jesse's throat.
Jason's intestines
EXPLODE out of the backseat, SLITHERING and SNAKING
their way around Stormie and Erwin.
One of Jason's
boots wiggles under the seat, making it's way towards
the gas peddle.
The other boot is content to lay
under the back window and kick Erwin in the head.
As Meagan fights to pull Jason's hand of Jesse's face,
she looks down and sees Jason's other hand between
her legs.
Meagan screams.
Jason's boot stomps on the gas and Jesse's car lurches
forward with the acceleration. The nightmaremobile
SLAMS into the side of Jesse's car again, causing it
to swerve violently from side to side.
Inside the nightmaremobile, Freddy pulls another lever.
CLOSE ON THE NIGHTMAREMOBILE FENDER as a panel opens
up and a circular sawblade arm extends out, CUTTING
into Jesse's car with a flurry of SPARKS.
Inside,
Meagan screams as the saw blade just misses her leg,
CUTTING forward towards...
CLOSE ON JESSE'S FRONT TIRE as the saw blade CUTS into
it.
The tire BLOWS and Jesse's car lurches off the
road, veering into a tree line.
CRASH! -- Jesse's car plows fender-first into a tree,
the HORN stuck on, BLARING.
Freddy laughs and kicks the nightmaremobile into
overdrive, ROARING OFF and disappearing with an
EXPLOSION of FIRE that wisps away in an instant.
In the distance -- an old farmhouse.
The lights go
on inside.
The passenger door opens and Meagan falls out onto the
ground, bleeding from a slight scalp wound.
A rear
door opens and Stormie and Erwin spill out, locked in
embrace and not seriously hurt.
Meagan staggers
around to the driver's side and opens the door.
Jesse
is laying unconscious against the steering wheel.
Meagan pulls him off the wheel and the HORN stops.
Jesse is splattered with blood and his leg is a mess.
MEAGAN
(continuing)
Jesse's hurt real bad... we've got
to get him to a doctor.
Through the farmhouse window, Erwin and Stormie see
the farmer on the phone.
ERWIN
Don't worry... an ambulance is on
the way.
Meagan cradles Jesse's head in her hands, crying:
MEAGAN
Oh, God... Jesse...
Erwin goes to the trunk and opens it.
Inside -- the
garbage bags with Jason's remains still inside --
untouched.
Erwin goes to Meagan and says:
ERWIN
Meagan... listen to me... The cops
are on their way. If they find me
and Jason Voorhees in the trunk
there, we're finished.
MEAGAN
Go... get out of here. Take Jason
and Stormie with you.
STORMIE
I'm staying with you.
Erwin grabs the trash bags out of the trunk and says:
ERWIN
I'll call you at the hospital.
STORMIE
How?
ERWIN
Somehow!
Erwin takes off, disappearing with Jason's remains
into the night as SIRENS WAIL in the distance --
growing close.
CUT TO:
Standing in the middle of the street is Jesse, dressed
in a cowboy sheriff's outfit complete with hat, badge,
and gunbelt.
Meagan calls to him from the saloon door.
MEAGAN
Jesse!
But Jesse can't hear her.
He's too busy shaking with
fear... staring at something coming down the street.
It's Freddy.
Dressed in a Black Bart cowboy outfit.
FREDDY
(ala John Wayne)
Okay, Sheriff... This nightmare
ain't big enough for the two of
us... draw!
Trembling with fear, Jesse fumbles for his pistol.
He pulls it out and FIRES.
Freddy laughs.
Jesse
FIRES again.
Freddy just laughs.
Jesse FIRES again
and again and again and Freddy just laughs and laughs
and laughs.
From the saloon, Meagan screams:
MEAGAN
Jesse! Wake up! Wake up!!
Freddy looks over at her, annoyed.
FREDDY
Three's a crowd, bitch! Why don't
you just go get [BEEP]
Jesse's stomach EXPLODES with BLOOD -- splattering
Meagan.
Jesse's heart monitor BEEPS continuously --
flat line.
Jesse is dead.
A NURSE shows up to answer the alarm.
She sees
Meagan standing over Jesse's body, covered in blood,
and screams.
Stormie enters the room a half-second later and
gasps.
MEAGAN
Freddy killed Jesse...
Stormie reaches in and grabs Meagan, pulling her out
of the room.
Stormie drags Meagan out of the hospital just as
Erwin pulls up in an old battered pick-up truck.
He throws open the door and Stormie pushes Meagan
inside, climbing in after her and asking:
STORMIE
Where'd you get the truck?
ERWIN
Same place I've got Jason hid.
STORMIE
And where's that?
ERWIN
A place where no one ever goes.
Stormie closes the door and the pick-up truck ROARS
out of the parking lot.
CUT TO:
The pick-up truck's headlights skew across a weather-
worn sign, peppered with bullet holes: CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE
Erwin drives the truck through the deserted camp,
past the cabins, down towards the lake.
He stops a
short distance away from the pier and the three of
them climb out.
Meagan is still in shock, letting Stormie guide her
as Erwin leads them down the pier to a small diving
platform tied up to the end.
STORMIE
What'd you do -- take him for a
swim?
ERWIN
Almost.
Erwin jumps down on the diving platform.
In the center,
a large form is covered by a tarp.
Erwin helps Stormie
down onto the platform, leaving Meagan standing on the
pier.
She looks out over the lake -- eyes vacant.
Erwin moves close to Stormie and, gesturing to Meagan,
asks:
ERWIN
(continuing)
Is she going to be alright?
STORMIE
I don't know. She's pretty fucked
up. God, I don't know why I'm not...
ERWIN
You're a strong woman.
STORMIE
What's that supposed to mean?
ERWIN
Uhhh... nothing. I didn't mean
anything.
Stormie gestures to the tarp.
STORMIE
Is this him?
ERWIN
Yeah...
(whips back tarp)
Meet the new and improved Jason.
ANGLE ON JASON laying spread eagle on the diving
platform, cocooned in chicken wire with dozens of
coiled leads trailing off into the water.
Erwin has
done a good job of sewing Jason back together with
barbed wire and fishing line.
His arms and legs have
been reinforced with steel braces and even Jason's
mask has been repaired, stitched down the middle with
bailing wire.
Jason looks nineties... and butch.
STORMIE
Why'd you put that stupid mask
on him?
ERWIN
Take a look...
Stormie bends down and takes a peek under the mask
and quickly replaces it.
STORMIE
Good idea.
ERWIN
Not exactly a beauty queen entry,
is he?
STORMIE
So what do we do now -- sing an Ozzy
Osbourne song backwards or something?
ERWIN
I'm afraid it's not that simple...
STORMIE
I thought you said you knew how to
bring him back to life?
ERWIN
I do! But when I was putting him
back together, I noticed something
was missing.
Stormie thinks about this for a second, then:
STORMIE
Awwww, he won't be needing that...
I mean, what girl would let him
put his rotten ol'...
ERWIN
(cuts her off)
No-no! Not that! It's his heart...
it's missing.
STORMIE
Well... does it really matter?
Can't you use an aquarium pump or
something?
ERWIN
No... he has to have a heart. A
human heart. A good one.
Meagan speaks for the first time:
MEAGAN
I know where we can get a heart...
A good one.
CUT TO:
A sign reads: CITY MORGUE.
Through the front window
a GUARD can be seen sitting at the reception desk.
Erwin, Stormie, and Meagan watch him from the pick-up,
parked a safe distance away.
ERWIN
That guard in there might pose a
problem.
MEAGAN
Do you think you and Stormie could
keep him occupied for a few minutes?
Erwin and Stormie exchange looks, then shrug -- why
not?
MEAGAN
(continuing)
Okay... let's do it.
A few moments later, the guard looks up as the pick-
up swerves wildly into the parking lot.
He gets up
and goes to the glass door, peering out.
ANGLE THROUGH GLASS DOOR as Stormie and Erwin start
making out -- hot and heavy.
At the glass door, the guard is watching the action
in the parking lot, his breath fogging the window.
He wipes the glass clean with his sleeve to get a
better look.
Inside the truck, Stormie and Erwin wrestle around.
STORMIE
Hey! Watch that!
ERWIN
I'm just trying to make it look real.
STORMIE
Just keep your hands above the bra,
pizza face.
The windows are starting to steam up.
The windows of the pick-up are now badly fogged,
obscuring the guard's view.
He licks his lips,
deciding to investigate closer.
The guard unlocks
the front door and starts toward Stormie and Erwin.
They spot him coming and break their embrace.
In
another moment, the pick-up is PEELING out of the
parking lot.
The guard watches the truck go, shakes
his head, and goes back inside to start his rounds.
Up the street, parked with the lights off in the night
shade of a large tree, Stormie and Erwin watch as the
guard starts down the glass enclosed hallway towards
the morgue.
STORMIE
He's head right for her! Do some-
thing!
Erwin panics for a moment, then HONKS the HORN.
Meagan is trying to pull Jesse's heart out of his
chest but it just won't come, some vein or muscle
fiber keeps pulling it back.
She jumps at the HORN,
then starts pulling harder.
In the hallway just outside, the guard hears the HORN
and stops.
He starts back for the front, when suddenly
the HORN stops.
Meagan hacks at the last bits of stringy goo that cling
to Jesse's heart.
As the last strand goes, Meagan
tumbles backwards to the floor with a loud THUD.
The guard hears that and turns back towards the morgue,
drawing his gun.
He tip-toes to the door and carefully
unlocks it, leaving his keys in the lock.
Taking a
two-handed Weaver stance, the guard raises his foot
and kicks the door.
WHACK! -- the door flies open and the guard leaps
inside like Marshall Dillon, snapping on the lights.
He gasps, eyes going wide as he scans the room.
One
of the drawers is open... the stiff's chest has got
a huge hole in it... blood spattered everywhere...
a bunch of bloody footprints leading over to the
cabinet...
Suddenly, the guard sees Meagan half out the window
and cries:
GUARD
Stop right there!
Meagan rolls out of the window just as the guard FIRES.
The unbroken section of the window SHATTERS.
The guard
curses and races for the...
The guard comes running out just in time to see Meagan
close the passenger door and the truck ROAR away.
He
shrinks, dejected -- no way to catch them now.
The
guard heads back inside to report this mess and finds
that the door has closed and locked behind him.
CUT TO:
The crazy ol' coot is leading Murdoch through the
cemetery.
CRAZY OL' COOT
They said they were writin' for
some newspaper...
MURDOCH
Teenagers are notorious liars.
CRAZY OL' COOT
Well, after I heard about the
accident on my police scanner, I
came up here to have a look. When
I found it I figured you'd want to
know right away.
MURDOCH
You did the right thing.
The ol' coot shines his light down into Jason's empty
grave.
CRAZY OL' COOT
Damn kids... I just knew they were
comin' up here to do somethin'
stupid.
The S.W.A.T. commander comes up to Murdoch.
S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
Just got a call on the radio --
three juveniles just broke into the
morgue -- one male, two female. The
guard is pretty sure the male is in
the Freddy cult -- burnt face.
CRAZY OL' COOT
Sounds like the same kids I saw.
MURDOCH
Did the guard say what they took?
S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
Yeah... that murdered kid, Jesse --
they carved his heart out.
(beat)
They got away in a pick-up -- the
guard didn't get the license. You
want me to put out an A.P.B.?
MURDOCH
No... that won't be necessary. I
know just where they're going, and
just what they're up to. And this
time... I'll be ready.
CUT TO:
Meagan sits on the end of the pier, watching silently
as Erwin sews Jesse's heart into Jason's chest using
dental floss.
Stormie comes up behind her and puts
her jacket around Meagan's shoulders, sits down beside
her and says:
STORMIE
You've got to quit blaming your-
self for what happened to Jesse...
it wasn't your fault.
MEAGAN
He didn't want to come with us...
but he did anyway. He did it for me.
STORMIE
I'm not sorry I came... I don't
think Jesse would be, either.
MEAGAN
I just can't believe he's dead. I
keep thinking he'll show up any
minute...
ERWIN
Well, that just about does it...
Erwin finishes sewing up Jason and climbs back onto
the pier, cutting the diving platform free.
He kicks
it off and it floats out into the lake, drifting free.
Then Erwin herds the girls down the shore, leading
them over to where a short trench has been dug leading
from the water's edge.
In the bottom of the trench -- an uncovered power
cable.
ERWIN
(continuing)
As you can see, I've excavated the
power cable that runs across the
bottom of Crystal Lake. I've cut
away the insulation, exposing a
patch of cable right near the water's
edge.
Erwin picks up a nearby bucket of water and sets it
at the head of the trench.
ERWIN
(continuing)
Now when I kick this over, the water
will wash down the trench and bridge
an eletrical gap between the cable
and the lake. There's plenty of
voltage, so it should work.
STORMIE
So you kick the bucket and Jason
lives.
ERWIN
Yeah, right...
(then)
Okay, keep your fingers crossed...
Erwin kicks the bucket over.
The water washes down
the trench, over the cable, and -- POW! Z-Z-Z-ZAP!
A huge SPARK HITS EXPLODES.
Then the lake begins to
glow and the water begins to churn.
Erwin and the
girls jump back as ELECTRICITY ARCS from the lake,
engulfing the diving platform.
The ARCS of ELECTRICITY leap from the chicken wire
onto Jason's body, his massive frame convulsing.
CLOSE ON HOCKEY MASK as we PUSH IN -- the electricity
spirals down into the eye hole like water running
down a drain.
CLOSE ON JASON'S EYE as it opens!
We dive into the
eye and take a fantastic dream/time travel to...
OPTICAL TRANSITION TO:
CLOSE ON MASK (1950's version of a hockey mask)
reflected in the water.
A young hand reaches up and
pulls off the mask, revealing the disfigured boy
beneath.
This is JASON -- AGE 9.
JASON'S FATHER comes to the doorway of their run-
down cabin in dirty longjohns, holding a bottle of
rye. He bellows:
JASON'S FATHER
Jason! Git your ass over here!
Jason jumps at his father's voice, hesitates only
slightly, then runs toward him, stopping abruptly
several paces away.
JASON'S FATHER
(continuing)
What did I teach you, boy? Don't
ever take your mask off out in
public. I don't want nobody to see
that ugly mug of yours.
Jason stands, looking at his bare feet. His father
smacks him upside the head, shoving him towards the
woodshed.
JASON'S FATHER
(continuing)
Go git in the woodshed.
Jason's pace slows as he enters the dark shed -- he
knows what's coming next.
JASON'S FATHER
(continuing)
Drop them overalls and lay over
them logs...
Jason slowly complies as his father loosens his belt.
Suddenly, JASON'S MOTHER is just outside the doorway,
calling:
JASON'S MOTHER
Jason! Come here!
Jason gives his father a sideways glance, then scurries
towards his mother.
JASON'S FATHER
What are you doing woman?
Jason's mother gives him a mason jar stuffed with
dollars and change.
JASON'S MOTHER
I saved up some money... I want
you to take and go on up to that
summer camp just up the road. Tell
the man you want to stay there.
JASON'S FATHER
Just what the hell do you think
you're doing, bitch?!
JASON'S MOTHER
I'm sending him away for a few weeks.
JASON'S FATHER
You ain't sending him nowhere.
(to Jason)
Bring me that money, boy!
Jason holds his ground for a second, unsure whom to
obey, when his mother shoos him away.
JASON'S MOTHER
Go on now... go!
Jason takes off up the road.
His father sneers:
JASON'S FATHER
Goin' ag'in me? I'll take you to
the shed, woman!
Jason's mother pulls a knife from her apron.
JASON'S MOTHER
You ain't ever taking anyone to
the shed ever again.
Jason's mother charges at her husband, shoving him
back into the shed with the knife.
Jason looks back.
Through the open window he sees his mother's arm
coming down repeatedly with the knife, his father's
arms flailing helplessly.
Then both disappear from
view.
After a moment his mother appears in the door-
way, spattered with blood.
She smiles and waves to
him, calling:
JASON'S MOTHER
(continuing)
Go on, son... have a good time!
Mommy will come and git you some
day soon!
Jason turns and runs to...
Wearing his mask, Jason walks through the entrance
to the camp with his jar of money.
In the office, the HEAD COUNSELOR takes his money
and shakes his hand.
HEAD COUNSELOR
Welcome aboard, son! I'm sure
you'll have a great time!
CUT TO:
The other KIDS dance around Jason, taunting him...
laughing at him... pointing and teasing... Jason
breaks away, running towards the pier.
Jason sits at the end of the pier, looking at his own
reflection.
He removes the mask and watches as the
distortions in the water make his face look normal.
Someone comes up behind Jason slowly.
Jason isn't
aware of their presence until a shadowy reflection
appears behind his own.
Jason turns to see who when
he is suddenly pushed into the lake.
Jason splashes to the surface, sputtering, trying to
stay afloat.
A hand pushes his head back under the
water.
JASON'S UNDERWATER P.O.V. -- a distorted image of
whoever is holding him under.
Jason thrusts out his arms, fighting to get back to
the surface... fighting just to see who is killing
him before he dies.
HARD CUT TO:
Jason comes alive, thrashing around on the diving dock,
the electricity all over him like a spider web. On
shore, Erwin and the girls gasp.
ERWIN
Holy shit! It worked!
Meagan and Stormie bounce, excitedly.
But something
is wrong.
Jason thrashes around on the dock, unable
to break the crisscross of high voltage chicken wire.
MEAGAN
It's kill him! Shut it off! Shut
it off!
ERWIN
Shut it off... it suddenly occurs
to me that I hadn't really planned
for that contingency.
STORMIE
Just don't stand there! Do something!
But all Erwin can do is scratch his head.
Meagan
rushes to the shore line and screams out over the lake:
MEAGAN
Jason! JASON! You've got to get up!
Do you hear me? Get up!
Jason clenches his meaty fists and SLAMS them down
against the diving dock. SMASHING it to bits.
Water
rushes over him and -- ZZZZT! KA-POW!
A power transformer on shore EXPLODES, causing Meagan
and her friends to cringe.
When they look back, the
electrical light show fades away, leaving nothing but
smoke and floating debris.
Meagan and Stormie turn to
Erwin, who shrugs shyly and says:
ERWIN
Well... it's off now.
Meagan and Stormie begin a verbal barrage that would
shrink any man to pus... much less Erwin.
He cowers
between them, offering quick excuses and humble
apologies.
All three are so wrapped up in laying blame that they
never notice Jason's shadowy figure as it rises from
the lake.
Then they do see him... scream and run.
Jason charges
after the kids in his familiar "unstoppable killer"
gait.
Erwin ducks inside the tool shed as Meagan and Stormie
dash past.
He closes the door behind him and squirms
out a tiny window just as Jason kicks open the door
and steps inside.
Erwin races around to the front
and closes the door.
He fastens the latch and padlock,
then calls to the girls:
ERWIN
(continuing)
Hey! Come back! I've got him locked
up in the tool shed!
Just then, the SOUND of a CHAINSAW as the blade RIPS
through the tool shed door.
Erwin screams like a
girl and runs away.
Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin come out with their hands
raised high above their heads.
As they walk towards
the police cars, several of the S.W.A.T. team moves
in and arrests them.
As they are handcuffed and
searched, Murdoch goes on the bullhorn again:
MURDOCH
(through bullhorn)
Alright... anybody else left in
there had better say their prayers!
ERWIN
There's no one else inside.
MURDOCH
Is that a fact?
(into bullhorn)
Okay... you had your chance!
Suddenly, one of the cops points towards the cabin
and shouts:
COP
Hey, look!
All heads turn towards the cabin, where Jason's
massive frame is filling the doorway.
S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
Holy Mary, mother of God... would
you look at the size of that guy?
MURDOCH
(almost happy)
I knew it!
All the cops level their weapons at Jason when Murdoch
suddenly steps forward, gesturing for everyone to get
behind him.
MURDOCH
(continuing)
Stand back! I'll handle this.
Murdoch takes a few steps towards the cabin and sneers:
MURDOCH
(continuing)
You...
Jason raises the chainsaw -- he remembers Murdoch too.
Murdoch goes for his gun, but instead of bringing out
a pistol, he holds a laser designator.
Murdoch fires.
A big red dot appears on Jason's chest.
Jason looks
down at it like it was a harmless bug.
He looks back
up at Murdoch, who raises a radio to his lips and says:
MURDOCH
(continuing;
into radio)
Let her go.
A military jet flying above drops it's payload -- a
laser-guided napalm bomb.
A slight WHISTLE sound grows in the skies above Camp
Crystal Lake.
Jason looks up.
SMART BOMB P.O.V. as it drops down on Jason -- homing
in on the laser dot on his chest.
BA-BOOM! -- Camp Crystal Lake EXPLODES in flames.
All the cops take cover as FIRE RAINS DOWN on them.
Only Murdoch stands his ground, his arms outstretched
as he embraces the terrible sight.
MURDOCH
That'll teach you to fuck with the
law, Voorhees!
A cop behind him says:
COP
Uhh, sir... your hat's on fire.
Murdoch looks up -- sure enough, his Smokey Bear hat
is burning above the brim.
Meagan watches as Camp Crystal Lake is consume in
flames, her last hope of saving Lizzy -- gone.
Then
a cop shoves her into a police car with Stormie.
Erwin is put into another car and the three exchange
worrisome looks through the windows just before the
cars pull away.
As the cops start to pull out, one of them notices
something moving amidst the flames -- a large BURNING
form, walking towards the lake.
As it stumbles out
onto the pier, the cop turns to his partner and says:
CURIOUS COP
Hey... do you see that?
But just then, the form falls through the BURNING
pier, SPLASHING into the water below.
The partner
looks, sees nothing, and shrugs.
PARTNER
See what?
CURIOUS COP
I thought I saw something...
He shrugs it off and exits after his partner.
Murdoch, his hat still smoking a little, surveys the
sight one last time before climbing into his patrol
car and driving away.
CUT TO:
MEAGAN'S MOM
Meagan, Captain Murdoch here said
you helped one of those cultists
escape from a hospital?
MEAGAN
A mental hospital.
MEAGAN'S MOM
And he said you desecrated a cemetery
and some other really terrible things.
Tell me you had nothing to do with
it. Tell me there's some mistake...?
MEAGAN
There's no mistake.
(to Murdoch)
What did you do with Erwin?
MURDOCH
Your boyfriend is headed back to the
looney bin where he belongs. But
don't worry, you'll be seeing him
soon enough... at the arraignment.
Now the size of a flea, Stormie is clinging to one
of hundreds of pointed tree trunks jutting out from
the circular walls -- Freddy's nose hairs.
Stuck in
those humongous hairs are clumps of icky gunk --
boogers.
Sitting next to Stormie, a particularly large and
rotund booger clump opens its eyes and says (in the
distorted voice of Harry Manfredini):
BOOGERMAN
Hi there! I'm the Boogerman! Heh-
heh... get it?
Stormie screams, backing up into the "trees", trying
to put distance between herself and Boogerman.
BOOGERMAN
(continuing)
Aww, don't go... we can play "Star
Wars". You can be Princess Leia and
I'll be Jabba the Hutt!
Boogerman licks his fat, nasty lips with a slimy green
tongue -- he does kinda look like Jabba.
Stormie
screams again.
As the deputy brings Meagan back to her cell they
hear a loud SPLAT!
MEAGAN
Stormie?!
The deputy pushes Meagan back as she moves forward
cautiously, glancing around the wall into Stormie's
cell... then promptly puking combo burrito.
Meagan
runs up and looks.
The wall to Stormie's cell is
splattered with blood and bits.
Meagan falls to her knees, sobbing as more DEPUTIES
come running into the cellblock, answering the
deputy's puke-choked scream.
MEAGAN
(continuing)
Oh, God... what have I done? What
have I done?!
We BOOM OUT of this chaos and go to...
An ambulance races along the road with it's emergency
lights flashing.
In back Erwin lays strapped to a
gurney.
Up front sit a DRIVER and an ATTENDANT.
They
chat disparagingly about the freak in the back, when
suddenly a large form appears in the road just ahead.
The driver slams on the brakes and the wheels lock up
with a terrible SQUEAL.
WHUMP! -- the ambulance plows into the form, knocking
it some fifty feet down the road.
The driver and the
attendant stare out of the cracked windshield in shock.
Finally, the driver turns to the attendant and says:
AMBULANCE DRIVER
I'll go check it out. You stay here.
The driver gets out and goes to the form laying in the
road.
He bends down to examine the charred, mammoth
carcass when a fist flies up, smacking the driver in
the face.
He falls to the ground, unconscious.
The corpse sits up in the glare from the headlights --
it's Jason!
Burnt and blackened but ready for action!
He starts towards the ambulance.
The attendant gets out and pulls his service revolver,
emptying into Jason's chest.
Jason recoils only
slightly as BULLET HITS BURST his coveralls, then he
grabs the attendant by the head as he snaps the empty
pistol in panic.
Jason slams the attendant's face
into the side of the ambulance.
In the back of the ambulance, a terror-stricken Erwin
watches as a face shaped dent appears in the wall with
a sickening WRENCHING of METAL and FLESH.
Then...
silence.
RIP! -- Jason pulls off the back door of the ambulance
and climbs inside, the shocks bottoming out under his
weight.
He reaches out for Erwin, who closes his
eyes... waiting for the inevitable.
Then... nothing.
After a second, Erwin opens an eye.
Jason is standing
over him, hand outstretched.
In his big, burnt palm
-- Meagan's necklace.
Erwin looks from the necklace
to Jason.
Jason thrusts out his hand impatiently.
ERWIN
You... want me to tell you where
Meagan is?
Again with the thrusting.
ERWIN
(continuing)
Well why didn't you say so?! Jesus,
for a minute there I thought you
were going to kill me.
(then)
You're not, are you?
Jason shakes his palm at Erwin yet a third time.
ERWIN
(continuing)
Okay... okay! I'll take you right
to her. Could you help me out of
this?
Jason reaches over and yanks out the gurney straps.
Erwin exits out the back with Jason following close
behind.
Erwin climbs in behind the wheel, saying:
ERWIN
(continuing)
I'll drive.
Jason pushes Erwin aside so roughly that he slams into
the passenger side door.
ERWIN
(continuing)
Okay... you drive.
As Jason climbs into the driver's seat, a CHIME goes
off as a female COMPUTER VOICE in a pleasant tone says:
COMPUTER VOICE
Fasten your safety belt, please.
Erwin fastens his.
Jason watches him and pulls the
safety belt across his massive chest -- it won't reach.
Jason pulls harder, ripping the belt out of the bolts.
The CHIME goes crazy.
COMPUTER VOICE
(continuing)
Fasten your safety belt, please...
Fasten your safety belt, please...
Jason SMASHES the dashboard with his fist, silencing
the voice and chime.
He turns suddenly to Erwin as if
to say, "Yeah?! What about it?"
Erwin shrugs nervously:
ERWIN
Fuck the bitch. Let's roll!
With tires SQUEALING, burning rubber and smoke, the
ambulance roars away into the early morning.
DISSOLVE TO:
Meagan stares through the bars of her cell at the sun
as it peeks out over the horizon.
The deputy gets up
to leave for the six a.m. shift change.
As she goes,
she switches on the cellblock TV.
ANGLE ON TV -- An early morning religious program
is on.
RELIGIOUS ANNOUNCER
(filtered)
This is Channel 12 -- Station W.G.O.D.
-- where the "W" stands for "Worship"
And now... "Daily Affirmation" with
Reverend Lawrence Lovejoy...
A shot of the REVEREND LOVEJOY at the podium in his
studio, giving kind words of encouragement.
REVEREND LOVEJOY
Good morning, friends... the Good
Book says that each morning brings
a new light into our lives...
The good reverend goes on about it always being darkest
before the dawn, have faith and your prayers will be
answered, etc.
Meagan turns and watches the sunrise
-- glorious.
Tears stream down her cheeks.
Then a
commercial comes on:
RELIGIOUS ANNOUNCER
(filtered)
You can own a videotape of Reverend
Lovejoy's Daily Affirmation for only
$19.95...
CUT TO:
In his booth at the main gate, the GATE GUARD watches
as a procession of hearses approaches.
As the first
hearse reaches the gate, the guard steps out and says:
GATE GUARD
Hello. What can I do for you?
A cultist sticks his head out the window and says:
CULTIST
We're here to see the Reverend
Lovejoy. We need him to perform a
wedding.
GATE GUARD
Do you have an appointment?
CULTIST
No. I have a Beretta.
The cultist produces a pistol -- BANG!
The cultists break into the control room, killing the
DIRECTOR and STAFF.
One slips into the sound booth,
garroting the RELIGIOUS ANNOUNCER with a piece of wire.
Another SMASHES the control board, killing the signal.
All the feed monitors go snowy.
The bitches come running butt-naked and screaming
through the station.
Several deputies chase after
them, tackle them and try to cuff them.
A brawl
ensues.
Chaos.
Murdoch sits on a desk, reading a report.
He looks
up at the madness and mutters:
MURDOCH
Punks...
Meagan exits the station just as a patrol car pulls
up.
She reaches in and grabs the JUNIOR TROOPER,
pulling him out.
Then she slips behind the wheel
and ROARS off.
The junior trooper calls after her:
JUNIOR TROOPER
Hey, that's Captain Murdoch's car!
CUT TO:
Outside, the cultists surrounding the outside of the
station watch as dozens of police vehicles swarm to
the fence.
Murdoch and the S.W.A.T. commander get
out of the lead car.
Murdoch picks up his bullhorn
and says:
MURDOCH
(through bullhorn)
This is Captain Renton Murdoch --
State Trooper. I'm giving you until
the count of three to come out with
your hands up...
A CULTIST SNIPER FIRES a shot at Murdoch, the bullet
hit SMASHING the emergency lights atop his car.
The
other cops duck down, but not Murdoch, he turns
calmly to the S.W.A.T. commander and says:
MURDOCH
(continuing)
Hand me that flare pistol.
The commander gives the flare gun to Murdoch, adding:
S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
Good idea. Throw a little light on
them -- see if we can spot their
firing positions...
As the commander speaks, Murdoch aims the pistol
carefully and FIRES.
PHOOMPH! -- the flare streaks
to the roof of the TV station, SMACKING the sniper.
He BURSTS into FLAMES and tumbles to the ground,
screaming.
Murdoch hands the flare gun back to the
commander, going back on the bullhorn and saying:
MURDOCH
(through bullhorn)
Alright, now I'm through playing
"nice guy" -- I want the rest of
you punks to come out right now
with your hands up.
The cultists respond by filling the air with hot lead
-- BULLET HITS RIDDLE the cop cars, SMASHING glass
and PIERCING metal.
The cops FIRE back, BULLET HITS
EXPLODING all along the sides of the TV station.
The cultists bare Meagan's arm and inject her with
dream dope.
She takes her place at the threshold
beside Freddy.
As the battle outside between the cultists and the
cops RAGES, Murdoch and the S.W.A.T. commander squat
down behind a fender to reload.
S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
Well, it doesn't look like they're
going to surrender.
MURDOCH
What we're going to need then is
somebody to charge their lines --
make a hole for us to slip in.
S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
Where are you going to find anyone
that crazy?
Just then, an ambulance comes ROARING through the
police lines, causing the cops to scurry like mice.
MURDOCH
Here comes one now...
(yells)
GO GIT 'EM, SON!
Murdoch squints to see who's driving... it's Jason!
Erwin smiles and waves to Murdoch through the passenger
side window as the ambulance zooms past.
Murdoch curses, drawing his pistol and SHOOTING after
the ambulance.
The other COPS join in a moment later, BULLET HITS
SPARKING off the back of the ambulance as it CRASHES
through the front gate.
Inside the ambulance, Erwin hazards a glance back at
the cops, then he turns to Jason and says:
ERWIN
That was easy enough...
Erwin looks ahead and screams.
ANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD as three cultists stand
directly in front of the speeding ambulance, FIRING
machine guns.
The glass EXPLODES just as Erwin
ducks down.
Two cultists suddenly scatter as Jason rams the
ambulance into the middle one just before plowing
into the side of the station with a CRASH.
Erwin pushes down his airbag just in time to see a
cultist closing in with a gun.
He reaches through the
smashed windshield and grabs the squashed cultist's
machine gun laying on the hood.
Erwin turns, SHOOTS
the cultist just in time.
As Jason kicks open the driver's side door he is
greeted by two cultists SHOOTING at him.
Jason RIPS
OFF the driver's side door and hurls it at the two
punks, knocking them down like bowling pins.
Then
Jason reaches back into the ambulance, pulls out the
Jaws of Life and, with Erwin covering his back, starts
towards the front door.
DING!
The bell sounds again and round two begins.
Freddy and Jason get to their feet and close in on
each other.
Jason swings wide.
Freddy ducks under
Jason's massive fist just as the referee steps in for
a close look.
WHUMP -- Jason knocks the ref's head
OFF, it goes flying up into the balcony.
The crowd
CHEERS.
Jason chases Freddy around the ring, looking for an
opening.
Freddy backpeddles, tripping over the ref's
decapitated body as several HUNGRY ZOMBIES drag him out
of the ring, RIPPING his body apart and DEVOURING it.
Up in their cage, Meagan and Lizzy grimace with
disgust.
Jason reaches down and grabs Freddy, hoisting him
high above his head.
Then Jason body slams Freddy
to the mat.
The crowd CHEERS.
Jason starts jumping up and down on Freddy's back.
Freddy reaches into his shirt and brings out a rusty
can of spinach.
In a grotesque parody of Popeye he
opens the can -- full of nasty worms and maggots --
and gulps it down.
Suddenly, Freddy throws Jason off
his back and stands, huge muscles ballooning on his
chest and arms.
At the end of his right hand -- a
heavy metal boxing glove.
Jason gets to his feet in time to see Freddy cock the
massive glove for a blow.
CHING! -- dozens of spikes spring out of the metal
glove.
Freddy swings, knocking Jason into the ropes.
He bounces off and falls to the mat.
The fans go nuts.
As Jason tries to get up, Freddy swings his right arm
around and around -- the metal boxing glove turning
into a giant mallet.
Jason looks up just in time to
see the mallet coming down.
WHAM! -- Freddy drives
Jason into the mat.
The crowd goes wild.
>From up in her cage, Meagan starts to scream:
MEAGAN
Jason! Get up! Get up!
ANGLE UNDER THE MAT -- it's a dark, foreboding (under-
water) abyss.
Jason's legs kick, trying to get back
up.
Something slithers up from out of the deep...
wisps of empty blackness clutching at Jason's boots.
Freddy pushes down on Jason's mask, shoving him down.
Jason struggles but keeps slipping.
This looks like
the end of Jason.
Freddy laughs.
MEAGAN
(continuing)
Jason! You've got to get up!
JASON'S P.O.V. of Freddy looking down at him, pushing
him down... drowning him...
FLASH CUT TO:
YOUNG JASON P.O.V. as he is being drowned.
He fights
to get to the surface... to see... who it is...
Young Jason breaks the surface for an instant and
his killer comes into sharp focus.
It's FREDDY (AGE 13).
His Camp Crystal Lake nametag
reads:
Hi! My name is Freddy!
He pushes the young
Jason down again, laughing.
HARD CUT TO:
Freddy pushes Jason down into the abyss below the
mat... laughing, when Jason snaps.
With a burst
of strength he kicks upward, coming up out of the
mat.
Jason grabs Freddy by the throat and seizes
him up with him.
Jason's momentum carries both of them up to the
ceiling, where they CRASH through to...
The remaining cultists SHOOTING it out with the
police suddenly grab their heads, screaming.
Their
heads IMPLODE and they fall to the ground.
Murdoch
sees this and says to the S.W.A.T. commander:
MURDOCH
Now's my chance... give me sixty
seconds to get in there then move
in.
Before the commander can reply, Murdoch is off and
running into the station.
The satellite dish mounted on the roof.
It begins
to pulsate with an olive and red glow -- getting
ready to beam Freddy.
The roof gives way, tilting the big dish just as it
BLASTS the laughing Freddy-beam into the night sky.
The Freddy-beam just misses the satellite, ricocheting
off one of the solar panels and sending the satellite
tumbling into deep space.
The deflected Freddy-beam now zooms towards the sun.
Inside the beam -- Freddy sees the sun zooming up
and screams.
His face burns away, leaving a screaming
skull.
That too burns away, leaving the Dream Demons.
One by one they burn up as the beam reaches the sun.
ANGLE ON THE SUN as the beam EXPLODES, causing a
solar prominence.
