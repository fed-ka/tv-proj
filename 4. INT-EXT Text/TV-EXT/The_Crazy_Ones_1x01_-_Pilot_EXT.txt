      Andrew and Sydney walk.

                                        ANDREW
                    You got to admit, it is exciting. 
                    Mariah Carey coming in to our
                    recording studio.

                                        SYDNEY
                    Under totally false pretenses.

                                        ANDREW
                    Even so.
                          (off her look)
                    What's wrong?

                                        SYDNEY
                    Nothing's wrong.

                                        ANDREW
                    Hey.  It's me.

      They stop outside her apartment building.  Hold a look.  

                                        SYDNEY
                    Did you hear the words coming out
                    of my mouth today?  "Creative is
                    what sells."  I'm not the person I
                    set out to be in life.

                                        ANDREW
                    Who is?  My passion for advertising
                    comes from not being able to sell
                    my screenplay.  We all...

                                        SYDNEY
                    Settle?
                          (off his look)
                    There, I said it aloud, the dirty
                    little secret is out, "I've settled,"
                    it's not my life dream after all,
                    to write copy for Chicken McNuggets. 
                    Who knew? 

                                        ANDREW
                          (simply)
                    Your life dream is to be your dad.

                                        SYDNEY
                    And I'm not.  Maybe that's what...
                    what he did today, the stuff he
                    came up with... I could never...

                                        ANDREW
                    You're being crazy.

                                        SYDNEY
                    Really?  You're not just saying
                    that to make me feel better? 
                          (off Andrew)
                    I'm not crazy, that's the problem. 
                    I'm reasonable.  I'm practical. 
                    Life gets choked out of me by common
                    sense.

      He takes her hand.  Smiles.  

                                        ANDREW
                    Now you listen.  As genius, or nuts,
                    as your father is, this place is
                    you.  And has been for awhile. 
                    You're our creative director.  Our
                    producer.  You're the main reason
                    Zach, Lauren, and I so love our
                    jobs.

                                        SYDNEY
                          (moved)
                    You are without doubt the sweetest
                    person I have ever met.

      A beat.  Uh oh.  Andrew makes the fatal best-friend
      mistake, he leans in to kiss her.  SHE SNORTS.

                                        ANDREW
                    Sorry.  Sorry.

                                        SYDNEY
                    It's okay.
                          (SNORT)
                    No worries.
                          (SNORT)

                                        ANDREW
                          (mortified)
                    Sydney, I am so...

                                        SYDNEY
                    It never happened.  No worries.  No
                    worries.

                                        SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                          (SNORT)
                    None.  

      An awkward beat.  Finally--

                                        SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                      I should... Big day tomorrow, Mariah
                    Carey, we should hit the sack.
                          (quickly)
                    Not together.  Ha.  Kidding.
                          (SNORT)

                                        ANDREW
                    I've really fucked things up, haven't
                    I?

                                        SYDNEY
                    No, no, no.  Don't be silly.
                          (a beat)
                    Well.  'Night.

      She gives him a peck on the cheek, quickly turns to
      enter her building.  Womp!  She hits the door.

                                        ANDREW
                          (opening the door)
                    Better to open it first.

                                        SYDNEY
                    I'm okay.  'Night.

      And she disappears into the building, holding her
      forehead.  OFF Andrew, we: 

                                                              SMASH CUT TO BLACK.

      Sydney walks to work as WE HEAR THE SAUCY BEAT OF THE
