      EXT. TOWN - NIGHT

      Open tight on a light blue DOME, fragile and perfect.

      All is still, until this dome s exterior CRACKS.  Something 
      inside is starting to break free.  At first, the emerging 
      creature looks like a MONSTER -- a writhing lump of flesh 
      with gummed-shut eyes and a screaming yellow maw.

      But as we pull back, it becomes clear that our dome is 
      actually an EGG, and that the creature inside is a baby 
      EASTERN BLUEBIRD, one that will presumably grow up to look 
      much like the gorgeous MOTHER BIRD we can now see watching 
      over this nest.

      With her newborn chick already demanding food, the mother 
      bird launches into the air, flying past a faded green metal 
      sign by the side of the road:

                                        CHESTER S MILL
                                          Pop. 1,976

      As the bird cuts across Chester s Mill, so do we, following 
      as she gives us a pre-dawn tour of what seems to be a typical 
      small town in contemporary America... in that it s just 
      barely scraping by.  Some of the bucolic houses are marred by 
      FORECLOSED signs, but most are still occupied by the same 
      families that have carved out lives here for generations.

      Flying past the steeple of HOLY REDEEMER CHURCH, the bluebird 
      swoops through the town s central thoroughfare, where a mix 
      of chain stores and local mainstays like the SWEETBRIAR ROSE 
      DINER and BOWIE S DRUGS have weathered the economic downturn 
      with varying degrees of success.  

      Flapping hard now, mama bird presses deeper into the dark 
      heart of Chester s Mill, the Black Ridge Woods.


      EXT. BLACK RIDGE WOODS - NIGHT

      Entering this vast forest in search of crickets, the bird 
      stops at a tree overlooking a clearing, where she notices a 
      COMPACT CAR parked next to a fresh HOLE in the ground.  
      SHUNK.  A clump of dirt flies out of this pit, startling mama 
      bird, who disappears into the night.  

      And that s when a HAND appears at the lip of this freshly dug 
      grave.

      A SHIRTLESS MAN drenched in sweat pulls himself out of the 
      earth.  DOG TAGS glisten around his neck.  As we ll later 
      learn, this 30-something Army veteran is DALE  BARBIE  
      BARBARA.             UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   2.


      Barbie s face is bruised and cut.  It looks like he s just 
      survived the worst night of his life. 

      Exhausted, Barbie ambles over to his car and opens its small 
      trunk.  Inside is the CORPSE OF AN ADULT MALE, hurriedly 
      wrapped in bloodstained bedsheets and duct tape.  We can t 
      see the deceased s face just yet, but as Barbie lifts the 
      body, he notes that it s wearing only one shoe, a distinctive 
      BLUE SNEAKER.  

      Shit.  Frustrated, Barbie looks for the shoe s missing 
      partner, but it s not in the trunk.  Oh, well.  Clock s 
      ticking.  Carrying the corpse to its final resting spot, 
      Barbie unceremoniously DUMPS the body.

      As it hits the earth, the corpse s sheet becomes undone, 
      revealing the face of the deceased, a 40-something WHITE 
      MALE.  The body s lifeless eyes stare up at Barbie, who takes 
      this opportunity to say a few words:

                                  BARBIE
                    You had it coming.

      With that, Barbie picks up his shovel, and gets to work 
      refilling the hole.


      EXT. POLICE STATION - EARLY MORNING

      Sunrise is still an hour away as we cut to Chester Mill s 
        small-but-modern police department.


      INT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

      Inside, DEPUTY LINDA EVERETT (20s) turns on the lights in the 
      station s jail, which has a row of three small cells.  Only 
      one of them is occupied.  

                                  LINDA
                    Duke?  

      Inside an open cell, the local sheriff, DUKE PERKINS (50s), 
      is resting on one of the jail bunks with his hat pulled low 
      over his eyes.  He doesn t stir when Linda enters, just 
      responds calmly from beneath his brim.

                                  DUKE
                    Testing our accommodations.  

                                  LINDA
                    Right.  Uh, sorry to bother, but 
                    Sam Verdreaux called.            UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   3.


      Duke grunts.

                                  LINDA (CONT D)
                    Yeah, he sounded good and sauced, 
                    but he also wanted us to know he 
                    heard some kinda bang.

                                  DUKE
                          (still not moving)
                    A bang like a generator backfired 
                    or a bang like Tommy Anderson 
                    finally shot his wife?

                                  LINDA
                    Didn t specify.  Wasn t too sure 
                    about the when of it all either.  
                    He s the only one who called it in, 
                    so I didn t want to overreact...

      But now Duke sits up, and as he pushes back his hat, we can 
      see the sheriff s world-weary face for the first time.

                                  DUKE
                    Nah, you were right to get me, 
                    Linda. 

      The stoic man then straps on his old-school GUN BELT. 

                                  DUKE (CONT D)
                    You never know with this goddamn 
                    place.


      EXT. SWEETBRIAR ROSE - EARLY MORNING

      Across town, a lone customer is eating an early breakfast in 
      a local 24-hour diner. 


      INT. SWEETBRIAR ROSE - CONTINUOUS

      Inside, we find JAMES  BIG JIM  RENNIE (50s), an awesome 
      presence in every sense of the work.  He s reading a Tom 
      Clancy military thriller over his epic meal, as owner ROSE 
      TWITCHELL (40s) stops by to top off his coffee.

                                  ROSE
                    Anything else, Selectman Rennie?

                                  BIG JIM
                            (gregarious)
                    Spare me the formalities, Rose.  
                    I m off-duty for the weekend.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   4.


      Rose smiles, drops off the check.

                                  ROSE
                    You working the lot today?

                                  BIG JIM
                    Big sale on all our pre-owned 
                    stock.  Hoping we re a little 
                    busier than here, no offense.

      Rose looks at the empty tables with resignation.

                                  ROSE
                    First shift s been brutal ever 
                    since they opened up that Denny s 
                    over in Lewiston.  What the holy 
                    hell is a Moon Over My Hammy, 
                    anyway?

      Big Jim smiles, pays his tab.

                                  BIG JIM
                    Well, you hang in there.

      But as Jim heads out, Rose notices his payment, calls after 
      him.

                                  ROSE
                    Jim!

      She holds up the HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL he left for her.

                                  ROSE (CONT D)
                    What is this?

                                  BIG JIM
                    Me buying your next vote.

                                  ROSE
                          (calling bullshit)
                    Says the guy who always runs 
                      unopposed?

      Jim just gives her a knowing look.

                                  BIG JIM
                    We re all in this together.

      With that, the enigmatic selectman is out the door, headed 
      for the expensive black SUV parked out front.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   5.


      EXT. OLD HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

      Elsewhere, a PRIUS speeds towards an old house on top of a 
      small hill.  A local woman named ANDREA GRINELL is waiting on 
      her porch, expecting the incoming vehicle.

      The Prius comes to a stop, and out hops JULIA SHUMWAY (40), 
      an effortlessly attractive woman with a confident gait and an 
      expensive digital camera slung over her shoulder.

                                  JULIA
                    Andrea Grinell?

      The older woman nods.

                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                    Julia Shumway.  I got your message.  
                    You said you needed to speak with 
                    me?

                                  MRS. GRINELL
                    You re the newspaper woman?

                                  JULIA
                    I m the new editor of The 
                      Independent, yeah.  But if there s 
                    a problem with your delivery, you 
                    can just call--

                                  MRS. GRINELL
                    I get my news online, sweetheart.  
                    Like everybody else.  I called you 
                    because I ve got a tip.

      Julia looks more confused than intrigued.

                                  JULIA
                    About what?

                                  MRS. GRINELL
                    That.

      Mrs. Grinell gestures down at a nearby WAREHOUSE visible from 
      her hilltop vantage point.  Julia s not impressed.  

                                  JULIA
                      A nondescript building.  This is my 
                    Pulitzer for sure.

      Grinell glares at the younger woman.

                                  MRS. GRINELL
                    You re in from Philly or something?           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   6.


                                  JULIA
                    Chicago.  I used to work at the 
                    Trib.  My husband got a job at your 
                    med center, so I relocated with 
                    him.  Been looking for a change a 
                    pace anyway, you know?

                                  MRS. GRINELL
                    Well, you re about to get one.

      Suddenly, a large PROPANE TRUCK approaches the warehouse.

                                  MRS. GRINELL (CONT D)
                    See that truck down there?  That s 
                    the fourth delivery it s made to 
                    that building this week.  Last 
                    week, it made six.

      What?  Suddenly intrigued, Julia raises her camera.

                                  JULIA
                    Why does anybody need that much 
                    propane?  

                                  MRS. GRINELL
                    That was my question.  Either 
                      somebody s planning a hell of a 
                    barbecue or...

      Mrs. Grinell pantomimes a little EXPLOSION.  Julia is 
      horrified.

                                  JULIA
                    Jesus.  You think this might be 
                    related to terrorism?  
                          (then)
                    Mrs. Grinell, we have to tell the 
                    police.

                                  MRS. GRINELL
                    Already did.

      Confused, Julia squints at this woman.

                                  MRS. GRINELL (CONT D)
                    I called Sheriff Perkins three days 
                    ago.  He looked into it... and 
                    turns out everything s above board.  
                    Town Hall is just restocking its 
                       emergency reserves. 

      Julia lowers her camera.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   7.


                                  JULIA
                    I don t understand.

                                  MRS. GRINELL
                    Me neither.  Because here s the 
                    thing.  When he told me all this, 
                    Duke sounded nervous.  
                          (then)
                    I don t know how well you know that 
                    man, but believe me, he s never 
                    sounded nervous a day in his life.

      Not totally convinced, Julia snaps one more photo, mostly out 
      of politeness.  

                                  JULIA
                    Well.  I ll do some digging.

      Mrs. Grinell stands to walk back into her home.

                                  MRS. GRINELL
                    You do that.  But whatever you 
                    find... you leave my name the hell 
                    out of it.    

      And as Andrea Grinell steps back inside, Julia returns her 
      gaze to the warehouse in the distance.  She remains 
      skeptical, but her curiosity s definitely been piqued.      


      INT. APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

      Inside a modern studio apartment, an attractive young couple 
      is still in bed, passionately making love.  The woman on top 
      is ANGIE, and beneath her is an athletic college freshman who 
      everyone just calls JUNIOR.  

      As she finishes riding him, a satisfied Angie rolls off 
      Junior, who stares at her like she s a goddess.   

                                  JUNIOR
                    God.

                                  ANGIE
                    I know, right?

                                  JUNIOR
                    No, you don t.  Angie... I love 
                    you.

      Angie takes a moment.  She s not entirely comfortable with 
      this declaration.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   8.


                                  ANGIE
                    Yeah. 
                          (beat)
                    It s been a fun summer.

      That hits Junior like a gut punch.

                                  JUNIOR
                    Ouch.

      Angie climbs out of bed, pulls on her drab waitress uniform.

                                  ANGIE
                    Junior, we both knew this was just 
                    fun.  You re going back to school 
                    in a few days.

                                  JUNIOR
                    Not necessarily.

      Angie freezes.

                    No, listen to me.  We should have 
                    done this a long time ago.  I have 
                    loved you since third grade, all

                    Yeah.
                          (then; softer)
                    That s why I can t be with you.

      Junior darkens.

                                  JUNIOR
                    What did you say?

                                  ANGIE
                    Whatever, I m gonna be late.

                                  JUNIOR
                    Why are you acting like this?

      Angie starts to leave, but Junior GRABS her wrist.

                                  JUNIOR (CONT D)
                    Talk to me!

      Flinching in pain, Angie hauls off and SLAPS Junior as hard 
      as she can.  She stares at her old friend in disbelief.

                                  ANGIE
                    You can let yourself out.  And take 
                    your stupid electric toothbrush 
                    with you.

                    Angie, wait!

      Junior yells after her, but Angie is already gone, leaving 
      the crushed young man alone with his thoughts.


      EXT. FOREST CLEARING - SUNRISE

      As dawn begins to break, Barbie finishes scattering leaves 
      and branches over his makeshift grave, doing a pretty decent 
      job of covering his tracks.    

      He stuffs the shovel next to the only other object in his 
      small trunk, a military-style DUFFEL BAG.  Grabbing a fresh 
      shirt from his car s back seat, Barbie puts on sunglasses to 
      try to cover the CUT above his eye.

      Jumping behind the wheel of his shitty car, he inches out of 
      the forest and down an empty dirt road, eventually GUNNING IT 
      out onto one of the Mill s main thoroughfares.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   10.


      INT. BARBIE S CAR - CONTINUOUS

      Barbie absentmindedly flicks on the radio, which comes to 
      life with the voice of local disc jockey PHIL BUSHEY:

                                  PHIL (FROM RADIO)
                    --with you all weekend long at 
                    WKIC, your only locally owned 
                    emporium of rock and--

      And just as quickly, Barbie flicks the radio off.  He rides 
      in silence for a bit, only to be startled by the sound of his 
      ringing CELL PHONE.  Barbie picks up, though we can only hear 
      his side of the conversation:

                                  BARBIE
                    Hey.  No, I m fine.  Look, don t 
                    freak out, but the deal went 
                    south...  No, your seller showed, 
                    he just turned out to be a colossal 
                    asshole.  I brought the money to 
                    his place like you said, but he 
                    tried to renegotiate, aggressively.
                          (beat)
                    Well, what do you think I did?

      Suddenly, Barbie notices another car traveling down this 
      road, headed his way on the opposite lane and moving at a 
      good clip.  It s still far away, but Barbie can already make 
      out the red and blue LIGHTS mounted on the vehicle s roof.  

                                  BARBIE (CONT D)
                    Eloise... I m gonna have to call 
                    you back.

      Slapping his cell shut, Barbie reaches for the glove 
        compartment, pops it open.  Inside is a HANDGUN.


      INT. POLICE CAR - CONTINUOUS

      Duke is behind the wheel of this approaching squad car, with 
      Deputy Linda Everett in shotgun.  

                                  LINDA
                    I m just saying, if they were both 
                    in their primes, Tyson would 
                    destroy Ali.

                                  DUKE
                    You re out of your mind.  Ali could 
                    take Tyson today.              UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   11.


                                  LINDA
                    Whatever.  Rusty used to box and he 
                    agrees a hundred percent.

                                  DUKE
                    Another reason you never should 
                    have said yes to a meathead 
                    fireman.  

      Linda smiles, looks down at her ENGAGEMENT RING with pride.

                                  LINDA
                    They prefer meathead firefighters, 
                    thank you very much.  And their 
                    insurance plan blows ours to shit.

      That s when Duke spots Barbie s car headed their way.

                                  DUKE
                    Incoming.  No front tag.

                                  LINDA
                      Definitely not local.  Little early 
                    for the tourist crowd.  You want me 
                    to pop the lights?

                                  DUKE
                    Let s do our homework before we 
                    start harassing Sunday drivers.

      Linda picks up their dashboard s two-way radio.


      INT. BARBIE S CAR - CONTINUOUS

      Barbie, meanwhile, keeps his eyes dead ahead as the police 
      cruiser closes in... and eventually blows right past him.  

      Is he in the clear?


      INT. POLICE CAR - CONTINUOUS

      As Duke keeps driving, Linda cranes her head back to read 
      Barbie s rear plate to a dispatcher.

                                  LINDA
                    This is 102.  You on, Jackie?

                    Do us a favor and run an Ohio 
                    plate?  Boy Adam Boy, One Six Two.  


      INT. BARBIE S CAR - CONTINUOUS

      Barbie keeps his eyes on the rearview, fully expecting the 
      police car to SKID AROUND and start pursuing him... but it 
      just keeps going. 

      He EXHALES for the first time in almost a mile.  But the 
      second Barbie takes his eyes off the rearview, he finally 
      notices what s directly in his path: a COW that has wandered 
      into the middle of the road.

                                  BARBIE
                    SHIT!

      Barbie jinks the steering wheel hard, narrowly dodging this 
      cow.  Careening into a nearby pasture, the car speeds towards 
      the rest of this animal s HERD.


      EXT. ROUTE 119 - CONTINUOUS

      The lazy cows barely attempt to get out of the way as 
      Barbie s car narrowly misses them.  Finally, the vehicle 
      comes to a stop, one of its front tires blown to hell.  

      Jumping out of the vehicle to inspect the damage, Barbie then 
      rushes to his compact car s small trunk, only to realize that 
      he REMOVED the spare tire to make room for the body, shovel, 
      duffel bag, etc.  

                                  BARBIE
                          (darkly)
                    Perfect.   

      And just when Barbie is sure things couldn t get worse, the 
      ground begins to TREMBLE.


      CHESTER S MILL - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - CONTINUOUS

      CUT AROUND TOWN as the locals experience this surreal jolt:

      *Now in her newspaper s modest bullpen, Julia notices her 
      coffee cup begin to RATTLE.
 
      *Sitting at a desk adorned with a bust of his hero Winston 
      Churchill, Big Jim is plunged into blackness when the LIGHTS 
      GO OUT inside his car lot offices.             UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   13.


      *Though they re now walking on opposite sides of town, Angie 
      and Junior both feel the earth MOVE under their feet.

      *Finally, Duke GRABS HIS CHEST, slamming on the brakes of his 
      police car as he winces in extreme pain.  


      EXT. ROUTE 119 - CONTINUOUS

      Back at his car, Barbie is still reeling from this shaking 
      when he hears a TERRIBLE NOISE coming from the pasture.

      He turns to see a COW just as its body is SPLIT IN HALF 
      LENGTHWISE.  The half closest to Barbie slumps to the grass, 
      but the other somehow REMAINS UPRIGHT, giving us a Damien 
      Hirst-style cutaway view of the animal s still-pumping 
      innards.  

                                  BARBIE
                    ...the fuck?


      EXT. PASTURE - CONTINUOUS

      Running to inspect the bisected cow, Barbie kneels down in a 
      puddle of the beast s blood.  He reaches out to touch the 
      spot where... something split this animal in two, and Barbie 
      is SHOCKED -- figuratively and literally -- when he connects 
      with an INVISIBLE BARRIER.  

      He yanks his palm back, but his bloodstained HANDPRINT is 
      still there, glistening in midair, like a warning.  


      INT. POLICE CAR - CONTINUOUS

      Back in the halted police cruiser, Linda is understandably 
      concerned about her boss.

                    Jesus, Duke.  Are you...?

      But Duke catches his breath, waves her off.

                                  DUKE
                    I m fine.  Just my damn pacemaker 
                    skipping a beat.

                                  LINDA
                    And that s supposed to make me feel 
                    better?!

      Duke tries to answer, but Linda grabs the radio from him.

                                  LINDA
                    Forget the tag, we got a bigger 
                    problem.

                                  FROM RADIO

                    What...?

      Before the dispatcher can respond, TWO DIFFERENT MALE VOICES 
      broadcast over competing frequencies.  Annoyed, Duke snatches 
      the radio back from Linda.

                                  DUKE
                    One at a time, geniuses.  Freddy, 
                    you first.

                                  FROM RADIO
                    Sorry, Duke.  We got a downed power 
                    line over by the health center.  

                                  DUKE
                    George?

                                  FROM RADIO
                    Yep, same story at the Food City.  
                    Sparks and everything!  

      Linda looks at Duke with concern.

                                  LINDA
                    Those are on either side of town.  
                    What could even do that?  A 
                      twister...?

      But when Duke looks out his window, all he sees in the bright 
      clear sky is a single SMALL PLANE flying high above them.

      Inside its cockpit, a middle-aged woman named CLAUDETTE is 
      getting flying lessons from her tanned instructor CHUCK.

                                  CLAUDETTE

      Claudette flashes her teacher a mischievous smile.

                                  CLAUDETTE
                    I just wanted to say, thanks again.

                    Well, I m glad to help.  We just 
                    have to be careful.  

      But Claudette lets go of her tandem controls, starts moving 
      closer to Chuck.

                    Screw careful.

      Her head disappears into Chuck s lap, as he looks out at the 
      cloudless sky with contentment.

                                  CHUCK
                          (to himself)

      EXT. PASTURE - CONTINUOUS

      Back at the halved cow, Barbie is still struggling to wrap 
      his brain around what just happened, when someone calls out:

                                    ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)
                    What the hell, man?

      Barbie spins around to see JOE McCLATCHEY, a lanky teenager 
      who s looking down at the cow with horror.  

                                  JOE
                    What the hell did you do?

      Giving this groggy kid the once-over, Barbie notes the 
      crudely hand-rolled JOINT in Joe s hand.

      But a stoned Joe has already pushed past Barbie to inspect 
      the bloody handprint, which still appears to be FLOATING in 
      place.  The teenager s jaw goes slack as he touches the 
      barrier for himself.

                                  JOE

      his feet.  The fallen objects are black and limp. 

      Joe reaches down to pick one up.  It s a CROW, its neck 
      SNAPPED by some unexpected impact high above.

                                  JOE (CONT D)
                    Wait, what?

      That s when Barbie hears something.  It s our TWIN-ENGINE 
      PLANE, only the aircraft is now about to fly directly OVER 
      Barbie and Joe.

      Barbie looks down at the birds, then up at the rapidly 
      incoming plane.  Doing the awful arithmetic in his head, he 
      looks to Joe and says one word:

                                  BARBIE
                    RUN.

      But it s too late.  The airplane EXPLODES directly above them 
      as it CRUMPLES against the towering invisible barrier.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   17.


      Frozen in terror, Joe stares up at the incoming FLAMING 
      WRECKAGE.

      And just as a shorn wing is about to flatten the boy -- 
      Barbie TACKLES Joe, just barely knocking him out of the way.

      Debris continues to RAIN DOWN all around them.  Joe screams 
      with horror as a MAN S LEG lands inches from his face.  
      Dressed in denim, the leg s side-seam has been blown wide 
      open, revealing white flesh and wiry hair.  

                                  JOE
                          (in shock)
                    What the hell is happening?!

      But an equally shaken Barbie has no idea how to respond.


      EXT. BIG JIM S USED CAR LOT - DAY

      Back in town, Jim Rennie steps out of his office and onto a 
      car lot decorated with banners declaring  BIG JIM S BIGGEST 
      DEALS OF THE YEAR!  

      He s just noticed a CROWD OF ONLOOKERS staring at something 
      in the sky.

                                  BIG JIM
                    God Almighty.

      It s the distant IMPACT POINT of the small plane, now a 
      smoldering smudge that appears suspended high in the sky.  
      Big Jim grabs one of the stunned ONLOOKERS.

                                  BIG JIM (CONT D)
                    What are we looking at?  

                                  ONLOOKER
                    No clue.  But somebody said they 
                    saw a piper cub explode in midair.

                                  BIG JIM
                      Explode...?

                                  ONLOOKER
                    Yeah, they don t know if it got 
                    shot down or what.

                                  BIG JIM
                    A plane crash?
                          (then; almost HOPEFUL)
                    Here?           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   18.


      The onlooker is still transfixed by the smudge, which is 
      slowly fading away like a spent firework.

                                  ONLOOKER
                    What is it?

      But Big Jim is already racing for his vehicle.  This is the 
      moment he s been waiting for.  Preparing for. 


      EXT. CRASH SITE - DAY

      SMALL FIRES now dot the area where Barbie is still recovering 
      with Joe McClatchey.  They re standing on the outskirts of 
      the crash site, trying to process what just happened.

                                  JOE
                    Those people are dead.  I... I saw 
                    those people die.

      With a trembling hand, Barbie takes out a pack of cigarettes, 
      lights a smoke.

                                  BARBIE
                    You know where to score E?

                                  JOE
                    What?

                                  BARBIE
                    You obviously know where to get 
                    weed in this town, you know anyone 
                    with ecstasy?

      Joe reluctantly nods, wondering what the hell kind of grown-
      up this guy is.

                                  BARBIE (CONT D)
                          (knowingly)
                    Trust me, it ll help when the 
                    dreams start.

                                  JOE
                    Um, look, we need to tell somebody, 
                    right?  About this?

      Snapping back to reality, Barbie nods.  But when he flips 
      open his cell phone, he doesn t like what he sees.

                                  BARBIE
                    You getting service?

      Joe takes out his iPhone, frowns at the screen.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   19.


                                  JOE
                    Uh-uh.

      Barbie is considering what this might mean when he notices 
      another vehicle charging their way, this time from the OTHER 
      side of the barrier.  It s a FIRE TRUCK, loaded with half the 
      department, responding to the crash.  Like the pilot before 
      him, the truck s DRIVER has no clue about the invisible BRICK 
      WALL waiting in his path.  

                                  BARBIE
                    No.

      Abandoning his cigarette, Barbie runs full speed as he waves 
      his arms and screams:

                                  BARBIE (CONT D)
                    IDIOT!  SLOW DOWN!

      But the fire truck is still thundering towards the scene of 
      the crash, the driver obviously not hearing Barbie.

      Left with no other choice, Barbie races to the MIDDLE OF THE 
      ROAD, directly in the truck s path.  Joe can barely watch.  
      If it smashes through the barrier, Barbie is DEAD.

      But at the last second, the man behind the wheel SLAMS ON HIS 
      BRAKES, stopping inches short of annihilation.  Strangely, 
      Barbie can t hear wailing sirens or screeching tires.  The 
      fire truck stops with almost surreal SILENCE.  Apparently, 
      the barrier prevents even SOUND from getting inside.  

      Wondering why the hell some idiot is standing in traffic, an 
      older FIRE CHIEF climbs out of the cab and charges at Barbie.   

                                  BARBIE (CONT D)
                    Hold up!  You re gonna hit the--  

      And though Barbie tries to warn this man, the fire chief 
      STRIKES the transparent barrier face-first, knocking the 
      helmet right off his stunned face.  

      Joe rejoins Barbie, who takes a little ADDRESS BOOK from his 
      back pocket.  He rips out a page and starts scrawling a note 
      to the flummoxed fire chief.

                                  JOE
                    What are you writing?

                                  BARBIE
                    I m telling them to call the F.A.A.  
                      Somebody s got to shut down this 
                    entire airspace.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   20.


      Barbie SLAPS the note against the barrier.  The fire chief 
      reads it with bewilderment before finally reaching for his 
      own wireless radio.  A conspiracy-minded Joe looks worried:  

                                  JOE
                    The feds?  But, what if the 
                      government built this thing?

                                  BARBIE
                    They didn t.

                                  JOE
                    How do you know?

      Barbie stares at the black smoke, which is now climbing the 
      inside of the transparent impenetrable wall.

                                  BARBIE
                     Cause it works.


      EXT. RADIO STATION - DAY

      The call letters  WKIC  light up as generators hum to life 
      beneath Chester Mill s only 50,000-watt radio tower.


      INT. RADIO STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

      Inside a dimly lit little studio, we meet the voice behind 
      the local DJ Barbie heard earlier, eccentric indy rock 
      devotee PHIL BUSHEY (30s).  He grabs a microphone as his 
      console again powers up.

                                  PHIL
                    Apologies for the technical 
                      difficulties and difficult 
                      technicalities, but we are back on 
                    your airwaves, rocking another 
                      scrumptious playlist home-cooked by 
                    your old friend Phil, not ladled 
                    out by some corporate stooge.  Eat 
                    up, my lovelies...  

      He hits a switch, and the studio fills with the sound of LED 
      Soundsystem s  North American Scum.   

                                    ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)
                    Phil!

      The studio door is flung open by Phil s only colleague, 
      hipster radio engineer DODEE WHEELER (20).             UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   21.


                                  PHIL
                    Dodee, hey.  Have you heard this 
                    new--

                                  DODEE
                          (ignoring him)
                    We re the only thing on the air 
                    right now.  AM, FM, anywhere.

                                  PHIL
                    Yeah, the blackout, I know.  

                                  DODEE
                    No, listen, even if that were 
                      statewide, every station our size 
                    has its own generator.  Why is the 
                    whole dial still static?

      Phil gives this serious consideration.  

                                  PHIL
                    I don t know... but our ratings are 
                    going to be amazing.

      And as he cranks his hand-picked music, CUT TO:


      EXT. CRASH SITE - DAY

      Back at the pasture, the same police cruiser that earlier 
      blew past Barbie now skids to a halt, as Duke and Deputy 
      Linda Everett hop out to survey the smoldering wreckage.

                                    ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)
                    Sheriff Perkins!

      Duke turns to see Joe coming towards them with Barbie, who 
      eyes the police officers with trepidation.

                                  JOE
                            (mile-a-minute)
                    Sheriff Perkins I almost got killed 
                    by a plane but then this guy saved 
                    me and I think there s maybe a--

                                  DUKE
                    Joe, clear on out of here.  We ll 
                    get a statement from you later.

                  SCARECROW JOEDUKE
      But--Now, son.

      Joe looks back at Barbie, who gives him a little nod.   Go 
      on, I ll be fine.   The teenager complies.             UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   22.


      Linda, meanwhile, has just spotted her ruggedly handsome 
      fianc , RUSTY, who s standing with his fellow firefighters 
      just outside the barrier.

                                  LINDA
                    RUSTY! 

      She calls out to him, but the young man doesn t even look her 
      way.  He and the other firefighters are all staring up at 
      something with confused disbelief.

                                  BARBIE
                    I don t think he can hear you.

                                  LINDA
                    The hell are you talking about?
                    Why s everybody just standing 
                    around?

                                  DUKE (O.S.)
                    Jesus God.

      And now Linda turns to look at Duke, who s finally noticed 
      what the firefighters are looking up at: shimmering AIRPLANE 
      FUEL still dripping down from the sky, which makes a portion 
      of this barrier SEMI-VISIBLE.  

                                  DUKE (CONT D)
                    What...?

                                  BARBIE
                    I don t know.  
                          (then; matter of fact)
                    But it s big.  

      Reaching out to touch the transparent wall for herself, Linda 
      is startled by a strange TINGLING sensation in her fingers.

                                  LINDA
                    Whoa.

      On the other side of the barrier, Rusty has finally noticed 
      his bride-to-be.  He charges to greet her, and though he 
      feels the same initial SHOCK when his fingers hit the 
      invisible wall, Rusty nevertheless keeps his palm pressed 
      flush against Linda s.  Though separated by less than a 
      millimeter, the couple might as well be on different 
      continents now. 

                                  LINDA (CONT D)
                    Baby!  Baby, you all right?

      Rusty gives a breathless response, but Linda can only watch 
      his lips move in silence.             UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   23.


      Before we can decipher what s being said, a concerned fire 
      chief starts yelling at Rusty.  The fire chief starts to DRAG 
      his subordinate away from the potentially dangerous barrier.  
      Clocking this, Duke does this same with his deputy.

                                  DUKE
                    Linda, get away from that thing!

                                  LINDA
                    It s like... some kind of force 
                    field.

                                  DUKE
                    Yeah, I get that. I don t know what 
                    it means, but I get it.
                          (then; re: the fires)
                    The hell are the rest of our 
                    pumpers, anyway?

                    For the parade.

                          (shaking his head)
                    Goddamn Big Jim...

      As if on cue, a familiar SUV roars into the scene.  Big Jim 
      hops out, takes in the debris field with astonishment.  

                                  BIG JIM 
                    This was Chuck Thomson s plane.  Is 
                    he...?

                                  BARBIE
                    For what it s worth, he died the 
                    second he hit it.

      Big Jim squints at this outsider.

                                  BIG JIM
                    Hit what?  

      Before anyone can respond, the radio in Duke s police car 
      SQUAWKS to life with the voice of one of the male officers.  

                                  FROM RADIO
                    Duke, you there?

      Duke reaches into his car, keys the handheld mic.

                                  FROM RADIO
                    Sir, we got a real bad accident on

                    the thing s flat as a dime. 
                          (then; somberly)
                    Whole family is D.O.A.  

      Big Jim is aghast.

                                  BIG JIM
                    Dead?  Did he say they re dead?

      Linda looks at where Rusty s fire truck was forced to stop.

                                  LINDA
                    The roads.  Whoever did this, they 
                    cut off all our roads.

      But Duke shakes his head as he notices the subtly curved LINE 
      OF DESTRUCTION stretching far beyond this crash site, downing 
      power lines and slicing trees in half.  

                                  DUKE
                    It s not just the roads, it s 
                      everything. The whole town.  

      Barbie doesn t like it, but he s pretty sure Duke is right.

                                  BARBIE
                          (simply)
                    We re trapped.

      On the other side of the barrier, Rusty breaks free from the 
      other firefighters long enough to race back the force field.  
      Shouting at his fianc e, he begins POUNDING on the invisible 
      wall in frustration.  A heartbroken Linda can only watch this 
      with growing dread.

                                  LINDA
                    But, whatever this is, the folks 
                    out there will be able to... 
                    airlift us all out or something,

      Duke honestly doesn t know.

                                  DUKE
                    Right now, let s just worry about 
                    the folks in here.

      And off Barbie s increasingly troubled expression, CUT TO:


      EXT. MILL GAS & GROCERY - DAY

      Elsewhere in the Mill, a RENTAL CAR has stopped to refuel.  

      Three women get out to stretch their legs, life partners 
      ALICE CALVERT and CAROLYN HILL (40s), and their rebellious 
      teenage daughter NORRIE.  She sarcastically reads aloud from 
        a guidebook. 

                                  NORRIE
                     The town of Chester s Mill is 
                    legendary for its fried clams, 
                    always whole, never in strips. 
                          (then)
                    Horrific.  Seriously, can we please 
                    stop somewhere else?  There s no 
                    way I m eating my last meal here.

      Her mother Carolyn doesn t even look up from her Blackberry, 
      which she s frantically thumbing.

                                    CAROLYN
                    We re taking you to camp, not your 
                      execution. 
                          (then; to her Blackberry)
                    How the hell am I still getting no 
                    bars?

                                  NORRIE
                    Waterside isn t a  camp,  it s a 
                    glorified prison for screw-ups with 
                    rich parents.  

                                  ALICE
                    It s a wonderful program, Norrie.  
                    And as soon as they say you re 
                    ready, you can come right back 
                    home.

                                  NORRIE
                    To Los Angeles?  Is that supposed 
                    to be incentive?  I despise--

      Before this squabble can get out of hand, two local POLICE 
      CARS come screaming past the Gas & Grocery.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   26.


                                  NORRIE (CONT D)
                    Holy shit.

      But Alice looks genuinely concerned about all those sirens.

                                  ALICE
                    Actually, maybe Norrie was right 
                    about stopping somewhere else.  We 
                    can always do lunch when we get to 
                    Bangor, yeah?

      Norrie nods with quiet appreciation, and the women soon SPEED 
      OFF, unaware of the death sentence waiting in their path.


      EXT. CRASH SITE - DAY

      A large paper MAP OF CHESTER S MILL is unfolded across the 
      hood of our SUV. Big Jim, Duke and Linda are inspecting every 
      inch, while Barbie hangs back, trying to remain on the 
      sidelines.

                                  BIG JIM
                    There are twenty-four roads in and 
                    out of Chester s Mill.

                                  LINDA
                    Not counting dirt ones.

                                  DUKE
                    My guys are already setting up 
                      roadblocks, but it ll take hours to 
                    button up the whole town.

                                  BIG JIM
                    Do what you can, I ve got a 
                      contingency plan for the...

      Big Jim hears a WHIRRING, and he looks up just as Julia 
      Shumway s Prius zooms into the crash site.  Duke and Big Jim 
      exchange UNCOMFORTABLE GLANCES the second they see her.

      Julia is out of her car in a flash, snapping photos with her 
      Nikon.  Barbie subtly shields his face, not wanting to end up 
      on any front pages, while an incensed Big Jim races over to 
      put his hand over her lens.

                                  BIG JIM (CONT D)
                    No cameras!  This is a national

                                  JULIA
                    You touch me, I will sue you out of 
                      existence.

                                  BIG JIM
                    I am a duly elected selectman and 
                    I m ordering you to leave.

                                  JULIA
                    I don t give a shit if you re an 
                    alderman or an emperor, you can t 
                    just--

                    Enough!  We don t have time for 
                    this. 

      Realizing he s right, Big Jim runs for his SUV while Duke 
      hops behind the wheel of his squad car.

                                  JULIA
                    Now you re all leaving?  

      Ignoring her, Duke calls out to his deputy.

                                  DUKE
                    Linda, commandeer Ms. Shumway s 
                    vehicle.  We ll cover more ground 
                    in two cars.

                                  JULIA
                    What the hell is happening?

      But Linda s already behind the wheel of Julia s idling Prius.

                                  DUKE
                    You want to help, get some medical 
                    attention for our guest.  

      And as the vehicles all PEEL OUT, Julia turns to Barbie, 
      noticing the handsome stranger for the first time.

                                  BARBIE
                    Um, thanks, but really, I m fine.

      A forward Julia gets right in Barbie s face, inspects the 
      gash above his eye. 

                                  JULIA
                    Bullshit.  You ve got a head wound 
                    and you re probably in shock.  Come 
                    on, their hospital isn t far.  You 
                    can tell me what the hell that was

                    on the house.  I m Julia, by the 
                    way.  Who the hell are you?

      Realizing this persistent woman will never settle for  no 
      comment,  Barbie reluctantly reveals his name.

                                  BARBIE

                    Yeah.  I know. 

                                  JULIA
                    And how do you fit into all this?

      up dust as it speeds down an unpaved road. 


      INT. RENTAL CAR - CONTINUOUS

      Inside, Alice is behind the wheel, her wife Carolyn is in 
      shotgun, and Norrie is between them in back, listening to her 
      iPod loud enough that we can overhear the atonal Skrillex 
      song through her headphones.

                    Fine, we can listen to music 
                    together.

      sneaking her other earbud back in as an indy rock song comes 
      over the car s speakers.


      INT. RADIO STATION - DAY

      Cut to this song s source, where DJ Phil Bushey is watching 
      his engineer Dodee fiddle with a television in their break 
      room.  She s just getting the old  blue screen of death. 

                                  DODEE

                    of warrant--

      WHAM.  An impatient Big Jim kicks the door open.  Phil tries 
      to stand in his way, but Big Jim LOOMS over the smaller man.

      to their broadcasting room.


      INT. JUNIOR S BEDROOM - DAY

      Across town, WKIC is playing on a battery-operated radio in 
      Junior s childhood bedroom, still decorated with high school 
      football trophies and other ephemera from the popular local 
      kid s past.

      Junior is sitting on the edge of his bed, carefully balancing 
      a HUNTING KNIFE by its sharp tip on his extended finger.  He 
      flips the knife into the air, catches it by the handle.  

      For a beat, Junior just stares at his reflection in the 
      polished blade.  With frightening calmness, he then holds the 
      blade directly over his left wrist.  He contemplates ripping 
      into his own flesh, starts pressing the knife against a 
      raised blue vein...

      That s when the song is interrupted by an urgent voice:

                                  FROM RADIO
                    Everyone, please stop what you re 
                    doing and listen.

      And in the parking lot of the Holy Redeemer Church, a DRIVER 
      has turned up the radio in his pick-up truck for the rest of 
      the PARISHIONERS now exiting morning service.

                    random boys.

                    For the millionth time, I was 
                    wearing underwear.  And it was a 
                    joke!      

      Ignoring them, Alice turns up the radio.

                    Once again, every car that can hear 
                    my voice needs to pull over 
                      immediately.  This is not a drill.

                    I can t tell you if this is an act 
                    of terror or an... an Act of God, 
                    but I promise to keep everyone 
                    updated as we learn more.

                                  NORRIE
                    It s just some stupid viral 
                    marketing thing, mom. 

                                  ALICE
                    I don t know...

      Carolyn has just noticed another vehicle headed their way, a 
      DELIVERY TRUCK about to make a stop in Chester s Mill.

                                    CAROLYN
                    She s right, Alice.  There are 
                    other people on the road.  This is 
                    probably just some stunt to keep 
                    tourists in town a little--

      Before she can finish that thought, the incoming delivery 
      truck SMASHES against the invisible barrier s exterior.  The 
      ensuing blast COATS the outside of the barrier in a fiery 
      collage of foodstuffs.  

      Seeing this, Alice SLAMS on the brakes, and the rental car 
      stops just inches from the inside of the invisible wall.  The 
      tourists are now TRAPPED... but at least they re alive.


      EXT. RENTAL CAR - CONTINUOUS

      The understandably shaken women get out of their stopped car 
      to inspect this impossible tableau.

                                  ALICE
                    Is everyone all right?

                    What is this?  What... what are we 
                    seeing here?

      And as if things couldn t get any worse, Norrie s body 
      suddenly begins to TREMBLE.

                                  ALICE
                    Norrie?

      The girl COLLAPSES, and her parents both race to her side.

      Norrie is convulsing on the ground, but it doesn t appear to 
      be an ordinary seizure.  She stares up at us with eyes WIDE 
      OPEN, as she repeats a seemingly nonsensical phrase:

      EXT. FIELD - DAY

      On the other side of town, Julia is leading Barbie across an 
      open field on their way to the hospital.  As she walks, an 
      overwhelmed Julia runs her fingers along the unending 
      barrier, looking in vain for gaps.

                                  JULIA
                    Christ, what is it?

                                  BARBIE
                    No idea.  Some kind of... 
                      experiment, maybe.

                                  JULIA
                    And what, we re the guinea pigs?  
                    What the hell would anyone have to 
                    learn from Chester s Mill?

                                  BARBIE
                    You tell me.

                                  JULIA
                    Please, I m a transplant, not a 
                    local.  This gig was supposed to be 
                      temporary.

      Julia looks at the seemingly endless barrier with concern.

                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                    It is temporary, isn t it?  I mean, 
                    if this thing appeared out of thin 
                    air, maybe it ll disappear, too.

                                  BARBIE
                          (doubting it)
                    Maybe.

                                  JULIA
                    You think we might be stuck in here

      Barbie nods.

                    Even if what s wrong suddenly 
                    becomes right, the Army s apt to 
                      quarantine the whole town, at least 
                    for a while.

                                  JULIA
                    What makes you say that?
                          (then; working it out)
                    You re military, aren t you?

      Barbie gives Julia a flirtatious smile.  The lady s sharp.

      He nods.  Right again.

                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                    What d you do over there?

      Weighing how to answer, Barbie stares off at nothing in 
      particular.

                                  BARBIE
                    You know.

                    Shot a lot of hoops.

      And just when Julia is about to call him on this dodge...

                    ...help me...

      ...she and Barbie turn to see a BLOODSTAINED WOMAN shambling 
      their way.  She s used her own belt as a makeshift 
      TOURNIQUET, but her right forearm is still bleeding from 
      where her hand was SEVERED when the barrier came down.  

                                  WOMAN
                          (meekly)
                    I think I had an accident.

      With that, she COLLAPSES to the grass.

                    Jesus!

      How...?She must have been reaching 
                                                  across when... whatever.

      Barbie checks for a pulse.

                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                    But she s gonna be okay, right?
                          (beat)
                    We can still help her, right?

      Barbie just looks up at Julia, and his expression says 
      everything.  


      INT. MCCLATCHEY HOUSE - DAY

      Having run the whole way home, teenager Joe McClatchey bursts 
      into the foyer of his family s modest house.

                                  JOE
                    Mom?  Mom!

                    Joe?  

      Startled, Joe turns to see ANGIE, still dressed in her 
      waitress uniform.  She looks as freaked out as the young man 
      we now realize is her younger brother.

                                  JOE
                    Ange.  Where the hell is mom?

                    I don t know, you re the one who 
                    lives here.  Where s dad?

                                  JOE
                    Still on the road.

                                  ANGIE
                    You re sure?  A customer at the 
                    diner said there might have been 
                    some kind of chemical spill.  I was 
                    worried maybe it was dad s rig or--

                    Chemical spill?  Retard, it s nine-
                    eleven outside!

      looking for signs of his mother s whereabouts.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   36.

                    I... I should get to the hospital.

                    Jesus.

      Angie looks over at her brother, who s just found a NOTE left 
      on a nearby table.

                                  ANGIE
                    Joe?  What is it?

                                  JOE
                    Note from mom.  She s having brunch 
                    with Uncle Steve.  At Denny s.  

                                  ANGIE
                    So...?

      Joe processes this, not yet sure whether to be depressed or 
      excited about his future.

                                  JOE
                    I m on my own.

      And off Angie, wondering what the hell she s missed, CUT TO:


      INT. CHESTER S MILL HEALTH CENTER - AFTERNOON

      It s bedlam inside the local hospital, where a handful of 
      NURSES and VOLUNTEERS struggle to triage the incoming wave of 
      CASUALTIES.  In the crowded waiting room, a young nurse is 
      trying to bandage an older man s head.

                    I just don t get it.  What did my 
                    tractor even hit?

      The waiting room s front doors whoosh open to reveal Julia 
      and Barbie.  The patients fall silent as they see that this 
      duo is carrying the CORPSE of the handless woman.

                                  JULIA

                    I, I think her name s Myra.  From 
                    the library.  Is she...?  

      Barbie nods, as two EMTs reverently take the woman s still-
      warm body.  Meanwhile, a male orderly rushes over to greet 
      Julia.  He looks relieved to see her.

                                    ORDERLY
                    Mrs. Shumway, thank God.  Is the

                    thought he was here.  Peter always 
                    works Sundays.

      The orderly grows uncomfortable, not sure how to respond. 

                                    ORDERLY
                    Ma am, your husband hasn t worked 
                    weekends in months.

      Julia goes white.  Whatever this means, it can t be good.  
      Still, Barbie puts a reassuring hand on her shoulder.

                                  BARBIE
                    Probably just a miscommunication.  
                    I m sure he s home, worried sick 
                    about you.

      Julia nods, but she doesn t look too convinced.


      EXT. PRETTY VALLEY ROAD - AFTERNOON

      Later that day, Deputy Linda Everett has diagonally parked 
      her commandeered Prius at a makeshift roadblock close to the 
      edge of the barrier.  She s looking out beyond it here.

      of CABLE NEWS REPORTERS who have just started to arrive on

      Linda, but she can t hear through the soundproof divide.

                    Finally.

      But as this caravan comes to a halt, dozens of soldiers 
      wearing LEVEL A HAZMAT SUITS leap out.  First, they corral 
      the angry reporters, then the soldiers begin establishing a 
      fifty yard PERIMETER around Chester s Mill.  Starting to grow 
      concerned, Linda waves her arms, trying to get their 
      attention.

                    Hey!  You got people trapped in 
                    here!  

      One of the soldiers looks right at Linda, only to then TURN 
      HIS BACK on her.  The hell?  

      Off the troubled deputy, starting to wonder whether she s 
      ever going to see her fianc  again, CUT TO:


      EXT. TOWN HALL - AFTERNOON

      Outside a surprisingly modern Town Hall, Duke s squad car is 
      parked next to Big Jim s SUV.  A gasoline GENERATOR is now 
      loudly powering the building s electricity.


      INT. TOWN HALL - CONTINUOUS

      Inside Town Hall s spacious lobby, Big Jim walks out of his 
      office to greet the sheriff.

      downplay it.

                      emergencies, selectmen have the 
                    power to authorize auxiliary 
                    deputies.

      But Duke is already shaking his head.

                                  DUKE
                    Look, I know you just want to help, 
                    but I m the head law enforcement 
                    officer here, and you have zero 
                    official standing.  At all.  Until 
                    we hear otherwise from the county 
                    or above, you re not authorizing 
                    anything, understood?

      Frustrated, Jim pushes his anger down someplace deep.

                                  BIG JIM
                      Understood.

      Duke gives a shallow tip of his hat before turning to leave, 
      when Jim calls out after him.

                                  BIG JIM (CONT D)
                    One other thing.  What should we do 
                    if people start asking about the 
                    propane?  

      Duke stops in his tracks.  He turns back to glare at Jim.

                                  DUKE
                    That s got nothing to do with this.

                                  BIG JIM
                    Oh, I know that.  But some people 
                    might find it hard to swallow that 
                    we just happened to start 
                      stockpiling generator fuel right 
                    before some Act of God took out all 
                    the power.  Some people might get 
                    the idea that we saw this coming.  

                                  DUKE
                    We didn t.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   40.


                                  BIG JIM
                    So we tell them the truth?  

                                  DUKE
                    That s your business.  I have no 
                    idea what the hell you wanted with 
                    all that shit.

                                  BIG JIM
                    Please.  You may have been happy to 
                    turn a blind eye, but you re not 
                    dumb.  You know exactly where that 
                    poison was headed.

      Incensed, Duke gets right in Jim s face.

                                  DUKE
                    I know I did what I had to do to 
                    keep this town solvent.  To keep it 
                    safe.

                                  BIG JIM
                    Of course.  And I ll do my best to 
                    protect your secret.

                                  DUKE
                    Are you threatening me?  You?  

                                  BIG JIM
                    Not at all.  Just reminding you 
                    what the lay of the land is.
                          (then)
                    We re all in this together.

      Jim echoes what he told Rose in the diner, but now the words 
      sound more like a WARNING than a source of comfort.

      With nothing left to say, Duke can only storm off, leaving a 
      quietly triumphant Big Jim to contemplate his next move.


      EXT. HEALTH CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON

      Later that day, a freshly stitched-up Barbie is smoking 
      outside the hospital.  

      He s staring at the undeveloped land across the road from 
      this place, another dense cluster of trees like the woods he 
      fled this morning.  

                                    ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)
                    Can I bum one?

      Barbie turns to see Angie, Junior s (now ex) girlfriend.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   41.


                                  BARBIE
                    Little young to be a nurse, aren t 
                    you?

                                  ANGIE
                    Just a lowly candy striper.
                          (then)
                    I heard you came in with Dr. 
                    Shumway s wife.  Julia?

      He nods, hands her his pack.

                                  ANGIE (CONT D)
                    So you saw it?  

                                  BARBIE
                    What there is to see.

                                  ANGIE
                    Some of the patients are describing 
                    it like we re stuck in a, a giant 
                    fishbowl.

      Barbie shrugs.  Maybe?

      Angie looks into this attractive stranger s eyes as he lights 
      his cigarette for her.

                                  ANGIE (CONT D)
                    I used to have fish.  Goldfish.  
                    Won a pair at the carnival when I 
                    was five.  But then one of them got 
                    sick and the other one... the other 
                    one fucking ate him, just pecked 
                    away at his friend until he was, 
                    like, dust.  Did you even know they 
                    did that?  Goldfish?

      Barbie shakes his head, not quite sure how to respond.  Angie 
      just laughs, darkly.  What a fucking day.  


      EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

      And now we re watching this same meet-cute from across the 
      street, where JUNIOR is spying on Barbie and Angie from 
      behind the cover of the dense treeline.  The young man 
      clearly doesn t like what he sees.  He nervously thumbs his 
      belt, where his KNIFE is now sheathed at his side.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   42.


      EXT. HEALTH CENTER - CONTINUOUS

      Meanwhile, a flirtatious Angie reaches out to touch Barbie s 
      face, brushes his hair back to inspect the fresh stitches. 

                                  ANGIE
                    Cancer, right?

                                  BARBIE
                          (taken aback)
                    Sorry?

                                  ANGIE
                    Your sign.  You re a cancer, yeah?

                                  BARBIE
                    I don t really believe that shit.

                                  ANGIE
                    And yet... 

      Barbie relents with a smile.

                                  BARBIE
                    How d you guess?

                                  ANGIE
                    Just the vibe you give off -- sad 
                    little crab, always looking for a 
                    home other than that big bad shell 
                    you hide behind.

      Barbie almost laughs at that, shakes his head.

                                  BARBIE
                    Trust me, all I want is out of 
                    here.

                                  ANGIE
                    Yeah.  You and me both.

                                    ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)
                    Help!

      Barbie and Angie turn to see our LOS ANGELES TOURISTS, Norrie 
      and her two mothers.  

                                    CAROLYN
                    Please, we need help!

                                  ALICE
                    I, I don t understand what s going 
                    on here, but our daughter s had 
                    some sort of... episode.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   43.


                                    CAROLYN
                       Episode?   It was a goddamn 
                    seizure!

                                  ALICE
                    I know what a seizure looks like, 
                    Carolyn.  I m a doctor.

                                    CAROLYN
                    You teach history!  

      Ignoring them, Angie reaches out to touch the shaken Norrie. 

                                  ANGIE
                    You okay, gorgeous?

      Norrie nods, appreciative of this friendly new adult 
      presence.

                                  ANGIE (CONT D)
                    Come on, let s get you looked at.

      As she escorts the girl and her parents into the hospital, 
      Angie looks back at an understanding Barbie.  He bids her 
      farewell with a little salute, before heading out, unaware of 
      Junior still watching his every move...   


      EXT. JULIA S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

      On the outskirts of town, Julia has finally arrived at her 
      cottage-style house.  She pulls out the electronic opener 
      attached to her keychain, says a little prayer to herself as 
      she aims it at the garage.

                                  JULIA
                    Please God, just let his stupid car 
                    be in there.

      And much to her relief, the door opens to reveal another 
      hybrid still parked inside.  Thrilled, Julia races into her 
      home through the garage door...


      INT. JULIA S HOME - CONTINUOUS

      ...only to find her foyer dark and silent.  

                                  JULIA
                    Peter?  Peter, you home?

      ARK ARK ARK!  Startled, Julia turns to find HORACE, her 
      husband s loyal Welsh Corgi.  The dog comes bounding up to 
      her, and a crestfallen Julia scratches behind his ears.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   44.


                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                    Where is he, boy?  Where d he go?

      But the dog just whines for his supper, as a deeply troubled 
      Julia is left wondering what s become of the one person in 
      Chester s Mill she thought she knew. 


      INT. RADIO STATION - DUSK

      Back inside WKIC, engineer Dodee is straining to listen to 
      something on headphones, adjusting sliders at her console 
      while Phil watches with interest.

                                  DODEE
                    Huh.

                                  PHIL
                    You got something?

                                  DODEE
                    So regular receivers aren t strong 
                    enough to pull a signal through 
                      whatever s cut us off, but I used 
                    to use our broadcasting tower like 
                    an oversized antenna to grab cool-
                    sounding feedback loops for my--  

                                  PHIL
                    Dodee, just tell me what you heard.

                                  DODEE
                    This.

      Flipping a switch, Dodee plays her intercepted transmission 
      over speakers.  The studio is instantly filled with an 
      ETHEREAL VOICE.  

                                  PHIL
                            (mesmerized)
                    Sounds like an angel.

                                  DODEE
                      Actually... I think it s Bj rk.

      And as Dodee turns up the volume, we can indeed hear that 
      singer s unique voice.  But then it disappears. 

                                  DODEE (CONT D)
                    Comes and goes like that.  
                    Sometimes it s music, sometime s 
                    it s, like, people s cell phone 
                      conversations.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   45.


                                  PHIL
                    So who s filtering what gets 
                    through?

      As Dodee considers this question, a MAN S VOICE starts to cut 
      through the static.

                                  PHIL (CONT D)
                    What now?

                                  DODEE
                    I dunno, but I ve been hearing some 
                     victor bravo  shit.  Military 
                      transmission, maybe?

                                  PHIL
                    Turn it up.

      Dodee does, and she and Phil can now hear the voice of a 40-
      something Army official we ll eventually learn is named 
      COLONEL JAMES COX:

                                    COLONEL COX (OVER SPEAKERS)
                    --but our best guess puts the dome 
                    over Chester s Mill at roughly 
                    forty thousand feet in height and--  

      The faint signal again craps out, as Dodee looks at her 
      colleague with disbelief: 

                                  DODEE
                    Hold up, did he just call it a 
                    dome?

                                  PHIL
                    Shut up a second.

      Colonel Cox s voice returns, though less clearly than before.

                                    COLONEL COX (OVER SPEAKERS)
                      --awaiting your authorization to 
                    fire a -kzzkt- with a medium-yield 
                    warhead at the exterior of the-- 

      And now the signal disappears for good, but Phil s heard more 
      than enough to suddenly look TERRIFIED.

                                  PHIL
                    They re talking about a nuke.  
                          (then)
                    They re talking about launching a 
                    goddamn nuke at us.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   46.


                                  DODEE
                    And?  That ll punch a hole in this 
                    thing, right?

                                  PHIL
                    Maybe.  But it ll also kill every 
                    living thing inside.

      Dodee is understandably aghast.

                                  DODEE
                    No way.  They re on our side.  
                      Whatever s going on out there, 
                    those guys wouldn t risk killing 
                      civilians.  Right?

      Hearing the uncertainty in Dodee s voice, Phil just looks 
      away.  He s already weighing what to do with this 
        information.  Should they tell someone, and if so, who?

      But as an Icelandic voice again ripples through the static, 
      we CUT TO:  


      EXT. ROUTE 119 - DUSK

      Barbie finally returns to his shitty compact car, still 
      parked where he was forced to leave it earlier that day.  He 
      unlocks the passenger-side door and opens the glove 
        compartment, looking around to make sure he s alone before 
      stuffing the HANDGUN into his jacket pocket.

      Barbie then opens the trunk, pulls out his military DUFFEL 
      BAG.  He slams the trunk shut, but when he does, he s taken 
      aback to find JUNIOR standing right there.

                                  JUNIOR
                    Evening.
                          (beat)
                    Need a hand?

      Barbie shoulders his bag as he sizes up the ripped young guy 
      standing before him.

                                  BARBIE
                    I m all right.  Thanks.

                                  JUNIOR
                    Hey, do we know each other?

                                  BARBIE
                    Doubt it.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   47.


                                  JUNIOR
                    You sure?  Something about you 
                    looks so familiar.  You re from 
                    around here, right?

      Barbie just shakes his head, starts walking away.

                                  JUNIOR (CONT D)
                    I m talking to you, asshole!

      Hearing that word, Barbie stops.  Drops his bag.  Slowly 
      turns around.  

                                  BARBIE
                    I don t know what I did to piss you 
                    off, but I promise... you don t 
                    want to start something here.

      Clearly not aware he s dealing with a guy who put a man in 
      the ground hours earlier, Junior gets right in Barbie s face. 

                                  JUNIOR
                    And what if I do?  

      Barbie is trying to maintain his cool, but he looks like he 
      might actually beat this kid to death.  Just when these two 
      are about to come to blows, FLOODLIGHTS illuminate them both.  

      It s Duke, who s again driving with his deputy Linda in 
      shotgun.  Junior cools his shit the second he sees him.  

                                  JUNIOR (CONT D)
                    Evening, Sheriff Perkins.

                                  DUKE
                    Junior.

      The sheriff turns his attention to a patched-up Barbie.

                                  DUKE (CONT D)
                    How you getting along?

                                  BARBIE
                    All right.
                          (then; lying)
                      Everyone s been very welcoming.

                                  DUKE
                    Well.  Be seeing you.

      With a nod, Duke drives off, and Barbie turns his attention 
      back to Junior... only to find that the strange young man has 
      already disappeared, having retreated back to the shadows.              UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   48.


      INT. ANGIE S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      Returning home after a long day of hell at the hospital, 
      Angie flips on a light switch, but nothing happens.  Shit, 
      that s right, without a generator, she s in the dark.  

      Stumbling into her kitchen, Angie pulls out a book of 
      matches.  She lights one, illuminating a FIGURE standing 
      directly behind her. 

      It s Junior.  He grabs Angie, putting one hand over her 
      mouth.  With his free hand, he presses his hunting knife to 
      the terrified woman s throat.

                                  JUNIOR
                    Relax.  Relax!  It s me, Angie.  
                    It s me.  Listen.  My truck is 
                    right out back.  If you do 
                      everything I say, I promise you 
                    won t--

      No passive victim, Angie ELBOWS Junior hard in the sternum.  
      He drops his blade, and Angie goes RUNNING for the door.  

                                  ANGIE
                    HELP ME!  SOMEBODY--

      That s when Junior TACKLES his smaller opponent.  On their 
      way to the ground, Angie s skull hits the edge of a Formica 
      countertop with a sickening THUD. 

      Her body trembles for a moment, then falls still.  Junior 
      looks down at the unconscious woman with regret.

                                  JUNIOR
                    I m so sorry, Ange.  

      He kneels down, and kisses Angie on her bleeding forehead.

                                  JUNIOR (CONT D)
                    I didn t want it to go like this.

      With that, he lovingly scoops her into his arms.


      EXT. CABIN - NIGHT

      Back in the woods where his morning began, Barbie has hiked 
      to a remote old CABIN.  He drops his bag outside before 
      venturing into the old structure s back door, already AJAR.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   49.


      INT. CABIN - CONTINUOUS

      Inside, Barbie walks into what looks like the scene of some 
      earlier STRUGGLE: furniture has been flipped, pictures have 
      been broken, etc.

      He goes to an overturned couch and pushes it back a few 
      inches.  Underneath, he finds the other BLUE TENNIS SHOE 
      belonging to the man Barbie buried this morning.  Must have 
      been knocked off during their fight.  Now that he s stuck in 
      town indefinitely, Barbie s returned to the scene of his 
      crime, one he was clearly forced to leave in a hurry.  


      INT. CABIN BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Pushing deeper into the cabin, Barbie now inspects its only 
      bedroom, appointed with a little wooden chair and desk.  He 
      looks at the dead man s unmade bed, tries to imagine if he 
      could actually sleep in it.

      Barbie checks the closet, mostly empty.  He opens a drawer in 
      a night stand, nothing in it but some weird old porno 
      magazines.  Who the hell was this guy?  

      Spotting a little WASTEBASKET, Barbie tips out its contents 
      onto the floor: candy wrappers and a few crumpled pieces of 
      paper.  Barbie picks up one of these scraps, unfolds it.  
      It s just some random doodles and a few scratched out phone 
      numbers.  But when he flips the sheet over, Barbie FROWNS.

                                  BARBIE
                    Shit.

      The piece of paper is from a PRESCRIPTION PAD belonging to 
      DOCTOR PETER SHUMWAY, Julia s missing husband.  

      Did this cabin belong to him?  Is that who Barbie killed, the 
      spouse of a fucking investigative reporter?

      Realizing exactly how bad this might be for him, Barbie 
      starts WIPING DOWN every surface he s touched, doing his best 
      to eliminate any trace of prints.  


      EXT. CABIN - CONTINUOUS

      And with his best chance at shelter no longer a viable 
      option, Barbie shoulders his bag and heads back into the 
      night.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   50.


      EXT. BARN - NIGHT

      Elsewhere in Chester s Mill, teenager Joe McClatchey is 
      sitting on the roof of the family barn, smoking another joint 
      as he looks out at the small-scale military invasion 
      unfolding on the other side of the barrier.  

                                    ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)
                    Dude.

      Joe turns to see one of his friends from school, an older kid 
      named BEN DRAKE, who s just climbed onto this roof.

                                  BEN
                    It looks like a movie.

      Joe just takes another long drag.

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    So both of your  rents were 
                      really...?

                                  JOE
                    Caught out.  Yeah.

      Ben takes a seat next to him.  Tries some gallows humor. 

                                  BEN
                    Well, silver lining.  Your house 
                    parties are gonna be sick.  

      But Joe doesn t exactly look elated.

                                  JOE
                    You bring the stuff?

      Ben hands him a little Ziplock.  Joe opens the baggie and 
      takes out two pills, dry-swallows them both.

                                  BEN
                    You re hardcore.  Tripping balls at 
                    the end of the world.

                                  JOE
                    You think that s what this is?  
                      Armageddon?

      Ben shrugs.

                                  BEN
                    My mom thinks maybe it s natural, 
                    like some aurora borealis bullshit.  

      Joe shakes his head.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   51.


                                  JOE
                    No.  Feels more like we re under 
                    attack.

                                  BEN
                    By who?

                                  JOE
                    By whom.  And I don t know.  China?  
                    Martians?  The goddamn future?

                                  BEN
                    Christ.  So, like, how do we fight 
                    back?

                                  JOE
                    I ve been thinking.  This force 
                    field thing.  It s gotta take a lot 
                    of energy to power it, right?

                                  BEN
                    I guess?

                                  JOE
                    Well, where the hell is all that 
                    power coming from?  Is it somewhere 
                    out there, or is it.... 

      Suddenly, Joe falls silent.  His body is perfectly still.

                                  BEN
                    Joe?  Don t mess with me, man.  
                    That shit s not gonna hit you for 
                    another hour.  

      But that s when Joe s body begins to TREMBLE.  

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    JOE!

      Like the teenage tourist Norrie before him, a convulsing Joe 
      COLLAPSES, and begins repeating an eerily identical phrase: 

                                  JOE
                    The pink stars are falling.  The 
                    pink stars are falling in lines.  
                    The pink stars are falling...

      Ben is freaking out, but Joe just keeps repeating his mantra, 
      over and over and over, as we CUT TO:            UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   52.


      INT. FALLOUT SHELTER - NIGHT

      Later that evening, Angie finally opens her eyes.  She s 
      horrified to learn that she s RESTRAINED to a small bed 
      inside some kind of CONCRETE BUNKER.  A single bare bulb 
      illuminates a sink, toilet, and some old provisions.

      A thick metal door creaks open to reveal Junior, who offers 
      an apologetic smile.

                                  JUNIOR
                    Hey, Angie.

      As soon as she sees him, Angie begins to SCREAM. 

                                  JUNIOR (CONT D)
                    Save your voice, babe.  No one can 
                    hear us all the way down here.

                                  ANGIE
                    Down...?  

                                  JUNIOR
                    My family s always been paranoid 
                    about security.  This is our 
                    fallout shelter.  You re safe here.

                                  ANGIE
                    The hell are you talking about?

                                  JUNIOR
                    I know how this must look, but I 
                    swear to Christ, in the long run, 
                    you re going to thank me for this.

      Hearing the words  long run,  Angie starts to CRY.

                                  ANGIE
                    Oh my God.  You ve lost your 
                    goddamn mind.

                                  JUNIOR
                    No, I m the only person who 
                      understands what s really going on 
                    here.  All I ask for is patience.  

                                  ANGIE
                    Moron!  You don t think people will 
                    look for me?  When they find out 
                    what you did, you re going to 
                    Shawshank for the rest of your 
                    goddamn life!

      But Junior just looks at her with confidence.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   53.


                                  JUNIOR
                    Patience.

      Angie once again starts to SCREAM, as Junior exits, closing 
      the thick door behind him and instantly MUTING her cries.


      EXT. OLD SHED - CONTINUOUS

      Above ground, Junior emerges from the shelter s entrance, an 
      old steel shed in a BACKYARD somewhere in Chester s Mill.  
      He s padlocking the entrance to this subterranean bunker when 
      someone appears behind him.

                                    ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)
                    Junior?

      Junior wheels around to see BIG JIM RENNIE.  But instead of 
      freaking out, Junior gives this man a warm smile.

                                  JUNIOR
                    Dad.

      That s right, Big Jim is Junior s FATHER, and this is the 
      backyard of the same house the men still share to this day.

                                  BIG JIM
                    The heck are you doing out here?

                                  JUNIOR
                    I heard you on WKIC, sounded like 
                    we might need the old shelter.
                    But it s... covered in mold down 
                    there, every inch. 

                                  BIG JIM
                    Least of our worries now.  All that 
                    matters is you re okay.

      Unaware that he s standing directly above the innocent woman 
      Junior just imprisoned, Big Jim EMBRACES his son.

                                  JUNIOR
                      Whatever s going on, I want to 
                    help.

                                  BIG JIM
                    And I appreciate that, but your 
                    studies--

                                  JUNIOR
                    No.  School is out there, I m in 
                    here.  And I want to help.  As long 
                    as it takes.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   54.


      Big Jim looks at his only son with pride.  He thinks for a 
      moment, finally asks:

                                  BIG JIM
                    You ever considered a career in law 
                      enforcement?

      And off a gobsmacked Junior, already fantasizing about the 
      possibilities, CUT TO:


      INT. JULIA S HOME OFFICE - NIGHT

      With her dog Horace asleep at her feet, Julia is hard at work 
      on her laptop.  Refusing to let her husband s disappearance 
      stop her from doing her job, Julia is mocking up tomorrow s 
      72-point headline.  She can only think of one word to 
      describe the day s unexplained horrors: TRAGEDY

      Suddenly, Julia hears a noise downstairs.  It s someone 
      KNOCKING at her front door.

                                  JULIA
                    Peter.

      She leaps over Horace and races for the stairs, praying this 
      might finally be her wayward husband returning home.


      EXT. JULIA S FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS

      But when she flings open her front door, Julia is surprised 
      to see another man entirely standing before her.

                                  JULIA
                    Oh. 

      It s BARBIE.

                                  BARBIE
                    Sorry to bother.  The hospital gave 
                    me your address.  I just wanted to 
                    see if your husband...

      Julia shakes her head.

                                  BARBIE (CONT D)
                    Shit.  I m sorry. 

                                  JULIA
                    No.  It was... it was nice of you 
                    to think of us.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   55.


                                  BARBIE
                    You re sure there s nowhere else in 
                    town he might be?  You guys don t 
                    have a lake house or something?

      Julia almost laughs.

                                  JULIA
                    Peter and I can barely cover the 
                    mortgage on this place most months.  
                    Anyway, I already checked his usual 
                    haunts.  No luck.  I m hoping he s 
                    out volunteering with the EMTs.

                                  BARBIE
                    Makes sense.  Your guy, what s he 
                    look like, anyway?

                                  JULIA
                    Dark hair, good build, about your 
                    height.  
                          (a little embarrassed)
                    You know, handsome.

                                  BARBIE
                    Well, I ll keep an eye out.

      He starts to leave, but after a beat, Julia calls out to him.

                                  JULIA
                    Barbie.

      He stops cold, turns to look back at her.  

                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                    You have someplace to stay tonight?

      Oh.  Fuck.  Barbie hadn t been expecting this.  

                                  BARBIE
                    Figured I d just rough it.  Not my 
                    first time under the stars.

                                  JULIA
                    Don t be crazy.  You said it 
                    yourself, this might be a while.
                          (beat)
                    You should stay here.

                                  BARBIE
                    Oh, no, I couldn t--           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   56.


                                  JULIA
                    We ve got a guest room and 
                      everything.  Please.  I insist.

      Barbie takes a moment with this, considers the possibilities. 

                                  BARBIE
                    That s very kind of you.  Thanks.

      With a smile, Julia gestures for Barbie to follow her inside, 
      unwittingly welcoming the man who may very well have murdered 
      her husband into their home.

      As the front door closes behind them, CUT TO:


      EXT. PRETTY VALLEY ROAD - NIGHT

      On the other side of town, Linda has returned to the 
      invisible barrier with Duke.  All the two of them can do is 
      watch helplessly as countless SCIENTISTS and SOLDIERS 
      continue surveying the perimeter around Chester s Mill 
      without ever acknowledging its inhabitants.

      Wistful, Linda reaches out to again touch the invisible wall.

                                  LINDA
                    Rusty and I were supposed to be in 
                    Derry today.  For the game.
                          (then; sadly)
                    But I told him if we were ever 
                    gonna afford a honeymoon, we both 
                    had to put in more overtime...

      Duke isn t quite sure what to say to that.  He already feels 
      guilty as hell.

                                  LINDA (CONT D)
                    Why us?  I mean, why the hell would 
                    anyone pick Chester s Mill for 
                    anything?

      And now her boss just stares down at his boots.

                                  DUKE
                          (softly)
                    Maybe we re being punished.

      Linda turns to look back at him.

                                  LINDA
                    Sorry?           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   57.


                                  DUKE
                    You re good police, Linda... but 
                    there s a lot I ve tried to protect 
                    you from.  About this place.   

                                  LINDA
                    Like what?

      Duke clears his throat, trying not to get emotional.  Then he 
      looks at the barrier.  For the first time, the sheriff 
      reaches out to touch the strange force field for himself.  
      The hair on his arm stands on end as he feels the initial 
      tingle.  Huh.  

      His curiosity satisfied, Duke looks back at his deputy:

                                  DUKE
                    Last year, Big Jim Rennie came to 
                    me and--

      But that s when something inside Duke Perkins begins to HUM.  

      Feeling a strange tingling sensation, he looks down at his 
      uniform shirt... just in time to see his PACEMAKER come 
      EXPLODING OUT OF HIS CHEST.

      Splattered with a fine mist of blood, Linda looks at the 
      fresh hole in Duke with horrified bewilderment.  What the 
      hell just happened?  

      Not quite sure himself, Duke Perkins collapses.  He s dead.

      As Linda opens her mouth to unleash a piercing scream, we 
      HARD CUT TO: 


      INT. GUEST ROOM - NIGHT

      Silence.  Barbie is alone in one of Julia s cozy, eerily 
      quiet spare bedrooms, wondering how the hell his day ended 
      here.  

      He tosses his duffel bag onto a fold-out bed, then begins 
      looking for any more clues about Julia s husband.  But this 
      room s walls are lined with nothing but framed stories from 
      Julia s days as a reporter in Chicago.

      Returning to his duffel bag, Barbie UNZIPS it and finally 
      reveals the item he was sent to Chester s Mill to obtain.  
      It s not drugs or bricks of cash, but a SMALL BLACK BOX, 
      about the size and thickness of a modern Apple TV.             UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   58.


      It appears to be made of onyx or hard plastic, and the lid of 
      the box is adorned with a UNIQUE SYMBOL, one that looks like 
      an elaborate character from some ancient language.

      Barbie OPENS the lid of the small box... to reveal that it s 
      COMPLETELY EMPTY.  He mutters under his breath:  

                                  BARBIE
                    Why the hell would anybody die for 
                    this?

      CRASH.  Barbie s startled by the sound of glass breaking 
      elsewhere in this house, followed by SCREAMING.

      Tossing the strange box back into his open bag, a concerned 
      Barbie races out of the guest room.


      INT. DEN - CONTINUOUS

      Julia is sitting on the edge of a desk in her husband s DEN, 
      which is decorated with various diplomas and medical 
        credentials.  

      Entering this room, Barbie immediately notices the smashed 
      remains of a framed picture that the clearly distraught Julia 
      just threw against a wall.  

                                  BARBIE
                    Julia...?

                                  JULIA
                    You must think I m an idiot.

      Uh-oh.  Barbie tenses.

                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                    I m a goddamn investigative 
                    reporter, and I can t see what s 
                    going on right under my nose.

                                  BARBIE
                    What are you--

                                  JULIA
                    I just found this hidden in the 
                    back one of Peter s drawers. 

      Julia holds up a CELL PHONE.  

                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                    I ve never seen this before in my 
                    life, but my husband s been using 
                    it for months.  
                                  (MORE)           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   59.

                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                    He made hundreds of calls on this 
                    thing, all to the exact same 
                    person.
                          (beat)
                    A woman named Eloise.

      Shit.  Barbie tries to play it cool, but he recognizes this 
      name immediately.  It s the name of the woman Barbie called 
      right before the dome came down.    

                                  BARBIE
                          (nervously)
                    You have any idea who that is...?

                                  JULIA
                    Of course I do.  It must be his 
                    mistress.

      Relieved, Barbie reaches down to pick up the smashed picture.  
      Inside its frame is a photo of Peter Shumway with his wife 
      from happier times.  No question about it, this is definitely 
      the same man Barbie buried this morning.  Shit.  

                                  BARBIE
                    This is him, huh?

        A devastated Julia can barely muster a nod.  Barbie tries to 
      offer some solace.

                                  BARBIE (CONT D)
                    Look, there s no point in jumping 
                    to conclusions--

                                  JULIA
                    I m not.  Things have been... off 
                    between us for a while now.  I 
                    thought the move would help.  A 
                    fresh start, you know?  Christ, I 
                    gave up everything for him.

      Barbie shakes his head, looks this woman in the eye, and 
      tells her the truth:

                                  BARBIE
                    Listen to me.  A man would have to 
                    be out of his mind to step out on a 
                    woman like you.

      For a beat, Julia simply looks at this younger man.  Maybe 
      it s just the aftereffects of this traumatic day, but 
      something overtakes her.  

      She grabs Barbie, pulls him close... and KISSES him deeply.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   60.


      At first, Barbie resists, gently pulling away.  How the hell 
      can he do this to the same woman he just turned into a widow?  
      But as a smoldering Julia stares at him, whatever better 
      angels Barbie once possessed are soon vanquished.

      And as Barbie kisses her back with equally violent passion, 
      our camera drifts away from this duo, craning out the den s 
      open window.


      EXT. CHESTER S MILL  - VARIOUS - NIGHT

      As Arcade Fire s  My Body Is A Cage  (or something similarly 
      operatic) starts to play, we float up and over the captive 
      town of Chester s Mill.  Each and every one of its houses 
      looks like a story, a wellspring of secrets and lies bubbling 
      beneath the relentless pressure of the dome. 

      We soar all the way across town until we reach the tall tree 
      with the same BIRD NEST where our story began.  The newly 
      hatched chick has been joined by a few other hungry mouths, 
      but their mother is nowhere to be seen.  

      WHAM.  That s when Mama Bird flies straight for this nest, 
      only to be REBUFFED by the invisible barrier.  
        Heartbreakingly, this bird was trapped on the other side, 
      leaving her young ones starving and alone.

      But now we join this distraught mother bluebird by cutting 
      OUTSIDE the dome for the first and only time in our series.

      Zooming out, we pull past throngs of confused scientists, 
      breathless reporters and worried loved ones, until the 
      massive dome around Chester s Mill finally comes into view.  

      Though transparent, the dome starts to become visible as 
      light is subtly warped at its curves.  From this viewpoint, 
      we can finally see the structure s terrifying scope.    

      And just as the Arcade Fire dies out, something extraordinary 
      happens.  A powerful military spotlights sweeps over the 
      dome, and an IMAGE flashes across its transparent surface, 
      shimmering like a mirage -- it s the same UNIQUE SYMBOL that 
      was on the empty box Barbie took from Julia s late husband.    

      But the mysterious symbol soon fades from view as suddenly as 
      it appeared.  The military spotlight then sweeps past us, 
      filling the frame with blinding whiteness, as we--

 SMASH TO BLACK.
