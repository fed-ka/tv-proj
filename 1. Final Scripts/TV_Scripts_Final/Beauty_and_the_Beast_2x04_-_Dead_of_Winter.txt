        FADE IN:

    1EXT.MANHATTAN STREETS (STOCK) . ESTABLISHING1

        Winter has Manhattan in its grasp. Dirty snow is piled up
        along the sidewalks, icicles hang from the bare branches of
        trees, cabs send up waves of slush as they move down the
        streets. The imagery should be cold and stark, not festive.


                                                                    CUT TO:


      2INT.CANDLEWORKS CHAMBER. DAY2

          A metal brazier heats a vat of hot wax in a cozy underground
        chamber. SARAH, the candlemaker of the world below, lifts an
        ornate candle carefully and moves it to a wall rack to
          harden. The rack is full of similar candles. FATHER, VINCENT,
        and various tunnel children watch. Father holds a finished
          candle, admiring it.


~FATHER
                        Lovely. Sarah, I do think these are
                      the finest candles you've ever made
                      for us.

                                      SARAH
                      You say that every year.

                                      VINCENT.
                        Every year it is true.

        Sarah takes down a candle and studies it with satisfaction.


                                    SARAH
                      I love making the winterfest
                      candles. They're special.

                                      ERIC
                                (eagerly)
                      Do we get to take them up now?

                                      SARAH
                        Well, the first batch is ready
                      for delivery. Father?

        The kids look to Father. When he NODS, they surround Sarah,
        clamoring for candles. She begins to distribute finished
        candles to the children.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                          2.

~ERIC
                        Bet I finish first!

                                        KIPPER
                        No you won't.

                                      ERIC
                        Will so.

                                        KIPPER
                        Won't.

                                        FATHER
                                (sternly)
                        This is not a race. You'vebeen
                        given a very important
                          responsibility.

        The children nod gravely.

                                        FATHER.
                        Good. Well, you all have your
                        lists. Go on now, and&

          Kipper bolts for the door to get a head start on the
          others. Eric notices.

~
                                      ERIC
                        Hey!No fair!

          Then Eric is off as well, triggering a general stampede.

                                        FATHER
                                (shouts after them)
                        ... be careful up there!

        As the footsteps of running children echo down the tunnels,
          receding, Father smiles fondly.

                                      SARAH
                        I wish they wouldn't run like
                        that. They could fall...

                                        VINCENT
                          Sometimes we need to fall...
                        so we can learn how to get up.

                                      SARAH
                                (nods, smiles)
                        Mouse was the worst. Do you
                        remember the year he broke half
                        the candles with that dreadful
                        catapult of his?

                                                                      (CONTINUED)                                                                     3

                                        FATHER
                                  (chuckles)
                        Our poor helpers thought someone
                        was flinging missiles at them.
                                (to Vincent)
                        It wasn't so long ago that you and
                        Devin were the boys racing to make
                        their deliveries.

                                        VINCENT .
                                (takes down a candle)
                          I think I still remember how...

          We move in TIGHT on Vincent's hand as he holds the ornate
          candle and turns it tenderly between his fingers.

                                                                    MATCH DISSOLVE TO:


      3EXT.CATHY'S TERRACE - NIGHT3

          The same candle, now in Catherine's hand.

                                        CATHY
                          Vincent, it's beautiful...

          The terrace windows are rimed with frost, and there's
          traces of old snow along the parapets. Both are warmly
          dressed against the winter chill.

                                        CATHY
                        When I was a little girl, I was
                        scared of the dark. My mother gave
                        me a candle to light at my bedside
                        when I went to sleep... just a
                          birthday candle, a tiny little
                        thing, but somehow it made it all
                        right. I've loved candles ever
                        since.

                                                  VINCENT
                        This is no ordinary candle,
                          Catherine. This is for winter
                        fest...

                                        CATHY
                          Kipper was going on about that
                        last week...

                                                                      (CONTINUED)

                        It's a special time for us...
                        we have other celebrations, all
                        the holidays and traditions we
                        share with your world... but
                        winterfest is our own... a day
                        to remember our past, dream of
                        our future.
                                (touches her candle)
                        Each winter we send these candles
                        to our helpers in the world
                          above... without their light, our
                        world would be dark, our lives
                        cold without their warmth. The
                        candles are our way of saying that
                        they are a part of us...
                                (beat, tenderly)
                          Everyone... the whole community
                        ... is agreed. This year's winterfest will be
                        incomplete ... unless you are there.

            Catherine is deeply touched. For a moment she searches for the
          words to express how much she values this sign of acceptance
          from the world below, but no words are adequate. She smiles and
          looks down at the candle, obviously treasuring it and what it
          represents. Then she sets it aside and puts her arms around
          Vincent and her head against his chest, wordless and happy.



                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

          SERIES OF SHOTS (MOS) - DAY

          as the tunnel children deliver the special candles to
          helpers all around the city.


    4a) BENNY the bicycle messenger has stopped on a busy street4
          corner. Eric hands him a candle, then whispers in his ear.
          Benny grins broadly, lifts Eric onto the bike behind him. The
          boy holds tight as they take off. The basket on Benny's bike
          is full of candles.


    5b) DR. PETER ALCOTT emerges through a set of swinging 5
          doors in surgeon's garb, and is momentarily startled to see
          Kipper waiting for him. But when the boy offers him a candle,
          Alcott smiles broadly.


    6c) Benny whizzes through traffic, Eric riding happily6
        behind him. The basket is only half-full now.                                                                                          5.


    7d) LOU THE-BARBER is sitting in his own barber chair 7
          reading the paper when the door bangs open and a breathless
          underground girl gives him a candle.


  8e) SEBASTIEN, an elderly (60-70) magician in tattered top hat8
        and faded tails, performs on a snowy street corner to a
        sparse crowd. Kipper dashes up, searches for the candle,
        can't find it. Sebastien pulls the candle out of the boy's
        ear, eliciting a huge grin.


  9f) Benny wheels up beside a cab stopped at a light, and Eric9
        taps on the window. The driver is a street-smart young
        woman. She rolls down the glass, takes the candle,
          exchanging high-fives with Benny.


  10g) Kipper rushes inside a butcher shop. Through the 10
        glass, we see him giving a candle to the butcher. He exits still
        clutching several candles.


  11h) Eric solemnly shakes hands with Benny on the11
        sidewalk, then turns and saunters down into a subway.

                                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

  12INT. FATHER'S CHAMBER - NIGHT12

       Vincent enters and finds Eric and Father playing chess. He
        moves behind Eric and watches as Eric makes a move. Father
          studies the board.

                                      FATHER
                      You might want to reconsider that
                        move, Eric. You've left your knight
                        undefended.

        Eric just shakes his head. Father shrugs, reaches out,
        captures the knight with a bishop and removes the piece
        from the board, as Kipper bursts in, breathless. .

                                      KIPPER
                      I'm finished! I'm-
                              (sees Eric, reacts)
                      What are you doing here?

                                      ERIC
                        Playing chess.
                                (moves piece)
                        Check. And mate in three.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                          6.

                                                                                          12

    12CONTINUED:

          As Father stares at the board in dismay, Eric calmly exits
          the chamber, pausing to talk to Kipper.

                                      ERIC
                        Always start with Benny first.

                                        KIPPER
                                (runs after him)
                        Not fair! You cheated!

          They exit, running!


    13ANGLE ON FATHER.
                                                                                              13
          Father begins putting the chessmen away, fitting each one
          carefully into its niche inside a hinged BLACK LACQUER BOX.

                                        FATHER
                        I'm looking forward to
                          winterfest... There are a few
                        helpers I can still beat.

                                        VINCENT
                        Don't think of yourself as a bad
                        player .. just a very good teacher.


          Father continues to put away the chess set.

                                        FATHER
                        Is the Great Hall in order?

                                        VINCENT
                        One of the tables needed some
                        repairs. Cullen and I carried it
                        up to his workshop.

                                        FATHER
                        Good, good.
                                (beat, muses)
                        A third of a century& it's hard' for

                        a babe in arms that first year...

                                      VINCENT.
                        My oldest memory is of a
                          winterfest. I must have been
                        three or four... I remember being
                        in a cold dark room where my
                        footsteps echoed around me. I
                        was frightened, and Devin held
                        my hand. Then the candles were
                        lit... the darkness pushed back...
                        when I glimpsed the tapestries
                       for the first time, they took my
                        breath away...

          Father has finished fitting the chessmen into their niches. He
          folds up the board, but DOES NOT CLOSE THE BOX before he takes
        off his glasses and leans back.

                                      FATHER
                                  (reflective)
                        It was John who hung those
                          tapestries...

                                      VINCENT
                          Paracelsus?

                                      FATHER
                                (nods)
                        He was the one who found the Great
                        Hall... for a time he talked of
                        making it his chamber... even then,
                        his dreams were... large.

                                      VINCENT
                        He was exiled before the first
                          winterfest...

                                      FATHER
                        Yes... afterwards, we... needed a
                        way to heal ourselves...
                                (beat, melancholy)
                        We barely filled one table then. The
                        children set the places. The wound was
                        so raw... he had been part of us for so
                        long.

                                      VINCENT
                        What happened, Father?

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                          8.

                                        FATHER
                          A mistake was made... there was a
                        place for each of us... and an
                        empty chair... where John always
                        sat.
                                (beat)
                        I took it away. Pascal's father
                        removed the place setting. Not a
                        word was said. We just... went on.


          For a moment, Father sits, staring off down the years, to that
          chair that still stands empty in his memories. Then he returns
        to the present.

                                        FATHER
                        Well, that's history now, dead and
                        gone. So, tell me, did you talk to
                        Mouse?

        We begin to MOVE IN on the box with the chess set as Father
          reaches over to it.

                                        VINCENT
                        He's promised that this year
                        Arthur will remain at home....

        We are TIGHT on the chess set as Father's hand CLOSES the
          hinged lid. A stylized ROSE, worked in bright SILVER, is
          inlaid into the top of the black lacquer box. HOLD on the
          image as we
                                                                    DISSOLVE TO:


  14INT. TAMARA'S LAIR. NIGHT14

          Flickering reddish torchlight illuminates a dank chamber deep
          within the earth. The walls are covered with patches of nitre,
        and dozens of MASKS. Masks carved from wood or stone, cast in
          plaster, sewn together from leather. Animal faces and grotesque
          tribal fetishes mingle with lifelike human faces, their mouths
        open as if to scream. Everywhere empty eyes gape down from the
        rock walls. The chamber is malign, disturbing.                                                                                        9.


  1515ANGLE ON TAMARA

        as she shapes the features of a clay bust on a table in front
        of her. Her long fingers are skilled, but somehow cruel; she
        twists the clay as if she were trying to hurt it. She's tall,
          powerfully-built, with masses of long black hair falling down
        across bare shoulders. Her face is painted in bizarre
        patterns, her skin pale from years beneath the earth. There's
        something wild-eyed and fierce about her. As she works, she
        addresses a figure in the shadows that we do not see.


                                      TAMARA
                      Bring me the face. Without the
                      face, I cannot do it.


  16REVERSE ANGLE 16

        on the figure in the shadows. He wears a black cloak, a
        hood, gloves. We cannot see his features, but when he
        replies, he speaks with Vincent's voice.

                                    MAN IN SHADOWS
                              (Vincent's voice)
                        Whatever you require, Tamara, that
                      you shall have.


  17RESUME ON TAMARA 17

        She seems vastly amused.

                                      TAMARA
                      You talk so sweet... that voice
                      will get you anything.
                              (beat)
                      Bring me the face, and I will make it
                      yours. The man who wears it now won't
                      be needing it, will he?

                                    MAN IN SHADOWS
                              (Vincent's voice)
                      No.I don't imagine he will.

                                      TAMARA
                      Will you kill them all?

                                    MAN IN SHADOWS
                              (Vincent's voice)
                      They are my friends, my family.
                      Their world is my world. Why should
                      I mean them harm, Tamara?

        He pauses for a beat, then answers his own question, but
        now he speaks in Father's voice, and then in the voices of
        other members of the underground community.

                                (Father's voice)
                        Because they disgraced me, took away
                        everything that mattered, work and
                      home and all I loved?
                              (in Pascal's voice)
                        Because they stole my systems, my
                        notes, the journals of my research
                      and explorations?
                              (in Mouse's voice)
                        Because they chased me from their
                        light, hounded me even from my sad
                        refuge in the darkness?

                                      TAMARA
                              (laughs, amused)
                      You have the voice but not the words.

        as he steps forward, so the light from the chamber's torches
        falls across his face, and see for the first time that it is
          PARACELSUS, the alchemist. His mask of beaten gold covers
        one side of his face.

                      If they find you out, this time they
                      will kill you. It was all so long
                      ago. What has their world to do with
                      you?

                        confused alarms of struggle and

    20INT.FATHER'S CHAMBER. NIGHT20

          The council is meeting to plan the winterfest. Present
          around the table are Father, Vincent, MARY, PASCAL, and a
          big bear of a man named WILLIAM with a magnificent beard.

                                        FATHER
                        We'll need volunteers to guide
                        the helpers down...

                                        PASCAL
                        I've already put out the word on
                        the pipes.

                                        FATHER
                        Excellent. William, how are we doing
                        with the food?

                                        WILLIAM
                        Ought to be plenty, but it'd help if
                        we had an exact count of who's
                        coming and who's not.

                                      MARY
                        Has anyone heard from Narcissa?

                                        PASCAL
                        She doesn't answer our calls.
                        She must be down below the level of
                        the pipes again.

                                        VINCENT
                        Lana left a candle in her chamber. If
                        she returns in time, she will find it
                        there. But Narcissa's nature is a
                        solitary one. I was still a boy the
                        last time she came to winterfest...


                                      MARY
                        It makes me worry.We see so
                        little of her...

                                        FATHER
                        It is her choice to live apart
                        from us...

                                                                      (CONTINUED)                                                                                        13.

                                      MARY
                        But think of her age! What if
                          something happened to her? Her
                        eyes are worse every year...

                                        VINCENT
                          Narcissa sees things that are
                        hidden from you and me. And
                          wherever she might wander, she
                        always finds her way home.

                                        FATHER

                        where she's been.

                                                                    DISSOLVE TO:


  21INT. THE WELL - NIGHT21

          A huge black shaft sinks deep into the bowels of the earth, its
          stone walls covered with slime and pale phosphorescent patches
        of nitre. The only sound is the steady DRIP of water somewhere
        far below. A solitary figure, bent and frail, slowly climbs the
          steps that spiral around the interior of the well. One hand
          feels the wall carefully as she ascends. NARCISSA carries a
          small, covered basket, but no light, making her way through the
          darkness by the faint glow of the nitre. .

        She is smiling, talking to herself low under her breath,
          seemingly at ease even in this venomous dark, when suddenly she
          hears the sound of FOOTSTEPS echoing faintly down the well, and
          REACTS with alarm. She stops where she is, craning her head up.                                                                                          14.


    22NARCISSA'S POV22

          Her vision is badly impaired by her cataracts as she stares up
          the well. Everything is blurred and out-of-focus; all we can
          see is the flickering light of the torch as someone DESCENDS,
          the steps toward her. The echoing footsteps GROW LOUDER, the
          torch burns larger, nearer.

          Finally, dimly, Narcissa can make out the figure of a tall,
          cloaked man coming toward her.


    23BACK TO THE SCENE23

          Narcissa shrinks back against the wall, alarmed.
          You into some strange people this far down.

                                        NARCISSA
                        Who... who is there?


    24ANGLE UP THE WELL 24

          The cloaked figure comes to a stop several steps above
            Narcissa. He carries a burning torch in one hand, a white
          canvas sack in the other. He descends one more step. Light
          shimmers off the beaten gold of his mask, but when Paracelsus
          speaks, he uses Vincent's voice.

                                        PARACELSUS
                                (in Vincent's voice)
                          Vincent. . .

          The familiar voice puts Narcissa at ease. She smiles,
          climbs another step, her hand groping in front of her.

                                        NARCISSA
                          Vincent... so far from home,
                          child...

                                        PARACELSUS
                                (in Vincent's voice)
                        I'm sorry if I frightened you,
                          Narcissa. I did not think to meet
                        anyone in such a dark place.

          Narcissa continues to ascend as she replies.

                                        NARCISSA
                        I know all the dark places...
                        the black gulfs, the shadows, the
                        hidden doors... the dark is my
                        friend, child... I am not afraid...                                                                                        15.


  25ANGLE ON NARCISSA25

        Her groping hand reaches up and touches the sack parace1sus
        carries. Her smile vanishes; she looks concerned, confused.
        Her fingers fumble against the sack, and we see that the white
        canvas is spotted with BLOOD from whatever is carried within.


                                      NARCISSA
                              (feeling bag)
                        Vincent... what do you...
                                (snatches back her hand
                                in sudden fear)
                      ... blood... what is it?


  26ANGLE UPON PARACELSUS26

        as he descends a step, his look implacable. The charade is
        over now and he speaks with his own voice.

                                      PARACELSUS
                      Only a face... and a candle, to
                      light my way in the dark.


  27RESUME SCENE27
~
          Narcissa's hand touches Paracelsus and she pulls it back as
        if burned.
                                      NARCISSA
                              (afraid)
                      No... you are not Vincent.You
                      are the evil one.

                                      PARACELSUS
                      Down here there is no good and
                      evil. Only strong and weak.

        Narcissa stumbles away from him, down the steps. In
        her haste and fear she almost falls.

                                      PARACELSUS
                      Have a care... the steps are
                      slick. Let me light your way.

      He pokes his torch at her, setting her ragged clothing AFIRE.
        Narcissa SCREAMS, drops her basket, tries to beat at the
        flames with her hands, but they spread too fast. She goes
        stumbling down the stairs as the fire envelopes her.
        Paracelsus comes after, and when the old woman goes to her
        knees, he puts a booted heel on her back and KICKS her out
        over the edge.                                                                                          16.


    28CLOSE ON PARACELSUS28

          as he watches her fall, down and down, into the mist--
            shrouded depths of the great well. His face is almost
            expressionless. The sounds of Narcissa's SCREAMS dwindle
            slowly, until we hear a distant SPLASH far below.

                                        PARACELSUS
                        There are no friends in the darkness,
                        old woman. In the dark, all men are
                          enemies.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


    29INT. DA'S OFFICE. DAY29

          JOE MAXWELL stands by the coffee machine, wearing a heavy
          winter coat with a fur collar over his suit. He warms his
          hands over the pot briefly, then pours himself a cup.
          Everyone in the coffee behind him wears coats, heavy
            sweaters, earmuffs, ski masks, etc. The windows are obscured
          by frost. In b.g., two plumbers in overalls are dismantling
          one of the radiators. Cathy comes sailing up behind Joe as he
          tastes the coffee.

                                        CATHY
                          Joe, I got a problem...

          From the brusque way Joe holds up his hand, it's clear
          people have been bitching at him all day.

                                        JOE
                          I don't want to hear it, Radcliffe!
                        The city says we'll have heat
                          tomorrow, Wednesday for sure.
                          There's nothing I can do
                        about it. I'm a lawyer, not a
                          plumber.

                                        CATHY
                          It's not about the heat.  I
                          need to take Thursday off.

                                        JOE

                        No way.

          Coffee in hand, Maxwell starts back to his office. Cathy
          follows, pleading her case, and we TRACK with them.

                                        CATHY
                          I wouldn't ask if it wasn't
                          important.

                                                                      (CONTINUED)                                                                                        17.

                                      JOE
                        I can't spare you. Half the office
                        is out with flu already.

                                      CATHY
                        It's only one day. I'll work late on
                        Wednesday. I'll come in early on
                        Friday.

        They enter Joe's office as the conversation continues. As he
          replies, Joe retreats behind his desk and begins to flip
          pages on his calendar.

                                      JOE
                        You'll work late on Wednesday,
                        come in early on Friday, and
                        you'll be here...

                        Escobar? She barely knows where we
                        keep the paper clips!

                        She'll do fine.

  30INT. TAMARA'S LAIR. NIGHT30

          Paracelsus studies the grotesque lifemasks that decorate
          Tamara's walls. Some of the faces are barely human; others
        should suggest the faces of some of our tunnel denizens,
          twisted cruelly in the dark funhouse of Tamara's mind. In
        b.g., Tamara is grinding the materials she needs for his mask
        with a stone mortar and pestal.

          Paracelsus passes masks that resemble the faces of Mouse,
          Winslow, and Pascal, and pauses before one that suggests
          Father, its features twisted grotesquely, as if in great pain.
        He reaches up to finger it thoughtfully.

                                        PARACELSUS
                        Alas, dear Jacob. I knew him well,
                        Tamara. A fellow of infinite
                        jest, of most excellent fancy.

        This sardonic soliloquy is interrupted as a man enters the
          chamber. VULCAN is squat and broad, with a huge black beard,
          a massive chest, and thick, muscular arms, but he moves
        slowly and awkwardly on two short, twisted legs. An
          ironsmith's hammer is thrust through his belt.

                                      VULCAN
                        It's done.

                                        PARACELSUS
                        Just as I described it?

        Vulcan NODS. In b.g., Tamara sets aside her mortar and
          pestal, wipes the sweat off her brow.

                                      TAMARA
                              (to Paracelsus)
                      We can begin.

          Paracelsus seats himself in a stone chair close to Tamara. As
        she washes the grime off her hands and dries them on a rag,
          Paracelsus gestures to Vulcan.

                                        PARACELSUS
                        Bring it here. Show me.


  31ANGLE ON VULCAN-

        He comes forward on his stunted legs, kneels, and offers for
          inspection a BLACK LACQUER BOX with a SILVER ROSE inlaid on
        the top, identical in every respect to the box in which
        Father keeps his chessmen.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                      19.

                                      PARACELSUS
                      Yes... excellent...
                              (beat, musing)
                      It was thirty-five years ago I gave
                      Jacob his chessmen... a token of my
                        affection... of our friendship...
                      yes, this will do... and the rest?



32CLOSE ON THE BOX32

      as Vulcan flips open the lid. Inside this box are no chess
        pieces snug in their niches, but rather the makings of a crude
        but very powerful EXPLOSIVE DEVICE.


  33RESUME PARACELSUS33

        Seated in the chair, he examines the bomb carefully, eyes
        studying every aspect of it. Vulcan looks more and more
        nervous, frightened of the consequences should his work
        displease the alchemist.

                                      PARACELSUS
                      And the arming device?

                                      VULCAN
                      On the lid.  Press the rose. The
                      next time the box is opened...

                                      PARACELSUS
                      Checkmate.
                              (beat)
                      You may go.

        Vulcan lays the box at the alchemist's feet, and exits the
        chamber. Tamara steps up behind Paracelsus.

                                      TAMARA
                      I must remove the mask.

                                      PARACELSUS
                      Of course.

      Very carefully, she reaches around, and removes the beaten
      gold mask. Beneath, the skin is scarred and twisted, hideously
        burned, awful to look upon. Tamara runs her fingers across it
        lightly.

  3434INT. DRAINAGE TUNNEL. MORNING

        as Catherine makes her way in slowly from Central Park.
          There's water in the tunnel from melting snow. She carries her
          candle. As she gets further down the tunnel, she HEARS the
        soft, sweet sound of a SAXOPHONE coming out of the junction. A
        smile touches her face.


  3535INT. JUNCTION - DAY

        CLARENCE, the black street musician established in  Siege," is
        playing his horn to three other helpers as they wait for their
        guide in the junction. Benny and Lou are there in their party
        finest; Sebastian the magician still wears his faded tux and
        top hat.

        Catherine ENTERS from the tunnel, exchanges SMILES with Benny.
        She and the others listen as Clarence finishes; when he puts
        aside his horn, all applaud. Clarence grins broadly. Finally
        Sebastien turns to Cathy.

                                      SEBASTIEN
                      The infamous Catherine Chandler, I
                        presume? Your fame precedes you,
                      dear lady.
                              (kisses her hand)
                        I must say, you are even lovelier
                      than I was told. Permit me to make
                      the introductions...

                        gods...

        Benny gives Cathy a look as Sebastien goes on.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                          21.

            Sebastien takes that smoothy in stride, produces a bouquet of
          tattered silk flowers from his sleeve, presents it to
            Catherine.

                          We're just the one group. A guide
                          will take us down to where we meet up
                          with the others...

                          Sounds like this is all old hat to
                          you, Benny.

                          My mother was a helper before me. I
                          was still riding a trike the first
                          time I went down...

          The sliding door behind them begins to OPEN. All eyes move
          to the secret entrance as Vincent steps forward, and holds
          open the grate. He gestures the helpers through, looking
          at Cathy across the junction. As Sebastien moves to the gate,
          peers through, and scowls, Cathy and Vincent remain lost in
          each other's eyes.

                                          SEBASTIEN
                          Nothing lurking in there, I hope?

                          All clear. Let us proceed.

            Sebastien steps through daintily; the others follow,
            Catherine last of all. Vincent gently helps her across the
            threshold; they exchange smiles.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. CHAMBER OF THE WINDS (MATTE) - DAY

          The great stone stairway in the Chamber of the Winds is
          crowded as we have never seen it, as a long line of people make
          their way downward. Vincent and Cathy and their little group of
          helpers are in their midst, surrounded by a mixed group of
            subterraneans and helpers. A few of the travellers carry
          lanterns and flickering torches, and there is a winterfest
          candle (NOTE: the candles are NOT lit) in every hand. The wind
          howls through the chamber, whipping at clothing and hair, but
          the spirits are high, there is loud talk, joking, children
          running up and down the stairs, etc.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:                                                                                          23.


    37 INT. OUTSIDE TALL DOORS37

          Vincent leads Catherine through the crowd of tunnel dwellers
          who have gathered together at the foot of the stairs, in front
          of a set of towering WOODEN DOORS, twice the height of a man.
            A massive wooden beam holds the doors shut against the force
          of the wind.

          Vincent looks at Father, who stands beneath the doors, leaning
          heavily on his cane. Father NODS. Vincent moves to the doors,
          and lifts the heavy wooden beam, setting it aside. He pushes,
          and the doors CREAK open slowly, revealing an echoing expanse
          of DARKNESS. When the doors are open, it creates a kind of
            wind-tunnel effect, and the velocity of the wind seems to
          INCREASE sharply, as it goes howling down the tunnel. No one
          moves until Vincent turns back to Catherine.



    38ANGLE ON VINCENT AND CATHY38

          Cathy SHIVERS as the wind shrieks around her.

                                        VINCENT
                        Will you trust me to lead you
                        through the dark?

                                        CATHY
                        There is no darkness, Vincent...
                        when you're with me.

          Side by side, they walk through the doors into the room
          beyond, their figures vanishing into blackness. Father
          follows, after a beat. The rest of the tunnel dwellers
          crowd after him.

                                                                    FADE OUT:

          FADE IN:

    39CLOSE ON FATHER39

          He sits at the head of a table, a winterfest candle burning in
          front of him. Otherwise the scene is COMPLETELY DARK. Father's
          face, eerily lit by the flame of the single candle, seems to
          float in a vast sea of darkness as he begins to speak.


                                        FATHER
                        The world above us is cold and
                        gray, summer a distant memory.
                        Our world too has known its
                          winters. So each year we begin
                        this feast in darkness, as our
                        world began in darkness.

          We PULL BACK VERY SLOWLY from Father to take in the table
          in front of him. Dimly we see the shadowy forms of Vincent,
          seated on his right, and Mary, on his left. As one, they
          TOUCH their winterfest candles in the flame of Father's,
          until the wicks catch. Now three candles are lit. Vincent and
          Mary carry on the story, their speeches CONTINUOUS, familiar
          words of an oral tradition.

                                        VINCENT
                        Long before the city above us raised
                        its towers to the sky, men sought
                        shelter in these caverns.

                                        MARY
                        In those days, these tunnels were
                        dark places, and those who dwelt
                        here dwelt in fear and isolation.

                                                                      (CONTINUED)                                                                                          25.

                          This was a land of lost hope and
                          twisted dreams, a land of despair
                          where the sound of footsteps coming
                          down a tunnel was a sound of terror,
                          and men reached for knives and rocks
                          and worse at the sound of another's
                          man voice.

                          But at last a few people learned to
                          put aside their fear.

                                        MARY
                          We began to trust each other, to
                          help each other.

                                        VINCENT
                          And all of us grew stronger, those
                          who took the help and those who gave
                          it.

                                        FATHER
                        We are all part of one another.
                          One family, one community.
                          Sometimes we forget that. And
                        so each year we meet here. To
                          thank those who have helped us,
                          and to remember... even the
                          greatest darkness is nothing, so
                          long as we share the light.

          Vincent turns from Father to Catherine, seated beside him, and
            LIGHTS HER CANDLE from his own. Simultaneously, on the opposite
          side of the table, Mary lights Pascal's candle from hers. We
          TRACK BACK ALONG the length of the table. Catherine gives her
          flame to Mouse, Mouse to Jamie, Jamie to the person beside her.
            Across the table, in unison, Pascal is lighting Sarah's candle,
          and then Sarah William's. On and on it goes, two long parallel
          streams of light, as candle is lit from candle all along the
            length of what we now see is a LONG WOODEN TABLE (seating 20-
          30) covered with fine glass, glittering silver, etc. With each
          new candle, the hall grows brighter. After he has passed on his
            light, Vincent leans across the table to light one of the
          splendid candelabras. Others bring their flames to the tables
          to the right and left of Father's, or touch off the torches in
          their wall sconces, the candles snug in small niches. We
          continue to PULL BACK and finally


                                                                      MATCH DISSOLVE TO:                                                                                      26.


40INT. GREAT HALL. TWO HOURS LATER40

      Now BRILLIANTLY LIT by a myriad of candles, torches,
        lanterns, and BUSTLING with activity. The chamber is
        cavernous and high-ceilinged, hewn long ago out of solid
        stone. The great double doors through which the tunnel
        dwellers entered stand at the far end of the hall, but there
        a half-dozen other arched entryways along the walls, leading
      off to side tunnels rather than the chamber of the
      winds. An upper gallery circles the hall, supported by
      a series of pillars. Above, the walls are covered by a series
      of magnificent old TAPESTRIES, their colors faded now,
        perhaps fraying a bit at the edges, but still obviously
      things of beauty and great antiquity, depicting a variety of
      medieval scenes (castles, dragons, hunting, etc). The entire
      tunnel community has assembled at three long tables that run
      down the center of the hall, helpers seated side by side with
        subterraneans.

        A sumptuous FEAST has been served. Most of the guests have
      finished eating; a few are still busy with their food.
      We HEAR the clatter of silverware, the sounds of LAUGHTER,
      the buzz of conversation. Some of the guests are moving about
      to visit with other friends. A FIDDLER from below and BANJO
      PLAYER helper begin a spritely duet.


41ANGLE PAST MOUSE ON JAMIE41

      Mouse is all insatiable curiosity, trying to listen to a
      dozen conversations at once, while Jamie pokes at food in a
        desultory manner. Finally Mouse notices, frowns.

                                    MOUSE
                    No smile. Something's wrong?

                                    JAMIE
                      It's nothing...

                                    MOUSE
                    More than nothing. Almost
                      something.
                              (points at plate)
                      Hardly ate.

              Jamie pushes away her food, slumps back in her

        chair.JAMIE

                      I just... keep thinking of
                      Winslow. This is the first time
                    that he hasn't been here. It
                      doesn't feel right...
                              (tearful)
                      I miss him, Mouse. He ought to be
                      here...

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                                        27.


    41CONTINUED:41

        Mouse thinks about that, and for a long beat he looks
        solemn too. Then he looks around, up and down the room,
          listens to all the sounds of fellowship, and finally he
        turns back to Jamie.

                                      MOUSE
                      Not missing. Look. Listen.
                        Everybody laughing, talking,
                        making noise. Eating.
                                (beat, simply)
                        Winslow's here. Must be, right?

        Jamie blinks back her tears, considers this. Finally a slow
        tremulous smile breaks across her face. She gives him a little
        hug, and Mouse GRINS hugely.

                                                                  CUT TO:


  42KIPPER AND ERIC42

        lying on the floor in a back corner of the Great Hall,
          playing a game of checkers. Eric executes a triple jump,
        removing Kipper's last pieces from the board.

                                      KIPPER
                      This is a stupid game.I'm going
                      to get some cake.

        Kipper jumps up and runs off. Eric shrugs, and returns the
        checkers and board to a low shelf carved from the stone wall.
        The shelf also holds a set of a darts, a Go board, and the
        familiar black lacquer box.

        As Eric leaves, we HOLD on the shelf. After a long beat, an
        ominous SHADOW falls across the games. A HAND ENTERS FRAME,
        picks up Father's chess set, lays the substitute in its place.
        Nothing about the hand or sleeve should tell us who it belongs
        to. We begin to MOVE IN on the box.

        A long finger delicately touches the silver rose inlaid
        in the lid, then presses down on it. The inlay DEPRESSES
        slightly, with a small, sharp CLICK, then pops back into place
        when the finger lifts off it. As the shadow moves steathily
        away, we HOLD for a long beat on the box.
                                                                  CUT TO:

        Catherine the tapestries.

                      Vincent, they're wonderful...
                      but where did they come from?
                      Who was the artist?

                                    VINCENT
                      Those are mysteries we've never
                      solved, Catherine. Perhaps they're
                        enchanted...
                              (beat, fondly)
                      I used to imagine they were magic
                      windows... that if I looked at
                     them long enough and hard enough,
                      they might open for me, so I could
                      pass through to a different world.
                      But when I reached out...

      He reaches out now, his hand gently touching the tapestry
      and the wall behind it.

                                    VINCENT
                              (continuous, sadly)
                      ... it was only cloth.

      From the look on Catherine's face, we know she understands
      his yearnings.

                                    CATHY
                      Someday I'd love to show you the
                      tapestries in the Cloisters. My
                      father took me there...

      They wander off further down toward the next tapestry.


44RESUME GREAT HALL44

      TRACKING with Father and Mary as they cross the hall
      together, talking. She's worried, he reassuring.

                                    MARY
                      I know she seldom comes to
                      winterfest, but it's been so long

                        indestructible... but if it
                    will help you rest easier, we'll

        They reach the corner where the games have been placed.
        Father looks over the shelf, picks up the chess set.

                                      FATHER

  45WINE CASKS45

        Two large oak casks set up under the galleries. William is
          drawing wine from a spigot. Nearby, Sebastien is sipping the
        vintage, while holding forth to Jamie, Lou the barber, and a
        few others.

                                      JAMIE
                      If you really are the greatest
                        magician in the world, how come
                      you do your tricks on subways?

                                      LOU
                              (laughs)

                      Those are only token appearances.

        When that provokes wincing all around, Sebastien clears his
        throat, and continues with a shrug.

                                      SEBASTIEN
                      I love the subways. And the
                        streets... what Broadway stage can
                        compare to a New York street? I see
                      it all... the men rushing off to
                      work, the children at their play, the
                      girls in their summer dresses...
                        everyone needs a little magic...
                                (smiling, he produces
                                a wand, sprinkles Jamie
                              with stardust)
                      ... and Sebastien is there to give it
                      to them.


        As Jamie laughs, Mouse appears in b.g., moving furtively
        across the room with a plate of food. The camera follows,
        leaving the group by the wine casks and TRACKING WITH MOUSE.
        He ducks into a small CURTAINED ALCOVE to kneel by ARTHUR, his
        pet raccoon.

                      weird.

      Mouse gives Arthur the plate of scraps.

        Pascal is making his way along one of the upper tunnels,
      close to his pipe chamber. PIPES large and small run along
      the ceiling and walls, but there is no tapping, only SILENCE.
      Yet suddenly Pascal stops, frowns as if puzzled. Still we hear
        nothing. He moves to the wall, slides out his rods, BANGS on
      one pipe, waits, listens. Nothing. Still dissatisfied, he
        begins to clamber over the pipes, trying to reach the highest
      one, the old pipe that runs along the ceiling. He climbs from
      pipe to pipe like a child on a jungle gym. Finally, hanging
        upside down, he takes his STETHOSCOPE out of his pocket and
        presses it to the ceiling pipe. For the first time we HEAR a
        sound; very faint and far-away, a barely audible metallic
        SCRATCHING. Pascal concentrates harder as we

      The remains of the feast have been cleared away. In b.g., a
      group of musicians are setting up to perform, while others
      shift the tables to the side of the chamber to make room for
      dancing, games, what have you. Father, the chess set tucked
      under his arm, is having an animated conversation with Dr.
        Alcott. Mouse listens.

                        Those journals you gave me have
                      been fascinating, Peter. Some of
                      the results they've been getting
                      with laser surgery...

        The musicians are playing a lovely WALTZ. In b.g., a few
          dancers whirl across the floor. Catherine and Vincent are
        listening to the music, rapt. Father, the innocent-seeming

          few HUSHED WHISPERS and we PUSH THROUGH the crowd to Vincent as
          he enters through one of the side tunnels (NOTE: not through
          the tall wooden doors, which remain closed). He is carrying
          Narcissa in her arms; she lies unconscious, horribly burned,
          very badly hurt. Pascal walks a few steps behind him. A SHOCKED
          SILENCE prevails as Vincent makes his way across the room.


          Father is the first to snap out of it. He rises and rushes
          forward.

                                                                     (CONTINUED)                                                                                          39.

                                        FATHER
                        Lay her on one of the tables.
                        Clear a space... Kipper, fetch
                        me my bag. Quickly now!

          As Kipper runs off, Mouse sweeps a tabletop clear of party
          debris, and Vincent gently lays down Narcissa. Father begins
          to examine her.

                                        FATHER
                        Where did you find her?

                                        VINCENT
                        Down in the shattered rooms, below
                        the stone circle... she must have
                        crawled there...

                                        FATHER
                        Pulse is weak... she's
                          dehydrated... my god, these
                          burns... we have to get her up
                        to the hospital chamber,
                          quickly...

            Suddenly, to everyone's shock and dismay, Narcissa begins to
          struggle hysterically against Father. She knocks him away,
          sits up, and SCREAMS.


    59CLOSE ON NARCISSA59

          as her strange half-blind eyes sweep the chamber, she
          shouts out a warning to no one and everyone.

                                        NARCISSA
                        The evil one... is here!

        FADE IN:

60INT. HOSPITAL CHAMBER. LATER60

        Vincent and Cathy watch with concern as Father treats
        Narcissa, who now lies, still and unmoving, on a bed in the
        hospital chamber. Mary is assisting Father while Dr. Alcott,
      in b.g., prepares a hypodermic.

                                      FATHER
                      We have to get some fluid into
                      her... Mary, bring me an IV...

        Narcissa MOANS, and stirs feebly.

                      Vincent...

        Vincent moves forward, takes Narcissa's hand, clasps it.

                                      VINCENT
                      I'm here, Narcissa.

        She seems to draw strength from his very presence.

                                      NARCISSA
                      Vincent... beware...

                              (leaning close)
                    The silver rose... what do you
                    mean?

                                      NARCISSA
                      The poison rose...

      The old woman suddenly GASPS. All the tension goes out of
      her, her eyes close, and she settles back into sleep.                                                                                        41.

                        There... that's better...


  62RESUME62

        as Vincent angrily grabs the doctor by his wrist.

                                      VINCENT
                      What did you give her?

                                      DR. ALCOTT
                                (innocently)
                      Something for the pain... to help
                      her sleep...

                                      FATHER
                        Vincent, honestly, what's gotten
                      into you? Peter, I need a hand
                        here...

        Vincent releases Dr. Alcott, and turns to look at Cathy.
        OFF their worried faces we .

                                                                    DISSOLVE TO:


63INT. GREAT BALL. LATER THAT EVENING63

        Puddles of wax surround the candles now.There is no
        music, no laughter. The mood is somber.

                                      SARAH
                        Narcissa never went above. How
                      could this happen?

                                      JAMIE
                      The evil one, she said.


64ANGLE PAST MOUSE64

        sitting, legs folded under him, beside the table where
        Father abandoned his chess game. The black lacquer BOX is
        close at hand.

                                      MOUSE
                      Sounds bad.                                                                                          42.


    65 RESUME65
          SCENE:.
            INTERCUTTING with shots of Mouse as he idly drums his
          fingers on the top of the box, listening to the others.

                                        BENNY
                        The evil one... who's that
                          supposed to be?

          people shift uncomfortably; Benny doesn't get it.

                                        JAMIE:
                        We all know who she meant...

                                        SARAH
                                  (frightened)
                          Paracelsus...

                                        MOUSE
                        Worse than bad.

          Mouse toys with the latch on the box, just fiddling.

                                        JAMIE
                        She said he was here.

                                        MOUSE:
                        Worse than worse.

          He SLAPS his hand on top of the chess set for emphasis.

                                        SEBASTIEN
                        Ah, but did she mean here?
                                (flashes a silver--
                                  dollar, palms it)
                        Or here?

          He reaches over, pulls the coin from behind Jamie's ear.
          Jamie is not amused, and SWIPES his hand away roughly.

                                        JAMIE
                        Cut it out, Sebastien...

                        I know what the man's saying. Did
                        she mean here in New York, here in
                        the tunnels, or here in this room?


                                        SARAH
                        well, she can't have meant he was
                        here at the winterfest.
                                        (weakly)
                        Can she?

                                                                      (CONTINUED)                                                                                        43.


    65CONTINUED:65


        The guests look at each other nervously.

                              BENNY
                        Hey, this is crazy. The old lady
                        was delirious...

                                      LOU
                        Yeah. Just some kind of
                        nightmare, if you ask me. Like
                      one of your fever dreams...

        Many of the helpers, from the sunlit pragmatical world
        topside, MUTTER in agreement, until VINCENT'S VOICE, sudden
        and unexpected, quiets them all.

                                      VINCENT (O.S.)
                        Perhaps she dreamt that she was
                        burned and broken and left to
                        die... but if so, we share her
                        nightmare...


  66ANGLE ON VINCENT 66

        He stands one of the arched entryways to a side tunnel.
        Cathy is with him, Father and Dr. Alcott just behind. The
        guests regard them anxiously.

                                      SARAH
                        Narcissa... is she...?

                                      FATHER
                        She's... resting comfortably. Mary is
                        sitting with her, we'll have to take
                        shifts... until she's stabilized...


                                      VINCENT
                      Her spirit is strong... she will
                      not die...

                                      DR. ALCOTT
                      What they're trying to say is that
                      we think she's going to make it.

        There is general RELIEF all around the hall. Father,
        exhausted by the strain, sits heavily in his chair.

                          A good illusion makes you think
                          you see something that's not
                          really there... perhaps one of
                          these friendly faces is but a
                          passing mirage, a chimera...

            Sebastien begins to move around the room, lightly touching
          the faces of those he passes.

                                        WILLIAM
                          What the hell kind of game you trying
                        to play, scaring everybody?

                                        JAMIE
                                (to William)
                          Let him go! What are you afraid of?
                          Maybe you're the one...

                                        WILLIAM
                          Paracelsus is supposed to be some
                        kind of magic man, right? Well, the
                        only magician I see is right here. .


          William SHOVES Sebastien away roughly, and the elderly
          magician stumbles back a few steps. Everyone starts TALKING
          AT ONCE, some in support of William, others for Sebastien,
          until Father's voice cuts through the din.

                                        FATHER
                        Stop it. Have you all gone mad?
                                (Quiet falls)
                          Winterfest is a time of
                          brotherhood... of joy and trust. If
                        we forget that... if we allow this
                        day of all days to be tainted by
                        fear... then Paracelsus will truly
                        have won!

          Everyone looks abashed.Sebastien manages a smile.

                                                                      (CONTINUED)                                                                                      46.

                                      SEBASTIEN
                      Right you are. William, dear boy, my
                        apologies...

      He offers his hand.William hestitates, then takes it.

                                    WILLIAM
                    I'm the one who ought to
                      apologize...
                              (awkwardly, to all)
                      Look, there's more wine, and a
                    cake or two that's hardly been
                      touched. Maybe we can just...

                                    FATHER
                    An excellent idea!

      Some of the tension seems to dissolve. The fiddler begins to
      play again, a slow sad tune. The guests begin breaking
      up into small clusters of conversation, etc. The mood is
      much more subdued than it was earlier; these people are
      shaken, trying to carry on gamely and reaffirm their
      fellowship despite everything, and it shows. But Vincent
      stills seems TROUBLED.


68ANGLE ON CATHY AND VINCENT 68

      as they draw a little apart from the others, and talk quietly
      in a corner of the Great Ball. Vincent looks out over the
      guest, his concern plain on his face.

                                    CATHY
                            (very quietly)
                    You think he's here, don't you?

                                    VINCENT
                    My mind says it cannot be... but
                    some small voice deep inside me
                      whispers yes...

                                    CATHY
                      I feel it too...

                                    VINCENT
                    It makes no sense... how could he
                    hope to bring off such a
                      masquerade? There are no
                      strangers at winterfest...

                                    CATHY
                              (thoughtful)
                    What about the helpers?

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                                          47.


    68CONTINUED:68

                                                  VINCENT
                          The helpers are part of us...
                          friends...

                                        CATHY
                          Sometimes we drift away from
                          friends, lose track of them for a
                          little while... and when we see them
                          again, if they seem changed, we
                        don't think twice about it.

          Vincent weighs Catherine's words. They make sense; it would be
          much easier for an enemy to pass as a helper than as one of
          the tunnel dwellers.

                                        VINCENT
                        Most of those who were helpers
                          thirty years ago are gone now.
                          Paracelsus could not know the
                          others...

                                        CATHY
                          Surely there must be a few...
                        those who were helpers from the
                        very beginning, who knew
                          Paracelsus when he was part of
                        your world...

          Vincent thinks about the question, and finally gives a
          small, reluctant NOD.

                                        VINCENT
                        Only three...

          The barber is joking with William by the wine casks.

          The magician is seated beside Mouse, running through a few
          simple card tricks.

                                        CATHY
                        There must be some way to know
                        for sure...                                                                                          48.

    70MOUSE AND SEBASTIEN70

          The lacquer box is visible in b.g. as Mouse studies three
          cards that Sebastien has spread in front of him.

                                        SEBASTIEN
                        Nothing could be simpler, boy.
                        Just find the red queen.

                                      MOUSE
                        This one.

          Sebastien turns over the card Mouse is pointing to, and
          uncovers the ace of spades.

                                        SEBASTIEN
                        Pity about that...

        As Sebastien is about to reshuffle, Vincent flips over the
          other two cards. They're both the aces of spades as well.
          Sebastien smiles and shrugs sheepishly. In b.g., Kipper and
        Eric grab the black box, sit down to play. Vincent SEES THEM
        and REACTS.                                                                                        49.

73LOU. A SHORT TIME LATER73

        Lou is standing with William by the wine casks as Cathy

~approaches with the box. Vincent is with her.

                                      CATHY
                      Lou... I thought you might want to
                      have a game of chess...

        Lou looks at Cathy, at the box, smiles, shrugs.

                                      LOU
                      Try Father, he's your chess player.
                      Me, I wouldn't know a castle from a
                      horse. Now if you want to get up a
                      game of five card stud...


                                      CATHY
                        Father's out of my league.I'll
                      teach you the moves...

        She presses the box toward him.Lou backs away.

                                    LOU
                      Nah, I'll pass.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                        so.


    73CONTINUED:73

        INTERCUT between their eyes; hers suspicious, his narrowed and
        cold. They hold the look for a long beat, then Catherine walks
        several paces away. But as Lou starts to go back to his
          conversation, she TURNS.

                                      CATHY
                      Lou!..

        And she THROWS the black box at Lou.


74CLOSE ON LOU74

        The terror is plain on his face as he WHIRLS AWAY from the
        bomb, throws up his arms to protect himself.

        The box STRIKES HIM and OPENS, scattering chess pieces all
        over the floor.


75PULL BACK75

      to reveal that Lou alone is crouched in a defensive posture,
        caught in the act of diving for cover. All eyes are on the
        barber. A HUSH falls over the Great Hall. Mouse comes
        forward to stand beside Vincent, the second black box in his
        hands.

                                      MOUSE
                      Yours?

      He flips open the lid suddenly: Lou can't help but FLINCH.

                                    MOUSE
                      Disarmed it.

                                    VINCENT
                      We found Father's set in the
                      tunnel outside... where you hid
                      it.

      Lou RISES from his crouch, and makes a sudden DART for the
        nearest exit, but William grabs him. They grapple: then, with
        a CLICK, a footlong razor-sharp BLADE springs out of the
        barber's sleeve. He SLASHES William across the stomach. The
      big man SCREAMS and goes to his knees.

     Vincent LEAPS OVER William, ROARING, striking out at Lou as
      he backpedals, and RAKING him across the face.                                                                                          51.


    76ON LOU76

          as Vincent's claws TEAR AWAY half the mask, revealing the
            twisted, burn-scarred features of Paracelsus beneath. He
            reels backwards: He SLASHES OUT as people come at him from
            all sides, SEIZES Eric when the boy comes too close.

                                        LOU
                                        (Paracelsus' voice)
                          One step closer and the child
                          dies.

          He holds his blade across Eric's throat, backing away
            slowly. Vincent GROWLS in angry frustration. With his free
            hand, Paracelsus rips off the torn mask and casts it
              contemptuously aside.

                                        PARACELSUS
                          The hour of unmasking is at hand,
                        it would seem...

            Father has been tending to William's wound. He rises..

                                        FATHER
                          John...


~PARACELSUS
                          Paracelsus... John is dead...
                          killed by you, Jacob...

            Paracelsus is backing away toward the tall double doors
          while the tunnel dwellers move toward him. Hands grasp
          chairs, candelabras, anything that can pass for a weapon.

                                        CATHY
                          Let the boy go!

                                        PARACELSUS
                        So your dear Vincent can rend me
                          limb from limb? I think not.
                          Regretfully, it would seem I need a
                          hostage...

                                        FATHER
                          Then take me...

          Father moves forward slowly, leaning heavily on his cane.
          Vincent GRASPS him by the arm and tries to stop him.

                                        VINCENT.

                          Father, no...

          But Father gently removes Vincent's hand.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                      52.

                                      FATHER
                      I must...
                              (to Paracelsus)
                      I'm the one you want, John, not
                      the boy. We both know that.

        Various voices CRY OUT in concern. Father moves very close to
        Paracelsus. INTERCUT between their faces. The alchemist
        hesitates, then SHOVES Eric away. The boy, SOBBING with
        relief, runs to Catherine, who comforts him.

                                      FATHER
                      What happened to you, John?You
                      were a good man once... my
                      friend.

                                      PARACELSUS
                      Spare me the homilies, Jacob. These
                      poor deluded fools may not know
                      what happened, but you and I, we
                      remember... don't we?


77CLOSE ON FATHER77

~
      as Paracelsus SHOVES the point of his blade right up under
        Father's chin, forcing his head back.

                                      FATHER
                      We remember... differently...
                      John...


78CLOSE ON PARACELSUS78

      He stares into Father's eyes, his arm TREMBLING, the blade
        poised at Father's throat. Vincent, Catherine, and the others
      are too far away to help; Father's life hangs in the balance
      for what seems an eternity.


79ANGLE PAST SEBASTIEN 79

      as the old street magician suddenly raises an arm, and FLINGS
      one of his flash paper FIREBALLS at Paracelsus.

      The alchemist staggers back, blinded for a second, and Vincent
      takes advantage of the distraction to pull Father safely out
      of harm's way. Then he turns back to face Paracelsus... and
      the alchemist THROWS OPEN the great wooden doors. The WIND
      comes howling into the Great Hall with awful, almost
        supernatural force. Father is buffeted backwards, falls.
        Vincent wraps Catherine in the shelter of his cloak. Nearby
        candles are BLOWN OUT.                                                                                        53.


  8080LONG SHOT. THE GREAT HALL

        All up and down the length of the Great Hall, the wind
        ROARS. The candles and torches are EXTINGUISHED by the
        terrible force of the wind, and darkness seems to sweep
        into the hall like a living thing.

                                                                    DISSOLVE TO:


  8181INT. HOSPITAL CHAMBER. LATER

        Father, assisted by Dr. Alcott, has bandaged William's stomach
        wound. Catherine, Mary, Sebastien, and others look on
        anxiously. All look up when the search party that has
        been hunting for Paracelsus returns, headed by Vincent. Pascal,
        Jamie, Mouse, and others follow.

                                      CATHY
                      Did you find him?

                                      VINCENT
                        There's no sign... he's melted
                      away like a shadow...

                                      FATHER
                        A shadow that will fall over our
,world again... unless we find him,
~
                      and stop him...

                                      VINCENT
                      You took a great risk, Father.
                        Paracelsus might have killed
                        you... yet he let the moment
                        pass...

                                      FATHER
                        Believe me, I was as surprised as
                        anyone... not that I'm complaining,
                      mind you... perhaps he feared for
                      his own life...
                              (trails off, thoughtful)

                                      VINCENT
                        There's something else...

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                        54.

                                      FATHER
                      In his eyes... I saw such anger
                        there... such hatred... but... just
                      for an instant, mind you...
                      I thought I saw a bit of... of
                        sadness as well... as if John was
                        remembering... well...
                              (brisk)
                        Probably I just imagined it. At any
                      rate, Catherine was the real hero...
                      how could you possibly have known it
                      was Lou? .

                                      CATHY
                      I ruled out Peter when he told that
                        embarrassing story of his... there
                      was no way Paracelsus could know
                      that Peter delivered me.

                                      VINCENT
                      And Sebastien had been after
                      Father all day to play chess.

                                      CATHY
                    The last place Paracelsus wanted to
                    be when that box was opened was
                      across the chessboard... that left
                    Lou.

                                      FATHER
                      However you did it, we are deeply
                      grateful, dear Catherine...

        Everyone NODS. Then a quiet falls. Tunnel dwellers and helpers
      look at each other awkwardly, shuffle their feet. There's no
      more to say; no one feels very festive any more.

                                      SEBASTIEN
                      The rest is silence...

                                    PASCAL
                      Well... I better get back to the
                      pipes.

                                    MARY
                      I need to check on Narcissa...

                                    BENNY
                      We'll need a guide back up...

      Everyone begins to STIR, get to their feet, excuse
        themselves, start toward the door... but Vincent's voice
      stops the exodus.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                                        55.

                                      VINCENT
                      Is this how we want winterfest
                      to end? Each of us slinking away to
                      nurse our wounds, each alone... have
                      we forgotten what this day means?


        His words strike home. Sheepish looks are exchanged.
        Vincent extends a hand to Mouse, who stands beside him,
        eyes downcast. Mouse raises his eyes, smiles.

                                      MOUSE
                      Okay good! Okay fine!

        He reaches up, GRABS Vincent's hand hard, then gives his other
        hand to Jamie. She smiles, and her free hand reachs for
          Sebastien, beside her.


82PAN AROUND THE CHAMBER82

        as one by one, tunnel dwellers and helpers link hands, joining
        together once again... from hand to hand to hand, until Mary
        takes Father's hand, and the circle is complete, except for

~Catherine.

83ANGLE ON FATHER83

        as he smiles and reaches out a hand.

                                      FATHER
                        Catherine... you're a part of us
                        now...a helper... come, complete
                      the circle...

        Deeply moved, Catherine takes Father's hand, then LOOKS OVER
        to Vincent. We MOVE IN TIGHT as their hands come together,
        completing the circle, and binding the community together
        again for another year.

                                                                  DISSOLVE TO:


84INT. GREAT BALL - NIGHT84

        The candles are out, the torches extinguished. The Great Hall
      is wrapped in darkness again for another year. Vincent and
        Catherine stand alone in the center of the chamber. They've
        brought a lantern, which Vincent has set on the floor. Its
        light CASTS THEIR SHADOWS behind them on the wall, taller than
        life.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                        56.

                        Only the quiet... and the wind
                        outside, crying to come in...

                                      CATHY
                        Listen! You can hear it if you
                        try... music...

        The silence is profound. But Vincent looks into her

        eyes, and listens, and SMILES.

                                      VINCENT
                        Yes... I hear it...

                              (very gently)
                        Yes...

        Wordless, Catherine smiles and lifts her hands to his, and
          Vincent takes her in his arms. Together, they MOVE OFF out of
        frame.


  85LONG SHOT. GREAT BALL85

        We ANGLE DOWN from above. Catherine and Vincent, in each
          other's arms, are tiny figures at the far end of huge
        chamber. Behind them, etched in the lantern light, their
          SHADOWS dance against the wall, vast and silent and graceful,
        waltzing to a private music that only they can hear.


                                                                    FADE OUT:
