      A neighborhood in the foothills of Los Angeles.  The houses 
      are hidden by gates and shrubs.  It s late.  Everything is 
      dark and still.  Very little street lighting.   

      A small car makes its way up the hill.  Inside--


      Kate starts up the hill towards her house when her CELL PHONE 
      RINGS.  She juggles her bags, answering--

                                  KATE
                    Hello? 

                                  MALE VOICE
                    Hello, Kate. 

      The VOICE is MUFFLED, DISTORTED.  But Kate recognizes it.  
      She tenses. 

                                  KATE
                    Not tonight.  




                                                                              (CONTINUED)      UNT. KEVIN WILLIAMSON PROJECT    NETWORK DRAFT 1/22/14       2.

      Kate HANGS UP.  She quickly looks around, but the street is 
      deserted, no one in sight.  She grips her key ring, sliding 
      several keys between her fingers -- a possible weapon.  
      Kate s a guarded woman... she has her reasons. 

      Her CELL RINGS AGAIN.  She doesn t answer it.  Just then, a 
      JOGGER rushes by her.  Kate jumps, frightened.  The JOGGER 
      disappears up the hill.  

      Kate quickly moves toward the apartment building when she 
      sees a FIGURE standing at the gate of her building.  

      Kate is instantly terrified.  Then, her CELL PHONE RINGS.  
      She answers--

                                  MALE VOICE
                    Hello, Kate.  

      Kate stares at the MALE FIGURE in front of her.  It s 
      silhouetted in the darkness.  She can t make out a face.  

                                  KATE
                    Is that you?  

                                  MALE VOICE
                    Yes.  Tonight s the night, Kate.

                                  KATE
                    No--

      The FIGURE starts towards her.  As he grows closer REVEAL he 
      wears a MASK.  Flesh colored.  A blank expression.  
      Incredibly creepy.  Kate runs, SCREAMING-- 

                                  KATE
                    Help me... somebody...

      She races back down the hill, towards her car.  The MASKED 
      MAN catches up to her.  He grabs her, spins her around.  Kate  
      tries to fight, strikes him with her keys but she s 
        unexpectedly SPLATTERED WITH GASOLINE.  

      The MASKED MAN has a jug with a spray gun.  He continues to 
      SPRAY her with it.  It douses her face, gets in her eyes.  It 
      takes Kate a moment for her to realize it s gas.  She smells 
      it.  Freaked out.  Oh God... she stumbles backwards.

      Then, the MASKED FIGURE withdraws a LIGHTER.  She SHOVES him 
      BACKWARDS.  It buys her two seconds.  She BEEPS her car 
      doors, unlocking them, goes for the door when the MASKED MAN 
      catches up to her -- she strikes, aiming for his neck.  It 
      works, the keys tear skin.  




                                                                              (CONTINUED)      UNT. KEVIN WILLIAMSON PROJECT    NETWORK DRAFT 1/22/14       3.

      He WINCES, grabs his neck, allowing enough time for Kate to 
      slip into her car and lock the doors.

      She goes to start the car when she realizes -- SHE DOESN T 
      HAVE THE KEYS.  She turns to the MASKED MAN.  He holds them 
      in his hand.  Jingles them.  Taunting her.  

      He CLICKS the LOCKS open.  She LOCKS them again.  He CLICKS 
      them open.  She LOCKS them again.  She SCREAMS.  She begins 
      to HONK the horn.  Will someone hear her?  She looks.  The 
      street is deserted.  

      That s when Kate sees the MAN BEGIN to SPRAY THE CAR WITH  
      GASOLINE.  He starts on the hood, the roof, trunk.  He 
      quickly sprays the entire car down.  Gas streaks and runs.

      Inside the car, Kate is hysterical.  She beats on the CAR 
      HORN, wildly.  

                                  KATE
                    Somebody hear me.  Help me.

      Through the glass, she sees the MAN hold up a BOX OF MATCHES.   
      He withdraws a match and strikes.  The FLAME IGNITES.  Holy 
      fuck.  He throws it onto the hood but it GOES OUT.  He 
      quickly strikes another.  

      Kate SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER.  She lifts the EMERGENCY BRAKE, 
      puts the car in REVERSE just as he STRIKES another match, 
      tossing it toward the car as it begins to roll down the hill.  
      The MATCH goes out again.

      The MAN follows the car as it rolls down the hill.  He 
      STRIKES another match -- it hits the hood and the entire 
      front of the car IGNITES INTO FLAMES.  It spreads up the 
      windshield and onto the roof. 

      The FLAMES GROW as the car gains momentum, shooting down the 
      street, out of control.  Inside, Kate grabs the steering 
      wheel.  It s locked.  The car speeds to the bottom of the 
      hill, engulfed in flames, veering off into the front yard of 
      a residential home, COLLIDING into a telephone pole.  

      The impact CRUSHES the trunk of the car as Kate is still 
      trapped within... SCREAMING for her life until the CAR 
      EXPLODES INTO a FIERY BALL OF FLAMES, silencing her forever.

      From the blackness comes the morning sun-- 


      A warm blue sky.  Palm trees.  A modest neighborhood in the 
      flats of Los Angeles.  A MAN, late 30 s, jogs down a 
      sidewalk.  THE WOMAN S VOICE OVER continues--

      SCENE INTERCUTS AS NECESSARY:


      The MAN runs to a corner, crosses the street to a house where 
      he sees a WOMAN and CHILD -- a small boy, 10, exit their 
      house and move to the car.  She s dressed for work, the young 
      boy has his book bag in hand.  They load into the car, a 
      morning routine.

                    Driven by rejection, revenge, 
                    jealousy -- stalking is the result 
                    of relationships gone wrong.  Or 
                      delusional fixations that are 
                    pushed to extremes.

      Across the street, the MAN watches from behind a tree.  His 
      eyes are conflicted.  Anger?  Hurt?  There s a history here.


      The MAN jogs up to a small apartment building and enters.

      The sleek stone and glass monstrosity downtown.  


      The street where Kate Edwards was killed.  A car parks and 
      Beth and Jack get out.  COP CARS are still present.  Beth 
      looks down the hill -- the shell of Kate s burned car is 
      being towed away.  They move inside.     UNT. KEVIN WILLIAMSON PROJECT    NETWORK DRAFT 1/22/14       15. 



      An affluent home in Brentwood.  Beth s car pulls up and parks 
      on the street.  Jack and Beth get out.


      Larry sits on the back patio overlooking the pool.  Beth and 
      Jack sit opposite him on patio furniture. 

                                  LARRY
                    I m sorry to hear about Kate.

      Larry glances towards the house.  Ellen is in the kitchen, 
      she keeps looking at them through the window.  

                                  BETH
                    Mr. Myers, where were you last

                    Here all night with my wife.

                    When was the last time you saw

                                  LARRY
                    A year ago.  She came to me and 
                    asked if I was sending her notes 
                    and gifts.  I wasn t.  She said she 
                    was being stalked and was thinking 
                    about moving because of it.  

                                  BETH
                    She didn t mention anyone she 
                      suspected? 

                                  LARRY
                    She suspected me.  She thought I 
                    was doing it.  Like I was hung up 
                    on her. 

                                  JACK

                                  LARRY
                    I made a mistake with Kate but I m 
                    not the stalker type.  I m a 
                    married man.

                    we first met, I looked at your

                    It s all I can come up with.  I was 
                    pleasant and personable.  I showed 
                      a reasonable level of intelligence.  
                    I m good looking--

                    I have a healthy ego.  The only 
                    wrong move I made was when my eyes 
                    lingered in your upper torso area a 
                    second too long and it triggered an 
                    instant dislike for me.  How do I 
                    fix that? 

      Jack is sincere in his question.  Beth is genuinely curious.

                    You re wearing a white silk blouse, 
                    dark bra, red fingernail polish.   
                    I took the male leap that it was 
                    meant to be noticed so I let my 
                    eyes linger in hopes you would be 
                      flattered.  I miscalculated.

      They cross a walkway and enter a parking structure.  They 
      cross to the GARAGE ELEVATOR.  It s late, the garage is 
      mostly empty. 


      Jack jogs down the street.  He comes to a corner, sees school 
      buses.  He stops, moves behind a tree and catches his breath.  
    He watches -- the SAME WOMAN and CHILD appear.   

    As the WOMAN hugs the CHILD goodbye, she turns -- their eyes 
      meet.  She pauses.  He ducks behind the tree, quickly hiding.  

    He waits there a moment, BREATHING heavily.  What does he do?  
    He knows she s watching.  He waits.  His CELL RINGS.  He 
      answers.

                    Yes, I ll be right there.

    is now gone.  Jack takes off.

                    We gotta get this open.  Now.  

      The OFFICERS move to inspect the doors.  Jack looks around 
      and finds a LARGE METAL TRASH CAN.  He turns it on its side 
      and rolls it to the LARGE FRONT WINDOWS.  He picks it up and 
      CHARGES the WINDOWS.   

      The GLASS EXPLODES AND SHATTERS.  The trash can falls into 
      the main gym floor with Jack behind it.  


      A crime scene.  The MEDIA are there now.  At an AMBULANCE, 
      Beth stands while Lori is being treated by MEDICS.  Beth 
      watches a moment.  Then, turns to find Jack behind her.  
      There s a silence between them -- is he waiting for a  good 
      job .  Beth lets him wait.

                    I can t guarantee that. 

                                  JACK
                          (blurts it out)
                    Then I m just gonna say it -- why 
                    do you wear sexy things if you 
                    don t want men to notice? 

      Beat.  She looks at him.  The gall...

                    For how I feel in them.  I dress 
                    for myself. 

                                  JACK
                    Nice try.  Well, good night.  I 
                    thought the day went well.  

      And he starts off--

                                  BETH
                    I know about New York.

      Jack stops.  Turns. 

                                  BETH
                    And the Captain s wife. 

                                  JACK
                    It was the Captain s son s fiance.

                                  BETH
                    Oh.  You didn t know she was...? 

                                  JACK
                    No, I knew.  There were others too.
                    I made mistakes in New York.  Some 
                    things I can t undo.

      Beth nods.  She appreciates his honesty. 

                                  BETH
                    So you come to LA to be a better 
                    man?  You do know most people are 
                    incapable of change.   

                                  JACK
                    I m an underdog story.  

      Beth smiles.  Jack does have a certain appeal.   

                                  BETH
                      I apologize if it clouded my 
                    initial reaction to you.  

                                  JACK
                    Thank you.  

                                  BETH
                    But do know I still take issues 
                    with certain aspects of your 
                      personality.

                                  JACK
                    Good.  So do I. 

      Beat.  A truce.  Connection.  Whatever. 

                                  BETH
                    So are we done here?  I d like to 
                    go home.

                                  JACK
                    One more thing.  Pure curiosity.  
                    How did you come to run TAU?  Why 
                    this division? 

      That s a big question.  Beth considers long and hard.  Then--

                                  BETH
                    You want backstory?  Well, I was 
                    married.  With a husband and child.  
                    He had an affair with some crazy 
                    woman and she started to stalk us.  
                    She followed us everywhere.  Showed 
                    up at my kid s school, broke into 
                    our home and--

                                  JACK
                    Boiled a bunny?  Yeah, I saw that 
                    movie too--

      Beth is busted.  She smiles.  It s the most significant 
      connection these two have made. 

                                  BETH
                    It was a little funny. 

      Jack smiles now.  Yes, it was.  

                                  BETH
                    Be patient.  I m not the kind of 
                    person who puts it all out there in 
                    the first five minutes.  That would 
                    be creepy.  Good night, Jack.

      Now, Beth turns and leaves the crime scene.  Jack stands 
      there, content with the slightest progress made. 


      Eddie exits the back door of a small cafe.  He wears his WORK 
      TEE that has the restaurant s name on it.  He starts for the 
      street where his car is parked.  




                                                                              (CONTINUED)    UNT. KEVIN WILLIAMSON PROJECT    NETWORK DRAFT 1/22/14       53. 

      CONTINUED:

      ON BETH -- she leans against her car, watching from the 
      street.  She starts over.

      Eddie s crosses the parking lot to the street.  He s walking 
      home.  Beat.  He senses he s being followed.  Finally, he 
      turns and sees Beth.  It surprises him--

                                  EDDIE
                    You shouldn t be here.  

                                  BETH
                    Probably not.  

                                  EDDIE
                    What do you want?   

      Beth is silent.  She keeps following him.  It makes Eddie 
      uncomfortable. 

                                  EDDIE
                    How d you find me? 

      Beth remains silent.  It s starting to rattle Eddie. 

                                  EDDIE
                    You know I m underage, right? 
                          (then)
                    I know what you re doing.  You re 
                    trying to intimidate me. 

      Beth continues to follow him.  Out of nowhere, she KICKS him 
      in his calf.  Eddie stumbles and trips -- Beth pounces on 
      him, knocking him to the ground.  She rolls him over, sticks 
      her knee in his chest -- holding him down.  

                                  BETH
                    I m doing a little more than that.  
                    I m warning you.  Stay away from 
                    Lindsay. 

      Eddie struggles when Beth SLAPS his face quickly.  It s 
      unexpected.  It stuns him.  

                                  EDDIE
                    You can t do that. 

                                  BETH
                    You mean this? 

      She POPS his face again.  It s flushed and red. 

                                  EDDIE
                    You re going to be in trouble.  



                                                                              (CONTINUED)    UNT. KEVIN WILLIAMSON PROJECT    NETWORK DRAFT 1/22/14       54.

                                  BETH
                    Let me tell you something, you 
                    little punk ass twit.  I can lie 
                    better than you can.  People will 
                    believe me.  

      Beth lets this penetrate.  Then--

                                  BETH
                    Stay away from Lindsay.  Got it? 

      Beth rises.  It looks like she might kick Eddie but she walks 
      back to her car. Eddie sits up.  He watches her get in her 
      car and drive away.  His face a flurry of emotion.  


      Jack comes walking up to his apartment building when a SHADOW 
      falls over his back.  He starts to unlock the door when--

                                  WOMAN (O.S.)
                    Did you think I wouldn t find you? 

      Jack freezes.  Slowly, he turns around.  It s the WOMAN he s 
      been stalking.  Meet AMANDA TATE, 37.  A woman full of beauty 
      and grace but tonight -- she s tired and angry.  

                                  JACK
                    Hello, Amanda. 

                                  AMANDA
                    What are you doing here? 

                                  JACK
                    New job.

                                  AMANDA
                    Really?  You just chose LA, out of 
                    all the cities in the world.   

      Jack nods.  He s surprised to see her standing before him.  
      He s off his footing. 

                                  AMANDA
                    I saw you at school today.  Stay 
                    away from us, Jack.  I moved her to 
                    get away from you.  You stay away 
                    from my son. 

                                  JACK
                    You mean our son.

                    No, my son.  He s mine, not yours.

                                  AMANDA
                    I mean it, Jack.  You can t do 
                    this, you can t show up here and 
                    ruin my life.  Not again.  

                                  JACK
                    That s not why I m here.  Please--

      Jack moves towards her.  She instinctively steps back.  This 
      kills him.  He hates that she responds that way. 

                                  AMANDA
                    Leave us alone. 

      She starts to leave.  Jack stands in her way.  Appeals to 
      her... There s a history here.  Open wounds and unfinished 
      feelings. 

                                  JACK
                    I want to change my life.  I don t 
                    want to be the person you remember.  
                    I don t want to be the man my own 
                    son can t...

      Jack is unexpectedly at a loss.  His emotions overtaking him.  
      He tries again, his voice wavering. 

                                  JACK
                          (can t finish)
                    Let me change my life.  Please, I 
                    have a right to see my son.
                          (then)
                    Don t be afraid of me.  

      But she is... by a past full of hurt and anger. 

                                  AMANDA
                    Stay away from us, Jack.  I ll get 
                    a lawyer.  I ll ruin you.  

      Amanda pushes past him, disappearing into the night.  CLOSE

      In the shadows of the yard stands Eddie.  He watches as Beth 
      moves within, just a shape through the closed curtains and 
      blinds.  As the lights CLICK OFF in the house -- CLOSE ON 
      EDDIE -- his face alive, fixated on his new obsession.
