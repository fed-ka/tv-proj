      We re inside a worn, beater Volvo.  And while we don t yet see 
      THE DRIVER, we do see the mess around her:  loose Goldfish 
      crackers, legos, kid Crocs, dripping juice boxes.  Disgusting.        MYSTERIES OF LAURA - PILOT - RAKE - AS OF 11/21/132.


      The car moves down an ALLEY, keeping pace with THE PERP, who 
      we see sporadically through GAPS between buildings, trying to 
      blend with the foot-traffic.

                    Are gazelles that slow once they 
                    hit thirty?  Didn t realize.

                    That hurts.  Where are you?

                    Wait for me!

      But she s already hung up.  Annoyed, he picks up speed.


      Entering the sprawling, sunlit BULLPEN, Laura gets a hero's 
      welcome --  high-fives and backslaps -- from her fellow cops.

                    There you go.

      She makes her way to her mess of a CUBICLE, as cluttered as 
      her car.  Still fielding compliments, she tosses down her 
      purse and searches through a pile of junk, finally uncovering 
      half a BURRITO.  She takes a bite, as--

                    Matter of fact, I did.  Into the

      An all-business Laura enters the eerily quiet lobby, where 
      she is immediately intercepted by a shellshocked 
      ADMINISTRATOR.  They stay on the move, as--

                                  LAURA
                    How bad is it?

                                  WESTMONT ADMINISTRATOR
                    Like nothing I ve ever seen.  We 
                    evacuated the room and locked down 
                    the corridor.

      Laura nods, then, as they reach a classroom door, advises--

                                  LAURA
                    Stay back.

                                  WESTMONT ADMINISTRATOR
                          (obviously)
                    Ya think?

      He bolts off.  Laura braces herself, then ENTERS--


      Eyes wide in horror, Laura is stunned to see DRIPPING, BLOOD-
      RED SPLATTER all along the walls and floor.  

      She gravely approaches the unseen perpetrators, telling them 
      through gritted teeth--

                                  LAURA
                    This is a depraved, unspeakable

      Laura angrily PEELS OUT into traffic and instinctively throws 
      on the SIREN.  The boys squeal in delight.  

      Rolling her eyes, she immediately TURNS OFF THE SIREN and 
      slows down.  The disappointed boys slump in their seats.


      TIGHT ON THE WINCING BOYS being HOSED DOWN in the shower by 
      their stone-faced mom, who wields the spray gun with casual, 
          been-there-done-that prowess.


      As Laura impressively towels off the two boys simultaneously--

                                  LAURA
                    I hope you re prepared to explain 
                      yourselves to your father.  He is 
                    not going to be happy.

      She s barely finished her sentence when--

                    Daddy!

      They immediately SPRINT OUT, naked and dripping.  A beat.  
      Prepared to be doubly pissed, Laura follows them into--


      Laura s husband, JAKE BRODERICK, 45ish, is kicked back on the 
      couch with an open PIZZA BOX on his lap, contentedly eating a

                    for?!  They re busted.  We have to

      He steals the guns from the boys and OPENS FIRE.  The boys

      The naked running duo disappear down the hallway.  An amused 
      Jake stands and embraces his incredulous wife.

                                  JAKE
                    Someone needs a hug.

      He gives her a great one -- warm and comforting -- but Laura 
      just stands there, not hugging back.  Then, as she sniffs--

                                  LAURA

      She doesn t seem that upset.  Are they not together?

                                  LAURA (CONT D)
                    Maybe you can get your  friend  to 
                    sign your divorce papers for you so 
                    we can be done with this already.  
                    I sent mine in over a week ago.

                    what a spectacular disappointment 
                    you are.  I d completely forgotten.

      He smiles and sneaks in a KISS, which after all these years 
      still gives Laura a pang of excitement, try as she might to 
      ignore it.  Then he bolts for the door, shouts to the boys--

      And he s gone.  We hang on Laura for a beat.  Now what?  She 
      bee-lines for the 

      KITCHEN

      and dials a number on the PHONE.  Ring.  Ring.

                                  SAMMI (O.S.)

      Laura is looking out the WINDOW at the unit ACROSS THE 
      COURTYARD, where SAMMI -- 25ish, super cute actress-singer-
        waiter-tarot card reader -- now appears IN HER OWN KITCHEN.  
      The women see each other through their windows, as--

      A servile Latina housekeeper, MARGARITA, 25, leads Laura and

                                  LAURA
                          (smiles, faux-gracious)
                    How awkward of you to say.

                                  ERIC WALDEN
                    Thank you both for coming.  I feel 
                    a bit silly causing all the 
                      commotion, but Deedee insisted we 
                    take this seriously.

                                  DEEDEE WALDEN
                    What s not serious about a death 
                    threat?  I m afraid for us to be in 
                    the house alone.  We ve entertained 
                    every night for a week.  My chef s 
                    at his wit s end.

                CAPTAIN HAUSERLAURA
      I m sure he is.That is a tale of woe.

                                  ERIC WALDEN
                          (indicates)
                    This is Richard Levine, my 
                    attorney. ... Our dear friend, 
                    Lisa.  .... And my brother, Ned.

      More AD LIBBED greetings between the cops, douchey-slick 
      RICHARD, 40ish, another skinny-fashionista, LISA, 35ish, and 
      sad-sack NED, 50ish.  Deedee addresses the new arrivals--

                                  DEEDEE WALDEN
                    Can I offer you a glass of wine or 
                    a piece of chocolate cheesecake?

                                  LAURA
                          (immediately)
                    Yes and yes.      MYSTERIES OF LAURA - PILOT - RAKE - AS OF 11/21/1312.


      She takes an open seat, explaining to no one in particular--

                                  LAURA (CONT D)
                    Left my Hot Pocket at home in the 
                      microwave.

      98-pound Lisa pushes her untouched cake wedge over to Laura.

                                  LISA
                    Take mine.  I m watching my gluten.

                                  LAURA
                    And it shows.

      She unabashedly digs into the cake, Walden placing a glass of 
      wine in front of her.  He then turns to the Captain.

                                  ERIC WALDEN
                          (indicates bottle)
                    Captain?

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                          (hands up in protest)
                      I shouldn t.

                                  LAURA
                          (takes a gulp of hers)
                      I shouldn t either.

      CRASH.  The groups turns to see Eric has DROPPED the wine 
      bottle, now in pieces on the stone floor, wine everywhere.

                                  DEEDEE WALDEN
                    My floor!  Damn it, Eric!

      Her husband looks suddenly tense, overwhelmed.

                                  ERIC WALDEN
                        Sorry....Just...thinking about 
                    work, I suppose.

                                    RICHARD
                    You look like hell.  Go to bed.

      Eric nods agreement.

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                    We ll check your room.

      He eyes Laura, who s now powering down the rest of her cake.

                                  LAURA
                    Right.      MYSTERIES OF LAURA - PILOT - RAKE - AS OF 11/21/1313.


      Deedee tosses a napkin over the wine disaster, calls out--

                                  DEEDEE WALDEN
                      Margarita!


      In what will become a fun signature device of the show to 
      bypass procedural tropes, we RAPID-FIRE JUMP CUT through 
      Laura and the Captain checking the various CLOSETS and 
      BATHROOMS of the luxurious bedroom suite.  

      SLAM INTO Laura s jaw dropping as she sees RACKS of clothes 
      in DEEDEE S CLOSET.  One sexy piece of LINGERIE catches her 
      eye and she holds it up to herself in the mirror.  Not bad.


      Laura and the Captain return to an oddly morose Walden.

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                      Everything seems secure.

                                  LAURA
                    If you don t mind my asking, Mister 
                    Walden, any reason somebody would 
                    want you dead?

                                  ERIC WALDEN
                          (beat, oddly distant)
                    I m no saint.  Even the best of us 
                    can make terrible mistakes.  

      Laura didn t expect such a raw outpouring from the guy.  

                                  LAURA
                    You wanna elaborate on that?

                                  ERIC WALDEN
                      I just....I d give anything to have 
                    my life back the way it was.  
                    Anything.

                                  LAURA
                    Sir, ten minutes ago you were 
                      apologizing for wasting our time.  
                    What s going on?

      He waves her away, slumps into a love seat.  Weird.  The cops 
      exchange curious glances.  Hauser turns back to Walden--      MYSTERIES OF LAURA - PILOT - RAKE - AS OF 11/21/1314.


                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                    We ll let you get some rest.  I m 
                    putting two officers right outside 
                    the door.  You need anything 
                    further, call anytime.  I ll give 
                    you my card. 

      He does and the cops AD LIB their goodnights, exchanging 
      another look on the way out.  Odd duck.


      The detectives RUSH THROUGH THE HOUSE with the frazzled cop.

                                    UNIFORM OFFICER
                    We were right outside the bedroom 
                    door, didn t move an inch since you 
                    walked out.  All of a sudden we hear 
                    yelling, a struggle.  We try the 
                    door -- it s locked -- we bust in...

      They reach the BEDROOM, bolt in to find a SECOND UNIFORM 
      OFFICER standing in shock next to the loveseat, where ERIC 
      WALDEN is slumped over, blood trickling from his neck, DEAD.

                                    UNIFORM OFFICER (CONT D)
                    Makes no sense.  How in the hell?

      Deedee rushes in right behind the stunned cops.

                                  DEEDEE WALDEN
                          (falling apart)
                    Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god...

      OFF the Captain, Laura -- how in the hell, indeed.

                                        ACT TWO


      CRIME SCENE -- detectives and FORENSIC SPECIALISTS dusting 
      for prints, taking photos, etc.  Laura and the Captain stand 
      with the dry coroner, RENALDO, who indicates the fatal wound.

                                    RENALDO THE CORONER
                      Right-handed perp, given the angle.  
                    Some kind of fast-release syringe 
                    right into the larynx.  My guess is 
                      a paralyzing agent with a cyanide 
                    kicker.  He was toast in seconds.  

      BILLY approaches from across the room.

                                  BILLY
                    No sign of a break-in.  Windows and 
                    French doors are locked and secure.

                                  LAURA
                    Killer was in here when we left.

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                          (scoffs)
                    We searched the room top to bottom.

                                  LAURA
                      Apparently not.

      The UNIFORM OFFICER from before approaches.

                    Situation at the front gate.


      Deedee, Richard, Ned, Lisa, Margarita, and CHEF JEAN LUC, 30s 
      -- sit and stand around the luxurious breakfast table, 
      emotional and anxious.  Laura pokes around the room and 
      adjoining PANTRY as the Captain and Billy face the group. 

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                    Folks, we re terribly sorry for 
                    your loss.  But at the same time, 
                    you re unfortunately all suspects 
                    now in a murder investigation.

                                  DEEDEE WALDEN
                    This is outrageous!  We re talking 
                    about my husband!  I loved this 
                    man.  We all did!

                                  LAURA
                          (chimes in from sidelines)
                      Respectfully, ma am, I m gonna go 
                    on a limb and say someone in here 
                    loved him not so much.

      OFF the suspects, eyeing each other with a hint of suspicion--      MYSTERIES OF LAURA - PILOT - RAKE - AS OF 11/21/1318.



      In our next series of RAPID-FIRE JUMP CUTS, we variously see 
      Laura and Billy INTERROGATE THE SUSPECTS:  Jean Luc and 
      Margarita, Lisa, Ned, Richard, until we finally SLAM INTO--

      LAURA AND BILLY questioning a weepy DEEDEE

                                  LAURA
                    Just to clarify my time line, when 
                    we left the dining room, you 
                       supervised  Margarita s clean-up 
                    of the wine, went to take your 
                    Xanax, then sat on the deck with 
                    Richard, where no one else saw you.

      Deedee nods, wipes away a tear.

                                  LAURA (CONT D)
                    One last thing.  Your husband made 
                    a strange comment about not being a 
                    saint, terrible mistakes....Any 
                    idea what he was talking about?

                                  DEEDEE WALDEN
                          (beat, speculating)
                    He was a tough businessman.  People 
                    were angry about him not sharing 
                      technology for the new cell phone 
                    he s launching, but to kill a man?
                          (then)
                    The irony is, this was the best 
                    year of our lives.  Eric and I...we 
                    were happy.  I was a lucky woman.

                                  BILLY
                          (warm, hint of flirtation)
                    I m guessing he was the lucky one.

      Deedee smiles through her tears.  Laura just stares at Billy.


      Laura and Billy walk down the entry HALLWAY.  Laura pokes her 
      head into the GUEST BATHROOM, gives it a once-over, as--

                                  BILLY
                    It s good form to compliment the 
                    widow.  That s Police Work 101.

                                  LAURA
                    No.  It s not.      MYSTERIES OF LAURA - PILOT - RAKE - AS OF 11/21/1319.


                                  BILLY
                    Should be.

                                    UNIFORM OFFICER

                      Detectives.


      TIGHT ON A SECURITY MONITOR, displaying the FRONT GATE.

                                    UNIFORM OFFICER (O.C.)
                    Wait for it.  Here he comes.

      We WIDEN to see Laura, Billy, and the Captain viewing 
      SECURITY FOOTAGE being cued up by the Uniform.  

      ONSCREEN, a teenage SKATE PUNK in a hoodie, FED EX envelope 
      in hand, approaches the gate.  

                                    UNIFORM OFFICER (CONT D)
                    Hello.  Oh, look, a police car.

      Sure enough, the Punk seems to spot the squad car in the 
      driveway, at which point he turns and bolts off.

                                    UNIFORM OFFICER (CONT D)
                    And b bye.  

                                  LAURA
                    Somehow I don't think that kid 
                    works for Fed Ex.

                                  BILLY
                          (reading time stamp)
                    9:21.  Six minutes before needle 
                    hits the neck.

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                          (to the Uniform)
                    Pull a screen shot.  Maybe we can 
                    get an ID.


      TIGHT ON the twins eating PIZZA.  WIDEN to find them with 
      their unshowered mom on a bench outside the PRINCIPAL'S 
      OFFICE.  Laura checks her watch, scans the hall.  No Jake.


      The fidgety, pizza-sauce smeared boys at her side, Laura puts 
      on a brave face as the droll, displeased PRINCIPAL reads a 
      LIST of offenses--

                                  WESTMONT PRINCIPAL
                    January 6th, covering Sophie's face 
                    with green Sharpie during nap

                    March 3rd, found in school office 
                    shredding Mrs. Hwang's US 
                      Citizenship papers.

                                  LAURA
                          (chimes in, clarifying)
                    I don't think that was political.  
                    They can't read a word.

      The Principal just stares at her.  A beat.  He turns back to 
      his list, about to continue, when JAKE BURSTS IN the room.

                                  JAKE
                          (smooth, all smiles)
                    Principal Bellinkoff, how are you, 
                    sir?  I like that suit.  Armani?

                                  WESTMONT PRINCIPAL 
                          (immune to the schmooze)
                    I ll cut to the chase.  Enough is 
                    enough.  Your boys are no longer

      OFF Laura, Jake--


      With both boys on her lap (sharing earbuds, watching a show 
      on an iPad), Laura clicks through MUG SHOTS of skate punks, 
      Billy next to her.  Meredith sits nearby.

                    was unfaithful.  I was fine with it.  
                    I loved him so much I would ve 
                    signed my life away.

                    Then irony of ironies, I catch him 
                      cheating....I slept with Richard to 
                    get back at Eric.  But we made up -- 
                    he broke it off, swore she was out 
                    of his life for good.  And he agreed 
                    we d revise the pre-nup.  That's 
                    what Richard was working on.  

                                  LAURA
                    So you lied to protect your money?

                                  DEEDEE WALDEN
                    I was a partner, a confidant, a best 
                    friend to my husband.  I deserve my 
                    share.  Yes, I messed with the 
                    papers.  If I didn t and it came out 
                    that I d had an affair, the estate 
                    lawyer might have voided my entire 
                    stake.  But I am not a murderer.

                    Who can back you up, besides Rich?

                                  DEEDEE WALDEN
                    No one else knew, other than Eric s 
                    mistress.  

                                  LAURA
                    Too bad you can only identify her

                      Detective, I loved this man.  There 
                    is no way I could kill him.  You 
                    have to believe me.  You have to.

      OFF Laura, despite her suspicions, connecting with Deedee, 
      believing her unlikely story--


      Laura confers with Hauser, Billy, and Max.  Meredith hovers.

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                    Sounds bogus.  No name for this 
                    supposed mistress?  No description?   

                                  MAX
                    Also no paper trail.  At least not 
                    one I ve uncovered yet.  

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                    Laura, please.  Is it not obvious 
                    wifey and lawyer took Walden out?      MYSTERIES OF LAURA - PILOT - RAKE - AS OF 11/21/1337.

                    Concur.  I suggest we warrant up, 
                    look for the weapon, chemicals...

                                  LAURA
                          (in Meredith s face)
                    Are you on this case?
                          (then to Captain)
                    Deedee and Richard are a theory.  
                    But not the only theory.  We re 
                    still looking for skate punk and we 
                    need to find the mistress.  For all 
                    we know she could ve had the 
                    Walden s gate code.  Jilted lover, 
                    plants herself inside the house, 
                    kills Walden, slips out.

                                    CAPTAIN HAUSER
                          (rolls eyes, dismissive)
                    Longshot.  Knock yourself out.  But
                    put in for the warrants.

      As the others peel off, Billy hangs back.

                    Not that I m ruling out Deedee s 
                    story, but why do you buy it?

                                  LAURA
                    Just have a gut feeling it s the 
                    truth.  If you'd ever been in love 
                    with an a-hole, you'd get it.

                                  BILLY
                    Can't say I didn't warn you.  I 
                    could see Jake was a dog from a 
                    mile away.

                                  LAURA
                    Not like I had a lot of options.

                                  BILLY
                    You know that s not true.

      Billy stares her down.  And we suddenly sense there's a  what 
      might have been  aspect to this partnership.

                                  LAURA
                    What can I say?  Blind spot.

      Laura and Sammi frenziedly CLEAN THE CONDO.  Wiping down 
      counters.  Vacuuming.  Tossing TOYS and SIPPY CUPS and random 
      detritus onto a fast-forming junk mountain in the BOYS  
      BEDROOM, where HYPER HARRISON AND NICHOLAS bounce off walls.

      We SLAM INTO Laura DIALING JAKE.  Gets voicemail.

                    Hey it s Jake.  Talk to me.

                                  LAURA
                    Third message.  Let me be clear.  I 
                    landed us a school interview, which 
                    will go down at my place in ten 
                    minutes.  You must be present.  Do 
                    not mess with me.  I will hurt you.

      As she hangs up, Harrison BODYSLAMS his brother into a framed 
      photo, which falls and SMASHES.  The boys stare guiltily at 
      their mom.  Then Harrison COUGHS.  Laura has a brainstorm.

                                  LAURA (CONT D)
                    I think someone needs cough syrup.

                                  HARRISON
                    No, mommy!

      But Laura has already run off, returning with the medicine.  
      She pours a heaping spoonful for the kid.

                                  LAURA
                    Here we go.  Choo-choo.

      Harrison reluctantly gulps it down.  Laura pours out another 
      spoonful, turns to Nicholas.

                                  LAURA (CONT D)
                    Next customer.

                    I didn t cough.

                    But you might.

                    Sorry.  Work emergency.

                    Well.  This has been illuminating.

      She stands to go.  Surprising herself, Laura starts to cry.

                    frankly unfit for my school.

      Jake loses his shit, scaring the hell out of Eleanor.

      Laura stares at him in disbelief, the touching moment 
      suddenly evaporated.

                          (obviously)
                    No!

      Jake shrugs.  It was worth a try.  A beat.

                                  LAURA (CONT D)
                      I appreciate your rant.  But like I 
                    said, you're detached from reality.  
                    I'm a terrible mother.

                                  JAKE
                    You re not so bad.

      He kisses her on the forehead, kisses the boys, then--

                    I ll make a few calls.  We ll 
                    figure this out.

      And he too leaves.  A beat.  Laura regards her wedding ring, 
      checks how easy it'd be to remove.  Still stuck.  She sinks 
      back in the couch, her two boys snuggled asleep on her lap.


      Laura arrives into an upbeat bullpen, falls in with Billy.

                    You a cop?

      Fair point.  The Dude pulls out his wares for Laura, when--

      Sensing trouble, Skank TAKES OFF, Laura on his heels.


      Laura and Billy face off with scared, bruised SKANK.      MYSTERIES OF LAURA - PILOT - RAKE - AS OF 11/21/1344.

                    I don t know nothing about Walden 
                    getting killed!  He liked his bud!

                    Skank, we got you in front of Judge 
                    Wong. Her pot-head son just totaled 
                    the family minivan.  She s gonna

                          (beat, thinks on it)
                    Yeah, actually.  Month ago, he made 
                    me haul my ass up near Santa 
                    Barbara to some hotel.  He was 
                    yelling at his girlfriend -- took 
                    him forever to answer the door.

      Laura and Billy exchange a look -- holy shit.

                    How do you know it wasn t his wife?

                                  SKANK

      Laura speaks with a gaggle of MAIDS in very mediocre SPANISH.  
      A few make eyes with Handsome Billy.  We SUBTITLE--

                                  LAURA
                    First I am giving you much 
                      congratulations.  You are the 
                      cleaningest hotel I am ever

                    has a good idea for taking--

                    --boogers out of grout, por favor 
                    let me know.

      A mix of confused looks and a few grateful smiles.  Laura 
      flashes the PHOTO of Walden.  Back to SPANISH--

                                  LAURA (CONT D)
                    This man, Mister Walden, stays here 
                    last month.  Who is remembering?

      The women look to one MAID in particular.  Laura notices the 
      visibly nervous maid oddly COVER ONE HAND with the other.  

                                  LAURA (CONT D)
                    You washed this man s room?
                          (off her nod)
                    He is with a woman.  You see her?

      The maid speaks perfect English.

                                  HOTEL MAID
                    No.  They were very private.  I saw 
                    him one time only.  But never her.

      The maid s still covering her hand.  Curious, Laura 
        accidentally-on-purpose SPILLS her mint water.  As the maid 
      instinctively cleans up, Laura LOCKS ON a diamond-encrusted 
      platinum WEDDING RING the woman wears on her finger.  A beat.

                    Beautiful ring.  You know, I've 
                    been looking to upgrade mine.  
                    Where can I get one like that?

      Laura stares the woman down.  A tense beat.

                    woman I m looking for.  Doesn't it?

      Billy -- thrown by the seemingly unfounded accusation, is 
      doubly thrown when the maid, now weeping, NODS.

                    I found it in the room after they 
                    checked out.  I was just holding it

                    I m so sorry.  Can t believe I fell 
                    for the ol  leaving on the TV trick.

      Laura FREEZES, having an epiphany.  To herself--

                                  LAURA
                    It was a trick.
                          (turns to Sammi)
                    Can you cover for one more hour?

                    Rinse.  Then conditioner.

                    something more intimate than 
                    putting the leftovers away--

      --to the PANTRY, where we glimpse Margarita UP ON THE 
      COUNTER, Jean Luc, pants down, thrusting into her. 

      We CUT TO LAURA later noticing something on the PANTRY FLOOR  
      (WE ALSO GLIMPSED THIS FROM BEHIND EARLIER), as--


      Pot-dealer Skank stands outside, hearing ANGRY VOICES inside.

                                  LAURA (O.S.)
                    Eric tried to break it off with 
                    Karen that day.  They fought.

      We CUT TO DEEDEE at the precinct, insisting to Laura--

                                  DEEDEE WALDEN
                    He swore she was out of his life 
                    for good.


      Eric offers wine to the Captain, who HOLDS UP HIS HANDS as he 
      declines.  

      We PUSH IN ON ERIC as he NOTICES THE RING on the Captain s 
      hand, then STUMBLES, suddenly realizing.

                                  LAURA (O.S.)
                    Eric saw it on your finger.  And 
                    that s when he realized -- you were 
                    Karen s husband.  You had sent the 
                    death threats.  You had come to 
                    murder him.


      A rattled Eric offers his odd mea culpa to the detectives.

                                  LAURA (O.S.)
                    He all but admitted it in the 
                    bedroom, said he d give anything to 
                    have his life back the way it was.


      With Eric slumped in the love seat, the Captain approaches 
      him to hand over his CARD.  

                                  LAURA (O.S.)
                    And you did.  Right under my nose.

      This time though we see a SYRINGE in the Captain s hand and 
      he discreetly PLUNGES IT INTO WALDEN S NECK, then casually 
      exits with unsuspecting Laura.


      The UNIFORM COPS bust in, thrown to find no struggle at all, 
      but only Walden s lifeless body.

                                  LAURA (O.S.)
                    --making it sound like the murder 
                    happened ten minutes later, when 
                    you were outside -- with me.

      CUT TO the chaos of the CRIME SCENE.  The Captain discreetly 
      recovers an iPOD from behind some clutter on a dresser.  

                                  LAURA (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    You recovered the device when you 
                    entered the crime scene--


      Entering the BULLPEN, Laura again gets a hero's welcome --  
      high-fives, backslaps -- from other cops.  But this time their 
      tone is subdued, as is Laura s.  To passing well-wishers--

                                  LAURA
                    Thanks.  Thank you.  Thanks.  
                          (indicates well-wisher has 
                            food on his lip)
                    Schmutz.
                          (he wipes it away)
                    There you go.

      Max falls in with her, keeping pace, as--

                                  MAX
                      Monumental bust.

                                  LAURA
                    Thanks for the help.      MYSTERIES OF LAURA - PILOT - RAKE - AS OF 11/21/1359.


                                  MAX
                    My mind s officially blown.  You 
                    think you know a guy....Not to pile 
                    on to the unfortunate events of the 
                    day, but still coming up goose-eggs 
                    on the school front.

                                  LAURA
                          (sighs, depressed)
                    Can t believe I m saying this, but 
                    I think I need a nanny.

                                  MAX
                    On it.

      He peels off.  She glumly crosses to her CUBICLE, cluttered 
      as ever.  Tosses her bag down, as--

                                  MEREDITH (O.C.)
                    I suppose a compliment is in order.

      Laura turns to find Meredith, holding a BAG OF CLOTHES.

                                  LAURA
                      Was...that the compliment?

      Meredith just grimaces, then hands over the BAG.

                                  LAURA (CONT D)
                    What s this?

                                  MEREDITH
                    School uniforms.  My sorority 
                    sister runs a pre-K on Montana. 

                                  LAURA
                          (beat, floored)
                    Do I have to interview?

                                  MEREDITH
                    You're in.  I already told her the 
                    boys are a nightmare.  Fortunately 
                    for you, she likes a challenge.

      Laura just stares, then does the unthinkable.  To Meredith's 
      visible discomfort, Laura HUGS HER.


      TIGHT ON clinking coffee mugs.  We REVEAL Laura and Billy, 
      feet up at their desks, toasting, if not gleefully.

                                  BILLY
                    You solved another one, Columbo.      MYSTERIES OF LAURA - PILOT - RAKE - AS OF 11/21/1360.


                                  LAURA
                    One we never should ve had to solve.  
                    I m still reeling....How could he?

                                  BILLY
                    I know, it hurts.  I feel it, too.  
                    But hey, a collar s a collar, and 
                    nobody s got more than you.  You 
                    should apply for Captain.

                                  FAMILIAR VOICE (O.C.)
                    Now there's an inspired idea.

      Surprised, they turn to see JAKE, arriving at their cubicles.  

                                  JAKE
                    Nobody tells people what to do like 
                    Laura.

      He LAUGHS at his own joke.  Billy doesn't find the comment 
      amusing -- and we sense doesn't care much for Jake.  

                                  BILLY
                    Always a pleasure, Jake.

      He walks off.  Oblivious to the attitude, Jake turns to Laura.

                                  JAKE
                    Sorry about your killer boss.  Go 
                    figure.  Saw you called.  What s up?

                                  LAURA
                    What's up is I had no idea what to 
                    do with the boys and wanted to see 
                    how your alleged  calls  were 
                    coming along.  But that fire's put 
                    out, no thanks to you.  So all I 
                    really need from you now is to sign 
                    your papers.  Cause we're done, 
                    Jake.  We're done.

      With that, she uses all her strength to TUG THE WEDDING BAND 
      off her finger and hand it to Jake.  He regards it, nods. 

                                  JAKE
                    If that's what you really want, 
                    I'll sign them tonight.

                                  LAURA
                    Good.

      A beat.  He's still standing there.  Laura eyes him curiously.      MYSTERIES OF LAURA - PILOT - RAKE - AS OF 11/21/1361.


                                  LAURA (CONT D)
                    You can go now.  

      But instead, Jake spots and good-naturedly salutes the POLICE 
      CHIEF, who we see enter the bullpen, all-business.

                                  POLICE CHIEF
                     Scuse me, people!  Gather up!

      Laura stares in confusion as the PRECINCT ASSEMBLES.

                                  POLICE CHIEF (CONT D)
                    Sad day here.  But our work 
                      continues.  Some of you must know
                      Lieutenant Jake Broderick, Mid-
                    Wilshire Homicide.  Formerly, that 
                    is.  Meet your new Captain.

                                  JAKE
                          (sotto, to Laura)
                    Go figure.

      Laura's jaw drops.  She's so thunderstruck that Jake's 
      schmoozy WELCOMING REMARKS are completely lost on her.  

      But ever the detective, what she doesn't miss is a subtle 
      exchanged look between Jake and MEREDITH, who sneaks a 
      discreet WINK at the new boss.  

      Laura's incredulous eyes dart to Jake, then Meredith, then 
      down at the SCHOOL CLOTHES on her desk.  

      Are you fucking kidding me???   OFF Laura--


                                    END OF EPISODE
