Mr. Blume and the headmaster, DR. GUGGENHEIM, come out of the chapel among the throng of students.
Dr. Guggenheim wears a wool coat and smokes a pipe. He is very dashing with silver hair and a warmly patronizing manner. He walks with his hands clasped behind his back.
Two Jack Russell terriers follow quickly at his heels.
DR. GUGGENHEIM
Are you free for graduation, Herman? Maybe you could give us an encore. (whistles to the dogs) Nicholas! Copernicus!
MR. BLUME
(lighting a cigarette)
I don't give a shit. I paid for the whole damn natatorium. The least these little pricks can do is hear me out.
MAX
Mr. Blume.
Max has appeared beside them. Dirk tags along behind him.
MAX
My name's Max Fischer. I just wanted to tell you, I strongly agree with your views concerning Rushmore.
MR. BLUME
You don't say. Tell me something. How long have you gone here?
MAX
Ten years.
MR. BLUME
Then you've been living in a dreamworld for ten years.
MAX
I know it, sir.
Max smiles broadly. They each notice that their haircuts are identical, neatly parted on the side.
MAX
Your speech was excellent. Except I disagree with your ideas about rich kids. Because. After all, we don't choose who our fathers are. But that's really my only criticism.
MR. BLUME
(hesitates)
Thank you.
Mr. Blume looks at Dirk staring up at him. Dirk says softly:
DIRK
Hello.
MAX
This is my chapel partner, Dirk Calloway.
MR. BLUME
(shakes Dirk's hand)
Nice to meet you, Dirk.
MAX
Thank you for coming today, sir.
Max shakes Mr. Blume's hand. Mr. Blume smiles. But Max doesn't go. He just stands there. Searching for the words.
MAX
I really. I think it is. You're right about Rushmore. Look around. It truly is a great school.
Mr. Blume nods. A little uneasy.
MAX
Anyway, nice to have met you.
Max goes. Mr. Blume and Dr. Guggenheim watch him walk away with Dirk.
MR. BLUME
What's his name again?
DR. GUGGENHEIM
Max Fischer.
MR. BLUME
He's a sharp little guy.
Dr. Guggenheim looks across the lawn at Max and his chapel partner. He says wistfully:
DR. GUGGENHEIM
He's one of the worst students we've got.
INSERT COVER OF THE RUSHMORE YEARBOOK:
It is called the Rushmore Yankee. The masthead says Max is editor-in-chief. There is a photograph of him laughing, surrounded by his staff.
We cut to a series of pictures of:
The French Club, Debate Team, lacrosse, golf, drama, Astronomy Society, Glee Club, student council, Model United Nations, Stamp & Coin Club, Gun Club, Bombardment Society, calligraphy, fencing kung fu, beekeeping, and J.V. water polo.
Max is president or captain of virtually every one of these.
Other photographs show Max pole-vaulting, dancing at the Christmas ball, and giving a thumbs up from the cockpit of a Piper Club.
TITLE:
September
Max and Dirk come out the door into the cold. They head across the grass.
MAX
They want to kick me out, Dirk.
DIRK
(concerned)
Oh, no. Not again. What are you going to do?
MAX
The only thing I can do. Try and pull some strings with the administration, I guess.
DIRK
(pause)
Maybe you ought to get a tutor.
MAX
I don't have time for a goddamn tutor. You know my schedule.
INSERT SIGN WRITTEN IN CALLIGRAPHY:
BACKGAMMON CLUB.
Founder: Max Fischer.
Miss Cross is sitting on the bleachers watching her class play Capture-the-Flag. She opens a book. It is 20,000 Leagues under the Sea. She puts a cigarette in her mouth and searches in her pocket for a lighter.
A lit match appears in front of her. Max is holding it. He is wearing a maroon beret, Miss Cross looks at him curiously.
MAX
Hello.
MISS CROSS
Hi.
Miss Cross lights her cigarette on Max's match.
MISS CROSS
I like your hat.
MAX
Thank you. You're a teacher here, aren't you?
MISS CROSS
Uh-huh.
MAX
What subject do you teach?
MISS CROSS
Well, I teach first grade, so I do all the subjects. Except music.
MAX
And this is your first year at Rushmore, I take it.
Miss Cross nods.
MAX
I see. How long have you been a smoker, if you don't mind me asking?
MISS CROSS
(surprised)
Hm. Let's see. How old are you?
MAX
Fifteen.
MISS CROSS
Since I was your age.
MAX
(shocked)
You're kidding.
Miss Cross shakes her head. Max can't believe this.
MAX
You should quit.
MISS CROSS
You're right.
MAX
(going back to his book)
And I should mind my own business.
Miss Cross laughs. Max looks back up.
MAX
Where'd you go to school, by the way?
MISS CROSS
Harvard.
MAX
Really? That's a coincidence. My top schools where I want to apply to are Oxford and The Sorbonne. But my safety is Harvard.
MISS CROSS
(smiles)
That's very ambitious.
MAX
Thank you.
MISS CROSS
What are you going to major in?
MAX
Well. I haven't decided for sure. But probably a double major in Mathematics and Pre-Med. What was your major?
MISS CROSS
Latin-American studies.
MAX
Ah, that's interesting. Did you hear they're not going to teach Latin here anymore?
MISS CROSS
This was more like Central America.
MAX
(pause)
Sure. Central America and whatnot. But moving on: they're gonna cancel Latin. They've got to make room for Japanese.
MISS CROSS
Really? That's too bad. All the Romance Languages come from Latin.
MAX
They do, don't they?
(pause)
Like French, probably.
She nods. She smiles.
MISS CROSS
Nihilo sanctum estne?
MAX
That's Latin, isn't it?
MISS CROSS
Yeah.
MAX
What does it mean?
MISS CROSS
Is nothing sacred?
Long pause. Looking right at her.
MAX
Sic transit gloria. Glory fades. I'm Max Fischer.
Max slides down the bench and puts out his hand.
MISS CROSS
Hi.
They shake hands.
Ronny and Donny set upon a pile of birthday presents at a table by the pool. They are surrounded by kids in swimsuits.
Mr. Blume sits alone at the next table drinking a whiskey in front of the demolished birthday cake. He has a tattoo on his shoulder that says Semper Fi. There is a bucket of golf balls in front of him and he absently tosses them into the pool one at a time.
He looks over at Mrs. Blume. She has red hair just like the twins. She is flirting with a pretty boy Tennis Pro. She looks back to Mr. Blume coldly.
Mr. Blume gets up and walks around the pool. He pauses to shake hands with a Big Man drinking a glass of Scotch. The big man gives Mr. Blume a sudden shove toward the pool, but hangs on to him so he doesn't fall in. The big man laughs.
Mr. Blume climbs up the ladder to the high dive. He sets down his cocktail. He slips and falls and bangs his knee hard on the edge of the board. He gets up quickly. There is a bad cut on his knee and he is bleeding. He looks out at the birthday party down below.
People begin to notice him up there.
He sprints down the board, bounces once as high as he can, and sails out long through the air. He tucks into a cannon ball. He nails the water with a huge splash.
Mrs. Blume gets up with a bitter look on her face and heads for the ladies' room.
Kids gather at the edge of the pool to look down at Mr. Blume playing dead at the bottom with golf balls all around him. A little boy in a Speedo underwear swims to examine Mr. Blume. Their eyes meet. The boy turns and swims away.
Miss Cross and her pupils are out on the playground painting pictures. Each kid has an easel.
Miss Cross sees Mr. Blume standing under a tree at the edge of the playground. He is wearing sunglasses and smoking a cigarette. He moves slightly behind the tree. She stares at him.
He waves. She waves back. He comes over.
MR. BLUME
Hi.
MISS CROSS
Were you hiding over there?
Mr. Blume shrugs. He points at one of the paintings.
MR. BLUME
What's that?
The artist looks up at Mr. Blume. He is a small boy with jet- black curly hair and piercing eyes.
ARTIST
(makes a swimming gesture)
It's a little swimming snake.
Mr. Blume nods.
MISS CROSS
What can I do for you, Mr. Blume?
Mr. Blume turns to Miss Cross and takes off his sunglasses. Silence.
MR. BLUME
Max wants to see you.
MISS CROSS
What for?
MR. BLUME
To apologize, I guess.
MISS CROSS
He sent you here?
MR. BLUME
Yeah.
She frowns and studies Mr. Blume for a minute.
MISS CROSS
Are you his messenger?
MR. BLUME
No. He's my friend.
(pause)
You were right. I shouldn't have let him drink.
Miss Cross nods. Silence.
MISS CROSS
I don't think I should see Max anymore.
MR. BLUME
He's not going to like the sound of that.
MISS CROSS
I know. But I think I let him get too attached.
Mr. Blume nods. Miss Cross looks uncertain.
MISS CROSS
Don't you think?
MR. BLUME
(shrugs)
I don't know. You did your best.
Miss Cross smiles sadly to Mr. Blume. He puts his hands in his pockets.
MISS CROSS
Tell him I'm sorry.
MR. BLUME
OK.
They look at each other for a long minute. Miss Cross tucks a strand of hair behind her ear. Mr. Blume says quietly:
MR. BLUME
What's your first name?
MISS CROSS
Rosemary. What's yours?
MR. BLUME
Herman.
Silence.
MR. BLUME
Oh, yeah. He wrote you a letter.
He hands her a letter in a sealed envelope. She takes it.
MISS CROSS
Thanks.
They stand there in silence for another minute.
MR. BLUME
OK. So long, Rosemary.
MISS CROSS
(smiles)
Bye, Herman.
Mr. Blume starts to go. He stops He looks back to Miss Cross.
MR. BLUME
Should we meet somewhere?
She hesitates.
MR. BLUME
To talk about Max.
MISS CROSS
Yeah. I don't know.
(pause)
Maybe.
Mr. Blume nods. He turns away and walks off. She watches him go. She looks at the envelope.
INSERT LETTER WRITTEN IN CALLIGRAPHY ON CRISP STATIONERY:
Max reads in voice-over.
Dear Miss Cross,
I would like to take this opportunity to formally apologize for the events of the night of the twenty-third. I am not accustomed to drinking alcohol. Please do me the service of coming to the unveiling of a new venture I have undertaken. I hope you will attend, if possible. I remain, your friend,
Max Fischer.
A crowd of fifty Kids in uniform has gathered around the vacant lot beside the baseball field. Max stands with his architect, smiling for the yearbook photographer. They are holding a banner that says 'Cousteau-Blume Marine Observatory Fund-raiser'. Max has on a hard hat. There are two pick-up trucks and a porta-can at the back of the vacant lot.
Max digs into the ground with a gold shovel. The shovel has a ribbon around it. Flashbulbs go off. Everyone claps. Max waves Dirk over.
MAX
Did you see her?
DIRK
She's not here.
MAX
Well, see if she's in her classroom.
The Contractor walks over to Max.
CONTRACTOR
Should we go ahead and take care of this tree?
MAX
Let's wait a few minutes.
Coach Beck goes over to Max. He is six four and wears a John Newcombe mustache and an Adidas warm-up. He is frowning.
COACH BECK
What's going on here, Maxie?
MAX
Coach Beck. Good to see you. This is where they're building the new aquarium. I'm in charge of the committee, if you can believe it.
COACH BECK
This is the baseball diamond.
MAX
I believe it's being relocated a few feet over.
COACH BECK
(frowns)
I should've been informed about that.
Coach Beck walks off. Max answers some questions for the School Reporters.
REPORTER
Is it true the aquarium will have piranhas?
MAX
(smiles)
Where'd you hear that?
REPORTER
My source indicated that it was a possibility.
MAX
Yes, it's true. Excuse me, George.
Dirk has returned.
MAX
What's the story?
DIRK
(a little wary)
She has a substitute teacher today.
MAX
Why?
DIRK
She probably got sick.
MAX
(looks away)
You know she's not sick. Give me the phone.
Max dials on a cellular phone.
MAX
Hi, Janet. It's Max Fischer.
Is Mr. Blume there?
(pause)
Well, where is he?
(pause)
Goddammit, he's supposed to be here.
Let me know if you find him, please.
Max hangs up. He looks off and says in a steely voice:
MAX
I'm going anyway.
Max goes over to the contractor.
MAX
Chop it down, Mr. Chandler! We've got an aquarium to build.
Max talks to another reporter.
MAX
I don't give a shit about barracudas. But fuck it. I'm building it anyway.
The sound of power saws fills the air as Dr. Guggenheim appears at the edge of the lot with Coach Beck and a Security Guard with a walkie-talkie. DR Guggenheim screams:
DR. GUGGENHEIM
Max!
DR. Guggenheim sees the chopped-down trees and mangles baseball field as he strides on to the lot.
MAX
Nice to see you, Dr. Gugg-
DR. GUGGENHEIM
Max!
(seizing Max by the arm)
What do you think you're doing?
MAX
(pause)
We're having a fund-raiser for-
DR. GUGGENHEIM
Shut those damn things off!
They turn off the power saws.
DR. GUGGENHEIM
Tell me this isn't happening.
MAX
Dr. Guggenheim, I'd rather not have this conversation in front of the crew.
Dirk waits nervously on the steps in front of DR. Guggenheim's office. He holds a hamster in his hands.
He gets up and goes to the windows. He looks inside.
Max is sitting in a little chair in the middle of the room with his hard hat on. DR. Guggenheim and several other faculty members sit around him. DR. Guggenheim is screaming at him across his desk. Max is crying.
Dirk looks scared.
Mr. Blume answers on his cellular phone as he gets out of his car and walks across the lawn at Rushmore.
We intercut the two of them.
MR. BLUME
Hey, Max. How's it going over there?
MAX
Terrible. Tell me something. When you talk to Miss Cross the other
day, did you get the feeling-
The hall monitor Mr. Holstead comes down the hall toward Max. He is a big, sturdy man about fifty years old. He wears a striped tie and his sleeves rolled up.
MR HOLSTEAD
(loudly)
Do you have a telephone pass?
Max holds up his hand for Mr. Holstead to wait a minute. He covers his ear so he can hear Mr. Blume.
Mr. Blume is looking in the windows of different classrooms. Kids look out at him curiously.
MR. BLUME
I got to tell you, Max. I don't know what you see in her. I don't think she's right for you.
MAX
What's that supposed to mean?
Mr. Blume sees Miss Cross inside teaching her class. He stares at her in a glance. He whispers:
MR. BLUME
Well, she's not that beautiful. She's not that interesting. I mean, sure, there's something about her. But I see you with someone-
MAX
Look, Mr. Blume. Your comments are valuable, but let's get to the point. Will she see me again? Yes or no?
MR. BLUME
(pause)
No.
MAX
I'm going to go see her. Hang on.
Max looks to Mr. Holstead.
MAX
I'm talking on the telephone.
Mr. Holstead reaches over and hangs up the phone.
MAX
Come on, man. That's rude.
Max rides full speed through the gates on to the Rushmore campus. He flips one leg off his bike and glides in toward the bike racks standing on one pedal.
Max locks up his bike and walks across the lawn.
MAGNUS
You better beat it, laddie.
Max looks up at Magnus Buchan sitting in a tree smoking a cigarette, hacking at a branch with a pocketknife.
MAX
I hope you fall out of that tree and get stick in the ass, Buchan.
MAGNUS
You know, I've watched you, Fischer. Showboat, always talking, picking a kid like Dirk cause his mother's a great piece and then getting nowhere. Like everything you do. Big show. No results.
MAX
And what do you call getting a hand job from Mrs. Calloway in her Jaguar?
MAGNUS
A bloody lie.
MAX
You think I got kicked out for just the aquarium? Nah. That ain't it. It was the hand job. And I'll tell you another thing. It was worth it. So eat your heard out, mick. I got business to attend to.
Miss Cross comes out the door of the lower school with a basket of books and papers. She stops in front of her wagon and digs in her bag for the keys.
MAX
Or do you want me to go?
MISS CROSS
(looks around, sighs)
You can talk to me.
Miss Cross goes over to him. She stops a few feet away and they stand there in silence.
MAX
I'm sorry I embarrassed you at dinner.
MISS CROSS
That's OK.
MAX
No, it's not. And please apologize to what's his name for me.
MISS CROSS
I will. Are you OK?
MAX
I'm fine. But I miss Rushmore. I miss the seasons. And watching the leaves change.
MISS CROSS
But it's only three blocks away.
MAX
I know. I miss seeing you.
MISS CROSS
(pause)
I miss you, too.
Max looks off into the trees. A squirrel leaps from one branch to another. Max smiles and shakes his head. A crashing noise is heard from the roof of the planetarium. Someone ducks for cover, but Max and Miss Cross don't see him.
Max reaches into his backpack and says mysteriously:
MAX
By the way, what time does the library close? I got an overdue book to turn in.
Max takes out the Jacques Cousteau library book and hands it to Miss Cross. She looks at it and starts to say something but she stops. She opens the book and looks at it in silence.
MAX
That's your handwriting, isn't it?
Max shows her the Henry James quote. Miss Cross nods.
MAX
Not bad. Except it's probably bad form for a teacher to write in a library book.
MISS CROSS
It wasn't a library book when I wrote in it.
MAX
What do you mean?
MISS CROSS
I gave this book to Rushmore.
Max looks puzzled. Miss Cross shows him a little card inside the front cover of the book.
INSERT LIBRARY BOOK:
In Memory of EDWARD APPLEBY
Class of '87
MISS CROSS
My husband gave me this book in the seventh grade. And he went to Rushmore. So when he died I put it in the library here.
MAX
So that's who that is. Edward Appleby.
(looks to Miss Cross)
You already knew him in the seventh grade?
MISS CROSS
I knew him all my life.
(looks to Max)
You remind me of him, you know?
MAX
I do? How?
MISS CROSS
Well. Weren't you in the Rushmore Beekeepers?
MAX
(frowns)
Yeah. I was President of them.
MISS CROSS
He founded that club.
MAX
(pause)
I get your meaning. I founded a few clubs myself in my day.
An acorn falls on Max's head. He looks up. There is no one there, but a scurrying sound is heard. Max frowns.
MAX
What was that? A squirrel?
Mr. Blume is crouched just out of view on the roof. He looks back over his shoulder and sees a small, white-haired, Indian GROUNDSKEEPER looking at him. The groundskeeper is holding a rake. Mr. Blume rises slowly. He whispers:
MR. BLUME
Is this the natatorium?
The groundskeeper frowns and shakes his head.
MAX
Do you think we can be friends again, Miss Cross? In a strictly platonic way?
MISS CROSS
Of course, I do. Do you think you can make a go of it and settle down at Grover Cleveland?
MAX
Yeah. But I need a tutor.
MISS CROSS
I'll be your tutor.
MAX
(looking into her eyes)
You will?
Miss Cross smiles and nods.
MAX
Thank you.
(pause)
What are you doing tomorrow?
CUT TO:
Mr. Blume sitting at the desk in his office. Max yells at him over the speakerphone:
MAX
She's taking me to a field trip!
MR. BLUME
(hesitates)
Great! You need anybody to chaperone?
MAX
You'd take time out of your business to do that?
MR. BLUME
Business schmizness.
OCTOBER MONTAGE:
Max and Miss Cross ride in the backseat of a van full of first graders. Max is telling a story and everyone is laughing. Mr. Blume is up front quietly driving the van. One of the first graders sits in the passenger seat staring at him. They go through the front gates of the zoo.
Miss Cross stands at the front of her classroom drawing a complicated geometric proof on the chalkboard. Max sits alone across from her nodding earnestly and taking notes.
Max and Miss Cross play doubles against Mr. Blume and Dirk on the court in the Blume's backyard. Max coaches Miss Cross on her backhand. Mr. Blume watches her from across the net. Mrs. Blume watches all of them from an upstairs window.
The Grover Cleveland Science Fair. Max sits proudly in front of his project. It is a paper mache tidal wave looming over a little coastal village with screaming peasants.
Margaret Yang is across the aisle being photographed with a trophy for Best of Show. Her project is called Light, Color, Sound and Magnetism. She is staring at Max, but he doesn't notice her.
Mrs. Whitney hands Max a geometry test. It has a C+ on it. Max looks quickly to Mrs. Whitney, surprised. She smiles and shakes his hand.
A huge banner for the Grover Cleveland Owls is stretched across the endzone of the football field. Max, dressed in a shiny blue and grey jumpsuit, bursts through the banner and onto the field doing cartwheels and flips. The football teams scrambles out behind him.
Max points out to different parts of the crows and yells football cheers. Dirk is sitting in between Mr. Blume and Miss Cross in the stands. Mr. Blume stares at Miss Cross. Miss Cross looks back and Mr. Blume and smiles. Dirk says significantly:
DIRK
Where's Mrs. Blume tonight, Mr. Blume?
And your sons Ronny and Donny?
MR. BLUME
I haven't the slightest idea, Dirk.
A nice two story house with a wide lawn and lots of trees. Mr. Blume knocks on the front door and waits nervously. He looks around the yard with his hands in his pockets.
The door opens. Miss Cross is holding a plate of sliced carrots. She looks at Mr. Blume curiously and smiles.
MISS CROSS
Hi, Herman.
MR. BLUME
How are you, Rosemary?
MISS CROSS
Fine, thanks. I just got home and I'm having a little snack.
MR. BLUME
Having some carrots.
Miss Cross nods. Mr. Blume looks up at the house.
MR. BLUME
Nice house.
MISS CROSS
Yeah, This isn't mine. I'm' just kind of housesitting.
(pause)
Were you in the neighborhood?
Mr. Blume nods. There is an awkward silence.
MR. BLUME
Didn't Max have anything planned for us today? A trip to the museum or something?
MISS CROSS
Did he? I thought he was rehearsing this evening.
MR. BLUME
Oh. That's right. His new play. He's going to be in this one, isn't he?
Miss Cross nods. Mr. Blume shakes his head.
MR. BLUME
He's really making a go of it over at Grover Cleveland.
MISS CROSS
I think he's on track. It's nice, isn't it?
Mr. Blume nods. Silence.
MISS CROSS
You want a carrot?
MR. BLUME
Yeah. I'll have one of those.
Mr. Blume takes one of the carrots and has a bite of it. Miss Cross watches him chewing. She smiles slightly.
MR. BLUME
Well. Max had said something about us all going to the horseraces, so I'm sure I'll see you soon.
Miss Cross nods. Mr. Blume takes another bite of his carrot and throws the rest of it into the yard. Miss Cross laughs. Mr. Blume smiles and shrugs. He starts to go.
MISS CROSS
Or we could go for a walk, if you want.
Mr. Blume stops and turns around quickly.
MR. BLUME
Sure.
MISS CROSS
It's nice out, don't you think?
Kind of brisk.
Mr. Blume nods.
MISS CROSS
Let me get a sweater. I'll be right back.
She goes inside. Mr. Blume stands alone on the doorstep. He rubs his hands together to warm-up.
Mr. Blume is parked at the curb, staring off into space. Ronny and Donny jump into the car and slam the doors.
RONNY
Let's go.
Mr. Blume automatically puts the car in gear. He slams on the brakes. Dirk is standing in front of the car, blocking them. He stares at Mr. Blume. Mr. Blume rolls down his window.
MR. BLUME
Dirk?
Dirk does not budge. Mr. Blume gets out of the car and leaves it idling. He closes the door.
MR. BLUME
Dirk? What's wrong?
DIRK
I know about you and the teacher.
Silence. Mr. Blume looks very worried.
MR. BLUME
Does Max know?
DIRK
No. And I don't want him to know. I just want it to stop. Right now.
They stare at each other.
DIRK
You're a married man, Blume. And you're supposed to be his friend.
MR. BLUME
Look, Dirk. I am his friend -
DIRK
Yeah. And with friends like you, who needs friends?
Dirk turns and walks off. Mr. Blume looks puzzled.
MR. BLUME
Jesus Christ.
Mr. Blume sighs. He turns around and tries to open the car door. Ronny and Donny have locked him out of the car. He can see them inside laughing. He says fiercely:
MR. BLUME
Unlock it!
CUT TO:
Dirk walking across the lawn with a hard look on his face. He walks past Magnus Buchan. Magnus is throwing Chinese throwing stars at a tree trunk.
MAGNUS
Little Calloway
Dirk stops and looks to Magnus.
MAGNUS
You're standing up for the wrong bloke. Fischer ain't your mate.
DIRK
(angry)
What are you talking about, Buchan?
MAGNUS
(shrugs)
He thinks your mum's good for a bonk. That's why he picked you as his chapel partner.
Dirk looks deeply wounded. But he doesn't want to believe it:
DIRK
Who sold you that crock?
MAGNUS
He told me himself. He says she gave him a hand job in the backseat of her bloody Jaguar.
DIRK
Max would never say that.
MAGNUS
(smiles)
Yeah. You're probably right. After all, the son of a brain doctor doesn't need to impress anybody.
Buchan laughs wickedly and fires off another throwing star.
Mr. Blume puts on his jacket as he walks down the front path from Miss Cross' house. He gets in his Bentley and starts the engine. He looks in the rearview mirror and sees the glowing red tip of a cigarette. He wheels around fast.
Max is sitting in the backseat smoking a cigarette.
BLUME
Max!
MAX
How was she, Herman?
BLUME
Jesus Christ!
MAX
Was she good? I bet she was. Although I wouldn't know cause I never screwed her.
Blume flicks on the lights. Max has tears all over his face.
MAX
(with bitter contempt)
Going skinny-dipping while I took a nap. Are you comfortable, Max? I'll just be out nude getting hand jobs from the woman you love.
MR. BLUME
(frowns)
We never went skipping dipping.
MAX
Sure, you didn't. And next you're going to tell me you didn't just walk out of her house at two o'clock in the morning.
MR. BLUME
(pause)
I'm in love with her.
MAX
Well, I was in love with her first. And all that crap about, I don't think she's that great, I don't think she's right for you, Max. That was all bullshit, wasn't it?
Silence.
MAX
Do you think she's in love with you?
MR. BLUME
I don't know.
MAX
Well, I guarantee you she's not.
And she never will be.
MR. BLUME
Look, Max -
MAX
I saved Latin!
Max glares at Mr. Blume. He shakes his head.
MAX
What'd you ever do?
A cold day. Dry leaves fall from the trees in the park.
Mr. Blume comes down the path to Max sitting alone on a bench. Max is dressed in blue jeans, a plaid shirt, a ski cap, and huge down parka. Mrs. Blume is wearing a topcoat and gloves. Max stands up to shake hands with her.
MAX
Thank you for meeting me.
MRS. BLUME
(coldly)
You're welcome.
MAX
Would you like a sandwich?
Silence. Mrs. Blume looks around the park.
MRS. BLUME
All right.
She sits down. Max takes two sandwiches out of his backpack.
MAX
I have tuna fish and I have peanut butter and jelly. I'm sorry it's not something more exotic.
MRS. BLUME
I'll take the tuna fish.
Max gives her the tuna fish sandwich.
MAX
Milk or apple juice?
Max holds out the two drinks. Mrs. Blume just stares at him.
MAX
You want me to cut to the chase?
Silence. Max puts down his sandwich and gathers his thoughts.
MAX
OK. As you know, Mr. Blume and I used to be friends.
MRS. BLUME
I have no idea what the relationship is between you and Herman. Honestly, I find it very bizarre.
MAX
(taken aback)
What do you mean to imply?
MRS. BLUME
I'm not implying anything. You make a very strange couple. It's too bad Herman doesn't have that kind of affection for his own children.
MAX
Well, I'm sure he does.
MRS. BLUME
No, he doesn't.
MAX
I know you don't really mean that.
MRS. BLUME
(angry)
Of course, I do.
MAX
From his perspective it's -
MRS. BLUME
Why did you call me?
MAX
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
MRS. BLUME
(icily)
Please. Get to the point.
MAX
Gladly. Your husband's fucking a schoolteacher, pardon my French. I thought you should know.
Silence.
MRS. BLUME
Why are you telling me this? Are you trying to hurt Mr. Blume? Or are you trying to hurt me?
MAX
I have no reason to want to hurt you.
MRS. BLUME
Then you're trying to hurt Herman.
MAX
That's correct.
Mr. Blume gets out of his car in the driveway at Grover Cleveland. He opens the trunk and takes out a set of steel cable cutters. He goes over to the bike racks and cuts the lock off Max's ten-speed.
Mr. Blume lays the bicycle on the ground in front of his car and runs over it. Then he throws the car in reverse and goes over it again. He picks up the destroyed bicycle and takes it back to the bike racks and wraps the lock back around it.
The small Indian groundskeeper we saw earlier on the roof is driving by in a Volkswagen Beetle. He frowns at Mr. Blume. Mr. Blume hurries back to his car.
The front gates of the concrete plant. Max rides up on an old grandmothers' bicycle with fenders and a handlebar basket. He's got a black duffel bag strapped to his back.
Max waves to the SECURITY GUARD. The guard waves back:
Max rides onto the lot and pulls over next to Mr. Blume's Bentley. He leans his bike against the car door. He unzips his duffel bag and slides underneath the car.
Mr. Blume pulls into the driveway to pick-up the twins from school. There is a lot of traffic and kids are running around everywhere. Mr. Blume taps the brakes. Nothing happens. He flies toward the back of a parked station wagon.
He jerks the steering wheel and bounces up onto the sidewalk. The car pops through a wooden fence and rolls across the grass into the quadrangle.
The Indian groundskeeper is raking leaves as the car goes past him. He watches as it crunches over some bushes and scrapes against a stone wall. It rolls to a stop in the middle of the quad.
Mr. Blume gets out of the car and looks at the damage. He looks over at the white-haired Indian groundskeeper.
The groundskeeper goes back to raking.
Kids watch from classrooms up and down the hall as Max is escorted away in handcuffs by the POLICE. Max has a hardened expression on his face.
Max walks into the quadrangle with cold expression on his face. It is Halloween and there is a jack-o-lantern on the steps. Lots of kids are dressed in costumes.
Suddenly, Max is being pelted with rocks. He looks around frantically and sees Dirk and a longhaired kid named TOMMY STALLINGS as they set upon him.
Dirk is dressed as a sorcerer. Tommy has on a karate outfit with a black belt. Max runs for cover behind some bushes.
MAX
What are you doing? Are you crazy?
DIRK
You're trespassing! This is private property!
More rocks sail past Max. A pinecone hits him on the head.
MAX
Wait a minute! Stop!
Max raises his hands in the air. Dirk motions for Tommy to hold his fire. Max slowly stands up.
MAX
Let's have a truce for a second. I want to talk.
They meet out in the open. Tommy follows with a rock in each hand. Silence.
MAX
What's this all about?
Dirk stares at Max or along minute.
DIRK
Did you say my mother gave you a hand job?
MAX
(shocked)
What?
DIRK
(steely)
Did you say it?
MAX
Who told you that goddamn lie?
Silence.
MAX
Never mind. I know who said it. And I'm going to stick a knife in his heart. And I'm going to send him back to Ireland in a bodybag.
TOMMY
He's from Scotland.
MAX
Well, tell that stupid mick he just made my list of things to do today. I'm going to pop a cap in his ass.
Max comes out the door of the lower school in a daze. Magnus Buchan is sitting on a bench eating some candy. He is wearing the uniform of the Green Beret. He sees Max and laughs.
MAGNUS
Fischer, ya spotty fucker!
MAX
Hello, Magnus.
MAGNUS
Got any hand jobs lately?
MAX
No, I haven't.
Dirk appears with some of his friends.
MAGNUS
Hey, Dirk! Look who's here. Your stepfather! Waitin' for your mum so he can get a piece.
Dirk is very embarrassed. He frowns and looks at the ground. Max stares at Magnus with bitter contempt.
MAX
Your mind is as warped as your ear, Buchan.
MAGNUS
(standing up)
Don't get nasty, brother.
Max breaks into a sprint straight at Magnus.
Magnus draws back and nails Max in the cheek. Max goes down but gets right back up. They throw a flurry of punches at each other's faces. Some kids come running over to watch.
Max tackles Magnus around the legs. Magnus throws a hard punch straight down at the top of Max's head. Max goes limp and collapses to the ground.
CUT TO:
Max's eyes opening. He is lying his back in a pile of leaves. A bunch of little kids have circled around him.
Max's nose bleeds profusely. One of his eyes is swollen shut. He's got several smaller cuts all over his face. His shirt is torn more or less in half. He looks up at Dirk standing over him. He lifts up his hand to Dirk.
MAX
We got him, Dirk. We got him.
But Dirk does not take Max's hand. He turns away.
Mr. Blume spots Max sitting Indian-style at the foot of his mother's grave on a cold grey day. The simple epitaph reads: Eloise Fischer, beloved wife of Bert and mother of Max. Written below it says: the paths of glory lead but to the grave. Mr. Blume approaches warily.
MR. BLUME
Max?
Max looks up. There is quite a sadness about him and his voice has lost all feeling of possibility.
MAX
Hi, Mr. Blume.
Mr. Blume stands there in silence.
MR. BLUME
You wanted to meet?
MAX
When?
MR. BLUME
Right now. You said you wanted to meet to put an end to this nonsense.
MAX
Oh. Yeah. I was going to try and have that oak tree fall on you.
Max jerks him thumb over his shoulder. Mr. Blume looks at a massive oak tree hanging precariously by the roots.
MR. BLUME
That big one? That would have really pancaked me.
(pause)
What stopped you?
MAX
(shrugs)
What's the use? She loves you.
Max gets up. They look at each other in silence.
MAX
So long Mr. Blume.
Max starts to walk away. Mr. Blume calls after him.
MR. BLUME
She's my Rushmore, Max.
MAX
(without stopping)
Yeah, I know. She was mine, too.
Max leaves the cemetery. Mr. Blume stands alone. He goes over to the tree and taps it. It comes crashing down.
TITLE:
November.
THANKSGIVING MONTAGE:
Max walks down the street with his lunch in a brown paper bag. He goes into the barbershop. He nods hello to his father and puts on a white barber's jacket. He has a blank, hollow expression on his face.
Max gives an old man a haircut while the old man reads the paper. Max gives another old man a shave. Man combs another old man's hair and holds up a mirror so he can see the back.
Dirk rides past the barbershop on his little French three-speed. He circles back and looks at Max take the trash out to the dumpster. Max doesn't see him. Dirk pedals away.
Margaret knocks on the front door of the Fischers' house. Mr. Fischer opens the door. He and Margaret talk for a minute. Mr. Fischer shakes his sadly. Margaret nods.
Mr. Fischer closes the door as Margaret walks out to the sidewalk. She looks back at the house. Max is sitting on the window, staring off into space. Margaret hesitates. She goes across the yard to the window.
She taps on the glass. Max looks out to her. She waves to him. Max closes the curtains.
Margaret turns away sadly and walks off down the sidewalk.
Max and Mr. Fischer sit in front of the TV having TV Thanksgiving dinners as they watch a football game. Mr. Fischer looks at Max. Max stares at the television set.
TITLE:
December.
Dirk comes out of the barbershop in a terrible haircut. He waves to Max and rides off in his three-speed.
Max opens the Fischer's garage door. His smashed-up ten-speed hangs from a peg on the wall. He takes is down and carries it out off the garage.
A few ICE SKATERS race around and do figure-8's on the little frozen pond at the edge of town. Dirk is sitting on his tackle box, fishing from a hole in the ice. He stomps his feet, and even with his mittens on he has to blow into his hands to keep warm.
Max sits with his bare hands resting on the ice.
MAX
People hate me.
DIRK
That's not true.
MAX
Guggenheim tried to spit on me.
Poor old guy couldn't even spit.
And Blume and Cross?
(shakes his head)
They can't stand me.
I ruined their whole relationship.
Dirk looks down at Max's red hands.
DIRK
You should put your mittens on.
MAX
(absently)
Oh. They're already numb. I'm surprised you don't spit on me, Dirk.
DIRK
You're my friend, Max.
Tear's starts streaming down Max's face. Dirk looks worried.
MAX
I'm sorry about what I said about your mother giving me a hand job. I just --
DIRK
I know, Max. Listen. I'm sorry I didn't take your hand when Buchan kicked your ass.
MAX
(pause)
I got a few licks in. At the very least, he'll think twice about spreading that kind of garbage.
DIRK
You should stand up.
MAX
I'm awfully comfortable.
Silence. One of the skaters begins to circle around Max and Dirk closer and closer. She suddenly scratches to a halt right in front of them.
The skater is a girl in white skates and grey tights and a short camel's hair coat. She has a scarf over the lower half of her face. She says to Max:
SKATER
Is this your handwriting?
She holds out a little piece of paper torn out from a spiral notebook. Max stands up and takes it. There is a note written on it in blue crayon.
INSERT PIECE OF PAPER:
Please come to the frozen pond at 3:30 PM this afternoon. Thank you very much.
Max looks to Dirk. Dirk is putting a new worm on his hook.
MAX
No. But it looks familiar.
Max gives the piece of paper back to the girl. She lowers her scarf and we see she is Margaret Yang.
MAX
Do you know Dirk Calloway?
MARGARET
I don't think so.
MAX
Dirk, this is Margaret Yang.
Dirk nods. Margaret waves to him. Silence.
MAX
I heard about your science fair project on Action 13 the other day. They said the Navy was going to buy it from you.
Margaret is polite but cold.
MARGARET
Not anymore.
MAX
Why not?
MARGARET
Because it was fake.
MAX
What do you mean?
MARGARET
(sighs)
I faked all the results.
MAX
Why?
MARGARET
Because it didn't work. I thought it would but it didn't.
MAX
(in disbelief)
You mean it was all bullshit?
MARGARET
Not all of it. Just the parts I didn't get right.
Max stares at her. It is as if he is seeing her for the first time. He says quietly:
MAX
That's exactly the way I would have handled that situation.
MARGARET
Well. It's nothing to be proud of.
MAX
But it's true.
Max is completely hypnotized by her.
MARGARET
You were a real jerk to me.
MAX
(pause)
I know. I'm sorry, Margaret.
Silence.
MARGARET
Well. Anyway. Nice to see you.
MAX
Yeah. Nice to see you, too.
Margaret starts skating slowly away backwards. Max waves to her. She spins and skates off full-speed. Max watches her go. Silence.
MAX
You set me up.
Dirk nods. Max says wistfully:
MAX
Not bad, not bad. The child has become the father of the man.
Max looks out across the frozen pond. He pulls off his ski cap and feels the cold air against his cheeks. Snowflakes catch in his eyelashes.
MAX
We might have to get some hockey skates, Dirk.
DIRK
I already got you some.
Dirk reaches into his backpack and takes out a pair of skates. He hands them to Max. Max looks at them for a minute. He nods slowly. Something begins to change in his face. He says with quiet intensity:
MAX
Do me a favor, will you?
DIRK
Sure. What?
MAX
(pause)
Pack up your goddamn tackle box.
Dirk smiles. Max grabs Dirk's fig pole and starts walking. Dirk calls after him:
DIRK
You sure you don't want to stay here and feel sorry for yourself?
MAX
I'll take a rain check.
Dirk grabs his tackle box and follows Max briskly off the ice.
Mr. Blume stands on the sidewalk in front of the barbershop. He stares off into the distance. He has his hands in his pockets and his hair is blowing in the wind.
Mr. Fischer is inside reading the sports page.
A cab pulls up and splashes water on Mr. Blume, but he does not appear to notice. Max gets out of the cab. He is dressed in a beautiful green velvet suit and bow tie. He smiles.
MAX
Thanks for meeting me, Mr. Blume.
MR. BLUME
What can I do for you?
Max hands Mr. Blume a little white cardboard box. Mr. Blume frowns.
MR. BLUME
What's this?
Max shrugs. Mr. Blume starts to open the box. Max flinches away like the box is going to explode. Mr. Blume stops. Max smiles and motions for Mr. Blume to go ahead. Mr. Blume opens the box. There are two little pins inside.
MAX
That's the Perfect Attendance awards and the Punctuality Award. I got those at Rushmore. I thought you could choose which one you like more, and you could wear that one and I could wear the other.
Mr. Blume's face softens. He nods slowly. He studies the pins and says quietly:
MR. BLUME
I'll take punctuality.
MAX
OK.
They put their pins in their lapels.
MR. BLUME
Thank you.
Max nods. He smiles.
MAX
Come on. Let's go inside.
Max motions to the barbershop. Mr. Blume looks confused.
Max and Mr. Blume come out of the barbershop and walk quickly down the sidewalk. Mr. Blume's hair is crisply cut and neatly combed, but his clothes still look very disheveled.
MAX
How much are you worth, by the way?
MR. BLUME
I don't know.
MAX
Over ten million?
MR. BLUME
Yeah. I guess so.
MAX
Good, good.
MR. BLUME
Why?
MAX
Cause we're going to need all of it.
DECEMBER MONTAGE:
Christmas decorations are evident throughout the following scenes.
Max and Mr. Blume watch a Jacques Cousteau film on 16mm in Mr. Blume's office. Ernie runs the projector.
Max and Mr. Blume visit a marine research facility. Mr. Blume holds up a fish at the edge of a pool. A killer whale jumps out of the water and takes it in its teeth.
Max and Mr. Blume sprint down the street and through the park in warm-up suits. They hurdle bushes and dodge traffic. They run into an empty football stadium and race up the bleachers.
Max's young architect shows Max and Mr. Blume a miniature baseball diamond field. The architect slides over the diamond an inch and puts model of a building labeled The Cousteau-Blume Marine Observatory in its place.
Max and Dirk skate around on the frozen pond during complicated tricks and jumps.
A large crowd of Rushmore student, parents and faculty has gathered around the vacant lot beside the baseball field. A huge banner says The Cousteau-Blume Marine Observatory. There is a huge bulldozer and a cement truck at the back of the lot.
Max and Mr. Blume shake hands for the yearbook photographer. Mr. Blume is holding a gold shovel with a ribbon around it.
MR. BLUME
She's not coming, is she?
MAX
(pause)
It doesn't look good.
MR. BLUME
Ah, shit, man. What the hell am I doing here?
Mr. Blume throws down his shovel and starts to walk off. Max yells at him:
MAX
Dammit, Blume! How the hell did you ever get so rich? You're a quitter!
Mr. Blume looks at Max in shock.
MR. BLUME
This cost me eight million dollars!
MAX
(hesitates)
And that's all you're prepared to spend?
Silence.
Max carries as old leather typewriter case in the backyard. He sets it down on a picnic table. The case has an inscription on it in gold letters.
INSERT TYPEWRITER CASE:
Bravo, Max! Love, Mom.
Max unzips the case. There is an old portable manual typewriter inside. Max rolls a piece of paper into it and starts typing furiously. He pauses to drink a sip of hot chocolate. He starts typing again.
TITLE:
January.
Webster Smalley is Rushmore's sister school. The doors to the lower school burst open and twenty-five first-grade girls in plaid jumpers run yelling onto the playground.
Miss Cross comes out of the building after the girls. She sees Max coming down the hill in his green suit.
MISS CROSS
I like your suit.
MAX
Thanks.
MISS CROSS
Is that velvet?
Max nods. Miss Cross feels his lapel. It has a Perfect Attendance Award pin in it.
MAX
Sorry you couldn't make it to our little groundbreaking the other day. It's kind of a shame, since he's building it for you.
MISS CROSS
Well, you know, I never asked anybody to build me an aquarium. I'm not sure how that rumor got started.
MAX
Hm. Me, neither. You think Edward Appleby would've built you one?
Miss Cross thinks for a minute. She sounds surprised at her on response.
MISS CROSS
Yeah. He probably would've. If he had the money.
MAX
(smiles)
That's what I thought. Blume's got a little more spark and vitality than you expected, doesn't he?
MISS CROSS
But the aquarium was your idea.
Max smiles and shrugs his shoulder.
MAX
Well, I gave it to my friend.
Max turns and starts walking away. He looks back over his shoulder and says:
MAX
By the way, I still haven't fucked anybody yet. But I guess that's just the way it goes.
Miss Cross smiles sadly.
INSERT TEACHER' MAILBOXES:
A cabinet of little slots where teachers get their mail and memos. Someone puts a little envelope into the slot marked Rosemary Cross.
Dirk comes out of a hiding place in the bushes as Max walks over with the dynamite. Dirk is holding a pellet gun.
MAX
Make sure these don't get wet.
Max hands Dirk the boxes and takes the pellet gun.
MAX
I'll see you at 3:15.
Max starts walking away down the sidewalk.
DIRK
Where you going?
MAX
9without stopping)
Rushmore. I got one last piece of unfinished business I got to attend to.
Max pumps his pellet gun shot about twenty times. He raises the stock to his shoulder as Magnus Buchan walks onto the quadrangle. He draws a bead on him and follows him in his sight as he passes be. He fires.
Magnus screams and grabs his only good ear. He spins around and sees Max cocking a pellet gun.
MAGNUS
Fischer! Ya fuck!
MAX
Hello, Magnus. I'd have shot you in the other ear, but it got blown off a long time ago.
Magnus starts to come at Max. Max points his weapon at him.
MAX
Not so fast.
Magnus stops.
MAX
I owed you that one. Now we're even.
MAGNUS
(smiles crookedly)
Not for long, kemosabe.
MAX
(shrugs)
We'll see.
Silence. Max holds Magnus at gunpoint.
MAX
I got a proposition for you.
MAGNUS
Shove it up your mother's arse, ya little prick.
MAX
I've got to hand it to you, Magnus. You've got a way with words. You want to be in a play?
MAGNUS
(puzzled)
Don't piss with me, Fischer.
MAX
I'm not pissing with you.
(reaching in his backpack)
I brought you a script.
Max hands Magnus a script with a red cover.
MAGNUS
What's all this shite?
MAX
Nothing. I just think you're right for the part.
Magnus stares at Max. He says quietly:
MAGNUS
I always wanted to be in one of those frickin' plays of yours.
MAX
I know you did, mate.
Magnus looks at the script.
INSERT COVER OF PLAY:
HEAVEN AND HELL
a new play by Max Fischer
revised draft
Dramatists Guild registered
The lobby of the auditorium is buzzing with people talking about the play and having drinks.
Mr. Blume is standing alone outside, smoking a cigarette. It is snowing softly. Miss Cross comes out with a cup of coffee in each hand. Mr. Blume turns around and looks at her.
She goes over to him and hands him one of the coffees.
MR. BLUME
(sadly)
Thank you.
MISS CROSS
Hold this one, too, Herman.
He holds both coffees while Miss Cross pours some little containers of cream into then and stirs them with a plastic straw. She takes back her cup of coffee.
MISS CROSS
So what do you think of Max's latest opus?
Mr. Blume gives a thumbs up and stares out into the snow.
MR. BLUME
Let's just hope it's got a happy ending.
Miss Cross smiles. She smoothes her hand across Mr. Blume's hair. He looks into her eyes. She links arms wit him gently and they drink their coffees together.
