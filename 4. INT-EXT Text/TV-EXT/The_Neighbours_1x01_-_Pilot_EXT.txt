      We drift away from EARTH, past the planets which grammar 
        school made us familiar with.  And then beyond.  A left 
        turn.  A sharp right.  See ya, Pluto.  Then:  A PLANET.

        CHYRON: 2001



        We re outside the CONDO DEVELOPMENT from the commercial. 

        CHYRON: TEN YEARS LATER



        A SPACESHIP takes off. PAN DOWN to the Odd Man, watching.  
        A hand tugs his shirt.  He looks down: an ODD LITTLE BOY.

                                        LITTLE BOY
                      Father, if they sold their unit, it means 
                      humans will move in.  What will we do?

                                        MAN
                      Let us see who it is who comes, my Son. 
                      Only then might we have reason to worry.



        A MOVING VAN is parked out front.

        CHYRON: YESTERDAY

        TIGHT ON the tear-streaked face of AMBER WEAVER (16).  

                                        AMBER
                      THIS BLOWS!  THIS TOTALLY BLOWS!

        Amber screams again abnormally, clears frame. Two 
        children enter: MAX WEAVER (9) and ABBY WEAVER (7). 

                                        ABBY
                      Mom!  Max told me to shut up!

                                        WOMAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                      Don t say shut up, Max.

      They clear frame, DEBBIE WEAVER (early 40 s) enters.                                                                                      4.




                                        MAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                      Kids, give your mother a break, okay?

        Debbie shoots a glare backwards.

                                        DEBBIE
                      Oh, shut up.

        She clears and MARTY WEAVER enters, early 40 s and 
        sweating like a mother-fucker.  He s carrying boxes.

                                        MARTY
                      I may be the bad guy now but you ll be 
                      thanking me soon. It has a golf course!

                                        AMBER (O.S.)
                      I HATE YOU!

        Marty loads boxes in, closes the trunk. He looks upwards.

                                        MARTY
                      Please God: help me out here.  No leaky 
                      faucets.  And no termites, okay?
                                (beat, then)
                      Oh, and let the neighbors be normal.

      As he gets in and takes pulls out toward the New Jersey 
        Turnpike we CUE:

              

                         TITLE CARD                                                                                      5.





        The family emerges. Out front stands the ENTIRE COMMUNITY 
        (standing in front of their golf carts).  Everyone holds 
        a PIE.  They just stand there.

                                        DEBBIE
                      Hello.

                                        TOWN
                              (in unison)
                      Hello.

        The ODD MAN from earlier approaches, hands Debbie a pie.  
        Marty extends his hand.

                                        MARTY
                      How ya  doin .  Marty Weaver.

        The man mirrors Marty, sticking out his hand (but not 
        shaking).  His hand will remain outstretched for a while.                                                                                      7.




                                        ODD MAN
                      I am Wilt Chamberlain, leader of this 
                      community and immediate neighbor to your 
                      west.  We bring you pie, as is your 
                      custom, as a gift of welcome.

        Debbie and Marty share a look. Town members begin lining 
        up, bowing and piling pies in their arms.  

                                        WILT
                      I will familiarize you with my family and 
                      we will take our leave.
                                (then, loudly)
                      WIFE!  STEP FORWARD!

      They JUMP, startled. His WIFE (seen earlier) steps up.

                                        WILT (CONT D)
                      My wife, Jackie Joyner-Kersee.

        Marty and Debbie LAUGH, stop short when no one else does. 

                                        DEBBIE
                      Hi, Jackie.  Joyner-Kersee.  I m Debbie.  

        Debbie extends her hand, Jackie Joyner-Kersee extends 
      hers (again not shaking, just holding it there). Debbie 
        awkwardly changes topics.

                                        DEBBIE (CONT D)
                      Is that your little boy?

        Hiding behind her is the ODD BOY we met earlier. 

                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                      Our youngest, Lennox Lewis.

        Debbie s doing her best to keep it together.

                                        DEBBIE
                      Of course. Max, maybe you can be friends?

        Max steps forward, eyes him suspiciously

                                        MAX
                      You into Barbie dolls or boogers or 
                      anything weird?

                                        LENNOX
                      No.

                                        MAX
                      He ll do.                                                                                      8.




      They run off together.  Abby follows.  

                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN
                      My gratitude.  It has been difficult for 
                      Lennox to make friends.

                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                                (explaining)
                      Thus far we are the only family in this 
                      development to have bred.

        Debbie nods, lost.  Amber EMERGES, a picture of 
        sadolescent insanity.

                                        MARTY
                                (awkward segue)
                      And speaking of breeding, here s our 
                      oldest, Amber.  Amber say hello.

                                        AMBER
                      I can t find my I-pod. I NEED MY I-POD!

        And like that, she returns inside. 

                                        MARTY
                      She scares the hell out of us.

                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                                (waving him off)
                      We too bear the burden of an unhappy 
                      teenager.  

        She points up at the window of the townhouse next door. 
        Looking out is a handsome, ASIAN TEENAGER.

                                        WILT
                      Our eldest, Joe Montana.

        Marty begins LAUGHING.

                                        MARTY
                      Joe Montana.
                              (off their looks)
                      Fun.  Another fun name.  

                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN
                      Tomorrow you dine with us, a display of 
                      neighborly hospitality. But now, we take 
                      our leave. 

                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                      COMMUNITY DISPERSE!                                                                                      9.




        The crowd departs instantly, leaving them holding huge 
        stacks of pies, confused.

                                        MARTY
                      They seemed nice, no?

                                        DEBBIE
                      Marty, I swear to God, if you set up some 
                      kind of candid camera thing thinking it 
                      would be funny--

                                        MARTY
                      I didn t.

                                        DEBBIE
                      Okay. So we re just living amidst a cult 
                      of golf-cart-driving pie-makers with the 
                      names of pro athletes?  Marty, seriously, 
                      what are we gonna do?

                                        MARTY
                      We ll make it work. I ll buy a golf cart, 
                      you can legally change your name to 
                      Martina Navratalova, it s all good.  

        Despite herself, Debbie LAUGHS. Even when fighting, you 
      love these two together.  Marty takes her hand.

                                        MARTY (CONT D)
                      I m sure there s an explanation.  Let s 
                      have dinner with them tomorrow.  Give 
                      them a chance at least.  Okay?

        Debbie nods, still wary.

                                        DEBBIE
                      Dinner better not be weird.  



        Dinner.  Yep, it s weird.  There are full plates of food 
      in front of Marty s family but the plates in front of 
        Wilt s family are topped by... well, BOOKS.  They re 
        reading while the Weavers eat.  Again: weird.

                                        DEBBIE
                      Dinner is wonderful, Jackie.  But it 
                      feels a bit... strange, you know, that 
                      only our family is eating.                                                                                    10.




                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                      We receive nourishment through our eyes 
                      and mind, rather than our mouths. 
                                (then, noticing)
                      Joe Montana, why aren t you reading?

                                        JOE MONTANA
                      I m not hungry.

        Weird.  Marty and Debbie share a look.

                                        WILT
                      As is customary, the leader of the host 
                      family will now direct a toast of 
                      welcome.  FAMILY, WE TOAST!

      In unison: Wilt s family snap their fingers, bang twice 
      on the table, stomp their feet once, pull on their ears, 
        and shout...  HEAR OUR CALL, WHOOP-WHOOP  and bang their 
        fists on the table one last time.  

        Then, they immediately resume eating (well, reading).  
        Marty and Debbie look on, horrified.  MAX STANDS.

                                        MAX
                      Me and Lennox want to go play.

                                        LENNOX
                      Father?  May I be excused?

                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN
                      You may go.

                                        MARTY
                                (trying)
                      Maxwell, do you wish to be excused?

        Max FAKE FARTS.  He and Abby crack up.

                                        MAX
                      Excuse me.

                                        MARTY
                      You may go.

        The kids all run off.  Amber STANDS, grabs Joe.

                                        AMBER
                      We re going upstairs.

        Joe looks to his parents who NOD.  He follows Amber.                                                                                    11.




                                        AMBER (CONT D)
                      Can I grab a soda or something?

        She opens the fridge, it s filled to the brim with BOOKS.

                                        JOE MONTANA
                      No.

      He closes it.  Back to the table, Marty changes topics: 

                                        MARTY
                      I can trust your son upstairs with my 
                      little girl, right?

                                        WILT CHAMBERLAIN
                      Worry not.  My son is incapable of 
                      breeding with your daughter.

                                        MARTY
                      Good enough for me.  Pass the potatoes?

        Jackie Joyner-Kersee STANDS.

                                        JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                      Debbie, let us excuse ourselves and do 
                      dishes while our men converse like men.

        Debbie LAUGHS, then realizes she s serious.

                                        DEBBIE
                      Oh.  Okay.

        She raises a brow at Marty and follows her out...



        The family stands at the window, looking out.  A NEIGHBOR 
        waters his lawn (well, he s not really watering it, he s 
      more just shooting a hose up in the air and drenching 
        himself).  He catches them looking and WAVES. Caught, 
      they wave back.  Marty rips the blinds closed.  

                                        MARTY
                      Okay, the point of this family conference 
                      is to decide what to do.

                                        AMBER
                      ABOUT LIVING WITH ALIENS?  THIS IS SO 
                      RETARDED!

                                        MAX
                      I m not going to school.

                                        MARTY
                      Why not?

                                        MAX
                      What if the aliens come and eat Mommy?

                                        ABBY
                      Yeah, what if the aliens come and eat 
                      Mommy?

                                        MARTY
                      What about me?  What if the aliens come 
                      and eat Daddy?

        The kids shrug. The DOORBELL RINGS.  Everyone freezes.  
        Marty CROSSES himself and opens the door, revealing...

        LENNOX LEWIS.  All 4 10 of him.  He wears a backpack.  
        Marty, flustered, backs up quickly, TRIPPING over a box.  

                                        LENNOX
                      I convinced my parental unit to enroll me 
                      in school! I wondered if Max and Abby 
                      might take the bus with me. I know not 
                      how.

        Max steps in front of his sister.                                                                                    20.




                                        MAX
                      Stay away from my sister you freak!

        Lennox s face drops.

                                        LENNOX
                      Oh.  My apologies.  
                              (a beat, then)
                      I m sure I can figure it out.

        Lennox turns to go, wounded.  Debbie softens.

                                        DEBBIE
                      No, no, no.  Lennox, wait a second.

        Debbie APPROACHES Lennox.  Unsure of how to touch him, 
        she gingerly places a hand on his shoulder.

                                        DEBBIE (CONT D)
                      Max, apologize.

                                        MAX
                      He s an alien, Mom! 

                                        DEBBIE
                      Well, he may be, but I did not raise you 
                      to be rude to anyone - even aliens.
                                (then)
                      Abby, Max, go to the bus with Lennox.  
                      Your father and I need to talk. 

        Max takes Abby s hand. He steps up to Lennox, protective.  

                                        MAX
                      I box on the Wii like six hours a day.  
                      You do not want to mess with us, Son.  

        The children EXIT, leaving Amber behind with her parents.

                                        AMBER
                              (as if on phone)
                      Hi, child services, I d like to report my 
                      parents.  They just sent their seven and 
                      nine year old to school with an alien.  
                                (screaming)
                      What s wrong with you!? They drip goo and-

                                        JOE MONTANA (O.S.)
                      You look amazing, Amber.  You will be the 
                      most desired girl in all the high school.

      At the door stands Joe Montana.  Amber turns on a dime.                                                                                    21.




                                        AMBER
                      Peace out bitches.

      Like that she EXITS, leaving Debbie and Marty alone.

                                        MARTY
                      You see?  The kids are fine.  Once you 
                      get past the initial shock of things--

                                        DEBBIE
                      Tell me you re kidding.

                                        MARTY
                      Honey: they re peace-loving aliens!

                                        DEBBIE
                      So if they were warmonger aliens we d be 
                      leaving, but since they re peace-loving--

                                        MARTY
                      I m just asking we be rational here. 
                      Mortgage rates are way up since we 
                      bought, we can t afford this square 
                      footage anywhere else.  I don t even know 
                      where we d start again--  

                                        DEBBIE
                      So we re stuck, is that it?  Fantastic. 
                      The one time you make a decision on your 
                      own...

        She trails off.  Marty STIFFENS, challenged.

                                        MARTY
                      You wanted me to take initiative, well 
                      here you go: I m the man of the house and 
                      you re my wife and you ll do what I tell 
                      you!  WE RE STAYING.

        Debbie s eyes practically roll back in her head.  Marty 
        realizes what he s done.

                                        MARTY (CONT D)
                      Unless you don t want to stay.  We can 
                      talk about it.
