  MARY AND PETER, (4O'S, DASHINGLY HANDSOME, CLOONEY-ESQUE), 
  KISS AGAINST A ROMANTIC BACKDROP.  OTHERS MILL ABOUT.  

                                        MARY

                  This is so romantic...

  THEY KISS AGAIN.  BEHIND THEM, A YOUNG MANIS ON HIS KNEES 
  IN FRONT OF A WOMAN, ASKING HER TO MARRY HIM IN FRENCH.

                                        BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

                  Oui! Jet'aime! 

  THE FRENCH COUPLE HUG.  MARY TURNS BACK TO PETER.

                                        MARY

                  So, you brought me up here to give me 

                  something?

  HE PRODUCES A BEAUTIFULLY ADORNED BAG FROM HIS POCKET.

                                        PETER

                  Yes.  I just wanted to--

                                        MARY

                  (OFF BAG) I do.

                                        PETER

                  You do what?

                                        MARY

                  I dowant to open it.

  SHE OPENS THE BAG.  WE SEE THAT IT IS MARZIPAN IN THE SHAPE 
  OF A FILM CAMERA.  MARY'S FACE DROPS."Accidentally on Purpose"3.


                                        MARY (CONT'D)

                  What the hell?

                                        PETER

                  It's marzipan.  In the shape of a camera.  

                  Because you're a film critic... the best 

                  one at my paper.  What did you think it 

                  was going to be?

  FINGER.

                                        ANOTHER WOMAN

                  (TO MAN) Yah! Yah! Ichliebedich.

  THE WOMAN THROWS HER ARMS AROUND HIM.

                                        MARY

                  Oh, I don't know... (POINTING TO HAPPY 

                  COUPLE) that?  

                                        PETER

                  Do you know how hard it is to find 

                  marzipan in the shape of a camera?  

                  They had to create a mold!

                                        MARY

                  It's never going to go further between 

                  us, is it?  (THEN) Good bye.

  MARY WALKS TWO FEET TO THE ELEVATOR AND FRANTICALLY PRESSES 
  THE BUTTON.  THE NEW FIANCEES GIVE PETER THE STINK EYE.


  MARY GRABS A TOWEL, NOTICES IT'S FILTHY, THROWS IT ON THE 
  FLOOR.  SHE GRABS HER CELL PHONE OUT OF HER PURSE. 
  INTERCUTTO REVEAL LIZA IN A CAB.  

                                        LIZA

                  (INTO PHONE) What.

                                        MARY

                  (SOTTO, URGENT) That guy I went home 

                  with kissed me and I can't tell if I 

                  should sleep with him.  I'm in a 

                  fragile state.

                                        LIZA

                  Perfect.  That's the best time to have 

                  a one night stand.

  MARY TAKES OFF HER PANTS AND STRUGGLES TO REMOVE HER SPANX.

                                        MARY

                  I think he may be significantly younger 

                  than me.  I can't tell if this 

                  situation is empowering or pathetic."Accidentally on Purpose"18.


                                        LIZA

                  Can you see cameras?  Will money be 

                  exchanging hands?  Is there a midget 

                  involved?  

  MARY STUFFS HER SPANXINTO HER PURSE, INSPECTS HERSELF IN 
  THE MIRROR.  YIKES, WHAT IS SHE DOING?  MATT KNOCKS ON THE 
  DOOR.

                                        MATT (O.C.)

                  Are you okay in there?

  MARY OPENS THE DOOR.

                                        MARY

                  I'm sorry.  It's just, I'm not a one 

                  night stand kind of person, you know?  

                  I never do things like this.  

                                        MATT 

                  Yeah, but... lots of people say they'll 

                  never do things and then they do them.

  SHE GRABS HIM.  THEY KISS AND FUMBLE THEIR WAY THROUGH OUT 
  THE APARTMENT, FINALLY WINDING UP IN MATT'S BEDROOM.  THEY 
  HAVE TO PAUSE WHILE HE KICKS A PATHWAY THROUGH ALL OF THE 
  DIRTY CLOTHES AND PUTS HIS FUTON INTO THE BED POSITION.  
  FROM MARY'S PURSE ON THE FLOOR NEARBY WE HEAR:

                                        SCENE 4


  WE FIND MARY, AWAKE; QUIETLY GETTING DRESSED TO FLEE BEFORE 
  MATT WAKES UP.  SHE SCRIBBLES A NOTE FOR HIM, PUTS IT ON 
  HIS HEAD.


  OUTSIDE THE RESTAURANT WHERE MATT WORKS, MARY SITS ON THE 
  STAIRS.  MEXICAN BUSBOYSGO IN AND OUT.  MATT, WEARING HIS 
  COOK JACKET, HANDS MARY A PLATE AND UTENSILS.  

                                        MATT

                  Tonight's special.  I made it, and I'm 

                  still not sure what it is.

                                        MARY

                  (KEEPING IT LIGHT) If I'd known this place 

                  was going to be so fancy, I would've worn 

                  underwear.  

                                        MATT

                  Me too.  So what's up?

                                        MARY 

                  Matt, sometimes when two people like each 

                  other things happen they don't expect... 

                  even though they should have expected it 

                  because they're certainly old enough.  

                  But it's too late to beat ourselves up 

                  for that now...

                                        MATT

                  Did you, like, give me herpes?

                                        MARY

                  God, I hope not.

                                        MATT

                  Oh good.  Did I give it to you?"Accidentally on Purpose"27.


                                        MARY

                  What?  No.  I mean, what?  Matt, I'm 

                  pregnant.

  MATT CHOKES ON HIS BEER, COUGHS, RECOVERS.

                                        MARY (CONT'D)

                  Are you okay?

                                        MATT

                  I think so.  Is it normal to have to 

                  remind yourself to breathe?

                                        MARY

                  This doesn't have to be overwhelming.  

                  You could be involved& you could notbe 

                  involved.  You could give me money... 

                  you could notgive me money.  You could 

                  not be involved and not give me money&  

                                        MATT

                  I wantto be involved.  I wantto give you 

                  money.  I don't have any currently...

                                        MARY

                  Are you sure?  It's such a big 

                    responsibility and you're so young. 

                                        MATT

                  Yeah, yeah... I'm "young."  I wasn't 

                  born when Kennedy was shot.

                                        MATT

                  Look, my dad kind of walked out on me. 

                  I used to think it was 'cause I'd done 

                  something wrong, you know?  I can't 

                  stand to think there'dbe some little 

                  kid out there wondering why his dad 

                  didn't love him.  

                                        MARY

                  (TAKING HIS HAND) I'm so sorry.

                                        MATT

                  Yeah.  (THEN) So, what do we do first? 

                                        MARY

                  Well, you can come with me to my first 

                  doctor's appointment.

                                        MATT

                  I'll do better than that.  I'll drive

                  I thought you were living with Davis.

                  Oh that's not permanent.  He's looking 

                  for a very specific type of roommate.  

                  You know, one with money.  (OFF HER
