      The SUN SHINES over a quiet, exquisite stretch of Alabama 
      coastline.  Out on the water, FISHERMEN pull in the morning s 
      catch.  A LONE PELICAN takes off from the water.  We FOLLOW 
      IT to A GREYHOUND BUS winding down the seaside road.


      It s graduation day, proud near-doctors, prouder parents. 

                                  ZOE'S VOICE
                    Four years ago, I graduated from 
                    Johns Hopkins Medical School at the 
                    top of my class. 

      CLOSE ON a YOUNGER ZOE, poised, supremely confident, clearly 
      a star, making a commencement speech from a podium.

                                  ZOE
                    The first time I held a scalpel, I 
                    was nine.  We were hosting a party 
                    for some of my mother s celebrity 
                    clients.  While the chef prepared 
                    squab for Calista Flockhart and Bono, 
                    my dad and I snuck off and dissected 
                    ours.  I was enthralled.  My mother, 
                    as you can imagine, was apoplectic...

      As the AUDIENCE CHUCKLES, we FIND Zoe s mom, CANDACE, a high-
      powered publicist, with her young, vapid, MODEL BOYFRIEND.  

                                  MODEL BOYFRIEND
                    You were worried she d cut herself?

                                    CANDACE
                    I was worried about this.  That my 
                    beautiful daughter would follow in 
                    the steps of her withholding, weasel 
                    of a father. What kind of life is 
                    surgery?   Slicing people open a 
                    hundred hours a week under florescent 
                    lights?  And lord knows what it ll do 
                    to her skin.  

                                  MODEL BOYFRIEND
                    Good point.

      As Candace fixes his collar, AT THE PODIUM, Zoe concludes her 
      speech.

                    It was a big night for me, because I 
                    also got to meet my hero, Mets great 
                    Dwight Gooden.  I was nine, shy, 
                    small talk was beyond me.  But if Doc 
                    Gooden were here today, I'd tell him 
                    that being a great surgeon is a lot 
                    like being a great pitcher.

                    To succeed you need to treat the 
                    patient like a batter at the plate - 
                    diagnose the conditions, focus on 
                      precision... and do your best to shut 
                    him out. 

      As we CUT TO a slightly bewildered crowd. 

                                  ZOE'S VOICE
                    Some future pediatricians might have 
                    thought my speech was a little 
                    callous.

      DISSOLVE TIME as Zoe is congratulated by a group of young 
      surgeons -  all slightly better looking, better dressed, and 
      more intimidating than the other graduates -  including Zoe s 
      HANDSOME BOYFRIEND, and BEST FRIEND...  

                                  ZOE'S VOICE (CONT D)
                    But the real doctors, the surgeons, 
                    totally got my point.  And I even got 
                    a groupie out of it.  

      As the graduates celebrate, a sweet Southern man, HARLEY 
      WILKES, 60, in bow tie and hat, calls out to Zoe. 

                                  HARLEY WILKES
                    Dr. Hart?  That was quite a speech.  
                    It showed a lot of... hubris. 

                                  ZOE

                    My last name is Hart, it s like 
                      predestined. So, though your offer is 
                    so sweet, dealing with diarrhea and 
                    diaper rash just isn t my thing.  But 
                    thanks!  Really. Glad you liked my 
                    speech.

      A slightly hurt Harley watches as Zoe runs over to Candace 
      and her model boyfriend.  Candace gives her a perfunctory hug 
      as Zoe looks around, hopeful --

                    So, where s Dad?

                                    CANDACE
                    Sorry, honey, you know him.  Stuck in 
                    Germany.  Some diplomatic needed a 
                    pacemaker put in.  His assistant sent 
                    you a congratulatory fax, though. 

      Zoe s disquieted for a moment, but recovers as her BOYFRIEND 
      and BEST FRIEND join the group... She kisses them both as--

                                  ZOE'S VOICE
                    I had it all: the most amazing 
                    boyfriend and a kick ass BFF who were 
                    just as driven as I was.  Best part 
                    was, the three of us all landed the 
                    same residency program.


      As Zoe talks on the phone...a handwritten list of cities sits 
      on her lap.                                                                                          8


                                  ZOE
                    So, to clarify, there s no general 
                    practice jobs in the entire Baltimore 
                    area?   Why d I even go to your

                          (then)
                    Sorry, dean. 

      Zoe hangs up, scratches off DC and Baltimore, the last cities 
      left on her list.  She SIGHS takes out her wallet and looks 
      at a PICTURE of her, maybe 6, in a DOCTOR'S OUTFIT, sitting 
      on her DAD'S lap, in his DOCTOR'S OUTFIT.  She makes a call.

                    Daddy!  Hi. No... I didn t get the 
                      fellowship.  NO, it s okay.  
                    Actually, the chief said I m a shoo-
                    in for next year... Just need to 
                    figure some things out first. I will!  
                    Trust me Dad, I ll get it. Then look 
                    out - cause you might have a partner!  
                          (then, chastened)
                    No, right.  I know it s not as easy 
                    as that... Oh, okay.  You go.  I lo--
                          (he hangs up.  Dial tone)
                    --Love you, Daddy.

      And off Zoe, looking down at the phone... She begins to walk.

                                  ZOE'S VOICE
                    I was 28.  Staring down the barrel at 
                    30, the thing I d worked for my 
                    entire life was in danger of never 
                    becoming a reality. I had no fianc , 
                    no friends.  

      It begins to RAIN.  Zoe, runs to the bus stop, SLIPS on the 
      wet sidewalk and FALLS... And, NO ONE OFFERS TO HELP HER UP.  

                                  ZOE'S VOICE (CONT D)
                    I was alone in New York City, the 
                    loneliest place in the world.  Or 
                    maybe not exactly&  alone. 


      The bus pulls away, leaving Zoe and her Hermes luggage by the 
      side of a cow field.  A SIGN points down a narrow road, 
      reading  BlueBell 3 Mi 

                                  ZOE
                    And when I say it wasn't New York, it 
                    REALLY wasn't New York. Which is 
                    probably why there weren't any taxis. 


      Zoe rolls her suitcase down the road to town in her Prada 
      heels and pencil skirt.  It's hot, she sweats and swats at 
      mosquitoes.  A car pulls up beside her.  Handsome, charming, 
      GEORGE TUCKER, 30, rolls down the window.                                                                                        10

                    Thank you, but I have a strict policy 
                    about not letting strangers chop me 
                    up into a million pieces. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Sure, I get that.  If it helps, I m 
                    an attorney, not an axe murderer.  
                          (off her scowl)
                    Suit yourself, but it's 96 degrees 
                    out, and you have two more miles to 
                    go until you hit town.

                    Don t get any ideas.

      And as she watches George Tucker gallantly open her door and 
      take her bags--


      Zoe takes in the QUAINT SMALL TOWN SQUARE.  In THE GAZEBO, a 
      GROUP OF WOMEN rehearse a SPANISH WALTZ in actual antebellum 
      SCARLET O'HARA DRESSES.

                    the Pierre any time.  I m George 
                    Tucker. 

      He holds out his hand, as they touch, Zoe s flustered by the 
      clear chemistry. She looks up in his deep blue eyes...

                                  ZOE
                    Zoe, uh, Dr. Zoe Hart.

      George reacts to the name...  But decides not to go there...

                                  GEORGE
                    Good luck, Dr. Zoe Hart.  I hope you 
                    find what you re looking for.  

      He smiles and walks away.


      As Zoe comes upon an old-fashioned sign that reads,  Doctor s 
      Office  she takes out her phone, a deep breathe.

                                  ZOE

                    365 days. 

      Zoe shakes her head, can t believe it, and enters-                                                                                        12



      Mrs. Hattenbarger and Zoe walk through what amounts to 
      downtown BlueBell.  It s super-cute, oozing with southern 
      charm. Little shops.  A town square with a bandstand and a 
      statue of a Confederate hero.  A stone s throw from the 
      fishing docks and Mobile Bay.

                    Well, it s beyond weird.  Why would

                    like a minute and a half, his medical 
                    practice?

      Mrs. H considers for a moment, she may know more but--

                                  MRS. H
                    Harley never explained.  His will

                      postcards, that eventually you d show

      They approach the local watering hole, The Rammer Jammer.

                    He may have been right.  But clearly 
                    the man was one avocado short of a

                    I haven t eaten since JFK.  Maybe we 
                    can just get something to go?

      They enter.


      Zoe pulls a power bar out of her bag as she purposefully 
      strides back through town.  An annoyed Mrs. H follows.

                    stupid!  And dancing in celebration 
                    of the confederacy?  Really?

      Mrs. Hattenbarger doesn t think much of the Blue Belle s 
      either, but she won t tolerate disrespect, whispering.

                                  MRS. HATTENBARGER
                    Dr. Hart, the Blue Belles are an 
                      institution here.  Elite young ladies 
                    chosen to keep our history alive.  
                    For better or worse, they re the 
                    closest thing we have to royalty.

                                  ZOE
                    The Blue Belles?  Emmeline, come on.

                                  MRS. HATTENBARGER
                    You can call me Mrs. Hattenbarger.  
                    And mock all you want, but my husband 
                    got the satellite last year, we ve 
                    seen every episode of The Sopranos.  
                    And believe me, that family s got 
                    nothing on these girls.  

      Just then, one of the Blue Belles, a beautiful young woman in 
      a floofy yellow dress, LEMON BREELAND, waves and comes 
      over... overly effusive. 

                                  LEMON
                    When I heard there was a new lady 
                    doctor in town, I painted myself 
                    quite a different picture.  You're 
                    pretty! 

      Zoe gives Mrs. H a look,  See? They re nice.   Mrs. H smirks.                                                                                        16


                                  MRS. HATTENBARGER
                    Zoe.  This is Lemon Breeland.

                                  ZOE
                    Brick s daughter?  Nice to meet you.  
                    I m dying to talk to your dad, I know 
                    he s hunting or whatever, but you 
                    must have a way to contact him.

                                  LEMON
                    Oh, there s no need for that.  He 
                    knows you re here.  And if I were 
                    you, I d be gone by the time he 
                    returns.  Daddy can be quite... 
                    imposing.   

      Zoe s stunned, then angered, by the sweetly delivered threat.

                                  ZOE
                    Well, you tell daddy that if my 
                    medical career hasn t been killed by 
                    my mother - the second most powerful 
                    publicist on the East Coast, or the 
                    chief of surgery at New York/Cornell 
                    hospital, it most certainly won t be 
                    by some Southern xenophobe dressed up 
                    like a stick of butter.

      Zoe looks at Mrs. Hattenbarger, triumphant.

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                    Now, let s go see some patients.

      HARD CUT TO: ZOE SITTING, BORED.  As no patients come.  


      Mrs. H, muttering to herself, gets in her old Dodge and 
      DRIVES OFF as sweet OLD MAN JACKSON, 80s in an oversized 
      sweater and glasses, enters the building.  


      A huge ANTEBELLUM PLANTATION HOUSE.  Zoe is met at the door 
      by the mayor, LAVON HAYES, 42.  

                                  ZOE
                    Lavon Hayes?  The linebacker?  Two 
                    Super Bowls!  Five pro bowls!

                                  LAVON
                    Four, actually.

                                  ZOE
                    Rounded up.  You got robbed in  06.

                                  LAVON
                    Lavon Hayes likes your math. C mon 
                    in. 


      Zoe KNOCKS as LOUD MUSIC comes from inside.  Her knocks are 
      ignored, so she opens the door.


      Furious, Zoe stalks back to her carriage house.  And finds 
      herself face to face with... AN ALLIGATOR!

      Zoe SCREAMS.  And walks backward.  And SCREAMS... and falls 
      in the water!

      Suddenly, someone races to her rescue.  He s in the water 
      with a splash and in one smooth motion swoops her up in his 
      arms and deposits her on dry land.                                                                                          23


      In the moonlight, we realize it s GEORGE TUCKER.  Zoe GASPS.  
      Then, speaking through her teeth, so as not to provoke it.

                                  ZOE
                    Wasn t drowning.  There s.  An. 
                      Alligator.

                                  GEORGE
                    Excuse me, a what?  Sorry, must have 
                    gotten some water in the ear there.  

                                  ZOE
                          (pointing at it)
                    An alligator!   

                                  GEORGE
                    An alligator!  Why didn t you say so? 
                    This IS an emergency. 

      He positions himself between it and Zoe.  Zoe clings to him, 
      scared.  As George speaks to the gator, friendly--

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    Beat it, Don.
                          (off Zoe s expression)
                    Don Johnson.   Mayor s pet alligator. 
                    Lavon s a big Miami Vice fan.

      Don starts to walk away, as furious Zoe SHOVES GEORGE.

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    Oh, c mon Brearley.  Just having a 
                    little fun.  
                          (with a grin)
                    And I know you re a New Yorker, but 
                    in Alabama, when someone interrupts 
                    their nightly jog to jump into the 
                    gulf to save our well-toned ass, we 
                    say  thank you. 

                                  ZOE
                          (can t help being charmed)
                    Fine.  Thank you.  

      They stare at each other for a loaded beat.  Then, George 
      seems conflicted...

                                  GEORGE TUCKER
                    Well, I should...

                                  ZOE
                    Sure.  

      Zoe turns to walk away, George hesitates, then, catches up.                                                                                        24


                                  GEORGE TUCKER
                    Then, again, I am a Southern 
                      gentleman, wouldn t be right if I 
                    didn t offer to walk you home, 
                    protect you from any other friendly 
                    reptiles you might encounter?

      Zoe nods, and they head towards the carriage house, walking 
      in silence for a moment on this perfect starry night. Then,

                                  ZOE
                    Listen, uh... I m not looking to make 
                    friends.  I m gonna work, sleep, 
                    maybe read a book.  Hopefully, before 
                    I know it, a year will have passed 
                    and I ll be happily on my way back to 
                    New York.  I don t want distractions. 

      They arrive at Zoe s front porch they have a long loaded 
      moment.  George smiles, perhaps a little sadly.  

                                  GEORGE TUCKER
                    Got it.  Work, sleep, possible book.

      And, he leaves.  Off Zoe, swooning a little.

                                  ZOE (PRELAP)
                    Bluebell isn t that bad.


      Zoe, a sweater over her pajamas, runs to the doctor s office.


      Zoe walks down the street... it s deserted.

                                  ZOE'S VOICE
                    Well, that sucked.  BlueBell was my 
                    one last shot to be a heart surgeon, 
                    Brick was hellbent on driving me out.  
                    And who could blame him -  I d just 
                    gotten someone run over.  In times 
                    like this, I find one thing really 
                    helps me through...                                                                                         32


                                  ZOE (PRELAP)
                      Chardonnay!


      As Zoe steps onto the sidewalk -- a car SCREECHES to a halt 
      next to her.  An apoplectic Lemon gets out.

                                  LEMON
                    How dare you show your face in this 
                    town after what you did?  Do you 
                    realize my engagement party is 
                      tomorrow?!  And what am I supposed to 
                    do?  The photographs!  The whole 
                    thing will be ruined!

                                  ZOE
                      Seriously, Lemon, what are you 
                      blabbering about?                                                                                        34


                                  LEMON
                    Thanks to you my fiance was in a car 
                      accident!!  

      Zoe looks at her, no, it can t be.  Then, hopeful--

                                  ZOE
                    You re engaged to Old Man Jackson?

                                  LEMON
                    Gross!  I m engaged to George Tucker.

      CLOSE ON: Zoe s shocked face.

                                  ZOE'S VOICE
                    Once again, I d been disgraced as a 
                    doctor& once again, the guy I... 
                    liked was with someone else.  


      Walking back home, she sees a CAR, WAVES to get a ride, but 
      as it approaches she realizes it's WADE AND HIS TWO 
        GIRLFRIENDS, he winks at her and she waves away.  

                                  ZOE'S VOICE
                    Things were just as bad in Bluebell 
                    as they were in New York.  Luckily, 
                    they couldn't get worse.


      Mrs. H opens her door (which is just upstairs from the 
      Doctor s Office) to find Candace, holding a cobbler.  

                                  MRS. HATTENBARGER
                    Can I help you?

                                    CANDACE
                    I m Candace Hart, Zoe s mother.  I 
                    bought you a cobbler.  Figured it was 
                    the Southern thing to do.  Can I come 
                    in for a moment?

      Mrs. H is confused, but obliges.                                                                                        39



      The Blue Belles at the door, won t let Rose and Zoe in.                                                                                          41


                                  ZOE
                    But I m a doctor.  This is a medical 
                      emergency!

                                  BLUE BELLE #1
                    Silly, this is Brick Breeland s 
                    house.  He s the Doctor.  

                        ZOEROSE
      What is wrong with you You don t understand the 
        people?situation --  

                                  BLUE BELLE #2
                    Rose Hattenbarger, we know the 
                      situation.  You re fixin  to steal 
                      Magnolia s date.  You two are not 
                    getting in this door.

      Zoe and Rose slump, defeated, when a voice -- 

                                  MALE VOICE  (O.S.)
                    Actually, they re here with me.

      Zoe and Rose turn to find Lavon Hayes, their savior.

                                  LAVON HAYES
                    Lavon Hayes.  Mayor. Think that 
                    entitles me to a plus two.

      Off the stunned Blue Belles, who reluctantly open the door. 


      If Tennessee Williams were alive in 2010, he d write about 
      this.  A huge fancy daytime engagement party. Mint juleps, 
      croquet, outfits in differing pastels.   

      ANGLE the BACK DOOR as Zoe and Rose enter the party with 
      Lavon.  Everyone STARES and WHISPERS - the mayor has just 
      entered with Public Enemies numbers 1 and 2.  But Rose is 
      used to it-

                                  ROSE
                    Gonna look around for Frederick and 
                    try not to get pelted with anything.

      She goes off to find him, while Zoe kisses Lavon s cheek.

                                  ZOE
                    You re the best, I ll go find 
                    Mabel...                                                                                         42


                                  LAVON
                          (looks around, loaded)
                    No need to thank me.  I abhor 
                      discrimination.  Besides, this party 
                    could use some shaking up.  Lavon 
                    Hayes needs a cocktail.

      As Lavon heads toward the bar, stopping to shake hands with  
      various constituents, Zoe looks for Mabel...  ANGLE ON 
      Colleen, Mabel s mother, who s also working the event, 
      obliviously serving hors d oeuvres.

      UNDER A MAGNOLIA TREE decorated in colorful lanterns, Lemon 
      and George talk privately.  

                                  GEORGE
                    I m sorry about the photographs.  I 
                    know how hard you planned today.

                                  LEMON
                      Sweetheart, I don t care about the 
                      pictures...  That much.  
                          (then, with a laugh)
                    I don t know what s become of me.  
                    All the stress from the wedding has 
                    turned me into a Bama beeotch.  
                    But... I love you.  Nearly losing you 
                    last night reminded me just how much. 
                    So, I m gonna try real hard to be the 
                    same old Lemon you fell in love with. 

      And if George is having second thoughts, he doesn t show them 
      here as Lemon KISSES him, LONG AND HARD.  

      Zoe, searching for Mabel, NEARLY CRASHES INTO THEM.  

                  GEORGE TUCKERLEMON
      Zoe?  I thought--What are you doing here?!

                                  ZOE
                          (cold)
                    Oh, I came with the mayor. 

                                  LEMON
                          (weirdly upset)
                    What do you mean?  Lavon?

      George, so uncomfortable, tries to be friendly.

                                  GEORGE TUCKER
                    Well, welcome.  Bar s by the pool.

      Zoe nods with strained politeness and walks away.                                                                                        43


                                  LEMON
                    Thought you said she was leaving 
                    town.

                                  GEORGE TUCKER
                    I thought she was...

      ANGLE ON Zoe, as she spots Mabel, sitting on a chair in a 
      private area looking pale.  Zoe pushes her way towards her.


      Rose has a soda, and nearly bumps into Frederick who stands 
      with big-busted Magnolia Breeland.  Teen angst city.

                                  ROSE
                    Oh.  Hey, Frederick.  

                                  FREDERICK
                    Oh, hi Rose!  What re you doing here?

                                  MAGNOLIA
                    Yes, what ARE you doing here?  I sent 
                    the invitations myself.

                                  ROSE
                    Nothing.  Just came with the mayor.  
                    Lavon Hayes.  No big thing.  

                                  FREDERICK
                    He s pretty cool, isn t he.

      Rose stares at him, tongue-tied, awkward.

                                  ROSE
                    Yup... so Frederick, what d you think 
                    of that final Scott Pilgrim book?

                                  FREDERICK
                    I don t know.  I was pretty bummed.  
                    Kinda thought it d set up a sequel.  

                                  ROSE
                    Yeah, me too!

                                  MAGNOLIA
                    Who s Scott Pilgrim?

      As Rose and Frederick GIGGLE, off Magnolia Breeland, totally 
      frozen out of the conversation.                                                                                        44



      As the party continues, Dash DeWitt runs out of the house, 
      hysterical. 

                                  DASH
                    Brick!  Someone get Brick!   That 
                    Yankee doc s about to deliver a baby 
                    in his trophy room!!   

      On Lemon Breeland, utterly horrified.  She turns to one of 
      her Blue Belles.

                                  LEMON
                    Can she find more ways to ruin my 
                    party?
                          (covering, to guests)
                    But the soiree must go on!   More 
                      champagne!


      Colleen serves some cranky guests hors d oeuvres.

                                    COLLEEN
                    Mabel should be right up with your 
                    drinks.  Lord knows where she ran off-

      Just then Dash comes over, he pulls her aside, whispers in 
      her ear... as we see Colleen turns ashen, worried.                                                                                          51


                                    COLLEEN (CONT D)
                    My God.  Where is she?

      And as Colleen takes off for the house, dropping her hors 
      d oeuvres tray.


      As the paramedics and Zoe load Mabel and the baby into an 
      ambulance. ANGLE On Rose and Frederick, hitting it off--

                                  ROSE
                    Oh, yeah, Dr. Hart?  She s like my 
                    best friend.

      ANGLE On Magnolia scowling at them in the distance, 
      surrounded by 14 YEAR-OLD MINI BLUE BELLES, determined to 
      take her down..   


      Mabel and baby are all strapped in as--

                                  ZOE
                    You call me anytime, okay?  I ve got 
                    an international plan.  

      Mabel waves goodbye, and the AMBULANCE DOOR CLOSES.  As it 
      drives away, Mrs. H comes up behind Zoe..

                                  MRS. HATTENBARGER
                    I ve been around doctors thirty 
                    years, don t know if I ve ever seen 
                    any of them do that...  You can t 
                    leave now.

                                  ZOE
                    That s surgery.  Adrenaline, skill, 
                    power, it's what I excel at.  And I 
                    came here because I'd do anything to 
                    not have to stop being one.  The 
                    question is why.
                          (finally vulnerable)
                    I called my dad last night, opened my 
                    heart to him... he didn't even 
                    respond.  I've spent my life trying 
                    to impress a man who could care less 
                    about me.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                        53

                                  ZOE (CONT'D)
                    But maybe I can learn something from 
                    Mabel, maybe... the cycle can end.  
                    It s time to admit, I ve wanted this 
                    for the wrong reasons... I don t 
                    belong here.

      As Zoe walks away, Off Mrs. H, struggling with something.  

      ANGLE ON GEORGE, standing with Lemon, as he spies Zoe 
      leaving, clearly conflicted, wondering... 


      A worn down cab has arrived... As the driver helps load Zoe s 
      stuff, Zoe looks at the gatehouse, makes a decision.  She 
      walks over, KNOCKS on the door.  Wade opens it, surprised.

                                  ZOE
                    So, I m leaving.  So, feel free to 
                    use every outlet in the place.  

      Wade smiles a rueful, sexy smile.  

                                  WADE
                    Shame.  Heard what you just did for 
                    Big Mabel.  She s my second cousin 
                    once removed.  

                                  ZOE
                    You re lucky.  She s...  incredible.
                          (then)
                    Look, I m sorry if I was rude 
                    earlier.  I m sure you don t work in 
                    a rodeo.  And, well, your rendition 
                    of Love Me Two Times was actually 
                    kinda good. 

                                  WADE
                    Thanks.  Good luck, Doc. 
                          (with a sexy smile)
                    Gotta admit I was looking forward to 
                    sharing electricity with you.

      Zoe blushes and smiles, and gets in her cab.


      Zoe rides through town, looking out the window, clearly torn 
      about leaving.  Suddenly, the driver SLAMS on the brakes.  
      And we see Mrs. H standing on the road, blocking it.  Zoe 
      rolls down her window.

                                  ZOE
                    Mrs. H?  What are you doing?                                                                                        54


                                  MRS. H
                    There's something you need to see.


      There are generations of Breelands and Wilkes all around, as 
      Zoe sits at Harley's grave.   We realize the voice over we've 
      been hearing the whole time is her, sitting here, talking to 
      her dead father.  

                                  ZOE 
                    Where all the food is fried, the 
                    whole town smells like mold, and 
                    clearly the sex education system is 
                    lacking.  They could use a good 
                    doctor around here.  I may not be one 
                    yet, but, maybe, even though you're 
                    gone, there are still some things you 
                    can teach me...  
                          (choking up)
                    So, thanks. For the postcards.  
                    For... the faith.  No one ever 
                    believed in me like you did.                                                                                        58


      Startled by FOOTSTEPS, Zoe turns to see Mrs. H, carrying 
      flowers for Harley... She s quiet, kind as--

                                  MRS. HATTENBARGER
                    Harley was a great man, he would ve 
                    loved to have known you.

      Zoe turns her head away, embarrassed for Mrs. H to see her 
      cry.

                                  MRS. HATTENBARGER (CONT D)
                    Honey, there s no shame in tears.  

      Zoe can no longer help herself, she collapses into Mrs. H, 
      crying like she never could with her own mother.
