SALTFLATS - DAY
A weather antenna emerges from the ground:
an enigmatic phallic silver blob, like a
Koons sculpture.
The sun glints off it ...
19
DOWN BELOW
A temperature gauge rises.
The ice is infused with pulsating colors: purple -- blue -- green -- red.
Starts to heat
up
as if --
It soaks up temperature:
from cold to hot in instants.
20
CLOSEUP - WHITE GLOVED HAND ON DIAL
"CUMULUS COLLECTOR." The graphs accelerate, but over the dull HUM -- a
MURMUR, a BREATH.
As Emma's HEARTBEAT rises
The gloved
hand turns up the dial, past a red danger mark.
Suddenly a BLIP.
Something wrong.
21
DOWN IN HIS VAULT
Peter Peel's "coffin" starts to overheat. Peter reacts --
PETER
(intercom cutting out)
Losing control -- malfunction
in thermal chamber -- for Christ's
-- Emm --!
22
IN CONTROL ROOM
Needles push off the dials, as --
The ice swells: strange mix of colors, absorbing heat and energy in clusters of molten
metal ... steam and sparks ignite ... Valentine's eyes widen in alarm ...
COUNTDOWN (V.O.)
Five -- four --
three -- two --
one ... Three -- two -- one ...
(repeating)
Three -- two -- one ...

INSIDE COFFIN
Peter's glass cracks
The emergency light goes on -- the ALARM sounds -- lab assistants running ...

IN HER COFFIN
Emma realizes; looks to Peter --
25
SALTFLATS - DAY
The "Koons" antenna is drawing a strange purple cloud towards it, from otherwise blue
sky ... siphoning the purple atmosphere down itself into
26
STREETS - DAWN
Zoom!
The sleek, sporty black Jaguar SS100 burns down deserted streets.
Inside is a
bowler-hatted man --
JOHN STEED, late 30's.
Handsome English gent, roguish looks, dandy's clothes.
A
Beau Brummel figure in a Savile Row suit, velvet collar, embroidered waistcoat.
A debonair Etonian, Steed oozes charm, wit and - when he chooses to -- hard-edged,
steely menace.
He drives through --
40
LONDON (1999)
This is 'Avengersland': a parallel world painted by Rene Magritte, forever England.
Bright pinks, greens and reds, an imperial city in final decadent bloom.
White stucco
buildings. Regency style in candy colors.
A surreally 90's city like a hipper, edgier
version of the 60's preserved in aspic, where --
Over the RADIO, a plummy voice:
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
(filtered)
... The War Office today approved military
expenditure for the nation's new defense alert
system. A spokesman
said he would raise the
matter at the forthcoming World
Council of
Ministers, but that a state of vigilance was
still necessary in the uncertain climate.
As Steed turns into a mews, we realize that in this kinky, pop world, ordinary life does
not intrude.
No traffic.
No extras.
Nothing to spoil the view.
As the radio continues with a weather forecast, Steed --
41
STEED'S GARAGE - DAWN
Steed's car enters his garage -- Door closes as --
42
BOODLE-S CLUB (PALL MALL) - DAY
Near the Mall, outside white stucco buildings, a Lotus Elan pulls up and parks as a car
conveniently leaves, cutting off another angry CAR.
HONK!
A dash clock says 2:15.
Out gets --
-- Emma Peel, different attire.
She climbs steps.
On a brass plaque, "Boodles
Gentlemen's Club."
She goes in, passing --
-- an astonished uniformed commissionaire.
49
THAMES RIVER (NEAR WHITEHALL) - DAY
CAR ROAR OVER.
Down the embankment Parliament and Big Ben in b.g., the sleek
Jaguar zooms at 60mph.
Steed dodges traffic --
Wearing racing goggles, windscreen down --
Executes a nifty maneuver, swerves on a zebra crossing, scatters pedestrians,
HONKING his HORN.
Beside him, Emma is cool as a cucumber.
Steed turns
charmingly.
STEED
Tea time -- four o'clock.
Mustn't
be late.
(beat)
A word of warning. Don't take the
macaroon. Mother's favorite.
Steed swerves down a narrow alleyway, into a secret car park entrance by the
riverbank.
He pulls up before a sign:
RIVER THAMES WATER AUTHORITY
No Admittance
At a control barrier Steed inserts a card.
Emma sees a light flash up: "Security -- Top
Priority Clearance Only."
The barrier lifts.
She looks again at Steed, reappraising him
as Big Ben approaches four.
The car disappears in darkness ...
52
LARGE WINDOW CURTAIN
opens, revealing water!
We are beneath the Thames -- garbage and fish float past a
window of reinforced glass.
An original Campbell's tomato soup can floats down as we
WIDEN to reveal ...
53
SIGN - DAY
"Trubshaw's of Jermyn Street, since 1756."
Steed's Jag parked in front -- of course
there's a space.
Getting out
EMMA
I thought we were on our way.
STEED
Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man
worth meeting. No point setting out
half shod.
EMMA
(dry)
Or half cocked.
61
CLOSEUP - TRUBSHAW
slips Steed's hand-made shoes an.
The "lasts" shapes of shoes beside him -- bear
Steed's name.
STEED
I couldn't agree more. Thank you,
Trubshaw.
TRUBSHAW
(significantly)
Very good, Mr. Steed.
WIDEN to reveal:
62
LONDON STREETS - DAY
as the Jag races through them, heading for the country.
EMMA (V.O.)
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...
STEED (V.O.)
Do you really think so?
Another car follows them ... as they pass Buckingham Palace, now painted pink and
guarded by female grenadiers ...
65
SIGN
reading:
"Scotland" with an arrow, as Steed and Emma zoom past in the Jag ...
STEED (V.O.)
Press that button, would you?
Tea?
66
CLOSEUP - SPECIAL DASHBOARD COMPARTMENT
opens, revealing a tea service: a samovar of tea, feeding into a pre-warmed pot,
pouring into two china cups ...
WIDEN to reveal:
67
COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
Towards picturesque Scotland.
The JAG ROARS by - then the other car ...
69
HIGHLANDS - DAY
The Jag winds around Loch Ness, followed by the car.
STEED (V.O.)
According to Mother, Sir August owns
half of the Highlands. A millionaire.
Former head of Special Projects at the
Ministry. Now ...
EMMA (V.O.)
An eccentric recluse?
71
HUGE COUNTRY HOUSE - DAY
Steed and Emma speed up to the huge open main gates
Signs:
"Private: No Admittance."
Guards in hunting gear and plus fours, with loaded
rifles.
They start up the drive ...
Several peacocks on the lawn fan open their beautiful tails.
One of them, a mechanical peacock whose thousand eyes CLICK with the WHIR of a
CAMERA ...
The other car pulls in behind. Inside, reveal Bailey watching them.
73
MOORLAND - DAY
THUNDER and lightning -- Steed is caught out in it; puts up his umbrella; wanders
over the brow of a hill, past a big sign:
"No Trespassers."
Rains more.
And more.
Turns to a tempest, as --
STEED
I say, this is a bit much.
Lashed by rain ' Steed carries on to the brow of the hill.
He looks over, peers through
the mist at --
A deep purple cloud.
Mushrooming towards him.
Steed can't escape it.
It envelops him.
Starts to blink.
Cough.
Footsteps less sure.
Surrounded by thick purple haze
Steed stumbles and falls
Down a hill.
Tumbles to the bottom.
He knocks his head on a rock.
Steed blinks,
shakes his head.
Eyes refocus.
He sees
77
UNDULATING SAND DUNES
Sun shining down on yellow sand, a barren vista.
Dead trees.
Suddenly Steed's in the
Sahara.
A heat haze shimmers.
Steed blinks, thinks he's dreaming when he sees ...
78
IN DISTANCE - RED PHONE BOX
Steed heads towards it.
The PHONE BOX seems further away.
Like an optical
illusion.
Then hears RINGING.
Steed still bowler-hatted.
Overcoat.
Perspiring.
Takes off bowler, wipes brow.
Adjusts rose in buttonhole.
It wilts.
He arrives at the phone box. Opens the door.
Steed picks up the RINGING PHONE,
listens to --
A SCRATCHY ORCHESTRAL RECORDING of "The Merry Widow."
STEED
'The Merry Widow'...?
Over the MUSIC, a strange --
VOICE (V.O.)
(filtered)
... Hello ... Hello? ... Who the
hell...? Who is this? ... You must
leave the test area. I repeat,
leave the area ... Help is on the
way ...
CLICK.
The line goes dead.
Steed is baffled.
Steps out, sees --
79
ON HORIZON
a shimmering heat haze.
A figure on a camel moving towards them.
Steed watches
amazed, as the camel pads closer ...
The mirage arrives. The rider dismounts. A woman in yashmak and veils. She draws
closer. Drops the veils to reveal --
Emma Peel.
In her black leather catsuit.
.STEED
Mrs. Peel. Good of you to drop by.
And I see you're wearing your -
riding outfit?
Emma moves closer.
Steed smiles at her.
Emma closer and -- chop! -- gives a kung-fu
jab to the throat, a kick to the balls, a jab to the stomach.
As Steed lies on the
ground --
STEED
Manners, Mrs. Peel.
Emma takes out a .38 GUN, points at his heart, FIRES --
BLAM!
BLAM!
BLAM!
BLAM!
FOUR SHOTS --
80
EMMA'S POV
-- The bullets strike his chest.
Round his heart.
Steed slumps back on the sands.
Eyes
close ...
81
EMMA
moves over him. Drops a small toy snowshaker into his curled fingers. Blows a good
bye kiss.
82
STEED'S POV	82
The sun.
Clouds roll by.
The camel peers down at him.
FADE TO BLACK.
Sound of CLACKING ...
FADE IN:
83
LONDON STREET - NIGHT
The sporty Jag pulls up outside a tall, swanky building.
Steed gets out, opens her door.
Irritated, Emma steps out of the car, clad in her leather suit --
86
CLOSEUP OF HER HEEL
hitting the street.
PAN UP TO Steed, admiring --
STEED
I must say, you look more your
old self --
EMMA
You mean my other self ...
STEED
Either way ... may I ask: why
you dress in that fashion?
EMMA
I should have thought that was
obvious ...
(off his smirk)
I'm in mourning.
She moves off.
Stay on his poker face.
STEED
I can't wait to see afternoon.
He joins her; they survey the building.
EMMA
Where's the picnic?
They look up to --
87
CADOGAN PLACE APARTMENT BUILDING (KNIGHTSBRIDGE) -
NIGHT
Down a sheer wall Emma Peel abseils with rope and crampons.
Before gliding through
an open French window --
97
Emma looks.
Beneath a starlit sky criss-crossed by wires, a rooftop maze of buildings,
flanked by giant gargoyles -- goblins, lions, griffins -- over twinkling lights ...
Emma searches the roof -- no sign, only shadows.
Then turns a corner to see --
Above the city, fairy lights on the rooftops of Harrods, lit by a million bulbs ... giant
neon signs ...
Several floors below, Emma sees the streets.
A twinge of vertigo.
Then she looks up,
hears a NOISE -- From:
107
BEHIND GARGOYLE
she sees her "double" run.
Emma gives chase.
Hot pursuit.
Over rooftops.
'Round wires.
PAST neon signs high over the city ...
Emma follows.
Gains on the "double," who --
Pushes faster.
Gliding between rooftop buildings.
Dodging, weaving.
But Emma
gains more.
Sleek limbs, muscular, perfect body machine, until --
108
EMMA'S POV
as she sees her "double" leap over a yawning chasm.
And stumble on the other side for
a footing.
109
BACK TO SCENE
as Emma's adrenaline surges.
She cannot stop, she --
Jumps!
Hangs in the air.
Limbs pushing out for the edge.
And only just, she lands
perfectly, gaining, closing, until --
110
ON NEXT ROOFTOP
Emma gains up close.
A final burst of acceleration.
Then without warning, her
"double" --
Turns, Emma catches up, and --
Wham!
Wham!
A kick -- a chop to Emma's body - double scissorkick -- Emma reacts
swiftly, surges into overdrive --
In a lightning-fast kung fu duel -- CRACK OF BONE -- CRUNCH OF BLOWS -- a
flurry of kicks as Emma --
Lands on her back.
The "double" attacks.
Emma retaliates --
Kicks up her leg -- flings the "double" over her head she lands awkwardly -- a
METALLIC CRUNCH in a blow to her head -- but picks herself up without pausing
And vanishes into the rooftop maze.
111
AGAINST SKYLINE
Emma stands.
Looks.
She's lost her "double."
She stands alone, silhouetted against
the night sky.
Caught in the moonlight.
Above sparks of neon.
Daunting, muscular, poised for
action, as --
Ears listening to distant noises.
SWOOSHING TRAFFIC.
FLUTTER of BIRD
WING.
HUM of WIND through wires.
Then an AUDIBLE SNAP --
112
EMMA'S POV - HIGH ANGLE
above her a SPAM as a STEEL CABLE WIRE of an aerial is snapped.
Slowly wound
tightly 'round, bent back, coiled, ready to spring --
113
BACK TO SCENE - EMMA
looks 'round.
Sees nothing, hears the sound of the WHIPLASH coming seconds
before --
Through the air --
114
EMMA'S POV
a flashing line like a bolt of lightning, but cannot move quickly enough as --
115
BACK TO SCENE
as a cable wire whips across, coils 'round Emma, lashing her tight, crushing air from
her, as the wire --
Sweeps Emma off her feet, whiplashes her back like a spring, hoists her and dangles her
over the city.
She looks down.
A long way.
Emma grabs hold of the wire, which pulls her back.
She drops down to the rooftop ...
Slithers down the roof.
Slips --
116
OVER LEDGE
Emma hangs on with fingertips.
Overlooking city with 100-foot neon sign above her:
117
ADVERTISEMENT
for "Wonderland Weather" with: a repeated loop of a 100-foot high bikini-clad
"Emma" throwing head back in holiday fun -- Sign: "COMING SOON -- THE
NATURAL BEAUTY OF WONDERLAND WEATHER."
118
BACK TO SCENE
Emma hangs on, looks up, stares at "herself."
The surreal repetition of the loop.
Overlooking the whole city.
Dizzy, Emma threatens to pass out.
Just when from --
119
ABOVE HER
an unseen hand from Bad Emma winds down --
Another CABLE for her to hold.
It uncoils down past the windows, telltale SPARKS
flare up as it hits metal --
Emma tries to grab for it.
Misses, then grabs hold, and -- a LIVE CABLE -- a
thousand VOLTS surge through her body --
-- A shock, Emma plummets DOWN TO --
120
STRIPED AWNING
on a lower ledge.
She hangs precariously.
Catching her breath.
About to redouble her
efforts.
When beside her from a --
121
BALCONY WINDOW
an umbrella extended.
Steed reaches out, reels Emma in.
They are back in Teddy's
flat ... Emma collapses in Steed's arms.
He helps her up -- hands her a phone.
STEED
For you, Mrs. Peel.
EMMA
Thanks ...
(dry)
I see what you mean about letting
me do the risking ... Hello?
It's Sir August.
SIR AUGUST (V.O.)
(filtered)
Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly.
Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell
you everything ... The weather's
getting worse and worse ... they're
after me ... coming for me ... come
quickly!
CLICK.
EMMA
Sir August...?
(to Steed)
What now?
STEED
Ask Mother.
Sound OVER:
RING-RING.
122
WHITEHALL STREETS - DAY
PAST obscure imperial statues a tiny micro Messerschmidt bubble car tootles down
deserted streets.
FATHER (V.O.)
A cyclone hit Banffshire last night.
Completely unpredicted ...
125
INSIDE CAR
EMMA
Where's Mother?
FATHER
Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.
Can't
take chances. I'm looking after
things while he's hiding out ...
Father drives like a maniac.
She senses their unease.
FATHER
You're probably wondering how I
can drive 'blind.' Simple. A new
prototype from the boys in X division.
Micro-sensors in the system read
signals and road information. Converts
the info into miles per hour.
Ultra-sensitive.
Ultra-smart.
Father jumps a red light.
CARS SCREECH together in a huge pile-up.
Not that smart.
Steed holds onto his hat.
STEED
We know one thing. That suspect
was not Mrs. Peel.
FATHER
So you say ...
EMMA
You don't believe him?
FATHER
It's Mother you have to convince.
He's very agitated.
Wait here.
Father SCREECHES to a halt on Holland Park Avenue
Steed and Emma get out.
Father takes off ...
EMMA
But
STEED
Don't bother.
Here's a bus ...
A red London number 22 bus drives up.
As it arrives, in a conductor's cap is -- the
bodyguard, Brenda.
BRENDA
Fares, please,

WONDERLAND WEATHER OFFICES - DAY
Steed looks around, picks the lock ... hi-tech style ...

WONDERLAND OFFICES - STREET - DAY
Steed emerges, stares at his postcard -- the stately home and:
"Headquarters, Wonderland Weather, Ltd." as --
EMMA (V.O.)
My car. I'll drive.

COUNTRY ROADS - DAY
Emma's LOTUS ELAN WHIZZES BY...
STEED (V.O.)
A day in the country ...
133
COUNTRY LANES - SEVERAL ANGLES - DAY
The Lotus races 'round blind corners.
Hairpin bends.
Across a train at a level crossing,
which just misses them --
135
COUNTRY LANES - DAY
The Lotus twisting and turning.
The car behind always catches up.
Emma tries to
shake it.
Gears up.
Mach force.
Over crossroads.
Shaking 'round corners, as ...
137
BEND
before Emma pushes foot down.
Further ACCELERATION.
The car behind struggles
to keep up.
Emma coasts ahead, turns a corner --
And suddenly sees in front of her --
138
HUGE TRUCK
crossing directly in their path!
STEED
Turn!
139
EMMA
swerves, plunging the car into a haystack, where it is completely hidden as --
140
TRUCK
clears in time for the following car, which keeps going.
141
ON HAYSTACK
as Steed emerges, brushing off straw.
An old lady on a bicycle with a basket appears ...
OLD LADY
Are you alright, young man?
STEED
I think so, thank you so much ...
A SQUEAL of TIRES as -
The following car swerves back, stops and Bailey emerges, gun drawn as Steed and the
Old Lady react ...
BAILEY
(relishing)
Reach for the sky, pardner.
Steed raises his hands.
OLD LADY
Oh, dear --
To Steed's surprise, she pulls an Uzi from her basket and
BANGBANGBANGBANG -- !
SPRAYS BULLETS into Bailey, who crumples, gun
spinning along the tarmac.
Cute and sweetlooking, the Old Lady is unfazed.
OLD LADY
Cocky little bastard. I hope he
was a baddy.
STEED
I feel sure of it.
OLD LADY
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be
on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
STEED
(looks around)
She was ...
They start pulling away hay from the haystack ...
OLD LADY
You with Mother or Father?
STEED
Both, actually.
OLD LADY
Good. Glad to see they're together at last.
They don't get along. Promotion. Top job.
Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.
STEED
(not paying attention)
You don't say.
(mumbles)
Like looking for a needle in a ...
142
INSIDE HAYSTACK
Coughing.
Then Emma, sputtering straw as Steed's face appears.
He tries to conceal
his relief at seeing her.
STEED
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet
breathing?
EMMA
Barely.
STEED
You will let me know if you find
that queen who's in need of
protection, won't you?
He pulls her out.
She's annoyed.
143
OUTSIDE HAYSTACK
Emma brushes herself off; pulls off a piece of straw.
EMMA
(holding it ruefully)
This must be the last straw.
STEED
(takes one off
her back)
Here's the one that broke the
camel's back.
EMMA
Someone didn't want us to get to
the party.
STEED
I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
OLD LADY
I may be able to help you.
144
STATELY HOME FROM POSTCARD - DAY

Steed, Emma and the Old Lady survey ...
STEED

This way ...
145
HALLUCINOGEN HALL - GROTTO AND MAZE - DAY
On a lawn, a peacock flares its thousand eye tail.
A MECHANICAL CLICK, its eyes
conceal hidden cameras, recording Emma, Steed and the Old Lady, who've landed
inside the walled grounds.
They move stealthily forward, unaware ...
OLD LADY
Over here ...
The Old Lady waves them on.
They enter a tunnel into
146
MAZE
Tall hedges surround Steed and Emma and the Old Lady on all sides.
They follow the
path, slopes , round, curves, turns into hairpin bends and U-turns.
At first intrigued ...
Then perplexed.
Emma leads the way, Steed following.
The Old Lady slips OUT OF
VIEW.
Steed stops to pick a rose, puts it in his lapel.
Emma rushes ahead.
EMMA
Aha ... Yes ... It's clear now. A
trapezoid shape, dictated by twin
diagonal paths and a single
curving path. A late Seventeenth
Century design, originally for
King William of Orange, copied...
Ah ...
Steed sees Emma slip 'round a corner.
He pursues her.
Glimpses her.
Then loses her.
Another glimpse.
Sees her thru hedges, then seemingly --
Thru the other side of the hedge.
In two places at once.
STEED
... Mrs. Peel? I think I'm seeing
double again.
Out of sight, Emma rushes on.
Around her, the hedges grow taller.
She seems to
grow smaller.
Emma begins to realize things are not what they seem.
As she pushes
her way thru --
147
FROM ABOVE
the maze as a formal patter-n. Three tiny figures dart round.
DISSOLVE THRU TO:
148
MAZE - DAY
Steed searches for an exit.
150
ANOTHER PART OF MAZE
Emma sees a statue of a Butler.
Which springs to life.
Summons Emma.
She follows
down a path strewn with leaves.
As Emma steps on the leaves, she --
Falls down -- a giant rabbit hole.
151
MAZE - DAY
The identical face of Emma on a marble statue, as --
Steed studies the classical statue ...
STEED
Mrs. Peel ... ?
Steed hears a noise, turns to see --
Emma walking towards him.
She picks the rose from his lapel, slowly coils an arm
around his neck.
Pulls Steed towards her, closes her eyes -- kisses him full an the
mouth.
STEED
Mrs. Peel ... !
(more kiss)
Mrs. Peel ...
The kiss ends.
Steed recovers his composure, lips coated with her lipstick.
His tongue
traces his lips; smarts ...
STEED
Your lipstick ...
Poison.
He goes dizzy.
Steed collapses to the ground.
153
HOUSE
as if in response, a storm gathers.
Shadowy clouds roll in.
158
IN MAZE
A drop of rain starts to fall.
Steed's eyes flicker open.
STEED
(re: rain)
Not again.
He rises, looks down, reacts --
Alice, the Old Lady, lies near him in the maze, her neck snapped... Steed kneels, next to
her in the rain
OLD LADY
It's a trap. Tell Mother, beware.
Tell Father.
She dies in his arms.
Wind picks up, too.
Steed looks about, frowning with discouragement --
159
HALLUCINOGEN HALL - WINDOW - DAY
somersaults through the window down to the ground.
Lands with a THUD on the wet
ground.
Looks up to see --
Steed above her, the STORM RAGING.
EMMA
Steed!
She struggles to her feet, comes towards him, upset.
STEED
Oh, no. First time, shame on
you. Third time, shame on me.
He slugs her and the SCREEN GOES BLACK.
DR. DARLING (V.O.)
Diagnosis confirmed.
Mrs. Peel is
suffering from delusions and
hallucinations. An extreme personality
disorder. She imagines her husband
Peter Peel has come back to her ...
CLOSE ON Emma's face.
DR. DARLING (V.O.)
A classic syndrome, to overcome her
subconscious guilt at her other crimes.
We've attached her to the dreamscape
machine. We'll soon see what her
unconscious looks like...
Emma's eyes flicker...
Steed comes INTO FOCUS, sitting by Emma's bed.
This time he's eating her grapes ...
Emma looks around ... Everything blurs.
A STEADY PULSE DRONE.
Tugs at
leather straps.
No use.
WIDEN to reveal Emma strapped to a special couch --
Her head surrounded by a plastic dome, terminals and wires leading out into a
Dreamscape machine.
Drowsy, disoriented.
EMMA
Where am I?
STEED
The Winslow Home for Retired
Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry
I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please
forgive me. I thought you were
someone else ...
EMMA
Was I?
STEED
(no smile)
I expect that's for you to know
and me to find out ...
EMMA
It was Peter -- I saw him ...
Drugged, Emma's eyes drop.
FOCUS CHANGES TO --
165
ABOVE HER
A giant spiral HYPNODISC WHIRRS, creating trippy black and white zig zag op-art
effects a la Bridget Riley.
She blinks.
DISSOLVE TO:
166
SAME SCENE - LATER
Steed is gone.
Dr. Darling leans over her.
Emma stares at the hypnodisc.
Closes her
eyes.
167
EXTREME CLOSEUP ON HER EYES
Thousand REMs per sec -- a tiny chip next to her eyes, transmitting out via wires to --
168
UP ON WALL
A "Dreamscape" apparatus like a liquid TV screen flicks thru random images from
Emma's unconscious.
Peter Peel -- Teddy Bears -- post card views -- childhood
snaps --
169
BESIDE "BED"
Dr. Darling furls his hand over Emma's, his fingers resting upon her ring.
During the
interrogation, he soothingly strokes her hand -- tries to remove the ring without
arousing her suspicion.
Pulls gently on it.
170
UP IN GALLERY
In his wheelchair, Mother sits beside Steed.
MOTHER
This man -- did you see him?
STEED
No. Her husband, she says. Alice
tried to warn us. A trap. Tell
Mother beware. Tell Father
That's all.
171
BY COUCH
Dr. Darling leans forward to interrogate Emma.
172
FROM HER POV
He looks and sounds sinister.
From a corner of her eye, she sees -- a clip of keys
hanging from his pocket.

... love ...
DR. DARLING
Peter ...
As Emma talks, the "Dreamscape" plucks images from her unconscious in trippy
psychedelic rush:
faces -- colors -- patterns flash past.
EMMA
... Piper picked a peck of pickled
peppers how many pecks of pickled
peppers did Peter Peel -- ?

CLOSEUP - EMMA
Quietly unclicks a lock.
She stops in mid-gabble.
EMMA
How long have I been here?
DR. DARLING
Three days.
Emma unlocks her straps.
Sits Up.
Woozy.
EMMA
Do you get paid by the hour?
Dr. Darling is shocked, indignant.
Emma rips wires from her body.
The "Dreamscape"
machine winds down.
Up in the gallery --
BAM -- !
Mother bashes his metal cane on the railings
MOTHER
(filtered)
You are here under observation,
Mrs. Peel. You must answer Dr.
Darling's questions
Pushes Dr. Darling aside.
EMMA
I resign.
MOTHER
(filtered)
You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.
You
can't resign.
EMMA
Watch me.
Emma staggers.
Mother looks at Steed.
Who snaps himself out of staring at the
hypnodisc.
Emma heads for the airlock door marked:
"ANTI-GRAVITY CHAMBER -- NO ADMITTANCE"
MOTHER
Don't open that, Mrs. Peel!
Fat chance ... she goes in ...
175
COUNTRYSIDE CLINIC - DAY
Emma drives a hot-wired Morris Minor out the open gates of the manor house, past a
sign which reads:
"WINSLOW HOME FOR RETIRED LEPIDOPTORISTS" (Butterfly logo)
In the b.g., a couple of old-timers race around with butterfly nets as Steed's jag pulls
past them in hot pursuit.
180
COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
Emma speeds down lanes ...
Followed at a safe distance by Steed in his SS100.
181
LANES - DAY
The cars whiz past ...
184
BELLTOWER TOP - DAY
BELL still RINGING.
At the top, a sheer drop.
Steed edges closer to the ledge.
Looks.
A long way down.
From behind --
EMMA
A long way down.
Steed swivels.
Sees Emma blocking his path.
Cool menace.
Steed steps away from
the edge, Emma circles him.
STEED
Careful. You might fall.
Emma steps to the edge.
Steed freezes.
Emma locks down.
Feet resting on the ledge.
Rocking to and fro ...
EMMA
I could save you the trouble.
STEED
No trouble.
EMMA
Because you always obey orders ...
STEED
Always.
(pause)
Except ...
Steed nears her.
Emma pushes herself right to the edge.
EMMA
Yes ... ?
STEED
... when I don't. It comes down to one
thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.
Steed reaches out for her.
Holds out his hand.
EMMA
And do you trust me?
STEED
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who
poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
EMMA
It wasn't me; you have my word.
Steed snatches her from the edge, holds her in his arms.
STEED
I need proof.
Emma thinks.
Looks at him.
Deadly serious.
Their eyes lock.
She hesitates, then
pecks him on the cheek.
STEED
It was longer. On the lips.
Emma hesitates.
Then a kiss on the lips.
Longer.
But not much.
Steed grabs her
hand, pulls her back.
STEED
Much longer.
Approximately ...
fifteen seconds.
Emma harumphs, exasperated.
Moves closer to him.
EMMA
... Ready?
Steed nods.
Emma leans forward.
A full kiss.
At first reticent ... Emma looks at her
watch.
Counts seconds ...
EMMA
... Four ... seven ... ni-...
Then ... forgets.
Warmer, more relenting.
Edging towards passionate.
They stay
embracing for fifteen seconds ...
EMMA
(aroused)
Mmm ... what are you doing?
STEED
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
EMMA
Is that all?
The kiss continues couple of seconds longer.
Before Emma withdraws.
With an effort,
she regains her composure.
A long silence.
EMMA
So I'm in the clear?
Steed savors the kiss.
No reply.
His smile says it all.
EMMA
But you did suspect me.
STEED
Not for a moment.
EMMA
You're playing games.
STEED
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
EMMA
I thought you played by the rules.
STEED
I thought you didn't.
EMMA
I'm playing to win.
STEED
Winning isn't everything.
EMMA
Please don't tell me it's how you
play the game.
STEED
(smiles; stands
aside)
After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
Steed motions down the stairs.
It's close to the edge.
EMMA
No, after you.
STEED
(back to square
one)
You don't trust me?
EMMA
As far as you trust me.
Emma motions.
Steed goes down, passes close to the edge, and swivels round
nervously.
Emma reads his thoughts.
EMMA
When it happens, Steed, you'll be
the first to know ...
With this comforting thought, Steed descends first.
189
CHURCH TOWER - DAY
As Steed and Emma exit from the tower, they see --
A tranquil village scene.
Choirboys walk out from the church.
Nearby in the deserted
village street.
A red PHONE BOX.
Which ...
RING-RING ... Starts to RING.
EMMA
Who could that be?
A ROLL of THUNDER.
Steed looks up: a clear sky.
He's puzzled.
Suddenly
suspicious.
As Emma moves to the phone.
STEED
No -- don't answer it ...
He pulls her back.
Emma looks at him.
STEED
That's it. The phones trigger
the explosions --
RING-RING ... Another ROLL of THUNDER.
Steed connects the two as -- an
angelic CHOIRBOY walks towards the phone ...
RING-RING ... A LOUDER ROLL of THUNDER.
As the Choirboy nears the
PHONE, Steed shouts --
STEED
Don't -- don't answer it -- !
190
CLOSEUP - PHONE
RING-RING -- the PHONE in the f.g. as the choirboy closes in, opens the door --
191
INSIDE PHONE BOX
The door shuts.
Noise muffled.
The Choirboy can't hear Steed and Emma's shouted
warnings, as he lifts his hand up, and --
192
OUTSIDE
Steed sees him reach out, warns the vicar and choirboys.
STEED
Get down -- get down -- it's
going to explode -- !
Steed and Emma, all the choirboys hit the dirt, as
193
INSIDE PHONE BOX
The Choirboy grabs the phone, and lifts it up, and
Silence.
No explosion.
A few seconds pass.
Steed and everyone
are down on the ground.
As they see --
194
FROM PHONE BOX
-- the Choirboy leaves the phone hanging.
He gets out, scans the crowd.
Then walks
calmly over to Steed, who's still prone.
CHOIRBOY
It's your mother.
The vicar and choirboys look on sympathetically, as --
Steed dusts himself off.
Emma and everyone gets up.
Steed goes to the phone box,
takes the call.
STEED
Mother? How did you find me?
His expression changes as he listens.
Emma goes to the phone box as Steed rings off.
He emerges from the box.
STEED
I told Mother I took care of you.
EMMA
You lied.
STEED
I equivocated. But you're not
their big worry at present. It's
Dr. Darling:
he's disappeared ...
OFF Emma's reaction to this news --

It
slips out ...
Just beyond the elevator doors.

The doors open again.
He moves in --

Stands up

Emma held back over gargoyle, over now snow white city ...
Knees assassin in balls.
Flicks him backwards ...

The Co-Pilot dangles over the city.
Grabs Emma.
Slithers back onto the cockpit.
Pistol whips her.
Emma crunches back onto the metal.
Blades whirring close!
The co-Pilot peers into her eyes from inside the gas mask --
CO-PILOT
Happy landings, Mrs. Peel.
He raises his hand, ready to hit her again, Emma yanks him up, where his head get
sliced off by the blades -- body and head fall away separately ...
As Emma reacts, her legs are grabbed from below and the white-coated Man pulls her

The Man looks at his shoe, at Emma charging towards him, at the rope ladder.
He

when she sees --

Emma lands, buries her parachute.
Walks towards a thick jungle, then a stream.

PAN UP the arm to reveal Valentine.
VALENTINE (V.O.)
Oh, no. I arranged the explosion.
299
BACK TO PRESENT
VALENTINE
A slight miscalculation -- my face
was burned beyond recognition.
Fortunately my research into plastics
came in handy ...
EMMA
(stunned)
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
VALENTINE
An unholy trinity ...
EMMA
(stands)
You killed my husband.
VALENTINE
For starters. Of course I had to kill
the Teddy Bears, as well ...
EMMA
Too many cooks --
VALENTINE
Spoil the majority shareholders. In
Wonderland Weather. I planned
everything, even the Ministry
recruiting you ...
EMMA
But I found you. All the clues
led me here ...
VALENTINE
Of course. I planned that, too.
EMMA
But -- why?
VALENTINE
You disappoint me, Emma.
Can't
you guess?
(moves toward her)
For you. It was all for you ...
EMMA

Oh, no, Emma. They've only
just begun ...

SKY OVER LONDON - NIGHT
Moonlight night.
Dark clouds approach like an army, spreading shadows.
313
INSIDE CLOUDS
MOISTURE SPITS and CRACKLES, static energy waiting to explode ...
In the sky -- clouds join together like a genie from a lamp, forming -- over the city -- a
strange dark sensuous figure, half human, half dreamlike.
That stalks the city....
314
PARLIAMENT SQUARE - NIGHT
Up in the sky, more white clouds --
Darken into boiling black.
They move and billow.
Bubbling with gases and energy
Swirling with motion, a life of their own.
FROM river, a scarlet fog floats upwards.
It gains mass and weight, slowly forming as
it rolls --
321
THROUGH CITY STREETS
then RISES ABOVE them -- into a weird pulsating red shape.
A love heart.

As shadows in a whirl of chemical matter.
An airborne CYCLONE of BELCHING
static ELECTRICITY.
The black shape now --
Forming a sensuous female shape.
Like a dream wisp of ...
Emma Peel with an hourglass figure.
While --

FROM RIVER
The heart-shaped cloud seems to -- move towards the black genie shape -- trying to
connect, to form the cyclone ...

LONDON STREETS - SEVERAL ANGLES - NIGHT
Action stations.
AIR RAID SIRENS ...

VALENTINE
Fool ...
In his hesitation, Emma suddenly makes her move.
A struggle -- Emma takes a bad fall
down a landing below.
Ugly THUD.
Dead.
STEED
That will do.
He's materialized across the girder from Valentine.
Who pulls his revolver.
VALENTINE
Aren't you forgetting about
something?
STEED
You are, and it's behind you.
VALENTINE
Come, come. You don't really
expect me to fall for --
Bad Emma's arms go 'round Valentine in a lethal embrace.
VALENTINE
Let go, you ... idiot ...
Uh uh.
She holds him in a vice-like grip.
Hugging Valentine.
STEED
I think she really likes you ...
Where's Mrs. Peel?
VALENTINE
Ugh ...
As the life is squeezed out of him, Bad Emma finally smiles.
Cradled together, she
chokes Valentine, who gasps for breath, as --
One last desperate move on his part and Bad Emma tumbles backwards, Valentine
locked in her arms in a dying embrace.
They fall into the mists and liquid below.
Steed almost falls himself as he grabs a beam for support.
Looks down, sees ...
350
EMMA
Dead.
STEED
Emma!
He has said her name.
He scrambles down to her body.
Emma lying sprawled out on the ground.
Steed picks up her limp body in his arms like "Sleeping Beauty."
His eyes fill with
tears.
He lays her down.
STEED
Emma ...
He produces Peter's ring.
351
CLOSEUP - RING
Slips it onto her finger and ...
352
BACK TO SCENE
Kisses her.
A chaste kiss on the lips.
But with the force and passion of a lover.
He
closes his eyes, looks away in grief.
The ALARM STILL SOUNDS but Steed doesn't
give a damn.
Behind, Emma opens her eyes.
As if revived by the kiss.
Or the ring.
Looks up at
him.
EMMA
Steed?
Steed looks back at her -- surprise, delight.
STEED
Mrs. Peel?
EMMA
What kept you?
STEED
The plot.
(realizing)
Hello, we must be going ...

Beneath the clear moonlight, all bulbs on -- like Xmas.

Steed and Emma, squashed together, gasping for breath.
STEED
'The owl and the pussycat went
to sea -'
EMMA
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
STEED
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
EMMA
Still a bit chilly ...
STEED
English weather. You know, after
all we've been through, I should
say we deserve a long holiday ...
EMMA
Have you any place in mind?
STEED
As a matter of fact I have ...
The coffin drifts downstream in the moonlight.
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
360
SIBERIAN ICE FIELDS - DAY				360
A few weeks later.
Across snowy wastes, a pack of Huskies drag a sled behind them,
WHIP CRACKED by a --
Frozen fur-clad Siberian peasant.
As he turns a corner, dogs stumble from ice and
snow into --
361
SAND
The peasant stops, stares.
362
AHEAD OF HIM
Sun beats down.
A tropical beach.
A warm sea.
A butler, Trubshaw.
POPS a
CHAMPAGNE CORK.
From a tent, he brings two glasses down the beach to
363
TWO DIVAN-STYLE DECK CHAIRS
Where Steed and Emma toast in the sun.
Steed in a smoking jacket, Emma in a bikini.
EMMA
I don't recall Siberia being this
warm, Steed.
STEED
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
EMMA
Our little paradise -- just made
for two?
STEED
(looks; frowns)
Not quite.
On cue from the water, Mother emerges, snorkeling in his wheelchair contraption --
with Brenda.
He waves to --
STEED
Our chaperon.
EMMA
Pity your mother came, too ...
Steed seems peeved that his chance to be alone with EMMA is spoiled.
Trubshaw
pours glasses of champagne.
STEED
Still a little warm, Trubshaw.
Is this the '28? A little more
ice, I think ...
Trubshaw trots off dutifully.
A large ice bucket appears.
Mother moves in.
Absorbed
by Emma, now his new protegee.
MOTHER
About your next assignment, Mrs.
Peel ...
EMMA
Next assignment?
Steed gives his champagne to the Siberian peasant.
He presses a switch -- an umbrella
shoots up between them, opens up, twirls.
PULL BACK to reveal the strip of beach, like a tiny bubble of tropical weather.
Against a Siberian b.g. of snow.
As we WIDEN we REVEAL a giant glass bubble,
hearing --
EMMA (V.O.)
Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops
nearby?
STEED (V.O.)
Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll
send Mother ...
PULL BACK to reveal no shop for miles around.
MOTHER (V.O.)
Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps
another macaroon ...
EMMA (V.O.)
Thank you, Steed.
STEED (V.O.)
Thank you, Mrs. Peel.
Behind the umbrella -- LAUGHTER.
CHINK of GLASSES.
FADE OUT.
