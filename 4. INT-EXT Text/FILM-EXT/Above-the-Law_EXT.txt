Blowing through the roof of a dense jungle straight AT
CAMERA, HELICOPTER ROTORS RISE to a DEAFENING PITCH.
SUPER:
Viet - Cambodian Border, 1972. Jungle foliage
whips in the fierce downdraft as --
3
"HUEY" GUNSHIP
with US Army markings becomes discernible. The chopper
lowers toward a crude landing zone hacked out of the
wilderness. We GLIMPSE Cambodian troops and several
machine gun positions around the LZ.
4
watch from the edge of the landing zone. We recognize Nico
and Fox, now in their twenties, dressed in the nonmilitary
jungle attire that usually marks a CIA "spook."
5
HELICOPTER
touches down. THREE OLDER AMERICANS -- rough-looking, in
their mid-thirties, all carrying some kind of medical bags
-- disembark into the HOWLING ROTOR BLAST. They hit the
ground nimbly, as if they've done it many times before.
6
LEADER OF THREE
wears a khaki cowboy hat and packs a pearl-handled .45.
7
NICO AND FOX
don't know whether to react with laughter or uneasiness.
2.
FOX
You ever see chemical interrogation
before?
Nico's eyes stay on the approaching "cowboy," KURT ZAGON,
for whom he plainly feels an instant animosity.
NICO
These assholes are agency?
8
NICO'S POV
FOLLOWS the medical bag in the cowboy's hand.
9
BACK TO FOX AND NICO
FOX
We're all C.I.A. But these guys are
from a page that ain't on the map.
10
Nico in the point,
leading Fox and the three CIT (Chemical
Interrogation Team)
men down an unmarked, twisting trail.
We see from Nico's
gait that he is athletic, a born leader
and totally at home
in the jungle.
11
TRAIL - LATE AFTERNOON
snakes along a ridge line, high enough to give us a view and
let us know these guys are way out in the boonies.
ZAGON
How long till we're across the border?
NICO
We've been over for the past hour.
The group continues along the ridge.
CUT TO:
12
The sky glows from nearby bomb attacks.
13
NICO
listening hard -- and even sniffing the air -- glances back
at Zagon, who stands impatiently, drawing on a cigarette.
ZAGON
What are you looking at, hotshot?
NICO
(indicates cigarette
glow)
Why don't you light a bonfire?
3.
Irritably, Zagon ditches his smoke.
ZAGON
Just drive the taxi, ace.
As the party moves out, Fox flashes Nico a look as if to say,
"Don't fuck with these guys."
14
A pocket-fortified position. Armed Cambodian lookouts,
several hooches, radio equipment. Nico leads the party in
through the perimeter. Zagon eyes the layout like he's seen
100 of them. Fox indicates a hooch.
FOX
(to Zagon)
They're in there.
The three CIT men start for the hooch. Nico casts a concerned
glance around at the base camp troops, looking sloppy as hell.
NICO
I don't trust these yo-yo's.
15
FULL SHOT - BASE CAMP
We see Nico moving like a shadow from one defensive position
to another, checking the perimeter. We can vaguely hear him
ROUSTING the Cambodian lookouts, speaking in dialect.
16
DEFENSIVE POSITION - NICO
hears a SOUND, looks back toward the hooch.
17
NICO'S POV - HOOCH
Two Asian prisoners, stripped to the waist, babbling in-
coherently, are dragged out the back by a pair of Cambodian
guards and hustled off into the darkness. VOICES can be
heard inside the hooch. A single lantern glowing inside
gives the hut a creepy, frightening aspect.
18
BACK TO NICO
He's extremely uneasy about what's about to happen inside the
hooch.
19
hears this horrifying cry.
He starts swiftly toward the
hooch --
22
Fox wrestles Nico away from the hooch --
FOX
Are you crazy?!!
(as Nico jerks free)
What the fuck's the matter with you?!!!
Nico is shaking with rage and fear. He takes several steps
away from the hooch, then draws up abruptly. Nico pulls his
.45 from his holster, pops the safety, starts back for the
hooch --
FOX
Nico!
NICO
I don't cap him now, he's gonna do me
later.
The last CIT man appears, gun drawn, in the hooch doorway.
Fox grabs Nico, hauls him back again --
FOX
I'll cover this. Get back to the
L.Z. --
(as Nico resists)
-- I'll fix it! Get out! Get the
fuck outa here!
The CIT man calls out to the Cambodian troops, in dialect,
pointing at Nico. The soldiers start toward Nico, as if to
seize him. Fox, too, starts yelling to the troops in dialect,
apparently countermanding the orders of the CIT men. The
troops, confused, hold up for a moment.
FOX
(to Nico)
I'll call for a chopper... get outa
here!

Nico gives a last look, turns and takes off down the jungle
trail. Fox seems abandoned. The DISTANT BOMBING CONTINUES.
Nico disappears into the darkness.
FADE TO BLACK.
FADE IN ON:
31
CHURCH STEEPLE - DAY
TILT DOWN to reveal St. Elizabeth's, a huge parish church in
an Italian/Latino neighborhood in Chicago. The church looks
festive, we see a few formally-dressed people hurrying in,
then a squad car pulls up. The cops run upstairs as if
they're late --
32
Huge trays of Italian delicacies are carried out into the
sunlight by several "old country"-type women. Wine is
poured from generous carafes. Friends and relatives are
everywhere, laughing and enjoying themselves; apparently
the party has come here straight from the church. Presents
for the new baby are being opened by Nico's wife, Sara,
*
and Nico's mother, ROSA.
SARA
*
Mama, look at this -- all done by hand.
Sara lifts a cute baby outfit.
*
ROSA
Nico had one just like this.
Thank
you, Cora.
Cora, an aunt, proudly smiles.
34
NICO
Holding the baby. Realizes that his little son has pooped
in his pants. He turns for help to Sara.
*

NICO
I think we got a little problem here.
SARA
*
(winking at the women)
I carried him for the last nine months,
you take him for the next diaper.
Assorted uncles and aunts watch with amusement as Nico tries
awkwardly to deal with the problem.
NICO
(to all)
That's what you get for not marrying a
Sicilian.
Sara lets Nico struggle a moment, then takes over.
*
SARA
*
My brave husband. He's not afraid of
thieves and muggers, but he's terrified
when his son poops in his pants.
Toscani relatives look on with approval at the happy couple
and their baby.
35
ANOTHER PART OF BACK YARD
Three Chicago cops, LUKICH and HENDERSON in plain clothes
and LIEUTENANT STROZAH in uniform wolf some Italian goodies
while eying the group of celebrating relatives.
LUKICH
(indicates Nico
across the patio)
Toscani holds the record... for havin'
more relatives under federal indictment
than any other cop in Chicago.
36
TWO OF NICO'S UNCLES
BRANCA and LUIGI, who
look like they have been on the other
side of a cop's work,
are in turn eying Lukich and Henderson
-- plus a cluster of
other cops in civvies hovering around
the buffet table like
vultures.
BRANCA
Look at these stiff dicks. A free meal
and they come out like flies.
37
STREET OUTSIDE NICO'S HOUSE - DAY
An unmarked police car pulls up. DOLORES JACKSON ("Jax"),
another undercover cop, tall, black, and elegant, enters
the driveway leading to Nico's back yard --
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87
10.
38
BACK YARD
Jackson enters. She's impeccably dressed and radiates
intelligence. She's greeted warmly by Lukich, Henderson,
Strozah, and a couple of other cops.
STROZAH
I didn't do nothing, Counselor.
I'm
clean.
JACKSON
Eight more days, Lieutenant. You
better start preparing your defense.
HENDERSON
Baby, I'm gonna put you on retainer.
LUKICH
You passed the bar? I make it a
point never to pass the bar.
Jackson sees Nico and Sara across the yard, waves and
*
starts toward them --
39
BACK TO BRANCA AND LUIGI
Luigi indicates Jackson as she crosses the patio.
LUIGI
Now this cop.
She can bust me any
day.
40
NICK, SARA AND ROSA (NICO'S MOTHER)
*
Jackson comes up, makes a theatrical appreciation of Nico's
stylish attire, kisses Sara and greets Nico's mom warmly.
*
She starts oohing and ahhing over the baby.
41
VARIOUS SHOTS
Young kids playing on the lawn, more guests arriving, Father
Genarro dancing with an elderly matron. We see that Nico's
friends are an electric mix. Cops, art-y types, people of
varied ages and professions.
42
BACK TO JACKSON
Holding the baby.
JACKSON
Look at this little bundle.
What a
cupcake!
NICO
You give up being the D.A. and hurry
up and find the right fella, Jax.
You might have time for one of these
yourself.

SARA
*
Nico, will you let the woman
catch her breath?
43
JAPANESE WOMAN (DR. WATANABE)
*
moves in shyly on the fringe of the cluster. While Jackson
and Sara continue their "mom" talk, Nico edges off toward
*
Watanabe, shaking her hand with real pleasure.
*
NICO
Watanabe!
Say hey, Doc.
They begin jabbering in Japanese.
We will meet Watanabe again later. She's a brainy-looking
*
woman -- reserved, a bit mysterious -- who talks quietly and
*
intensely in Japanese with Nico like they're old friends who
go back a long way.

44
Branca, Luigi and several other Toscani patriarchs smoke
cigars and sip beer in a cluster. Nico holds Julian.
BRANCA
You're a father now. Are you gonna
take me up on my offer?
NICO
I'm happy, Branca.
I like what I do.
Branca glances seriously to the other uncles, then, with a
smile, pats Nico's cheek.
BRANCA
Look at this face! Six-foot-four,
pretty as the statue of David. And
he's a cop!
Branca laughs. From a distance, Watanabe watches, missing
nothing. Across the porch, Lukich and several other cops
observe and try to listen.
BRANCA
This face should be sticking up from
a white shirt. It should be a banker,
a businessman, someone who earns a
decent living for his family!
NICO
We're happy.
LUIGI
Nickels and dimes. Your wife's a
woman with class. What did she run
-- a ballet school...?
NICO
An art gallery.
BRANCA
Same thing. She wants a husband who
carries a briefcase, not a shoulder
holster.
Jackson watches Nico trying to keep his good humor. This
is serious stuff, despite the light tone. Branca's eyes
meet Nico's.
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87

BRANCA
You wanted to get shot, you got shot.
You wanted to get knifed, you got
knifed. You've had your fun. Basta!
Enough!
UNCLE GUISEPPE
Let your family help you, Nico.
NICO
(lightly)
Uncle Gio, that kind of help I don't
need. I'd rather get shot by someone
I don't know.
Jackson and Lukich crack up. The others follow.
For the
moment, the tension is dispelled.
45
Festivities still in progress. Nico passes through,
nodding, thanking people for coming, taking farewells.
Jackson waits for him, glancing at her watch.
48
moves into the central city.
50
POV THROUGH CAR WINDOWS - STREETS - MOVING
Bad-looking hombres on stoops, street corners.
NICO (O.S.)
I promised the Lieutenant, I'm
gonna take care of you. Broken
windows and lost kittens for your
last week.
WIDEN SHOT to include Nico and Jackson.
JACKSON
And then you're gonna come visit
me in a nice, clean, air conditioned
office --

The unmarked car pulls up outside a liquor store and bar.
52
Three young STUDS have ambled to the window of her parked
car.
STUD
Hey, sister, what it be?
With infinite boredom, Jackson lifts her badge -- and
gun. The Studs shuffle away.
58
Jackson looks up from the car to see Nico -- wild-haired,
shirt ripped and bloody -- emerging from the adjacent
apartment stoop, leading young Lucy, who's tear-streaked,
wearing a torn dressing gown. Instantly, Jackson is out
of the car, moving to Lucy.
JACKSON
It's okay, girl. Mama Jax is
here.
She wraps an arm around Lucy, helps her toward the car.
JACKSON
(to Nico)
That was some leak you took.
From the door of the bar, several bloodied heads peek.
JACKSON
Broken windows and lost pussy cats,
huh.
Jackson checks out her battered partner.
JACKSON
You're one crazy bastard, Toscani.
Nico opens the rear door, helps Jackson ease Lucy in.
NICO
We'll get her some clothes and a
bath. I'm not bringing her home
to her grandmother like this.

From the front seat of Nico's car emerges a tearful Lucy,
in fresh clothes and looking miserably contrite. Nico
walks her inside.

*
The Zingaro family is busy preparing for the night's baking.
Grandpa and Grandma Zingaro leave their work and receive
their waif-like granddaughter. With eyes watering they
thank Nico. They disappear upstairs with Lucy. Jackson,
standing in the doorway, has seen all this.
64
Jackson, back in her normal daytime wear, exits a
building. She gets into Nico's car.
67
A short, slick-looking Latin man in a business suit emerges
from the building.
JACKSON
That's our stud.
Nico and Jackson leave their car and follow him on foot.
69
ABANDANO meets a striking-looking middle-aged woman in front
of a stately financial institution. They go in. Jackson
remains out on the street, while Nico follows the couple in.
70
LATER
Jackson has been waiting, sipping some coffee. Nico
emerges from the bank, signaling to his partner to follow
him. Abandano and the woman exit from the bank's revol-
ving doors and immediately jump into a cab. Nico and
Jackson look at each other and step in front of another
cab. Nico opens the cab door, flips his badge open, then
asks the occupant to leave. Jackson gets in the front
seat next to the protesting cabbie.
71
Abandano and the woman are crossing the plaza as Nico and
Jackson run up the block. Near the entrance to the Federal
*
Building, a small but vocal group of protestors are
*
gathered, carrying signs and chanting slogans. The frus-
*
trated cabbie watches them in the background.
72
PLAZA
Jackson and Nico watch Abandano and the woman pass the
*
crowd of demonstrators and enter the building. Jackson acts *
indifferent, almost frustrated; Nico keenly senses something.
CUT TO:
73
Rusting cyclone fences surround
a mud-lot repair yard in a
dingy industrial section. Young
Lation and black workers
finish up for the night; through
the dirty, security-barred
office window we can see Chi Chi
talking on the phone. The
lawyer, Abandano, is also there.
78
Nico finishes connecting a small transmitter which has
been hastily wired to the entering phone line.
79
Chi Chi emerges from the office, tucking a scrap
of paper into his pocket. Abandano follows. They get
into a late-model Lincoln which pulls out onto the street.

NICO, JACKSON AND LUKICH
The two men, dressed as meat processors in hard hats and
bloody white coats, rake cattle guts under the eave of a
packing plant. Jackson, dressed like a USDA Inspector and
*
carrying a clipboard, inspects a few hanging carcasses.
JACKSON
You missed a few spots, boys.
LUKICH
I'm takin' it home t'a make
kilbasa, boss.
Luke casts an impatient glance across the street to a lot
with four parked meat trucks. We glimpse two "truckers"
keeping low in the shadows of one cab. Down the block a
seemingly empty pickup truck is parked in an alley.
LUKICH
This ain't a bust -- it's a
convention.
NICO
Don't you like company, Luke?
(sarcastic)
We got all the scouts here --
Drug Enforcement Agency, the
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms --
WALKIE-TALKIE (V.O.)
Keep this channel clear, Toscani.
We realize Nico, Jackson and Lukich are wired, with mikes
out of sight under their coats. Nico glances to the pick-
up, near to which three men can be spotted in the alley.
Apparently one of them is the walkie-talkie voice.
NICO

BATTERED VAN WITH TWO MEN
emerges from a corner, two blocks down.
It starts slowly
this way.
1ST WALKIE-TALKIE (V.O.)
All right. Everyone get their
heads outa their ass.
The meat truck men duck down out of sight, the pickup men
back into the shadows. Nico and Lukich keep raking cow
guts. The van passes slowly, checking out the area.
JACKSON
(sarcastic)
'... And so I quit the police
department... got myself a steady
job -- '
The van accelerates slightly, turns a corner, vanishes.
Silence.
LUKICH
*
They spotted me. I'm too good-
looking to be a meat slopper.

1ST WALKIE-TALKIE (V.O.)
Will you hot dogs shut up?
The van returns.
On a cross street.
Heading behind the
packing plant.
NICO
*
(to Lukich)
*
You're too ugly.
Now a second car appears. The Lincoln. Behind it is an
ancient station wagon. Both vehicles take a different
cross street, but both heading behind the packing plant.
NICO
(into hidden mike)
Here we go, boys and girls --
(to Jackson)
You stay put.
*
As soon as the two vehicles pass out of sight, Nico and
Lukich ditch their rakes, dart into the packing plant.
The meat truck men START their TRUCK.
30.
The pickup men board their vehicle -- Jackson follows Nico
and Luke -- but at a safe distance.
100
The station wagon men heave their rear door open, the
van men start to open their side door. The Lincoln is
stopped at a distance. Suddenly --

burst from the rear door of the packing plant, guns drawn.

who's a cop and who's a criminal.

NICO AND LUKICH
dive for cover, RETURNING FIRE. The DEA men in one truck
also OPEN UP. One of the van men is hit between the eyes.
MACHINE GUN FIRE rakes the DEA truck; it spins out of
control; flips. Lukich SHOOTS the machine-gunner.
LUKICH

seat, Salvano on the passenger side.

Nico UNLOADS his .45 into the windshield and the firewall.
The Lincoln keeps coming down the narrow alley.

CLOSEUP - SALVANO
Nico's fingers now

order to save his
boss.

slamming the drug dealer up against the van's side.
Lukich, Jackson and Strozah are there, with the DEA cops,

all covering the other men.

(to Salvano)
How many kilos you got in there,
Skivuzo?
Salvano couldn't answer if he wanted to. The other cops
look at Nico with awe. Lukich whips the van door open,
yanks a tarp off the cargo.

Nico and Jackson's car pulls out into traffic.

flowers, makes
eye contact with a car down the block.

SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF CHURCH
Salvano and Chi Chi, seeing nothing, enter the church.

From a doorway and a shattered window smoke pours forth.
We hear SCREAMS from inside.

The congregation streams out in terror-stricken disarray.
We see Nico's family -- they're all right.

talks with neighborhood people, asking questions.
190
Nico in the alley, grilling several tough guys we saw be-
fore when he raided this bar. The answers are all zero;
Nico's disgusted, worn out, frustrated. He starts out
the alley -- At the edge of the street, a battered van pulls
in. A jacketed LATINO MAN leans against it, an unlit ciga-
rette in his mouth. As Nico approaches, turning toward
his car --
FIRST LATINO
(polite, casual)
'Cuse me, sir. Can I bum a light?
Nico slows, eyeing the
guy dubiously. As he reaches to
his jacket -- The side
door of the van flashes open. A
.38 is leveled straight
at Nico's head. Instantly three
other Latino hoods leap
to the sidewalk.
FIRST LATINO
(machete under jacket)
Don't even think about it,
motherfucker.
Machete Man (First Latino) snatches Nico's gun from its
shoulder holster. Two hoods shove Nico back into the
alley. Nico checks out his assailants quickly. Four of
them. Machete, CROWBAR, BALL BAT, GUN.
MACHETE MAN (FIRST LATINO)
You come to our streets... fuck
with our people. Now our people
gonna fuck with you.
The five advance on Nico.
PIPE MAN
We ain't gonna shoot you, man.
We gonna beat you to death. You
gonna learn what it means to 'get
down.'
191
QUICK CUTS
A)
Nico is
trapped. The hoods advancing. Nico has a
moment
of stillness, as if all senses are clicking
out of
normal gear and into some hyper-combat readi-
ness.
Then:
49.
B)
Gun and Machete Man are side by side. As Machete Man
starts to move, Nico spins in beside him, seizes his
wrist, twists it violently, wrenching the machete away,
keeping Machete Man between him and Gun Man so Gun
Man can't shoot. In a flash, Nico swings the machete,
slicing over the top of Machete Man, half-severing
the wrist of Gun Man. Gun Man falls, clutching his
wrist in agony; the gun skitters away beneath a chain
link fence, out of reach. Nico flips Machete Man
(who has Nico's gun in his pocket) sending him crash-
ing, half-unconscious.
C)
Instantly, Pipe Man aims a home run shot at Nico's
head. Nico uses the machete, matches the angle of
the oncoming blow, slides under and, in the same arc,
blocks the blow and turns it into a strike, slashing
Pipe Man's tendons behind the knee. Pipe Man goes
down on one knee, writhing, hamstrung, crying out in
pain.
D)
Now Ball Bat attacks. Nico intercepts the blow,
flips Bat Man ass over teakettle, sending him sail-
ing -- feet first -- through the side window of the
van. Bat Man CRASHES THROUGH the GLASS, hung up with
just his head and shoulders dangling free.
E)
Nico is spread out, feet wide, in a crouch. Crowbar
Man sees his chance. He is the fiercest of the four,
and the savviest fighter. He throws three consecu-
tive vicious blows at Nico's head; Nico drops to one
knee, dodges the blows, then intercepts the third,
machete in hand, matches the arc of interception and
whips the blade up -- straight into the crotch of
Crowbar Man. Crowbar Man can't believe it. He re-
mains frozen a moment, staring at Nico, then down at
his own groin.
F)
Machete Man, the first to be flipped, struggles des-
perately to regain his senses. He tries to get
Nico's gun from his own pocket, but Nico bats it a-
way. Machete Man scrambles to his feet, in terror,
bolts.
G)
Nico snatches his gun from the sidewalk, glances to
Bat Man who is still half-dangling from the van
window. Nico gives Bat Man one parting punch to the
head, then tears off after Machete Man --
192
Shrieks from passersby as Machete Man hurtles past,
straight into the street. A car nearly hits him, he
vaults its hood. Here comes Nico, in hot pursuit. He
too leaps the car, whose owner is staring, cursing --
193
ANGLE DOWN BLOCK
An all-out foot face.

Machete Man is a speedster; he hurdles a row of trash cans.
TWO YOUNG GIRLS, on a stoop, whistle as he passes.
FIRST GIRL
Fly, baby!
194
NICO
tears after this human cannonball.
Amazingly, he's
gaining --
195
Machete Man bolts from the bodega into a small patio with
tables and chairs. He leaps the fence into the next yard,
which belongs to a funeral home. He hurdles the headstone
inventory, clambers up the fence on the far side --
197
BACK TO NICCO
pursuing along the same route.
198
MACHETE MAN
claws his way to the top of the fence and onto a frame-
work of two-by-fours which form an arbor-like canopy a-
bove the third back yard. Plastic sheeting is tacked
between the beams. Machete Man glances back at Nico,
starts out -- tightrope-style -- across the two-by-fours.
Nico reaches the fence behind the hood, starts also onto
the two-by-fours. We hear FEMALE SCREAMS from below as
the rickety structure starts to wobble precariously.
Machete Man reaches the far side. A fire escape is ad-
jacent; he grabs for it, starts up. Nico catches him by
the ankle. The two crash together back onto the two-by-
fours, which give way, sending them plunging into --
199
BACKYARD OF FLOWER SHOP - DAY
Four young Oriental women, potting plants, react with
terror as the two bodies CRASH through. Machete Man
scrambles away from Nico but is trapped in the corner
next to the rear shop door. The flower girls can't move
either; Nico and the hood are too near the door. The
girls retreat to the far corner, squealing in fright.
MACHETE MAN
(to Nico, in terror)
No, hermano. Please --
51.
Nico starts menacingly toward the hood, breathing hard
from the chase.
NICO
Who put up the money?
MACHETE MAN
What money?
Nico grabs him by the hair.
NICO
You didn't come after me for a
piece of ass.
(twists the youth's
neck)
Who paid you?
MACHETE MAN
I told ya!
No one!
Nico slams him with a fierce shot to the ribs. The hood
doubles over, gasping. The flower girls shriek even
louder. Nico turns to the girls with a ferocious glare.
NICO
(shouting)
Shut up!
The girls instantly go silent in terror. Nico turns back
to Machete Man, spins him violently face-down, jacking
the punk's right arm straight out behind him. We see
that Nico can break his elbow with one blow.
NICO
Give it to me!
Nico raises his fist to strike.
MACHETE MAN
Jimmy Constanza!
Nico shoves the hood into the ground, tearing the hood's
wallet from his trouser pocket. Nico rips the wallet a-
part, seizes the kid's identification and holds it up. He
grabs the punk by the hair with his free hand. Machete
Man is staring up in terror, wondering what this means.
NICO
If you're lying to me, I'll come
and kill you right in your own
fucking kitchen.
Nico dumps him on the ground and walks away.
Instantly
Machete Man changes his tune.
MACHETE MAN
Salvano!
Bautista Salvano!

Nico walks back, his foot smashes into the punk's face.
He hits the ground with a thud.
NICO
Gracias, muchacho.
Nico walks away.

MONTAGE WITH SCORE
A)
We recognize Fox, Nico's buddy
from SE Asia whom we met
in the opening sequence.
Fox,
too, of course, looks 15
years older. He wears a
suit
and seems quite prosperous.
We are unable to identify from
where Fox calls.
FOX
You should know not to use a name
on an open line.

I'm gonna talk for fifteen
seconds, then I'm getting off.
You're in trouble, Nico.

FOX
You hear me? Now. I'm risking my
ass by telling you this. Good

206
BACK TO NICO'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT
The PHONE CLICKS DEAD. Nico tries to keep a casual ex-
pression. Sara sees through it -- she knows he's shaken.

SARA

(grim)
That was Fox, wasn't it?
Nico doesn't answer.
SARA

(very concerned)
Why is the C.I.A. calling you at
two in the morning?
NICO
It's okay, sweetheart --
(crosses to her, puts
his arms around her)
-- You know what a crazy bastard
Fox is. He gets drunk and forgets
he's halfway around the world. He
calls me.
Nico gives her a squeeze and a smile.

JACKSON (CONT'D)
They're refugees from El Salvador,

Jackson has an armload of notes, including photocopies of
news clippings.
JACKSON
Ready for this? One of the people
killed at the church was definitely
not a congregation member.
She shows Nico and Lukich the Polaroids we saw her take in
the morgue.
JACKSON
Alan Singletary. He's an aide to
Senator Harrison.
Nico is electrified.
JACKSON
That's right. Harrison. Foreign
relations committee. The guy who's
been crawling all over the Central
American drug connections.
NICO
(impressed)
You're gonna make a helluva D.A.,
Jax.
LUKICH
God help us.
JACKSON
(savors the com-
pliment)
I've been at the Tribune all night,
wearing out their Xerox machine.
Harrison's staff has been
compiling some kind of white
paper. He's due to release it
next week.
Nico's mind races.
NICO
That's how Fox knew.
JACKSON
What?
Nico turns to Lukich, dead earnest.

NICO
Luke. I
want you to go to my

Call Branca... my mother

ready to move out.
LUKICH
You got it, buddy.
NICO
Stay with 'em. We'll be there.
LUKICH
What's going on, Nico?
What
happened?
NICO
I got a call last night. An old
agency friend. He told me my
family was in danger.
Jax and Lukich can't put all the pieces together yet.
But
if it's drugs-CIA-Senate, it's got to be heavy.
LUKICH
You got a weapon?
Lukich knows he doesn't. He glances up and down the
street, makes sure no one's watching -- then cracks the
driver's door of his car. There's a bulge in the map
pocket. Nico
pulls out a Sig Saur .45.
LUKICH
Try this on.
Jackson watches Luke slip Nico a clip.

You see this list? Well, I'm not

Nico admires his partner's guts, but he's worried.
JACKSON
I'm not a rookie, Toscani. Now,
go home. Get your family out of
here.
Nico agrees.
The pair starts to split.
NICO
(calls after
Jackson)
Just paperwork, you understand?

Nico's car pulls up at a stop light. He looks around
without really seeing. An old lady pulls a shopping cart

ANOTHER CAR
ROARS up out of nowhere, without two men inside, SCREECH-

FOUR MEN
As their magazines empty. The last shells spring free,
GUN BARRELS SIZZLE, blue smoke fills the air. The leader
waves two men forward to check their kill. At that
instant:
233
NICO
springs to his feet behind the men, the Sig Saur .45
*
clutched in both hands. (He has crawled under both cars
to envelop his attackers.)
NICO
Over here, you sons-a-bitches!
Nico's rage is superhuman. The men stare in conster-
nation. One of the men has a fresh magazine half into
his weapon --
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87
65.
NICO
(eyes like an
animal)
Try it. Be my guest.
The man lets the magazine clatter to the street. The
others raise their hands. It takes all Nico's strength
to keep from wasting all four of them on the spot. His
gaze swings wildly around the intersection. He spots a
corner grocery store. A phone inside.
NICO
(gestures with gun)
Over there! Move it! -- Now!!
The men are scared shitless. They put their hands in
back of their heads; trot jelly-legged --

Branca's sedan is half-loaded; Branca adds a few more bags.

Lukich comes around from the front, glancing around like a
lookout.
NICO
Where's Jax?
LUKICH
She thinks there may be documents at
some guy's apartment.
Nico starts toward the rear basement door.
Lukich falls
in with him.

Nico, Lukich and Jackson are speeding through the infamous
Southside. We want to scream at them to get there already.

Salvano holds the priest's arm steady, Zagon moves in with

ZAGON
You came here to talk to the

FATHER TOMASSINO
I tried.
But you killed him first.

ZAGON
Who told you about our plans?

FATHER TOMASSINO
This is from confession. I tell no
one.
ZAGON
You wouldn't lie to me, Father?
It's
a sin.
Father Tomassino says nothing, he begins to cry.
ZAGON

If you spoke to anyone, tell me now --

The unmarked police car pulls up, across the street.

Nico and Lukich exit the vehicle. Nico indicates an adjacent
building; he and Lukich start for it.
298
Nico and Lukich emerge from the roof door, guns drawn. The
roof is empty. Antennas, skylights, clotheslines. The pair
creep soundlessly onto the next roof. They cross toward the
roof door like infantrymen, moving one at a time from cover
to cover, covering each other. They reach the door that
leads down into the building. Nico checks the far side of
the enclosure, nods to Lukich. Lukich cracks the roof door
open --

STAIRWELL FROM ROOF - NICO AND LUKICH
Nico and Lukich creep down the stairs from the roof.
Nico
opens the door leading to the top (third) floor.
301
Nico highballs from the stairwell as the tarpaper roof erupts
all around him with GUNFIRE from the floor below! He dives
sideways, rolling to avoid the fire -- He recovers his
footing in time to see Salvano and Zagon burst onto the roof
from the stairwell. Nico's BULLETS miss them; they separate,
taking cover behind two walls at the roof's margins. Nico
is trapped -- in the open.

ZAGON AND SALVANO
pop back out, aiming at Nico --

A cleaner, more upscale neighborhood. Nico labors down the
steps, clutching his jacket to his ribs. Several affluent
people look at him oddly, he ignores them, keeps going -- He
makes his way up the street, weakening, to a tasteful brown-
stone. Nico climbs the steps in pain --
QUICK DISSOLVE TO:

From the darkness, Nico appears, barely making it up the

Branca and a bodyguard come forward, grabbing Nico as Nico
almost collapses.
BRANCA

NICO
The motherfuckas got Jackson.
BRANCA
Lukich called. She's not dead.
She's gonna make it. She was

Nico can't believe it. In spite of it all, life comes to
him. A little smile...

You got the architect's drawings?
Wiring, floor plans --
Nico indicates a briefcase he is carrying.
NICO
It's all here.
Nico turns to his uncle.
Regards him with affection.
