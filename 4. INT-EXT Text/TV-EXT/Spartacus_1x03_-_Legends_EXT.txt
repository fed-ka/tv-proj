  Spartacus  manica SLAMS the side of KERZA S head, sending 
  him crashing to the sand. Spartacus charges in, raising his 
  wooden practice sword to bash Kerza.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Spartacus!

  Spartacus pauses. Doctore approaches, curling his whip. 
  VARRO and a knot of other GLADIATORS glance over from their 
  training.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        You charge without thought. A 
                        weakness your opponent could turn 
                      to advantage.

                                          SPARTACUS
                                  eyes Kerza)(
                        A difficult feat from his backside.

                                          DOCTORE
                        You speak without thought as well.

  Lightning fast, Doctore sweeps Spartacus  legs out from 
  under him, sending him crashing to the sand.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Another weakness.

  CRIXUS, the top gladiator and Spartacus  rival, LAUGHS 
  heartily alongside BARCA.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    2.

                                        BARCA
                        Thracians. Always on their backs, 
                        with legs spread.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Where they belong.

                                          DOCTORE
                                (locking eyes with 
                                  Spartacus)
                        Forget everything you have learned 
                        outside these walls. For that is 
                        the world of men.

  Spartacus rises as Doctore proceeds to march across the 
  lineup of Gladiators. Hammering his point home.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                      We are more! We are Gladiators!

  The men roar with pride.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Study. Train. Bleed. And one day 
                        your name will be legend, spoken in 
                        hushed whispers of fear and awe. As 
                        the city speaks of Crixus, the 
                        champion of Capua!

  The men laugh and cheer. Crixus grins at Spartacus, who 
  eyeballs him a  fuck you  in return.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        But his legend was not birthed in 
                        the arena. It was given life here. 
                      In this ludus. Under the sting of 
                      my whip!

  Doctore cracks his whip.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Attack!

  Training resumes. Kerza rushes Spartacus with malicious 
  intent, and we begin the TRAINING MONTAGE: The sun rises and 
  falls. Days and weeks pass as we witness  Spartacus  crash 
  course into the brutal world of the gladiator.

  SPARTACUS SWINGS HIS SWORD

  and Kerza swings to meet him, MORPHING into



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    3.
  CONTINUED:

  HAMILCAR

  as their swords connect. They parry back and forth, a test 
  of mettle. Spartacus kicks him back. As Hamilcar rolls to 
  his feet, he MORPHS into

  VARRO,

  Spartacus  friend from 102. This is a fight. Varro defends a 
  move, grins, then counters with a volley of his own. A 
  worthy adversary, Varro takes several swings at Spartacus, 
  who just manages to deflect them with his wooden shield.

  SPARTACUS

  spins and counters, knocking Varro s sword loose. Spartacus 
  smashes him with his shield, slamming Varro to the ground. 
  He leaps atop him, pressing his wooden sword to Varro s 
  throat. Spartacus pauses, looking to

  DOCTORE

  as ASHUR limps over. Doctore scowls at Spartacus, turns to 
  Ashur. Spartacus pulls Varro up from the sand.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I show him victory, and receive 
                        scowls for the effort.

                                        VARRO
                        Why should he reward a stroke of 
                        luck?

  Spartacus grins at the shit-talking, helps Varro up. An 
  obvious camaraderie.

                                          DOCTORE (O.S.)
                        Attend! The Vulcanalia is 
                        announced!

  Doctore waves the scroll Ashur handed to him. Spartacus and 
  Varro turn and follow the rest of the Gladiators as they 
  start to gather around Doctore.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Vulcanalia?

                                        VARRO
                        A festival to ward off wildfires.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        The bowels stir and a Roman 
                        declares a festival.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    4.

  Varro LAUGHS as the two come to a halt at the back of the 
  men. All eyes focused on Doctore.

                        Batiatus has seen fit to fight 
                        twenty at this year s Vulcanalia. 
                        His gift to the people of Capua!

  The men trade looks, excited.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Our lowest shall fight at dawn. 
                        Eight pairs to follow. After which 
                        your master will present his 
                        primus. Two of our finest, to meet 
                      in the arena!

  The men laugh and cheer. Spartacus eyes Crixus across the 
  throng of men. To Varro:

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Crixus, then?

                                        VARRO
                        Crixus certainly.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        And his opponent?

                                        VARRO
                        Against the Champion of Capua? What 
                        would it matter?

  OFF Spartacus, eyeing Crixus, his wheels turning...



  Barca, stripped to the waist and covered in blood, swings 
  his sword. MAGO, a powerful, weathered older man with a 
  great white beard, equally bloodied, meets the blow with his 
  own sword. They FREEZE FRAME, the background still moving. 
  [NOTE: This is not a full fight, only the specific moments 
  written, as all the arena flashbacks will be.]

                                        VARRO (V.O.)
                        Barca. And the chief of his people, 
                        the noble Mago. Skill and the 
                        testament of years were his allies.

  A different moment of the fight. Mago slices Barca s arm. 
  Barca FREEZE FRAMES, BLOOD SPEWING. Mago continues the arc 
  of his sword in slow motion.

                                        VARRO (V.O.)(cont'd)
                        Strength and youth Barca s.

  The final moment of the fight. Mago drops to his knees in 
  slow motion, blood streaming from a gash on his head. His 
  eyes look up as Barca raises his sword with both hands to 
  thrust down.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    8.

                        Mago fell to his knees...

  Mago smiles. A look of pride filling his eyes as Barca rams 
  the sword down into his chest. They FREEZE FRAME, blood 
  exploding in slow motion.

                                        VARRO (V.O.)(cont'd)
                        And Barca became the Beast of 
                        Carthage.

  We PULL BACK as the scene fades, replaced by Spartacus in --



  RAMEL, a jeweler, opens his portable stand to display his 
  wares. Lucretia surveys the pieces with a critical eye.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        That one.

  Lucretia points to an OPAL NECKLACE. Ramel passes it to her 
  for inspection. She turns it in her hand, then holds it out 
  to Naevia. Not having a mirror, Lucretia uses Naevia as her 
  own personal doll to see how items look.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        Put it on.

  Naevia takes the necklace and clasps it on, the small opal 
  resting slightly above her breasts. Naevia glances down and 
  can t contain her smile.

                                        NAEVIA
                      It is quite pleasing, domina.

  Lucretia frowns.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Too common. Show me something of 
                        note.

                                        RAMEL
                        A moment. I have just the thing.

  Naevia removes the necklace, saddened to part with it. Ramel 
  produces an EMERALD NECKLACE, holds it out for inspection.

                                          RAMEL(cont'd)
                      My finest piece. A flawless gem 
                        imported at great cost from the 
                        mines of Scythia.

  Naevia takes it, puts it on. Lucretia likes what she sees.

                        The price?

                        Thirty?

  Lucretia frowns at the cost. She considers the necklace, her 
  wheels turning.

                          Twenty-eight, then.

  Deal done, Lucretia and Ramel head back inside. As Naevia 
  follows, ANGLE DOWN TO --



  Crixus has paused to stare up at Naevia. Barca passes, 
  taking a practice sword and shield from a rack.

                                        BARCA
                      No longer value your eyes?

                        thought and do your heart service.

  Crixus frowns, retrieves his own practice sword and shield. 
  The two begin to spar. Continue on past this pair and the 
  rest of the top men training. We catch POPS of all the 
  various styles: Murmillo, Retiarius, Thraex, etc.

  DOCTORE

  leads the newer Gladiators in a choreographed drill. The men 
  follow his instructions, working in perfect unison. A sight 
  similar to cadets in the military.

                                          DOCTORE
                        One -- Thrust! Two -- Shield up!

  The Gladiators thrust their swords forward and then raise 
  their shield arms high. Doctore continues shouting numbers 
  and corresponding moves as CAMERA passes Kerza, then Varro, 
  and finally finds

  SPARTACUS

  following Doctore s orders with precision. A new 
    determination after his conversation with Batiatus. 
  Spartacus makes another move when suddenly

  SURA S BINDING

  comes loose, fluttering out from under his manica. Spartacus 
  momentarily stops his training to secure it.

                        I am a Thracian. Sprung from my 
                        mother s belly with sword in hand.

  The men chuckle. Doctore joins them.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Thrace. A swamp of piss.

  Doctore whips out his dick and relieves himself in front of 
  Spartacus. A beat. The chuckles stop. Doctore finishes.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                      On your knees!

  Spartacus locks eyes with Doctore. A tense beat. Finally, he 
  gets down on his knees in front of the wet sand. Doctore 
  stalks around him, addressing the men.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        The lands from which you hail 
                        matter no longer. All that does is 
                        the sound of my voice... and the 
                        sand beneath your feet. You will 
                        learn to worship it.

  Doctore kicks Spartacus in the back, sending him face first 
  into the wet sand. Crixus and the Gladiators HOWL. Sand 
  sticks to Spartacus face, gets in his mouth. He spits, 
  glaring. A GUARD appears, motions to Crixus.

                                        GUARD
                        You are summoned.

  Crixus follows the Guard as he heads to the villa. He grins 
  at Spartacus as he passes.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Sand smells of Thrace. Perhaps I 
                        should shit to complete the aroma.

  The Gladiators LAUGH. Spartacus  eyes burn with hatred. 
  Crixus exits, WIPING US TO --



  Kerza crashes to the sand, his legs hopelessly tangled in 
  Gnaeus  Retiarius net. Gnaeus pounces, pressing his trident 
  to Kerza s throat. Doctore barks to the rest of the men 
  watching the training session.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Never lose focus! Not if Jupiter 
                        were to rip open the heavens and 
                        dangle his cock from the skies!

  Kerza s face flushes red with shame.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                          A gladiator s first distraction is 
                        his last. But not all contests end 
                      in death...

  Doctore glares at Kerza.  Kerza sighs in failure, extends 
  his right arm, raising two fingers.  An act of submission.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Two fingers. A sign of surrender. 
                        And shame.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    17.
  CONTINUED:

  Doctore waves Gnaeus off.  Spartacus glowers, grumbling to 
  Varro.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        The oath I swore to this place did 
                        not including begging.

  Doctore whips his head around, having heard. Varro quickly 
  tries to cover.

                                        VARRO
                      He inquires as to the nuances of--

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I need no lesson in submission.

  Varro sighs. There s no helping Spartacus now.

                                          DOCTORE
                        You favor a different lesson? In 
                        obedience, perhaps? To the hole! 
                        Both of you!

  Varro does a double take -- me?



  DECIMUS and TIBERIUS emerge through the swirling sand in 
  Slow Motion. No weapons, just claw-like fingers. They have 
  matching long oily black hair, yellow eyes, and are covered 
  in blood and grime.

                                        ASHUR (V.O.)
                        The bodies of stout men left in 
                        their wake, half devoured. No one 
                        dared face them willingly. Except 
                        for one...

  DECIMUS and TIBERIUS evaporate, replaced by Crixus. He 
  snarls, raising his sword. FREEZE FRAME, the dust continuing 
  to swirl around him, blood splatter turning the background 
  red (very much like the early blood test footage).

                                        ASHUR (V.O.)(cont'd)
                        Crixus! Champion of Capua!

  Reverse, on Crixus as DECIMUS and TIBERIUS each swipe at 
  him. Crixus FREEZE FRAMES, blood arcing in opposite 
  directions from the blows.

                                        ASHUR
                        The blood flowed. The crowd roared. 
                        And the demons fell beneath his 
                        sword...

  Crixus swings his sword. DECIMUS and TIBERIUS FREEZE FRAME 
  as the blade completes its deadly arc, SEVERING BOTH THEIR 
  HEADS. Blood splatters. We PULL BACK as the scene fades, 
  replaced by Ashur in --



  The sun blazes. Spartacus, Varro and several other men work 
  a short obstacle course. Three spinning posts are set up, 
  each with a wooden sword attached. The men must jump over 
  the first, duck under the second and leap the third. Crixus, 
  Barca, and other top men spar. Ashur lurks.

  SPARTACUS

  jumps, ducks and leaps -- deftly making his way through the 
  obstacles and to the other side. A moment later Varro joins 
  him. The man behind them trips, gets clocked in the face, 
  goes down. Spartacus and Varro take a moment, catching their 
  breath.

                                        VARRO
                        I keep pace with the mighty 
                        Spartacus. Still place my worth 
                        among the dregs?

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I misspoke.

                                        VARRO
                                  laughs)(
                        A theme with you, is it not?

                                          SPARTACUS
                                  laughs)(
                        I will call you equal. More will 
                        need to be earned.

                                        VARRO
                      It will be a good fight. May the 
                        gods see us both survive.

  Spartacus  mirth fades.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        There are many I would see dead in 
                        this place. You are not among them, 
                        Varro.

                                        VARRO
                        You may not have a choice.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        There is always a choice.

  Spartacus spots Gnaeus casting his net at a wooden gladiator 
  dummy. Spartacus  eyes narrow in thought, a plan forming.

                                        VARRO
                        That look gives me worry.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Words I ve heard often from my 
                        wife.

  Spartacus calls to Gnaeus with a smile.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        Your net s aim is remarkably true, 
                        Gnaeus.

  Gnaeus doesn t respond. The compliment s odd, nothing more.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        You strike an impressive figure. 
                        Battling that little wooden man.

  Gnaeus pauses, gives Spartacus a good eye-fucking. Varro 
  tenses. Yeah, this isn t good.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        I long to see you in the arena. 
                        Among the men, there you are... 
                        with your fearsome net! Like a 
                        young, wet girl tossing flower 
                        petals.

  Gnaeus snarls, dropping his net and charging Spartacus.

                                        GNAEUS
                        Fucking cunt!

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    26.
  CONTINUED:

  Spartacus spins out of the way at the last second, sending 
  Gnaeus flying head first into one of the practice dummies. 
  The impact is brutal, an explosion of blood. Gnaeus goes 
  down, out cold.

  AN UPROAR

  fills the square. The men hoot and laugh at the spectacle of 
  a man down. Doctore approaches. The men go silent. Doctore 
  glances down at Gnaeus, then at Spartacus. Spartacus acts 
  bewildered.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        The sun has made Gnaeus mad. He 
                        charged like crazed goat.

                                        VARRO
                        I saw his eyes. They were wild with 
                        thirst.

  Doctore eyes them both. A tense beat.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Barca! Kerza! Tend to Gnaeus.

  ON THE BALCONY,

  Naevia has stepped out to see what the fuss is about.

  CRIXUS

  glances up at her, then turns his attention back to 
  Spartacus, the animosity palpable. Ashur shuffles past, is 
  startled when Crixus calls to him.

                                        CRIXUS
                                (an intensity in 
                                  his eyes)
                        Ashur. There is something I want 
                        you to get for me.

  Ashur grins, instantly sliding into the willing salesman.

                                        ASHUR
                        Whatever your needs, Ashur 
                        provides.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Let us talk in the shade, beyond 
                        prying ears...

  He moves off with Ashur in tow, WIPING US TO --                                                                                    27.



  BODIES litter the sands. A lone FIGHTER (sans helmet), 
  bloodied from an unseen attacker, stands with trembling 
  sword. The ground RUMBLES. The orange sun bleeds red. 
  Lightning FLASHES.

                                        KERZA (V.O.)
                      He stands ten feet tall. The ground 
                        trembling at his feet. His shadow 
                        eclipsing the sun.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    41.

  The Fighter FREEZE FRAMES as a massive shadow falls across 
  him, causing everything but his EYES to go black.

                        Most men fall dead at the very 
                        sight of the giant.

  TIGHT ON the Fighter s eyes, the indiscernible, shadowy form 
  of the giant reflected in them, holding two swords (a 
    DIAMACHAERUS).

                        They are the fortunate ones.

  The eye reflection rears back its swords and slams them 
  down. The SCREEN SPLATTERS WITH BLOOD, obliterating the 
  Fighter. PULL BACK as the color fades, replaced by Kerza as 
  we transition back to --



  The stands are filled with the blood-thirsty. A day s worth 
  of wine and sun has only fueled the crowd s fervor.

  THE PULVINUS

  Batiatus mingles with Mercato and MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS, a 
  large man with the commanding air of an untrustworthy 
  politician.

                        Truth told, I feared the event 
                        would pass with nothing of note 
                        this year.  So difficult to procure 
                        men of worth for these minor games.  
                        Good Solonius was already taken 
                        with loftier engagements.

  Batiatus musters a strained smile.

  He moves off to confer with other guests.  He passes 
  Ilithyia, who sits fanning herself against the heat, 
  Lucretia by her side.

                        Perhaps I was wrong to return 
                        absent the rain.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Some water. Or maybe wine.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Uhh, the thought churns the 
                        stomach. Your company last night 
                        yet astounds the senses.

                      Of wine, definitely. Of other 
                        interests... I think the surface 
                        barely scratched.

  She giggles, her eyes sparkling. Lucretia motions to Naevia, 
  who pours a cup of water for Ilithyia.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    44.

                        Water then, to slake your current 
                        thirst. Of the other, when do you 
                        leave for Rome?

                                        ILITHYIA
                      My husband demands me on the path 
                        tomorrow.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Too brief a visit.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        I ll conspire to return with haste. 
                        I m curious to discover what new 
                        delights lurk in the house of 
                        Batiatus.

  Batiatus appears at Lucretia s side.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The proceedings go well. A pity 
                        Solonius is not present to witness.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        After what the Thracian did to his 
                      so called gladiators? My husband 
                        still fumes of retribution.

                                        BATIATUS
                        A cause I d gladly support.

  HORNS SOUND. Batiatus grins.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Here we go, then.

  The Magistrate addresses the crowd.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        Good citizens of Capua!  It is with 
                        great honor I present to you the 
                        primus of Quintus Lentulus 
                        Batiatus!

  The crowd CHEERS, the excitement palpable.  Lucretia beams 
  with pride as Batiatus steps forward to address the crowd.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Enter Thraex!




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    45.
  CONTINUED:

  The CHUTE GATE grinds open and Spartacus trots out onto the 
  sand. A huge moment -- the first time we ve seen Spartacus 
  fully geared up in the arena. The crowd roars.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Behold Spartacus! Renowned for his 
                        magnificent victory at the munus of 
                        Senator Albinius! Where he 
                          singlehandedly slaughtered four of 
                        Solonius  gladiators!

  More cheers.  The Magistrate frowns at the remark.  Batiatus 
  waits for the applause to die down, continues.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Enter Murmillo!

  Crixus emerges from the opposite chute, trotting out onto 
  the sands. The roar that greets him is deafening. Far 
  greater than the response to Spartacus.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        The marvel before you needs no 
                          introduction! You know him by his 
                        sword! By his shield! By his glory! 
                        Behold Crixus! The Champion of 
                        Capua!

  The crowd goes insane.  Ilithyia strains forward, dazzled by 
  the sight of Crixus.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Finally, Crixus!  Look how his form 
                        catches the sun!

  Lucretia musters a smile, Ilithyia's obvious desires towards 
  Crixus not sitting well.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Positions!

  Spartacus and Crixus take their positions.  They move to the 
  center of the arena to square off.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                      In honor of the name Batiatus and 
                        the sacred Vulcanalia --

  Batiatus is interrupted by the ROAR of the crowd, a reaction 
  to Spartacus rushing Crixus like a fucking lunatic. A breach 
  of protocol, and one which catches Crixus off-guard. TIME 
  SLOWS


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    46.
  CONTINUED:

  as Spartacus  sword slices through the air. Crixus barely 
  bends out of the way as Spartacus  sword glances off the 
  broad brim of his helmet. CLANG!!! Sparks fly.

  TIME RESUMES

  as Spartacus continues his assault, driving his shield into 
  Crixus  chest. Crixus stumbles, struggling to maintain his 
  footing. The arena buzzes with the possibility of an upset.

  LUCRETIA

  whirls on Batiatus.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        You had not yet finished the 
                        oration yet the Thracian attacks!?!

  Ilithyia presses forward, her eyes dancing.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Was that not supposed to happen?

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        No, it was not.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        How exciting...

  The crowd ROARS.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The crowd seems in agreement.

  Lucretia fumes, her attention returning to --

  THE ARENA

  Spartacus arcs his sword, reflecting the sun s light. Crixus 
  raises his long shield to defend. Spartacus presses his 
  assault. We

  DIVE INTO SPARTACUS  HELMET,

  his face dripping with sweat, eyes burning with 
    determination. We PULL BACK OUT as

  CRIXUS

  expertly deflects each blow with his shield. We




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    47.
  CONTINUED:

  DIVE INTO CRIXUS  HELMET,

  his own face dripping with sweat, his eyes sparkling as he 
  grins. This is what he lives for. We PULL BACK OUT as

  SPARTACUS

  charges Crixus, who nimbly sidesteps him like a matador, 
  slamming his shield against Spartacus  helmet for good 
  measure.

  THE PULVINUS

  BOOS and MOANS erupt from the crowd. Ilithyia frowns in 
  disappointment.

                                        ILITHYIA
                      Is that all the Thracian is capable 
                        of? After what he did against 
                        Solonius  men, I had hoped for 
                        more.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        The crowd seems in agreement.

  She arches a brow at Batiatus. His turn to fume.

  THE ARENA

  Spartacus is tiring, his shoulders hunched forward, his 
  steps becoming heavier. He charges Crixus who deflects with 
  his shield, sending Spartacus crashing to the ground.

  CRIXUS

  extends his arms wide to the crowd, making a show of it.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Capua! Shall I begin!?!

  THE PULVINUS

  Ilithyia laughs and claps her hands. Lucretia grins at 
  Batiatus. Now that s more like it. Naevia watches from 
  behind her, caught up in the drama.

  THE ARENA

  Crixus trots toward Spartacus, gaining speed. No more rope-
  a-dope, time to finish this guy off. He swings his sword 
  furiously. Over and over again. Driving back Spartacus, who 
  is clearly struggling to keep up.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    48.
  CONTINUED:

  SPARTACUS REACTS

  as Crixus juts his shield forward, but it s a misdirect. 
  With his free hand, Crixus whirls his sword around and 
  SLICES Spartacus across the leg. Blood spews.

  CRIXUS SPINS,

  catching Spartacus in the helmet with his shield.

  SPARTACUS  POV

  from inside his helmet. The gratings SHAKE VIOLENTLY as the 
  aftershocks of Crixus  blow resonate. Spartacus tries to get 
  a bead on where Crixus will strike next, but it s hard 
  because there are now a

  HALF DOZEN CRIXUSES

  rushing forward, all PULSATING wildly through the grates. 
  THE ARENA

  Spartacus raises his sword, but Crixus knocks it aside with 
  his shield and swings his sword, connecting with Spartacus  
  helmet. The helmet flies off as Spartacus crashes back, 
  blood arcing in slow motion from his mouth.

  VARRO LOOKS ON

  through the iron gates of the chute. Watching his friend 
  crumple. Knowing the end is near.

  SPARTACUS

  tries to rise, dazed and bloody. Crixus smashes the sword 
  out of his hand and plants his foot on Spartacus  neck. 
  Spartacus chokes, too dazed to wrest himself free.

                                          CRIXUS(cont'd)
                        Now you die.

  Crixus raises his sword for the death blow in slow motion. 
  Spartacus  eyes drop to Sura s binding, which has come half 
  undone from under his manica. It flutters gently in the warm 
  breeze, a remembrance of why he fights -- and why he must 
  live.

  SPARTACUS RAISES TWO FINGERS

  to the Pulvinus. The missio, the sign of surrender. A total 
  humiliation for Spartacus, but the only way which he can 
  ever save Sura. The crowd hushes. Crixus turns to the 
  Pulvinus in surprise.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    49.

  The Magistrate frowns in dissatisfaction

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        A sour bite to end the meal.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Apologies.  Yet Spartacus was of 
                        some cost to me...

  The Magistrate starts to exit, done with pleasantries.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                      Do what you will.  You've already 
                        lost the crowd.

  The Magistrate exits.  Batiatus throws his hands out to 
  address the crowd.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Spartacus has fought bravely!  Let 
                        him live to fight another day!

    A smattering of cheers, but mostly jeers and boos. Lucretia 
  stares, shocked and dismayed. Batiatus keeps up a forced 
  grin. Ilithyia sighs.

                                        ILITHYIA
                      No more blood?  How disappointing.

  She rises to leave, WIPING US TO --
