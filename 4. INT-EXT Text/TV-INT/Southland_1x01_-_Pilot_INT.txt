      LYDIA ENGSTROM, mid 40's, wearing a skirt suit from Kohl's
      and modest heels, is leaving the apartment she shares with
      her mother, ENID.  Puts down her cup of tea, grabs her keys,
      a bagel, and a small black leather duffel bag.

                                      LYDIA
                          (calling out to her)
                    What do you want for dinner?  You
                    want me to pick something up?

                                    ENID ENGSTROM (O.S.)
                    I'm fine.  I'll eat the fish from
                    last night.

                                      LYDIA
                    Alright.  Call me if you change your
                    mind.  Bye, Ma.


      As Lydia walks down the pathway to her car at the curb. 
      Suddenly, from the bushes...

                                      MAN'S VOICE.
                    Do you want some?

      Lydia stops, can barely make out a man, who is partially
      hidden by the bushes.

                                      LYDIA
                    Excuse me?

                                    MAN
                          (louder now)
                    Do you want some?

                                      LYDIA
                    Gee, do I want some?

      She approaches him, opens her duffel, reaches for something.

                                      LYDIA (CONT'D)
                    Hold on, let me get a closer look. 
                    That way I can make a better decision
                    for myself here.

      He steps out, and from her expression we can tell he is
      exposing himself. Before he knows what has happened, she has
      cuffed him and is marching him towards her car.  Puts him in
      the backseat, careful not to bump his head.

                                      LYDIA (CONT'D)
                    What's your name and date of birth,
                    sir?

      Lydia picks up the radio in her car, calls it in as she starts
      the car and pulls out --

                                      LYDIA
                    Good morning.  One King 54.  Show me*
                    Code six at Burbank and Olive with*
                    one in custody --

      The dispatcher obviously recognizes her from her voice --

                                      LYDIA (CONT'D)
                    Oh, hey, Della.  How's your son? 

      She laughs, listens as Della tells her something about her
      kid.

                                      LYDIA (CONT'D)
                    That's cute. I've got a 311, Stanley
                    Sidelsky, 8-20-60 --*
                          (as she holds)
                    Thanks, Della.

      Appraises him in the rear view mirror as she drives --

                                      LYDIA (CONT'D)
                    Stanley, you the Valley Molester?

                                    STAN
                    Oh God, no.  Nothing like that.

                                      LYDIA
                    Stan, I gotta tell you, I've seen
                    one before.  You do this to a kid? 
                    That's very, very bad.

                                    STAN
                    I know.

                                      LYDIA
                    What can we do about this?  Have you
                    been in therapy?

                                    STAN
                    I've tried -- lots of different
                      modalities. 

      She turns to look at him.  He starts to cry. Lydia hands him
      a tissue from a box on the dash. *

                                                                                  CUT TO:      LAPD - "Pilot" FULL BLUE  -  9-9-08                       4.


      Lydia hands Stanley over to a BOOKING OFFICER at the jail. 
      Even at this hour, we can see men in cages, misdemeanor on
      one side, felony charges across from them.

                                      BOOKING OFFICER
                          (rote)
                    Are you sick, disabled or on
                      medication?

      As they start to book Stanley into the LifeScan computer,
      she goes to leave --

                                      LYDIA
                    Get some real help, Stanley.  Don't
                    give up.  Keep trying. 


      RUSSELL, 42, lives in Copland.  Castaic, Simi Valley, Valencia
      and Santa Clarita.  Most cops don't live in Los Angeles
      proper, nor would they want to live in the same community
      where they put people away.  Russell has three teenage
      children who have already left for school, and his irate,
      still good looking wife, DINA, sits in front of a computer. 
      She is blogging as he talks to Lydia.

                                      RUSSELL
                          (laughing)
                    So, wait, he exposed himself to you?

      Dina is annoyed at his complicity with Lydia.  He listens
      for another moment then hangs up.  Leans over to see what
      she is writing.  We can see that her blog is called "I LOVE
      A COP", only because the graphic is big, the rest he can't
      read.

                                    DINA
                    You're a dick.

                                      RUSSELL
                    You should consider changing the
                    name to "I hate a cop".


      We have been HEARING OVER the sound of the ball hitting the
      wall.  It abruptly stops.  The father, Brad, concerned, goes
      to the window and looks outside.  Kayla is gone, her mitt
      lies on the ground, the ball nearby in the burnt up grass.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

                 "SOUTH LOS ANGELES 9:45 AM"


      A 17-year-old black kid, HENRY COLE, picks up a pink cellphone
      lying on a table, goes to the front door.  Behind him, a
      display case is filled with sports trophies and medals.



                                                                (CONTINUED)      LAPD - "Pilot" FULL BLUE  -  9-9-08                      10.

      His 13-year-old sister, SHAMIKA, comes out of her bedroom,
      still in her pj's, carrying a Toni Morrison book, "Beloved"
      that she can't put down.  

                                      SHAMIKA
                    You can't take my phone.

                    it.

                    I'm calling Ma.

                                      HENRY
                    So, call her.  Explain to her why
                    you still at home on a schoolday.

                                      SHAMIKA
                    I got strep throat.  That girl you
                    textin' with is a ho.

      Henry laughs, takes the phone and goes to leave --

                                      HENRY
                    Chill, lil' sis.

                                      SHAMIKA
                    I hate you!

      Henry leaves, exiting out into--


      This is control central for gang/homicide/gang task force,
      and gang drug investigations.  Men in bad suits sit behind
      desks with plastic partitions between them, so all you have
      to do to see the other desks is stand up.  A movie poster
      for "Tombstone"  reads "Justice is coming". Other signs tell
      us "Run and you go to jail tired" and "Always be closing".

      A huge board has all the recent homicide cases listed.  It
      is packed. 

      Sammy and Nate sit across from each other, they work this
      unit.  Sammy is wearing his rumpled jacket, has put on a
      tie.  He's on the phone with his wife.

                                      SAMMY
                    No, I did not have a woman in the
                    car with me.

      He listens for a beat.

                                      SAMMY (CONT'D)
                    I can't talk about this now, I gotta
                    get off.

      Nate has two boys and his wife is pregnant again.  The
      pictures on his desk evidence this.  Sal, who we met in Santa
      Clarita, walks in.  He is their boss, a Detective 3.

      He stops in front of the board, studies it a beat, turns to
      Sammy.

                                    SAL
                    You closed Suarez?

      Sammy smiles, proud.

                                    SAL (CONT'D)
                    He copped out to you?

                                      SAMMY
                    I read the transcripts, he confessed*
                      telephonically.  So I went and talked
                    to him.

                                    SAL
                      Excellent.

      A florid cop, ANDY, who looks stuffed into his shirt collar,
      walks in --

                                    ANDY
                    What'd I miss?  Anything good happen?

                    Didn't you deport that little buster
                    "Droopy" from over at Leimart Park?

                    about marriage again just tell me to 
                    go out, find some chick I don't like

      Shamika is trying her cell phone from a land line.  It RINGS
      and RINGS.

                                                                                CUT TO:


      The pink cellphone is crushed, splattered with blood,inside
      a plastic bag on a gurney.

      Henry is about to be wheeled in to surgery.  He is covered
      in blood.  Nate and Sammy are waiting to interview him, but
      he is still unconscious.  Nate is trying to get hints off
      his tattoos, making notes in a small notebook, as a nurse
      flirts with Sammy.  He pulls away, walks over to Nate --

                                      SAMMY
                    When's somebody gonna claim this
                    kid?  He has no ID on him.  His tatoos
                    tell you anything?  He a Blood?

                                    NATE
                    I don't think so.

      Sammy's cell phone rings.  He looks at the number and ignores
      it.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      A call comes over the radio --

                    It's probably a DB call.

      John studies him for a beat.

                                    JOHN
                    So, what is this for you --it's gonna
                    look good on the resume or something? 
                    Nice little stepping stone till you
                    land some cushy job?  Go be a slap-

                      probation's over?  Sound about right?

                                    BEN
                    I'm a cop, same as you're a cop,

                    I doubt it, Richie-Rich.

      A beat then --

                    When I joined up, this was the only

                    digging ditches.

      A long beat.  Ben doesn't say anything.

                                    JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Don't tell me you need the paycheck.

      A group of people wait on a long line to talk to the DESK*
      OFFICER.  Among them is Henry's sister, Shamika, who sits*
      waiting with the others, reading her book.  Andy and Kenny
      No-Gun beckon Sal over.  The Desk Officer has his hand over*
      the phone.

                    uterus was stolen, wants to talk to
                    a female Detective.  I kid you not.

      Sal shakes his head.

                                    SAL
                    Fine. Send it up to Wilder, let her
                    handle it.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      The THREE GIRLS from the bus are sitting together upstairs,
      on a little bench, leaning their heads on each other's
      shoulders, texting.  Sammy comes out and looks at them for a
      moment.  Kenny No-Gun approaches.

                                      KENNY NO-GUN
                    They tried to get video footage off
                    the Dash bus, but you have to hit
                    the emergency brake hard or hit the
                    button for the video to work, and
                    the driver didn't do it.

      Sammy shakes his head, frustrated --*

                                      KENNY NO-GUN (CONT'D)*
                    She'll be home around 8, she lives
                    in Hacienda Village, says you can
                    come over, but she's not coming in,
                    she can't get a sitter.

                                      SAMMY
                    Great.

      Just then, his cell phone RINGS.  He looks at the number,
      thinks about picking up this time.


                                                                (CONTINUED)      LAPD - "Pilot" FULL BLUE  -  9-9-08                      31.

      In the BG, the three girls, Andy, Sal, other cops working
      gangs.  A busy afternoon. 


      His wife Tammi is high, waiting for Sammy to pick up his
      cell.  She is sitting on the couch with Richter.  His entire
      snout is covered with the day-glo orange powder from the
      giant bag of Dorito's that rests on her lap.  She is  stuffing
      fistfulls of them in her mouth.  Then Richter puts his snout
      in the bag, convulsively wolfing down this forbidden treat
      until she pulls his head out.  They take turns.  When Sammy
      finally picks up --

      We intercut between them --

                                      TAMMI
                    Honey, you have to come home.

                                      SAMMY
                    What happened?

                                      TAMMI
                    We have to talk.

                                      SAMMY
                    What happened, Tammi? 

      She starts to cry, spits the huge mouthful of Dorito's out
      into her hand, Richter eats it off her palm --

                                      TAMMI
                    Will you just come home, please?

                                      SAMMY
                    You sound funny.

                                      TAMMI
                    I'm  so sad!
                          (beat)
                    I'm so sad all the time.

                    I'm in the middle of a case.  A kid
                    got shot.

                                      TAMMI
                          (overreacting, high)
                    No!  No!  Why all this death?  Rape
                    and PCP and AK 45's, and Glocks and
                    guns and making you breakfast at
                    midnight.  It's not normal, honey.

                    Why do you say "deceased" all the
                    time?  Why can't you just say someone
                    died?  Why are they "deceased?" I
                    hate that.

                                      SAMMY
                    He's not dead.

                    It's not that simple.

                                      TAMMI
                    Why not?  Why not?  Of course it is.

      John and Ben enter next, John holding the flashlight.  He

      Sammy and Nate are in one of the interview rooms with one of
      the girls, JANILA, who bounces her leg nervously under the
      table.  Nate is taking notes.

                                      SAMMY
                    You wanna tell me what you saw,
                    Janila?

                                      JANILA
                    People who snitch come up missing.

                                      SAMMY
                    I know. But that's not what's
                    happening here.  I have lots of
                      witnesses, so what you tell me is
                    just corraborating what we already
                    have.

      Janila doesn't say anything.

                                      JANILA
                    My Mom says not to say anything.

                                    NATE
                    Janila, why you wearing purple?  You
                      affiliated with Grape Street?

      Her leg starts kicking harder under the table.

                                      SAMMY
                    That's cool.  You got a boyfriend in
                    Grape Street?

      She nods yes.

                                      SAMMY (CONT'D)
                    Janila, help me out here.  I promise
                    you, I'll keep you out of it.

                                      JANILA
                    It don't work like that.

                                      SAMMY
                    Where'd you hear that?

                                      JANILA
                    I learned that before I learned the
                    alphabet.

      Sammy laughs.

                    I went on the website once.  You

      Andy is moving around restlessly.  Sal is on the phone with
      his wife trying to get a time-out for later.  Kenny No-Gun
      is filling out reports.  Andy finally lands in front of
      Kenny's desk.  Reads another quotation Kenny has posted on
      the wall of his partition --

                    night to visit violence on those who
                    would do us harm."

      Kenny stands up, loses it --

      Andy comes into a cell where a shaved headed guy, MIGUEL
      RAMOS, 22, sits on a bench.  He is covered in tattoos.

                                    ANDY
                    Droopy, what'd you go and kill that

                    I swear, I didn't do that.  It was
                    somebody looks like me.

                                    ANDY
                    I hate when that happens.

                          (changes the subject)
                    I got a new tattoo.  You always like

      He pulls up his shirt.  It is a tattoo of a man hanging by a
      noose with the words "Mama Tried" written next to it.

                                    ANDY
                    Good one.  You know that song?

                    about that.  That was Avenues for

                    over here?  That makes no sense.

      Sammy and Nate are sitting on the couch of this small duplex
      in Hacienda Village.  They each have been served a glass of
      iced tea.  The Dash Driver, DONNA, a middle aged woman who
      has put on huge fluffy slippers and a t-shirt that reads
      "when it rains, it pours," sits across from them without
      saying a word.  Behind them, in the kitchen, a huge middle
      aged man, WILL, hovers menacingly.

                                    NATE
                    When we spoke earlier you said you
                    had a pretty good view of the men
                    from the front window of the bus --

      Nate reads aloud from a pad--

                                    NATE (CONT'D)
                    "I got a good look at all three of

                    No, no.  I never said that.

      She looks over at Will.  Sammy's had enough.

                                      SAMMY
                    Excuse me.  Does he have to be here?

                                    WILL

                                      SAMMY
                    Your kid isn't here.

      Will shrugs.  He's not leaving.  Sammy stands up to go.  So
      does Nate.  Donna walks them to the door.

                                      DONNA
                    You gotta understand.  I lost two
                    nephews.  My best friend lost her
                    son.  Everybody's lost somebody.

                    We got our own war on terror right
                    here.

      They are quiet for a long beat.  Then --

                                      SAMMY
                    Thank you for your time.


      As they enter, Shamika and the Desk Officer turn to look at*
      them.  He beckons them over.  Sammy and Nate approach.  We
      don't hear what they have to say, but we understand that she
      is being introduced as Henry's sister.  Someone is finally
      claiming this kid.

      Sammy takes Vernita over to a little waiting area, Nate goes

      Lydia comes to.  She is sitting out of the rain, against a
      wall.  Across from her is ARSHAM, the Armenian man who lives
      with his mother.  He is holding her gun, is very agitated. 
      Lydia shakes her head, trying to clear it, puts her hand up
      and feels blood.

                                      LYDIA
                    It's Arsham, right?  Is that your

                    I didn't want to hurt her.  But you
                    know, she starts screaming and I
                    panic so I put my hand over her mouth.

                    I need to go in your apartment and
                    find her, Arsham.

      She stands up, and so does he.  He looms over her, starts to
      pace.

                    I'm going to go in now.

      She doesn't care if he shoots her.  She walks into the
      apartment, which is dark.  Feels for a light switch.  The
      ants are swarming towards one of the bedrooms.  She moves
      towards it, opens the door to his bedroom.  The ants are
      moving towards the closet.  She opens the door.  

      We cut to his mother, AGATA, who is now in the doorway in
      her bathrobe.

                                      AGATA
                    What do you do, Arsham?!  What do

      Shamika has decided to spend the night, waiting for Henry to
      wake up.  She is still reading "Beloved."  Ben is at the
      nursing desk talking to a nurse. 

                                    BEN
                    His name is Dewey.
                          (occurs to him)
                    That's probably a nickname.

      As she continues to look --

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    He's a cop.

      She nods, knows exactly who he is asking about --

                                      NURSE
                    He's in surgery.

                                    BEN
                    Is it okay if I wait?

      She gestures at the waiting area, help yourself.  Ben sits
      down, across from Shamika.  A long beat.  Then --

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    I like that book. 

      Shamika looks up,studies him for a beat.

                                      SHAMIKA
                    How come you read this book? 

      Ben is going to lie, but then decides not to --

                                    BEN
                    My black studies class.

      She shrugs dismissively and goes back to her reading.  After
      a beat--

                                      SHAMIKA
                    For real?

      He nods yes. They both can't help smiling now.  Such a relief
      to find anything amusing.

                                    BEN
                    I'm sorry.  Is he going to be okay?

                                      SHAMIKA
                    They say so.

                                    BEN
                    Alright, good.  That's good.
                          (beat)
                    You need me to do anything?  Check
                    with anybody about anything?

                    He's sleeping right now.

      Ben nods again.  After a beat.

                                      SHAMIKA (CONT'D)
                    You a cop?

      Ben is quiet for a long beat.  Then he makes a private,
      pivotal decision and looks up at her.

                                    BEN
                    Yeah.  I am.
                          (lighter, joking)
                    We have a look or something?

                          (points at his head)
                    It's the hair, that's all.

                          (kidding her)
                    I don't look mean or anything?

      She shakes her head no, they both continue to smile, in on
      the joke of this horrible day, pleased they found a little
      common ground.

                                                                                CUT TO:*

      He locks her window and leaves the room.  The neighbor's dog
      starts BARKING.  He takes out his gun and moves to the door.

      Sammy comes into the bedroom.  Tammi is asleep, with Richter

      takes off his jacket, hangs it on the back of a chair. 
      Removes his gun, takes it over to a closet.  Gets out a lock
      box, locks it up, replaces it on top of the closet.  Looks
      over at his wife, who ignores him.  He goes into the bedroom,

      John has changed out of his wet clothes into jeans and a t-
      shirt.  He's buying a small bottle of pills from a man in
      the restroom of the bar.  He pays the guy, the guy leaves. 
      John takes one of the pills, swallows it down with a sip
      from his beer, which he is still holding.  Puts the pills
      back in his pocket.  Rubs his hip.

      A young, very good looking man has come in, stands watching
      him.

                    Uh-huh.

      The man approaches, holds out his hand.  There are two lines
      of meth or coke or something on his palm.

                                      YOUNG MAN

                    You just bought something.

      John approaches him, pours beer into his hand, ruining the
      drugs.

                                    JOHN

                    dollar a year job, my pension and my
                    belief system for you?  Get away
                    from me or I will bring a whole barrel
                    of ass-whupping down on your head.

      The man moves off.  John rubs his hip again and tries to
      straighten up.  His back hurts and his legs hurt.  He moves
      out into the main room, sits down at the still jumping bar. 
      There are no women here.  John sips his beer.  The man next
      to him turns to him.

                    I had the day from hell.  I got
                    arrested.

      John turns to look at him.  We recognize him as the guy from
      the back of the Vice car who they arrested.  John moves over
      a seat, just wants to drink his beer in peace.  Dead silence,
      then he finally volunteers --
