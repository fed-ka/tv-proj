          OVER DARKNESS, a whisper...

                                              CHLOE (O.S.)
                          Susie... Susie...

          FADE IN:

  1LEWIS' BEDROOM - 4:00 AM (NIGHT)1

          A light switches on and a very pregnant CHLOE leans over
          her sister's bed.  She's freshly showered, hair neatly
            combed, fully dressed.

            LEWIS is sound asleep.  Chloe gently shakes her shoulder
          and she lets out a slight groan.

                                              CHLOE
                          Susie...

                                              LEWIS
                          Ah, Chloe.  I worked 'til one in
                          the morning.

                                              CHLOE
                        I think it's time... for the
                          baby.

            Lewis doesn't lift her head, doesn't open her eyes.

                                              LEWIS
                          You sure?

                                              CHLOE
                          Unh-huh.

                                              LEWIS
                          You're having contractions?

                                              CHLOE
                          Unh-huh... every couple minutes.

          And now, as Lewis's head darts up, eyes bursting open...

                                              LEWIS
                          What?!

                                                                          SMASH CUT TO:          ER - "Motherhood" - Rev. 4/7/952.

  2LEWIS' LIVING ROOM 2

            Lewis is frantic, running back and forth, climbing over
            furniture, grabbing things, pulling on a pair of jeans,
            crawling into her sneakers.

                                              LEWIS
                          Why did you wait so long?

                                              CHLOE
                        I had stuff to do.  Take a shower.
                                    (holds up grocery
                                   bag)
                          Pack the baby clothes.

                                              LEWIS
                          Your contractions are two minutes
                          apart, Chloe.  We should be at the
                          hospital.

                                              CHLOE
                        I thought you needed the sleep.

            Chloe stands patiently by the front door, ready to go,
            grocery bag in hand.  Lewis tucks her cartoon T-shirt
          into her jeans as she indelicately grabs her cat by the
          back of the neck, runs into her bedroom.

                                              LEWIS
                          You picked a hell of a time to
                          start being considerate.

          She emerges without the cat, throwing on a coat, as
            Chloe's hit with a contraction, lets out a brutal scream.
            Lewis comes up close, takes her by the shoulders.

                                              LEWIS
                          Breathe, Chloe, breathe.

                                              CHLOE
                                    (through scream)
                        I forgot my music.  Can you get
                          the tape player?

                                              LEWIS
                          Lug that thing?

                                              CHLOE
                          Susie-cakes, please.

            Lewis bolts over the sofa, grabs a boom box.  There are
          25 homemade tapes resting on the tabletop -- some marked,
          some unmarked, some boxed in plastic, some not.

                                              LEWIS
                          Which tape?

                                                                          (CONTINUED)          ER - "Motherhood" - Rev. 4/7/952A.

                          The "White Album."

            Lewis looks, then sweeps them all into her purse, starts
            looking for something else.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      3.

                                              LEWIS
                          Dammit, where are my keys?

            Lewis claps her hands together twice.  Chloe's screaming
          in pain.

                                              LEWIS
                          Chloe, stop a second, I've got to
                          clap for my keys.

            Chloe holds her breath a beat as Lewis claps twice again.
          A BEEPER GOES OFF.  She runs toward the sound, finding
          her keys on the kitchen counter, then heads for the door.

                                              LEWIS
                          Okay, let's go.

                                              CHLOE
                          Wow, this is scary.

          And they're out the door.

                                                                        CUT TO:


3ER - AMBULANCE BAY 3

            CARTER stands at the Admissions Desk drinking a cup of
            coffee as the Ambulance Bay doors swing open and Lewis
          and Chloe pile in, both taking short breaths, panting.
          Like dogs.

                                              LEWIS/CHLOE
                          Hee, hee, hee, hee... Hee, hee,
                          hee, hee.

                                              LEWIS
                          We're almost there; keep panting.

                                              CHLOE
                        I want drugs!  Now!

          The ER's quiet, nearly empty, just some guy waxing
          the floors.

                                              LEWIS
                          Carter, get over here.  I need
                          your help.

            Carter joins them as they move down the...                                                                                      4.

  4MAIN HALLWAY 4

            Lewis looks at his cup.

                                              LEWIS
                          Is that coffee?... Thanks.

          She grabs the cup from his hand as he grabs a wheelchair,
            helps Chloe into it.

                                              LEWIS
                          Contractions are ninety
                          seconds apart.

                                              CARTER
                          Why did you wait so long?

          A look from Lewis.

                                              LEWIS
                          Get her up to OB.  I'm going to
                          call Coburn.

            Lewis, boom box in hand, heads back to the Admissions
            Desk.  Carter rushes a screaming Chloe down the hall.

                                              CARTER
                          You're going to be okay, just
                          breathe.

                                              CHLOE
                                    (wincing)
                          What is with you people and this
                          breathing thing?

          She reaches back, grabs Carter by the necktie, yanks him
            down.  He's choking, his neck crammed into her shoulder.

                                              CHLOE
                          Have you ever had a baby?  Do you
                          think that really helps?  Just
                          give me some drugs!!

            Lewis slams up, unloads the boom box on top of the desk,
            spilling coffee on her coat, then pulls a personnel list
          from a drawer, thumbs through looking for Coburn's number.

          She looks at her watch, spilling her coffee again.

                                              LEWIS
                          4:30, my sister's here, membrane's

            Lewis hangs up, starts off, pivots back, grabs the
          boom box.

                                                                        CUT TO:

7OB DELIVERY ROOM 7

            Chloe's out of her clothes, in a gown.  Carter and OB
            nurse MARQUEZ help her onto the delivery bed as Lewis
          runs in.

                                              LEWIS
                          Dr. Coburn's on her way.
                                    (to Marquez)
                          Susan Lewis.  I'm her sister.

                                              MARQUEZ
                          Marquez.

                                              CHLOE
                          Oh, my God.  Shoot me, please.
                          Somebody shoot me.

            Marquez shifts down to Chloe's legs, drapes them, checks
            between them.  Chloe's wincing in pain.

                                              LEWIS
                          Hang on, Chloe, won't be much
                          longer.

                                              MARQUEZ
                          No kidding.  This baby's
                          crowning.

            Lewis checks.  Marquez is right.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)          ER - "Days Like This" - Rev. 4/6/956.

                          Oh, God.  Coburn will never make
                          it.  Who else is on?

                                              MARQUEZ
                          O'Melveny.  But she's doing a
                          crash C-section in Four.

            Chloe's breathing hard, yelling, wincing in pain.

                                              LEWIS
                          Okay, let's shift her up.

                                              CHLOE
                          Susie, Susie, I can't do this,
                          okay?  I can't do this.

                                              CARTER
                          Come on, Chloe, blow.  Right
                          through the pain.

                                              CHLOE
                          No, no, I can't, really.  It's a
                          bad idea.

            Marquez helps Lewis into a gown and gloves as Chloe
          gets another major contraction, screams.

                                              LEWIS
                          You're going to push on the
                          next one, okay, Chloe?  You hear
                          me?

                                              CHLOE
                          My music, Susie, I need my music.

                                              LEWIS
                          Carter, grab that cassette player;
                          tape's in my bag.

            Carter fumbles with the bag, pulls a tape out.

                                              MARQUEZ
                          You're doing great, just hang on.

                                              LEWIS
                          Okay, Chloe, let's push now.  One
                          ... two... three... four.  That's 
                          right, a big push... good... good.

            Carter pops one in, pushes the start button and RAP MUSIC
            BLASTS OUT.  In French.  MC SOLAAR'S "Armand Est Mort."

                                                                          (CONTINUED)          ER - "Days Like This" - Rev. 4/6/957.

                                              CARTER
                          Is that French?

                                              LEWIS
                          Seven... eight... nine... ten.  
                          Come on, Chloe.

                                              CHLOE
                          That's the wrong tape.  Where's
                          'Blackbird'?

                                              LEWIS
                          It's the 'White Album,' Carter.

            Carter turns OFF the TAPE, looks through the bag.
            Empties the bag, tapes and junk spilling everywhere.

                                              CARTER
                          The 'White Album'?

          He gives up, resumes helping with Chloe, holds her hand.

                                              LEWIS
                          Chloe, you're doing great.  Just
                        a little bit more.  Another
                          contraction.  Okay, push.  One...
                          two... three... four.

            Marquez helps lift her head up and forward with each
            push.  Chloe starts singing as best she can -- through
          the breathing, the pushing, the pain.

                                              CHLOE
                          'Blackbird singing in the dead of

                          Please.

            Lewis concentrates on the delivery, but starts singing
            along with her sister.  Broken, half-sung phrases between
            pushes and panting.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)          ER - "Days Like This" - Rev. 4/6/958.

                          Don't push.

            Chloe keeps singing.  Carter sees the stand-up mirror;
            rolls it over to the end of the bed.

                                              CARTER
                          Here, Chloe, you want to see?

            Chloe takes one look, lets out a horrendous scream.

                                              CHLOE
                          Oh, my God.  No!

            Carter gets the mirror out of there.  The baby's head is
          out.  Lewis turns to Marquez.

                                              LEWIS
                          Suction.

            Marquez suctions the baby's mouth, nose.  Chloe stops
            singing as Lewis pulls the baby all the way out and up 
          and we hear the sound of an INFANT CRYING.

                                              LEWIS
                          Okay, Chloe, okay.  We've got it.
                          It's a girl.

            Chloe's all sweat and heavy breathing and now tears and
          a huge smile.  Carter's beaming.  He looks over at Lewis
            who's crying every bit as much as Chloe.

                                              LEWIS
                          She's beautiful, Chloe.  A
                          beautiful baby girl.

            Lewis holds the baby while Marquez clamps the umbilical
            cord.  They wipe the baby off, wrap a blanket around
          her and Lewis gently hands the baby down to Chloe.

  8BABY NURSERY - 8:30 AM (DAY)8

            Lewis holds the baby, completely entranced by her.
            HATHAWAY looks on.

                                              LEWIS
                          Chloe says she looks like me.
                          What do you think?

            Hathaway looks closely.  She's a wrinkly little thing;
            looks like an old man sucking a lemon.

                                              HATHAWAY
                          Uh, well, I suppose... maybe.

                          Never thought I'd deliver my own
                          niece.

                          Can I hold her?

                          Are you and Tag going to try for
                          kids soon?

                                              HATHAWAY
                          If we're still speaking after the
                          wedding.  Fifteen of his relatives
                          arrived yesterday; thought they'd
                          come a week early, help us do a
                          few things around the house.

                                              LEWIS
                          Sounds scary.

                                              HATHAWAY
                          When I left this morning they
                          were planning on painting a
                          bathroom.

            Hathaway hands the baby back to Lewis who sets her down
          in her basinette.

                                              LEWIS

  9EXT. ROOF - DAY 9

            GREENE, Carter and a couple of orderlies hurry across
          as a Medivac chopper moves in for a landing.  They scream
          over the ROTOR wash.

                          the ER Sub-I.

            Carter's shocked.

                          Uh, thank you.  I didn't think 
                          you'd decide this soon.  I don't 
                          know what to say.

                          Well, here comes Benton.  Ask him.

            Carter turns, sees BENTON hurrying towards them.  The
            chopper's touched down.  They begin to move in.

                                              CARTER

          The CHOPPER EMT hops out as they transfer a teenage boy
          onto a gurney.  He's intubated with two large bore IV's,

            GOLDMAN assists Ross in corralling the eight Little
            Ranger Scouts, in uniform, running around the hall.
            They're with their chaperone, DOLORES MINKY (35), also in

  21SURGERY WAITING ROOM21

            Carter follows.  Mrs. Schaeffer sits alone across the
            room, slowly stands as they approach.

                                              BENTON

                          with severe head trauma and
                          internal bleeding.

            Carter watches Benton as much as Mrs. Schaeffer who
            remains motionless, staring, beginning to tremble.

                          His heart stopped during emergency

                          minutes to resuscitate him.  We

  30EXAM ROOM #230

            Haleh's with Mrs. Lafferty and Joanie (now with IV)
            who've been moved into Exam Two.  Greene listens with
          his stethoscope.

                                              GREENE
                          The results of the spinal tap were
                          negative, Mrs. Lafferty.  Which
                          means we can rule out meningitis.
                                    (beat)
                          Murmur's a little louder, three
                          over six.

                                              HALEH
                          BP's 80/50.  But her pulse is 120,
                          resps 36.

                                              GREENE
                          Can I see your hands?.

            Greene looks at Joanie's palms.  Then turns her hands
            over, looks at the nails.  She's wearing pink polish.

                                              GREENE
                          That's very pretty.  I have a
                          daughter about your age and pink's
                          her favorite color.  Unfortunately,
                          we have to take it off so I can
                          look at your nails, okay?

                                              JOANIE
                          Okay.

                                              GREENE
                          Haleh, could you find some acetone,
                          take off the nail polish.  Mrs.
                          Lafferty, can I talk to you a
                          moment?

                                                                          (CONTINUED)          ER - "Motherhood" - Rev. 4/7/9533.

            Haleh moves out as Greene steps to the door with Mrs.
            Lafferty.

                                              MRS. LAFFERTY
                          Is it her heart?  They said the
                          murmur wasn't dangerous.

                                              GREENE
                          We need to do more blood work and
                        a chest X-ray.  It could be 
                          pneumonia or possibly early heart
                          failure.

                                              MRS. LAFFERTY
                          Oh, my God.

                                              GREENE
                          Has she had any other injuries
                          recently; any other medical or
                          dental work?

                                              MRS. LAFFERTY
                          She went to the dentist two weeks
                          ago, had her teeth cleaned.

                                              GREENE
                          She might have what's called
                          endocarditis.  Bacteria spreads
                          into the bloodstream, causes an
                          infection around the heart valves
                          ... which we can treat with
                          antibiotics.

                                              JOANIE
                          Mom, can you come here?

          A beat and Mrs. Lafferty goes over to Joanie.  Haleh
            re-enters.

                                              GREENE
                          Let's put her on oxygen. Get a
                          cardiac echo, draw blood cultures
                          times three, then start her on
                          IV oxacillin and gentamycin.

            Haleh moves in.  Greene stares back a beat at Joanie and
          Mrs. Lafferty, then moves out.

                                                                        CUT TO:

                          said you cut your arm.

                          my mother, Ada.

          She points behind and Carter turns, sees 95-year-old Ada
            asleep in a wheelchair.

            Carter checks for a pulse, listens for a heartbeat, lifts
          open an eyelid.  Ada is one dead puppy.  Carter tries not

          to hold up Nina (25, straggly hair, also way too skinny).
            She's unconscious, foaming at the mouth, blood and mucus
            spewing down all over her leather jacket.

                                              EVERETT
                          Please, help me, somebody help
                          me.  Nina's in trouble here.

          Ross calls through the window to the desk.

                          Lydia, need some help.  Jerry, get
                        a gurney and clear Trauma One.

            Everett staggers again, drops Nina to the floor, going
          down on his knees beside her.  Wright hurries around as
            Jerry goes for a gurney.  Ross gets down on the other
          side of Nina, listens for breathing.

            Chloe's forced against the wall, trying to stand clear
          of these falling bodies, holding her baby close, safe;
            staring at this horrific scene unfolding before her.

                                              ROSS

                          What did she take?

                        I don't know for sure.  She did a
                          speed ball, and maybe some downs.

            Wright grabs one from a supply tray, hands it to Ross who
          rips it open, sticks it in Nina's mouth.  He blows in
            several breaths, listens again, then feels her carotid
            artery.

                                              ROSS

            Jerry pulls the gurney in.  They haul her body up onto
          it and Ross starts CPR as they rush towards trauma.
            Everett follows.

          They move fast, on down the hall.  Chloe watches, then
            slowly, almost without realizing, follows; watching as
          they disappear around a corner.

            Chloe rounds the corner and stops.  Just ahead of her is
          a very sweaty, very nervous Everett.  He glances back at
          her, then looks in through the doors.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)          ER - "Motherhood" - Rev. 4/8/9545.

          Ross and Wright, now joined by Malik, have started
            working on Nina.  The door swings back open as Jerry
            moves the gurney out.

            Chloe's, watching, holding her baby close, as Oligario
            comes up.

                          Look at this little baby.  What a

            Chloe now turns, hands the baby to Oligario.

            Oligario doesn't get it, but doesn't ask.

                          Having fun in here, Big Susie?

                          What did you call me?

                          Big Susie... yeah, I like that.

          A slightly flustered Malik comes in.

          They all applaud, Malik laughs.

                          Security's got her restrained in
                          the Suture Room if anyone wants
                          to check out that ear.

          Ross throws a wadded-up paper towel at Hathaway.

                          Carol...

                                              GREENE
                          Thanks, Malik.  I'll be there in
                        a minute.

            Malik leaves and Greene now sees a still-dazed Carter
            standing at the door.

                                              GREENE
                          Hey, Carter, where'd Benton go?

            Carter doesn't even seem to hear him.

                                              GREENE
                          Carter?  You all right?

                                              CARTER
                          What?  Oh, yeah, fine.

  54NURSING HOME - HALLWAY - NIGHT (6:30 PM)54

            Benton hurries down, then slows as he looks ahead, sees
            Jackie's kids, JESSIE, JOANIE and STEVEN, sitting on a
            bench.  They're talking to DR. SANDRA LI.  Li notices 
            Benton, walks down to meet him.

                                              BENTON
                          What is it?  What happened?

                                              LI
                          Dr. Benton, I'm sorry I couldn't
                          get to you sooner...

                                              BENTON
                          What's going on?  They wouldn't
                          tell me anything over the phone.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)          ER - "Motherhood" - Rev. 4/7/9556.

                          Dr. Benton, your mother arrested
                          at 5:15 this afternoon, while I
                          was in attendance...

            Benton just stares at her, hardly able to take it in.

                                              LI
                          We tried to resuscitate her for
                          twenty-five minutes.  We used all
                          our capabilities, but her
                          heart was too weak... and she
                          died.  I'm sorry.

          And now it's Benton who's dazed, numbed.  Listening to
          the very words he's said himself so many times before.
          He moves past Li, slowly walking on down the hall.  
            Staring at the faces of Jackie's kids.  All three faces,
          wet with tears, staring back as he moves towards them.

          He pulls them close, hugs them.

                                              BENTON
                          Are you guys okay?

                                              STEVEN
                          Yeah, Uncle Peter. We're okay.
                          Mama's still in with her.

          He pulls away, moves towards his mother's room.


  55NURSING HOME - MAE'S ROOM55

            There's a mother's day bouquet and several mother's day
            cards on the bedside table.  MAE's body lies still in the
          bed.  JACKIE sits beside her.  She looks around when
            Benton enters, moves to him and they embrace.  After
            several beats...

                                              JACKIE
                          I'm going to check on the kids.

            Benton says nothing, just nods, and Jackie leaves.

          He walks over to his mother, pulls the chair up close to
          her side, sits next to her.  Just watching that beautiful
            face.  Wishing he could watch it forever.  Now he takes
          her hand in his, leans down to kiss it.

            Gently begins to weep.

                                                                        FADE OUT.

  56EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - NIGHT (8:15 PM)56

          Ross shoots baskets as Greene approaches.

                                              GREENE
                          Thought you were off at eight.

                                              ROSS
                          On my way home.  Thought you were
                          having dinner with Jen.

                                              GREENE
                          She's running late.

            Greene grabs the ball away, starts shooting.

                                              ROSS
                          So, are you in the mood to give a
                          little personal advice?

                                              GREENE
                          Not really.

                          Diane's starting to think about
                          our moving in together.

                                              GREENE
                          Sorry, Doug, I'm not touching
                          that one.

                                              ROSS
                          Did you and Jen live together
                          before you got married?

                                              GREENE
                          She says we barely live together
                          now... but the answer's no; her
                          father would've killed us.

                                              ROSS
                          So you bowed to the Reverend's
                          wishes?

          Ross takes another shot, then lets Greene take the ball,
            leans back against the wall.

                                              GREENE
                        I don't like to think of it that
                          way exactly... what're you going
                          to do?

          The ball bounces near Ross and he hangs onto it.  Greene
          sees that he's serious.
                                                                          (CONTINUED)          ER - "Motherhood" - Rev. 4/7/9558.

                          Did you know when you were ready?

                                              GREENE
                          Yes.

                                              ROSS
                          So if I don't know does that mean
                          I'm not ready?

            Greene just looks at him, then looks away.

                                              ROSS
                          Yeah, that's what I figured.

            Greene takes the ball, starts shooting again.

                                              GREENE
                          Does your lack of readiness have
                          anything to do with Carol getting
                          married next week?

                                              ROSS
                          What's that supposed to mean?

                          Maybe it'll be liberating.

            Greene looks over at Ross who shrugs, says nothing. 

                                              GREENE
                          Does your lack of readiness have 
                          anything to do with my making the
                          next shot?

                          Okay, if I make it you're ready;
                          if I don't, you're not.

            Greene aims, throws, and as the ball sails through the
          air, we...

          He joins her by the window, starts pointing.

                          there is Moe and that, of course,
                          would be Curly Joe...

                          I've delivered a lot of babies,
                          but I don't think I ever realized
                          just how little they are.  Look
                          at these fingers.

                          Actually, I wanted to ask you
                          about that.  Maybe I made the
                          wrong decision.

                                              LEWIS
                          Not if surgery's what you want.

                                              CARTER
                          Yeah, I'm just thinking maybe the
                          ER's what I really want.  What do
                          you think Dr. Greene would say if
                        I told him I'd changed my mind?

                          And you're looking kind of sleepy,
                          little one.  Maybe we'd better put
                          you down...

            Lewis wanders off towards the baby's basinette.  On
            Carter, left alone at the window.

          by Wright bringing the morphine.  The trauma doors shut
          as Greene, Haleh and Wright start to work on Joanie.

            Carter stitches a lac on the forehead of DUNLOP (35), a
            Secret Service Agent.  Grey suit, American Flag pin on
          one lapel, Secret Service pin on the other, small ear-
            phone in his ear, the cord running down into his jacket.

                                              DUNLOP
                          Little warm in here, don't you
                          think?

                          You can take your jacket off.

            Dunlop looks at Carter with disdain.

                                              DUNLOP
                          If I can wear it on the golf
                          course, I can certainly wear it
                          here.

            Dunlop sits up tall, straightens his tie.

                                              DUNLOP
                          It was a real bitch out there
                          today.  Knocked some woman right
                          out of her cart on the ninth hole,
                          and then this.

          He points to his forehead.

                          You don't want to stand to the
                          left and behind Bush; he's got a
                          pretty mean slice.  Never had that
                          problem with Carter.

                          That would be President...?

            Dunlop holds his hand up, cuts Carter off.  He's listen-
          ing to something through his earphone; holds his wrist 
          up, speaks into his cuff microphone.

                                              DUNLOP
                          This is Dunlop.  What do you want?

          He listens a beat, then into the mic again.

                                              DUNLOP

                          stay with him, you idiot.

                          People think our job's dangerous;
                          they don't know the half of it.
                          This career's a lot tougher than

                          Actually, I've been having some
                          career problems of my own today.

            Dunlop glances up at him, unimpressed.  As he again
            straightens his tie and Carter resumes stitching...

  60EXT. ROSS'S APARTMENT - NIGHT60

            Diane Leeds pulls her car up to the curb about fifty feet
          from Ross's steps.  She gets out, moves down the side-
            walk, then stops, looking ahead.

          Ross comes out his front door.  He's dressed casually,
            laughing, joking with someone.  A beat and Linda Farrell
            follows him through the door.  She's dressed casually
          now, too, in jeans.  They start down the steps when Ross
            spots Diane.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)          ER - "Motherhood" - Rev. 4/10/9563.

            She's just staring at him, then turns, hurrying back
            towards her car.  Ross runs after her.

                          Diane... Diane, wait.

          He catches up, moves alongside her.

                                              ROSS
                          Diane, please, it's not what you

                          I've already done that, Doug.

          She reaches her car, can't get the key in the lock.

                                              ROSS
                          Diane, stop a minute, please.
                          Don't do this.

          She gets the key in, unlocks the door, opens it.

          Ross freezes a beat, not knowing what to say. Then
            finally comes clean with her.

            moves to Jennifer, gives her a kiss.

                                              GREENE
                          Hi...
                                    (then, suspicious)
                          What's going on here?

                                                                          (CONTINUED)          ER - "Motherhood" - Rev. 4/19/9566.

                          Pre-marital advice.

                                              GREENE
                          Did she tell you how I wanted to
                          elope, but she insisted on Notre
                          Dame?

            Hathaway laughs as Jennifer shoves Greene away. The
            PHONE RINGS.  Hathaway moves down to answer it, leaving
            Greene and Jennifer alone.

                                              GREENE
                          I'm sorry about dinner, Jen.

            There's a stillness now, an awkwardness between them.

                                              JENNIFER
                          You had a patient, Mark.

                                              GREENE
                          She should've gone up hours ago,
                          but there were complications and,
                          uh, the usual...

            Jennifer's not angry, not hostile, but something worse...
              matter-of-fact, resigned.

                                              JENNIFER
                          Yeah, well, that happens.  What're
                          you going to do?

          He looks at her, doesn't have an answer.  Another beat,
          and Jennifer gets up.

                                              JENNIFER
                          It's a long drive.  We should
                          probably go.

          ON Greene as Jennifer moves off.

                                                                        CUT TO:

    64INT.NURSING HOME LIBRARY - NIGHT64

            Benton stands alone by the window.  He's stopped crying
          now; simply stares out, desolate, lost.  JEANIE BOULET 
            enters.  He doesn't turn, doesn't see her.  She watches
          him, then...

                                                                          (CONTINUED)          ER - "Motherhood" - Rev. 5/5/9567.

                          Peter...

          He still doesn't turn, still at sea.  But he smiles.  A
            small, slight half-smile, only to himself.

                                              BENTON
                                    (soft, reflective)
                          All our capabilities.
                                    (then)
                          Said those words how many times?
                          Never actually heard them until
                          today.

            Jeanie moves closer.

                                              JEANIE
                          I'm sorry, Peter.

          He turns now, looks at her.  His emotions right up to the
            surface.  He reins them in, struggling to keep control.

                                              BENTON
                          Jackie took the kids home.  Way
                          past their dinner.  I told her I'd
                          finish up here.

          He can feel himself slipping, tries to dodge it.

                                              BENTON
                          Thought I'd be more prepared for
                          this.

                                              JEANIE
                          No one's prepared.

                                              BENTON
                          They said we can come back
                          tomorrow, get the rest of her
                          things and...

          He breaks off, his emotions welling up.  

                                              BENTON
                        I sat beside her.  Held her hand.
                          Touched her face.  Her skin was so
                          soft... And for just one moment I
                          thought maybe I could stay there
                          forever.

          He looks at Jeanie now, helpless, asking with complete
            innocence...

                                                                          (CONTINUED)          ER - "Motherhood" - Rev. 5/5/9567A/68.

                                              BENTON
                          But I can't do that, can I?  I
                          can't hold onto her.  I can't
                          touch her.
                                    (then)
                        I can't do anything to keep her.

          And he can no longer keep back the tears.  Raw, vulner-
            able, eviscerated.  Finally giving in to his grief.

            Jeanie takes his hand in hers.  Then slowly reaches up,
            touches his face, turning it toward her.

          He looks at her now and they slowly move closer to each
            other.  Into a kiss.  Gentle at first, then more.

            Finally, they break apart and Benton pulls Jeanie's head
            close to his chest, holds onto her.

          And she holds onto him.
                                                                        CUT TO:

65OB HALLWAY - NIGHT65

          It's late and mercifully quiet.  Lewis walks down.

  66CHLOE'S ROOM - NIGHT66

          She moves in.  The lights are off.  Moonlight streams in
            through the blinds.Chloe's sound asleep, the baby
            tucked securely at her side.

            Lewis moves up to the bed, reaches down, pushes Chloe's
          hair back from her eyes.  Then she picks up the baby,
            crosses, sits in a chair by the window.

          The shadows shift gently across her face as she rocks
          this new little life.  And quietly begins to sing.

                                              LEWIS

          On this quiet moment...
