      CLOSE ON Det. Mark Britten, 40ish, handsome, healed, but a 
      weight to his stare. He d rather not remember the beginning.

                                    BRITTEN
                    No. Let s start at right now.

      REVEAL DR. LEE, late 30 s, Asian-American, a cerebral 
      presence in a muted, calming, vaguely Zen environment. 

      He makes a note in his book then looks back at Britten.

                                  DR. LEE
                    Very well. You re back to work?

                                    BRITTEN
                    Yes.                                                                                      2.



      Lee leans on his fingers and looks at him.

                                  DR. LEE
                    And are you okay?

                                    BRITTEN
                          (long beat)
                    Yes.



      It s a modest but homey craftsman bungalow that looks a 
      million miles from murder investigations.

      As Britten steps in, his wife, HANNAH, the woman from the 
      wreck, late 30 s, stunning, warm, looks down from a ladder 
      where she s repainting a wall. She smiles.

                                  HANNAH
                    Perfect. Just in time to help me 
                    clean up. 

      He looks at the dropcloth, brushes, paint.

                                    BRITTEN
                    Maybe it s time to just embrace the 
                    mess.



      Lee is making notes.

                                  DR. LEE
                    Did she start redoing the house 
                    after the accident?

                                    BRITTEN
                    After the funeral.                                                                                      5.


                                  DR. LEE
                          (nodding)
                    That s a common reaction. We all 
                    look for ways to start fresh. Has 
                    she gotten to your son s room?



      Britten opens the room. Typical teenage chaos with an odd 
      sense of being frozen in amber. He stares at it.

                                    BRITTEN (V.O.)
                    No. I m not sure she s even been in 
                    it yet.



      Britten crawls into bed next to Hannah, who s asleep. He 
      gives her a kiss on the cheek, lays back, closes his eyes.

      CLOSE ON HIS EYES as we hear DR. STEPHANIE EVANS.

                                  DR. EVANS (V.O.)
                    And then?

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Britten opens his eyes.

                                    BRITTEN (V.O.)
                    I wake up.

      He looks beside him. His wife isn t there. He looks down at 
      his wrist. There s a GREEN rubber band around it. 

                                  DR. EVANS (V.O.)
                    What s the purpose of the rubber 
                    bands?

                                    BRITTEN (V.O.)
                    Sometimes it gets confusing. They 
                    just help me keep things straight. 



      Britten pulls on his coat as he steps into the hall. 

      Then, just as he passes his SON S DOOR, IT SUDDENLY OPENS and 
      into the hall comes REX BRITTEN, the other passenger from the 
      wreck, 15, tall, good looking, and only moderately awake.

      Britten doesn t seem at all surprised to see him.                                                                                      6.


                                    BRITTEN
                    Morning.

      Rex simply emits a half awake GRUMBLE.



      Britten and Rex eat cereal, watch Sportscenter. Not a lot of 
      chatter, but Britten seems unsure how to change that.

      A car outside HONKS. Rex jumps up, grabs a large TENNIS BAG, 
      stuffs in an extra racquet. 

                                  REX
                    That s Aaron. I gotta go.

                                    BRITTEN
                    What about the uh... the match.

      Rex stops.

                                  REX
                    What about it?

                                    BRITTEN
                    Do you want me there?

      Rex shrugs.

                                  REX
                    Whatever you think.

      He starts out.

                                    BRITTEN
                    Wait.

      Britten stands, walks over, hugs the boy. Rex more endures 
      than reciprocates. Britten doesn t care. He just holds on.



      REVEAL DR. STEPHANIE EVANS, late 20 s, attractive, with all 
      the eagerness of someone new enough to her job to still love 
      it. Her office is modern but not stark. 

      She takes no notes. Instead, she tends to smile and tilt her 
      head as she listens, as if every answer is right.

                                  DR. EVANS 
                    And you said the tennis is new?

                                    BRITTEN
                    Sort of. His mom was very good. 
                    Played in college. She taught him. 
                    He used to play until he discovered 
                    football.                                                                                       7.


                                  DR. EVANS
                    But he s decided to take it up 
                    again. Since the funeral.

      Britten nods.

                                  DR. EVANS (CONT D)
                          (smiling)
                    Great. What else?



      Britten steps into a MURDER SCENE. Two bodies, TOM and IRENE 
      BAKER are laid out, stabbed, blood everywhere.

      Vega walks toward Britten, but then simply nods curtly and 
      WALKS BY AS IF THEY BARELY KNOW EACH OTHER.

      Instead we hear the voice of DET. ISAIAH FREEMAN ( BIRD )

                                  BIRD (O.C.)
                    You see this coffee maker?

      Britten turns to see BIRD, African-American, 50 s, salt and 
      pepper hair and an air of having seen it all, twice. He 
      indicates a complicated coffee maker on the counter.

                                  BIRD (CONT D)
                    My ex always wanted one of these. 
                    Told her she wanted a six hundred 
                    dollar coffee maker she should not 
                    have married a police. 
                          (beat)
                    We eventually agreed on that. 
                          (re: the scene)
                    Tell me what you see, I ll tell you 
                    what you miss.

      Britten surveys the mess.

                                    BRITTEN
                    Husband and wife victims? 

      Bird is playing with the coffee machine, but nods.

                                    BRITTEN (CONT D)
                    Multiple stab wounds. Some signs 
                    that they put up a fight. 

                                  BIRD
                    Also some signs that they lost.

                                    BRITTEN
                    No wallet or purse?

                                  BIRD
                    Gone, along with one of the cars. 
                    BMW.                                                                                      8.


                                    BRITTEN
                    So what, just a home invasion that 
                    turned messy?

      Bird stares at the coffee maker.

                                  BIRD
                    Why I ve avoided success at all 
                    costs. Work your whole life to get 
                    some nice stuff just so someone can 
                    kill you for it. 

      Britten looks around, notices pictures on the walls. Many 
      show a YOUNG GIRL with the couple. Bird picks up on this.

                                  BIRD (CONT D)
                    No sign of the little girl. 
                    Checking with friends, family, 
                    hoping someone tells us she wasn t 
                    home.



      Britten walks into a nexus of Twilight posters and the color 
      pink. Begins to poke around. Bird waits in the doorway.

      Britten opens the closet, stops.

                                    BRITTEN
                    You smell that?

                                  BIRD
                    I ve been nursing a cold since the 
                    Carter administration. 

      Britten leans into the closet, kneels, pokes his head into 
      the corner. SNIFFS. When he comes out-

                                    BRITTEN
                    Girl was here when it happened. 

                                  BIRD
                    How do you know?

                                    BRITTEN
                    Because she hid in the closet and 
                    pissed her pants. Either she ran 
                    when the killer left or he-

                                  BIRD
                    What I get for hoping.

      Bird turns, shouts to the officers in the other room-

                                  BIRD (CONT D)
                    Boys! New deal!

      As Bird starts to give orders, Britten looks back at the 
      closet. OFF his expression -                                                                                       9.


                                  DR. EVANS (V.O.)
                    And this has been happening since 
                    the accident?



      Britten looks at her.

                                    BRITTEN
                    Yes.

                                  DR. EVANS 
                      Fascinating.
                          (reigning it in)
                    Not to be insensitive, it s just... 
                    our brain s main function is to 
                    protect us. Sometimes that means 
                    sensing danger or feeling pain. And 
                    sometimes it actually means 
                    deceiving ourselves. 
                          (to explain)
                    The loss of a loved one is one of 
                    the most emotionally crippling 
                    things we face. We come up with all 
                    sorts of ways to get through it. 
                    Like your son taking up his 
                    mother s sport to maintain some 
                    sense of connection with her. But 
                    your brain... it s created an 
                    entire reality where you haven t 
                    actually lost your wife at all.



      Dr. Lee is in the middle of a similar thought.

                                  DR. LEE 
                    An elaborate and ongoing dream in 
                    which you haven t lost your son, 
                    relieving you of the obligation of 
                    dealing with his death. I m not 
                    sure I ve ever seen a coping 
                    mechanism quite like it.

      Britten looks at him. A beat.

                                    BRITTEN
                    How do you know it s a dream?

                                  DR. LEE
                    I m sorry?

                                    BRITTEN
                    How do you know that the world 
                    where my wife died and my son lived 
                    is my dream? Maybe that s reality, 
                    and this world, where my wife lived 
                    and my son died, is the dream.                                                                                    10.



      Dr. Evans looks genuinely surprised.

                                  DR. EVANS
                    Wait. You mean you can t tell them 
                    apart?

      Britten shakes his head. She s practically giddy.

                                  DR. EVANS (CONT D)
                      Incredible.



      Lee looks incredulous.

                                  DR. LEE
                    So you re saying you re not 
                    confident whether you re asleep or 
                    awake at this very moment?

      Britten looks at the rubber band on his arm. It s BLUE.

                                    BRITTEN
                      Everything feels just as real in 
                    one world as it does in the other. 
                    I never look down and discover I m 
                    naked, or late for a test. Never 
                    suddenly start to fly. Whether I m 
                    with my wife or my son, everything 
                    is completely normal. Then I close 
                    my eyes, open them, and the other 
                    one is waiting.

      A long beat. Dr. Lee makes a note.

                                  DR. LEE
                    Well, I can assure you, Detective 
                    Britten, this is not a dream.

      Britten can t help but smile.

                                  DR. LEE (CONT D)
                    What?

                                    BRITTEN
                    That s exactly what the other

                                        ACT ONE



      Britten and Vega are scanning through the security camera 
      footage. As a cab rolls into frame-

                                    BRITTEN
                    Whoa. Right there.

      They let it play. 

                                  VEGA
                    Could hardly ask for a better 
                    angle.

      A SKINNY MAN IN A COWBOY HAT opens the rear door, hands a 
      twenty to the driver, then gets out.

      He takes a step and then turns and FIRES THREE SHOTS through 
      the window, killing the driver.

      Then he looks DIRECTLY AT THE CAMERA, and TIPS HIS HAT before 
      running away. Vega and Britten look at each other, surprised.

                                  VEGA (CONT D)
                    Wow. Part murder, part performance 
                    piece. 

      Britten rewinds, watches the shooting again, then the polite 
      hat tip. The killer s hat is low, his sunglasses large.

                                    BRITTEN
                    Disguise doesn t give us a lot to 
                    go on. Let s pull a still and put 
                    it out to all the local-

      Suddenly an OFFICER anxiously sticks his head in.

                                    OFFICER
                      Detectives? We ve got another one.

                                    BRITTEN
                    Another what?

                                    OFFICER
                    Dead cabbie.

      OFF Britten and Vega exchanging a look-



      Britten, Vega, and a MALL SECURITY OFFICER are gathered 
      around the small bank of monitors. They focus on one as-                                                                                    13.


      A cab pulls up. The door opens. AN OVERWEIGHT MAN IN A 
      TRUCKER HAT starts to get out, and as he does, fires three 
      shots through the backseat.

      The cab lurches forward. As people panic, the overweight man 
      looks right at the camera, DOFFS HIS CAP, and then walks on.

      Britten freezes the tape on the suspect, the face disguised 
      behind the beard and coke bottle glasses, almost useless.

                                    BRITTEN
                    I ll take this back to the lab, see 
                    if they can enhance it.

                                  VEGA
                    What should I do?

                                    BRITTEN
                    Didn t Bird say something about a 
                    hundred witnesses to interview?

      OFF Vega s fading expression-



      Dr. Lee looks up from his notes.

                                  DR. LEE 
                    What does your wife say about your 
                      condition?

                                    BRITTEN
                          (beat)
                    We don t talk about it. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Britten is talking while Hannah prepares dinner.

                                    BRITTEN (V.O.) 
                    At first I told her everything. 
                    That he d given up football and 
                    gone back to tennis. About the girl 
                    he was getting calls from.

      Suddenly Hannah just bursts into tears. 

                                    BRITTEN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    But it s not the same for her. To 
                    her he s not still alive, it s just 
                    some dream I keep having. And 
                    hearing about it isn t comforting, 
                    it s... torture.                                                                                    14.



      Britten looks at Lee.

                                    BRITTEN
                      I actually wasn t looking to come 
                    back to work. She sort of forced my 
                    hand. 

                                  DR. LEE
                    She wanted you to get back to a 
                    routine?

                                    BRITTEN
                    No. She wanted to break all our 
                    routines. She wanted to move. Like 
                    cross the country and start over. 
                    She says it s hard to live with 
                    that empty room upstairs. My best 
                    argument for staying was that the 
                    seniority and benefits I d worked 
                    for wouldn t follow us. 

                                  DR. LEE
                    But you don t really care about 
                    those things? You just wanted to 
                    remain where you are.

                                    BRITTEN
                    For me, the room upstairs isn t 
                    empty.

      Lee notes this.

                                  LEE
                      Detective, I m going to be frank. 
                    For you to process what s happened, 
                    heal, and move on, it s imperative 
                    that you acknowledge what s real 
                    and what s fantasy. We can talk 
                    about your dreams, but we have to 
                    accept them as just that, dreams. 
                    Do you understand?

      Britten eventually nods.

                                  LEE (CONT D)
                    Let s talk about your partners. Why 
                    do you think they re different 
                    between your dream and reality?

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Britten and Vega interview a witness. Vega smiles broadly as 
      Britten makes notes.                                                                                    15.


                                    BRITTEN (V.O.)
                    I don t know. I never worked with a 
                    partner before the accident. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Britten and Bird are looking over bloody crime scene photos, 
      pointing out various items, making notes.

                                    BRITTEN (V.O.)
                    They told me they wanted me with 
                    someone for while and... I don t 
                    know, I got one in one world and 
                    the other in the other.



      Dr. Evans is nodding adamantly.

                                  DR. EVANS
                    But you said that they don t like 
                    each other, this Bird and Vega?

                                    BRITTEN
                    Vega s just new. Still thinks we 
                    fix things. Bird knows better.

                                  DR. EVANS
                    It makes perfect sense. Your brain 
                    doesn t want you to know which 
                    world is real and which isn t. It 
                    would defeat the purpose of the 
                    coping mechanism. If you had the 
                    same partner, you might invent 
                    details about them in your dream 
                    that were disproved in reality and 
                    you d suddenly know which was 
                    which. This way, you re free to 
                    create a story for each of them, 
                    and their animosity helps keep them 
                    from crossing paths and forcing you 
                    to reconcile what you ve imagined 
                    with the truth. It s the same 
                    reason you ve given yourself 
                    different therapists.



      Dr. Lee closes his notebook.

                                  DR. LEE
                    It s these little details and 
                      differences we should focus on.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    16.



      Britten and Vega step out of the interview room, call their 
      next witness in. As they wait Britten looks across the 
      department at BIRD, NOSE IN A BOOK AT HIS DESK, oblivious.

                                    BRITTEN (V.O.)
                    Why?

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Britten and Bird address other officers as papers are passed.

                                    BRITTEN
                    This wasn t random. He knew who he 
                    was after, and he waited for her, 
                    which means he had to have come 
                    into contact with her before the 
                    night of the murders. These are all 
                    the registered sex offenders whose 
                    homes or work might have put them 
                    in contact with our missing girl. 
                    There s a lot here so we re going 
                    to divide them up for the first 
                    sweep. If you get someone you can t 
                      immediately eliminate, let Bird or 
                    myself know and we ll get into them 
                      personally.  

      Everyone breaks up, begins to head out. Bird starts to go, 
      looks back to see Britten standing, staring at his watch.

                                  BIRD
                    You coming?

      Britten hesitates. Then-

                                    BRITTEN
                    I ve got something I ve got to do.

                                  BIRD
                    Now?

      Britten thinks about that. Wavers. Then-

                                    BRITTEN
                    Just take the first couple. I only 
                    need an hour or two.

                                  BIRD
                    For what?

      As Britten starts to go -

                                    BRITTEN 
                    I told someone I d be somewhere.

      Bird, annoyed and confused, watches him leave.



      Britten, Rex, and Tara sit at a table in the largely deserted 
      bar area. Each has a soda, some picked at fries between them.                                                                                    21.


      Rex is recovered, but the conversation is mostly two way with 
      Britten spectating.

                                  TARA
                    No way. I watch total garbage TV 
                    and I don t even watch that.

                                  REX
                    Come on. It s about models.

                                  TARA
                    I think that holds a different 
                    appeal for a 15 year old boy than 
                    it does for me.

      Rex smiles, which Britten sort of marvels at. Tara seems to 
      notice Britten on the outside looking in.

                                  TARA (CONT D)
                    What about you, Mark? You have a

                    Nope. That s mine.

                    Um...

      He looks at Rex who can already read his mind.

                                  REX
                    You have to go.

      Britten dies a little at his son s words. Then-

                                    BRITTEN
                          (into phone)
                    I ve gotta get Rex home and I ll be 
                    right there.

      As he hangs up-

                                  TARA
                    I can take him if you want.

                                  REX
                    Yeah. I ll get a ride with Tara.

      It s clearly not about convenience, it s what Rex wants.

                                    BRITTEN
                    Uh. Yeah. Okay. I ll, um, I ll see 
                    you in a bit then.

      Rex just nods. Britten doesn t know what else to do. He heads 
      for the door, disappointed with how that went.

      He almost gets there when Rex jogs up behind him.

                                  REX
                    Dad?

      Britten turns. A beat as Rex seems unsure what to say.

                                  REX (CONT D)
                    Um... I m glad you came today.

                                    BRITTEN
                    Me too.

      A beat. REX HUGS HIM. The look on Britten s face says the 
      gesture means everything to him. They break. A long beat.

                                    BRITTEN (CONT D)
                    Your idea or Tara s?

      Rex smiles. His dad s not stupid.

                                  REX
                    She s good at this kind of stuff.                                                                                    23.


                                    BRITTEN
                          (smiles)
                    I won t be late. Promise.

      As Rex goes, Britten catches Tara s eye. He mouths  thanks . 
      She smiles, nods.



      Britten works the phones. Photos of license plates surround 
      him as well as a drawing on his wall with the space 589, 590, 
      and 611, right behind 590, all circled.

                                    BRITTEN
                    Right. I m calling about a car you 
                    left parked at the Waverly Long 
                    Term Parking Lot. Yes.

                                                                SERIES OF SHOTS:

      We see him crossing license plates off a list.                                                                                    25.


      We see his eyes glazing over as he struggles to stay awake.

      We see him sipping a cup of coffee.

      Bird steps over.

                                  BIRD
                    Anything?

                                    BRITTEN
                          (shakes his head)
                    You?

                                  BIRD
                    Nope. Apparently people don t 
                    memorize all the nearby cars when 
                    they park.

      Britten looks at his watch.

                                    BRITTEN
                    Dammit. It s almost two. I told him 
                      I wouldn t do this.

      As Britten starts to gather his things-

                                  BIRD
                    Your boy. How s he... handling 
                    things?

                                    BRITTEN
                          (shrugs)
                    I don t know. I can read you better 
                    than him. But then I ve probably 
                    spent more time in the department 
                    than at home over the last fifteen 
                    years. 

                                  BIRD
                      Birthdays, anniversaries, 
                      graduations. You name it, I ve 
                    missed it. Used to feel bad about 
                    but... what we see, people stabbed 
                    to death, kids taken... it s toxic 
                    waste. Work in it, you end up 
                      radioactive. So for every thing 
                    I ve missed, there re ten I ruined 
                    because I came home with dead 
                    people on my mind. Job s not just 
                    about catching bad guys. It s about 
                    making sure the people you love 
                    don t see just how ugly it really 
                    is out there.     
                          (beat)
                    Sometimes staying at your desk 
                    doesn t mean you re neglecting 
                    anyone. It just means you don t 
                    want them to see what s on it. 

      Bird pats the bloody crime scene photos, walks off.                                                                                     26.



      Britten drives, Bird s words ringing in his ears. The hand on 
      the wheel has a GREEN rubber band around the wrist.

                                                                    MATCH CUT TO:



      Britten s hand on the wheel, but now with a BLUE rubber band. 

      He fights the morning traffic as he heads for the station.

      As he sits at a light, a YELLOW CAB pulls up beside him. He 
      looks over as the light changes.

      Britten starts his turn into the station, then notices the 
      cab pulling to a stop right in front. He pauses mid turn. 

      A BLONDE WOMAN IN A BLACK DRESS AND WIDE HAT gets out. She 
      puts her purse on the roof, appears to dig for her wallet.

      Britten is about to dismiss it when BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, the 
      woman fires a gun from inside her purse right through the 
      roof of the cab and into the driver.

      As people SCREAM and start to run, the woman looks up at the 
      station and TIPS HER HAT.

      Britten jams on the accelerator and TEARS OUT, barreling over 
      the sidewalk towards the cab.

      The Woman bolts. As Britten dodges pedestrians, the woman 
      races into an alleyway between the station and the large 
      office building next door.

      When Britten s way is blocked, he abandons the car and leaps 
      out only to find OFFICERS sprinting towards him, guns drawn.

                                    OFFICER
                    FREEZE!

      Britten slows up, reaches into his pocket.

                                    OFFICER (CONT D)
                    DON T!

      Britten stops, slowly draws his badge, keeps his tone even.

                                    BRITTEN
                    Detective Britten. I m just getting 
                    my badge.

      The officer holds his bead as Britten produces his badge. A 
      beat, then, satisfied, they take off towards the alley.                                                                                    27.



      Business people move about through the lobby, oblivious to 
      the scene outside. As Britten eyes them-

                                    OFFICER
                      Detective!

      Britten turns to see the Officer standing next to a trashcan 
      in an alcove. Hanging out is a bit of BLACK FABRIC.

      Britten walks over to the can, pulls the lid off. Inside is 
      the black dress, hat, and a long blonde wig.

      Britten looks up, making eye contact with various people 
      moving in and out of the lobby. The suspect could be anyone.

                                    OFFICER (CONT D)
                    What are we looking for?

      Britten looks back at the disguise in the trash.

                                    BRITTEN
                    I wish I knew.

                                        ACT III



      Britten and Vega sit at a monitor when a TECH approaches, 
      holding a plastic bag with a single RED HAIR in it.

                                  TECH
                    Looks like your suspect left 
                    something behind this time.

      Britten takes the bag, eyes it.

                                  TECH (CONT D)
                    Pulled it out of the wig you found 
                    in the trash. We ll run the DNA, 
                    but the database is small.

                                  TECH (CONT D)
                    Unless he s been in serious trouble 
                    before we probably won t get a hit.

                                  VEGA
                    Hey, we know we re looking for a 
                    red head. That s something, right?

                                    BRITTEN
                    Thanks.

      Britten hands back the bag. Vega turns to the monitor.

                                  VEGA
                    First up, 611 Waverly.
                          (starting the tape)
                    Okay, carrot top. Where are you?

      The address hits Britten like a brick.

                                    BRITTEN
                    What did you say?

                                  VEGA
                    What?

                                    BRITTEN
                    611 Waverly?

                                                                          FLASH TO:

      WE SEE the parking space, 611 written at the bottom.

                                  VEGA (V.O.)
                    The restaurant where the cabbie got 
                    killed. That s the address.

      Britten is struggling to process this.

                                    BRITTEN
                    Did I know that?

                                  VEGA
                    It s been on the paperwork. Why?

                                    BRITTEN
                      There s... a Waverly Parking Lot by 
                    the airport.

                                  VEGA
                    What that s have to do with this?

      Britten s not sure.

                                    BRITTEN
                    Play the tape.                                                                                    30.



      Dr. Lee takes a moment then-

                                  DR. LEE
                    I d say it s entirely reasonable, 
                    even expected that these sorts of 
                    details would begin to cross over.

      He closes his notes, looks at Britten.

                                  DR. LEE (CONT D)
                    Sleep not only recharges us, but 
                    during the REM cycles it s where we 
                    actually process and store the 
                    day s information. Normally this 
                    all goes unseen or vaguely 
                      remembered as random dreams, but 
                    because you ve constructed an 
                    entire reality out of your sleep, 
                    this processing is simply going to 
                    become folded in, meaning the 
                    things you re wrestling with in 
                    real life are likely to manifest 
                      themselves in your dream.

                                    BRITTEN
                    But I knew about the Waverly 
                    parking lot and space 611 before I 
                    knew the address of the first cab 
                    murder. How could I have dreamed it 
                    before I knew it?

                                  DR. LEE
                    You didn t. You said yourself it 
                    was on the paperwork. 

                                                                          FLASH TO:

      WE SEE the address on the side of the building. 611

                    You were at the location. Even if 
                    you didn t consciously note it, 
                    your brain did, and apparently it 
                    found it important enough to put 
                    the details-

                                                                          FLASH TO:

                    Waverly and 611-

      TIGHT ON the 611 in the parking space.                                                                                    31.

      Britten isn t so sure.

                                    BRITTEN
                    Or I really saw it first in the 
                    parking lot and the dream I m in 
                    now is repeating it to tell me that 
                    it s important over there for some 
                    reason.

      Dr. Lee takes a beat.

                                  DR. LEE
                    Detective Britten, as I ve said, 
                    there s no therapeutic value in 
                    allowing you to pretend that your 
                    realities are interchangeable. 
                    There is no kidnapped child. There 
                    is no car in a parking lot. And... 
                    sadly, but crucially, there is no 
                    world in which your son has 
                    survived the accident.

                                    BRITTEN
                    What makes you so sure?

                                  DR. LEE
                    That this is reality? Well, for 
                    starters I know I m real. I know I 
                    talked to my wife twenty minutes 
                    before you came in. I know what I 
                    ate for breakfast. I know where I m 
                    going this evening.

                                    BRITTEN
                    I could just be inventing all those 
                    details as part of my dream.

                                  DR. LEE
                    Then let s try looking at it from 
                    the perspective of causality. Which 
                    murder happened first?

                                    BRITTEN
                    Well... the cab driver.

                                  DR. LEE
                    So you begin a case in reality, and 
                    then suddenly you re working a case 
                    in your dream.

                                  DR. LEE (CONT'D)
                    As one story unfolds the other 
                    twists and turns in response as you 
                    process the days  events and 
                    sometimes as you key on a detail it 
                    calls specific attention to itself 
                    in your imagination. The 
                      consequence of returning to work in 
                    your condition is that in addition 
                    to trying to keep your son alive, 
                    you re using your dreams to try to 
                    solve your cases.

                                    BRITTEN
                    But-

                                  DR. LEE
                    We should also examine the type of 
                    case you re working in your dream. 
                    A missing child. The very issue 
                    you re struggling to come to terms 
                    with. So your subconscious turns it 
                    into a case you have to solve. 
                          (beat)
                      I understand the pain you feel 
                      Detective. But once you accept that 
                    this is reality, you ll release 
                    your son from your dreams, and you 
                    can begin the crucial process of 
                    mourning him and ending that pain.

      A beat.

                                    BRITTEN
                    So as soon as I accept that he s 
                    dead, he ll stop showing up?

                                  DR. LEE
                    I believe that s very likely.

      Britten absorbs that thought.



      Britten and Hannah, well-dressed, sit among others equally 
      so, trying to be a couple instead of grieving parents.

                                    BRITTEN
                    You already applied?

                                  HANNAH
                    What? You think I m too old?

                                    BRITTEN
                    I m sure you can still do keg 
                    stands with the best of them. I 
                    just... what about your work?

                                  HANNAH
                    I quit.                                                                                    33.


      Britten senses she s trying to draw him into something. He 
      resists.

                                    BRITTEN
                    I see. 
                          (beat)
                    Where are these schools at?

                                  HANNAH
                    One s in the city. One s in Oregon.

                                    BRITTEN
                    Oregon.

                                  HANNAH
                    It s a really great program.

                                    BRITTEN
                    I thought we talked about this.

                                  HANNAH
                    Then let s see if I get in before 
                    we talk about it again.

      This isn t how he wants the night to go. A long beat. He 
      tries to shift gears.

                                    BRITTEN
                    You... you remember that time we 
                    were at that restaurant like this 
                    in New York and you pretended to be 
                    a food critic? Got us that amazing 
                    table, huge meal, all for free.

                                  HANNAH
                    What made you think of that?

                                    BRITTEN
                    I don t know. Maybe I was thinking 
                    about how persuasive you can be.

                                  HANNAH
                          (smiling)
                    I must have been. Who believes a 23 
                    year old who orders fries with her 
                    lobster is a critic?

      Britten LAUGHS. But Hanah s smile is muted. Long beat.

                                  HANNAH (CONT D)
                    You know they say there s a point 
                    in every relationship where you 
                    stop talking about what you re 
                    doing and only talk about what you 
                    did.

      She sees this suck the life out of him.

                                  HANNAH (CONT D)
                    I m sorry. I don t know what s 
                    wrong with me. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    34.

                                  HANNAH (CONT D)
                    I mean, we can say it s time. Say 
                    we need to get dressed, go out like 
                    normal people again, have a good 
                    time, but... I wonder if there s 
                    ever a point where having a good 
                    time isn t going to feel wrong.

      She looks down.

                                  HANNAH (CONT D)
                    I guess saying it out loud doesn t 
                    really help the cause.

                                    BRITTEN
                    It s okay. I know what you mean.

      A beat.

                                    BRITTEN (CONT D)
                    How s the house coming?

                                  HANNAH
                    Just one room to go.

      He nods. They both know which one that is. As he thinks on it 
      his words just slip out. 

                                    BRITTEN
                    I saw him play a match the other 
                    day.

      She looks confused, slightly troubled.

                                  HANNAH
                    Who?

      He catches himself.

                                    BRITTEN
                    My new partner- his son, he s on 
                    the tennis team. He invited me out.

                                  HANNAH
                    Oh.

      Britten can t help it. He smiles with pride.

                                    BRITTEN
                    He was amazing. Twenty five aces in 
                    the final. Reminded me of you.

                                  HANNAH
                    Me?

                                    BRITTEN
                    Yeah. Just the way he crushed the 
                    ball. The way he poured himself 
                    into it. It... was almost like I 
                    was watching you.                                                                                    35.


      She s sees right though him, knows he s talking about Rex. 
      She puts down her napkin, stands.

                                  HANNAH
                    Dammit, Mark. 

      She walks away.



      Hannah s on the bed, looking down. He approaches from behind, 
      puts his hands on her shoulders, apologetic.

                                  MARK
                    I m sorry.

      She looks back at him.

                                  HANNAH
                    You can t do that to me.

                                  MARK
                          (nodding, soft)
                    I know.

      A beat and then they kiss. It s gentle, careful, like they re 
      not sure they re ready for all this. As they continue-

                                                                            CUT TO:



      We see paint cans and brushes stacked in the corner, the wall 
      behind them hidden under a perfect new coat of paint.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Britten and Hannah move under the sheets, cautious and 
      considered.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      We stare at Rex s closed door.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    36.



      We see the couple moving faster, faster.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      The teenage chaos. Clothes on the floor, untouched. 

      A couple of trophies on a shelf. A picture of the whole 
      family, Rex between Hannah and Britten.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      The after: Britten spoons Hannah from behind. She begins to 
      play with the BLUE rubber band on his wrist.

      Long SILENCE. Then-

                                  HANNAH
                    I... think that we should get 
                    pregnant.

      She can sense his reaction. Jumping ahead of it-

                                  HANNAH (CONT D)
                    I know it s fast. And you can say 
                    whatever you want about working 
                    through issues and all of that, but 
                    this is not about replacing him. I 
                    just know that I m going to want 
                    another one and I don t want and be 
                    a hundred when he s in high school. 
                    So...

      Britten sits on this, unsure what to say.

                                    BRITTEN
                    How do you know it would be a boy?

                                  HANNAH
                    What?

                                    BRITTEN
                    You said when  he s in high 
                    school. 

                                  HANNAH
                    Oh.
                          (beat)
                    I don t.

      Neither seems sure what to say next. She turns to him.                                                                                    37.


                                  HANNAH (CONT D)
                    What do you think?

                                    BRITTEN
                    I m not sure I know what to think.

      She accepts that. A beat.

                                  HANNAH
                    How s it going with the 
                      psychiatrist?

                                                                            CUT TO:



      The couple sleeps beside one another in the darkness.

                    He s trying to get me to understand 
                    some things.

      CLOSE ON Britten as he lays in the darkness, eyes closed.

                                  HANNAH (V.O.)
                    Is it helping?



      Britten opens his eyes. Rex is standing over him.

                                  REX 
                    Dad?

                    I m not sure I want it to.

                                        ACT IV



      Dr. Evans seems more incensed than we ve seen her.

                                  DR. EVANS
                    That s ridiculous. Trying to force 
                    you into some revelation is not his 
                    job. The coping mechanism is there 
                    for a reason, to let you deal with 
                    this when you re ready.

                                    BRITTEN
                    But he s right. Things seem to 
                    start there and get repeated here. 
                    I had the cab driver case, and then 
                    suddenly I had this one.

                                  DR. EVANS
                    You knew you were coming back to 
                    work. You could have dreamed up a 
                    case in anticipation as your mind 
                    had already begun to focus on what 
                    you d be up against. Notice that 
                    the cab driver murders didn t 
                    become an ongoing SERIES of murders 
                    until AFTER you were faced with an 
                    ongoing situation where a child was 
                    missing.

      Britten shakes his head.

                                    BRITTEN
                    I can t even keep this straight. 

                                  DR. EVANS
                    You don t need to. At this point, 
                    that s not where I think our focus 
                    should lie.

                                    BRITTEN
                    That s exactly what Dr. Lee would 
                    expect you to say. He d tell me 
                    that the only reason you re 
                    agreeing with me is because you ARE 
                    me, just my imagination trying to 
                    hold onto the idea that this dream 
                    could be real.

      Dr. Evans takes a beat.

                                  DR. EVANS
                    Okay.

      She goes to her computer. Types something in, hits print. As 
      pages start to come out of her printer, she grabs a small 
      stack and brings them over, hands them to Britten.

                                  DR. EVANS (CONT D)
                    Here.                                                                                    39.


      He looks at the pages. Before he can ask-

                                  DR. EVANS (CONT D)
                    Turn to any page. Just pick one.

      He hesitates, then flips through. He stops on the third page.

                                  DR. EVANS (CONT D)
                    Now. Pick a spot somewhere about 
                    half way down and start reading. 
                    Out loud.

                                    BRITTEN
                    What-

                                  DR. EVANS
                    Read.

      He looks at the page. Begins.

                                    BRITTEN
                          (reading)

                          (breaks)
                    What the hell are we doing?

      She looks at him.

                                  DR. EVANS
                    Have you memorized the entire 
                      constitution?

                                    BRITTEN
                          (baffled)
                    No.

                                  DR. EVANS
                    Then if this is a dream, if your 
                    son has really died instead of your 
                    wife and you re just making all 
                    this up, explain to me how you 
                    turned to a random page and were 
                    able to read it back, word for 
                    word.

      Britten is dumbstruck. 

                                    BRITTEN
                    I... I don t know.

                                  DR. EVANS
                    Tell Dr. Lee that Dr. Evans says 
                    it s not as simple as he made it 
                    sound. 

      The more he thinks about it, the more bothered he becomes.                                                                                    40.


                                    BRITTEN
                    Why would you do that?

                                  DR. EVANS
                    What do you mean? I just thought if 
                    I could counter balance the-

                                    BRITTEN
                    You just said we shouldn t be 
                    trying to force any sort of... 
                      realization and then, I mean, how 
                    could I possibly have done that 
                    unless-

      Britten s phone rings.

                                    BRITTEN (CONT D)
                    Britten.

                                  BIRD
                          (filter)
                    We got a suspect.  

                                    BRITTEN
                    On my way.

      He hangs up. Stands.

                                  DR. EVANS
                    Detective Britten, please-

                                    BRITTEN
                    Just... don t say anything else. 

      OFF her look as he walks out - 



      Bird meets Britten at the door. As they walk down the hallway-

                                  BIRD
                    Vega picked him up.

                                    BRITTEN
                    Vega?

                                  BIRD
                    Yeah, you know him, young guy, 
                    ready to commit a murder and solve 
                    it just to get a promotion. This 
                    just might be his ticket.
                          (looks at a sheet)
                      Registered sex offender with two 
                    priors, works at the car wash. 
                    Records show the family was there 
                    eleven times in the last six 
                    months. Found his prints in the 
                    recovered car.                                                                                    41.


                                    BRITTEN
                    You just said he worked at the car 
                    wash.

                                  BIRD
                    Also quite a child porn collection 
                    on his computer-

                                    BRITTEN
                    Still-

                                  BIRD
                    AND pictures of various kids from 
                    the neighborhood taken in parks, on 
                    the street, at the car wash. 
                          (beat)
                    Want to guess who one of the stars 
                    of that show is?

      He hands Britten photos of the missing girl.

                                  BIRD (CONT D)
                    He s got no alibi for the night of 
                    the murders or for the period of 
                    time when the car would have been 
                    left at the parking lot. DA says 
                    she s probably got enough to 
                    indict.

                                    BRITTEN
                    We find his car?

                                  BIRD
                    Doesn t have one. Rides the bus. 
                    There s a stop two blocks from 
                    where the first car was stolen. 
                    Figure he takes the family BMW back 
                    to the parking lot and steals 
                    another one we re not looking for. 
                    For all we know that car and the 
                    girl are at the bottom of a lake.

      They arrive at the interrogation room.

                                  BIRD (CONT D)
                    If she is still alive, the only way 
                    we re going to find her is to get 
                    him to tell us where, so let s keep 
                    him heading in that direction.

      Britten nods, stops just before they go in.

                                    BRITTEN
                    Does he have red hair?

                                  BIRD
                          (thrown)
                    Red hair? No. Why?

      Britten isn t even sure himself.                                                                                    42.


                                    BRITTEN
                    I don t know.



      Bird and Britten enter to find Vega with the SUSPECT 
      (TAYLOR), 40 s diminutive, creepy, and genuinely frightened.

      Vega steps over to them.

                                  VEGA
                          (sotto)
                    I think with just a little more 
                    time, Detectives-

                                  BIRD
                    We ve got it, thanks.

      Vega grudgingly steps aside. Bird takes a seat. Britten seems 
      caught looking at Vega, then back at the suspect s hair.

                                  BIRD (CONT D)
                    Mr. Taylor. Detective Freeman. This 
                    is Detective Britten. I m going to 
                    be frank, and this is going to be 
                    fast. You are in a significant 
                    mess. The pornographic material by 
                    itself was already a violation of 
                    your parole. We also have your 
                    prints in the victims  car, as well 
                    as your own private photos of the 
                    missing girl. It s a double murder 
                    with or without her, so you re not 
                    saving yourself from anything by 
                    hiding her. At this point, her 
                    location is the ONLY, and I repeat, 
                    ONLY thing you can use to help 
                    yourself. We find her alive, maybe 
                    the rest of your life gets a little 
                    longer. So let s talk about where 
                    you went after you left the BMW at 
                    the Waverly parking lot.

                                  TAYLOR
                          (exasperated, terrified)
                    Please. I already told the officer 
                    I don t know what you re talking 
                    about.

      Britten takes a seat next to Bird. They both sound 
        sympathetic.

                                    BRITTEN
                    She was bleeding. Was she hard to 
                    control? Was she fighting you?

                                  BIRD
                    You needed to go someplace private, 
                    right? Some place you could be 
                    alone? Did you drive out of the 
                    city? Where did you go?                                                                                    43.


      Taylor starts to CRY.

                                  TAYLOR
                    I told you. I was at home.

                                  VEGA
                    Watching TV by yourself is not an 
                    alibi.

      Taylor just puts his head down, CRYING. Vega makes a 
      dismissive gesture. Britten finds himself staring at the top 
      of the guys head. At his thinning BROWN hair. 

                                                                          FLASH TO:

      WE SEE the ziplock bag with the single red hair from the 
      other case.

                                                                          BACK TO:



      Britten can t shake a sense of unease. A beat.

                                    BRITTEN
                    What were you watching?

      Taylor looks up.

                                    BRITTEN (CONT D)
                    Monday night, when the murders 
                    occurred, what were you watching?

      Taylor reigns in his tears, thinks.

                                  TAYLOR
                      I don t... uh, the football game?

      Britten looks at the reports on the desk.

                                    BRITTEN
                    9 pm. That would have been about 
                    the third quarter. You remember the 
                    third quarter?

                                  TAYLOR
                    I... maybe. Why?

                                  BIRD
                    Detective Britten-

                                    BRITTEN
                    Who was winning?

                                  TAYLOR
                    The... the Steelers. They d just 
                    scored.                                                                                    44.


                                  VEGA
                    Which you could have learned 
                    watching Sportscenter. 

                                    BRITTEN
                    You remember anything the 
                      commentators said? Anything 
                    specific?

      Bird stands.

                                  BIRD
                      Detective. Outside.

      Britten isn t going anywhere.

                                  TAYLOR
                    I don t know. Like what?

                                    BRITTEN
                    You tell me. 

                                  TAYLOR
                    I... something about, the defense?
                          (remembering)
                    About the defense being so banged 
                    up, and one of the commentators 
                    said they were missing so many 
                    people they d asked him to play. 
                    Something like that.
                          (beat)
                    Is that right?

                                    BRITTEN
                    I don t know. I wasn t watching. 

      He gets up, walks out, Bird and Vega angrily following.



      As soon as the door closes Vega explodes.

                                  VEGA
                    What the hell are you doing?

                                    BRITTEN
                    He has an alibi.

                                  VEGA
                    It s football! He could have heard 
                    about the game anywhere.

                                    BRITTEN
                    I didn t ask about the game, I 
                    asked about the commentary. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    45.

                                    BRITTEN (CONT'D)
                    He d have needed to have watched 
                    the game or to have seen a tape to 
                    memorize commentary, and since he 
                    didn t think he had an alibi to 
                    begin with I doubt he watched the 
                    game on tape to create one. 

      Vega wants to say something but thinks better of it.

                                    BRITTEN (CONT D)
                    Just get us a copy of the 
                      broadcast, officer. If he s lying 
                    we hammer him, but I don t think he 
                    is. He was home when that girl was 
                    taken.

      Vega stalks off. Bird looks at Britten evenly.

                                    BRITTEN (CONT D)
                    This isn t about finishing our 
                    homework. It s about finding the 
                    girl. If he s not the guy, it 
                    doesn t help us.



      Britten and Bird playback a tape of Monday Night Football.

                                  JON GRUDEN
                          (on monitor)
                    They ve got so many people injured 
                    I think I m in their dime package.

      Bird looks at Britten, stops the tape. SILENCE.

                                  BIRD
                    Why d you ask if he had red hair?

                                    BRITTEN
                    I m honestly not sure.

                                  BIRD
                    Well, not sure, you just tanked our 
                    only suspect and most of our good 
                    leads, so what do we do now?

                                    BRITTEN
                    It s got something to do with the 
                    Waverly lot.

                                  BIRD
                    What makes you say that?

                                    BRITTEN
                    I ve been seeing it in my sleep.


                                    END OF ACT IV                                                                                    46.


                                        ACT V



      Britten wakes up alone. He looks at his wrist. He s wearing 
      the BLUE rubber band, but there s no sign of his wife. He s 
      immediately troubled.

                                    BRITTEN
                    Hannah?

      Nothing.



      He walks into the living room. It s repainted, but the paint 
      cans are gone. He grabs his phone, dials.

                                  HANNAH
                          (voicemail recording)
                    Hi, this is Hannah. Leave a 
                    message.

      As he walks through the house-

                                    BRITTEN
                    Um, it s me. I m just wondering 
                    where you are. I feel... I m not 
                    sure what s going on and it would 
                    just really help me out if I could 
                    hear your voice.

      He hangs up. Then-

                                    BRITTEN (CONT D)
                    Hannah! HANNAH!

      SILENCE.



      Britten steps in. It s just as it always is on this side, an 
      untouched mess, no one here.

                                    BRITTEN
                    REX!

      But this is clearly not the room of the living Rex. He takes 
      a seat on the bed. 

                                    BRITTEN (CONT D)
                    No. She can t be gone. I m... this 
                    is... I m imagining this. 

      He SLAPS himself.                                                                                    47.


                                    BRITTEN (CONT D)
                    Wake up! 

      Again. HARDER.

                                    BRITTEN (CONT D)
                    Wake UP!

      He spots a multi-tool on his sons desk. He grabs it, flips 
      out the knife.

      A beat, then he presses the knife into his palm until it 
      draws blood. He GASPS at the pain as he opens a wound.

                                    BRITTEN (CONT D)
                    Come on!

      Then-

                                  HANNAH
                    Mark?

      He turns. There she is. In the doorway. Almost too quickly.

                                  HANNAH (CONT D)
                    What are you doing in here?

      She notices the blood.

                                  HANNAH (CONT D)
                    Oh my God, what happened?

      He drops the knife, goes to her, throws his arms around her, 
      his hand bleeding all over her back.

                                    BRITTEN
                    You re still here! Thank God.

                                  HANNAH
                    Mark, what s going on?

                                    BRITTEN
                          (emotional)
                    I don t know. I don t know. I m so 
                    confused. I just... I was calling 
                    you. How did you not hear me 
                    calling if now you re... I thought 
                    I was losing you.

      She pulls back, looks him in the eyes. Softly-

                                  HANNAH
                    I m still here, Mark. I m not going 
                    anywhere.

      He seems buoyed by this, collects himself. He nods.

                                  HANNAH (CONT D)
                    Let s look at that hand.                                                                                    48.



      Vega and Britten exit a bank of elevators. As they move into 
      a hall a HASID in full dress passes them, gets in an elevator 
      going down. 

      Britten stops. A thought. He turns as the elevator doors 
      start to close. 

      The HASID glances back ever so slightly. His eyes meet 
      Britten s. The two of them lock on one another. Even in the 
      garb, Britten sees it. It s the WITNESS. 

      As the doors close, the Hasid cracks a tiny smile.                                                                                    50.


      Britten rushes for the elevator, but it s too late. He flies 
      into the stairwell. Vega, confused, tries to keep up.



      Britten and Bird are driving. Bird is on the phone.

                                  BIRD
                    Yeah. Yeah. Send it over.
                          (hanging up)                                                                                    52.


                                  BIRD (CONT D)
                    Four camper hits in the same area 
                    we canvassed for sex offenders. 
                    Three of them are sitting in their 
                      driveways. One s not. Neighbor says 
                    it s been gone since Monday. 

                                    BRITTEN
                    Day of the murders.

                                  BIRD
                    Says the guy talks about a lake up 
                    in the foothills. Vega s sending us 
                      a description of the area, the 
                    camper, and the guy s ID.

      Bird taps at his laptop. Suddenly he freezes.

                                  BIRD (CONT D)
                    What the hell?

                                    BRITTEN
                    What?

      Bird turns the screen to Britten. It s an ID PHOTO from a 
      driver s license. The MAN in the photo has RED HAIR.

                                  BIRD
                    You want to explain to me how you 
                    knew he was going to be a red head?

      OFF Britten s look - 



      Britten swings the door open, darts in, gun out. But it s 
      quiet. And then he hears something MUFFLED.

      He opens the closet sized bathroom, finds an YOUNG GIRL, 
      bound and gagged inside.

      He quickly pulls her out, begins to release her. As soon as 
      the gag comes down, she simply starts to CRY. Britten takes 
      her in his arms when-

      The door to the camper opens. 

                                  MAN (O.C.)
                    We ll have a good fire tonight. I 
                    got us-

      As the man steps in and notices Bird and Britten he freezes.                                                                                    53.


      He grabs for a knife on the counter, but Bird s gun is up.

                                  BIRD
                    Don t even think about it.

      A beat, and then the MAN bolts.

      Bird is out the door after him, but Britten doesn t move. He 
      just sits there, holding the girl. Outside we hear- 

      TWO SHOTS.

      A long beat as the girl just CRIES into Britten s shoulder-

                                  DR. LEE  (V.O.)
                    I think the red hair settles it in 
                    just the way we ve been looking 
                    for.



      Dr. Lee looks like a man with all the answers. Britten 
      doesn t seem particularly threatened.

                                  DR. LEE
                    There s no evidence suggesting the 
                    suspect in your kidnapping case 
                    would have red hair. The only 
                    reason he did is because it s a 
                      reflection of the REALITY in which 
                    your actual suspect in the cab 
                    driver murders, which came first, 
                    had red hair. If this were a dream, 
                    you d have come up with the red 
                    hair clue before it occurred in 
                    reality. Which would make you 
                    psychic.

                                    BRITTEN
                          (unfazed)
                    So the red hair proves this is 
                    reality. And reading the 
                      constitution proves the other s 
                    reality. So we re back where we 
                    started.

                                  DR. LEE
                      Remembering a portion of the 
                      constitution proves nothing. I 
                    could put you under hypnosis and 
                    drag out a litany of facts and 
                    tidbits from your subconscious that 
                    you d be stunned to find hiding 
                    there.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    54.



      Britten works with a MUCH YOUNGER REX, cutting and gluing.

                                  DR. LEE (V.O.)
                    Perhaps you helped your son with a 
                    project at some point and very 
                    specific portions of the 
                      constitution found their way into 
                    your memory. In the trancelike 
                    state of your dreams, you simply 
                    dredged them up to help deceive 
                    yourself.

      ANGLE ON the project at hand. A Constitutional diorama.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Britten smiles.

                                    BRITTEN
                    By that logic I could just as 
                    easily have come across a red hair 
                    in the kidnapping case and never 
                      consciously noticed it.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Britten looks down at his suit jacket, the one he s been 
      wearing the whole time. He stares at the sleeve. He reaches 
      down and picks off a single red hair. Stares at it.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      As Britten reaches into the closet to smell the carpet his 
      sleeve contacts the hanging clothes, picking up the red hair.

                                    BRITTEN (V.O.)
                    Maybe I picked it up during the 
                      investigation and the only way to 
                    bring it to my attention was to 
                    make it a detail of my dreams. 



      Britten looks happy with himself.

                                    BRITTEN
                    The dreams in which I have to come 
                    see you.                                                                                    55.


      Dr. Lee nods. Okay.

                                  DR. LEE
                    You ve created a mental Mobius 
                    strip. Your mind is free to go back 
                    and fill in any hole if you let it. 
                    So if you re unwilling to commit 
                    yourself to making meaningful 
                    progress, I m not sure why you re 
                    here.

                                    BRITTEN
                    I m here, because they told me I 
                    had to come.

      Dr. Lee takes a beat. Then - 

                                  DR. LEE
                    Your Blood Alcohol Level was 
                    elevated the night of the accident, 
                    wasn t it?

      This suddenly sucks the wind out of Britten s sails.

                                    BRITTEN
                    I don t drink.

                                  DR. LEE
                    That s what you said in the report, 
                    but it was elevated, was it not?

      Britten is silent.

                                  DR. LEE (CONT D)
                    Perhaps your condition comes not so 
                    much from a benevolent desire to 
                    keep your son alive, but an intense 
                    need to try to shield yourself from 
                    your own responsibility for his 
                    death.



      Dr. Evans looks concerned.

                                  DR. EVANS
                    It does raise a host of questions.

                                    BRITTEN
                    I m telling you. I never drink. And 
                    if I did, my wife would never have 
                    let me get behind the wheel.

                                  DR. EVANS
                    And you don t remember anything 
                    about the night leading up to the 
                    accident?

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    56.



      She s thinking.

                                  DR. EVANS
                    Maybe this is all your way of 
                    trying to remember.
                          (to explain)
                    Just as you seem to work out your 
                    cases in your dreams, I wonder if 
                    the entire construction of those 
                    dreams is meant to try to draw your 
                    attention to something bigger. 
                    Maybe that your wife survived in 
                    one and your son in the other, or 
                    the fact that you have different 
                    partners is actually all a way of 
                    getting you to think about that 
                    night. Clues, so to speak, as to 
                    what actually happened.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Vega is doing paperwork at his desk.

                                    BRITTEN
                    What are you still doing here?

                                  VEGA
                    You see all this stuff? Guy had 
                    like a hundred different costumes 
                    in that apartment, was still 
                    showing up to teach 8th grade math 
                    everyday. Nobody suspected a thing.

                                    BRITTEN
                    It s one in the morning. Don t you 
                    have someone waiting for you?                                                                                    57.


                                  VEGA
                    I don t care if I got the promotion 
                    just to hold your hand. I m gonna 
                    prove I deserve it. My wife 
                      understands.

      A beat.

                                    BRITTEN
                    Vega. Trust me. Go home.

      Britten turns to leave, but Vega doesn t move. Britten 
      shrugs. As Britten starts to walk-

                                  VEGA
                    You were joking right?

                                    BRITTEN
                          (stopping)
                    What?

                                  VEGA
                    About going back to that crime 
                    scene because of a dream. That s 
                    not why we went, right? Cause, you 
                    know, weird stuff like that, it s 
                    sort of what they told me to look 
                    out for.

      OFF Britten s expression-


                                                                            CUT TO:



      Dr. Lee leans forward.

                                  DR. LEE
                      Detective, turning yourself in 
                    circles like this, over and over, 
                    it will catch up with you. This 
                    fantasy is far from a benign coping 
                      mechanism. When your brain should 
                    be resting, recharging, you re 
                    using it to hold up a detailed and 
                      complicated alternate reality. A 
                    reality that only gets more 
                      complicated the longer it exists. 
                    That is unsustainable, Detective 
                    Britten. I m afraid that the longer 
                    you continue, the more you 
                      jeopardize your already tenuous 
                    grasp on reality. It is, quite 
                    simply, a road to madness.

      A long beat as this weighs on Britten. Then-

                                    BRITTEN
                    The thing is doctor -

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Britten assists Hannah, clearing out the last of Rex s stuff. 
      She looks at him, leans down, opens a paint can.

                                    BRITTEN (V.O.)
                    And when you see a loved one being 
                    buried, the one thought you have 
                    over and over and over again, is 
                    that you would give ANYTHING to 
                    change it.

      Suddenly, her  move past it  exterior cracks and she finally 
      begins to CRY. As he pulls her into his arms-

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Britten and Rex have dinner in the bar, watching football 
      highlights on the screen.                                                                                    60.


                                    BRITTEN (V.O.)
                    Then let me assure you I will 
                    happily pay it.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Britten and Hannah eat. She s still raw, emotional.

                                    BRITTEN (V.O.)
                    I ll come here as long as they make 
                    me, but trust me- 

      She puts her hand on his. They look in one another s eyes.

                                    BRITTEN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    I have no desire to ever make 
                    progress.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Britten and his wife lay in bed together, only a sliver of 
      light sneaking through the window. A LONG SILENCE. Then -

                                  HANNAH
                    Will you see him tonight?

      Britten looks over at her. He s not sure what she wants to 
      hear. He simply opts for the truth.

                                    BRITTEN
                    Yes.

      She takes that in. He prepares himself for the 
        recriminations. Instead, she kisses him on the cheek.

      Softly-

                                  HANNAH
                    Tell him that I love him.

      As she turns away Britten fights the lump in his throat. 

                                    BRITTEN
                    I will.

      Britten closes his eyes. 

      We push in very close on his closed eyelids. A long beat. 
      Then-

      He opens them.
