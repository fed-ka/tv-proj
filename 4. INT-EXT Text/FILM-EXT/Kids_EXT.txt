Telly exits the building. CASPER is sitting on a middle step. He is reading a comic book and drinking a 40oz. Bottle of malt liquor. The bottle is wrapped in a brown paper sack. As he sips his drink he laughs at his comic book.
Casper is Telly's second half. The two have been best friends since grade school. Casper is small and funny, everyone likes him, he has a quick temper, and he isn't scared to fight someone twice his size. Telly provides Casper with a sense of adolescent wisdom. Casper makes Telly happy; he's a smart ass, he has a strong New York accent, an assortment of tattoos, and crooked teeth. Telly and Casper are always together, They help each other to survive.
Telly smacks Casper on the back of his head. Casper is startled and spills a little bit of his beer onto his shoes.
CASPER
Shit.
TELLY
(smiling)
Was up bitch?
Casper looks at Telly smiling.
CASPER
Oh shit what happened?
Casper is very excited. He stands up and pulls Telly's arm.
TELLY
What do you think?
CASPER
You fucked it?
Telly laughs and Casper jumps up and down.
CASPER
I knew you fucked it! I sat out her for like two hours! That girl was like twelve, and you hit it up!
TELLY
(pounding his chest)
Who am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon.
They both start to laugh.
They move off the stairs and start walking down the sidewalk. The two of them are walking down the street, obvious to everything but themselves talking.
CASPER
Well, how was it?
TELLY
Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
CASPER
She can fuck?
TELLY
Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
CASPER
Oh shit. How long did it take?
TELLY
Did what take?
CASPER
How long did you fuck her?
They cross the street, paying no attention to speeding cars. Casper is listening to every word that Telly says. Casper seems much happier than Telly. Telly is laid-back. Casper is hyper as he jumps up and down and claws Telly's arm.
TELLY
Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time.
CASPER
Yeah.
TELLY
But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good.
CASPER
How did she smell? Did her puss stink?
Telly puts his four fingers together and then puts his hand in front of Caper's nose.
TELLY
Take a whiff.
Casper takes a huge whiff, the snot in his nose makes a loud sound as he smells Telly's fingers.
CASPER
Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.
TELLY
Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
CASPER
Oh man, that's the best.
TELLY
You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
CASPER
Let me smell it again.
Telly lifts his fingers once again, as Casper breathes in the odor.
CASPER
That's why virgins are the best. I love that smell.
As they walk down the street, joggers, men in business suits with briefcases, ambulances, and women with baby carriages all pass by.
TELLY
You know what else?
CASPER
What?
TELLY
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
CASPER
How?
TELLY
Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
CASPER
Right.
TELLY
And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cut when you were little.
CASPER
Yeah.
TELLY
And she goes, yeah that picture was taken less than a year ago. I look younger without my makeup.
Casper starts to crack up.
TELLY
And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby.
CASPER
Yeah.
TELLY
And for a second I felt a little bit guilty. You know, because she's young and all. And then I was like, oh shit, that turns me on. I wanna fuck this little baby girl.
They both laugh.
CASPER
Fuckin perverted bastard.
They continue to laugh and walk.
TELLY
I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit.
CASPER
To what? Virgins?
TELLY
Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies.
CASPER
What do you mean?
TELLY
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
CASPER
You mean like fucking two virgins at once.
TELLY
(laughing)
That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.
CASPER
(laughing)
She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
TELLY
I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect.
CASPER
Did you tell her that you loved her?
TELLY
Like. Like. Never love. Love is for low-level virgin seduction guys.
They stop walking. Casper takes the last sip of his beer, then throws it toward an orange trash can. He misses the can and the bottle smashes in the middle of a busy street.
CASPER
Shit.
TELLY
What do you want?
CASPER
Get another forty.
(burps)
Smoke a blunt.
TELLY
Are you hungry?
CASPER
Hell yeah. Fuckin starvin. Wait up a sec.
Casper takes two steps away and starts urinating in someone's bushes. People walk by and stare.
TELLY
You wanna go to Paul's house?
CASPER
What for? That guys a dick.
TELLY
I'm sue he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
CASPER
You think he's got any herb?
TELLY
I don't know, he quit dealin but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
CASPER
You think?
TELLY
Probably.
CASPER
He lives on 76th?
TELLY
78th.
CASPER
Den less go Joe.
He zips up his pants.
They start walking again. Casper is carrying a folded up comic book in his hand.
CASPER
Telly.
TELLY
Yeah.
CASPER
Did she suck your dick?
TELLY
A little bit. But I didn't really want her to.
CASPER
Why?
TELLY
I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
CASPER
It is right.
TELLY
I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
CASPER
It's no big deal, right?
TELLY
Right. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it.
CASPER
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.
(they both start laughing)
It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
TELLY
Yep.
CASPER
They're gonna tell their grand kids.
(mimicking an old lady)
That Telly. He sure was good in the sack!
The two of them are laughing, their conversation has gotten them very excited.
They walk in front of a Korean grocery. The grocery has a small outdoor produce section, juice, fruit, sodas, etc. A KOREAN GUY with flip-flops and headphones is sitting on a tall wooden stool.
TELLY
You thirsty?
CASPER
Yeah, I feel dehydrated.
TELLY
You got any money?
CASPER
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
TELLY
You down with the boost?
CASPER
(whispers)
Unzip my pack, yo.
He turns around and Telly quickly unzips his backpack.
Casper and Telly are walking down the street. Casper is eating a peach and drinking his 40oz. beer. Telly is also drinking.
CASPER
You know like in "The Wonder Twins" they share everything.
TELLY
The cartoon?
CASPER
Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know.
(mimics the cartoon)
Activate in the form of, a glass of water.
TELLY
Yeah.
CASPER
Well, those guys share everything, right?
TELLY
Right.
CASPER
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
TELLY
Right.
CASPER
And it got me thinkin. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.
TELLY
(laughing)
Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
CASPER
No, I'm serious man. I'm dead ass. Do you wanna try? We could be like the fuckin X-rated "Wonder Twins"!
The two of them start laughing and jumping on each other. Telly spits out a mouthful of beer.
CASPER
(laughing)
Can you do it man?
TELLY
(laughing)
Can I do it? I just brooke her cherry. I imagine I can make her do anything. Bark like a dog, jump through a ring of fire.
Casper is jumping up and down on Telly's shoulder.
CASPER
Oh man. I fucking love this guy.
The two of them walk off laughing.
A medium sized apartment building on the Upper East Side. Cars are speeding by the front of the building. Cabs drive by and beep their horns.
Telly and Casper are sitting on the front steps. Telly rings one of the buttons. The bottom switchboard is plastered with skateboarding stickers and "Legalize Marijuana" stickers. A Vespa scooter is parked on the outside in front of the building, it also has stickers on it.
Telly rings it again. It is a very hot day, both boys are wiping sweat from their bodies.
PAUL
(from box)
Hello?
TELLY
It's me. Telly.
PAUL
(from box)
Hello?
TELLY
(loudly)
Paul it's Telly. Open up.
A buzz is heard.
There is a little girl sitting on the bottom step, playing with a doll. Casper runs down and gives her a peach. Then he runs back up.
Telly and Casper enter the building.
The little girl tosses the peach to the ground.
Casper and Telly run down the stairwell. People enter and exit.
Telly and Casper walk up to the house. Telly lives in a flat on St. Marks; downtown. Two Spanish hoodlums are sitting on the front steps. Telly and Casper walk up and slap their hands.
Casper looks for some place to hide his beer. One of the hoodlums puts his hand out and Casper gives it to him.
Telly opens the door with his key and Casper follows close behind. They walk straight to the end of the hallway and enter.
Telly's house is cluttered. The house is nice but organized. The kitchen has pots and pans hanging from the ceiling. There is a Matisse poster hanging in a frame. Large bookshelves filled to the gills with books. Big plush couches in the living room, a rocking chair in the corner. A small wooden piano. A scattered game of Monopoly is on the dinning room table, a few cats roam the house. On the wall are pictures of Telly as a young boy, and large family portraits.
Telly and Casper walk into the living room, then enter the kitchen.
Telly's mom is in the kitchen breast-feeding a small baby. She has her hair pulled back and her breast out. There is a small television set on the kitchen counter that she is watching.
TELLY
Hi mom.
MOM
Hi Telly. Where you been?
CASPER
Hi.
MOM
Hi Casper.
Telly goes to the refrigerator and takes out a big jug of Kool-Aid. Casper gets the glasses down from the cabinet.
TELLY
We were out trying to find a job.
Pouring the Kool-Aid.
MOM
Any luck?
CASPER
No none.
MOM
So, what are you gonna do for money this summer?
TELLY
I don't know. Find a job.
(pause)
Hey can I borrow some money?
Casper is staring at Telly's mom as she breast-feeds.
MOM
Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
TELLY
But then I won't need your money.
MOM
That's right.
Casper is staring at Telly's mom's breast.
CASPER
Man, Telly, your little brother is getting big.
TELLY
Yeah.
Telly walks out of the kitchen and up the stairs, Casper slowly staggers behind.
As they walk up the stairs, Telly pulls his shirt off and wipes his underarms and chest.
Casper pulls Telly's arm.
CASPER
Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.
TELLY
Shut the fuck up.
The two of them enter Telly's parents room.
Jennie walks up the stairs to Paul's apartment. She takes her finger down the list of names.
She rings his bell. Paul sounds really messed up.
PAUL
(from the speaker, laughter and noise)
Hello.
JENNIE
Hello Paul. Is Telly inside?
PAUL
(laughing)
Is Telly there?
PAUL
This is Paul. Who is this?
JENNIE
It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.
PAUL
(drunkenly, laughter)
Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me?
JENNIE
I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly?
PAUL
Telly's not here right now. I believe he went downtown. Casper too.
Jennie walks down the stairs. A little white girl is sitting on the bottom stair, playing with a black doll. The doll has no hair and it's dress is ripped. She looks up at Jennie.
LITTLE GIRL
My dolly is black... Lucy.
The girl sticks her doll out so Jennie can hold it.
Casper and Telly are standing by the chess tables. The park is very busy. Every chess table is being used. People are riding bikes and roller-blading. Strong men are doing pull-ups on the monkey bars while guys walk by with ghetto blasters. A state of public frenzy.
A Rastafarian drug dealer with a big dread cap is standing a little bit away from Telly and Casper. He is approaching everyone as they walk by him.
DRUG DEALER
(fast and slurred)
... Sess... Smoke, hash, shrooms, valium, coke... Sessamila.
CASPER
Yo, was up Ras!
RAS
Ah Caspa! Was up little blood clot?
Casper and Telly walk up and shake his hand.
CASPER
Nuffin. You gots?
RAS
Shoot yeah boy. Fuckin best herb. Uptown shit boy.
TELLY
None of that twigs and pebbles shit.
Another guy trying to sell drugs walks up, but Ras just pushes him away.
Telly pulls the money out of his back pocket.
Ras pulls out a dime bag and pushes it open. He looks around and then puts it in Casper's face.
RAS
Fucking good skunk.
CASPER
Smells delicious.
Casper starts to laugh.
Telly goes to hand the drug dealer the money. Ras looks around to make sure it's safe.
RAS
Throw it down.
He points to the floor; then throws the weed on the ground. Telly drops two five dollar bills.
CASPER
Thanks Ras.
RAS
Caspa!!!
Ras laughs. The two of them slap hands. Ras slaps Telly's hand and walks away.
The park is extremely crowded. The kids hang out in front of the arch by the fountain and around the sides. There are about ten kids skateboarding. The fountain is on and the mist is spraying the kids. Girls in hip-hop fashion are lined up all around. A few kids are drawing graffiti in little black books. There are maybe twenty kids hanging out around the fountain, in front of the arch.
Casper and Telly walk up to the center of the action.
They greet their friends sitting on the edge of the fountain. Skateboarders ride up and slap their hands. As they greet their friends, they kiss the girls on the cheek and a few of them on the lips, they slap hands with the guys and embrace some with a hug.
Telly and Casper go down the line, greeting everyone. This process takes a while, as they interact with everyone down the line.
HAROLD is a skinny black skateboarder with a funny face. He rides up to Casper and hugs him.
HAROLD
Casper! Was up kid?
CASPER
Nothen B.
HAROLD
Where you at?
CASPER
Right here.
HAROLD
Where you goin tonight?
CASPER
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
HAROLD
You goin?
CASPER
Yeah.
HAROLD
I'm goin. You on the list?
CASPER
Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.
HAROLD
I had a female vagina last night.
HAMILTON, a short black guy with a Gilligan hat, walks up.
HAMILTON
Yo Cass, you got any boom?
Telly is sitting on the cement benches talking to MISHA, a pretty young girl with a belly button pierce.
CASPER
Yep. You got a Phillie?
HAMILTON
Presto.
Hamilton pulls out a long Phillie cigar. Then he squeezes in between Casper and another guy.
Casper pulls out his dime bag and sniffs it. The he puts it in front of Hamilton's nose.
HAMILTON
You got that here in the park?
CASPER
Yep.
HAMILTON
Break that shit up.
Casper is smushing the pot up. Hamilton is taking the plastic of the cigar. In this shot they go through the complete process of rolling a blunt. The next sequence
should be done with fast edits.
HAMILTON
Cut it.
Hamilton cuts the cigar down the center with his long thumbnail.
HAMILTON
Scrape it.
He then scrapes all the tobacco out of the center and onto the ground.
HAMILTON
Lick it.
He then licks the outer paper till it gets very damp.
HAMILTON
Dump it.
Casper starts putting the weed inside, Hamilton licks it, then pulls out a lighter and dries it.
HAMILTON
And smoke it.
Hamilton puts it in his mouth.
HAMILTON
You wanna start off?
Hamilton looks at Casper and puts the blunt in his face.
CASPER
Naw, you got it Ham.
Hamilton smiles.
HAMILTON
All right.
He puts the blunt in his mouth and lights it. A big flame shoots up as it catches the end of the Phillie. Hamilton takes a few big puffs and then blows the smoke away.
HAMILTON
Take two pulls and pass.
Hamilton passes the blunt to Casper. A bunch of kids start huddling around Casper as he puffs.
STEVEN, a skinny Spanish kid with gold front teeth, walks up.
STEVEN
Yo can I fuck wit dat?
Casper smiles and blows smoke in his face.
CASPER
Yeah boy!
Casper hits it again and then hands it to Steve, who takes immense hits.
Two male homosexuals in short shorts walk by holding hands.
Steven turns his head and notices them. He exhales the smoke out of his nose.
STEVEN
Look at that.
HAROLD
That shit is sick. Fuckin faggots.
CASPER
(screaming at the top of his lungs)
Fuckin faggots!!!
Everyone starts laughing.
CASPER
(as loud as possible)
Faggots!!!
Casper rubs his throat. People continue to laugh.
CASPER
My throat.
Telly is sitting away on the cement benches under the tree. He is talking to Misha.
MISHA
How can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk.
TELLY
You think so?
MISHA
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
TELLY
He still does.
MISHA
I hate 'em.
TELLY
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
MISHA
Yeah?
TELLY
You've heard the stories right?
MISHA
No.
Back in time. Casper is a little boy, age 11. He is walking down the sidewalk with a lunch box and a "Casper the Friendly Ghost" T-shirt. He is wearing his hat on backwards.
Music accompanies this entire episode.
TELLY (V.O.)
Well, one day Casper had a stomachache and he got permission from his teacher to leave school early and go home.
Casper walks up to a nice middle-class home, it could be in Queens or Brooklyn, it doesn't matter. He pulls out a key and opens the door. He enters his home.
Telly is in the same spot talking to Misha.
TELLY
So that's why Casper is how he is.
MISHA
Oh god. That's horrible.
A quick shot of Casper smoking a blunt and laughing with his friends.
TELLY
Yep.
MISHA
Holy shi. That's all true?
TELLY
No. I was just kidding.
MISHA
(outraged)
What?!
TELLY
I lied. His dad is still alive. He works for the post office.
Casper and all his friends are passing around the blunt, which by now is almost gone. All that is left is a roach and Casper is sucking on it really hard.
Casper breathes out the smoke and then passes the roach to Hamilton.
CASPER
Yo, that weed is mad good.
Hamilton gets ready to puff.
HAMILTON
Hells yeah. Gimmie a taste of the mothafuckin chronic.
Casper rubs his eyes.
Hamilton puffs on the little roach.
Casper grabs somebody's skateboard and stands on it. He starts rolling around slowly and doing some tricks.
The other kids continue to smoke. They watch Casper and laugh.
Casper is slowly trying to do tricks, but he's so stoned that he just falls off.
As he skates in front of is friends he doesn't pay any attention to where he's going.
A tall HOODLUM with gold front teeth is walking by. He is wearing all Polo and a thick white Fila headband. He is biting down on a chew stick.
The hoodlum walks by. He has a certain ominous strut. He is looking at the ground as he walks.
He takes the chew stick out of his mouth and looks at some girl's ass as she walks by. He makes a little noise with his mouth.
As the hoodlum walks by, Casper is rolling backward, not paying attention. He rolls into the hoodlum's heels. Casper falls down and laughs. Everyone watching laughs, including Telly who is still sitting with Misha.
Casper jumps up and grabs his skateboard. The hoodlum is turned around. Casper walks up to him with a smile.
CASPER
Yo, sorry money.
The hoodlum is a good seven inches taller than Casper. He puts his arms out like he's upset.
HOODLUM
Yeah watch the fuck where you skate. You know what I'm saying?
CASPER
(smiling)
Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.
HOODLUM
What?
CASPER
Nuffin G. Just forget it.
HOODLUM
What the fuck yo? You wanna catch a beat down?
Casper throws his skateboard down. He quickly turns around and pulls his pants up. He runs right up to the hoodlum and he looks up at him.
CASPER
Sup then? Sup?
HOODLUM
Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
Telly and Misha are watching. Telly stands up.
TELLY
Uh oh. Casper's in the mix.
He quickly walks up.
All the guys jump up and start screaming.
STEVEN
Oh shit. Throw down.
Steven and all the guys run up and surround the hoodlum. They all start screaming taunts. "Fuck 'em up Casper!"
Casper is inches from the hoodlum. They are both in a fighting stance. Casper keeps pulling his pants up. Casper has a huge smile on his face, like this is his favorite thing in the whole world.
CASPER
Sup. Sup.
HOODLUM
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
CASPER
I'm gonna fuck you up bitch.
They are both right about to swing.
Everyone in the whole park has turned their attention to the scuffle.
All of a sudden, out of nowhere, Harold runs up behind the Hoodlum and with the truck of his skateboard, smashes the guy in the back of the head. A huge thud is heard and the hoodlum just kinda falls forward on his knees.
Casper, with a big smile, steps back and kicks the guy in the face as hard as he can.
Everyone gets in a big circle around the fallen hoodlum. They're all screaming. Even the girls are screaming. "Fuck 'em up!"
Harold continues hitting the hoodlum with his skateboard.
Hitting him on the legs and stomach.
Casper is jumping up and down on the hoodlum's head.
CASPER
(everytime he kicks the guy he says this)
Suck my dick! Suck my dick! Suck my dick!
All of a sudden, all the skateboarders in the park, including Hamilton and Steven, take their boards and start smashing this guy, over and over.
The hoodlum is on the ground holding his head, as everyone frantically tries to kill him.
The focus should be on the face of the skateboarders. How much they are enjoying this. They continue to pound him, over and over, like animals in on the prey.
This should look very scary, as twenty guys try to kill the fallen hoodlum. Even little kids are in the middle, beating the guy.
Telly looks up to the sky. He makes a loud noise as he clears his throat, like he's gathering mucus. Then he puts his arms down and stops some of the kids from hitting the hoodlum. His face is completely cracked and bloody. Telly steps over him and spits a huge phlegm wad onto his face.
Casper, still smiling, kicks the guy in the face.
CASPER
Suck my dick, Suck my dick. Suck my dick.
Everyone stops kicking the guy and they all get kinda silent and look at him. He looks completely twisted, bloody, and dead.
Casper bends over, right in his face.
CASPER
(smiling)
Now get in my way! Bitch.
CUT TO BLACK
Jennie is in the back of a speeding cab. She is looking out the window. Her face looks sad.
The TAXI DRIVER is a funny looking old man. He's wearing a jockey hat and a Hawaiian shirt. He has air fresheners hanging from the mirror. He is chewing on a big wet cigar. He has a half shaved beard. He looks like a dirty old man.
Jennie looks dazed.
As the taxi driver drives, he looks in his mirror at Jennie. He pulls his cigar out of his mouth and then puts it back in.
Jazz is playing on the radio.
TAXI DRIVER
Excuse me. Can I ask you a question?
Jennie just shrugs.
TAXI DRIVER
Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest.
JENNIE
What?
TAXI DRIVER
Well, I don't mean to be a pest. It was just that I was looking at you. And you look upset. I liked looking at you, but your face looks upset. And I was wondering if I could be of any assistance? Maybe I could cheer you up or somethin. Help make you happy. Who knows? Somethin maybe.
As the taxi driver talks, he looks in the mirror, and then looks at the road. He is driving fast and clumsy. He pulls out his cigar and then puts it back in his mouth.
JENNIE
No. I'm OK. Thanks.
TAXI DRIVER
You're OK?
JENNIE
Yeah.
TAXI DRIVER
Because gee, you don't look OK. I mean your a very beautiful young lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all...
JENNIE
Yeah well, it's been a bad day.
TAXI DRIVER
A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul.
The taxi driver begins to laugh a really squeaky laugh.
JENNIE
Sorry.
TAXI DRIVER
Oh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does.
Jennie continues to look glumly out the window.
TAXI DRIVER
You know. I could tell you were sad by the way your eyes drooped. Like an adopted kid. That's the way an adopted kid's eyes look. All sad like that. All droopy and sweet. Like the honey that I lick off my finger.
He starts to laugh. Jennie continues to look sadly out the window.
TAXI DRIVER
Would I be prying if I asked you what was wrong?
Jennie is silent.
TAXI DRIVER
Miss, would I be prying?
JENNIE
Everything is wrong.
TAXI DRIVER
No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
JENNIE
Yeah, I guess so.
TAXI DRIVER
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
JENNIE
No.
TAXI DRIVER
Are you in trouble with the law?
JENNIE
No.
TAXI DRIVER
Am I getting warm?
Jennie smiles. The taxi driver looks in the mirror and sees Jennie smiling.
TAXI DRIVER
Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.
JENNIE
Yeah?
TAXI DRIVER
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
JENNIE
Thanks.
TAXI DRIVER
Yeah. Right around the cheeks and chin. Boy did I have a crush on her. She was the first girl I ever put my tongue in her mouth.
He stops at a red light and turns around to look at her.
TAXI DRIVER
Hey look. Whatever it is. Just forget about it. Life's too short. Make yourself happy. I'll give you an example. When my golden retriever passed away. God rest his soul.
(he punches the roof of the cab)
I was lonesome. I missed him. So I got a tattoo.
He pulls up his shirt and reveals a tattoo of a dog on his forearm. It says "Bruno" in big letters.
TAXI DRIVER
Now how do you like that? Now he's with me forever.
The light turns and he starts driving.
TAXI DRIVER
I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.
JENNIE
Yeah?
TAXI DRIVER
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
JENNIE
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
TAXI DRIVER
Well then, I don't know. You know what you do then? You forget. Block it out. I remember when I was a little boy. My grandmother told me to be happy. She said. She said, "Leon, my darling little grandson. If you want to be happy don't think. Don't bump into any walls. If you stutter. Don't talk" And I took her advice. And look at me now. Couldn't be happier.
He starts to laugh.
A quick shot of his identification badge. He has a really goofy smile and he's wearing the same Hawaiian shirt.
TAXI DRIVER
That's life.
Jennie is smiling.
JENNIE
Your a real philosopher.
TAXI DRIVER
Yeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell.
He pulls up on Washington Square Park. He slams on the brakes and turns around in his seat.
TAXI DRIVER
Well here we are, Miss.
Jennie pulls some money out.
TAXI DRIVER
Aw, don't worry 'bout it. The rides on me.
Jennie has the money up to the glass.
TAXI DRIVER
All right, all right, I'll take it. But forget about the tip.
He takes her money.
JENNIE
Thanks. Bye.
The taxi driver sticks his head out the window.
TAXI DRIVER
Oh yeah. Oh Miss. Miss. When you smile, God notices. That's why the sun is shining.
He points up to the sky before pulling away.
Telly is standing in the road in front of Darcy's apartment building. Casper, Harold, Steven, and two other girls named KIM and JOY are all leaning against and sitting on a parked car. Casper and Steven both have a quart of malt liquor in their hands.
Telly is looking straight up. He puts his hands together and raises them to his mouth.
TELLY
(screaming)
Darcy!!!
(pause)
Darcy!!!
Bennie, a skinny 18 year old, sticks his chest out the window. He's chewing on an apple and not wearing a shirt.
He looks down at Telly
TELLY
(yelling)
Hey Bennie. What's up?
Bennie is munching on his apple.
BENNIE
Nuffin. What do you want?
TELLY
Is your sister home?
BENNIE
You want Darcy?
TELLY
Yeah.
BENNIE
Hold on. Let me see if she's here.
He sticks his head inside and screams.
BENNIE
(his voice from upstairs)
Darcy!!!
Casper is sitting on the car, he has his arm wrapped around Kim.
CASPER
Hurry up man. Let's be out. I wanna go swimmin.
TELLY
Hold up man.
Darcy sticks her head out the window. She is very pretty, very young, clean, and innocent.
DARCY
Hey.
TELLY
Hey. What are you doin right now?
DARCY
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
TELLY
Don't take a bath. Come swimmin with us!
KIM
Hi Darcy.
DARCY
(smiles, waves)
Hi Kim. Hi Joy.
TELLY
Come on. Come swimmin with us.
DARCY
Right now?
TELLY
Yeah. Come on.
DARCY
(looks inside)
Hold on.
Telly walks over to the other guys.
JOY
So this is your new girl, huh?
TELLY
I hope so. For now.
JOY
You like 'em kinda young right. Babies?
TELLY
I like 'em new. Not like you.
JOY
Fuck you.
Everyone starts laughing. Telly pulls the beer our of Casper's hand and starts chugging it.
CASPER
Damn bitch. Don't kill it.
Telly hands the bottle back to Casper.
HAROLD
Yo, you think we killed that guy?
CASPER
Na.
HAROLD
You sure?
CASPER
I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
HAROLD
Yo, we might have killed him. You think?
STEVE
I don't think we killed him. Because after it was through, I saw him twitch.
CASPER
Yeah, he was crawling around and shit.
HAROLD
Man we fucked him up.
CASPER
Hell ya. We broke that mothafucka.
JOY
You guys are fucking sick. You know that?
CASPER
That's OK. Cause that's how I'm livin.
HAROLD
Yep.
Casper slaps hands with Harold.
Darcy walks out of her apartment building. She is wearing a bikini top with baggy denim jean shorts. Her hair is pushed back and she has a backpack on.
As she walks out of the building, Telly's eyes light up.
DARCY
Ready.
Telly walks up to Darcy and kisses her on the cheek.
TELLY
You look nice.
Jennie is standing under the arch. She is looking for Telly.
Misha is sitting on the fountain talking to some guy.
Jennie walks up to Misha.
MISHA
Hey girl was up?
Jennie kisses Misha on the cheek.
JENNIE
Just a lot of crazy shit.
MISHA
Yeah?
JENNIE
Yeah. Have you seen Telly around?
MISHA
Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid.
JENNIE
What happened?
MISHA
I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
JENNIE
Do you know where he went?
MISHA
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
JENNIE
Who, Benny's little sister?
MISHA
Yeah. She should be at Nasa tonight. Why you lookin for him? You like him now or sometin?
Jennie just looks at Misha.
The pool is closed. Large black gates surround the premises.
All the kids are climbing up the gates. Casper is the first one to the top and just jumps over. Eventually everyone follows.
They all walk up to the pool and start taking their clothes off.
Casper pulls his shirt and pants off. He looks over at Kim, who is wearing G-string underwear.
CASPER
Geez Kim. Your body looks fuckin good.
KIM
Thanks.
CASPER
It's funny how sometimes you can't tell if a girl has a nice body until you see her without her clothes.
Kim smiles.
Harold starts imitating a strong man. He starts flexing his muscles. He's wearing a pair of baggy boxer shorts. Then he turns to Joy.
HAROLD
Hey Joy. You ever see a black man's lasso?
JOY
What?
Harold pulls out his penis and starts twirling it around.
JOY
HAROLD!!!
She starts jumping up and down. Everyone is cracking up. Harold has his dick in his hand.
HAROLD
Hi ho Silver and away!!!
Harold jumps in. Steven pushes Casper in and Casper takes Steven with him. Joy and Kim jump in together.
CASPER
Oh shit it's fuckin cold.
They start splashing each other.
Darcy and Telly walk over to the other side and sit down on the edge of the pool with their feet in the water.
Telly starts smiling at Darcy. He cups a little bit of water in his hands and pours it on her thigh.
Everyone else is in the water making noise and splashing around.
DARCY
Ooh. You're gonna give me goose bumps.
TELLY
Is it cold?
Darcy puts some water in her hand and does the same thing.
TELLY
You know I've been thinking about you lately.
DARCY
(surprised)
You have?
TELLY
Yeah. After I saw you last week.
DARCY
At the block party?
TELLY
Yeah.
Darcy smiles. She looks a little bit embarrassed.
TELLY
I was lookin for you all day today.
DARCY
You were?
TELLY
Sure. I even thought about you when I woke up.
A quick three second flashback of him having sex earlier that day with the young virgin girl. It's very loud as she screams.
TELLY
I was like. I gotta find Darcy. Where is she at? I was lookin all over.
Darcy smiles.
Joy and Kim are sitting next to each other on the steps in the shallow end of the pool. Steven, Harold, and Casper are in the water in front of the girls.
Joy and Kim are both wearing bras.
CASPER
I'll give you a dollar if you let me suck on your tit.
Kim kicks water in his face.
CASPER
No I'm serious. Can I suck your tit? Either of you guys. I don't care.
HAROLD
Yeah me too.
KIM
Casper, why do you think I would let you suck on my boobs?
CASPER
I don't know. Your just sitting there. And your tits look clean to me. It makes me
want to suck on 'em.
Telly is sitting in the same spot, talking to Darcy.
DARCY
I thought you had a girlfriend.
TELLY
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
DARCY
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
TELLY
She won't? Why not?
DARCY
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
TELLY
Yeah. I can understand that.
Back to the shallow end with Casper, Steven, Harold, Kim, and Joy.
HAROLD
I truth or dare you guys to kiss each other.
JOY
Sure. We kiss all the time.
They both smile at each other and kiss softly on the lips. As they part, they smile.
CASPER
You guys are dykes right?
KIM
No.
JOY
No.
STEVEN
Then how can you kiss each other like that?
Harold makes a strange face.
HAROLD
Yeah. How can you do that shit?
KIM
It doesn't matter. It just feels good. That's all.
JOY
Yeah. It's not like we're gay. It's just kissing another person, a friend.
Joy grabs Kim's hand.
KIM
Yeah.
JOY
It's no big deal.
CASPER
I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice.
HAROLD
Yeah. Do it again.
Telly and Darcy.
TELLY
You should come back with me to Steven's house.
DARCY
Tonight?
TELLY
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
DARCY
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
TELLY
Come on. You can rave on another night.
She looks at him.
TELLY
Come on. It'll be fun. We'll just bug
out. There should be a bunch of people. It'll be fun I promise.
DARCY
Yeah?
TELLY
Yeah. It'll be nice. It'll be a change of pace. That club shit gets boring.
This is the line to Nasa. People are lined up and down the block waiting to get inside. All the kids are wearing rave clothing which resembles clown suits with stack shoes and huge colorful hats. It looks like a hip-hop circus.
Jennie is walking quickly past everyone on line. She comes to the front.
SID, a short gay Chinese boy with orange hair, is carrying a clipboard guest list under his arm and has a Sesame Street purse in his other hand. When he sees Jennie, he walks up and unclips the rope.
SID
Jennie! Was up girl?
Sid bends over and gives Jennie a kiss.
JENNIE
Hi Sid.
After Jennie walks in, Sid reclips the rope.
Jennie walks up the stairs and past the security guards and metal detectors.
SECURITY GUARD
Hi Jennie.
Jennie smiles and walks by.
Nasa is like a giant warehouse. It has hallways and rooms. Kids invade every inch of the club.
As Jennie walks in, the Techno music grows very loud. The music should sound as if you were stuck in a fast-paced video game.
Kids are running around everywhere. The CAMERA follows Jennie through the club as if it is seeing everything Jennie sees.
The dance floor is packed with kids holding flashlights and sucking on pacifiers.
As she walks through the darkened hallways, people are against the walls making out.
As she gets to the end of the hallway, there is a big crowd of people. She jumps to see what everyone is looking at.
FIDGET, a short white guy who is very hyper and speaks very quickly, runs up to Jennie and grabs her wrist.
FIDGET
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?
JENNIE
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
FIDGET
Oh man. You gotta see this. It's a spectacle. A real spectacle.
Fidget pulls Jennie through the crowd.
FIDGET
Now look at that. Amazing sexual exploration.
There are three girls and one boy making out against the back wall. The boy is wearing an afro wig. They all have their clothes on, but they are all going at it like crazy.
Two of the girls are making out with each other while they rub the boy. The other girl is kissing the boy while he is feeling on her body.
Jennie looks surprised. The other kids are laughing and yelling at them.
One of the girls making out looks at the crowd and sticks her tongue out.
GIRL
You don't have to look at us. It's not a free show.
She continues making out.
Everyone laughs. The music is loud and adds to the intensity of the scene.
JENNIE
Who are they?
FIDGET
I don't know. I've never seen any of them before. Cornballs from Jersey on X. Feelin the effex.
Fidget looks at Jennie, she looks depressed.
FIDGET
Come on Jennie. Jen.
He pulls her by the wrist. He takes her into the bathroom. In the bathroom there are kids in big circles smoking pot and buying pills.
FIDGET
I got a present for you.
He digs in his pocket.
JENNIE
What is it?
FIDGET
Bang up stuff.
He pulls out a pill.
FIDGET
This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster.
JENNIE
No, Fidget, I...
FIDGET
Come on Jennie. You look sad. Just take it.
JENNIE
No...
FIDGET
Here. Swallow.
He puts the pill in her mouth, and she reluctantly takes it.
FIDGET
Now you'll be floatin up in Techno heaven. Don't worry, tricks are for kids.
Telly and Darcy are kissing each other in front of the apartment building.
TELLY
Do you like kissing me?
DARCY
Yes.
He kisses her again.
TELLY
Do you like me?
Darcy nods.
DARCY
Uh huh.
TELLY
I think you're like the best girl I've ever kissed.
Darcy kisses Telly. She begins to suck his bottom lip.
TELLY
I don't even want to talk, but I gotta tell you that when I first saw you last week, I, I couldn't stop thinking about you. You've been stuck in my head.
DARCY
Come on.
TELLY
No. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all.
DARCY
I like you too.
He starts kissing her neck and chin.
The car is very dark. Jennie is in the backseat, scooted all the way in the corner.
It is silent except for the sound of the bumpy ride.
Everything is silent for a while as Jennie looks more and more upset. She has a quart in her hand.
JENNIE
(silently as she looks out the window)
I'm not gonna die.
Jennie sheds a few tears and then wipes them off with the hand she is holding the beer with.
Jennie is drinking a beer in the backseat of the taxi. She looks upset.
The birds are chirping. People are going to work. Stores are opening. Homeless people are just waking up from doorway slumber. Morning in Manhattan.
As Telly does his V.O., the CAMERA will show everyone asleep in the apartment. It will go all around the room as daylight enters through the windows. The CAMERA also watches Telly and Darcy asleep in each other's arm's.
TELLY (V.O.)
When you're young. Not much matters. When you find something that you care about, then that's all you got. When your young. A lot of the time fucking is all you have, hen you go to sleep at night, you dream of pussy. When you wake up, it's the same thing. It's in your face, in your dreams, you can't escape it. Sometimes when you're young, the only place to go is inside. That's just it. Fucking is what I love. Take that away from me, and I really got nothin.
The CAMERA focuses on Casper. He is sitting up awake on the couch. All his clothes are off.
He looks straight into the CAMERA.
CASPER
Jesus Christ. What happened?
