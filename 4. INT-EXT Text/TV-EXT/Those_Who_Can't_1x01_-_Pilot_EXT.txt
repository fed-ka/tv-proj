      A handwritten sign above the words "History Class" reads
      "People's."  Muffled ranting can be heard through the window,
      as well as the sound of someone trying to open a locked door.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Ben's house is a modest, one-level ranch in a rundown
      neighborhood.  On the lawn three silhouettes are throwing
      rolls of toilet paper into the trees.


      The front door snaps open and Ben emerges in just slippers
      and tight white underwear. 

                                    BEN
                    What are you little ingrates doing
                    out here?!

      Three kids are trying to rip up his mailbox.  Ben looks down
      and notices a flaming bag.

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    Damn it!  I know what's in this, but
                    I don't own a fire extinguisher.

      He starts stomping the bag.  Dog feces explodes all over his
      shins and slippers.  The three kids begin laughing and Ben
      gives chase.  The kids retreat, jumping into a convertible
      driven by Bryce Turner.

                                      BRYCE
                    Nice slippers, commie!

      They peel off, chanting Bryce's name.                                                                                    11.

                    Communism has great ideals; it's
                    been ruined by the greed...

                                      NEIGHBOR (O.S.)
                    Shut the hell up, Shoemaker!  Some
                    of us are trying to sleep.

                                    BEN
                    Our rights as homeowners are being
                    violated!

                                      NEIGHBOR (O.S.)
                    Fuck you!

                                    BEN
                    Fuck you!


      Ben's beat up mid-90's Toyota Tercel pulls up to a group of
      black kids standing on a corner.  Outdated rap is blaring
      from the car stereo. Milo is in the back seat.


      Ben exits the car and begins making his way to the group.

                                    BEN
                    What up, bloodclot?

      The group looks confused.

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    Peep this: my boy and I are out
                    trolling for some of that candy to
                    bring back to my Nubian queen.  You
                    got a line on some of that New Jack
                    shit?                                                                                    17.

                                      STREET KID #1
                    Huh?

                                    BEN
                    You know.  That sick shit.  That
                    stuff that make you mad foul.

                                      STREET KID #1
                    Are you a cop?

                                    BEN
                    No, I'm a teacher.

                                      STREET KID #2
                    Awww, shit.

      Everyone exhales and relaxes.

                                      STREET KID #2 (CONT'D)
                    We give you sad fools a discount.
                    What you need: Lithium, Ritalin,
                    Xanax?

                                    BEN
                    What could get me in the most trouble?

                                      STREET KID #3
                    This guy's freakin' me out, man.

                                    BEN
                    Heroin.  Do you have heroin?

                                      STREET KID #1
                    Fifty bucks!

                                    BEN
                    Damn!  Wow.  Hold on.

      Ben walks back to the car and leans in Milo's window.

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    Hey, let me borrow $15.  I'll get
                    you back.  I need this.

      Milo licks his thumb and counts out the money from a large
      roll of cash.  Ben returns to the group and starts counting
      out the money.  All the corner kids are staring at him.

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    Fifteen, Twenty.  What?  Oh, this
                    isn't for him...

      Ben gestures to Milo.                                                                                    18.

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    It's for another kid. 

      Ben hands the cash over and the kid hands him three small
      balloons.

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    Thanks a lot.  I really appreciate
                    this.  You guys be safe. 

      Ben starts walking back to the car.

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    And remember to keep reading.  The
                    most dangerous thing in the world is
                      a teenager who arms this weapon...

      Ben taps on his temple.  He climbs in the car and squeals
      off.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      School buses are pulling up in front of the school.


      The thugs that Ben bought the heroin from are taking turns
      pummeling Bryce.

                                      BRYCE
                    Do you know who my dad is?!

                                      STREET KID #1
                    I don't even know who my dad is.

                                                                                  CUT TO:
