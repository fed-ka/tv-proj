KRIIINK KRONK - a metal grinding noise is heard outside.
KRIIINK KRONK - the noise becomes regular.
In the darkness we discover a room hardly furnished. The
withered and yellowed wallpaper flaps slowly in the draft.
On the dresser, dozens of empty liquor bottles.
KRIIINK KRONK - On the bed, THE OLD GAS STATION ATTENDANT
lays with his back to the window.
KRIIINK KRONK - The noise outside continues steadily without
disturbing his sleep.
KRIIINK KRONK - Suddenly, the old man wakes up short of
breath and looks around trying to locate the noise.
KRIIINK KRONK - He looks through the shutters, then quickly
puts on the top of his gas station overalls. He grabs a
SHOTGUN, loading it swiftly.
KRIIINK KRONK - The metal grinding noise increases as we move
towards the gas station door.
The door opens and the old man walks out holding his gun.
Nobody. Silence has returned. The metal grinding is gone.
The lever from the water well still moves. IT'S JUST BEEN
USED!
Hidden behind the house someone or something observes the old
station attendant walking slowly to the well.
DRIP... DRIP... DRIP...- water falls on the palm of his hand.
Worried, the old man scans the surroundings.
HE IS NOT ALONE.
OLD GAS ATTENDANT
Ruby? Is that you?! Ruby?
The sun is already high above, the heat waves shimmering over
the desert.
The old gas station attendant moves away from the road
towards the hills.

He stops by a broken fence which is bent halfway to the
ground. On a rusty sign next to an atomic symbol, we can
READ:
MILITARY ZONE - NO TRESPASSING - RISK OF RADIATION
OLD GAS ATTENDANT (CONT'D)
(towards the hills)
RUBY! RU-BY!
On the side of the hill,-THE ENTRANCE TO A CONDEMNED
NINETEENTH CENTURY MINE.
He approaches the mine and looks through the wooden planks
barring its entrance.
OLD GAS ATTENDANT (CONT'D)
RUBY?
His echo is the only sound that can be heard from the
depths...
He aims the shotgun, ready to open fire.
OLD GAS ATTENDANT (CONT'D)
IF THAT'S YOU JUPITER, I GOT A
BUCKSHOT FOR YA... YOU HEAR ME?!
Behind the gas station, someone observes the old man coming
back to the house.
AN EXPENSIVE LEATHER BAG was placed in front of his door
during his absence.
The old man looks-around terrified.
Diligently, he enters the house leaving the bag on the
ground.
On second thought, the door reopens and the bag is dragged
inside.
The shutters are all closed leaving the station in darkness.
The old man throws the leather bag on the dining table and
sets down the shotgun.
He takes a cigar from an ashtray and lights it. He grabs a
whisky bottle.

7 CONTINUED : 7
After a solid gulp, he turns on a bare light-bulb hanging
over the table, and stares at the bag in silence. One more
swig for courage, and the old man empties the bag on the
TABLE-
Jewels, a Swiss watch, a DV Cam, glasses, several cell
phones, a pager, loose cash, credit cards, a wallet...
.A FEW GOLD TEETH, AND AN EAR ON WHICH HANG GOLD EARRINGS.
He grabs the wallet and pulls out a photo already sticking
out.
On the bent picture, we see a young couple kissing. The young
woman wears the same earrings found on the severed ear...
The old man heaves a sigh before putting the wad of cash in
his pocket. Outside, a voice is heard.
MAN (O.S.)
SOMEONE THERE?!
The voice is followed by a car horn.
The old man quickly gathers the objects from the table
returning them to the bag.
Inside the trailer home, DOUG BUKOWSKI, 32, Lynn's husband,
tries to fix the broken A/C.
His glasses and white oxford shirt drenched in sweat, Doug is
totally out of his element. This is a guy who has never been
out of the city.
Using a Phillips screwdriver, he forcibly removes the front
grill to access the mechanism.
The heat and incessant BARKING wear on Doug's nerves.
DOUG
Piece of shit! Why couldn't we fly
like normal people?
LYNN
Relax Doug, please. It's their
silver anniversary and they're so
happy you're here.
DOUG
Please, your parents can't stand
me.
LYNN
You're wrong. They love you.

DOUG
We could have taken them on a
cruise.
LYNN
Yeah, that's a great idea. Why
didn't you plan it?
DOUG
What's that supposed to mean?
LYNN
Never mind.
Lynn grabs the milk bottle from its heater.
DOUG
Maybe I shouldn't have even come.
LYNN
Doug, please stop. I never ask you
for anything, OK?
(she looks at the baby)
Well see how happy you are when
Catherine comes along on our 25th
anniversary.
She walks out.
DOUG
(TO HIMSELF)
It won't be in a shitty trailer
home-that's for sure.
LYNN (O.S.)
I heard that...
In the back seat, BRENDA, 17, sleeps against the window.
A twig tickles her nose.
Without opening her eyes, the young girl slaps her face as to
chase away a fly.
But the twig persists -
It's her little brother, BOBBY, 15, teasing her. Linkin Park
blasts through his iPod.
Lynn knocks on the window, interrupting his little game.

LYNN
If you want to use the restroom,
it's now or never.
Bobby removes his headphones and pushes Brenda.
BOBBY
Wake up, lard ass.
While they are talking outside, a DEFORMED HAND slides into
the back window of the SUV.
A HAND WITH ONLY THREE STRANGELY PROPORTIONED FINGERS.
It moves slowly, snatching BOBBY'S HOODED SWEATER from the
back seat.
SMALL VOICE (O.S.)
(WHISPERING)
.Annnnaaaaau...
Under the car the visitor's feet walk way. They are bare,
dirty and covered with dust.
Rays of light pass through the wooden planks.
The outhouse is so dirty that Bobby is forced to hold his
breath...
An EYE peeks between the wooden planks!
BOBBY JUMPS-
BOBBY
What the hell Brenda!
The eye goes away...
He re-zips looking outside. Nobody.
When he exits, Brenda appears on the other side.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
Freak.
She looks at him slightly confused...
BRENDA
What?
We see the scenery through the window blinds.
On a wall, photographs of other Carter vacations are
reminders of the good times spent in the trailer home.
The thermometer reads above 100 degrees. Sweating, Doug hangs
on while the camper bounces over the rough road.
Bobby works on the A/C. He has removed the face plate and
tries to fix the motor with the screwdriver.
DOUG
(cleaning his glasses)
I tried for an hour but I couldn't
get it cold in here.
CLICK- the light turns on and the A/C starts.
BOBBY
(PROUDLY)
There!
A breeze of cool air circulates through the trailer. On the
table, TWO PARAKEETS fly about their strapped-down cage.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
It was nothing... The thermostat
was disconnected.
He turns to Doug.
DOUG
How do you know all this stuff?
BOBBY
I don't know.
DOUG
Well, at least we can breathe now.

Bobby sets down the screwdriver under the sleeper and sits
next to the dogs. Doug grabs a cigarette.
BOBBY
I thought you stopped smoking?
(NO ANSWER)
Does my sister know?
DOUG
(lighting it with a
SMILE)
Fuck her!
BOBBY
(TEASING)
Big Bob would kill you if he knew
you were smoking in his "88
Airstream"...
DOUG
(PLAYING BACK)
Fuck him too. You want one?
Doug extends the pack. Bobby hesitates before reaching for
one, but Doug pulls the pack away at the last moment.
DOUG (CONT'D)
Yeah right, if you start smoking
your sister would cut my nuts off.
BOBBY
(after a pause)
It's cool that you came with us.
It's a drag when it's just us and
our parents...
DOUG
Hey, I like seeing your parents...
Bobby is surprised.
DOUG (CONT'D)
.in pictures!
Close up on the radio dial moving back and forth
unsuccessfully in search of air waves...
In the back seat, Brenda, annoyed, sits staring at the
passing scenery.
ETHEL
Don't drive so fast Bob, you might
lose the camper...
BRENDA
(TO HERSELF)
.this is fucked...
ETHEL
Hey... Watch your mouth, young
lady.

Will you please back me up here?
LYNN
(calming things down)
Relax, Mom. We're all just tired.

BRENDA
You grew up in the 60's. How can
you be so uptight?!
Still driving, Big Bob turns to his daughters-
BIG BOB
(SLYLY)
She wasn't like that before... You
should've seen her when she was
your age.
(to his wife)
Do you remember honey?
ETHEL
(PLAYFULLY)
Oh, stop it...
BIG BOB
She remembers...
Lynn finds her husband's jacket and stops when she sees a
cigarette butt in the sink. She's pissed. She picks it up and
throws it away.
A FLASH OF LIGHT catches her attention outside. She looks
through the kitchen blinds and spots the quick reflection of
light coming from the top of the hills when-
BOBBY JUMPS UP AT THE WINDOW SCREAMING!
Lynn falls back against.the kitchen table scared to death.
Bobby laughs, pleased with himself. Annoyed, Lynn shuts the
blinds in his face.
Catherine wakes up crying in her crib.
LYNN
Hey, little princess. Who doesn't
want to sleep anymore?
The baby looks at her mother, appeased.
LYNN (CONT'D)
Are you hungry, my angel?
Lynn picks her up and exits the trailer.
He appears between two big stones reaching an intermediate
zone before the top-
A type of NATURAL LABYRINTH formed in the rocks by years of
erosion.
BOBBY
Beauty? Beauty?
Bobby moves cautiously.
He picks up a big stone for protection-
A dangerous animal could be hiding behind any corner.
A SHADOW PASSES BEHIND HIM.. Bobby doesn't notice.
Anaaaaaau - A swift sound of breathing breaks the silence.
Bobby spins around, ready to strike.
(CONTINUED)

38 CONTINUED: 38
No one. Just the labyrinth formed in the mountain.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
Beauty?
Bobby is ready to give up when something attracts his
ATTENTION-
A THIN SHADOW ON THE GROUND. Someone or something is hiding
behind a rock.
Bobby freezes. He stares at the shadow. Who will make the
first move?
He makes the decision, creeping towards the shadow. Squeezing
the stone, he lifts his hand to strike but stops when he
DISCOVERS-
A YOUNG GIRL, ABOUT 14, WEARING HIS STOLEN SWEATSHIRT. She is
about five feet tall and frail.
The hood covers her head, partly hiding her face. She is
rather pretty, even with her ABNORMALLY LARGE EYES...
She trembles, frightened and intrigued by Bobby. What is this
girl doing in a place like this?
BOBBY (CONT'D)
Don't... Don't be scared. I won't
hurt you... What are you doing
here?
The girl keeps silent. Bobby drops the stone to the ground
but the young girl remains suspicious.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
So you're the one who took my
sweatshirt? Where did you find it?
The young girl smiles shyly. The ice is broken.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
What's your name?
The young girl hesitates and murmurs in a frail voice.
YOUNG GIRL
Ru... Ruby... Ruby...
(CONTINUED)
39.
38 CONTINUED: (2) 38
BOBBY
What are you doing here Ruby? Where
are your parents? My family needs
help. We had an accident.
Ruby repeats her name mechanically as if she doesn't
understand the questions.
RUBY
(in a low voice)
Ru... Ruby... Ruby...
Bobby gets closer.
BOBBY
I heard you, Ruby... Are you here
alone?
Ruby won't answer.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
Ruby... I'm looking for my dog...
Do you understand? My dog... her
name is Beauty... She's a German
Shepherd, about this high...
RUBY
Beauty...
BOBBY
That's right, have you seen her?
RUBY
Ruby.. _Ruby is Beauty...
The last sentence makes her laugh. A STRANGE AGONIZING
LAUGHTER.
BOBBY
Have you seen her?
Ruby looks down. She knows something.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
Look at me, Ruby... Look at me...
Where did you see my dog?
Ruby keeps looking to the ground. Bobby reaches under her
chin to raise her head.
Instinctively, Ruby SCREAMS as she backs off, lifting her
hands to protect herself.
(CONTINUED)
40.
38 CONTINUED: (3) 38
HER HANDS LOOK LIKE CLAWS. DEFORMED AND MISSING FINGERS, THEY
ARE NO LONGER HUMAN.
Frightened, Bobby takes a step back. The girl murmurs softly.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
What? I can't understand. What are
you saying?
He comes closer trying to make eye contact as she continues
to murmur the same thing. She too is terrified-
RUBY
(SOFTLY)
The hills... The hills have
eyes...The hills have eyes...The
hills have eyes...
Behind him, a small rock slide grabs his attention. He turns
his head. When he turns back to Ruby, she is gone.
BOBBY
Ruby, come back!
Once more, Bobby is alone in the labyrinth.
On the other side, he finds a trail of blood as if a body had
been dragged on the rocks.
The bloody trail is still fresh and disappears behind another
set of rocks a few feet away.
Bobby hesitates, unsure of what he might find...
As soon as he's around the outcropping to the other side
Bobby sees something that stops him dead in his tracks.
Before him, on the ground, is Beauty.
Dead. Disemboweled.
Bobby drops to his knees, disbelieving, his face turning
white. He touches the animal's head as if to convince himself
that this nightmare can't be possible at all. Beauty's face
is locked in a grimace of horrible pain and shock. And... the
animal is missing its front right leg.
DRIP... DRIP... DRIP... DROPS OF BLOOD fall on Bobby's hand -
ABOVE HIM, PERCHED ON A ROCK, A FIGURE OBSERVES HIM. A man
with an impressive build crouches like a monkey. He wears old
clothes covered with dust, and a DERBY HAT on his head.
Binoculars hang around his neck.
(CONTINUED)

38 CONTINUED: (4) 38
IT'S GOGGLE.
Goggle has no face, as if it were totally covered with wax.
He has two little holes for nostrils and no ears. His mouth
is like an opened wound sliced in his skin. His eyes are the
only features which give him any human resemblance at all.
Using his hand, Goggle devours something ferociously-
BEAUTY'S LEG!
Terrified, Bobby runs away.
Goggle laughs from his rock.
Bobby jumps down the hill.
From the summit, Goggle continues feasting. A few yards away,
Ruby's slender silhouette slides between the rocks. Goggle
stops eating, sees Ruby, and throws her the remains. Ruby
looks at the half-eaten leg in disgust, and pushes it away.
GOGGLE (O.S.)
(rough and deep)
What's the matter Ruby.. .You don't
like dog anymore?
Holding his gun, Big Bob steps into the empty gas station
store. A faint light comes from the back room. The wind blows
dust through the broken windows...
Vigilantly, he moves through the empty shelves, behind the
counter and past the beaded curtain separating the two rooms.
The light bulb above the dining table is on.
BIG BOB
Somebody home? Hello?
Big Bob pushes the last door leading to the back room.
His hand feels for the light switch.
CLICK - an old lamp comes on in the corner.
He finds a wall mounted phone and picks up the receiver.
No tone.
BIG BOB (CONT'D)
(TO HIMSELF)
Dammit...
Through the window, Big Bob sees a pick-up truck.
He starts searching for the keys.
Going through the different rooms, he discovers a drawer full
of money, jewels, watches, credit cards... A REAL FORTUNE.
He spots a key chain hanging from a nail next to the desk. He
reaches for the keys when something else grabs his attention-
Partially hidden in the dark, he discovers a few family
photos and a few newspaper clippings from the 1950s pinned to
the wallpaper.
Big Bob lights the desk lamp and turns it towards the wall-
His face goes cold-
On the aged photos, we recognize the old gas station
attendant in his younger days, next to his wife and his
CHILDREN-
(CONTINUED)

43 CONTINUED: 43
ABNORMAL CHILDREN GRUESOME AND DEFORMED BY NATURE...
Cleft lips, tumors, uneven extremities, malformations, skin
diseases, and gangrene of the face...
THEY ARE ALL AFFECTED BY GENETIC ABNORMALITIES.
On a more recent polaroid, we can recognize Ruby at 6 years
old. Besides her three fingers and big eyes, half of her
skull is missing or caved in.
Another polaroid - in a wheelchair, a little boy has
difficulty holding up his hugely disproportionate head.
The headline from the clippings makes Big Bob understand the
origins of these horrors-
"New Mexico- Nuclear enters a new age."
".. .Miner town evacuated"
"Miners refuse to abandon their lands by hiding in
MINES"
"Military destroys miner's town."
The old man's family was. one of those families whose genetic
lineage was forever changed by the nuclear fallout.
Big Bob is shocked, never believing such a thing was
possible.
A COUPLE OF MORE RECENT ARTICLES MENTION PEOPLE DISAPPEARING
IN THE REGION.
BIG BOB (CONT'D)
You son of a bitch...
Worried for his own family, he grabs the keys and walks out.
From the bedroom window, we see him running to the pick-up
truck.
Big Bob slams the door, starts the engine and turns on the
headlights.
The headlights shine on the outhouse.
The wooden outhouse door slams back and forth in the wind.
Something blocks it from shutting completely-

A FOOT STICKS OUT...
Big Bob exits the vehicle holding his gun and approaches.
A voice comes to him. A MAN SOBBING-
MAN (O.S.)
(through his tears)
JUPITER! I GOT BUCKSHOT... YOU
HEAR?
BIG BOB
(MOVING SLOWLY)
IS THAT YOU MISTER?
Big Bob kicks open the door revealing-
THE OLD GAS STATION ATTENDANT, IN TEARS, HOLDING HIS SHOTGUN
TIGHTLY, READY TO SHOOT AT ANYTHING... HE'S OBVIOUSLY DRUNK.
BIG BOB (CONT'D)
(aiming his gun at him)
PUT THAT WEAPON DOWN RIGHT NOW
MISTER!
The old man seems mad.
BIG BOB (CONT'D)
I SAID PUT THAT WEAPON DOWN!
OLD GAS ATTENDANT
(lifting his eyes to Big
BOB)
My wife... She didn't want to
leave ...she wouldn't move to town
even when the state police ordered
us to. The kids grew up in the
mines... Like animals...
(smiling through his
TEARS)
What kind of place is that for
children?
In a split second, the old man sets the shotgun under his
CHIN-
BIG BOB

Suddenly, VOICES coming from different directions echo around
him.
VOICES
Daddy... Daddy...Daaaddyyy...Daddy..
THE VOICES ARE HORRIFIC AND TERRIFYING. Big Bob backs up
pointing his gun in their direction.
VOICES (CONT'D)
Daaaaddyyy...Dad-dy...Dad-dy...
BIG BOB
Who's there?
VOICES
Dad-dy...Dad-dy...Daddy...Dad-dy...
Big Bob can't contain his fear and shoots blindly into the
darkness.
BIG BOB
Who's there? Show yourself!
The voices become louder and louder, omnipresent.
VOICES
Dad-dy...Dad-dy...Daaaddyyy...
Daddy.. Daddy...
Big Bob walks backwards to the truck, and trips on the
ground.
Wide eyed, he stands and throws himself on the car door.
Panicked, he enters the vehicle and turns the ignition.
As the engine turns over-
A DEEP VOICE RIGHT BEHIND HIM-
VOICE
(CALMLY)
..Daddy...
In a split second, Big Bob sees, in his rear view mirror, A
DARK HAIRY FIGURE WITH EVIL EYES IN THE BACKSEAT-
It's PAPA JUPITER.

Miles away, inside the trailer, Ethel washes dishes while
dinner cooks on the stove.
SUDDENLY THE RED LIGHT ON THE C/B TURNS ON AND THE RADIO
SQUAWKS TO LIFE, DISRUPTING THE SILENCE.
She wipes her hands on her apron and site down next to the
radio.

Suddenly, the light on the C/B turns green and static can be
heard. Ethel grabs her daughter's hand, hopeful that someone
may have heard them.
A second later, HEAVY BREATHING is heard over the radio.
The light turns off. The two women look at each other in
confusion.
LYNN (CONT'D)
What was that?
ETHEL
It sounded like an animal...
Lynn stands up worried.
LYNN
If animals start answering our
radio calls, we're really fucked!
ETHEL

LYNN
Give it a rest, Mom. We have more
important things to worry about.
She walks out.
ETHEL
Lynn, wait.
Ethel stays alone with the baby.

Inside the trailer-
The first aid kit is open on the table. Even with a blanket
around his shoulders, Bobby shivers.
Ethel soaks cotton in alcohol using it to clean his wounds.
ETHEL
You're lucky Brenda found you.
Imagine if you had to spend the
whole night out there in the cold.
Bobby winces from the pain.
BRENDA
Don't worry, Beauty will come back

Bobby doesn't answer. He keeps the truth to himself, not
wanting to worry his family.
BOBBY

His mother and two sisters are surprised by his agitated
behavior.

What's wrong with you?
Footsteps. Someone approaches.
BOBBY

I want you guys to stay in here.
Brenda?! You hear me?
Gun in hand, he opens the door-
Bobby is about to shoot when a figure emerges from the dark.
IT'S DOUG, holding as much as he could carry from the car
graveyard.
DOUG
What the fuck are you doing? Don't

Bobby lowers the weapon.

arms. They kiss.
Doug sets down all of his findings.
DOUG (CONT'D)
Look what I found.
Various tools, a fishing pole...
DOUG (CONT'D)
With all of this, we can find a way
to fix the car, right Bobby?
Bobby doesn't answer.
DOUG (CONT'D)
I found this really huge crater at
the end of the road! I've never
seen anything like it! People must
use it as a dump site. It was full
of all this garbage...

POLE)
Look at this, it's brand new!
LYNN
What are you going to do with a
fishing pole in the desert? You

DOUG
No. The road just stops there. I
hope your dad has better luck.
Is there anything to eat? I'm

At the top of the hill, Beast has found what's left of
Beauty's mutilated body and whines as he licks her face.

Bobby double bolts the lock on the door. Behind him, Lynn
comes out of the bathroom, while Doug has just changed
Catherine.
LYNN
Don't close the door, we're leaving

Where are you going? You don't want

DOUG
I'm tired, I really need to rest

BOBBY
We can squeeze in here. You'll be
more comfortable.
DOUG
You want us to sleep on the floor?!
Doug kisses Catherine and hands her to Brenda so she can put

Bobby takes him aside.

Lynn, holding a blanket and pillows, joins him. They exit
together hand in hand.
DOUG (CONT'D)
(FROM OUTSIDE)
If he's not back by midnight, we'll
go get him. Deal?
Bobby hates himself for not saying anything. He bolts the
door shut and stands facing it.
Behind him, Brenda sets the baby in her crib and starts a
FISHER PRICE MOBILE hanging above, setting off the music and
rocking the baby to sleep.
She disappears in the bathroom for a moment and comes out in
t-shirt and panties. She turns to her brother-
BRENDA
Can I listen to your iPod?
Bobby is still focused on the door.
BOBBY
What?
BRENDA
Can I borrow your iPod?
BOBBY

Whatever...
Brenda grabs it and cranks the volume. she starts swaying to
the music, unaware of the dangers lurking about.

Perfect. God, I feel like I crossed
New Mexico on foot.
Amused, Lynn squeezes his legs a bit harder. She moves up to
his love handles.

bad for these guys, right?
Doug laughs and giggles.
DOUG
Stop! Stop, you're tickling me!
Lynn continues with more fervor.

Oh, so you want to play?
He turns around and starts tickling her as well. They laugh

LYNN
I love you...
DOUG

They start making out.
Brenda rests on her bed. Exhausted, she turns off the bed
lamp,. and slides under the sheets. She falls asleep listening
to the music.
In the other room of the trailer, Bobby's watch reads
11:45pm. Bobby is restless. He doesn't know what to do.
A few feet away, Ethel sleeps on the couch.
Suddenly, Bobby hears barking in the distance.
BOBBY
Beast?!
He grabs the gun and exits the trailer, leaving the door
open.
In the living room, Ethel sleeps.
At the other end, Brenda turns under the sheets. The muted
bass coming from the iPod drums on in the background.
A GNARLED HAND ENTERS FRAME AND BRUSHES A STRAND OF HAIR FROM
BRENDA'S FACE SO STEALTHILY THAT SHE DOESN'T EVEN STIR.
IT'S PLUTO. THE DIVERSION OUTSIDE HAS ALLOWED HIM TO ENTER.
He stands above Brenda watching her sleep, an innocent smile
on his face. His hand softly grazes her hair as if she was a
kitten, then pulls on the sheets to expose her body.
Pluto covers her mouth, silencing her. BRENDA'S EYES OPEN
WIDE.
From the window, we can see Bobby and Doug walking to the
trailer.
In the back room, Pluto hears them, grabs his walkie-talkie
AND GROWLS-
PLUTO
Noaowww!
Doug runs into the trailer grabbing a fire extinguisher and
some blankets. In the panic, he fails to see Brenda
restrained by Pluto.
DOUG
(PANICKED)
Brenda, stay with Catherine!
He jumps out without waiting for an answer.
Pluto gives Brenda a satisfied smile- NO ONE WILL BOTHER THEM
NOW.
Back inside the trailer.

72 CONTINUED: 72
With a wicked smile on his face, Lizard puts on Ethel's apron
and places her flowery sun hat on his head. This disturbed
mind takes pleasure in dressing up in "Mama's clothes"...
Then, famished, he eats everything he can find in the
trailer.
Raw meat, fruit, potato chips... He washes it all down with
milk, orange juice...
His eyes stop on the bird cage. He smiles.
Lizard moves closer, opens the cage and grabs one of the
parrakeets.
The small bird looks around in confusion.
HE TEARS OFF ITS HEAD AND SQUEEZES THE BLOOD INTO HIS MOUTH!
Blood drips on his chin.
Brenda's muted screams attract his attention.
Lizard walks across the trailer. HE WANTS HIS SHARE.
He pushes Pluto violently to the ground.
LIZARD
Move!
(with a smile)
You gotta be a man to do that...
Pluto is outraged and tries to stand up. He wants to talk but
no words come out. JUST GRUNTS AND GROWLS.
Lizard savagely hits him several times.
Behind them, terrified, Brenda watches helplessly as they
fight.
Lizard puts his foot on Pluto's face, pinning him to the
ground, and then points the gun to his head.
LIZARD (CONT'D)
I told ya to move!
Pluto moves away and, in a fit of rage, breaks everything in
the trailer. Dishes, chairs, table... everything.
Lizard laughs like a goon. He grabs Brenda by her feet and
pulls her to him.
(CONTINUED)
65.
72 CONTINUED: (2) 72
Excited and amused at the same time, he stares at Brenda's
appetizing calf muscle. He smells it, licks it, and then,
without hesitation, plunges his teeth into her leg.
Bursting into the trailer, Lynn stops on a dime when she sees
Lizard, in Ethel's clothes, holding the baby.
Behind him, Pluto restrains Brenda.
Lizard walks up with the baby.
LIZARD
(EVIL)
Big fat baby good.., you fat... Fat
and juicy!
Lynn is paralyzed with fear.
Lizard imitates a mother cradling her baby.
LIZARD (CONT'D)
Baby... Baby...
Instinctively, Lynn grabs the closest thing, a FRYING PAN,
and hits Lizard brutally in the face.
(CONTINUED)
67.
76 CONTINUED: 76
Stunned, he falls to the ground and drops the baby, who
begins to wail.
when he lifts his head, Lynn strikes again-
He blocks her arm and twists it, bringing her to her knees.
Lynn tries to fight him off, but he is too strong.
Still restrained, Brenda spots the PHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER under
the sleeper. The one Bobby had used to fix the A/C.
At the other end of the trailer, Lizard has immobilized Lynn
and POINTS THE GUN AT THE BABY!
Lynn stops.
LYNN
(PANTING)
No...No...Please... Please don't...
Without a word, Lizard tears off Lynn's shirt and bra.
The gun stays pointed at the baby as-
Lizard removes Ethel's sun hat and hovers over Lynn's
breast...
Seen from behind her shoulder, we can't figure out exactly
what this mental case is doing... Is he nursing from her
breast?
Lynn trembles, but can only think of her baby and her sister,
who are still threatened.
Excited by what his brother is doing, Pluto fondles Brenda.
Suddenly, Ethel jumps into the trailer with a broom and
starts batting away at Lizard.
For once, her adrenaline kicks in as she fights for the most
important thing in her life - Her family.
The broom has little effect and is almost comical...
BANG! - Lizard shoots Ethel in her chest, throwing her back.
In the trailer home, Brenda takes advantage of the confusion
to get away from Pluto and grabs the Phillips screwdriver
from beneath the sleeper.
Brenda slides the screwdriver to Lynn who raises it and is
about to strike when-
BANG! - Lynn is shot in the chest.
Lizard turns to Brenda and aims at her head.
He is about to shoot when Lynn, with her last breath-
PLANTS THE PHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER IN HIS THIGH. IT STARTS
TEARING THROUGH HIS FLESH!
Lizard screams in pain and turns the gun back to Lynn-
BANG! - He blows off part of her skull.
Blood splatters throughout the cabin.
Witness to the slaughter, Brenda is petrified with fear.
Lizard pulls out the screwdriver and stands with difficulty.
He picks up the baby and hands it to Pluto.
LIZARD
Take it.
Pluto obeys. Lizard grabs Brenda by the hair and pulls her
out of the trailer.

80 CONTINUED: 80
LIZARD (CONT'D)
Come on bitch...
She screams and resists by grabbing at furniture and pulling
off the curtains...
Her nails scratch against the paneling.
BEFORE LEAVING, LIZARD RIPS THE JEWELRY FROM ETHEL AND LYNN'S
BODY...
Doug enters the trailer unable to imagine the tragedy.
(CONTINUED)
70.
82 CONTINUED: 82
Horrified, he discovers Ethel on the couch, not quite dead,
but short of breath and in pain.
Doug is stone faced-
ON THE GROUND, LYNN'S BODY, HIS OWN WIFE, SOAKS IN HER BLOOD!
His eyes fill with tears. He tries to keep from crying but
his sadness is too deep.
His hand approaches her face. His fingers graze her hair.
SUDDENLY, LYNN'S BODY SUFFERS A LAST MUSCLE SPASM, LIKE A
CIRCUIT SHORTING OUT.
Doug tries to breathe life back into her body, but death has
overtaken her open eyes. He closes them and starts weeping.
The music from the Fisher Price mobile is the only other
sound...
Doug turns around. THE CRIB IS EMPTY...
DOUG
(SOFTLY)
No...No...
He squeezes his fist with rage.
Laid out on the couch, Ethel agonizes between life and death.
Brenda stares into space, saying nothing. Doug touches her
head as he passes. Instinctively, she backs off terrified.
Across the trailer, Bobby paces back and forth.
BOBBY
(PANICKED)
What are we going to do Doug? What
are we going to do if they come
back?
Completely defeated, Doug comes back and goes to Ethel's
side.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
Doug!
Doug does not answer and takes Ethel's hand. She opens her
eyes and looks at him as if nothing happened.
ETHEL
This camper's so small. No matter
how much you clean, it's always a
mess.
(CONTINUED)
72.
85 CONTINUED: 85
Doug nods in silence.
ETHEL (CONT'D)
Is Big Bob home?
DOUG
Not yet.
ETHEL
Did everyone go to bed?
DOUG
Yes, Brenda is here and Bobby is in
the kitchen.
At the other end, Bobby turns away, crying. Brenda looks away
as well.
ETHEL
(short of breath)
Is Lynn sleeping?
Doug holds back the tears.
DOUG
Yes..
(after a beat)
Do you need anything?
Ethel finds it more and more difficult to talk.
ETHEL
Look in the closet Doug, I'm sure I
have another blanket. I'm so cold.
Doug tucks one of the blankets around her.
DOUG
(REASSURING)
There's one here. Nice and warm.
ETHEL
You've always been so sweet. I
understand why Lynn loves you so
much.
She raises her arm to caress his face.
Her hand falls on the bed. Lifeless.
Brenda screams, bursting into tears.
(CONTINUED)
73.
85 CONTINUED: (2) 85
At the same time Bobby pounds his fist against a wall. His
eyes full of hate, he joins Doug.
BOBBY
(DETERMINED)
Come on! I'm not going to take this
shit...
Doug gets mad as well.
DOUG
DON'T BE STUPID! WE'RE NOT GOING
ANYWHERE, DO YOU HEAR ME?
BOBBY
Fine. You stay here. I'm going
after them.
Doug gets between Bobby and the door, preventing the kid from
leaving.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
Let me go!
DOUG
You want to die, too?
BOBBY
I don't care.
Doug drags him in front of his mother's body.
DOUG
Look! Look at what they did to your
mother. Look at what they did to
your sister.
He slams Bobby against the door.
DOUG (CONT'D)
You're not a fucking child,
alright? Think before you do
something stupid. You won't make it
three feet! We need a plan, OK? We
need to think...
BOBBY
Think about what? They have
Catherine, Doug...
Doug remains silent...
(CONTINUED)
74.
85 CONTINUED: ( 3) 85
BOBBY (CONT'D)
THEY HAVE CATHERINE... You know what
they could to do to her, and you're
not going to stop them?! You're
just a coward...
Doug jumps back on Bobby grabbing him by the collar.
DOUG
(ENRAGED)
STOP IT! SHUT UP! JUST SHUT YOUR
FUCKING MOUTH!
A MUFFLED SOUND COMES FROM OUTSIDE!
They all freeze.
Doug releases Bobby and immediately turns off the light.
Plunged in darkness, Brenda panics again-
BRENDA
No.. No... don't turn it off!
(HYSTERICAL)
He swore he'd come back to get me.
He swore it. Don't let him take me,
Bobby!
Outside, another noise, AND A SHADOW PASSES BACKLIT BY THE
CAMPFIRE!
BRENDA (CONT'D)
(TERRIFIED)
THEY'RE HERE... THEY'RE BACK... I
DON'T WANT TO DIE BOBBY...I DON'T
WANT TO DIE...DO SOMETHING...
Bobby picks up the gun-
BANG! BANG! BANG! - With no hesitation, he shoots through the
door.
Brenda throws herself into Doug's arms.
Bobby stares at the bullet holes in the trailer door.
Suddenly, the sound of a radio is heard-
RADIO (O.S.)
"Goggle, you copy? Goggle..."
Bobby and Doug look at each other confused.
(CONTINUED)
75.
/ 85 CONTINUED: (4) 85
RADIO (O.S.) (CONT'D)
"Goggle?"
Doug silently moves closer to the door.
From outside we can see Doug's eye through one of the bullet
holes. Nobody, everything seems quiet.
DOUG
Get ready Bobby..
Doug opens the door and jumps out ready to fight.
From beneath the trailer, someone observes him...
Doug bends down and discovers-
GOGGLE'S SEVERED ARM. In its hand, the walkie-talkie still
works.
RADIO (O.S.)
"Goggle? Goggle?"
Doug grabs the radio. It's dripping with blood.
Bobby is about to join him when Doug signals-
THERE'S SOMEONE HIDING UNDER THE TRAILER.
Without a sound, Bobby aims the gun at the kitchen floor.
Outside, Doug backs up to see who is hiding.
Behind the step ladder, he sees an inert shape in the
shadows.
BANG! - Bobby shoots through the floor. Immediately, the
shadowy figure jumps out into the light-
DOUG
Beast!
The dog jumps into Doug's arms and begins licking his face.
Bobby can't believe it, his dog has returned.
Radio static comes back on the walkie. Bobby picks it up-
RADIO (O.S.)
"Papa Jupe... Goggle is dead. I
found him in the rocks..."
"Dead?"
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
76.
85 CONTINUED: (5) 85
RADIO (O.S.) (CONT'D)
"They got him. He's all torn
up..."
Bobby is proud of Beast. Still in the trailer, Brenda looks
at them, not as hopeful.
BOBBY
Good boy.. That's a good dog.
PAPA DUPE/RADIO (O.S.)
"I'm gonna take care of those
bastards myself"...
Bobby exchanges a worried glance with Doug. Even though
neither of the two has yet met Papa Jupe, something in his
voice tells them that it's only going to get worse.
Doug grabs the radio-
DOUG
(in the radio)
WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT? WHY ARE
YOU DOING THIS TO US?!
No answer. Just static.
DOUG (CONT'D)
ANSWER ME! WHY US?!
(IN DESPERATION)
Give me back my little girl... Give
her back to me...
More static...
DOUG (CONT'D)
DO YOU HEAR ME?!
Silence. Suddenly we hear-
CATHERINE'S CRIES ON THE RADIO!
Doug drops the radio, scared speechless...
DOUG (CONT'D)
How much ammo do you have left?
BOBBY
I don't know, half a clip?
CUT TO:
77.
On a dimly lit wooden table, Catherine lays, wrapped in a
blanket.
A butcher's knife is planted next to her...
Asthmatic breathing, and the sound of running water punctuate
the silence.
Ruby steps out of the darkness and moves towards the baby.
She watches through her abnormally large eyes and extends her
stringy fingers to touch the baby.
A large screen splits the room in two.
A strangely shaped shadow moves behind the screen: A
HANDICAPPED BODY washed by A LARGE WOMAN...
An empty wheel chair rests in a corner.
Amused, Ruby looks at the baby who smiles back. She carefully
takes Catherine in her arms when the invalid's voice
INTERRUPTS-
LARGE WOMAN (O.S.)
Put that down Ruby... You know
better than to play with your
food...
Ruby takes a step back, hugging the baby tighter.
- RUBY
Mama, pleaaase...
HANDICAPPED (O.S.)
(weak asthmatic voice)
Listen to your mother Ruby and put
that baby down... Now!
Frightened, Ruby obeys and quickly runs out of the room.
The baby starts crying...
CUT TO:
Brenda sits by the C/B and retries the SOS calls.
(CONTINUED)

87 CONTINUED: 87
BRENDA
Mayday... Mayday... We need help
..Mayday... Mayday... can anybody
hear me?
Something has gone off in her eyes. She is absent, no longer
living, just surviving.
Doug is about to leave, taking with him anything from the
trailer which might be useful.
BASEBALL BAT, FLASHLIGHT, PHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER...
BOBBY
Let me go with you.
DOUG
No, you stay here with your sister
and stay by the radio. Somebody's
bound to hear us.
Brenda continues her distress call.
BRENDA
Mayday...mayday... Can anybody hear
me?
DOUG
(TO BOBBY)
The sun'll be up soon. One of them
is hurt, I'm going to follow his
trail through the hills.
Bobby pulls out the 9mm gun and hands it to him.
DOUG (CONT'D)
No. You keep it in case they come
back.
BOBBY
What about you?
DOUG
Don't worry about me, I'll take
Beast.
Beast sits at his feet ready to go. Doug straps the walkie-
talkie over his shoulder.
BOBBY
Doug?
(CONTINUED)
79.
87 CONTINUED: (2) 87
DOUG
Yes?
BOBBY
I... I didn't mean what I said...
Doug hugs him like a brother.
Before walking out, he bends down to Lynn's body and kisses
her one last time on the mouth.
DOUG
I'm going to find.our baby my
love...I promise.
CUT TO:
With the light from the entrance behind him, shadow enters
the mine.
The beam from his flashlight follows the trail of blood on
the ground.
The wooden pylons which have held up the walls for a hundred
years threaten to crumble at any second.
Only static on the radio. Doug turns it off.
He moves further into the darkness, probing with his
flashlight into the inky pit.
Doug arrives at a fork splitting the tunnel off in two
different directions.
Doug lights each tunnel with the flashlight until he finds
the one with-the blood trail, then continues on into that
one. Tracking.
Suddenly he stops.
The beam of the flashlight has revealed TWO DOZEN PICKAXES
that have been planted in the ground over mounds. That look
very much like graves. The pickaxes look eerily like crosses,
given the whole place the feel of A SUBTERRANEAN GRAVEYARD.
Hanging from the graves, dates and portraits of all the
miners who have died here, including women and children...
The flashlight dims. Doug taps it to no avail.
(CONTINUED)
81.
90 CONTINUED: 90
DOUG
Come on. You can't be serious.
Then light goes. completely off, leaving Doug in darkness.
Scratch! - He lights a match.
Holding the tiny flame, Doug continues down the tunnel until
he arrives at another fork. He can no longer see the blood
trail.
A SHAPE SLIDES SWIFTLY BEHIND HIM!
DOUG (CONT'D)
(to Beast, meaning
HIMSELF)
Just stay calm, boy...
A gust of air kills the match.
He immediately lights another-
Again, THE DRAFT SNUFFS IT OUT.
He turns around, looking for the source of the air, and
notices a reflection of light at the end of the tunnel.
He moves towards the reflection.
91 EST. MINE EXIT - DAY 91
On the other side of the hill, the collapsed wooden beams and
stones block part of the mine's exit.
Doug emerges with Beast. His eyes takes a moment to adapt to
the bright sunlight.
He. cannot believe what he sees. At the bottom of a hill, A
SMALL TOWN - A CLASSIC ONE-STREET TOWN BUILT BACK IN THE
50'S.
Doug turns the walkie on.
DOUG
(ENTHUSIASTIC)
.Bobby, Bobby, it's Doug... I
can't believe it! I found a street
and some houses. Maybe somebody
does live here...
The radio remains silent.
(CONTINUED)
82.
91 CONTINUED: 91
DOUG (CONT'D)
Bobby, do you hear me? Bobby?
Still nothing. Doug turns around and looks up-
A wall of rock towers behind him.
He tries one last time, but the signal won't go through.
Close up on the C/B radio in the trailer-
Only static comes from the speakers.
Sunlight passes through the dusty windows revealing a
living/dining room decorated from the 50's.
Doug can't believe his eyes-
Through the kitchen door, he can see a woman doing dishes.
A man sits in the living room reading a newspaper.
Children play in front of the blank TV set...
THESE ARE NOT REAL PEOPLE BUT MANNEQUINS!
They have been dressed and placed into real life situations.
THE ATOMIC SYMBOL CAN BE FOUND ON EACH OF THEIR FOREHEADS.
Doug spots a telephone behind the staircase and checks for a
dial tone.
Nothing. He picks up the phone casing.
EMPTY. JUST LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE HOUSE, IT'S FARE.
84.
New interior- New surreal setting.
Around a table, a family of test dummies eat dinner.
Doug crosses a doorway without making a sound. He enters the
front hall squeezing the bat in his hands.
Something in the air, A DISGUSTING SMELL, catches his
attention. Doug moves slowly and discovers, in the dining
room, sitting amongst the dummies-
BIG BOB'S CHARRED BODY!
His father-in-law's arms have been torn off and devoured. THE
AMERICAN FLAG that used to adorn his SUV is planted THROUGH
HIS FOREHEAD!
Doug approaches terrified.
BEHIND HIM A WEAK AND ASTHMATIC VOICE BEGINS TO SING THE
NATIONAL ANTHEM-
VOICE (O.S.)
"Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's
early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the
twilight's last gleaming?"
Doug jumps and quickly lifts the baseball bat, ready to
swing.
Nobody. Just the fake living room filled with inert dummies.
No trace of his baby. An electrical fan turns in a corner,
close to a shelve full of old books...
Doug moves forward, gripping the bat tightly.
VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
(feeble and asthmatic)
"...Whose broad stripes and bright
stars, through the perilous
fight..."
He can hear his own heart beat as he searches through the
house. In another room, close to the window and in the
shadows, he sees someone sitting in a wheelchair.
(CONTINUED)
87.
102 CONTINUED: 102
VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
"...And the rockets' red glare, the
bombs bursting in air..."
Doug gets closer-
A ray of light shines on the skull of whoever sits in the
wheel chair.
The wheel chair moves forward revealing a most horrific sight-
BIG BRAIN - We recognize the handicapped man whom we have
seen before, bathing behind the screen. Big Brain's body is
skeletal. He was born with a genetic disease giving him a
head ten times bigger than his face. A head so heavy, he is
unable to hold it up. It rests back on his chair, forcing him
to stretch his eyes to see from side to side.
Big Brain is maybe the most representative character of the
damage done by nuclear fallout in this area.
Doug threatens him with the baseball bat-
DOUG
Where's my baby! Where's
Catherine?!
Big Brain does not answer.
DOUG (CONT'D)
What did you do with her?
BIG BRAIN
(MURMURING)
..Nothing..
Doug is beyond his breaking point -
DOUG
Where is she then? ANSWER ME!
He raises the bat.
BIG BRAIN
(weak and asthmatic)
.I don't know where she is. I
never leave this place...
Big Brain moves away from the window wheeling himself to the
couch. His hands are thin and pale, like a child's.
(CONTINUED)
88.
102 CONTINUED: (2) 102
BIG BRAIN (CONT'D)
..You should've read the signs
before taking that road...
DOUG
What signs?!
BIG BRAIN
(SMILING)
Boom. .. Boom... Boom
DOUG
What the hell are you saying?!
BIG BRAIN
(weak and asthmatic)
You people settled on our lands,
you destroyed our homes, destroyed
our silver mines. . .You 'ye made us
what we've become!
One day my father went into town
begging for your help, and you know
what the doctors did? They
sterilized him like a dog!
You thought that in the desert no
one would see anything, or say
anything, but the hills... The
hills never forget...
BOOM...BOOM...B000M!
DOUG
I don't know what you're talking
about. All I want is my daughter.
Please...
Big Brain remains silent.
DOUG (CONT'D)
What do you want? Money? I can give
you money... WHAT DO YOU WANT?
BIG BRAIN
Maybe a trailer? Yeah, a pretty
trailer, just like yours.
DOUG
Where are the others? Where is my
baby?
Big brain starts laughing a high pitched sound.
(CONTINUED)
89.
102 CONTINUED: ( 3) 102
DOUG (CONT'D)
What? What's so funny?
BIG BRAIN
IT'S BREAKFAST TIME!
At the same moment-
CRASH - PLUTO, THE DEFORMED BALD GIANT, PULVERIZES THE DOOR
WITH AN AXE AND SMASHES INTO THE HOUSE!
Like a wild animal, Pluto charges Doug, destroying everything
in his path.
Doug retreats in the living room, throwing the dummies at his
assailant.
The giant comes closer and closer.
Dummies are chopped into pieces.
Doug dodges away and tries to escape, using the stairs in the
hallway but the giant grabs him by the feet and pulls him
down...
The axe swings through the air missing him by a hair each
time.
Sensing his master is in trouble, Beast jumps around inside
the car trying to find an exit...
The passenger window opening is too small for him to break
out...
Doug runs into another room, escaping from Pluto and his axe.
Instinctively, he uses the first piece of furniture he can
find, A CHEST, to block the door behind him. He looks
desperately for an exit. No way out.
The axe penetrates through the door. The chest won't be
enough to hold back Pluto.
Second axe blow- This time the axe tears up the boards of the
door, allowing Pluto to stick his gruesome face inside.
Seeing Doug trapped in the room, the bald giant begins to
laugh stupidly before turning around and walking away.
(CONTINUED)
90.
104 CONTINUED: 104
The house is now silent. No sign of the giant.
With his heart pounding through his chest and the baseball
bat in hand, Doug moves towards the half-broken door,.
CRASH! - PLUTO EXPLODES THROUGH THE WALL, LANDING ON TOP OF
DOUG!
Doug loses his bat but slides away before the axe comes
swinging down.
Desperate, he picks up the bat and uses it as a shield. The
axe splits it in half.
Doug throws himself at Pluto plunging the splintered bat into
his abdomen.
The sharp piece of wood enters Pluto's stomach.
Completely out of his mind, Pluto removes the piece of wood
from his abdomen and beats Doug in the face with it, sending
him across the room.
Pluto lowers his head, charging Doug like a bull. Doug
crashes into one of the walls.
He can't even take a breath before the giant grabs him by the
leg like a rag doll and throws him through a wall.
Doug falls to the ground in the living room. Wounded and
exhausted, he is also defenseless. He has lost his glasses.
Not far away, Big Brain savors the spectacle.
The giant walks to him spinning the axe in his hand like a
baton.
His foot crushes Doug's glasses on the floor.
The axe swings through the air. Doug jumps out of the way.
ANOTHER SWING-
THE AXE STRIKES INTO HIS LEFT HAND, CUTTING OFF SOME FINGERS!
Doug stares wide eyed at his amputated fingers and screams
with pain.
Blood is everywhere.
In an act of self preservation, Doug crawls under the table.
(CONTINUED)
91.
104 CONTINUED: (2) 104
Pluto destroys it with the axe and advances to finish him
off.
His asymmetrical eyes stare coldly-
Doug is at his mercy.
Pluto slowly caresses the axe's blade on his victims throat
and face.
The sharp blade moves dangerously across Doug's skin. Pluto
stops when he sees Doug holding his PHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER!
Pluto laughs like a dumb child at the feeble weapon. Behind
him, Big Brain joins in on the laughter-
Disfigured by his wounds, Doug is frozen with the screwdriver
pointed at the giant. He looks ridiculous and starts sobbing
like a terrorized child.
DOUG
Please, I'm begging you... Don't
kill me...
PLUTO
(making fun of him)
Loook at-t hiiis fa-ace... Loook at-
at hiiis fa-ace...
Even the frozen faces of the test dummies seem to mock him.
SUDDENLY-
Doug stops crying_instantly, it was a trick!
He turns the screwdriver around and slams it into Pluto's
foot.
The screwdriver goes through the shoe nailing Pluto to the
floor. Pluto screams in pain.
Doug rises and moves behind him. In a swift movement, Doug
takes the American flag from Big Bob's forehead, stabbing
Pluto in the back of the neck!
OLD GLORY'S STAFF COMES THROUGH HIS THROAT ON THE OTHER SIDE.
Pluto screams again, dropping the axe.
Outraged, Pluto tears the flag from his neck and turns to
Doug.
(CONTINUED)
92.
104 CONTINUED: (3) 104
PLUTO STOPS-
DOUG IS HOLDING THE AXE.
The blade swings through the air and slams into Pluto's
skull!
Pluto's eyes freeze and his body falls to the ground, his
skull half open. DOUG JUMPS ON TOP OF HIM. FULL OF RAGE, HE
MUTILATES PLUTO WITH THE AXE TO THE POINT OF EXHAUSTION.
Big Brain watches Pluto die without showing any emotion.
Silence returns to the destroyed house.
Doug tears off a piece of Pluto's shirt and uses it as a
BANDAGE for his hand...
He picks up his half broken shattered glasses on the floor
and put them back.
SLING! - Doug removes the bloody axe from the corpse. He
turns to Big Brain, who backs off-
BIG BRAIN
The baby... the baby is in the last
house on the left...
CUT TO:
From the broken window, Big Brain watches Doug walk away
down Main Street. He picks up a walkie-talkie hidden in his
WHEELCHAIR-
BIG BRAIN
Lizard... Kill the baby...
Lizard enters the house holding a MACHETE. The wound Lynn had
given him before she died still bleeds through his improvised
bandage.
He moves to the kitchen with a limp. There, he comes face to
face with Ruby. Behind her, the baby is wrapped inside a
blanket on the table.
The kitchen walls are covered with dry blood. Severed human
remains are scattered about and hanging like slabs of meat.
Ruby blocks his way-
LIZARD
Get out of the way Ruby...
(CONTINUED)
94.
108 CONTINUED: 108
Ruby refuses to let him pass. Lizard lifts the machete
threatening his little sister.
LIZARD (CONT'D)
I TOLD YOU TO MOVE. NOW MOVE!
Scared, Ruby obeys and runs out the kitchen door. Lizard
approaches the baby, who moves inside the blanket.
At the same time, Doug arrives at the last house on the
street.
He looks for his baby in every part of the house.
Nothing but dummies.
Doug enters a room and sees a crib.

Catherine?!
He goes to the crib and discovers a plastic doll...
BIG BRAIN LIED!
SMALL VOICE
(INNOCENT)
You want to play with us mister?
Doug turns around and sees two children playing in the
shadows. They smile at him kindly-
THEIR FACES AND LITTLE BODIES ARE MONSTROUSLY DEGENERATED!
Doug backs away terrified.
Lizard is about to butcher the baby on the table.
Catherine is calm and moves slowly under the blanket.
Lizard lifts the machete and removes the blanket-
THE BABY HAS BEEN REPLACED BY THE PIGLET STOLEN FROM THE GAS
STATION!
Ruby made the swap before Lizard entered the kitchen.
The piglet runs off oinking...
LIZARD
RUUUBY!
Enraged, Lizard sticks the machete into the table.
Under the fake car, in between the seats, Beast finds a hole
big enough to fit his nose.
The animal forces his way through, scratching at the floor
until he finally fits his body through the hole and out of
the car.
The dog runs down Main Street...

Brenda returns to the trailer where two propane tanks have
been brought out from under the sink.
Through the window, she watches her brother get further out.
Brenda opens the valves to the gas tanks.
Bobby enters the trailer, closing the door behind him. He
quickly tapes matches at the bottom of the door, right above
the striking part of the matchbox on the floor.
Next to him, the propane flows freely.
99.
