11EXT. ASYLUM -- DAY

      FX SHOT: DMP - Establishing shot.  A big old house with
      large overgrown grounds surrounded by high fencing.  The
      place looks empty and semi-derelict.  There's a an old
      faded sign - ST JUDE'S HOSPITAL.  It's faded - over it has
      been nailed another sign - PRIVATE PROPERTY, KEEP OUT! 
      But even this has been hanging there for decades.

      There are a lot of Keep Out signs.

      But they don't deter GILL, a teenage girl.  With a glance
      around her, she is slipping through a gap in the fence,

      She's about 17, dressed in jeans and a biker's jacket.  No
      girly-girl.  She can clearly handle herself.  But she keeps
      low as she runs towards the derelict hospital, as if she's
      expecting someone to take a shot at her.

                                                                            CUT TO:

22INT. ASYLUM CORRIDOR. -- DAY

      GILL is coming through a window.  Still wary, exploring.
      On edge.

      This place doesn't look like anyone has set foot in it in
      decades.

      She continues to explore.

                                                                            CUT TO:

33INT. ASYLUM. VAULT CORRIDOR -- DAY

      GILL moves cautiously down another corridor.  From her
      jacket pocket she takes something - a small ACTIVATOR DISC,
      its covered in alien runes. 

      FX SHOT: It starts to glow, dimly.

      She's found what she's looking for.  She holds the device
      out in front of her. 

      FX SHOT: The disc glows brighter

      Suddenly a whole section of wall slides aside - revealing
      a massive VAULT DOOR.

      Gill smiles.

                                                                            CUT TO:

44INT. DREAD'S BASE -- DAY

      A subterranean chamber somewhere in the asylum.  Dark,
      filled with alien technology - but it's dusty, covered in
      cobwebs.  No-one has set foot here in a very long time.



                                                                (CONTINUED)        SJA 4 Ep 3 PINKS 29/03/10   BBC 2010 CONFIDENTIAL page 2

4CONTINUED:4

      At one side of the room - three man-sized metal caskets. 
      Cables and pipes running into them.

      Suddenly a light begins to flash above each casket.

                                                                            CUT TO:

55INT. ASYLUM. VAULT CORRIDOR -- DAY

      GILL closes on the vault door - it's massive, the kind of
      thing they'd keep gold bullion in.  She strokes the door -
      almost reverential.

      Gill then takes the disc and fits it into a recess clearly
      made for it.

      It begins to revolve.  Lights begin to come on around the
      door.

                                                                            CUT TO:

66INT. DREAD'S BASE -- DAY

      With a burst of gas the locks on the three caskets release
      and the lids open just a little.

      CLOSE on one of them - as a man's hand extends from the
      casket.  A flash of white cuff and black jacket sleeve -
      as the lid is pushed aside.  Lots of gas.

      Black shoes hit the floor.  Three pairs - making their way
      out of there.

                                                                            CUT TO:

77INT. ASYLUM. VAULT CORRIDOR -- DAY

      On GILL's face - we can see that she's ready for a big
      moment.  Something she's been waiting for.

      Anxious, she pulls on the door - won't open.

                                    GILL
                    What?!

      She tries again.  Still nothing.  She starts to lose it.

                                    GILL (CONT'D)
                    Open!  You've got to open!

      And then she sees a second recess...

      She looks at the alien disc in the door, realizing with
      horror -

                                    GILL (CONT'D)
                    Two access discs?*

      And then a noise - she turns around -


                                                                (CONTINUED)        SJA 4 Ep 3 PINKS 29/03/10   BBC 2010 CONFIDENTIAL page 3

7CONTINUED:7

      Three men at the end of the corridor all dressed in black
      suits, white shirts and black ties.  All with dark glasses. 
      All tall, thin, with whitish skin.  Two have dark hair,
      their leader is ash blond.

      MISTER DREAD and his MEN IN BLACK.

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    Prepare to be incinerated.

      And the three raise their left hands - and remove them.

      Revealing laser blasters.

      Gill grabs the disc and runs for it!

                                                                            CUT TO:

88EXT. MARTIAN SURFACE -- DAY

      It's a low-angle view of an alien landscape - the camera-
      view of a robot probe moving across the Martian surface.

                                      MISSION CONTROL (O.S.)
                    Oh boy, it's looking like a
                    beautiful morning on Mars today.

      On-screen graphics roll down one side of the screen, showing
      surface temperature and the probe's Martian latitude and
      longitude, battery charge, and other info...

99INT./EXT SARAH JANE'S ATTIC/MARTIAN SURFACE -- DAY

      And we find SARAH JANE and CLYDE watching the Mars footage
      on MISTER SMITH's screen. It's a split screen, one side 
      shows the footage from NASA's PoV with numbers and text 
      etc, the other side the clean footage direct from the probe 
      to Mister Smith.

                                      MISSION CONTROL (O.S.)
                      Continuing on programmed route.

      As RANI comes through the door, bursting with news -

                                    RANI
                    Hi there!  Guess what!

      She sees Mars on Mister Smith's screen, but - *

                    Hey, Rani!  How are you?*

      And we find LUKE webcaming on Sarah Jane's computer screen -*

      And Mars is almost forgotten -*

                    How's Oxford?

                    Can you two keep it down?  We need*
                    to time this to the second. *

                                      RANI*
                    Sorry. Is that Mars?*

      Clyde is loving it.*

                    It's a feed from the latest Mars*
                    robot probe.  Sarah Jane is about*
                    to upset NASA big time.*

                                      MISTER SMITH*
                    Probe will be in sight of the target*

                    So how's everybody at school?*

                                      RANI*
                    Oh, you know.  Clyde's still winding*
                    my dad up.  Those flatmates working*
                    out okay?*

                                      CLYDE*
                    He says they just live off curry*
                    and baked beans.  Must be like*
                    living with the Slitheen!*

      Clyde, Rani and Luke laugh.  Sarah Jane remains intent on*
      Mister Smith's screen.*

                                      MISTER SMITH
                      Approaching point of visibility.

      FX SHOT: And on screen, on the horizon - the tip of what
      looks like a pyramid -

                                      MISTER SMITH (CONT'D)
                    Jamming signal now!

      And suddenly the NASA half of the screen breaks up with
      static.

                                      MISSION CONTROL (O.S.)
                    Where did the signal go?  We've
                    lost contact with the probe.

      Sarah Jane smiles.

      FX SHOT: They see the pyramid on their half of the screen.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Well done, Mister Smith.

      And then the other half of the screen blanks out too.

                                    LUKE
                    Looks like NASA just lost yet
                    another Mars probe.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    The remains of an ancient

                    She is so out of control.

1010INT. COMMUNITY HALL -- DAY

      GITA is on her feet.

                                    GITA
                    My name is Gita Chandra.  And I've
                    seen aliens.

      There's an explosion of applause from around her.  And we
      see that Gita is on her feet.  There's a horseshoe of chairs
      taken by a whole range of regular people, all ages, some a
      little stiff, some a little geeky.  But they're all
      applauding.  And Gita feels the love.  Beside her sits
      HARESH, arms crossed, barely hiding his grumpiness - can't
      believe he's here.

      The group leader is a librarian-like woman in her sixties -
      OCEAN WATERS.  She smiles broadly.

                                      OCEAN
                    Welcome to the British UFO Research
                    and Paranormal Studies Society.

      And behind Ocean we see the society's banner - the BURPSS
      acronym is unmistakable.

                                      OCEAN (CONT'D)
                    We've all seen them.  What were
                    yours like?

      And Gita is so pleased to be taken seriously...

                    Like a lizard.

      Flashback from 3.2 - GITA and HARESH watch in amazement as
      the JUDOON escort ANDROVAX past.

      Gita still on her feet, Ocean and the others, listening
      keenly.

                                    GITA (CONT'D)
                    This is my husband Haresh.  We
                    both saw them.

      Haresh really doesn't want to be here.

                                      HARESH
                    Hello.

                                    GITA
                    This is my card, by the way. 
                    Bloomin' Lovely.  Flowers for flower*
                    people.*

      Ocean takes the offered card.  Is friendly.

                                      OCEAN*
                    I do love fresh flowers.*

                                    GITA
                    I do home deliveries. I've got a*
                    new ad in the Echo - I was checking*
                    it, when I saw your group advertised*
                    and I had to come, Miss Waters,*
                    and tell you what I'd - we'd -
                    seen.

                                      OCEAN
                    Oh, call me Ocean.  So many people
                    feel awkward - even embarrassed -
                    admitting to a close encounter. 
                    But we at BURPSS believe you should
                    let it all out.

      And Haresh has to stifle a burst of laughter.  Gita notices,
      elbows.

                                    GITA
                    Oh, I feel so much better for it.

                                      OCEAN
                    Ealing is the centre of so much
                    alien activity.  And Friday is our
                    monthly UFO-watch.  

      Among the other members - a geeky, chubby man in a woolly
      tanktop - MINTY - pipes up.

1313EXT. ASYLUM GROUNDS -- DAY

      GILL is running - looks almost fit to drop.  The look of
      someone being hunted.

      Behind her, the MEN IN BLACK led by MISTER DREAD pursue
      her relentlessly. 

      She staggers as her ankle twists. She catches her breath. 
      Hopeless.

      MISTER DREAD calls to her.

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    Escape is not an option.

      Gill looks back at Mister Dread.  And she limps hurriedly
      around a corner...

      FX SHOT: Gill shimmers - and out of her body slips ANDROVAX. 
      His clothes are covered in dried-on dirt.  He looks about
      him warily.  Gill's body lies unconscious on the ground.

      FX SHOT: Androvax's forked tongue flashes across his face.

      And he runs away - just as MISTER DREAD and the MEN IN
      BLACK arrive.

      Mister Dread takes a scanner from his pocket - passes it
      over Gill's body.

      HARESH turns off the ignition.  He and GITA are in the
      middle of something -

                                      HARESH
                    Gita, they're called BURPSS. 
                    They're a bunch of windbags.

                                    GITA
                    Why do you refuse to believe what
                    you've seen with your own eyes?

                                      HARESH
                    I'm not denying aliens exist.  
                    But whatever they were doing here,
                    it was a one-off.  You're not going
                    to see them again.

      As Haresh turns to get out of the car - and Gita turns to
      see stealthy ANDROVAX across the road.

      She screams.

      Androvax runs out of sight into Sarah Jane's garden - as
      Haresh spins around to Gita.

                                      HARESH (CONT'D)
                    What's wrong?

                    Oh, yes.  Very funny.

      And he's getting out of the car.

                                                                              CUT TO

                    It ran into Sarah's drive.

      She pulls a wheel brace from the boot - presses it into

      And there's the bang of the car door - we see Gita has
      locked herself in Haresh's car.

      HARESH walks into the drive.  He's not expecting to find
      anything.  And isn't intending to do more than take a quick
      look.

      But there's the snap of a twig.

      Haresh spins around.  Suddenly on edge.

      Hidden deep amid big, thick bushes, ANDROVAX watches...

                                      HARESH
                    Hello?  Is there anybody there?

      Sort of.

      And Haresh thinks he sees something amid the bushes.

      Androvax's POV: Haresh coming towards him.

      As -

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Haresh?

      Haresh almost jumps out of his skin as Sarah Jane emerges
      from the front door - RANI and CLYDE with her.

                                    RANI
                    Dad?  What are you doing?

      In the bushes, Androvax pulls back deeper into the shadows.

      Haresh is more than a little embarrassed.

                                      HARESH
                    I'm sorry.  Gita thought she'd
                    seen someone suspicious.

                                      CLYDE
                    And you thought they needed a hand
                    changing a tyre?

      Haresh gives in.

                          (to Sarah Jane)
                    She thought she'd seen the lizard
                    alien we saw at Genetech.

      Sarah Jane tries to hide the shiver of worry.  Smiles.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    An alien? In my garden?

      And she consciously starts to lead them back to the door -
      away from any possible threat.

      Clyde and Rani exchange a worried glance, and follow (Rani
      bringing up the rear).

                                      HARESH
                    She dragged me along to this UFO

                    Pardon me?

                                      HARESH
                    Exactly.  I think it's got her
                      imagination running wild.  You
                    know what your mother's like.

      Rani's distracted by something nearby - more a feeling
      than a sound, but tries to ignore -

                    Well if I come across any aliens 
                    I'll be sure to let Gita know.

                    cheese was like eating super-glue?

      Rani ignores.  Turns to Sarah Jane.

                    We should go back up to the attic.

                    What for?  Androvax?  No way.  The
                    Judoon took him prisoner.  He isn't
                    coming back here.  Why would he?

                    On the other hand, Androvax is a
                    genocidal killer who destroyed
                    twelve worlds.  Never mind that
                    nasty habit he has of jumping into
                    other people's bodies.

      Sarah Jane shivers at the memory of her possession by
      Androvax.

      And she's moving past Sarah Jane towards the front door. 
      Something about her manner isn't right.  Sarah Jane is
      wary.

                    How creepy is this place?

      Clyde reads the old sign -

                    Saint Jude's Hospital.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Not a hospital.  It was an asylum.

      Rani and Clyde exchange a look.  Creeped out.

      Sarah Jane sonics the padlock on the gate.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                    hide a spaceship in?

      Sarah Jane moves off, exploring.  Scanning with her watch.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    The vault must be hyper-dimensional.

                                      CLYDE
                    Which means, exactly...?

                    The entrance might be on Earth -
                    but the vault itself is somewhere
                    else.

                    Maybe the answer is through here.

      They've come to a door.  She opens it - a flight of steps
      leading down.

                                      SARAH JANE (CONT'D)
                    We could do with some light down
                    here.

      Clyde pulls out out his trusty pen-torch.

                    Some of us carry a sonic lipstick. 
                    Me? I've got a light-up torch.

      And they head into the gloom - but none notice the thread
      of red light they break at ankle height.

                    If you ask me the other side of a

                    Well, let's find out.

      She zaps the door.  Heavy locks clunk on it release.  And
      the door swings inwards.

                    Uh-oh I think we just found where
                    Daddy Bear sleeps with Mummy Bear
                    and Baby Bear.

      And we see the caskets in the room.  They investigate -*

                                      SARAH JANE
                    The question is - where are their*

                                      CLYDE
                    Maybe they left when all this was

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Or maybe something woke them up. 

      Rani is examining some of the equipment.

                                    RANI
                    And I don't think this equipment

                                      SARAH JANE
                    It's alien.

                    I'm sure this is a transmat device. 
                    But there's no power to it.  It's
                    been shut down.  And has been for
                    a long time.

      Meanwhile Clyde has found something else -

                                      CLYDE
                    Somebody needs to get a scrapbook.

      It's a wall covered in newspaper clippings.  All very old
      and yellowing.  All of them with headlines about Flying
      Saucer sightings, or people being abducted by aliens.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Some of these go back to the
                      nineteen-fifties.

                                    RANI
                    Why do aliens keep newspaper
                    clippings about UFO sightings?

                                      CLYDE
                    ETs with big egos?

      But one clipping has caught Sarah Jane's attention - a
      picture of a woman in her 20s.  Under the headline SPACEMEN
      KIDNAPPED ME.  It's a much younger Ocean Waters.  Sarah
      Jane takes it from the wall.

                                      SARAH JANE
                        Nineteen-seventy-two.  That's Ocean
                    Waters from BURPSS.

                                    RANI
                    Mum's friend?  She was abducted by
                    aliens?

      Sarah Jane is a little saddened.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    That must be why she started BURPSS. 
                    If only she'd had a better name
                    for it, people might have taken
                    her more seriously.

                                      CLYDE
                    But what does this have to do with
                    Androvax and an alien vault?

      Sarah Jane puts the newspaper clipping in her pocket.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    I don't know.  But we need to find
                    that vault.  Come on.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Could be.

                                      CLYDE
                    You know, I'm thinking - is this a
                    good idea?  I mean, whether a whole
                    race of body-popping aliens is
                    something the universe really needs?

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Androvax did some terrible things. 
                    But that doesn't mean his entire
                    species is better off extinct.
                    Earth has had its fair share of
                    bad men, but Humanity deserves its

                    Thank you for the introduction.

                    The Veil is not among you.

                    The Veil, Androvax, says this could
                    save his species.  That the last
                    of them were in stasis aboard a
                    ship that crashed here.  That they
                    are held here in a hyper-dimensional
                    vault.  Would you know anything
                    about that, Mister Dread?

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    These are off-world matters.  Humans
                    are irrelevant.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Earth is my planet and, believe
                    me, that makes me very relevant. 
                    And if you have the second vault
                    activator disc you have the survival
                    of an entire species in your hands. 
                    Whoever you are, I won't let you
                    ignore that.  Where is the other
                    disc?

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    We do not have it.  It's security
                    is assured.  One alone is useless. 
                    Give me the activator disc and
                    bring me the Veil.  Or prepare to
                    be incinerated.

      As one, Mister Dread and the Men in Black remove their
      left hands - revealing their blasters.

      And Sarah Jane jumps into the corridor - sonic at the ready
      as MISTER DREAD and the MEN IN BLACK head towards her.

      Sarah Jane zaps with the sonic.

      FX SHOT: Electricity seems to arc around Mister Dread and
      the Men in Black - like a suddenly visible force field.

      The sonic doesn't touch them.

      Sarah Jane is horrified.

      FX SHOT: Mister Dread fires.

      Sarah Jane just gets out of the way in time.

                                      SARAH JANE (CONT'D)
                    It doesn't work!  Run!

3535EXT. ASYLUM -- DAY

      SARAH JANE, CLYDE and RANI run from the asylum towards the
      waiting Figaro.  The MEN IN BLACK pursue, walking but
        unstoppable. Then MISTER DREAD stops, as do the other two.

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    Let them go.

      SARAH JANE, RANI and CLYDE get into the Figaro and it powers
      away.

                                      MISTER DREAD (CONT'D)

      SARAH JANE, CLYDE and RANI burst back in.  MISTER SMITH is
      out - keeping watch over ANDROVAX, still held in the
      containment vortex.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    We just met your friend, Mister
                    Dread.

                                      ANDROVAX
                    The man in black?

                                      CLYDE
                    Yeah.  He's an android with a laser
                    blaster up his sleeve.  Thanks for
                      mentioning that.

                                      MISTER SMITH
                    Androids dressed in black?  They
                    were instruments of the Alliance
                    of Shades.

                                    RANI
                    Which is what?

                                      MISTER SMITH
                    An alien initiative to inhibit
                    human awareness of extra-
                      terrestrial life.  The Men in Black
                    operated in the period of 1953 to
                    1972,  when the Alliance was
                      disbanded.  During this time they
                    reputedly wiped the memories of
                    people who encountered aliens and
                      engineered the disposal of off-
                    world debris.

                                      SARAH JANE
                      Apparently into a hyper-dimensional
                    vault.  Which the Men in Black are
                    still guarding.

                                      CLYDE
                          (to Androvax)
                    You woke them up when you tried to
                    bust into it.  Thanks, mate.

                                    RANI
                      Seventy-two?  That's when Ocean
                    Waters was abducted.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    We need to find out everything we
                    can about Mister Dread.  We should
                    talk to Miss Waters.

                                      ANDROVAX
                    If Dread wiped her memory you will
                    learn nothing.  But if I come with
                    you...

                                      SARAH JANE
                    No, Androvax.

                                      ANDROVAX
                    My species is at stake.  If I take
                    her body I will find her memories
                    of the Men in Black.   She will be
                    unharmed.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    I can't ask anyone to let you take
                    them over.

                                      ANDROVAX
                    It will be her choice.

                    I know what I'd say.  Anyway, I'd
                    freak the minute I saw him.

      Sarah Jane makes a big decision.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Mister Smith, deactivate the
                      containment vortex.

                                      MISTER SMITH

                    What are you doing?

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Androvax will have to travel there
                    in me.

                    Old friends reunited.

      Sarah Jane steels herself, as Androvax reaches towards her -
      but Clyde grabs her, draws her aside.

                                      CLYDE
                    No.  If something goes wrong with
                    this, we need you.  Take me,
                    Androvax.  Do it now!

      FX SHOT: Clyde closes his eyes tight as Androvax takes
      him.

      Clyde justs stands there.  Unmoving.  Eyes closed.

                                    RANI
                    Clyde?

      Clyde opens his eyes.

      FX SHOT: Androvax's tongue snaps out.

      MISTER DREAD stands before the wall of newspaper cuttings. 
      He has seen the missing clipping.  Touching the empty space.

                                      OCEAN
                    Well, this is a surprise, Miss
                    Smith.  I'm afraid our alien hunt
                    was something of a lost cause.

                                      MINTY
                    A minor malfunction.  Don't really
                      understand it.  The bi-conductor
                    is working.

      He touches something in there.  Cries out with pain as he
      gets a small electric shock.

                                      MINTY (CONT'D)
                    Yes.  That's working all right.

      Rani and Sarah Jane try to hide their amusement.  Clyde
      just stares.  Unnatural.

      Minty gets back to work on his contraption as -

                                      SARAH JANE
                    My visit is more of a professional
                    nature.  I'm a journalist.  Given
                    your "expertise" in the field of
                    ufology, I wondered what you could
                    tell me about Men in Black?  For
                    instance, have you ever met someone
                    called Mister Dread?

      Ocean can't hide her shock.

                                      OCEAN
                    Where did you hear that name?

                                    RANI
                    Coming out of his face.

      And suddenly Ocean is over-joyed -

                                      OCEAN
                    You've seen him?  I - I don't
                    believe it!  This - this is -

      She can barely get the words out for her excitement.  She
      grabs Minty, hugs him so tight he might pop.

                                      OCEAN (CONT'D)
                    This is amazing!  You've seen him!

      Then...

                                      OCEAN (CONT'D)
                    But - but he must be so old now.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    He's surprisingly sprightly.  But
                    Ocean, I need you to tell me what
                    you know about him... And why you're
                    so pleased.

                                      OCEAN
                    Because it proves he exists!  That
                    I'm not mad!  No-one would ever
                    believe me.  About the abduction,
                    or about them - the Men in Black. 
                    It's been almost forty years.  How
                    many times do you think I've even
                    asked myself if I was mad?

                                    RANI
                    But you remember them?

      Ocean is anguished.

                                      OCEAN
                    Not the details.  Nothing you could
                    call evidence.  That's what they
                    do to you.  Every time I've tried
                    to remember - my head, it's just
                    filled with this bright green glow. 
                    But I remember him.  Mister Dread. 
                    Nothing could wipe out that face.

      Ocean looks somehow lost...

                                      MINTY
                    That's why she founded BURPSS -
                    it's been her life.  Trying to
                    find some way of proving what
                    happened to her.  That aliens exist.

      And a light starts to pulse under Ocean's top.

                                    RANI
                    Sarah Jane, look!

      And Sarah Jane takes the activator from her pocket - it
      too pulses with PRAC light.  Ocean stares in disbelief.

                                      OCEAN
                    Oh... my...

      Ocean removes a chain from around her neck - another alien
      disc.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    I don't think Mister Dread just
                    wiped your memory, Ocean - I think
                    he left something with you for
                      safe-keeping in 1972.

      Ocean looks at it, tears in her eyes.

                                      OCEAN
                    Something has always told me this
                    was special.  I had no idea where
                    it came from.  When I bought it,
                    or found it.  It's just always
                    felt so precious.  I haven't taken
                    it off in 40 years.

      And Clyde snatches it from Ocean.

                    No, Androvax!

      Suddenly Minty jumps back from his alien detector - its
      lights suddenly flashing and sensors spinning.
