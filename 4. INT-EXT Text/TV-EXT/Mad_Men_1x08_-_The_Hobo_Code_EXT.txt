      Establishing.  A KNOCK at the door, off screen.



      In the yard of Dick s home.  He combs his hair in a mirror 
      that leans against the shed.  His father, ARCHIBALD WHITMAN, 
      stands behind him dragging a razor over his soapy cheek.  

      WIDER, a landscape of dust and more dust.  Some dry greenery 
      clings to a fence running around the property.  Across the 
      road, a clapboard barn and a field of meager crops.  

      The squeaking hinge on the gate turns Dick s attention away 
      from his reflection.  He sees a HOBO, 40 s, approaching 
      Dick s mother, EFFIE, who is hanging clothes on a line.  
      Archibald squints and stays the blade.  

      The Hobo remove his hat.

                                  HOBO

                    I m not a freeloader and I m not an 
                    agitator.  I m an able-bodied man 
                    looking to work in exchange for a 
                    hot meal and a place to sleep.

                                  ARCHIBALD
                    You need your hearing checked?  I 
                    said move it along.

                                  EFFIE
                      Archibald.

      Effie studies the Hobo - a gaunt, desperate-looking man 
      dressed in filthy denim and a threadbare cotton shirt.  

                                  EFFIE (CONT D)
                    When s the last time you ate?

                                  HOBO
                    Noon yesterday.  Beans and coffee.
                          (for Archibald)
                    I m good with my hands, can slop 
                    pigs, clear stones in your field. 

                                  EFFIE
                    You sit with us for supper then 
                    start tomorrow, pick the last of 
                    the corn. 

                                  ARCHIBALD
                          (throws down the razor)
                    God dammit woman!

                                  EFFIE
                    Never mind him.  Change out of 
                    those rags, lemme boil the stink 
                    out of  em.

                                  HOBO
                    Mighty Christian of you, ma am.

      Dick and The Hobo make fleeting eye contact.

                    Hiya, son.

      MUSIC from Midge s loft creeps into the scene.  It s manic 
      and atonal.  It s Mingus or possibly Sun Ra.        MAD MEN  EP#107  CP 2nd Draft  "The Code Don't Lie"  9/5/07

      Patrol cars are out front, their lights sweeping across the 
      streets.  TWO UNIFORMED COPS roust a handcuffed Puerto Rican 
      MAN in a bathrobe.  

      Don parts the small sea of people, tipping his hat to the 
      cops, who return a friendly wave of the nightstick.



                                  DON
                    Bobby.  Wake up, sweetie.  Daddy 
                    needs you to wake up.

                                  ROBERT
                          (moans incoherently)

                                  DON
                    Come on, kiddo.  

                                  ROBERT
                      ...Daddy...

                                  DON
                    Shh-shh, your sister s sleeping.  
                          (beat)
                    You awake?  



      Robert, in rocketship pajamas, rubs his eyes.  He and his 
      father stand in the backyard with crickets chirping.

                                  DON
                    Look at me.  I want you to ask me 
                    any question you want.

                                  ROBERT
                    What?

                                  DON
                    Anything you want to know, whatever 
                    it is, ask me. 

      The boy looks into the dark hedges and sees throbbing 
      pinpoints of light.

                          (beat)
                    But I will never lie to you.



      Don sits alone in his backyard residually high.  The sound of 
      a DISTANT TRAIN WHISTLE drifts through the night.  He closes 
      his eyes and runs his hand over the dewy grass.



      Dick s young hand runs over the greenery that creeps along 
      the farmhouse fence.  The leaves and vines become metal at 
      the gate.  Dick moves his hand back over the greenery and 
      digs around for something.  He pulls back the leaves and 
      twigs and sees a crude symbol carved into the peeling white 
      paint.  It is the same symbol The Hobo scratched on the floor 
      of the root cellar, a curved dagger, the symbol that tells 
      fellow travelers a dishonest man lives here.

      Dick looks past the fence and sees his father sharpening the 
      blade of a scythe.  His father stands up. 

                                  ARCHIBALD
                    Get away from that fence and do 
                    your chores or so help me I ll cut 
                    you from your asshole to your 
                    appetite!

      ON Archibald s dirty face looking at Dick, 

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:
