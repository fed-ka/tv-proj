                I ve got to get in early.  Do you think 

                you can handle taking Eve to her

                I don t know.  And I still think I m 

                being unfairly criticized.  Eve s never 

                put on makeup.  She looked like a 

                Kabuki Frankenstein.

                Nice.  I was taking her to work with me 

                so she can see how Americans work.

                No, Howie.  He needs to see how 

                  Americans work.  If I m running Euclid

                what could possibly go wrong there.  

                And you thought French was bad for him.

                Now who s selling him short?  The 

                problem is you coddle the boy.

                                    VANESSA

                There s a difference between coddling 

                him and simply keeping him alive.

                                  TIM

                for demolition.  He s always been good 

                at destroying things.  And the nice

                  Attention, everyone.  We are here 

                tonight for a celebration.

      TIM RAISES HIS BEER TO MAKE A TOAST.  EVERYONE MOVES CLOSER.

                To Vanessa.  I obviously don t know 

                what goes on at your work.  I obviously 

                don t know where you work.  But I can 

                say with absolute certainty that you 

                deserved the promotion.  Because I know 

                you, I know you make everyone around 

                you better or at least want to be 

                better.  You re intelligent, honest, 

                  respectful and loyal to a fault.  And 

                when someone is being a jackass on your 

                special night you don t crack him in 

                the head even though you should.  

                That s why you got the promotion.  Not 

                because you re a woman, but because 

                you re the best.

      TIM NODS.  VANESSA KISSES HIM THEN WALKS OFF.  ALL IS GOOD 
      UNTIL ED AND NIKKI WALK OVER.  TIM IS SURPRISED TO SEE THEM.

                When did you get here?

                                  NIKKI

                Just in time to hear you admit that 

                women are doing it better than men.

                                  ED

                You did.  In my day we would have 

                dragged you behind a horse.

                                  TIM

                You grew up in Brooklyn.  Your dad was 

                a poet.

                                  NIKKI

                Well, I still appreciate the vote of 

                  confidence.

                                  TIM

                It wasn t real.  I was being nice to my 

                wife.  That s what men do; we re 

                complex.  Know what I really believe?  

                I can run this company better than you.  

                And someday, Howie could do the same.The Last Days of Man50.
