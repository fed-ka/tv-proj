SUNNY MORNING
The boys put on their dark glasses and pause at the top of
the steps to light up their cigarettes. They both roll their
cigarette butts along their tongues and screw them into their
lips. In this unique way they light up, seemingly oblivious
to their synchronicity and mimic.
CONNOR
(Irish accent)
I do believe the Monsignor finally
got a point.
MURPHY
(Irish accent)
Aye.
They leave.
NIGHT
Mom stands on the back stoop holding the door ajar with her
hip. She holds the phone receiver up in her left hand and
the gun directly next to it, in her right. She squeezes off
a loud shot toward the heavens.
MORNING
PAUL SMECKER, F.B.I. agent, is lead by the Boston Chief of
Police through a jungle of ravenous reporters, police lines
and uniformed officers. He is impeccably dressed in a deep
red suit. He is smiling, confident as he walks. He is a very
good-looking, slender man.
He looks intently, for a moment, at four uniformed officers.
They approach two dead bodies, laying next to a dented green
dumpster with half the paint job scraped off.
One man, IVAN CHECKOV, lays on his stomach, closer to the
dumpster than the other. The ass of his pants has been burnt
out and a large cotton bandage is in its place.
The other, VLADDY, has a blood soaked bandage around his
head and is on his stomach as well. There are hundreds of
pieces of porcelain of various sizes everywhere. Three plain-
clothed homicide detectives, DUFFY, DOLLY and GREENLY hover
close to the bodies. Dolly and Duffy listen to GREENLY, an
obvious rookie, give his over-confident theory of what took
place.
The chief is about to interrupt them, but Smecker holds him
back with a smile. The two wait and watch in a position,
where the unsuspecting detectives have their backs to them.
GREENLY
(thick Boston accent)
...so these guys are just kickin'
the shit out of each other. This guy
(points to Vladdy)
Picks up an old kitchen sink that
some one threw out and crushes this
guy
(Checkov)
With it. All right, so it makes a
big bang and alerts their friend,
who's standin' look out around the
corner. So he comes over and gets
into it with this guy,
(Vladdy)
He's angry at him, right? They get
into an altercation in which the
look out guy crushes this guy by
jumpin on him. And look at the damage
here.
(Vladdy)
I mean this guy's fuckin' hamburger
man. His spine is crushed. He's all
twisted and shit. That guy had to be
one big mother fucker. Huge, 3-400
pounds, fuckin huge.
Smecker listens.
The Chief is embarrassed.
GREELY
Or, okay. Check this out. Say these
two don't even know the huge guy.
They're just staggerin' home from a
bar this morning, still all fucked
up from St. Patty's last night. So
they figure they'll take a short cut
down the alley and this big mother
fucker, he's just waitin'. And what
could be more perfect for strong arm
robbery? Two drunk guys all bandaged
up. They're already injured for Christ
sakes. He takes a blunt object and
whacks the guy with the bandage on
his head, right? Cause he's smart.
He knows the guy with the bandage on
his ass, he ain't going nowhere.
Matter of fact, this guy's probably
helping his friend with the rectal
problem along. They're limping around
like a couple of decrepit old broads.
So once this guy's out of the picture
(denotes Vladdy)
this poor asshole, he tries to run.
But look how far he gets fore the
huge bastard catches up with him.
Only a few yards. And what does he
do? He gets creative. He picks up a
sink and crushes the poor mother-
fucker. Then, he ain't done yet. He
comes over here, jumps on this guy's
back and crushes him to death.
(Vladdy)
He steals their shit and beats it!
Thanks for comin' out!
(beat)
And look at this print...
Greenly points out a large foot print on Vladdy's back.
Some detectives nod in agreement. Smecker chuckles as he
shakes his head.
GREENLY
That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and
think about it. Of all the ways to
kill a guy, crushin' him to death.
That's very particular. You don't
get many of those. I dunno. I feel
something big here. I wouldn't be
surprised if we see more of these
turning up.
SMECKER
(stepping into the
open)
Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy
theory and Serial crusher theory.
Top fucking notch.
(to Greenly)
What's your name?
GREENLY
Detective Greenly. Who the fuck are
you?
Smecker saunters up to Greely and pulls his I.D. out of the
breast pocket of his sport coat and lets it hang. The large,
light blue letters, F.B.I. can be easily seen.
SMECKER
That's who the fuck I am.
All the detectives seem disgruntled and look to the Chief
for an explanation.
CHIEF
Listen, I gotta go by the numbers on
this one. I.D. just came back on
these guys. They've got connections
to the Russian mob. That makes it a
federal matter and Agent Smecker,
here, is heading up the investigation
with our full cooperation.
SMECKER
(transfixed on Greely)
Why don't you get me a cup of coffee.
GREENY
What the fuck?
SMECKER
Caf latte.
GREENLY
Who the...
SMECKER
Twist of lemon!
GREENLY
(to Chief)
Chief, what the fuck is this?
SMECKER
Sweet-n-low!
Greenly looks helplessly to the Chief, who simply nods. He
storms off the scene, upset. Smecker turns his back on
everyone and puts earphones in. He reaches down and hits
play. The choir song "Agnus dei" overtakes. He begins to
investigate. He kneels at the bodies for a moment then stares
at the opposite brick wall. He picks up a piece of porcelain
and scrapes it with his thumb.
He quickly cocks his head toward the sky and begins to chuckle
as he says Jesus Christ, under his breath. He brushes some
paraffin on each of the dead men's hands. Duffy and Dolly
watch defiantly. They start to smile at one another as they
collectively realize his homosexuality. He is slightly
effeminate buy not overly fey.
SMECKER
(loudly)
Mitchell, Langley!
Two uniformed officers approach.
MITCHELL
Yes sir.
SMECKER
Find the manager of this building.
See if he has had any complaints of
water coming down in any apartments,
starting just this morning. If he's
not there, knock on every door
starting from the third floor up.
Langley, you take this building,
same thing.
Mitchell and Langley exit.
SMECKER
Chaffey, Newman.
Two more uniforms approach.
CHAFFEY
Yes sir.
SMECKER
(to Chaffey)
Look in the trash around their hands.
See if you can find me two bullet
casings. 45's, if my eye serves me
right. Don't disturb them. Mark them
as they lay. Newman, root through
this shit.
(points to the mountain
of garbage)
If this was a sink find me some metal
parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain
cover or something.
The two begin their tasks. Chaffey finds a casing near
Checkov's hand, hidden under the edge of the pile.
CHAFFEY
Got it. It's a 45.
The homicide detectives are surprised as Chaffey looks for
the second shell. Smecker lights up a smoke.
SMECKER
Chief, could you get ballistics down
here and tell them they have to dig
a 45 slug out of a brick wall.
He points to a bullet hole in the opposing and tattered wall.
SMECKER
...and locate another that's been
fired through a dumpster.
He points to another bullet hole at the dumpster's base.
CHIEF
I got the best ballistics guy in the
world. He's mobile. Got all his stuff
right in the van. Can have him down
here in 10 minutes.
DOLLY
How did you know that?
SMECKER
Paraffin came up positive. And bullet
holes are usually a big clue.
CHAFFEY
I can't find the second one, sir.
SMECKER
Look under the body.
CHAFFEY
(obeys)
Got it.
Smecker turns to detectives with a smirk.
SMECKER
You guy's ready for this?
They both nod.
SMECKER
This was no gangland assassination.
Though creative, it was way too
sloppy. Something went wrong here.
This has personal written all over
it. Now, these men were crushed and
the first natural reaction the body
has to such trauma is to tense up.
So now the two shots fired here were
reflex rounds. These guys weren't
shooting at anything, but they were
just about to.
Mitchell returns.
MITCHELL
Agent Smecker,
(pointing to MacManus
building)
This is all illegal loft housing so
there's no manager on the premises
but I found a lady on the fourth
floor said she's had water dripping
down on her whole place. Started
just this morning.
SMECKER
Fourth floor huh? Then we're heading
to the fifth. Let's go up and see
just how right I am.
FRONT STEPS
MORNING
Smecker saunters out, detectives on his heels.
MITCHELL
(approaches Smecker)
Agent Smecker. I know this
neighborhood pretty good. There's a
bar called McGinty's down the block.
It's a good bet they were there last
night.
SMECKER
(turns to detectives)
Good work, Mitchell. I'll check that
out myself.
Duffy starts walking down the street. A REPORTER is hot on
his heels.
REPORTER
Hey, Duffy. What the fuck happened
here? You owe me. This is the one I
want.
DUFFY
Let's go get a cup of coffee. You
ain't gonna fuckin' believe this
one.
Smecker is standing on the front steps in front of uniformed
officers and homicide detectives.
SMECKER
I want A.P.B.'s put out. I want more
uniforms on the streets. One thing's
for sure, wherever these guys are
they're hurting.
DAY
The two are limping up the precinct stairs. Connor is draped
over Murphy who helps his brother along, they are still
attired as in the E.R.
MORNING
Vladdy and Checkov lead Murphy out back into the alley.
Murphy is on his knees next to the dumpster. Checkov has his
gun to the boy's head. He acts like he's going to pull the
trigger, but he stops. Vladdy is standing twenty feet away
with his back to them keeping a look out, gun in hand.
MACMANUS' TENEMENT
LOADING DOORS
MORNING
(slo-mo) Connor steps out onto the sill of the huge, open
loading doors. He is five stories up. His muscles ripple
with the weight of the toilet. His face is barbaric.
MORNING
From his kneeling position, Murphy can see his brother perched
50 feet overhead. He does not let his face betray him.
CHECKOV
I hope your conscience is clear,
Irishman.
LOADING DOORS
MORNING
(slo-mo) Connor bends his knees and heaves the toilet upward
and swings one arm directly beneath it. He is no longer
tethered around the basin. He holds it at a cocked angle.
The heavy porcelain tank cover slips off the toilet.
He tosses the toilet in a left and outwardly trajectory,
then he jumps off the sill to the right. He is sailing through
the air about twenty feet behind, and to the right of the
toilet, cuffed hands above his head, robe up like a cape
behind him. Murphy screams
MORNING
(slo-mo) Checkov begins to laugh heartily. The tank top lands
pristinely on a garbage bag just behind Murphy. Ivan's look
turns to one of terror. Bam! He is crushed by the toilet.
Boom! His gun goes off, punching a hole in the dumpster near
the bottom. Vladdy hears the bang and crouches as he turns
to see a wave of tiny porcelain bits.
Connor lands squarely on Vladdy's back. His gun discharges
firing a hole in the brick of the opposing wall. He is
savagely crushed against the ground. Connor bounces off and
hits the wall, landing in the garbage completely unconscious.
Murphy takes his hands from his head. There is dead silence.
He runs to his brother, pulls him from the trash and checks
his vital signs. He seems okay. Vladdy, still alive, slowly
crawls for his gun, inadvertently covering his own bullet
casing. Murphy goes over, picks up the tank cover and clubs
the man to death with two hard and fast blows, then throws
it up and behind him. It lands in the dumpster with a
resonating boom.
Murphy quickly takes everything from the scene; guns, money,
wallets, watches and a pager. He shoves it in a garbage bag
and throws Connor over his shoulder and runs out of the alley.
FRONT STEPS
EARLY EVENING
The police chief is standing on the front steps of the police
station making a statement to the ravenous press: cameras
and pushy reporters. Agent Smecker stands slightly behind
him.
Rocco stands amidst the sea of reporters as the chief begins.
CHIEF
This is our official statement. The
MacManus brothers are not being
charged with a crime. It was a clean-
cut case of self defense. We have
thanked them for their cooperation
and we thank you, the media, for
your tireless pursuit of the truth.
The press is ablaze with questions. Smecker turns and walks
down the precinct steps, passing Rocco, who carries a bunch
of folded clothes, and heads for the police station. Smecker
glances in Rocco's direction, barely noticing the man who
has already passed him.
SIDEWALK
DOWNTOWN BOSTON
NIGHT
The boys are walking across Copley Square. Connor looks at
the note he wrote at the police station. They stand on the
sidewalk and light smokes. They are in their regular garb;
thick naval P-coats, jeans and leather boots. They each carry
a mid-sized, black, duffle bag. They are serious and business-
like. They scan the Plaza Hotel from across the street. The
elite exit and enter the hotel. Connor glances at his pocket
watch. It's 8:45.
ROCCO'S FRONT STEPS
CONTINUOUS
CONNOR
(hung over)
Donna's gonna be angry about her
cat.
ROCCO
Shit. She's on every drug know to
man. She'd have sold that thing for
a dime bag. Screw her.
(beat)
But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.
CONNOR
(chuckles)
You sound real remorseful.
Connor lights up two smokes and hands one to Rocco.
ROCCO
She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
CONNOR
(beat)
Listen. Something's been bothering
me about last night.
ROCCO
What?
CONNOR
Well... what if your boss knew how
many guys were supposed to be there...
in that room?
ROCCO
What are you saying?
CONNOR
Think about it man. Nine men, six
bullets.
ROCCO
You think they sold me out? No way.
CONNOR
He probably knew you'd end up nailing
the fat guy, maybe one or two more,
but he had to know you weren't walking
out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's
dead on the scene. No in-depth
investigation. It'd slide right off
his back. 'Cause as much as I love
ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone.
What would he be losing? A thirty-
five year old delivery boy?
ROCCO
No, no. That's just not the way things
are done. Besides, how's he know I
don't just get in there see there's
too many and just serve em their
fuckin' food and beat it?
CONNOR
He knows you, man. He knows all you
want is to move up. That's all. A
smooth hitter woulda gone in there,
seen it was a wash and slipped out.
But a guy like you? Knowin' this is
your only chance? Waitin' eighteen
years?
ROCCO
No. No man. That's... that's... you
don't know what you're talking about.
That's bullshit. I know these guys.
I mean, thanks for your concern, but
that just ain't the thing of it.
CONNOR
Do me a favor and roll it around for
a bit on your way in.
ROCCO
No, look. No rolling. Nothing needs
to be rolled.
Murphy stumbles enters scene with Rocco and Connor.
MURPHY
(to Rocco)
Where are you goin'?
(to Connor)
Did you tell him?
CONNOR
Yes.
MURPHY
(to Rocco)
Then what the fuck?
ROCCO
Hey. You don't know that shit for
sure.
MURPHY
Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin'
retard!
ROCCO
Fuck you!
MURPHY
Use your brain for once. Is it so
unbelievable they don't care about
you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in
there today. Dead!
ROCCO
Oh yeah. You two fuckin' Micks know
what's going on, huh?
(flips them off)
Fuck you!
CONNOR
(trying to calm him)
Hey, this ain't a thing you should
gamble on, Roc.
A girl rides by on a bicycle, they pause as she rides between
them.
MURPHY
Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya
want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop.
This is the last time I'll see you.
Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch.
ROCCO
(walking away)
I'll be back at 9:00.
CONNOR
Hey. You get in there and start
getting a bad vibe, get the fuck out
quick.
STREET IN FRONT OF LAKEVIEW LUNCH
DAY
...there is a close-up on a hand pulling back from the coin
slot. The hand moves up to pull a cigarette from its
possessor's mouth. It is Rocco. He dials the phone.
MURPHY (V.O.)
Hello?
ROCCO
Hey, Murph.
MURPHY (V.O.)
Roc. You okay?
ROCCO
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
MURPHY (V.O.)
No. You sure you're okay?
ROCCO
I'm fuckin' fine.
(beat)
Catch you on the flip side.
He goes across the street and enters Salamone's.
ALLEY BEHIND SIN BIN
NIGHT
Rocco, Connor and Murphy are looking very serious as they
smoke outside the rear door, in the alley. A drug dealer in
a hooded Boston Bruins jacket emerges from the opposing alley.
He stops a 13 year-old kid. The kid is scared as the drug
dealer slaps him. The kid give him money and the drug dealer
stuffs a small baggie in the boy's shirt. He lets him go and
withdraws into the alley.
As the boys and Rocco watch this from the opposing alley,
they begin to head for them, but Vincenzo's car pulls up
across the street. Rocco stops the boys and denotes Vincenzo.
The boys head in the front door. Rocco moves back into the
alley.
HOTEL ROOM FIRE ESCAPE
BACK ALLEY
DUSK
The Duke is fully naked, except for a hotel blanket which is
wrapped around his waist, sitting on the fire escape. He
smiles and is still misty-eyed as he beholds the sun setting.
Scattered around him are all the furnishings of freedom;
Snickers bars, all kinds of empty candy wrappers, Coke cans,
and many assorted magazines.
SUBURBAN BEAVER CLEAVER-TYPE HOUSE
DUSK
Rocco waits in a late model Chevelle in front of a white
house. A man exits the house and walks across the sprawling
front lawn. Rocco leans over and says How ya doin', man?
The man doesn't respond and sits in the passenger seat.
During the following scenes we FLASHCUT between bits of
Rocco's experience that night to the coffee house and catch
bits of dialogue as he explains.
ROCCO
The guy never says a fuckin' word to
me. We're driving for 25 minutes.
Never a sigh, no throat clearing,
nothing. And his face, blank man.
Just nothing there.
DECREPIT HOUSE

FLASHCUT: They pull up to a house in a scummy, Boston Logan
Airport neighborhood. Rocco gets out and sits on the hood

BACK FACTORY LOT
NIGHT
Rocco's face is now expressionless as the two load the last
body in the furnace and toss the dog in, unloading from
Rocco's trunk. They shut the furnace door and there is just
the low hum of a furnace and the light wind blowing.
THE MAN
I have a poker game at the house
every Saturday with a couple of guys
you know. Why don't you come down?
Wife makes a hell of a bar-g-que.
ROCCO

Yeah... yeah, I'd like that. Tell me
something. What did they do?
THE MAN
I don't know.
BACK TO PRESENT
BOSTON SUBURBAN BEAVER-CLEAVER TYPE HOUSE
SAME DAY
5:00 P.M.
Smecker sits on the balls of his fee on a sprawling front
lawn. He looks out to the street and sees a forensics
technician kneeling before a new, gray Ford Taurus riddled
with bullet holes. The man marks a sea of different-sized
bullet casings that stretch for thirty-five feet down the
sidewalk. He circles two blood stains on the side walk with
orange chalk.
Smecker turns and looks at the front of the house. It is
peppered with bullet holes, all seemingly concentrated on
the front stoop area. Men try to lift blood samples off the
white paint around the door. He stands and Dolly, Duffy and
Greenly are ready with pens and notebooks behind him.
SMECKER
Okay. Here's what happened.
FLASHBACK
SUBURBAN BEAVER CLEAVER TYPE HOUSE
DAY
Connor, Murphy, and Rocco make a frenzied exit from the van
and walk across the front lawn, each carrying a black duffle
bag and clutching a mask. The garage is opened a crack.
They pull it up all the way. The sun shines in on Smecker
who stands there smoking.
BACKYARD
DAY
They walk with the terrified woman around the pool to a steel
door pool house entrance. There is a number pad next to the
door. Rocco positions her in front of it.
ROCCO
Don't fuck with me lady. I'll kill
you.
She slowly punches in the numbers. Smecker is standing there
smoking.
SMECKER
The wife says she doesn't know what
happened after she hit the code. She
just remembers going down. But,
judging by the burn mark on her back,
I think what they did...
Rocco pulls a stun gun and zaps her with it. She goes down.
SMECKER
...was use a stun gun on her.
Connor reaches for the knob but Rocco stops him. They wait,
guns drawn and focus on the door knob.
SMECKER
Now the guy knows a friend is coming
to the game. And they know that this
door can only be opened from the
inside. So they wait... and when
that door opens, man...
The knob turns and they kick it in.
SUBURBAN "BEAVER CLEAVER" TYPE HOUSE
FRONT LAWN
DAY
Smecker stands in the middle of the front lawn. His hair is
a mess. He's chain-smoking. His clothes are disheveled.
His eyes are psychotic. He points to the parked Taurus as
six men in dark suits appear in a fuzzy, out-of-focus shot.
They line up shoulder to shoulder on the sidewalk.
SMECKER
They exited out the front door. And
they had no fucking idea what they
were in for.
SUBURBAN "BEAVER CLEAVER" TYPE HOUSE
FRONT LAWN
DAY
Rocco, Connor and Murphy walk toward the front door.
SUBURBANK "BEAVER CLEAVER" TYPE HOUSE
SIDEWALK
DAY
(Slo-mo) Two black leather boots slowly walk up the sidewalk
and stop in front of the new, gray Ford Taurus then turn
toward the house. Il Duce removes a white balloon filled
with a few ounces of fluid from the pocket of his black trench
coat. He throws it on the walk, the blood splatters. He picks
up the remnants of the balloon and puts them back in his
pocket and stands there waiting, looking at the house.
SUBURBAN "BEAVER CLEAVER" TYPE HOUSE
FRONT STOOP
DAY
The boys come out, Rocco in the middle and slightly ahead of
them. They look out to the walk, stunned.
SMECKER
Now they are staring at six guys
with guns drawn. It was a fucking
ambush.
Our three heroes stand, their jaws dropping as their point
of view reveals the Il Duce, standing alone, his hands folded
in front of him.
Suddenly, he throws open his trench coat to reveal a special
leather vest beneath. Six guns, all different, are holstered
on the front of it: three on each side extend from just below
his collar bones to his abdomen. Connor and Murphy don't
hesitate. They each draw one of their now unsilenced guns
from their shoulder holsters and aim, one arm over each of
Rocco's shoulders. The Duke draws his top two weapons and
aims.
SMECKER
And this was a fucking bomb dropping
in Beaver Cleaverville! For a few
seconds this place was Armageddon!
There was a fire fight!
They all start shooting at once. The noise is deafening.
The Taurus is being pierced and the front of the house is
splintering as it is riddled with bullets. Smecker is still
in the middle, hands raised to the heavens, turning circles.
Rocco's pinky finger gets shot off, sending blood splattering
against the house. He dives in the bushes reeling. He pulls
a gun and starts firing.
Murphy catches a bullet in the arm and dives for the bushes
as well. Il Duce with lightening speed, drops the guns and
pulls the next two down as he walks to his right about ten
feet. He commences firing and the casings hit the sidewalk,
all different calibers and sizes are dropping down the walk.
It's him and Connor and nobody is backing down. They both
grind their teeth as they fire rapidly at each other. At the
same moment, The Duke gets hit in the arm and Connor takes a
bullet in the leg. The firing ceases for a moment.
Connor remains steady and Il Duce looks down at his arm and
his own blood splattered on the sidewalk.
IL DUCE
No!... No! No!...
He drops the guns and pulls the last two as he moves to the
right. He fires with wrath as he screams the word No over
and over. Rocco and Murphy return fire from the bushes yelling
and swearing, as Connor does the same from his position on
the stoop.
The Duke turns and runs, leaving a sea of casings, and guns
that extend for 35 feet down the walk. There are also two
blood stains.
In a frenzy the boys and Rocco get up and withdraw some spray
bottles from their bags. The begin spraying all their own
blood stains on the stoop and the front of the white house.
They then pick up their things and run off.
FRONT LAWN
DAY
Smecker comes back to reality and lights a cigarette in front
of Dolly, Duffy, and Greenly.
GREENLY
What if it was just one guy with six
guns?
SMECKER
Why don't you let me do the thinking,
huh, genius?
He turns to the forensics guys at the front of the house and
begins to walk over to him.
SMECKER
What is taking so long with those
blood samples?
FORENSICS WOMAN #1
I can't get a good sample. There is
variable here I'm not seeing.
Smecker puts his finger through a big blood stain on the
door and smells it.
SMECKER
(in shock, and rage)
They used ammonia... none of this
shit is any good... Fuck... You know
what this means?! Even if we get
suspects in this case, we got
nothing... Nothing!
He starts kicking the bushes and trying to tear them with
his hands as he rages. The police and forensics all back
off.
SMECKER
(screaming)
Who the fuck are they?! I've never
seen any-fucking-thing like this in
my whole fucking life. Who the fuck
are they?!!
He backs against the building and slides down to a sitting
position in the bushes as if he has given up. He raises his
head and there he sees Rocco's pinky finger lying undiscovered
in the bushes. He pulls a small plastic bag from his pocket
and scoops it up. He shoves it back into his pocket and races
off.
DUFFY
What? That's it?!

We're on the lamb.
STREET IN FRONT OF THE GAY BAR
EARLY MORNING
Smecker staggers out of the bar. He is an absolute wreck.
Rocco exits a package store just down the street. He is
opening a new pack of cigarettes. He is surprised when he
sees Smecker at the other end of the block. He follows the
stumbling agent, fumbling for his gun.
STREET IN FRONT OF CHURCH
EARLY MORNING
Paul sees a church and reflects for a moment before crossing
the street and going in, Rocco a safe distance behind.
