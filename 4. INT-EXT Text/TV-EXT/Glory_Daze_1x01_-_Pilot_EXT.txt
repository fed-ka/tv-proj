A Chrysler Town and Country station wagon drives down State 
Street at the University of Wisconsin on a beautiful Fall 
day. The college town bustles at the start of a new school 
year and, judging by the cars, the big hair and the acid-wash 
jeans, this is clearly a different era. 1985 to be exact.


Still screaming, the Harringtons jump from the car, staring 
at the body on the windshield...

GERRY
Oh my God! I ve killed her! I ve 
killed her!

Joel picks a PLASTIC LEG off the ground, handing it to his 
shocked father.

JOEL
Yeah. You killed a mannequin, Dad.

MIKE RENO, a Junior in a rumpled Hawaiian shirt, hustles over 
from a nearby fraternity BBQ...

RENO
Whoa...Barbara! There you are!

Oh, thank God...

RENO
Have you been in that tree all 
summer, you little minx?

Gerry awkwardly hands Barbara s torn off leg to Reno.

GERRY
Sorry about your, um... friend.

JOEL
So Dad, is this a bridge or a door?

As a CROWD of STUDENTS begin to applaud, Joel can only bury 
his face in his hands... welcome to college.

ACT ONE


BRIAN VANDERGRIFF, a tall, athletic Freshman and a 
quintessential California golden-boy, walks towards the dorms 
with a large bag slung over his shoulder. Walking with him is 
COACH D AMATO, head coach of the baseball team.

COACH D AMATO
Technically, NCAA rules prohibit me 
from saying this, but I want 
baseball getting your full 
attention. Classes...ideally you 
should attend, yes. But, you ve got 
to have priorities in life. 

BRIAN
Well, if my dad taught me one 
thing, it s that playing ball comes 
first, second and third.

COACH D AMATO
Smart man. My dad took me to a 
whore house when I was 12 to teach 
me the difference between sex and 
love. (beat) Aren t dads great?

Brian. around arm his puts he as up, chokes D Amato Coach

COACH D AMATO
We re going to do big things 
together, kid.

BRIAN
wait... can t I

But, as the words leave his mouth, Brian is already making 
eye contact with two hot girls. All he does is smile and they 
immediately swoon...

HOT GIRL #1
Oh, my God. Does he look just like 
C. Thomas Howell? Or am I dreaming?

HOT GIRL #2
Only if you re having the exact 
same dream I am.


Mike Reno (from opening), and several MEMBERS of the Omega 
Chi house are gathered in lawn chairs drinking beers. A movie 
 against PORN 70 s of masterpiece lost a illuminates projector
the wall of a neighboring building.

Suddenly, Damon appears on the roof, holding the beer.

DAMON
Reno, I can t believe what I m 
seeing here.

RENO
Tell me about it. Video didn t just 
kill the radio star. 
(eyes on the movie)
(MORE)10.

RENO (CONT'D)
Oh, to live in the days when 
pornographers were still 
filmmakers...

DAMON
Are you insane? National s all over 
our ass, they re sending an Alumni 
Advisor to monitor us  - and you ve 
got beer coming out of our faucets, 
and graphic imagery projected onto 
the side of a public building.

RENO
You say that like it s a bad thing.

DAMON
At least tell me you got the Rush 
Pamphlets printed up...

RENO
Rush pamphlets?

OFF Damon s look of horror...

RENO (CONT D)
I m kidding. Relax. The Pamphlets 
are under control. The right guys 
for this house are out there... and 
plan. a got Reno s

DAMON
That s what I m afraid of.


A beautiful fall morning. The campus is bustling with the 
excitement and energy of the first day of classes. Joel walks 
across campus with determined strides.


Joel emerges from his class in a blank haze.

CHRISTIE (V.O.)
Wow, that was a good time...

Joel turns to see Christie smiling at him.

JOEL
You didn t have fun? Weird. I had a 
blast. And, I m pretty sure I made 
a great first impression.

CHRISTIE
On me or the professor?

Christie s laugh let s him off the hook.

CHRISTIE
Sorry for getting you busted. But 
seriously, I m not the first girl 
you ve sat next to, right?

JOEL
No, St. Ignacius Boys Prep had lots 
of girls. I sat next to them all.

 the for And, laugh. great a it s Damn,  again. laughs She
first time since he saw her, Joel finally relaxes.

CHRISTIE
That s great. Because I sat next to 
a ton of guys at Marymount Girls 
Academy.

They walk past students trumpeting various issues of the day: 
 guy, one even Ethiopia...there s feed banners, anti-apartheid
 Grow  Hemp! - reading sign a holding time, his of ahead way
it, wear it, smoke it!   

And then some TABLES where FRATERNITIES and SORORITIES are 
passing out rush pamphlets.

CHRISTIE
You joining a fraternity?17.


JOEL
No...I think I might be more of a 
guy who stands on his own. Doesn t 
run with a herd.  

CHRISTIE
Huh, a lone wolf...

JOEL
It s just a theory. Haven t worked 
it all the way through yet.

CHRISTIE
Well, you keep working on it, I ve 
got to get to my next class. We re 
supposed to meet in the technology 
lab to discover the future of 
letter writing. Something called 
mail .  electronic

They both laugh.

JOEL
retarded. That s

CHRISTIE
I know, right? (beat) I ll see you 
around, Lone Wolf.

JOEL
Definitely. I ll save you a seat...

Joel waves to her and watches as she disappears into the sea 
of students. What a day...


Joel runs down the street with a hastily tied neck-tie and a 
rumpled blazer. He spots the group of Freshman up ahead...

JOEL
Guys...hey, wait up! Hold on!

Brian, Eli, Jason and Chang turn to him.

JOEL
Maybe it wouldn t hurt to give this 
fraternity thing a look.

As his new friends give him high fives and pats on the back, 
Jason steps to the front of the group. Holding up a stack of 
Rush PAMPHLETS, it s clear he s ready to lead...

JASON
Okay, gentlemen, now that we re 
ready to make this official, here s 
everything you need to know about 
every house on this campus. 
Strengths, weaknesses, academic 
ranking, athletic prowess, 
prestigious alumni - I ve got it 
all right here. Now, keep in mind, 
some houses might be better for you 
than others. Obviously I m a Delta 
Sig guy...

CHANG
What do you have in there about the 
Asian fraternity?

Surprised, Jason flips through his stack of brochures...20.


JASON
(confused)
Are you sure there is one?


Chang, Eli, Jason, Joel and Brian stand in front of a 
nondescript house a few blocks away from fraternity row. The 
curtains are drawn, hardly seems to be any sign of life. 

Chang holds a scrap of paper, an address written on it.

JOEL
Is anyone even in there?

CHANG
They re probably studying. Dammit, 
I can t believe my dad s making me 
do this. I want to drink beer and 
meet girls, not hang around 
clicking chopsticks and building 
robots with a bunch of Asian nerds. 

ELI
That s kind of a gross stereotype, 
it? isn t

CHANG
Not when an Asian says it. (beat, 
sighs) I ll just go in and look 
around...at least that way I can 
tell my father I tried. You guys go 
up. catch I ll ahead.

As Chang trudges off towards the house...

ELI
Imagine a father forcing a kid to 
do something against his will.

BRIAN
Could be worse. He could be making 
him play baseball.

CLOSE ON - Chang as he knocks on the door of the Asian 
fraternity. The door opens slowly and an ASIAN FRATERNITY 
BROTHER opens the door.

CHANG
Hi, I m Peter Chang. My father gave 
me this address...21.


The Fraternity Brother pokes his head out and glances around, 
then pulls Chang inside...the whole time, never opening the 
door wider than a few feet.


Jason, Eli, Joel and Brian walk down the sidewalk.23.


JASON
What the hell were you thinking? I 
got ignored at the Jewish house, 
you don t see me farting about it.

Eli shrugs, unapologetically...

ELI
We all have different ways of 
expressing ourselves. (beat) Come 
on, those guys were a-holes and you 
know it. I m pretty sure I saw a 
picture of Hitler hanging in the 
library.

JOEL
They did kind of suck, Jason.

JASON
Two U.S. Senators does not suck.

BRIAN
We can debate their level of 
suckiness later. Right now, we 
agreed to check out all the houses 
together.

JASON
Fine. We re doing that. And this is 
the only house we haven t been 
to...

Jason stops in front of the Omega Chi house, which beats and 
pulses with the excitement of a massive party. Drunk coeds 
are streaming through the front door and the balconies are 
 Ranch   Cadillac Springsteen s Bruce revellers. with crowded
blares from inside the walls...

The guys stare up at the house, while Jason flips through his 
stack of Rush Pamphlets...pausing when he gets to the Omega 
Chi pamphlet, a simple hand scrawled message: Join or Die. 

JASON
This place is a joke. Look at their 
pamphlet. No achievements, no 
awards...the whole inside is blank.

From a nearby bush, comes a sudden rustling, then Mike Reno 
pops out with a gorgeous Sophomore GIRL. Leaves in both their 
hair, she s hastily buttoning her shirt...

RENO
The inside of the pamphlet is empty 
for a reason, gentlemen. 
(MORE)24.

RENO (CONT'D)
The future has yet to be written. 
The blank page is for you to fill 
in.

ELI
Wow... I like the sound of that...

RENO
Do you? Good. Because the other 
explanation was that I just forgot 
to have anything printed up on the 
inside. Either way, why don t you 
boys come inside and join the 
festivities?

His arm around the Sophomore girl, Reno starts up the front 
steps. The boys following close behind...

RENO
By the way, my name is Mike Reno. 
Most people call me Reno. And 
this...this is Caroline.

The Sophomore Girl rolls her eyes.

SOPHOMORE GIRL
Allison.

RENO
(unfazed)
Most people call her Allison.

Reno opens the doors to the house, revealing...


Joel, Jason and Brian hurry across campus, approaching 
Heritage Hall, just as the sun is starting to rise.

JASON
What kind of trouble did this idiot 
get himself into?

JOEL
I have no idea. I only know what 
was on the message.

JASON
And how come he didn t leave me 
anything? Brian, you get the 
lambskins. Joel gets the 
lotion...what do I get?

BRIAN
I m more than happy to pass on the 
lambskins.

JOEL
And you can always help look after 
Chang...

Brian suddenly puts out a hand and stops them.

BRIAN
good. be can t This41.


He points to a HEISMAN TROPHY, the greatest award in college 
football, now lodged face down in the grass...obviously 
thrown from a great height. Their eyes all travel upwards, 
where they see a shattered second floor window...

JOEL/BRIAN/JASON
Oh no...


Jason and Brian try the big glass entrance doors.

JASON
locked. it s Dammit,

Joel calls out to them from the side of the building...

JOEL
Hey, over here...there s a broken 
window. This must be how he got in.

Jason and Brian hurry over, as Joel lifts the window until 
its all the way open.

JOEL
Okay, guys...after you.

JASON
Are you serious? We re really going 
in here?


Joel, Jason, Brian and Eli are in their underwear, descending 
the side of the building on a rope made from their tied 
together clothing. Brian has the painting slung over his  
shoulder and, as they make it to the ground, it briefly seems 
like the greatest adventure four Freshman could ever have.

JOEL
Oh my God...I can t believe that 
worked!

faces fall, as campus police cars skid to a stop, surrounding

END OF ACT FOUR46.


ACT FIVE


Jason, Joel, Eli and Brian exit the jail in the company of an 
unhappy Coach D Amato... Joel is still limping.

BRIAN
Really appreciate you helping us 
out like this, Coach.

COACH D AMATO
Yeah, well...all my players get one 
pass from me. Especially a guy with 
a 95 mph fastball...

 never Brian...who d to surprise with look Eli and Jason Joel,
mentioned how good he actually was. Brian shrugs sheepishly, 
as Coach D Amato pulls him off to the side...

COACH D AMATO
Look, Brian...when I walked out of 
that whorehouse, a 12 year old boy 
with a newly christened pecker, my 
daddy gave me some powerful advice. 
He said -  Son, you ll always be 
judged by the company you keep.  

BRIAN
I thought he was trying to teach 
you the difference between sex and 
love...

The Coach pauses for a beat, then shrugs...

COACH D AMATO
Different day, different lesson. 
The point is, you ve got a golden 
ticket in this left arm of yours. 
So, I ll ask you one question? You 
think hanging around guys like this 
is a good idea? Trust me, it s not.

MONTAGE:

CAMPUS - DAY

Joel sits at a table, reading for one of his classes, when  
he sees Christie hugging a group of cute girls in her new 
pledge class. They all have pledge badges. Watching from 
afar, he couldn t seem more alone.

PROFESSOR HAINES (O.S.)
BLOOD SUCKING CAPITALIST PIGS!!

Joel turns to the NOISE.  On his knees, Professor Haines has 
his arm shoved deep inside a VENDING MACHINE.

PROFESSOR HAINES
...give me my 50 cents or release 
my Twinkie!


 sweating He s  barrel. training a into FASTBALLS whips Brian
 he s like harder, and harder coming pitch Each profusely.
trying to work something out from deep within...


Jason sits on a bench, holding a bouquet of flowers. He sees 
Julie approaching and jumps up...

JASON
(hopeful)
Julie, hi. I ve been looking all 
over for you. I got you these...

He extends the flowers, but Julie ignores them. Instead, she 
opens her coat, reveals a YALE T-shirt, then gives Jason the 
MIDDLE FINGER. She continues walking, leaving Jason crushed. 51.



A giant bonfire rages on the sand and our freshman pledges 
stand at nervous attention, shoulder to shoulder, while Turbo 
paces back and forth, like a boot camp drill sergeant.

TURBO
Your lives belong to us now! If I 
want my butt wiped at 3am on a 
Wednesday, one of you better be 
there to do it! Is that 
understood?!

PLEDGES
Yes, sir!!

TURBO
Good! (beat, softening) By the way, 
just to be clear, I will never ask 
you to wipe my butt. 
(MORE)56.

TURBO (CONT'D)
I will ask a lot, but nothing 
involving my butt. Do you 
understand?!

PLEDGES
Yes, sir!

Turbo then goes to the bonfire and pulls a GLOWING Omega 
BRANDING IRON from the flames.

TURBO
Now, for the most important ritual 
of pledgeship.

Turbo pulls down one side of his pants below his hip, 
revealing an Omega brand on his right butt cheek.

TURBO
Every brother in this house carries 
this symbol of commitment...

The pledges gulp in apprehension. Jason, Brian, Eli, Joel - 
each privately wondering...what have I gotten myself into?

TURBO
How bad do you want to be in this 
fraternity, gentlemen? Is it just a 
social outlet for you?(screaming) 
Or do you really want it?!!!

ELI
YES! I WANT IT!!

Eli suddenly grabs the brand from Turbo and presses it 
against his own bare butt. He SCREAMS - half pain/half 
euphoric joy - a SEARING sound rises from his burning flesh.  

A collective GASP rises from the actives.  Then:

TURBO
What are you doing?! I was messing 
with you!  Mine s fake.  It s drawn 
on in pen...

ELI
(weakly)
Fake? Oh no...

Eli collapses to the sand...

ELI
It burns. My butt is burning...57.


 As butt. Eli s on water cold pours and over rushes Someone
steam rises from the seared flesh, cheers and laughter begin 
to slowly erupt...until the tension is completely broken. 

Reno shakes his head and takes a long pull from his beer...

RENO
This is gonna be one special 
group...

As we CRANE UP from the mayhem on the shore of the lake, The 
Clash s FOUR HORSEMEN kicks in and we FADE OUT. 


THE END.
