                        Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz


                                        ACT ONE

      OVER BLACK.  We hear the sound of HEAVY BREATHING and 
      GALLOPING.  FADE UP ON --

      EXT. COUNTRY SIDE - MAGIC HOUR - FAIRY TALE LAND

      A bucolic countryside.  The sun is setting and casting a 
      magical glow over this beautiful stretch of land.  Peaceful.  
      Idyllic.  UNTIL --

      A HORSE breaks into frame.  On its back is a determined MAN.  
    His dress and attire tell us we re somewhere different.  In a 
    far off land.  In another time.  This is PRINCE CHARMING.  
    And he s in a fucking hurry.

      Charming pushes his horse hard, into the WOODS.  He moves 
      through the thick trees.  Dodging branches.  On a MISSION.  
    He reaches a clearing and skids to a halt.  As he dismounts --

                                  SAD VOICE (O.S.)
                    You re too late.

    The Prince strides toward the voice.  And we REVEAL -- a 
      DWARF.  This is DOC.  And yeah -- we re in the midst of a 
      tale we ALL know.  Charming shakes his head at Doc.

                                  CHARMING
                    It s never too late.

    He pushes through into the clearing and comes upon -- A GLASS 
      COFFIN.  Surrounding the coffin are the other SIX DWARVES.  
      They slowly part, revealing... in the coffin...

      SNOW WHITE.  Beautiful.  Dark haired.  Eyes closed.  Hands 
      folded over her chest.  DEAD.  Charming s eyes well up.  He 
      can t believe it.

                                  CHARMING
                    No.  No.NO!

    He moves to the coffin s side.  Kneels down in front of it as 
    the TEARS stream down his cheeks.  We SIT ON HIM in his 
      MOMENT of GRIEF.  And then -- he barks at the dwarves --

                                  CHARMING
                    Open it.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    2.

      CONTINUED:

    Doc gently places a hand on the Prince s shoulder.

                                  DOC
                    There s nothing you can do. 

      Charming fills with resolve.

                                  CHARMING
                    OPEN IT.  

                                  DOC
                    I m sorry...  she s gone.

      Charming slowly unclenches his fists.  Realizes he s right.  
      There s no fighting this.  Sadly, he looks at Doc.

                                  CHARMING
                    At least let me say goodbye.

    Doc nods.  Then slowly OPENS the glass case.  Charming leans 
      over and softly kisses Snow White s lips.  

      A SHOCK OF ENERGY.  He pulls back, startled.  And now we 
      witness pure unadulterated MAGIC as --

      SNOW WHITE S eyes flutter open.  Yes folks, TRUE LOVE is 
      showing its power.  Snow smiles as she sits up, groggy, and 
      sees her Prince.

                                  SNOW
                    You... you found me.

    And now Charming s tears move from grief to JOY.

                                  CHARMING
                    Did you ever doubt I would?

      Snow looks around at her surroundings, smiles wryly.

                                  SNOW
                      Truthfully?  The glass coffin gave 
                    me pause.

                                  CHARMING
                          (smiles back)
                    Well you never have to worry.  I 
                    will alwaysfind you.

      BEAT.  Snow White drinks this in.  And more than anything 
      else.  She BELIEVES it.  She stares into his eyes.  Fully, 
      deeply, in LOVE.  Charming takes her hand, stands.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    3.

      CONTINUED:

                                  SNOW
                    Do you promise?

    NOW WE RE SUPER TIGHT ON CHARMING S FACE.

                                  CHARMING
                    I do.

      PULL BACK.  And suddenly we re not in the forest anymore.  
      Charming is making this proclamation SOMEWHERE ELSE --

      INT. BALLROOM - CASTLE - EVENING - FAIRY TALE LAND

      We re inside a BALLROOM.  Snow White wears a white gown.  
      PULL BACK to see she s standing opposite Charming, in formal 
      attire.  A BISHOP stands between them.

      This is their wedding.  Snow White smiles at his  I do.   We 
      WIDEN FURTHER TO SEE we re at the most lavish, opulent fairy 
      tale wedding our budget will afford us.  All the subjects of 
    the kingdom are assembled. 

                                  BISHOP
                    And do you, Snow White, promise to 
                    take this man to be your husband 
                    and love him for all eternity?

                                  SNOW
                    I do.

                                  BISHOP
                    I now pronounce you man and wife.

    The ORCHESTRA starts to play as the assembled crowd CHEERS.  

                                  BISHOP
                    I believe you know what comes next.

      They lean into one another for what promises to be the 
      storybook kiss to end all storybook kisses.  And, just as 
      their lips are about to touch --

      KERRRRRR-ACCCCCCCCK!  THUNDER BOOMS!  Charming and Snow 
      freeze.  Lips millimeters apart.  The orchestra stops.  
      Everyone turns to see --

      LIGHTNING FLASH through the stain glassed windows.  And then 
      more THUNDER.  And then the doors at the far end of the 
      BALLROOM fly open.  Entering, wearing a flowing black gown, 
      is...

    THE EVIL QUEEN.  But this queen isn t the hunched hag we 
      remember from fairy tale lore.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    4.

      CONTINUED:

      She s BEAUTIFUL -- yet still terrifying.  She carries herself 
      with casual menace as she strides up the aisle toward the 
      dais.  Those assembled GASP in fear, parting like the red 
      sea, lest her gaze fall upon them.

                                  QUEEN
                    Sorry I m late.

      THREE of the PRINCE S GUARDS rush at the Queen.  She casually 
      waves her hands at them, Jedi-style.  And WHAM --

      They re THROWN up in the air and RIGHT THROUGH THE STAINED 
      GLASS WINDOWS.  The Queen keeps marching right up toward 
      Charming and Snow.  Doc turns in fear to his compatriots -- 

                                  DOC
                    It s the Queen.  Run!

      Snow White s face tightens.  Fills with resolve.

                                  SNOW
                    She s not a Queen anymore.  She s 
                    nothing more than an evil witch!

      Snow reaches for Charming s belt and PULLS OUT HIS SWORD.  
      Points it at the Queen and steps forward.  Shit.  This Snow 
      White is a BAD ASS.  But Charming BLOCKS her way.

                                  CHARMING
                    No.  Don t stoop to her level.  
                    There s no need.  She s powerless 
                    now.

      Charming turns to face the Queen who stands at the base of 
    the dais.  Smiling malevolently up at them.

                                  CHARMING
                    I will not let you ruin this 
                    wedding.  You re wasting your time, 
                    you ve already lost. 

    The Queen speaks with a deceptively sweet tone.

                                  QUEEN
                    I m not here to ruin anything.  On 
                    the contrary, dear... I ve come to 
                    give you a gift.

                                  SNOW
                    We want nothing from you.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    5.

      CONTINUED:

                                  QUEEN
                    But you shall have it.  My gift to 
                    you is this happy, happy day.  
                    Enjoy it.  Because tomorrow is the 
                    beginning of the end.

      More GUARDS rush in toward the Queen.  She s unaffected.  
      Holds her ground as they surround her, swords drawn.

                                  QUEEN
                    For tomorrow my real work begins.  
                    You ve made your vows.  Now I make 
                    mine.  
                            (pointsright at them)
                    I shall destroy your happiness if 
                    it s the last thing I do. 

      Charming s had enough, he grabs the sword back from Snow.  He 
      HURLS it at the Queen.  And just as it s about to hit her --

      PPPPOOOOOOOOOOOOF!  A PUFF OF SMOKE ENVELOPS the Queen and 
    she DISAPPEARS.

    The SWORD SLAMS into the FLOOR, lodging itself in the wood.  
      Vibrating back and forth as the smoke settles.  Charming 
      turns to his new bride, tries to calm Snow.

                                  CHARMING
                    It s over.  She s gone.

    He pulls her into an embrace.  But Snow is not placated.  All 
    she can do is stare at the dissipating smoke, uneasy.  

    We HOLD ON this troubled tableaux.  The horrific proclamation 
    of the Queen hangs in the air as we FREEZE FRAME on a deeply 
      disturbed SNOW WHITE.  And SLOWLY the IMAGE MORPHS into a 
      DRAWING.  We realize we re looking at --

      INT. GREYHOUND BUS - BOSTON - NIGHT

      A PICTURE.  In a book. Intricately detailed on yellowed 
      paper.  This is an OLD BOOK.  And this drawing is part of a 
      STORY.  OVER THIS we a HEAR MUFFLED VOICE ON A LOUDSPEAKER --

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    Boston.  South Station.  Thank you 
                    for riding Greyhound.

      WIDEN TO SEE we re inside a Greyhound bus arriving in the 
      heart of the city.  And holding this ANCIENT TOME?  





                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    6.

      CONTINUED:

      A ten year old BOY.  HENRY.  Mop of blond hair.  Sweet face.  
    But a sparkle of mischief in him.  He closes the book.  Puts 
    it in a backpack and exits the bus with the other passengers.

      EXT. SOUTH STATION - NIGHT

      Busy early evening pedestrian traffic moves to and fro as we 
      STAY on HENRY, drinking in the big city sights.  It s a 
      little seedy.  Rough.  But it doesn t bother him.  Behind 
      him, an OLD WOMAN steps off the bus.  She sees Henry all 
      alone.  Walks up, concerned. 

                                  OLD WOMAN
                    Are you lost, honey?

      Henry looks up at the kindly woman and smiles.

                                  HENRY
                    Oh no, I m fine.

    But the old woman isn t so sure.  She s nervous for this kid.

                                  OLD WOMAN
                    You re travelling alone?  All the 
                    way from Maine?

                                  HENRY
                    Do it all the time, was just 
                    visiting my Grandma.

                                  OLD WOMAN
                    Are your parents here to pick you 
                    up?

      Henry looks around.  Nods at a black TOWN CAR at the street 
      exit.  A DRIVER chats on his BLUE TOOTH in the front seat.

                                  HENRY
                    They re off at one of their fancy 
                    balls.  They sent their driver.  
                    That s Albert.  
                          (yellsout)
                    Hey Albert!
                          (then to the woman)
                    Thanks for your concern, ma am.

      Henry heads toward the Town Car.  The old lady shrugs and 
      moves off.  

      STAY ON HENRY.  He walks up to the Town Car.  The driver 
      keeps chatting on his blue tooth.  Henry sneaks a look over 
    his shoulder... the woman is gone... and then --




                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    7.

      CONTINUED:

      Henry walks right PAST the car.  

      Huh.  He heads to the STREET CORNER.  Sees a parked YELLOW 
      CAB.  Henry RAPS on the window.  The driver rolls it down as 
      Henry rifles through his bag and pulls out a VISA.

                                  HENRY
                    You take credit cards?

    The driver nods.  And Henry opens the door.  Gets in.  

                                  CABBIE
                    Where to, kid?

    OFF THIS strange little boy, who is clearly FULL OF SHIT --

      INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

    An upscale Top Chef-ish eatery in a nice neighborhood.  
      Trendy and chic.  A youngish, moneyed crowd dines on stuff 
      with lots of foam on it.  

      Through the front door walks a woman who is, let s not kid 
      ourselves here, a PRESENCE.  This is ANNA SWAN.  Late 20s.  
      Beautiful, with great strength behind classic features.  But 
      also not quite at home in her skin.  Right now she s dolled 
    up for a night out and looks nervous and vulnerable as she 
      scans the room.  Sees table after table of couples eating and 
      chatting.  Her eyes stop on...

      A TABLE in the corner.  The BEST table.  Sitting there alone 
    is a handsome man.  REAL handsome.  A leading man.  He looks 
    up from his wine.  Spots Anna.  His eyes widen as she 
      saunters across the room.  The man -- RYAN -- rises to greet 
      her.  Pulls out her chair.  She sits.

                                  RYAN
                    ...Anna?

                                  ANNA
                          (nods)
                    ...Ryan?
                          (off his smile and nod)
                    You look relieved.

                                  RYAN
                    Well, it s the internet... pictures 
                    could be...

                                  ANNA
                    Fake?  Outdated?  Stolen from a 
                    Victoria s Secret catalog?




                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    8.

      CONTINUED:

    Ah.  So this is a BLIND INTERNET DATE.  They stare at one 
      another for a long beat.

                                  ANNA
                    So...

                                  RYAN
                    So...  Tell me something about 
                    yourself, Anna.

      Anna leans in, thinks a beat.  Then --

                                  ANNA
                    Well... let s see... today s my 
                    birthday.

                                  RYAN
                    And you re spending it with me?  
                    What, you don t like your family?

                                  ANNA
                    No family to like.

                                  RYAN
                    Oh.  What about your friends?

                                  ANNA
                    I m kind of a loner.

      Ryan smiles, charming --

                                  RYAN
                    Well, Anna, you are by far the 
                    sexiest friendless orphan I ve ever 
                    met.

                                  ANNA
                    Your turn.
                          (he s about to speak, she 
                          cuts him off)
                    No, wait, let me guess.  Let s 
                    see...  You re handsome.  Charming.  

                                  RYAN
                    Go on.  I like this game.

                                  ANNA
                    The kinda guy who -- now stop me if 
                    I get this wrong -- 
                          (the kicker)
                    -- embezzled from your employer, 
                    got arrested, and then skipped town 
                    before they threw your ass in jail?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    9.

      CONTINUED:

      BEAT.  That stops Ryan.  He leans back, put off -- but 
      FUMBLING.

                                  RYAN
                    Uh... what?

      Anna is suddenly SERIOUS as HELL.  Just like that, the 
      coquettish girl is GONE.

                                  ANNA
                    And the worst part of it all is 
                    your wife.  After all this crap she 
                    stillloves you enough to bail you 
                    out.  Of course she could only 
                    scrape together a quarter of the 
                    bail after you emptied the 
                    accounts.  And how do you reward 
                    that loyalty?  You re out on a 
                    date.  

                                  RYAN
                    Who are you?

                                  ANNA
                    The chick who put up the rest of 
                    the money.

                                  RYAN
                    You re a bailbondsman.

                                  ANNA
                      Bailbondsperson.

    And now Ryan bolts away, KNOCKING the table into ANNA.

    ON ANNA -- falling to the ground as Ryan s glass of WINE 
      spills on her dress.  She picks herself up as Ryan runs out 
    the front door.  She stares at her stained dress.

                                  ANNA
                    Really?

    She strides toward the door.  Not running.  Just walking 
      confidently.  The MAITRE D hurries over to her --

                                  MAITRE D
                    Are you alright, Madame?  Should I 
                    call the police?

                                  ANNA
                    Nah, I got it.

      Anna just keeps walking, not even breaking a sweat.                                                                                    10.


      EXT. RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER

      Ryan races out the door and down the block.  Runs to a PARKED 
      AUDI.  Pulls open the door and hops in.  Glances over his 
      shoulder to see -- Anna striding down the block.  Still not 
      running.  Just moving with purpose.  A TERMINATOR in COUTURE.

    ON RYAN.  In the driver s seat.  Sweating.  Fumbles with his 
      keys.  Turns the IGNITION.  Guns the engine, hits the gas --

      KERRRRRRRRACK.  A horrible CRUNCHING sound.  The car stays 
      PUT.  Ryan looks confused, opens the door.  Looks down and 
      sees -- 

      A BOOT on his wheel.  He looks back up and sees -- Anna now 
      standing in front of him.  He gets it -- he s been SET UP.

                                  RYAN
                    You don t have to do this.  I can 
                    pay you.  I ve got money.

    She stares at him for a second -- reading him.  

                                  ANNA
                    No you don t.  And if you did, you 
                    should give it to your wife.  Take 
                    care of your family.

      Realizing he s fucked, Ryan stares at her, filled with venom.

                                  RYAN
                    What do youknow about family?

    And that seems to flip a switch in Anna.  She grabs him by 
    the collar and slams his face into the steering wheel.

          HOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNNNNK.  Ryan slumps back, 
      unconscious.  Anna just stands there for a moment.  Then --

                                  ANNA
                    Nothing.

      INT. ANNA S APARTMENT - BOSTON

    The door opens to a small dingy apartment in a cookie cutter 
      apartment complex.  Anna enters, flips on the lights, 
      illuminating the kind of place you live in because you have 
    to, not because you WANT to.  

    She moves in, still wearing her wine stained dress, but now 
      also carries a brown grocery bag.  She plops the bag down on 
    the table.  Flips on the TV -- the international sign of a 
      lonely person.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    11.

      CONTINUED:

    She then goes to the grocery bag.  Pulls out a CUPCAKE.  
      Places it on a paper plate.  Then pulls out a BOX of BIRTHDAY 
      CANDLES.  She rifles through, finds a BLUE STAR SHAPED 
      CANDLE, and puts it in the cupcake.  

      Anna then takes out a book of matches and lights the candle.  
    She stares at the flickering light.

                                  ANNA
                    Another banner year.

      Anna closes her eyes.  MAKES a WISH.  And BLOWS out the 
      candle.  

      DING DONG.  Anna s eyes fly open.  The smoke wafts away from 
    the cupcake as she moves to the door.

      DING DONG.  It rings again.  She pulls it open to see -- 

    Ten year old HENRY standing in the doorway, backpack slung 
      over his shoulder.  He looks up at her.  His eyes wide.

                                  ANNA
                    Uh... can I help you?

                                  HENRY
                    Are you Anna Swan?

                                  ANNA
                    Yeah.  Who are you?

                                  HENRY
                    My name s Henry.
                          (then; a smile --)
                    I m your son.

    OFF THAT --

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.


                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    12.


                                        ACT TWO

      INT. CASTLE - NURSERY - FAIRY TALE LAND

      CLOSE ON a UNICORN.  Ceramic.  Exquisitely crafted.  On a 
      small wire.  Twirling.  WIDEN TO a DWARF.  Simple face.  
      Never speaks.  This is DOPEY -- and he s hanging a UNICORN 
      MOBILE on the ceiling.  WIDEN FURTHER to see he s on a STEP 
      LADDER.  In the middle of a beautiful and elaborate NURSERY.  
      Ornate crib.  Antique armoire.  Plush toys.  The home every 
      child dreams of.  At the base of the step ladder, holding it 
      steady, is Grumpy.  And he s barking orders at Dopey.    

                                  GRUMPY
                    To the right!  The RIGHT!

      Dopey adjusts the MOBILE, moving it to... the left.

                                  GRUMPY
                    Myright.  Don t push me, Dopey --

      Grumpy catches himself, turns to someone off screen --

                                  GRUMPY
                    I m sorry, Your Highness.  
                          (re: the mobile)
                    Is this all right?

      REVEAL -- standing by the window and staring out in a daze is 
      SNOW WHITE.  Only now she s VERY PREGNANT.  She gently holds 
    her belly.  Doesn t seem to hear anything.

                                  GRUMPY
                    Your Highness?

                                  SNOW
                          (turns around, looks --)
                    It s fine.  Thank you.

      Dopey climbs down from the ladder as another voice pipes in.

                                  CHARMING
                    Fellows, would you give us a 
                    moment, please?

    The dwarves quickly exits as Charming joins Snow by the 
      window.  Gently puts his hand on hers --

                                  CHARMING
                    What s wrong?

                                  SNOW
                    Nothing.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    13.

      CONTINUED:

    But he knows her far too well to buy THAT.

                                  CHARMING
                    You re thinking about what the 
                    Queen said again, aren t you?
                          (her silence answers him)
                    Snow, please... I can t keep having 
                    this conversation.  You have to 
                    stop thinking about it.  We re 
                    about to have a baby.

                                  SNOW 
                    I know.  And I ve dreamed of this 
                    moment my entire life.  I just want 
                    everything to be perfect.  For us.  
                    For our child.

                                  CHARMING
                    It will be.

    And damnit, she wants to believe that.  BUT --

                                  SNOW
                    Will it?  I haven t had a restful 
                    night since the wedding.

                                  CHARMING
                          (shakes his head)
                    That s what she wants.  To get in 
                    your head.  But they were just 
                    words.  She can t hurt us.

                                  SNOW
                    She poisoned an apple because she 
                    thought I was prettierthan her.  
                    You have no idea of what she s 
                    capable of.

      Charming frowns, the memory is INTENSE FOR HIM, TOO --

                                  CHARMING
                    I thought you were dead... I ve got 
                    a pretty good idea of what she s 
                    capable of.

                                  SNOW
                    Then maybe we should stop ignoring 
                    her.

      Charming feels her frustration.  Just wants to HELP.

                                  CHARMING
                    What can I do to ease your mind?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    14.

      CONTINUED:

      Snow looks him in the eye.  She s been thinking about this.

                                  SNOW
                    Let me talk to him.

      BEAT.  The music kicks in.  Pulsating.  What was just a nice 
      intimate scene is suddenly... OMINOUS.

                                  CHARMING
                    Him.  You don t mean --

                                  SNOW
                    I do.

    And by the stricken look on Charming s face.  He doesn t like 
      whoever this  him  is.  He just shakes his head.

                                  CHARMING
                    No.  It s too dangerous.

                                  SNOW
                    He sees the future.

                                  CHARMING
                    There s a reason he s locked up.

    She takes his hands into her own, pleads.

                                  SNOW
                    Do you really want to gamble with 
                    our child s future?

    And Charming?  Can t argue that.  BEAT.  Then he nods.

                                  CHARMING
                    Alright.  For our child.

    OFF CHARMING, considering their CHILD S FUTURE -- CUT TO -- 

      INT. ANNA S APARTMENT - BOSTON

      HENRY saunters by Anna, who stands in her doorway.  
      Absolutely FUCKING STUNNED.  Henry takes in the place.

                                  ANNA
                    What re you doing here?

                    I don t have a son.  Where are your

                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    15.

                                  HENRY
                    Ten years ago, did you give up a 
                    baby for adoption?

      BEAT.  Anna stops short.  And her shock tells us everything.

                                  HENRY
                    That was me.
                          (then)
                    You gonna eat that cupcake?

      Henry doesn t really wait for an answer, grabs it and takes a 
      a bite.  Anna stares him down -- not liking this at all.

                                  ANNA
                    How did you find me?

                                  HENRY
                    I m resourceful.  This isn t going 
                    the way I thought it would.

                                  ANNA
                    And how did you think it would go?

                                  HENRY
                    If this were Oprah, there d be 
                    lotsa crying and hugging.

                                  ANNA
                    I m not the hugging and crying 
                    type.

                                  HENRY
                    Everyone is.  Just give it time.
                          (then)
                    We should probably get going.

    ON ANNA -- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS KIDS TALKINGABOUT?

                                  ANNA
                    Going... where?

                                  HENRY
                    I want you to come home with me.

    And now Anna s been pushed to the limit.  Fun time is over.

                                  ANNA
                    Okay, kid.  That s it.  I m calling 
                    the cops.

    She lifts up the receiver.  Starts to dial.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    16.

      CONTINUED:

                                  HENRY
                    Great.  And I ll tell them you 
                    kidnapped me.

      THAT STOPS Anna cold.  She looks at this kid for the first 
      time with a mixture of shock and, yeah, a little respect.

                                  ANNA
                    ...What?

                                  HENRY
                    I ll tell them my birth mother 
                    missed me so much she tracked me 
                    down and kidnapped me.  I tried to 
                    fight but she was so much bigger.  
                    So much stronger... 

                                  ANNA
                    You re not gonna do that.

                                  HENRY
                    Try me.

      BEAT.  Anna studies him.  THEN --

                                  ANNA
                    Look kid -- you re pretty good.  
                    But here s the thing.  There s not 
                    a lot I m great at in life.  But I 
                    do have one skill.  One... let s 
                    call it a super power.  Don t know 
                    how it works.  Or why.  But I can 
                    tell when anyoneis lying.   And 
                    you, Henry -- are.

    ON HENRY.  Beat.  His face falls.  He s caught.  And now for 
    the first time, he s SINCERE --

                                  HENRY
                    Please don t call the cops.  Just 
                    come home with me.  Please.

      Anna sees he s upset -- and scared.  Doesn t push it.  

                                  ANNA
                    Maybe you should start by telling 
                    me where home is?

                                  HENRY
                    Storybrooke, Maine.

                                  ANNA
                       Storybrooke? 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    17.

                                  HENRY
                    Yup. 

                                  ANNA
                    Seriously?

                                  HENRY
                    Uh huh.

                                  ANNA
                    Well, alrighty.  Let s get you back 
                    to Storybrooke.

    And as Henry SMILES, MISSION ACCOMPLISHED, we CUT TO --

      INT. BUS STATION - TICKET COUNTER - NIGHT

      A BUS.  The sign reads:  BANGOR, MAINE.   PAN OFF it to see 
      we re back in -- THE BUS STATION.  Anna strides through the 
      terminal with Henry in tow up to the TICKET COUNTER.  Anna 
      turns to the TICKET AGENT.

                                  ANNA
                    One one way child ticket to Bangor, 
                    Maine please.

      Henry frowns, surprised --

                                  HENRY
                    You re not coming with me?

                                  ANNA
                    No I m not coming with you.

                                  HENRY
                    But you have to. 

    The ticket taker cocks an eyebrow at that. 

                                  TICKET TAKER
                    He s travelling alone?

                                  ANNA
                          (don t judge me)
                    Yes.  He s very independent.

      Oooookay.  He backs down.

                                  TICKET TAKER
                    That ll be forty two dollars.

      Anna hands over some cash as he prints out the ticket.  As 
    she gets the change --



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    18.

      CONTINUED:

        WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!  Anna spins to see HENRY CRYING.  
      It s FULL ON WATERWORKS.  And Anna?  She s ill equipped to 
      deal with this.  

                      HENRYANNA
      Mommy, no!
                                                    What re you doing?

                                  HENRY
                    Mommy please don t send me away.  
                    Please!  I m scared!

    Now the ticket taker leans over, disapproving.  Other 
      customers stare.  Anna feels the heat.

                  TICKET TAKERANNA
    Is there a problem, ma am?
                                                  It s fine.

                                  HENRY
                    Mommy, mommy.  I promise to be 
                    good.  Please don t make me get on 
                    the bus!  Pleeeeeeeeeeeasemommy!

      Anna kneels down next to him.  Through gritted teeth --

                                  ANNA
                    If I drive you, will you stop?

      Henry turns off the waterworks in an instant.  GRINS --

                                  HENRY
                      Absolutely.

    She shakes her head, grabs his hand, and exits as we CUT TO --

      EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

      ANNA.  Driving in a yellow  69 VW Bug.  Heading down the long 
      highway between Boston and Maine.  Her face says it all.  She 
      can t believe this is happening.

                                  HENRY (O.S.)
                    You got anything to eat in here?

      Anna turns to see Henry rifling through a BAG in the back.

                                  ANNA
                    Hey.  HEY.  That s my gym bag.  I 
                    don t generally travel with snack 
                    packs.

      Henry turns around, falls back into his seat.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    19.

      CONTINUED:

                                  HENRY
                    We could stop somewhere.

                                  ANNA
                    This isn t a road trip.  We re not 
                    getting snacks.  We re not singing 
                    songs and we re not playing I-Spy. 

                                  HENRY
                          (pouty)
                    Fine.

    He takes out his BOOK.  Opens it to a picture of Snow and 
      Charming.  Anna notices the thing is OLD and HUGE.

                                  ANNA
                    What s that -- ?

      Henry looks up from the book.  Oddly CAUTIOUS here.

                                  HENRY
                    If I told you -- you wouldn t 
                    believe me.

                                  ANNA
                    Why not?

                                  HENRY
                    I m not sure you re ready.

      Anna looks over his shoulder, glimpses SNOW and CHARMING --

                                  ANNA
                    Ready for some fairy tales?

                                  HENRY
                          (SERIOUS now --)
                    They re not fairy tales.  They re 
                    real.  Every story in this book is 
                    true.  It actually happened.  

                                  ANNA
                    Of course it did.

                                  HENRY
                    Use your  super power  and see if 
                    I m lying.

      Anna looks at him.  Shit.  He does seem awfully CONVINCED.

                                  ANNA
                    Just because you believe something 
                    don t make it true.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    20.

                    That s exactlywhat makes it true.  
                    And youshould know that more than 
                    anyone.

                                  ANNA
                    Why s that?

                                  HENRY
                    Because you re in it.

      Anna shoots him a look.  Oooookay.

                                  ANNA
                    Kid, you ve got problems.

                                  HENRY
                    Yup.And you re gonna fix them.

      Anna just shakes her head.  Turns up the music on the RADIO.  
      Henry shrugs.  Returns to his book, which WE PUSH INTO AND  --

      INT. DUNGEON - JAILER S OFFICE - FAIRY TALE LAND

      We re in the  office  of the dungeon s JAILER.  Lit by 
      torches, we see the old JAILER, a serious man ravaged by 
      years of terrible responsibility.  He wears a hooded robe and 
      looks distressed as he greets Snow and Charming.

                                  JAILER
                    M lord, M lady.  In good 
                      conscience, I mustadvise against 
                    this.

                                  SNOW
                    Your objection is noted.

    Her meaning is clear.  Whatever they re here for, they re 
      DOING.  He hands over TWO HOODED ROBES.

                                  JAILER
                    Put these on.  We can t have him 
                    see your faces.

                                  SNOW
                    Why not?

                                  JAILER
                    We must take every precaution.  The 
                    first line of defense is anonymity.

    As they put the ROBES on over their clothes, the jailer pulls 
    up his own hood, obscuring his face, as he explains --



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    21.

                                  JAILER
                    When we approach the cell, stay out 
                    of the light.  And whatever you do, 
                    donotlet him know your name.  
                          (ominous)
                    If he knows your name, he will have 
                    power over you.

      Charming looks to Snow at THAT --

                                  CHARMING
                    Why did I let you talk me into 
                    this?

                                  SNOW
                    Because you love me.

                                  CHARMING
                    My fatal flaw.

    The Jailer levels Snow with a serious GAZE --

                                  JAILER
                    He is right to be wary.  None have 
                    been filled with more regret than 
                    those who have spoken to 
                      Rumplestiltskin.

    And now we know who they re going to see... RUMPLESTILTSKIN.  
      Snow is undeterred.

                                  SNOW
                    I ll take my chances.

      INT. DUNGEON - FAIRY TALE LAND

      INKY BLACKNESS.  Silence.  And then a CLANKING SOUND.  Like a 
      MASSIVE LOCK being turned.  And then we hear the creaking of 
      ancient wood being pulled.  Moonlight spills in and we see 
      we re in a dark, dank hallway.  TORCHLIGHTS enter.  The 
      flames light the musty air, illuminating a narrow cobblestone 
      passageway beneath the castle.  Charming steps in, Snow at 
    his side.  They move through the long hallway, escorted by 
    the jailer.  As they move, we hear OMINOUS WHISTLING.  Snow 
      tries to mask her fear, but this IS getting to her. 

      They reach a CELL at the end of the hall.  Bathed in darkness 
      except for a ribbon of MOON LIGHT that streams in from a lone 
      window.  The ribbon of light forms a dividing line outside 
    the cell, where Snow and Charming wait.  The whistling STOPS.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    22.

                                  JAILER
                      Rumplestiltskin.  I have a question 
                    for you.

    And then an eerie, deranged, VOICE speaks out of the 
      darkness.

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    No you don t.

      From behind the bar, a FIGURE steps forward into the LIGHT, 
      revealing RUMPLESTILTSKIN.  Gnomish, intense, and CRAZY.

                                    RUMPLESTILTSKIN
                    Theydo.  Snow White.  Prince 
                    Charming.  You insult me.  Step 
                    into the light and take off those 
                    ridiculous robes.  If I wanted to 
                    harm you, it would have already 
                    happened.

      Shit.  Snow and Charming step forward.  Lower their hoods. 

                                    RUMPLESTILTSKIN
                    Ah, much better.  

                                  CHARMING
                    We need to ask you about --

                                    RUMPLESTILTSKIN
                    -- Yes, yes, yes.I know why 
                    you re here. 

      Rumple leaps up to his feet with surprising agility.  Slinks 
    to the bars.  Snow steps back.  Charming tenses.  

                                    RUMPLESTILTSKIN
                    It s about the Queen s threat.  You 
                    wish to know if it s empty, yes?  

                                  SNOW
                    Tell us what you know.

                                    RUMPLESTILTSKIN
                    Aren t we tense?  Fear not, for I 
                    can ease your mind.  
                          (beat)
                    But it will cost you something in 
                    return.

                                  CHARMING
                    No.  You re never getting out of 
                    here.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    23.

    And he laughs a maniacal laugh.

                                    RUMPLESTILTSKIN
                    Out!?!  OUT?  It s too late for 
                    that.  What I want -- what I need-- 
                    is something for a rainy day.

                                  CHARMING
                    This is a waste of time --

    But Snow is determined.  Stares right at Rumple.

                                  SNOW
                    What do you want?

      Rumple grins -- the bait is taken.

                                    RUMPLESTILTSKIN
                    The name of your unborn child.

                                  CHARMING
                    Absolutely (fucking) not!

    But Snow -- she needs to know.

                                  SNOW
                    Deal.  Now tell us.

      Charming shoots her a look as Rumple leans up as close to the 
      bars as he can get.  Presses his face between the narrow 
      slit.  Bares his blackened, jagged teeth as he speaks --

                                    RUMPLESTILTSKIN
                    The queen has created a powerful 
                    curse.  And it s coming.  It won t 
                    just affect this land.  It will 
                    touch allthe lands...  Soon there 
                    will be no more magic.  Soon you ll 
                    allbe in a prison.  Just like me.  
                    Only worse.  Your prison -- all of 
                    our prisons -- will be time.  

                                  CHARMING
                    He speaks nonsense.

                                    RUMPLESTILTSKIN
                    If only it were nonsense.  Time 
                    will stop and we will all be 
                    trapped.  Suffering for eternity as 
                    the Queen celebrates.  Victorious 
                    at last.
                          (beat; sinister)
                    No more happy endings.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    24.

                    What... can we do?

                                    RUMPLESTILTSKIN
                    Wecan t do anything.

                                  SNOW
                    Then who can?

      Rumple reaches his hand through the bars.  His long, dirty, 
      fingernails heading for Snow s STOMACH --

                                    RUMPLESTILTSKIN
                    That little thing growing inside 
                    your belly.  

      Charming SWATS his hand back with the butt of his sword.

                                  CHARMING
                    Next time I cut it off.

                                    RUMPLESTILTSKIN
                    Your infant is our only hope.  Get 
                    the child to safety and...

      Rumple CLOSES his EYES.  CONCENTRATES HARD.  Sweat pouring 
      down his brow -- he s LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE.

                                    RUMPLESTILTSKIN
                    ...and... on its twenty-eighth 
                      birthday... the child will return.  
                    The child will find you and...

      Rumple s eyes FLY OPEN.  Bloodshot and insane.

                                    RUMPLESTILTSKIN
                    The final battle will begin.

    Let that sink in.  Digest it.  Believe it.  But Charming 
      shakes his head --

                                  CHARMING
                    I ve heard enough, we re leaving.

    He starts to pull Snow away from the cell.  Rumple starts 
      bouncing up and down.

                                    RUMPLESTILTSKIN
                    Our deal!  We had a deal!  Her 
                    name!  I neeeeeeeed her 
                      naaaaaaaaaame!

      Charming stops short, shakes his head.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    25.

                    to be a boy.

      Rumple ignores him, stares at Snow.

                                    RUMPLESTILTSKIN
                    Missy, you know I m right.  What s 
                    hername?

    As Charming pulls Snow down the hall she stops.  Holds her 
      belly.  And deep down she does know he s right.  She stares 
    at him and answers --

                                  SNOW
                    Anna.  Her name is Anna.

    OFF THAT, SMASH CUT TO --

      INT. ANNA S CAR - HIGHWAY - NIGHT

      ANNA.  Listening to the SONG on the radio.  Driving down the 
      dark highway.  Henry sits with his book.  ON a PICTURE of 
      Snow White and Rumplestiltskin.  He closes the book.  Looks 
    up through the window.  Then at Anna.  He SMILES.

      Anna feels the smile, looks down at him.

                                  ANNA
                    What re you grinning about?

      Henry s smile widens even further.  As if he alone possesses 
      a secret he is just ITCHING to share.  And then, JOYFUL --

                                  HENRY
                    We re here.

      OUTSIDE -- ON THE HIGHWAY. 

    The car WHIZZES by.  CAMERA HOLDS ON -- a sign by the edge of 
    the road.  Wooden.  Old.  And reading:

      INT. CASTLE - WAR ROOM - FAIRY TALE LAND

      CLOSE ON a wood table.  A FIST slams down on it.  It shudders 
      mightily as we ARM UP TO Charming.  FULLY AMPED.

                                  CHARMING
                    I say we fight!

      WIDEN TO REVEAL a  War room.   A council has been assembled.  
      KNIGHTS.  The DWARVES.  The HUNTSMEN.  JIMINY CRICKET (CGI or 
      animated).  Snow sits next to Charming, holding her belly.  
      Looking terribly worried.  The cricket shakes its head.

                                  CRICKET
                    Fighting never accomplished

                    Fighting is not only wrong.  It s 
                    futile.  Perhaps we can negotiate --

                                  CHARMING
                    Clearly you haven t met the Queen.  
                    We need to take her out before she 
                    can inflict her curse.

      MURMURS rise up.  Blood is boiling.  Snow speaks up.

                                  SNOW
                    Jiminy s right.  We can t win.

                    Can we even trust Rumplestiltskin?

                                  CHARMING
                    I sent my men into the forest.  The

                    end of us all.  There must be 
                    something we can do.  Good can t

                    Maybe it can.

      accompanied by his two children.  HANSEL and GRETEL.They 
      HAUL in a LARGE TREE TRUNK.  Plop it on the ground.

                                  BLUE FAIRY
                    The tree is enchanted.  If 
                    fashioned into a vessel it can ward

                          (thick Italian accent)

      Prince Charming looks from her to Snow.  Squeezes her hand.

                    You see -- we re gonna be fine.

                    There is, however, a catch.

      SILENCE.  Isn t there always?  All eyes turn to the fairy.

                                  BLUE FAIRY
                    The tree is indeed powerful.  But 
                    all power has its limits and this 
                    tree can protect only ONE.  

      Prince Charming and Snow White look at one another.  The 
      implication is sinking in just as the Blue Fairy explains --

                                  BLUE FAIRY
                    A choice must be made

    OH FUCK.  Prince Charming looks to his wife.  Being together?  
      Well that s now OUT OF THE QUESTION.  Snow can t bear what 
      this means and looks out the window, into the WOODS, which 
    now DISSOLVE TO --

      EXT. STORYBROOKE- NIGHT

    The WOODS.  PAN OFF the trees to Anna s car driving into this 
      small town.  Surrounded by the forest, Storybrooke, while 
      quaint, definitely has an air of magic to it.  The car heads 
      down the nearly deserted main street into the TOWN SQUARE.  
      Passing shops, a few restaurants, a clock tower.  No chain 
      stores.  This place is its own world.  And right now, it s 
      after midnight and pretty much shut down.

    IN THE CAR.  Anna looks at Henry.  

                                  ANNA
                    Okay, Kid.  How about an address? 

                                  HENRY
                    115 South Not-Telling-You Street.

      Anna s jaw tightens.  She quickly pulls the car over to the 
      side of the street.  Parked in the town square, she confronts 
      Henry.

                                  ANNA
                    Look, kid, it s been a really long 
                    day.  It s... almost... 
                          (looks up at the clock 
                          tower)
                    8:15?

                                  HENRY
                    That clock hasn t moved my whole 
                    life.  Time is frozen here.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    29.

      CONTINUED:

      Anna can t believe how relentless this kid is.

                                  ANNA
                    ...Excuse me?

                                  HENRY
                    The Evil queen cursed the enchanted 
                    forest.  And now everybody who 
                    lived there, is here.  They re 
                    frozen in time.  Stuck in this 
                    town. 

                                  ANNA
                          (dripping sarcasm)
                    Well, isn t that horrible. 
                            (challenging him)
                    Why don t they just leave?

                                  HENRY
                    They can t.  Ask anyone.  See if 
                    they ve ever left.

      Before Anna can challenge him further, a voice from outside 
    the car interrupts.

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    ...Henry?

      They look up to see an eccentric looking gentleman (think 
      Michael Emerson) walking a Dalmation and, oddly, carrying an 
      umbrella.  This is ARCHIE.

                                  ARCHIE
                    What re you doing here?  You missed 
                    our session today.  Is everything 
                    all right?

                                    HENRY
                    I m fine, Archie.

                                  ARCHIE
                          (studies Anna)
                    Who s this?

                                  ANNA
                    Just someone trying to give him a 
                    ride home.  Ya know where he lives?

                                  ARCHIE
                    Sure.  Just up there to the right.  
                    Mayor s house is the biggest house 
                    on Mifflin Street.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    30.

      CONTINUED:

    Now Anna shoots Henry another look.

                                  ANNA
                    You re the Mayor s kid?

                                  HENRY
                          (busted)
                    Maybe.

                                  ANNA
                          (to Archie; smiles)
                    Thank you.

                                  ARCHIE
                    Of course.  Welcome to Storybrooke!

    As they drive off, Henry looks completely defeated.  Anna 
      checks out Archie in her rear view mirror.

                                  ANNA
                    He didn t seem cursed to me.

      That s it.  Henry s had enough.  He blurts out --

                                  HENRY
                    Because he doesn t know.  None of 
                    them do.  They don t remember who 
                    they are.  It s part of the curse.  

                                  ANNA
                      Convenient.  So which fairy tale 
                    was he?

                                  HENRY
                    Jiminy Cricket.

    OH.  YEAH.  That voice DID sound familiar.

                                  ANNA
                    Right.  The umbrella.  How did I 
                    not catch that?

    OFF ANNA, this kid s got a real imagination, UPCUT TO --

      EXT. MAYOR S HOUSE - NIGHT

      Mifflin street.  A cul de sac lined with large homes.  The 
      largest, and most inviting, is where Anna is now parked.  She 
      steps out with Henry.  He looks up, his demeanor CHANGED.  
    The smart assnessfalls away and is replaced by GENUINE FEAR.

                                  HENRY
                    Please don t take me back there.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    31.

      CONTINUED:

      Anna softens.  And maybe for the first time, we see a twinkle 
    of actual MATERNAL INSTINCT.

                                  ANNA
                    Henry, I m sure your parents are 
                    worried sick about you.

                                  HENRY
                    I don t have parents.  Just a mom.  
                    And she s evil.
                          (fighting tears)
                    She doesn t love me.  She only 
                      pretendsto.

      Anna s heart breaks as she listens, because whether it s true 
    or not, this kid believes it.  And that s when --

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    Ohmygod, Henry!  Where have you 
                    been!

    ARM AROUND TO REVEAL -- the door of the house is open.  And 
      rushing out of it is Henry s adoptive mother, REGINA.  But 
      what we first notice is --

      She s IDENTICAL to the EVIL QUEEN in fairy tale land.  Only 
      without her Queen outfit, she just appears to be an 
      attractive suburban mom in her 30s.

      Regina s cheeks are tear stained and she s an emotional 
      wreck.  She rushes up and wraps Henry in a hug.

                                  REGINA
                    Are you alright?  Are you hurt?  
                    What happened?!?

    And standing behind her, looking concerned as he takes in the 
      scene is the oh-so handsome town SHERIFF.  Henry breaks from 
    the embrace --

                                  HENRY
                    What happened was I went to find my 
                    real mom. 

    And with that he scampers up the stairs into the house.  
      Regina looks up and sees Anna for the first time.  And it 
      really fucking hits her who this is.

                                  REGINA
                    ...you re Henry s birth mother?

      Anna forces an awkward smile.  Meekly responds --




                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    32.

                                  ANNA
                    ...Hi.

      It s an awkward moment.  The sheriff -- like any man would -- 
      senses it.  Speaks in a BRITISH ACCENT.

                                  SHERIFF
                    I ll just go check on the lad, make 
                    sure he s doing all right.

    The sheriff heads into the house.  Leaving Regina with Anna.

    As it sinks in on Regina who she s meeting, briefly, oh so 
      briefly, something flashes across her face.  Concern?  Worry?  
      Annoyance?  It s gone too fast for us to know for sure.

                                  REGINA
                    Thank you for bringing him home.

                                  ANNA
                    Sure.

      A beat of massive discomfort.  And then Regina puts on the 
      most welcoming smile imaginable.

                                  REGINA
                    How would you like a glass of the 
                    best apple cider you ve ever 
                    tasted?

                                  ANNA
                          (smiles)
                    Got anything stronger?

    OFF Regina nodding, UPCUT TO --

      INT. REGINA S STUDY - NIGHT

    ON A MIRROR.  Kelly Wearstler-like.  PAN OFF it to a 
      tastefully designed study.  Anna sits on the couch, DOWNING 
    her BOURBON as Regina sits opposite her in a chair.  On the 
      coffee table is a basket of apples.   Anna swallows, then --

                                  ANNA
                    So... you adopted Henry...

                                  REGINA
                    Yes, he s been with me since he was 
                    three weeks old.

    And her FEAR METER is off the charts now.  Because this is 
      every adoptive mother s NIGHTMARE.  A wild card birth mother.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    33.

      CONTINUED:

                                  ANNA
                    How did he find me?

                                  REGINA
                    No idea.  The records were sealed 
                    when I adopted him.  I was told the 
                    birth mother didn t want to be 
                    found.  Is... that still true?

      BEAT.  Now Anna gets it -- understands what Regina s worried 
      about.  That she s coming to take Henry away.

                                  ANNA
                    Yeah, it is.

      Regina studies her -- believes her.  A small exhale of 
      relief.  She gets up and tops off Anna s drink.

                                  REGINA
                    Okay, then.

      Regina sits back down.  Anna takes another sip.

                                  REGINA
                    I m sorry he dragged you out of 
                    your life.  He s really a good boy.

                                  ANNA
                    I m sure he is.

                                  REGINA
                    You have to understand -- things 
                    have been tough lately.  Ever since 
                    I became Mayor? 

      Regina is getting emotional now, full of regret.  And what we 
      find is that in stark contrast to the fairy-tale-land-queen, 
    we REALLY LIKE this woman.

                                  REGINA
                    I try to balance everything but... 
                    I guess it s not going as well as 
                    I d hoped.  I just -- I just want 
                    him to be happy.  But you see the 
                    way he looks at me...  And lately, 
                    he s become withdrawn.  He s been 
                    acting out.  So I sent him to see a 
                    therapist.

                                  ANNA
                          (putting it together)
                    Guy named Archie with a Dalmation?  
                    Henry thinks he s Jiminy Cricket?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    34.

                    Excuse me?

                                  ANNA
                    He says his therapist is a cartoon 
                    character.  From his book.

                                  REGINA
                    ...what book?

    Now Anna realizes something.  That story book?  Henry s been 
      hiding it from his mother.

                                  ANNA
                    You know what, it s none of my 
                    business.  He s your kid and I ve 
                    caused enough trouble.  I think I 
                    should be heading back.

      Regina smiles warmly --

                                  REGINA
                    Of course.  No trouble at all.

    And as Anna rises to go, we CUT TO --

      EXT. REGINA S HOUSE - NIGHT

      Anna hurries out.  Just needing to get the hell out of here.  
    She comes upon the sheriff, leaning up against her car.  He 
      smiles at her.  Munching on a PIXIE STICK.  Offers her one.

                                  SHERIFF
                    Pixie stick?

                                  ANNA
                    I ll pass.  

                                  SHERIFF
                    Yes, I know.  Terrible habit.  It s 
                    amazing my teeth haven t rotted 
                    through.  I m Graham, by the way.

                                  ANNA
                    Anna.  So what part of England you 
                    from, Graham? 

                                  SHERIFF
                    Actually, I was born and raised 
                    here.  Picked the accent up from my 
                    parents.  Gives me some authority, 
                    don t you think?




                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    35.

      CONTINUED:

                                  ANNA
                      Absolutely.  Well, I ve got a long 
                    drive ahead of me.  So if you could 
                    find somewhere else to lean...

      Anna moves to her car, but he remains leaning on it.

                                  GRAHAM
                    I think it might be better if you 
                    spent the night.

                                  ANNA
                    Kindaforward of you.

    He smiles, mischievous.  

                                  GRAHAM
                    I know Regina s drinks.  I d hate 
                    to get out the breathalyzer. 
                    There s a B and B on the town 
                    square.  They have rooms available.  
                    I called ahead. 
                          (thinks)
                    I guess I amforward.

      Anna shakes her head.  Clearly not having a CHOICE.

                                  ANNA
                    Let me grab my bag.

      Graham grins, steps aside.  As Anna pulls out her gym bag --

      INT. GRANNY S - NIGHT

      A large Victorian house.  It doubles as a bed and breakfast 
    and the local bar/restaurant.  Homey and oh-so-New England-y.  
    An elderly proprietor -- yeah, this is GRANNY -- checks Anna 
    in.

                                  GRANNY
                    Would you like a Square view or 
                    Forest view?  The Forest view are 
                    quieter, but the Square views can 
                    see everything.  There s no price 
                    dif--

      Suddenly she stops short as she sees SOMEONE leaving.

                                  GRANNY
                    Hey!





                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    36.

      CONTINUED:

      A RED HAIRED twentysomethinggirl is sauntering out.  There s 
    one word that leaps to mind at the sight of this sexy girl.  
      NAUGHTY.  She s pulling on a red coat as Granny berates her --

                                  GRANNY
                    Where do you think you regoing?

                                  RED
                    I ve got a date, Grandma.

      Granny looks at her watch.  Then back at Red.

                                  GRANNY
                    At twelve thirty?  No date starts 
                    at twelve thirty.

                    Mine do.

    Red hurries out.  Granny shakes her head, turns back to Anna.

                                  GRANNY
                    And she wonders why they never call 
                    her back.  Now where were we?  

                                  ANNA
                    I ll take the Forest view.

      INT. GRANNY S - ANNA S ROOM - NIGHT

      Anna enters the small well appointed bedroom.  Drops her bag 
    on the bed and plops down.  Sighs.  Where the HELL is she.  
    She unzips her bag, to take inventory and then shakes her 
      head as she sees something.

      INSIDE THE GYM BAG -- is HENRY S STORY BOOK.  Stuffed inside 
      among her workout clothes.  He hid it in there.  She shakes 
    her head, smiles --

                                  ANNA
                    Sneaky bastard.

      Anna takes out the book.  Starts to flip through it.  It s 
      VAST.  Filled with text and drawings.  This is another Tivo
      moment where we catch glimpses of drawings from all the 
      iconic fairy tales... and maybe from a few other stories as 
      well.  Was that Draculawe glimpsed?  No time to dwell.  Anna 
      moves to the bookmarkedpage and sees --

      A DRAWING OF -- Geppetto.  Crafting some kind of WARDROBE.  
      Push in on this drawing as we go to --                                                                                    37.


      INT. NURSERY - CASTLE - DAY - FAIRY TALE LAND

      GEPPETTO.  Hard at work carving out wood from the tree.  
      Shavings are everywhere.  The nursery is a mess.  All the 
      great plans for this baby have been shoved aside as we see 
      what he s building -- A WARDROBE.  And it s nearly finished.

      PULL BACK THROUGH -- THE WINDOW.  We re watching him work 
      from a HIGH POV --

      INT. CASTLE - BEDROOM - DAY - FAIRY TALE LAND

      Snow White stands at the window, watching across the 
      courtyard into the nursery.  She shakes her head at Charming. 

                                  SNOW
                    I don t want to do this.

                                  CHARMING
                    It has to be you.

                                  SNOW
                    No.  I m not leaving you.

                                  CHARMING
                    It s the only way.
                          (nods toward the nursery)
                    You ll go in there and be safe from 
                    the curse.  You ll have our child.  
                    And then you ll come back for me.

                                  SNOW
                    He said it would be on her twenty 
                    eighth birthday.

                                  CHARMING
                    What s twenty eight years when you 
                    have eternal love?  And once you 
                    rescue me, all will be back as it 
                    should be.  I have faith.  I 
                    believe it.  Now I need you to.

      Snow listens to his words.  Somewhat -- but not completely 
      comforted.  This woman is TORN --

                                  SNOW
                    I... want to.

                                  CHARMING
                    Then do it.  You will wake me up as 
                    I did you.  
                          (a warm smile)
                    We ll finally be even.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    38.

      CONTINUED:

    He pulls her in and kisses her deeply.  It s more than sweet.  
      This is the proclamation of a man who believes in EPIC LOVE.  
    The music swells.  A triumphant sense of hope fills the room.  
    And then -- Snow quickly pulls away.  Her face ASHEN. 

                                  CHARMING
                    What is it?

      Snow doubles over.  CLUTCHING her stomach.  Looks up.  Her 
      face a ball of agony.

                                  WHITE
                    She s coming...

    OFF SNOW, freaking out at this wrench in their plans --

      EXT. CASTLE - NIGHT - FAIRY TALE LAND

    UP ON THE GUARD TOWER.  Overlooking a vast field leading to a 
      forest in the distance.  Grumpy keeps watch with two KNIGHTS.  
      Beside him is another DWARF, eyes closed and snoring.  Yeah, 
      this is SLEEPY.

    ON GRUMPY.  Glances around.  Sleepy s out.  No one sees him 
    so -- he pulls out a FLASK.  Takes a swig.  Then puts it away 
    as he resumes staring out into the forest.  He squints in the 
      moonlight.  He sees something that panics him.  BLINKS.  Then 
      turns quickly to Sleepy, ROUSES HIM.

                                  GRUMPY
                    Get up.  WAKE UP.

      Sleepy rubs his eyes.  Stands.  

                                  SLEEPY
                          (yawning)
                    What is it?

      Grumpy points out --

                                  GRUMPY
                    At the tree line... are you seeing 
                    this...

      Sleepy looks out.  The knights join them and they see --

    THE DISTANT TREE LINE of the FOREST.

      Animals -- squirrels.  A wolf.  A deer.  One after another, a 
      steady stream of woodland creatures race out.  A STAMPEDE.  
    And if we Tivo-paused... we might see a UNICORN in the 
      middle.  But what we can see is that, on their animal faces, 
    is an unmistakable look --



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    39.

      CONTINUED:

      FEAR.  For following the animals?  Is a BLACK CARRIAGE 
      surrounded by BLACK KNIGHTS.  Riding in the carriage is THE 
      EVIL QUEEN.  And then, behind the carriage... seeping out of 
    the forest is a SHEET of GREEN MIST.  Like a FOG that 
      envelopes everything it passes over and swallowing it up.

      BACK ON THE GUARD TOWER.

      Grumpy sucks in his breath.  Getting it.  He turns toward a 
      BELL.  And rings it LOUDLY.  Shouting --

                                  GRUMPY
                    The curse.  IT S HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.

                                        ACT FOUR

      INT. ANNA S ROOM - STORYBROOKE- MORNING

      OVER BLACK.  We hear...  BANGBANG.  Someone is pounding on a 
      door.  FADE UP ON Anna.  Sound asleep.  BANGBANG.  She stirs 
      awake.  Hops out of bed, in gym clothes.  She opens the door 
    to see Regina.  Amped.  Eyes wild.  

                                  REGINA
                    Where is he?!?  Henry?  HENRY!?!

    She doesn t wait for an answer and blows by into the room.  
      Standing behind her is the sheriff.  Anna looks at him.

                        ANNAGRAHAM
      Again?
                                                  Afraid so.

      Regina strides over to Anna, controlled fury.  And worry.

                                  REGINA
                    Did he contact you?  Have you heard 
                    from him at all?

      Anna shakes her head.  Regina grows more worried, frustrated.

                                  REGINA
                    He wasn t in his room this morning.

                                  ANNA
                    I don t know what to say.  I m 
                    sorry.

      Regina collects herself.  Tries to stay calm.

                                  REGINA
                    No, I msorry.  I don t mean to 
                    keep bothering you.  I know you 
                    have a long drive back to Boston.
                          (to the sheriff)
                    Graham.  Let s go.

    As they move out, we hold on Anna.  Her face filled with 
      emotion.  Yeah, that s GUILT.  She knows this, however 
        unintentionally, is her fault.  She wants to help.  SO --

                                  ANNA
                    Have you tried any of his friends?

                                  REGINA
                    He doesn t really have any.  He s 
                    kind of a loner.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    41.

      CONTINUED:

      OUCH.  That sure as hell strikes a chord with Anna.  That s 
      something she and Henry have in common. 

                                  ANNA
                    Every kid has friends.  Have you 
                    checked his computer?  If there s 
                    anyone he s close to.  He d be 
                    emailing them.  That s where you 
                    should start.

                                  GRAHAM
                    And you know this how?

                                  ANNA
                    Finding people is what I do.

      INT. HENRY S ROOM - REGINA S HOUSE - MORNING

      CLOSE ON a HOOKAH SMOKING CATERPILLAR.  WIDEN TO SEE -- it s 
      a COMPUTER SCREEN SAVER.  Anna moves the mouse, revealing a 
    web browser as we see we re in Henry s room.  On the wall are 
      shelves filled with BOOKS and a large collection of CUCKOO 
      CLOCKS.  Pictures and drawings are everywhere.  This is a boy 
    who wants to live any world but this one.  ANNA taps away at 
    the keyboard.  Regina watches, anxious, by Graham.

                                  ANNA
                    Kid s smart.  He cleared his inbox. 
                    All his emailsare gone.

      Anna pulls out a USBcard on her keychain.Plugs it in.

                                  ANNA
                    Luckily, I m smart too.  Little 
                    hard disk recovery utility I like 
                    to use.  When you delete something, 
                    all you re doing is telling the 
                    computer to ignore the data.  
                    Doesn t mean it s gone yet.

                                  SHERIFF
                    I m a bit more old fashioned in my 
                      techniques.  Pounding the pavement.  
                    Knocking on doors.  That sort of

                                  ANNA
                    Well, you re on salary.  I get paid 
                    for delivery.  Pounding the 
                    pavement isn t a luxury I get.

    ON THE SCREEN -- the INBOXreforms.  Emailafter email
      reappears.  Anna raises her eyebrow at one.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    42.

                    Huh.  A receipt from a website.
                          (she clicks on it)
                     Who s your mommy dot com? 

    She shakes her head in disbelief --

                                  ANNA
                    Guess we know how he found me.

    Her fingers fly through.  She explores the site.

                                  ANNA
                    Expensive.  Does he have a credit 
                    card?

                                  REGINA
                    He s ten.

                                  ANNA
                    Well he used one...  let s see if I 
                    can get a transaction record...
                          (taps the keys, then --)
                    Who s Mary Margaret Blanchard?

      Regina s face tightens.  She KNOWS and doesn t like her.

                                  REGINA
                    Henry s teacher.

    Her the tone says it all -- Regina doesn t like this woman.

                                  REGINA
                    Thank you for the help, Ms. Swan.  
                    But I ve got it from here.

    And that s when GRAHAM shocks them both, nods at Anna --

                                  GRAHAM
                    Anna should go.

                        ANNAREGINA
      What?What?

                                  GRAHAM
                    This falls under pounding the 
                    pavement.  My area.  
                          (to Regina)
                    If Mary Margaret helped him find 
                    her...
                          (nods at Anna)
                    Then she s the only way to get him 
                    to stop running.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    43.

      CONTINUED:

      Before Regina can protest, Anna sighs.

                                  ANNA
                    He s right.  I ll go.

                                  REGINA
                    But we ve troubled you enough --

    But Anna -- knows what must be done --

                                  ANNA
                    All due respect, it s on me.  Don t 
                    worry, I ll bring him back. 

    OFF ANNA, wanting to close the book on this, but maybe, just 
      maybe, a little bit WORRIED too, we CUT TO --

      INT. CATHOLIC SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

    ON a roomful of fourth graders.  Sitting at their desks, 
      listening raptly to a SWEET VOICE as they work on an art 
      project.  Building small houses --

                                  SWEET VOICE
                    As we build our bird houses, 
                    remember that what you re making is 
                    a home, not a cage.  A bird is free 
                    and will do what it will.  This is 
                    for them, not us.

      REVEAL -- SISTER MARY MARGARET BLANCHARD.  A nun and their 
      teacher.  And the first thing we notice -- she looks EXACTLY 
      like SNOW WHITE.  Now we know for sure, Henry is casting real 
      people from his life in his stories.  She s holding a small 
      BLUEBIRD.  And demonstrates her point.  She lets it go by the 
      window sill.  It flies outside the window and...  right to a 
      bird house perched on a tree.

                                  MARY MARGARET
                    They re loyal creatures.  If you 
                    love them and they love you, they 
                    will always find you.

    The BELL RINGS.  

                                  MARY MARGARET
                    We ll pick this up after recess.  
                    No running...

    The kids file out the door and past Anna.  Who enters.  Mary 
      Margaret sees her.  Is puzzled.  But there is NO RECOGNITION.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    44.

      CONTINUED:

    If this so called  curse  is real, than Henry wasn t kidding.  
    It worked. 

                                  MARY MARGARET
                    Can I help you?

                                  ANNA
                    I m looking for one of your 
                    students.  Henry.  

                                  MARY MARGARET
                    And you are?

                                  ANNA
                    I m his... 
                          (doesn t want to say the 
                          word)
                    It s complicated.

                                  MARY MARGARET
                    Well, I m reasonably bright and as 
                    I m not really in the habit of 
                    discussing my children with 
                    strangers, you might want to tell 
                    me.

      Beat.  For the first time Anna actually SPITS IT OUT --

                                  ANNA
                    I m his mother.

                                  MARY MARGARET
                          (raises an eyebrow)
                    I m pretty sure the Mayor is his 
                    mother.

                                  ANNA
                    Yeah, right.  Thing is -- I gave 
                    birth to him.  
                          (then; pointed)
                    But you already know that 
                      considering yougave him your 
                    credit card to track me down.

      Mary Margaret blinks.  Puts it together.  Her face falls --

                                  MARY MARGARET
                    My... credit card?

    She hurries to her handbag, rifles through it.  Her face 
      falls.  The credit card is missing from her wallet.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    45.

      CONTINUED:

                                  MARY MARGARET
                    He s a clever one.

    And then what she says next stops Anna short.

                                  MARY MARGARET
                    This is all my fault.  I never 
                    should have given him that book.  

      Anna stares at Mary Margaret, realizing --

                                  ANNA
                    The fairy tales?  Are you the one 
                    who put that craziness in his head?

                                  MARY MARGARET
                    That was not my intention.  You 
                    have to understand.  Henry is -- 
                    he s a special boy.  So smart.  So 
                    creative.  And so lonely.  He 
                    needed it.

                                  ANNA
                    What he needs is a dose of reality.

                                  MARY MARGARET
                    Tell me something... what do you 
                    think stories are for?

                                  ANNA
                    Getting through a long flight?

                                  MARY MARGARET
                    Dan Brown, maybe.  But these 
                    stories?  The classics?  There s a 
                    reason we all know them.  They re a 
                    way for us to deal with our world -- 
                    a world that doesn t always make 
                    sense.  You see, Henry s had his 
                    share of hardships.  

                                  ANNA
                    Kid seems like he s got a pretty 
                    good life to me.

                                  MARY MARGARET
                    Yes, but Henry s like any adopted 
                    child.  He wrestles with that most 
                    basic question they all inevitably 
                    face.  
                          (beat)
                     Why would anyone give me away? 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    46.

      CONTINUED:

    And that question tears right through Anna s heart.  Because 
      it s ABOUT HER.  Mary Margaret realizes --

                                  MARY MARGARET
                    I m sorry, I didn t mean in any way 
                    to judge you.

                                  ANNA
                    No...  It s okay.

    But it s clearly not okay.  That STUNG.

                                  MARY MARGARET
                    Look, I gave the book to him 
                    because I wanted Henry to have the 
                    most important thing anyone can 
                    have.  Hope.  Believing in the 
                      possibility of a happy ending is a 
                    very powerful thing.  But I guess 
                    he took it too far.

    And Anna is emotionally wracked by this, so she tries to stay 
    on target.

                                  ANNA
                    Do you have any idea where he might 
                    be?

                                  MARY MARGARET
                          (a beat)
                    You might want to check his castle.

    OFF THAT PUZZLING PROCLAMATION --

      INT. BEDROOM - CASTLE - FAIRY TALE LAND

      CLOSE ON THE CASTLE.  PUSH THROUGH the bedroom window to find 
      SNOW in bed.  Her face a ball of agony.  Sweat dripping.  
      This woman is in fucking labor.  Doc tends to her, Charming 
    is at her side.  She CLUTCHES his hand like a vice.

                                  CHARMING

    The door bursts open, Geppetto runs in.  

                                  GEPPETTO
                          (thick Italian accent)
                    It s a  ready.

      Charming smiles, moves to pick Snow up but is met by DOC S 
      HARSH gaze.  Doc just shakes his head.

                                  DOC
                    It s too late.  We can t move her.

    OFF THAT and CHARMING S HEART SINKING --

      EXT. CASTLE - NIGHT

    The BLACK CARRIAGE pulls up.  Behind it, we see the mist 
      slowly encroaching, getting nearer.  The Queen steps out of 
    the carriage, addresses her assembled BLACK KNIGHTS.  And on 
    her face -- a smile.  A VICTORIOUS SMILE.

                                  QUEEN
                    Nothing like the smell of a good 
                    curse.  You know what you have to 
                    do.  Find the child.

    As the Knights hurry into the castle, the Queen watches the 
      Green Mist move ever closer.

      INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

    ON SNOW.  Tears streaming as.... WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.A 
      baby cries.  ON DOC.  Despite everything.  SMILING.

                                  DOC
                    It s a little girl.

    He lifts up the crying BABY and hands it to Charming who 
      immediately starts wrapping her in a blanket.  He hands her 
      over to Snow.  Snow cradles her child.  Looks at her with all 
    the love in her heart, then up at Charming as a horrible 
      realization dawns --

                                  SNOW
                    The wardrobe.  It only takes one.

      CONTINUED:

      OUTSIDE, we HEAR the SOUNDS of a BATTLE RAGING.  The Queen, 
    and her curse, are closing in.  Charming takes his wife s 
      hand.  Squeezes it.  Determined to make the best of this.

                                  CHARMING
                    Well at least we re together.

    He holds her tight.  Snow just stares at her baby.  Then 
      comes to a very difficult decision.  

                                  SNOW
                    No.

      Snow looks at her daughter, this is the hardest fucking thing 
      she s ever had to say.

                                  SNOW
                    You have to take her.  You have to 
                    take the baby to the wardrobe.

    Now it dawns on Charming what she s suggesting.  His eyes 
      well up.

                                  CHARMING
                    No.  We have to stick together --

                                  SNOW
                    -- It s the only way.  You have to 
                    send her through.  

                                  CHARMING
                    You don t know what you re saying --

                                  SNOW
                    -- I do.  We have to believe she ll 
                    come back for us.  
                          (then; pained --)
                    We have to give her her best 
                    chance.  

      Tears stream down her cheeks as she makes this most difficult 
      proclamation.  And Charming is crying too.  Because he knows 
      she s RIGHT.  And, finally, he NODS.

    The SOUNDS of BATTLE get closer.  Time is running out, so 
      SNOW kisses the baby s forehead.  The tears are flowing 
      freely --

                                  SNOW
                    Goodbye, Anna.

    She then hands the baby to Charming.  He kisses her quickly 
    and then runs off.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    49.

      CONTINUED:

    ON SNOW.  Collapsing on the bed.  Her heart wrenched.  She s 
      just done the hardest thing imaginable -- giving up her baby.

      INT. CASTLE - HALLWAY - SAME

      With the baby wrapped in a blanket in his arms and his sword 
      drawn, Charming races down the stairs and out into ANOTHER 
      HALLWAY.  He moves to the nursery door just as TWO BLACK 
      KNIGHTS arrive.  They CHARGE Charming.  But -- even while 
      protecting his newborn -- he s one helluvaswordsman, a 
      father possessed.  THWACK THWACK, he takes them out.  But in 
    the melee... he s STABBED in the shoulder.  GRUNTING and 
      BLEEDING, he kicks open the door to the --

    THE NURSERY.  The baby is CRYING loudly as Charming stumbles 
      toward the wardrobe.  He UNLOCKS the LOCK and gently places 
    the baby inside as --

    TWO MORE BLACK KNIGHTS ARRIVE.  Charming looks down at the 
      baby, rubs his hand on her forehead.  Whispers --

                                  CHARMING
                    Find us.

      Then, he quickly closes the door, locks it, and faces the 
      oncoming Guards.  THE KNIGHTS CHARGE.  And Charming is too 
      wounded to dodge.  He feebly attempts to parry their swords, 
    but the first guard knocks it from his hands.  The SECOND 
      RUNS HIM THROUGH.

      Charming falls over to the ground.  FROM HIS POV, looking up 
    he sees -- THE KNIGHTS reach the wardrobe.  They pull at the 
      door.  It s locked!  So the Guards SLASH AND SLASH at the 
      wood, chopping at it until the doors FALL OFF.  And inside --

    THE WARDROBE IS EMPTY.  

    And as the Prince smiles... successful, his eyes closing, 
      perhaps for the last time...

                                        ACT FIVE

      EXT. RENAISSANCE PLAYGROUND - STORYBROOKE- DAY

    ON THE SPIRE of a CRAPPY PLASTIC CASTLE.  WIDEN TO -- reveal 
      we re in a shittyrenaissance playground on the edge of town.

      FIND ANNA.  At the entrance.  She carries the STORY BOOK and 
      shakes her head as she looks at the plastic castle.  Oh.  
      This is what Mary Margaret meant.  Anna walks up to the 
      jungle gym like stairs and climbs up to --

    THE TOP OF THE CASTLE.  She pulls herself up and finds HENRY, 
      sitting alone.  Staring out over the playground and into the 
      town.  The castle directly faces the CLOCK TOWER.  Henry 
      turns to see Anna arrive, then wordlessly turns back to stare 
    at the clock tower.  Anna settles down beside him.

      BEAT.  She slides over the book.

                                  ANNA
                    You  left  this in my gym bag.

      Henry takes it back.  But keeps staring out.

                                  ANNA
                    Still hasn t moved, huh?

      Anna stares out at the tower.  And it s still stuck at 
       8:15. 

                                  HENRY
                    I was hoping that when I brought 
                    you back, things would change here.  
                    That it would move again.  That... 
                    that the final battle would begin.

      Anna sighs.  Poor kid.

                                  ANNA
                    Henry, I m not gonna fight any 
                    battles.  

                                  HENRY
                    Yes you are.  You re here because 
                    it s your destiny.

                                  ANNA
                    Henry -- cut it with the book crap. 
                    It s enough already.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    51.

      CONTINUED:

                                  HENRY
                    You don t have to be hostile.  You 
                    like me.  I can tell.  You re just 
                    pushing me away because I make you 
                    feel guilty.
                          (then; sweetly --)
                    But it s okay.  I know why you gave 
                    me away.

      That stops her cold.  He looks at her now, gently.  
      Forgiving.

                                  HENRY
                    You did it because you wanted to 
                    give me my best chance.

      Hearing those words AFFECTS Anna.  Her tough veneer cracks.  
      Because he s RIGHT.  Her eyes well up.

                                  HENRY
                    Told you everybody cries.

      Anna wipes the tears away.  Reeling --

                                  ANNA
                    How... how do you knowthat...?

                                  HENRY
                    Because it s the same reason Snow 
                    White gave youaway.

    And Anna shakes it off.  Remembers what she s dealing with.

                                  ANNA
                    Right, because I min the book.

                                  HENRY
                    Yes.  And you re twenty eight now.  
                    So it s time to get started.  
                    You re the one who s gonna bring 
                    back all the happy endings.

                                  ANNA
                    Let me tell you something, kid, I m 
                    a real person.  I m no savior.  
                    You re wrong about that.  But you 
                    are right about one thing.  I 
                    wanted you to have your best 
                    chance.  And it ain t with me.  
                    Come on, I gotta get you home.

      Henry shakes his head.  Henry does not like hearing this one 
      damn bit.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    52.

      CONTINUED:

                                  HENRY
                    Please don t do this.  Don t bring 
                    me back to her.  Just stay here 
                    with me.  For one week.  That s all 
                    I ask.  One week and you ll see I m 
                    right.  You ll see I m not crazy.

                                  ANNA
                    I have to bring you back to your 
                    mother.

                                  HENRY
                    You don t know what it s like.  My 
                    life sucks.

                                  ANNA
                    You wanna know what sucking is?  
                    It s being left abandoned on a 
                    freeway.  My parents didn t even 
                    think to drop me at a hospital.  
                    Then I found my way into the foster 
                    system.  I was with a family until 
                    I was three.  Until they had their 
                    own kid.  So they sent me back.  I 
                    bounced around from family to 
                    family until I was sixteen and 
                    could be on my own.  Of course by 
                    then I realized I had alwaysbeen 
                    on my own.

      Anna tries to compose herself -- these are painful memories. 

                                  ANNA
                    Your mom s trying her best, Henry.  
                    It s hard.  But none of us are 
                    perfect.  You may not think she 
                    loves you...
                          (beat)
                    But at least she wants you.

      Henry absorbs this incredibly heartfelt soul baring.  But 
      only one thing registers with him.

                                  HENRY
                    Your parents didn t leave you in 
                    the street.  That s just where you 
                    came through.

                                  ANNA
                    What?





                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    53.

                                  HENRY
                    The wardrobe.  When you went 
                    through the wardrobe you appeared 
                    in the street.  Your parents were 
                    trying to save you from the curse.

    And now Anna realizes she s not equipped for this.  She 
      rises.  Takes his hand.

                                  ANNA
                    Sure they were.  Come on, Henry.

    OFF HENRY, reluctantly following her and carrying his BOOK --

      INT. NURSERY - CASTLE - FAIRY TALE LAND

      Snow races into the nursery and is greeted by a horrific 
      sight.  Amidst the rubble from the smashed wardrobe, Charming 
      lies on the ground.  Barely breathing as he clutches his 
      wounded chest.  

                                  SNOW
                    No...

    She hurries to his side.  Sits down and cradles his head in 
    her lap.  Tears run down her cheeks. 

                                  SNOW
                    Please... please... come back to 
                    me.

      Charming s eyes flutter open, he chokes out his words as he 
      looks up at her.  Speaks with a weakened gasp.

                                  CHARMING
                    We... will be together... again.

    His eyes fall closed and he loses consciousness as Snow holds 
    him tightly.  Is he dead?  Is he in a coma?  That s an answer 
    for later.  And we don t have much time to consider anyway 
      because...

                                  QUEEN (O.S.)
                    Don t worry, dear.

      Snow looks up to see the Queen entering.  A malevolent look 
    of satisfaction on her face.

                                  QUEEN
                    In a few moments you won t remember 
                    you knew him, let alone loved him.

      Mustering her strength, Snow speaks through her tears.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    54.

      CONTINUED:

                                  SNOW WHITE
                    Why did you do this?

      A chilling smile crosses her lips and she leans in close to 
      Snow.

                                  QUEEN
                    Because this is myhappy ending.

      Before Snow can respond.  The two BLACK KNIGHTS hurry back 
    in.  The Queen faces them --

                                  QUEEN
                    The child?

    The knights look at one another.  Frightened to tell her 
      something.  She senses this, grows angry.

                                  QUEEN
                    The child?

                                  BLACK KNIGHT
                    Gone.  It was in the wardrobe.  
                    Then it was gone.  It s nowhere to 
                    be found.  

    At this news, Snow clutches her Prince closely.  The Queen 
      stares daggers at her.

                                  QUEEN
                    Where is she?!?

      Snow White looks up with a new look on her face.  BELIEF.  
      FAITH.  She has steely determination.

                                  SNOW WHITE
                    You re going to lose.  I know it 
                    now.  You re going to lose.  Good 
                    willalways win.

    The Queen looks concerned for a flash.  Then hardens.  

                                  QUEEN
                    We ll see about that.  

    And now the GREEN MIST surrounds them.  Filling the room.  
      Enveloping EVERYTHING.  And what we see next is jaw 
      dropping... the world?  It starts to CRACK -- like a mirror.  
    And then SHATTER.  Snow s eyes widen as images fly by -- her 
      whole world is coming apart.  And now she GLIMPSES another 
      world -- and maybe we see something beyond our Fairy Tales.  
      A glimpse of one of H.G.Wells  tripods.  The worlds of all 
      storytelling are folding in on one another.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    55.

      CONTINUED:

    But Snow can t understand it and has more pressing issues.  
    The MIST surrounds and envelopes everyone, dematerializing 
      them as a VORTEX swirls up around them.  Snow is terrified...

                                  SNOW WHITE
                    Where... where are we going?

                                  QUEEN
                    Somewhere horrible.  
                          (a malevolent grin)
                    Absolutely horrible.

    And with that BLACKNESS CONSUMES them all and we --

      EXT. REGINA S HOUSE - EVENING

    ON THE FRONT DOOR.  It opens.  Revealing -- Regina with a 
      look of supreme relief on her face.  ARM AROUND TO --

      Anna, with Henry in tow.  Henry doesn t even wait for her to 
      speak, he just blows by her and runs to his room.  Regina 
      calls after him --

                                  REGINA
                    Henry!

    But all we hear is a DOOR SLAM.  Regina turns back to Anna.

                                  REGINA
                    I m just glad he s back.  Thank 
                    you.

                                  ANNA
                          (not sure what to say)
                    Yeah... no problem.

      BEAT.  Regina just stands there.  Her relief now shifts to 
      another -- more VULNERABLE look.  Something is eating at her.

                                  REGINA
                    Did he say... why?

                                  ANNA
                    I dunno.  I think maybe... maybe 
                    that Evil Queen s curse just got in 
                    his head.

                                  REGINA
                    What?

                                  ANNA
                    From his stories.  




                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    56.

      CONTINUED:

                                  REGINA
                    Right.  I should probably take that 
                    book away.

                                  ANNA
                    What s the harm?  It s only a book.

                                  REGINA
                    Yes.  That it is.  Well, have a 
                    safe trip home.

      Anna nods at her, steps way.  Ready to head home.  But 
      something s gnawing at her.

                                  ANNA
                    Hey --

      Regina stops, mid door close.

                                  REGINA
                    Yeah?

                                  ANNA
                    Do you love him?

    And Regina is thrown by that question.

                                  REGINA
                    Excuse me?

                                  ANNA
                    Henry.  Do you love him?

    For a flash we catch a look -- surprise perhaps -- on 
      Regina s face.  And just as quickly, it s gone.  

                                  REGINA
                    Of course I love him.

      Whatever Anna saw?  She s keeping to herself.

                                  ANNA
                    Right.  Sorry.  Goodbye.

    And with that Anna leaves.

      EXT. TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT

    ON THE CLOCK TOWER.  Frozen at  8:15.   The sun is setting at 
    the end of another day in Storybrooke. 

    The old folk song Kookaburrastarts playing as we slowly PAN 
      DOWN TO --



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    57.

      CONTINUED:

      Anna.  Walking through the town square.  Her encounter with 
      Regina weighing heavily on her as she looks at this place 
      through new eyes.  And while there is no OVERT magic, there 
    is certainly something odd and off about the place.  She 
      notices --

      A butcher shop.  A bakery.  A hippie selling candles.  A 
      dwarf shooting hoops on the basketball court.  

    And through this we, but not Anna, recognize some people from 
      Fairy Tale land.  The dwarf is GRUMPY.  Outside the bakery, a 
      HANDYMAN works on the bannister to the stairs.  This is 
      Geppetto.  And while it feels a bit surreal, Anna s not 
      actually seeing anything without a rational explanation here.  
      This is just small town America closing shop.  However, for 
    the first time, she s seeing the town the way Henry does.  
      She s seeing magic in a world that previously had none.  

      Anna shakes her head, can t believe he s gotten to her, as 
    she walks into --

      INT. GRANNY S - SAME

    Red is at the front desk.  Anna walks up.

                                  RED
                    Checking out?  Back to Boston?

      Anna is distracted by everything, just nods.

                                  ANNA
                    ... yeah.

                                  RED
                    What s it like?

      Anna looks up at Red, surprised.

                                  ANNA
                    You ve never been?  It s only four 
                    hours away.

                                  RED
                    Why would I leave here?

      HUH. 

    And while it s not any real  proof  -- it reminds Anna of 
      someone.  Someone she s about to leave.  SO --

                                  ANNA
                    You know what... I think I d 
                    actually like to keep the room.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    58.

      CONTINUED:

                                  RED
                    Sure.  How long?

                                  ANNA
                    Just a week.

    Now we realize -- it s all gotten to Anna.  Henry is in HER 
      HEAD.  And Regina s answer is haunting her.  As Red gets the 
      paperwork, we go off Anna --

      INT. HENRY S ROOM - REGINA S HOUSE - NIGHT

      Regina tucks Henry into bed.  Kisses his forehead. 

                                  REGINA
                    Good night, Henry. 

      Henry just nods.  Regina tries to mask her frustration as she 
      leaves.  HOLD ON HENRY.  Once the door is closed and he hears 
    her footsteps recede, he hops out of bed.  In his PJshe 
      scampers over to the window.

      Henry pulls the shade and sits on the sill.  Staring out the 
      window.

      HENRY S POV.He s staring at the CLOCK TOWER.

      PUSH IN on the CLOCK TOWER.  In the moonlight, we go TIGHT on 
    the CLOCK FACE, still reading  8:15.   BEAT.  And then --

      TICK.

    The CLOCK MOVES.

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.

                                        THE END
