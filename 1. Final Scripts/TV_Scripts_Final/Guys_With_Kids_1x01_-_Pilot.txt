Third Network Draft 1/3/2012      INT. - TEDDY S BAR - DAY

      A FRIENDLY LOCAL WATERING HOLE.  PEOPLE ARE DRINKING BEERS, 
      BUT IT S NOT RAUCOUS OR SEEDY -- THERE S A LAID-BACK, WEEKEND-
      AFTERNOON VIBE.

      FROM BEHIND WE SEE THREE DUDES GLUED TO THE YANKEES GAME ON 
      THE BIG SCREEN.  WE HEAR THE PLAY-BY-PLAY...  

                                  ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

                Here comes the pitch.  Jeter 

                  connects... if it stays fair it s... a 

                home run!

      THE GUYS JUMP UP AND CHEER REVEALING THEY RE ALL WEARING BABY 
      BJORNS.  WITH BABIES IN THEM.  THESE ARE OUR DILFS: 

      CHRIS, A HANDSOME AND RECENTLY DIVORCED LAWYER WHO IS 
      CONFIDENT IN EVERYTHING EXCEPT PARENTING HIS 9-MONTH-OLD SON, 
      ERNIE.  

      NICK, CHRIS S BEST FRIEND, A LAID-BACK PROGRAMMER/SUPER DAD 
      STRUGGLING TO BALANCE WORK, MARRIAGE AND TWO KIDS (WITH 1-
      YEAR-OLD SON, FRED IN HIS BJORN).  

      GARY, A SAD-SACK COMIC BOOK COLLECTOR TURNED SAD-SACK STAY-AT-
      HOME DAD (WITH 6-MONTH-OLD TWIN GIRLS, SADIE, IN HIS BJORN, 
      AND RUTHIE, IN A STROLLER). 

      ALL LIVE IN THE SAME HIGH-RISE.  ALL ARE IN THEIR EARLY 30 S.  

      THEY GENTLY CHEST-BUMP EACH OTHER WITH THEIR BABIES AND SIT 
      BACK DOWN.  AT THE START OF THE FOLLOWING THEY DO NOT TAKE 
      THEIR EYES OFF THE GAME AND SPEAK IN THE FLAT, DISTRACTED 
      TONE OF DADS WATCHING TV EVERYWHERE.

                                  CHRIS

                Nick.

                                  NICK

                Yo.

                                  CHRIS

                I ve got a serious parenting dilemma.                                              DILFs - "PILOT"              2.


                                  GARY

                Hey, why do you only ever ask Nick to 

                solve your parenting dilemmas?  He s 

                got two kids.  I have...like four.

                                  CHRIS

                Like four?  Yes, why wouldn t I seek 

                your counsel?

                                  GARY

                Hey, it s hard to keep track, man.  

                They just keep marching out of Marny 

                like the evil brooms in Fantasia.  I 

                mean, yeah, we re both super sexual...

                                  NICK
                      (Cutting Gary off)

                What s your dilemma, Chris?

                                  CHRIS

                The Yanks just tied it up in the ninth 

                but Ernie s dipe is a Stage-Five 

                Meltdown with possible leaking in the 

                core.  If I run home to change him 

                we ll miss the game and an important 

                bonding moment - all the more crucial 

                since the divorce.  But if I stay, 

                it s guaranteed diaper rash and 

                budding feelings of resentment and 

                neglect.

      GARY AND NICK STARE AT CHRIS FOR A BEAT.                                            DILFs - "PILOT"              3.


                                  GARY

                Man, remember all the stupid stuff you 

                worried about with your first kid? 

                                  NICK

                  Seriously, dude, just change him in 

                the bathroom here.  A dad on  Teen 

                Mom  could have figured that out.  

                                  CHRIS

                There s police tape on the toilet.

                                  NICK
                      (perking up)

                Is there?  I see, this is interesting.

                                  GARY

                Is it?

                                  NICK

                Totally.  I spend all week in front of 

                  a computer.  Stuff like this lets me 

                feel like MacGyver with a diaper bag.  

                Here, change him under the table.  

                                  CHRIS

                Really?  Just on the floor?  Next to a 

                puddle of  Devil s Butthole  buffalo 

                wing sauce?  And what about 

                  pedophiles?  Don t you worry about 

                  pedophiles watching?

                                  NICK
                      (beat)

                Always.                                            DILFs - "PILOT"              4.


      ALL THREE GUYS SCOPE THE BAR FOR PEDOPHILES.

                                  GARY

                All clear.  

                                  CHRIS

                Okay, but Sheila can t know about 

                this.  
                      (Chris ducks under the table 
                        with Ernie and out of view)

                She s been crazier than ever about 

                  protecting Ernie since the divorce. 
                      (Nick and Gary silently make 
                        agonized  kill me  faces to 
                        each other as Chris drones 
                        on about Sheila)

                She d freak if she even knew I had him 

                in a bar.  And I m like,  if you don t 

                want him in a bar, stop dressing him 

                like a sailor!   I mean I d never 

                actually say that but...  
                      (Chris pops up holding Ernie 
                        and beams)

                Oh, that has to be a speed record! Are 

                you people seeing this?  

      CHRIS LOOKS AROUND THE BAR FOR APPROVAL TO NO AVAIL.  CHRIS 
      ZERBERS ERNIE.  AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN, MEGAN, APPROACHES.

                                  MEGAN

                I m sorry, your son is adorable.

      NICK AND GARY TWIST TO DISPLAY THEIR BABIES TO MEGAN.  

                                  CHRIS

                Thank the pretty woman, Ernie.

      ERNIE STARES BLANKLY.                                            DILFs - "PILOT"              5.


                                  MEGAN

                Well, you are welcome, Ernie.
                      (To Chris, flirty)

                He has your eyes.

      MEGAN WALKS TO THE BAR.  WHEN SHE S OUT OF EARSHOT...

                                  CHRIS
                        (High-fiving Ernie)

                My man!

                                  GARY

                You have poop on your chin.

                                  CHRIS

                Oh, dude...

      CHRIS STARTS TO WIPE IT OFF BUT IS DISTRACTED BY THE GAME. 

                                  ANNOUNCER

                Teixeira laces a line drive to left.  

                  Granderson races home.  The throw 

                is...not in time!  Yankees win!  

                Yankees win!

      CHRIS, GARY AND NICK ALL JUMP AND HUG WITH THEIR BABIES.

      INT. BAR - A LITTLE LATER

      CHRIS IS AT THE BAR TALKING TO MEGAN.  ERNIE S ASLEEP IN THE 
      BJORN.

                                  CHRIS

                Not to brag but my Ernie s an amazing 

                baseball player.

                                  MEGAN

                Is that so?

                                  CHRIS

                Uh, yeah.  His fast ball clocks in at 

                over 4 miles per hour.  And then he 

                has a change-up where his arm moves 

                forward but the ball somehow goes 

                  backwards.  He s a born ball player. 

                Or magician.  But hey, not for me to 

                decide.  
                      (To Ernie)

                You cannot be a magician.

                                  MEGAN

                I dunno, magicians can be sexy.

                What s wrong with you?

                      (To Ernie)

                She s lying.  You cannot be a 

                  magician.  You have to play baseball. 

                Or open a chain of nacho restaurants.                                             DILFs - "PILOT"              7.

                  Likewise, and let me know if anything

                      (Too cool)

                You bet.

      CHRIS TURNS TO NICK AND GARY AND HIS COOL DEMEANOR 
      IMMEDIATELY DISSOLVES INTO PSYCHED AMAZEMENT AS HE JOGS OVER

                                  CHRIS

                I know, but I have Ernie on weekends.  

      NICK AND GARY LOOK AT EACH OTHER, THEN...

                        NICKGARY

      Ask Sheila to watch him.*Leave him in his crib with 

                                                  some toys and a couple *

                                                    bottles.

                                  CHRIS (CONT D)

                If I ask Sheila she ll want to know 

                why.  

                                  NICK

                Which is somehow unreasonable?

                                  CHRIS

                It s not, but then we have to have the 

                whole starting-to-date-again convo.  

                And she s gonna flip out because we ve 

                only been divorced for three months.  

                And she ll throw out some term she 

                found on the Internet, like  mommy 

                  confusion,  and I lose the argument.  

                And I don t get to go on the date and 

                I die a spinster.  Lying is the only 

                way to go.

                an emergency appendectomy.  

                                  NICK

                As your best friend, please just tell 

                Sheila the truth.  She might surprise 

                you.  I seem to remember a time you 

                two got along.  Right? 

                                  CHRIS

                I think  made each other super horny  

                is a more accurate description.

                Still, Nick s right, dude.  I mean 

                Marny and I don t have much.  Not any 

                more at least.  Clark broke our TV 

                  yesterday.  I almost killed him.  

                  But...where was I going with this?

                                  NICK

                No clue.
                      (To Chris)

                Look, we ve both been parenting a lot 

                longer than you.  Divorced or not, the 

                only way it works is if you tell the 

                other parent everything. 

                                  CHRIS

                It s just a little appendectomy.  

                                  NICK

                  Everything.                                              DILFs - "PILOT"              12.


                                  CHRIS

                Okay, fine, I get it!  Everything!

      NICK THINKS, THEN NODS IN AGREEMENT.

      INT. CHRIS S APARTMENT

      CHRIS IS ON THE FLOOR WITH ERNIE.  HE CONSULTS A CHILD 
      DEVELOPMENT BOOK AND THEN ROLLS ERNIE A BALL.  ERNIE STARES 
      AT IT.  

                                  CHRIS

                Okay, now roll it back.  Just roll it 

                back.  C mon dude, you need this for
                      (reading from book)

                 small motor skill development.   I 

                mean you want to be able to hold a 

                fork one day, right?  Use scissors?  

                Juggle?  You re right, I m not making 

                the most compelling argument.  Plus, 

                it s not like Thomas Edison s parents 

                had this book.  And that dude had mad 

                small motor skills, yo.  
                      (Joking)

                What we should be working on is 

                rolling the ball...with your mind. 
                      (now liking the idea)

                Okay, uh, just picture a small hand 

                  extending from your brain to the ball 

                and push.  You can do it.  Just focus, 

                Erns.  Harness the energy my jaded 

                psyche can t.  Roll it with your mind.

                What the hell are you talking about?

      CHRIS JUMPS UP.  SHEILA IS STANDING BEHIND HIM.

                                  CHRIS

                Sheila!  Hey!  We were just doing some 

                of those small-motor-skill exercises 

                you gave us.  

                                  SHEILA

                Really?  Because I m pretty sure I 

                heard you say his brain has a hand.

                                  CHRIS
                      (Chris stops, takes a deep 
                        breath, and steels himself)

                Yes, you re right, I did say that.  

                But only because, to be perfectly 

                honest, it is my belief that the 

                child s mind is perhaps more powerful 

                than Western culture is willing and/or 

                able to accept.  

                                  SHEILA

                So you were telling Ernie that he has 

                psychic powers?

                                  CHRIS

                Before society tells him otherwise.  

                As, perhaps, it did with us.                                             DILFs - "PILOT"              14.

                Yes.

                Then knock yourself out.  Lord knows 

                he ll need something to edge out the 

                billion Chinese geniuses applying to 

                Harvard.  

                                  CHRIS
                      (shocked and encouraged she 
                        did not rip his head off)

                You re so right.  Yes.  

                                  SHEILA

                Okay, well we re off to the Museum of 

                Modern Art.  Heard of it?  You can 

                pick him up next Friday, regular time. 

                                  CHRIS

                Regular time.
                      (Trying to be casual)

                Oh, and is there any way you could 

                watch him for a couple hours on 

                  Saturday?

                                  SHEILA

                                  CHRIS
                      (summons courage then)

                I have a date.                                            DILFs - "PILOT"              15.

                A date?

                                  CHRIS

                Yes.

                                  SHEILA

                Then no.

                      (Gloves immediately come off)

                No.  Just like that.  No.

                                  SHEILA

                Why should I watch him so you can go 

                on a date?  If you were getting 

                surgery, sure.  
                      (Chris grimaces at this)

                But a date?  No way.  What s wrong 

                with you?

                                  CHRIS

                Oh right, because god forbid I 

                actually move on with my life.  Or is 

                it that I might find someone better 

                for me out there than you?  Or that 

                maybe Ernie will have a kick-ass 

                stepmom like in that movie  Stepmom. 

                                  SHEILA

                would it be okay if I got a baby-

                sitter?

                                  SHEILA

                We ve talked about this, Chris.  Baby-

                sitters don t watch your kid, they 

                throw them in front of the TV, invite 

                their boyfriend over and have sex in 

                the parents  bed.  I know.  I baby-sat 

                my way through law school.  And the 

                ones who don t invite their boyfriends 

                over are so hard up they steal your 

                baby to start their own family.

                                  CHRIS

                I think there might be a middle 

                ground.

                                  SHEILA

                be great...for my opponent when I run

                because the whole reason we got

                It s fine, Nick.  Honestly, it s my 

                fault for marrying a caring guy.  

                Violet is marrying for money whether 

                she likes it or not.

                the SkyMall Catalog.  This is so
