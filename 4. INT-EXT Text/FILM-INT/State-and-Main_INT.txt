Morris and Spud, two codgers, are about to cross the street
when they hear a beeping and stop.
As they cross, we see the tail end of a van, and the group
nods in that direction.
MORRIS
You hear that?
SPUD
Yes, I hear it.
MORRIS
Drive a man to drink.
Took me near half
an-hour, get across the street
yesterday.
SPUD
I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank
of the building.
Said, "What are you
doin'?"
He said, "I'm waitin' for the
'leven o'clock crossing..."
As Morris and Spud speak a car is coming down the street, and
bounces in the pothole.
MORRIS
Y'wanna fix something, you should fix
the pothole.
Yessir, they should be
trussed up, thrown off some high
building.
DOUG MACKENZIE, a young Republican type, walks up to join
them.
DOUG
Who's that?
MORRIS
Whoever spent ten, f'teen thousand
dollars, a new traffic light, you could
grow old, paint your house before it
lets you cross the street, and then, not
fix the pothole.
SPUD
What was wrong with the old traffic
light?
They enter the Coffee Corner.
Carla is serving the folk, and
Jack the owner is behind the counter.
DOUG
I'm glad you asked... I'll tell you what
was wrong with it.
And what was wrong
with it was it was behind the times.
Now: You want to bring business into
this town?
You have to plan for a
Waterford that Does Not Exist.
Not at
the moment, no...
ANN
Morning, darling.
DOUG
Morning.
CARLA
Hi, Annie.
Ann hands Carla a poster.
ANN
Morning, Carla.
Doug and the two codgers move to a table by the window where
Carla, the nubile waitress, brings them coffee.
Ann talks to
a woman at the counter.
MORRIS
...the damn thing...
SPUD
No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a
lot of people are pretty upset...
DOUG
They are, yes.
I'm sure they are...
WOMAN AT COUNTER

ANN
S'Okay, Maude.

DOUG

MAUDE

ANN
We'll work it out.
JACK
What're they talking about?
ANN
Traffic light.
JACK
Waal, no, th'traffic light's Doug's
thing.
That's his thing, fine.
DOUG
Thank you, Jack, and...
JACK
But we got to talk about the pothole.
DOUG

This is why this is America.

UBERTO is asleep.
Bill wakes him up.

BILL
They're holding our Old Mill for ransom.

We don't have to build it.
He shows Uberto the brochure.

Walt shows Uberto the Firehouse.
Uberto looks through the

BILL
NO, we can't ever go back to New
Hampshire.
A pick-up truck with two calves in it stops, the driver seen
from the back is a farmer smoking a pipe.
WALT
NO, we're gonna stay here.
This is what
my people died for.
The right to make a
movie in this town.
A desk clerk, SCOTT, looks up.
Behind the desk a display of
several souvenir plates, "Souvenir of Waterford, VT", with a
picture of the Old Mill on them.
Walt picks one up and hands
it to Bill.
SCOTT
May I help you?
WALT

I want to talk to the manager.
Walt talks into his cell phone as he talks to Scott.
SCOTT
Would you like a room?

about three percent of the adjusted
gross of a Major Motion Picture.
Sign reads THREE DAYS till shoot.
Walt is on the phone.
Covers the phone.
Crossed sticks on
the wall, Walt plays with a shuffleboard discus.
Girl P.A.
brings cup of coffee to Walt.
Her T-shirt reads: "DOES IT
HAVE TO BE AN OLD MILL?"
WALT
(to A.D.)
No, he doesn't want to work out with
Waterford Huskies...Because he's Bob
Barrenger...Call up his girl in Aspen,
have 'em ship his weight...Yeah, well,
fine, he's not gonna do the Pond scene
unless he can work out.
Call up his
girl in Aspen, and have her ship the
weights out...
Walt hangs up the phone.
Secretary enters with folders that
she hands to Walt.
WALT (CONT'D)
Who designed these costumes?
Who
designed these costumes?
It looks like
Edith Head puked and that puke designed
these costumes.
Get Madge.
SECRETARY
(to A.D.)
Your wife is on the phone.
WALT
I have no wife.
A P.A. comes in with a big bakery box.
They open it to show
it is a huge loaf of bread, and on it is written, in bread,
"Waterford Welcomes The Old Mill."
WALT (CONT'D)
(calling out)
We need a new name for the movie.
Where's the writer?
UBERTO
(entering with storyboards)
Wally, I got to takes out the window
from the dog.
I can't shoot through...
CAMERA MOVES on past the production board, where we see
"Dinner With Mayor" in red.
And the costume designer comes
up.
COSTUME DESIGNER
...Claire's got a problem.
UBERTO
Wally, if I hafes a moment of your time,
look at these storyboards.
THIS SHOOT,
I can't shoot this shot, you want.
WALT
Why?
UBERTO
Because they gots a window with a dogs
in it.
You want me to "push in."
Or
can I lose the shot.
WALT
No you can't lose the shot.
The meaning
of the film is in that shot.
UBERTO
But, Wally, the window of the firehut...
WALT
I don't care.
Fix it.
He goes into comfab with the costume designer.
WALT (CONT'D)
(of sketches)
You show Claire these sketches?
COSTUME DESIGNER
Yes.
WALT
Did she throw up?
COSTUME DESIGNER
That isn't very nice.
WALT
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in
the World Court.
Did she like the
costumes?
COSTUME DESIGNER
I can't tell.
WALT
Why not?
COSTUME DESIGNER
She won't stop crying...
WALT
(to an A.D.)
Find out when Marty Rossen's arriving,
get him a bunch of Lilacs to send to the
broad.
FIRST A.D.
Towns out of Lilacs.
WALT
You go in her room, take the Lilacs from
the water, dry them.
Go buy some
cellophane, wrap 'em up, and get a card
from Marty.
(to costume designer)
What's her problem?
COSTUME DESIGNER
She doesn't want to bare her breasts.
WALT
She doesn't want to bare her
breasts...what, in the "nude scene?"
What are we paying her three mil for?
COSTUME DESIGNER
She's got "religion."
WALT
Her religion bars her from fulfilling
her contr...
CAMERA FOLLOWS Walt to the sound of crying.
We HEAR CRYING
from the next room.
Walt opens the door quietly.
WALT (CONT'D)
Claire?...Claire?
(to Uberto)
Just figure out how to take the shot.
Claire...Claire?
It's Wally.
(pause)
May I come in?
BEAT.
He motions his entourage to stand back.
He enters the room. CAMERA FOLLOWS.
WALT
(softly)
What is it, Pal...?
PAUSE.
Claire MUMBLES.
WALT (CONT'D)
What...?
CLAIRE
I can't do it, Walt.
WALT
You can't do what?
CLAIRE
It isn't right.
I can't...I...I know I
si...I, they, I don't know if they told
me it was in the con...
WALT
Forget the contract.
Claire.
What is
it?
CLAIRE
I don't want to take my shirt off in
that con...what are these things that
they're asking of me...?
Wha...wha...
wha... I try to be good.
The only thing
I care about is...
WALT
I know that...
CLAIRE
Is...is the MOVIE!
As they talk, the A.D.'s come in and hand him sheets to
approve.
WALT
I know that, Claire.
I, we all know...
CLAIRE
Everybody, they, they, they treat me
like a...
WALT
...no, they don't.
CLAIRE
...they treat me like a child.
I,
I...to bare my body.
WALT
Now, look.
Claire: Listen to me.
(he takes her hand in his)
I want to tell you a story.
The door to her room opens.
A P.A. brings in a bunch of
Lilacs, hands them to Walt.
WALT (CONT'D)
Fuck flowers, we aren't talking about
flowers, we're talking about a human
being.
CLAIRE
I...I...
WALT
Who are these from?
PROD. ASST.
Marty.
WALT
Well that's very thoughtful of him.
Elanora Duse...
CLAIRE
...I can't do it, Wally...
WALT
Listen to me.
Elanora Duse was playing
Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty
could not get a ticket.
She said, "I'm
not doing the seven shows a week I
signed for."
She said, "I cannot bare
my soul seven times a week.
I am an
artist.
I'll do four shows a week."
(pause)
The greatest actress of her time.
You
know what her Producer said?
CLAIRE
(pause; softly)
What?
WALT
Nothing.
He held her and he wept.
Because he...
CLAIRE
...I...
WALT
Because he understood.
That was her
life's blood on the stage.
Claire nods, breaks into sobs.
WALT (CONT'D)
...I know...I know...
CLAIRE
(pause)
...and, and, and did she?
And she did
the seven shows?
WALT
No, she didn't Claire.
But I think you
should do the scene.
Secretary comes in with memos and Walt deals with them while
comforting Claire.
BEAT.
She sobs.
She shakes her head.
She brings herself
under control.
CLAIRE
Wally...
WALT
I know, I know.
He puts his arm around her, starts walking toward the door.
WALT (CONT'D)
I know, it's the hardest thing in the
world.
And it seems everybody wants...
CLAIRE
Yes...
WALT
...wants a piece...
CLAIRE
Yes...
WALT
And you know what?
CLAIRE
We, we have to give it.
WALT
(nods)
...and my heart goes out to you, because
I know...
He opens the door.
We HEAR the First A.D. and the Costume
Designer chatting outside the door as they walk out.
WALT
That, that's your life's blood on the
st...
FIRST A.D.
I don't know what she's bitching about,
she's flashed her tits in the last five
movies, she'd bare her breasts to do
voice over.
CAMERA FOLLOWS the two out.
A tableau of the four of them.
The First A.D. drinking coffee, sees he has been overheard.
BEAT
Claire starts soundlessly heaving, sobbing.
She goes "Oh!"
as if she has just been hit in the stomach, falls back into
the room, closes the door.
Sobbing sounds emanate.
FIRST A.D. (CONT'D)
I...
WALT
Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York,
tell him she's breaking her contract and
we're very up...
FIRST A.D.
I...
WALT
We're very upset with her.
Get someone
to double for her, her tits, the tits
scene.
Call L.A.
I want to see some
pictures of the women's tits.
Of their
tits.
FIRST A.D.
I'm very sorry I...
WALT
You're very sorry, you passive
aggressive, son-of-a-bitch!
Can we
replace him?
BILL
We start shooting in three days.
COSTUME DESIGNER
You want to see the fireman's costumes?
Cause I found this Moleskin for the
collar, it's not black, but it looks
black...
it's not brown, but...
SECRETARY
Marty Rossen's touched down.
Bob is doing Tai Chi.
Knock on the door.
He goes to open
it.
Carla is bringing him his dinner.
BOB
Yeah.
Come in.
She comes in.
BOB (CONT'D)
I'm just...
She puts his dinner down on the coffee table.
He takes out
money from his pants to pay her.
CARLA
The prices are going up.
BOB
But, that's the way of the world, huh?
Everybody's gotta eat.
Way of the
world.
He sits before his dinner, hands her some money.
Remembers
himself.
BOB (CONT'D)
Well, I'm pretty impolite.
Would you
like some?
CARLA
I don't eat vegetables.
BOB
Well, I can offer you something to
drink?
CARLA
Sure, what have you got?
BOB
What do you drink?
CARLA
Bourbon and milk.
BOB
How old are you?
Carla WHISPERS her age to him.
He makes her a drink out of
his fridge, hands it to her.
BOB (CONT'D)
Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone I
gave you this.
CARLA
I wouldn't tell anyone anything that
happened between me and somebody who was
my friend.
PAUSE
BOB
Nice town that you've got here.
CARLA
You want to see it better, we could go
out on the roof.
BOB
...wouldn't that be dangerous?
CARLA
...not if you've got something to hold
on to.
Marty and Walt et al studying various documents.
Claire
sitting there.
MARTY
I want to tell you something, Wally,
he's a pussycat.
My thing is to see everybody does what
they said they would and I have to do
that.
Now: what is this you want Eight
hundred Thousand Dollars to do what
you're being paid to, you already signed
you'd do...?
(pause)
What is that?
CLAIRE
I think I should talk to my agent,
Marty, you and I should, we should
really not discuss...
MARTY
Who is her agent?
BILL
Mitch Cohn...
CLAIRE
He's...
MARTY
Get him on the phone.
CLAIRE
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
MARTY
Get him on the...
Claire starts back to her room.
MARTY (CONT'D)
I want you to hear this.
CLAIRE
I really think that business...matters
should be discussed between you t...
MARTY
Well, I'm going to discuss 'em between
you, babe, cause it's your idea, and you
think you're going to sign to do a, then
hold us up in the wilds sweetheart, you

Bill hands him the phone.
BILL
He's on the ph...
MARTY

Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
BILL

MARTY
I'm somewhere in the, I'm on location

Akron, I'm talking about Restraint of
Trade, Breach of...IT'S VERY SIMPLE...!
Joe enters.
His finger BANDAGED.
JOE
(tentatively)
Hi!
MARTY
Her tits!
Her tits!
How, that she
signed IN HER CONTRACT, we hired her
'cause of ten years at the Actors
Studio?
The way she played Medea?
Her
last two pictures laid there on the
screen like my first wife...
CLAIRE
(starts to cry)
You have no right to...
MARTY
Cool it babe, you started this...
JOE
What's the...
WALT
Where have you been?
MARTY
(on phone)
You tell me: you tell me now, I've got
to shoot on Wednesday and I will not pay
your Blood Money and P.S., pal, I put
the word out on the street and Betty
Boop can look for work in
squigglevision.
Claire starts to get up.
MARTY (CONT'D)
Siddown!
JOE
I really don't think you should be
talking this way to a lady.
MARTY
...would you excuse me, please...
CLAIRE
You can't treat me like this.
I'm not a
child!
JOE
She's absolutely r...
CLAIRE
I'm not a child.
I have feelings...
Don't you...don't, don't...don't...
Claire exits, crying.
MARTY
(his suitcase next to him -
into phone)
Well, you call him, and call me back,
but this is it, pal.
You fuck with me,
and I'm going to tear out your heart and
piss on your lungs through the hole in
your chest.
And the best to Marion...
(beat; hangs up; to Joe)
Where have you been?
JOE
I...
MARTY
He says they're looking for you all day,
you're on salary, he needs pages, what
are you, you been 'haying?' Now:
WALT
Marty...
MARTY
Later for that, Walt, let's get this: we
need the "pages" for the new "Old
Mill"... alright?
We need a new title,
we need a...
BILL
Rewrites that Bob Barrenger requested...
the "dead horse scene," the...
MARTY
Whatever it is.
Go do it.
How you
doing on the permit?
WALT
It's just a formality.
MARTY
That's why I want it.
(to Joe)
Type it up and get it back to me in...
JOE
I can't.
WALT
Why?
MARTY
You can't write it?
JOE
I can write it.
I can't type it.
WALT
Why?
JOE
I hurt my fingers.
WALT
Get a typist.
Get'im a typist.
Get
outta here.
Joe exits.
They turn to survey the board.
MARTY
Eight-hundred grand to show her tits...
WALT
Pay her.
MARTY
I don't got the money.
WALT
Find the money.
MARTY
I got a company...give us a million
dollars, put their product in the film.
WALT
(looking at a paper Marty hands
him)
No no no no no no no no find me the
money...
Joe takes out paper, looks around.
Sighs.
Picks up phone,
calls back.
JOE
(into phone)
This is Joe White... in six ten, they're
sending up a typist?
He takes out a sheet of foolscap and a pencil.
Starts to
write.
A knock at the door.
JOE (CONT'D)
(into phone)
Okay, I thank you.
It's here.
He hangs up the phone, goes to the door, opens it.
It is
Claire.
CLAIRE
You said, "You can't talk that way to a
lady..."
You stood up for me.
(beat)
What do you have to drink?
She looks around, sees a gift basket containing a bottle of
Stolichnaya and a box of matzoh, wrapped with a "Welcome
Back" ribbon.
CLAIRE (CONT'D)
Matzoh!
Are you Jewish?
JOE
I, actually, yes.
CLAIRE
I love Jewish men.
JOE
Why?
CLAIRE
You know...where's your bathroom?
She goes into the bathroom.
JOE
You liked the script, huh...?
Joe is standing by the side of the bed, holding Claire's
clothes, trying to induce her to put them on.
She is sitting
on the side of the bed, naked.
JOE
Look.
CLAIRE
I feel so close to you...
JOE
Look, look, I like you very much...
CLAIRE
I like you, too.
JOE
But not that way...
CLAIRE
But we...
JOE
Look, look there's someone else...
Sound of a KNOCK at the door.
JOE (CONT'D)
Great.
Who is it?
ANN (O.S.)
"Room Service!"
JOE
(to Claire)
Would you go in...
He gestures to the bathroom, he hands her her clothes.
JOE (CONT'D)
Would you put on your cl...
(to door)
Just leave it outside
ANN
You have to sign for it.
Ann hurriedly arranging the flowers in the "platen" of the
typewriter.
From inside the room we hear Joe's voice:
"Alright, one moment!"
He opens the door.
ANN
I'm gonna be your typist for this
evening.
JOE
Oh, G-d...
ANN
And here's some hydrogen peroxide...
JOE
I don't drink.
ANN
It's for your finger.
JOE
One moment.
He closes the door.
Claire is still sitting on the bed, has a lit cigarette.
Poured herself a drink.
Joe goes over to her, thrusts her
clothes on the floor.
JOE
You have to hide.
CLAIRE
Who is that?
JOE
That's my...
CLAIRE
Oh.
JOE
Will you help me out...?
CLAIRE
I...
Joe hustles back to the door.
Opens the door.
Ann is still
standing there with the typewriter.
JOE
Hi.
ANN
You going to ask me in?
Joe looks back over his shoulder.
ANN (CONT'D)
Thought you might like this.
She hands him a bouquet.
JOE
(takes flowers)
Thank you.
ANN
Read the card.
JOE
(reading card)
"To the love of my life, Love, Doug."
ANN
The other side.
JOE
Oh.
He turns the card over.
ANN
Don't you think you should put them in
water.
JOE
Why?
ANN
...because if you don't, they die.
She goes into the bathroom, fills up the vase.
Comes out.
ANN (CONT'D)
Shouldn't we start?
PAUSE
JOE
Start?
This isn't a good time.
ANN
Oh.
That's alright.
Then I'll come
back at a better time.
What would be a
better time.
JOE
Later on.
ANN
Then I'll come back, then.
JOE
You, um, you, um, you going out with
your fiance?
ANN
No, I just broke up with him.
I'll see
you tomorrow.
She starts to exit.
Ann digs in pocket, takes out the lure we previously saw in
Joe's finger.
She re-enters the room.
ANN
It occurred to me, you'd wanna have
this: sort of a memento of our...
ANGLE ON ROOM
Claire is standing there, basically naked.
PAUSE.
CLAIRE
Hi.
I hope I'm not disturbing...
JOE
She came in here, wait, she...I was
giving her a massage...wait...wait!
She
came in here...she...
(to Claire)
...with respect...she took off her
clothes, and she got in bed, I told her
I could not -- we don't know each other,
you see...
CLAIRE
We had a script conference.
JOE
I told her thank you very much, but it
was inconvenient because, uh, because...
ANN
You can do it.
JOE
Because I'd met someone else.
ANN
(very simply)
Oh, okay.
JOE
You believe that?
ANN
I do if you do.
PAUSE
JOE
But it's absurd.
ANN
So is our electoral process.
But we
still vote.
JOE
Do you truly believe the electoral
process is absurd?
ANN
I used to go out with a politician.
JOE
You used to go out with him, you broke
up with him?
ANN
Sure did.
JOE
Why?
ANN
Time for a change.
Keep your margins
straight.
JOE
Yes.
ANN
Go you Huskies!
Ann puts down the typewriter and types into it, "The truth
may not always set you free, but it is always the truth -
Joseph Turner White, 'Anguish.'"
She affixes the lure to it
and leaves them on the typewriter.
She starts down the hall,
humming.
Behind her we see the door to Bob Barrenger's room
open.
Bob comes out, looks down the hall.
The coast is
clear.
Carla comes out.
They kiss chastely, say goodnight.
She starts down the hall, humming.
Geezers are at the front table in the window.
Carla's
father, JACK, behind the counter trying to assemble an
espresso machine, reading from the instructions.
MORRIS
"Assembly of Death" did 95 million
dollars the first weekend.
SPUD
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
MORRIS
You think so?
SPUD
Waal, what was the per-screen
average...?
Joe enters and exchanges greetings with the locals.
He
changes his glasses and takes out a notebook.
He is shaking
his head as he does so...
JOE
Cuppa coffee, and a...
JACK
With you inna moment.
I'm a little
short-handed.
MORRIS
Where's Carla?
Ann enters.
SPUD
Hiya, Annie...
A crowd has gathered around the table as he tells the story.
MORRIS
Annie, sorry I ain't been to a meetin'
of the Drama Club...
Ann shows a sniped "canceled" poster of her play.
MORRIS (CONT'D)
Oh, good...
He resumes talking to his companion.
ANN
Good morning to you...whatsa matter?
JOE
I can't get it to come out right.
ANN
What's the scene...
JOE
It used to be the Old Mill.
ANN
What've you got?
JOE
They meet on Main Street.
Her horse has
just died.
He's coming from the fire.
He shuffles through his pages, he goes in his pocket for a
note, he brings out the old lure.
He smiles at her, she
smiles back.
JACK (O.S.)
Annie, you want something to eat?
ANN
What's the scene about...?
JOE
It's good to see you, too...
JACK
Annie?
ANN
What about...what about...it's so
presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling
you how to wr...
JOE
Please...
ANN
How about, he sees her on the street, he
wipes the soot from his eyes.
He goes
up to her.
"What happened to the
horse?"
She looks at him.
She takes
his hand...
She takes Joe's hand, and he winces.
JOE
Ah, ah, ah...
ANN
I hurt you?
MORRIS
What happened to his finger?
ANN
It was burnt.
MORRIS
Mmm.
ANN
And then it was really hurt.
JOE
Ah, ah, ah.
That's what she says,
that's what she says.
He says, "Sister,
I've come from a fire..."
But she, but
she, she says it was not the fire which
hurt you...it...
MORRIS
...how was it hurt?
ANN
...he stuck a fishhook in it.
(Morris nods)
JOE
She realizes -- it was not the fire
which hurt him...that the true hurt was
her.
Was her...
ANN
...yes.
JOE
...her unbridled sexuality.
That he...
ANN
...yes.
JOE
Has been wounded by her heat...by her
infidelities...
JACK
Anybody here seen Carla?
JOE
Because, because, because if it's about
purity, it's...it's...and then, then,
you don't need the nude scene.
ANN
Because it's about purity...
JOE
That's...that's exactly what it's about.
Take...
ANN
That's right...
JOE
...take any two people...
JACK
...anybody seen my daughter...?
JOE
...take you and me...
He runs out.
Uberto looking at storyboards and spinning the discuss and
shaking his head.
Walt on the phone.
First A.D. shows up.
WALT
(on phone)
...the finest people you could ever hope
to work with...
(to First A.D.)
You have the new Old Mill pages?
FIRST A.D.
I can't find the writer.
WALT
(on phone)
...totally false...totally false.
He is
the, I would say the most responsible
human being I have ever...
FIRST A.D.
I have to talk to you.
My wife...
WALT
Not now.
FIRST A.D.
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
WALT
Oh, that's great.
Let's bring more
people into this overcrowded world.
Girl P.A. walks through the b.g. in "Does it have to be an
Old Mill?" T-shirt.
WALT (CONT'D)
Take it off.
Take that stupid fucking
shirt off right now.
(into phone)
Well, if I had to say one thing, I would
say it's purity.
Claire shows up, dressed in traveling clothes, her luggage
behind her, followed by production assistant.
WALT (CONT'D)
(to P.A.)
Not now, I'm talking to the press.
Claire!
CLAIRE
What?
I have a five-o'clock plane to
catch.
WALT
I, uh...
(into phone)
I've always thought so...
(beat)
Well, you just get an idea, and try to
find the best way to express it in
pictorial form.
(to Claire)
I've written a letter to the studio and
to SAG protesting...
(opens door)
Bill: get a copy of that letter...!
(closes door)
I just wanted to tell you that I am past
chagrined, I'm mortified at the way you
were spoken to...
CLAIRE
I...
WALT
An artist of your caliber...
CLAIRE
I'm only trying to...
WALT
I know what you are, I am so sorry that
you...when I read that script I said
there's only one person to play that
part.
CLAIRE
The minute I read that script I said...
WALT
I know...
CLAIRE
...she works with animals, she...
WALT
...yes...
CLAIRE
...she has a home...
WALT
...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes,
a woman who...the...the community
respects her.
(beat)
Please don't go.
(pause)
Please don't go.
What can I do but
beseech you...?
Trauma, toil...when are
we free of them...?
(pause)
When...?
CLAIRE
He treated me as if I were a child...
WALT
Claire:
(pause)
As an interpretive artist to a creative
artist:
(pause)
Stay with me.
(pause)
I need you.
(pause)
We start to shoot tomorrow and then it
belongs to us.
Stay.
(pause)
Stay.
Tonight...when...
(gestures outside)
When they've gone.
Let's talk.
Let's
really talk.
We could, we'll have
dinner, we'll...a bottle of some bad red
wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...
CLAIRE
I'm sorry, Walt -- it's gone beyond
that.
Claire exits.
WALT
(into phone)
Well, I've enjoyed it, too.
Any...
any...any time...
(hangs up the phone)
What does the woman want from life?
MARTY
She wants eight-hundred thousand dollars
to show her tits.
WALT
Pay her off.
MARTY
We don't have the money.
WALT
Find it.
MARTY
If you do the product placement...
WALT
It's a computer company...IT'S A
COMPUTER COMPANY - BAZOOMER-COM?!
MARTY
"Bazoomer dot com."
WALT
I can't put a computer in a movie shot
in 1895...you wanna tell me how I'm
gonna do that?
MARTY
Actually, the art department had some
ideas on...
WALT
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.
DID YOU
HEAR ME?!
MARTY
(picks up the phone and dials)
Gimme Howie Gold.
Howie?
Thizz...I

Joe barges in.
JOE
She doesn't show her tits!!! She doesn't
show her tits.
The breasts symbolize
motherhood, the audience...
MARTY
The breasts symbolize motherhood...
Joe holding forth to Bill, Walt and Marty.
Joe consults his
notes, changes his glasses, reads on:
JOE
The movie's about purity.
So we don't
show her breasts.
We show them to him.
She keeps her back to the camera.
WALT
...she keeps her back to the camera?
BILL
It'll hurt the box-office.
JOE
They know what her tits look like.
WALT
Know?
They could draw them from memory.
You're fantastic.
What a find you are.
Get outta here.
We need the Dead Horse
scene.
JOE
I'm gonna nail it.
WALT
I know you are.
Go you Huskies.
Joe exits.
We see the notation, "Dinner at the Mayor's
House."
We see Marty walk up to a P.A. in the next room.
The P.A.
hands Marty a slip of paper.
Walt goes to them.
MARTY
We got the permit.
WALT
Is that one hell of a kid?
MARTY
He just saved us eight-hundred thousand
bucks.
WALT
He's got a gift for fiction.
MARTY
We got to do something nice for him.
He takes out his cardcase.
MARTY (CONT'D)
Gimme a pencil.
Get him a bottle

Stick
this card on it, and put it in his room.
PROD. ASST.
Maple syrup.
Marty writes on the card.
MARTY
Yeah.
ANGLE ON CARD
It reads: "Your gift for fiction everything sweet."
ANGLE ON WALT
As he walks back into the other room, holding the permit.
MARTY (CONT'D)
(in b.g. as he takes back the
card)
Hold on, I wanna add to that.
We see him take the card, write "Over" on it and draw an
arrow.
Bob is being bandaged by Doc Wilson.
Marty on the phone.
Walt, the First A.D., and Joe also in the room.

There is an abrupt knocking at the door.
WALT
Who is it?
CAL
Thiz the police.
Is Mr. Barrenger in

The boys in the room go into a whisper conference.
MARTY
Okay, look, you, what is she, 19,

Look: okay.
Okay.
Look: look you're

MARTY
Nobody knows it but us.
Alright?

Because it's sink or swim here, pals...
They murmur their assent.
Knocking is repeated.

BOB
No.
CAL

BOB
I was alone in the car.
I was driving.
The cop is writing down these statements.
CAL
Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very
sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could
be, but...
MARTY
I'm an attorney, if there's anything you
have to say to...
CAL
...I have to give you this ticket for
damage to city property.
I'm really
sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope
you'll excuse...
MARTY
(beat)
You have to what?
Cal reaches in back of him, on his belt, and takes out not
the cuffs, but the summons book, he starts to write a
summons.
CAL
It's a formality.
Any case of damage to
city prop...you hit the control box of
the new stop light, and...
(apologetically he hands the
ticket to Bob)
They'll, uh, these things happen, I hope
you're alright, and that you're

Well, officer, don't worry ab...

If there's anything I...
Marty walks him out into the hall.
Photographers and
onlookers in the hall.
Phone rings.
Walt answers it.
WALT

Yeah.
Hello, Mr. Mayor...Walt Price!
No, no, sir, he's fine.
Well, he's

Bob, are you alright?
The firetruck is being backed into the firestation.
Outside
a couple of passerbys are running in the rain, putting their
collars up.
We see Joe is in the firestation writing in his book.
As the
firetruck backs up we see the firedog bark, and Joe looks up.
ANGLE JOE'S POV
Ann is walking past the firestation.
Joe comes out to look
at her.
JOE
Hi.
ANN
Hi.
JOE
Where you going?
ANN
Going home.
They start to walk down the street in the rain.
JOE
Going home, yeah.
I told them what you
said...
ANN
(over a clap of thunder)
What?
JOE
I told them what you said about the
script...
They take refuge under the awning of the printshop.
ANN
I didn't say anything special, I was
just talking out loud.
JOE
...how else can you talk?
ANN
No, that's true.
JOE
No.
You, I told them, you can't betray
with the picture what you're saying with
the words.
And, I don't know, the
movies, I don't know.
They should be
socially uplifting, why does she have to

They look in the window of the old printshop, the awning
under which they have sheltered.
ANN
Yessuh.
Joseph Knights printshop.
Vacant for thirty years.
JOE
Is it...
ANN
Yep, n'it's for sale.
(pause)
One of the few things money can buy.
Joe looks in the window of the printshop.
JOE
I told them what you said about the

They take refuge under the awning of the printshop.

Would you like to see it?
I've got the
key back at my store...

I've always seen that.
WALT
We don't show her breasts, we just show

CLAIRE
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I
can't tell you...
WALT
Well, Joe said it, and he's right.
Knock at the door.

You want...

DOC WILSON
Well, they don't always leave with the

Hope to tell you.
Didn't I pick the

Barrenger's actual head myself.

This young woman.
CARLA
Nobody touched me, I was at home.
MARTY

Who is it raped you?
CARLA
Nobody.
MARTY
Well, what's the beef?
DOUG
She was in the car with Bob Barrenger
last night.
And she was injured coming
home from a love tryst, so...
MARTY
You were in the car with Bob?
CARLA
No.
MARTY
Then what is the...?
He steps back into a linen closet, takes Doug with him by the
lapels.
MARTY
Now what is this, you sonofabitch!
Because if you haven't heard about the
laws of Malicious Prosecution, you're

DON'T FLINCH WHILE I'M
TALKING TO YOU, YOU TWO BIT SPEEDTRAP
FRAUD: There's an old saying, two
scariest things in the world, a black

THE CAR, SHE SAYS THAT SHE WASN'T IN THE

YOU KNOW IT.
SO I'M NOT PAYING PATSY
WITH YOU HERE, YOU MOTHERFUCKER.
Look
in my eyes: I made eleven million bucks
last year and I don't like being trifled
with.
Now I think that the better part
of valor, though we've got your back up
here...the better part of valor is to
step away.
Or, before G-d, I will see
you disbarred.

Now, what do you think?

We all have a movie to make.
Now, can

Many young people go to Hollywood.
I did...and we all dream of it, and

CAL
Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, but...
WALT
Here this dream world has come to you.
Now, you obviously have an active, a
vivid imagination.
CARLA

BOB
I swear that that woman in my room...
WALT
Be quiet, Bob.
A fertile mind.
Now we
can use that kind of people in our work.
Yes, we can.
Now, and this is what
occurs to me... There's a part in the
film...isn't that right, Marty?
Marty is perusing the lawbooks.
MARTY
Mmm.
WALT
That we could use you in and I think
that's quite a fine trade-off all around
and an ill wind that blows somebody
good.
MARTY

Here it is: Statutory r...blah, blah,
blah, blah... "statutory"...
"unsupported testimony by the..."

Hold on, Bobby.

You've got nothing and you know it.
By
G-d, you know it.
Harassment.
You need
a... even if this was true, you need a
witness.
You need someone puts her in
the car.
And you've got nothing.
Now
we all have...yes, give her that part in
the film.
(to Carla)
Yes, we'd love to have you... Now: we
all have more important things to do,
isn't that right...?
Marty starts ushering everyone out of the room.
MARTY (CONT'D)
Isn't that right?
I'm sorry that you
all went to this...
JACK
I knew she wasn't in the car.
MARTY
This has been just an unfortunate.
He ushers them out, the phone is ringing.
Walt picks it up.

and get out of this town in one piece?
BOB
I'm ready!

Marty talking with them, through the crowd, on the back of
which we see Ann and Joe.
DOUG
Well, you guess what.
The Mayor sent
me.
I have your Mr. Barrenger with a
history of...
MARTY
...a history of nothing, he was
acquitted.
DOUG
Moral turp...you're on my home court,
friend.
I have the Mayor and the town
behind me, and forget making your movie:
I may own the studio when I get through
with you: I got a civil suit, I got
rape, I got collusion...
MARTY
You've got nothing, you don't have a
witness...
DOUG
And I've got a witness!
Your Mr. White
saw the crime.
MARTY
He told you that!?
DOUG
He didn't have to tell.
MARTY
I want to talk to him.
Would you ex...
DOUG
Oh, you're his attorney, too?
MARTY
Later for you, pal.
DOUG
Okay.
He motions the cop to take out Barrenger.
Marty sees Joe in
the back.
MARTY
Bobby, don't say anything.
BOB
Nothing happened.
DOUG
We'll see about that at the inquest.
ANGLE ON
Marty, as he leads Joe down into an alleyway, and into a
backyard, hung with washing on the lines.
MARTY
Yeah, hi, pal.
I need to talk to you.
Ann, Joe and Marty.
Cal has followed them into the
bookstore.
He speaks privately with Ann and exits.
ANN
What is it all about?
JOE
I saw...
MARTY
How do they know that, you told them?
JOE
No.
MARTY
What did you say to them?
JOE
I didn't say anything to them.
MARTY
How do you know you saw it?
JOE
I don't know.
MARTY
Well, then, you didn't see it, right?
JOE
I don't...
MARTY
You didn't see it...
JOE
I...?
I saw it.
I was there.
MARTY
You were there.
At...at 10:35...?
Joe takes the arrest warrant.
Looks at it.
Changes his
glasses.
JOE
(as he reads)
I was walking down the street...I
remember, I was writing a...
MARTY
What glasses were you wearing?
(pause)
Were you wearing your reading glasses?
JOE
I...
MARTY
You told me you were writing.
Don't you
wear your reading glasses to write...?
Marty's cellphone rings and he answers it.
After a pause, he
hangs up.
MARTY (CONT'D)
I've got to go to the jail.
He exits, leaving Walt alone with Ann and Joe.
ANGLE ON
Ann.
She sees something down the other street.
We see Cal,
the policeman, enter and start toward Joe.
We see Ann
restrain him, and speak to him in the b.g. for several
moments.
He shakes his head, and she reasons with him, and
there is a pause and he looks at Joe, and exits.
BEAT
ANN
...he's going to give you a couple of
minutes.
PAUSE
Joe walks Ann off to the closed back door of "The Waterford
Players."
JOE
What am I gonna do?
ANN
You got to tell 'em that you saw the
accident.
Don't you?
JOE
I can't do that.
(pause)
If I tell them, they'll, if I tell them,
they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...
it'll ruin his career...
ANN
But that's what happened.
JOE
But it'll stop the movie.
ANN
Maybe they'll be other movies.
JOE
They'll...they'll blackball me.
ANN
Carla was in the car, right?
JOE
I...I think that's right.
ANN
...you think that's right...
PAUSE
JOE
What'm I gonna do?
Ann picks up a copy of the old Waterford Sentinel, which was
left on the coffee table.
Ann hands the paper to Joe.
ANGLE ON
Joe, holding the paper.
ANGLE INS.
The masthead reads, "Waterford Sentinel, All the News of the
Mountains, 'You Shall Not Bear False
Witness.'"
ANGLE ON
Ann, who has also picked up the "For Sale" sign, showing the
printshop.
She stands looking at Joe.
BEAT.
Cal enters.
They look towards him.
CAL
Lotta hubbub on the street.
I'm taking
you the back way.
Joe coming in through the side entrance of the courtroom.
Various law books and dusty forms on the shelves.
Cal leads
him into the courtroom, empty, save for the court reporter,
Maude and the BAILIFF.
Cal motions Joe forward.
CAL
...Joseph Turner White...
BAILIFF
Hear ye, hear ye.
Sixth District Court.
And for the county of Kadona, State of
Vermont, the honorable James Addison
Flynn presiding.
All those having
business before this court, draw forward
and you will be heard.
Judge enters.
BAILIFF (CONT'D)
All rise.
JUDGE
Please...Mr. White?
This is a simple
matter of...
Scott hands him a sheet of paper.
JUDGE (CONT'D)
Uh huh, all we need's a simple fact or
to...you're going to give your
recollection of the accident last
evening, at the corner, State and Main.
Would you please swear him in.
BAILIFF
Do you swear to tell the truth...
Joe, coming in, a hangdog look on his face.
P.A.
(to Joe)
They need those rewrites on the "Old
Mill" scene...
Joe nods.
Continues through the lobby.
ANGLE ON
Various reporters, Scott being interviewed.
SCOTT
...about his personal life, though I can
tell you a few things about...
Joe walks past.
JOE
Would you please hold all calls to my
room?
SCOTT
Though I can tell you a few things about
his dietary requirements.
The old bellhop is packing up his lunchbox and changing into
his streetclothes.
Joe enters and takes out his pad and pencil.
He sits on the
bed.
On the pillow, he sees and picks up a black and red
hunting jacket, onto which the one foot short sleeve has been
knitted in baby blue.
There is a card in the picket that
reads "Better than new -- it's got a story!"
He puts it
down.
He picks up his notebook, in which he has written: "The
Purpose of the Second Chance is to allow you to make the same
mistake twice."
He stops by the mirror on the chiffonier into which he puts
the lure, which still has the attached card reading "The
truth may not always set you free, but it's always the truth
- Joseph Turner White."
Joe goes to the bed.
On the bed is a small package tied with
ribbon.
Joe opens it.
ANGLE INS.
It is a small thing of maple syrup.
Attached to it is a card
reading: "It is your invention which makes everything sweet."
He takes off his jacket, and picks up his notebook.
Out of
his jacket pocket falls the old copy of the Waterford
Sentinel.
He picks it up.
ANGLE JOE'S POV
The masthead: Waterford Sentinel "The Voice of the Mountains,
You Shall Not Bear False Witness."
He puts the newspaper down.
Picks up the maple sugar card
again, and looks at it.
He sees an arrow and turns it over
ANGLE INS.
The back of the card reads: "How about an Associate Producer
credit...?"
He takes the paper, balls it up and throws them into the
trash.
He picks up the fishing lure which is resting on the
typewriter.
Puts it into his pocket, thinks again, throws it
in the trash.
Shakes his head, and picks up his suitcase and
starts packing...
Joe enters, and the camera takes him into the deserted
building, through the courtroom and, in back, he sees Ann
standing alone.
He walks back to her, through the doors
which appear to be the Judge's chambers.
ANGLE REVERSED
We show that the walls of the Courtroom are the set, and we
are back in the "Trials of the Heart" set.
Ann is sitting
there.
Reading her play by Joe White.
He looks at her for
an explanation.
Maude, the court reporter woman, is sitting
in the b.g.
Ann is knitting in pink wool.
ANN
I thought you needed to get it out of
your system.
Ann moves to embrace Joe.
They hear screaming.
They turn.
A crowd of people, TV technicians, and a view of Doug on a TV
monitor.
DOUG
...and to exterminate this vermin, yes,
I use that term, who have abused, who
have desecrated, yes, the license
granted to them by a gracious nation...
ANGLE ON
Marty and Walt, standing near the monitor, looking on.
Shaking their heads.
ANGLE ON
The monitor.
Doug, seen through the monitor.
DOUG (CONT'D)
...who spew filth and degradation...
(begins to wipe his head)
As he does so, a makeup person comes in and sponges him.
DOUG (CONT'D)
...thank you...
TV REPORTER
...you want to clean up?
ANGLE ON
Doug, seen "live" in the next room, starting to wipe his
brow.
DOUG
Yes, thank you.
ANGLE ON
Marty and Walt watching Doug, as he walks down the hall.
TECHNICIAN
Five minutes, and we're going live to
the network.
DOUG
(to himself)
...foreign, and un-American perversions
of the Democratic process.
By those we
have entrusted with our dreams...
ANGLE ON
Marty and Walt, looking on.
WALT
Do something.
MARTY
You tell me what to do, I'll do it.
They look on to the preparations for the TV.
WALT
...and I was just paying off my house in
Malibu...
Ann and Joe push through the crowd.
WALT (CONT'D)
Thank G-d, it's up to you, Pal.
Sup to
you...
JOE
I'm out.
WALT
I don't getcha.
JOE
The girl was in the car.
WALT
I treated you like a son or nephew.
JOE
It's no you, it's...
WALT
No, what is it?
JOE
I have to tell the truth.
WALT
...that's just so narrow...
JOE
The girl was in the car.
WALT
Then you're finished in show business.
JOE
So be it.
WALT
And my company sues your ass for sixty
million dollars.
JOE
For what cause?
WALT
I don't need a cause, just a lawyer.
HOWIE GOLD shows up holding his bag.
HOWIE
I'm a lawyer.
MARTY
Howie...
HOWIE
Yeah?
MARTY
What are you doing here?
HOWIE
What am I doing here is I just flew
seven hours cause you asked me here.
WALT
What for?
HOWIE
(presenting the bag)
For this...I hope you need it, cause
it's coming outta your budget...
ANGLE INS.:
The Bag, as Marty opens it - it's full of MONEY.
Doug is mopping his face up.
He looks up.
Marty is standing
there.
MARTY
Hi.
DOUG
I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
MARTY
I....
DOUG
...you know, there's nothing you could
say, that could possibly make a
difference, so, why don't you just save
your breath...
Marty puts the case up on the washstand.
DOUG (CONT'D)
What's in the case?
MARTY
Eight-hundred thousand dollars in cash.
PAUSE
DOUG
And what was it you wanted to say?
MARTY
Gut Yuntif.
Ann and Joe passing through.
They stop and Joe comes up to a
State Trooper.
As we press forward the Mob begins to reverse
direction and passes back towards Joe.
Leaving the Hall
empty, save for the Judge who comes out, putting his robs
into his golf bag.
JOE
(to Judge)
I've come to give myself up...
JUDGE
Well give yourself up to someone else.
I'm gonna get in some golf.
Hiya,
Annie.
Give yourself up to her.
And we see Joe has moved up to the TV monitor, where we see
Doug, in the Science Lab, talking to the press, and holding
his money bag in his arms.
DOUG
I have learned a lesson.
And the lesson
is this...that everybody needs a second
chance.
You, me, and these fine, film
people here.
You know, they have a high
profile, but that doesn't mean they
aren't deserving of our trust, and of
our respect.
You know, I think there is a lesson
here, and the lesson is this: it is a
lesson of Tolerance...and, as we look at
this industry, at this clean, American
industry, and as I begin my campaign for
congress...
