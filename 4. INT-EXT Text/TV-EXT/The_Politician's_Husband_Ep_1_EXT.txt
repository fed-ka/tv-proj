                    - For weeks Westminster been rife 
                    with rumours about his growing 
                      discontent with current Government 
                    policy - yet in his letter to the 
                    Prime Minister while he doesn t 
                    actually use the clich  that he s 
                    resigning to  spend more time with 
                    his family  but that s the essence 
                    of it - 


      DAY 

      Traffic laden street adjacent to COLLEGE GREEN - a MINISTRY 
      CAR is passing - Aiden is in the rear - his driver is KENNY 
      MOSS - solidly dependable if inclined towards self 
      importance -  

      They catch sight of the REPORTERS on the green - 

                                  KENNY
                    All kicking off now, Minister.

      Aiden s face - 



      A REPORTER is pacing outside the ENTRANCE on his MOBILE - 
      CLIFF LYMAN, veteran Broadsheet political journalist.  He 
      catches sight of THE PRIME MINISTER S CAR drawing up - 
      quickly disengages. 

      The grim faced PRIME MINISTER alights, pushes towards the 
      entrance.  Lyman quickly dives up to him-  any comment on 
      Aiden Hoyne s resignation, Prime Minister? - What do you 
      think he ll say in his speech today?     

      The PRIME MINISTER ducks the question - strides on - 



      - Tranquil suburban contours of the HOYNES home - 

                                  AIDEN
                    - With this in mind, I asked the 
                    Prime Minister to let me chair an 
                    all party committee to make an 
                      objective, bi partisan assessment 
                    on the immigration issue for the 
                    House -


      DAY 

      - A DRIVER stands attentively by a MINISTERIAL CAR - Bruce 
      approaches - the DRIVER opens the rear PASSENGER DOOR for 
      him.  As the DRIVER circles the car to get behind the wheel 
      - the opposite rear passenger door opens - Aiden abruptly 
      gets in beside Bruce.

      The air molecules between them vibrate with tension - the 
      DRIVER spins in his seat in alarm -

      Bruce recovers his poise -

                                  BRUCE
                    - It s alright, Duncan. 

      Duncan takes the hint, alights from the car. 

                                  BRUCE (cont d)
                    Will this take long?  I m due at 
                    Number 10 - the reception for 
                    Putin.

                                  AIDEN
                          (tart)
                    ...That your reward, is it? 

      An evasive beat.

                                  BRUCE
                    We ll need more to win the 
                    election than winning the centre 
                    ground, it s all about the 
                    economy stupid. You ve been out 
                    of step with the PM on that for - 

                                  AIDEN
                            (overriding)
                    - This is not about the bloody 
                    economy!
                          (then)
                    How did it go, Bruce?  Resign you 
                    said - you ll help rally the big 
                    beasts in cabinet you said. I ll be 
                    in Number 10 by the recess you 
                    said..                   THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  16


                                  BRUCE 
                    He who wields the knife never wears 
                    the crown.  Heseltine learnt that 
                    lesson - 

                                  AIDEN
                    It wasn t me who wielded the damn 
                    knife! 

      He musters control -

                                  AIDEN (cont d)
                    Remind me, who was it who held your 
                    hand when Wanda walked out on your 
                    marriage?  Who had your back when 
                    your expenses thing blew up? Who 
                    held you together when you had the 
                    prostate scare last year and 
                    covered your arse in Cabinet? 
                          (a different tone)
                    Wait, that would be me.

      Bruce, a flicker of discomfort -

                                  BRUCE
                    ...It was never going to fly. Not 
                    once the P.M. put the thumb screws 
                    on everyone 

                                  AIDEN 
                    - So you just hung me out to dry?

      A depth of feeling in this - he constrains it.  Then, brutal 
      realization dawning -

                                  AIDEN (cont d)
                    ... You re eliminating the 
                      competition -- that s what this 
                    is.
                          (beat)
                    ....The office you rented for my 
                    campaign HQ, the Mobile Phones for 
                    the troops - it was all for you.  
                    Along it was for you.

      Bruce turns to meet his eyes in a glacial look - his tone 
      chillingly regretful.

                                  BRUCE
                    You take all the oxygen, Aiden. 
                    You always have. 

      Aiden, it takes a moment for him to recover - 

                                  AIDEN
                    They say the best place for an 
                    assassin to hide is in plain 
                    sight.

                          (then)
                    Or as a best friend.

      He reaches, grips Bruce s balls - twists them -

                                  AIDEN (cont d)
                    Hurts, doesn t it?

      Bruce, arched in eye watering pain - Aiden abruptly 
      releases him - alights.   Bruce watches his receding 
      figure. Duncan gets back behind the wheel. Bruce catches 
      his curious gaze in the rear view mirror -

                                  BRUCE
                          (impatient)
                    What the fuck are you waiting 
                    for!

      Duncan hits the gas -



      - The Hoynes home - the curtains shuttered - a posse of 
      REPORTERS and MEDIA outside - an army of SATELLITE VANS 
      clogging the street -  

      AN ELDERLY MAN in an upstairs window pulls aside the 
      CURTAIN - peers out -


      EVENING

      Falling light - Dita threads through the POSSE of REPORTERS 
      with a TRAY of TEA - flirtatiously laughing with them -

      Unseen by them, at a distance AN ESTATE CAR edges into view 
      - Aiden at the wheel, Freya beside him, dismay there as 
      they watch Dita -

                                  FREYA
                    Dear God, what is she doing?

                                  AIDEN
                    Snatching her fifteen seconds of 
                    fame.   
                          (then)
                    Go in, check on Noah, I ll get 
                    shot of them -

                                  FREYA
                          (firm)
                    No - 

      He glances at her -

                                  FREYA (cont d)
                    We have to be on message together 
                    on this - be seen together -

                                  AIDEN
                    And risk taking you down with me?  
                          (then)
                    ...Hasn t today cost us enough?

      She, touched by this.  She leans, kisses him, reluctantly 
      goes - he watches as she enters the DRIVE - the PRESS 
      promptly converge on her - she pushes through them - 
      grabbing Dita as she passes her - hustles her inside - 



      Aiden s car pulls into the DRIVE: he alights, to be 
      engulfed by the clamouring REPORTERS - 

      Aiden - raising a hand -

                                  AIDEN
                    A short statement only- no 
                    questions -

      MICROPHONES and CAMERAS are thrust at him -

                                  AIDEN (CONT D) (cont d)
                    ...I am hardly alone in having 
                      misgivings about the Prime 
                      Minister s leadership.  But whoever 
                    is promulgating these malicious 
                    rumours that my resignation is a 
                      leadership bid of my own is judging 
                    me by the paucity of their own 
                    moral standards. 
                          (then)
                    Surely a man can be a dissident 
                    without seeking high office?  
                    Arguably, he can be more 
                    effective challenging the 
                      prevailing doctrine than joining 
                    it. 
                          (beat)
                    That s all I have to say.

      He pushes off to the FRONT DOOR - the PRESS still 
      clamouring their questions -

      Aiden s CAR pulls up outside.  He alights, crosses to open 
      the passenger door for Noah.

                                  AIDEN
                    Have a good day -

      He reaches to tousle the BOY S hair - Noah instantly jerks 
      away - physical contact disconcerts him - Aiden knows this 
      but the gesture cuts him nonetheless.   

      He stands watching as Noah trudges off.   His gaze rests on 
      the SCHOOL SIGN -  

      - WILLOW TREE HALL -  Unlocking the potential of children 
      with Autism -

      Tendrils of mist hang over the garden like a veil of tears. 
      Aiden, now sitting on a GARDEN SEAT, smoking A CHEROOT. 

      He looks up at the violet marbled sky - the dawn streaked 
      clouds - a FULL MOON is there - it s ephemeral beauty 
      transfixes him.     

      At some future date he will have cause to reflect on this 
      moment - that such beauty could trigger an idea which would 
      lead to such carnage -



      A sleep tousled Freya emerging from the house in a ROBE.  She 
      pads up the mist laden garden towards A GARDEN SHED - a LIGHT 
      glimmers within it.

                     Off to Brussels on a trade junket, 
                    back Monday - do the handover then - 
                    Good luck.                   THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  44


                                  AIDEN
                    ...Give us time to get your ducks 
                    in a row.

      She checks her appearance in the WARDROBE MIRROR.  He crosses 
      to stand behind her, smooths out her jacket - removes some 
      fluff on her collar whether real or imaginary - 

                                  FREYA
                    When I was first pregnant with 
                    Noah, I remember thinking anything 
                    I hoped to achieve must fit round 
                    the edges. He comes first.

                                  AIDEN
                    Now it s your turn to come first.  
                    And my turn to pick up the slack 
                    for a while.

      A moment between them. She turns to go, he tugs her back.

                                  AIDEN (cont d)
                    I forgot rule number one.  

      His tone alerts her -

                                  AIDEN (cont d)
                    To stay top dog you may have to 
                    unleash the bitch in you, Freya.
                          (then)
                    Don t be afraid of that.

                                  FREYA
                          (wry)
                    And rule number two?

                                  AIDEN
                    -- Re-read rule number one.

      He kisses her neck.  She arches against him, fixed on her 
      reflection.



      Freya, BRIEF CASE in hand, being ushered into the LIMO by 
      Kenny.  Aiden, watching her.  She waves to him - the CAR 
      pulls away.

      Aiden s expression alters; this is harder than he thought.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      TREMBLING LENS of a PAP CAMERA fixed on the dishevelled 
      pyjama clad figure of Aiden gazing after the departing car - 
      SNAP! SNAP!                  THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  45



      Fingers anxiously strumming a BRIEF CASE - they belong to 
      Freya in the rear of the CAR, constraining nerves.

      Kenny glances at her in the rear mirror - empathy there.


      AREA - DAY

      The ivy clad SCHOOL - KIDS arriving with PARENTS - THE 
      TEACHER at the entrance greeting them - 

      Aiden alights from his car, opens the passenger door for 
      Noah. 

                                  AIDEN
                    Have a good one, eh?

      He reaches to tousle the boy s head.  Once again, Noah jerks 
      out of his reach - traipses off towards the SCHOOL -

      On Aiden -



      Aiden on the constituency circuit, emerging from the FIRE 
      STATION with the UNIFORMED FIRE CHIEF and STATION MANAGER - 
      smiles and hand shakes are exchanged - 



      Through a glass darkly - or the PICTURE WINDOWS of A CARE 
      HOME.  A phalanx of aged PENSIONERS sitting in stooped rows: 

      Aiden can be seen with the CARE HOME STAFF working the room, 
      greeting THE RESIDENTS -                    THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  47



      Aiden, emerging - crosses to his car - gets in - triggers the 
      ignition, the RADIO comes on.  

                                  CAR RADIO
                     Coming up, Today in Parliament  -

      He snaps the radio off:  he sits, his head resting against 
      the car window - an ache in him more than just physical.



      A canopy of TREES - fractured light. Aiden, now in RUNNING 
      GEAR gear, sprinting down a track through the woods - his 
      father JOE beside him. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Father and son emerge from the woods into the PARK - a BENCH 
      is nearby.  Joe stumbles to a breathless halt -

                                  JOE
                    Too old for this damn malarky.

      He flops to the bench, Aiden does likewise. They sit a 

                                  AIDEN
                    Freya - she s invited for a welcome 
                    drink at Number 10 tonight.

      Joe glances at him, allows a moment.

                                  JOE
                    This isn t game over for you, 
                    Aiden. Not by a long way.

                                  AIDEN
                    Sooner or later most political 
                    careers end in ignominy, don t 
                    they? Sacrificed on the alter of 
                    the party or guillotined at the 
                    ballot box by disenchanted voters. 
                    Why should I be the exception?                  THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  48


                                  JOE
                    You don t mean that.

      Aiden makes no comment which is a comment in itself. 

                                  JOE (cont d)
                    Blair never sacked Gordon Brown 
                    because it was safer having him on 
                    the inside of the tent pissing out 
                    than outside pissing in. 
                          (then)
                    He knew the damage he d wreak 
                    rampaging on the back benches, he 
                    knew the support he commanded 
                    there. 
                          (pointed)
                    As you do, Aiden.   

      Aiden s face.

                                  JOE (cont d)
                    And think of this a chance to 
                    reconnect with why you first went 
                    into politics.  ... You left Oxford 
                    and went straight into the hot 
                    house of Westminster, didn t you? 
                    You barely lived in the real world, 
                    barely experienced the reality of 
                    people s lives -

                                  AIDEN
                          (impatient)
                    Of course I bloody experience it! - 
                    I meet them in my damn surgery 
                    every-

                                  JOE
                          (blunt)
                    - Virtual reality. Not the same.

      This finds its mark. Joe hesitates before continuing -

                                  JOE (cont d)
                    I saw the same thing when you were 
                    first told about Noah s Aspergers.  
                    How you ...stepped back from him. 
                          (beat)
                    Isn t that when you let yourself 
                    get sucked into the cesspit of 
                      Westminster power politics? When it 
                    stopped being about conviction and 
                    became about control? 

      Aiden, this too hits a nerve.  Joe briefly rests his hand 
      over Aiden s -                  THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  49


                                  JOE (cont d)
                    Thus endeth the first lesson.
                          (then)
                    Best get myself home, before my 
                    damn legs seize up.

      They rise from the bench. Joe starts to set off.  Aiden 
      abruptly calls out after him -  

                                  AIDEN
                    If I did step back from him, it was 
                    because of you.

      This halts Joe -

                                  AIDEN (cont d)
                    I knew I d never touch his life as 
                    you have mine.

      Joe holds his gaze -

                                  JOE
                    Never say never.

      He jogs off - Aiden watches until he turns a corner and is 
      lost to him - 



      Dita, at a window. She s watching Aiden by the HOUSE GATES 
      stretching after his run.  Is it desire in her face - or a 
      trick of the light?

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Aiden, glazed in sweat, stretching.  He senses he is being 
      observed, looks up at the house.  

      Dita has gone.  It s like she was never there.



      Freya, approaching NUMBER TEN - a battery of REPORTERS behind 
      their cordon shout questions at her - CAMERAS FLASHING -  Is 
      your husband joining you tonight, Ms. Gardner!   What does he 
      think about your promotion, Minister?    Where do you stand 
      over the immigration ban, Minister?  

      Freya halts outside NUMBER TEN to wave and pose for their 
      CAMERAS -  This way, Minister! Over here, Minister!  - 

      She, blinking in the searchlight of the media - so this what 
      the thermal of fame feels like -



      Kenny, waiting by the MINISTERIAL CAR outside the house - 

      Aiden on the front step in PYJAMAS, Ruby beside him in her 
      NIGHTIE. Freya is heading to the car carrying her RED BOXES.  

      Aiden stands watching as the car pulls away, like someone 
      marooned on a beach when the tide has gone out.



      Aiden at the wheel, Noah beside him, working his TRANSFORMER.

                                  NOAH
                    The O s were easy - Ohau, Oakland, 
                    Oamani - and they all have 
                    airports.  Q s are okay too, like 
                    loads of them to choose from - 

                                  AIDEN
                          (gently)
                    - Didn t Mum make a rule, how you 
                    can only talk about the airport 
                    thing at home?  Nowhere else?

      The BOY, his eyes obscured his glasses -

                                  AIDEN (cont d)
                    You know why she made that rule?  
                    To free up your brain to think 
                    about other things.  

      Noah, wordlessly working his TRANSFORMER -

                                  AIDEN (cont d)
                          (persevering)
                    Because if you focus on just one 
                    thing all the time, your brain gets 
                    stuck on it. That s how it turns 
                    into an obsession...
                          (beat)
                    Shall we talk about something else?  
                    You choose, any subject you want.                  THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  52


      Noah, apparently pondering on this -  Aiden glances at him -

                                  AIDEN (cont d)
                    Anything you like, up to you.

      Suddenly Noah starts to tunelessly sing - it s the Kaiser 
      Chiefs song  RUBY,	  RUBY-  -  	  RUBY!  -

                                  NOAH
                    -- Ruby, Ruby, Ruby - do you know 
                    what you're doing to me -- Ruby, 
                    Ruby, Ruby, Ruby  

      On Aiden - the implications of this impact -



      The KIDS pushing through the gates - Aiden by the car 
      watching as Noah trudges towards the school -

      He becomes aware of the drift of giggling - a bunch of 
      MOTHERS are nudging each other.  

      He glances down, he d forgotten he s wearing his PYJAMAS 
      under his ANORAK. 



      The house in a shroud of darkness - 

                                  AIDEN (O.S.)
                    The fact he wanted to see you alone 
                    is a good sign!



      Aiden, fractiously pacing -

                                  AIDEN (INTO PHONE)
                    I ve been trying to reach her all 
                    bloody afternoon! -

      The CALL is TWO WAY with LEO in the DWP outer office -                  THE POLITICIAN'S HUSBAND PART ONE 28.03 2012  59


                                  LEO (INTO PHONE)
                    On her way to Norwich for Question 
                    Time - 

                                  AIDEN (INTO PHONE)
                    Get her to call me.. 

      He disconnects -  Leo and Danny exchange a look -



      The canopy of night - a LIT WINDOW downstairs - O.S. the 
      sound of APPLAUSE -



      The MINISTERIAL CAR gliding to a halt outside the HOUSE -
