      A PRISON GUARD, 40 S, makes his way down a hall of concrete.  
      He moves with ease... confidence.  There s more to know about 
      this man... a lot more.  But, for now, it s limited to:  An 
      intelligent face.  Handsome.  

      He punches a code into a digital keypad, tips his face to the 
      security camera.  STEEL DOORS DISENGAGE.  He walks through--


      The PRISON GUARD opens his locker, grabs a small duffel, when 
      TWO FELLOW GUARDS prepare for their shift.   

                                  FELLOW GUARD
                    Later, Pete.  You have a good one.

      The GUARD (PETE) gives a nod, quickly exits with his duffel. 


      The TWO GUARDS approach the STEEL DOORS.  One motions to the 
      SECURITY CAMERAS. 

                                  GUARD #1
                    Open up, Gene.  

      Nothing happens.  The doors don t open.  The two guards share 
      a look.  Odd.  One keys in the code.  BUZZ.  The DOORS open.   

                                  GUARD #2
                    Where is everybody?  

      There s no sign of anyone.  They approach the GUARD STATION.  
      See the control room door is ajar.  They rush in to find...

      BLOOD... EVERYWHERE.  DRIPPING, SPLATTERED, STREAKED...

      The guards are horrified as they find three, maybe more 
      PRISON GUARDS on the floor.  Dead.  Their bodies EVISCERATED.                                                                                        2.



      The GUARD (PETE) careens down a long Texas highway.  The 
      prison gates behind him.  He hears the ALARM SOUND.  Through 
      the rearview mirror, LIGHTS ERUPT as all hell breaks loose.  

      The GUARD hits the radio, finds some classic rock and settles 
      in for a long drive.  As it becomes quite clear -- this man 
      is no prison guard. 


      The morning sun streams through the windows of a small loft.  
      Minimal.  Judging from the clutter, a single man s mess.  

      From somewhere, a CELL PHONE RINGS... and RINGS.  A hand 
      reaches for it.  Finds it.  Shuts it off.  Beat.  It BUZZES 
      with a TEXT MESSAGE.  Another beat then--

      A head rises from the pillows, eyes squinting in the morning 
      light.  Meet RYAN HARDY, 40 s.  Handsome in the most damaged 
      of ways.  Tired and textured by life.  And lots of booze. 

      He pulls himself from the bed, grabs his phone, stumbles to 
      the kitchen area.  He opens the fridge and grabs a carton of 
      orange juice.  Then proceeds to pull a bottle of vodka from 
      the freezer.  He pours the vodka straight into the juice 
      carton and shakes.      

      He takes a gulp.  It brings relief.  Now, he s ready for the 
      phone.  He reads his TEXT MESSAGE:  TURN ON YOUR TV.  

      Ryan finds the remote and CLICKS on the flat screen in the 
      living room area.  He starts for the bathroom as the 
      television comes to life.  THE NEWS BLARES.   Joe Carroll 
      escaped from prison early this morning...  

      Ryan stops cold.  He turns back to the TV.  His face frozen.

      ON TV --   Five dead in prison escape.    Serial killer Joe 
      Carroll at large.   Images of HUNTSVILLE PRISON, road blocks, 
      search dogs, helicopters, a full-scale manhunt in progress.  
      An image of the Bronco, abandoned by a road.  Detectives 
      scour it for evidence. 

      CLOSE ON RYAN S FACE.  Beyond shocked.  He switches stations.  
      CNN, FOX, MSNBC -- all cover the story.                                                                                      3.


      FLASHES of information.   Prison bloodbath.    Not since 
      Bundy s escape in  77...    Sentenced for the murders at SMU 
      in  03.   Two appeals denied, no chance of clemency... 

      Ryan s CELL PHONE RINGS again.  He turns to it.  Hesitates.  
      He doesn t want to answer it but...

                                  RYAN
                    Hello?

      BEGIN MONTAGE:

      Moments from the phone call play out over the following.

      -- Bathroom shower.  Water beats down on Ryan as he leans 
      against the wall. 

                                  FRANKLIN (V.O.)
                    Hello, Ryan, it s Dale Franklin, 
                    chief director of the FBI.  It s 
                    been a while.  How are you?  

                                  RYAN (V.O.)
                    I m good, Dale, what can I do for 
                    you?  

      -- Bathroom mirror.  Ryan brushes his teeth in the mirror.  
      In the reflection, he sees the TV SCREEN.  

                                  FRANKLIN (V.O.)
                    We need your help in Texas.

      -- On television.  Past footage of Ryan being interviewed on 
      a morning news show.  Caption reads:  PROFILING EXPERT RYAN 
      HARDY.

                                  RYAN (V.O.)
                    I m not an agent anymore.  

      -- Bedroom.  Ryan dresses.  Troubled.  Conflicted. 

                                  FRANKLIN (V.O.)
                    I want you to consult.  You caught 
                    this guy once.  You re a walking 
                    textbook.  I ve got my best agents 
                    on this but you know Carroll.  Go 
                    down there, educate them, we gotta 
                    catch him fast.   

      -- Bathroom.  Dressed now, Ryan is staring at himself in the 
      mirror again.  His face is stoic.  Empty.  Out of nowhere he  
      SMASHES his fist into the mirror SHATTERING it.  His hand 
      bleeds.                                                                                       4.


                                  FRANKLIN (V.O.)
                    How s your health?  

                                  RYAN (V.O.)
                    My back s good.  I m good.

      -- Kitchen.  With band-aids on his knuckles, Ryan empties 
      several bottles of ARROWHEAD WATER into the drain.  Fills the 
      empty bottles with vodka and places them in his satchel.   

                                  FRANKLIN (V.O.)
                    So you ll do it?

      -- Ryan reaches for a book.  CLOSE ON THE BOOK.  The cover 
      reads, THE POETRY OF A MADMAN, with JOE CARROLL S FACE on the 
      front.  On the back flap, a PHOTO of the AUTHOR, EX-FBI AGENT 
      RYAN HARDY.  


      A mid-sized hospital.  

      CHYRON:  DRISCOLL MEDICAL CENTER, CORPUS CHRISTI, TEXAS

      A young resident, DR. SARAH FULLER, 28, heads down the 
      hallway.  A determined woman.  Bright and cheerful -- she s 
      exactly the doctor you want taking care of you.  She cares.   


      An ELDERLY MAN, lively, robust, watches TV in bed as Sarah 
      enters.  She grabs his chart, reads it over. 

                                  SARAH
                    Good morning, Mr. Gayton.  How s 
                    your stomach?

                                  MR. GAYTON 
                    Bleeding internally.

                                  SARAH
                    Hey, we stopped that.  I meant the 
                    meds, still nauseous?

      The man is watching COVERAGE of the PRISON ESCAPE. 

                                  MR. GAYTON
                    Damn TV s making me nauseous.  You 
                    been following this mess?  That 
                    man, who sliced up all those girls 
                    in Dallas, eight, nine years ago... 
                    escaped from prison.   

      Sarah stops cold.  Turns to the television.                                                                                      5.


                                  MR. GAYTON (CONT'D)
                    Walked right out the damn door.  

      The life drains from Sarah s face.  As an image of JOE 
      CARROLL splashes across the TV SCREEN.  Her knees go weak...

                                  MR. GAYTON (CONT D)
                    How the hell does that happen?

                                  SARAH
                    Excuse me...

      Sarah calmly exits the room.    


      Hands clutch the wall as Sarah fights to stay composed.   She 
      sees TWO SUITED MEN near the elevators, FLASHING BADGES, 
      speaking to HOSPITAL STAFF.  They point to her.  Suddenly, 
      the MEN are upon her.

                                  DETECTIVE WARREN
                    Dr. Fuller?  I m Detective Warren, 
                    Corpus Christi PD, we re here on 
                    behalf of the U.S. Marshals Office.  

      Sarah tries to hold it together... as her world comes undone. 


      Sarah slips into the back seat of an unmarked car.  A CROWD 
      forms.  CAMERAS FLASH.  She looks down, sees SEVERAL FOLDERS 
      on the seat.  POLICE REPORTS.  Marked 2004.  She opens one.  
      Crime photos, court transcripts, a PHOTO of JOE CARROLL.

      INSTANT FLASHBACK:


      A younger, more innocent Sarah is on the witness stand.  She 
      steals a look at JOE CARROLL, who sits with his lawyer at the 
      defense table.  He stares at her.  His eyes are not evil.  
      They re warm.  Full of easy charm.   

      BACK TO PRESENT -- IN THE CAR

      Sarah stares at the file... at more PHOTOS of Joe Carroll.                                                                                        6.


                                  PROSECUTOR (V.O.)
                    What happened next, Miss Fuller?  

      RETURN TO FLASHBACK -- THE COURTROOM

      The PROSECUTOR questions a timid Sarah.  

                                  PROSECUTOR
                    After the noise that took Professor 
                    Carroll s attention?

                                  SARAH
                    Someone was coming.  He turned 
                    toward the bedroom door.  That s 
                    when I reached for the knife.

      The Prosecutor picks up a large knife, bagged in evidence.   

                                  PROSECUTOR
                    Where was the knife at this point?

                                  SARAH
                    It was still inside me...

      The Prosecutor deliberately looks at Joe Carroll.  All for 
      effect.  It works.  The jury reacts.

                                  PROSECUTOR
                    What did you do then?

                                  SARAH
                    I tried to remove the knife... to 
                    pull it out but I was too weak.  

                                  PROSECUTOR
                    So what did you do?

                                  SARAH
                    I pushed it instead... deeper into 
                    my stomach and to the right.  

      There s an audible GASP from somewhere in the courtroom.   

                                  PROSECUTOR
                    Why would you do that? 

                                  SARAH
                    To puncture the splenic artery... 
                    to bleed out faster.  I wanted it 
                    to be over.

      A chilled silence.  Broken by...                                                                                      7.


      A CAR DOOR SLAMS.  BACK TO PRESENT -- Detective Lewis is 
      behind the wheel while Detective Warren rides in back with 
      Sarah.  Only seconds have passed. 

                                  DETECTIVE WARREN 
                    Is there anyone you d like us to 
                    contact?  Friend?  Family member?

      A moment.  Sarah shakes her head.  No.  There s no one.


      The elevator descends.  They continue.  

                                  MASON
                    If anyone asks, you re here 
                    strictly as a consultant and you 
                    report directly to me.  Any 
                      questions?                                                                                        8.


                                  RYAN
                    How s Sarah Fuller?  

      Mason pauses.  It takes her a second to compute.  

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    Carroll s last victim?  She s a 
                    doctor now in Corpus.  Is she safe?  

                                  MASON
                    She s under 24/7 watch.  

                                  RYAN
                    I d like to speak to her.  

                                  MASON
                    About what? 

                                  RYAN
                    I d like to know how she s doing. 

      This catches Agent Mason off guard.  She finds it odd.

                                  MASON
                    Perhaps later.  Ya know, when we re 
                    not trying to find a serial killer.

      Ryan s not sure he likes this woman.  In fact, he s sure he 
      doesn t.  The elevator doors open.  They start out.  


      The crime scene.  The US MARSHALS OFFICE, CORONERS OFFICE, 
      FORENSIC AGENTS are all there.  Sweeping for evidence, 
        documenting, re-constructing...

      Ryan walks through, taking it in.  The blood splattered 
      walls, the bodies are being bagged and removed.  

      It s a gruesome sight.  Ryan does his best to look unaffected 
      by it.  Emotionless.  He almost pulls it off until it gets 
      the best of him and he s forced to turn away.  And breathe...

      SEVERAL AGENTS have gathered around the MAIN CONSOLE watching 
        surveillance footage of the escape. 

      CLOSE ON MONITORS -- JOE CARROLL, dressed as the Prison 
      Guard, walks down the hallway.

      ON ANOTHER MONITOR -- Joe Carroll can be seen in the LOCKER 
      ROOM avoiding direct contact with the oncoming GUARDS. 

      TEXAS RANGER SCOTT TURNER, 50 s, hardened good ole boy, wears 
      a big Cowboy hat, provides the commentary.                                                                                        9.


                                    CAPTAIN TURNER
                    Dips his head, avoids the camera.  
                    Friendly wave, no direct eye 
                    contact and out the door he goes.  
                    Damn almighty. 

      Turner looks up -- sees Ryan with Mason. 

                                  MASON
                    Ryan Hardy, this is Captain Turner, 
                    TRU.

                                    CAPTAIN TURNER
                          (eyes Hardy)
                    I know Ryan.

                                  RYAN
                    Captain Turner. 

      The Captain s words are loaded.  They reveal a history.   Not 
      a particularly good one.  

                                    CAPTAIN TURNER
                          (to Mason)
                    We go way back.  I was a Deputy 
                    when he first brought Carroll in.  
                          (to Ryan)
                    You still running around being the 
                    expert on all those news shows?

                                  RYAN
                    It s a living.  

                                    CAPTAIN TURNER
                    Is it?  

      Turner s an ass.  Mason interjects. 

                                  MASON
                    Director Franklin asked Mr. Hardy 
                    to consult.  

      Mason quickly leads Ryan away. 


      Ryan stands in the 8X6 cell.  Metal cot, table, toilet...  
      bare.  If not for a row of books lined on the table, it 
      wouldn t appear lived in.  Mason stands in the doorway. 

                                  MASON
                    We swept, but everything s intact.  
                    He left it like this.                                                                                      10.


                                  RYAN
                    OCD minimalist.

                                  MASON
                    He was scheduled to be executed 
                    next month.  

                                  RYAN
                    August 4th.  

      Yes, Ryan knows the date.  He notes the books:  BYRON, KEATS, 
      SHELLEY; but most of the books are all by EDGAR ALLAN POE.   

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    Still the Romantic.  

      Ryan eyes a bad painting on the wall.  It s of a LIGHTHOUSE 
      on a barren beach.  Dark and Gothic in mood.  Then, dead 
      center on the table is a single book -- THE POETRY OF A 
      MADMAN by RYAN HARDY.  Ryan picks it up.  It s old and worn.  

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    Who let him have this? 

                                  MASON
                    Anyone could have slipped it to 
                    him. 

      Ryan flips through the pages of the book when a folded piece 
      of paper falls out.  He picks it up to find his own name 
      neatly written on it.  He looks to Mason.  What?  She gauges 
      his reaction as he unfolds it and reads.

                                  RYAN
                     Dear Ryan, I enjoyed your book. 
                    Have you ever considered a sequel?  
                    Best, Joe.  

      Ryan takes a moment, absorbs the letter.  Troubled by it.He 
      deliberates then turns to Mason.  Very matter of fact.  

                                  MASON
                    Has Carroll been in touch with you?

      Ryan doesn t like her implication.  

                                  RYAN
                    I haven t seen or talked to Carroll 
                    since his trial in  04.

                                  MASON
                    Any idea why he left that for you?                                                                                      11.


                                  RYAN
                    The obvious.  He plans to kill 
                    again and he wants us to watch it.  
                    Carroll is a psychotic narcissist 
                    whose ego must be fed. 

      Mason is disappointed with this answer.  

                                  MASON
                    Is that all you got?   

      Ryan s starting to get annoyed by this woman s attitude.  She 
      clearly has an opinion about him.  

                                  RYAN
                    Yep.  

                                  MASON
                    How much alcohol have you had to 
                    drink today?  

      Mason calls it like she sees it.  Ryan fires back. 

                                  RYAN
                    Not enough.

                                  MASON
                    I don t have time for this.  
                    Franklin seems to think you can 
                    help so start helping or fade into 
                    the background -- I ve got a job to 
                    do.   

      She s more business than bitch.  She starts out when--

                                  RYAN
                    Carroll had help.  Have you checked 
                    the visitor s log, employee files?  

                                  MASON
                    We re on it.  

                                  RYAN
                    Carroll s wife, Claire Matthews, 
                    has anyone talked to her?

                                  MASON
                    She s being questioned.  We have 
                    her under watch as well. 

      Ryan s trying.  He s off his game, but he s making an effort.                                                                                      12.



      CLAIRE MATTHEWS, 40 s, peeks through the blinds of a window.  
      Eyes the MEDIA outside.  Normally, Claire is a very 
      controlled woman.  Full of strength.  Refined.  
      Sophisticated.  But not this morning... 

      Right now, she s only pretending to be those things.  
      Anything to hide the hysteria growing inside.

      She turns back to the kitchen where POLICE OFFICERS secure 
      the house.  TECHNICIANS work on the phones, installing wire 
      taps.  On a kitchen counter, a TV blasts a NEWS UPDATE.

      CLOSE ON TV SCREEN -- 

                                  REPORTER
                    Ex-FBI agent Ryan Hardy arrived in 
                      Huntsville this morning.  Hardy was 
                    the man responsible for 
                      apprehending Carroll in  03, as 
                    detailed in his best-selling 
                    book... 

      Claire watches as ARCHIVED PHOTOS of Ryan Hardy fill the 
      screen.  DETECTIVE JOAN GARCIA, 30 s, appears behind her.

                                  DETECTIVE GARCIA
                    Sorry for the intrusion, Ms. 
                    Matthews.  I have a few questions.  

      Claire stares at the detective blankly.  

                                  DETECTIVE GARCIA (CONT D)
                    When was the last time your husband 
                    contacted you?

                                  CLAIRE
                          (corrects her)
                      Ex-husband.  Detective, I don t 
                    mean to be rude but I ll wait for 
                    the FBI to arrive.  I need to speak 
                    to Ryan Hardy.  Thank you.

      And with that Claire starts for the stairs, leaving the 
      Detective a bit flustered.                                                                                       13.



      Claire enters her bedroom -- INSTANT FLASHBACK.


      A different bedroom.  Years ago.  It s dark.  A younger 
      Claire enters.  She moves to the bed when she s GRABBED FROM 
      BEHIND by Joe Carroll.  She SCREAMS as they both LAUGH and 
      tumble to the bed.  Playful. 

      They come together.  Kissing... groping... it heats up fast, 
      growing passionate.  Joe Carroll looks into her eyes... 

                                  JOE CARROLL
                    So perfect.  You and me.  I love 
                    you, Claire. 

      Claire smiles.  Moved by this.  But something more.

                                  CLAIRE 
                    I m pregnant.

      He freezes.  Surprised.  It takes a moment to sink in but 
      then Joe Carroll grabs her and pulls her to him and they 
      kiss.

      BACK TO PRESENT

      Claire is shaken from her memory by little TEN YEAR OLD JOEY  
      MATTHEWS.  Cute and too smart for his age.  He races into the 
      room... 

                                  JOEY
                    Mom?  Mom?  

                                  CLAIRE
                    Yes, honey.

      Claire swoops him up in her arms.  

                                  JOEY 
                    What is going on?  Why can t I 
                    watch TV?

      Claire looks to the doorway where the nanny, DENISE, a sweet 
      faced girl of 24, stands.  

                                  DENISE
                    I didn t know what to say.

                                  JOEY
                    It s Dad, isn t it?                                                                                     14.


      Claire is pained by this.  She looks to Denise, at a loss 
      too.


      Small and quaint.  Sarah watches the activity around her.  
      DETECTIVES, POLICE OFFICERS swirl about, securing doors and 
      windows.  She hears a familiar voice.

                                  WILL 
                          (off camera)
                    I m her neighbor, Will Wilson.  

      Sarah races to the front door where Detective Warren blocks 
      Will s entrance.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    My boyfriend and I live next door.  
                    We re friends.

                                  SARAH
                    Will?

      Warren looks to Sarah.  Sees they know each other.  He lets 
      Will pass.  He goes to Sarah and hugs her.

                                  WILL
                    You should have called me.

      She smiles, comforted by her friend s presence.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    Billy s on his way.  We re here for 
                    you.  Whatever you need.

      She nods, holding back tears, struggling to hold it together.  


      An out-of-business Wal-Mart has been converted into a 
      temporary command center.  Crowded chaos. 

      CHYRON:  COMMAND CENTER, HUNTSVILLE, TEXAS                                                                                    15.



        A make-shift lobby.  Desks have been set up to deal with the 
      REPORTERS, CONCERNED CITIZENS, POTENTIAL WITNESSES, etc.

      An AGENT interviews a SEXY (and trampy) BRUNETTE.

                                  SEXY BRUNETTE
                    I visited Joe three times this 
                    year.  I dye my hair, I m a natural 
                    blonde.  Joe likes dark hair, most 
                    of his victims were brunettes.  

      An OFFICE WORKER -- HARRIET (elderly lady) moves through the 
      crowd fielding questions.  A WOMAN enters, nice, wholesome, 
      well put together.  Could be a soccer mom.  

                                  WOMAN 
                    I need to speak to someone about 
                    Joe Carroll?   

                                    HARRIET
                    Take a seat and fill this out.

      Harriet hands her a clipboard and pen.


      The heart of the investigation.  An enlarged map of Texas has 
      been affixed to the wall.  SEVERAL AGENTS mark it up as they 
      trace the field search.  A digital clock flashes the time 
      lapsed since Carroll s escape --  8 HRS. 24 MIN.

      Mason leads Ryan through the bullpen to a small set of desks 
      towards AGENT WESTON and AGENT RILEY, two younger agents.  
      Eager.  More brains than brawn.   

      They greet Mason and Ryan.  Weston and Ryan shake.

                                  WESTON
                    Mr. Hardy, Mike Weston, it s a 
                    pleasure, I read your book back in 
                    the academy.  Big fan.

      Riley holds up Ryan s book as they shake.

                                  RILEY
                    I m playing catch up.  I m on 
                    Chapter 3.  Glad to have you.
                          (to Mason)
                    The Rangers want a profile.  

      Mason looks at Ryan.                                                                                     16.


                                  MASON
                    You up for it? 

                                  RYAN
                    It s what I m here for. 


      In the back of the store FIELD AGENTS, DETECTIVES, UNIFORMED 
      COPS crowd around a platform where--

      ON STAGE -- VARIOUS PHOTOS of Joe Carroll are projected.  The 
      man, the convict, the killer...  Ryan stands at a podium.  
      He s a little nervous.  He takes a sip from his WATER BOTTLE,  
      clears his throat and begins--

                                  RYAN
                    Um... hello... I ll start with some 
                      background.  Before Joe Carroll 
                    joined the ranks of Bundy, Gacy, 
                    Ramirez -- he was a professor of 
                      Literature at Southern Methodist 
                      University.  Considered to be a 
                    brilliant teacher.  Friendly, 
                    handsome, charismatic.  A doting 
                    husband and a father.   

      Ryan s nerves begin to disappear.  He knows this subject and 
      his confidence takes over.   

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    Also, a budding novelist, in 2003, 
                    Carroll s first and only novel, THE 
                    GOTHIC SEA, was published. A poorly 
                    received work that critics 
                      universally panned.  It would later 
                    become a best-seller but upon it s 
                    initial printing was a critical and 
                      commercial flop.  You can imagine 
                    what this did for a man blessed 
                    with an unhealthy frontal lobe.  
                    This single event would prove to be 
                    Carroll s escalation trigger.  

      OFF TO THE SIDE -- Mason watches with Riley and Weston.   

                                  RILEY
                          (re: Ryan)
                    He s good.  

                                  MASON
                    He s drunk.  On cheap vodka.  He 
                    smells like every man in my family.                                                                                    17.


                                  RILEY
                    I thought he was disabled.  Didn t 
                    Carroll stab his spine?

                                  MASON
                    He has a slight limp, favors his 
                    right.  

                                  WESTON
                    He can t pass the physical.    

                                  MASON
                    FBI cut him loose.  He s a washed 
                    up talking head. 

                                  RILEY
                    Turner says we should watch our 
                    backs.  Apparently, the man has 
                       moments.    

      Mason and Weston eye Riley.  What the hell does that mean?

      BACK ON STAGE -- Ryan continues.

                                  RYAN
                    His lectures favored the Romantic 
                    Period.  He aspired to Thoreau, 
                    Emerson, in particular, his hero, 
                    Edgar Allan Poe.  He revered the 
                      irrationality of Romanticism.  Like 
                    Poe, Carroll believed in the 
                    insanity of art.  It must be felt. 
                    To mold and craft death is the 
                    highest spiritual experience.  
                    Which led him to brutally 
                      eviscerate 14 female students. 

      PHOTOS of CARROLL S VICTIMS are projected.  School and family 
      SNAPSHOTS.  Innocent, young faces are juxtaposed with their 
      gruesome, bloody CRIME SCENE PHOTOS.  

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    Carroll was a picquerist.   The act 
                    of stabbing, slicing the flesh 
                    aroused him.  He often cut out his 
                    victim s eyes as a nod to his 
                    favorite works of Poe, THE TELL-
                    TALE HEART and THE BLACK CAT.  Poe 
                    believed the eyes are our identity.  
                    The window into our soul.

      Ryan turns to the VICTIM S PHOTOS.  Their faces resonating 
      deeply within him.  Especially one in particular -- Sarah 
      Fuller.  Mason takes note of this.                                                                                      18.



      Mason is being briefed by Weston and Riley.  Ryan is at a 
      desk, pouring over a file.

                                  WESTON
                    Carroll had 112 visitors in the 
                    last two years.  43 in the last six 
                    months, 14 visited four times or 
                    more.  

      Ryan notices the SEXY BRUNETTE slink across the warehouse.  
      His eyes find all the WOMEN waiting to be interviewed. 

                                  RYAN
                    Are those Carroll s groupies?

                                  WESTON
                    And future Jerry Springer guests.

      Ryan watches them.  Fascinated.  Someone brings in a coffee 
      run.  Sets the tray down.  Mason casually picks up two 
      coffees.  She sets one in front of Ryan.  He stares at it.  

                                  MASON
                          (back on point)
                    We need to find out who had the 
                    most access to Carroll.  

                                  RYAN
                    Carroll was going for his third 
                    appeal. He had forgone legal aid 
                    and was representing himself.  

                                  MASON
                    We know that.  

                                  RYAN
                    And by law, he had access to a 
                    legal library.  So every Tuesday, 
                    Carroll was shackled and 
                      transported to the Newton Gresham 
                    Library where he was confined to a 
                    sealed room with one guard--

                                  MASON
                    And furnished with law books.  We 
                    know all of this, Hardy.  

                                  RYAN
                    Were they actual books or digital 
                    files accessed by a computer?                                                                                      19.


                                  WESTON
                    Digital.  Everything s archived on 
                    the library s server.  

                                  RYAN
                    So Joe Carroll had internet access? 

                                  RILEY
                    It would have been restricted.  

      As they all start to realize where Ryan is going with this--

                                  RYAN
                    Because that would stop Carroll. 

      Mason jumps on this.  Furious at the possibility.  

                                  MASON
                    We need to rip apart the library s 
                    ethernet.  Get a cyber tech in 
                    here.  And we ll need a subpoena.

                        RYANMASON*
      Screw the subpoena.  It takes  over him)**(speaking
      too long.  Call Franklin.*I can get a subpoena.  *

                                  WESTON
                    Nobody has to call anybody.  I can 
                    get into that library.  Just 
                      everybody,  Sssh... 

      Weston gets busy at his computer as they stand behind him.  
      Mason looks to Ryan.  She appears slightly impressed.   


      The lobby area.  Still a tornado of activity.  The nice WOMAN 
      from earlier sits patiently.  Just then, she gets a text on 
      her CELL PHONE.  She looks down, reads it.  

      Beat.  As she takes in what it says.  Then, she grabs her bag 
      and rises.  She moves to the center of the lobby area and 
      looks around -- at all the people that come and go.  Then, 
      quite calmly she reaches into her hand bag and withdraws an 
      ICE PICK.  Silver and shiny.  

      She lets her bag hit the floor and then begins to unbutton 
      the front of her dress.  Several PEOPLE notice instantly.  
      For others, it takes a moment.  It s a most bizarre sight.

      As the WOMAN S DRESS slips down her body.  She s completely 
      nude underneath.  But her body is marked.  Inked.  Every inch 
      of her flesh is covered in writing.                                                                                      20.


      Harriet turns around, sees her -- eyes wide.  As does 
      EVERYBODY else.  GASPS, SCREAMS... instant commotion.

      TWO UNIFORMED COPS approach.  The woman waves the PICK, 
      keeping them at a distance.  


      Ryan turns to the COMMOTION from the lobby.  SEVERAL OFFICERS 
      race by.  Ryan follows.  So does Mason.  What the hell? 


      The WOMAN is surrounded now.  An OFFICER steps forward.

                                    OFFICER
                    Ma am, you need to put that down.

      CLOSE ON THE WOMAN -- this once seemingly normal lady now 
      appears quite insane.  Her naked body a freakish sight.   

      ON RYAN as he pushes through the crowd.  He sees the WOMAN at 
      the center of all the attention.  Like a caged animal.  He 
      breaks past the OFFICER.

                                  RYAN
                    Hey, you don t wanna do this.  Why 
                    don t you give me that?  Okay?

      The woman turns to Ryan.  He starts for her.  CLOSE ON THE 
      WOMAN S EYES as they tear up.  

                                  WOMAN
                     Lord help my poor soul. 

      In a flash, the WOMAN abruptly brings the ICE PICK to her 
      face and GOUGES HER OWN EYE.  BLOOD SPEWS.   

      SCREAMS pierce the building.  As the WOMAN stumbles to her 
      knees, both hands PUSH THE ICE PICK DEEPER into her head.     

      Her body slumps to the floor, convulsing, gyrating as the 
      EMBEDDED ICE PICK protrudes from her face.  PEOPLE turn away 
      in horror. 

      CLOSE ON RYAN -- unable to register what he s just witnessed.  

                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    21.


                                        ACT TWO


      A storage room is being used as a temporary morgue.  The 
      WOMAN S BODY lies on a rolling stretcher.  The ice pick has 
      been removed.  The CORONER explains the writing on her body.  

                                    CORONER
                    She did the writing herself.  Left 
                    handed.  See?  Right to left.  With 
                    a Sharpie and a mirror. 

      Ryan and Riley inspect the woman s inked body.  Ryan reads 
      the skin on her leg.   Once upon a midnight dreary... 

                                  RILEY
                          (reading her arm)
                     The Fever called living is 
                    conquered at last... 

                                  RYAN
                    It s all Poe.  And what she said, 
                    Poe s last words.  When he was 
                    found delirious on the streets of 
                      Baltimore, he uttered... Lord, help 
                    my poor soul. 

      Mason enters with paperwork.  Looks to the dead woman. 

                                  MASON
                    We ve run her prints, so far, we ve 
                    found seven identities and four of 
                    them are wanted in three states.  
                    Two of them visited Carroll 
                      repeatedly in the last six months. 

                                  RYAN
                    Anything on her cell phone?

                                  MASON
                      Disposable.  She received one text 
                    from another disposable purchased 
                    with cash from a vendor in town one 
                    week ago.  Text:  Do it now. 

                                  RYAN
                    Carroll could easily convince an 
                      unbalanced brain to do this. 

                                  MASON
                    An exertion of power?                                                                                     22.


                                  RYAN
                    And theatrics.   A poetic way of 
                    saying,  I m in control.  

      Mason s CELL RINGS.  She answers.  

                                  MASON
                          (beat, turns to Ryan)
                    I have Sarah Fuller for you.

      This surprises Ryan.  An unexpected gesture on Mason s part.  
      He takes the phone.  Steps away.  


      Detective Warren hands his CELL to Sarah.  

      SCENE INTERCUTS:

                                  SARAH
                          (on cell)
                    Mr. Hardy?  

                                  RYAN
                          (on cell)
                    How are you, Sarah?   

      The sound of her VOICE affects him.  Mason turns away to give 
      him some space.  She knows it s personal.

                                  SARAH
                    Not good.  

                                  RYAN
                    We re going to find him.  Nothing s 
                    going to happen to you.  You re 
                    gonna be okay.  I promise.

                                  SARAH
                      I appreciate you calling.

      And she means it.  She finds his voice comforting.  There is 
      a kinship between them.  They share a painful history and 
      it s apparent.  They say their good-byes.  Ryan turns to 
      Mason -- hands her phone back. 

                                  RYAN
                    Thank you.

      Mason nods.  It s almost a  moment  but she drops it.  She 
      has more information.                                                                                      23.


                                  MASON
                    They questioned Claire Matthews.  
                    She won t speak to anyone but you. 

                                  RYAN
                    I guess I should speak to her then.

      Just then, Riley appears with news.  

                                  RILEY
                    It s confirmed.  Carroll was using 
                    the library s internet.  He was 
                      communicating with someone. 

      Off this new info--


      Sarah enters the kitchen where WILL and his boyfriend, BILLY, 
      similar in appearance, are unloading bags of Chinese take-
      out. 

                                  WILL
                    I can smell the MSG...

                                  BILLY
                    I know, I went to the one in the 
                    strip mall.  It was fast.

                                  SARAH
                    It s fine, Billy, thank you.    

                                  BILLY
                    How ya doing?

      She shrugs.  Billy tries to lighten the mood.  

                                  BILLY (CONT D)
                    So, are we just gonna ignore the 
                    hot cop candy?  Do we know if he s 
                    single? 

      He refers to DETECTIVE WARREN in the living room.  Sarah 
      can t help but smile now.  She glances at the TELEVISION.

      ON TV SCREEN -- JOE CARROLL S LIFE is being analyzed by an 
      EXPERT PSYCHOLOGIST.  

                                  PSYCHOLOGIST
                          (on TV)
                    He should have stuck to teaching. 
                    His novel was a bad imitation of 
                    his hero, Edgar Allan Poe...                                                                                    24.


      INSTANT FLASHBACK:


      A full classroom.  A younger, more innocent Sarah is a 
      student in Joe Carroll s class.  He s engaging as a 
      professor.  His passion is seductive. 

                                  JOE CARROLL
                    Poe s chief principle.  Insanity as 
                    art.  It was the Romantic Period, 
                    death was about theme, motif, mood, 
                    emotional aesthetic.  Poe equated 
                    death with...?

                                    STUDENT #1
                    He equated death with love.

                                  JOE CARROLL
                    Not love.

                                  SARAH
                    Beauty.  Poe believed art was about 
                    beauty and nothing was more 
                    beautiful than the death of a 
                    beautiful woman.  Helen, Lenore, 
                    Annabel Lee...  

      Carroll takes notice of Sarah, intrigued.

                                  JOE CARROLL
                     To bereave beauty... 

      He motions to Sarah to finish--

                                  SARAH
                      ..Is to elevate one s soul .  

      And she does beautifully.  Carroll nods, pleased. 

      BACK TO PRESENT


      Sarah is chilled by the memory.  Beat. 


      A LARGE VIDEO MONITOR is filled with digital data.  URLS and 
      IP TEMPLATES.  Weston explains to the others.                                                                                      25.


                                  WESTON
                    Carroll never visited the same web 
                    address twice which suggests he was 
                      communicating through various URLs.  

                                  RYAN
                    Who with?  

                                  WESTON
                    There s the rub.  Every time I 
                    access an IP address it mutates.   
                    It s a fairly sophisticated virus.  
                    It s gonna take a while.

                                  RYAN
                    It s a stalling tactic.

                                  MASON
                    Yes, a very good camouflage job. 

                                  RYAN
                    Where were the guards when Carroll 
                    was sitting there chatting online?  
                    Who were these idiots? 

      Riley pulls up their names on his iPad.

                                  RILEY
                    The detail changed.  Wait, he had 
                    one regular.  Jordan Raines.  

      Ryan pulls his employees files.  Scours them.  

                                  RYAN
                          (reading)
                    Jordan  Jordy  Raines, 32, 4 year 
                    employee, works death row, night 
                    shift, let s check his shifts-- 
                          (checks the schedule)
                    Last night.  Called in sick--
                          (realizing)
                    We got him.  The prison guard.  
                    Jordy.  He helped Carroll escape. 

      Riley is already running a search for him.  Calls out.

                        MASONRILEY*
      Get his home address--  it.**Got

      They fly into action.  It s Ryan who is first out the door.  
      He s clearly finding his game.                                                                                      26.



      An ungodly STENCH assaults them.  Jordy wasn t big on 
        cleanliness.  Beer bottles, discarded take-out, newspapers... 

                                  SWAT MEMBER
                    He s not here.  

      Ryan and Mason move through the living room.  Next to a 
      recliner are books.  Classic Poe.  THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF 
      USHER, THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE.  Then, more titles...

      THE NIGHT STALKER.  CLOWN KILLER.  THE STRANGER BESIDE ME.  
      Books on notorious killers; Ramirez, Gacy, Henry Lee Lucas... 

      THE POETRY OF A MADMAN by Ryan Hardy. 

      Mason has found a desktop computer.  She investigates.  Finds 
      some HOME VIDEO CLIPS.  Presses PLAY.  

      ON COMPUTER SCREEN -- Jordy, (30), a big lug.  Sweaty.  
      Imposing.  He holds a small puppy.  It keeps trying to lick 
      his face.  It tickles, causing Jordy to LAUGH. 

                                  JORDY
                    Say hi to the camera.  That s it.  
                    What s your name?  Huh?  Awwwww...

      Ryan enters the KITCHEN AREA, looks around.  Mason joins him.  
      ON THE REFRIGERATOR, flyers have been posted.  LOST: BUZZY.  
      A photo of a small poodle.  IF FOUND PLEASE CALL...                                                                                    27.


      These flyers are everywhere.  All of them LOST AND MISSING 
      PETS.  What the hell?  Turner steps in from the LAUNDRY ROOM.   

                                    CAPTAIN TURNER
                    You re gonna wanna see this.

      Turner points to the garage.  


      Mason and Ryan enter to find... Blood stained walls.  
      Carcasses everywhere.  Only they re not human.  

      Dead animals litter the floor, some hang from the ceiling.  
      Dogs, big and small... other animals too.  An array of animal 
      carnage spread out on display.  A GROTESQUELY STAGED EXHIBIT.

      Ryan buries his nose in the sleeve of his shirt, fighting 
      back nausea.  He steps toward a WORK TABLE where a large 
      canine lays.  A German Shepherd.  Its hair soiled, matted 
      with blood.  Ryan stares at the poor, lifeless animal.  

      The dog s missing an eye.  It s been removed from it s 
      socket.  Ryan leans down for a better look when...

      BLOODY JAWS SNAP FEROCIOUSLY.  STRIKING OUT.  ATTACKING.

      It shocks the life out of Ryan.  He leaps back.  The dog is 
      still alive, barely.  Its head rises, swaying.  VICIOUS 
      GROWLS mixed with PAINFUL WHIMPERS as the dog clings to its 
      last bit of life.  It s been mutilated and tortured.

                                  MASON
                    He s been practicing. 

                                  RYAN
                    He s in the acceleration process.  
                    Carroll has been teaching him how 
                    to become a serial killer.

      Off this revelation--

                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    28.


                                      ACT THREE


      The CSI Team has arrived.  They collect and record.  Ryan and 
      Mason navigate around them.  Mason is on her CELL. 

                                  MASON
                          (on cell)
                    We have an accomplice.  We re 
                    looking for two men now.  Run his 
                    prints through CODIS, see what 
                    comes up.  Call me back.

      Ryan holds up a copy of Carroll s novel THE GOTHIC SEA.

                                  RYAN
                    It s been inscribed,  Jordy, you re 
                    capable of greatness.  You just 
                    have to believe.  Joe.  

                                  MASON
                    Who is this Jordy guy? 

                                  RYAN
                    Lonely, broken man, unstable, 
                      vulnerable to kindness.  Carroll 
                      recognized his potential and 
                    seduced him. 

                                  MASON
                    He s emulating Carroll. You saw 
                    those animals.  He removed their 
                    eyes.  

                                  RYAN
                    Jordy looks to Carroll the way 
                    Carroll looks to Poe.  It s almost 
                      a god-like worship.  

                                  MASON
                    Carroll must have a lot of 
                    charisma. 

                                  RYAN
                    He was very magnetic.  When I first 
                    began to suspect him, all I had was 
                    instinct.  I had no proof.  I was 
                    having a hard time convincing 
                    anyone of my Poe theory.  I was 
                    very unpopular with the Rangers.
                    I started following Carroll 
                      everywhere.  Home.  Work.  I was 
                    waiting for him to get sloppy.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    29.

                                  RYAN (CONT'D)
                    It was how I recognized Sarah 
                    Fuller.  She was a student in his 
                    class.  I would watch him teach.  
                    He was passionate.  He knew how to 
                    inspire people.  That s a gift. 

      Mason considers this when her CELL RINGS.  She answers.  

                                  MASON
                          (relays to Ryan)
                    Jordy used an ATM 45 minutes ago in 
                    Laredo.   

                                  RYAN
                    That s a border town.

                                  MASON
                    Turner thinks he and Carroll are 
                    Mexico bound.  

                                  RYAN
                    Carroll wouldn t be stupid enough 
                    to use an ATM.

                                  MASON
                    But Jordy?  Students make mistakes.  

                                  RYAN
                    Carroll wouldn t allow it.  C mon, 
                    Claire Matthews is waiting.  

      Ryan heads out.  


      CLOSE ON A TELEVISION SCREEN

      A NEWSCAST is in progress.  A FEMALE REPORTER stands outside 
      the Huntsville Command Center doing a LIVE REMOTE.  A caption 
      underneath reads -- BREAKING NEWS.  

                                  FEMALE REPORTER
                          (on TV)
                    No official statement but sources 
                    have confirmed that a woman is dead 
                    today by her own hands--  

      CLICK.  The TV goes off.  Billy has the remote.

                                  BILLY
                    I say we watch a movie.                                                                                     30.


                                  SARAH
                    I think I m gonna lay down for a 
                    bit.  If that s okay?

                                  WILL
                    I think that s a good idea.  Billy, 
                    we should let her rest.   

      Will and Billy group hug her.  

                                  BILLY/WILL
                    We will be right next door.  Call 
                    us.  We ll come running.

      Sarah smiles up at her two friends.

                                  SARAH
                    I love you, guys.

      Will and Billy head out.


      Sarah enters her bedroom.  Goes to her closet, grabs a tee.  
      A mirror hangs just inside the door.  She pulls her scrubs 
      over her head, catching her reflection.  

      CLOSE ON HER CHEST AND STOMACH.  Deeply scarred.  

      Sarah slowly runs her fingers along the marks.  The raised 
      flesh.  The healed stab wounds.  The visual reminder... of a 
      nightmare.  

      FLASHBACK:


      JINGLING KEYS.  TWO GIRLS are laughing.   That was creepy.  
       The whole night was creepy.   The front door opens to reveal 
        college-aged SARAH with her sorority sister ANNIE (20). 

      The house is dark... quiet.  The only light comes from the 
      SECOND FLOOR, shining down the staircase.

                                  SARAH
                    It s so quiet.     

      They climb the stairs.                                                                                    31.


                                  ANNIE
                    Because everyone s in Daytona.  
                    Having fun.  Everyone but us.

                                  SARAH
                    I know it s sad.  You should write 
                    a song about it. 

                                  ANNIE
                    I hate being broke. 

      They disappear to the second floor. 


      They share a bedroom.  Annie goes straight for the bathroom.  
      CLICKS on the light.  Sarah goes for the closet.  

      IN THE BATHROOM

      Annie is brushing her teeth. 

                                  ANNIE
                    The hangover has begun.  

                                  SARAH
                          (from bedroom)
                    I told you not to drink.

                                  ANNIE
                    I m not interesting enough to not 
                    drink.  That s you--

      Annie stops.  Sees something in the mirror.  Spins around--

      IN THE BEDROOM

      Sarah is changing when--

      PFFT!  CRASH.  Followed by a MUFFLED SOUND.  Sarah stops.  
      Looks to the bathroom door.  

                                  SARAH
                    Annie?

      No answer.  And then -- THE BATHROOM LIGHTS GO OUT.  Sarah 
      starts for the bathroom.  It s completely dark inside.   

                                  SARAH (CONT D)
                    Annie?

      Silence.  It s unsettling.  Sarah pauses.  Stares at the 
      doorway.  Then, Annie steps forward from the darkness.                                                                                      32.


      GASPING... unable to speak.  She s covered in blood.  She 
      reaches out for Sarah, her eyes pleading...  Help me.

      But then, she collapses to the floor.  Sarah starts for her 
      when a FIGURE emerges from behind her.  

      IT S JOE CARROLL.  He looks at Sarah... sweetly.  Mesmerized.

      Sarah stares at him.  Frozen in horror...  

      END FLASHBACK:


      Sarah is still standing in her closet, staring... her 
      reflection stares back.  A moment as the memory settles.  

      Suddenly, a FIGURE is REFLECTED in the MIRROR.  Sarah 
      SCREAMS.  It s Detective Warren.

                                  DETECTIVE WARREN
                    Sorry.  

                                  SARAH
                    No, I m sorry.  

      Sarah tries to laugh it off.    

                                  DETECTIVE WARREN
                    Just to let you know.  There s an 
                    officer in the hall.  If you need 
                    anything.  Okay?  

      Sarah smiles, thankfully.  


      Mason introduces herself to Detective Garcia and others while 
      Ryan stands in the FOYER.  The nanny, Denise, comes down the 
      stairs.  

                                  DENISE
                    Claire will be right down.

      Off Ryan--

      FLASHBACK:                                                                                    33.



      STUDENTS are leaving.  Class is over.  A younger Ryan Hardy,   
      vibrant and healthy, approaches Professor Claire Matthews.  
      Younger.  Glowing.  He s instantly taken by her classic 
      beauty.  

                                  RYAN
                    Professor Matthews?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Yes?

                                  RYAN
                    I m Agent Ryan Hardy with the FBI.  
                    Can I speak with you?

      Ryan holds out his badge. 

      MINUTES LATER


      Claire comes down the stairs with Joey.  Claire and Ryan s 
      eyes meet.  Both smile.  It s bittersweet.     

                                  CLAIRE
                    Hello, Ryan.

                                  RYAN
                    Claire. 

      There s something between them.  A bond of sorts.  Mason 
      picks up on it.  Claire leads them into-- 


      The room is warm and inviting.  Mason introduces herself.  

                                  MASON
                    I m Agent Mason, Ms. Matthews.  I 
                      understand you wanted to speak with 
                    Mr. Hardy.  

                                  CLAIRE
                    Yes, but I need to speak to him 
                    alone please.  

                                  MASON
                    I m afraid that s not possible.  
                    I m the lead agent on the case.   

                                  CLAIRE
                    I m afraid I have to insist.

      Claire and Mason lock eyes.  A stalemate.  Finally--

                                  RYAN
                    The woman wants to speak to me.  
                    Alone.  Be polite.  Get out. 

      Ryan s tone surprises Mason.  He motions her to leave.  She s 
      pissed but refuses to cause a scene.  He closes the door 
      behind her.  Turns back to Claire.                                                                                      35.


                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    I m gonna pay for that.  

      Claire grins.  It actually breaks the ice.  It allows them a 
      moment to breathe and take each other in.  

                                  CLAIRE
                    Your limp is gone.  

                                  RYAN
                    Most of the time.   

                                  CLAIRE
                    But you re drinking too much.  

      She knows him well.  Ryan nods.  Silence.  As these two 
      damaged people exist for a moment.   

                                  RYAN
                    Have you heard from him?   

      Claire moves to her desk, opens it and withdraws an envelope.

                                  CLAIRE
                    A week ago.  This came for me.  I 
                    thought you should see it.

      She hands the envelope to Ryan.  He opens it, pulls a LETTER 
      out.  He unfolds it.  Reads it.  His face registers the 
        information.  Beat.  

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    How does he know?  

                                  RYAN
                    He doesn t.  He s guessing.  

      He folds the letter and hands it back to her.  

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    No one needs to know about this.  
                    It won t help us find him.

      Claire nods.  Ryan sees her nerves are shot.  Her tough 
      exterior is failing her.  He steps towards her, wanting to 
      comfort her somehow but... he stops himself.  


      Mason is at the patio doors, fuming.  She s on her CELL.  
      Joey can be seen with the nanny in the background.                                                                                      36.


                                  MASON
                          (on cell)
                    What do you mean there was no 
                    camera at the ATM?  Are the Rangers 
                    on the ground there yet?   

                                  JOEY (O.S.)
                    Are you trying to find my dad?  

      Mason looks down.  Sees Joey staring up at her.  She looks to 
      the nanny.  Then, truthfully--

                                  MASON
                    Yes, I am.

      Little Joey nods.   

                                  JOEY
                    You know he s a bad man.  

      Mason nods.  She knows.  


      Ryan and Claire have moved to the couch.  He s filled her in.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Joe is always teaching.  It was 
                    ingrained in him.  It makes sense 
                    he would find a student.  

                                  RYAN
                    We have two killers out there now.  
                    There s evidence that points to 
                    Mexico.  Would Joe go there? 

                                  CLAIRE
                    He would consider that beneath him 
                    somehow.  Joe has accepted who he 
                    is.  He s not looking for freedom.  

                                  RYAN
                    He wants to keep killing.   

                                  CLAIRE
                    He s quite good at it.  Which 
                    wasn t the case with his writing.  
                    Artistic transference.

      Ryan exhales.  Tired.  Frustrated.  His cracks are showing.  
      He doesn t seem to hide them with her.                                                                                      37.


                                  RYAN
                    I need to find him, Claire.  I 
                    don t know how...

      He turns to her.  A long silent stare.  

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    I m sorry I didn t call.

                                  CLAIRE
                    We both know it wouldn t have 
                    worked.  

      Another silence.  It s loaded.  Claire breaks first.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    So you re back with the FBI?

                                  RYAN
                    No.  Just for this.  They can t 
                    wait to get rid of me.  I think 
                    they re more afraid not to have me 
                    here.  In case I get lucky again--

                                  CLAIRE
                    It wasn t luck, Ryan.  You figured 
                    him out.  I was his wife, I didn t 
                    know.  You put it all together.  
                    Where he was going that night.  The 
                    sorority house.  No one but you.  

      Ryan nods, appreciates her words.  Her compassion.  If things 
      were different...  Claire feels it too but... 

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    Is the girl safe?  The last victim?

                                  RYAN
                    Sarah Fuller.  Yes.  She s under 
                      protection.  She s a doctor now.  
                    She s doing good.  She got beyond 
                    all of this.

      Beat.  As this resonates for both of them.  

                                  CLAIRE
                    I m sure that pains Joe.

                                  RYAN
                    Why?  

                                  CLAIRE
                    He fancies himself Edgar Allan Poe.  
                    That was the impetus for his novel.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    38.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                    Poe died with an unfinished 
                      manuscript.  THE LIGHTHOUSE.  Joe s 
                    novel THE GOTHIC SEA was his way of 
                    finishing what Poe started.

      This registers with Ryan-- 


      Backseat.  Mason gets in after him and they re driven away.

                                  RYAN
                    We have to get to Sarah Fuller.  
                    Carroll or his little helper Jordy 
                    is going to make a move.  

                                  MASON
                    How do you know that?  What did she 
                    tell you? 

                                  RYAN
                    Carroll wants to finish what he 
                    started.  That would be Sarah.  

                                  MASON
                    I just checked in.  She s safe.  He 
                    can t get near her... 

                                  RYAN
                    But he s going to try.  

      Off Mason--


      Detective Warren meets Ryan and Mason in the hallway.  A 
      quick shake of the hands.  They pass an OFFICER on guard.

                                  DETECTIVE WARREN
                    I m Detective Warren.  Miss Fuller 
                    went to bed about an hour ago.  
                          (points)
                    Officer Pontz works the front door--

      Warren leads them into--


      The apartment is quiet.  Warren leads them through the living 
      room.  Ryan eyes TWO OFFICERS in the kitchen.  

                                  RYAN
                    Where s Sarah?

                                  DETECTIVE WARREN
                    This way.  We have a man at her 
                    bedroom door. 

      He leads them to the hallway where...

      IN THE HALLWAY

      They see a little folding chair by Sarah s bedroom door.  But 
      no OFFICER.  Where is he?  Warren moves down the hall, 
      looking for him.  

                                  DETECTIVE WARREN (CONT D)
                    Jimmy?

      Warren checks the GUEST BATHROOM.  It s empty.  Ryan storms 
      the hall.  Mason is on his heels.  Detective Warren gets to 
      Sarah s door first -- peers in.  

      THROUGH THE DOOR S CRACK, the room is dark.  Sarah s FIGURE 
      is seen under the covers.  

                                  DETECTIVE WARREN (CONT D)
                    Dr. Fuller?  Sarah?

      No response.  He turns to Ryan.  

                                  DETECTIVE WARREN (CONT D)
                    She s sleeping.                                                                                      40.


      But that doesn t stop Ryan -- he PLOWS through the door.  


      Ryan moves to Sarah s bed.  

                                  RYAN
                    Sarah?  It s Ryan Hardy. 

      Nothing.  He gets closer.  Something s not right.  He pulls 
      the sheets back and finds--

      THE POLICEMAN.  Covered in blood... his neck slashed.  Dead.  

      Ryan EXPLODES into action.  

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    She s gone.  Get help.  

      Mason enters, checks the SLAIN COP.  Confirms he s dead.  
      WTF?  Mason calls for help.

                                  MASON
                    We need back up.  The girl is 
                    missing.

      Ryan rages at Detective Warren.  

                                  RYAN
                    Where the fuck is she?

      Ryan goes insane, searching everywhere.  The next few moments 
      are a blur as he turns the place upside down.  Warren checks 
      the closet.  Ryan checks the window.  It s bolted shut.  This 
      makes no sense. 

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    How did she get out of here?  

      More COPS arrive -- a frenzied search ensues as Ryan spins 
      out of control, searching every room of the apartment.  The 
      living room, kitchen, bathroom...

      SARAH S BEDROOM -- Ryan returns.  Frantic.  He goes to the 
      closet -- checks it again, slinging clothes, rips the rod 
      down, hits the back wall in anger.  It makes a HOLLOW SOUND.  
      He stops.  Looks closer.  Sees a crack in the corner of the 
      wall.  He TAPS on it.  It moves.  

      He turns to find Mason behind him.  Shows her what he s 
      found.  Ryan digs into the edges of the cracked lining.  The 
      entire back wall gives.  Like a secret door.  Mason pulls her 
      gun.  She turns to Warren, whispers...                                                                                    41.


                                  MASON
                    Next door, go around.

      Ryan motions to Mason.  She holds aim while Ryan pushes the 
      wall aside to REVEAL--

      ANOTHER CLOSET -- of the apartment next door.  He pushes 
      through the hanging clothes.  Mason stops him.  She s the one 
      with the gun.  She steps in front of him.  

      Ryan follows her through the closet as they enter--  


      They re in the neighboring apartment.  That of Sarah s 
      friends, Will and Billy.  Evidenced by a PHOTO of the couple 
      by the bed.  CLUNK!  A NOISE from the hallway.  

      Mason turns, gun aimed.  Pauses.  Adjusts her eyes.  But Ryan  
      doesn t miss a second.  He pushes right by her to--


      Ryan moves down the hallway and into the living room.  Mason 
      now follows.  Gun ready.  CACHUNK!  A NOISE at the front 
      door.  Mason spins towards it when -- it s KICKED OPEN by 
      Detective Warren and a POLICE OFFICER.  

      Mason leaps out of her skin.  She turns back to Ryan who has 
      discovered something in the living room.  He stands, staring 
      at the dark wall. 

                                  MASON
                    Hardy?

      He turns to her and CLICKS the light, REVEALING what he s 
      discovered.   The wall behind is streaked in blood. 

      The blood forms one single word...  Nevermore.   

                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    42.


                                        ACT FOUR


      A crime scene in progress.  Tensions are high.  Agents Riley 
      and Weston are there with Ryan and Mason -- Captain Turner is 
      there with his MEN.  

                                    CAPTAIN TURNER
                    The neighbors, Will Wilson, Billy 
                    Thomas exited in their SUV forty 
                    minutes ago. 

                                  RYAN
                    No one thought to search the 
                    vehicle? 

      Ryan is not taking any of this well.  He s about to blow.

                                    CAPTAIN TURNER
                    There was no reason to check.  She 
                    wasn t missing.  We re all a little 
                    tense, Hardy.

      Riley reads from his iPad.

                                  RILEY
                    Will Wilson teaches public school, 
                    2nd grade, Billy Thomas is a 
                    computer tech.  He runs the fraud 
                    division at TI. 

                                  WESTON
                    He would know how to activate a 
                    computer virus.   

                                  MASON
                    And fake identities.   

      Ryan sees a FRAMED PHOTO of Will and Billy as a HAPPY COUPLE.

                                  RYAN
                    I bet they re not gay either.  
                    Carroll placed them here.  To watch 
                    over her until he was ready.  She d 
                    never suspect them.                                                                                      43.


                                  RILEY
                    They ve been her neighbors for 
                    three years. 

                                  RYAN
                    They re taking her to Carroll.  So 
                    he can kill her.  He has to finish 
                    what he started and he s found 
                    people to help him do it.  On the 
                    internet for Chrissake.  It s like 
                    they re his followers.

                                    CAPTAIN TURNER
                    I m not buying two men would 
                    pretend to be gay and shack up next 
                    to a woman because some nut job 
                    told them to.

                                  RYAN
                    Look at the minds we re dealing 
                    with here.  The prison guard 
                    worships him, ice pick lady was 
                      brainwashed to kill herself, these 
                    two men have dedicated years of 
                    their lives to Carroll -- there s a 
                    fanatical obsession in play here.
                          (realizing)
                    It s a cult.  It s a goddamn cult. 

      They all consider this.  Mason is the first on board. 

                                  MASON
                    Like a Charles Manson cult.

                                  RYAN
                    They re worshipping him.  What else  
                    would it be? 

                                    CAPTAIN TURNER
                    We know Carroll s got some help out 
                    there but let s put a lid on the 
                    cult word until we... let s just 
                    not use that word.  That gets in 
                    the press and we re done for.  

      Ryan shoots Turner a look.  He s losing it.  

                                  RYAN
                          (points to wall)
                    He s going to kill her.  
                       Nevermore.   THE RAVEN.  Poe was 
                      symbolizing the finality of death.   

      Mason sees how emotional Ryan is becoming.                                                                                      44.


                                  MASON
                    We understand, Hardy.  

                                    CAPTAIN TURNER
                    Why don t you step out and take a 
                    breather?  

                                  RYAN
                          (ignores him)
                    What is your tactical on the 
                    ground?  Are you going door to 
                    door?  What do you have in the air?  

                                    CAPTAIN TURNER
                    Mason, get him out of here--

                                  RYAN
                    Have you pulled their GPS?  Why are 
                    you standing here?  Move--

      Mason goes to Ryan -- he pulls away.

                                  MASON
                    Hardy!

      Mason YELLS this.  Ryan stops.  Looks at her.  Sees the faces 
      of everyone staring at him.  He realizes he s gone too far.  
      He storms out.  Beat.  The room settles. 


      AGENTS and CSI are now sweeping the room.  Weston is there, 
      wrapping up his own investigation.  Ryan enters.

                                  WESTON
                    Both men were listed on the 
                    prison s visitor logs.  You re 
                    right.  This was all planned.  

      Ryan studies the wall of blood.  Looks to Weston.

                                  RYAN
                    Do you have files on the men? 

      Weston swipes at his iPad.  

                                  WESTON
                    I have Wells Laredo info.  And 
                    Hoffman grew up near here, Padre 
                    Isle.  He has property records.  
                    424 Beach Road. 

      Ryan looks back at the FRAMED PHOTO of the  couple.   This 
      times he sees something else.  They re standing in front of a 
      LIGHTHOUSE structure.  He looks closer.  THE LIGHTHOUSE BAR 
      &... is all he can make out.  

                                  RYAN
                    Hey, can I see that?

      Weston hands over his iPad.  Ryan searches:   424 Beach Road, 
      Padre Isle.  A moment later:  THE LIGHTHOUSE BAR & GRILL.  
      Ryan quickly ERASES his search.  Hands the pad back.  Ryan 
      takes off.  Off a curious Weston--                                                                                    48.



      Ryan steps into the restaurant.  He crosses the dining room.  
      Moonlight streams in through the windows.

      He comes upon a SERVER S STATION -- sees the kitchen doors 
      and the entrance to the TAVERN that adjoins it. 

      CREAK!  Ryan turns to the tavern entrance.  The SOUND of 
      FOOTSTEPS stepping on GLASS.  He reaches for his gun.  Old 
      instinct.  There is no gun, no holster -- there hasn t been 
      one for years.                                                                                    49.


      Ryan considers his options... and then goes for it.

                                  RYAN
                    I came alone, Carroll.  It s just 
                    me. Isn t this what you wanted?  

      Silence.  Just the SOUNDS of the night wind whipping through 
      the building.  And then--

                                  SARAH (O.S.)
                    No, oh God!  Nooooo!  

      Ryan races into--


      An old tavern.  Nautical theme.  Ryan searches through the 
      bar, it s hard to see anything -- it s too dark.  Suddenly, a 
      LIGHT FLICKERS behind him.  He turns--

      WHACK!  A WOOD PLANK CRASHES into his face.  Ryan goes flying 
      back.  He lands on his back, his nose ruptured, spewing 
      blood.  He starts to get up when--   

      WHACK!  He s hit again -- in his side.  He goes rolling.  And 
      then, he hears a VOICE from his past...

                                  JOE CARROLL
                    Hello, Ryan.      

      Ryan raises up, bloody and bleary-eyed.  Joe Carroll has a 
      LARGE FLASHLIGHT.  He shines it in Ryan s face, making it 
      impossible to see anything but blinding light.

      Ryan tries to rise but he s too hurt...

                                  RYAN
                    Where is she?  

                                  SARAH (O.S.)
                    Please... Nooooo... Noooo...

      Ryan lifts himself up, pain shooting through his body as 
      Sarah continues to CRY OUT.  Ryan s eyes fight the darkness.

                                  JOE CARROLL
                    The human eye is connected by seven 
                    muscles.  I removed each one 
                      individually.  Do you know how 
                    difficult that is to do?  

                                  RYAN
                    Sarah?  Sarah?  Where are you?                                                                                    50.


      He can still hear her SCREAMING.  But then--

      CLICK.  Sarah s VOICE is cut off.  Then, CLICK, it comes back 
      on -- her VOICE has been recorded.  Carroll holds a small 
      recorder in his hand.  

                                  JOE CARROLL
                    You know how I love my souvenirs.

      Ryan turns to him just as Carroll SHINES his FLASHLIGHT to 
      the dance floor and small bandstand where--

      SARAH FULLER S BODY has been strung up.  On full display.  
      Just for Ryan.   Bloody holes where her eyes once were.

      ON RYAN as he CRIES OUT.  From his gut.  The hurt and anger 
      erupt from him.  As he stares at her cold, lifeless body.

                                  JOE CARROLL (CONT D)
                    She lasted longer than I thought 
                    she would.  Such a fighter.

      RYAN comes at JOE CARROLL.  He s hurt and limping but lunges, 
      ramming him against the bar.  Carroll breaks away, drops to 
      his knees--

                                  JOE CARROLL (CONT D)
                    I d like to turn myself in.

      Carroll places his hands on his head.  Ryan stares at him.  
      What the fuck?  

                                  JOE CARROLL (CONT D)
                      I surrender, Ryan.  

      Ryan is blind with rage, he starts for Carroll again--

                                  MASON (O.S.)
                    Ryan.  Stop.  Ryan.

      In seconds, Mason appears, gun drawn.  Riley and Weston are 
      there too.  Weston races in and pulls Ryan off of Carroll.  

      Riley is there -- gun aimed at Joe Carroll.   

                                  JOE CARROLL
                      I surrender.  

      Weston keeps Ryan contained.  As both men lock eyes in an 
      intense stare--

                                  END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                    51.


                                        ACT FIVE


      Ryan appears, his face cleaned and bandaged.  Riley and 
      Weston see him, launching in on an update.

                                  RILEY
                    The Rangers found nothing in 
                    Laredo.

      Ryan s eyes go to the PHOTOS taped to the wall.  Jacob Wells, 
      Paul Hoffman and the prison guard, Jordy.

                                  WESTON
                    Joe Carroll had 47 dedicated 
                    websites. Over a thousand chat 
                    rooms, blogs, online forums.  He 
                    could have multiple resources.

      Ryan likes the way they re thinking.  Just then, Agent Mason 
      appears looking strained.  Something s up.  

                                  MASON
                          (to Ryan)
                    He ll only talk to you.                                                                                      53.


                                  RYAN
                    You really want to put me in a room 
                    with him? 

      Mason shrugs.  She doesn t know what to do.  

                                  MASON
                    He refuses to talk to anyone except 
                    you.  There are still three killers 
                    out there and God knows what else.  
                    We need information.  Talk to him.

      Ryan hates this...


      Ryan is escorted through several ELECTRIC DOORS.  


      A small room.  A table and two chairs.  The door opens and 
      Ryan enters -- alone.  He takes a seat opposite a very bound 
      and shackled Joe Carroll.  No one speaks at first.  Then...

                                  JOE CARROLL
                    Sarah had to die, Ryan.  She was 
                      unfinished business.  I know it s 
                    sad.  Tragic. 

      Carroll seems concerned.  He s a very polite man.  Ryan says 
      nothing, refusing to engage his emotions.  

                                  JOE CARROLL (CONT D)
                    Poor thing.  She had worked so hard 
                    to pull her life together.  It s 
                    hard to recover from such trauma.  
                    And she had done quite nicely which 
                    is more than I can say for some--

      Joe Carroll pauses for effect.  Ryan merely stares at him.  

                                  JOE CARROLL (CONT D)
                    You ve been quite a disappointment.  
                    I handed you a career and you 
                      squandered it.  I never expected 
                    you capable of IN COLD BLOOD but 
                    what was with that true crime 
                    drivel?   

                                  RYAN
                    So what s my sequel about, Joe?  
                    Everyone outside this room is 
                    anxious to know.  They re under the 
                      impression you re going to tell me.                                                                                      54.


                                  JOE CARROLL
                    Of course, I ll tell you.  We re 
                    going to write it together, Ryan.  
                    Our sophomore effort.  I ve learned 
                    a lot since my last outing.  My 
                    first book was too avant-garde.  
                      Overwrought.  Lost in literati 
                    pretense.  Even Poe whored himself 
                    out eventually.  I ve decided my 
                    new story should play to a wider 
                    audience.  

      Off Ryan as he digests this--


      Agent Mason is watching their conversation on a monitor VIA 
      VIDEO SURVEILLANCE.  Weston appears.

                                  WESTON
                    Franklin is on the phone. 

      Mason looks to him.  Now?  It s not the best timing but she 
      takes the call, stepping away from the MONITOR. 

                                  MASON
                          (on phone)
                    Mason here. 

                                  FRANKLIN (O.S.)
                          (from phone)
                    Agent Mason, it appears we have a 
                    new development.

                                  MASON
                    Yes, sir?  

                                  FRANKLIN (O.S.)
                    Three bodies were found murdered in 
                    the last six hours.  One in 
                    Seattle, one in Boston, and one in 
                    Atlanta.  

                                  MASON
                    I don t follow, sir--

                                  FRANKLIN (O.S.)
                    Their eyes were removed, Agent.  On 
                    all of the bodies.  

      As Mason s face falls--                                                                                    55.



      Ryan and Carroll continue.

                                  RYAN
                    And how do your accomplices fit 
                    into this new plot?  The prison 
                    guard, the gay neighbors.  We know 
                    about your cult.

                                  JOE CARROLL
                    I m not a fan of that word.  I like 
                    to think of them as friends.   It s 
                    important to have friends, Ryan. 

      SCENE INTERCUTS:


                                  JOE CARROLL
                    Do you have any friends, Ryan?  
                    I ll be your friend.  Even though 
                    you re fucking my wife.  

      Ryan instinctively glances to the CAMERAS that hang from the 
      corners of the room.  He covers.  

                                  RYAN
                    You re fishing.  It s desperate.  

                                  JOE CARROLL
                    Did she show you the letter?  

      Ryan refuses to confirm it.

                                  JOE CARROLL (CONT D)
                    Claire is very important, Ryan.  
                    Every good story needs a love 
                    interest.  


      Detective Garcia is wrapping things up with her men while  
      Claire watches television.

      FOOTAGE OF CARROLL being escorted back to prison.  The 
      HEADLINES read CARROLL CAUGHT.  Claire turns off the TV.

      BACK TO CARROLL AND RYAN.

                                  JOE CARROLL
                    You know she s the only woman I ve 
                    ever loved.  The mother of my son.  
                    I d like to see her. 

                                  RYAN
                    She ll never agree to that.

                                  JOE CARROLL
                    She might change her mind.                                                                                    57.



      Claire climbs the stairs, moves to Joey s bedroom.  Peeks in 
      on her son -- but he s not there.  The bed is empty.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Joey?  Joey?  

      Instant panic.  Where s Joey?  Claire looks for the nanny. 

      ON RYAN AND CARROLL.      

                                  JOE CARROLL 
                    I ve decided to go more traditional 
                    this time.  Hero.  Villain.  Good 
                    versus evil.  I need a strong 
                      protagonist so readers can truly 
                    invest.  A flawed, broken man 
                    searching for redemption.  That s 
                    you, Ryan.  You re my flawed hero.  

                                  RYAN
                    I don t think so.  

      Carroll is beginning to get under his skin. 

                                  JOE CARROLL
                    Oh, yes, I insured that by killing 
                    Sarah.  She was the inciting 
                    incident.  The hero s call to 
                    action.  This is merely the 
                    prologue, the beginning.   


      ON JORDY as the campus security guard.  He opens a small 
      black bag.  He looks to Linda who is now gagged and bound.  
      Tears streaming down her face.  He informs her--

                                  JORDY
                    It s my kit.  It s important that I 
                    have the right tools.  

                                  JOE CARROLL (V.O.)
                    That was the entire point of 
                    Sarah s death.  It was for you.  

      ON RYAN.  Hearing this kills him.  He s losing it fast.                                                                                     58.


                                  RYAN
                    When you re writing my character, 
                    make sure to include the part where  
                    I hunt down everyone associated 
                    with you -- and if this book ends 
                    with anything other than your death 
                    you better plan on a rewrite. 

                                  JOE CARROLL
                    Keep that anger.  It works for you.  

      This infuriates Ryan -- HE EXPLODES, lunging at Carroll.  He 
      throws the table aside, grabs Carroll and shoves him against 
      the wall...

      He takes Carroll s hand, pulls it up and RIPS HIS FINGERS 
      BACKWARDS -- CRACKING BONES as ALL FIVE FINGERS break at 
      once.  Carroll SCREAMS OUT in pain.  

                                  RYAN
                    I hope you re not planning on 
                    writing that book with your hands.

                                  JOE CARROLL
                    Guards!  Guards!

      Carroll is WRACKED with pain.  Ryan grabs his other hand.   

                                  RYAN
                    Now tell me something I want to 
                    hear.  

                                  JOE CARROLL
                    Somebody.  Guards.

      The first flash of fear in Joe Carroll.  

                                  RYAN
                    Start talking.  

                                  JOE CARROLL
                    Call Claire.  

      GUARDS enter the room, pull Ryan off of Carroll. 

      ON CLAIRE -- searching for her son. 

                                  CLAIRE
                    Denise?  Where s Denise?

      Detective Garcia races up the stairs.  

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    Where s my son?                                                                                    59.


      Claire is instantly frantic.  


      Denise is behind the wheel.  Little Joey is asleep in the 
      passenger s side.  

      ON CARROLL -- recomposing.

                                  JOE CARROLL
                    Call Claire.  

      ON CLAIRE, racing through the house, SCREAMING for her son.


      Carroll holds his hand in pain but appears calm and 
      unflinching -- in control. 

                                  JOE CARROLL
                    Call Claire.  Call Claire.

      But Ryan is in control now too, more focused and assured than 
      he s ever been.  

                                  RYAN
                    I will get you.  I will get you.

      Carroll is ushered out, smiling...

                                  JOE CARROLL
                    It s just beginning, Ryan.  It will 
                    be a masterpiece!  A classic.  

      Off Ryan, heated and determined.  As Carroll s words RING in 
      his ears--

                                    END OF PILOT
