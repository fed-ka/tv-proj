          2 TEENAGERS make out at a secluded area in the woods.  An
            UNIDENTIFIED POV creeps towards the car.  The MUSIC is
          tense, as the teenage GIRL suddenly notices something
          through the fogged up window.  She reaches out with her
          hand and wipes away the steam, but there's nothing there
          until... A FACE WEARING A LEATHER MASK SUDDENLY APPEARS! 
          The girl SCREAMS, as the BOY quickly sits up, just as the
          gleaming blade of a razor sharp AXE SMASHES THROUGH THE
          CAR ROOF between them.



          Johnny GRIMACES on his couch, watching a horror movie on
          TV.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Twenty bucks and they could'a got
                        a motel room.  These kids never
                        learn the value of a dollar. 

          BZZZZT!

          He glances over at his CELL PHONE BEGINS VIBRATING on the
          coffee table.



          Walt leads Johnny through the house.  He seems on edge.

                        When was the last time you talked
                        to her?

                        About 4 o'clock,  She was taking
                        JJ to his little league game. 
                        But that was over a few hours
                        ago.

                        We were supposed to hook up for
                        pizza after the game.  I've called
                        the other parents.  Everybody's
                        home.  She even left this note
                        saying she'd meet me.

          Walt offers Johnny the note.  Johnny takes it... WHOOSH!



          We're in a dark room.  A flickering TV offers the only
          light.  The SAME horror movie Johnny was just watching
          plays on the TV set.

          VISION JOHNNY takes a second to get his bearings, then
          notices what appears to be A MAN sitting quietly in a
          wooden rocking chair, his back to Johnny.  Completely
          still.  He's wearing a pressed brown suit.

          As Johnny starts towards the Man, a MUFFLED CRY draws his
            attention to his left as we SEE a half-opened bedroom
          door.  Johnny MOVES to it and steps inside...


  55DARK BEDROOM

          Johnny's heart races as he SEES SARAH, bound and gagged
          on the bed.



          Johnny flashes out of this nightmarish vision.  Walt knows
            instantly that there's something wrong.

          Parked awkwardly off the shoulder of the road.



          Walt sits across from Special Agent DAVID GRIBBINS.  Johnny
          stands against the near wall.  Gribbins studies the police

                        Because of the mask.

          Walt can hardly believe what he's hearing.  Gribbins is
          here too.

                                        GRIBBINS
                        The man who took your mother was
                        wearing a mask?

          JJ nods.

                        What did it look like?

          JJ hesitates, then points to the plastic WATER BOTTLE in
          Gribbins's hand.  Johnny grabs it out of his hand.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It was clear?  He wore a clear
                        plastic mask?

          JJ nods.  Johnny and Walt share a knowing look.

                                        WALT
                          Impossible.

                          Somebody want to tell me what's
                        going on?

          Roscoe take J.J. by the shoulders,

                        It's okay, we'll be right here.

          Roscoe leads the boy to a waiting car.

                        We had a case, about a year ago. *
                          A serial kidnapper.  He wore a
                        clear plastic mask.

                        We tracked him to an abandoned
                        industrial plant.  There was an
                        explosion.  He got caught in the
                        fire.

                        The fire was fueled by chemicals. 
                        It burned for nearly five hours.

          FADE IN:



          Walt and Johnny wait outside an exam room.  JJ is on the
          table being checked out.  A young DOCTOR steps outside. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        He wasn't hurt, was he?

                                        DOCTOR
                        There were no physical injuries,
                        but we did find traces of
                            trichloromethane in his lungs.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Chloroform?

                                        DOCTOR
                        I want to keep him for a day,
                        just to be safe.  He's a pretty
                        tough kid.  

          The doctor walks away, as Walt stares at JJ through the
          slightly opened doorway.

                                        WALT
                        I'm going to station an officer
                        outside his room.  I won't risk
                        losing him again.

          Johnny can see, maybe for the first time, just how much
          Walt truly loves this boy.

          Agent Gribbins approaches with some coffee.  Peace
            offering.

                                        GRIBBINS
                        How's the boy?

                        He doesn't remember very much.

                        Maybe now we get some cooperation
                        from you people.

                        more questions.

          Gribbins has a thick manila file in his hands.

                        This man you referred to in your
                        report as "The Collector" - what
                        can you tell me about him?

                        women, tortures them and then
                        tosses them back into the woods.

                        You said this was revenge.

                        We stopped the guy.  He got hurt
                        in the process.  I guess he got
                        pissed off and now he's back. 
                        What part of all this don't you
                          understand?

                                        GRIBBINS
                        This man appears to have eluded
                        the authorities for years.  How
                        were you able to find him so fast?

                        If you never recovered his body,
                        why did you close the case?

                        up, this guy would be dead or in
                        prison and we wouldn't be having

          Even Johnny's caught off-guard by Walt's flash of anger.

                        I think you're too involved in

          Walt roams around the debris, searching for some sort of
          clue.  Johnny notices the burnt remains of a propane tank
          and touches it, WHOOSH.

          A small, thin FLAME creeps up the wall, Johnny recoils
          his hand... WHOOSH.  The wreckage forms into a solid wall. 
            A ceiling forms above him.  Johnny spins -

            Suddenly, a big ass SHOTGUN is pointed in his face.           DEAD ZONE: "Heart of Darkness" - ACT TWO - 8/1/05 - BLUE   20.



          Observer Johnny watches as the Collector (unmasked) trains
          the shotgun at Vision Johnny.  Walt levels his side-arm
          back at The Collector.   LINDA, his SUPPOSED VICTIM, stands
            alongside The Collector.

                        let this one go.  I've seen it
                          before...

          Walt looks at Johnny and knows that he's up to something.

                                        WALT
                          Alright, everybody just relax.

          Walt slowly lowers his gun down.  Johnny sees the flames
          reach the propane tank.  Linda is about to notice it like
          she did before, then...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is it worth it, Linda?

          And instead of seeing the impending explosion, she looks
          over at Johnny.

                                        LINDA
                        You don't understand.

          In that instant, the propane tank EXPLODES.  The Collector
          takes a full frontal blast of fire.  He SCREAMS as he
          covers his face, his skin sizzles. 

          FREEZE

          The Collector is hunched over.  Holding his face.  CAMERA
          SPINS, (present day) Johnny walks into the scene.



          RESUME with Johnny as he flashes out of the Vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                        His face was badly burnt.  His
                        arm, too. 

                                        WALT
                        What happened to him?

          Johnny carefully touches the kitchen counter as, WHOOSH! 



          Johnny now stands amidst a full-blown FIRE.  Flames rise
          up the walls.  (Vision) Johnny watches himself and Walt
          bolt out of the kitchen.  Linda pulls The Collector the
          opposite direction back into the factory.

          Johnny narrates to Walt (and us) through these visions.

                                        VISION JOHNNY
                        When we took off to save the girl,
                        Linda and The Collector slipped
                        out through a side exit.  

          (Vision) Johnny follows them, watching Linda pull The
            Collector through the unexpected opening.  Fire all around
          them.

                                        LINDA
                        Don't stop!  I won't let you die! 



          Walt gets off his radio.

                                        WALT
                        There was an black '97 Ford Bronco
                          matching that partial plate
                        registered to a Landmount
                          Properties.  Probably a dummy
                          corporation.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Was there an address?

                        Post Office box.  It gets better. *
                        The vehicle was found deserted
                        nearly 10 months ago.*

                                        JOHNNY
                        Where?

                                        WALT
                        Two hours north of here.  A place
                        called Shawnee Peak.  Can you
                        believe it?  This guy's been in
                        our backyard the whole time and
                        we didn't know it. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe we should talk to Agent
                          Gribbins?

                                        WALT
                        Why?  So he can tell us to go
                        home and wait?  Let's face it,
                        end of the day Sarah's just another
                        case number to them.

          Johnny can't argue with any of his logic.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Alright, let's go find him.

          Walt cranks the engine as the patrol car tears away.



          A medium size warehouse space filled with medical equipment
          and supplies - syringes, gauze, thermometers, hazardous
          waste signs, some chemical solutions, etc.  Johnny and
          Walt speak with the owner, Mr. Chan.  He seems nervous
          and twitchy.  A teenage stock CLERK stacks boxes, behind
          him.

                                        WALT
                        Then you don't remember a woman
                        asking for medical supplies? 
                        Stuff to treat a burn?

                                        MR. CHAN
                        I told you, I'd lose my license.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe you could check your records?

                                        MR. CHAN
                        Like I said, it's...

                                        WALT
                        Against the law, yeah, we heard
                        you.

          The phone on the far wall begins to RING.

                                        TEENAGE CLERK
                        I'll get it.

                                        MR. CHAN
                                (quickly)
                        No!  I'm expecting an important
                        call.

          It's obvious he just wants them out of his shop.

                                        MR. CHAN
                        If you gentlemen excuse me, I
                        have a business to run.

          He walks off to answer the phone.  As he passes the
          clerk...

                                        MR. CHAN
                                (bitchy)

                                        MR. CHAN (CONT'D)
                        What are you, blind?

          The young man takes the abuse, as Johnny and Walt walk
          away.



          They ease silently into the dark room.  Fortunately, the
          TV is so loud that the Man doesn't seem to hear them,
          then --

          CREAK!  Johnny steps on a LOOSE FLOORBOARD!  Walt
            instinctively FAST-TRACKS towards the Man in the chair,
          his gun leveled.

                                        WALT
                        Police!  Put your hands on your
                        head!

          The man doesn't respond.

                                        WALT
                        I'm not playing with you!  Put
                        your hands on your head!  NOW!

          The man remains motionless.  Something isn't right here. 
          They move cautiously around the chair, as they see:

          THE MAN'S FACE

          Is hidden behind that now familiar looking plastic mask.

          WALT AND JOHNNY

          Walt cautiously reaches out and slips the mask up off the
          guy's face.  The expression of their faces says everything,

                                        WALT
                        Jesus Christ.

          REVEAL - THE COLLECTOR'S FACE

          It's horrifying.  The skin has been plastered together
          with glue.  He's obviously been dead for awhile. 

                                        WALT
                                (realizes)
                        Sarah.

          Walt tries the locked bedroom door.  He steps back and
          plants his boot into it, smashing it OPEN.  He rushes in,
          then after a BEAT, returns with his gun lowered.  He looks
          at Johnny and shakes his head.

                                        WALT
                        What the hell is going on?  If
                        he's dead, who took Sarah?

          The Collector's body suddenly SLUMPS forward.  Johnny
          nearly jumps out of his skin.  He gently pushes the dead
          body back against the chair.  As he touches him...



          Whoosh!  MATCH/ CUT/ MORPH.  We SPIN around Johnny and
          the Collector's dead body...

          SARAH'S lying on the bed handcuffed and gagged.  Her eyes,
          terrified.  Crying.  She looks up.  There's a DARK FIGURE
          standing over her wearing a dark, hooded raincoat.  A
          GLOVED HAND reaches down and takes the gag out of Sarah's

                                        SARAH
                        Please, I don't want to die!

          The Dark Figure steps forward into the light.

                                        SARAH
                        Who are you?  What do you want? 

          The figure pulls back the hood and slips off the mask,
            REVEALING Linda, the woman Johnny unwittingly delivered
          to The Collector in the first episode.

          She has a bizarre look of calm, but clearly disturbed

          resolve.  She takes a burnt and twisted MASK from the
          pocket of the raincoat and holds it out for Sarah to see...

                                        LINDA
                        See what they did to him?  To
                        everything I cared about?  Now
                        it's my turn.  I'll show them the
                        meaning of love. 

          Linda takes out a syringe containing a blue-ish liquid.

                                        LINDA
                        Time to sleep now.

                        No, please, you can't!

                                        LINDA
                        It won't hurt, I promise.

                                        SARAH
                                  (desperate)
                        It's not me... it's my baby! 

                                        LINDA
                                (caught off guard)
                        Baby?  

                                        SARAH
                        I just found out today.  I haven't
                        even told my husband.  I won't
                          struggle.  Just don't hurt my
                        baby.  

          A flash of genuine concern crosses Linda's face, then is
          quickly replaced by calculated determination.

                                        LINDA
                        You need to do exactly what I
                        tell you.  Understood? 

          Sarah nods.

                                        LINDA
                        Get up. 



          Johnny flashes out of the vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's Linda.  She's the one who
                        took Sarah.

          Johnny is clearly torn up by what he just saw and heard. 
          Walt can see it in his eyes.

          realizes the pain he's about to inflict on his good friend,

                          Pregnant?

          Walt's rage seems to rush out him as a new set of emotions
          rush in.  He slowly let's go of Johnny, as he turns away.

                                        JOHNNY
                        She just found out today.

          FADE IN:



          The Collector's body lies partially covered by a plastic
          sheet.

                                        WALT (O.S.)
                          I appreciate you comin' in so
                        early, Mark.

          REVEAL 

          Coroner, DR. WENTZ, briefs Walt, Johnny and Agent Gribbins.

                                        DR. WENTZ
                        It's not a problem.  You know how
                        much we all care about Sarah.

                                        GRIBBINS
                        What did you find, Doctor?

                                        DR. WENTZ
                        The body has third-degree burns
                        to the face and chest.  The right
                        arm is nearly burnt off at the
                          shoulder.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So he died from fire?

                                        DR. WENTZ
                        Infection.  It doesn't appear he
                        sought any serious medical
                        attention.  The pain must have
                        been incredible.

                                        WALT
                                (low)
                        Good.

          Johnny and Gribbins exchange a concerned look,

                                        GRIBBINS
                        How long has he been dead?

                                        DR. WENTZ
                        It's hard to tell without some
                        more extensive testing, but I'd
                        guess the better part of a year,*
                        maybe nine or ten months.  The*
                        solvent seems to have slowed the
                        rate of decomposition.

                                        DR. WENTZ (CONT'D)
                                (almost with admiration)
                        It's obvious that whoever preserved
                        the body did it with tremendous
                        care.

                                        GRIBBINS
                        Thank you, Doctor.

          Wentz sets his hand on Walt's shoulder and walks away. 
          Walt turns and catches Gribbins staring a hole through
          him.

                                        WALT
                        What?

                                        GRIBBINS
                        I could have your badge for
                          interfering with a federal
                          investigation.

                                        WALT
                        Since when is capturing a felon
                        considered interference?

          Walt starts for the door, as TWO of Gribbins's AGENTS
          blocks his way.

                                        GRIBBINS
                        Here's the deal.  You want to be
                        a part of this case, we work as a
                        team.  Otherwise, I lock your ass
                        up and you can read about it in
                        the newspaper.  That's the offer
                        and it's nonnegotiable.

          Walt realizes he's got no other choice but to go along,
          as he reluctantly nods. 

                                        GRIBBINS
                                (checks his watch)
                        The sun'll be up in two hours. 
                        I've got fifteen agents coming in
                        from Washington, they should be
                        on the ground by eight o'clock. 
                        Until then, I suggest you both go
                        home, take a shower, grab some
                        chow and try to get a couple hours
                        of sleep.  There won't be time
                        after we get started and I need
                        you to be sharp.

                                        WALT
                        Fifteen agents?

                        Best I've got.

          Agent Gribbins walks out, followed by his agents.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You heard him, fifteen of the
                        very best F.B.I. Agents.  This is
                        a good thing.

                                        WALT
                        I hope you're right.

          Walt is clearly struggling to hang on to his emotions.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Go home.  I'll pick you up at
                        eight.

          Walt grabs his jacket and walks out.  It's only after
          he's gone that we see the true look of uncertainty in
          Johnny's eyes. 



          Johnny comes in and drops his keys on the counter.  He
          reaches for a piece of fruit and catches a whiff of
          himself.  He sniffs at his shirt -- PEW! -- he definitely
          needs a shower.  As he's about to head upstairs, he notices
          the LIGHT BLINKING on his answering machine.  He hits the
          CALLER ID button...

          INSERT - PHONE MACHINE

          'SARAH'S CELL' comes up on the display screen.

          RESUME JOHNNY

          He's clearly stunned as he presses PLAY.

                                        LINDA'S VOICE (ANSWERING MACHINE)
                        If you want to know what happened
                        to Sarah, come to where she was
                        taken.  Come alone, or she dies. 
                        I'll be watching.

          CLICK!  DIAL TONE.  Johnny hesitates, then picks up the
          phone and starts dialing, then quickly hangs up.  He
          REWINDS the message tape, then hits PLAY.

                                        LINDA'S VOICE (ANSWERING MACHINE)
                        ...Come alone, or she dies.  I'll

          CLICK!  Johnny's mind races with questions and
            possibilities, as he finally grabs his keys off the counter
          and takes off.



          Johnny slides into the passenger seat, closes the door
          and TURNS ON the dome light.  He hesitates, as if he
          doesn't continue, this whole thing might go away.  Then
          hits PLAY again.

                                        LINDA (V.O. CONT'D)
                        Put the key in the ignition, but
                        do not start the engine.

          Johnny does as he's told.

                                        LINDA (V.O. CONT'D)
                        Inside the box, underneath the
                        bottom, you'll find a leather
                        case.  Take it out.

          Johnny reaches into the box and removes the cardboard
          bottom.  He lifts out a leather container about the size
          of an eyeglass case.

                                        LINDA (V.O. CONT'D)
                        Open the case and remove the
                          contents.

          Johnny carefully opens the case, REVEALING...

          A GLASS VIAL

          It contains a familiar looking blue liquid.  

                                        LINDA (V.O. CONT'D)
                        Take the cap off the vial and
                        drink the liquid.  You have thirty
                          seconds.

    40CONTINUED:40

          As Johnny decides what to do, his mind is flooded by
          FLASHES OF MEMORY (INTER-CUT EXISTING FOOTAGE OF JOHNNY'S
          LIFE WITH SARAH, BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER HIS COMA.  MAYBE
          WE CAN FIND A GREAT TAG LINE TO USE AS HIS FINAL MEMORY.)

                                        LINDA (V.O. CONT'D)
                        Time's up.  What's it going to
                        be, John?

          The recorder CLICKS OFF.

          Johnny has no choice and quickly downs the contents of
          the vial.  He hesitates, then slumps slowly forward in
          the seat unconscious.



          Johnny wakes up, groggy, he's bound and gagged.  He
            struggles against his restraints, as he rolls over and
          realizes that Sarah is lying next to him.  Johnny tries
          to reach her, but he can't move due to his restraints.

          Sarah's scared.  Also bound and gagged.  She's suddenly,
          grabbed by the ankles and dragged out, as she ghosts away.


    41A41AWHOOSH!

          Johnny realizes it was just a vision.  Sarah must have
          also been brought to this same location.

          Johnny BLACKS OUT again.



          Johnny wakes up in, now free from his binds and gag.  The
          only light is a singly, bare light bulb on the ceiling. 
          Johnny rises and checks the interior of the metal lift. 
          Johnny tries the door, as he touches it,



          Whoosh!   Vision Johnny watches as Sarah POUNDS against
          the same heavy metal door.  Frantic.  Desperate.

                                        SARAH
                        What do you want from me?!  What
                        have you done with my son?!

          LINDA'S VOICE crackles through an old INTERCOM system.  



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Heart of Darkness" - ACT THREE - 8/1/05 - BLUE   39.

                        wall.

          Sarah TURNS and finds it.  She OPENS it and lifts out a
          neatly pressed dress and a shoulder length blonde wig. 

                                        LINDA'S VOICE
                        Get dressed.  I'll be back.

                                        SARAH
                        Wait!  Please, don't go!  Where
                        am I?!  What do you want?!  

          She POUNDS her fists against the heavy metal door until
          her hand bleeds.  She slumps to the ground, clutching her
          stomach as she cries.

                                                                            MATCH CUT: 



          Johnny spins out of the vision, as he realizes Linda is
          making good on her promise to have him experience Sarah's
          nightmare.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (calling out)
                        I know you're out there!  We both
                        know it's me you want!  Just take
                        me and let Sarah go!  You hear
                        me?!

          Johnny steps back and in a moment of anger, KICKS the
          door with his boot.  

                                                                          TIME CUT TO:



          Johnny sits, his back against the far wall.  Suddenly, 
          just when he thinks it's over, we HEAR the SOUND OF
          MACHINERY, as the elevator JOLTS, then begins to DESCEND. 
          Johnny braces himself as the lift rumbles down for about
          thirty seconds, then comes to an ABRUPT STOP.  The heavy
          metal door grinds OPEN, as he steps out.



          Multiple tunnels have been sealed off, as another bare
          bulb illuminates this slightly bigger space.

    46CONTINUED:46

          There's no one around, but Johnny can't shake the feeling
          he's being watched.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Are you there?!  Why don't you
                        just tell me what you want?!

          No response.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Great, now I'm talking to myself.

          As Johnny walks forward into a small area, there's a
          central beam, as he leans his hand against it, WHOOSH!


  4747SAME AREA

          Sarah appears next to him on her knees.  She's now dressed
          in the brightly colored sun dress and wears the blonde
          wig.  Linda, wearing the raincoat and mask, holds a SHOTGUN
          on her.

          Sarah notices a broken pickax lying a few feet away from
          her, partially covered by dirt.

                        Do you know what's going to happen
                        to you?  

          Sarah looks up at Linda, directly into her eyes.

                                        SARAH
                                (fighting to control
                                her emotions)
                        My name is Sarah Bannerman.  I
                        grew up in Cleaves Mills.  I have
                          a family.

                                (becoming agitated)

                        My husband's name is Walt.  We've
                        been married more than nine years. *
                        My son is named JJ.  He's ten

                                (flares)
                        I told you to be quiet!  I know
                        what you're doing.  You're trying
                        to personalize the experience.  I
                        guess there's something to be
                        said for being married to a cop. 

                                        SARAH
                        I did everything you asked.  I
                        put on the dress.  And the hair. 
                        Can you at least tell me that my
                        son is all right?

                                        LINDA
                        He's fine.  I let him go about an
                        hour after I picked you up.

                                        SARAH
                        Thank God.  

                                        LINDA
                        God had nothing to do with it. 

                                        SARAH
                        I don't even know your name.  Can
                        you at least tell me your name? 

                                        LINDA
                        Why?

                        I just don't know what to call
                        you.

                        Linda.  That's a pretty name.  I
                        used to have a friend named...

                                        LINDA
                        That's enough.  I don't want to
                        hear anymore about you, or your
                        family or your friends. 
                          Understand?  This isn't a Goddamn
                        party!

          Sarah can see that she's touched something in this woman,
          a nerve that she might be able to exploit.  Besides, what's
          the worst thing that can happen?

                                        SARAH
                        Do you have any children, Linda? 
                        Because I have a life inside of
                        me, a life that isn't responsible
                        for any of this.

                                        LINDA
                        This isn't about you or your baby. 
                        This is about...

                                        SARAH
                        About what?  You can talk to me. 
                        I won't judge you.  I know there's
                          a decent person underneath all
                        the pain and rage...

          Linda seems moved by the moment, then her eyes change and
          she's dark again.

                                        LINDA
                                (pointed)
                        You don't know me.  You don't
                        know anything about me.  So why
                        don't you shut your mouth before
                        you find out who I really am. 

          Linda takes her right hand off the barrel of the gun to
          wipe her forehead.  When she does, Sarah seizes the moment
          and grabs the broken pickax off the ground and swings it
          hard at Linda, just missing her head, but knocking the
          gun across the space.

          They both race for the weapon, but Linda is able to get
          there just fast enough to drawn down on Sarah again.

                                        LINDA
                        That was stupid!  What is it?  Do
                        you want to die?!  Is that it?! 
                        Because I'll do it!  I swear to
                        God, I'll kill you! 

          Sarah drops to her knees in defeat, as... 



          Johnny spins out of the vision, as he HEARS something and
          TURNS, just in time to see the DOORS CLOSE and the elevator
          begin to rumble SKYWARD.  He quickly locates the dusty
          control box and desperately pushes the operating buttons
          but nothing happens.  He's now trapped deep underground
          with no way out.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

          CLOSE ON

          Johnny looks around and finds the broken pickax.  Then he
          notices something on the far wall and moves for a closer
          look.

          ON THE WALL

          "J.S." has been carved into the stone wall.  Johnny touches
          it. 

                                                                        MATCH/CUT/MORPH:



          Whoosh!  Sarah appears next to Johnny, kneeling.  She
          uses the pickax to carve Johnny's initials in the stone. 
          Her face is dirty.  Eyes puffed from crying.  She's scared
          and alone.

                                        SARAH
                        I don't know when she's coming
                        back, so I'll just go ahead take
                          a chance that you'll find this
                        and see me.

          Observer Johnny instinctively reaches out for her, but
          can't touch her. 

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny, I want you to tell Walt
                        how much I loved him.  How much
                        he meant to me and to my life. 
                        After your accident... he taught
                        me that it was all right to love
                        again.  To live again.  And I
                        will never forget that... not
                        ever.

                                  tears)
                        Tell JJ not to hate me for leaving
                        him.  Tell him to be everything
                        he is, and that I hope someday he
                        has a son that he loves as much
                        as I love him.  He'll need you
                        now more than ever.  Walt, too. 
                        Please, take care of them for me.

          Johnny kneels beside her, wanting so much for her to be
          real.  She turns to her left, and seems to actually make
          eye contact with Johnny.

                                        SARAH
                                (softer, hesitant)

                        I never stopped loving you, Johnny,
                        not for one minute.  I couldn't
                        show it, but it was always there
                        deep down inside of me.
                              (a beat)
                        I used to think about the way
                        things could have been between us
                        if... They say it's impossible to
                        love two people at once, but they
                        were wrong... they were wrong.
                                (fighting her emotions)
                        I just wanted you to know this
                        before it's too late.  Good-bye,
                        Johnny.

          Sarah's image begins to ghost away. 

                                        JOHNNY
                          Sarah... 

          And then she's gone.



          Johnny flashes out of the vision.  He's consumed by the
          power of the moment, then picks up the pickax and drives
          it hard into the wall.

            Suddenly, he HEARS the elevator machinery begin to grind
          as he realizes the elevator is coming back down.  He has
          only a few seconds to get prepared for the unknown.  He
          uses the ax to quickly break the light bulb in the main
          room and prepares to attack whoever might step out of the
          approaching lift.

          But, as the metal doors slide open, we see the car is
          empty except for another small box.  Johnny steps in and
          picks up the box, inside he finds another VOICE RECORDER. 
          He presses PLAY.

                                        LINDA'S VOICE  (RECORDER)
                          I realize how frustrated you must
                        be by now.  But I promise you
                        that our pain is almost over.

                        When we first met, you asked me
                        to be honest with you.  How can
                        you expect something you've never
                        offered yourself?  How could you
                        love someone and watch as she
                        gives herself to another man? 
                        Sarah could have been yours, but
                        you weren't strong enough to take
                        her.  Now, you and I share the
                        pain of losing our one true love. 
                        A pain that can only be healed by
                        death.

                        By the time you hear this message,
                        I'll be one step closer to mine
                        and so will you.

          The recorder CLICKS OFF.  In anger, Johnny turns and
          SMASHES the recorder against the wall.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (low)
                        You crazy bitch. 

          He collapses to his knees in the center of the elevator,

                                                  TIME DISSOLVE TO:



          Johnny is now lying on his back, mentally, emotionally
          and physically exhausted.

          He lies there for a second, then suddenly a DROP OF WATER
          hits the floor beside him.  Then another.  Johnny TURNS
          his head to take notice of the water drops, the looks
          back UP, as he FOCUSES...

          TIGHT POV - WATER DRIP

          As it seeps through a split seam in the metal ceiling of
          the elevator car.

          RESUME JOHNNY

          As he gets to his feet and takes a closer look at the
          break in the metal sheeting.  The whole elevator car is
          rusted and battered. 

          He quickly finds the pickax and a box to stand on, as he
          uses the ax to pry apart the rusty metal ceiling.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Heart of Darkness" - ACT FOUR - 8/1/05 - BLUE   46.

          He's shocked to find how easy it breaks away, as more
          water begins to pour through the ever expanding opening. 
          Finally, he breaks away enough to fit his body through,
          as high above him he can SEE DAYLIGHT.

          Johnny examines the thick metal cable running up the length
          of the shaft.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You can do this.  You have to do
                        it.

          He powers himself up through the opening and begins the
          long hard climb up the darkened shaft. 



          Walt dials his phone.

                                        WALT
                        Roscoe, it's Walt.  Have you seen
                        or heard from John?  --  No, we
                        were supposed to hook up but he
                        never called. --   No, that's
                        okay.  I'm on my way in.

          Walt hangs up and TURNS to REVEAL Linda standing silently
          behind him at the kitchen table.  It's a shocking moment. 
          She's wearing a brightly colored sun dress and a shoulder
          length wig.  She also has the shotgun pointed at him.

                                        LINDA
                        I was beginning to think we'd
                        never get an opportunity to talk.

          The phone RINGS.  Linda casually FIRES one barrel and
          BLOWS THE WALL PHONE TO SMITHEREENS!  Walt shields himself
          against the unexpected blast.

                                        LINDA
                        I still have one barrel left.

          Walt isn't sure of anything, except this woman isn't
          messing around.

                                        WALT
                        Where's Sarah?  What have you
                        done with my wife?

                                        LINDA
                        In time, Sheriff.  Everything in
                        time.



          Johnny's using the TRUCKER'S phone to try and call Walt.

                                        JOHNNY
                        C'mon, Walt, pick up the phone. 
                        Dammit.

          Johnny closes the phone.

                                        TRUCKER
                        You sure you don't want me to
                        take you to the hospital?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, but you can drop me somewhere. 
                        It's not far from here.  It might
                        save a life... maybe more than
                        one.

          As the Driver considers this strange passenger from the
          woods.



          Walt and Linda continue...

                                        WALT
                        Listen, I don't care about what
                        you've done, I just want my wife
                        back.  Tell me where she is, and
                        you can walk out of here.  I give
                        you my word.

                                        LINDA
                        That's a very generous offer. 
                        It's easy to see why Sarah was
                        drawn to you.  And why Johnny
                        Smith is so intimidated.

                                        WALT
                        What are you talking about?

                                        LINDA
                        I'm talking about destiny.  Fate. 
                        Don't tell me you haven't thought
                        about it late at night?  Johnny
                        and Sarah were lovers long before
                        she ever knew your name.  They
                        had a future planned together. 
                        She even gave birth to his son. 
                        A child you now claim as your
                        own.  But he isn't yours, is he? 
                        He'll never be yours, and you're
                          reminded of that every time you
                        look into his eyes.  I can't even
                        imagine that kind of pain.

          Walt grows angrier, as he continues to eyeball the gun
          sitting between them on the table.

                        If that's it, you can have it
                        right now.  Take me.  Just tell
                        me where Sarah is, I'll call my
                        deputy and then I'll go anywhere
                        you want.

                                        LINDA
                        You still don't get, do you?

                        I'm trying, I'm really trying.  I
                        just want to know that my wife is
                        safe.  Can you tell me that?  Can
                        you tell me that she's safe?

          Linda holds his desperate stare, then..

                                        LINDA
                        She's dead.  Sarah's dead.

          Walt's brain can't register what he just heard.

                                        WALT
                        You're lying.

                                        LINDA
                        I took her into the woods and I
                        shot her.

          Walt tries to fight the madness and emotion rushing through
          his mind.

                                        LINDA
                        She begged for her life.  She
                        told me all about you and her
                        son.  She even told me about her
                        baby.

          Walt wants to rip her head off, as his eyes fill with
          tears of rage.

                                        WALT
                        She can't be dead.  She can't be.

                        She told me much you meant to her
                        and how long you'd both waited
                        for the time when you could have
                        a child of your own.

                        Then she got down on her knees
                        and begged me to spare her life. 
                        She cried and she pleaded and
                        then I shot her.

                        I put the gun to her head...

                        now!

          Then Linda does the unthinkable and FIRES the remaining
          barrel of the shot gun into the ceiling!  Walt is stunned
          by the moment, then...

          He quickly draws the back-up pistol from his ankle holster
          and levels it on her.  His mind races out of control,
          like his own internal battle between what's right and
          what's wrong.

                                        WALT

                                        WALT
                                (grimaces, his hands
                                tight on the gun)
                        SHUT UP!  YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH
                        RIGHT NOW!

          Walt takes a few very determined steps toward her as if
          he's going to shoot her point blank, then hesitates, with
          the gun aimed straight at her head.  We're not completely
          sure which way it's going to go, then...

                                        WALT

                        silent.

                          Anything you say can and will be
                        used against you in a court of
                        law.

                        This isn't the way it's supposed
                        to be!

                        You have the right to an attorney.

                        You can't do this!

          She LUNGES for Walt's gun, as Johnny quickly GRABS her
          from behind.  Roscoe and Agent Gribbins suddenly rush in
          with several other AGENTS and take control of her, as
          Johnny reacts to something.

                                        JOHNNY
                        My God.

                                        WALT
                        What?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Come with me!

          Johnny takes off towards the front door,

                                        WALT
                        Cuff this piece'a garbage.

          Walt and Gribbins take off after Johnny, as Roscoe
            handcuffs Linda.



          Walt and Johnny rush inside the camper and begin searching
          it.  Finally, Johnny realizes there's a crawl space
          underneath the cushioned bench seat.  He throws back the
            cushions, but finds the wood cover has been nailed shut.

                        Pull from the ends!

          Walt, Johnny and Gribbins all use their collective strength
          to rip the wood cover off the space.  INSIDE they find a
          rolled up carpet.  They lift out the carpet and unwrap it
          to FIND SARAH.  It's impossible to tell if she's dead or
          alive.  Walt checks her pulse.

                                        WALT
                        She's alive.  We need an ambulance.

                                        GRIBBINS
                        There's no time.  I'll get my
                        car.

          Gribbins takes off, as Walt holds Sarah's limp body and
          Johnny watches.

                                        WALT
                        Hang on, baby, just hang on.

          Johnny's about to get up, as Walt reaches out with his
          free hand and grabs Johnny's arm.

                                        WALT
                        Thank you.

          It's a powerful gesture of friendship and respect.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:



          Walt, JJ and Johnny wait in the corridor, as the DOCTOR
          steps out of Sarah's room.

                                        JJ
                        Can I see her now?

                                        DOCTOR
                        I think she'd like that.

          JJ looks up at Walt, who nods.  The kids hurries into the
          room, leaving Walt and Johnny with the Doctor.

                                        WALT
                        Is she okay?

                                        DOCTOR
                        She's dehydrated, so we hooked up
                        an I.V.

                        What about the baby?

                                        DOCTOR

                        I did an ultra-sound and everything
                        looks fine.  Congratulations.

          The doctor walks away.

                                        WALT
                        Did you hear him?  He said the
                        baby's okay.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I heard.

                        My God, I'm going to be a father. 
                        Can you believe it?  We're gonna
                        have a baby.  I should have gotten
                        flowers or candy or something.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can think of something Sarah
                          probably wants more that flowers
                        right now.

                                        WALT
                        What?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You.  Go see your wife.

                                        WALT
                        Right.  
                                (big grin)
                          I should go see my wife.

          Walt start in to the room, the STOPS and TURNS...

                                        WALT
                        Listen, John, about what you said
                        about JJ... I want you to know
                        that I never... I mean, I didn't
                        try to replace...

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's okay.

          Walt hesitates, then offers Johnny his hand.  Johnny shakes
          his hand, as they look each other straight in the eyes.

                        I'll never forget what you did,
                        John.  What you stopped me from
                        doing.

          Walt hesitates, then steps quickly into Sarah's room as
          Johnny watches through the open doorway.

          ON SARAH

          With JJ sitting beside her on the far side, Walt sits
          down on the near side of the bed and hugs her.  There's
          laughter and love and everything that goes with being
          part of a family.

          As Sarah hugs Walt, her eyes meet Johnny's.

          EYE TO EYE

          All those unspoken feelings and unrealized moments passing
          between them.  Also, everything Sarah said in her moment
          of despair.

          ON SARAH

          She breaks Walt's hug and wipes her eyes.  Then she casts
          another glance towards the door, but Johnny's already
          gone.

          Johnny walks away alone.  Maybe more alone than he's ever
          felt in his life.  As he turns the corner, we...
