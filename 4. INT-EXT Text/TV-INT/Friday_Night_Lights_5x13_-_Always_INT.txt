                    And she could be yours.  There s 
                    only one roadblock.  One 
                    impenetrable roadblock.  He is

                    will never be with no one.  Luke 
                    will marry you.  Do I have to say 
                    this again?

                                  BECKY
                    No, ma am.

                                  MINDY
                    Good.

                                  BECKY
                    So, listen, I ve been meaning to 
                    tell you, I got some good news.  

                                  MINDY
                    What s that?

                                  BECKY
                    I heard from my Mom!  She s coming 
                    home this week!

      Becky is trying to sound happy about this.  Mindy is trying 
    to not show how stunned she is.

                                  MINDY
                    She is?

                                  BECKY
                    So I ll me moving back in with her.

                                  MINDY
                    That s great, Becky.  

      Mindy is hurt that Becky dropped this so lightly.  She turns 
      cold.

      Mindy leaves, a bit huffy.  OFF Becky--


      Saracen sits across from Taylor.  

                                  SARACEN
                    Julie and I have known each other a 
                    long time now.  

                                  TAYLOR 
                    Yeah, I know.

      Matt wipes a bead of sweat from his forehead.

                                  SARACEN
                    And I want to assure you that

                    I know you knew me as a kid... I m 
                    not saying I m old or anything, but 
                    I m mature.  For my age.  

      Saracen pauses for Coach to acknowledge what he just said.  
      Taylor just stares at him.

                                  SARACEN (CONT D)
                    I want to marry your daughter, sir.

    You could hear a pin drop.  

                                  SARACEN (CONT D)
                    I love her.  I will take care of 
                    her.  Always.  And I want to ask 
                    for your permission to ask her to--

                    Julie is eighteen.  Eighteen.

                    First off, did you not see the news 
                    vans outside?  This is the week of 
                    State - do you think this is 
                    something I want to be thinking 
                    about this week?  Second, the 
                    answer is no.

                                  SARACEN
                    Well, Coach...  We don't actually 
                    need your permission.  Asking you 
                    was really just a courtesy.  I've 
                    already asked her, and she's 
                    already said yes.

      Taylor looks at him, takes in this new bit on info, he s 
      chewing his lips a mile a minute.

                                  TAYLOR
                    Son.  I am telling you what she s 
                    saying.  And she s saying no. 


      Taylor rips through the door and Tami is right on him ready 
    to pick up the argument where they left it off.

                                  TAMI
                    And by the way I ve been thinking

    it down, and thus begins the "dinnervention."

      Taylor comes out, still half asleep, finds Tami sitting, 
      thoughtful.  She s been there for a long time.  It s one of

                    I know you think I m young and you 
                    have this fear that I ll drop out 
                    of college and mess up my future or 
                    that I haven t met Mr. Right yet -- 
                    which is ironic, since you guys met 
                    in high school -- but he is Mr. 
                    Right, I will never sell myself 
                    short and I love him.  And I know.  
                    I know.  So I m going to do this.  
                    And I really want you guys on my 
                    side.  Please trust me.

                    not something too many fathers get 
                    to see and you should not miss it.

        Braemorestationery, we see that Tami has inked a bunch of 
      DOODLES on the page.   Dean Tami Taylor.    Tami Taylor,

      Thinks.  The simplicity of it all.  It gets to him.  How much 
    of a dream this is for her.  How much this opportunity means 
    to his wife.  This opportunity that he is standing in the way 
    of.  We are close with Eric.  Buddy keeps talking.

                    on State.  

      Taylor looks up from the scribbling.  Sees his wife walking 
      into the kitchen, having no idea the intense life moment 
      Taylor is experiencing right now.

                    Sound like a plan, Coach?

    The Lions in jackets and ties are packed and ready to go to 
      State.  They are all on top of the world.  Taylor stands at 
    his door, taking it all in, his mind still racing.  Vince

                    I love you.  

    He kisses her.  Jess doesn t have the heart to tell him that 
    she is moving away.  And the timing is wrong before the game.

                                  JESS

      Julie looks at the dress and looks at Matt who just smiles at 
      Julie s discomfort.

                                  MRS. SARACEN (CONT D)
                    Isn t that the most beautiful dress 
                    you ever did see?

                                  JULIE
                    It is.

                                  SARACEN
                    Grandma, Julie might want a new 
                    dress.

                                  MRS. SARACEN
                    Nonsense.  Of course it s gonna 
                    need a good washing.  Let me look 
                    at that ring on you.

      Julie shows it to her.  Grandma Saracen takes Julie s young 
      hand in both of hers and kisses her hand with the ring on it.  
    She loses it a little.

                                  JULIE
                    I love it, Mrs. Saracen.

                                  MRS. SARACEN
                    You listen to me.  You call me 
                    Grandma.  We re family now.  Now 
                    hold on let me go find the shoes 
                    and the vail.

      Grandma Saracen exits looking for more wedding stuff and Matt 
      looks at her.  Julie looks thoughtful.

                                  SARACEN
                    What?

                                  JULIE
                    What if they re right?  My Mom and 
                    Dad.  We re so young.  And we re 
                    living in two different cities.  
                    And do we know?  How do we really 
                    know this is a good idea?  That 
                    it s right?

                                  SARACEN
                    Julie.  Shut up.  It s a good idea.  
                    It s a great idea.  This is the 
                    most right thing I ve ever done.  
                    We re going to be great together. FNL 426/513 "Always"         YELLOW       07/15/1042.



      Coach Taylor sits alone in his office, thoughtful.  

                                  JESS
                    Coach.  I m leaving.  My dad is 
                    starting up a business in Dallas so 
                    I m heading over there so I won t 
                    be with you next year at Superteam.

                                  TAYLOR
                    You will be missed.

                                  JESS
                    Thank you.

                                  TAYLOR
                    I mean that.

                                  JESS
                    Coach, I can t tell you how much 
                    this season has meant to me.  You 
                    changed my life.  You should know 
                    that.

      Taylor just listens, takes it in.

                                  JESS (CONT D)
                    By the way, I didn t tell anyone 
                    about Dallas.  Vince.  No one.  I m 
                    gonnawait til after State.

      Taylor understands this better than she could know.

                                  TAYLOR
                    I think that s wise.

    She starts to leave.

                    for you.

      Gracie sits on the Santa s lap asking him for stuff.  Nothing 
    in the world could be cuter, except maybe for Tami with her 
      camera taking an endless array of pictures.  

                                  TAMI
                    Your father is going to love this.

                    Daddy!

      Tami turns and to her surprise there s Taylor, dressed to 
      leave for State.

                                  TAMI
                    What are you doing here?  You have 
                    to leave for State.

      Taylor takes a long, longbeat.  Considers.  Tami looks at 
      him.

                                  TAYLOR
                    Let s go to Philadelphia.

      Tami slowly takes in what he s saying. 

                                  TAMI
                    What...?  Whatare you talking 
                    about?

                                  TAYLOR
                    It s your turn.

      Tami is flooded with emotion.  OFF this...

                                                                        BLACK OUT:

      Pre-game rituals.  Luke sits on a bench, his knee tapping 
      nervously.  Getting his mind right.

      Tinker has headphones on, bouncing on his toes, eyes closed, 
      getting loose and ready.  A look of steely determination.

      Buddy Jr. standson his crutches, transfixed by worn photos 
    of games and players from bygone eras that hang on the walls.  
      Hastings watches his friend.  Ties his cleats tighter.

      Vince sits on a training table, watching Jess as she wraps 
    the last of some tape around his ankles.  Unspoken bond.  
      Taylor approaches.

                                  TAYLOR
                    You good?

                                  VINCE
                    Yes, sir.

                    No matter what happens tonight.  I 
                    am proud of you, son.  

      Something about the way he says this, Vince senses something 
    is different about Coach, but he doesn t know what.

                                  VINCE
                    You changed my life, Coach.

    The simple truth.  Nothing more needs to be said.

      Find our coaches - Stan, Billy, Spivey, Crowley.  Gathering 
    up the team. 

      Taylor walks in, and all heads turn.  This is it.  He eyes 
    his troops for a moment.  Adjusts his cap.  Then:

                                  TAYLOR
                    Alright.  Bring it in.

    The team assembles on a knee.  Everyone holds hands, and bows 
      their heads.  Taylor takes a beat, and begins:

                                  TAYLOR (CONT D)
                    Dear Heavenly father, keep us and 
                    protect us tonight...

    As Taylor continues with the prayer, MUSIC BEGINS, launching 
    us into the last football game we will ever see on Friday 
      Night Lights.  It s a poem.  Images, music, atmosphere.  An 
    ode to everything great about the game we love, as we go:


      Matt and Julie are heading out of their apartment.  Matt to 
    go to work, Julie reaches for her college textbook and we see 
    the engagement ring on her finger.  They bicker lovingly 
      echoing Eric and Tami s relationship.  As they make their way 
    out for the day...

                    All of your hopeful eyes shining 
                    out from underneath your helmets.
