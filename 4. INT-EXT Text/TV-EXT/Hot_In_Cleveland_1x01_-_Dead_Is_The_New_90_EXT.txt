                He lied to me and cheated on his wife 

                and he s still the nicest man I ve met 

                in years.

                Imagine what the men are like here who 

                don t screw around on their wives?  

                                        MELANIE

                I should have listened to you guys.  

                You were right.

                                        VICTORIA

                You were right, too.  I was jealous.

                So was I.  But in our defense, there s 

                nothing more obnoxious than when your

                when you re my age and you ve never 

                been in love yourself.  Do you think 

                I ll ever get married?

                You guys are sweet.  In an unsettling 

                way.  I don t know.  At a certain age you 

                can t keep blaming the men.  Or work.  

                Maybe I need to look at myself. A little.

                Oh, God, I don t want to audition for 

                  grandmother parts.  I loved being the 

                queen of daytime.

                I loved being the eyebrow queen.  

                Well, if I ve lost Oprah at least I

                Angelou anymore.

                Change is scary.  People say getting 

                older makes you wiser, but I think it 

                just makes you more cautious, which 

                looks like wisdom, but it s really just 

                fear.  Doing something fearless.

                                          ELKA

                It s simple.  In your twenties you 

                dress for men.  In your forties you 

                dress for success.  In your eighties 

                you dress for the bathroom.  (THEN) So

                                          ELKA

                When I was your age we didn t get into 

                that kind of trouble.  We went gray 

                and went away.  My husband was the 

                only man I ever dated.

                                        VICTORIA

                Didn t you ever want to try another 

                one out?  I mean, just to compare.

  ELKA CONSIDERS THIS.

                                          ELKA

                Well, that s a sinful thought...

                                          JOY
