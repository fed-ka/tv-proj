      RANDALLand HANNAH are standing in a quad with lumps of *
      ugly public art, drinking canteen tea in polystyrene cups.  

      Patients and staff are smoking nearby. 

                                  RANDALL*
                    It s strange seeing you in that 
                    white coat. (BEAT) You look so 
                    like your mother.  

      Which is not what HANNAH needed to hear right now.  

                                  RANDALL*
                    I remember when we first 
                    qualified. We thought anything 
                    was possible, that we could save 
                    anyone.But when it came to your *
                    mother,we might as well have *
                    been in the Dark Ages. 

                                  HANNAH
                    I m just glad you were there for 
                    her.  

      HANNAH looks towards the smokers.

    And there stands DIANAamongst them.  

      HANNAH shuts her eyes.  

      RANDALLnotices her grief. *

                                  RANDALL*
                    If there's anything I can do to *
                    make this easier...*

      HANNAH opens her eyes. Her mother has gone. 

                                  HANNAH
                    I m not expecting special 
                    treatment.                                                                                    17.


                                  RANDALL*
                    You won t need it. I m delighted to 
                    have you on my Firm. You'll do your 
                    mother proud.

      That puts even more pressure on HANNAH.  She wants to rise 
    to the challenge. But can she?

                                                                          CUT TO:


      Night establisher.*



      HANNAH heads out, frustrated with herself, and wanders off 
    to think in the early light.  

      Maybe to make a big decision.  

                                                                          CUT TO:
