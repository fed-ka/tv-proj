    D Anna is still out of sight from most PASSERSBY as she 
    watches another TENT across the way.  This tent has a 
    distinctive ENTRANCE, with hand-lettered INSCRIPTIONS around 
  the crude wooden DOOR set into a frame.  Small OFFERINGS have 
  been laid alongside the tent itself.  D Anna waits, 
    watches... 

    Finally DUCK EXITS the tent, closes the door behind him.  He 
  seems troubled.  He presses his fingers to his lips and then 
  onto a SYMBOL written on the DOOR before walking away.

    D Anna looks around furtively for a beat, then hurries across 
  the way, and quickly ENTERS the tent.    'Occupation' - FULL COLLATED 5/11/06 4.




  Tyrol and Anders finish their work, just as they HEAR the 
  sound of TURBINES.

                                ANDERS
                  They re inbound -- let s go!

  The two men scurry away as we see a CYLON HEAVY RAIDER appear 
  on the horizon.


    Anders and Tyrol are watching from a safe distance as the 
  Heavy Raider goes into a HOVER, then begins to gently set 
  down right where they planted their explosives.  Tyrol has a 
  crude REMOTE CONTROL.

  He frantically fiddles with the control...


    Outside the heavy blast walls surrounding the detention 
    center, Ellen stands and waits along with a small crowd of 
    others hoping for the release of their loved ones.  Suddenly 
  Tigh comes limping out of the gates and she runs to him, 
    throws her arms around him in tearful joy.

  Ellen keeps her face down, on Tigh's shoulder -- she doesn't 
  want him to know what she did to get him out.


    Anders watches in frustration as the Heavy Raider sets down 
  and begins to disgorge CENTURIONS, SHARONS, SIXES and DORALS.

    Suddenly the EXPLOSIVES DETONATE -- the humanoid Cylons are 
  blown AWAY and the Raider itself is heavily DAMAGED.  Anders 
  and Tyrol exchange an exultant grin, then RUN like hell outta 
  here as the STORAGE CONTAINERS begin to BURN and EXPLODE.


  Tigh and Ellen react to the explosion -- see a CLOUD of SMOKE 
    rising over the city.

    D Anna walks along one of the deserted roads of the city, 
  lost in thought.  She turns a corner, glances up at the 
    towering mass of COLONIAL ONE looming over this section of 
  town, then keeps going.  CAMERA MOVES to Colonial One...


    D Anna stands outside the large HOSPITAL TENT, watching the 
    shadows of the people within as they move about.  There are 
    MUFFLED SOUNDS OF VOICES, and the CLANG of MEDICAL 
    INSTRUMENTS IN PANS.  A WHINING SOUND from o.c. makes D Anna 
  turn to see --

  AN OLD DOG

  Tied up to a pole across the way from the Hospital Tent.  The 
  dog -- Jake -- is wagging his tail at her, but he s too old 
  and scruffy to get up from where he s lying.  His yellow DOG 
  BOWL sits empty to one side.  She smiles at him.

                                D ANNA
                  Hey, Jake.  What -- think I have a 
                  treat for you?  Well... you re 
                  right. 

  She walks over, fishes something out of a pocket and gives it 
  to the dog, who gobbles it quickly.

  tent flap, smoking a cigarette.

                  just following orders.

  She doesn t believe him, lets the silence speak for itself.  
    D Anna moves close to him, looks down at the blood on 
    Cottle s smock.

                                D ANNA
                  Funny thing.  All looks the same,

    Cottle doesn t respond, goes back inside the tent, leaving 
    D Anna alone feeling the chill of the cold night air.  

  She heads off.  Then, just after she s gone, an o.c. PERSON 
    approaches.  Jake rouses himself briefly, then wags his tail 
  in recognition of whoever this is.  A man s HAND reaches in 
  and turns the yellow dog bowl UPSIDE DOWN, then gives Jake a 
  treat before walking away.

    Filled with refuse from various tents and homes, it s a foul-
    smelling place.  Tyrol ducks into the area, glances around 
    furtively, then reaches under a particularly smelly pile of

  the envelope and sees various OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS, then stuffs 
  it into a pocket and walks out of the dump.

                  Think with your head, Chief, not 
                  your heart.  The only way they

  Gaeta RUNNING through the streets...


    A HAND reaches in and turns Jake s dog dish upside down.  
  This time we PAN UP and reveal that the source of these 
    secret messages is Gaeta.  He glances around, then heads off.


    D Anna is giving Jake a treat.   She s about to walk off, 
  when she notices -- the dog food bowl is upside down.  




                                                                          (CONTINUED)    'Occupation' - FULL COLLATED 5/11/06 47.

  She looks at the bowl for a long beat, picks it up -- nothing 
    unusual about it.  She puts it back, begins to walk away, but 
    something about that bowl is nagging at her.  She goes back, 
  turns it right side up, then heads off.


  Tyrol turns a corner and reacts at the sight of Jake s right 
  side up bowl.  He s disappointed, knows what that means.


    Anders tossing a ball into the goal...


  Tigh, smoking grimly...
