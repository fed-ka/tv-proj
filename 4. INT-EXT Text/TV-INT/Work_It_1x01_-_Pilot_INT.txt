going to make this easier.  Go ahead.  

Make me pretty.

LEE

Okay.  I ve been wearing Connie s 

clothes, but I m not sure they re 

going to fit you.

ANGEL

I might have something.

HE LEADS LEE INTO HIS CLOSET AND SHOWS HIM A PILE OF WOMEN S 
CLOTHES.  LEE PULLS OUT SOME BRAS AND A BLOUSE.

LEE (CONT D)

Alright, let s take a look at you.  

LEE LOOKS HIM OVER APPRAISINGLY.

LEE (CONT D)

The good news is, you ve got a long 

neck and narrow shoulders.  The bad 

news is you ve got no hips and your 

ass is flat as a pancake.

ANGEL

(HURT)  Hey.

LEE

We need to put you in something that s 

going to give you some curves.  Maybe 

a skirt with a pleat or ruffle and a 

chunky belt.

Damn, where d you learn this stuff?

LEE IS GETTING READY FOR HIS INTERVIEW WITH VANESSA.  (NOTE: 
THE MUSIC CUE FOR THIS IS NOT  DUDE LOOKS LIKE A LADY. )  

HE TRIES ON A TRULY UNFORTUNATE SHORT SKIRT... THEN A WRAP 
DRESS, WHICH HE CANNOT KEEP CLOSED BECAUSE HE HAS TIED THE 
BELT AROUND HIS NECK, THINKING IT IS A SCARF... THEN A 
CONSERVATIVE BUTTON-DOWN COLLARED BLOUSE, WHICH LOOKS GREAT 
UNTIL WE PAN DOWN AND REVEAL THAT IT STOPS ABOUT THREE INCHES 
ABOVE HIS BELLY BUTTON...

NOW IN A NICE BUSINESS SKIRT, HE SQUEEZES INTO A PAIR OF 
CONNIE S HEELS AND PRACTICES WALKING.  TO KEEP HIS BALANCE, 
HE SQUATS AND HOLD HIS ARMS OUT, WHICH MAKES HIM LOOK LIKE 
SOMEONE WHO S TRYING TO WALK A TIGHTROPE AND TAKE A SHIT AT 
THE SAME TIME.  FINALLY, HE STARTS TO GET THE HANG OF IT.  HE 
CONFIDENTLY STRIDES ACROSS THE ROOM AND STOPS IN FRONT OF THE 
MIRROR.  HE CLEARLY LIKES WHAT HE SEES.  UNTIL HE TURNS 
SIDEWAYS AND NOTICES THE BULGE IN HIS SKIRT. 

HE LOOKS AT A ROLL OF DUCT TAPE, WINCES, AND TOSSES IT ASIDE.  
PICKS UP AN EXTENSION CORD AND REJECTS THAT, TOO.  THEN FINDS 
AN ACE BANDAGE: THAT S MORE LIKE IT...

BACK IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR, HE TURNS SIDEWAYS: NO MORE 
BULGE.  HE SMILES, PLEASED.  

HE LOOKS THROUGH CONNIE S MAKE-UP DRAWER.  IT S A SEA OF 
CONFUSION: JUST A BUNCH OF UNLABELED PALETTES OF COLORED 
POWDER.  HE RUBS THINGS, SMELLS THINGS, TASTES THINGS.  THEN 
HE SHRUGS AND WE...
