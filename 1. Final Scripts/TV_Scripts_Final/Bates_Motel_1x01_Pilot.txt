      INT. BOY S BEDROOM - DAY

      OVERHEAD SHOT  -- The light tells us it s late afternoon and 
      we are looking down at a BEAUTIFUL TEENAGE BOY splayed on his 
      back across his bed -- still dressed like he fell asleep in 
      his clothes. Completely still -- unconscious?  Dead?  In the 
      BG we hear what sounds like DIALOGUE from an old romantic 
      comedy - David Nivens and Doris Day.  We SLOWLY MOVE DOWN AND 
      CLOSER until we are RIGHT UP AGAINST HIS FACE...

      CU ON NORMAN CHARLES BATES

      Angelic in sleep. Sixteen years old.  Good looking.  Refined 
      features.  A sweetness and a sensuality.  We HEAR him 
      breathing.  Good, he s not dead.  Soft, even breaths.  

      Then his eyes open.  He just stares for a moment, almost as 
      if he isn t sure where he is.  Then he slowly sits up.  Looks 
      a little disoriented. Turns off the TV. Was I watching this?


      INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

      Norman walks down the hall.  The way it s shot is STYLIZED.  
      We see him from the back, shadowed.  Then from a LOW ANGLE as 
      he PASSES BY CAMERA.    

      CU on his hands -- steadying himself on the wall for a 
      second.  He seems almost dizzy.

      Norman s head tracks past FAMILY PHOTOS on the wall.  Old, 
      black and white photos of hard scrabble depression-era  
      family members staring out at us hauntingly, like the photos 
      of Dorthea Lange or Walker Evans.  

      Further down, the photos get newer.  BABY PHOTOS.  Other 
      family members now in COLOR.  We land on one photo in 
      particular -- a MAN and a WOMAN on their wedding day.  All 
      happiness and light...

      Norman stops to look at the PHOTO.  The wide smiles of the 
      couple.  It s almost like it takes him out of his trance.  
      Norman starts to remember where he is.  Then, anxious...

                                  NORMAN
                    Mom?                                                                                        2.


      INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

      CLOSE ON TWO POTS ON THE STOVE -- ANGRILY BOILING OVER.  
      STEAMING WHITE FOAM running down the sides into the FLARING 
      GAS BURNERS.   Dinner ignored.   CLOSE ON NORMAN S HANDS 
      turning off the BURNERS.  

                                  NORMAN
                          (where the hell is she)
                    Mother?

      NORMAN S POV - A FLICKERING LIGHT

      What the hell is that?  Sputtering on and off, coming through 
      the door into the house FROM THE GARAGE.  

      ON NORMAN

      Approaching the open door.  Slowly.  Not sure what s 
      happening.  He looks into the garage.  STAY ON HIS FACE as he 
      sees something horrible and heartbreaking...


      INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

      CLOSE ON A MAN s FACE...head against the floor...eyes 
          open...staring...blood pooling on the floor around the back 
      of his head. 

      This is SAM BATES (45). PULL BACK SLOWLY to see A HUGE METAL 
      SHELVING UNIT has FALLEN OVER ON TOP OF HIM...Paint and tools 
      and hardware all over the place... PAINT PLOPS slowly from 
      one of the cans onto the floor.  

      BACK ON SAM S UNSEEING EYES.  We may recognize Sam -- he is 
      the man in the wedding picture in the hallway...

      THE OVERHEAD FLUORESCENT LIGHT was hit by the falling  
      shelving unit.  It is DANGLING on one side and slowly 
      SWAYING, FLICKERING and HUMMING, trying to stay lit.  

      CU ON NORMAN S FACE as he kneels down and touches Sam s face.  
      Realizes he s DEAD.  

                                  NORMAN
                          (shouting)
                    Mother!

      He jumps up.                                                                                          3.


      INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

      SMASH CUT TO Norman RACING DOWN THE HALLWAY, shot from 
      EXTREME UP ANGLES.  Toward the BEDROOM.  We now HEAR A 
      RUNNING SHOWER... 

                                  NORMAN
                    MOTHER!   

      He runs THROUGH HER BEDROOM.  HIS FISTS POUND on the BATHROOM 
      DOOR -- 

                                  NORMAN (CONT D)
                    MOTHER! OPEN THE DOOR!

      The DOOR FINALLY OPENS and we see...

      NORMA LOUISE BATES

      Closing the ROBE she s just put on -- a quick flash of skin.  
      Norma is a strikingly beautiful woman in her early forties.  
      Smart and grounded.  At the moment she has a peculiar, 
      HEARTBROKEN look on her face.  Considering the circumstances, 
      should she not seem more alarmed?  

      We notice a SCRATCH MARK on her arm.  She is nervous and 
      anxious but makes an effort to speak in an calm tone --

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    What is it, Norman?

      Norman is terrified.

                                  NORMAN
                    It s Dad!  He s...
                          (too upset)
                    Hurry! 

      Norman turns and races back toward the garage.  We STAY ON 
      NORMA a beat, watching her son go, bracing herself.


      INT. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

      CLOSE ON THE SHELVING.  Norman GROANS like a weightlifter as 
      he LIFTS and SHOVES the unit, trying to get it off his 
      father.  But it s too heavy.  It collapses back on top of 
      him.  Norman falls down from the effort, starts CRYING. 

      CU ON NORMA as she STEPS INTO THE GARAGE and sees the scene.  
      Her expression is not SHOCK but SADNESS, an overwhelming 
      sadness, as tears flood her eyes.                                                                                        4.


      Norman starts trying to PULL HIS DAD OUT as Norma now comes 
      and kneels next to him.  

                                  NORMAN
                    Mother, help me!  

      Norma looks at Sam s dead face with REMORSE.  She puts her 
      hand gently on Norman s head.  

                                  NORMAN (CONT D)
                          (anguished)
                    Dad?  Dad?

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Norman.  

      Norman just keeps SOBBING.  Gives up on his rescue efforts.  
      Instead, cradles his father s bloody head in his arms, not 
      caring that his father s blood is getting all over himself.  

      Norma gently pulls him away...

                                  NORMA LOUISE (CONT D)
                    Norman, honey, I m so sorry...

      Norman falls into her, sobbing.  She sits on the floor 
      holding him.  Rocking him against her.  Her heart breaking. 
      But, we sense, only for him.  We STAY ON TABLEAU OF THEM FOR 
      A LONG TIME.  Maybe UNCOMFORTABLY LONG.  It s kind of 
      beautiful. These two beings who are like one, emotionally 
      absorbed into each other, sitting on the floor in the middle 
      of this complete chaos. 

      We now HEAR A DISTANT SIREN.

                                                                          SMASH TO:

      BLACK.  Letters seep in reading,  Six Months Later .      
      HOLD ON IT A MOMENT, then SMASH TO:


      INT. NORMA S CAR - DAY

      NORMAN S POV - A GORGEOUS NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COASTLINE

      As we drive by Humboldt Bay Harbor.  A small and picturesque 
      inlet. We are seeing at seventy miles an hour.  It s amazing.

      FIND NORMAN looking out the window.  Lost in thought.  FIND 
      NORMA glancing over at him.  Then...

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    This is the part where you say 
                     Mother, this is beautiful.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                      5.

                                  NORMA LOUISE (CONT'D)
                    I m so happy we re moving here.  
                    You are so smart to have thought of 
                    this... 

      The car turns off the main road into the town: a quaint, 
      coastal town built in the 1920 s which sits next to the 
      harbor.  Charming, but also with an upscale quality to its 
       quaintness .  

      Norman smiles the half smile of someone who loves the person 
      who s being a needy-pain-in-the-ass-at-this-moment. And knows 
      them well.  And knows this ritual.  

                                  NORMAN
                          (rote)
                     Mother this is beautiful.  I m so 
                    happy you are making me move here.  
                    You are so smart to force me to do 
                    things I have no say in... 

      Norma smiles the same half smile.  They are related. 

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                          (I love you)
                    You re an asshole.
                          (then)
                    Close your eyes...

      NORMAN S POV - BLACK

                                  NORMA LOUISE (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    Okay, here it is...


      EXT. MOTEL/ BATES HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

      Norma stands behind Norman, beaming as Norman opens his eyes 
      to see...

      THE HOUSE AND MOTEL

      A twelve unit, single story motel circa 1950 over which looms 
      a two story, California Victorian style house.  There is 
      something odd and haunting about this place.  And it s 
      isolated -- on the edge of town.

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    What do you think?

      Norman just laughs.  

                                  NORMAN
                    This is crazy, Mom.                                                                                      6.


                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    It s not crazy.  We re going to run 
                    this place.  We own a motel, Norman 
                    Bates!  Come on, I want to show you 
                    the house...

      She takes off like a little kid.  Norman is skeptical.


      INT. BATES HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

      We are inside the dark foyer as the DOOR SQUEAKS OPEN letting 
      some LIGHT in. Norma and Norman step in.  The atmosphere is 
      dark and heavy: old Victorian furniture and dusty velvet 
      drapes, etc.  Norma walks through, turning on lights and 
      opening curtains, etc...                    

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    ...I bought the whole thing, house 
                    and motel, on a foreclosure.  
                      Everything came with it --

                                  NORMAN
                    Awesome.  You can t buy furniture 
                    like this anymore.  Mostly because 
                    no one wants it --

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Yeah, yeah.  I know. It s ugly. So 
                    we ll use it for now and redecorate 
                    as we get ahead.  You have to 
                    imagine this room without all this 
                    crap in it -- just simple elegant 
                      furnishings - open space - light, 
                    linen drapes -- fresh flowers.  The 
                    space is actually awesome --

      She really sees it.  Has a vision for this place.  Then --  

                                  NORMA LOUISE (CONT D)
                    C mon, I ll show you the 
                      upstairs...

      She trots upstairs.  STAY ON NORMAN a beat, not seeing her 
      vision.  Just seeing some butt ugly furniture. 


      EXT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

      Norman is looking in the doorway of a bedroom with a peaked 
      roof and a garret window.  

                                  NORMAN
                    I like this room.                                                                                      7.


      Norma appears behind him.

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Oh.  Yeah, it s a cool room but I 
                    put you down here closer to me...

      She takes his hand and pulls him along the hallway.

      She shows him his room.  The bed is up against the wall that 
      connects to her room.  

                                  NORMA LOUISE (CONT D)
                    This is your room...

      STAY WITH THEM as she pulls him into the room next to it...

                                  NORMA LOUISE (CONT D)
                    And this is my room!

      We may or may not notice the beds are about as close as they 
      could be without actually being in the same room.  Norman 
      does not look thrilled, by any of this.  She leans toward him 
      and puts her hands on his shoulders.

                                  NORMA LOUISE (CONT D)
                    Norman, we ve been through a lot.  
                    This is a chance to start over --

                                  NORMAN
                    Maybe some people don t get to 
                    start over.  Maybe they just bring 
                      themselves to a new place. 

      She looks him right in the eye.  She knows he s anxious. She 
      wants to assure him.

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    They do get to start over.  But 
                    they have to try.  And they have to 
                      believe...

      He looks at her with exhausted affection.   You re an idiot.  

                                  NORMAN
                    Are you going to ask me to clap if 
                    I believe in fairies?  

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                          (smiles; fuck you)
                    Yes.
                          (then)
                    Norman.  For me.  It s all going to 
                    be good.   You ll see.                                                                                      8.


      EXT. BATES HOUSE - LATER

      Night is falling.  Norman is outside, getting some of the 
      boxes out of the U-Haul.  He stops for a moment, hears a 
      coyote howling.  Looks around.  

      NORMAN S POV - THE LANDSCAPE

      It s dark and isolated.  Thick woods and mountains. A few 
      scattered, rural properties up the road.  

      RESUME NORMAN

      He picks up the last box and heads toward the house, 
      seeing...

      HIS MOM S SILHOUETTE

      Against the shades in her bedroom.  There s something about 
      it that looks and feels both haunting and sexual.  (NOTE: It 
      should be reminiscent of the iconic silhouette from the 
      original movie.) 

      RESUME NORMAN

      Focusing on it for a long moment, like he s almost getting  
      mentally lost -- going somewhere else.  Then he comes out of 
      it.  Starts lugging the heavy box up to the house.  

                                  NORMAN
                          (sarcastic affection)
                     It s all going to be good, 
                      Norman... .

                                            ACT ONE


      EXT. BUS STOP - DAY

      The next morning.  We are CLOSE ON NORMAN who waits at a 
      SCHOOL BUS STOP about five hundred yards from the motel, 
      listening to music on his phone, earbuds in.  He is staring 
      at the landscape, lost in his own head, pensive and stoic and 
      agitated all at once.  WE HEAR the MUSIC (OVER) - it s the 
      cacophonous and angry  EROICA  by Beethoven. 

      NORMAN S POV - THE LANDSCAPE

      Wild and isolated.  MUSIC PLAYS OVER.  Suddenly a GIRL S 
      SMILING FACE comes into frame. This is BRADLEY KENNER, 16, 
      pretty, bright, and effortlessly sexy. She has a depth to her 
      that makes her seem older than she is - in a good way.  She 
      takes the earbuds out of his ears and smiles a completely 
      winning smile.  END MUSIC.

                                    BRADLEY
                    You re new.

      A CABAL OF CUTE TEENAGE GIRLS circle around him. Fresh meat 
      in a small town.  Studying him like he s in a petri dish.  
      Norman, not used to this kind of overt attention, covers his 
      anxiety. Smiles slyly. 

                                  NORMAN
                    This must be a really small town --

      The girls, JENNA, HAYDEN, LISSA, start pummeling him with 
      questions. Overlapping each other --

                                    BRADLEY
                    What s your name?

                                  NORMAN
                    Norman Bates.

                                  JENNA
                    When did you move here, Norman 
                    Bates?

                                  NORMAN
                    Last night --

                                    BRADLEY
                    Where?  What house?

                                  NORMAN
                    Here.  The house at the motel --                                                                                    10.


                                  HAYDEN
                    Ohhh, you bought the motel --

                                  LISSA
                    You actually going to live here or 
                    are you just flipping the property?

                                  NORMAN
                    We re not flipping --

                                  LISSA
                          (to Hayden; meaningfully)
                    He s not flipping --

                                  JENNA
                    You have any brothers?

                                  NORMAN
                    An older brother.  He doesn t live 
                    here.  Just me and my mom --

                                    BRADLEY
                    You have a girlfriend?

      Everyone goes silent. Norman feels a little awkward. 

                                  NORMAN
                    Um, no.

      They all smile.  A CONVERTIBLE BMW pulls up.  The girl behind 
      the wheel, KENNEDY (17) smiles...

                                    KENNEDY
                    Want a ride?

                                    BRADLEY
                          (re: new car)
                    You got it!  Oh my God it s 
                    amazing! 

      The girls all jump in the car.  (We may or may not notice all 
      the girls have really nice, expensive clothes and accessories 
      for  small town  kids. Weird.) Bradley grabs Norman s hand --

                                    BRADLEY (CONT D)
                    C mon --

      Norman doesn t know what he s getting into but isn t about to 
      say  no, I ll wait for the bus.   He glances toward the 
      house, a little anxious, hoping his Mom isn t seeing this.                                                                                    11.


      INT. BMW - MOMENTS LATER

      It s squished.  Norman sits in the middle of the back seat, a 
      girl on either side. Bradley is on his lap.  The girls are 
      all chattering away, acting like this is all completely 
      normal.  Norman is, on one level, enjoying it, and on 
      another, deeper level, completely overwhelmed and freaked 
      out. 

                                  HAYDEN
                    -- I totally would have hooked up 
                    with him but he had left the party 
                    with Kelly.  The slut --

                                  JENNA
                    Oh sure - why is she the slut just 
                    because a guy you re hot for blew 
                    you off and went with her?  I 
                      personally think he s the slut --

                                    BRADLEY
                    I agree.  Points for Jenna.

                                  HAYDEN
                    I don t care if he s a slut or not.  
                    I just want to get him naked.  Sue 
                    me --

      Bradley glances down at Norman who is starting to sweat a 
      little.  He looks uncomfortable. (The chatter should continue 
      in the BG.)

                                    BRADLEY
                    Am I too heavy?

                                  NORMAN
                    Um, no.  You re fine.

      Bradley takes his phone.  Puts her number in it.  Takes a 
      picture of herself and adds it to her contact in his phone. 

                                    BRADLEY
                          (handing it to him)
                    Bradley Kenner.  You have any 
                    questions at school, you call me.

      Bradley is more friendly and kind than flirtatious.  But 
      there is still an attraction there.  It s just down played. 

                                  NORMAN
                          (takes the phone)
                    Thanks.                                                                                     12.


      INT. BATES HOUSE - LATER

      CLOSE ON WEDDING PHOTO (we saw from teaser).  We now know it 
      is Norma and Sam. 

      FIND NORMA stopping to look at the photo as she unpacks it.  
      Her face is both sad and angry.  There is a lot of history 
      there.  She puts it on the shelf, in a prominent spot, among 
      other photos she has put out.  STAY ON HER FACE A LONG 
      MOMENT, just looking at it, a weird reverie of conflicting 
      emotion.  None of them good.  She s lost in it. Then, CUTTING 
      THROUGH...

                                    WOMAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hello?  Can I come in?

      Norma, startled, turns sharply to see...

      MARCIE CALAHAN

      Thirty-eight.  Cute in a soccer mom way.  Holds a large, 
      pretty basket with something wrapped in butcher paper inside.

                                  MARCIE
                    The doorbell s broken.  I saw your 
                    car outside ---

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                          (guarded)
                    What can I do for you?

      Marcie extends her hand. 

                                  MARCIE
                    Marcie Calahan.  I live up the road 
                    at Calahan Creek Farms.  Just 
                    stopped by to welcome you to the 
                      neighborhood.

      Norma visibly relaxes. Shakes Marcie s hand. (NOTE: Marcie, 
      like the girls at the bus stop, is dressed really well for 
      someone who owns  small pig farm.  Her clothes and 
      accessories are very upscale.) 

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Norma Bates.  

                                  MARCIE
                    Hope it s okay I just opened the 
                    front door and walked in.  We re 
                    all pretty friendly around here. 
                    Small town, you know --
                          (then; remembering)
                    Here, I brought you something --                                                                                    13.


      She hands it to Norma.  Norma looks in the basket.  Some 
      BLOOD is seeping through the butcher paper.

                                  MARCIE (CONT D)
                    It s pork.  
                          (off Norma s face)
                    We have an artisan pork farm.  All 
                    free range and organically fed.  

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Well, thank you.  This is so kind --

                                  MARCIE
                          (looking at photos)
                    It s the loin and the ribs.  It s 
                    the best part -- 
                          (then seeing wedding 
                            photo)
                    Is this you and your husband?
                    He s a nice looking man.  Kind of a 
                    Mitt Romney thing going on --

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Sam actually passed away about six 
                    months ago.  There was an accident 
                    at our house --

                                  MARCIE
                    Oh my God.  Oh my holy God.  I m 
                    so, so DEEPLY sorry. You must miss 
                    him terribly --

      A beat, then.  We sense Norma has some deep feelings about 
      this and not pleasant ones.  But we see her swim to the 
      surface and smile and speak with utter, heartfelt 
      conviction...

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Yes.  Sam was a wonderful man.  A 
                    loving husband and father. 
                          (then)
                    But here we are.  My son and I, 
                    starting over --

                                  MARCIE
                    Oh shit.  I m so sorry.  There s 
                    blood dripping on your floor.

      Norma realizes the fresh pork blood is seeping through the 
      basket.  There s blood on her hands.  She s trying not to 
      look horrified.  Marcie, apparently used to this, grabs a WAD 
      OF TISSUES from her purse and cleans it up.  Hands it to 
      Norma to wipe off her hand.                                                                                     14.


                                  MARCIE (CONT D)
                    Sorry.  Side effect of slaughter.  
                    It s fresh! 
                          (then)
                    Well I ll let you get back to 
                      unpacking. 
                          (heading out)
                    And I know this may be  too early .  
                    But there s some cute, wealthy 
                    divorced men here -- I could 
                    introduce you to when you re ready--
                          (off Norma s face)
                    I m sorry!  Shot my mouth off.  
                    It s too early.  I m an idiot.  I 
                    apologize --

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    No, not at all.  I really 
                      appreciate it.  I just -- I can t 
                    even think about that right now.  
                    Norman s been through so much.  And 
                    I have my hands full -- starting a 
                    new business and raising a son.  
                    And I just want to be here for 
                    Norman right now.  He s a -- 
                    sensitive boy --


      INT. CLASSROOM - LATER

      A teacher, MISS WATSON, (28) perky and attractive, is reading 
      the last page from OF MICE AND MEN aloud to the class.  

                                  MISS WATSON
                     We gonna get a little place , 
                    George began...

      PAN AROUND CLASSROOM -- from one face to another -- no one 
      really engaged -- watching the clock -- texting -- bored -- 
      etc...

                                  MISS WATSON (CONT D)
                     ... me and you.    You ...an me.  
                    Everybody gonna be nice to you.  
                    Nobody gonna hurt nobody or steal 
                    from them...   

      FIND NORMAN who is completely engrossed.  Leveled by this sad 
      story.  His eyes starting to mist up and he s trying to 
      control it.  But it s just so fucking moving.  Move CLOSER 
      AND CLOSER ON HIM...                                                                                    15.


                                  MISS WATSON (CONT D)
                    Lennie begged,  Let s do it now.  
                    Let s get that place now.    Sure, 
                    right now.   And George raised the 
                    gun and steadied it and he brought 
                    the muzzle of it close to the back 
                    of Lennie s head --

      And the BELL RINGS.  All the students are up and on their way 
      out before she can finish the sentence.

                                  MISS WATSON (CONT D)
                    Fine.  Go.  Test is going to be 
                    tomorrow so make sure you ve all 
                    read it --

      She notices Norman.  Sniffling.  Wiping his eyes a little.  
      He s packing his stuff up.  

                                  MISS WATSON (CONT D)
                    Norman?  Can we talk for a minute?

      Norman looks worried, wondering what she wants...


      SAME - MINUTES LATER

      Norman is seated across from Miss Watson. She has his school 
      records out.  He is uncomfortable.  Feels like he s going to 
      get in trouble for something although he doesn t know what 
      exactly.

                                  NORMAN
                    Is something wrong?

                                  MISS WATSON
                    No, no. Not at all.  I m going to 
                    be your advisor here. Now, I ve 
                    just been reviewing your school 
                    records and -- I have a question.  
                    Your grades are less than stellar.  
                    They re actually less than average.  
                    But then, here and there, you ll 
                    suddenly have an A plus in geometry 
                    or, here, in life science.  And 
                    your test scores are really 
                      impressive.  But your grades don t 
                    match up with them.  And that s a 
                    shame. Why do you think that is, 
                    Norman?

                                  NORMAN
                    I don t know - exactly.                                                                                    16.


      Awkward silence.  She just looks at him.  Smiles.

                                  MISS WATSON
                    Well, take a guess.

      He really doesn t know.  This direct questioning is making 
      him really uncomfortable.  Feeling very vulnerable.  This is 
      not lost on Miss Watson. Finally...

                                  NORMAN
                    We move a lot?

                                  MISS WATSON
                    I see that.  You ve been in five 
                    different schools.  

      He smiles. Awkward. Nervous. Miss Watson studies him for a 
      moment.  Feels like there s something going on with this kid.

                                  MISS WATSON (CONT D)
                    Is everything okay at home?

                                  NORMAN
                    Yeah.  Yeah.  My mom s just a 
                    little -- impulsive.  She gets 
                    ideas about things and then we move 
                    and  start over .  

      Miss Watson just studies him for a beat, then...

                                  MISS WATSON
                    Have you started thinking about 
                    colleges?

                                  NORMAN
                    Not really.

                                  MISS WATSON
                    Don t you ever think about the 
                    future?  About when you  grow up ?

                                  NORMAN
                    I guess not, really. 

      She smiles at him, but looks concerned and makes a few 
      notations on his records.  He quietly tries to read them but 
      she notices and closes it. Still smiling.  He smiles back, 
      awkward. A moment, then...

                                  MISS WATSON
                    I think it might be a good idea, 
                    now that you re here, for you to 
                    try and put down some roots.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    17.

                                  MISS WATSON (CONT'D)
                    Get involved.  Maybe try out for a 
                    sports team --

                                  NORMAN
                    I don t really play any sports.  My 
                    mom never really liked them --

      She looks at him another beat, then...

                                  MISS WATSON
                    How about track?  All you need to 
                    know how to do is run.  You look 
                    like a runner.  Ever do any 
                    running?

                                  NORMAN
                    Not as a sport, no.  

                                  MISS WATSON
                    Track team try outs are today.  Why 
                    don t you talk to Coach Carpenter 
                    after school?  I ll tell him you re 
                    coming down --

      Norman isn t at all sure how he feels about this.  He nods, 
      dubious.

                                  NORMAN
                    Um, okay...

      Miss Watson leans toward him, innocently intimate. 

                                  MISS WATSON
                    Norman, I see that you lost your 
                    Dad recently.  I know how hard that 
                    must be.  Please know that you can 
                    come to me if you have any issues 
                    or questions about anything.  I m 
                    here for you. 

      ON NORMAN, suddenly paralyzed by how close she is.  Almost 
      sweating. 

                                  NORMAN
                          (abruptly)
                    I have to go now.

                                                                          SMASH TO:


      INT. BATES HOUSE/KITCHEN - LATER

      CLOSE ON THE RAW PORK AS A BUTCHER KNIFE CUTS INTO IT ---                                                                                    18.


      FIND NORMA on the other end of the knife.  Preparing dinner.  
      Focused.  Intent.  Her CELL PHONE RINGS.  She glances over...

      NORMA S POV - THE CALLER ID READS  DYLAN 

      RESUME NORMA not wanting to pick it up.  Then, giving in, 
      reluctantly answers.

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                          (coolly)
                    Hello, Dylan --

      INTERCUT WITH


      EXT. MIDDLE CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

      DYLAN BATES (21), handsome and moody, sort of a James Dean 
      thing going on, sits on the back of his motorcycle in front 
      of a house that has a FOR SALE sign on the lawn, phone to his 
      ear. 

                                  DYLAN
                          (pissed)
                    Thanks for telling me you moved, 
                    Mom.

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    I m pretty sure the last time we 
                    spoke you told me to  drop dead, 
                    bitch.   Sorry, I took it 
                      personally.

                                  DYLAN
                    So you think it s okay to not tell 
                    your own kid that you (fucking) 
                    moved?  What if I got hurt?  What 
                    if I was in the hospital?  What if 
                    I needed you?

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                          (flat; annoyed)
                    Are you hurt?  Are you in the 
                    hospital?  

      Dylan s face hardens.  Bitch.  Then...

                                  DYLAN
                    I need some (fucking) money.  My 
                    job fell apart --

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                          (not impressed)
                    What happened this time?                                                                                    19.


                                  DYLAN
                    My boss was an asshole and I told 
                    him that.

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Always someone else s fault, isn t 
                    it, Dylan?

                                  DYLAN
                          (implying his whole life 
                          is her fault) 
                    Yeah, Norma.  Maybe it is.  Can you 
                    just cut the crap and wire me some 
                    money --

      She is silent for a long moment.  Then, HANGS UP ON HIM.

      STAY ON DYLAN

      Furious.  Puts his phone away. 

                                  DYLAN (CONT D)
                          (under his breath)
                    Whore.

      He starts his motorcycle and takes off OUT OF FRAME.


      EXT. BATES HOUSE - LATER

      It s dusk.  Norman heads up the steps, finally home from 
      school.


      INT. BATES HOUSE/KITCHEN - SAME TIME

      Norman enters the kitchen.  The table is set for two.  
      Flowers and candles.  Dinner is ready. It s lovely, but 
      almost -- romantic. Norma, at the counter making a salad, 
      turns to see him.  She s a little  chilly .  Norman seems a 
      little nervous.  Watching his mother s face closely...

                                  NORMAN
                    Wow.  Dinner smells great. Mom. 

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Where were you?

      A beat, then...

                                  NORMAN
                    I stayed after school to try out 
                    for the track team.                                                                                      20.


      He pulls out a track uniform and a permission slip from his 
      back pack with some trepidation.  She just looks at him, 
      trying to not reveal how annoyed she is. He feels the ice in 
      the air.  Knew this was coming ---

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    The track team?

                                  NORMAN
                    It was Miss Watson s idea --

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                          (who the fuck is Miss 
                            Watson)
                    Miss Watson?

                                  NORMAN
                    My Language Arts teacher.  She 
                    thought it would be a good idea for 
                    me to get involved at school.  That 
                    it would be good for me.

      Norma retracts a little.  She knows this is probably true.  
      She is quiet for a moment.  Norman hands her the permission 
      slip.

                                  NORMAN (CONT D)
                    I need you to sign this parent 
                      permission slip, though --

      Norma, unnerved by all this, takes the paper and looks at it.  
      Then...

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    This is, like, every day after 
                    school.  And track meets on 
                      Saturday s --

      Then she just starts to lose it...

                                  NORMA LOUISE (CONT D)
                    Norman, we just bought a MOTEL.  
                    How do you think I m going to get 
                    it up and running without your 
                    help?  I mean, really.  You re 
                    putting me in a tough spot --

                                  NORMAN
                    Mom, it s okay.  I don t have to do 
                    it --                                                                                    21.


                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    No!  I m not going to be the mother 
                    who says her kid can t be on the 
                    track team.  I ll just do 
                      everything by myself!  Like I 
                    always do!

      She starts getting her coat and purse.

                                  NORMAN
                    Mom, c mon.  I don t have to do it!  
                    C mon.  Eat dinner --

      Heading out.

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    I m not hungry.  I have to go get 
                    some groceries.  You can serve 
                    yourself dinner.

      And she s gone.  Door slamming behind her.  STAY ON NORMAN A 
      LONG BEAT.  Anxiety.  Frustration.  Fear.  Anger.  He finally 
      bursts and takes the permission slip and violently tears it 
      up.  Then, calling after her, the anguish of a five year old 
      whose mother left them somewhere alone...

                                  NORMAN
                    Mother!


      INT. MARKET - LATER

      Norma, still pissed and hurt, is throwing random items in her 
      cart.  All her movements are angry and upset.  She turns the 
      corner sharply and almost TAKES DOWN a YOUNG GUY (28) holding 
      one of those plastic, market baskets.  

                                  YOUNG GUY
                    Whoa!  You got insurance for that 
                    thing?

      She stops, embarrassed.  

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    I m sorry.  I was -- I wasn t 
                    thinking --

      He smiles at her.  He s actually pretty cute.  And from the 
      way he smiles at her we can see he finds her attractive.

                                  YOUNG GUY
                    No worries.                                                                                      22.


      He just holds her eye contact.  She smiles at him.  
      Chemistry.  Then, starting to move on...

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Well, I m glad you re okay.

      She starts off.  

                                  YOUNG GUY
                    Hey, do you know where they hide 
                    the shampoo in this place?  I don t 
                    live around here --

      And they make eye contact again and in this moment, Norma 
      decides something...

                                                                          SMASH TO:


      INT. YOUNG GUY S CAR - LATER

      The windows are completely steamed up. The guy sits on the 
      passenger side, pants around his ankles.  Norma, skirt up 
      around her hips, straddles him, banging the fuck out of him. 


      SAME - LATER

      Post sex. He s exhausted. He s in the driver seat now, 
      zipping up his pants.  She is on the passenger side, finding 
      and pulling on her panties with the alacrity and matter-of-
      factness of someone who has done this more than once. He 
      looks at her and we can tell from how he looks at her that he 
      really likes her.  He leans over, touching her hair and 
      speaking softly. 

                                  YOUNG GUY
                    Hey, when can I see you again?

      Norma is in a different movie.  She s all business.

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    You can t. 
                          (then)
                    I ve got to go.  I ve got ice cream 
                    in the trunk.

      She exits the car,  STAY ON HER as she walks to her car, no 
      sense of remorse or self questioning. She gets in her car, 
      slamming the door shut and we...

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK:
                                        END ACT ONE                                                                                    23.


                                            ACT TWO


      INT. GARDEN SHED - DAY

      The SHED DOORS OPEN TO REVEAL a bunch of GNARLY LOOKING 
      GARDEN TOOLS hanging on an old peg board in a dilapidated 
      shed: RUSTY SAWS, GARDEN SHEERS, PRUNING BLADE, etc.  Creepy 
      as shit...

      FIND NORMAN

      Studying all of these.  Kind of fascinated.  Then he sees 
      something UNDER AN OLD TARP in the corner.  He approaches 
      slowly.  Pulls it off, revealing  AN OLD MANUAL LAWN MOWER.


      EXT. MOTEL - MINUTES LATER

      CLOSE ON THE BLADES cutting through the tall grass...

      ON NORMAN -- It s early morning as he pushes the old lawn 
      mower across the front lawn.  It s hard and physical.  Norma 
      comes out, hands him some orange juice.  (We sense they 
      haven t spoken much since the previous night when she left 
      the house.)  

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    I brought this for you.

      He wonders if she has stopped being angry at him.  He takes 
      it.

                                  NORMAN
                    Thanks.

      He takes a long drink.  Norma looks at him, feeling bad about 
      last night with him.

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Norman, I m sorry about the track 
                    team.  I m sorry I was so upset.  
                    You re right, you should be getting 
                    involved.  And I want you to.  It s 
                    just that, right now, I ve got to 
                    get this place in shape in a few 
                    weeks so we can open and start 
                    making money.  I m just -- feeling 
                    the pressure, I guess --

      Norman s body visibly relaxes. Relieved to be in his mother s 
      good graces.                                                                                      24.


                                  NORMAN
                    It s okay, Mom.  I get it.  I don t 
                    know what I was thinking --

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    There will be time for all that.  I 
                    promise.  

      She takes the empty glass. Kisses him on the forehead.  
      Smiles and heads back inside.  STAY ON NORMAN, back to 
      cutting the grass.  Glad his Mom is in a good mood. All is 
      right with the world.  At least for a moment.  He PUSHES the 
      lawn mower --

      ON AN OLD TRUCK pulling up in the driveway.  Rusty and with a 
      crooked bumper.  An old BROOM sticks straight up out of the 
      side panel.

      FIND NORMAN watching a man get out of the truck.  The man, 
      KEITH SUMMERS (51), approaches Norman, who stops mowing.  
      There is something unsettling about this man.  He s 
      disheveled and his clothes look dirty and worn.  There s 
      something about his face that seems disturbed.  Agitated.  He 
      walks right up to Norman without any introduction. 

                                  KEITH
                    Norman Bates?

      Norman looks at him.  Kind of intimidated by this weird dude 
      in his face all of a sudden. 

                                  NORMAN
                    Yes...

                                  KEITH
                    You just moved in the other night.  
                    How you liking the place?

      Norman isn t sure if this is a neighbor or what.  He tries to 
      act like it s all normal.  But he doesn t like this guy. 

                                  NORMAN
                    It s fine so far.

                                  KEITH
                    You live here with your Mom?  

                                  NORMAN
                    Yeah. Do you know her?

      Keith just looks at him. Then...                                                                                    25.


                                  KEITH
                          (I hate her guts)
                    I know about her.

      Ok, this guy is starting to freak Norman out.  Norman starts 
      backing toward the house...

                                  NORMAN
                    You want me to get her?

                                  KEITH
                    Your sixteen.  From Arizona.  Your 
                    Dad died last winter --

                                  NORMAN
                    Let me get my mom --

                                  KEITH
                    And it s just the two of you --

                                  NORMAN
                    Um, yeah --

                                  KEITH
                    What do you know about running a 
                    motel?  Anything?  Because you look 
                    like a little kid.  I don t see you 
                    running anything --

      Norma s voice, strong and clear and not taking any shit, cuts 
      through the tension as she appears behind Norman...

                                  NORMA LOUISE 
                    Can I help you with something?

      Norman is relieved to see his Mom has exited the house and is 
      behind him.  She can see that this guy is bugging Norman and 
      she is in mama bear mode. 

                                  KEITH
                    I think you re the one who s going 
                    to need some help. 

      Norma looks down at him.  You re not intimidating me, 
      asshole. 

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Really?  And how might that be?

                                  KEITH
                    I m Keith Summers.  This is my 
                    family property.  The house and the 
                    motel.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    26.

                                  KEITH (CONT'D)
                    My grandfather built the house in 
                    1930 and my dad built the motel 
                      thirty-five years later. 

      A long moment, then...

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    I m sure it was hard for you to 
                    lose it to the bank.  I m sorry. 
                    But it is our property now.  So if 
                    there s not something I can help 
                    you with --

                                  KEITH
                    You re not getting it.  You can t 
                    run this place.  This is my place.   
                    Now be a smart girl and let me take 
                    over  --

      Norma bristles.  This guy might be crazy.  Might be drunk.  
      Might be dangerous.  But nobody calls her  girl .  

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    I don t know what delusion you re 
                    suffering under.  I don t need 
                    anyone to  take over  --

      Keith gets closer to her.  Utter contempt. Talks down to her 
      in a really hostile, ugly way --

                                  KEITH
                    Really.  You think you can just 
                    drive here from Arizona and take 
                    over the Sea Fairer --

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    It hardly seems very complicated --

                                  KEITH
                          (cuts her off)
                    You don t know anything. 
                          (then; revealing a dark, 
                            emotional underbelly)
                    It s complicated.  There s stuff 
                    that goes on that you know nothing 
                    about --
                          (leans in)
                    I know everything about this place.  
                    Every nook and cranny.  Every leaky 
                    water pipe.  Every dirty secret.
                          (then)
                    You re in over your head.  You 
                    don t know crap about this place. 
                    About this town.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    27.

                                  KEITH (CONT'D)
                    About how things work here.  What 
                    makes you think you can do this by 
                    yourself?

      Something in what he says hits a raw nerve with her.  A seed 
      of truth.  Her own fear said out loud.  It makes her feel 
      terribly, terribly vulnerable.  As a result, she does what 
      she always does when she feels vulnerable.  She goes into 
      survival mode.  She gets back in his face, fierce.  The 
      lady s got a little Clint Eastwood in her...

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Because I can.
                          (then)
                    Now get the hell off my property 
                    you (fucking) pathetic, dirtbag 
                    loser.  And if I ever see you here 
                    again, I ll call the cops or shoot 
                    you myself.  

      She grabs Norman and heads into the house.  Slams the door 
      behind her.  Keith looks at the house for a moment, pissed, 
      almost like he s deciding what fuck he should do. 

      Keith just stares after her.  Somewhere between furious and 
      broken.  We re not sure what side he s going to land on. 

                                  KEITH
                          (yelling after her)
                    I know the cops here!  I grew up 
                    here!  I lived in that house!  
                    That s my house!  You try and call 
                    the cops on me, you (fucking) 
                    bitch!  You just (fucking) try! 


      INT. BATES HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

      Norma and Norman, both still upset and unnerved, peek through 
      the front window.  Both terrified and shaken inside.  Both 
      trying to act like they re not. Keith is getting in his 
      truck. Making a violent u turn and leaving.  

                                  NORMAN
                    Do you think you should have said 
                    all that stuff to him? 

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                          (still watching out the 
                            window; convincing 
                            herself)
                    He s just some pathetic, drunk 
                    slob.  He s not going to bother us 
                    again..                                                                                    28.


      A moment, then...

                                  NORMAN
                          (trying to agree)
                    Yeah.
                          (then; can t help it; 
                            really worried)
                    I don t think he was drunk.

                                                                          SMASH TO:


      INT. BATES HOUSE/KITCHEN - NIGHT

      Norman is doing the dinner dishes while Norma is on the 
      phone...

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    ...I think the last time the 
                    roofing was redone on this place 
                    was in the 50 s. I don t want to 
                    wait until the next century to get 
                    this estimate.  So if you 
                      reschedule me again, I ll take it 
                    somewhere else.  Ok? 

      She hangs up, annoyed.  The doorbell rings.


      INT. FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

      Norma opens the door to find Bradley, Lissa, Jenna and 
      Hayden.  

                                    BRADLEY
                    Hi!  Are you Mrs. Bates?

      Norma is a little guarded.

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    I am.

                                    BRADLEY
                    I m Bradley Kenner.  We re friends 
                    of Norman s from school.  We re 
                    going to the library to study for 
                    the history test and we wondered if 
                    he wanted to study with us?

      Norma looks surprised and not thrilled to see girls there for 
      Norman.  Norman appears behind his mom.  His face lights up 
      seeing Bradley. This does not go unnoticed by Norma.                                                                                     29.


                                  NORMAN
                    Hey...

                                    BRADLEY
                    Hi Norman.  

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    I m sure he would love to go.  But 
                    we re in the middle of doing a lot 
                    of stuff.  We still have unpacking 
                    and all --

                                    BRADLEY
                      Oh...sure.  I totally understand.  

                                  HAYDEN
                    I like your house.  It s cool.

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Thank you.  We have some work to do 
                    but it has potential.

                                  NORMAN
                    Mom, maybe I could ---

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                          (cutting him off)
                    Norman.  Not tonight.  It s not a 
                    good idea.  
                          (looks at him; kindly)
                    Another night.

      The girls sense the tension.  It s a little awkward.

                                    BRADLEY
                    No worries.  Thanks so much.  It 
                    was nice meeting you, Mrs. Bates.

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    You too.  Thanks for stopping by.

      She closes the door.  Norman looks at her, so angry. 

                                  NORMA LOUISE (CONT D)
                    What?

                                  NORMAN
                    How could you do that?  You didn t 
                    even let me answer...                                                                                    30.


                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    There was no point in answering 
                    because I knew you were going to 
                    say  yes  and I knew I would have 
                    to say  no ...

                                  NORMAN
                    I could have gone, Mom.  

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    You can go another time.  Once 
                    we re settled in --

      Norman, angry, sits on his anger and heads back into the 
      kitchen.  But half way there he explodes.

                                  NORMAN
                    That s always what it s going to be 
                    with you.   Later .   Another 
                    time .  When, Mom?  You said you 
                    wanted me to have a life here.  
                    This is how you have one.  You meet 
                    friends.  You let other people in 
                    your life --

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                       Friends ?  I wasn t born yesterday 
                    --

                                  NORMAN
                    So what?  So she s pretty.  So 
                    maybe she kind of likes me. I m 
                    sixteen.  

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Norman you don t even know them.  
                    You have to be a little careful --

                                  NORMAN
                          (yelling; frustrated)
                    Why?  Why do I have to be careful?

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Norman, don t lose your temper at 
                    me.  I m just looking out for you --

      He storms up the stairs, slamming his door.  STAY ON NORMA, 
      frustrated.  Confused.  Did she handle that wrong?  Then, not 
      knowing what else to say -- 

                                  NORMA LOUISE (CONT D)
                    Well maybe you better just stay 
                    there the rest of the night then.                                                                                    31.


      STAY ON HER one beat longer.  Fuck.  That didn t help her 
      feel any better. 


      INT. NORMAN S ROOM - SAME TIME

      Norman, breathing hard, picks up a DOG EARED TEDDY BEAR that 
      shouldn t even be in the room of a sixteen year old boy and 
      CHUCKS IT AGAINST THE WALL.  Realizes what a completely lame 
      gesture that was.  

                                  NORMAN
                    I suck.

      Then he sits on the bed.  Fuck.  Then he starts to think of 
      something.  Something really radical.  Something he s never 
      done before.  He grabs his cell phone and TEXTS 
      BRADLEY...WAIT FOR ME AT THE CORNER.  He throws on a jacket 
      and grabs his history book.


      EXT. NORMAN S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      As he backs out of the open window -- precariously reaching 
      for a nearby tree branch with his foot.  He barely makes it.  
      Almost falls.  Then he s safe.  He starts climbing down.  


      EXT. STREET CORNER - MINUTES LATER

      The girls car is idling.  Norman runs up.  The back door 
      opens.  He sees Bradley s smiling face.  

                                    BRADLEY
                    Get in --


      INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER

      Norman, now in the back seat, as the car takes off.  Bradley 
      sees his book.

                                    BRADLEY
                    Oh my God you are so cute.  You 
                    actually thought we were going to 
                    study...

      ON NORMAN...what the fuck have I gotten into?                                                                                    32.


      INT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT

      Music blasting, drinking, people making out all over the 
      place, dancing/grinding, girls in effortlessly sexy clothing 
      run amuck.  In other words, a normal high school party.  

      NORMAN S POV as he walks through the room, following the 
      girls.  GUYS making friendly/sexual gestures at them about 
      how hot they are, Hayden gets pulled away by SOME DUDE and 
      just starts KISSING HIM like it s a dare, A GROUP OF KIDS 
      with an ELABORATE BAGGIE BONG, ANOTHER COUPLE making out in a 
      guest bathroom with the door ajar as she starts sliding to 
      her knees,  RANDOM GIRLS salaciously checking Norman out, 
      etc...

      ON NORMAN.  Holy fuck.  Never been to a party like this.  
      Never been to anything like this.  Trying not to look 
      completely out of place and overwhelmed, which is how he is 
      feeling.  He sees Bradley peel off and head to the back of 
      the house.  Where is she going?  

      Meanwhile Lissa is making Norman a drink -- Diet Mountain Dew 
      and about half a bottle of vodka.  She hands it to him, 
      smiling...

                                  LISSA
                    Welcome to Humboldt Bay!

      Norman takes it.  Takes a drink as the girls make more drinks 
      and chatter.  He looks at the party over the rim of the huge 
      cup.  This is insane...

      SAME - LATER

      Norman is standing in the kitchen with Lissa and Kaylie who 
      are talking to THREE DUDES who are totally hitting on them.  
      The girls are flirting with the guys and Norman is just kind 
      of standing there with no function. 

                                  DUDE #1
                          (to the girls)
                    I really think you need to come 
                    outside and see this --

                                  LISSA
                            (flirting/teasing)
                    Like what s so different about it?

                                  DUDE #1
                    I m telling you it s some different 
                    deal.  New strain. It s killer --                                                                                    33.


      They all head out.  Norman isn t sure if he s supposed to go 
      with them or not so he just stays behind. By himself.  
      Awkward. Isolated.  Then his gaze lands on...

      BRADLEY

      Talking with a group of people.  Beautiful and cool and real.  
      She sees Norman.  Eyes meet.  He doesn t drop the eye 
      contact.  He keeps it up.  I LIKE YOU, BRADLEY. Bold move.  
      She smiles at him while she finishes talking, then she 
      excuses herself and walks over to him...

                                    BRADLEY
                          (with affection)
                    Did those dumb bitches leave you 
                    here by yourself?

      Norman laughs.

                                  NORMAN
                    It s fine.  There s a lot to look 
                    at.

                                    BRADLEY
                    Was that a line?  You don t seem 
                    like a guy that would have  lines  -

                                  NORMAN
                          (laughs)
                    No, I mean, really, there s a lot 
                    to look at.  This is better than 
                    SPARTACUS --

      Bradley laughs.  She looks at him, kind of just appreciating 
      him.  

                                    BRADLEY
                    You re different, aren t you?

                                  NORMAN
                    I don t know.  Maybe.  I think 
                    people who are different don t know 
                    they re different because they have 
                    nothing to compare it to --

      She moves a little closer.  Still just studying his face.  
      Admiring it. 

                                    BRADLEY
                    Yeah, you re different.  

                                  NORMAN
                    What s so different about me?                                                                                    34.


                                    BRADLEY
                    I don t know exactly.  It s just a 
                    feeling.  You re like a beautiful, 
                    deep, still lake in the middle of a 
                    concrete world --

      Now they are just staring into each other s eyes.  Norman s 
      heart is starting to race.  He doesn t even know what s 
      coming out of his mouth at this point --

                                  NORMAN
                    I am.  That s kind of weird --

                                    BRADLEY
                    You re kind of weird.  Weird-good --

      And just when we think they might actually kiss --

                                    RICHARD (O.S.)
                    Hey Brad - who s doing the 
                    (fucking) recycling in here?

      INCLUDE RICHARD SYLMORE (17), good looking in a cool way, 
      pony tail, artsy. Tall and muscular. Confident. And worst of 
      all, Bradley s boyfriend...

                                    BRADLEY
                    Oh, hey, Richard.  Did you get your 
                    diorama finished?  
                          (then; to Norman)
                    Richard had to do a diorama of the 
                    Globe Theater for his Drama Lit 
                    class.  Seriously, what grade are 
                    we in?

                                    RICHARD
                    Yeah I got it done and it actually 
                    kills.  
                          (looking at the trash)
                    I mean look at this shit.  
                    Assholes.  They ve got the trash 
                    with the plastic with the bottles.  
                    (Fucking) assholes. 

      Richard starts organizing some of it.  Norman helps him.

                                  NORMAN
                    We could put the bottles in this 
                    bag --

                                    RICHARD
                    Thanks Dude.                                                                                      35.


                                    BRADLEY
                    Oh Richard, this is Norman.  He s 
                    new at our school.

      Something in the way that Bradley tried to make that sound so 
       offhand  makes Richard stop and actually look at Norman for 
      a minute.  Checking him out.  That sort of primal thing that 
      guys do. Norman just looks back at him, a weird combination 
      of a blank stare and also not-backing-down.  

                                    RICHARD
                    Hey.

                                  NORMAN
                    Hey.

      They finish with the trash.  

                                    RICHARD
                    There.  Whatever.  Morons. 
                          (turns to Bradley)
                    Jones just got here.  Let s go say 
                    hi --

                                    BRADLEY
                    Oh, okay.  
                          (to Norman)
                    Want to come?

      Richard takes Bradley around her waist. Norman sees this.  
      Gets it.

                                  NORMAN
                    No, I m good.

      Bradley nods and smiles and disappears into he party with 
      Richard.  STAY ON NORMAN.  Watching her walk away. Deflated.  
      She has a boyfriend.  I m an idiot.  We HEAR HIS HEART START 
      THUMPING (OVER).  He starts breathing hard.  Trying to hide 
      it.  

      NORMAN S POV - looking around room.  Everything looks fucked 
      up and  dark  all of a sudden - dancing, hooking up, inhaling 
      smoke from a bong...

      RESUME NORMAN

      His heart thumping LOUDER AND LOUDER...filling with 
      anxiety...Why am I here?  Where am I?  How do I get home?  

                                                                          SMASH TO:                                                                                    36.


      EXT. PARTY HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

      Norman sneaks out a back door.  Just wants to get the fuck 
      out of there.  He finds the car he came in.  Reaches through 
      an open window to get his history book.  Gets it.  Starts 
      walking.  Trotting.  Running.  It s emotional. He s 
        overwhelmed.  Anxious.  Heart pounding.  Why did I come?  Why 
      did I come?  Running faster and faster.  Just wants to get 
      home --

      Then he stops at a crossroad, realizes he recognizes nothing.  
      He has no idea where he is.  He spins around in all 
      directions -- totally lost. And he s in the middle of 
      nowhere.  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck! 

      Norman wants his mother. 


      INT. BATES HOUSE/KITCHEN - LATER

      Norma is finishing cleaning out a cupboard.  Several huge 
      trash bags filled with old crap sit on the floor.  She s 
      finishing scrubbing them.  And she scrubs like she s gong to 
      do surgery in there.  It s microscopically clean. 

      Finally done, Norma stands back and admires it all for a 
      moment.  Proud of herself. Then she HEARS SOMETHING outside.  
      Like something got knocked over.  Weird. She looks out the 
        glass-pained kitchen door...

      NORMA S POV - OUTSIDE

      Nothing unusual.  The wind stirs the trees a bit.  A wind 
      chime blows...

      Norma feels a little unsettled.  Trying to convince herself 
      she s just scaring herself.  Turns to look out the glass door 
      one more time, just to reassure herself when -- 

      KEITH SUMMER S FACE APPEARS RIGHT THERE, about twelve inches 
      away from her.  Sheer horror.  She SCREAMS.  

      NOW -- SMASH!  KEITH S HAND WRAPPED IN A RAG PUNCHES THROUGH  
      A GLASS PANE.  

      He reaches in and UNLOCKS THE DOOR.  THROWS IT OPEN.  He s 
      inside now.  Norma SCREAMS OUT -- 

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Norman!

      But there is no answer.  Now Keith starts across the room 
      toward her.  He is wearing the same dirty clothes and an old 
      leather POLICE BELT COMPLETE WITH HANDCUFFS and FLASHLIGHT.                                                                                      37.


      In his hand he s carrying a roll of DUCT TAPE and a BOX 
      CUTTER.  

      Norma spins around, looking for help, grabs a KNIFE from the 
      wood block on the counter.  She starts SLASHING AT HIM, but 
      he moves surprisingly well, DODGING HER. 

      WHOOSH.  She SLASHES again at empty air.  And as the knife 
      swings by, Keith rears back and KICKS HER IN THE STOMACH -- 
      sending Norma FLYING ACROSS THE FLOOR IN A HEAP.  

      The Knife skitters away.  She s on the ground, HURT.  Keith 
      unpeels a strip of DUCT TAPE and advances on her as she tries 
      to get up --

                                  NORMA LOUISE (CONT D)
                    Norman!  Norman... Norman!

      But no one comes.  Keith kneels over the top of her.  She 
      punches at him, trying to fight him off.  He SLICES HER with 
      the box cutter, causing her to retract her hand in pain.  Her 
      hand is now bleeding badly.  

      Keith cuts off a piece of DUCT TAPE and covers her mouth. 

      Now Keith HARSHLY TURNS HER OVER. Removes the handcuffs from 
      his belt.  Fastens them on her.   He picks her up by the 
      waist and throws her over the kitchen table. 

      Norma SCREAMS and STRUGGLES to no avail.  He throws up her 
      skirt and uses the BOX CUTTER to cuts her panties off.  

      He unbuckles his pants, leans over her and presses his sweaty 
      mouth right up into her ear -- 

                                  KEITH
                    This is my house.  And what s in 
                    this house is mine.

      STAY CLOSE ON NORMA

      Keith starts RAPING HER.  His hand PRESSES THE SIDE OF HER 
      FACE FLAT INTO THE TABLE, next to a plate of cookies.   

      CLOSE ON NORMA as she tries to ENDURE THE RAPE, trying to 
      think of how she can get out of this, waiting for it to end, 
      helpless, angry, broken, when --

      THUNK.  Keith suddenly FALLS AWAY.  Norma turns to see --

      NORMAN                                                                                    38.


      Standing there, eyes wide, holding an ANTIQUE IRON DOORSTOP.  
      (He is sweating.  Breathing hard. This is from running home, 
      although Norma doesn t know this or notice at first.)  

      She stands up and her skirt falls down covering her.    
      Norman hurries over and pulls the duct tape from her mouth. 
      Norma is a flood of emotions, but all she can say is --

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Norman!  Where were you?  Why 
                    didn t you come?

      Norman doesn t know what to say.  Doesn t want to tell her. 

                                  KEITH
                      Aggnnnhhhnn...

      They spin around.  OH FUCK.  Keith is GROANING, coming to --  

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Quick!  Norman, the handcuffs.  He 
                    must have a key --

      Norman runs to Keith, fumbles around in the pockets of the 
      police belt.  SHIT.  SHIT...  He can t find anything.  

                                  NORMA LOUISE (CONT D)
                    Hurry!  Norman...

      Norman is sweating, shaking.  SEARCHING.  Finally -- 

                                  NORMAN
                    Found it.  

      He runs back over and tries unlocking his mother s wrists.  
      He s so nervous, he can t do it.  Meanwhile, Keith is MOANING 
      SOME MORE and STIRRING.  

      CLICK.  Norman finally unlocks one.  Norma grabs the key and 
      unlocks the other one.  Rushes to Keith.  Norma wrenches 
      Keith s arms behind his back.  Norman fumbles with the 
      handcuffs -- 

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Jesus, Norman, hurry --

                      NORMANNORMA LOUISE
      I m trying --
                                                  -- Give  em to me! *

      But Norman finally gets them on Keith -- CLINKS THEM SHUT.

      They catch their breaths, feeling a moment of relief.  Now 
      Norman notices Norma s hand is bleeding badly --                                                                                      39.


                                  NORMAN
                    Mom.  Your hand --

      She realizes how bad it is.

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Get the emergency kit.  It s in the 
                    bathroom cabinet --

      Norman takes off, leaving Norma alone.  Keith STIRS AGAIN.  
      This time LIFTING HIS HEAD --

                                  KEITH
                      Moffggnnggg --

      Keith suddenly realizes his hands are cuffed -- STRUGGLES 
      VIOLENTLY against them.   Norma is frozen.

      Now Keith turns his head, sees her, then looks for a way up.  
      He gets an idea and presses his back against the cabinet, 
      edges his way up.  Gets his knees underneath him.  

      Norma reacts in HORROR.  She backs up -- KICKING the knife 
      with her foot.  She bends down and picks it up as Keith -- 
      grunting hard -- works his way angrily TO HIS FEET --

                                  KEITH (CONT D)
                    You stupid bitch -- 


      CLOSE ON NORMA

      Her face telling a story.  A lifetime of fear, of people 
      fucking her over, of crazy shit intruding on her life that 
      she didn t ask for.  Too much, too much, too much...

      Norma CHARGES HIM.  STABS HIM.  Then STABS HIM AGAIN.  AND 
      AGAIN.  AND ONCE MORE.  Now he slumps to the floor.  DEAD.

      But it doesn t matter, she drops to her knees over him and 
      STABS HIM AGAIN.  And again.  And again.  She can t stop,  
      She s so fucking mad as --

      A POOL OF BLOOD spills out of him, quickly becoming a LAKE.  
      She s standing in it.  Doesn t care.  She keeps stabbing him.  

                                  NORMAN 
                    Mother!

      CAMERA FINDS Norman stands in the doorway holding the 
      emergency kit.  Eyes wide.  WHAT THE FUCK?

      INT. BATES HOUSE/KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

      CLOSE ON NORMAN S HAND PICKING UP THE PHONE

      ...as his mother s BLOODY HAND grabs the phone away...

      NORMAN looks at his Mom who is trying to catch her breath but 
      is emotionally all over the place. 

                                  NORMAN
                    We have to call 911 --

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    We re not calling 911!  Not an 
                    option --

                                  NORMAN
                    He attacked you!  
                          (looks at lake of blood; 
                          not sure this is true)
                    It was self defense! 
                          (then; hoping)
                    It was self-defense, wasn t it --

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                          (while frantically 
                            wrapping her cut)
                    Norman.  No matter what.  This will 
                    become public.  It will get in the 
                    papers.  Everyone in town will know 
                    it. Who is going to want to go book 
                    a room in the rape-slash-murder 
                    motel?  It s going to ruin us.  And 
                    make me a laughing stock --
                          (she takes him by the 
                            shoulder; leans in)
                    We came here to start over.  
                          (yelling; losing it)
                    And I m (fucking) starting over!
                          (then)
                    And where the hell were you, 
                    Norman?  

                                  NORMAN
                          (lying)
                    I was upstairs.

                                  NORMA LOUIS
                          (crazed at this point; 
                            unhinged)
                    You were NOT upstairs!  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    41.

                                  NORMA LOUIS (CONT'D)
                    You would have come down and helped 
                    me!  Where the hell were you?  Why 
                    are there sweat stains under your 
                    arms?  What is going on?  

                                  NORMAN
                    I snuck out of my room and went to 
                    a party --

      Norma just looks at him for a long moment.  Can t believe it. 
      Finally...

                                  NORMA LOUIS
                    Oh my God.  Who are you?  Who the 
                    hell are you?  You did what?

                                  NORMAN
                          (bursting)
                    Mom! I thought I was going to study 
                    with them but they took me to a 
                    party.  I didn t know.  It hardly 
                    matters right now!  There s a dead 
                    man on the floor! There s a lake of 
                    blood! What are we supposed to do?  
                    Clean this up with paper towels and 
                    some 409? I don t think so.  Holy 
                    hell, Mother!  We are totally 
                    screwed!  What are we doing?  We 
                    don t know what we re doing! -- 

      Norman is so overwhelmed he starts losing it.  This alarms 
      Norma, almost as if it is reminding her of some medical 
      condition she needs to be thoughtful of with him.  She 
      catches her breath.  Calms down...

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Norman, listen to me. It s going to 
                    be okay. Here s what we re going to 
                    do.  We re going to go get all the 
                    bedding from every motel room and 
                    use it to soak this up.  We re 
                    going to take the body and wrap it 
                    in one of the comforters --

      Norman listens, starting to calm down.  

                                  NORMAN
                    Then we ll -- dump it somewhere 
                    tonight?

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    No.  That s the kind of thing that 
                    gets you caught.

                                  NORMA LOUISE (CONT'D)
                    We have to be thoughtful about how 
                    to get rid of the body.  But we 
                    will have to dump all the bed 
                    linens somewhere.  We ll have to 
                    drive tonight to some deserted 
                    parking lot in some deserted town 
                    and stuff it all in the bottom of a 
                    dumpster.  
                          (thinking; then)
                    We ll wrap the body and put it in a 
                    tub in one of the motel rooms until 
                    I can figure out what to do with it 
                    tomorrow --
                          (then; seeing how scared 
                          he is)
                    I m sorry, Norman.  I m sorry you 
                    have to be in the middle of this.  
                    I m sorry this asshole raped me.  
                    But here you are.  And here I am.  
                    And he s not going to win this one.

      SLOW MOTION AS A CLEAN BED COVER IS THROWN OVER THE BLOOD.  
      It BILLOWS UP THEN LANDS SOFTLY. The BLOOD SEEPS IN SLOWLY, 
      BLOSSOMING AGAINST THE WHITE, spreading and spreading...

      RESUME NORMAL SPEED as NORMA AND NORMAN reach in on opposite 
      ends and pull up the dripping, bloody cover.  It s heavy.  
      They carry it to a PILE OF BLOODY COVERS.  

                                  NORMAN
                    We re never going to get this all 
                    up.  It just keeps reappearing.  

      Norma throws another blanket over the blood.  And another.  
      And another.  A woman on a mission.  Almost manic --

      She gets on her hands and knees and starts wiping the blood 
      up.  Pushing the heavy, blood soaked blankets toward the 
      pile.  

                                  NORMAN
                    Mother, are you sure we shouldn t

      SAME - LATER

      The blood is now off the floor except for some smudges.  
      There is a MOUNTAIN of trash bags.  Norma and Norman are on 
      their hands and knees, awkwardly ROLLING KEITH SUMMERS  BODY 
      into a comforter.  (They have stuffed about six inches of 
      condensed paper towels inside his shirt to absorb any 
      remaining blood.) It s starting to soak through.  They are 
      covered with blood.  They finally succeed in rolling him up.  
      Norma looks at their clothes.  She washes her hands quickly.  
      Takes some clothes from the top of a clean laundry basket.  
      Tosses some to Norman.

                    Wash up a little. Put these on. Put 
                    the bloody clothes in one of the 
                    trash bags.

      She also changes.  She barely bothers to turn around.  Maybe 
      it s just the intense terror of the moment.  But it s a 
      little awkward for Norman, who turns away.  

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. MOTEL PORCH/WALKWAY - MINUTES LATER

      Norma and Norman, rigid with tension, struggle to carry the 
      dead weight of the body to one of the rooms.  It s incredibly 
      heavy and cumbersome. They are both sweating.  (Norman is 
      walking forward and Norma is walking backwards. The following 
      dialogue is said through heavy breathing and straining 
      muscles.  This is REALLY PHYSICALLY DEMANDING.)   They 
      whisper loudly and with agitation --

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Don t go so fast!  I can t walk 
                    that fast backwards --

                                  NORMAN
                    It s heavy.  I just want to get it 
                    in the tub.  I m afraid I m going 
                    to drop it --                                                                                    44.


                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Well you are going to drop it if I 
                    fall over because you re walking to 
                    fast!  
                          (noticing)
                    Hell.  The blood is soaking through 
                    again --

                                  NORMAN
                    That s why I m hurrying --

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Just -- be quiet.  Here, number 
                    four is open --

      She backs into room #4.  


      INT. ROOM #4 - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      As they carry the body across the threshold and into the dark 
      room with great effort.  Norman, exhausted, catches the top 
      of his shoe in the doorjamb and topples forward.  The blanket 
      unfurls and the body falls from it, THUDDING to the floor, 
      ROLLING OVER on the CARPET and COVERING it with BLOOD.  

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Jesus, Norman! 

      Norman picks himself up.  Quickly picks up his end of the 
      body.  The blood is oozing out into the CARPET --

                                  NORMAN
                    How can there still be more blood?! 

      But it s too late.  When they move the body they see the  
      HUGE BLOOD STAIN covering the center of the room.  Fuck.

      They stand there and look at it a moment.  Despondent. 
      Then...

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                          (re: body)
                    Get him in the tub first.  Then 
                    we ll figure everything else out --


      INT. ROOM #4 BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      The body is dropped in the tub.  THUNK.  FIND Norma and 
      Norman, catching their breath.  They just stare down at the 
      wrapped body for a long moment, blood still soaking through.  
      It s all so horrifying.  After a long beat, Norman looks at 
      his Mom.  Sort of pleading.                                                                                      45.


                                  NORMAN
                          (how are we going to live 
                            with this?)
                    Mom, what are we going to do?

      She looks at Norman, worried.  Looks at the body.  Gets that 
      he s asking a larger, philosophical question.  But, fuck.  
      She has no answer. She has no idea how they re going to live 
      with this secret.  So she goes to the only thing she can 
      control in the moment.  

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    We re going to deal with the rug.

      She starts to leave, then on a last instinct, reaches back 
      and CLOSES the SHOWER CURTAIN.


      INT. ROOM #4 - MAIN ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      There is now one small table lamp on in the room.  Norma and 
      Norman stand over the blood stain, staring at it.  Then...

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    We re going to have to pull up the 
                    whole carpet --

                                  NORMAN
                    Tonight?  It s already midnight --

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    And not just this one.  We re going 
                    to have to pull up 4 through 7 -- 
                    they all have the same carpet.  
                    That way if this creep goes 
                     missing  and anyone comes and 
                    starts asking us questions, nothing 
                    will be out of the ordinary here.  
                    We re just doing renovations.  Re-
                    carpeting --

                                  NORMAN
                    How the hell do you pull up 
                      carpeting?  


      INT. ROOM #4 - LATER

      Norman, exhausted and dazed, now alone, kneels on the floor 
      prying up carpet tacks with a flathead screwdriver.  With 
      great effort he takes a corner of the pried up carpet and 
      starts RIPPING.  It s physically hard.   FIND...

      A SMALL NOTEBOOK                                                                                    46.


      Pocket size.  Dog-eared.  Apparently, at one time, stuffed 
      under the carpeting for some reason...  

      NORMAN picks it up, curious.  OPENS IT...

      NORMAN S POV  -- The  book  is a type of hand-drawn manga  --
      panels (one per page -- it s small) with bubble captions, in 
      Chinese, telling a story.  It s rough and sketchy, but still 
      the art is compelling and disturbing.  We see IMAGES OF 
      YOUNG, ASIAN GIRLS - maybe fifteen years old -- in various 
      states of  sexual slavery  (ie: manacled to a wall, held at 
      gunpoint on a bed, being shot up, etc.)  

      CLOSE ON NORMAN --- flips through it quickly, fascinated, 
      then --

      THE SWEEPING LIGHTS OF AN APPROACHING CAR FILL THE ROOM.  
      STARTLED HE LOOKS UP.  FREEZES.  HOLY CRAP -- He quickly 
      tucks the book away --


      EXT. MOTEL DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

      A COP CAR pulls up.  Nearby, we see Norma s car -- rolled up 
      carpeting sticking out of all the windows.


      INT.  ROOM #5 - CONTINUOUS

      Norma, also on the floor pulling up carpeting, is now frozen.  
      Heart thumping.  Sees the lights.  She looks out the window 
      and sees it s a cop car.  Holy God.  Stay calm.  Stay calm --


      EXT. MOTEL PORCH/WALKWAY - MOMENTS LATER

      Two cops exit the car. One, SHERIFF ROYCE ROMERO (45), dark 
      and edgy.  Eyes that see everything.  Nothing in his face 
      that let s you off the hook.  About anything.  Ever.  
      Something almost sinister about him.  With him, DEPUTY ZACK 
      SHELBY (35).  Shelby is a nice looking guy, compassionate 
      eyes.  A  likability  to him. They are both glancing in the 
      car with the rolled up carpets when Norma appears on the 
      porch, all smiles.

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Good evening, Gentlemen.  I was 
                    about to tell you we re not open 
                    for business yet but I m guessing 
                    you re not looking for a room --

      She walks to them and extends her hand.  Charming.                                                                                    47.


                                  NORMA LOUISE (CONT D)
                    Norma Bates.  We just moved in a 
                    few days ago.

      Shelby takes her hand.  Smiles.  Makes total eye contact with 
      her.  Clearly finds her attractive.  (She sees this and works 
      it.  All very subtle.)  

                                  SHELBY
                    No, not looking for a room tonight.  
                          (introducing)
                    Deputy Zack Shelby.  This is 
                    Sheriff Royce Romero.

      Romero just nods.  Barely.  

                                  ROMERO
                    We wanted to make sure everything 
                    was alright here.  We didn t know 
                    anyone had moved in yet and we saw 
                    the lights on.  

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    That s so kind of you.  But, yes, 
                    we re all fine.  My son and I are 
                    just working a little late.  
                    Pulling up some carpeting we re 
                      replacing.  Doing some updating.  
                    God knows it could use it --

      Shelby smiles.  Romero is blank.  Then...

                                  ROMERO
                    You have a son?

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Yes, my son Norman.  He s 16.

      A silent moment, then...

                                  ROMERO
                    Norma and Norman.  That s -- 
                    unusual. 

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Boys take their father s name all 
                    the time --

                                  ROMERO
                          (but that makes sense)
                    Yeah.
                          (then)
                    You know it s almost two in the 
                    morning?  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    48.

                                  ROMERO (CONT'D)
                    Your son has school tomorrow.  You 
                    really think this is a good idea to 
                    have him up doing remodeling for 
                    you at this hour?

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Gosh is it that late already?  I 
                    had no idea.  Thank you so  much 
                    for telling me.  I ll go close up 
                    shop right now.  Thanks for coming 
                    by --

      She starts walking off, her back to them.  WE ARE FACING HER - 
      the terror seeping through her face -- the prayer that they 
      are leaving now.  JUST KEEP WALKING.  KEEP WALKING.  YOU LL 
      HEAR THE ENGINE START ANY SECOND -- 

                                  ROMERO
                    Mrs. Bates?

      Her face falls.  Her heart starts THUMPING.  She turns, 
        transformed, a sweet smile --

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Yes, Sheriff?

                                  ROMERO
                    You wouldn t mind if we take a look 
                    inside, would you?

      ON NORMA.  HOLY FUCK.  

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                          (smiles)
                    Not at all.  

                                                                          SMASH TO:


      INT. ROOM #4 - MAIN ROOM

      NORMAN S POV - FROM THE FLOOR as the door opens and Romero 
      and Shelby walk in, followed by Norma, who makes instant eye 
      contact with him.  Her eyes saying  Be careful.  Take my 
      lead. 

      ON THE BATHROOM DOOR

      Slightly ajar.  The presence of the dead body hangs over the 
      room...

      ON NORMAN                                                                                    49.


      As terrified as he s ever been in his life.  Hoping they 
      can t hear his heart thumping out of his chest.  He stands 
      up, very polite.  He s not as good at faking it as his mom.  
      He looks a little bit like a deer caught in the headlights 
      who s trying to act like everything s cool. 

                                  NORMAN
                    Evening.

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Norman this is Sheriff Romero and 
                    Deputy Shelby.  They saw the lights 
                    on and were kind enough to stop by 
                    and check on us.  

                                  NORMAN
                    Thank you.  Thank you.  That s 
                    extremely -- good -- of you. We re 
                    all good here.  Everything s fine.  
                    Except for this carpeting --

      Romero studies him, finds him peculiar, but nods with minimal 
      politeness.  Shelby shakes his hand.  Gets that he s nervous.  
      Smiles at him to reassure him.

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Sheriff Romero wanted to see what 
                    we re doing with the place.  I 
                    guess you re a little interested in 
                    design?

                                  ROMERO
                      I wouldn t put it that way.

      He is on his own agenda.  Taking everything in.  Checking out 
      the vibe.  Senses tension but isn t sure why.  Just keeps 
      looking at everything while Norma babbles --

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Well, it s a rare man that is.  I 
                    know nothing bored my late husband 
                    more, may he rest in peace --

                                  ROMERO
                    You re a widow?  I m so sorry --

      But he doesn t look so sorry.  Norma smiles at him, sadly...

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Six months ago.  We re trying to 
                    get used to it.
                          (then;  the brave widow )
                    Anyway, onward.  Redesign --                                                                                    50.


                                  ROMERO
                          (not going to stand around 
                          and talk design)
                    Can I use the bathroom?

      Norma and Norman want to vomit.  A tiny beat, then...

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    This bathroom?  This bathroom is 
                    broken --

                                  ROMERO
                    What s wrong with it?

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    It s not flushing.

                                  ROMERO
                    All these toilets do that.  I told 
                    Summers he needed to replace them 
                    ten years ago.  You ve got to 
                    jiggle the chain --

      Norma is frozen.  FUCK!  What should I do!  What can I do? 
      And he knows Keith Summers! Fuck! 

                                  ROMERO (CONT D)
                    I ll take a look at it. 

      And HE WALKS IN THE BATHROOM.  Norma and Norman can barely 
      breathe but they have to try and look normal.  We HEAR ROMERO 
      start peeing in the BG.  Romero, a little embarrassed, looks 
      at Norma --

                                  SHELBY
                    Nice night. 

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                          (barely able to get words 
                            out)
                    Yes.

      The peeing continues.  And continues.  This is the longest 
      fucking pee in the world.  Shelby takes Norma and Norman s 
      discomfort to be some kind of gentility.  He smiles, trying 
      to divert their attention.  THE MOST TENSE SMALL TALK IN THE 
      HISTORY OF SMALL TALK --

                                  SHELBY
                    So where are you from?

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Arizona.  Outside of Scottsdale.                                                                                      51.


                                  SHELBY
                    Oh!  I was in Arizona once.  
                          (awkward silence)
                    Well I drove through it.  It was at 
                    night.  Very pretty.  You could 
                    smell the sage --
                          (more silence; just trying 
                          to keep it going)
                    The air at night there is like 
                    nothing I ve ever felt anywhere --

      The peeing continues.  Norma and Norman are dying a slow 
      death.  Waiting for the moment to come when Romero sees the 
      body.  Waiting...

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Yes, the air at night is lovely in 
                    Arizona.

      Silence, them...

                                  NORMAN
                    The air here at night is nice too.

      Silence, then...

                                  SHELBY
                    Yes.  It is.  Very nice.

      And finally, blessedly, the peeing stops.  We HEAR the toilet 
      handle jiggling.  Then FLUSHING.  Romero steps out. 

                                  ROMERO
                    You just need to jiggle it.  

      Norma and Norman can t believe it. He didn t fucking see the 
      body -- Romero s WALKIE TALKIE starts --

                                  MAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                    ...Unit 1, multiple vehicle 
                    collision on highway 101 at South 
                    Bay.  Multiple injuries...

      He motions  let s go  to Shelby.  They both nod to Norma.

                                  ROMERO
                    Evening, ma am.  Get the boy to 
                    bed.

      And miraculously, they are out the door. STAY ON THE FROZEN 
      NORMA AND NORMAN as they don t move, can t move, until they 
      HEAR THE ENGINE START UP AND SEE THE LIGHTS DRIVE AWAY.                                                                                    52.


      STAY ON MOTHER AND SON IN THE DIMLY LIT ROOM, just having 
      been handed their lives back.  Relief and exhaustion.  Norman 
      falls into the floor, just breathing.  A beat, then --

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                          (to spent to have any 
                            emotion in her voice - 
                            flat)
                    He didn t wash his hands. 

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK:

                                        END ACT THREE                                                                                    53.


                                          ACT FOUR


      INT. BATES HOUSE/NORMAN S ROOM - DAY

      Early the next morning.  Birds chirp cheerfully outside.  
      FIND NORMAN, asleep in his clothes, total exhaustion.  Passed 
      out.  NORMA S HAND REACHES INTO FRAME and shakes him firmly.

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Norman you have to wake up.  We 
                    have to get you to school and you 
                    have to be on time --

      Norman tries to catch up, still half asleep.  Remembers 
       there s a dead man in our tub .  It s kind of horrifying and 
      depressing.  The nightmare isn t over.

                                  NORMAN
                    Mother, I only slept like two 
                    hours.  I can t go to school --

                                  NORMA LOUISE 
                    Norman you have to go to school.  
                    I m tired too.  I drove two hours 
                    down to Fortuna to dump all that 
                    carpeting and bed linens. Sooner or 
                    later that guy is going to go 
                    missing and people are going to 
                    start asking questions.  Our 
                    behavior has to be COMPLETELY 
                    NORMAL AND CONSISTENT.  So get up 
                    and get ready.  We have to get 
                    through today like it s just 
                    another day.  We ll figure out 
                    tonight where to get rid of -- it.
                          (then)
                    Hurry up.  Breakfast is on the 
                    table.  

      She clips out of the room.  STAY ON NORMAN a beat, no idea 
      how he s going to get through this day.


      INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA - LATER

      Norman, in a living stress dream, stands in line for food at 
      the cafeteria.  Gets some food.  Looks for a table.  Sees 
      Bradley and her friends but just avoids her today.  He s too 
      upset.  Too exhausted.  Too strung out.  He takes his food 
      and quietly goes to a table in the corner.  Sits down.  Tries 
      to take a few bites.  It s not sitting well.  He pushes it 
      away.  Shit, it s REALLY not sitting well. He jumps out and 
      runs out --                                                                                    54.


      EXT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

      As Norman bursts through the cafeteria door, feeling food 
      coming back up his throat, feeling dizzy and hot, and needing 
      a place to hurl because it s happening, he leans over an open 
      trash can and starts puking.  Richard and some GUYS walk by 
      on their way in the cafeteria.  

                                    RICHARD
                    He s new.  He s not used to the 
                    food yet --

      Laughs/groans.  They disappear inside.  STAY ON NORMAN, done 
      but still leaning over the trash.  Humiliated.  Sick.  
      Disgusted.  In the middle of this reverie of self-loathing we 
      FIND...

      EMMA DECODY (15), cute and energetic.  Extremely bright.  
      Slim, athletic body.  Has a a subtle, girl-next-door sex 
      appeal to her, but maybe she s not to aware of it yet.  
      Something still childlike about her - or her perception of 
      herself.  Most notedly, she rolls a PORTABLE OXYGEN TANK 
      along with her and has the classic oxygen tube directly under 
      her nose.  Aside from that you would never know there was 
      anything wrong with her.   She looks at Norman, concerned...

                                  EMMA
                    Make sure you re done.  Don t try 
                    to cut it short just because it s 
                      embarrassing.  Get it all out or 
                    you will just have to do this 
                    again.

      Norman pulls his head out of the trash.  Sees this eccentric 
      girl standing there.  Cute, eccentric girl. 

                                  NORMAN
                    Um, I think I m done.  

      She opens a mint box from her large purse.  Offers him one.

                                  EMMA
                    Mint will calm your stomach.  

      He takes one.

                                  NORMAN
                    Thanks.

                                  EMMA
                    I m kind of an expert on vomiting.
                          (matter of fact; almost 
                            cheery)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    55.

                                  EMMA (CONT'D)
                    Yeah, I have CF so I ve been on 
                    meds my whole life.  Some of them 
                    give you any number of hideous side 
                    effects.  
                          (she laughs)
                    Puking being one of the more 
                    pleasant ones.  
                          (then)
                    Do you have some sort of chronic 
                    illness?

                                  NORMAN
                    No --

                                  EMMA
                          (slightly disappointed)
                    Oh. 
                          (then; shakes it off; 
                            smiles
                    I m Emma Decody.  

                                  NORMAN
                    Norman Bates.

                                  EMMA
                    Yeah, I think we have language arts 
                    together. 

      Awkward silence.  Then...

                                  EMMA (CONT D)
                    Well, I just wanted to make sure 
                    you were okay.
                          (she leans in; looking at 
                            him. concerned; sensing 
                            tension)
                    Are you okay?

      There s part of him that just wants to collapse.  Just tell 
      someone everything.  Admit he can t handle the pressure.  
      Give up.  Give in.  Give over.  But finally... 

                                  NORMAN
                          (lying)
                    I m okay.  

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


      INT. HARDWARE STORE - LATER

      Norma, exhausted, waits at the counter. The CLERK comes out 
      holding a small pane of glass for a french door window...                                                                                    56.


                                  CLERK
                    This should work.


      EXT. STORE - LATER

      Norma exits the store.  Takes a moment to look down the 
      street.  The town here is utterly charming and lovely.  She 
      looks at it, wistful.  This was not the  grand opening  she 
      wanted for her life in this place.  She glances down at her 
      cut hand.  Will I ever have a normal life?  Then her gaze 
      falls on...

      A POSTER announcing a town meeting to discuss the new HIGHWAY  
      101 BYPASS.  She looks closely at the MAP.  Her face falls...


      EXT. HARBOR - NIGHT

      OARS quietly lap through the dark water.  

      FIND Norman and Norma in a row boat.  Norman rows.  Norma 
      stares out into the night.  Keith s body lies on the bottom 
      of the boat, wrapped up in sheets and tied like a UPS 
      package.  Weighted down with bricks and pieces of sawn off 
      iron piping.  Very home made.

      Norma and Norman sits in tense silence.  Norman can tell 
      there is something up with his mom.  Can tell she s upset.  
      It makes him worry.  Finally --

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    I suck.

                                  NORMAN
                    Mom, he attacked you --

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    I m not even talking about him.  I 
                    found out today that the city is 
                    building a new bypass on the far 
                    side of town.  It s going to be the 
                    new  main road .  No one s even 
                    going to drive by our motel 
                    anymore.  No one s going to see it.  
                    I bought a motel no one is ever 
                    going to know is there --

                                  NORMAN
                    Why didn t the real estate guy tell 
                    you that?                                                                                    57.


                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Because people suck, Norman.  
                    Everyone I have ever known has 
                    sucked.  The whole world sucks.  
                          (then)
                    Except you.  

      She looks at him for a long moment, loving him so much.  
      Then...

                                  NORMA LOUISE (CONT D)
                    You re too good for me.  I m the 
                    worst mother in the world.  

                                  NORMAN
                    Mother --

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Look at what we re doing, 
                      Norman??!!!  You should be taken 
                    away from me.  I should turn myself 
                    in and put you up for adoption.  
                    There s something wrong with me --

      Norman stops rowing.  Kind of terrified.

                                  NORMAN
                    You re kidding, right?

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Look at the life I ve given you.  
                    You deserve so much better. When 
                    you were born it was like -- God 
                    gave me a second chance.  All I 
                    ever wanted was for everything to 
                    be beautiful for you.  And look at 
                    it.  Look at what your life has 
                    been.  What good am I doing you? 

      They little boat has stopped out in the middle of the vast 
      blackness.  Two small people in the middle of infinity.  
      Norman is upset.  

                                  NORMAN
                    Mom, you re everything.  Everything 
                    to me.  I don t ever want to live 
                    in a world without you.  You re my 
                    family.  My whole family. My whole 
                    life.  My whole  -- self.  You 
                    always have been.  It s like 
                    there s a cord between our hearts --                                                                                    58.


                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Honey, that s from JANE EYRE.  
                    Orson Wells says it to Joan 
                    Fontaine  --

                                  NORMAN
                    Oh, right. But you know what I 
                    mean.  It s you and me. It s always 
                    been you and me.  We belong to each 
                    other. 

      Norma just looks at her sweet son in the moonlight.  Moved.  

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    I love you, Norman.  You are the 
                    best thing that ever happened to 
                    me.

                                  NORMAN
                    I love you too, Mom.

      A beat as they just connect.  Heal.  Then after a moment, 
      Norma turns to the water...

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    I guess this is deep enough.

      And with great effort they hoist the body of Keith Summers 
      into the dark water.  As it splashes in, we...

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK:

                                          ACT FIVE


      EXT. MOTEL - DAY 

      CLOSE ON TRUCK WHEELS spinning in the gravel, getting no 
      traction.  HEAR THE ENGINE SURGE...

      FIND THE SEA FAIRER MOTEL SIGN attached to some chains at the 
      rear of a professional SIGN COMPANY truck. Then the truck 
      lurches forward and we see...

      THE SEA FAIRER SIGN CRASHES TO THE GROUND.  Dust and debris.  
      As the crew prepares to erect a NEW SIGN...

      FIND NORMA

      Watching.  Something about seeing this is purging.  It s 
      gone.  Keith Summers is gone.  On to the future...


      EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

      Norma goes outside.  Excited, flips the switch for the new 
      sign.  It lights up. (We see the light from it but do not see 
      the sign - we stay on Norma.) She looks at it, moved.  It has 
      great meaning to her.  She owns something.  Something in this 
      world belongs completely to her. 


      INT. NORMAN S ROOM - NIGHT

      Norman is flipping through that small notebook he found under 
      the rug.  He hides it under his mattress as he hears his 
      Mom s footsteps.  Norma bursts in without knocking.  She s 
      excited and happy.

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Come here!  I have a surprise for 
                    you --

      She grabs his hand and pulls him to the window.  

                                  NORMA LOUISE (CONT D)
                    Look, look, look.  I turned it on --

      NORMAN S POV - THE NEW BATES MOTEL SIGN

      Bright blue in the night sky.  The classic sign we know and 
      love.

                                  NORMA LOUISE (CONT D)
                    I made it blue -- your favorite 
                    color.                                                                                    60.


                                  NORMAN
                          (smiles)
                    It s cool, Mom.  

      She takes his hand.

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    It s ours, Norman.  It s our very 
                    own.  The past is the past and 
                    we ll never talk about it again.  
                    Ok?

      He looks at her.  She looks like a little girl.  Happy and 
      hopeful.  It s beautiful and heartbreaking all at once.

                                  NORMAN
                    Ok.

      She looks back out at the sign --

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    And you know what?  You know that 
                    new  bypass ?  They re not going to 
                    build it --

                                  NORMAN
                    When did that happen?

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                          (smiles a wicked smile)
                    It didn t.  Yet.

      The doorbell rings.  


      INT. FOYER

      As Norma opens the door to see her estranged son DYLAN.  
      Holding a duffel bag.  In all his moody glory.  She is 
      startled, and not happy to see him.  He gets this. He looks 
      her square in the eye.

                                  DYLAN
                          (fuck you, I found you)
                    Hi,  Mom ...

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK:
