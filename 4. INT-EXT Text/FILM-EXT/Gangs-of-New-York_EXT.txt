WINTER WIND blows across a scene as strange and bleak as an alien planet.
VALLON, carrying his cross high, steps through the doorway. The OTHERS
slowly follow VALLON out of the building, which is three stories high and
maybe a block long. A dilapidated sign identifies it as the 5 Paints
Brewery.
It is the tallest structure in the midst of low, squalid SHACKS, winding
ALLEYS as narrow as a snakels back, and DIRT STREETS filled with ruts, mud
and filthy snow. A few PIGS wander forlornly about, rooting for garbage.
WASH hangs stiff, in the middle of the square, from a peculiar monument
erected to some forgotten war hero.
The Brewery occupies one side of a SQUARE surrounded by some storefronts
and a couple of collapsed wooden sidewalks. If this place resembles
anything at all, it's a horrible hybrid of London's Limehouse and a
pioneer town in the American West whose best days have long passed--or
never came at all.
VALLON stands still, staring across the square past the monument. His
battalion of irregulars waits for his signal.
Now... very, very slowly...from around both sides of the monument comes
ANOTHER GANG, in size the same as VALLON's, men and women both, armed like
Visigoths with HOMEMADE WEAPONS: knives, pitchforks, building blocks and
bricks, boards with sharp nails protruding from the ends. Every member of
this second group is dressed in a long DUSTER which reaches to the ankles.
Several MEN in front of the group sport dusters made of leather.
VALLON
Bill Poole! on whose challenge are we assembled?
A MAN in a leather duster (BILL THE BUTCHER) steps forward. He is young,
lean and fierce. And then there are his eyes. They do not match. One is
real. The other is a huge, bulging PEARL upon which has been engraved,
instead of a pupil, a full-color portrait of the AMERICAN EAGLE.
On the side of the square, arranged to get a good view of the impending
combat, is a group of STREET KIDS, girls and boys, none older than eight.
They talk and laugh excitedly among themselves, picking their own
favorites among the gangs as if the warriors were players on a team.
BILL THE BUTCHER
On the challenge of the Native Americans, to settle for good and all who
holds sway.
VALLON
Bene.
BILL THE BUTCHER
By the ancient laws of combat, we offer our bodies to the ghosts of those
warriors who have gone before us. Valor is avid for glory, and glory is in
our wounds.
VALLON
But this time can you bear to look on the glory when it comes, Bill? Can
you see it clear with your single eye?
BILL THE BUTCHER
Whoever fights untouched in battle has skill, but the warrior who returns
wounded has been touched by God.
VALLON
It wasn't God who touched your eye.
BILL THE BUTCHER
It was God gave me guidance. Will you be able to look on the death blow
like a gladiator, and not look away? No honorable man turns an eye from
his death.
VALLON
I don't expect a death blow from your hand, Butcher. Let's have at it.
BILL THE BUTCHER
There is another matter.
VALLON
Say it out and quick, before spring gets here.
BILL THE BUTCHER
No Native American Warrior will dishonor himself with the blood of the
halt and maimed.
VALLON
So?
BILL THE BUTCHER
So we would like to know whether Squire Jack Mulraney of the Dead Rabbits
can smile out of both sides of his face.
A pause of a single second. Then HAPPY JACK takes the dead rabbit off the
tip of his pike and hurls it across the square. It lands right at BILL THE
BUTCHER's feet.
In a flash, BILL THE BUTCHER opens his coat. Inside, on a special belt he
carries a CLEAVER, a CARVING KNIFE and other instruments of the butcherls
trade, all stained with blood and gristle. Now the MAN standing next to
him removes the broad BELT from around his coat. The brass buckle is
sharpened to a point, the leather studded with glass.
The gallery of Street Kids tenses for action: they are thrilled.
VALLON reaches up to the CROSS, pulls off the top piece, to disclose,
underneath, a gleaming sword point. He folds the arms of the cross down,
like the blades of a jackknife.
VALLON
Prepare to receive the Lord.
And the air is full of screams and battle cries as the two gangs hurl
across Paradise Square into BATTLE.
VALLON draws first blood. He impales a Native American on the sword end of
his cross and turns to fight again.
Amsterdam and Shang exchange a glance of frightened, worried wonder.
Then a Native American rushes at them, shouting for blood. The boys act
together. Amsterdam dives down in front of the man, sending him sprawling.
Shang BLUDGEONS the fallen warrior, using his lead-filled rat like a
blackjack as Amsterdam kicks him savagely; the Native collapses
unconscicus at their feet. Before the boys can thank one another, however,
they are separaten by the SURGING GANGS all around them.
BILL THE BUTCHER leaves his meat CLEAVER imbedded in the middle of a man's
skull, then WADES through the combat as if shielded by a charm.
The gallery of Street Kids is thrilled by this display and reacts with
CHEERS.
VALLON BATTLES three Natives who come at him at once.
Monk Eastman grabs a Native in his arms like a groom hugging a bride. He
raises his knee and brings the man crashing down across it, BREAKING his
spine like a Thanksgiving wishbone.
The gallery of Street Kids is awed by this display of power from a new
star in the making.
The Rabbit Warrior in the home-made armor grins at an intrepid Native and
lowers his battle-axe. The Native rushes as the
Rabbit Warrior swings and SEPARATES the man from his legs.
A NATIVE WOMAN lowers her head and charges her Dead Rabbit adversary,
delivering a shattering BUTT to his stomach.
A NATIVE BOY holds a rusty old pistol, which he uses at pointblank range
against several Rabbits.
A RABBIT WOMAN flies into a Native, using her IRON FINGER EXTENSIONS to
GOUGE his face.
The NATIVE with the deadly belt uses it to TEAR a piece out of a Rabbit's
face.
Amsterdam, beginning now to be overwhelmed by the hellish fight, looks
around in growing PANIC for his father.
SHANG uses his lead-rat blackjack to clear an escape back toward the
Brewery. The Street Kids can tell he's trying to escape, and start BOOING
him...
... as Shang's GRABBED from behind and pulled off his feet by a PEG-LEGGED
NATIVE. He THROWS the boy to the ground and pins him by holding the
sword-sharp point of his wooden leg against Shang's throat.
SHANG
(desperate)
I run with you! I'm one of you! Born a Native American from the blood of
five generations!
PEG-LEG
Yeah? Then you oughta be a red Indian.
He pushes down. Shang starts to bleed. But now PEG LEG is distracted by
the sudden SOUND of bells and whistles. He watches the BOY trembling on
the ground, then moves off him, making for the sound of the bell, leaving
the BOY quaking.
The SOUND grows louder as TWO HORSE-DRAWN CARTS full of battle ready
POLICE tear around the curve of a narrow thoroughfare and stop in Paradise
Square.
The BELLS on the carts toll loudly and work magic. The fighting stops.
The POLICE, all carrying clubs and wearing leather helmets, LEAP OFF the
wagons.
There are several moments of ABSOLUTE SILENCE, broken only by the SOUND of
the wind and the GROANS of the wounded.
Then, as one, the Dead Rabbits and the Native Americans RUSH the police
together, hurtling stones and brandishing weapons. Even the Street Kids
get into the act, kicking and biting and generally having a fine time.
The gangs SWARM all over the police, driving them back. Some lucky cops
climb back on the wagons and try to get away. The unlucky police remain
behind, dead on the ground.
The GANGS cheer, jeer and continue to throw things at the retreating
POLICE. When the second wagon disappears from view, the GANGS confront
each other once again.
Another brief moment of QUIET. The Street Kids settle back into their
spectator role. Then the GANGS go at each other with fresh intensity.
Amsterdam finally SEES his father and starts to PUSH his way toward him.
VALLON and BILL THE BUTCHER stand facing each other in the midst of battle
like two titans: then they rush at each other, joining with a terrible
fury.
Shang, still blindly SWINGING his blackjack, makes his way closer to the
relative safety of the Brewery, his face stained with tears of fear. He
hits someone. The MAN turns, swats him down. Shang sprawls on the street,
which is a SWAMP of mud and blood and dirty snow, and finds himself face
to face with a departed PEG LEG. Someone has removed his artificial limb
and driven it through his heart.
Across the square, Amsterdam has reached his father in time to see a
NATIVE AMERICAN sneaking up behind him. Amsterdam grabs a long TRUNCHEON
from a fallen warrior and uses it to hit the man a strong blow behind the
knees.
The MAN falls, howling. AMSTERDAM HITS him again. And again. He is
hysterical.
VALLON and BILL THE BUTCHER keep fighting. Amsterdam sees, with a single
look, that his father is in the fight of his life. He looks for a weapon
to help...
... sees a HATCHET lying by the body of the Rabbit he has just beaten
senseless. He grabs it and runs forward, looking for an opening between
the Butcher and his father...
As the two combatants move, Amsterdam MOVES. Bobbing, weaving, feinting,
falling back... looking for his chance...
... as Bill deals VALLON a blow that ROCKS him back and throws him off
balance...
...just as Amsterdam has made his move. He RUSHES forward, sees his father
FALLING, tries to turn but...
... too late. The boy's hatchet SLASHES his father in the leg. VALLON
falls to one knee, gestures frantically to the stunned Amsterdam to get
away...
... and Bill is upon VALLON, SINKING his knife into his chest. VALLON
screams and falls on his back, Bill kneeling over him. He looks into his
enemy's eyes ... and VALLON's EYES LOCK ON HIS. For all his suffering,
VALLON's eyes HOLD Bill ... he forces himself to look at Bill...it's a
terrible struggle... but VALLON will not look away.
Amsterdam, hysterical, RUSHES at the Butcher. The Butcher grabs Amsterdam
by the arm, making him drop his hatchet.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You need a weapon? Use a knife.
He puts the struggling boy's hand on the hilt of the knife that the
Butcher sunk into his father's chest.
BILL THE BUTCHER
It makes a deeper cut.
And, HIS HAND GUIDING THE BOY'S, he RAMS his knife deep into VALLON's
heart.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Say a benediction, Priest.
VALLON bellows in agony. Amsterdam screams at the very same moment, his
cry mingling with his fatherls tearing through the air.
BILL THE BUTCHER
(to Amsterdam)
Hold this close to mind, boy, should you ever think of going up against
the Native Americans.
Bill the Butcher rises and all around him, as if on some mysterious
signal, the fighting subsides. A DEAD RABBIT sees the fallen Vallon, takes
a battered brass HORN from his belt and sounds THREE NOTES, quick and
sharp. As the notes fade away, the fighting stops completely.
BILL THE BUTCHER
(announcing)
Ears and noses will be trophies of the day.
The Rabbits SCAMPER to collect their dead and wounded before the Natives
can get to them to slice off the battle souvenirs. But there are many
corpses maimed. The Street Kids DISPERSE. The main battle is over, and the
Natives have clearly carried the day.
The Rabbits file past Vallon, rorming a protective CIRCLE around him.
Amsterdam kneels at his side. Vallon tries to speak. Blood bubbles in his
throat.
VALLON
Can't..can't cross the river... with steel through my heart.
Amsterdam looks around. None of the Rabbits makes a move. This is clearly
something he is meant to do himself.
Amsterdam grabs the tortoise handle of the knife, PULLS on it. Vallon
tries not to cry out. The knife does not move.
Amsterdam tries again. He can't budge the knife. Vallon MOANS. Nearly
wild, Amsterdam PULLS with all his strength. Vallon SCREAMS in agony.
Amsterdam is pulling so hard he raises his father's back four inches off
the ground. Still the knife will not move. Vallon passes out from the pain.
Now, finally, someone steps forward: Monk Eastman. He leans over but
Amsterdam, berserk with grief, pushes him away, turns back to his father,
and, with a last desperate pull, DRAWS the knife from his father's heart.
He throws it on the ground. Monk picks it up, wipes the blade on his arm,
closes the knife and hands it to Amsterdam.
MONK
That's yours, rightfully.
Now Monk leans over the lifeless body and reaches inside Vallon's coat,
REMOVING some money.
MONK
And this is mine. Only what's owed. Use the rest for funeral.
AMSTERDAM
No!
He tries to shove Monk away from his father, when the Native Warrior
intervenes.
HAPPY JACK
It's fair.
Amsterdam, wild with shock and grief, turns back to his father as Monk
takes what's owed him. Amsterdam bends over to KISS Vallon on both cheeks,
then on his left eye.
The boy is just about to kiss his fatheros closed right eye when the lid
springs OPEN - Amsterdam jumps back despite himself. Vallon stares at him:
a last moment of recognition.
VALLON
Hon ...
AMSTERDAM
No, Pa!
VALLON
... honor me... think of me ... don't never look away.
Vallon convulses and DIES. Amsterdam shakes him to revive him.
RABBIT WOMAN
Take the body. Bring the boy.
Several RABBITS take a step or two forward, but Amsterdam springs up at
them, like an animal.
RABBIT WARRIOR
Come an, lad. Therels nothing to be done now.
AMSTERDAM
Get away! Get away!
HAPPY JACK
Leave him be. He's his to mourn.
And the RABBITS turn away, going back to the Old Brewery or vanishing down
the narrow streets.
Now a few CITIZENS venture out into Paradise square. A couple of
SCAVENGERS scoot about, looting bodies.
Amsterdam stays in the center of the square unmoving, undisturbed, keeping
solitary vigil over his father.
A TITLE is superimposed across this scene:
NEW YORK CITY 1844
The same afternoon. As the sun goes down, we have our first full look
(MATTE) at the low pale outlines of the city.
The harbor is crowded with the high masts of sailing ships. Just north of
the island tip is the steeple of the city's tallest structure, Trinity
Church. The buildings of Wall Street are masses of concrete and wood, the
streets surrounding them paved with cobblestones. Just above the financial
district are the sloping buildings and rutted avenue of the Five Points .
The Old Brewery stands tall and forbidding over Paradise Square.
Above the Five Points, in the distance, we can glimpse some finer, newer
buildings. One wide street--Broadway--seems to run from the very tip of
the island clear up into the woods just a few miles north of the harbor.
The only SOUNDS are the lapping of the harbor water against the boats, the
creaking of masts in the winter WIND.
CUT TO
A closer view - The TITLE fades off. We see an imposing edifice on the
edge of the harbor with a wooden sign identifying: "IMMIGRATION
DEPARTMENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA."
The sun has nearly set. A boy--about 10 years old--sits on the edge of the
Castle Garden dock, gazing down at the frozen Hudson. He can just about
make out his reflection in the dull sheen of the ice. His name is JOHNNY
SIROCCO, and he watches himself with bewildered seriousness.
Abruptly, he reaches down and SMASHES through the ice with his fist. In
SLOW MOTION, we watch the ice fragments drift apart in the river current,
each bearing away a REFLECTION of Johnnyls face, like pieces of a puzzle.
POLICEMAN
Where's your family, sonny?
Johnny sees a POLICEMAN scrutinizing him.
JOHNNY
(lilting brogue)
My mother's just there.
He gestures toward a ship, where MEN are unloading cargo. In a hoist, they
are lowering a thin pine COFFIN to dockside.
JOHNNY
On the trip, her insides all broke up. She wasn't dead and there was three
others fighting for her bed.
POLICEMAN
And your father? Where's he, then?
JOHNNY
I never knew him.
POLICEMAN
(taking Johnny's hand)
We better see to you, then.
CUT TO
The Policeman leads an awed Johnny through the TEEMING streets of the Five
Points.
POLICEMAN
Where all those streets come together right ahead is the true Five Points.
But most speak of the Five Points and mean anywhere between the Battery
and the Bowery.
Although the night's cold, the streets are jammed. WHORES painted like
carnival Gypsies sell themselves to any man sober enough to stand up.
SOUNDS of laughter and combat filter out from garish SALOONS like the
Little Naples, the Hell Hole, the Egyptian Hall.
In the midst of all this highlife are BEGGARS and the SICKLY, looking for
charity, scrounging garbage in the street. An INDIGENT battles a CRIPPLE
for a meager scrap of faod. A richly dressed WOMAN, riding by in a
carriage, hides her eyes by raising a HUGE BOUQUET OF FLOWERS in front of
her face.
POLICEMAN
Streets hereabouts are lively of an evening. The city comes here to sport.
But there's places to put up a boy on his own.
Three WOMEN, exquisitely costed, burst from the door of the Egyptian Hall.
Under the harsh glare of a nearby gas lamp, their faces are no longer
striking. Johnny STARES; there is something not right about these faces.
JOHNNY
And those? What are those?
POLICEMAN
Well, those. Those are, as you might say, a sort of...
We SEE one of the women's faces, suddenly harsh under gaslight: under
thickly caked make-up is a smiling TRANSVESTITE.
POLICEMAN
... sort of whatnot.
TRANSVESTITE
Say, policeman. I'll buy your bonny friend.
The Policeman fetches the Transvestite a strong WHACK with his nightstick.
The Transvestite screams and falls ... and Johnny RUNS.
POLICEMAN
Hey!
But Johnny's off, already lost in the mad street life.
CUT TO
A grey day. Amsterdam stops in front of a window. He STRUGGLES with his
scarf, trying to keep himself warm. His eye strays for a moment, and he
sees he is outside Mr. Cornelius' Establishment. Then he NOTICES something
else....
.... his FATHER, propped up in a coffin, on public display. There is a
large sign beside the body: "The Dead End of Lawlessness. Tammany Abhors
Crime. Tammany Means Justice."
A sizeable CROWD is goggling at the body. Amsterdam BULLS his way through
the people to the street. He looks in the gutter, then looks up quickly.
Someone is watching him: Johnny. He's carrying an armful of wood.
JOHNNY
Firewood?
Amsterdam grabs the longest plank Johnny has.
JOHNNY
It's a penny the load.
AMSTERDAM
Later.
He turns with the plank in his hand and starts to RUN back through the
crowd.
JOHNNY
Hey!
Johnny manages to GRAB the other end of the plank. But Amsterdam's so
strong he YANKS him right along. The Crowd YELLS as it parts for
Amsterdam, who CHARGES through using the plank like a battering ram, with
Johnny on the far end, born along by stubbornness and momentum...
... toward Mr. Cornelius' window. Amsterdam SHATTERS the window and the
Crowd SCATTERS in a blizzard of GLASS.
Amsterdam stumbles into the window and against the coffin, which falls
over, spilling Vallon's BODY, knocking the boy over. Amsterdam picks
himself up as Johnny stands frozen.
AMSTERDAM
Help me.
He starts to pull his fatherls body from the window.
AMSTERDAM
Come on! Help me, goddamn it!
In a daze, Johnny steps forward and HELPS Amsterdam pulls the body onto
the street.
Now: the SOUND of WHISTLES and WHEELS and RUNNING HORSES as a wagon full
of POLICE arrives on the scene. Behind them, the Crowd returns, yelling
insults.
The police RUN toward the window. Mr. Cornelius dithers at the front of
the crowd.
Amsterdam and Johnny exchange a look. Then Johnny RUNS for it. Amsterdam
stays with the body...
... as the cops close in, SWINGING clubs. Amsterdam's grabbed and hit a
couple of times. The Crowd yells. A COP swings his arm back to give
Amsterdam a good wallop...
... and someone grabs his arm: Bill The Butcher.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Easy, crusher. What's this all about?
CRUSHER
Ask the boy.
AMSTERDAM
I paid Cornelius for my father to rest in honor. He told me I had to wait
on a permit, but he only wanted time to...
BILL picks up the Tammany sign from the ground.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Make another Arrangement, looks like. For advertising.
(to cop)
Better go along. I'll see to all this.
COP
The boy...
BILL THE BUTCHER
Take the little malefactor.
The Cops YANK the wildly flailing Amsterdam to his feet and DRAG him off
to their wagon. Bill The Butcher approaches Cornelius.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Give the boy what he paid for.
CUT TO
Amsterdam is HURLED into the police wagon. The door is locked behind him.
He pulls himselt to his feet, looks out the tiny barred window, SEES ...
... Dead Rabbits join up in a rough funeral procession. SEVERAL help LOAD
Vallon's body back into the coffin and place it onto Mr. Cornelius' fancy
funeral wagon. Monk Eastman LEAPS up onto the wagon and closes the coffin
lid tight.
There are PEDDLERS everywhere. One dispenses drinks from a portable
samovar. A SAILOR hawks ships in a bottle, repeatedly shouting the same
advertisement: "Encourage the work of a landswamped sailor!" A SILHOUETTE
ARTIST offers to draw portraits of passersby.
Funeral music is furnished by STREET MUSICIANS: a drummer, a fiddle
player, and a horn player, with a couple of BUSKERS performing along side
for good measure.
Mr. Cornelius takes the wagon reins and guides the horses out of the
square. The gang FOLLOWS solemnly behind.
And across the square, the police wagon carrying Amsterdam starts MOVING
OFF in the opposite direction. He keeps looking out the tiny wagon window.
The funeral procession leaves the square and activity returns quickly to
normal. Peddlers' CRIES once again fill the air. The Buskers start PLAYING
a snappier tune. SNOW begins to fall.
CUT TO
18 INT- TOMBS DAY
A huge, awful prison building modeled on an Egyptian mausoleum.
Amsterdam--trying to hide his growing fear--waits on line with other
PRISONERS, all of them older than he.
At the head of the line, prisoners are being processed by a JAILER and a
couple of COPS. Each prisoner is asked several cursory questions, then
told to strip. Every one of the men is SCARRED in some way.
AMSTERDAM nears the front of the line. The MAN just ahead of him
undresses. His left buttock is missing, and his back is covered with whip
scars. A PRISONER behind Amsterdam WHISPERS loud enough for Amsterdam to
hear...
PRISONER
Ain't his first Tombs trip.
ANSTERDAM steps up to the desk. The JAILER hardly takes notice of him.
JAILER
What do they call you?
And this is the first time in the film we have heard his name.
AMSTERDAM
Amsterdam.
The JAILER looks him over.
JAILER
Your full name.
AMSTERDAM
Vallon.
The JAILER writes this down with a scratchy pen.
JAILER
First name?
AMSTERDAM
I told you.
JAILER
(skeptical, resigned)
Address?
AMSTERDAM
Got none.
JAILER
I'll put city. Now what's your age?
(Amsterdam shrugs.)
Maybe twelve. Got a family?
AMSTERDAM
No more.
JAILER
Well, where was they from when you had one?
AMSTERDAM
(beat)
City.
JAILER
(writing)
Disrobe.
As Amsterdam obeys, the Jailer turns to the Cop in the leather helmet
standing at his side.
JAILER
What's the charge, Asbury?
COP
Theft. Assault. Creating a ...
The Jailer finishes writing. Amsterdam stands naked.
JAILER
Through that door there.
(lowers his voice)
And don't stand too near no one else.
CUT TO
A small slum thoroughfare congested by a splendid FIRE-WAGON labeled
"Americus Co./Tammany Hall." Curious SPECTATORS and panic-stricken
RESIDENTS crowd around to watch a ramshackle building going up in FLAMES.
As Johnny presses through the crowd to get a good look at the fire, Tweed,
in a white coat and fancy fire helmet, steps off the fire wagon to address
an ONLOOKER.
TWEED
Anyone inside?
ONLOOKER
No, praise God, but all we own...
TWEED places a bucket over the only fire plug in the vicinity, then sits
on it.
ONLOOKER
Well?
TWEED
Waiting on reinforcements.
The SOUND of another bell, nearby. Down the street from the opposite
direction come TWO MORE FIRE-WAGONS. The crowd starts cheering. Tweed does
not move from the plug.
TWEED
That's not them. It's only the Black Jokes. Seems your fire interrupted
their festivities.
The wagons pull up next to the fire plug. Each of them has the words
"Black Joke Fire Co." written large on the side, but the FIREMEN wear
party costumes, not regular uniforms. Some are dressed as British
Redcoats, still others as Indians.
The FLAMES continue to devour the building, but Tweed does not budge from
the plug. He is approached by the Black Jake chief, who is dressed as an
Indian chief.
CHIEF
May I point out that the building is burning to ashes?
TWEED
Certainly. And may I then remind you, Pocahontas, that this entire area is
the province of the Americus company, and you will kindly keep your
distance.
Impasse. The rival Fire Companies size each other up and start toward each
other. The building continues to burn. Tweed remains regal and unperturbed
atop the fire plug.
As the two COMPANIES are about to close with each other, a second BELL
sounds. Tweed's "reinforcements" have arrived: the Native Americans, led
by Bill The Butcher. They PILE OFF the wagons before the horses halt. Now
the Black Joke Co. is outnumbered, and it FALLS BACK. As the Crowd CHEERS,
Tweed takes the bucket off the fire plug.
TWEED
Alright, boys! To work!
The MEN of the Americus Co. give a great SHOUT and start firefighting: a
hose is hitched up to the plug, buckets are filled, a primitive pump sends
water spluttering everywhere.
But there is not much blaze left to combat and the Men quickly grow
frustrated. Tweed realizes this immediately.
TWEED
Next building over, boys! Mustn't let it spread!
The men charge into a neighboring building, STOMPING down doors, CLIMBING
through windows and SWINGING AXES with gusto, all to save a building that
is in no danger at all.
A local poll named DANIEL KILLORAN detaches himself from the crowd and
approaches Tweed, giving him a hearty SLAP on the back.
KILLORAN
Another proud night for Tammany, Bill.
TWEED
Just tell them...
(lowers his voice)
... to take enough to share. And not to steal so in the open.
Indeed, the Men are leaving the building with lots of LOOT. CITIZENS who
question their right to do this are promptly KNOCKED DOWN. Killoran GRABS
Bill The Butcher as he rushes by.
TWEED
Jesus! Boss says to tell you to fight the fire from the front and loot out
the back.
Bill grins and leaves to spread the word as an angry WOMAN approaches
Tweed.
TEARFUL WOMAN
The Black Joke could have saved my house!
TWEED
Black Joke had no business here, Madam.
TEARFUL WOMAN
Their business was to save my house!
TWEED
Tammany's your business. When we're here to call upon there's no need of
other. We understand loss, Madam, and take care of our own.
As Tweed leads her off, away from the blaze and the thieving, he passes a
boy sitting an the curb, watching the fire ... and watching Tweed ... with
admiration. It's Johnny.
The FLAMES light up his EYES as we...
DISSOLVE TO
... the same eyes. But OLDER. Smart and full of savagery.
It is Amsterdam. He is now in his early 20s, fully grown and no man to
trifle with. Moving with jungle stealth and strength he ...
... BURSTS out the door within the massive frame of a great iron gate over
which hangs the sign "High Bridge Orphan Asylum." He starts to RUN and a
TITLE comes up...
1852
Pursued by GUARDS, Amsterdam runs hell-for-lather for a long vaulted
bridge. It's a beautiful, stern old Romanesque span across the Harlem
River with rolling banks of leafy trees on the far side. Even in the
twilight, we can see that it is late spring, the end of a long afternoon.
CUT TO
Amsterdam is on the bridge. But he does not slow up until ....
... two orphanage GUARDS suddenly TACKLE him. A THIRD GUARD beats him with
a billy club. Amsterdam moans and curses, as much from frustration as pain.
SECOND GUARD
It's Blackwell's Island certain now, boyo.
The SECOND GUARD pulls AMSTERDAM up by the hair.
THIRD GUARD
Are you hurting? Let's hear you!
Amsterdam won't give him the satisfaction. The Guard hits him. Amsterdam
goes down, biting his lip so he won't cry out. Instead, he forces a SMILE.
SECOND GUARD
There's nothing funny, boyo! You been beat and turned back four times now.
AMSTERDAM
But every time you bring me back... you got to come further to catch me.
CUT TO
Through the THICK FOG comes a ghostly apparition: a tattered SKULL AND
CROSSBONES, made of rags, fluttering from the mast of a leaky, unstable
vessel.
The bow of the small boat breaks the fog, and on board we see: a hulk
called SHEENY MIKE KURTZ and a huge black kid named JIMMY SPOILS, manning
the cars. Johnny Sirocco, grown wary and wiry, peers into the fog like a
lookout, while Shang Draper, at the tiller, looks anxious.
The HULL of a large boat suddenly laoms in front of them, not five yards
away.
JOHNNY
Hard starboard, Shang! Hard starboard!
SHANG
(panic)
I told you forget that sailor stuff! Which way's star...
Too late. Their Ticket craft crashes into the side with enough force to
make a LOUD THUMP and to send Shang sprawling.
SHEENY MIKE
(sarcastic)
Why don't we just knock on their front door?
Shang gestures for QUIET. They wait and listen. No sound from the deck of
the boat above them. The boys throw two ROPE LADDERS over the rail of the
larger ship and start climbing.
CUT TO
The boys board the ship and gather on deck. They look around uneasily,
spooked by the silence and the fog.
SHANG
Spread out and make for the cabin.
Moving slowly, the boys FAN OUT and move toward the cabin at the far end
of the deck. Johnny stays close to Shang, holding onto the shipls rail for
support.
SHANG
(whispering)
Nothing. Looks picked clean.
Johnny stops. His hand, on the railing, is BLOODY. On the other side of
the deck, Sheeny Mike discovers more traces of blood and SIGNALS Shang.
SHANG
Bill and the Natives must have got here first.
Johnny freezes in terror.
SHANG
What ...
A long SHADOW falls across his shoulder. Shang jumps.
Standing before him, holding a musket and covered in blood, is the ship's
CAPTAIN. A BUTCHER'S CLEAVER is imbedded between his neck and shoulder.
With his dying energy, the Captain takes AIM at a petrified Shang and
fires his musket.
Jimmy Spoils JUMPS the Captain from behind, sending the musket ball way
wide. But the SOUND of the musket is thunderaus, and echoes through the
harbor. The boys panic and head for the side.
SHEENY MIKE
That'll bring the Harbor cops for sure.
JOHNNY
(about the dead man)
Wait! Take him. If he's still alive he's good for ransom!
SHEENY MIKE
Hels dead as Good Friday, can't you...
JOHNNY
Then we'll take Bill the Butcher's cleaver and sell the body to the
medical students. They'll go five dollars for it anyway.
SHANG
Come on. We'll get something out of this.
Shang and Johnny start DRAGGING the body. Pushing, pulling and mostly
panicked, the others help. As they boost the body over the side, the SOUND
of a bell cuts through the fog.
SHEENY MIKE
The Harbors!
Shang shoves the body off the side and into the boat. It lands with a
resounding THUD. The boys CLAMBER after it.
CUT TO
PUSHING OFF with cars, tearing their rope ladders from the side of the
ship, stumbling over the captain's body, the boys slip off into the fog.
The Harbor Police are so close to them they can see a police LANTERN
shining. The boys stay absolutely still. Suddenly, WE SEE: the POLICE
BOAT, breaking through the fog, then
DISAPPEARING again.
SHEENY MIKE
We can't go back to Corlears Hook, they'll be watching...
SHANG
We'll make for Blackwells.
JIMMY SPOILS
And which way's that through this fog?
Johnny throws his hands up for quiet. From close by comes the SOUND of
COP'S VOICES. They are near. Very near. The boys stay as still as they
can...
... and the VOICES recede again in the thick fog.
JIMMY SPOILS
Should have asked them directions as they drifted by, Shang.
SHANG
You'd have liked that, wouldn't you Coal Face? You're the only one they'd
miss in the dark.
SHEENY MIKE
Let's quiet, or we'll all be found out!
As the BOYS stay still, their boat DRIFTS against an outcropping of land
and STOPS.
SHANG
Alright. We lay up here till first light. Then we run back across the
river.
JIMMY SPOILS
(contemptuously)
River pirates!
Spoils settles back and tries to sleep. Johnny watches Shang in the bow.
Shang is too agitated to notice Johnny's stare. He looks away, waiting for
the sun.
CUT TO
34 EXT- BLACKWELLS ISLAND DAWN
Shang drowses in the boat, fighting fatigue, then succumbing to it. But
h's brought awake suddenly by a loud SPLASH. He looks in the direction of
the noise, SEES ...
... the BODY of the slaughtered ship's captain floating away in the
company. He starts to cry out but Amsterdam GRABS him, locking his throat
in the crook of his arm.
AMSTERDAM
(to everyone)
Push off! Or his pipe snaps!
The other boys are too stunned to resist. They push the boat away from the
island.
AMSTERDAM
Head straight out, then turn for the current.
He pushes Shang away from him. The two boys stare at each ather, finally
remembering...
SHANG
(breathing hard)
Figured you for dead.
AMSTERDAM
Close enough.
SHANG
This is my crew. And welcome to join, if you've the mettle. We're river
pirates and quick thieves and street brawlers...
AMSTERDAM
(casual disdain)
You're lost.
SHANG
Yeah? You've no business saying anything against us! Do you know how much
you cost us? You know how much that body's worth?
AMSTERDAM
I doubt it's worth the water it's floating in.
SHANG
Fifteen dollars! Fifteen dollars from them medical ghouis.
AMSTERDAM
I'll make it back for you whatever it is, once we're in the city. Just
keep sailing, or we're all done for.
SHANG
(beat; to crew)
Go ahead then.
(beat; to Amsterdam)
He was in his prime. He'd have fetched thirty dollars easy.
CUT TO
A hot summer day. All the TRADESMEN are out in force, jamming the square
and the side streets leading to it. Amsterdam walks fast through the
crowd, enjoying the freedom and the bustle, as Johnny tags along close
behind him.
AMSTERDAM
I've got my own way to go, why don't you find yours?
JOHNNY
Because your way's different, and I want to see where it goes.
(Amsterdam looks at him)
Unless you say otherwise. Amsterdam shrugs and keep walking.
JOHNNY
You act like you have something in mind, like you know every day what
you'll be doing the next. Me, I don't figure on tomorrow.
AMSTERDAM
Well, if you shut up a while maybe it'd come on its own.
(he stops, looks)
Now what the hell's that?
JOHNNY
(following his glance)
Oh that's heaven.
WE SEE what they're looking at: the Old Brewery. In worse shape than ever
before, but shut-down, abandoned. A tattered banner flaps against the
front door: "Future Home of the Five Points Mission/ Praise God!/ The
Reverend Shadrach Raleigh, Pastor."
JOHNNY
The city shut down the Brewery as unfit to live and Tammany gave it over
to this minister.
AMSTERDAN
What's Tammany?
JOHNNY
Why Tammany ... you don't know? Tammany makes the city run. A political
organization that's like... like the Native Americans, only ranging over
the whole city.
CUT TO
37 MONTAGE
As Johnny continues to speak, we see Tammany tactics in action:
WARD-HEALERS dispensing coal to the poor, and TOUGHS stealing meat off of
butcher's wagons; a political PARADE with fife and drum-and
politicians--including Boss Tweed--in ceremonial Indian costume, and a
group of GOONS busting up a saloon; Tweed making a speech to enthusiastic
CONSTITUENTS and a Tammany Fire Company tearing through the streets,
scattering everyone in their way, finally revealing they are not rushing
to a fire but are CRASING OFF a rival fire company.
JOHNNY
They seem like the law, but they got a way of acting outside the law.
Anything that happens in this city, on the straight or on the sly,
Tammany's a part of, and Boss Tweedls the heart of Tammany.
CUT TO
Amsterdam studies Johnnyls enthusiastic face.
JOHNNY
They're the best gang there is.
AMSTERDAM
So if Tammany's the best, go with Tammany. What are you running with this
mob for?
JOHNNY
'Cause they're more my size for now. With Tammany, you got to do something
large, something that makes them take notice of you.
AMSTERDAN
You're better oft without their notice. You can run free, work your own
schemes.
JOHNNY
But if your schemes have size, you need size to bring them off.
AMSTERDAM
What are you thinking?
Johnny shrugs, grins: he doesn't want to give anything away. Amsterdam
understands, turns toward the Brewery.
AMSTERDAM
Let me in if you ever get it figured.
Amsterdam starts toward the Old Brewery, Johnny keeping step.
AMSTERDAM
I'll go on my own from here.
Johnny STOPS and Amsterdam continues on by himself.
CUT TO
A shock of summer SUNLIGHT as Amsterdam emerges from one of the back
entrances of the Brewery onto a fetid alley filled with rotted barrels,
broken glass and insensible drunks.
Amsterdam looks carefully up and down the alley, letting his eyes adjust
to the bright light. Ahead of him, he SEES ...
Shang Draper, in jovial conversation with a SECOND MAN we do not
recognize. The man is bareheaded, and has a deep scar running back to
front clear down the center of his bald head. Amsterdam waits, WATCHES.
Shang takes the RED SILK SCARF he got from Jenny's swag and hands it to
the Second Man. He and Shang SHAKE HANDS, as if they have concluded a
business deal, and the Second Man walks away.
Amsterdam PRESSES himself close to the door as Shang LOOKS AROUND...
doesn't see Amsterdam... and walks off in the opposite direction, across
Paradise Square.
CUT TO
43 INT- RECEPTION ROOM AND TWEED'S OFFICE DAY
The main room is as loud and as prosperous as the stock exchange. Bill the
Butcher makes his way past Small GROUPS of men engaged in heated political
dealings of dubious virtue.
Bill knocks on the door to Tweed's private office while he's opening it.
Inside is Boss Tweed, seated in a large WOODEN BOX like a primitive sauna.
Around him are various PETITIONERS, and his assistant Daniel Killoran.
TWEED
I dread city stimmers. They bring illness and beget vermin.
PETITIONER #l (GLEASON)
My plague box fends off all pestilence. Its elixir combats ill humors...
KILLORAN
We can't have every citizen of the Five Points boxed up like cargo.
TWEED
But the season is vicious, and I must take thought of our constituents.
Mr. Gleason, I'd like you to shake hands with Mr. Barnett Baff...
Gleason, dubious, shakes hands with PETITIONER #2 as Bill the Butcher
looks on with amusement.
TWEED
A friend and owner of an estimable carting service. Work out an
arrangement whereby the citizenry can receive the benefit of Mr. Gleason's
wondrous elixir outside this excellent box. At a cost, Mr. Gleason, of how
much the barrel ...
GLEASON
(figuring rapidly)
Oh, perhaps twenty-five dollars.
TWEED
...and how much, Mr. Baff, for haulage and distribution...
BAFF
The same again. At least.
TWEED
At least. That's a price of fifty dollars. And greedy, low piracy at that
(Gleason and Baff splutter)
But a price that Tammany, in its generosity, will meet. Merely submit a
bill for a hundred. We'll each have half. And I'll retain this box for
further experiment. Hello, Bill.
Killoran LEADS the astonished Gleason and Baff away as Bill APPROACHES.
TWEED
Bolt the door.
Bill complies. As Tweed speaks and the anti-plague VAPORS SWIRL around his
head, he keeps his eyes closed.
TWEED
Scotchy Lavelle's gone wrong in his accounts.
BILL THE BUTCHER
I know. Scotchy's a good man.
TWEED
Not good enough to rake thirty percent of our share from Sparrow's and use
it for his own.
(opens his eyes)
You got to give him over, Bill.
BILL THE BUTCHER
I can't do that. No matter what he steals, I still get more from him than
any two others. As do you.
TWEED
Alright then. What about Charles McGloin? He's running a panel game off to
one side. Did you know that?
(Bill shrugs)
I can't get a day's work done for all the good citizens pouring in here
complaining about crime and corruption all over the Points. They accuse
Tammany of carelesoness. Some even suspect ... a few practically suggest.
(eying Bill significantly)
... our complicity with this rampant criminality. We must show them
Tammany stands behind the letter of the law. We need to set an example.
BILL THE BUTCHER
(beat)
Charles McGloin will do.
TWEED
I'll set the trial for Friday.
CUT TO
44 EXT- TOMBS DAY
CAMERA moves high along the outside wall, past small rectangular slits
that pass for jail windows. EYES peer out, as if a peep show is underway
directly below in the Tombs courtyard. A PRISONER is being readied for the
gallows by having a hood tied to his head.
The CROWD is in a carnival mood; HOT CORN GIRLS, STREET VENDORS,
"HOKEY-POKEY" (i.e., ice cream) MERCHANTS, even BUSKERS, all add to the
holiday spirit.
Jenny works through the crowd, pushing and smiling her way past groups of
raucous merrymakers. She stops once or twice to have a word with a
GENTLEMAN, flirts for a moment, then moves on.
Further back in the crowd, Amsterdam NOTICES her. He watches her go
through the crowd with an admiration that quickly turns to FASCINATION as
he realizes what she's doing: picking pockets. The best bludget in the
Five Points. He starts to FOLLOW her.
Jenny has worked her way close to the hanging platform, but she's so
intent on her job she has not noticed Amsterdam. The closer the platform,
the closer the spectacle and richer the pickings: Jenny's concentration is
absolute. On the platform, an ASSISTANT HANGMAN addresses the Crowd.
ASSISTANT HANGMAN
Those interested in the effects of the condemned please come forward.
44 CONTINUED:
Part of the Crowd PRESSES in toward the platform, temporarily blocking
Amsterdam's view of Jenny. He is right against the platform.
ASSISTANT HANGMAN
What am I bid for this coat? A coat of some wear but excellent cut...
containing a rather remarkable pocket silk...
MAN IN CROWD
Bid a quarter!
HANGMAN
A quarter, thank you. Do I hear fifty cents? Fifty cents?
The Hangman is holding up the condemned man's coat which contains the RED
SILK SCARF Amsterdam saw Shang give away. Amsterdam flips the HANGMAN a
quarter, reaches out and GRABS the handkerchief.
AMSTERDAM
Here. Just for the silk.
He stuffs it into his pocket and starts to PUSH his way through the crowd.
On the platform, the WARDEN steps forward holding a primitive megaphone.
WARDEN
Do you have any last remarks, Charles McGloin?
McGloin grunts from underneath the hood.
MCGLOIN
Not from under this hood I don't.
Crowd near the platform begins to CHANT "No hood, no hood, no hood!" The
Warden puts his hand on the hood, starts to remove it...
... and the Crowd CHEERS. Amsterdam turns, SEES: Charles McGloin. Bald,
with a deep scar running front to back on his head. The very SAME MAN he
saw in the alley with Shang.
McGloin acknowledges the cheers of the crowd. The Warden holds to
megaphone close and McGloin bellows...
MCGLOIN
I never struck a foul blow or turned a card and may God greet me as a
friend!
The Crowd ROAR approval at these words. Amsterdam PUSHES through the
crowd, looking for Jenny ... SPOTTING her finally...
... while up on the platform, the NOOSE is placed around McGLOIN's neck,
and he is HOISTED UP in no time. We hear his neck SNAP. His feet kick
after death. The Crowd raises a zighty cheer.
CUT TO
Amsterdam walks with a crowd toward a waiting Broadway stage, a vehicle
that looks like a horsedrawn train car. The stage will take spectators
back uptown from the hanging.
He is working his way toward Jenny, who is now BOARDING the stage.
Amsterdam DASHES through the crowd and SQUEEZES onto the stage, which
moves forward with a JOLT.
Once on board, Amsterdam looks through the jammed car, SEES: Jenny, about
to sit down - A MAN has offered her his seat. She smiles dazzlingly as she
sits...
... and arranges her hands genteelly on her lap. The Man looks down on her
and she smiles up at him again. He is bequiled.
Amsterdam manages to get a little closer.
MAN
I hope you won't think me rude if I speak.
JENNY
No, sir. You look a proper Gentleman down to the ground.
As this conversation continues, we watch-not only Jenny and The Man in
conversation, and Amsterdam watching them; but we begin to notice what
Amsterdam SEES. Although Jenny's hands apparently remain folded on her
lap, her RIGHT HAND moves SLOWLY out from her wrap... toward The Man...
MAN
Well, I wouldn't want you to think me forward, you see.
... and BRUSHES past his jacket. He does not notice or feel a thing.
Jenny's hand GLIDES past his THIGH ... nearly brushing it ... moving up
across his pelvis and around his buttocks...
JENNY
Does it matter to you what I think?
MAN
Well, I might like it to.
JENNY
Oh.
...toward his pocket. The Man is in Jenny's thrall. He feels nothing and
continues to have no idea what is going on. But Amsterdam KNOWS. Every
silken, surreptitious move of her HAND across The Man's body is like a
CARESS that Amsterdam can feel. Jenny's grace is balletic and EROTIC. As
she picks The Man's pocket, she is, without knowing it, also seducing
Amsterdam
MAN
I mean, if you would like.
JENNY
I might like, sir. But I can't say now.
Her hand HOVERS above his pocket, waiting for the SWAY of the stage to
match and mask her movement....
MAN
Why?
... and she starts to get up as soon as the stage JOSTLES. The entire car
full of passengers LEANS into one another...
... and Jenny's hand SLIDES the Man's WALLET from his trousers as
he recovers his balance. Amsterdam watches her withdraw her HAND in a
flash and hide it beneath her wrap.
JENNY
Because this is my stop.
MAN
May I walk with you a little, then?
JENNY
(firmly)
That would be too bold.
MAN
But I'll never see you again.
JENNY
I come every Thursday to the Tombs to see my father.
MAN
I'll look for you.
Jenny fetches him another fine SMILE--it's almost demure--and takes her
way off the rear entrance of the stage.
lt PULLS AWAY up Broadway and Jenny walks briskly toward an alley.
CUT TO
Jenny looks to make sure she has the alley to herself, then moves her body
a little...
... and her arms seem to come off. She has been wearing a set of
ARTIFICIAL ARMS, hollow inside, which she can leave folded on her lap
misleadingly while she goes about her pickpocketing.
She's folding up the appliance--cotton sewn over a soft form-when a VOICE
behind her makes her turn.
AMSTERDAM
May I walk with you a little, then?
CUT TO
As Jenny and Amsterdam walk through the noisy bustle of the city's main
thoroughfare.
JENNY
Are you a spy, then?
AMSTERDAM
Got no one to spy for. I'm an appreciator, you might say.
JENNY
Appreciator of what?
AMSTERDAM
A good touch.
She STOPS in the street, looks him straight in the eye.
JENNY
Don't bother with the chat. If you want me, we come to a business
arrangement. lf the terms is right, then I decide how you suit me. Then I
do it or not.
AMSTERDAM
Just take a minute, I was Just...
JENNY
I know what you was just. I had years already of what you was just. You
know how I got so good at thieving? So's I wouldn't have to lay down for
everyone who had the ned. Now I do it when I want to for how much I want
to. Otherwise I don't do it, and don't have to do it, and to hell with
anyone's rules but my own.
AMSTERDAM
What about Shang's rules? You pay a lot over to him. The better your day,
the better his. It don't seem gute right.
JENNY
(a little curious now)
What's it to you?
AMSTERDAM
Give him this.
He hands her the RED SILK SCARF. She recognizes it instantly as the same
one she gave Shang.
AMSTERDAM
And you can keep a little more of what you earned.
JENNY
How'd you come by this?
AMSTERDAM
I got my own touch.
JENNY
Are you making me a present, or making an Arrangement?
AMSTERDAM
It's your rules, right? So you decide.
She looks at him for a moment, then starts to TIE the scarf around her
neck like a kerchief.
CUT TO
A SWELTERING evening. The streets are jammed with REVELERS and RESIDENTS.
Some people sleep in doorways in futile search for fresh air. Happy Jack
Mulraney leads a group of apprehensive UPTOWN CITIZENS past drunks and
whores.
JACK
Commissioner Brunt said to spare you nothing concerning conditions.
CITIZEN
Nothing but our safety, of course.
JACK
All's snug around Paradise Square in my company, squire. See there.
He gestures toward the street, down which one oi Mr. Barnett Baff's CARTS
is being drawn by a team of WHEEZING NAGS.
The cart bears massive barrels of what a colorful banner advertises as "an
anti-pestilence influenza-thwarting solution... a service of Tammany
Hall." As the wagon draws abreast of a large group of languishing
RESIDENTS, HOSES spurt waves of solution all over the streets. Many people
are SOAKED. Jack and his Citizens jump back just in time.'
JACK
Tammany makes the streets nanitary, I make 'am safe.
WOMAN CITIZEN
(apprehensive)
Even against them?
A small distance behind the anti-plague cart, moving in rough formation,
come some of Shang's mob, heading aimlessly across the Square cruising for
action
JACK
Against them especially. Let me demonstrate.
Jack takes out his GOLD WATCH AND CHAIN, which he HANGS carefully over a
nearby lamppost. Then, very casually, he leads the Citizens off.
JACK
We'll be back for this at our leisure.
WOMAN CITIZEN
You dare leave it here?
JACK
Safe as a vault, lady. Since all knows it's mine.
The Gang draws abreast of the lamppost. No one makes a move to take the
watch until one of the YOUNGEST BOYS reaches out ... but
Shang knocks his hand away. Jack, at a distance, NODS approvingly.
SHANG
You know that's Jack's.
BOY
So what?
AMSTERDAM
It should be hangin' off Jack's vest, then. Not here, like some war flag.
SHANG
That watch is a small price for free run of the Points.
AMSTERDAM
If it's free, how come we pay so much? Wo shouldn't pay for what's our due.
SHANG
We don't tight when we don't have to. It's not warring that counts. It's
the living day to day.
ANSTERDAM
(smiles)
Is that right? Did I hear that correct? John, did we hear that correct?
Eyes now on Johnny. Jenny looks at him with great interest.
JOHN
(uneasy pause)
We heard the same.
AMSTERDAM
So then.
He reaches for the watch.
CUT TO
Happy Jack stands at the lamppost, aghast. A WOMAN lowers her head and
retches. Jackls watch and chain are still in place.
But the watch has been SMASHED. And hanging from the chain is a BLACK CAT,
skinned and strangled.
CUT TO
51 INT- HIDEOUT
Happy Jack stands with his Citizens. The room QUIETS as, one by one, the
mob notices him.
JACK
You!
He GRABS the Young Boy who had reached for his watch on the lamppost and
starts to BEAT him.
JACK
What'd you do to my watch, you dirty little bastard...
Jack breaks the Boy's hand with his nightstick. The Boy SCREAMS
and FAINTS. So does one of the Women in the group. Jack takes the Boy's
other hand.
JACK
Hands won't be so quick in future.
SHANG
That's enough sport this evening, Jack.
JOHNNY
(stepping forward)
It wasn't him.
All turn to look at Johnny. Jack drops the Boy's hand.
JOHNNY
I have word for you from who did it. You're to meet him at Sparrow's
Chinese Pagoda.
CUT TO
Amsterdam holds the FANCY COAT from Jack's uniform over his arm.
Carefully, he DRAPES the coat over Jenny's shoulders. SHANG steps forward.
SHANG
I gave no order for this.
Amsterdam says nothing at first, just holds his hand out: he's holding the
RED SILK SCKRF.
AMSTERDAM
(very quietly)
Never mind giving orders. What were you giving this for?
SHANG
I'm calling you out, Amsterdam.
AMSTERDAM
I got this at the hanging. It was Charles McGloin's. Everybody here saw
you take it from Jenny. What was MCGloin doing with it? What'd you give it
to him for?
SHANG
I didn't give it to him. Why would I give it to him?
AMSTERDAM
I gaw you give it to him. Last week, behind the Old Brewery.
SHANG
(to group)
He's gone flat. I got no reason to trade with the Native Americans.
AMSTERDAM
What about stepping up in the world, as it were, and leaving the rest of
us behind. There's a reason. Making a separate arrangement for yourself
with the one Native so stupid and luckless that he got hung. That's you to
the ground, Shang.
SHANG
(very edgy now; to group)
Who believes what he's saying? Can any of you believe what he's saying?
AMSTERDAM
Bene. We'll see. Any of you that believes I did proper by Happy Jack
Mulraney tonight, stand beside me. Any of you that still likes Shang's way
with the cops, and Shang's way with the Natives, go to him.
(to Shang)
Or should we settle right now, you and me, and just see which of us is
left standing?
SHANG
Let see where they stand.
Jenny rises, stands next to Amsterdam. Jimmy Spoils, Johnny, Sheeny Mike
are next. Now the other members of the mob move in clusters to all STAND
with Amsterdam.
AMSTERDAM
What's your pleasure, Shang?
One of the YOUNG BOYS has a dead rat blackjack hanging from his belt.
Shang grabs it. He BITES the head oft the rat and spits it across at
Amsterdam. Amsterdam almost smiles at him. Shang sneers, drops the body of
the rat, and LEAVES.
AMSTERDAM
This mob ever have a proper name?
JOHNNY
We was called after Shang when we was named at all.
AMSTERDAM
We're the Dead Rabbits from now. They were the best. They were history.
They were legend, and we'll live up to them.
CUT TO
Amsterdam sits on an empty pier, watching the ships in the river. There's
a SUDDEN RUSTLING NOISE as a NOOSE coils around his neck.
It's Jenny. She's slipped the SILK Amsterdam gave her close to his throat,
and she's TIGHTENING it. Amsterdam starts to resist. Then he sees how's
she's looking at him.
She uses the silk to bring his face closer to hers. She KISSES him.
AMSTERDAM
What's this then?
JENNY
Payment for the silk.
Then DROPS the silk from his throat and starts to touch him. Then his
hands are under her skirt. Then, under the cloudy moonlight, they start to
make love.
CUT TO
Later. Amsterdam pulls Happy Jack's uniform COAT over Jenny to keep her
warm in the chill air.
JENNY
You were waiting for me out here, weren't you?
AMSTERDAM
Maybe I was, yeah.
JENNY
You was that sure of me?
AMSTERDAM
Sure enough to wait, anyway. Waiting don't cost nothing.
JENNY
It don't do to be sure. I could go away just as easy.
AMSTERDAM
Alright.
He sweeps the coat away from her body, allowing her to leave.
JENNY
I'll say when I want to, not you.
AMSTERDAM
Stay then.
(beat; smile)
One way or another, I get what I want.
JENNY
(looking at him)
Yeah. If it was just a shag you wanted.
AMSTERDAM
You're a gypsy, are you, come to tell my fortune? Go ahead then. Tell me
what I'm wanting.
JENNY
You got blood in your eye for someone.
AMSTERDAM
It's just I can't look away, that's all.
JENNY
Who from?
AMSTERDAM
Bill Poole.
JENNY
You better get someone else in your sights. No one's ever taken him.
AMSTERDAM
'Cause he's mine, that's why. I'll take his one eye, and then the rest of
him, piece by small piece.
JENNY
You have a plan for this? You going to raise a militia? I'll wager Bill
the Butcher don't even know about you or care if he does.
AMSTERDAM
He'll know about me soon enough.
JENNY
And after the Butcher?
AMSTERDAM
You.
JENNY
Is that so?
AMSTERDAM
You'll be in love with me.
JENNY
Love you? You just had me. You can have a mort any time you want. So why
look for more than that.
AMSTERDAM
That's taking love, not giving it. I want it to be just you and me, no one
else for either.
JENNY
Why?
AMSTERDAM
'Cause none of us means nothing in life except one to the other.
JENNY
I don't know I want to mean something, to you or anybody. Can there be
good in that?
He stares at her.
AMSTERDAM
We'll see.
Jenny pulls the coat tighter around her.
JENNY
It'll take a while if we do. If we ever do.
AMSTERDAM
And what about the meantime?
JENNY
Meantime's business.
CUT TO
57 EXT PARADISE SQUARE DAY
A CROWD gathers in one of the main thoroughfares bisecting the 5 Points. A
beefy SPEAKER is making an anti-Irish speech on behalf of James W. Barker,
a mayoral candidate supported by Tammany's current rivals, the
Know-Nothing Party. Hand-painted signs are everywhere, bearing Barker's
unsavory likeness. A couple of BUSKERS provide a musical score for the
political spiel.
SPEAKER
The potato is a thick vegetable. Heavy. Meaty. Comes out of the ground
dirty and stays that way unless you scrub it and boil it to death!
(cheers and laughs from crowd)
We don't want to keep lem out of the country! We'll even give 'em a place
at our table! But we ain't gonna vote 'em into office.
Much CHEERING and jovial approval from the Crowd. On its fringes,
Amsterdam and the Dead Rabbits make their way roughly across the Square.
SHEENY MIKE
Any Irish hears that will be out for blood.
AMSTERDAM
The Irish is too busy building up Tammany. That's where their brains and
muscle goes. Once they're inside with their cronies, they turn on their
own outside. Tammany'd steal the air and rent the daylight if they could.
SHEENY MIKE
We'd do the same.
AMSTERDkM
Not against our own we wouldn't. That's the difference.
JOHNNY
Tammany earns better. That's the difference.
AMSTERDAM
I ain't seen their ned yet.
Johnny stops walking, betraying slight annoyance that he has to explain
the day's deal.
JOHNNY
You will at day's end, that's our arrangement. A quarter a voter, whether
they're repeaters or not. I'm telling you, we got a square deal.
SHEENY MIKE
It's sound, Amsterdam.
AMSTERDAM
Yeah? Well, it's ned anyway. Just make sure you count it when we get it.
JOHNNY
It's just a day's job, we don't have to make it a life's work. We work for
Tammany today and kill them tomorrow, if that's our pleasure.
JIMMY SPOILS
So we're politicians just for today.
AMSTERDAM
Not for a minute. We're better than that. We're thieves.
CUT TO
58 MONTAGE
The Dead Rabbits go about the business of rounding up Tammany voters. They
pick up DRUNKS in alleys; Jenny and some of the Dead Rabbit MORTS raust
PATRONS in a whore house; Rabbits shanghai SAILORS from saloons; corral
CITIZENS as they walk along the street, either wheedling or bullying to
get them to vote. It's the strong arm of democracy.
CUT TO
On one side of the door, some Dead Rabbits, with a RABBLE of potential
voters; on the other, POLICE doing their best. Behind and all around,
various WARD HEELERS and SMALL-TIME POLITICIANS, representing both the
Know-Nothing candidate Barker and Tammany's Fernando Wood. Varicus
factions push and pull at one another as they wedge their VOTERS into the
polls.
JIMMY SPOILS
He's got the right to vote, damn you!
COP
Not four times he don't.
(shoves a Voter)
There'll be no damned repeaters here!
The Cop and Jimmy play tug-of-war with a besotted VOTER, while other gang
members rush to GRAB VOTERS leaving the polls.
PANDEMONIUM.
CUT TO
A large wagon bearing a Tammany banner and carrying dozens of small sacks
of coal moves slowly down the narrow street. Boss Tweed sits on the front
seat, next to the driver, as his minions HAND him coal sacks. Tweed
distributes them with a smile to the NEEDY who trot next to the wagon.
BOSS TWEED
(to the people as they grab the coal)
Tammany's here to take the chill off the winter and the weight off your
heart. It's Tammany can make this city a fit place, with the help and vote
of all you good people...
As he continues, Bill the Butcher JUMPS onto the wagon and sits down
beside him. Boss Tweed hardly gives him a glance.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You sent me word.
BOSS TWEED
We could use help here. Grab a sack.
BILL THE BUTCHER
I keep my hands clean.
BOSS TWEED
(now he looks at him)
So I've observed.
BILL THE BUTCHER
(tense)
Better be on your mark to talk like that to me. It was you stopped me at
the Pagoda. I would have cut Monk inside out.
BOSS TWEED
What if you hadn't? Think of the embarrassment. And what if you had?
Consider the waste. Next time you're in a dust-up like that, think ahead
and make proper plans. It'd be a grand source of revenue, whoever prevails.
BILL THE BUTCHER
It touches my heart how you always. have our best interests in mind.
BOSS TWEED
Our mutual interests. That's why I want you to contact Monk Eastman.
(Bill's incredulous)
I want you to extend a proposition. I want him to join US.
BILL THE BUTCHER
What?
BOSS TWEED
Oh, not Tammany, of course not. We could no more have him there than you.
But he should throw in with the Native Americans, become aware of our
Arrangement and ... well, use his influence, shall we say, to enrich us
all.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You're saying I can't do everything you need? You don't think the Natives
has been doing good and right? You think there's something more he can do
that I ...
BOSS TWEED
(interrupting)
It's none of that, Bill. None of that. His independence is like a rebuke
to Tammany. And an insult to you.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Then you should have let me have him at Sparrow's.
BOSS TWEED
I should. If I'd been confident-absolutely certain--that you would have
prevailed. Monk is an unpredictable power, and a figure of size. He needs
to be reckoned with.
BILL THE BUTCHER
He needs to be killed.
BOSS TWEED
No. He's an elemental force. Them you don't destroy. But you can contain
them and use them for the good they give off.
He hands Bill a sack of coal.
BOSS TWEED
Coal?
Bill doesn't answer. He HOPS DOWN off the moving wagon, and the Needy give
way quickly before him, then regroup and SWARM after Tweed and his coal.
The Boss continues with his Tammany spiel-enjoying all the attention--as
the Butcher watches, disdainful of Tweed but filled with angry
frustration. From his face we ...
DISSOLVE TO
Just before dawn. The streets are empty, the river is quiet. AMSTERDAM
follows JOHNNY out of the house.
JOHNNY
I'm going to fight you.
AMSTERDAM
Oh, Jesus, Johnny, I'm tired. How about sometime else?
JOHNNY
Now.
AMSTERDAM
You want to tell me what this fight's over? Is it The Butcher? Jenny?
(Johnny turns, determined)
Alright, alright. Then tell me why like this?
JOHNNY
So when I lose no one will see.
And he SLUGS him. Hard. Harder even than he thought he could. AMSTERDAM
stumbles, stunned, then pulls himself up. And CHARGES at Johnny, knocking
him down.
The two friends PUNCH, WRESTLE, BITE and PUMMEL EACH OTHER with such
extravagant energy that they soon...
... ROLL OFF the pier...
CUT TO
... onto the muddy ground underneath the pier. They LAND with a shuddering
SPLASH in the soggy earth, but they keep fighting ....
... as a PACK OF ORPHANS, eyes glinting like night animals, scatter like
wild beasts disturbed in their burrow.
Amsterdam has the physical advantage, and more skill. But Johnny has the
fury. All the feeling and the frustration rain out of him physically,
making the match nearly even.
The Orphan Pack watches the fight silently, showing no favoritism or
emotion, just an edge of curiosity.
Amsterdam HITS Johnny a wicked combination that makes him SINK to one knee
in the mud. But Johnny will not go down. Amsterdam, hurt himself, just
stares at Johnny in wonderment.
AMSTERDAM
Satisfied?
JOHNNY
Satisfied? It wasn't me that's been dancing and shagging all night.
And he pulls himself to his feet and THROWS a roundhouse at Amsterdam, who
half-staggers out of the way. The moment throws Johnny off balance, and he
falls in the mud again, this time on all fours. Amsterdam SINKS down
beside him.
AMSTERDAM
Enough.
Johnny won't stop: he throws a punch that Amsterdam can see coming a block
away. But he's too tired too duck; or maybe he's just fed up. He takes the
punch and FALLS on his back.
AMSTERDAM
That's it then.
JOHNNY
The hell.
And he THROWS HIMSELF on Amsterdam. It's more like he rolls over onto him
than anything, but he's on top of him now, hitting him in the face with
all he's got left in him.
AMSTERDAM
Goddamn it.
Amsterdam HEAVES Johnny off and pops him a solid SWIPE to the jaw. That
does it. Lights out. Johnny falls unconscious into the slime beneath the
pier.
The Orphan Pack keeps staring from the shadow with their ferret eyes.
Still silent. Amsterdam STRUGGLES to his feet, stops at the river's edge
to get a handful of water to revive himself. Then he looks over, sees his
unconscious friend.
AMSTERDAM
Goddamn you anyway.
He grabs Johnny's body by the shoulders and pulls him to the river's edge.
He gets some water on his hand, lets it drip over Johnny's face, washing
away a little of the blood. Not enough. He draws some more water, and RUBS
it gently onto Johnny's face.
CLOSE: on the motion of his hand. It is nearly gentle.
CUT TO
The sharply-angled turn of Doyers Street, nicknamed "The Bloody Angle."
SOUND of a horse and cart as we see a row of UPTURNED mostly WOMEN and
YOUNG CHILDREN.
A NATIVE AMERICAN drives a cart carrying large barrels of MILK. A SECOND
NATIVE rides beside him on the seat, holding a rifle, looking impassively
at the faces turned up to him. A WOMAN holding a BABY in one arm and a
CHILD by the hand steps in front of them. They almost run her down.
WOMAN
We ain't had no milk this week.
NATIVE 2
You can have as much as you can pay for.
(to crowd)
Anyone that's got the ned, step up with your pitchers. Any not, come back
when you do.
The Woman gives her children to other WOMEN in the crowd and advances
toward the wagon. Native 2 cocks his rifle...
... and Jenny steps from the watchful Crowd.
JENNY
I got ned enough for all. See? Fair enough?
She holds her hand out as she WALKS slowly toward the milk wagon. She's
carrying a huge fistful of GLEAMING COINS. The Natives on the wagon watch
her warily...
... and are JUMPED from behind by a couple of Dead Rabbits. Amsterdam
grabs a milk pitcher from a WOMAN in the crowd, AXES open the spigot on a
milk barrel and FILLS the pitcher to overflowing. Jenny JUMPS up on the
wagon seat.
JENNY
(to Amsterdam)
What's our rate? What do we charge?
AMSTERDAM
Johnny worked it out to a nickel less than the Natives. Just till we're
established. Then we raise it a penny more than now.
JENNY
Raise it? Is that what you want?
AMSTERDAM
You say, then.
JENNY
(beat; then, to Crowd) There'll be no paying at all this day. Or this
week, neither. This is Dead Rabbits business from now on.
The Crowd scrambles for milk and the Rabbits try to keep ORDER.
JENNY
(to Crowd)
We'll take ned if you got it, now or in future. But no one will go without.
AMSTERDAM
(to Jenny)
Except us. You opening a charity?
JENNY
They'll pay us what they owe, in loyalty if not in cash. Tammany gives
coal, we give milk.
AMSTERDAM
They can afford it.
JENNY
Can't we?
CUT TO
At the back door of the grand house, as Jenny OPENS it slowly and glances
inside.
AMSTERDAM
You're off your head.
JENNY
(pleased, showing off)
You can wait on me a minute. Or I'll see you back in the Points if you're
scared.
(Amsterdam looks at her)
Don't worry. I know every house on this street. They all leave their doors
open. They live like they're not in New York.
She GOES IN the house. Amsterdam WATCHES through the window, sees her
going up stairs. Then he looks at the dining room, visible distantly
through an open kitchen door.
He WATCHES, fascinated, fragments of the everyday rituals of a world he's
never seen. As SOUNDS drift listlessly from the street beyond, and a light
BREEZE blows, WE SEE IN A SERIES OF DISSOLVES the serving of a meal;
SERVANTS carrying and passing plates; FAMILY MEMBERS reaching for dishes
and passing them; the LOW KURMUR of Konversation in accents he has never
heard. It's not so much that these people and their life are foreign to
him. It is as if he has stepped into another Dimension.
He loses his sense of time, and of danger. So that when Jenny TOUCHES his
arm she surprises him thoroughly.
JENNY
Come on. I might still be taken for a maid. But you're nobody's notion of
a butler.
As Jenny and Amsterdam walk away from the house. She holds his arm. They
look young and full of hope, like a servant couple just over from the old
country enjoying a day off.
JENNY
The Police Commissioner lives the next street over. I was thinking of
visiting him next month, but cops don't buy goods. They keep all their
graft in cash.
Amsterdam looks at the houses with wonder that he tries to make casual.
She opens her satchel a little way, then NUDGES him to have a lock at the
swag inside.
JENNY
How's that for ten minutes?
AMSTERDAM
It's a lot to fence.
JENNY
I'm not going to fence it. I'm going to keep it and take it where no one
will recognize it.
AMSTERDAM
Where would that be?
JENNY
Somewhere west. Far west. Past the Mississippi River, somewhere into that
territory.
AMSTERDAM
That's a hard journey for a woman alone.
JENNY
You'd be with me.
AMSTERDAM
You got it all planned and straight, is that it?
JENNY
Once I said I'd be with you I wanted someplace we could be together.
Someplace better than here. What's the matter with that?
AMSTERDAM
Nothing. Except there's no place but here for me right now. I got to
settle things.
JENNY
Yeah, I know, but I'm talking about settling down, not settling debts.
AMSTERDAM
You don't have my obligations.
CUT TO
The Dead Rabbits SWEEP across the bustling square, Johnny and Amsterdam in
the lead.
JOHNNY
It's a fair day's wage. We just move the people out of the building, and
collect.
AMSTERDAM
Who from?
JOHNNY
Who owns the building.
(points)
Them.
The gang approaches a tumbledown BUILDING called Jacob's Ladder because of
the iron rungs that run straight up its front to the roof. Two
well-dressed GENTS stare at the building fretfully.
GENT 1
(to Johnny)
I'm glad you came in force. There's half a hundred people still in there.
GENT 2
Maybe more.
GENT 1
And not one's given rent the whole year.
AMSTERDAM
You live here?
GENT 1
No, no, of course not.
AMSTERDAM
I mean in the city. A ways north, I'll bet.
GENT 2
Yes. Why?
A RIFLE SHOT sounds from an upper window and a Rabbit falls wounded. They
all DUCK FOR COVER.
JOHNNY
It's not just citizens in there?
GENT 1
Of course it is.
JOHNNY
with arms?
GENT 2
From their damned gang. Some of them live there.
AMSTERDAM
Some of who?
GENT 2
The Native Americans.
JOHNNY
We didn't contract for that.
GENT 1
We'll pay extra for the danger.
AMSTERDAM
No danger. But you will pay extra.
(turns; to gang)
Let's go and greet some Natives.
Under SCATTERED RIFLE FIRE and a barrage of ROCKS, the GANG STORMS the
building, charging inside and starting up the ladder as if they were
attacking a medieval fortress. ARMS reach out from windows to try and pull
them off. The Rabbits respond with knives and PISTOL SHOTS. As they charge
inside, the CAMERA RISES to an OVERHEAD shot and we ...
DISSOLVE TO
Later. The same OVERHEAD ANGLE. BODIES litter the street everywhere. Some
dead and wounded Rabbits lie near NATIVES who have gone to their reward.
Some BUILDING RESIDENTS wander the street in a daze. JOHNNY is collecting
money from the Two Gents, who look very pleased as Amsterdam approaches
with Jenny. He's carrying a rifle he took from the building.
AMSTERDAM
(to Gents)
Alright, then?
GENT 2
Very much alright. Quite a spectacle.
AMSTERDAM
Oh really? Just the entertainment you favor, is it? Pardon me for a
moment, gents.
(he turns to Jenny)
You wanted to settle, you and me. That's so, isn't it? You did agree, did
you not.
JENNY
I did, yes.
AMSTERDAM
Good, because I didn't want to act hasty. I can never tell for sure what
you're thinking, and sometimes I'm not always sure what you're saying...
GENT 2
(interrupting)
Excuse me, we have to finish and...
AMSTERDAM
(to Gent 2)
Excuse me. We'll conclude in a moment.
(back to Jenny)
Where do you settle?
JENNY
Amsterdam, what are you saying?
AMSTERDAM
I'm asking, where does anyone settle?
JENNY
I don't know, you mean a place, a home?
AMSTERDAM
A home yes.
GENT 1
Excuse me, but we really must conclude.
AMSTERDAM
(ignoring him)
Well, I'm saying to you then, Jenny Everdeane, welcome home.
No one sees it coming. Amsterdam FLASHES around, swinging the BUTT of his
rifle into Gent l's midsection, doubling him over and sending him
breathless to the ground. Amsterdam SPINS again and swings the butt into
Gent 2's face, knocking him cold.
AMSTERDAM
Fine place. Room enough for all.
(to Johnny)
Get them out of here.
GENT 2
They'll come back looking for you.
AMSTERDAM
With whose help? The Natives? They won't help these flourishing bastards
even for ned.
(to Jenny)
Tell any who wants they can stay. If they can't pay rent they can join the
gang. But make sure the best rooms go to us. Look around ...
JENNY
(interrupting)
I know this building.
CUT TO
START CLOSE on: Amsterdam's hand, as he places the gold cross in a small
hole at a grave site, then covers it over with dirt.
Then WE SEE: Amsterdam is kneeling at his father's grave.
AMSTERDAM
He never had his own cross. Thanks.
Now he STANDS and TURNS. Jenny is half-hidden behind an elm tree.
AMSTERDAM
Your touch is light, but as a tracker you work awful heavy. Come ahead.
Now that I met your mother, you should come and meet my father.
As Jenny starts to WALK towards the grave, we see for the first time ...
... that we are in the country, a graveyard in an open field with an
astonishing PANORAMA of New York and the East River. (MATTE) The cemetery
is atop a hill, and the East River, busy with ferries and vessels of
trade, glistens in the near distance. Just beyond it is Manhattan Island:
low buildings, winding narrow streets, houses surrounded by open land. A
BREEZE off the river rustles Jenny's dress and blows her hair as she steps
up to the grave site, looks at the headstone and sees ...
... it is blank. No name, no date. Clean stane.
JENNY
You should finish the stone.
AMSTERDAM
It'll be finished when everything's finished. That's when helll rest. The
hand that killed him is the hand that will bury him in peace.
He holds up his open hand, covered in dirt.
JENNY
It was Bill killed him, not you.
AMSTERDAM
With my hand on the knife.
JENNY
And his hand on yours!
AMSTERDAM
And me feeling the life go out of my father! He looked at me ... he looked
at me and he swore me with his eyes. I could feel his spirit... I say I
could feel it rising... flowing through the knife like blood into my own
heart.
JENNY
You talk like he lives in you.
AMSTERDAM
I don't want him to live, I want him dead! I kill Bill and I'm free of
them both!
JENNY
You think you can be free that easy? You need your way so clear, and
you''' use anything to clear it. Anyone, too. Me, everybody, we're all
just a way for you to settle your damned ghosts.
AMSTERDAM
You're part of me now, like the gang is part of me and my father both. If
I can bring us to glory, then my father... like The Book says...my father
can enter his house justified.
As Amsterdam continues to talk we ...
DISSOLVE TO
91 MONTAGE
The growth of the Dead Rabbits, as we continue to HEAR Amsterdam speak
passionately to Jenny. We first see the Rabbits surrounding and
OVERTURNING a fire wagon; this starts as a live action scene but soon
BLEEDS into SEPIA, then freezes like an old magazine illustration.
AMSTERDAM (V.O.)
All of us is set on the same road together. The gang can have everything
they ever wanted and get me what I want while they're doing it. We're not
interfering with each other, we're helping each other. It's all the same,
we're all one together.
We CONTINUE with sepia illustrations: of Dead Rabbit morts picking pockets
and purses along a crowded Broadway; climbing onto a wagon distributing
newspapers and tossing off the occupants, taking over the route
themselves; swarming all over a merchant ship in the harbor as the captain
doles out protection money to have his cargo unloaded.
AMSTERDAM (V.O.)
We'll all have a share of the profit like we'll all have a portion of the
fame. If we come to be notorious, that only means we're strong, and if
we're strong that means we're ready.
A sepia illustration of a fire wagon rounding a corner, refurbished and
manned by Rabbits, all wearing striking uniforms with short capes called
TAMLAS. (N.B.: they will be seen wearing the tanlas from these uniforms
during all gang activity throuqhout the rest of the film. Only Johnny,
Amsterdam and Jenny do not wear them.)
The sepia illustration turns to live action as the fire wagon TEARS around
Paradise Square, SCATTERING everyone in its path, the Dead Rabbits
laughing, their tamlas FLYING behind them.
AMSTERDAM (V.O.)
And I'll know that time, know it right off when it comes. Just like I knew
you.
The live action DISSOLVES TO...
... the last image in the montage: an ILLUSTRATION of Amsterdam, a
half-decade older, turned out in fancy clothes, but with all his
fierceness intact. This is a magazine illustration, and there is a dated
headline over his picture: "Fresh Scourge of the Five Points." The date
reads "June, 1863.11
AMSTERDA.M (V.O.)
And just like that, there'll be no way of stopping till it's ended.
From this illustration, we quickly...
DISSOLVE TO
... Amsterdam, as he is in the picture, but in live action, SPRINGING to
his feet and YELLING at a couple of PRIZEFIGHTERS doing battle in a ring.
AMSTERDAM
Now! Finish him now!
Far up the sparkling Hudson, a RAFT floats slowly upstream. It's a huge
thing (perhaps half a city block in size) crowded with SPORTSMEN. They
form a LARGE RING around two mammoth PRIZEFIGHTERS who are brawling with
bare knuckles. Amsterdam and Johnny are among the spectators.
JOHNNY
Our man will take him in another five. What puts you in such a hurry?
FIGHTER 1 fetches FIGHTER 2 a powerful roundhouse punch that sends him
CRASHING to the deck. As soon as he hits the floor, a CARD GIRL appears
carrying a sign announcing "Round 37.11 SECONDS drag the stupefied Fighter
2 to his corner, while two BOYS minister to Fighter 1, SUCKING THE BLOOD
off his knuckles.
A GONG sounds to announce the appearance, in the center of the ring, of
the fight promoter, a florid and fulsome P.T. Barnum .
BARNUM
I want to extend thanks and admiration not only to our two combatants
today, but to their sponsors, the Dead Rabbits ...
(indicates one side of the ring)
... and the Native Americans.
He FLINGS an expansive arm toward the opposite side of the ring, where
Bill the Butcher sits with Daniel Killoran and a large group of Natives.
Amsterdam and the Butcher eye each other with all the old animosity: it's
almost ceremonial now, part of the Tradition.
BARNUM
Their generous support allows me to bring you this splendid exhibition.
With their indulgence I'd like to remind you also of the further wonders
that await you at my new Museum, located on Broadway...
There are BOOS from the crowd at such untoward commercialism.
BARNUM
... P.T Barnum's gallery of wonders from worlds natural and unnatural,
from nature and from myth!
(continued boos)
And to encourage you also in the view that new Albany ordinances
forbidding sportive violence on land shouldn't dampen your enthusiasm for
wagering. Bets down, entlegen, and you gents..
(indicated fighters)
... fists up!
The Fighters come to center ring, circle each other, then start slugging.
A flurry of punches, and Fighter 2 GOES DOWN again. As he hits the deck,
the round automatically ends and the between-rounds ritual takes place
again.
JOHNNY
Dobbs will take him this round. That'll be something. The Natives has
never lost before.
AMSTERDAM
Because there's never been a Dead Rabbit fighting before.
JOHNNY
That'll shame them thorough.
AMSTERDAM
There'll be worse than shaming. We only got the Natives in range.
It's time to squeeze the trigger, John.
The next round begins and the Fighters set to, MAULING each other
furiously.
JOHNNY
Don't push the Natives too far, Amsterdam. Otherwise it'll be Tammany
pushing back.
AMSTERDAM
That don't matter any more.
JOHNNY
It does matter, and it's going to matter even more. Tammany's the heart
and future of this city. If the Rabbits is going to keep growing, we're
going to have to throw in with Tammany some way.
The action in the ring is FURIOUS. The Crowd cheers. Fighter 1 seems about
to go down, but recovers and starts returning punishment to Fighter 2.
JOHNNY
They got that Conscription Act from Washington keeping them busy, but they
won't leave us alone forever. And the Natives is strong as they ever been!
In the ring, Fighter 1 drives Fighter 2 to the deck again, and this time
KNOCKS HIM COLD.
AMSTERDAM
(indicates Fighter 1)
You call that strong, John?
In the ring, a couple of agitated NATIVE AMERICANS are trying to get at
the Rabbit-sponsored winner. RABBITS start to RUSH the ring but Amsterdam
WAVES them back.
AMSTERDAM
(to Johnny)
This is our time now!
BARNUM
(trying to make official announcement)
The winner... gentlemen, please! ... the winner in the 39th round is the
Dead Rabbits champion, High Water Dobbs ... please, gentlemen!
The unofficial ring COMBAT continues, knocking Barnum about, as the new
champ throws marauding Natives around like empty flower sacks. Amsterdam
iumps into the fray, PUSHES some Natives away. They start for him but the
champ stands them off while Amsterdam WHISPERS to Barnum.
BARNUM
Just a moment, please, gentlemen! There's a word for us all. Amsterdam
promises ...
(Amsterdam whispers to him briefly)
... something large, something grand, something epic. The greatest these
are my own words, of course the greatest righting of the gravest wrong
ever done in the Five Points.
The crowd quiets, their sporting blood still up, curiosity engaged. Only
Johnny seems glum, concerned.
This is to be a duel not for money, but for honor! A fight to the death...
AMSTERDAM
(interrupting, emphasizing)
To the death. If he can stand up to it.
BARNUM
... on which money, I hasten to add, may certainly be wagered. The names
of the two champions are Amsterdam Vallon, here beside me, and ... and Mr.
William Poole, known to all as ...
BILL THE BUTCHER
(leaping up)
They know me by any name, you son of a bitch!
The crowd ERUPTS: this is a death match between Olympians. Only Johnny
does not rejoice. He looks at Amsterdam's face, flush with the belief that
the right moment has finally come, and he has to turn away. He walks away
from the ring as Killoran tries unsuccessfully to PULL the Butcher down
and cool him off.
BILL THE BUTCHER
(yelling)
I'll have him stretched on a spit!
Killoran is beside him now, whispering urgently. Bill the Butcher shakes
his head vehemently.
BILL THE BUTCHER
(to Killoran)
You got no more to say about this now.
92 CONTINUED:
AMSTERDAM
Come on, Bill! Let go of your Tammany wet nurse! My challenge, your terms.
KILLORAN
(to Bill)
Don't do it, you can't do it! There's the Conscription to deal with, and
elections coming, too. That's your calling now, not these ancient quarrels.
BILL THE BUTCHER
I'll do my work. But this is a shame, a public shame. It demands my
attention.
(yelling to Amsterdam)
Fine, then! Fine and welcome! Day after elections, we'll meet with seconds
on neutral ground to work out time and terms. It will be done and done.
He walks to the ring, holds his HAND out to Amsterdam.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You know this hand. Last time it was this close, it was on your throat.
AMSTERDAM
I remember it better from another time.
He takes the Butcher's hand. The duel is on.
CUT TO
START CLOSE ON: money being counted out: $300. And a RECEIPT quickly
written and given. We think at first this must be a bet being made on the
duel between Amsterdam and Bill the Butcher-
But we go WIDER to reveal: an office, tables and chairs, and a line. Two
lines, in fact. One, very long, filled with young man. And the second,
very short, in which a CLERK is handing the receipt to a PROSPEROUS YOUNG
MAN.
CLERK
Your release from service, according to the terms of the Conscription Act.
Keep it somewhere safe.
PROSPEROUS YOUNG MAN
I'll keep it with me.
There is only one OTHER PERSON standen behind the Prosperous Young Man,
and he steps up quickly and hands $300 to the Clerk as the Prosperous
Young Man heads for the door...
... past the second line, which snakes out into the street, filled with
draftees who SHOUT at the Prosperous Young Man as he leaves.
DRAFTEE 1
Hey, tell your Papa to pass me three hundred dollars too.
DRAFTEE 2
Tell him if he don't we'll come get you on our way to Gettysburg.
The Prosperous Young Man HURRIES away, but spots Boss Tweed and Daniel
Killoran as he leaves.
PROSPEROUS YOUNG MAN
Oh, Mr. Tweed, I'd take the time to say proper thanks but...
BOSS TWEED
No thanks owed, son. Conscription's Federal Law, and so's the $300
exemption. You might remind your father, though, that you saw me here
today, minding that the law's strictly and equitably enforced.
The Prosperous Young Man hurries out, as the Draftees continue to holler
abuse. Boss Tweed HEADS for them, followed by Killoran.
KILLORAN
You see how much they like this damned law? Enforcing it's going to hurt
us in elections.
BOSS TWEED
It's not my law, and not my liking, either. But Washington's always
treated us with sufferance, and we must extend the same regard to them.
(to Draftees)
Boys, we are bound by honor and love of country to fight in this time of
crisis!
DRAFTEE 4
We're bound by our wallets and the emptiness in them, that's what!
BOSS TWEED
Boys, the union is in distress, our land is wounded deeply, our future is
suddenly a frail and finite thing. We must ask ourselves how...
DRAFTEE 5
Yeah, you could talk a dog off a meat wagen, Tweed. But let's see you
fight!
DRAFTEE 6
That'd be worth twice three hundred dollars to see!
BOSS TWEED
(as he backs off)
Thank you, boys, thank you for your understanding.
(to Killoran)
Holy Mother.
Tweed hustles Killoran outside, where the line of Potential draftees
snakes down the block and into Paradise Square.
BOSS TWEED
Daniel, between the blindness of Washington and the damned brass of Bill
Poole Tammany will fall like an autumn leaf. We must take what measures we
can. Attend to the Butcher. After the elections, of course. Unless you
think Amsterdam will do our work for us first.
KILLORAN
He could at that. Then he would become a fresh concern
BOSS TWEED
Not so daunting as this.
(turns to the Draftees in the street)
Boys, I've just had a word with your compatriots inside, and if you show
half the sand and a fraction of the spirit they have manifeste for joining
this great struggle...
There is a chorus of BOOS and JEEPS from the Draftees outside.
OUTSIDE DRAFTEE
Put a rope around it, Tweed, and swing in your own wind!
BOSS TWEED
Great weeping Jesus, Daniel, whatever happened to the halcyon days?
CUT TO
Election Day pandemonium. The Dead Rabbits aren't working the repeaters
this day, but Johnny observes the action as Native Americans--identifiable
because of their long dusters--strongarm REPEATERS into the polls.
His attention is drawn to a HARRIED TELEGRAPH OPERATOR, who is being
SHOUTED at by Natives as he is inundated by pieces of paper and teetering
volumes of the voting registry. It's chaos. The poor Operator can't cope.
CUT TO
START CLOSE ON: telegraph wire, HUMMING with the election returns. And,
below it--far below--Johnny, Killoran and a couple of TAMMANY BOYOS,
looking up at the wire.
BOYO 1
I ain't goin' up there. I got my election suit on.
JOHNNY
This election'll be over unless we get up there.
KILLORAN
"We?" This was your notion, you go up there.
BOYO 2
(looking at polling place)
Him. He looks likely, and he ain't workin'.
He points over at Sheeny Mike Kurtz, who is observing the action at the
polls.
JOHNNY
(calls to him)
Sheeny Mike, you want to make ...
(to Boyo 1)
...how much?
BOYO 1
A dollar.
JOHNNY
(to Sheeny Mike)
Five dollars? Just to help us?
SHEENY MIKE
(a bit wary)
What's the pitch, Johnny? Amsterdam wouldn't like it, working with Tammany.
BOYO 2
Well, now, if Amsterdam wouldn't like it ...
JOHNNY
(interrupting)
He knows about it. Welre working a whole new scheme. But I won't tell him
youlre helping, if that's the way you want it. And you can keep the full
five. Just start climbing.
SHEENY MIKE
(beat)
Where's the ned?
Boyo 2 hands Sheeny Mike five bucks, which he pockets as Boyo 1 gives him
a large pair of SHEARS. Mike wipes his palms on his pants and STARTS UP
the pole.
For Killoran and the Tammany Boyos, this is like a circus stunt. They
watch Mike's ascent with pleasure.
Sheeny Mike is quite pleased with himself as he nears the top of the pole.
He turns to look at Johnny and the Tammany group below. A couple of
SPECTATORS have stopped to watch as well.
Mike gets to the top of the pole, REACHES OUT--STRETCHES OUT-toward the
telegraph wire with the shears...
... strains... reaches ... MAKES THE CUT.
On the ground, Johnny looks relieved. The Boyos offer a partmocking round
of applause.
In the spirit of things, Sheeny Mike TURNS to acknowledge the applause.
Just briefly. But long enough so he's distracted. He sees the upturned
FACES fill suddenly with fear, and he TURNS when he HEA.RS a sharp, odd
WHISTLING NOISE.
A LIVE TELEGRAPH WIRE is coming at him. He doesn't even have time to
scream. The wire hits him, whipping around him as JOLTS OF NT leap through
his body and he FALLS to the ground.
CUT TO
HANDS pick up the lifeless body of Sheeny Mike and start to carry it
off... past Amsterdam and Jenny, who stand on one side of it, watching...
and Johnny, who is on the other.
JOHNNY
He was working a Tammany job, Tammany will see to him.
AMSTERDAM
He wasn't Tammany. Not like you.
JOHNNY
He made the right choice.
AMSTERDAM
You don't know what you're saying! You killed one of our own. One of your
family!
JOHNNY
(slowly)
I didn't know he was going to die, Amsterdam. And don't tell me what's my
own and what isn't. You're not my family. And I swear, I swear on the
Virgin Mother's eyes ... I know what I'm doing, Amsterdam. It's you that's
always been blind.
(they look at each other)
I'll say my farewells.
Johnny KNEELS down beside Mike's body, brushes the hair from his brow.
JOHNNY
You still smell like drink.
He nods to the Rabbits to carry the body on and, as he RISES a half-dozen
NEWSBOYS DASH into the square, carrying fresh copies of the Tribune and
crying...
NEWSBOYS
New Tammany victory! Fernando Wood elected to third term! Tammany ticket
prevails by narrow margin! Boss Tweed vows
Armageddon for crime!
JOHNNY
(looking at Amsterdam and Jenny)
Can't you hear the future?
He walks away from the gang, through the rushing Newspaper Boys.
CUT TO
OFFICIALS stand on a high wooden platform facing a JEERING CROWD. Banners
announce a "DRAFT LOTTERY." OFFICIALS are preparing to draw the first
numbers as Boss Tweed gives out with a speech.
BOSS TWEED
Your honor... yes, and the law of the land... lies in the balance. The
Conscription Act of 1863 was handed down by President Lincoln himself ...
CROWD MEMBER
(shouting)
If Lincoln signed it, then let Lincoln fight!
CROWD MEMBER 2
It's an army of the poor fighting for a bunch of rich slackers!
CROWD MEMBER
Tammany's been our voice, let Tammany pay the exemption for all!
A YOUNG MEMBER of the crowd steps forward as Boss Tweed turns to look at
those backing him on the platform: Killoran, a CAVALRY OFFICER in fancy
dress ... and, out of sight of the crowd, Johnny Sirocco. Their
expressions are not reassuring.
YOUNG CROWD MEMBER
Your first payment, m'lords.
The Young Crowd Member hurls a STONE through the front window of a nearby
store. The CROWD cheers and runs to sack the store, and others SURGE
toward the platform. Johnny'and Killoran grab a fearful Tweed and rush him
to safety. But the Cavalry Officer stands his ground with sword and
pistol. He SHOOTS.
That STOPS them. But only for a fractured, eerie moment. Then they jump on
the Cavalry Officer, PULL him to the ground, begin to KICK and BEAT him.
CUT TO
A building burns at the end of the street, spreading a silhouette of smoke
and flame in the air...
... as a LION CHARGES down the street, growling, scattering RIOTERS in its
wake. It's a mad, frightening sight, like a fulfillment of the Biblical
prophecy produced by P.T Barnum, whose Museum is burning in the distance.
SCREAMS, YELLS, CURSES and GROANS. CRIES of pain and fear as RIOTERS jump
out of the way of the wild animal, then course up the street toward
Broadway burning in the distance.
From ABOVE, on the roof of Jacob's Ladder, Amsterdam and Jenny watch the
madness below.
AMSTERDAM
(watching lion)
That must be the vanguard of Barnum's army.
JENNY
This city will burn like Gomorrah.
AMSTERDAM
Then we'll take what we can before it gets too hot.
JENNY
I think it's past that already.
AMSTERDAM
It'll never come to that. These people ain't gang-led and they have no
purpose.
They'd rather die for themselves than the army, that's the purpose. What
would you do?
AMSTERDAM
Fight better and not get so mad. They're only doing what they should have
done years ago. Why'd they ever think there was another way to live?
JENNY
They believed what people told them, that's all.
AMSTERDAM
What people is that? The Reverend at the mission? Boss Tweed? Daniel
Killoran? People like Johnny Sirocco?
JENNY
You believed Johnny.
AMSTERDAM
Hell.
JENNY
And I believed you.
AMSTERDAM
I ain't done nothing different than what I told you, Jen.
JENNY
I believed what you said abaut being with me, with me alone. But you lied
to me. It's not me alone, it's just you and Bill Poole. Youlre so
blood-blind you can't see nothing else, not even this!
AMSTERDAM
I don't care a fine damn about what they want! It's what I want! They
won't dare harm the Points, that's all I care about! Let them turn the
rest of the city into hell! It's another country anyway.
JENNY
It's not a country for me, Amsterdam. I don't know about you. Will you
come with me?
AMSTERDAM
Not now.
JENNY
Now is when I'm going. Will you come?
AMSTERDAM
I don't want all this fighting to go to waste, Jen. I want to come out of
it with something. And I got to be waiting for the Butcher.
CUT TO
Beginning a swift series of scenes that are like a laudanum nightmare.
The street is JAMMED with people fleeing and people fighting... as Jenny
forces her way through, trying to escape.
A small mob starts to ATTACK a house where a TERRIFIED FAMILY stands in
the doorway.
FAMILY MAN
We're with you, don't harm us!
MOB MAN
Show us your spirit and come out with us then!
MOB WOMAN
And put a candle in the window to show you're one with us! Every light is
a flame against the draft!
The WIFE begs her husband not to join the mob, but they PULL HIM out into
the street. The Mob Woman hands the Wife a candle, then runs back to join
the mob.
Jenny starts to cross Paradise Square now... tries to cross, anyway... and
passes the stand where Tweed delivered his speech that very morning. She
sees: the Cavalry officer. Several MOB WOMEN have revived him with water.
He has been beaten terribly, but as he MOANS and starts to regain
consciousness, the MOB WOMEN fall upon him with fresh fury, KICKING and
HITTING his helpless body. They BREAK his bones with rocks and TEAR OFF
the fancy braid of his uniform to hang around their necks.
Now a SECOND MOB RUSHES toward the first from the opposite side of
Paradise Square. Chaos. Jenny is buffeted wildly. It's like being in a
whirlpool. She grabs a LITTLE GIRL whose face is bruised and blaody but
whose eyes shine wildly.
JENNY
What is it?
LITTLE GIRL
Cops has everything closed to the north, and the militia's coming.
CUT TO
As Jenny presses her way through the mob-devoured streets. She sees: MEN,
WOMEN and CHILDREN attacking a small group of BLACKS.
BOY
My Daddy don't have to die for you! Why should he fight and die for you?
Jenny looks ahead, sees: the river, in the distance. And flames. She runs
forward, STUMBLES. Some of the swag FALLS to the street. She SCRAMBLES to
pick it up as Rioters rush by her.
CUT TO
MATTE: The surface of the water looks like a mirror made of flame. The
piers are BURNING. The docks are ash.
SAILORS battle a MOB for possession of a small rowboat. As they fight, the
boat starts to DRIFT. Jenny spots it, RUNS for it
... but so does ANOTHER GIRL. Younger than Tenny--20 maybe, Jennyls age
when Amsterdam fell in love with her. They both get to the boat at the
same time. Each grips it by a gunwale, and they STARE at each other like
two jungle beasts over a kill.
JENNY
I'd kill you for this.
The Girl lunges at her with a knite, and Jenny SHOOTS. The GIRL slides
into the flame-reflecting Hudson as if she drowning in a pit of lava.
Jenny climbs into the boat and frantically starts to row. We stay CLOSE on
her ... working the oars clumsily, furiously ... moving the boat across
the water, trying to get away from the city...
... and we go WIDER now. A huge line of IRON--like the side of a
glacier... bisects the frame, then starts to move. Jenny
turns, SEES it. It is ...
... the looming hull of an ironclad war ship (MATTE). It LOBS cannon fire
into the city, setting off tremendous explosions.
Jenny TURNS back for the shore...
... as cannonballs land, devastating rioters.
CUT TO
MATTE: Police and MILITIA push the rioters back toward the river like
rats. A cannanball EXPLODES in their midst...
... injuring many more cops and militia than rioters. The rioters rally,
RUN over the bodies of fallen cops and soldiers. Now the advantage is
theirs; cops and militia are in retreat.
Jenny climbs up on shore and joins the mob as it presses back inland.
CUT TO
Further from the docks. Shells still exploding in the distance. Jenny
moves with the marauding mob, recognizes Doyers Street. She splits away
from the mob, moves stealthily into the street known as the Bloody Angle.
And STOPS.
Weird shadows dance on the walls of the buildings. SMOKE and EERIE LIGHT.
The angle is lined with lampposts. And from every lamppost dangles the
BODY of a black man. Or woman. Or child. Some are still smouldering.
At the base of a lamppost, a group of RIOTERS have cut open the hog-tied
CORPSE of a black man and are pouring oil into it. One of the Rioters sees
Jenny, grins and holds out the TORCH he's holding. She shakes her head and
starts to BACK out of the alley.
The Rioter touches the torch to the oil in the wound of the corpse. The
body IGNITES in flame. The RIOTERS pull on a rope and the body rises,
burning, to the top of the lamppost ...
... where its awful shadow joins all the others in the madhouse
refractions on walls all up and down the street. On the street, as the
flames dance and the bodies burn, rioters DANCE and SING. Walpurgis Night.
From these mad SHADOWS, we...
DISSOLVE TO
... the face of Amsterdam, stepping out of the SHADOWS of the roof. There
are flames in the distance. The whole gang is assembled, facing him as he
speaks.
AMSTERDAM
No we ain't going to fight, but we can take something for ourselves out of
this.
JIMMY SPOILS
I want to know who hung them bodies in the Bloody Angle. I want to address
who done it.
AMSTERDAM
Five thousand people in the street done it! Boss Tweed done it! Abe
Lincoln done it! There's nothing you can do about any one of them but stay
with us. You'll have a little of your own back.
JIMMY SPOILS
How's that?
AMSTERDAM
These riots are a gift. They...
... he PAUSES just for a moment as he sees a hand on the last rung of the
outside ladder leading to the roof: it's Jenny, returning.
AMSTERDAM
... they've made everything clear, as you might say.
(to Jenny)
Are you with us, then?
JENNY
Until I can get out. I'll go with you...
(straight at Amsterdam)
...meantime.
AMSTERDAM
Good. We're going for the Armory at Canal Street.
JIMMY SPOILS
The Armory! We'll have to beat the militia to get there.
AMSTERDAM
There's a way through the lines. Jen, did you see the cops and militia?
JENNY
I can show you from here where they are. I doubt they'll get to the Armory
in force before midday tomorrow.
AMSTERDAM
We'll get there first. We'll take everything we can carry, and destroy the
rest so no one else has the use of it, the militia, the Natives, nobody.
Then we'll turn to real business. We'll go down to the Battery.
JIMMY SPOILS
Why, we going to take a sail to Europe?
AMSTERDAM
No. But we could, after this. We're going...
(slowly, savoring this)
...we're going to take the banks. The government banks.
(awed silence from all)
Are we not?
JENNY
(beat; steps forward)
Seems we are.
One by one, then in small groups, the entire gang FOLLOWS her. They are
uncertain, reluctant, even frightened at the audacity of the scheme. But
they stand with Amsterdam.
CUT TO
The first thing we see is an ELEPHANT, who trumpets fearfully at the
sudden sound of the sattere door. The gang stops, wary of this huge
refugee from Barnum's Museum, but the animal is more frightened of them.
It hurries on down the street...
... revealing behind it a group of several dozen RIOTERS who carry a huge
American flag and a long wooden plank bearing the legend "No Draft." They
stare at the Rabbits with something near reverence.
AMSTERDAM
Where's the Native Americans?
RIOTER
Ain't seen them. Ain't here.
AMSTERDAM
And the militia?
RIOTER
There's a detachment coming on from two streets over. The rest is still
north of here. What are you after?
Amsterdam POINTS to a formidable building a block away: the Armory. It
looks like a fortress.
RIOTER
The Devil himself couldn't take that place.
AMSTERDAM
That's why he sent us.
CUT TO
The DETACHMENT of militia proceeds warily towards the Armory. They are a
young, uncertain-looking outfit; their COMMANDER looks like an upstate
farm kid. He tenses and his eyes widen as he sees Jenny walking toward
him, carrying a BOY in her arms.
JENNY
(crying)
Help me. Oh please help me. He's shot, we need a doctor, please help.
DETACHMENT COMMANDER
Miss, we ain't a medical outfit. The main unit's ten minutes behind us,
they'll have...
He doesn't get the chance to finish. Jenny DROPS the Boy from her arms and
shoots the Detachment Commander once, cleanly...
... as the Boy roles into a prone position and FIRES two shots into the
stunned Detachment...
... while the Dead Rabbits SWARM from every doorway along the street,
FIRING GUNS and brandishing weapons.
It's over in seconds. The Detachment has hardly gotten off a shot. Every
one of them lies dead or wounded in the street...
... as the Rabbits CROUCH over their bodies.
CUT TO
A rifle emplacement manned by a dozen GUARDS- They stand anxious post in
front of the Armory. Each window is barred and fortified, and the front
door is massive. But the tension in the Guards' faces eases a little when
they see ...
... the Detachment of militia heading towards them down the street. Some
of the Detachment are wearing bloody uniform jackets; several are being
carried. The Detachment, unrecognized by the Guards, is made up entirely
of Dead Rabbits.
AMSTERDAM
Help us, we got wounded!
GUARD 1
We can't leave the post.
AMSTERDAM
Open the damn doors then! We're bad hurt!
GUARD 1
Where's the others?
AMSTERDAM
Just behind us! But I got our major here wounded so bad half his guts is
out!
Guard 1 SIGNALS for the doors to be opened to the Armory as the Detachment
draws close to the emplacement.
GUARD 1
God, it's good to see you!
AMSTERDAM
Likewise.
Ainsterdam SHOOTS him where he stands as the Rabbits OVERWHELM the
emplacement.
AMSTERDAM
(shouting)
Move fast! We got to get out with everything we can before the militia
gets here!
As the Armory Guards return fire, the Boy Jenny carried in the previous
scene RUNS for the telegraph pole and starts to CLIMB. A SHOT makes the
wood fly inches from his face...
... as the Rabbits storm into the Armory, FIRING wildly.
The Boy reaches the top of the telegraph pole and CUTS the wire. He
shinnies back down the pole as the wire SWINGS ineffectually in the air
and we ...
DISSOLVE TO
A TREMENDOUS VOLLEY of GUNFIRE, as if to illustrate the Tweed theory of
class warfare. Bodies fall in the street. Bodies fall from the Armory. The
building is under siege by the main unit of the MILITIA and by Bill the
Butcher and the Natives. The Dead Rabbits are trapped.
Johnny SNAKES through the Native American lines, over dead bodies, moving
towards Bill, who he sees a hundred yards away...
... running over corpses of comrades and enemies toward the MILITIA
COMMADER. As SHOT WIDENS, the carnage is revealed. Bodies of Natives, in
their uniform dusters, and Rabbits, in their tamlas, lie side by side in
the street.
120 CONTINUED:
FIRING continues from both sides as the Butcher shouts at the Militia
Commander.
BILL THE BUTCHER
We move now and we can drive them out! We press them and they'll break!
MILITIA COMMANDER
I can't spare the men or stand the risk! We stay fast and smoke lem out!
BILL THE BUTCHER
Tweed put me in charge of this! I say we move, and by the crucified Christ
we will move!
(turns to his men)
Native Americans, come with me! Any militia that wants to live upright
instead of die hunkered down, come with us!
Bill STALKS through the lines, rallying the men. And Johnny starts to
FOLLOW.
BILL THE BUTCHER
We'll show you gladiators' greatness! Come on!
The men start to JOIN the Butcher; even some militia fall in. Johnny SLIPS
through the men gathering near the Butcher. He's closer to Bill than ever.
Bill starts to mount their BARRICADE. There is MOVEMENT and commotion all
around him as Natives and militia fall into rough formation. It threatens
to obscure Bill from Johnny's view. Shield him.
He has to make his move. NOW. He DRAWS a revolver as militia and Natives
pass in front of him... he AIMS ... he's anxious, confused ... his HAND
shakes ... he fires... too soon! ...
... and HITS a Native, who falls dead. Right near Bill.
The Butcher turns in the direction of the shot, SEES Johnny. Their eyes
lock. Johnny FIRES again ... WINGS Bill ...
... and Bill SHOOTS him. Johnny FALLS with the first shot. Bill's above
him now, looking down at him.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Was it Tweed or your friend put you to this?
JOHNNY
Tweed.
Bill SHOOTS him again, point blank. Johnny screams.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You'd lie to save your friend.
JOHNNY
(in terrible pain)
No. There's no friends for me.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Me the same. Pity us both.
He EMPTIES his revolver into Johnny.
BILL THE BUTCHER
(to his men)
Hold your fire!
(toward the Armory)
In there! Hey in there! I want to talk to Amsterdam!
The Militia Commander is aghast at this proposition and starts forward,
gun in hand. But a Native STOPS him.
Amsterdam's face APPEARS in a front window of the Armory.
AMSTERDAM
Go on, then, talk.
BILL THE BUTCHER
You and me.
AMSTERDAM
(beat)
Come ahead then. And bring my friend's body.
Bill the Butcher SLINGS Johnny's body over his shoulder as easily as if it
were an empty sack of flour...
... and starts walking thraugh the lines toward the Armory. The Militia
watches in disbelief, the Natives in confusion. The Dead Rabbits keep the
Butcher in their sights. But no one fires. No one moves.
And Bill the Butcher enters the front doors of the Armory.
CUT TO
Bill walks alone toward the Native/militia lines.
From inside... from every window ... the Dead Rabbits watch him.
The sun is high, but the street is eerily quiet. There are FARAWAY SOUNDS
of battle, but here there is only the sound of distant, unheard
conversation between Bill, the Militia Commander and some Natives.
Amsterdam WATCHES intently.
The Butcher and the Militia Commander argue, but we still can't hear what
they're saying. There is still no sound...
... until, SUDDENLY, we see the Militia Commander's face. Huge. EYES WIDE
with surprise as we HEAR the thunderclap of a SHOT.
Bill the Butcher has just gutshot the Militia Commander.
As if the shot were a signal, the Natives TURN on the militia. It's
hellish, close-quarter combat. Guns fired inches from enemies who had just
been allies. Knives, swords, bludgeons, kids with dead-rat blackjacks,
women with hob-nailed wooden planks, attacking better-armed but totally
stunned soldiers.
Bill the Butcher falls back toward the Armory, the Natives following him.
Inside the Armory, Amsterdam turns to his own greatly diminished gang.
AMSTERDAM
Go ahead them, give them cover! Give them some damn cover!
The Rabbits are so stunned to be fighting on the same side as their sworn
enemies that, even with Amsterdam's order, no one makes a move. It's
Amsterdam who FIRES the first shots. And that unleashes a great VOLLEY
from the Armory...
... toward the militia.
The Butcher and the Natives are closer to the Armory now... and the Armory
doors start to open...
... when a MILITIA LIEUTENANT SIGNALS ...
... and MILITIA on the surrounding roofs, waiting for this moment,
suddenly open fire...on the Natives below and on the Rabbits on the roof
of the armory. Many drop in the street and fall from the Armory roof...
... as the Armory doors SWING WIDE to admit the Natives. As they run or
stagger inside, the Rabbits start to close the doors. Some Rabbits are cut
down by the fire from the rooftops. Other Natives never make it to the
doors. And a few are shot...
... when the doors close before they can get through.
CUT TO
The Dead Rabbits keep firing, but they have sustained grave losses. The
Butcher looks around at the Natives who have made it inside with him: he
has perhaps one-quarter of his original strength.
BILL THE BUTCHER
Well, it seems like between us we got two mobs that might make a gang.
AMSTERDAM
Whose gang might it be?
BILL THE BUTCHER
Not William Tweed's.
Jimmy Spoils and a crew of Natives PUSH a cannon toward the rear of the
Armory.
AMSTERDAM
Which way you pointing that?
JIMMY SPOILS
Any way you say. One direction could let us out, the other will let them
in.
BILL THE BUTCHER
They got to come in if we're going to fight them.
AMSTERDAM
Who do you want to fight, Bill?
Amsterdam MOTIONS toward the rear wall and Jimmy swings the cannon around.
Everything surrounding them is MOVEMENT and COMMOTION as the remaining
members of both gangs TAKE whatever weapons they can carry from the Armory
stockpile...
... and Jenny steps forward with a torch, LIGHTING the fuse of the
cannon...
... which ROARS and BLOWS a huge hole in the rear wall of the Armory.
AMSTERDAM
(to Bill the Butcher)
See you in the street.
The gang members RUSH for the opening, carrying whatever they can manage.
Outside, the MILITIA LIEUTENANT hears the cannon blast... sees no damage
to the front of the building... and SIGNALS for a frontal ASSAULT on the
Armory.
HIGH ANGLE FROM ABOVE, CAMERA MOVING as the militia CHARGES ... following
them forward, then moving ahead to the Armory
... SHOOTING straight down inside (no roof or ceiling) as the Gangs HURTLE
through the still-smoldering hole in the wall ...
... and drop twenty feet to an alley below...
... where militia on the roof try to pick them off. As the militia presses
closer from the front, gang defenses start to fall back inside the Armory.
Everyone wants to get through that hole.
Amsterdam, Jenny, Jimmy Spoils and some of the other gang nembers are
carrying TORCHES. Jenny HANDS a torch to the Butcher. Amsterdam MOTIONS
them all toward the back of the Armory.
But he stays behind. Just for a moment. He BENDS over the crumpled body of
Johnny Sirocco, ARRANGES it, folding JOHNNY'S HANDS across his chest.
AMSTERDAM
You'll have a warrior's funeral anyway, John.
He STANDS and RUNS for the hole in the wall, where Jenny and the others
stand waiting.
He TURNS, takes a last look inside the Armory. The militia is BATTERING
DOWN the front doors. Then he raises his TORCH over his head... and HURLS
it through the air. Jenny and the others do the same.
His single torch BLAZES a path of light across the screen. The others,
JOINING it, make a fiery CONSTELLATION.
CUT TO
As Jenny, Jimmy Spoils, Bill the Butcher and Amsterdam HURTLE through the
hole into the alley below...
... and start to run through the withering GUNFIRE of the militia on the
roof...
... getting away... just barely away.
As Jenny runs, her swag drops and FALLS from under her clothes. She TURNS
to pick it up but Amsterdam PULLS her on....
... and just away from the titanic EXPLOSION of the Armory. The CONCUSSION
throws some of the militia from their perches on the roof. It sends a
fountain of FLAME and RUBBLE high into the sky. It is VOLCANIC in its
brilliance and intensity. The sky turns BLACK with powder, BLAZING ORANGE
with flame.
In the small streets BEHIND THE ARMORY, many gang members are CRUSHED by
debris or burned by FIREBALLS breaking off from the central flame.
The Armory is gone. Much of the surrounding area is gone with it.
On the ground, everything is smoke, flame, dirt, death, confusion, Corpses
everywhere. Gang members and kids running all over, desperate. It looks
like the last day of mankind on earth.
Bill the Butcher HELPS a couple of fallen Natives, then SEES through the
smoke and flame and storm of ash ... Amsterdam.
Coming towards him.
BILL THE BUTCHER
We're finished, all of us.
AMSTERDAM
But you and me ain't settled.
BILL THE BUTCHER
We got the same now, a full share of nothing. There's nothing to settle.
There's nothing left.
Amsterdam takes a weapon from his pocket, OPENS it for the Butcher to see:
it is the pirate's knife which the Butcher used to kill Priest Vallon.
AMSTERDAM
Then let's start over.
Bill the Butcher looks tired, sorrowful. He BURIES his face wearily in his
arms. And for a moment we think he has given everything up. Amsterdam
MOVES toward him, throu
