                        The good news is he's breathing
                        on his own and there's no sign of

          Dark circles are forming under Sarah's eyes.  She's running
          on caffeine, not much food and even less sleep.  She's
          been through this before so when she asks the next question
          it is with a dread of the potential answer:

                                        SARAH
                          Shouldn't he be waking up? 

                                        DR. GIBSON
                                (sympathetic)
                          Sarah... he's in a coma.

          Off Sarah's reaction...



          JOHNNY has his long legs folded under him as he sits
            uncomfortably at a short coffee table.  He and BRUCE are
          playing SORRY, a ragged board game from the hospital's
            well-used collection, with Little Johnny.  J.J. rolls the
          dice and moves.  He lands on one of Bruce's pieces and
          sends it back home.

                                        BRUCE
                        Not again.

                                        LITTLE JOHNNY
                                  (delighted)
                        Sorry!

                                        JOHNNY
                        The kid's ruthless, Bruce.

                                        BRUCE
                        Loaded dice, man.

                                        LITTLE JOHNNY
                        No they're not.

                                        BRUCE
                        Oh no?  You callin' me a liar?

          Bruce playfully gives J.J. some shit.  J.J. LAUGHS.  Johnny
          stares at J.J. for a moment, wondering if the boy will
          ever be this carefree again.  Wondering if it's his fault.

          Sarah enters.

                                        SARAH
                        Hey.

          Little Johnny looks up hopefully.

                        Can I see dad?

          Sarah takes a deep breath, pulls a chair over and sits

          down across from him.

                                        SARAH
                        Yeah, of course you can.  But, I
                        need to talk to you first.
                                (glances at Johnny)
                        After your dad got hurt the other
                        night, the doctors helped him...
                        get better.  They did everything
                        they could for now.  But, he needs
                        to do some more mending himself
                        so he's, he's... still sleeping.

          Sarah looks up and meets Johnny's eyes. 

                                        LITTLE JOHNNY
                        When will he wake up?  We've got
                        a game on Sunday.

                                        SARAH
                        Well then let's hope for Sunday.

          Bruce and Johnny exchange a glance.  Sarah gives Little
          Johnny a brave smile.



          Dr. Gibson is there as Sarah and Little Johnny enter...
          Bruce and Johnny behind them, hanging back by the door. 
          Little Johnny approaches the bed.  Dr. Gibson joins him*
          with her best bedside manner smile.

                                        DR. GIBSON
                        I know the bandages might look a
                        little scary, but he's still just
                        your dad underneath... and I'm
                        sure he'd love to hear your voice.


          CLOSE ON LITTLE JOHNNY

          and his eyes can't disguise the stunning impact as we
          move to reveal Walt; his face is bruised; his shoulder
          and ribs are wrapped.  A large white bandage is on his
          head.

                                        LITTLE JOHNNY*

          ON JOHNNY

          at the door watching this heartbreaking scene, knowing
          Walt is going to die.  Gibson moves to him to give Sarah
          and the boy some private moments with Walt...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (sotto, to the doc)
                        Can I talk to you?

          They move out to the corridor with Bruce... we stay a
          beat with:

                                        LITTLE JOHNNY
                        You really think he can hear us,
                        Mom?

                                        SARAH
                        Yes, I really do.



          Bruce, Johnny and Gibson... talking quietly... in mid-
            conversation...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hear me out.  There was this great
                        kid, a hockey player, I touched
                        him and I just knew he had a heart
                          condition... I saw something a
                        doctor couldn't see.  Maybe I can
                        do it again.

                                        DR. GIBSON
                        Do what again, Johnny?  We've
                        identified his injuries.  We've
                        done everything for him we know
                        how to do...

                                        JOHNNY*
                        Doc, if we don't do something,*
                        he's going to die.  I've seen it.*

          That thought lingers in their eyes as Sarah and Little
          Johnny come out of the room... Sarah maintaining her brave
          smile...

                                        SARAH
                        We can visit him tomorrow,
                        sweetie... they'll call us if he
                        wakes up before then...

          But she sees the impromptu conference taking place in the
          hallway, her eyes connect with Johnny's and the doctor's;
          she didn't hear the death line but she knows something's
          up...

                                        DR. GIBSON
                        Mrs. Bannerman, could we have a
                        minute with you?

          But it's hard to talk with the child there... and Bruce
          comes to the rescue... he takes Little Johnny by the
          hand...

                                        BRUCE
                        Come on, Johnny... you owe me a
                        rematch... and I'm checkin' your*
                        sleeves this time...*

          They move away... off Sarah's look...

                                        DR. GIBSON
                        Johnny wants permission to use*
                        his powers to... diagnose Walt.*

          Sarah looks curiously at Johnny...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I might find out something that
                        could help... I can't promise
                          anything but...

          And Sarah can almost sense that they're not telling her
            everything...

                                        SARAH
                        Do you know?  Do you know what's

          She knows he's lying because he hasn't been able to lie
          to her for thirty years.  And he knows she knows.  A lump
          forms in her throat, making it hard to swallow.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I just think I should try.

          Their eyes connect for a long beat...

                                        SARAH
                        Okay.

          Dr. Gibson finally nods.



          Johnny's eyes are fixed on Walt, who has EEG leads attached
          to his head.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I've never seen him so still.

          Sarah and Dr. Gibson are standing a little further back,
          as if to give Johnny room to work.

                        I know.  Seems like he's always
                        in motion.

          Dr. Gibson is at a bit of a loss.  It's hard for a board-
            certified physician to hand over the reins to a psychic.

                                        DR. GIBSON
                        Do you need me to do anything--

          Johnny shakes his head silently as he reaches out and
          grasps Walt's hand.  RAMP TO HIS FACE...



          Johnny finds himself standing in a familiar mine shaft
          (from "Descent").  It's dark, damp and spooky.  He looks
          around in disbelief.  He's surrounded by mumbling,
            incomprehensible, whispering LOW PITCHED VOICES... a dozen
          overlapping conversations we can't quite hear... The CAMERA
          zips around him in a dizzying 180, showing us that he
          stands in a central area in the mine.  Several dark
          pathways branch off from here.

                        It was like a rollercoaster.  I
                        was just trying to hold onto my
                        hat.

          Collecting himself... grim...

                                        JOHNNY
                        But I didn't find a way... I can't
                        help.

                                        DR. GIBSON
                        Are you sure?

          Sarah and Johnny look to her...  Dr. Gibson RIPS a piece
          of paper off of a monitoring device.  It's the wavy line
          of Walt's EEG.  Johnny and Sarah look at the EEG.  The
          line is a small steady series of bumps until it spikes. 
            Foothills meet Everest.

                                        DR. GIBSON
                        This spike is you, Johnny.  It's
                        the moment you touched him.

          Johnny's head is buried in his hands, but he looks up
          hesitantly.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I did that?  How?

                                        DR. GIBSON
                        I have no idea.  But this is the
                        first -- and only -- good sign
                        we've had.

          Sarah looks at Johnny, daring to hope.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                              ACT ONE

          FADE IN:


          Johnny is lying on an exam table as Sarah enters...

                                        SARAH
                        How's the headache?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Better.  How's Johnny doing?

                                        SARAH
                          I finally got him home to bed. 
                        Mrs. Clark is staying with him. 
                        She'll call me when he wakes up.
                                (Johnny acknowledges)
                        And... I've been waking up the
                        top neurosurgeons all over New
                          England.  Amazingly enough, I
                        happen to have the home phone
                        numbers of every coma specialist
                        in a five hundred mile radius.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Leaving no stone unturned.

                                        SARAH
                        Again.

          An ironic memory passes through the room.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The doc's given me the green light
                        to try again... we're waiting
                        while my dead zone has a chance
                        to regroup.  

                                        SARAH
                        Thank-you.
                                (for what you're doing)

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's a good man, Sarah.  

          She nods.  They look at each other a beat.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: ASCENT - ACT ONE - 10/24/02 WHITE          11.

          And this is getting just a little too close to other things
          in their lives so she quickly moves the conversation back
          into facts and factoids.

                                        SARAH
                        Dr. Gibson says it's too soon to
                        bring in the bucket of ice.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Ice?

                                        SARAH
                                (grins)
                          Sometimes coma patients wake up
                        when you dump a bucket of ice on
                        their chest.  It's supposed to
                          stimulate the brain... 

                                        JOHNNY
                                (reacts, beat)
                        You didn't... 

                                        SARAH
                        What...

                        Toss a bucket of ice on me when I
                        was...

                                        SARAH
                        The hell I didn't... once a week
                        for a month...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Now I know why I remember feeling
                        really, really cold.  I guess I'm
                        just a psychic bucket of ice where
                        Walt's concerned.
                                (beat, thinking)
                        My mind... it knows what it's
                        like to be in a coma, Sarah. 
                        Maybe it knows the way out too.

          Off Sarah's face...



          Sarah watches through the window as monitoring equipment
          is hooked up to Johnny and Walt, lying side by side, by
            technicians.  Plugs are plugged.

                        We're on your cue, Johnny.

          Johnny acknowledges, takes a deep breath.  Walt's arm
          rests on a cushion.  Johnny reaches out and touches it. 
          RAMP INTO HIS FACE.

  2525RESUME FLYING SUBJECTIVE POV THROUGH THE MINE SHAFT

            rocketing for a couple of seconds... and then...



          As seen in earlier subjective flash; this time: Johnny/Walt
          stands at an automated soup/coffee/cocoa machine.  He
          sniffs the steaming cup the machine dispenses and grimaces. 
          He turns and finds himself face to face with Sarah.  She
          looks tired but she's still radiant.  Johnny/Walt is
          smitten.  She catches him staring, smiles at him for the
          very first time.  A magic moment!

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                          Careful.  I just got a tomato
                        soup with half and half.

          Sarah, the hospital veteran, pushes a sticky button on
          the machine several times.

                                        SARAH
                        Yeah.  The half and half button
                        sticks so you need to clear
                        everything first.

          Sarah waits for Johnny/Walt to move, but he doesn't. 
          Sarah finally looks at Johnny/Walt... really looks at
          him. She may be sitting vigil for her coma-bound love,
          but there's something about this tall, reserved guy that
          she likes.

                                        SARAH
                        I'm just gonna... try for some
                        coffee here.

          Johnny/Walt shakes it off and steps out of her way.  He
          walks back to a table where his father is waiting for
          him.  This is JOE BANNERMAN, Walt's father.  He has
          thinning gray hair and twinkling brown eyes.  A man whose
          laugh lines most likely come from a lifetime of teasing
          pretty girls.


          ANGLE ON JOHNNY/WALT AND JOE:

          Johnny/Walt sits down; he's still smiling...

                                        JOE
                        What's with the face?

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                        I just met the most beautiful
                        woman.

          Joe watches Sarah get her coffee.  He frowns.

                                        JOE
                        Yeah, she's something all right. 
                        I've seen her here before.  She's
                        got a fella in a coma.

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                        Oh yeah?

                                        JOE
                        Girl's got baggage, Wally.

          Walt looks over in Sarah's direction, but instead of seeing
          her, we SWISH PAN TO:



          We look through a doorway into Johnny's coma room.  Sarah
          is sitting silent vigil near the foot of Johnny's bed (we
          don't see Johnny).  Sarah's strength is wavering; a tear
          rolls down her face.  Gene Purdy is there; he comforts
          her.

          As we pull back for a wider view, we see...



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: ASCENT - ACT ONE - REV. 11/13/02 GOLD     16A.


    27ACONTINUED:27A


          Johnny/Walt is walking down the hospital hallway when he
          notices the door marked "Smith, J"

          Johnny/Walt pauses in the doorway when he sees Sarah inside
          crying.  Sarah and Purdy don't see him.

          CLOSE ON: Johnny/Walt.

                                        SARAH (O.S.)
                        I got a call for Sarah Bracknell
                        today.  A wake up call. 

          And move to reveal that Johnny/Walt is now in...          DEAD ZONE: ASCENT - ACT ONE - REV. 11/04/02 GRN       17.



          Seen earlier in subjective pov.  The kitchen is shadowed. 
            Everything's in its place.  Sarah sits at the kitchen
          table staring into her empty coffee cup.  Johnny/Walt has
          just entered, sits with her at the table.

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                        What're you talking about?

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny woke up.

          Johnny/Walt is stunned.  He's literally at a loss for
          words.  In that instant, we realize no one thought Johnny
          was ever going to wake up.

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                        Is he okay?  I mean... functioning?
                        Does he remember things?

                                        SARAH
                          Apparently, he remembers
                          everything.  Like it was yesterday.

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                        Oh...

                        How can I face him? 


  2929EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF JOHNNY/WALT 

          losing Sarah as he takes that in... he doesn't know how
          to answer, but he can feel the tectonic plates of his
          life shifting.  Johnny/Walt exhales...

          As seen earlier in a subjective flash.  Johnny/Walt shifts
          out of park as if he'd like to rip the gearstick out and
          beat someone with it.

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                        Dad, she's in shock.  Hell, we
                        both are.  Her old boyfriend just
                        came out of a six-year coma.

          Johnny/Walt looks up at Joe, who's sitting in the passenger
          seat.

                                        JOE
                        Wally, he's not just some
                        boyfriend.  They were engaged. 
                          Childhood sweethearts and all
                        that. 

          Johnny/Walt pulls out and soon we see that they're driving
          along a picturesque wooded road.

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                        This isn't really helping. 

                                        JOE
                        No.  It's the kind of help you
                        don't want.  It's the truth. 
                        During the war, a lotta men didn't
                        come home, but their wives never
                        got bodies or... whaddya call
                        it... closure.

                        What's your point?

                                        JOE
                        Her feelings for this fella never
                        died.  She tied 'em up in a ribbon
                        and put 'em in a drawer. 

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                        But, I know she loves me.

                                        JOE
                        Ayuh.  Pregnant girl.  No
                        boyfriend.  'Course she loved
                        you.  You rode in like a knight
                        in shinin' armor.

          CLOSE ON JOHNNY/WALT'S FACE: Joe's words are playing on
          his own deep-seated fears.  His world is falling apart.


          ANGLE PAST JOHNNY/WALT THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

          to see they're driving into a tunnel... as the darkness
          swallows them up....



          dressed in his own clothes... standing as he was in his
          first time here... in an intersection of tunnels... the
          chorus of weird, spooky mumbling, whispering voices
          surrounding him again... he's disoriented... uncertain of
          what's happening...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (calling)
                        Walt?

          His voice echoes.  No response.  Just those damn mumbling,
          whispering voices we can't quite hear clearly... and now
          Johnny reacts as he sees --


          NEW ANGLE - JOHNNY IN FOREGROUND

          EERY TENDRILS OF LIGHT DRIFT DOWN THE TUNNEL TOWARDS HIM

          Johnny's face is bathed in the warm, glow of the light. 
          Fascinated, he watches it approach.  It forms a wall which
          shimmers like a silk curtain in a breeze.  And as it
          touches him we may be surprised to see his face blossom
          into unmistakable pleasure - the light feels good - almost
          sexual - as it wraps itself around him... embracing him... 
          DAMN, THIS FEELS GOOOOD... Johnny reaches out and touches
          the wall.  He reacts as if he's just touched a new texture
          of sea creature; he's fascinated, delighted and a bit
            repulsed.  And then Johnny feels his arm being pulled in. 
          He frowns.  It's like a vertical wall of quicksand trying
          to suck him in.          DEAD ZONE: ASCENT - ACT ONE - 10/24/02 WHITE          20.



          Johnny's back ARCHES like he's having a seizure.

                          Doctor...?!



          as Gibson checks monitor read-outs which are going crazy...

                                        DR. GIBSON
                          Separate them.  Now!

          The NURSE pulls Johnny's hand away from Walt's arm.  Johnny
          JERKS AWAKE.  He's nearly hyperventilating.  His eyes
          blink rapidly as if he can't wake up fully.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why... why'd you pull me out?

          Before anyone answers... blood starts to spill out of one
          nostril... his hand instinctively dabs it... he sees the
          blood on his hand and on his reaction... as medics move
          to apply a compress...

    3333JOHNNY'S FACE IS BATHED IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT AGAIN

          He seems to be lying down in a dark tunnel.

          BUT THEN THE BRIGHT LIGHT FOCUSES and BECOMES THE GUIDE
          LINES OF A CAT SCAN.  THEY ETCH A GRID ON JOHNNY SMITH'S
          HEAD. HE'S LYING IN A TUNNEL OF SORTS -- A CAT SCAN TUBE.


          ANGLE

          In the adjoining control room through the window, we may
          see a concerned Dr. Gibson observing.



          Sarah waits as the procedure continues.  She looks up to
          see GENE PURDY walking down the hall.  He hugs her with
          compassion.

                                        PURDY
                        How's Walt?

                        The doctor says the swelling's
                          actually going down.  He should
                        be waking up...

                                        PURDY
                        But he's not.

          She shakes her head.

                                        PURDY
                        We've been through this before,

                        What can I say, Sarah...

                                        SARAH
                        I wish you could say "April Fools".

                                        PURDY
                        You're in my prayers. *

          And that's a genuine offer from a man who knows people
          and knows Sarah is carrying a lot of guilt right now... 
          does he suspect what's been going on between her and
          Johnny?  You bet.  But all he cares about right now is
          helping her through a crisis.  She acknowledges with
            appreciation.

          Johnny comes out of the cat scan room... wearing a hospital
          gown that opens in the back... he's holding it closed
          behind him... Purdy reacts to seeing him in a gown...

                          hospital gown that doesn't
                        completely humiliate you. 

                                        SARAH
                        How do you feel?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It was just a bloody nose... I
                        don't know why everyone's so...

                                (reacts)
                          A bloody nose?  As a consequence

                        Walt's brain...

          But before Purdy can react, Gibson comes out of her control*
          room with results...

          Johnny's calm voice brings everyone back to the big issue.

          And exits.   Off Purdy's concerned reaction...

          buzz of activity.  Sarah is in bed with her draped legs
          up in stirrups. 

          Johnny/Walt sits holding her hand beside her as the female
          DOCTOR guides Sarah through the final stage of labor. 

                                        DOCTOR
                        Now.  Push.

            Johnny/Walt's hand is squeezed to the bone as Sarah PUSHES
          for all she's worth.  The doctor grins in triumph as she
          pulls the baby all the way out and clips the umbilical.

          A NURSE steps forward to clean the baby up.  She holds it
          up for Johnny/Walt and Sarah to see.

                                        DOCTOR
                        You've got a handsome little boy.

          Sarah SMILES radiantly.  Johnny/Walt looks from the baby
          back to her.  His smile hinges on hers.


          ANGLE ON JOHNNY/WALT AND SARAH: AS THE BABY IS LAID IN
          SARAH'S ARMS.

                                        DOCTOR
                        Do you have a name picked out?

          Sarah looks to Johnny/Walt.  Johnny/Walt speaks for them
          both.

                                          JOHNNY/WALT

          and they're --

                        I was leaving my fiancee's house. 
                        And I was in a coma for six years.

  4343EXTREME CLOSE-UP ON JOHNNY/WALT'S REACTION

          turning out to see he's standing at the door of --



          ...looking at Sarah... who's at her jewelry box and this
          is just a few weeks ago... she opens A CLEAR PLASTIC EGG
          (the kind you get out of a gumball machine) and takes out
          a small plastic trinket ring.  (NOTE: This is the ring
          Johnny won for her at the fair).  Sarah stares at the
          ring.

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                        What's that?

          She looks up, surprised at being caught, laughs...

                                        SARAH
                          Nothing.  Just an old keepsake. 
                        I don't know what it's doing in
                        here... 

          She puts it away and casually closes the drawer as...

                        Her feelings for this fella never
                        died.  She tied 'em up in a ribbon
                        and put 'em in a drawer.

          And we move to reveal we're back in -- 



                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                        But, I know she loves me.

                        boyfriend.  'Course she loved
                        you.  You rode in like a knight
                        in shinin' armor.  Now she's not
                        so desperate... and you're in the
                        way...


          ANGLE THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

          to see the tunnel up ahead... but this time as the darkness
          swallows them up, we stay with them in the car...

          Johnny and Joe are face to face.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're not his father.

                        And your father.  And everyone's
                        father.  We've met before, John. 
                        You don't remember?

          Off Johnny's even stare...

                        No, I suppose not.  I'm like the
                        dream that slips out of memory
                        when you wake up.  No one really
                        wants to remember meeting me.

                        his misery... And you always

          wall of light -- it's a virtual recreation of Johnny's
          vision at the end of Act One: Walt's face is bathed in
          the warm, glow of the light.  Fascinated, he watches it
            approach.  It shimmers like a silk curtain in a breeze. 
          And as it touches him, his face blossoms into unmistakable
          pleasure...

  4949EXTREME CLOSE-UP ON WALT

          as he remembers... and we move to find Johnny and Walt
          standing in...



          The scene we've seen before.  It's the night Walt first
          met Sarah in the hospital cafeteria.  Sarah is at the
            machines, Joe is sitting at a table...

                                        WALT
                        Yeah, I remember.  My dad and I
                        were visiting Grandma Helen after
                        her stroke.  We came in here for
                        coffee.  That's when I saw her...
                        and it was one of those things,
                        you know... I knew... I knew from
                        the moment I saw her...

          Sarah walks in the door and moves toward the machines...

                        They say people don't fall in
                        love at first sight... don't you

                        You mean, I can...?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sure you can... who's stopping
                        you?

          Walt looks at Johnny... exchanges a look with his dad...

          he moves tentatively into the scene, seamlessly joining
          it in progress, like a perfect entrance into a stage
          production. 

          Walt gets his soup then turns.  Sarah looks tired but
          she's still radiant.  Walt is smitten.  She catches him
          staring, smiles at him for the very first time.  A magic
          moment!

                                        WALT
                          Careful.  I just got a tomato
                        soup with half and half.

          Sarah, the hospital veteran, pushes a sticky button on
          the machine several times.

                                        SARAH
                        Yeah.  The half and half button
                        sticks so you need to clear
                        everything first.

          Sarah waits for Walt to move, but he doesn't.  Sarah
          finally looks at Walt... really looks at him.  She may be
          sitting vigil for her coma-bound love, but there's
            something about this tall, reserved guy that she likes.

                                        SARAH
                        I'm just gonna... try for some
                        coffee here.

          watching the scene...

                        Clever.

                        Can we agree on one thing?
                                (off Johnny's look)
                        Let's keep this civil - you don't
                        want to get him upset at a time
                        like this; neither do I.

                        Fair enough.

                        To be honest, I'm a little
                          surprised that you of all people
                        would be trying to bring him back.

                        It's nice to know you can be
                        surprised.

                          Sometimes the right thing is just
                        to let them go... find peace...

                          wouldn't like peace.  

          Walt walks back to the table.  Joe seamlessly turns to
          Walt and continues the scene from memory.  Walt doesn't
          even seem to notice Johnny.

  5050EXTREME CLOSE-UP ON WALT

                                        SARAH (O.S.)
                        I got a call for Sarah Bracknell
                        today.  A wake up call.

          And move to reveal that Walt is now in...



          Seen earlier.  Sarah sits at the kitchen table staring
          into her empty coffee cup.  Walt has just entered, sits
          with her at the table.  Johnny and Joe stand there
            observing...

                                        WALT
                        What're you talking about?

                        Johnny woke up.

          Walt is stunned.  He's literally at a loss for words.

                                        JOE
                          Remember how you felt at that
                        moment, Wally?

          And we could discuss freezing action in scenes as dialogue
            continues with Johnny and Joe and Walt but I'd just as
          soon not -- we can just lose Sarah in a new angle and see
          Walt sitting at the table with Joe and Johnny behind him...
          but Walt should not look directly at Joe or Johnny; he
          should be looking at the scene...

                                        WALT
                        Like my world was coming to an
                        end.

                        But who could blame her... she
                        loved Johnny her whole life...
                        she even kept that ring he gave
                        her the night of the accident...

          And this time, it's perfectly acceptable to use Joe as
          our transition device... moving from his close-up into...

          a few weeks ago... she opens A CLEAR PLASTIC EGG (the
          kind you get out of a gumball machine) and takes out a
          small plastic trinket ring.  (NOTE: This is the ring Johnny
          won for her at the fair).  Sarah stares at the ring.

                          Nothing.  Just an old keepsake. 
                        I don't know what it's doing in

                        What are you talking about?  I
                        know my own dad...

                                        JOE (O.S.)
                        Ready, Walt?

          The first light leak in the sheriff's office appears...           DEAD ZONE: ASCENT - ACT FOUR - REV. 11/04/02 GRN      48.



          The TECHNICIAN who's bagging Johnny shakes his head.

                                        TECHNICIAN
                        He's going into v-fib.

          Dr. Gibson waves away the bag and checks Johnny's carotid
          pulse.  She frowns and gives him a precordial thump to
          the chest.  Checks his pulse again.

                                        DR. GIBSON
                        Still no pulse.  Start CPR and
                        charge paddles to 200.

          Dr. Gibson SHOCKS Johnny.  As she frowns at the result, 
          ANOTHER ALARM GOES OFF... THIS ONE FROM WALT'S BEDSIDE...

                                        TECHNICIAN
                                (re: Walt)
                          Doctor!?  He's in v-fib too.

          Walt's monitor shows his heart is fibrillating...

                                        DR. GIBSON
                          Jesus... call another code blue
                        and get a team in here stat.

          A nurse runs to get help.



          Walt is standing up, ready to go...

                                        WALT
                        Well, it's been a good run, huh...

                        A great run, Wally... a great
                        life...

                                        WALT
                        So... what happens now... I mean
                        I've always wondered.  I guess we
                        all have...

                                        JOE
                        Words can't describe it.

          The light termites punch leaks in the wall... Johnny knows
          time is running out... Joe and Walt pay no attention...
          Walt pauses to pick up a picture of Sarah and J.J.

                        Walt, he's trying to make this
                        easy for you... and it shouldn't
                        be easy... it's been three days,
                        Walt... three days... and you're
                        ready to move on?  I hung on for
                        six years!  

                                        JOE
                        He's just trying to get your goat
                        now, Wally.  
                                (to Johnny, chastising)
                        I asked you not to upset him.

          Joe senses Johnny is moving in a direction he really
          doesn't want this to go... Walt is still back on the
          question of holding on...

                        I just don't want her to have to
                        go through that again, you know

                        knowing if I'm dead or alive... I
                        love her too much to do that to
                        her... better for Sarah and J.J.

          Walt's ready... he looks to Johnny...

                        You're not a bad guy, John.

          He reaches out to shake hands... Johnny doesn't offer
          his... the termites are really getting to the wall now...
          but Johnny's been thinking and he's made a decision...

                        Maybe I am, Walt.  You know that

                        anymore...  Sarah brought it over
                        to the house a few weeks ago to
                        give it back...

                        That ring really dredged up some
                          memories, you know... and one
                        thing led to another and...

                        For old times sake... she was
                          leaving, I grabbed her arm and
                        pulled her to the floor...

          And he steps back and slugs Johnny on the jaw... Johnny
          falls halfway across the room and pain never felt so
          good...

          should almost feel like one long PAN shot as Walt and
          Johnny -- and observer Joe -- tussle their way through.)

          Walt charges Johnny, taking them both through the glass
          window of the office and into...



          Walt and Johnny land in a shower of broken glass.  The
          white light termites are still working here, but losing
          power.  Joe watches the men fighting, worried that his
          fish is wriggling off the hook.

          Walt punches Johnny in the stomach.  His knees buckle. 
          Walt grabs Johnny and throws him over the couch into...



          Johnny flies into the pile of boulders which marked the
          cave-in that sparked this odyssey.  Walt approaches and
          gets a swift kick in the stomach from Johnny.

          The fight continues, but Joe looks disappointed.  He senses
          he's lost.  Behind him, the white light holes in the cave
          walls begin to close up... retreating.



          The medical teams still working feverishly... there are
          several people working on Johnny and Walt.

                                        SARAH*
                        You sure you're ready?

                                        WALT
                        Yeah.  If I don't get out of here,*
                        I'm gonna lose it.

                                        LITTLE JOHNNY
                        I taped the double-oh-seven
                          marathon for you, dad...

                                        WALT
                        Excellent.  I was worried about
                        that.*

          They see Johnny approaching, holding a bottle of champagne*
          in an ice bucket...


          ANGLE

          as they reach each other...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Oh, man, I'm late.   

          Johnny hands the champagne and bucket to Sarah...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Try and keep the ice in the bucket
                        this time.

          Walt looks curiously at them...

                                        SARAH
                        I'll explain in the car.

                                        WALT*
                        Hey John... you wouldn't believe
                        the dreams I've been having...

                                        JOHNNY
                        What kind of dreams?

                                        WALT
                        About you and me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah?

                                        DR. GIBSON
                        It's not unusual for former coma
                          patients to have vivid dreams for
                          a while...*

                                        WALT
                        Your mind really plays tricks on
                        you in there, I guess.

          And as Walt stares at Johnny, we wonder just what those
          dreams revealed.

                        Why don't you come over for dinner,
                        help us drink the champagne.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I've got... plans.  But, thanks.

                                        SARAH
                        We'll save it for you...

          She smiles, a thaw in their relationship growing out of
          this experience... a new bond with Walt... as they move
          ahead, Johnny watches them go a beat... Little Johnny
          runs to catch up...
