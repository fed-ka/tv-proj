Brad is tossing and turning, trying to sleep. He hears a 
noise. He sits up - listens. Nothing.

He lies back down - when he hears a CRASH from downstairs.

BRAD

Brad pulls himself out of bed, shivering slightly. He walks 
slowly to the door.

BRAD (CONT D)
Kate, is that you?

Jackie steps into the doorframe.

Kate looks up - Diane and Mrs. Steinberg are still chatting. 
They didn t notice. 

Kate makes a split-second decision, and pulls away. As she 
does she sees, standing in a doorway: Nelson, staring right 
at her.
