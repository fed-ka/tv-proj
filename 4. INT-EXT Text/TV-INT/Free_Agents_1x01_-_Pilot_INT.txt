      Dark. Then a lamp reveals Alex and Helen, who have just had 
      sex for the first time. Silence, which Alex fills, awkwardly--

                                ALEX
                So, what happens now? First time I ve 
                had casual sex this century, so...
                      (off Helen s silence)
                Not that last century was packed with 
                casual sex. I can barely remember the 
                last time I made love to someone I 
                didn t have at least a mortgage with.

                                HELEN
                We could take out a small loan 
                  together, if that would make you more 
                  comfortable.

                                ALEX
                No, it s okay--

                                HELEN
                Well, I m honored to be your first 
                  meaningless screw of the millennium.

                                ALEX
                Oh, no, I didn t...this s going well. 
                See, I figured you say something like, 
                 what re you thinking?  and I d say 
                  something like,  I m thinking, can I 
                make it to my clothes without you 
                noticing I have no abs.  Which you 
                probably won t think is funny.
                      (she doesn t)
                You ll just think it s a juvenile way 
                of avoiding a serious question. To 
                quote my ex-wife--

                                HELEN
                I ll call you a cab.

      She opens a drawer, roots. Alex sees it s full of condoms.

                                ALEX
                That s impressive. In my limited 
                  experience, I never got past the three 
                pack. That s making a statement--

                                ALEX
                No, like,  This is 2011, I m an 
                  independent woman and I can buy a 
                hundred condoms and that doesn t make 
                me a slut or anything--

      Helen puts the phone down. Turns to Alex.

                                HELEN
                Is that what I was saying?

                                ALEX
                I m not editorializing. It s great--

                                HELEN
                Or was I saying,  This is 2010 and I m 
                going to buy condoms to have sex with 
                my fiance? 

      Alex winces. Looks above the bed, where there is a large 
        professional portrait of a handsome thirty-something MAN. 

                                ALEX
                With--

                                HELEN
                Pete. Yes.

      Alex looks around -- more similar photos decorate the room. 

                                ALEX
                Right. And Pete and Pete, and Pete--

                                HELEN
                I know, they re a bit much, but we had 
                them done just before he died.

                                ALEX
                No, I m not--I m sorry--

                                HELEN
                What the hell.  What re you thinking?

                I m thinking, it was my son s birthday 
                Sunday and I wasn t with my kids.

      Alex stares into space, tearing up. A beat, and Helen dials.

                Hi, I need a cab, please?

      ALEX slumps at the conference table with a few others. DAN --

                You got some? Back on the horse? Tell.

      Behind him HELEN enters, now in crisp business attire.

      STEPHEN -- Dayton group CEO, 50, handsome, charming, amoral -- 
      enters. Glances at Alex.

                                STEPHEN
                Good morning, PR professionals. Alex,

                                HELEN
                And was about to tell us about it.

                Okay. Speaking of imagination--

      He hits a remote, and a newspaper headline projects up front.

      Alex crosses the floor, as Helen veers by. Smirks, quietly--

                If you d wanted to be tied up, you

      short as Executive assistant EMMA -- 20 s, pretty -- 
      intercepts him with several files and messages.

                Total defeat. That s not even fair.

      Stephen is approaching...

                Good spin. I was gonna say to avoid 
                being fired. Forget this other stuff, 
                focus on your work.

                                ALEX
                Okay, Stephen. Thanks for saying that.

      Stephen gives Alex another squeeze on the shoulders and goes. 
      Alex glances at a PHOTO on his desk -- him and his kids 
      TOMMY, 12, and BILLY, 8 in happier days. Then he shovels a 
      load of files onto his desk and gets to work.


      ON HELEN, seen through the glass wall of her office as she 
      finishes work for the day. 

      ALEX heads across the office, watching her. He approaches the

                coming with us, so I need a wingman--

                                GREGG
                I can do it--

                You re married. You can t be a 
                wingman, ever again. Accept it.
                      (sock s Alex s arm)
                It s perfect. You watch me, see how 
                it s done, rehearse the moves. Dude, a 
                cat lady, it s like a chick with 
                training wheels--

                                ALEX
                I don t know, I m swamped with work, I 
                haven t moved into my new place...I 
                don t know if I m quite ready--

      Helen is passing, on her way out.

                                HELEN
                Good night. Dan, just curious, who was 
                your old sexual hero?

      Helen makes a  hmmm...  face and goes. Alex watches her--

                                GREGG
                You were gonna replace Jeter with him?

                                DAN
                Nah, it was just to psyche him up.

      Alex grabs his papers and hurries after Helen.


      Helen heads for the elevators, ready to leave for the night.  
      Alex catches up as she hits the button.

                                ALEX
                So, what if I asked properly?

                                HELEN
                About being tied up? I was kidding.

                                ALEX
                I mean, everyone thinks I should get 
                back on the horse, so I was wondering 
                if maybe you might like to, uh...be 
                that horse.

                                HELEN
                Hmm, let me think that over--

                                ALEX
                That didn t come out right. I mean, 
                like a normal date. Dinner. Movie--
                      (she just laughs)
                Was it the crying? I don t usually cry 
                after sex. Before or during sure, but--

      The elevator arrives.  They get in.

                                HELEN
                It s not that. I like men who cry--

                                ALEX
                Then we should probably get married. 
                You d be very happy.


      Alex and Helen ride, as elevator music plays.

                A mess, maybe, but absolute?

                                HELEN
                You re crying right now. Are you aware 
                of that?

      A beat. Alex realizes, yes, there are tears on his face.

                                ALEX
                No, what--?
                      (cocks ear to listen)
                God, it s this song. My kids loved

                do your hands...you wouldn t be 
                  impressed, they were bad dancers,

      They re passing the Lobby desk, where WALTER -- 40 s, odd --

                Alex, stop. I know what this s like. 
                You think you re sailing through life,

                I don t think we should sleep together

                                HELEN
                That would imply we had a

                I didn t answer your question. Yes.

      She hangs up. Alex hangs up. Looks over at Walter, who has 
      paused the video.

      Alex is working. His New Shirt still hangs in his office. He 
      looks up to see Stephen looking in--

                                STEPHEN
                Nice shirt. Sexomnia?

                                ALEX

      Stephen heads out. Alex looks uncomfortable. Enter Helen.

                                HELEN
                Okay, maybe it s a little Stamos. You 
                don t have to do this. If you re not

                No, I m totally comfortable. I m

                hope you re not jealous thinking of me

                you sit home alone with your work.

      The office bustles with activity. Alex exits his office, goes 
      to hand a fax to Emma, who is munching a large Chinese 
      Chicken Salad at her desk. Helen follows--

                                ALEX
                Can you fax this, Emma? Thanks--

      Emma holds out a message slips.

      Helen appears, reacting to the news.

                Pete. I m sorry, but it s time--

      --she goes to lug the large picture off the wall. Which turns 
      out to be more than she bargained for, in her state. She

                  Actually, um...The good news is, Dan 
                is a huge clod with women--

                                HELEN
                How was your banter? She didn t have a 
                Chinese Chicken salad did she--? 

                                ALEX
                      (taking away her glass)
                I know I called you a problem drinker, 
                but you re actually quite good at it. 
                Is this why you wanted me to come by?

                                HELEN
                  I couldn t do it. Physically but also, 
                just, it s been a year, I m fine, and 
                you re right, all these photos, it s 
                not normal, so I was gonna take the 
                big ones down, but when I tried--

      That s when Alex sees the large portrait of Pete splayed on 
      the couch with red wine spilled on him.

                                ALEX
                  So...you re fine, you re saying.
                      (she glares at him)
                  I understand. I ve been there. And 
                we re friends, so, okay, tell me where 
                you want these to go, and I will try 
                to be the male and carry them...
                      (heading to stereo)
                But first, I don t know what you think 
                   Fernando  is actually about, but it s 
                actually a song about remembering the 
                  Mexican-American war, which really 
                makes no sense in this context--

      He turns to see Helen looking at him. A pregnant pause--      FREE AGENTS "Pilot" 3rd Draft 01/21/11     34.


                                HELEN
                Is it wrong that I called?

                                ALEX
                No. I mean, we re friends, I m your 
                friend, you needed a friend, just to 
                help out, like we talked...about--
                      (there s an intimate look)
                Okay, um...potato.


      Helen and Alex in bed together. Neither sure what to think.

                                ALEX
                So, what re you thinking? I ll go 
                first. I m thinking we need a new safe 
                word. I suggest  Ficus. 
                      (beat)
                She liked the shirt.

                                HELEN
                See? I told you.

                                ALEX
                But I ended up in bed with you, so--
                      (beat)
                You know, I read in the Times, there s 
                this new thing called  Friends with 
                  Benefits , where you re friends, but 
                you sleep together, and it s fine.

                                HELEN     
                Alex, that s so 2008. And we work 
                  together-- 

                                ALEX
                We do work together, it s awkward.

                                HELEN
                So re you gonna call her? Cat lady?

                                ALEX
                What? Like, it worked? You re jealous?

                                HELEN
                Okay, forget it. I m not helping you.

                                          TAG


      Dan and Gregg at the coffee area--

                                DAN
                --she s tight, but I m like, damn, her 
                friend s hot, and she s digging me--

      Alex and Helen come in. Dan sees Alex--

                                DAN (CONT D)
                And then there was this guy, who was 
                just, like,  oh, my divorce, my kids,  
                totally messing with my game. Good 
                thing you left. Where d you go anyway?

                                ALEX
                Just, had to help a friend with 
                  something. Sorry about your game. 

                                DAN
                I da totally hooked up if you hadn t 
                brought the room down. Dude, I tried, 
                but it s official. You re hopeless.

      As Alex and Helen continue along

                                HELEN
                Well, at least it s official.

                                ALEX
                Yeah, it s not knowing the official 
                status that s tough.

      They pause before Alex s office--

                                HELEN
                Alex, really. Thanks...for last night.

                                ALEX
                Sure. No problem.

      An awkward beat...then a hint of hug gesture, aborted...

                                  ALEX/HELEN
                Ficus. Right...
