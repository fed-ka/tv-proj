          PURDY stands in front of a hall half-full with STUDENTS. 
          We pick him up mid-lecture -- but this isn't the cool
          calm Purdy we're used to, this is a Purdy possessed by
          the spirit, sleeves rolled up, perspiration rolling off
          his forehead, talking more to himself than the students. 
          He seems haunted, wracked with inner demons.

                                        PURDY
                        ...No, what I'm talking about is
                        not at odds with a literal
                          interpretation of Revelation as a
                          prophecy of things to come...

          He turns and looks at his audience, taking a dramatic
          pause.  He's really holding their attention.  Actually
          he's kind of scaring them.

                                        PURDY
                        The Book of Revelation is not
                        about some battle in a distant
                        land, but about our own lives...
                        today. 

          A pretty female student raises her hand.  Purdy
            acknowledges her.

                        But with the war in Iraq... I
                        mean, the Bible says a leader
                        will invade the Middle East and
                        impose a religion across the world --

                        You're talking about the Islamists
                        who mistake Jihad for a battle
                        with Christendom -- Jihad - like
                        the Apocalypse is not a battle of
                        armies, but a holy war within
                        ourselves, for our own soul.

                        If God wants to give humanity a
                        sign, why not be clear and obvious?

                        He demands that we work hard to
                        understand His message, the signs
                        and wonders of the Bible, the
                        four horsemen, the lion lying
                        down with the lamb, few of us
                        will recognize these signs for
                        what they are.

          Purdy pauses becoming lost in his own revery, his students
            wondering what's going on.

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        What about the two prophets?

          Purdy turns to see JOHNNY standing way at the back of the
          lecture hall.  Purdy is surprised to see him there, and
          Johnny's presence throws him off.

                                        PURDY
                        The two prophets?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Revelation tells of two prophets
                        who will become the centers of
                        two storms... and they will speak
                        with the voice of God.

          Purdy's shaken, but tries not to show it.  

                                        PURDY
                        Yes, of course, the two prophets. 
                          Ordinary people chosen by God.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Do you think they will be
                        recognized when they come?

                                        PURDY
                        Their time is near, but the stage
                        has not been set.
                                (then as if he's
                                  speaking about himself)
                        We have much to do to prepare the
                        way for them...

          Purdy just stares at Johnny, disturbed and confused. 
          After a moment, he turns back to the class.          DEAD ZONE: INSTINCT - TEASER - 3/3/04 - YELLOW         4.



          Johnny's driving.  The radio's playing softly in the
          background.  Johnny's humming along, looking as if he
          doesn't have a care in the world.

          Behind him, the TRUCK WINDOW is half open, DARKNESS behind
          it.  And in the darkness... a sudden FLUTTERING NOISE. 

          There's a break in Johnny's humming.  He waits, listens,
          doesn't hear anything.  He smiles and turns up the radio,
          humming again.

          FLUTTER.

          And this time, maybe a FLASH of something DARK darting
          past the back window.

          FLUTTER.  FLUTTER.  FLUTTER.

          The darkness behind Johnny seems to SWIRL, as if it has
          suddenly come alive.  Johnny whirls, looking through the
          back window, and moves to close it --

          But it's too late.  EXPLODING through the back window,
          filling the cab of the truck, swirling violently around
          Johnny, is a flock of BATS, their wings beating.  They
          swarm him like bees, their claws fastening into his shirt,
          their wings pounding his face.  His arms flail, frantic,
            uselessly trying to beat the bats away... He skids off
          the road, and on the moment of impact...

                                                                                CUT TO:

          Walt and Johnny move cautiously into the farmhouse.  They
          glance down.  There's blood spattered on the rug just
          inside the front door.

          A trail of blood leads deeper into the house.

                        What do you think happened?

                        I was hoping you could tell me.

          Johnny follows Walt.  They move forward, past tumbled
          furniture, and stop short as they see --


          A BODY

            a middle-aged MAN, bloody and still, on the other side of
          the couch.


          WALT

          moves quickly, bending over, checking the body.  He looks
          up at Johnny.

                                        WALT
                        Gone.  Looks like... some kind of
                        animal got him.

          Johnny bends over and cautiously touches the body.



          Johnny stands, looking around.

                        still be in the house --

          Walt runs, Johnny moving as quickly as he can behind him.



          A small, dark cellar.  No windows.  Walt creaks open the
          door, shining his flashlight down the stairs.

                                        WALT
                        County Sheriff!  Anybody down
                        here?  Hello?

          He finds a light switch and clicks it on.  At the bottom
          of the stairs, behind a stack of crates, the woman and
          the little girl from Johnny's vision are huddled.  They're
          bloodied and terrified, but alive.



          Purdy hunches over the desk in his office, drinking
            expensive scotch, pouring over files splayed across his
          desk.  He keeps looking at the same files obsessively, as
          if somehow they'll change if he keeps going over them.


          INSERT - THE FILES

          Bellevue Estates title papers and deeds.  Environmental
          reports.  Blueprints.

          Sweeps the papers off the desk, sending them across the
          room.

                        Damn you Johnny Smith...

          Purdy lapses into a depressed stupor, staring into the

            perfectly still...

          EXTREME CLOSEUP ON THE GLASS OF SCOTCH

          The surface of the scotch vibrating from some unseen force.


          PURDY

          Begins to realize something is odd about the vibration,
          but is distracted by HIS DOG BARKING in the distance.

                                        PURDY
                          Caleb... stop that damn barking...

                          Caleb... come!

          More insistent barking rouses Purdy from his chair.



          Exhausted, Purdy slumps against the door, closing his
          eyes as he catches his breath.  Then something brushes
          against his leg, startling him --

                                        PURDY
                        Caleb!  You're alive!

          It's only his trusty Rotweiller Caleb.  Purdy reaches out
          to pet him, but the dog backs up -- growling at Purdy.

                                        PURDY
                        Caleb what is it?

          The dog just keeps staring at him, as if to say, "you
          know what it is" -- Caleb's piercing stare preys on Purdy's
          guilty mind.  Purdy takes back his outstretched hand,
          suddenly not sure he's safe with his own dog.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

          Johnny and Walt walk down a hallway behind a DOCTOR, who's
          consulting a file in her hand and talking as she goes.

                                        DOCTOR
                        He was picked up coming out of
                        the woods yesterday.  Incoherent,
                          delusional.  Suffering auditory
                          hallucinations.  Ran a drug screen,
                        came back negative.  No history
                        of mental illness.  We're not
                        sure what caused his psychotic
                          episode.  He's calmed down a little
                        since he came in.  But don't count
                        on getting much sense out of him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's he been saying?

                                        DOCTOR
                        A lot of dire predictions. 
                          Something dangerous, unnatural,
                        coming out of the darkness...

          She stops in front of a doorway and unlocks the door.

                                        DOCTOR
                        Like I said... nothing that makes
                        much sense.

          She opens the door and invites them to step inside.



          TED KEANE, scruffy and tense, sits on a single bed, the
          only piece of furniture in the small room.  He's mumbling
          to himself when Johnny and Walt enter.

                        what to do.  Can you tell us what
                          happened to you in the woods?

          Keane shakes his head and looks away.

                                        KEANE
                        You won't believe me.  I didn't
                        believe it myself.  Only I saw

                        hunted.  The things they hunted.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yes?

                        The food chain.  Predator and
                        prey.  It's all wrong.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And now they're attacking people... 

                                        KEANE
                        Yes.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Did they attack you?

                                        KEANE
                        They would have.  If I let them. 
                        I have a trailer.  In the woods. 
                        My field lab.  All my notes.  Had
                        to leave it... had to run away...
                        I knew they were coming.  And
                        they're not going to stop...

          Johnny tries to get Keane to talk sensibly:

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why do you say they won't stop?

                                        KEANE
                        I know how the animals think. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        What are they thinking?

                                        KEANE
                        They're thinking, it's payback
                        time.

          Suddenly Keane rises.  Walt backs away, but Keane lunges
          forward and grabs Johnny's arm.  Johnny jerks backward --


3333A VISION - HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

          As Vision-Johnny watches, Keane claws at his locked room
          door, frantic.  In the distance, we hear a roaring noise
          grow louder (not the mysterious noise, but the noise of
            destruction) -- drowning out faint shouts of "Run!  It's
          coming!  It's coming!"  Then the power falters before
          going out, plunging Keane into darkness as the VISION
          ENDS.



          Walt pulls Keane away from Johnny. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's right.  Whatever it is...
                        it's coming.

          Off Walt's reaction.

          Bruce drives, Johnny rides, down a two-lane road.

                                        BRUCE
                        What's at this trailer?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Keane's field lab.  Whatever drove
                        him crazy, it's out there.

                                        BRUCE
                        So of course that's where we're
                        headed.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Of course.

                                        BRUCE
                        Thanks for inviting me, Johnny. 
                        I've always found sanity overrated.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No problem.

                                        BRUCE
                        By the way, I went to the hall of
                          records.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Find anything?

                                        BRUCE
                        Yes.  You are indeed the proud
                        owner of Bellevue Estates.  Or at
                        least your trust is.  According
                        to the deed, you closed escrow
                        four years ago.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I would have celebrated if I hadn't
                        been in a coma.

                                        BRUCE
                        Don't break out the champagne
                        yet.  According to the title
                        report, it's a swamp.  They renamed
                        it Bellevue Estates, but it's
                        still a swamp.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That Purdy... always looking out
                        for my best interests.
                                (giving directions)
                        In about a quarter mile there's a
                        dirt road on the right.  We want
                        to take it.



          Johnny peers out the windows of the car, searching.  Bruce
          winces as a BRANCH scrapes along the car.

                                        BRUCE
                        Next time we go trailblazing, how
                        'bout we take your rig?

                                        JOHNNY
                          According to Keane, his trailer
                        should be around here somewhere. 
                        And... there it is.

          He points.  The trailer glimmers in the headlights.  Bruce
          stops the car.



          Johnny finds and clicks on a light.  The trailer is a
          mess.  There are papers, files, books, radio equipment
          and bits of clothing scattered around.

                                        BRUCE
                        Not much of a housekeeper.

          Johnny examines a bulletin board that's almost falling
          off the wall.  Tacked to it are various Fish & Game
          documents, wildlife photos, etc. 

          Johnny flips through Keane's FIELD NOTEBOOK.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Strange.

                                        BRUCE
                        What?

          Johnny shows it to him. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Everything looks pretty normal. 
                          Methodical.  Up until about two
                        days ago.  Then his notes start
                        looking like this.


          INSERT NOTEBOOK

          Keane has carefully kept notes that eventually devolve
          into unintelligible line drawings.  On the last page is a
          darkly drawn CIRCLE, with ARROWS drawn away from it. 
          Hundreds and hundreds of arrows.  As Johnny touches it...          DEAD ZONE: INSTINCT - ACT TWO - 3/1/04 - PINK         31.



          Keane scribbles madly, grinding his pencil into the paper
          as he draws one arrow after the other.



          Johnny folds the book, puts it in his pocket.  Bruce
          examines a piece of EQUIPMENT, picks up a TRACKING COLLAR.

                                        BRUCE
                        So he was tracking bears?

          Johnny looks up from the notebook. 

                                        JOHNNY
                          According to this, the bears
                        shifted their territorial behavior
                          abruptly, suddenly abandoning
                        their habitats.  If I remember my
                        high school biology properly,
                        bears don't usually leave their
                          established territories.  Unless
                          something big is happening.  Like
                        a fire, or --

                                        BRUCE
                        Yeah.  "Or."
                                (beat)
                        Look, why don't we just grab this
                        stuff and take it back to town
                        with us.  This place is creeping
                        me out.

          Johnny picks up the tracking collar.



          Johnny drops the collar, throws himself at the open door
          and SLAMS it... just as the trailer is HIT hard, by
            something very angry.  A bear ROARS furiously.  The trailer
          rocks. 

          There's a HOWL of rage from outside.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Bear.

                                        BRUCE
                        No kidding.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: INSTINCT - ACT TWO - 3/1/04 - PINK         32.


    44CONTINUED:44

          BAM!  BAM!  BAM!

          The trailer SLAMS to one side, as if it's been hit by a
          train.  There's something frighteningly machinelike and
          relentless about the bear's attack... as if its normal
            instincts have been erased by its rage.



          The trailer is SLAMMED again, almost tipping over this
          time.  Johnny grabs the counter, trying to stay upright. 
          He looks at Bruce.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think we need a bigger trailer.

                                        BRUCE
                        You're killing me.

          There's a moment of silence.  It lengthens.  Johnny and
          Bruce look at each other hopefully.

                                        BRUCE
                        Maybe it gave up.

          There's a huge THUD from the other side of the trailer. 
          And, after a moment... the sound of ripping claws, tearing
          at the trailer.



                                        BRUCE
                        It's on the other side.  I'll get
                        the car, pull up here, you be
                        ready to jump in --

                        have messed with my ride...

          And he's out the door.



          Bruce drives, fast, down the road as Johnny peers out the
          windows into the darkness.

                                        BRUCE
                        What are you looking for?

          It's chaos in here.  People are milling around, clearly
          upset, others sitting still as if in shock.  Johnny moves
          through the crowd, finding Walt. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Walt, what's going on?

                        their owners.  Wild animals
                          invading homes.  We even had a
                        family attacked by a deer.

                                        BRUCE

                        down in the basement.  The pound
                        is full to capacity.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What can I do to help?

                                        WALT
                        There's an emergency meeting in
                        about an hour to inform the public
                        of what's happening.  Maybe I'll
                        know more by then.

          Walt splits off, hailed by a Deputy.  Johnny hears BARKING;
          walks out into the hallway, following the sound.



          Johnny and Bruce enter to find a dozen barking dogs in
          separate cages, ROSCOE guarding them.  They look like
          ordinary pets: retrievers, terriers, various mixed breeds.

                        These dogs?  These fluffy cocker-

                        their owners?

                          Friendliest dog in the world, but
                        he was coming at me, ready to
                        kill.

          Johnny ignores Bruce and Roscoe, staying focused on the
          dogs.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's like thousands of years of
                          breeding and training have been
                          stripped away to reveal their
                        basic instincts --

            Suddenly, the barking subsides.  The dogs begin to growl,
          low in their throats.  And they all crouch in the backs
          of their cages.  It's unsettling.

          Johnny bends down to look into one cage.  A small fluffy
          DOG growls at him.  Johnny puts his hand up.  The dog,
          still growling, slowly comes forward, giving Johnny's
          hand a half-hearted sniff.  Johnny touches the dog,
          triggering --



          Johnny winces, puts his hands to his ears.  The dog SNARLS
          and snaps at Johnny, like it knows what Johnny saw.  Off
          Johnny's reaction.



          Walt and Reverend Purdy stand in front of the assembled
          townsfolk, trying to be heard over everyone talking.

          Johnny and Bruce stand in the back, watching.

                                        PURDY
                          Everyone, please, one at a time.

                                        SCARED WOMAN
                        What's going to happen to our
                        pets?  I heard they were going to
                        be quarantined then killed...

          Purdy looks at Walt.  He steps forward.

                                        WALT
                        Nobody is going to kill your pets. 
                        The most important thing right
                        now is that we don't panic.

                                        DOUG
                        Don't panic?  There's been dozens
                        of attacks.  Who's going to protect
                        us?

                                        PURDY
                        God will not forsake us in our
                        hour of need.

          Walt gives Purdy a quick glance -- his dire tone is not
          helping.

                                        WALT
                                (off Purdy)
                        Everything possible is being done
                        to insure public safety. 

                                        SCARED WOMAN
                        But what's happening?  Why are
                        the animals doing this?

                                        WALT
                        We're still investigating all the
                          possibilities --

          One man, STAN, rises.  Stan's a hunter. 

                                        STAN
                        I heard there was some crazy bear
                        loose in the woods.  It could
                        have spooked those horses, sent
                        them running into town --

          His friend Doug nods.

                        -- spread whatever disease it's
                        got to our dogs and cats --

                                        STAN
                        I say me and Doug and anybody
                        wants to come with us, should go
                        out and kill that bear.

                                        WALT
                        That's the last thing we need, 
                        more people in harm's way.

          Bruce shouts from the back.

                                        BRUCE
                        We don't know the bear is
                          responsible for anything --

                                        DOUG
                          Something is spooking all the
                          animals.  If it's not the bear,
                        then we'll find out what it is,
                        and we'll kill that!

          Stan turns to leave, Doug with him, clearly more excited
          by the prospect of going out into the woods and killing
            something than afraid of some killer bear disease.

                                        PURDY
                        Instead of killing God's creatures,
                        we should be begging for his
                          forgiveness...

          Walt tries to blow past Purdy's personal darkness.

                                        WALT
                        ...the best thing for everybody
                        is to just go home, stay off the
                          streets, and let us do our job.

          People start to file out, Johnny the only one paying
            attention to Purdy as he lowers his head in prayer.

          Walt joins Johnny and Bruce, the three of them watching
          the crowd exit, leaving Purdy behind.

                                        WALT

                        I don't know.

          Walt and Bruce follow the last of the people outside,
          leaving Johnny alone with Purdy -- his head still bowed
          in prayer.


          JOHNNY AND PURDY

          Johnny carefully approaches Purdy -- he's never seen him
          like this -- scared, the pretentiousness stripped away.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gene?  ...Gene?  What's going on? 
                        You okay?

                                        PURDY
                        I've been thinking about what you
                        said Johnny... about the stage
                        being set.  The two prophets.
                        Your visions, the things you've
                        seen... what if this isn't just
                        some local anomaly?  What if it's
                          something we've done... something
                        I...

          Purdy hesitates, almost seems ready to spill his guts,
          then pulls himself back from the brink.

                                        PURDY
                        Pray with me...

          Purdy unexpectedly reaches out for Johnny, grabbing his
          arm, triggering:


  5757OMITTED



          Empty... except for Purdy, who kneels piously at the altar. 
          Praying.  He's praying so fervently that his words tumble
          over each other so that he's out of breath.  From
          outside... the RUMBLE that we heard before in the Keane
          vision, growing louder and louder.

          The RUMBLE increases.  The chapel SHAKES.

          Just as whatever is coming sounds ready to breach the
          chapel walls...


  5959RESUME JOHNNY AND PURDY

          Johnny comes out of the vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're going to have to pray alone
                          Reverend.  I'm running out of

                        seen?  Tell me...

          Johnny turns and walks away, leaving behind a shaken Purdy.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

          Johnny's talking to Keane, who is slightly calmer.

                                        KEANE
                        It started with the smaller
                          vertebrates.
                                (beat)
                        Moles refusing to go underground,
                        birds eating their own eggs,
                        herbivores becoming carnivorous...

          Keane's getting unsettled again, just thinking about it.

                                        KEANE
                        Once I started to pay attention,
                        I saw that the insects and spiders
                        were displaying the same kind of
                          aberrant behavior.
                                (beat)
                        Then the bears started to react...

                                        JOHNNY
                        You realized that whatever was
                          affecting the animals was working
                        its way up to the larger animals.

                                        KEANE
                        Eventually it worked it's way up
                        the entire food chain until it
                        began effecting me.
                                (beat)
                          I didn't realize that until I got
                        here. 

          Johnny pulls out Keane's field notebook.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (off Keane's stare)
                        Rescued it from a friend of yours.
                                (beat)
                        I was curious about this last
                        page.

          Keane takes the book, opens it to the page with all the
          arrows on it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It seems kind of specific.

          Keane nods.

                                        KEANE
                        I remember this now.  Before I
                        completely lost it, I had this
                        flash of insight -- something all
                        the animals had in common.  They
                        were abandoning their habitats.

                                        JOHNNY
                        All running away from the same
                        area?

                                        KEANE
                        Yes. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Can you show me where that is on
                        the map?

                                        KEANE
                        I can do better than that.  Get
                        me out of here and I'll take you
                        right to it.

                        doesn't mean the dam is going to

          Johnny touches Scott, triggering --

          Walt floors it away from the dam.  Johnny slams his phone
          shut.

          Johnny and Bruce exchange a look.

                        It's all starting to make sense.



          Johnny finds the backdoor open.  Remembering the couger
          story, he steps inside cautiously.  The room is a mess,
          obvious signs of a struggle of somekind.  There's blood
          on the floor.

          Johnny pushes open the door to the study revealing:

          Sitting at his desk, reading his Bible, turning the page
          with his bloodied left hand, his forearm lacerated,
            bleeding.  The room is a mess, papers and files scattered;
            furniture knocked over, signs of a struggle everywhere.

                        Filling the dam is causing some

                        the dam to fail.

          Purdy smiles weirdly, turns to his Bible.

                        Of course.  It's all right here...

                        voice of thunder, "Come."

          Johnny sees that Purdy is losing it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gene... I need you to call the
                          governor.  There's still time to
                        release the water, drain the
                          reservoir before the dam breaks...

          Purdy just laughs.

                        Don't you see Johnny?  It's too
                        late for that.

          Purdy looks at the gun.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why don't you give me the gun,

                        It doesn't matter now.

          Purdy picks up the gun.  He's oddly serene.

          Johnny eases over to the desk, puts his hand out for the
          gun.  Purdy just stares at the gun.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You asked me what I've seen... If

                        it doesn't end here. 

          Purdy looks up from the gun, meeting Johnny's eyes.  Johnny
          doesn't want to give any of this up, but right now he'll
          say anything to get Purdy to put down that gun and call
          the governor.

                        call the governor and convince
                        him to drain the reservoir... if

          Purdy looks into Johnny's eyes for a long time, then
          reluctantly holds out the gun for Johnny to take.

                        let me off so easily...

          Johnny takes the gun, triggering:



          Architects, engineers and businessmen sit around a
          conference table.  Purdy tosses a thick, bound
            environmental impact report down on the table --


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: INSTINCT - ACT FOUR - 3/5/04 - GREEN       57.

                        I've read this report, and gone
                        over it personally with the best
                          engineers and biologists in the
                        field who assure me the impact on
                        the local habitat can be mitigated. 
                        The dam has been built, the master
                        plan for our development has been
                          approved.  We need to fight these
                          frivolous lawsuits and move forward
                        with filling the reservoir...



          Purdy looks to Johnny, wondering about what he's just
          seen.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Bellevue Estates.  There was a
                        lawsuit to stop construction of
                        the dam...

                                        PURDY
                        The courts threw it out...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Because of your influence.  Because
                        you couldn't let anything stop
                        your plans.

          Purdy collapses back into his chair, exhausted, wrung
          out.

                                (quietly)
                        You have no idea what this will
                        do to me... to what I've built at
                        Faith Heritage... There will be
                        an investigation... It will be
                        the end of my ministry...

                        Maybe it's only the beginning.
                        Pick up the phone Gene.

          Off Purdy's look.
