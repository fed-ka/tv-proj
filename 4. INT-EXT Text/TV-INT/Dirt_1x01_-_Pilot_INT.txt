    A basketball game in progress.  An insanely hot woman sits 
    courtside, wearing a teensy-weensy wife beater and a little 
  denim skirt.  She smiles at PRINCE TYREESE, superstar point 
  guard and multi-million dollar endorsement magnet.  He s 
  about to bang a three-pointer, but instead drives inside and 
  SLAMS the ball, hangs from the net staring at the woman.  She 
  uncrosses her legs and parts them. 


  Prince Tyreese stands there naked, 6 8   and tatted, his BOYS 
  lounging around him.

  He leans over and whispers something, dispatches one of them.


    Courtside, post game.  Tyreese s homeboy talks to the hot 
  chick in the bg...

  While in the foreground, Tyreese poses for the cameras with 
  his perfect, camera-ready FAMILY, beautiful WIFE and FOUR 
  KIDS.


  Tyreese, dressed, leaves the locker room.

  As he walks out, the LOCKER ROOM ATTENDANT picks up his 
    cellphone...                                                                                  2.




  SUV GUY watches the Hummer pass, makes a call.

                              SUV GUY
                Houston, we have a booty call.


  JULIA MYERS, 27, superstarlet, queen of Young Hollywood, 
  looks distractedly out the limo window as they creep along 
  Hollywood Boulevard.

  Her boyfriend, HOLT McLAREN, 33, a better-looking Sean Penn, 
  vogues to the lighted make-up mirror, pulls at his carefully 
  crafted spiky bedhead.

  MICHELLE, their driver, turns around and regards the couple.

                              MICHELLE
                You ready?

                              HOLT
                Ask her, she s the star.

                              JULIA
                One sec.

  She takes out a lip gloss, doesn t even look in the mirror, 
  applies it in one move and hands it to Holt.

                              JULIA (CONT D)
                You mind?  I don t have any 
                pockets.

  And indeed she doesn t.  The gown is one piece of sheer, 
  clingy fabric.

  She steps from the limo out on to the red carpet.

  MUSIC:  Ride It On  by Mazzy Star...  

  SUPER SLO MO -- MOS

  As her Jimmy Choo-clad feet touch down on the red carpet.  
  Holt climbs out after her, having to slide across the seat to 
  get there, so his exit is not nearly so graceful.  We 
  recognize his camera face from his vogue-ing in the mirror.                                                                                  6.



  Posters and print ads from the movie everywhere;  Subliminal 
    Velocity,  all ice-blue with guns and futuristic wardrobe.  

  They face a SEA OF FLASHES.  The  LEGIT  PRESS elbow the 
    PAPARAZZI...they re all out in full force, screaming, waving, 
  flashing, taping...we see but don t hear their hysterics.  
  Spittle on the corners of mouths, grabbing at competitors, 
  faces contorted in desperate pleas for a shot...

  ON JULIA AND HOLT

  SUPER-DUPER SLO-MO now, as they walk up the red carpet, 
  holding hands.  They are the essence of beauty, symmetry, 
  love.

  RETURN TO SPEED -- EAR-SHATTERING SOUND

  As the PAPARAZZI scream...and behind them, the deafening 
  Greek Chorus that is THE FANS, set up behind ropes that are 
  set up behind ropes.  They scream for one glance, one wave, 
  knowing that their Gods will never make it over to them for 
  an autograph.  

  The photogs and vid-hounds fire away at the couple.  We MOVE 
  BACK AND FORTH between the smooth red carpet POV of the stars 
  and the rough, hand-held scrum that is the press pit.

  VARIOUS PHOTOGRAPHER POVS

  As the photos frame up and FREEZE.  We watch them move from 
  photos of Julia and Holt, to photos of Julia only, as Holt is 
  framed further and further out, until he s not in the photos 
  at all.

                              ONE PAPARAZZ0
                Can we get a fashion shot of Julia, 
                please?

  (A nice way of getting Holt out of the shot.)

  Julia and Holt greet KIRA KLAY, Julia s best friend and 
  fellow it-girl of the moment.  

                              KIRA
                      (to Julia)
                Hey Sexy. 

                              JULIA
                Look who s talking.

  They pose together for some photos, Kira doing her trademark 
      wild-child-sticking-out-pierced-tongue thing while Julia goes 
  for classic starlet.

  Holt watches as Julia shimmers her way through an interview 
  with  Access Hollywood .                                                                                  7.



  Holt watches the feeding frenzy on Julia.  He gets pushed 
  closer and closer to the velvet ropes, bumping up against the 
  sweaty paparazzi.

  DON KONKEY 

  Stands there among the photographers.  

  He s not shooting Julia, but carefully regarding Holt.  He 
  sets aside his still camera and flips on his little lapel 
  video. 

                              LUCY 
                Why aren t you shooting Julia and 
                Johnny?

                              DON
                I m working on something else right 
                now.

                              LUCY
                Well, all right....uh, Don?

                              DON
                Yes, Lucy?

                              LUCY
                I know you don t work exclusively 
                for TCM, but people...associate you 
                with us.

                              DON
                I know.

                              LUCY
                So maybe you could try to...clean 
                up a little.

  Don seems to take no offense.

                              DON
                 Kay.  Excuse me.

  He sidles up to Holt.

                              DON (CONT D)
                Holt McLaren...

                              HOLT
                Yeah?

                              DON
                You were great in Another Word For 
                Love.                                                                                  8.



                              HOLT
                Thanks.

                              DON
                  I mean....really great.  Like stop- 
                  the-presses great.

                              HOLT
                      (slightly bitter)
                And somehow the presses kept going.

  Holt looks at Don with equal measures distrust, disgust and 
  hope.  Maybe this schlub can do something for him.  He 
  doesn t see the hidden camera.

                              DON 
                Haven t seen you in the trades 
                lately.

                              HOLT
                Uh, yeah...took a little time off.

                              DON
                Yeah, you did like seven movies in 
                a row that all bombed.

                              HOLT
                      (smiles)
                Yeah, I did.  You re right.

                              DON
                  Countdown, Blow Monkey, Pale 
                  Assassin, The Growling, 
                  Hospitality, 1313 Tellinghouse 
                Lane...

                              HOLT
                That s only six.

                              DON
                Dead Even.  Uncredited cameo.

                              HOLT
                Wow.  Creepy.

                              DON
                You re always good.  In everything 
                you do.  Authentic.  

                              HOLT
                      (oddly flattered)
                Thanks. 

                              DON 
                Anything coming up?                                                                                  9.



                              HOLT
                Um...I m like, in talks on a really 
                cool movie.  It s a great script.  
                We ll see.

                              DON
                Sounds pretty vague.  

                              HOLT
                Huh?

                              DON
                Sounds pretty unlikely.  Like the 
                movie probably won t happen.

                              HOLT
                  Uh...anyway, take care.

  Holt starts to move back toward Julia but the crowd surges 
  forward with the arrival of JOHNNY COLE...female fans SCREAM 
  and swoon, FLASHES go nuts.

  Julia and Johnny s publicists slide the two stars together 
  for photo ops.  Johnny snakes his arm around Julia.  

  Holt stands in the shadows watching Johnny and Julia pose 
  down in front of the press.

                              DON
                Hey.

  Holt ignores Don.  Don s used to it.

                              DON (CONT D)
                Holt...

                              HOLT
                What?

                              DON 
                They have great chemistry.  He s 
                not very good, but they re good 
                  together.  They look hot together.

                              HOLT
                What?

                              DON
                There was a rumor he fucked her on 
                the movie...

  Holt squints, like he s not hearing this guy right.

                              HOLT
                What?  What the fuck--                                                                                10.



                              DON
                --But I don t believe it.  I could 
                find out.  Definitively.  If you 
                want to know...

                              HOLT
                What are you--

  Don holds a business card in his grubby hand, proffers it to 
  Holt.  

                              DON
                And maybe you could give me -- 
                y know -- a little piece of gossip, 
                or a big one...and that way maybe I 
                could help you get your career out 
                of the toilet--

  That s it.  Holt turns and SWINGS at Don, just missing, as we 
  go to--

  HIDDEN CAM POV

  And see the familiar tussle of a seemingly irrational movie 
  star shoving at a paparazzo...

  The chaotic camera work/Holt s angry red face/Julia turning 
  to see Holt fighting/Julia in her gown trying to break it 
  up/handlers pulling Julia out/The fans going crazy.

  Lucy watches, smiling and shaking her head at Don.  He s a 
  freak, but he s a playmaker.

  AND IN SLOW MOTION

  Don s business card floating to the red carpet.

  BACK TO SPEED

  Lucy pulls Don up to his feet. 

                              LUCY
                Nice work, Don...great work.  
                I want to see that footage first.  
                We ll use it for Star Stalkers.  
                You let me have it exclusively?

                              DON 
                 Kay.

                              LUCY
                Get outta here.

  A few SECURITY GUYS are finally getting their asses moving, 
  Don sees them and starts to beat his retreat from the melee.                                                                                 11.



  FOUR COPS ON HORSEBACK 

  Ride up.  They seem to appear out of nowhere and Don is 
  startled by them.  A white horse, a red horse, a black horse 
  and a pale horse.

  Don makes his getaway, looking back as one of the horses 
  rears back a little and we see deep into its-- 

  WILD EYES

  Don glances over at the crowd of onlookers, disturbed.

  IN THE CROWD

  About the third layer of people back in the crowd, a little 
  taller that the rest...

  A SAD CAT MAN

  Yeah, that s right.  A SAD CAT MAN.  Tall motherfucker, too, 
  about 6 4 , whiskers, cat nose and face, rumpled suit.  Sad.  
  He looks at Don, deeply and...sadly.

  DON

  Stares back at Sad Cat Man.  Not so much surprised as 
    embarrassed.

  SAD CAT MAN

  Shakes his head, disappointed.  And disappears.                                                                                12.


                                    ACT ONE


  The  Subliminal Velocity  after-party.  The Industry Types 
  from the screening aggressively noshing on chicken satay and 
  trying to get close to Julia and Johnny Cole.  Pools of LIGHT 
    surrounded by darkness. 

  Lucy Spiller glides through the crowd.  She appears next to 
  Johnny and Julia and a house photographer FLASHES.  Lucy 
  nails every photo op.

  IN THE LIGHT

  Johnny holds court, very serious...uses his hands a lot as he 
  talks.  

                                JOHNNY COLE 
                And I m all,  I know Krav Maga, 
                bitch!   

  His story completed, Johnny looks around to make sure 
  everyone has properly appreciated it.

  Julia stands there with a glass of champagne, smiling 
    politely...Holt glowers into his Rolling Rock.

                                JOHNNY COLE (CONT D)
                Hey, Holt, bummer about that a-hole 
                  paparazzi dude.

                              HOLT
                Yeah.

                                JOHNNY COLE
                So, you workin ?

                              HOLT
                I m like, developing a couple 
                things.

                                JOHNNY COLE
                Right.  You were great in Another 
                Word For Love.  One a my all-times.


                              HOLT
                Thanks.

                                JOHNNY COLE 
                  I thought, damn, this guy s good.  
                  I thought I was gonna have to like, 
                move aside.  

  Julia rolls her eyes at the insensitivity of this remark.                                                                                13.



                              HOLT
                I m gonna go sit down.

                                JOHNNY COLE
                      (homeboy peace-out)
                Keep at it...you got mad skills, 
                dawg!

  Johnny Cole regards Holt as he walks away.  He nods 
    drunkenly, raises his beer bottle as if saluting a fallen 
  comrade.

  IN AND OUT OF THE LIGHT

  Holt rummages through the food table and, as carefully as a 
  jewel thief, slips food into his jacket pockets.

                                                                  TIME CUT TO:

  IN THE DARK

  At a cocktail table, Lucy slides in beside Holt.  Why would 
  she waste her time with cold-as-ice Holt McLaren?

                              LUCY
                Hi, Lucy Spiller.  NOW Magazine?  

  They shake hands.

                              HOLT
                Right, nice to meet you.

                              LUCY
                You too.  Sorry about earlier.
                That photographer s a nutjob.

  IN THE LIGHT

  Julia listens to Johnny droning on.

  IN THE DARK

  Holt and Lucy lean in to hear one another.  

                              LUCY (CONT D)
                I would love to do a feature on you 
                some time... The Actor s Actor. 

  Holt gobbles up the attention, but remains self-deprecating.

                              HOLT
                 Actor s Actor?   Isn t that a nice 
                way of saying  chronically 
                  unemployed?                                                                                 14.



                              LUCY
                We ll just have to find the right 
                thing to do together.

  She smiles enigmatically.

                              LUCY (CONT D)
                Or the right reason.

  Holt looks at her quizzically...

  IN THE LIGHT

  Julia squints into the dark, sees the back of Lucy walking 
  away.

  Johnny Cole drunkenly takes off his shirt.  Flexes down. 
  Points to his nipple.

                                JOHNNY COLE
                And she fucking pulled the nipple 
                ring out with her teeth!  Look, 
                it s shredded, right?  Like a 
                fuckin  snake tongue!

  High fives and fist bumps all around.

  IN THE DARK

  Holt sits on the sidelines, several Rolling Rocks down, 
  glowering over at Johnny and Julia.

  Holt slips his foot back and forth, feels something on the 
  bottom of his boot.  He reaches down and peels off...

  DON KONKEY S BUSINESS CARD

  He looks at it for a moment, puts it in his coat pocket.

  IN THE LIGHT

  Julia finally looks openly bored, rolling her eyes and 
  sticking out her tongue.  She makes her way over to Holt, 
  saying thank you and fake-smiling to all her well-wishers.

  IN THE DARK

  She sits next to him.  She looks over at Johnny Cole, who s 
  now busting full crazy martial arts moves.

                              JULIA
                What an asshole.

                              HOLT
                Gee, you think?                                                                                15.



                              JULIA
                Easy there, Tyson.

                              HOLT 
                I m sorry I ruined your premiere.

                              JULIA
                Are you kidding?  It took their 
                minds off the movie, which sucks.

                              HOLT
                You were great, though.

                              JULIA
                You just love me.

  Holt shrugs, resigned.

                              HOLT
                Yeah, I guess I do.

                              JULIA
                You can do better than that.

  She takes his hand and guides it under her dress and between 
  her legs.

                              HOLT
                Don t you think we ve been in the 
                news enough for one night?

                              JULIA
                You think anyone here sees anything 
                but themselves?  Besides, it s 
                really dark in here...

                              HOLT
                It is.  And wet.

                              JULIA
                Make me come.

  They sit there for a moment.  The MUSIC thumping, Holt 
    concentrating, Julia fluttering, then closing her eyes...

  An AGENT walks by.

                              AGENT
                Great performance!

  Julia opens her eyes.

                              JULIA
                Thanks.                                                                                16.



  Julia and Holt both laugh.  Beat, then Julia looks 
    surprised...

                              JULIA (CONT D)
                Oh, God...

  She turns to Holt.

                              JULIA (CONT D)
                Oh, God...I m coming.


  Pretty much the apartment you would expect from Don.  Filthy.  
  A giant cat condo fills a corner of the place, covered in 
  shag carpet.

  And piles of PHOTOGRAPHIC PRINTS.  Leaning against the wall, 
  stacked in piles.  They re blurry, beautiful, disturbing, 
    exceptionally provocative.  Somehow deeply spiritual and 
  sensual.  These are Don s other photos.  On each photo, in 
  his crazy scrawl, stories are written on the negatives, a 
  world is created. 

  This is the work of an obsessive: He can t help but make it, 
  and as such it fits at least one definition of real art; it s 
  essential to the survival of the person making it.

  Don holds his cat, TRISTAN, on his lap.  Tristan is in bad 
  shape, his small cat body wracked with cancer, hair thinned   
  by chemo and radiation. 

  Tristan looks back at Don dolefully.

                              DON
                You re okay, Tristan...you re 
                  okay...you re okay, buddy....you re 
                okay ...that s right, Tristan, 
                that s my buddy...

  He places a pill at the back of Tristan s throat, then closes 
  the cat s mouth and massages his throat.

                              DON (CONT D)
                You re okay, buddy...


  Lucy wakes up.  There s a SNORT next to her.  A long-haired 
  ROCK GOD-looking dude is asleep next to her.  They re both so 
  naked.  He is early 20s, look-of-the-moment beautiful.

                              LUCY
                Oh God ohgodohgodohgod...                                                                                17.



  She quietly disengages from the Rock God.  He SNORTS again, 
  making her jump.  She reaches into the back of her drawer and 
  pulls out a stun gun.

                              LUCY (CONT D)
                Hey!

  Rock God SNORTS again, this time Lucy is undeterred.

                              LUCY (CONT D)
                HEY!!

  He wakes up and sees her leveling the stun gun at him.  He 
  flips his long hair back reflexively.

                              ROCK GOD
                  Whoa...Sinead...what are you doing?

                              LUCY
                Sinead?

                              ROCK GOD
                You were so awesome...

                              LUCY
                I don t know who the fuck you are 
                or what the fuck you re doing in my 
                bed, but you have sixty seconds to 
                get the fuck out of my bed and out 
                of my house.

                              ROCK GOD
                  Sinead...honey?  It s Kai...from 
                Velvet?

                              LUCY
                I don t know what any of that is.

                              ROCK GOD/KAI
                The club?  Where we met?

                              LUCY
                I have never seen you before.  Just 
                get out.

                              ROCK GOD/KAI
                      (as if this will clear 
                        everything up)
                You took my pants off on the dance 
                floor?

  Lucy brandishes the stun gun.

                              LUCY
                Twenty seconds.                                                                                18.



                              ROCK GOD/KAI
                You said you could help my 
                  band...Student Driver?

  She nails him with the stun gun.  

                              ROCK GOD/KAI (CONT D)
                  AAAAHHGGGH!

  Drops him like a bag of hammers.  He recovers and cowers from 
  her.  Gathers his clothes.

                              LUCY
                Go.

  He runs from the house.  

  Lucy breathes heavily, shaking with emotion.  


  DR. LUSK, the veterinary oncologist, applies radiation to 
  Tristan.  The radiation gun makes a dull buzz every time Dr. 
  Lusk fires it.  

  Don looks on, blank but anxious.  Bzzzzzz goes the radiation 
  gun.

                              DR. LUSK
                Cats do much better with radiation 
                than humans.  

  Don nods.  Beat.

                              DON
                How do you know that?

    Bzzzzzzzzzzzz...Dr. Lusk fires.

                              DR. LUSK
                Well, for one thing they have fewer 
                pain sensors.

  Don looks at Tristan...his hair is thin and sickly, ears flat 
  back against his head.

  Tristan turns his head and looks straight at Don.

                              TRISTAN
                I feel that you could have caught 
                this cancer earlier, Don.

                              DON
                I do too, buddy.                                                                                19.



                              DR. LUSK
                Excuse me?


  MOVING FAST...Lucy.  She may be a mess off the clock, but 
  Lucy is back in tiger shark mode at the office.  Some co-
  workers see her and literally flee in the opposite direction.  
  Some hand her proofs.  Some beg favors.  Some simply suck up.

  ALEXANDER BARROW falls into step next to Lucy.  While he is 
  technically her boss and the publisher of the media group, 
  she s the one who runs the day to day and without whom the 
  thing wouldn t function.  

  Barrow wears an absurdly sharp bespoke suit, walks with an 
  actual swagger, and speaks with a thick Australian accent.

                                BARROW
                Why d you have guys on Prince 
                Tyreese?

                              LUCY
                        (superfuckincool)
                He s the basketball player?                                                                                24.



                                BARROW
                Yes he s the goddamn basketball 
                player.  He s the highest paid 
                spade in the world.

                              LUCY
                We always have people on him.  He s 
                got a squeaky clean family man 
                image and he s a total slimeball.  
                That s what people want us to do.

  Barrow looks at her blankly.

                              LUCY (CONT D)
                Produce slimeballs.  We re either 
                  chronicling the meteoric rise of 
                some dipshit as they crawl out of 
                the slime or taking him off the top 
                of the caviar pile and pitching him 
                into the shit with the rest of us.  
                That s what we do, Alex.  And I do 
                it better than anybody else.  But I 
                guess it s hard to know that when 
                all you do is take advertisers out 
                to Lord of the Dance and review our 
                expense reports.  I pad mine, by 
                the way.

  Barrow, somewhat used to her rants, plows ahead.

                                BARROW
                Did you get anything on Tyreese?

                              LUCY
                Why?  You want an autographed ball?
                      (shakes her head)
                  Sonofabitch loses us every time.

                                BARROW
                You realize that Transcommunication 
                Media has a 30 percent interest in 
                the team.  

                              LUCY
                Shame on you, Alex.  As journalists 
                we re not supposed to cave to 
                  corporate interests.

                                BARROW
                Is that how you get through the 
                night?  Pretending to be a 
                  journalist?  

                              LUCY
                      (caught, glibness gone for 
                        a second)
                                (MORE)                                                                                25.

                              LUCY (CONT'D)
                No.  
                        (recovering)
                How do you get through the night?

  They round the corner in the art department, where Don stands 
  at a light table.  He uses a loop to make his selects.

  Don quickly covers the Prince Tyreese photos he s working on 
  and puts some shots from the premiere on top of them.

                                BARROW 
                Don Konkey!  The last pap to shoot 
                on film.

  Don flinches, brought out of his reverie in the photos.

                              DON
                Hi, Mr. Barrow.  

  He stares at Lucy.  They share a moment of quiet conspiracy.

                              LUCY
                Hi, Don.

                              DON
                Hi.

  Now Don looks down at his feet.  Barrow plows ahead.

                                BARROW
                Really great job on the Holt 
                McLaren and Julia Myers of it all.  
                Very nice.  You re a terrific 
                  playmaker...keep it up.

  Don doesn t answer.  Just keeps working.  Finally Barrow just 
  starts off.  He stops and turns back to Lucy.

                                BARROW (CONT D)
                You ll let me know if you turn up 
                anything on Prince Tyreese.

                              LUCY
                      (cold)
                You re always my first call, Alex.

  Barrow exits.

                              LUCY (CONT D)
                Don?

  Don stops his work and looks at Lucy.  Looks away.

                              DON
                Yes.                                                                                26.



                              LUCY
                See if you can get any dirt on the 
                lead singer of a band called 
                Student Driver.  His name is Kai... 
                  something.

                              DON
                 Kay.


  Holt sits in front of Julia s massive plasma screen watching 
  TV.

                              HOLT
                Oh, crap...here it is...

                              JULIA
                Don t watch it.  It ll just make 
                you crazy.

  ON TV

    A ridiculous GRAPHIC spins into relief:

  STAR STALKERS!

  Followed by the coiffed and heavily made-up ANCHORS of the 
  show, DEBBIE CALHOUN and MITCH SAVAGE.  They do cheerful 
  banter over a shot from Don s handicam of Holt taking a swing 
  at camera.  

  FREEZE FRAME on the ugliest, most angry shot of Holt.

                              DEBBIE CALHOUN
                Can you say  anger management 
                issues?   

                              MITCH SAVAGE
                Anger management issues!

                              DEBBIE CALHOUN
                Very good!

                              MITCH SAVAGE
                I m Mitch Savage...

                                DEBBIE CALHOUN
                And I m Debbie Calhoun...

                              MITCH SAVAGE
                And tonight we ll see how a little 
                  jealousy...                                                                                27.



  Now a shot of Julia and Johnny with their arms around each 
  other posing for photos...then again the ugly shot of Holt 
  swinging at Don...

                                DEBBIE CALHOUN
                Goes a lonnnnng way...

                              MITCH SAVAGE
                From deep in the  where-are-they-
                now  file...the tortured romance of 
                  America s Sweetheart Julia Myers 
                and hot-head Holt McLaren...

                              MITCH AND DEBBIE
                On Star Stalkers!

                                DEBBIE CALHOUN
                Julia Myers and Johnny Cole are 
                heating up the screen in the new 
                  thriller, Subliminal Velocity...

                              MITCH SAVAGE
                But Julia s unemployed real-life 
                love interest, Holt McLaren put a 
                damper on the movie s premiere last 
                night when he started a fight with 
                  a journalist--

  Julia turns off the TV.

                              JULIA
                Let s go to Kira s party and get 
                really high.


  He pays his money and walks through the turnstile. 

  ON THE SCREEN

  A bunch of young naked men in a barracks. One of them is 
    surreptitiously masturbating.  His bunk mate sees what he s 
  up to.  And they re off...

  IN THE THEATRE                                                                                28.



  It s very dark.  By the light of the screen, we see Don 
  watching the movie dispassionately.

  Don produces a small NVDV (Night Vision Digital Video) camera 
  and palms it.  It s so dark we can t really see, so let s 
  play the rest of the scene through NVDV.

  He makes his way through the theatre.  Huddled figures, some 
  seated, some standing, engage is various sex acts. Don spots 
    Kai...another guy is walking away from him through the aisle.

  Don sits down near Kai.  

                              DON
                Hey.

  Kai doesn t say anything, just starts rubbing Don s cock 
  through his trousers.  Don panics.

                              DON (CONT D)
                Ow!

                              KAI
                  Sorry...you into it or not?

                              DON
                  Uhhhhhm...wanna go somewhere?

                              KAI
                Here s cool.  C mon, dude, I ll do 
                you so good...

                              DON
                  Um...wanna be with me and...my 
                  girlfriend?

                              KAI
                Sorry, dude...not into fish. 

  Don stands abruptly and walks away.

                              DON
                 Kay.


  Don shows the tape of Kai to Lucy.  She watches in silence.

                              DON
                Is he a friend of yours?

                              LUCY
                No.

                              DON
                Is he famous?                                                                                29.



                              LUCY
                No, and he never will be.


  MUSIC plays throughout: Acid Mothers Temple s  Psych Drone. 

  Actors, directors, models...most of them on the upward 
    trajectory of their careers, a few on the slippery slope 
  down.  The feeling is aggressively casual, every person aware 
  that their every move is being studied and summarily judged, 
  while acting as if they re just hanging out with their dear 
  friends.  

  None more so than Kira Klay and Julia Myers, in the brief 
  flower at the height of their celebrity.  And they huddle at 
  the center of the party feeling the envy wash over them.  
  They laugh at each others  private jokes, clutch each other, 
  kiss each other...each a narcissistic mirror for the other.

  All around the party, a bazaar of drug and alcohol choices; 
  it s a frat party with money.  Coke over here, tabs of acid 
  there, E, shrooms, weed, Jagermeister, Chardonnay, Jack 
  Daniels, beer...

                              JULIA
                Your skin...

                              KIRA
                What?

                              JULIA
                It s like...glowing!  Are you 
                getting laid?

  Kira looks away.

                              KIRA
                I wish.

                              JULIA
                Hey, some guy gave me some E.

                              KIRA
                E...how retro.

  Kira just opens her mouth and puts out her tongue like she s 
  receiving communion, hands in prayer position.  Julia lays 
  the pill on her tongue.  They do their actress-y bi-curious 
  schtick.                                                                                30.



                              KIRA (CONT D)
                Bless me father...

                              JULIA 
                Watch it, I may try to bugger you.

  Kira grabs a beer from a passing young actor dude, washes 
  down the E.

                                                                      TIME CUT:


  Holt zones out looking into the fridge.  

  CLOSE ON HOLT

  On his face with the glow from the fridge light on it.  His 
  mouth is slightly agape.  He s wrecked. 

  OFFSCREEN

  Other people try to get inside the fridge, but Holt is frozen 
  there, looking in to the land of chilled bright bottles.  We 
  see Holt hearing the following exchange...one of those 
  moments where you can hear perfectly people who think you 
  can t hear them at all.

                                OFFSCREEN VOICE
                Hey, dude...it s just a fridge.  

                                OFFSCREEN VOICE 2
                C mon, I wanna get a beer.

                                OFFSCREEN VOICE
                He can t hear us.  He s cashed.

                                OFFSCREEN VOICE 3
                Hey, it s Holt McLaren.

                                OFFSCREEN VOICE 
                He was awesome in Another Word For 
                Love.

  We re still on Holt, no change in his expression.

                                OFFSCREEN VOICE 2 
                What s he been doing since then, 
                besides selling out?

                                OFFSCREEN VOICE 3
                He s been in fronta this fuckin  
                fridge!

  They all laugh.  Holt does not move.                                                                                31.




  Holt staggers in, the California King bed is covered in 
  coats.  Beautiful coats from Barneys and Fred Segal.  Coats 
  of new money. 

  He looks at the coats with longing.  Then he falls on to the 
  bed, burrowing deep into the coats, until he disappears into 
  a pile of shearling and vintage leather.


  From above, Don s bed.  

  A dirty Bed, Bath and Beyond comforter.  Next to him, Tristan 
  is curled, asleep.

  Don s face is obscured by a copy of Celebrity Skin.  He stops 
  on a picture.  One hand goes under the covers.  The magazine 
  lowers slightly, revealing Don s face, beginning to give over 
  to some kind of flatlined ecstasy.

  The dirty covers move rhythmically.  We CRANE UP and away 
  from the bed.


  Looking down on Lucy s bed now.  Lucy is lying down, 
  literally surrounded and almost buried in tabloid headlines 
  and pictures...she has all the mock-ups in bed with her, 
  working.  The graphic, soulless Prince Tyreese pics next to 
  pictures of pregnant stars, fat talk show hosts, Elvis 
  pics...

  She moves one aside and now she s looking right up at us.  
  She looks small and lost in the sea of tabloids.  She stares 
  into CAMERA for an uncomfortable moment.

  She puts both hands to her face, as if to hide.


  Kira and Julia enter the bedroom, both gakked on E.

                              KIRA
                You look hot.

  Kira takes out a vial of coke and gives Julia a bump.

                              JULIA
                You look hot.

  Now Kira takes a bump.  She looks at Julia, for a second it 
  looks like she s going to kiss her, but she bursts into 
  tears.                                                                                32.



                              JULIA (CONT D)
                What?  What s wrong, sweetie? 

  Kira does another bump.

                              JULIA (CONT D)
                What?  You can tell me, whatever it 
                is.

                              KIRA
                I m fucking pregnant.

                              JULIA
                Oh, baby...

  She holds Kira.  Kira loses it.

                              JULIA (CONT D)
                Who?

                              KIRA
                That indie art-house loser Jeff 
                  Stagliano.

                              JULIA
                Oh, crap...how--

                              KIRA
                      (unhinged, through her 
                        tears)
                I met him when they were doing a 
                  retrospective of his films at the 
                  Egyptian...can you imagine a 
                  retrospective of that shit? 
                I m just so screwed, Julia...

                              JULIA
                Well, you can always, y know--

                              KIRA 
                Dude, I am so totally Catholic.

                              JULIA
                Does he know?

                              KIRA
                Nobody knows.  Except you.

  SFX -- A WHITE SCREEN

  With an almost-invisible speck of DARK.                                                                                  33.



  The speck GROWS in size until we descend far enough to 
  realize we are CRANING DOWN, as if from heaven, toward the 
  bedroom and its contents...descending, spirailing down an 
  endless white chimney until we can see the outer periphery of 
  the room, Kira and Julia hugging, the bed...

  ...And we PUSH IN closer on the bed, on the coats, until we 
  can see a crack between the coats and see--

  HOLT S EYES

  Wide, burning.

  We PUSH IN until the eyes fill the screen.  

  We PUSH IN further, until one blazing orb fills the screen, 
  and PUSH IN still further, until it is just his pupil and we 

                                                              SMASH TO BLACK:


                                END OF ACT ONE                                                                                34.


                                    ACT TWO

  FADE IN:


  Don wakes up, gasps.  

  DON S POV

  Hovering over the bed, the Sad Cat Man.

  Don quickly looks over next to him, Tristan is sleeping.  He 
  looks back and the Sad Cat Man is gone. 


  A table lined with pill bottles.  Dozens and dozens of them.  
  Don looks through them.  He talks on the phone.

                              DON
                  I...don t want to come in.  I just 
                need the Zeldox, the Risperdol, the 
                Zyprexa and the Ariprozole.  Why 
                can t she just refill them over the 
                phone?  I don t...want to.  I don t 
                want to.


  Kai enters and sees Lucy sitting in his living room.  He 
  tries to act cool.  

                              KAI
                Oh, hey...Sinead.

                              LUCY
                What did you do to me that night?

                              KAI
                  We...went home and...y know...

  Lucy is furious, shaking...She holds up Don s tape.

                              LUCY
                The Tom Kat.  You don t like girls, 
                Kai.  What did you do to me, you 
                  sonofabitch?  You got about five 
                seconds before I find a way to make 
                you a news story and then bury you 
                for the rest of your life.

                              KAI
                  Okay...okay...I know who you are.  
                I know you re Lucy Spiller.                                                                                  35.



                              LUCY
                So what?

                              KAI
                So you re a starmaker.  I wanna be 
                a star.  I thought if you thought 
                we were fucking...you d want to 
                help me.

                              LUCY
                You didn t actually want to--

                              KAI
                I m 22.  Look at me.  I quit 
                  modelling to focus on my band.  I 
                mean, no offense, but you re 
                  what...forty?

                              LUCY
                      (quietly)
                More or less.

                              KAI
                You really think a 23 year-old 
                model s gonna hit on you just for 
                sex?  People want you for who you 
                are, for what you can do for them.  

  Lucy stands up.  

                              LUCY
                Stop talking before this tape finds 
                its way into the public eye.  It 
                might find its way there anyway.

                              KAI
                So you re definitely not gonna help 
                us--

                              LUCY
                Shut up, before I bury you.   

  She stands at the door.  

                              LUCY (CONT D)
                And I listened to your demo.  It 
                sucks.


  Don blinks rapidly, trying to banish the luminous trail.  Now 
    WHISPERING VOICES begin, voices we will come to know.

                                WHISPERING VOICE ONE
                Don!  Don!  Don!  Don!  Don!  

    WHISPERING VOICE ONE laughs, a high and disturbing laugh.

                                WHISPERING VOICE TWO
                You re a worm...no, you re 
                  a...paramecium!

                                WHISPERING VOICE THREE
                Don?  I love you, Donny.  Don?  I 
                love you, Donny.  Listen to me!

                              DON
                No, no, no, no, nonononononono.


  DR. SHAMBAN, a pretty and impossibly young-looking 
      psychopharmacologist, examines Don.                                                                                  38.

                And you haven t been seeing a 
                  therapist?

                              DON
                Nope.

                              DR. SHAMBAN
                I m going to recommend very 
                strongly once again that you see a 
                therapist.  You have the money, you 
                have insurance. I have a list here.

                              DON
                If I could just get the--

                              DR. SHAMBAN 
                You can t treat these drugs like a 
                  smorgasbord and just take the ones 
                you feel like taking, Don.

                              DON
                 Kay.  Could I just get the Zeldox, 
                the Risperdol, the Zyprexa and the 
                  Ariprozole?

                              DR. SHAMBAN
                Don, you are one of the lucky 
                people who have a form of 
                  schizophrenia that s manageable.  
                Most people aren t so fortunate.

                              DON
                I know.

                              DR. SHAMBAN
                You have to respect the disease and 
                respect its treatment.

                              DON
                 Kay.  I ll respect the disease.  
                Could I get the Zeldox, the 
                  Risperdol, the Zyprexa and the 
                  Ariprozole?

  Dr. Shamban shakes her head.  Not getting anywhere.

                              DR. SHAMBAN
                All right.  But I want to see you 
                in three weeks.

  Off Don, eyes glued to her prescription pad.                                                                                39.




  Don walks to the pharmacy at the rear of the store.  The 
  VOICES are back.  

                              WHISPERING VOICE ONE
                Don!  Don!  Don!

                              WHISPERING VOICE TWO
                Hey, cockass...hey!...Donny 
                  littledick!

                              DON
                Am not.  I m average.

                              WHISPERING VOICE TWO
                Hey, dickweed, I can read your 
                  thoughts.  And I work for NASA.  We 
                have the satellite pointed at you.

  IN THE PHARMACY LINE

  Don stands there with his prescriptions.  Different SHAPES 
  move at the periphery of the scene, ducking into the aisles.  
  Don is getting pretty twitchy, mumbling responses to the 
  voices.

                              WHISPERING VOICE THREE
                I love you, Donny.

                              DON
                  Please...just...go back.

  Don looks up to see the back of the head of the guy in front 
  of him.  The back of the guy s head is morphing into the face 
  of a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

                                WHISPERING VOICE THREE/BACK-OF-HEAD-
                              WOMAN 
                Kiss me, Donny.  I love you so 
                much, just kiss me.

                              DON
                No...not here.

                                WHISPERING VOICE THREE/BACK-OF-HEAD-
                              WOMAN
                I ll scream.

                              DON
                No!

                                WHISPERING VOICE THREE/BACK-OF-HEAD-
                              WOMAN
                I ll scream, Don.  Kiss me.                                                                                40.



  Don closes his eyes and leans forward to kiss the face in the 
  back of the guy s head...

  Don stumbles.  The guy has moved forward in line, the face is 
  gone.

  Don breathes in sharply.  A SLITHERING, DEMONIC SHAPE slimes 
  by and into one of the aisles.  Don is wigging out.

                                PHARMACIST S HELPER
                Can I help you?

  Don thrusts the scrips into her hands.  

                              DON
                I need the Zeldox, the Risperdol, 
                the Zyprexa and the Ariprozole.

                                PHARMACIST S HELPER
                No problem.  It ll be about forty-
                five minutes.

                              DON
                 Kay.

                              WHISPERING VOICE TWO
                She s been hired to poison you.

                              DON
                No!

                                PHARMACIST S HELPER
                I m sorry?

  Don turns and runs out of the store.

  DAY

  Lucy enters on her cell.  

                              LUCY
                I ll call you back.  Yeah.

                              BARROW
                You have something working with 
                Holt McLaren?

                              LUCY
                I have more things working than you 
                could possibly imagine.                                                                                41.



                                BARROW
                Whatever you re working, I want a 
                piece of it. 

                              LUCY
                You re the boss.  You have a piece 
                of it, regardless.  Just don t get 
                confused and think that means you 
                could wipe your ass without me.  
                I m placing this piece in The Bomb, 
                it s too dirty for NOW magazine.  

                              BARROW
                I want credit if it goes somewhere 
                and Corporate wants to know whose 
                piece it is.

                              LUCY
                Tell you what: Why don t you stop 
                behaving as if I m gonna lop off 
                your manhood and let me do my job.  
                I develop sources, find stories, 
                get the biggest scoops in the 
                  world...and you take the 
                  advertisers to Benihana and grab 
                credit for it all while going home 
                with five times my salary.  Sound 
                good?

  Barrow just looks at her.

                              LUCY (CONT D)
                Because if it doesn t, my sources 
                could dry up or go to the Star.  

                              BARROW 
                You want my job.

                              LUCY
                I d kill myself if I had your job.  
                I like to get dirty.  

                              BARROW
                So I hear.

  She goes to the door.

                              LUCY 
                I don t want your job, Alex.  I 
                want your salary.


  MUSIC: The La s,  Man I m Only Human 

  Julia is face down on the bed, sobbing.  Holt sits next to 
  her, rubbing her back.

                              JULIA
                      (between sobs)
                She thinks I told The Bomb about 
                it...she thinks I told them...they 
                sent her publicist a fax saying 
                they were gonna run it in the next 
                issue.  She said she d never speak 
                to me again.  I would never...you 
                know I would never...

  CLOSE ON HOLT

                              JULIA (CONT D)
                Kira has nobody...I m so lucky I 
                have you.

  Music continues as--


  Lucy drinks from red wine from a big glass.  DiStefano sings 
  Boito s Mefistofele (Death of Faust) loudly on the stereo.

  She looks at the Prince Tyreese photos.  They are damning by 
  any measure; graphic, weird, violent, drug-filled, even a 
  series of the Prince getting banged with a strap-on.  

  She lines several of them up together.  Clicks on her large 
  computer monitor through several layouts she s roughed out.

  They are typical tabloid headlines of the  CAUGHT! , 
     BUSTED! , and  FALLEN IDOL  variety.  She takes a huge belt 
  on the wine.                                                                                  46.



  She picks up the phone, calls.  INTERCUT Leo as necessary.

                              LEO
                Hello?

                              LUCY
                It s me.  Why are you home picking 
                up on the first ring?

                              LEO
                Because I m a lonely bisexual man 
                with a shaved head.

                              LUCY
                One thing a bisexual man should 
                never have to be is lonely.

                              LEO
                What are you doing?  Trolling the 
                internet for someone to drug you 
                and bang the crap out of you?  

                              LUCY
                  Funny...nothing...looking at 
                pictures of Prince Tyreese.

                              LEO 
                Naked?

                              LUCY
                  Actually, yes.

                              LEO
                I ll be right over.

                              LUCY
                  Right...like you d ever leave your 
                cave at night to see your sister.

                              LEO
                I didn t say I was coming to see 
                you, I said I was coming to see my

                              LUCY
                Don t bother...it s depressing.  

                              LEO
                You re a little drunk, aren t you?

                              LUCY

                              LEO
                I m glad I don t have your job.                                                                                47.



                              LUCY
                I love my job.

                              LEO
                Oh yeah, I can tell.  Do you think 
                someday we ll have to pay for our 
                sins?    

                              LUCY
                What s that supposed to mean?

                              LEO
                Don t be so sensitive...it s just a 
                  question.

  Lucy turns the pictures over.  Shakes her head.  Now from the 
  stereo, the basso profundo of the Devil...

                              LUCY 
                      (sarcastic)
                Well, you ve made my night.

                              LEO
                Yeah, this has been great.  Think 
                I ll go run a bath and slit my 
                wrists.

                              LUCY
                Does this mean you won t be bugging 
                me any more?

                              LEO
                Bye.

  The wailing tenor of di Stefano is now joined by the voices 
  of the Mefistofele chorus...Lucy finishes the wine.


  Don carries Tristan in his arms, cradling him like a newborn.  

  Don reaches his shag-carpeted living room and sets Tristan 
  down on a cat bed.  Goes to an old-fashioned portable Hi-Fi 
  and turns it on.  We hear the warm HISS of the old vacuum 
  tubes coming to life. 

  He carefully slides an old phonograph record out of its 
  sleeve and lays it on the turntable.  Sets down the needle.  

  HAWAIIAN MUSIC, dreamy and nostalgic, especially with the 
  static of the phonograph.  Steel pedal guitar, far-away 
  vocals,  ukulele...

  Don pets Tristan.                                                                                48.



                              DON
                Hey Tristan, that s my buddy...you 
                like that...that s my buddy.

                              TRISTAN
                It s all coming to an end, Don.

  Don blinks, looking at Tristan.  The sweet music continues. 

                              DON
                What, buddy?

  A LOUD RUMBLING, like an earthquake.  Don looks up; a small 
  but definite CRACK appears in the wall of the apartment.  The 
  record skips, then continues on.  The overhead light fixture 
  sways.  SOUND of GALLOPING HORSES.

  Don carries Tristan to the window and looks outside.  People 
  walking and driving, nothing out of the ordinary, except--

  HUGE FLASHES OF LIGHT in the sky illuminating what appear to 
  be ARCHANGELS, winged heroic figures...the light flickers and 
  they re gone.  The Hawaiian music continues as--


                                END OF ACT TWO                                                                                49.


                                  ACT THREE


  Lucy opens her eyes.  She s hung over.  Sits up and gets out 
  of bed.  

  She walks into the--

  KITCHEN

  And starts to make coffee.

  PHONE RINGS...she lets the machine pick up.

                              DOROTHY (V.O.)
                Hello?  Hello?  Am I...oh...Lucy?

  Lucy almost picks up, can t bear it.

                              DOROTHY (CONT D)
                I just woke up and...is it just 
                because I m sick, or...is it all 
                changing?  Is the world 
                  more...closed in?  I just want you 
                to be happy.  Your father and 
                I...after the war...we were 
                happy...I think...

  The machine cuts her off with an abrupt  Thank you for your 
  call. 

  Lucy looks down into the counter.  Clicks the coffee machine 
  on.


  Holt sits in the outer office, trying to act cool. 

  SYDNEY POLLACK comes out of the office.

                              SYDNEY POLLACK
                Jeremy!  Hey, c mon in...

                                SYDNEY POLLACK
                Right!  Of course.  We ve had so 
                many people in and out of this 
                part.

                              HOLT
                Yeah.

                                SYDNEY POLLACK
                Anyway, c mon in...                                                                                50.




  Sydney Pollack and Holt sit there uncomfortably.

                              SYDNEY POLLACK
                Great piece the other day in NOW.  
                You re all over the place.

                              HOLT
                Oh, thanks, yeah...

                              SYDNEY POLLACK
                Now, with all this stuff you have 
                in the works, are you still 
                  available?

                              HOLT 
                For what?

                              SYDNEY POLLACK
                The Generic Effect.  Playing 
                Carson.  In my movie.  I want to 
                hire you.

                              HOLT
                Oh my God...thank you.  Yes, I am 
                  absolutely available. 

                                SYDNEY POLLACK
                Great.  We re closing Clooney s 
                deal and just had the offer 
                accepted by Kira Klay.

  A beat.

                              HOLT
                Oh...I know Kira.  She s...a 
                friend. 

                                SYDNEY POLLACK
                See the way things work out?  
                  Fantastic.  Anyway, I have a three 
                o clock.  Congrats, Galt.

                              HOLT
                  It s...thank you.


  As she and Barrow look at the photos.

                                BARROW
                Are you kidding?

  She just looks at him?                                                                                51.



                                BARROW (CONT D)
                You know what they re gonna say in 
                  corporate?

                              LUCY
                The strap-on looks painful?

  Barrow slides the photos back across the desk at her.

                                BARROW
                You can t run these.

  Lucy tries to contain her rage...

                              LUCY
                Do you know how hard I worked to 
                get these photos?  Do you have any 
                idea what they ll do to 
                  circulation?  You can t just--

                                BARROW
                I can t just what?  You walk around 
                here like you got my balls in a 
                  vise...but you know who calls the 
                shots here, don t you?

                              LUCY
                      (smiles)
                Yeah, the suits over in the 
                  corporate.  Sure as hell ain t you.

                                BARROW
                Oh, yeah?  Try this:  Run these and 
                get fired.  Leak  em and get sued.

  Off Lucy--


  Kira sits on the floor of her big house, a copy of The Bomb 
  with the damning cover next to her.  And a mirror.  And a 
  couple empty bottles of Dom.  

  She leans down into the mirror and we see her in extreme red-
  eyed, glassed-out CLOSE-UP... 


  DANCE MUSIC is up and bumping, shirts are coming off, sweat 
    pouring...

  A group of HOLLYWOOD GROOVSTERS, Holt and Julia at their 
  center, dance in a big circle, cutting loose... 

  Holt is finally letting go, enjoying a moment of success and 
    celebration...                                                                                52.



  Julia dances with Holt, dirty-dogging him, giving him her 
  booty.  She turns around and pulls off his shirt, uses it to 
  wrap around him and grind him in closer... 

  Feather in...MUSIC: Yoko Ono,  Listen The Snow Is Falling 


  The Yoko Ono track surging now...

  Back on the floor.  The mirror, the empty bottles, but no 
  Kira.

  TRACK through the darkened house, to a brightly lit bathroom, 
  door ajar.  White floor tile.  Kira s perfect, pedicured 
  feet.


  A table read.  All the actors are milling around, drinking 
  coffee and checking each other out.  P.A.s run around 
  preparing a table with bagels that none of the actors eat.

  Holt sits at his place at the table, just two away from the 
  star of the movie.  He mouths lines, looks at his already-dog-
  eared script, tries to calm his blown-out nerves.  No sign of 
  Clooney or Kira Klay.

  Sydney Pollack enters the room gravely.  Everybody quiets 
  down.

                                SYDNEY POLLACK 
                Well, this is a crazy day.  A movie 
                I ve been trying to get made for 
                four years is cast, with a cast any 
                director would die for.  So today 
                began as a high point for me.  I 
                even got new shoes.

  He holds out a foot with a new shoe.  Actors laugh nervously.

                                SYDNEY POLLACK (CONT D)
                I m driving over here and on the 
                way I get a call from Kira s 
                manager, Amy Blenson...she tells me 
                Kira s had a medical emergency.  
                She s okay, but she s not only out 
                of the movie, she s going to be 
                taking time off from the business 
                and really re-evaluating her place 
                here.  I thought, okay, as long as 
                she s okay, there are a dozen 
                  actresses who can play the part.  
                Not forty five seconds later, I get 
                a call from Clooney.  Can t imagine 
                anyone but Kira in the part...says 
                it s too delicate, like gossamer, 
                it s gotta be her or he s out.

  The whole picture begins to dawn on Holt.  He opens his mouth 
  wide, like a fish on the deck of a boat, impotently trying to 
  get a breath.

                                SYDNEY POLLACK (CONT D)
                  So...enjoy some coffee and a bagel.  
                I hope it all changes in the next 
                48 hours...but I ve been doing this 
                long enough to know how these 
                things tend to play out. 

  Some of the actors grab their bags and go, several just mill 
  around.                                                                                54.



  Holt sits in his seat, going through his script.  He looks at 
  his careful notations, the highlighted lines...

  His face sets into a mask of deep anger and resolve.  He 
  storms out, leaving his script behind.


  Holt sits watching Lucy on her wireless headset walking 
  around.  Don sits at the other end of the couch.

                              LUCY
                      (into headset)
                  Right...well, you talk to legal, 
                see what they have to say. 

  Holt stands up, tries to interject, but Lucy holds up her 
  hand, she ll be done in a sec.

  Now Holt is standing, not knowing what to do with himself.

                              LUCY (CONT D)
                Anyway, I have to run...a friend 
                just stopped by.

   As she finishes up the call, Alexander Barrow enters.

                              LUCY (CONT D)
                Love to Raj...bye.

  Lucy turns her gaze on Holt and Don and Barrow.

                              LUCY (CONT D)
                Now, what can I do for the 
                  exceptionally talented Holt 
                McLaren?  Besides receiving his 
                undying gratitude for the beautiful 
                profile in NOW Magazine?

  Holt s a little thrown, but plows forward.

                              HOLT
                I m not going to give you any more.  
                Not about my friends or my enemies.  
                Kira is in the hospital because I 
                told you--

                              LUCY
                Kira s in the hospital because 
                she s a drug addict.  And she s 
                going to be fine.                                                                                55.



                              HOLT
                That s not the point.  The point is 
                that you people--

                              LUCY
                First of all, you re welcome for 
                the nearly 800-word profile in NOW 
                Magazine as well as the three other 
                  carefully crafted tidbits we ve 
                managed to pepper throughout our 
                little media empire, which any 
                  publicist would sacrifice a left 
                nut for.  Secondly, you are now a 
                source.  And I feel that we can do 
                great things together.  You, me and 
                Don here.  Not that Don is an 
                  employee, actually a freelance 
                  contractor.

  Don looks around.

                              DON
                I like this office.

                              HOLT
                I don t give a crap what he is, I m 
                not gonna help you guys out 
                anymore.

                              LUCY
                Poor Julia.

                              HOLT
                Don t give me that--  

                              LUCY
                When she finds out about your 
                  betrayal.  Poor thing.  I know she 
                adores you.

  Holt takes a deep breath, willing to lose it all.

                              HOLT
                You know what?  She ll either 
                  understand or she won t.  I don t 
                care.  You can tell her whatever 
                you want.  I love her and she loves 
                me.  

                              LUCY
                Brave.

                              HOLT
                Fuck you.

  Barrow shakes his head.                                                                                56.



                              LUCY 
                Don, will you get the lights?

                              HOLT
                What are you doing?

  Don goes over to the door and turns off the office lights.  

                              LUCY
                You know what we love here at 
                    Transcommunication Media?  Home 
                movies.  Nothing has the smack of 
                the genuine like home-made porn. 

  Lucy puts a DVD in the deck.  Blue-screen comes on, then a 
  home-made video flickers to life.

  THE VIDEO

    A poorly-lit DV.  Broken down and pixilated, but ultimately 
  engaging.

  JULIA MYERS sits on a messy bed.

                              JULIA
                I am so wasted.

                                OFFSCREEN VOICE
                  (unintelligible)

                              JULIA
                What are you doing?

                                OFFSCREEN VOICE
                  (unintelligible)

  A body crosses frame, then again, then...

  JOHNNY COLE

  Sits on the bed next to Julia.  Starts kissing her.

                              JULIA
                  ....don t Really want to do this...

                                JOHNNY COLE
                You know you do.

                              JULIA
                Can t even focus my eyes...

  He kisses her, takes off her shirt.  It all moves very 
  quickly now.  

  We move from the video to Holt s face in the dim light.                                                                                  57.



  RETURN TO VIDEO

  Now Johnny Cole is behind Julia.  He wraps her long hair in a 
  knot around his hand and snaps her head back.

                                JOHNNY COLE
                You like that?

                              JULIA
                      (faintly, high)
                Yes...

  Lucy stops the tape.  Walks over and turns up the lights.

                              LUCY
                That s enough.

  Holt looks down at the floor.

                              DON
                Hoo-ee.  

                                BARROW
                So, if that were to be released, it 
                might not square too well with your 
                gal s wholesome image on her TV 
                show.  And you come off like a 
                little cuckold bitch.  Bad all 
                around. 

  Holt is shaking, quiet.

                              LUCY 
                Or, you supplement your thin little 
                  guest-spot income with our generous 
                story fees, and get great press 
                along the way.  And you and Julia 
                ride off into the sunset. I 
                honestly would rather not leak 
                this.

  Holt stands up and starts to walk out.  Stops at the door.

                              HOLT
                      (simply)
                I m an actor.  It s all I ever 
                wanted to do.  

                              LUCY 
                      (quietly)
                No, you wanted to be famous.  
                There s a big difference.  
                You can give your dirt to Don.  
                  Whenever.  No rush.  Just make sure 
                it comes regularly.                                                                                58.



  Holt is gone.

  Lucy sighs.  She looks exhausted.  Don still sits there, 
    disassociated, whispering to himself.

                              LUCY (CONT D)
                You can go, Don.

                              DON
                Huh?

                              LUCY
                Go.  Both of you.


  Wild, filled with SCREAMING KIDS, PRINCE TYREESE and his 
  brood front and center.  His wife, CHELLE, policing kids and 
  pizza slices.

  Prince and three of the kids are skeet bowling, laughing 
  their asses off, cutting loose, the kids hyped up on sugar 
  and games.

    A MOTORCYCLE MESSENGER, helmet on, visor up, walks in and 
    approaches Tyreese.  Hands him an ENVELOPE before he has time 
  to react.

  Chelle, with the younger kids, notices her husband receiving 
  the envelope.

  Tyreese opens the envelope.  Looks.  Drops it.  Quickly picks 
  it up.  We see a corner of one of the now-familiar photos.  
  He quickly seals the enveloppe as Chelle calls over to him.

                                CHELLE
                What s that?

  Tyreese, his cocky demeanor gone, just shakes his head, 
  chokes out:

                              TYREESE
                  Paperwork.


  MUSIC: Elliott Smith,  Waltz #2 (XO) 

  Holt lays in the massive bed with its turbo thread count 
  sheets, knuckles raw and bruised.  He smokes a joint.

  Julia enters. Boxer shorts and a wife beater.  Her long hair 
  down.                                                                                60.



  Holt takes another hit, can t really look at her.

  Julia doesn t say anything.  Just takes the joint and hits 
  deeply off it.

  They sit up next to each other in bed.  Smoking the joint.  
  Finally:

                              JULIA
                This from Surfer Sean?

                              HOLT
                Yeah.

                              JULIA
                You know I can t smoke this stuff.

                              HOLT
                Why?

                              JULIA
                It makes me too horny.

  She straddles him on the bed.  Takes the joint and puts it 
  out.  They start kissing.  More and more intensely, 
    violently.  She moves on top of him...

  Holt pushes Julia off of him and moves her to her stomach. 

  Now he is grinding on top of her. He pulls her boxer shorts 
  off and is inside her almost instantly.

                              JULIA (CONT D)
                  Yes...yes...ohmygodyes...

  From behind her, Holt sees her long hair...

  He takes her hair deliberately and wraps it in a knot around 
  his hand.  Snaps her head back.  Just like Johnny Cole.

                              HOLT
                You like that?

  Julia GASPS, with pleasure or pain or recognition.

                              JULIA
                Yes...


  In the living room, on the floor, the dead body of Tristan 
  the cat.  A small pool of vomit haloing around his head.

  Don walks in and looks at Tristan.  His normally affectless 
  demeanor drops away.  He falls to his knees.

                              DON
                No.

  He sobs, picking up Tristan and cradling him in his arms.

  He rocks him and rocks him.

  KNOCKING

  At the door.  Insistent.

  KNOCKING

  Louder and louder.

  And under it, WHISPERING VOICES, building in volume.

  KNOCKING          WHISPERING
              KNOCKING
        KNOCKING         WHISPERING
  KNOCKING
        WHISPERING          KNOCKINGKNOCKINGKNOCKING.....


  Don cradling Tristan, the WHISPERS louder and LOUDER......

                                                                SMASH CUT TO:

      BLACK.......................

      .....................SILENCE


  Holt drives, Julia in the passenger seat.  Some unspoken 
  thing vibrating in the car between them.  

  Holt s cell RINGS.                                                                                62.



                              HOLT
                Hello?
                Oh, hey Mr. Pollack...Sydney, 
                sorry...
                  Yeah...yeah...really?
                That s great news...
                No...I haven t booked anything 
                else...
                Are you kidding?  Of course I do.  
                I can t believe Angelina signed on 
                to do the part...
                Okay, I ll be there.  Thank you...
                      (beat)
                Yeah, I heard about what happened 
                to Kira...
                      (beat)
                What?  When?
                      (beat)
                Yeah.  She was a really good 
                  person...
                      (beat)
                  Right...at the memorial.

  Holt keeps driving.  Doesn t say anything.  He pushes the 
  car, redlining the RPMs before shifting up.  Julia just looks 
  at him, waiting.

                              HOLT (CONT D)
                Kira s dead.  She had a brain 
                bleed. 

                              JULIA
                Oh, God...

  He double-clutches and blows into third.  Now they re easily 
  doing 95 through Hollywood traffic.

                              JULIA (CONT D)
                Holt, slow down.  

                              HOLT
                And the movie s back on.  I still 
                have the part. 

  Holt cranks up the STEREO.   I Want to Die  by Brian 
  Jonestown Massacre.  Holt smiles bitterly and floors it.  The 
  whole car shakes, maxing out.

                              JULIA
                Holt, what are you doing?!  

  The engine SCREAMS.  The car pulls around a line of cars, 
  ripping past all of them...Julia is crying.

  ON HOLT                                                                                63.



  A grim smile.  FASTER.

                              JULIA (CONT D)
                Holt, please, please, I m sorry... 
                oh God, oh God, oh God, 
                    ohgodohgodohgod... 

  A JACKED-UP TRUCK 

  Doesn t see the low-slung Porsche and goes to make a left 
  turn...

  JULIA 

  Looks astonished as the big four-wheeler completely blocks 
  their path...

  HOLT

  Sighs with some perverse form of relief...

  THE PORSCHE

  Grinds under the truck, sending up a bright, beautiful shower 
  of sparks through the L.A. night.

  The Porsche is smashed free of the truck and rolls once, 
  twice, lands on its roof.

  Long, ticking beat of SILENCE on the tableau, then:

  STARTING RIGHT-SIDE UP

  Or so it appears, Julia, eyes wide, surprised, gorgeous, 
  blood pooling in each ear, and dripping up.

  NOW ROTATING

  From upside down to right-side up, Julia and Holt hang in 
  their seatbelts.  It is only when we arrive at both of them 
  upside down that we reveal Holt, unharmed, awake, staring at 
  Julia.  She has been frozen in what appears to be death, but 
  suddenly she COUGHS, breathes deep, vomits.

  She looks at Holt in terror.

                              JULIA (CONT D)
                Sorry...

                              HOLT
                It s okay.  It s okay...

  The car is smoking and ticking...  Poof!  A tiny fire ignites 
  near the back of the car...Holt wrenches himself free and out 
  through the window of the car...                                                                                64.



  OUTSIDE THE PORSCHE

  A crowd is gathering, but no emergency vehicles on scene...

  Holt runs around and tries to open the door to get Julia out.  
  The flames are rising on the Porsche...

  Holt looks around, panicked...he sees-- 

  A CROWD OF ONLOOKERS

  Several holding up cell phone cameras, one with a video 
  camera.  

  Holt takes a rock and SMASHES the window.  He takes off his 
  shirt and lines the door frame with it, then proceeds to pry 
  Julia loose from the car and drag her out.  The FIRE creeps 
  into the gas tank and IGNITES for real as now-shirtless Holt 
  carries Julia away from the wreckage...

  Julia is bleeding badly, sheet-white from shock.

  SIRENS WAIL.


  Don sits holding Tristan, the only light coming from his 
    television...the HAWAIIAN music plays on the old hi-fi.

  DON S TV

  A live feed of the local news, showing the outside of the now-
  familiar home of Kira Klay.

  Another shot with the gruesome crash sight.  An inserted RED 
  CARPET SHOT from  Subliminal Velocity  of Holt and Julia with 
  Kira.

  Now the handi-cam footage of shirtless Holt carrying Julia 
  from the crash site as the Porsche ignites in FLAMES behind 
  him, with the headline:  REAL LIFE ACTION HERO.   He does in 
  fact look like a chiseled action hero...and you can bet 
  Hollywood is thinking the same thing.

  Don sits slack-jawed, staring at the television.

  KNOCKING

  At the door again.   Don clutches Tristan and rocks him.

  ON THE TV

  MATCH CUT TV at--                                                                                65.




  HAWAIIAN MUSIC CONTINUES

  Lucy looks at the tv...the footage of Holt carrying Julia 
  from the wreckage...

  Now a HEADSHOT of Kira Klay.   CELEBRITY SUICIDE?  Asks the 
  super.

  Lucy draws a sharp breath, something giving way a little.  
  Pours herself a glass of Pinot.  Drinks unsteadily.

  Picks up the phone.  Fully herself again:

                              LUCY
                Hi, it s Lucy...yeah, I know what 
                time it is...why, you wanna look 
                for another job?  Okay, tell 
                  acquisitions we need to lock up all 
                the Holt McClaren footage...right, 
                motion and still.  We ll go up to 
                eighty, higher if we have 
                  to...right.  We can use some of the 
                Don Konkey stills of Kira.  Try to 
                get someone into the house...with 
                all the coroner s people and 
                  cops...Don ll do it...see if he can 
                get something...uh huh...just do 
                it.  I ll be there in an hour. 


  HAWAIIAN MUSIC CONTINUES OVER:

  JULIA

    Intubated, unconscious, heavily bandaged...

  HOLT

  Sits there next to the bed, head in hands...

  DON

  Loading his cameras and packing up his photo gear...carefully 
  places Tristan in a shoe box and takes him along...

  PRINCE TYREESE

  In his office at home.  He looks at one of the photos, puts a 
  match to it...

  KIRA                                                                                66.



  Lying on the coroner s slab, alabaster, perfect and 
  lifeless...

  LUCY

  In her walk-in closet.  She stands there dressing, putting on 
  another one of her signature sexy-but-efficient suits.  She 
  looks straight into CAMERA...we are the mirror, until she is 
  suited up and turns abruptly and snaps the LIGHT OUT.

  The HAWAIIAN MUSIC continues in BLACK.
