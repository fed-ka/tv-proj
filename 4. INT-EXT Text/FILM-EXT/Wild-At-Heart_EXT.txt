A MAN rides a screaming massive Japanese motorcycle - wound out to
maximum R.P.M. up the street.
CUT TO:
2. SIGN BY ROADSIDE
The sign reads KIDS PLAYING - SPEED BUMPS.
CUT TO:
With a whine from hell, the front tire of the motorcycle hits a speed
bump.
The motorcycle becomes airborne and on the way up slices itself in half
as it scrapes along the full length of a Datsun Kingcab.
In the air, the rider and motorcycle twist violently as they fly by.
The motorcycle bounces off a black 66 Chevrolet and makes a sound like
the end of the world.
The rider hits the same Chevy a moment later.
Like a broken ragdoll
shot from a canon, the man punches through the back window blowing glass
for a block.
He stops somewhere under the front seat and a bubble of
blood forms out his nose.
The motorcycle continues on sliding and spinning with an ear-piercing
howl for one entire city block.
CUT TO:
Two rabid dogs fight ferociously in a vacant lot - ripping each others
flesh.
An OLD COUPLE, both with walkers, inch painfully along nearby.
OLD WOMAN
Oh my God! ... Why they doin that?
OLD MAN
Who the hell knows.
What you have
in your mouth?
The old woman begins to turn away, covering her mouth with her hand.
OLD MAN
Spit it out!!! ... Pull your teeth
out ... doctor said.
What you
tryin to do?
SPIT IT OUT!!!
The Old Man grabs the Old Woman by the neck and squeezes.
Out comes a
tangled and sticky ball of hard fruit candies.
CUT TO:
5. WASP NEST
A thousand wasps hover threateningly in the air around the nest.
A
SMALL GROUP OF HARDENED CRIMINAL NINE-YEAR OLDS sporting hideous grins,
bat the nest violently to and fro with sticks.
One kid busies himself
shooting a large can of Black Flag garden spray into a crack in the
nest.
Another stomps half-dead wasps up and down the sidewalk.
All the
kids are making animal noises of one sort or the other.
CUT TO:
A beat-up, red 64 Ford Falcon station wagon filled with insane
TEENAGERS on speed and PCP race out of control down the street past the
club - leaning out the car in every direction.
They scream out to the
desolate-looking passerby.
TEENAGERS
EAT SHIT MOTHERFUCKERS!!!!!!
The camera cranes up to the neon club sign and gets lost among the hot
pink neon, the frantic moths and the intense electric buzz.
CUT TO:
Plumes of smoke from fires rise in the distance.
DISSOLVE TO:
The electronic garage door opens and Lula drives her 80 Black Camaro
out and away.
The garage door closes automatically.
CUT TO:
Lula drives fast up a neighborhood street.
She turns a corner and
disappears.
CUT TO:
Marietta leaves her Cadillac Seville in her driveway and enters the
house.
We can hear her calling out for Lula in the distance.
The
calling changes - it becomes angry.
The garage door opens and Marietta
comes storming out.
She leaps in her Caddy and peels out.
CUT TO:
Sailor is waiting out front as Lula pulls up in her T-Bird - throwing
out a cloud of dust.
Theyre both smiling.
LULA
Hey baby...
SAILOR
Peanut...
They kiss tenderly and then Sailor walks around the car to get in while
Lula opens up a suitcase and gets out his snakeskin jacket.
SAILOR
Hey, my snakeskin jacket...
Thanks,
baby...
Did I ever tell you that
this here jacket for me is a symbol
of my individuality and my belief
in personal freedom?
LULA
Bout fifty thousand times.
I got
us a room at the Cape Fear, and
guess what?...
I hear Powermads
at The Hurricane.
SAILOR
(smiling)
Stab it and steer.
Lula tromps it and throws out an even larger cloud of dust.
CUT TO:
Marietta is escorting MARCELLO SANTOS and two stiff drinks to a table in
her backyard.
SANTOS
I knew youd want it again...
MARIETTA
Thats not why I called.
SANTOS
Oh yeah - sure ... okay.
MARIETTA
Santos...
It isnt.
SANTOS
Have it your way...
But you want it.
MARIETTA
Lulas gone off with Sailor.
SANTOS
What do you want me to do about it?
MARIETTA
I want you to take care of Sailor, so
he wont ever be able to bother my
baby again.
SANTOS
Take care of him?
MARIETTA
Yes.
SANTOS
What does take care of him mean?...
Do you want me to give him food or
some clothing?
MARIETTA
Whats with you?...
You know what
take care of him means.
I dont
call Santos except for one big reason.
SANTOS
Big is the key word, and Im telling
you I want it bad.
MARIETTA
I want you to get rid of Sailor.
SANTOS
Get rid of him?
MARIETTA
Yes...
Get rid of him.
SANTOS
How would I do that?
Send him on a
trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
MARIETTA
Santos, why in hell do you insist on
playin this stupid game?
SANTOS
Just tell me what you want.
MARIETTA
I dont need to explain anymoren I
have...
You know damn well.
SANTOS
You need to explain it.
MARIETTA
All right...
I want you ... to ...
kill ... Sailor...
As simple as that.
SANTOS
Simple?
Kill him?...
How?
MARIETTA
Thats your business...
I dont care
how.
SANTOS
Like an accident where maybe Lula
might also get hurt?
MARIETTA
NO...
For Gods sakes, Santos!
SANTOS
Well, like kill him with the atomic
bomb?
MARIETTA
Santos...
SANTOS
Explain it...
I told you.
MARIETTA
Shoot him.
SANTOS
Shoot him?
Like with a gun?
MARIETTA
Yes.
SANTOS
Where?...
In the leg?
MARIETTA
No.
SANTOS
Where?
MARIETTA
In the head.
SANTOS
Shoot Sailor in the head with a
gun...
Now Im beginning to get
it...
You want me to shoot Sailor
in the head with a gun.
MARIETTA
Yes.
SANTOS
But where in the head?...
Not the
chin, I hope.
MARIETTA
No...
In the brains...
What little
Im sure he has.
SANTOS
You want me to shoot Sailor in the
brains with a gun.
MARIETTA
Yes.
SANTOS
Through the forehead?
MARIETTA
Yes.
SANTOS
Wrong!
Its much better to blow a
hole in the back of the head ...
right toward the bridge of the nose
...
Lots and lots of irreparable
damage.
MARIETTA
See!
I knew you had it all under
control.
SANTOS
Why didnt you send Johnnie Farragut?
MARIETTA
Maybe I did...
Try New Orleans first...
Lula cant ever stop talkin bout that
town.
SANTOS
On one condition...
He pauses and smiles strangely.
SANTOS
You give me your permission to kill
Johnnie Farragut.
MARIETTA
(whisper)
Santos...
No...
Please, Santos...
SANTOS
Youre not tellin me that youre
sweet on him?
MARIETTA
No...
But...
SANTOS
One day hes gonna find out what
were up to with Mr. Reindeer, and
he could cause us a lot of trouble.
They stare at each other for a moment.
SANTOS
Im gonna take your silence as a
yes...
MARIETTA
Santos...
I cant...
SANTOS
Shhhh...
Its all right...
Also, I
either take you or that pretty
daughter of yours to bed.
MARIETTA
You fucker, dont you ever touch
Lula -
You fucker, Ill kill you.
SANTOS
(laughing)
Put your shoulders back.
MARIETTA
What?
SANTOS
Put your shoulders back, I said.
Marietta puts her shoulders back and Santos comes and stands in front of
her.
SANTOS
You got nice tits.
MARIETTA
Someones gonna see us.
SANTOS
(smiling as he starts
to feel her breasts)
Thats just another part of the price
to pay.
MARIETTA
Santos...
You kill that Sailor,
otherwise hes gonna turn my baby
against me.
Santos lifts one hand up to Mariettas chin and raises her face up
towards his.
SANTOS
Look at me...
Theres no turning back
on this...
Im gonna kill Sailor...
Thats for sure.
CUT TO:
DELL, wearing a soiled double-knit suit stops a LADY in the street, and
smiling about the fact that earlier that morning hes placed a cockroach
on his anus, he speaks to the woman.
DELL
Howre ya doin?
CUT TO:
Dell walking to house.
CUT TO:
They pass the Biloxi City Limit sign.
LULA
How about that one?
The Host of
the Old South Hotel.
SAILOR
Looks more like the Ghost of the
Old South, but well try her.
CUT TO:
Marcello Santos is making a phone call.
SANTOS
Hello there, Mr. Reindeer...
Marcello Santos speaking.
CUT TO:
SANTOS
I gotta problem...
In fact, I gotta
coupla problems...
CUT TO:
Sailor and Lula are walking along the beach.
Lula takes off her shoes.
LULA
(sing-song spells)
M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i...
You can almost
hear that jazz blowin up from the
big N.O.
SAILOR
Lula...
I learned somethin interestin
today on a science show I heard on the
radio...
How leeches is comin back
into style.
LULA
Say what?
Honestly, sugar, you can
talk more shit sometimes?
She takes out a cigarette the length and width of a Dixon Ticonderoga
No. 2 pencil and lights it.
SAILOR
Got you a pack of Mores again, huh?
LULA
Yeah, its a real problem for me,
Sailor, you know?
When I went in
that drugstore by the restaurant in
Biloxi?
I saw em by the register
and the girl throw em in.
Im
not big on resistin.
So what about
a leech?
SAILOR
Heard on the radio how doctors is
usin leeches again, just in old
times.
You know, when even barbers
used em?
LULA
(shuddering)
I got one on me at Lake Lanier.
Lifeguard poured salt on it and it
dropped off.
Felt awful.
He was a
cute boy, though, so it was almost
worth it.
Sailor laughs.
SAILOR
Yeah, well listen to this...
Radio
said back in the 1920s a I-talian
doctor figured out that if, say, a
fella got his nose cut off or bit
off in, say, a barfight or somethin,
theyd sew one of his forearms to his
nose for a few weeks...
Then put
leeches on it.
CUT TO:
71A. CU of MAN with forearm sewed to nose.
CUT TO:
LULA
Sailor?
You expect me to believe
a mand be goin around with a
arm sewed to his nose?
SAILOR
(nodding)
How they used to do it.
Course they
got more sophisticated ways now.
Radio said the Chinese, I think it
is, figured a better idea is by
insertin a balloon in the forehead
and lettin it hand down on the nose.
Lula shrieks.
LULA
Sailor Ripley!
You stop!
Youre
makin this shit up and I aint
gonna sit for it!
SAILOR
Honest, Lula.
I probly aint
precisely got all the facts straight,
but its about what they said.
LULA
Honey, were goin to bed now and
its time to change the subject.
Shes so cute Sailor just has to kiss her.
DISSOLVE TO:
Sailor goes back to the car.
LULA
That took long enough.
You forget
my Mounds?
Sailor tosses her the candy bar.
SAILOR
I really do think the country done
changed just a little while I was
away, peanut.
Lula sinks her small white teeth into the chocolate-covered coconut.
LULA
(as she chews)
You got to keep an eye on it.
Thats
sure.
Sailor starts pumping gas.
CUT TO:
George is shooting pigeons as fast as he can.
GEORGE
(voice-over)
...My neighbors hired me to get rid
of the pigeons that gathered on
their roofs and porches...
CUT TO:
Lula waits just by the lobby door of the hotel.
In the back of the
lobby in the shadows is an ancient, old BLACK MAN who stares at her.
Sailor pulls the T-Bird up in front of the hotel and Lula hurries out to
him and tosses their suitcase in the backseat.
LULA
Lets get outta here...
I suddenly
got a funny feelin about this
place.
Feelin all that voodoo...
SAILOR
(winks at her)
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
LULA
(smiles)
Who do?
SAILOR
You do.
They laugh and take off around the corner and up past the Cafe Du Monde.
LULA
Oh my God...
Its Johnnie...
Duck
down!...
Get goin!
SAILOR
(looking around frantically)
Where?
LULA
Never mind where...
Get outta here...
I mean it, Sailor.
SAILOR
Im goin.
Sailor pulls the car up fast and hangs a right turn.
CUT TO:
Sailor and Lula drive.
LULA
You think he saw us?
SAILOR
Who knows, baby?
LULA
He was sittin there havin a beignet
at the Cafe Du Monde.
Do you think
he saw us?
SAILOR
Lula, darlin...
Makes no difference
anyway...
Were outta here.
We watch the car disappear up the street.
Slowly the camera pans and
Reggie and Drop Shadow come walking happily along the sidewalk -
whistling.
CUT TO:
Sailor spots a Red Devil gas station that still has its lights on and
pulls the car over.
SAILOR
Someone up here might know somethin.
Two skinny, pimply-faced guys, BUCK and BILLY, wearing dirty coveralls
walk over to them.
BUCK
Gas?
SAILOR
Got enough, thanks.
Were lookin
for a place has some music, where we
can maybe do some dancin - get
somethin to eat, too.
Anything like
that around here?
BILLY
Cornbreads.
They got western.
BUCK
No food, though, cept bar nibbles.
Lula slides over in the front seat and leans across to Sailor.
LULA
How about speed metal?
The kids look worried and take a step back.
LULA
Any kinda rocknroll, honey.
BILLY
Theres a boogie joint just about a
mile straight out Lafitte here.
But
thats a black place mostly.
BUCK
Mostly black though in that boogie
place.
SAILOR
Whats the name of it?
BUCK
Club Zanzibar.
SAILOR
You say its straight ahead a mile?
BUCK
About.
Where Lafitte crosses over
Galvez Highway.
State Road 86.
SAILOR
Thanks.
Sailor and Lula drive off.
Buck and Billy go back inside the Red Devil
station.
Guess who is over the corner cleaning nuts and bolts with a
toothbrush and gasoline ... Its DELL!
CUT TO:
The Club Zanzibar sits in the darkness on the left hand side of the
road.
A string of multi-colored lights is hung over the front.
Sailor
parks the Thunderbird across from the club and cuts the engine.
SAILOR
You ready for this?
LULA
Well find out in a hurry.
CUT TO:
Lula runs out.
Sailor follows.
Sailor finds her sitting on the ground, leaning against the passenger
side of the Thunderbird.
Lulas eyes are red and wet but she isnt
crying.
Sailor kneels down next to her.
SAILOR
I was just wastin time, peanut,
till you come back.
LULA
Its me whos wastin time, Sailor,
bein with you.
SAILOR
Honey, Im sorry.
It wasnt nothin.
Come on and get up and well take
off.
LULA
Leave me be for a minute?
Mama gets
all insane and then I see you
practicin your individuality and
personal freedom with some oil-town
tramp.
How you figure Im gonna feel?
SAILOR
Told you not to call your mama.
Sailor stands and leans against the hood of the car until Lula gets up
and climbs inside.
He wraps his snakeskin jacket around her and starts
the car.
Lula kisses Sailor on the cheek, puts her head down sideways
on his lap and goes to sleep.
Sailor drives.
CUT TO:
Sailor and Lula are in a Shell station just outside of Houston.
Sailor
is filling the Thunderbird with regular.
An OLD MAN sits near the pumps
listening to the radio playing a sad big band tune.
Lula starts to
slowly snap her fingers to the beat and the old man gives her a
beautiful smile.
LULA
(smiling and snapping her
fingers)
How much we got left, honey?
SAILOR
Under a hundred.
LULA
You want to stick around here, Sailor?
See if we can get some work?
SAILOR
Not in Houston.
Wed be better off
in some place more out of the way.
LULA
You want me to drive for a stretch?
Give you a chance to rest.
SAILOR
Thatd be good, Lula.
Sailor kisses her and climbs into the back seat and lays down.
Lula
slides behind the wheel and lights up a More.
She winks goodbye to the
old man and wheels the car out towards the big beyond.
CUT TO:
Light comes from one small dirty window.
CUT TO:
Sailor pulls the car up in front of the Iguana Motel.
SAILOR
Thisll do.
CUT TO:
A tall, skinny man, RED, in his early thirties with wild, uncombed hair
the color of pomegranate, walks out of the garage.
SAILOR
You Red?
RED
(with a smile)
Well, I aint Blackie.
Sailor holds out his right hand to shake.
SAILOR
Names Sailor Ripley.
Katy over at
the drugstore thought you might have
some work I could do.
Red extends his oil-blackened right hand and shakes.
RED
Things aint real hot right now.
Rex, there though,
(nodding toward a half-naked
man burrowed under an 83 Buick)
is about to relocate in about a week
to San Angelo.
I might could use a
man when he does...
You good with
engines?
SAILOR
I aint no Enzo Ferrari, but they
used to call me Wrench when I was a
kid.
RED
Well see how she goes then when
Rex takes off.
Check back.
Two men, SPARKY and BUDDY, both about forty, walk up to Red.
One of
them wears a grey baseball cap with a Confederate flag on it and the
other has an LBJ straw Stetson.
SPARKY
Hows it look?
RED
Reckon the heads cracked, like I
thought.
SPARKY
Shit, thats what I was afraid of.
RED
Ill get you foreigners a beer.
BUDDY
(to Sailor)
Im Buddy, and this heres Sparky.
Sailor introduces himself to Sparky and Buddy and Rex.
They all shake
hands or nod and move out of the sun to drink their beers.
SAILOR
My girl and I are lookin for a
place to settle.
Were bunked down
at the Iguana Motel.
SPARKY
So are we.
Its the only motel in
Big Tuna.
Have you met Bobby Just
Like The Country Peru yet?
SAILOR
No, we just got in a hour and a
half ago.
BUDDY
You will.
Hes the Mr. Fix-It at
the Iguana.
His truck broke down
here a couple of months ago.
REX
Escaped con.
Man got some serious
prison tattoos.
RED
Everbody got a past.
BUDDY
Just some got more future in em
than others.
REX
That aint no lie.
Sailor finishes his beer, stands it on the ground and steps on it,
crushing it flat.
SAILOR
Been nice meetin yall.
Preciate
the beer.
Ill be seein yall
soon.
BUDDY
Very soon.
SPARKY
One thing about bein in Big Tuna:
you dont have much choice about who
you see and who you dont.
CUT TO:
The temperature on the tower reads One Hundred Twelve.
CUT TO:
The darkening evening sky is filled with flying monkeys.
CUT TO:
Sailor pulls the T-Bird up front and hurries up to the screen door.
Flies are buzzing all around.
PERDITA DURANGO comes forward out of the
darkness inside.
PERDITA
(recognizing him)
Oh...
Look at this...
What do you
want, snakeskin?
SAILOR
Just passin through on my way to
who knows where...
PERDITA
Sure...
I figured Id see you
sometime...
SAILOR
Hopin you could tell me if theres
a contract out on me.
I really
need to know.
PERDITA
By who?
SAILOR
I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.
PERDITA
Heard you was goin out with that
bitchs daughter.
SAILOR
You heard right.
PERDITA
You really are one dumb asshole.
SAILOR
Life is unpredictable.
PERDITA
Does that girlfriend of yours know
that her mama and Santos killed her
daddy?
(Sailor doesnt answer -
Perdita smiles)
Does she know her own daddy was one
of the biggest drug dealers around -
till he started snortin the shit
himself?...
(Sailor doesnt answer)
Does she know you was around that
night her daddy was set fire to?
SAILOR
I didnt see nothin...
PERDITA
Yeah...
But I did...
And I told you
all about it...
SAILOR
Is there a contract?...
We made a
deal once that wed tip each
other off if we ever heard.
PERDITA
I know...
I remember.
SAILOR
Well?...
PERDITA
I aint heard of nothin.
SAILOR
Thanks...
Sailor goes back to his car and takes off.
CUT TO:
Sailor is just about finished changing the oil in the Thunderbird when
Bobby Peru pulls up in the maroon Eldo.
BOBBY
Need a hand?
SAILOR
Thanks, Bobby, bout done.
Sailor throws some stuff in the trunk and closes the lid.
BOBBY
How bout a beer?
SAILOR
Thatd be fine, Bobby.
BOBBY
Lets go by Rosaritas.
You been
there yet?
SAILOR
No, havent heard of it.
BOBBY
Thought maybe Sparky and Buddyd
taken ya.
Come on, Ill drive.
Bobby parks the Eldo in among half a dozen pick-up trucks.
BOBBY
Used to be this was a Mobil.
Man
converted it into a private club and
named it after his wife.
She left
him and he shot himself.
The wife
owns it now.
CUT TO:
Bobby looks around in the purple twilight before he opens the trunk of
the Eldorado.
He peels back a brown army blanket.
BOBBY
Thats a double-barreled, sawed-off,
Ithaca shotgun with a carved pistol
grip stock wrapped with adhesive tape.
Next to its a cold Smith and Wesson
.32 handgun with a six inch barrel.
Thesell do er...
Loosen up that
five grand...
Two and a half for you
and the little lady...
Bobby closes the trunk.
Sailor stands - hesitating to commit.
BOBBY
How much money you have between the
two aya right now?...
SAILOR
Forty bucks...
BOBBY
This is easy money, pardner...
No
ones gonna get hurt in this thing...
And I dont think you can afford not
to take it...
Ill be bringin the
Eldo round the front of the motel
at ten tomorrow mornin...
If you
aint a pussy - youll be there.
Sailor stares at him and his fist clenches.
SAILOR
I dont particularly care for that
kind of talk, Bobby.
BOBBY
Hey...
I never said you was a pussy...
Always figured you had the big ol
round balls for this kinda thing...
Sure would set you and that pretty
little girl up good.
SAILOR
Yeah ... yeah...
I guess so...
That kinda moneyd get us a long
way down that yellow brick road...
Bobby cocks his head and squints at him questioningly.
SAILOR
...But DAMN man...
This better go
smooth.
BOBBY
Like takin candy from a fuckin
baby...
CUT TO:
The big Eldorado pulls up in front of the Iguana Motel where Sailor has
been waiting in the hot sun.
Bobby opens the door.
BOBBY
Jump in back.
Sailor crawls in the back seat and sees Perdita just as she floors it
and they take off in a cloud of dust.
Bobby slips the panty hose over his head and adjusts it.
His face looks
crooked and distorted.
BOBBY
(frightening whisper)
Come on!
Get that mask on!
Sailor rips open the package and pulls a nylon leg over his head,
stretching the calf part to fit.
Perdita pulls up in front of the store.
The street is deserted.
BOBBY
Keep it revved, Chiquita.
We wont
be long.
Just goin in to get our
five grand.
CUT TO:
Suddenly, an Iguana County DEPUTY SHERIFF cruises up in a patrol car and
parks it on angle in front of the idling Eldo.
The Deputy gets out of
his car and walks over to the drivers side of the Eldorado.
DEPUTY
Waitin for somebody, Miss?
PERDITA
Mi esposo.
Hes in the feed store
picking up some supplies.
DEPUTY
Youd best be careful of that cigarette,
Maam.
Its about to burn down
between your fingers.
Perdita stubs out her Marlboro in the ashtray.
PERDITA
Gracias, officer.
CUT TO:
Reacting to the shot, Perdita jams the gear shift into reverse and peels
out, knocking the deputy down.
CUT TO:
The deputy recovers and comes up on one knee with his revolver clasped
in both hands.
He fires his first shot into Bobbys thigh and his
second into Bobbys left hip.
The shock of the initial slug causes
Bobby to drop the bag.
The impact of the second forces Bobbys right
hand to twist sideways to that both barrels of the shotgun wedge under
his chin.
The Ithaca goes off, blowing Bobby backwards through the
RAMOS on the plate glass window of the feed store.
Sailor hits the ground - losing the Smith as he falls.
He puts his hand
over his hosieried head and keeps his face in the dirt until the deputy
orders him to stand up.
CUT TO:
Lula pulls the Camaro into in the station parking lot and kills the
engine.
PACE
Why we sittin here, mama?
LULA
Thinkin a second, baby.
Lula gets out and goes around for Pace.
They hold hands as they walk
toward the station.
The big clock on the side of the building shows ten
minutes past six.
PACE
Im scared, mama.
LULA
Why, honey?
PACE
Case daddy dont like me.
What if
he dont like that I dont got
his color hair.
LULA
Pace, your daddyd love you even
if you didnt have no hair at all.
CUT TO:
Sailor walks down the street pretending hard not to care.
CUT TO:
Sailor continues walking down the street.
A GANG OF INSANE KILLER
TEENAGERS on PCP appear and come towards Sailor.
They circle around
him, coming in closer for the kill.
SAILOR
What do you faggots want?
Thats all it takes.
The gang is on him.
Sailor tries to defend
himself, but one big punch to his nose sends him down and out.
Blood
begins to pour from his swelling nose.
CU OF SAILORS FACE - a bright light illuminates it.
In the sky above Sailor, a large glowing bubble holding the beautiful
Good Witch of the North comes floating down above him.
GOOD WITCH
Sailor Ripley...
Sailors eyes suddenly see the Good Witch through his closed eyelids.
His mouth speaks through closed lips.
SAILOR
The Good Witch...
GOOD WITCH
Sailor...
Lula loves you.
SAILOR
But Im a robber and a manslaughterer
and I havent had any parental
guidance.
GOOD WITCH
Shes forgiven you of all these things
...
You love her...
Dont be
afraid, Sailor.
SAILOR
But Im wild at heart.
GOOD WITCH
If you are truly wild at heart, youll
fight for your dreams...
Dont turn
away from love, Sailor...
Dont turn
away from love...
Dont turn away
from love.
The Good Witch disappears.
Sailor opens his eyes and drags himself and his giant swollen nose up on
his feet.
The gang still stands around him.
GANG MEMBER
You had enough, asshole?
SAILOR
Yes, I have...
And I wanna apologize
to you gentlemen for referring to
you as homosexuals.
I also want to
thank you fellas, youve taught me
a valuable lesson in life.
(lifts his head high)
LULA!!!!
Sailor turns around and starts running back.
The gang watches him go.
CUT TO:
Sailor runs up the street, holding his nose and SCREAMING LULAS NAME.
He rounds a corner and spots her in the middle of a sea of cars.
He starts running towards her - leaping from one car to another until he
jumps on the hood of Lulas car.
She sees him.
SAILOR
LULA!!!!
LULA
SAILOR!!!!
Lula wriggles out of the car and flys into his arms.
Behind them is a
giant golden sunset.
As they embrace - the sound of the horns goes
away.
Lulas gaze goes to a reflection of golden light on a windshield.
It is the same abstract scene she saw before in her room in Big Tuna,
but now she knows what it is.
It is Paces happy, smiling eyes looking
up at the two of them in love.
Sailor, with a giant blue nose, looks into Lulas eyes and sings Love
Me Tender.
The people in their cars, and the people on the street look on with a
feeling of love and happiness in their hearts.
THE END
