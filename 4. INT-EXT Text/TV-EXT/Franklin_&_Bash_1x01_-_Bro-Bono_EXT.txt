      Peter stands with JANIE ROSS as she reads the arrest report.  
      The vibe between them is easy, familiar.  No bitterness over 
      her pending nuptuals.  Jared stands nearby playing a game on 
      his iPhone, disengaged.

                                  PETER
                    Danny was at home when his buddy, 
                    Mike Cromwell, called from the 
                    club.  Some guys were messing with 
                    Mike, he needed back-up, so he 
                    called Danny.  

                                  JANIE
                    Because why call the cops?

                                  PETER
                    Danny ends up getting his ass 
                    kicked while Mike hid behind the 
                    bar.  Guess who gets charged with 
                    assault? 

                                  JANIE
                          (big surprise)
                    Your client. 

                                  PETER
                    Exactly.  Look at the report.  
                    Everyone was throwing punches --

                                  JANIE
                    Including your client.  Sitting 
                    this one out, Jared?

                                  JARED
                    No, just the meetings involving 
                    you.

                                  PETER
                    Janie, he s got no record.  And 
                    there s no way to tell who started 
                    the fight--

                                  JANIE
                    I m reading. 

      She reads while biting her lip.  It s sexy.          FRANKLIN & BASH - Production Draft 2ND WHITE - 9/21/10       10.


                                  JANIE (CONT D)
                          (without looking up)
                    And stop looking at me. 

                                  PETER
                    Then stop biting your lip.  You 
                    know that s a strong move. 

                                  JARED
                    Sometime today.

                                  JANIE
                    Okay, talk. 

                                  PETER
                    The club s manager has no interest 
                    in pursuing this case.  

                                  JANIE
                    It s not my case.  It s assigned to 
                    Ellen Morton.  

      Jared GROANS at this news.

                                  PETER
                    She hates us.

                                  JANIE
                    She hates everyone.  I ll make a 
                    note in the file, see if I can t 
                    get Ellen to reduce the charges.

                                  PETER 
                    Thank you. 

      Janie starts to leave, bites her lip -- smiles.

                                  PETER (CONT'D)
                    Now, you re just being cruel.



      Peter, Jared and Danny get out of Peter s car and look up.

      REVERSE ANGLE -- CASA DEL PALMS RETIREMENT LIVING, a fraying-
        at-the-edges retirement community sitting on a golf course. 

                                  DANNY
                    I got in the game just as the 
                    economy tanked.  So I was last 
                    hired, first fired.  I couldn t 
                    keep the condo, so I came here.

                                  JARED
                    Are you going to be able to pay us?

                                  DANNY
                    I was kinda hoping you have a pro-
                    bono policy.  Bro-bono.

      An older woman, MAE, in her early 70 s, stands by a car 
      holding empty recyclable grocery bags.  There s a couple 
      other OLD PEOPLE (one we ll know later as NANETTE, 70).

                                  DANNY
                    I ll be right there, Nana.
                          (to the guys)
                    If I get a DUI, I ll lose my 
                    license, right?

                                  PETER
                    Probably.  For a while.  

                                  DANNY
                    I drive my grandmother and her 
                    friends to the doctor and errands.  
                    I thought it would be a pain in the 
                    ass.  But turns out, they keep me 
                    young.

      Danny smiles, moves off to Grandma.  Peter is starting to 
      feel sorry for this guy -- but not Jared.


      Jared and Hanna walk with Carmen.

                                  HANNA
                    So, Allison was in love with Rick 
                    Paxton, but not Maya.  

                                  JARED
                    This is great for the home team.  

                                  CARMEN
                    Not so fast.  Allison was in love 
                    with Rick Paxton, but Paxton didn t 
                    love her.  In fact, they never had 
                    sex.  Well, they almost did, but 
                    didn t.  She wouldn t say why.

                                  HANNA
                    Wait.  When Maya confronted Rick 
                    about the affair with Allison, he 
                    basically admitted to it.  And now 
                    she says they didn t consummate?  
                    Why is Allison lying?  

                                  JARED
                    Maybe she s not.

                                  CARMEN
                    You think he is?

                                  HANNA
                    Paxton is admitting to an affair so 
                    he can lose eleven million dollars?

                                  JARED
                    He s a guy.  A guy s accused of 
                    cheating, his first instinct is to 
                    lie.  But Paxton s instinct was to 
                    admit it?   

                                  HANNA
                    Maybe he was being honest about 
                    what really happened when they were 
                    together. 
                          (loaded)
                    Instead of lying about it.

      Hanna levels a look at Jared, who can t hold her stare.  The 
      nickel drops for Jared.          FRANKLIN & BASH - Production Draft 2ND WHITE - 9/21/10       31.


                                  JARED
                    He s hiding something.  

                                  CARMEN
                    You getting a blip on the gaydar?  

                                  JARED
                    No, this guy s a notorious 
                      international womanizer.  Hell, he 
                    markets himself that way.  

                                  HANNA
                    Then, what?

                                  JARED
                    What do men lie about?

                                  CARMEN
                    Money.

                                  HANNA
                    Size and girth.

                                  CARMEN
                      Everything.

                                  JARED
                          (to Carmen)
                    Okay, a little angry. 
                          (to Hanna)
                    You re in the right ballpark.  
                    As Rick Paxton can tell you, the 
                    size of the balloon doesn t matter 
                    if you can t get it off the ground.

                                  HANNA
                    Spare us the analogies.  We re big 
                    girls.

                                  JARED
                    He couldn t get an erection.  The 
                    blood did not flow to the penis.

      Hanna and Carmen consider that for a moment.

                                  HANNA 
                    If he s willing to pay off the pre-
                    nup to keep his private business 
                    private, how are we going to get 
                    him to admit it?

      Jared smiles a smile only Carmen would understand.  Jared 
      hurries off.          FRANKLIN & BASH - Production Draft 2ND WHITE - 9/21/10       32.

                    This is why you hire us.


      Says so on the outside of the building.  


      The party plays around them as Jared and Paxton approach the 
      hot tub.  TWO HOTTIES smile.  

                                  JARED
                    Sorry, ladies, I m going to need 
                    the office.   

      They stand, water cascading off their shapely bodies.  Jared 
      and Rick sit near the water.

                                  RICK
                    Is it always like this?  

                                  JARED
                    Sorry, school night.  You should 
                    see it on weekends. 

                                  RICK
                    Talk.

                                  JARED
                    I know why you didn t have sex with 
                    Allison Myers.  

                                  RICK
                    What makes you think that I didn t?

                                  JARED
                    Same thing happened to me a couple 
                    of weeks ago in this very house.  
                    This woman came over, smoking hot--

                                  RICK
                    Hanna Linden?  Your associate?  
                    I ve been stuck in a conference 
                    room with you all for a week.  Hard 
                    not to notice.

                                  JARED
                    It got a little crazy and when it 
                    was go-time... I couldn t storm the 
                    beach.  It was humiliating.  Every 
                    guy s worst nightmare--

                                  JARED
                    One thing for it to happen to me.  
                    Another thing if it ever got out 
                    that you went soft, Stirred 
                      Magazine s Most Virile Man Alive, 
                    that would be bad not only for your 
                      reputation, but for your business.  

                                  RICK
                    I don t know what you re talking 
                    about.

                                  JARED
                    That s why you wanted arbitration 
                    instead of a trial.  You d rather 
                    be guilty of infidelity and sweep 
                    it under the rug than let the world 
                    know that you might be impotent.

      Rick sighs, looks at his brother in flaccidity...

                                  RICK
                          (covering)
                    I think it was environmental.  We 
                    had black mold in the new house.  I 
                    read on-line there s side 
                      effects... 

                                  JARED
                    Yeah, my episode was environmental, 
                    too.  I was all ready, then an Abba 
                    song came on.

      Rick smiles.  

                                  JARED (CONT D)
                    Get her back.
