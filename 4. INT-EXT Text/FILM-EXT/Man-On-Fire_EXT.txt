MEXICO CITY - DAY
High over the city on a bright Sunday morning, the sun
pounding its way through the orange haze of smog. As we
descend toward the clots of traffic blocking the streets:
the sounds of a Mass being sung.
A CATHOLIC CHURCH
The big wooden doors open to release the parishioners
inside. Feature a tall, lanky 18-YEAR-OLD. Holding his
GIRLFRIEND'S hand, anxious for Sunday to really begin.
They don't notice the traffic suddenly thin, like a
faucet's been cranked down. They move toward a Mercedes
500. As a CHAUFFEUR holds the back door open for them...
A GRAND MARQUIS
Squeals around the corner, lurches to a stop alongside
the Mercedes. FOUR MEN get out flashing
badges. In a
moment they're hustling Eighteen toward the car, stiff-
arming the chauffeur. As the girlfriend
cries and the
gossip among the parishioners begins...
The Grand Marquis pulls away.
WOODED AREA - DAY
The Marquis is parked across from another CAR. FOUR NEW
GUYS wait as Eighteen is hauled out of the Marquis. His
clothes drop away like a snake shedding its skin. He
stands naked, bound and blind. Eighteen is handed over
from one group to the other.
UPSCALE HOUSE - DAY
As a hand removes a ziplock baggie from the mailbox. A
glimpse of something we don't want to see. An ear
partially obscured by sweating plastic and a blood smear.
CITY SQUARE - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT
A MERCEDES driving around the square, Eighteen's father
waving a white shirt out the window like a surrender
flag.
BRIDGE - NIGHT (3 AM)
Footbridge over railway sandwiched between freeway.
Empty train blazes through. Dangerous, deserted downtown
neighborhood. Looks more like "war torn Beirut", burnt
out cars and trash. The 18 year old's father, naked to
the waist, walks from the family Mercedes over the
footbridge carrying a pillowcase full of cash to a semi-
derelict car on the opposite side with a white piece of
fabric taped in the rear windshield and trunk open. He
slams the pillow case in the trunk and leaves.
DOWNTOWN MEXICO CITY - TWILIGHT
RUSH HOUR. A red stream of headlights separated from a
white stream of taillights by a narrow median.
Work in Progress 2/10/03

HORNS blare as a CAR stops. Eighteen, still blindfolded,
is dumped on the median. The car pulls away.
He stands there in the whirlwind. Pathetically SCREAMING
for help. More horns, shouts, no help.
END MAIN TITLES.
Goes to black.
CREASY'S VOICE
Ezekiel 25:17 Blessed is he who in the
name of charity and good will shepherds
the weak through the valley of darkness
for he is truly his brother's keeper and
the finder of lost children.
DISSOLVE TO:
CORRIDOR - MEXICO CITY AIRPORT - DAY
As a 747 is towed by in the background, a MAN strides at
us. CREASY. Even in movement, he has a stillness, an
air of isolation. He's set apart from other living
things.
He wears dark sunglasses, carries a well-worn leather
bag. Inscrutable. Disconnected. A bit frightening.
The discipline of a soldier. The independence of a
gunslinger.
Automatic baggage teller (Red Light, Green Light).
Creasy feeds the machine with his perforated customs
card. Light flashes RED.
CUSTOMS MAN
He flips through Creasy's passport. Even the stamps have
stamps. Thailand. Somalia. Cuba. Columbia. Hong
Kong. Saudi Arabia. Every country in Europe. Guy's
been around.
Customs looks up from the ink blue American Eagle to the
deep matte black of Creasy's sunglasses.
NOTE:
Italics denotes the lines spoken in Spanish.
CUSTOMS
Where are you coming from?
CREASY
South America.
CUSTOMS
Where are you staying in Mexico?
CREASY
I'm on to Juarez.
CUSTOMS
Why?
CREASY
I have a friend there.
Customs looks at Creasy a moment. He doesn't look like a
man who has 'friends'. Finally, customs smiles.
Work in Progress 2/10/03

CUSTOMS
I cannot see your eyes, Senor.
Creasy slips off the sunglasses. His eyes are deserted.
Inevitable. Customs can only look into them a moment.
He indicates for Creasy to put his bags on a conveyor
belt leading to an X-ray machine. Creasy lifts his bag
onto the conveyor. The official hits the start button.
The bag drives forward towards the X-ray machine.
Creasy pauses, then offers up a license from his wallet.
CUSTOMS
Senor?
CREASY
It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia.
The gun you're about to find in that
suitcase.
Polaroid FLASH
Shot of Creasy straight on.
Shot of Creasy profile.
FLASH.
Fingers being fingerprinted.
JUMPCUTS - suitcase being stripped and ripped (MIDNIGHT
EXPRESS), pack of Marlboro, bottle of Jack Daniels,
glimpse a weathered Bible (New Testament), intercut with
seven pieces of blue steel separated in different parts
of the bag, ie. toiletries, underwear, lining of
suitcase.
The seven pieces laid together look remarkably like a
well travelled Sig Sauer 226. Creasy smiles.
ACROSS THE BORDER CHECKPOINT - DAY
Four SUV's blast along a desert highway on their way to
pick up some Japanese businessmen. Rayburn rides
shotgun, Creasy in the back. Rayburn looks like he slept
in his clothes. Creasy looks crisp and clean.
RAYBURN
That's right, a bodyguard.
Creasy looks at him blankly.
RAYBURN
Your Spanish is good enough.
You
certainly look the part.
CREASY
You're crazy. People would hire a has-
been, Ray? A drunk?
RAYBURN
Well, you'd have to keep it under
control.
Work in Progress 2/10/03
12.
CREASY
And what if, just say, there was a kidnap
attempt?
RAYBURN
You do your best. They won't be paying
you enough to perform miracles.
Creasy just shakes his head.
RAYBURN
It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at
half speed you're pretty damn good.
CREASY
A bodyguard has to be close to someone
all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not
good at that.
RAYBURN
So you'll be the silent type.
People
will appreciate that.
Creasy shakes his head, looks out the window.
RAYBURN
What are you doing here?
CREASY
I came to visit you.
RAYBURN
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years.
You don't visit.
CREASY
A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
RAYBURN
Samuel Ramos.
Owns one of the plants in
Juarez. The
Jap car industry is in the
toilet. He's
trying to persuade Ford to
partner with
him. I think he's in
trouble. He
asked me if I knew anyone he
could trust.
CREASY
Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
RAYBURN
Take a job, Creasy. Breathe some air.
Then decide if you want to... stick
around or not.
Work in Progress 2/10/03

Rayburn throws him a VHS from the glove box.
RAYBURN
Instructional tape on what I tell my
clients about bodyguarding.
Creasy looks back at Rayburn who's just a little too
perceptive for comfort.
MERCEDES - MEXICO CITY SUBURBS - DAY
A dark Mercedes maneuvers the turns.
Pinta leads the way. All enthusiasm, away from her
parents. A 150 pound black German Shepherd greets them.
Sniffs Creasy's pant leg, unsure.
PINTA
Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
CREASY
If they like me.
PINTA
Frank doesn't take to most people.
Do
you speak German?
CREASY
(in German)
Ein Klines Bisschen.
[A tiny bit.]
PINTA
Frank only responds to commands in
German. He was trained in Frankfurt.
My Dad loves the idea of having a dog
around, but hates the fact he lives
inside.
Creasy follows her.
Frank pads along after them.
CREASY'S ROOM
Not like downstairs, but comfortable enough.
PINTA
We fixed the room up two weeks ago.
Mom
and I. It's nicer than before.
Creasy takes a stroll around it, ignoring her.
PINTA
You've got a CD player if you like music.
I like music a lot.
Work in Progress 2/10/03

CAW! Creasy looks over at a CAGE on a stand holding a
MACAW. It tilts its head at the big man.
A TV and VHS machine in the corner.
PINTA
That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him
with when he left.
CREASY
Who's Emilio?
PINTA
My last bodyguard. He drove me to school
in the morning and picked me up in the
afternoon.
Finally Creasy turns, looks at her hard.
CREASY
I'm here for you?
Pinta smiles huge, nods.
PINTA
In between you can take Mom shopping and
to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr.
Creasy?
CREASY
Creasy.
Just call me Creasy.
PINTA
(big grin)
Creasy...
Frank's tail wags imperceptibly.
PINTA
Looks like he approves of you.
And then, walking on air, she's out the door.
Creasy sets up his room with meticulous precision that
comes from years in the military. Front and center he
arranges his shrine: an almost empty bottle of scotch and
a glass (engraved from an earlier encounter) next to a
pack of Marlboros and his weathered Zippo. Then, his
beaten up gun and holster. A well-travelled New
Testament is placed in the drawer.
CREASY'S BAG
Work in Progress 2/10/03

He reaches in between the shirts, pulls out a fresh
bottle of scotch. He breaks the seal, unscrews the cap.
He pours a double... triple... wait, what do you call a
full glass of scotch?
CAW!
The macaw squawks it's disapproval.
He ejects the shell from the breach of the 9mm, tries to
catch it on the back of his hand. An old game with
himself.
His hand is too shaky. The bullet bounces off, hits the
floor. Creasy picks it up. Ejecting the magazine, he
starts to oil the weapon.
CAW! As the macaw squawks, Creasy looks up. It doesn't
feel like this relationship is going to work.
CONVENT SCHOOL GATES - MEXICO CITY - DAY
Creasy pulls the Mercedes up out front.
He notes the
high walls, the heavy gates.
PINTA
Beep the horn.
Creasy hits it. A beat and then a
shutter opens at eye
level. Pinta waves from the car.
A moment later the
gate is being slowly pushed open by
an old WATCHMAN.
Creasy drives in toward a rambling,
ivy-clad building set
in spacious grounds.
COURTYARD
Creasy parks, get out of the car.
He looks around,
appraising the lay of the land.
PINTA
Isn't it beautiful?
Pinta's name is called. An elderly gray-haired NUN walks
over from the entrance. Pinta runs over, kiss her
warmly on both cheeks, then leads her toward Creasy.
PINTA
Sister Anna, the headmistress.
(to nun; proudly)
This is Creasy, my bodyguard.
Sister Anna shakes his hand.
SISTER ANNA
Mr. Creasy.
PINTA
No, Sister, he told me just to call him
Creasy. He's American. From no state in
particular.
SISTER ANNA
You must look after our Pinta. We're so
happy to have her back in school. Run
along now, Pinta.
Pinta waves goodbye, bounds away.
They watch her go.

SISTER ANNA
She's late, Mr. Creasy.
CREASY
Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes.
I -- It won't happen again.
SISTER ANNA
No offense, but I'm sorry that your
profession needs to exist.
CREASY
So am I, Sister.
SISTER ANNA
Do you ever see the hand of God in what
you do?
CREASY
Not for a long time, sister.
SISTER ANNA
The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil,
but overcome evil with good."
CREASY
Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.
Sister Anna is impressed.
She nods her 'props' to
Creasy.
CREASY
I'm the sheep that got lost.
HIGH STREET - MEXICO CITY - DAY
Creasy striding, the frivolous shoppers like another
species as he moves through them. Might as well wear a
shark fin. He spots something: a MUSIC STORE.

COURTYARD - PINTA'S SCHOOL - DAY
Creasy waits, smoking a Marlboro light, separate from the
other drivers and bodyguards. The bodyguards stand
together sharing cigarettes and stories. Give him a
share of unfriendly looks. Creasy could care less.
The doors open and the children pour out. PINTA exits, a
huge grin as she spots Creasy. Creasy palms the
Marlboro. The frown on his might as well be chiseled in
marble.
RAMOS HOUSE - NIGHT
Creasy stands at the edge of the drive, the house dark
behind him. On his cell phone.

CREASY
I said, have you ever had a nine
millimeter round that just didn't go off?
INTERCUT THE FOLLOWING:
Rayburn pulling away, sitting on the edge of the bed.
RAYBURN
You mean a misfire?
CREASY
I mean nothing. The hammer came down and
nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
RAYBURN
I've heard of it. Never happened to me
though. Maybe the firing pin's off.
CREASY
Maybe...
Creasy is troubled about it all to say the least.
RAYBURN
It's like we always used to say: a bullet
always tells the truth. What were you
shooting at?
Creasy doesn't answer.
He holds the bullet up, looks at
it.
RAYBURN
(focusing; concerned)
Creasy?
CREASY
Sorry I woke you, Ray.
Creasy clicks off the phone. He starts back toward the
house, but stops short again.
There she is. Pinta. Standing in the window of her
room. She's been watching him. It's like Creasy seeing
her for the first time. And she's been watching him
forever. No easy answer for it. They're connected
somehow.
STREET - MEXICO CITY - DAY
As the mercedes crosses an intersection, a white TOYOTA
COROLLA turns right, pulls in thirty meters behind it.
COURTYARD - CONVENT SCHOOL - DAY
They pull in through the gates. The Mercedes parks;
Creasy gets out. Pinta kisses her mother on the cheek.
PINTA
Bye, Mom.
LISA
Don't forget your towel.
Pinta gets out with book bag and her
towel. As she
starts to walk past Creasy without a
word, he holds out
her pencil. She holds up, shows him
a SECOND PENCIL,
continues on her way. Doesn't need
him.
MERCEDES
Creasy gets back in, starts away.
LISA
She has swimming practice today.
You'll
need to pick her up at the pool.
Creasy just nods. He doesn't want anything to do with
Lisa either. Thoughtful, Lisa looks out the window.
LISA
I talked to her. She understands.
She
won't bother you anymore.
As Creasy just drives.
AGO'S - MEXICO CITY - DAY
Creasy waits in the street, stands by the Mercedes. He
checks his watch, looks around. The minutes do not pass
quickly. He looks over as the restaurant door opens and
Lisa exits with Jordan Kalfus and his Latin wife EVELYN.
LISA
(sees him)
Creasy!
(stepping over)
Meet Jordan and Evelyn.
Creasy nods.
They study him with interest.
JORDAN
So you're the bodyguard?
(Creasy nods again)
You used to be, what did they used to
call it, a soldier of fortune?

Jordan doesn't quite hide his disdain. Creasy nods a
final time, lets his eyes drift to a 1000 yard stare.
EVELYN
(giggles)
Does he talk?
As Lisa gives her a dirty look, Evelyn whispers...
EVELYN
He's sexy...
Jordan looks in the direction Creasy looks.
JORDAN
You see any danger out there?
(laughs)
The fear's worse than the reality.
Just a blankness from Creasy.
JORDAN
I always wanted to ask a bodyguard, would
you take a bullet for your employer, for
Samuel?
A condescending smile as Jordan awaits his answer.
CREASY
I wasn't hired to guard Mr. Ramos.
JORDAN
For Pinta then?
LISA
Jordan!
CREASY
If something happened, my reaction would
be to fight to protect her. I have
skills in that respect. Pinta would
benefit by the fact that... I'm a
soldier.
JORDAN
What kind of an answer is that?
CREASY
The answer is the truth.
The question is
foolish.
Lisa smiles at the answer, kisses Jordan on the cheek.
Work in Progress 2/10/03

LISA
Jordan, thank you for the lovely lunch.
I promise not to let Evelyn spend too
much.
Evelyn doesn't see it, but Creasy does. Jordan just lets
his fingers trace the top of Lisa's ass.
As she and Evelyn head for the car, Creasy is there to
open the door.
MERCEDES
Creasy gets behind the wheel. Pulls into traffic. As he
goes, he checks the rear view mirror. Jordan remains
standing on the curb watching the car pull away.
Something odd about it all.
PUBLIC POOL - MEXICO CITY - DAY
Loud. Chaotic. Reminiscent
of a lunatic asylum. Creasy
arrives at the public pool.
A practice. Several
bodyguards gather at one end
of the pool. Give Creasy a
less than friendly look. As
he looks for Pinta...
A GUN goes off.
Sees: The smoke from the starting pistol as the SWIMMERS
splash into the water.
He sees Pinta in the pool. The fifty yard dash. She's
in fifth. Then fourth. Creasy walks along beside her.
Third. Second and closing. And at the wall, still
second.
She surfaces, frustrated.
As she sees Creasy there...
RAMOS VILLA - DAY
A DRIVER gets Samuel's and Lisa's luggage into a car.
They're on their way, kissing Pinta goodbye.
LISA
I'll call you from Detroit, baby.
PINTA
You're going to miss Mexican Halloween.
The Day of the Dead.
SAMUEL
You enjoy it for us, Pinta.
Lisa gives her a look. Don't make this harder than it has
to be. Finally, Pinta nods.
Creasy waits quite a discreet distance away by the
Mercedes. She steps over, stops to wave goodbye one last
time, then gets in back. As Creasy shuts the door.
WINDOW - RAMOS VILLA - DAY
Pinta the devil stares sadly out here window. Then there
it is! The macaw. Sitting on the opposite roof.
ATTIC WINDOW - RAMOS VILLA - DAY
Pinta pushes it open, climbs out onto the slope of the
roof. This doesn't look like such a good idea. As she
crosses, disappears over the peak.
It's a game of catch me if you can. 'Bird' looks at
Pinta right in the eye. She gingerly moves closer. The
bird moves away, just out of her reach each time.
CHIMNEY
Pinta coming down the other slope.
There's the macaw.
PINTA
Come on.
Come on.
Bird!
The fourth time Pinta's fingers are centimeters away.
She reaches and suddenly slides along the slick tile
covering this section of the roof. Frank's in the yard
barking loudly.
Near the edge, she manages to stop.
Whew!
She scrambles up a few feet. A tile snaps off. She
slides again. This time right off the edge.

She catches the rain gutter. Hangs thirty feet above the
ground. A concrete landing below. As the gutter creaks:

Creasy dashes around just as the gutter drops on one
side. Pinta drops ten feet, jerks to a stop as the
gutter stops, then drops the last twenty feet...
...landing in a hedge.
Creasy dashes over.
CREASY
Pinta!
She's in a lot of pain, but moving her arms and head.
Frank's licking her face.
PINTA
It hurts.
CREASY
Where?
PINTA

She puts her hands to the left side of her ribs.
Creasy
carefully probes with his fingers. She winces.
CREASY
I don't think they're broken.
Anywhere
else?
PINTA
My ankle.
As Maria huffs and puffs her way up.
CREASY
I'm going to get you out, okay?
Pinta nods. Creasy eases his arms under, around her,
lifts her out as gently as possible. She disappears in
his arms.

PINTA
Oh, Creasy...
And she bursts into tears. Maria looks up at the thirty
foot fall. Begins to cross herself.
CREASY

She's just scared.
Creasy cradles her, pats her back.
As Pinta says his
name like a mantra...
MERCEDES - RAMOS HOUSE - DAY
Pedro the 'car wash guy' puts the finishing touches to
the Mercedes.
Using crutches, Pinta hobbles over. Creasy opens the
back door for her. But when she gets there, she
hesitates.
PINTA
I think I'll sit in the front.
There's
more room for my foot.
Creasy makes no big deal of it. He takes her crutches,
opens the front. As she scoots inside... Frank waits
and watches. Creasy calls to him.

HAIRDRESSERS - ZONA ROSA - DAY
Mexico City traffic is heavy. Cars and people. Creasy
stands by the car across the street. Cooling his heels.
He can just catch a glimpse of Lisa in the shop.
Suddenly the traffic seems to finish, expending itself.
The street goes ominously quiet. Creasy's antennae go
up.
A police car comes prowling down the empty street.
Creasy makes eye contact with the guys up front.
Then, Creasy spots a BUSINESSMAN coming out of a doorway
with a BODYGUARD attached. The bodyguard is speaking
into a two-way radio.

Creasy's sixth sense tweaks as a Mercedes 500 pulls up to
collect the businessman.
And the cop car disappears around the corner even as TWO
MEN start toward the businessman.
Lisa exits the hairdresser's.
Looks stunning.
Creasy starts across the street toward her.
A second car squeals around the corner behind the
Mercedes and everything goes to Hell.
GUNFIRE erupts.
And then Creasy is there.
His arm around Lisa's waist, sweeping her off her feet.
The next thing she knows she flattened on the ground in a
shop doorway, Creasy on top of her. Shielding her.
The bodyguard beside the businessman is killed. The body
guard in the Mercedes trades a full magazine before he's
shot.
A PEDESTRIAN is killed.
Liza screams as the glass above and behind them shatters.
The businessman is hustled into the back of the second
car.
Lisa sees the gun in Creasy's hands.
She hears the slamming of the car door, the screeching of
tires. A parked VAN also hauling ass out of there. But
then she's aware of something else.
Creasy on top of her.
She feels his weight, his heat...
CREASY
Don't move.
She watches as he rises, goes to the curb. One bodyguard
is sprawled dead across the ground. Red blood on the
sidewalk. As Lisa closes her eyes.
HIGHWAY UNDERPASS - MEXICO CITY - DAY
The Mercedes parked. Creasy and Lisa up against it.
Fucking. No cultured way to put it. Like animals. A
primal release for both of them.

CREASY
I dropped her at home.
PINTA
It's no wonder you're late.
Why didn't

Creasy doesn't answer, just grunts. Pinta keeps looking
at him and it suddenly all makes sense.
He looks over at her, starts to say something, then
thinks better of it. Finally...
PINTA
Do you think my mother likes you?
She's for sure pissed. Definitely aware and definitely
jealous. Creasy's a bit amazed, not sure how to respond.
CREASY
I think she's afraid of me.
But not the
same way most people are.
Pinta considers this.
Then..
PINTA
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
CREASY
I know you're not.
PINTA
Are you afraid of me?
Creasy looks at her, almost like he's deciding.
CREASY

But not

Her smile is huge.

BLOCKS together with a WHACK!

Pinta flinches at the sound. She opens her eyes, shrugs
an apology at him. Creasy frowns, shakes his head.
Pinta closes her eyes again. He starts walking around
her. Frank oversees the whole program.
CREASY
The gunshot holds no fear.
Say it.
PINTA
The gunshot holds no fear.
CREASY
You welcome the sound. The sound is what
lets you go. The sound is what frees
you. You are a prisoner in those blocks

Eyes closed, she's drifted off with his voice. And
Creasy WHACKS them together right in front of her face.
Pinta smiles at the sound.
Creasy smiles at the sight.

Pinta raises her arms overhead, makes like Rocky across

As the Mercedes pulls in, another car is ahead of it.
Samuel is home, a DRIVER pulls his LUGGAGE from the
trunk.
Pinta gets out of the Mercedes.
PINTA
Hi, Dad.
He gives her a pat on the head. Simultaneously, Samuel
fixes Creasy with a look, strides purposefully over. He
thrusts out his hand, shakes Creasy's.
SAMUEL
I want to thank you, Creasy.
For what
you did for my wife.
Creasy wants to choke, but he just nods, looks past
Samuel to Pinta who looks bemused. He doesn't even want
to know exactly what she knows.
The Car Wash Guy, - Pedro, ingratiates himself with
Samuel.
PARKING LOT - MUNICIPAL POOL - DAY
The big swim meet. Race day. A lot of security, men
speaking into their wrists. For a public gathering the
mood almost seems ominous. Creasy and Pinta exit the
Mercedes. Pinta watches wistfully as her fellow STUDENTS
stream toward the water with their PARENTS.
PINTA
What's so important in Los Angeles?
CREASY
Your father has business.
PINTA
Why today?
And why'd she have to go with
him?
Creasy shrugs. No comforting answer for her.
He looks

Good luck. I'll be waiting here when

But she's shaking her head adamantly.
Determined.

Pinta's parents are in Los Angeles.

Eyes closed serenely, Pinta surges forward, leaving

knows she's won.
PINTA
SPLASH! Ten meters in before she breaks the surface.
Her head sweeping left and then right.

Wherever her competitors are, it's somewhere behind her.
And the future, everything ahead, is wide open.

Pinta somersaults, kicks off and is gone.
SURFACE
And the finish line seems to come to her.
THE CROWD
Cheers enthusiastically as she reaches the finish wall.
CREASY
Watches her, satisfied with what he's done.
Pinta hauls herself out of the water and runs.
A beeline for Creasy. And the poor fucker doesn't even
understand, until she's leaping the last few feet...
Into his arms.
PINTA
I won, Creasy! I won!
She loves him...
Creasy hugs her.
He loves her back.
The sounds of Samuel's baby grand resonates throughout
the villa. An impassioned rendering of a Mozart
symphony.
Pinta is looking for Frank. Today is Saturday and on
weekends Frank is allowed to travel with them. And today
she is claiming all her rights.
PINTA
Frank.
Frankie.
Pinta whistles.
CREASY
Pinta, we've got to go.
Travel sucks at

VIA BUENOS AIRES - MEXICO CITY - DAY
A wide avenue. The Mercedes pulls up parks in the only
open spot. Creasy and Pinta get out. We walks her
across the street, along the lawn to the apartment
building. They look up at the sound of piano keys
tinkling above. Then:
Creasy looks at her, smiles to himself.
Pinta looks
back.
CREASY
Continue to play in the wrong key, like
you're dyslexic.
Work in Progress 2/10/03

PINTA
Dyslexic?
CREASY
Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has
a complete block about 'C' Minor. But
remember, "Whoever resists authority will
bring judgement upon themselves." New
Testament, Romans 13.
PINTA
You got that right.
CREASY
You'll be back in the water in twenty-
four hours.
Creasy presses the buzzer. As they wait, Pinta sees
something, reaches down to pull a DANDELION from a crack
where the sidewalk meets the wall. She smiles at Creasy.
PINTA
For you, Creasy.
Creasy takes it from her. He's saved by the bell as a
second buzzer answers the first. Creasy pulls the door
open. Pinta heaves a resigned sigh.
CREASY
Remember 'dyslexic.'
As Pinta nods, disappears inside...
DISSOLVE TO:
2ND FLOOR WINDOW
The curtains rustle in the breeze. The sound of badly
played scales. And then sounds of frustration.
Then, the sound of the teacher playing.
Pinta appears in
the window for just a moment.
CREASY
Looking up from the window of the Mercedes. As Pinta is
called back inside, Creasy checks out, twirls the
dandelion Pinta gave him. HUMS to himself. "Blue
Bayou."

THE STREET
Creasy leaning against the Mercedes. Traffic pounding
by. The dandelion is stuck in a button hole of his
shirt.
And then suddenly traffic thins out. Reminiscent of the
previous two kidnappings. It's a process. Creasy
straightens up.
A Judicial POLICE CAR cruises by, slowly. Creasy makes
eye contact with the two cops up front. The same guys
who were at Zona Rosa.
Creasy starts across the street toward the apartment
building. At the same time as...
The door bangs open. Pinta exiting. She spots Creasy, a
huge grin on her face. She was not accepted.
And a white TOYOTA COROLLA coming the other way.
The police car reverses back, cutting Creasy off from
Pinta. The COPS getting out, big smiles on their faces.
THE COROLLA
Slides to a stop in front of Pinta, blocking her path to
Creasy. And as TWO MEN leap out from the backseat...
CREASY
(drawing his 9mm)
Run, Pinta, run!
But she's rooted with fear.
And the men are almost on her.
Creasy raises the 9mm overhead.
BANG!
And the sound frees her.
Pinta runs!
Ducking under a flailing arm.
Quick and lithe.
Trying
to reach her bodyguard.
The cops drawing Uzi's..
Creasy plants himself, the Sig Sauer now level.
He fires
twice into COP ONE, dead center in the chest.
Pinta runs.
Chased by the TWO MEN.
COP TWO returns fire wildly: the Mercedes hit in a ten
bullet line.
Work in Progress 2/10/03

Creasy fires two more rounds into COP TWO who's hit high
in the chest and throat. Precise.
Creasy pivots, strides calmly forward, firing at the men
chasing Pinta. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
MAN ONE goes down, hit in the ribs.
A bullet slams Creasy in the back, fired from inside the
Corolla.
Creasy fires back.
BOOM!
BOOM!
MAN THREE falls dead, hit just below his nose, just above
his teeth. The FAT DRIVER fires, now, and Creasy is hit
in the shoulder.
And Pinta disappears into the traffic.
Gone.
MAN TWO, who has abandoned chasing Pinta, fires again.
Creasy drops the 9mm as he is hit in the stomach.
He
falls to his knees.
The dandelion starts to come apart.
Drifting away, piece
by piece.
Slack-jawed, Creasy looks about. Sees the FAT DRIVER
heaving himself out of the Corolla while MAN TWO scans
for Pinta who's nowhere in sight.
She got away!
Creasy smiles even as he crumples over on
his side.
PINTA'S VOICE
CREASY!
And Pinta is back. Running toward Creasy. She can't
leave him like this. She was safe and now she's back.
CREASY
NOOO...
She runs to him, wraps her arms around him.
PINTA
Creasy...
MAN TWO catches up, tears Pinta away, starts back for the
sedan. Creasy can only blink after them.

It's not a cry for help.
It's anguish for him.
CREASY

MAN TWO crams her in the back seat, follows. The fat
driver gets back in behind the wheel. As the door slams
shut, wheels spin, grip and the Corolla accelerates away.
We just see Pinta look back through the rear windshield.
An anguished image before she's pulled back down.
Creasy makes a wish.
Not for himself, but for her.

Scene of the crime. Typical Mexican 'roadside shrines'

sidewalk alongside. A car pulls up...
Rosanna Guerrero gets out with a REPORTER and
PHOTOGRAPHER. She directs them in Spanish. The reporter
starts making notes; the photographer snaps photos of the
shrine.
Rosanna stands by the flower pyre. Something catches her
eye. A balled-up piece of paper and a half-burned candle
beside it. As she picks it up, she spots something else.
Across the street, Creasy walks. An awkward hitch in his
stride. Outside the apartment of the piano teacher,
surveying the scene with experienced eyes. Unaware of

Creasy doesn't answer.
ROSANNA
I can help. I have a situation Mr.

ranking Government officials, corrupt
police, and organized crime at a level
that is very difficult for me to touch.
I believe you were a victim of this
organization. You and this story may
help to unmask them.

Right now he trusts

Thank you.
He walks away towards Rayburn.

TAZINARI
Two and a half. That's how much there
was.
CREASY
Don't lie to me!
TAZINARI
Two and a half! The rest was paper!
Strips of paper!
FLASHBACK:
Tazinari, in his office, sifting through the
paper.
CREASY
Maybe your men stole from you.
TAZINARI
No. Whoever took the rest took it before
the exchange.
CREASY
Who gave the bags to Ramos?
TAZINARI
His lawyer.
Jordan Kalfus.
FLASHBACK: Ramos House. Bags of cash being switched
from the Mercedes with the flat tire to the 2nd Mercedes
in the garage. See that Jordan does the switch, four
bags on the floor.
CUT TO:
As Creasy thinks.
Tazinari has been stretched to his
limit.
TAZINARI
That's all I know! Please. I'm sorry
for the girl. But it was business! I'm
a professional.
CREASY
That's what everybody keeps saying.
Creasy switches off the tape recorder and pockets it.
Relief for Tazinari as the .44 Is withdrawn. Creasy
walks around the car Tazinari now looking like a naked
hood ornament. Butt first.

Average speed 80 m.p.h. This is Mexico. Creasy slips
the clutch, jumps out, and the Coup deVille kangaroos
forward down the ramp. Gathering momentum into the
oncoming traffic. Tazinari screams right on impact.
Creasy doing laps. He swims the last few meters
underwater. As he surfaces, Pinta waits by the edge.
She nods in grim satisfaction.

He isn't doing well. The cloud of deep red emanating
from his stomach envelopes his whole body.
MEXICO CITY - NIGHT
Life moves on with its brutal inevitability.
This is a
river whose course cannot be altered.
PINTA'S VOICE
From the backseat I can see
Creasy's eyes
in the mirror. He watches
and thinks.
He never smiles. I wish I
was back in
the front seat with him. I
wish he would
smile.
Creasy looks up from the notebook and out at the city.
And a smile comes. But it's bitter and hopeless.
It's half grief, half not knowing where to go next, what
to do. And he's dying. He knows that too. Creasy dials
a number on a cell phone.
CREASY
Hola...
ROSANNA'S VOICE
Creasy.
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON ROSANNA
Inside somewhere.
ROSANNA
I traced the PIN. I have an address for
you. But I need to see you.
CREASY
I show, you give me the information?
ROSANNA
Deal.
CREASY
Where?

Her car draws up. Her driver exits and opens her door.
She steps out. But waiting inside is a welcoming
committee. A HOODED FIGURE wielding a shotgun who shoots
the driver in both knees.

HOODED FIGURE waves the shotgun under Rosanna's nose. A
warning. Then disappears into the darkness.

RESTAURANT - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT
Creasy moves in the shadows looking remarkably strong
considering his wounds.
CREASY - SURVEILLANCE POV
Cameras whirring. Video being shot.
He hasn't arrived
alone. As he disappears inside...

REFORMA.
ROCK WALL HOUSE - MEXICO CITY - DAY
A tiered house built into the rock face that runs through
Mexico City. A scooter is parked. A man sits on it
waiting, wearing a crash helmet to hide his now well
known features. Creasy.
CREASY - VIDEO FEED
It's difficult to say where they are coming from. The
view passes from one screen to another. As Creasy's
passes, we hear the whispered crackle of radio
communications.
GROUND LEVEL
CREASY sits up as a car pulls up, and a MAN gets out.
Creasy checks the digital "8x10" even though this face is
indelibly imprinted on his brain.
It's not "The Dreamer."
Not as handsome, but there's a
resemblance.
The MAN unlocks the front door, checks the street first
and then enters.
Creasy regroups mentally and physically. Checks the
magazine in his SIG SAUER. Chambers rounds into his
shotgun. Looks up and sees a six-year-old on a bicycle
approach the front door. A ten-year-old opens the door
from inside. The six-year-old struggles to get his
bicycle through the doorway.
Creasy moves. He holds the shotgun against his leg as he
strides across the street. "Man on Fire."
The bicycle makes it in.
And the door is closing...
Creasy gets a foot in, forces his way inside.

MANZANO'S OFFICE - AFI HQ
Manzano listens to a radio over a desk speaker.
VOICE
He's inside.
What should we do?
MANZANO
(keys mic)
Do nothing.
Creasy steps into courtyard, turns, a VW Bug coming right
at him...
Aims his weapon.
THE MAN
Ducks down... windshield shatters from the blast of
Creasy's shotgun... Bug slams into wall. The Man rolls
out... using the door as a shield.
BARRIO
The Man
flees into a labyrinth of packing-crate houses on
car-tire
foundations out into street. Running hard, too
hard for
Creasy in his condition. He is losing a lot of
blood.
He stops.
CREASY
Behind the wheel of the Volkswagon, roars out chasing.
Work in Progress 2/10/03

Now through the maze of poverty... Creasy drives hard...
no sign of the Man... empty eyes of poverty looking
back... mostly women and children... They clearly see
Creasy... fully exposed... driving a car with no
windshield... He slams the car into reverse.
Someone says "Creasy" aloud... now more faces to turn...
children looking directly through his absent windshield.
One skinny kid runs ahead of Creasy. The boy points at
one cardboard house propped up against a brick and stucco
wall.
Darkness has fallen. Few people are on the street as
Creasy pulls to the south end of the bridge. He parks...
looks around... it's deserted. She's not coming. Checks
his watch, turns and walks toward the bridge. The Ramos
Mercedes drives up the bridge. Headlights off. Lisa is
driving. She exits the car.
She runs to catch Creasy.
LISA
Creasy... Wait.
CREASY
Stay here. If you do something stupid,
we won't get her back.
He climbs the steps of the bridge trying to maintain his
dignity through the pain. He can see cars parked on the
other side.
OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE - Creasy's POV
Creasy's dreamlike POV (Is it real or a dream) A
driver exits a shadowed car and opens the passenger door.
A SMALL FIGURE in a hooded sweat shirt and sweat pants
exits the car. Confused. Disoriented.
CREST OF THE BRIDGE
Work in Progress 2/10/03
124.
Creasy waits. Breathing labored breaths. He sees it all.
OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE
The driver unties little hands. Removes a blindfold from
under the hood. He steps away. Offering no help.
The small figure is confused.
CREST OF THE BRIDGE
Creasy calls out:
CREASY
Pinta.
Pinta.
She turns and looks. It looks remarkably like her even
under the hooded sweatshirt. She begins to run. Across
the street, up the steps toward Creasy. A screaming
train flashes beneath. Car headlights illuminate the
bridge.
Time stands still and the 'city sounds' fade out to
nothing.
She runs up the remaining stairs and sprints across the
bridge. Her hood blows off revealing her full face.
It's definitely Pinta. Camera ramps as he jumps into
Creasy's arms. This is not the little girl we
experienced in the beginning of the movie. The
experience she just endured has been life changing. All
of a sudden we have a 40 year old head on an 8 year old
body.
She wraps herself around him. He picks her up.
We
glimpse a simple tear on his cheek. They talk.
But we
do not hear the words.
She notices her mom on the far side of the bridge.
Creasy maneuvers her toward Lisa.
Before she goes to her mother we hear:
PINTA
I love you, Creasy... And you love me,
right?
Creasy nods.
The inference is that he will see her in a
few minutes.
We start to hear Linda Ronstadt painfully, quietly on the
wind singing "Blue Bayou." He continues to walk across
to the opposite side of the bridge and gets into the
kidnappers' car.
Work in Progress 2/10/03
125.
There's a certain sort of calm of him.
He closes the door, he lays his head against the back
window. He looks out at PINTA at the other side of the
bridge, where she's screams for Creasy. "Blue Bayou"
gets LOUDER. Pinta now knows it was a lie. Creasy is
not coming back. We're shooting through the glass of the
back window. We se Mexico City reflected in the glass.
As the car pulls out, time slows, and we see Creasy lay
his head back and close his eyes as the car descends down
into a dark tunnel.
Pinta can see Creasy's face, eyes slowly closing. He can
hear her screams before being enveloped by the night. As
"Blue Bayou" continues...
MEXICO CITY STREETS - DAY
Dark spot in the road. Suddenly Police lights, on the
roofs of four cars, flash simultaneously in front, in
blocking position. The driver turns and looks back
wanting to escape. He has a blacked out AFI armored van
right on his rear bumper. Nowhere to go.
SWAT at his door.
He's pulled and proned out onto the
road.
Manzano enters the driver's seat.
Reaching back to
Creasy. Grabs his hand.
MANZANO
I'm your chauffeur now, Creasy.
Manzano does a U-turn.
Heading away.
On his portable
radio.
MANZANO
All units. Commence the operation.
Repeat. Commence.
He reaches back again.
MANZANO
Creasy?
Creasy?
CLOSE UP - Two hands clasp.
Creasy's left with Manzano's right. A strong grip.
Then
no response. Manzano pulls to the curb.
Manzano reaches Creasy's wrist.
Takes his pulse.
Creasy's gone.
Beat.
Work in Progress 2/10/03

Manzano kneels.
Still holding Creasy.
Unfolds Creasy's
fingers.
CLOSE UP - Pinta's medallion of St. Jude clutched in his
hand.
Manzano punches the seat again again and again.
MANZANO
Goddamn you.
Manzano looks at Creasy and makes a decision.
MANZANO
(keys mic)
Hold at the perimeter.
Until I enter.
Dark, suburban Cuernavaca street. Creasy's car rounds
the corner. Security outside the compound motions to
open the garage doors. The driver of the car is
faceless. Street light reflections across the
windshield.
The car enters the gates. A collection of armed bodies
appear in the courtyard curious to see this national
hero. "Hombre en Fuego."
The car stops. Nothing. This beat seems interminable.
A hand opens the rear door: His forehead explodes. The
driver door opens barely two shots, two more bodies drop.
Panic and confusion. Everybody runs for cover. An
overhead helicopter illuminates the mayhem in the
courtyard. An armored vehicle rams through the gates.
Manzano explodes out of the driver's door in slow motion.
He is clearly on a mission. He strides through the
mayhem, Creasy's Sig Sauer in one hand, and a .45 auto in
the other.
Manzano's guide to his destination is the 'The Dreamer's'
little Jack Russell running back to his master on
instinct.
Manzano moves purposefully. His surrounding environment
is Chaplinesque in its chaos. He enters a long walkway
to a patio, following the dog. Daniel Sanchez appears at
the end of the hall. We ramp him into slow motion. The
Mexican version of Gotti. He raises his arms, prepared
for the inevitable. The outcome is a given.

Manzano unloads a magazine into him and we -
