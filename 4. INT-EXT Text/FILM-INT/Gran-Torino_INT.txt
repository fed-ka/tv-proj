We're at the funeral of Dorothy Kowalski. In attendance
are mostly old folks, their offspring and several bored
teenagers.
WALT KOWALSKI stands towards the front of the church. He
speaks to an older MAN in a bulky, out-of-date suit.
OLDER MAN
I'm real sorry about Dorothy,
Walt. She was a real peach.
WALT
Thanks for coming, Al.
Walt Kowalski looks young for his age. He has slate blue
eyes, physically fit and has had the same buzz cut
hairstyle since getting out of the military in 1953.
Walt is also a perfectionist. Nothing escapes his
hawklike eyes, eyes that pierce and judge.
Walt looks around at how the young people have dressed at
his wife's funeral. His eyes narrow at his
GRANDDAUGHTER's belly button ring.
WALT
Jesus Christ.
Walt's two sons, MITCH and STEVE, watch their father from
across the pews.
MITCH
Look at the Old Man glaring at
Ashley. He can't even tone it
down at Mom's funeral?
STEVE
What do you expect? Dad's still
living in the 50s. He expects
his granddaughter to dress a
little more modestly.
MITCH
Yeah, well your kid's wearing a
Timberwolves jersey. I'm sure Dad
appreciates that.
STEVE
My point is that there's nothing
anyone can do that won't
disappoint the Old Man.

PAGE 3
It's inevitable. That's why we
stopped doing Thanksgivings; the
deal with the boat motor, the
broken bird bath, it's always
something.
MITCH
What are we going to do with him?
Don't you think he'll get in
trouble by himself over in the old
neighborhood?
STEVE
Why don't you have him move in
with you?
MITCH
Ha ha.
The choir sings the Beatitudes.
Walt looks around disgustedly at the people gathered as
one woman looks through her day planner, an old guy dozes
and his Granddaughter Ashley applies nail polish.
FATHER JANOVICH, the very young parish priest, steps up
to the altar and delivers the eulogy for Walt's wife.
Walt sits ramrod straight and listens to the thin, weak,
unconvincing words of Father Janovich.
FATHER JANOVICH
Death... is often a bittersweet
occasion to us Catholics. Bitter
in the pain it causes the deceased
... and their families. Sweet to
those who know the salvation that
awaits them. And some may ask,
what is death. Is it the end? Or
is it the beginning? And what is
life? What is this thing we call
life?
WALT
Jesus.
Walt coughs. He takes a handkerchief and wipes his lips.
He looks down and notices a speck of BLOOD on the white
cloth.
CONTINUED:
The house is crammed with people following the service.
Walt doesn't know what to do with himself. He has to
keep busy. Steve steps over to his father.
STEVE
A lot of people showed up after
the service.
WALT
Yeah, well, I s'pose they knew
there'd be plenty of ham. I think
I'll go downstairs and get some
more chairs.
STEVE
I'll do it, Dad.
WALT
Naw, we need them now, not next
week.
Grandsons JOSH, DANIEL and DAVID look through boxes in
the cellar. A box of old Korea War photos are pawed
through.
Josh holds up a black-and-white PHOTO -- a young WALT
looks utterly exhausted, behind him six bodies are
sprawled dead on the ground.
DAVID
Is that Dad?
DANIEL
No, it's Grandpa Walt.
Josh turns the photo over and reads it...
JOSH
Third Platoon, E company, March
second, 1952, Korea.'
DANIEL
Where's Korea?
JOSH
Hell if I know?
David holds up a MEDAL.

DAVID
Cool, I found a medal.
They hear someone coming downstairs. By the time Walt
descends the staircase, the boys sit on the couch,
pretending to be doing nothing.
Walt gives them a hard look as he grabs some chairs.

People eat and chat. Ashley marches over to her parents,
KAREN and Mitch.
ASHLEY (GRANDDAUGHTER)
How long do we have to stay, this
ghetto is a dead zone for my cell
and I'm bored.
Walt stands behind them with an armful of folding chairs,
he overheard his Granddaughter. Mitch and Karen are
embarrassed.
MITCH
Ashley, honey. Why don't you help
Grandpa Walt with the chairs?
ASHLEY
Me?
KAREN
Yes you.
ASHLEY
Grandpa Walt, can I help you with
the chairs.
WALT
I'll take care of it, you just
painted your nails.
Walt opens the folding chairs and looks out the window.
It's snowing. Walt puts on his coat, he almost looks
relieved to get out of the house.
WALT
I'd better salt the sidewalk
before someone falls and breaks a
hip.
Walt taps the floor with his boot and DAISY, his very,
very, very old DOG follows him outside.

Walt steps inside and catches Ashley sneaking a
cigarette. She has pulled back the canvas tarp that
covers his pride and joy, his beloved 1972 GRAN TORINO.
The Gran Torino is in mint condition. It has been babied
since the day it rolled off the line.
Ashley tosses her cigarette when she sees Grandpa Walt.
ASHLEY
Wow, Grandpa, when'd you get the
vintage car?
Walt looks at her for a second, then steps on her still
burning cigarette before answering.
WALT
1972.
ASHLEY
I never knew you had a cool old
car.
WALT
It's only been in here since
before you were born.

ASHLEY
So, what are you like going to do
with it like, when... you die?
Walt lights up a smoke --
WALT
Jesus, Joseph and Mary.
Walt pulls the cover back over the Gran Torino.
ASHLEY
Then what about that super cool
retro couch in the den, I'm going
to State next year and I don't
have, like, any furniture?
Walt walks out without commenting.
BACK IN WALT'S HOUSE

The doorbell rings and Walt opens the door. Standing
there is TAO, a sixteen-year-old HMONG boy. Walt scowls.
TAO is slight, he has long hair, long lashes, but is very
good-looking -- like an Asian Johnny Depp.
WALT
Who the hell are you?
TAO
(very quietly)
I'm Tao, I live next door.
WALT
What?! Speak up, boy, get the
shit out of your mouth. What do
you want?
TAO
Do you have jumper cables? My
uncle's car is old and...
WALT
No. And have some goddamned
respect, zipper head, we're
mourning over here.
Walt slams the door in Tao's face.
Walt turns and is suddenly cornered by Father Janovich.
Walt hates situations like this.

How you holding up, Walt?
WALT
Mr. Kowalski.
FATHER JANOVICH
Huh?
WALT
It's Mr. Kowalski, not Walt.
FATHER JANOVICH
Right, Mr. Kowalski. Your wife
and I became quite close these
last few months. She asked that I
watch over you when she passed on.
I told her I watch out for my
entire flock, but she made me
promise I'd keep an extra sharp
eye on you.
WALT
I appreciate your kindness to my
wife and now that you've spoken
your piece, why don't you move on
to the next sheep?
Walt starts to step away, but Father Janovich blocks him.
FATHER JANOVICH
Dorothy mentioned specifically
that it was her wish for you to go
to confession. She said she
couldn't remember the last time
you went.
WALT
Is that so?
FATHER JANOVICH
It is.
Walt drains his lowball glass.
WALT
Well, I confess I never much liked
church and only went because of
the wife. And I confess I have no
desire to confess to a boy who is
fresh out of the seminary.

BACK ON WALT

Walt gets his guests' engine running.
As they drive off, Walt hears faint SINGING. Walt looks
into his neighbor's backyard and can't believe his eyes.
The Hmong all sing and chant as three CHICKENS have their
heads sliced off, right there in the yard.
The chickens are held up and everyone chants louder.
It's a sacrifice. Walt spits in the snow and says to
Daisy.
WALT
Barbarians. Goddamned barbarians.

The house is a buzz of activity. The older Hmong speak
their native language, the younger generation speaks both
English and Hmong.
(NOTE: Hmong is subtitled when necessary.)
Tao's Grandmother (PHONG) complains to a MAN.
PHONG
(SUBTITLED)
There's no man in this house,
that's why my daughter should
remarry. Being a second wife is
better than having a woman be the
head of the household. It's not
our way.

Tao's not a man.
(GESTURES)
Look at him in the kitchen,
washing dishes like a woman. Even
his sister gives him orders and he
obeys.
The CAMERA PANS TO the kitchen where TAO washes a pile of
dishes. An older relative drops dishes in the sink,
without acknowledging Tao's presence. It's clearly an
insult.
In the LIVING ROOM the Hmong Soul Calling ceremony
starts its next phase. An elder, the family SHAMAN, is
present and begins the ritual.
As the entire Hmong family gathers to watch. Tao slips
on his coat and goes out the back door.

Daisy snoozes next to the front door. The doorbell

FATHER JANOVICH
Hi there, Walt.
WALT
Listen, son, you're not my barber,
you're not a friend, so why in the
hell do you think you can call me
Walt?
FATHER JANOVICH
Sorry... Mr. Kowalski.
WALT
So, what are you peddling now?
FATHER JANOVICH
Oh, nothing. Thought I'd drop by
and see how you were doing.
Haven't seen you in church in
awhile.
WALT
Okay. You've done your good deed,
now why don't you run along.
FATHER JANOVICH
I'd really like to talk, Mr.
Kowalski.
WALT
I don't think so, kid. Sorry.
FATHER JANOVICH
Why? Do you have a problem with
me, Mr. Kowalski?
WALT
You don't want to know.
FATHER JANOVICH
No, I do.
WALT
The problem is I think you're an
overeducated, 27-year-old virgin
who holds the hands of
superstitious old women and
promises them eternity.

Walt sits at the bar in the VFW (Veterans of Foreign

color jokes.
WALT
I got one. A Mexican, a Jew and a
colored guy walk into a bar, the
bartender looks up at them and
says -- get the fuck out.'
The gang laughs, until they see Father Janovich step up
to the bar. He smiles as he recognizes several faces.

Walt says nothing. He just sips his beer.
DARREL
What brings you in here, Father?
The meat raffle?
FATHER JANOVICH
No. I came down to talk to Walt,
if that's okay.
Mel and Darrel look at Walt. It puts him on the spot.
WALT
I have to hand it to you, Padre.
You are persistent.

I promised your wife.
Walt looks over at Mel and Darrel and then back at Father
Janovich.

I promised your wife I'd get you
to go to confession.
WALT
Jesus Christ, why'd you do that?
FATHER JANOVICH
She was very insistent. She made
me.
WALT
You sure are fond of promising
people stuff you can't deliver on.
FATHER JANOVICH
Let's talk about something else.
WALT
Like what?
FATHER JANOVICH
Life and death.
WALT
What would you know about it?
FATHER JANOVICH
I'd like to think I know a lot.
I'm a priest.
WALT
You stand at the altar and preach
on and on about life and death
without knowing anything other
than what you learned in priest
school. Everything you say sounds
like it's out of the Rookie
Preachers Handbook.

I don't know about that...

Walt waves his hand and cuts him off.
WALT
Death is bittersweet? Bitter in
the pain, sweet in the salvation.'
That's what you know of life and
death? Good God, it's pathetic.
FATHER JANOVICH
What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?
WALT
Plenty. I lived with death for
three years in Korea. We shot
people, we stabbed them with
bayonets, we hacked seventeen-year-
old kids to death with shovels,
for Christ's sake. I did things
that won't leave me till the day I
die, horrible things, things I
have to live with.
FATHER JANOVICH
And what about life?
Walt has to think for a second. He struggles with his
answer.
WALT
Well... I survived the war... got
married... and raised a family.
FATHER JANOVICH
Sounds like you know more about
death than you do living.
Walt downs a shot.
WALT
Maybe so.

Walt hears a sound and wakes up. He's very groggy, he
had plenty to drink at the VFW.
WALT
Daisy?
The dog sleeps in her bed in the corner. Walt looks at

WALT
Son of a bitch.
Walt pulls on his robe, opens the closet and pulls out
the big, 30-06 M1 Garand Rifle he took home from Korea.
Walt slides a magazine into the top of the M1 and
chambers a round with a loud SNAP.
23

The light flips on and before he can blink, Tao is face
to face with the barrel of Walt's M1 RIFLE.
Walt is silent, he has one eye closed so he can better
aim at Tao's forehead -- which is nine inches away. Tao
drops the tool he was holding, it bounces with a loud
metallic clang.
Tao backs away, his eyes wide with terror. As Tao backs
up, Walt advances, step for step.
Tao trips over a garden hose, which causes Walt to trip.
They both start to fall. The lightbulb is bumped with
the rifle barrel and swings back and forth.
As Walt hits the garage floor, he accidentally FIRES THE
RIFLE. The bullet goes through a big, metal Hamm's Beer
sign on the wall.
Tao scrambles to his feet and jumps like a deer over
Walt. Tao runs out of the garage and into the night.
Walt lies on the floor for a second, stunned. Sweat runs
down his forehead. He coughs up blood. The lightbulb
still swings, casting odd shadows in the garage.
WALT
Shit.

Walt drills heavy-gauge screen mesh over the windows on
the garage. The phone rings and Walt answers.
WALT
Hello?

jewelry.
MITCH
No. I was just wondering how you
are, what's going on, anything new
in the old neighborhood?
Walt looks at the bullet hole in his Hamm's Beer sign.
WALT
Nope.
MITCH
Great. Smooth sailing then?
WALT
Yup.
There's a very painful pause in the conversation.
MITCH
Well good... Say, Dad?
WALT
Uh-huh.
MITCH
Do you still know that guy from
the plant who has Viking season

The doorbell rings. Walt opens it to find Father
Janovich standing on his front step.
FATHER JANOVICH
Good afternoon, Walt.
Walt's eyes narrow.
FATHER JANOVICH
I mean, Mr. Kowalski.
WALT
I already told you I'm not going
to confession.
FATHER JANOVICH
Why didn't you just call the
police?
WALT
Pardon?
FATHER JANOVICH
I do work with some of the Hmong
gangs and I heard there was some
trouble in the neighborhood. Why
didn't you call the police?
WALT
Oh, I prayed for them to show up,
but guess what? No answer.
FATHER JANOVICH
What were you thinking? Someone
could have been killed. We're
talking life and death here.

WALT
Not that it's any of your
goddamned business, but when
things happen quickly like that,
you have to react. In Korea, we
never called the police' when a
swarm of screaming gooks came
pouring into our lines. We
reacted.
FATHER JANOVICH
We're not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski.
Walt says nothing.
FATHER JANOVICH
I've been thinking about our
discussion on life and death.
About what you said. About how
you carry around the horrible
things you were forced to do.
Horrible things that won't leave
you. It seems that it would do
you good to unload some of that
burden. Things done during war
are terrible, being ordered to
kill, killing to save others,
killing to save yourself. You're
right, those are things I don't
know anything about. But I do
know about forgiveness. And I've
seen a lot of men who have
confessed their sins, admitted
their guilt and left their burdens
behind them. Stronger men than
you. Men at war who were ordered
to do appalling things and are now
at peace.
Walt nods. Father Janovich threw a bull's-eye. Almost.
WALT
I'm impressed. You came with your
guns loaded, for once.
FATHER JANOVICH
Thank you.
WALT
You have balls, Father. And what
you said, you're right. I'm sure
stronger men than me have found
their salvation. Hallelujah. But
there's one thing you're way wrong
about.

BARBER
There, you look like a human being
again. You shouldn't wait so long
between haircuts, you cheap
bastard.
WALT
I'm just amazed that you're still
alive. I keep hoping you'll die
and they'll get someone good in
here, but you just hang in there,
you dumb, Italian-Wop-Dago, you.
BARBER
That'll be ten dollars, Walt.
WALT
Ten dollars? Jesus Christ,
Martin, you keep raising the
price. You sure you're not part
Jew?
Martin the Barber laughs at Walt.
BARBER
It's been ten bucks for the last
five years and you know it, you
thick-skulled, old Pollack son of

girls were supposed to be so

around in that neighborhood?
That's how you end up in the
obituaries, that is, if they can

quit, the Communists starting
killing the Hmong, so we came over

Walt is quiet for few seconds.
WALT
Why'd you pick the Midwest, for
Christ's sake? There's snow on
the ground near half the year.
Jungle people on the frozen
tundra?

Mitch and Karen sit across from Walt. A small store-
bought birthday cake sits in front of Walt.
Walt reads his birthday card. It's signed; Love Mitch,
Karen, Ashley and Josh. ALL the signatures have been
written in a woman's cursive style and with the same pen.
Mitch slides a wrapped gift across the table to Walt.
MITCH
Go ahead, Dad. Open it.
WALT
What is it?
MITCH
Just open it.
Walt opens the package, it's a Gopher Reaching Tool --
the kind that has an alligator clamp so you can pick up
objects that have fallen behind the stove, etc.
Walt looks at his son and daughter-in-law.
MITCH
It's a Gopher. It's so you can
reach stuff. You know, it makes

There's nothing wrong with making
things less hard on yourself.
MITCH
Karen's right, Dad. You've worked
hard your whole life. Maybe you
should think about taking it a
little easier?
Walt lights up a cigarette.
MITCH
And that's another thing, Dad.
You should get rid of the coffin
nails.
Walt says nothing.
MITCH
And the house, now that Mom's
gone, it's got to be a lot to
maintain, let alone clean... and
you're all alone in here.
It's worse than Walt thought. He puffs smoke.
KAREN
There's these great places now,
these communities where you don't

nothing but sorrow and death.
Several relatives usher Phong away from Walt. The
relatives are embarrassed at the outburst.
WALT
She hates me.
SUE
Yes, she hates you.
WALT
What did I do?
A little Hmong girl walks past and Walt pats her on the
head. Everyone in the room looks in horror at Walt.
WALT
What?! What the hell are all you
fish heads looking at?!
Sue looks around and then pulls Walt out of the room.
SUE
Maybe we should go in the other
room.

Sue explains a few facts to Walt.

SUE
A lot of the people in this house
are very traditional. Number one,
never touch a Hmong person on the
head, not even a child. Hmong
people believe that the soul
resides in the head, so don't do
that.
WALT
That's dumb, but fine.
SUE
Hmong people also consider looking
someone in the eye to be rude.
That's why everyone looks away
when you look at them.
WALT
Swell. Anything else?
SUE
Yeah, some Hmong smile or grin
when they're yelled at or get into
a confrontation. It's a cultural
thing. It expresses embarrassment
or insecurity, not that they're
laughing at you.
WALT
Good God, you people are all nuts.
45

Walt opens another beer, as Sue speaks Hmong to a
relative. Walt notices an Old Hmong Man staring at him.
Walt interrupts Sue.
WALT
Hey, Sue.
SUE
What?
WALT
You said you guys don't look you
in the eye, but that guy keeps
staring at me.
Sue laughs and gestures to the Old Hmong Man. The Old
Hmong Man steps over and nods to Walt.

SUE
This is Kor Khue. He's the Lor
family shaman.
WALT
Witch doctor?
Sue smiles and nods.
SUE
Something like that. The Hmong
hold their clan Shaman in very
high regards.
WALT
Boo-ga, boo-ga.
Kor Khue says something to Sue in Hmong. She turns and
translates to Walt.
SUE
Kor Khue is interested in you, he
heard what you did. He says he
would like to read you.
WALT
Huh?
SUE
He wants to read you. Tell you
your soul. It'd be rude not to
allow him this, it's a great
honor.
WALT
Tell Kor to be my guest, fire
away.
Sue speaks Hmong to the Shaman. The Shaman responds and
sits down across from Walt. He looks at Walt for a long
time.
Walt stares straight back at him. The Shaman mumbles to
himself.
Finally the Shaman turns to Sue and speaks very rapidly.
As Sue translates, the Shaman watches Walt's reaction.
SUE
Kor Khue says that you think
you've been disrespected. You do
not live your life. Your food has
no flavor. You are scared of your
past.

You stopped living years and years
ago. Kor Khue says you're not at
peace.
Walt looks like he's been hit by a truck. The Shaman
watches Walt closely, he knows he hit the nail on the
head.
Walt looks pale. He's been spooked good. He wipes sweat
from his forehead.
WALT
Excuse me.
Walt gets up and steps into the kitchen. He takes
several deep breaths. He's pretty shook up.
WALT
Je -- zuz -- Christ.
Walt looks around at all the Hmongs eating and carrying
on.
Walt sees a young man give up his seat to an Elder.
Walt sees a young woman go to each of the older folks and
offer tea and cookies from a tray.
Walt sees a child help an old man out of the bathroom.
Walt coughs hard. He wipes blood from his lips. Sue
comes in and looks at Walt.
SUE
Are you okay?
Walt brushes past her and goes into the bathroom.
46

EPIPHANY.
Walt washes his face in the sink and dries his hands.
He's still pale. He looks long and hard in the mirror.
Walt is stunned, it all adds up. Walt hasn't really
lived in 50 years, he hasn't relaxed or exhaled or let
his guard down since he got back from Korea in 1953.
WALT
(to himself)
Son of a bitch. I've got more in
common with these goddamned gooks
than my own spoiled-rotten family.

Walt opens the bathroom door. Sue stands there with a
concerned look on her face.
SUE
Are you okay?
WALT
Me? I'm fine.
SUE
You were bleeding?
Walt smiles disarmingly.
WALT
I just bit my tongue. I'm fine.
I'm great. Let's get some of that
gook food, I'm starving.
47

Walt sits amongst several old Hmong Women, who take great
delight in feeding him different Hmong dishes which he's
obviously never tasted before.
Walt reacts with great enthusiasm to the food,
occasionally making jokes like he's choking, etc. This
corny stuff goes over like gangbusters with the Hmong
ladies.
Sue comes in and rolls her eyes at Walt.
SUE
Come on, you glutton, let's go
downstairs.
WALT
Why?
SUE
To mingle.
WALT
I'm fine right here. I'm

Walt and Sue descend the stairway. Walt is really out of
his element down with all the Hmong teenagers.
And the first person he sees across the room is Tao.
WALT
Oh great.
SUE
Well, look who's over there.
WALT
What's-his-name who tried to steal
my Gran Torino.
SUE
My brother Tao.
WALT
Yeah, Toad.
Tao is in the corner, he avoids Walt's gaze. Sue walks
over to a group of boys, leaving Walt alone.
Walt doesn't know what to do with himself. He leans
against the DRYER. The DRYER wobbles.
Walt gets on his hands and knees. He looks under the
dryer. He adjusts the short leg to balance out the
machine.
He just can't help it.
All the Hmong kids watch Walt, trying not to laugh at
this strange white man on his hands and knees fixing a
dryer during a party. Walt looks up -- deer in the
headlights.
WALT
It was wobbly, but I fixed it.
It's fine now, shouldn't wobble
anymore.
The Hmong kids look away, covering their mouths with
their hands.
Walt glares at Tao, who immediately wipes the smile from
his face. Sue walks over and hands Walt a drink.
WALT
What's this?

PAGE 54
SUE
Rice liquor. Try it.
WALT
Alright.
Sue walks off. Walt sips his rice liquor and watches the
interaction between the boys and girls.
One particularly gorgeous young willow-wisp of a GIRL
stares across the room at Tao. Tao looks back at her,
but then looks away.
The Girl keeps looking at Tao, smiling and twisting her
hair.
Tao doesn't approach her, but three other young men do.
They do their best to charm her. She's polite, but not
interested, she keeps looking at Tao.
Walt laughs at Tao's ineptitude, shakes his head at this
wasted opportunity. Suddenly the Girl steps over to
Walt.
She smiles --
WA XAM (GIRL)
My friends and I were just
wondering what you're doing here?
WALT
Good question. What am I doing
here? Anyways, I'm Walt.
WA XAM
Hi, Walt. I'm Wa Xam.
WALT
Wa Yum?
WA XAM
No, Wa Xam. So... what do you do?
WALT
Me? Not too much... I fix stuff I

Funny, no.
Wa Xam laughs.
WA XAM
Well, have fun. I'm going to take
off.
WALT
A pleasure to meet you, Yum Yum.
She laughs at Walt butchering her name and goes upstairs.
The three young suitors follow her up. Tao watches her.
Walt comes over to Tao, who is startled. Walt laughs.
WALT
Relax, zipper head, whatta you
think I'm gonna do, shoot you?
Tao looks like he wants to run away.
WALT
I wouldn't say anything either, if
I was you.
Walt sips his rice liquor. Walt can't help but rib Tao.
WALT
You know, I knew you were a
dipshit even before the whole
garage deal, but I have to say
you're even worse with women than
you are stealing cars, Toad.

WALT
Wrong, egg roll. I completely
know what I'm talking about. I
know I'm not always the most
pleasant person to be around, but
I got the greatest woman who ever
lived to marry me. I had to work
at it, but I got her and it was
the best thing that ever happened
to me. Hands down.
Walt points across the room. He sways slightly.
WALT
But you? You just sit there and
watch as Ding Dong and Click Clack
and Charlie Chan walk away with
what's-her-face. She likes you,
you know.
TAO
Who?
WALT
She was standing over there,
orange dress, twisting her hair
and smiling at you.
TAO
You mean Wa Xam?
Walt takes a long swig off his drink and nods.
WALT
Yeah, yeah. Anyways, she likes
you, I know, I talked to her.
Great girl, charming girl. Love
her. I love Yum Yum. But you?
You just watch her walk out the

Standing on his doorstep are three Hmong women.
WALT

Gee holds up a plate covered with tinfoil.
WALT
No. Forget it. Stop bringing me

Walt wipes his mouth and runs the water in the sink.

Walt answers the door, just as Tao rings the doorbell a

Nothing, never mind.
Walt shuts the door.

Walt sits in the crowded waiting room. He looks around.
He's the only WHITE PERSON in the room. Even most of the
STAFF is African or from India.
As Walt waits, names are called out such as Alvarez,
Ngaima, Yang and Abdalla.
Finally when the name Kowalski is called, the Muslim
woman can't pronounce it correctly. Walt winces.

Walt sits in a chair, his hands folded in his lap.
A short Asian man in a doctor's smock comes in with a
chart.
ASIAN DOCTOR
Mr. Kowalski?
WALT
That's right.
ASIAN DOCTOR
Good afternoon. I looked over
your paperwork and I think we

No. Nope.

TAO
Man, where did you get all this
stuff?
WALT
What are you talking about?
TAO
All the tools and stuff.
WALT
Where the hell do you think I got
them, Toad? This may come as a
shock to a thief, but I actually
bought the things I have with
money I earned.
TAO
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's not what

Okay, what's this?
Tao points to a tool.
WALT
Post hole digger.
Tao starts pointing at things on the workbench in quick
succession, questioning Walt with his expression.
WALT
Hand spade. Tin snips. Nail
punch. Tack hammer. Putty knife.
Wire stripper. Drywall saw. Tile
spacers.
Silence. Walt can see something is bothering Tao, but
he's too uncomfortable to speak up --
WALT
What?
TAO
I can't afford to buy all this
stuff.
WALT
I didn't buy all this stuff at
once, blockhead. I've lived here
for fifty years. A man stays in
one place long enough he tends to
attract a decent set of tools.
TAO
Yeah, but...
WALT
Look, kid, I think I know where
you're going with this. You don't
need everything to maintain a
house. I'm going to let you in on
a little secret.
Walt rattles around his tool bench and slaps down THREE
items in quick succession.
WALT
This is for you. Roll of duct
tape, can of WD-40 and a pair of
vise-grips. Any man who's worth a
shit can do half his household
jobs with these three things. In
the odd chance that doesn't work
out, you can borrow something.

The blood you just coughed up.
That's not good, you should see a
doctor.
Walt quickly changes the subject -- while tightening the
screws that hold the fan blade to the motor hub.
WALT
So... what exactly was the deal
with those guys out on my lawn
that night? Who are they?
TAO
A gang. Hmong gangbangers.
WALT
I gathered that. What did they
want with you?
TAO
They wanted to take me away
because I blew my first
initiation.
WALT
You joined up with those pukes?
Damn, you are a pussy. Why in the
hell did you do that?
TAO
I don't know. They were
persuasive. My cousin's in the
gang. They just talked me into it

Boy does my ass hurt from all the

Walt and the Barber laugh harder.

WALT
If you do this, you're going to
follow through, right?
TAO
Yeah, yeah.
WALT
No, not yeah, yeah. Yes, as in
yes, sir, I'll do my best.
TAO
Yes, I'll do my best.
WALT
You better, because when I vouch
for someone, it's my word and I
don't want anyone making me look
bad.
TAO
No, I'm good. I'm totally into
this.
WALT
And don't lay down to people all
the time. Always look a person in
the eye. When you shake a man's
hand, you can usually tell where
you stand with him.
Walt hands a pair of beat-up WORK GLOVES to Tao.
WALT
Here, stuff these in your back
pocket.
TAO
Cool.
WALT
Just don't blow this.

Walt and Tao come in. Walt shakes hands with TIM
KENNEDY, the job super.
WALT
Kennedy, you drunken Irish goon,
how the hell are ya?
KENNEDY
Shitty, but who's gonna listen?
WALT
Not me.
Walt pours himself a cup of the bad job-site coffee.
KENNEDY
Help yourself, Walt, you dumb
Pollack.
WALT
I already did. This is the kid I
told you about. Tao, this is Tim
Kennedy, he's the super on the
job.
Kennedy looks Tao up and down. Tao looks him in the eye.
KENNEDY
What do we got, Walt?
WALT
He's done construction here and
there. Whatever you need, he'll
pick it up quick.
KENNEDY
You sure?
WALT
Sure.
KENNEDY
You speak English?

Yes, sir.

You got a vehicle? I see Walt

TAO
Not at the moment. I'm taking the
bus for now.
KENNEDY
The bus? Jesus Christ, you don't
have a car?
TAO
My headgasket cracked and the
goddamned prick at the shop wants
to bend me over for $2100.
KENNEDY
I just replaced the tranny in my
Tahoe and the sons a bitches
fucked me hard, just under $3200.
TAO
Goddamned thieves. It ain't
right.
KENNEDY
You got that right. Come on in on
Monday and we'll find something
for you to do.
Tao puts out his hand to shake.
TAO
Thanks, Mr. Kennedy.
Tim Kennedy shakes Tao's hand.
KENNEDY
It's Tim. What's your name again?
TAO
Tao.
KENNEDY
Okay. You owe me one, Walt.

Walt and Tao exit and walk back to the truck.

Walt pulls into a Home Depot parking lot.
TAO
What are we doing?
WALT
What are you gonna put all your
tools in, an empty rice bag?
81

Walt and Tao walk the aisles. Walt grabs a tool belt and
tosses it to Tao.
WALT
You'll need this.
Walt then tosses Tao a utility knife holder.
WALT
And you'll need that. Now where
the hell do they hide the hardware
holders?
TAO
I can't afford any of this.
WALT
I'll get it, but you're paying me

Walt pitches a hardware pouch at Tao.
WALT
And you need this too. That
should about do it.
TAO
Not to bitch, but won't I be
needing some tools?
WALT
Tools I got, but I ain't loaning
you my tool belt. You can buy
tools as you go.
TAO
I appreciate all this.
WALT
Aw, forget it.
TAO
No, I really do. Thank you.
Walt sticks out his jaw and looks Tao straight in the
eye. Tao doesn't know what to expect.
A PAUSE. Walt puts out his HAND to Tao. Tao extends his
and they SHAKE HANDS.
It's really quite a moment for both of them.
84
84
Tao leans over his desk with a black Sharpie marker. He
carefully writes Tao Vang Lor in black ink on the face
of his smashed-up tape measure. He puts it back into the
tool belt and grabs another tool to label.
85

Walt sits in the dark, the only light is from the radio
tuned to baseball. Daisy lies in the front seat. Next
to Daisy is the M1 RIFLE.
Walt watches as Spider and another Hmong gangbanger step
out of the rundown duplex, get in their Honda and drive
off.
WALT
That's the last of them.
Walt pulls out his Colt .45 automatic and chambers a
round.
89
89
Walt watches baseball. He hears a car outside. Shouts
are heard and glass breaks.
Walt gets up and looks out the shades...
TAO'S HOUSE is raked with GUNFIRE coming from a VAN!
Windows shatter and the siding splinters.
FIFTY BULLETS shake the house before the VAN peels off.
91
91
Walt sits across from Tao, drinking rice liquor. Walt
speaks loudly, without any consideration for Phong who
shoots him dirty looks.
WALT
This is exactly what I didn't
want. Damn gooks. Why the hell
am I even here?
TAO
Maybe one of her friends called
and she just changed plans.
Walt sips the rice liquor. Walt now speaks quietly to
Tao.
WALT
In Korea I learned not to care.
The best friends of my life are
still missing somewhere in Korea.
You harden yourself. Don't let
anything get to you.
Phong looks out the window and screams. She runs over
and swings open the door.
Everyone expects the worst...
And it comes like a cold wind -- SUE WALKS IN LIKE A
ZOMBIE. She has been brutally beaten. Her clothes are
dirty and torn.
BLOOD runs down SUE'S legs from under her shirt.
Walt looks at her and the glass falls from his hand.
Sue staggers into Vu's arms. Vu weeps. Sue hugs her
mother and sobs.
Tao reaches to hug his sister, but Phong screeches at
him, pointing at Walt and back to Tao.
Walt is destroyed. He steps outside into the dark.
92

Walt staggers across the yard to his house.
WALT
No, no, no, no, no.

Walt bursts in the door, throws himself in an easy chair
and CRIES. He tries to stop and cries harder.
It's the first time Walt has cried in fifty years. He
wails, crying for Tao, Sue, his wife, kids and himself.
He lets it all out. Daisy jumps in his lap and he hugs
his old dog as he bawls.
CUT TO:

Walt sits, red-eyed. He's done crying. Family photo
albums are scattered around.
Father Janovich knocks and eases open the front door.
FATHER JANOVICH
Mr. Kowalski, are you in here?
WALT
Come on in.
Father Janovich comes in and sits down across from Walt.
FATHER JANOVICH
Are you okay?
Walt nods.
FATHER JANOVICH
The police finally left. No one
is talking. One thing about the
Hmong, they keep their mouths
shut.
WALT
I've noticed that.
Father Janovich picks up a photo album and flips through
it. Pictures of Mitch and Steve as babies.
WALT
You know, there's no way that Tao
or Sue are gonna have any peace if
these gang guys don't go away. Go
away forever. You know it as well
as I do.
FATHER JANOVICH

FATHER JANOVICH
They took Sue to the hospital.
She's scared. They're all scared.
WALT
I'm not.
FATHER JANOVICH
I know that. Believe me, they all
know that. Tao especially. He's
sitting out there staring at your
front door. You know what he
expects, Mr. Kowalski.
WALT
Yeah, well what would you do if
you were me? If you were Tao?
What would you do?
Father Janovich shakes his head.
FATHER JANOVICH
I know what I'd do if I was you,
or at least what you think you
should do. If I was Tao I guess
I'd want vengeance. I'd want to
stand shoulder to shoulder with
you and kill those guys.
WALT
And you?
FATHER JANOVICH
What would I do? I'd come over
here and talk to you I guess. I
know you're close with these
people, but this pisses me off
too, Mr. Kowalski.
Walt nods.
WALT
Wanna beer?
FATHER JANOVICH
I'd love one.
WALT
They're in the cooler, grab me one
too.

He opens a Pabst and takes a big swig.

WALT
Nothing's fair, Father.
Father Janovich and Walt sit for awhile.
FATHER JANOVICH
So, what are you going to do, Mr.
Kowalski?
WALT
Call me Walt.
Father Janovich nods.
FATHER JANOVICH
Alright, what are you going to do,
Walt?
WALT
Not sure yet. All I do know is
they don't have a goddamned
chance.

Walt sits at the kitchen table in his robe, drinking
coffee. Tao comes in without even knocking on the door.
TAO
What are you doing?
WALT
I'm thinking.
TAO
Thinking time is over. Now it's
time to knock the ass out of those
pricks.

You have to have a clear head,

TAO
No. Don't let me down, Walt. Not
you. This is going to end, today.
Walt stands up and pulls out a chair for Tao to sit in.
WALT
Sit down.
TAO
I don't want to sit.
WALT
I SAID SIT DOWN! Just listen up
for a second and don't say
anything.
Tao sits down. Walt rubs his hands together.
WALT
I know what needs to be done. I
need to prepare, this needs to be
carefully planned. You know I'm
the right man for this. So cool
down for a little while and meet
me back here at 4 P.M. I promise
you, what needs to be done, will
be done.
TAO
I say we go now. Right now.
WALT
And do what? You want to go kill
your cousin and those other Zips.
Mr. Tough-Guy-All-Of-A-Sudden is
out for blood. What do you even
know about it?
Tao is furious, but says nothing.
WALT
Trust me, Tao. Cool down and
we'll meet back here at four.
Okay?
Tao doesn't answer.

Walt soaks in the tub. It's filled with bubbles. Walt
looks over at Daisy who rests on a towel in the corner.
Walt lights a CIGARETTE and exhales. Daisy curls up her
lips at the smoke.
WALT
I know, I know. Give me a break,
it's the first time I've ever
smoked in the house.

Martin finishes cutting Walt's hair.
BARBER
There, all done. Ten bucks
American.
WALT
I don't suppose you still have
steady enough hands to give a guy
a straight shave, you withered,
old Italian mummy?
BARBER
You? A straight shave? You've
never ordered a straight shave,
ever.
WALT
That's right. I always wondered
what they were like. Unless
you're too goddamned busy?

Walt gets fitted for a new suit. The OLD TAILOR
carefully measures Walt's shoulders.
WALT
So you can take it in right here?
TAILOR
Yes, sir. Take about an hour.
WALT
That's great. Thank you.
TAILOR
Yes, sir.
WALT
Never had a fitted suit.

Walt comes in and Father Janovich looks up.
FATHER JANOVICH
Mr. Kowalski, what can I do for
you?
WALT
I've come for confession.
FATHER JANOVICH
Oh Lord Jesus, what have you done?

Nothing. Take it easy.

Walt calmly sits on one side and a very nervous, sweating
Father Janovich sits on the other.
FATHER JANOVICH
How long has it been since your
last confession?
WALT
Forever. Bless me, Father, for I
have sinned.
FATHER JANOVICH
What are your sins, my son.
WALT
In 1968, I kissed Betty Jablonski
at the work Christmas party.
Dorothy was talking with the other
wives and it just happened.
FATHER JANOVICH
Yes. Go on.
WALT
I made nine hundred dollars profit
selling a boat and motor and never
reported the taxes which is the
same as stealing.
FATHER JANOVICH
Yes. Fine.
WALT
And lastly, I was never close to
my two sons. I don't know them.
I didn't know how.
FATHER JANOVICH
That's it?

It's bothered me for years.

Walt says nothing. Father Janovich looks hard at Walt.
FATHER JANOVICH
I'm going over to that house
today, Mr. Kowalski.
WALT
Is that so?
FATHER JANOVICH
It is. And every other day until
you see the folly in what you are
planning.
WALT
I gotta go, Padre. Busy day
ahead.
FATHER JANOVICH
Go in peace.
WALT
I am at peace.
Walt and Father Janovich shake hands. Walt exits.
Father Janovich exhales loudly and drops into his chair.
FATHER JANOVICH
Je -- zuz -- Christ.

Walt carefully reassembles the two weapons he just
cleaned and oiled. Tao comes in and looks down at the
two weapons --
The 30-06 M1 GARAND RIFLE and the COLT .45 PISTOL.
Tao picks up the heavy RIFLE.
TAO
Which one do I get?

You ever fire a weapon?

Tao aims the rifle at an imaginary target.
WALT
Put that down. I got something
for you.
TAO
What?
WALT
In Korea, October, 1952. We were
sent up to sweep a Chink machine
gun nest that had carved us up
pretty bad. I was the only one
who came back... I received the
Silver Star. I want you to have
it.
TAO
Why?
WALT
When we went up that hill, we knew
it was ten to one against us, but
we went anyway. This trouble now,
it's similar. We're walking right
into it. We might not be coming
home tonight.
TAO
The hell we won't. We're going to
roll in there and tear ass.
WALT
Don't be a fool, these guys are
waiting for that exact reaction.
Tao is quiet for a minute.
TAO
How many?
WALT
How many what?
TAO
How many men did you kill in
Korea?

Thirteen for sure. Probably more.

What was it like to kill a man?
WALT
You don't want to know.
TAO
Why not?
WALT
Go get the Silver Star. It's in a
blue wooden box in the cellar.
Tao goes downstairs. He turns on the light and goes into
the cellar. Tao locates a BLUE WOODEN BOX and opens it.
Tao holds up the MEDAL. He looks at it closely.
AND WHAM -- Walt slams the heavy cellar DOOR shut behind
him. Walt slides the BOLT LOCK into place with a loud
CLICK.
Tao couldn't kick his way out of there in ten years. Of
course he tries anyway. Tao is furious. He throws
things.
TAO
What the hell are you doing?! Let
me out of here, you goddamned son-
of-a-bitch!!
WALT
Quit smashing everything. You'll
never get out of there, so just
relax.
TAO
You let me out, you crazy old
fuck, or I will kill you when I
get out of here.
Tao pounds on the door. Walt pounds back with a strength
and authority which startles Tao.
WALT
You want to know how it feels to
kill a man? It feels goddamned
lousy. And it feels even worse
when you get a medal for bravery
right after you mowed down some
scared kid when he tries to give
up. A dumb, scared, little gook,
just about your age. I shot him
with the same rifle you just held
upstairs.

you like a dope. I'll call
someone and have them let you out
later.
TAO
No! Let me out!!
Tao pounds on the door.
WALT
You've come a long way. I'm proud
to call you a friend. You have
your whole life ahead of you,
whereas this is what I do. I
finish things. You'd just get in
the way. Sorry.
Walt goes back upstairs, leaving Tao locked up in his
cellar.
Tao howls to be let out.

Walt walks in and sits down. He nods to the regulars.
WALT
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
DARREL
Walter, how are you doing?
WALTER
Never been better.
BARTENDER

WALT
Why don't you get all the guys the

WALT
I'm sure. This is too good not to

Walt finishes his Scotch and points for one more.

Open the door and go let your
brother out of the cellar. I have

The line goes dead as Walt hangs up. Sue jumps up out of
bed, pulls on some clothes and runs downstairs.
Phong blocks her path. Phong grabs Sue by the arms.

Sue opens the front door, runs to the stairwell and
pounds down the stairs.
SUE

They struggle at the top of the stairs and spill into the

catches his eye...
The kitchen table.
The RIFLE and PISTOL are still there.
Walt purposely left the guns at home.

We're at the funeral of Walter Kowalski. Walt is dressed
in his new suit.
Along with the crowd you'd expect, Tao and Sue are seated
near the front.
Walt's sons and family are there. Mitch gives Tao a
dirty look. Tao looks back at him, his gaze bores right

FATHER JANOVICH
Walt Kowalski once said to me I
didn't know anything about life or
death because I was an
overeducated, 27-year-old virgin
who held the hands of
superstitious old women and
promised them eternity.' Walt
definitely had no problem calling
it like he saw it.' But Walt was
right. I knew really nothing
about life or death until I got to
know Walt. And boy, did I learn.
112

All of Walt's family are seated in an office as a LAWYER
reads Walt Kowalski's will.
Tao is present along with Walt's family.
LAWYER
Which brings us to our last item.
And again, please forgive the
language used in Mr. Kowalski's
will. I'm simply reading it as it
was written.
The LAWYER takes a sip of water before reading...
LAWYER
And to my friend, Tao Vang Lor, I
leave my 1972 Gran Torino on the
condition that you don't choptop
the roof like a damned spick,
don't paint any idiotic flames on
it like some white-trash hillbilly
and don't put a big gay spoiler on
the rear-end like you see on all
the other zipper heads' cars. It
just looks like hell. If you can
refrain from doing any of that,
it's yours.
FADE OUT.
THE END
