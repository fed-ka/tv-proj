                                            ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      INT. INDUSTRIAL GARAGE - NIGHT11

      DROPS of BLOOD glisten across the floor of a barely lit 
      garage. The trail leads to a pair of SHOES dragging past 
      parked cars, an unconscious BODY pulled urgently by an UNSEEN 
      FIGURE.

      Gently but quickly, the body is laid on the floor. The hood 
      of a car pops open and GLOVED HANDS reach in to attach JUMPER 
      CABLES to the battery.

      The shirt on the body yanks open, exposing a bloodied torso. 
      The other ends of the jumper cables touch down on the pale 
      skin and a BURST OF ELECTRICITY lights up the garage, 
      revealing the identity of the body--

      ISAAC LAHEY.

      His eyes surge with a YELLOW GLOW as he s shocked back to 
      consciousness. Blinking in confusion, he sees a beautiful but 
      mysterious GIRL peering down at him.

                                  GIRL
                    Quiet.

        Surprisingly strong, she helps him back to his feet. But 
      Isaac stumbles, nearly passing out again.

                                  GIRL (CONT D)
                    Stay with me. We re almost there.

      The world blurs around him as they move, the Girl struggling 
      to keep him upright.

                                  ISAAC
                          (barely able to whisper)
                    My neck...

      His head dips forward to reveal puncture wounds at the nape 
      of his neck.

                                  GIRL
                    From their claws. It s how they 
                    share memories.     TEEN WOLF "TATTOO" EP#301PINK11/14/122.

        CONTINUED:11

                                  ISAAC
                    But I don t remember anything.

                                  GIRL
                    Also how they steal them.

      She pulls his hands around to the front of her body.

                                  GIRL (CONT D)
                    Listen to me. No matter what 
                    happens, you hold on, okay? You 
                    hold on tight.

      AN ENGINE ROARS TO LIFE, headlight BLAZING on. Before Isaac 
      can even realize they re on a MOTORCYCLE, they hurtle 
      forward, racing into the darkness.

      EXT. INDUSTRIAL ALLEYWAY - NIGHT22

      Bursting out of the shadows, the motorcycle rockets into an 
      alleyway. Despite the wind at his ears, Isaac s hearing 
      focuses, other sounds fading under--

      Movement. Feet pounding pavement.

                                  ISAAC
                    I hear someone. Someone s coming.

      The Girl responds fast, cutting a corner and heading for--

      EXT. STREET - NIGHT33

      An empty street. Open road ahead. As the Girl increases the 
      speed, Isaac glances back. SOMEONE races after them. 
      Incredibly fast, eyes GLOWING RED. It s an ALPHA. And, most 
      astonishingly, he s catching up to them.

                                  ISAAC
                    Faster!

      The Alpha moves to their right and a strikingly handsome face 
      comes into view. A clawed hand rises to attack when--

      HE DISAPPEARS, falling back, as if swallowed up by the 
      shadows.

                                  ISAAC (CONT D)
                    Look out!

      The Alpha HURTLES in from the left, CLAWS swiping out. The 
      motorcycle BUCKS, back tire kicking up gravel. Then, just as 
      suddenly, the Alpha vanishes back into the shadows.     TEEN WOLF "TATTOO" EP#301PINK11/14/123.

        CONTINUED:33

      With a SNARL, he appears on the right, hurtling at the bike 
      to swipe at it again. But the Girl BRAKES hard, letting the 
      Alpha surge ahead. She pulls into a turn and--

      CLAWS LASH OUT, cutting at the back of the motorcycle, nearly 
      crashing it.

      The Alpha appears on the left. Then on the right. Bursting in 
      and out of the shadows from each side, as if he s somehow 
      everywhere.

      But when Isaac looks back again, the truth is revealed. There 
      are TWO PAIRS of RED EYES following them.

                                  ISAAC (CONT D)
                    Two of them.

                                  GIRL
                    Twins.

      Equally handsome. Equally terrifying. They fall back as the 
      Girl makes a desperate turn off the street.

      EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT44

      BRAKES SQUEALING, the motorcycle comes to a halt. The 
      alleyway ends in a wall. Isaac and the Girl are locked in. 
      She quickly spins the bike around to turn back.

      But the Twin Alphas appear at the other end of the alley. 
      Catching their breath. Taking their time to approach.

                                  GIRL
                    Remember what I said before?

                                  ISAAC
                    Hold on?

                                  GIRL
                    Hold on.

      She REVS the ENGINE just as one Twin charges forward while 
      the other bends down. The first puts his foot on the second s 
      back and pushes off.

      FLIPPING UP with acrobatic grace, the Twin launches toward 
      the Girl and Isaac to attack.

      But the motorcycle BLASTS forward, SMASHING RIGHT THROUGH THE 
      DOORS OF THE BUILDING and--     TEEN WOLF "TATTOO" EP#301PINK11/14/124.


      INT. INDUSTRIAL BUILDING/CORRIDOR - NIGHT55

      Into a darkened corridor. Tires burning across the slick 
      tile, the motorcycle surges in. Behind the Girl, Isaac s 
      eyelids flutter. Still injured, he s fading. And falling.

                                  GIRL
                    Isaac!

      His body dips to the side. The Girl reaches for him, trying 
      to grab hold.

                                  GIRL (CONT D)
                    Stay with me--Isaac!

      The bike tilts with the shift in weight. The Girl brakes, but 
      it s too late. THEY CRASH. Bike SMASHING against the floor, 
      bodies tumbling, metal scraping tile. 

      Isaac rolls, slamming into the wall of the corridor. The 
      impact jolts him back to a blurry consciousness.

      The motorcycle lies a few feet away, one wheel still 
      spinning. Trapped underneath, the Girl doesn t move.

      AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR - TWO SILHOUETTED FIGURES 
      approach. And then something odd happens...

      The First Twin begins taking off his shirt, pulling it up 
      over his head while continuing to approach. As the shirt 
      falls to the floor, he gets down on all fours. 

      The Second Twin reaches over and literally shoves his hand 
      into the First Twin s back.

      Shocked, Isaac watches the silhouette of the Second Twin 
      appear to be swallowed up into the back of the First. 

      The dark shape of the two conjoining twins rises, growing in 
      size until it finally steps into the light to reveal ONE 
      MONSTROUSLY LARGE ALPHA.

      Unleashing a terrifying ROAR, the Alpha Wolf charges, coming 
      at them like an armored truck at full speed.

      Mustering his last bit of strength, Isaac tries to stand, 
      eyes GLOWING a defiant yellow even as--

      THE ALPHA WOLF hurtles toward him for the kill.

                                  GIRL (CONT D)
                    Isaac.     TEEN WOLF "TATTOO" EP#301PINK11/14/125.

        CONTINUED:55

      He whirls back to find the Girl sitting up and holding a 
      military-grade TASER RIFLE. Isaac ducks as she FIRES. 
      Electrified PINS hurtle out, landing right on the Alpha's 
      body in a flash of LIGHTNING-LIKE SPARKS.

      Hand shielding his eyes from the glare, Isaac hears one 
      PAINED SCREAM suddenly become two. When he blinks again the 
      world comes into focus and the Alphas are gone.

      The corridor lies empty, slowly filling with the sound of 
      approaching SIRENS. Isaac turns to the injured, barely 
      conscious Girl.

                                  GIRL (CONT D)
                    I thought I told you to hold on.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MAIN TITLE: TEEN WOLF

      INT. TATTOO PARLOR - NIGHT66

      Under a wall of sample designs including hearts, barbed 
      roses, tribal symbols and all manner of typography, a TATTOO 
      ARTIST looks over a folded piece of paper.

                                  TATTOO ARTIST
                    Good thing you drew me a picture.

      On the paper are two simple bold BLACK LINES, one slightly 
      thicker than the other. 

      Sitting in the client chair, Scott McCall gives the man a 
      nervous smile. By the counter, Stiles holds up a book of 
      sample tattoos.

                                  STILES
                    Sure you don t want something like 
                    this?

      He points to an image of a green-scaled LIZARD with yellow 
      eyes. Scott throws him a glare.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Too soon?

      Putting the book down, he approaches the chair where Scott 
      begins rolling up his sleeve.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    I don t know, dude. These things 
                    are pretty permanent.     TEEN WOLF "TATTOO" EP#301PINK11/14/126.

        CONTINUED:66

                                  SCOTT
                    I m not changing my mind.

                                  STILES
                    Okay, but why two bands?

                                  SCOTT
                    I just like it.

                                  STILES
                    Wouldn t it be better if your first 
                    tattoo had some kind of meaning?

                                  SCOTT
                    Getting a tattoo means something.

                                  TATTOO ARTIST
                    He s right. Tattooing s been going 
                    on for thousands of years. The 
                    Tahitian word tatua means  to mark 
                      something.  Like a rite of passage.

                                  SCOTT
                    See? He gets it.

                                  STILES
                    He s covered in tattoos. Literally.

                                  TATTOO ARTIST
                          (to Scott)
                    Can we get started?

      Scott nods. The Tattoo Artist slides his chair over to begin.

                                  TATTOO ARTIST (CONT D)
                    You don t have any problem with 
                    needles, do you?

                                  SCOTT
                    Nope.

      Machine BUZZING to life, the Tattoo Artist lowers the needle 
      while, behind them, Stiles promptly keels over.

      INT. STILES S JEEP - NIGHT77

      Ice pack held to his head, Stiles slips in behind the wheel 
      of his Jeep. In the passenger seat, Scott eyes the BANDAGE on 
      his arm with a pained expression.

                                  STILES
                    You okay?     TEEN WOLF "TATTOO" EP#301PINK11/14/127.

        CONTINUED:77

                                  SCOTT
                    Kind of burns.

                                  STILES
                    You did just have your skin 
                    punctured by a needle like a 
                    hundred thousand times.

                                  SCOTT
                    Yeah, but I don t know if it s 
                    supposed to be like this.

      He sits up with a sudden wince.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    This definitely doesn t feel right. 
                      I think--I think I gotta  take it 
                    off.

      He starts pulling at the bandage, ripping at it until the red 
      and raw skin is exposed. But more alarming are the BLACK 
      VEINS rippling around the tattoo.

      Eyes widening, Scott watches the tattoo begin to DISAPPEAR, 
      slowly but steadily vanishing from his arm until it s simply 
      and utterly gone.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                          (crushed)
                    It... It healed.

                                  STILES
                    Oh, thank God. I hated it.
                          (off Scott s look)
                    Sorry.

      He gives an apologetic smile as LIGHTS flash in the window 
      behind him, a car soaring past.

      INT. LYDIA S CAR - NIGHT88

      Reflected in the visor mirror, Allison Argent delicately 
      brushes away an EYELASH on her cheek while Lydia drives, 
      pedal to the floor.

                                  LYDIA
                    It s not a double date. It s just a 
                    group thing.

                    Do they know it s a group thing? 
                    Because I told you I m not ready to

                                  LYDIA
                    You were in France and you didn t 
                    do any dating? For four months?

                                    ALLISON
                    Did you? I mean after--

                                  LYDIA
                    Do not mention his name.

                                    ALLISON
                    Is he okay? I mean, did everything 
                    work out?

                                  LYDIA
                    The doctors looked like idiots when 
                    he turned up alive, but everyone 
                    got over it. And yes, Derek taught 
                    him the Werewolf 101. Like how not 
                    to randomly kill people during a 
                    full moon.

                                    ALLISON
                    So you ve talked to him?

                                  LYDIA
                    Not since he left for London.

                                    ALLISON
                    You mean since his Dad moved him to 
                    London.

                                  LYDIA
                    Whatever. He left. And seriously? 
                    An american werewolf in London? 
                    Like that s not going to be a 
                    disaster.

                                    ALLISON
                    Then you re totally over him?

                                  LYDIA
                    Would I be going on a double-date 
                    if I wasn t?

      She turns to notice Allison s satisfied smile.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    Okay, it s a double-date. Not an 
                    orgy. You ll live.

      She brakes at the RED LIGHT, neither of them noticing 
      Stiles s Jeep pulling up in the lane right next to them.     TEEN WOLF "TATTOO" EP#301PINK11/14/129.


      INT. STILES S JEEP - NIGHT99

      Still examining his arm where the tattoo should be, Scott 
      replies to Stiles with a shake of his head.

                                  SCOTT
                    No, we agreed to give each other 
                    the summer. No texts, no calls.

                                  STILES
                    So how do you know she won t be 
                    back at school?

                                  SCOTT
                    After everything that happened? I m 
                    not sure she s coming back at all.

                                  STILES
                          (eyes out his side window)
                    I think she is. I d say pretty 
                    definite. Like one hundred percent.

      Scott looks to the car next to them. And stops breathing. 
      Through the window, he sees Allison talking to Lydia while 
      waiting for the light. 

      The world quiets, time slowing as he watches her smile, 
      laughing about something. And then--

      She looks right at him. They lock eyes. Then both turn away.

                                  SCOTT
                    Oh God--

      INT. LYDIA S CAR - NIGHT1010

      Allison sinks into her seat, trying to disappear from view.

                                    ALLISON
                    Oh my God, oh my God, I can t see 
                    him. Not yet--

      INT. STILES S JEEP - NIGHT1111

      Scott presses back, trying to hide behind Stiles.

                                  SCOTT
                    Drive, Stiles, just drive--

      INT. LYDIA S CAR - NIGHT1212

      Hand covering the side of her face, Allison practically 
      crawls under the dashboard.

                                    ALLISON
                    Lydia, go--please, go, please--

                                  LYDIA
                    But the light--

      INT. STILES S JEEP - NIGHT1313

      Stiles reaches for the window button.

                                  STILES
                    I think we should say something.

                                  SCOTT
                    No, no, no--Stiles.

                                  STILES
                    I m going to say hi.

      He rolls down the window.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Heyyyy--

      Lydia FLOORS IT, leaving Stiles smiling at an empty lane.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Yeah. Okay then.

      INT. LYDIA S CAR - NIGHT1414

      With the Jeep disappearing in the rear view mirror, Lydia 
      eases up on the gas and turns to Allison.

                                  LYDIA
                    You all right?

      Curled into a fetal position, Allison just shakes her head.

      INT. STILES S JEEP - NIGHT1515

      Light changed to green, Stiles hits the gas.

                                  SCOTT

                                  STILES
                    You see any turns?

                                  SCOTT
                    We re going to look like we re 
                    following them.

                    Well, what do you want me to do?

                                  SCOTT
                    I don t know--anything.

      Stiles hits the BRAKES.

      INT. LYDIA S CAR - NIGHT1616

      In the rear view mirror, Lydia sees the Jeep SLAM to a HALT.

                                    ALLISON
                    Lydia, stop. I need to go back. I 
                    need to talk to him.

      INT. STILES S JEEP - NIGHT1717

      Stiles and Scott watch Lydia s car slow to a stop as well. 
      Both cars now sitting in the middle of the road.

      INT. LYDIA S CAR - NIGHT1818

      Allison and Lydia glance back through the rear window.

                                  LYDIA
                    They stopped too.

      Eyes on the road behind them, neither girl notices an out-of-
      focus SHAPE approaching from ahead.

                                    ALLISON
                    Why would they stop?

                                  LYDIA
                    It s Stiles and Scott. You really 
                    want to try applying logic to those 
                    two?

      The shape comes faster--AN ANIMAL--loping towards them.

      CONTINUED:1818

        A TERROR-STRICKEN DEER charges right into Lydia s car, 
      ANTLERS SMASHING through the windshield. Both girls SHRIEK, 
      hands rising to shield themselves from SHATTERING GLASS.

      EXT. ROAD - NIGHT1919

      Doors flung open, Scott and Stiles jump from the Jeep. They 
      race to the other car where Lydia and Allison stumble out, 
      glass fragments falling from their clothes.

                                  SCOTT
                    Are you okay?

                                  LYDIA
                    It came out of nowhere--

                                  STILES
                    Are you hurt?

                    --I m okay, I m all right.

      Catching her breath, she looks into Scott s eyes, both of 
      them noticing his hands on her arms, the kind of touch that 
      could easily become an embrace.

                                  LYDIA
                    Well, I m not okay. I m completely 
                    freaked out. Why the hell did it do 
                    that?

      Letting Allison go, Scott cautiously approaches the deer now 
      lying still over the crumpled hood of Lydia s car.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    I saw its eyes right before it hit 
                    us. It s like--like it was crazy.

                                  SCOTT
                    No. It was scared.

      He places a gentle hand on the animal s body.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                      Actually... terrified.

      Slowly gazing up to the surrounding woods, he searches the 
      shadows, trying to find whatever it might have been that 
      literally scared this animal to death.   TEEN WOLF "TATTOO" EP#301PINK11/14/1213.

      She nods, backing away to allow them past. Then turns to the

      FADE IN:

      INT. MCCALL HOME/SCOTT S ROOM - DAY2222

      The clock by Scott s bed hits 6:45 AM and unleashes a 
      BLEATING ALARM. But a LACROSSE BALL bounces off the front, 
      silencing it.

      Already awake, Scott pounds through one-armed chin-ups at the 
      bar in his bathroom doorway. With his free hand, he reads a 
      copy of Jack London s CALL OF THE WILD.

      Feet hitting the floor, he drops the book on a pile by his 
      desk. Hemingway, Faulkner, Dickens, all well-worn paperbacks. 
      A CHIME comes from the computer. On the screen a PSAT WORD OF 
      THE DAY appears.

                                  SCOTT
                          (reading)
                      Ephemeral. Lasting for a short 
                    time. Transient. Momentary.

      He glances at his arm, fingers gliding over the skin where 
      the tattoo should be.

                      Ephemeral.

      INT. ARGENT APARTMENT/ALLISON S ROOM - DAY2323

      Amid unpacked boxes in a new apartment and a new room, 
      Allison sits on her bed, school bag on her lap, a far off 
      look in her eyes. 

      Her father, Chris Argent, peers in from the doorway.

                                  ARGENT
                    Ready?

                                    ALLISON
                    Yeah.

      But she doesn t move.

                                  ARGENT
                    You can wait until tomorrow if you 
                    want. I know the first day back can 
                    be tough.

                    You could wait a week if that makes 
                    things easier.

                                    ALLISON
                      I promised Lydia I d drive her 
                    since her car s wrecked. I should 
                    go. I want to go.

      Still, she doesn t move. Until, finally, Argent reaches a 
      hand out. Grateful, Allison takes it, letting him help her to 
      her feet.

      INT. STILINSKI HOME/STILES S ROOM - DAY2424

      Fingers flying over the keyboard of his laptop, Stiles barely 
      pauses to look at Stilinski waiting by his door.

                    But that s crossing the road. The 
                    deer last night came right down the 
                    middle.

                                  STILINSKI
                    I m not going to beg you.

                    Good. I m impervious to your 
                    influence anyway.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Would you be open to a bribe?

                    You couldn t meet my price.

      Stilinski considers this. Then grabs Stiles s chair and 
      begins pulling both it and him away from the desk.   TEEN WOLF "TATTOO" EP#301PINK11/14/1217.

      INT. MARTIN HOME/LYDIA S ROOM - DAY2525

      At her vanity, Lydia finishes getting ready. Lipstick 
      applied, lashes thickened, a final brush of the hair. Then 
      her eyes fall on something nearby. She grabs it. Turning back 
      to the mirror, she s now wearing a LEATHER JACKET.

      In the bed behind her, a handsome young man named BRANDON 
      lies shirtless--and very likely pantless--under the covers.

                                    BRANDON
                    Looks good on you.

      With a shrug, she takes it off and tosses it to a chair.

                    So you think we could go on a real

      Grabbing her school bag, she spins for the door, hurrying out 
      and into--

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - DAY2626

      A sea of backpacks flooding the school lot on the first day 
      of class. RACING past buses and cars, a student hurtles in on 
      a beat-up, used MOTOCROSS BIKE. 

      As he parks, the helmet comes off to reveal Scott, wearing a 
      proud smile at his upgrade from bicycle.    TEEN WOLF "TATTOO" EP#301PINK11/14/1218.

      CONTINUED:2626

      Until he looks over to see a jet black, clearly very 
      expensive MOTORCYCLE next to his. And, interestingly, the 
      same exact motorcycle parked right beside it.

      Unnerved, Scott gazes about, trying to spot the owners. But 
      all he sees are ordinary teenagers hurrying inside an 
      ordinary high school.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CORRIDOR - DAY2727

      Moving through the crowd, Stiles and Scott head to class.

                    You want to ask Derek for help?

                    He s got the triskele tattooed on 
                    his back. So there s got to be a 
                    way to do it without healing,

                    Doesn t he still have his hands a 
                    little full?

      Stiles gestures to a bulletin board where TWO MISSING PERSON 
      POSTERS hang side-by-side. BOYD and ERICA.

      A VOICE NEARBY catches their attention. Through the open door 
      of the Administration Offices, the former Principal hurls 
      orders at his SECRETARY, while unpacking his things.

                                  PRINCIPAL

                    the hell is this?

      The Principal lifts up a familiar-looking SWORD as Stiles 
      pulls Scott away from the door.

      Allison follows her gaze, trying to see the new student

      Gently lifting the bandage on Isaac s torso, Melissa looks 
      over the gash inflicted by an Alpha. The wound heals right 
      before her eyes, tissue miraculously binding back to tissue.

                                    MELISSA
                    Yeah, it s healing. Visibly. Wow.

                    I don t think that s going to 
                    matter. You re scheduled for 
                    surgery. Which is obviously going 
                    to be very confusing for a lot of

                    Since the amnesiac in 215 can t

                    the modified military stun gun in 
                    216 needs to answer some questions.

      He gestures to the other side of the hall where, through an 
      open door, the Girl lies visible in her bed.

                                    MELISSA
                    That s kind of unlikely since she s 
                    heavily sedated.

      But the Girl lies awake, gripping the removed IV in her fist 
      while listening to Stilinski give orders to his Deputy.

                    property damage to answer for. I 
                    don t want her going anywhere.

      The Girl glances to the beside clock--9:00 am. Returning her 
      eyes to the ceiling, she stares up with worry. The look of 
      someone who knows time is running out.

      A BELL RINGS--

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/ENGLISH CLASS - DAY3838

      The start of class. Lydia and Allison file in with other 
      students all quickly laying claim to desks for the semester. 
      Looking about, Allison finds only one empty seat remaining. 

      Right in front of Scott.

                                    ALLISON
                    Hey. Anyone sitting--

                    yours. Totally... vacant.

      She sits down and Scott glances over to Stiles who stares 
      back in disbelief at his friend s profound awkwardness. 

      But then a VIBRATING turns Scott to his cell phone on the 
      desk. It s an incoming message. In fact, EVERY PHONE in the 
      room begins buzzing, beeping and vibrating with messages.   TEEN WOLF "TATTOO" EP#301PINK11/14/1223.

      Scott raises his phone to look at the message when a 
      confident female VOICE begins to read it aloud.

                                  MS. BLAKE (O.S.)
                    The offing was barred by a black 
                    bank of clouds...

      Heels clicking across the floor as she enters the room, the 
      beautiful MS. JENNIFER BLAKE reads from her own cell phone.

                    the earth flowed somber under an 
                    overcast sky...

      Lowering her phone, she speaks the last line from memory.

                                  MS. BLAKE (CONT D)
                    ...seemed to lead into the heart of

                    That is the last line to the first

                    the last text you ll receive in 
                    this class. Phones off, everyone.

      While the others do as instructed, Scott hesitates, thumb 
      hovering over his phone s display. Then, finally, he powers 
      it down, screen going black.

      Turning the other way, she does not notice the particularly 
      attractive NURSE walking past.

      Vision blurring, Isaac peers down at the floor where he sees 
      the Nurse is BAREFOOT. Her toenails are long, sharp and 
      curved. Actually, more like claws.

      Realizing, Isaac tries to sit up. But now he can barely seem 
      to raise his head.

      Allison lowering her hand to pass him a note. He takes it, 
      unfolding the paper to read: Can we talk?

      Scott grabs his pen to write a reply when the classroom door 
      opens. The Principal steps in to speak with Ms. Blake.

                    I will. I swear it won t be 
                      ephemeral.

      He turns, leaving her looking slightly baffled by his choice 
      of words.

      INT. HOSPITAL/ISAAC S PATIENT ROOM - DAY4343

      Gently brushing a now unconscious Isaac's hair from his 
      forehead, the Nurse--whose actual name is KALI--steps away, 
      heading for the corridor.

      INT. HOSPITAL/CORRIDOR - DAY4444

      Kali slowly pushes open the door of the Girl s room. But a 
      look of disappointment falls over her. 

      Inside, the Deputy lies knocked out cold, his own handcuffs 
      latching his wrist to the bed rail. And the Girl is gone.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/ENGLISH CLASS - DAY4545

      While Ms. Blake continues her lecture, Stiles notices a 
      BANDAGE on Lydia s ankle. He leans over to whisper.

                    Lydia, what s that? Was that from

                    What if it s the same thing as the 
                    deer? Like how animals start acting 
                    weird right before an earthquake.

                    It s once, twice--

      THUMP. Something hits the window just over her shoulder. Loud 
      enough to turn Ms. Blake from the chalkboard. The students 
      watch her slowly approach to look out when--

      A BIRD SLAMS RIGHT INTO THE WINDOW.

      Blake flinches back, a hand coming to her mouth as if to 
      stifle a scream.

      ANOTHER BIRD FLIES into the window. Then a third. Dozens of 
      birds appear out of the sky almost instantaneously. They SLAM 
      violently into the glass, one after another.

      A CRACK ripples through the panes, causing students to rise 
      from their desks.

                    Get down. Everyone--

      GLASS SHATTERS as BIRDS SMASH through the windows, filling 
      the room in a spectacular frenzy.

      Students tumble out of chairs, desks clatter amid SCREAMS and 
      SHRIEKS of panic. Stiles grabs Lydia, pulling her down while 
      Ms. Blake draws students behind her desk.

      Finally, the flapping of wings and screeching subsides.   TEEN WOLF "TATTOO" EP#301PINK11/14/1227.

      gaze about at an utterly bizarre sight. Dozens upon dozens of 
      birds lying dead on the classroom floor.

      Scott rushes down the corridor with his mother, Melissa.

                                  SCOTT
                    Why didn t you tell me before?

                                    MELISSA
                    Honestly, I was hoping I wouldn t 
                    have to.

                      Everything you ve been doing. The 
                    extra reading, the summer school, 
                    saving up for the bike--even though 
                    it scares me to death. I don t want 
                    to break a good rhythm.

      He stops to look her in the eyes.

                                  SCOTT
                    It s not going to stop. I m going 
                    to be better this year. A better

                    friend. A better everything. I

                    surgery.

      Scott kisses her on the cheek and hurries around the corner, 
      never noticing--

      The Girl, still in her hospital gown, barefoot and limping. 
      She leans against the wall and peers down the corridor to 
      find too many people blocking the way to the EXIT. 

      Pushing off the wall, she turns back the other way.

      INT. HOSPITAL/OPERATING ROOM - DAY4747

      Under the glow of the operating room lights, Isaac lies 
      unconscious while the Surgical Team gets to work. Latex 
      gloved hands carefully reach down to remove the bandage.   TEEN WOLF "TATTOO" EP#301PINK11/14/1229.


      INT. HOSPITAL/ELEVATOR ALCOVE - DAY4848

      Scott slips inside the elevator and hits the button for the 
      second floor. 

      Glancing down, he sees a RED-TIPPED BLIND MAN S CANE tap its 
      way inside. Eyes hidden by dark glasses, the man raises a 
      tentative hand, feeling his way into the elevator.

                                  BLIND MAN
                    Could you hit the button for the 
                    second floor?

      Scott looks to the number 2 button already lit. But presses 
      it again anyway.

                                  BLIND MAN (CONT D)
                    Thank you.

      The doors close.

      INT. HOSPITAL/OPERATING ROOM - DAY4949

      The Surgical Assistant finishes removing Isaac s bandage and 
      pauses, staring down. Scalpel in hand, the Surgeon peers over 
      in confusion.

                                    SURGEON
                    What the hell is this?

      INT. HOSPITAL/2ND FLOOR ELEVATOR ALCOVE - DAY5050

      The doors open and Scott starts forward only to be blocked  
      by the Blind Man s cane. 

                                  BLIND MAN
                    You wouldn t mind helping me out 
                    for a second, would you?

                    Uh... sure.

      He takes Scott s arm and they begin a slow walk down the 
      corridor. Agonizingly slow.

      INT. HOSPITAL/OPERATING ROOM - DAY5151

      The Nurses and Technicians peer down at Isaac s perfectly 
      healed torso. Not a mark on him.   TEEN WOLF "TATTOO" EP#301PINK11/14/1230.

                    All right, I ve got an idea. How 
                    about we get him out of here and 
                    someone brings me a patient that 
                    actually needs to be operated on?

      The others nod quickly. An ORDERLY steps in to wheel Isaac 
      out. However, as the gurney is pushed forward, something odd 
      comes into focus--

      The Orderly's gloved hands appear to be perforated by the 
      tips of CLAWS.

      INT. HOSPITAL/CORRIDOR - DAY5252

      Pushing Isaac s gurney down the corridor, the Orderly tears 
      off a glove letting it fall to the floor. The second glove 
      drops down next to the dark and dirty boots underneath the 
      scrub pants.

      Finally, the surgical mask comes off to reveal the face of a 
      fearsome looking Alpha named ENNIS. 

      Grabbing a vacant wheelchair, he pulls it next to Isaac s 
      gurney.

      INT. HOSPITAL/ADJACENT CORRIDOR - DAY5353

      Quickly passing Nurses and other hospital personnel, Scott 
      throws nervous glances down each end of the hall, no idea 
      where to turn next.

      INT. HOSPITAL/ELEVATOR ALCOVE - DAY5454

      With Isaac now in the wheelchair, Ennis backs him into the 
      open elevator. But then, as if sensing something, Ennis 
      slowly looks up.

      Scott stands at the other end of the corridor. He sees Isaac. 
      Connects eyes with Ennis. And immediately knows.

      Scott s fist snaps open to reveal CLAWS. The transformation 
      instantaneous, fangs out, eyes GLOWING yellow, he launches 
      forward to attack.

      Grinning with anticipation, Ennis SNARLS a response. His 
      CLAWED HANDS come up in defense as--

      Scott hurtles down onto Ennis. But the larger werewolf easily 
      grabs hold of him and SLAMS him into the wall of the 
      elevator.   TEEN WOLF "TATTOO" EP#301PINK11/14/1231.

      CONTINUED:5555

      Still unconscious in the wheelchair, Isaac doesn t even stir 
      as the doors close with a DING, werewolves grappling right 
      beside him.

      But Scott is like a puppy attacking a Rottweiler. Ennis 
      smashes him from one wall to the next, knocking the breath 
      and nearly the life out of him.

      As the elevator ascends to the next floor, Ennis picks Scott 
      up by the throat, raising him until his head nearly touches 
      the ceiling.

      The elevator DINGS again, signaling the doors about to open 
      behind him.

                                  ENNIS
                    Don t you realize what you re 
                    dealing with? I m an Alpha.

      But Ennis lurches forward in shock as CLAWS JAM into his 
      back. His head twists around to face--

      DEREK HALE.

                                  DEREK
                    So am I.

      With his free hand, Derek smashes Ennis skull into the wall 
      and then--despite the larger Alpha s size--lifts Ennis off 
      his feet and HURLS him right out of the elevator.

      Ennis tumbles down the corridor past several shocked Hospital 
      Employees as--

      The elevator doors CLANG shut and Derek turns to Scott with a 
      look of concern.

      School officials, parents and EMT s attend to the shocked but 
      mostly unhurt students. Among them, Sheriff Stilinski surveys 
      the mess with a look of total bewilderment.

      Helping Lydia right her over-turned desk, Stiles notices Ms.

                    to being a teenager.

      Silent, Scott watches Derek tend to his Beta. When he starts 
      for the door, his eyes fall to his arm where the tattoo was.

                                  SCOTT
                    Derek. If you want to pay back the

                    There is something you can do for 
                    me.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CORRIDOR - DAY5858

      The door marked GIRL S LOCKER eases open and the Girl steps 
      out. Sliding a hoodie over her shoulders, she peers down the 
      corridor to find--

      Allison and Lydia gathering their things from their lockers, 
      preparing to leave.

      Allison shuts her locker and both girls start in surprise. 
      The Girl stands right in front of them, staring at Allison.

                                  GIRL
                    Where s Scott McCall?

                    He had to leave. He was supposed to 
                    be back in class but--

      The Girl grabs her by the wrist, a surprisingly tight grip.

                                  GIRL
                    Is he coming back?

                    Hey, ease up on the physicality, 
                      sweetheart.

      Lydia reaches to separate them but the Girl wraps a hand 
      around her wrist as well. Before she can say another word, 
      however, the Girl looks past them, noticing something.

      Through the crowd, the Twins watch her.

      Lydia and Allison follow her eyes, but the Twins disappear, 
      replaced by Argent heading for them. Noticing she s been let 
      go, Allison glances back to see the Girl hurrying off down 
      the hall.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    She bruised me.

      Lydia holds up her arm, showing an odd bruising on her skin. 
      Allison notices a similar bruise on her own arm.

      She gives a reluctant nod. With a gentle hand nudging them 
      forward, Argent guides the girls toward the school EXIT.

      Dr. Deaton reaches down to open the gate, allowing Stilinski 
      past the reception area and into the Clinic.

                    To be honest, I was going to call 
                    you with an incident of my own.

      Deaton pushes the door open for Stilinski.

                    Until I got a closer look and 
                    realized what actually happened...

      Stilinski gazes on the cat cages and the horrifying sight 
      inside. Twisted BODIES. Limbs stiff with rigor mortis. Claws 
      and fur matted with blood.

                    They did it to themselves.

      INT. HALE HOUSE - DAY6161

      Derek takes Scott s arm, inspecting it. For a brief second, 
      his eyes flare with a RED GLOW.

                    I don t know. It s just something I 
                    traced with my fingers.

      He presses his finger to a dust covered side table next to 
      him and traces a circle. Then with two fingers, he draws a 
      larger circle around the first.

                                  DEREK
                    Why s this so important to you?

      Scott lowers his eyes, as if trying to decide whether to 
      share this.

                                  SCOTT
                    Do you know what the word tattoo

                    That s in Tahitian. In Samoan it 
                    means  open wound. 

      Both Stiles and Derek look on him, surprised he knows so much 
      on the subject.

                    I knew I was going to get a tattoo

                    Like an open wound.

                                  STILES
                    Oh, my God.

      Getting on Scott s other side, Stiles reluctantly puts a hand 
      on his shoulder and arm, bracing to keep him seated.

      Derek slowly lowers the BLUE FLAME to Scott s shoulder. He 
      flinches immediately, teeth clenched as Stiles tries to keep 
      him still. But Scott s eyes GLOW YELLOW, surging in response 
      to the pain.

      Stiles tightens his grip. But it s too much for Scott. Fangs

      FADE IN:

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CORRIDOR - NIGHT6262

      A darkened, empty corridor. Scott steps forward. STRANGE 
      WHISPERS bounce off the walls. Shadows stretch across the 
      floor. He continues on, almost seeming to drift toward 
      something--

      BODIES. Several of them. Blood everywhere. Breath tightening 
      in his throat, he can see their faces now. Lydia, Stiles, 
      Allison, Melissa, Stilinski, Isaac, Argent. Even Derek.

      Someone steps next to him. He turns to Dr. Deaton who looks 
      on the bodies with a regretful shake of his head.

                                  SCOTT
                    Who did this?

                                  DEATON
                    An Alpha. One given far too much *

                    Who?

      Deaton nods to the end of the corridor where a creature seems 
      to almost bleed out of the shadows. A RED-EYED WEREWOLF 
      stepping into the moonlight.

      It s Scott. Snarling. Roaring. Racing toward his human self. 
      Charging in for the kill when--

      INT. HALE HOUSE - DAY6363

      Scott snaps awake, sucking in a breath. Drenched in sweat, he 
      peers up at Derek and Stiles. Then to his arm. Amid smoke 
      wafting up from his skin, the BLACK BANDS are there. It 
      worked.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/LOCKER ROOM - DAY6464

      The Girl stumbles into the shadowy locker room and slams the 
      door shut. She limps back, glancing about in desperation. 
      Pulling a BROOM from a corner, she snaps the head off and 
      whips it up to use as a weapon.

      INT. HALE HOUSE - DAY6565

      Slipping his shirt on, Scott prepares to leave with Stiles 
      while Derek returns to the still unconscious Isaac.   TEEN WOLF "TATTOO" EP#301PINK11/14/1240.

                      everything changes so fast.

                    You painted the door.

      Derek starts toward them, but stops when he hears CLAWS 
        UNSHEATHING.

      Stiles watches Scott raise his hand to the door, a clawed 
      index finger pressed to the new paint.

      Derek gives a last look, urging him to not go any further. 
      But Scott SLASHES at the door. Then slashes again.    TEEN WOLF "TATTOO" EP#301PINK11/14/1241.

      First with one clawed hand, then both, RED PAINT falling to 
      the floor in thin ribbons. Until finally, breathless, he 
      gazes on the pattern revealed...

      THE ALPHA PACK S TRISKELE.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/LOCKER ROOM - DAY6666

      Back pressed to one of the lockers, the Girl holds her breath 
      as she hears the door open. 

      But it s not just the Twins who step in. Kali s bare and 
      clawed feet follow behind them. Then Ennis s black boots.

      The Girl closes her eyes, trying to steady her breathing, 
      trying to control her fear. Eyes opening, she spins around to 
      attack--

      INT. HALE HOUSE - DAY6767

      Scott looks over the Alpha Triskele as he pieces it together.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/LOCKER ROOM - DAY6868

      Whirling the BROOM STICK about like a bo staff, the Girl 
      defends herself with every last breath she has.

      But the Alphas move far too fast, LASHING OUT with calculated 
      savagery, RED EYES seeming to come from every direction.

      Kali spins with a dancer s grace, her CLAWED FEET slashing at 
      the Girl. The broom stick clatters to the floor.

      INT. HALE HOUSE - DAY6969

      BLOOD spattered across her cheeks, the Girl s back hits the 
      lockers. She sinks to the floor while in front of her--

      SOMEONE uses a handkerchief to wipe blood from his hands. As 
      the others drift back, silhouetted figures in the shadows, 
      the Alpha known as DEUCALION reaches out, grasping for 
      something against the wall.

      a pocket and places them over his milky white cataract eyes.

      INT. HALE HOUSE - DAY7171

      Derek approaches, continuing to explain.

                                  DEREK
                    We know they took Erica and Boyd. 
                    Isaac, Peter and I have been trying 
                    to find them for the last four 
                    months.

                                  SCOTT
                    What if you do find them? How do *
                    you deal with an Alpha pack?

                                  DEREK
                    With all the help I can get.

                                  ISAAC (O.S.)
                    Where is she?

      All eyes turn to Isaac, wide awake and sitting up on the 
      table.

                                  ISAAC (CONT D)
                    Where s the girl?

      Derek, Scott and Stiles all share confused glances.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/LOCKER ROOM - DAY7272

      Blood at her lips, the Girl flinches back as Deucalion kneels 
      in front of her. He raises his hand to touch her face, gently 
      feeling the curves of her cheek.

                                  DEUCALION
                      Beautiful.

      His fingers trace over her lips, then to her tightly clenched 
      jawline.

                                  DEUCALION (CONT D)
                    But defiant, aren t you?

                                  GIRL
                          (speaking with difficulty)
                    Because I know something... I know 
                    you re afraid of him.

                                  DEUCALION
                    Of a teenage boy?

                                  GIRL
                    Of the man he ll become.

                                  DEUCALION
                          (with an amused smile)
                    I m aware of a certain potential *
                    threat. But then someone once *
                    taught me a very smart way to 
                    eliminate threat. Get someone else *
                    to do it for you.

      As she peers up at him with questioning eyes--

      INT. HALE HOUSE - NIGHT7373

      Stiles steps out the front door with a worried Scott 
      following. But when he pauses at the door, twilight sun 
      streaming in, he glances down at the tattoo on his arm with a 
      small smile of pride.

      Surprisingly, Derek puts a brotherly hand on his shoulder, 
      looking proud as well.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT7474

      The Girl blinks in realization.

      Her eyes focus on Deucalion s face, seeing the slightest 
      movement at his lips, a confirmation.   TEEN WOLF "TATTOO" EP#301PINK11/14/1244.

      CONTINUED:7474

      A RED GLARE flashes momentarily behind Deucalion s DARK 
      GLASSES. He LASHES out with his claws, a sudden and vicious 
      cut.

      Throat slashed, the Girl slumps down, cheek hitting the 
      cement floor of the locker room. Darkness creeping slowly in 
      around her, her eyes finally flutter closed.

      INT. ARGENT APARTMENT/ALLISON S ROOM - NIGHT7575*

      Lydia places a COLOR SWATCH against Allison s wall.

                                  LYDIA
                    This one. Perfect.

                                    ALLISON
                    I don t know. I m still thinking 
                    maybe a shade of blue.

      Allison places another SWATCH right next to Lydia s, each of 
      them holding up a color against the wall.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    Lydia, look.

      She glances to see Allison s expression. Then follows her 
      eyes. With their forearms almost touching, the BRUISES left *
      on their skin by the Girl connect into an unmistakable 
      pattern. 

      Two halves of a strange, knot-like SYMBOL.

      INT. UNKNOWN ROOM - NIGHT7676

      The same SYMBOL appears on a stone wall past which a dark, 
      cavernous room houses two frightened prisoners. A sliver of 
      light falling into the room illuminates their HANDS held 
      tightly together. One black, one white...

                                                                          FADE OUT:
