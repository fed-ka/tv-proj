      MISTER DREAD aims his blaster at SARAH JANE, CLYDE, RANI,
      OCEAN and MINTY. 

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Mister Dread - no!

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    Give me the activator discs.

      Clyde grabs the second disc from Sarah Jane.  (Now he has
      both).

      FX SHOT: Androvax's tongue flashes across his face.

                                      CLYDE
                    Never!

                                      OCEAN
                    He's an alien, too!

                                      SARAH JANE
                    We only want to save Androvax's
                    species. Why won't you help us?

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    The equilibrium must be maintained.

                                    RANI
                    What does that mean?

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    The Veil ship must not be taken
                    from the hyper-dimensional vault.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    And if it is?

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    The ship's star-drive engines will
                    disrupt the vault matrix. The
                      dimensional disturbance will tear
                    your planet apart.

                                      CLYDE
                    But my people will live again!

      And Clyde darts through the door.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Androvax!  No!

                                                                            CUT TO:SJA 4 Ep 4 Shooting Script 22/03/10   BBC 2010 CONFIDENTIAL page 2




      CLYDE runs for it as MISTER DREAD lurches through the
      kitchen doorway, aiming his blaster - and RANI knocks Mister
      Dread's arm - sending his aim wide.

      FX SHOT: Mister Dread's laser blast zaps a light fitting,
      as Clyde gets through the front door.

                                    RANI
                    That's not just Androvax - it's
                    Clyde, too!

                                                                            CUT TO:


      MISTER DREAD turns to go after Clyde - RANI grabs him, and
      is joined by SARAH JANE -

                                    RANI
                    If you incinerate Androvax you'll
                    kill Clyde!

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Did the Alliance of Shades program
                    you with any morals at all, Mister
                    Dread?  Or are you just a jobsworth
                    machine?

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    I am a remarkable machine, Miss
                    Smith.  And one hundred per cent
                    reliable.

      Mister Dread shakes Rani off his sleeve and walks out of
      the house - Sarah Jane and Rani follow.

      OCEAN and MINTY stand, semi-dazed in the kitchen doorway,
      watching...

                                      OCEAN
                    Wait 'til BURPSS hear about this!*

                                      MINTY
                    Didn't they say something about
                    Earth being destroyed?

                                      OCEAN
                    You're right.  Better call an
                      extraordinary meeting.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      SARAH JANE - clearly anxious behind the wheel as she waits
      for the lights to change.  RANI beside her, CLYDE in the
      back.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Androvax is desperate to save his
                    species before the viper poison
                    kills him.  But however good his
                      intentions, he's as dangerous as
                    he ever was.

                                    RANI
                    You were doing what you thought
                    was right.  We were trying to help
                    him.

                                      CLYDE
                    Some people you just can't help.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Well we're going to help Gita. 
                    He's taken her body because he
                    needs it to survive.  But we're
                    going to save her.

                                      CLYDE
                    And what about Androvax and his
                    people?

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Gita is Rani's mum.  And Earth is
                    our planet.  My people come first. 

      And in the other lane, a couple of cars ahead - the black
      Humber.  MISTER DREAD behind the wheel.

                                    RANI
                    Look.  There.  It's Mister Dread.

      As the lights turn to green.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Those old cars - they can conk out
                    just like that.

      And Sarah Jane fires the sonic lipstick at the Humber.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      GITA comes through a window.  It's a big room, a deserted,
      peeling, damp ward.  There are bed frames still, the
      occasional mattress.

      Gita winces with pain.  She's sweating.  The swamp viper
      toxin is catching up with Androvax.

      She leans against the wall.  Looks at the vault keys. 
      Still pulsing with light.

                                    GITA
                    It's close now.

      But Gita's eyes are heavy - as if she's losing
      consciousness.  And her eyes find an old, stained mirror
      on the wall -

      ANDROVAX staring back at her from the mirror.

      Gita screams.

      - And Gita's eyes snap open.  Like it was a dream.

      She checks the mirror again - Gita looks back at her now. 
      Gita wipes a hand across her brow.

                                      ANDROVAX*
                    I'm losing control of this body. 
                    No!  I will not fail!

      She looks at the pulsing vault keys again.

                                    GITA
                    Come on.  Not far now.

                                                                (CONTINUED)        SJA 4 Ep 4 PINKS 29/03/10   BBC 2010 CONFIDENTIAL page 7

      And she forces herself on.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      SARAH JANE, CLYDE and anxious RANI come through the front*
      doors.

                                      CLYDE
                    Androvax is after that vault and*
                    we still don't know where it is.*
                    This place is huge.  If we're going*
                    to find Gita, we should split up.*

                                    RANI
                    We've got to find her!  Before the*
                    Men in Black do - and before*
                    Androvax gets her into that vault!*

                                      SARAH JANE
                    All right.  But you two stay
                    together.  Be careful. 

                                      RANI*
                    Oh, mum - please be safe!*

      Sarah Jane reassures, but is firm.*

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Rani, it's going to be all right. *
                    But, remember - if you find your*
                    mum, don't go near her.  Even if
                    she says it's her - you can't
                    believe her.  Call me.  All right?

                                    RANI
                    Yes, I know.  I will.*

      And they separate.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      CLYDE and RANI moving through the corridors, cautious. 
      Whispering.  Rani is worried...

                    Maybe I should've told mum and
                    dad.

                                      CLYDE
                    What do you mean?

                                    RANI (CONT'D)
                    We thought it was funny, pretending*
                    we didn't know anything about
                    aliens.  Not much of a joke now,*
                    is it? What if I'd told them, Clyde? *
                    Maybe this wouldn't have happened.

      Clyde takes Rani's hand.  Tender.

                                      CLYDE
                    And maybe it wouldn't have made
                    any difference. I know Sarah Jane
                    doesn't believe in fate.  But I
                    reckon that time and the universe -
                    they're not random. Everything's
                    sort of tied together with these
                    invisible strings - like your mum
                    joining BURPSS and Ocean Waters
                    having that disc thing. 

                                    RANI
                    You mean if something's going to
                    happen, it's going to happen? 

      Clyde kind of notices for the first time that he's holding
      Rani's hand.

                                      CLYDE
                    Yeah. 
                          (suddenly awkward)
                    Well, some things, any way.  But
                    we're going to save your mum.  If
                    it's the universe against Clyde
                    Langer, then the universe had better
                    bring some mates.

      - And Rani suddenly grabs Clyde and yanks him behind cover. 
      She puts her finger to her lips.

      And they watch as a MAN IN BLACK walks past, gun out.

      Quietly they watch him pass by without seeing them - and
      then at the other end of the corridor, GITA comes into
      view.

                                    RANI
                    Oh, no! Mum!

      Gita sees the Man in Black and runs - but it's clear that
      she is weak.  The Man in Black pursues.

                                    RANI (CONT'D)
                          (to Clyde)
                    He'll kill her!

      And they go after the Man in Black.

                                                                            CUT TO:        SJA 4 Ep 4 PINKS 29/03/10   BBC 2010 CONFIDENTIAL page 9




      GITA rushes through the door into the disused physiotherapy
      room.  Some equipment still there, desks, wheeled screens,
      trollies etc but broken and unused in decades.  Plus piles
      of other stuff from around the asylum that was placed up
      in there for removal and never taken.

      Her eyes dart - desperate for somewhere to hide.

      A cloth wheeled screen.  Gita hides behind it -

      As the MAN IN BLACK comes through the door.

      He walks to the middle of the room - taking in the whole
      place with a steady sweep of his head.

      Then closes on the screen and pushes it out of the way,
      with one sweep of his hands - revealing Gita, who hisses
      like a reptile.

      FX SHOT: Androvax's tongue snaps out.

      And the Man in Black raises his weapon.

                                      RANI*
                    Hey!*

      And Clyde and Rani roll a medicine ball across the floor -
      which takes the Man in Black's feet from under him.

                                      CLYDE
                    Strike!  Oh, yes!

      As the Man in Black lands on his back.

                                    RANI
                    Mum!  Androvax!  Whatever!  This
                    way!  Quick!

      Gita runs after them.

      The Man in Black rolls over on the floor -

      FX SHOT: Fires.  But misses.

      Rani, Clyde and Gita are out of the door.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      CLYDE and RANI running with GITA.

      CLYDE and RANI burst into an old office, followed by GITA. 
      Clyde pushes the dusty desk up against the door.  And they
      catch their breath.  They talk in hushed voices.

                    We should be okay here for a bit.

      Rani eyes Gita - leaning against the wall on the other
      side of the room.  Panting and sweating.  Not in a good
      way.

                                    RANI
                    Are you going to be all right?

                    Of course not!  The swamp viper
                    venom is killing me!

                                    RANI
                    Then give me my mum!  Now!

                                    GITA
                    I need her.  To free my people. 

                                      CLYDE
                    You can't talk sense to him.  He's
                    twisted up worse than a bag of
                    snakes in a tumble dryer.  I'm
                    calling Sarah Jane.

      Clyde pulls out his mobile.

                                    RANI
                    No, Clyde.  Wait.  Just trust me,
                    okay?

      Clyde doesn't look happy about it.  But he puts the mobile
      away.  And Rani turns back to Gita.

                                    RANI (CONT'D)
                    I know how you feel, Androvax.  I
                    felt it earlier. Upset and angry,
                    and you want to save your people.
                    But I want my mum back.

      And for a moment - it really is Gita...

                                    GITA
                    Rani?

                                    RANI
                    Mum?

      Rani takes a step towards Gita.  Clyde grabs her arm.

                                      CLYDE
                    No, Rani.  It's a trick!

      FX SHOT: Androvax's tongue flashes across Gita's face. 

      Her eyes glitter with malevolence.

      Rani pulls away from Clyde's hold.  Takes a step towards
      Androvax.

                                    RANI
                    We all want to save the people we
                    love.  You don't need my mum.  You
                    can take me.

                                      CLYDE
                    No!

      Rani turns - stares at Clyde.

                                    RANI
                    I've got to save my mum.

      Androvax speaks through Gita -

                                      ANDROVAX*
                    Your body for hers?

                                    RANI
                    I'm younger than she is.  I'm
                    fitter.  Take me.

      Gita smiles.

                                      ANDROVAX*
                    You have a deal.

      FX SHOT: ANDROVAX emerges from Gita's body - and he's on
      the verge of collapse.

      Rani swings into action.

                                    RANI
                    Clyde!

      And as Clyde grabs Gita, Rani rams a wheeled desk into
      Androvax - pinning him against the wall.

                                    GITA
                    What - what's happening?  Clyde? 
                    Rani?

      And then she sees Androvax - pinned against the wall
      hissing, trying to reach Rani -

                                      ANDROVAX
                    Never mind your body!  I'll have
                    your blood!

                                    GITA
                    It's you!

      Rani is dodging Androvax's claws.

                                    RANI
                    Get her out of here!

      Clyde pushes the door barricade out of the way.  And dives
      out of there with Gita - and Rani steels herself, releases
      the wheeled desk and goes through the door after them.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      RANI, CLYDE and GITA

                                    RANI
                    Run!

      And they take off down the corridor.  Gita babbling, her
      brain struggling to get a hold -

                                    GITA
                    It's a dream, Gita.  It's just a
                    bad dream...  But at least you've
                    got your jeans on. This time...

      And they carry on running.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      SARAH JANE moves cautiously - and discovers the vault door.

      She scans it with her watch.

      From out of the shadows of a room behind her - MISTER DREAD
      emerges and grabs her arm (with his left hand).

                                      MISTER DREAD
                      Impressive, don't you agree?

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Mister Dread.  What happened, did
                    you call out the AA?  I suppose in
                    your case, that would be the
                    Androids' Association.

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    I have a Neuron X Series 5 Cyber-
                      processor, titranic endoskeleton
                    and a power cell that will maintain
                      electro-functions for five hundred
                    years.  My purpose is to hide the
                    existence of alien life from Earth
                    and guard the vault.  I am not
                      programmed for comedy.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    And from what I can see the last
                    time you were out and about I was
                    still in Hot Pants.  What happened?

                                      SARAH JANE (CONT'D)
                    Did the Alliance of Shades realize
                    you were doing such a bad job and
                    pull the plug?  Literally, in your
                    case.

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    The Alliance was disbanded. We
                    became guardians of the vault. 
                    But now we have been reactivated 
                    our other protocols remain intact.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    What does that mean?

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    You have alien technology.  It*
                    must be confiscated.  And you must*
                    be processed.

      And Mister Dread takes off his dark glasses.

      FX SHOT: Mister Dread's eyes are glowing balls of green
      energy.

      Sarah Jane looks away.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Sorry.

      As she grabs Mister Dread's hand that holds her arm, and
      twists it - disconnecting it from him.

                                      SARAH JANE (CONT'D)
                    Hands off!

      She runs.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      CLYDE, RANI and GITA come running to an intersection.

                                    RANI
                    Which way?

                                      CLYDE
                    The way out sounds good to me. 

                                    GITA
                    Oh, my dreams are never normally
                    as exciting as this.  Except when
                    George Clooney stops by for a cup
                    of tea.

                    Mum, this isn't a dream.

                                      CLYDE
                    It's the after-effects of Androvax. 
                    Got her all mixed up.

                                    RANI
                    You have to believe me, mum, because
                    we're in big trouble.  Really big
                    trouble.  That alien you saw at
                    Genetech - he's a Veil life form
                    and his name's Androvax.  The other
                    aliens were Judoon.  Me, Clyde,
                    Sarah Jane and Luke, we know all
                    about them.  We always have.  I'm
                    sorry we lied to you.

                                    GITA
                    You knew?  How?

                                      CLYDE
                    It's a long story and we don't
                    have time right now because Androvax
                    is after us and so are the Men in
                    Black.  Oh, and if we don't get a
                    move on the world's going to end.

                                    GITA
                    What?!

                                    RANI
                    Oh, don't worry.  We're used to
                    that.

      And then a MAN IN BLACK appears at the end of the corridor.

                                      CLYDE
                    Come on!

      But the Man in Black gives chase.

      Clyde, Rani and Gita make a turn and find themselves at a
      dead end.

                                    RANI
                    We're stuck!

      Clyde thinks fast.

                                      CLYDE
                    I guess that means it's up to me,
                    then.  Lightning Clyde Langer steps
                    up to the starting blocks.

                                    RANI
                    Be careful.

                                      CLYDE
                    Me?  Since when?

      And he runs back along the corridor - sees the Man in Black
      coming up to the intersection.

                                      CLYDE (CONT'D)
                    Oi!  Annie Android!

      And Clyde takes off down the corridor as the Man in Black
      gives chase.

      Rani leads Gita away.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      SARAH JANE dodges through a door.  Puts her back to it -
      clearly hiding from Mister Dread.

      She's in a deserted ward.  Old. Dirty.  Creepy.*

      Suddenly Sarah Jane realizes that Mister Dread's hand is
      still attached to her sleeve.

      FX SHOT: Close up - the fingers wriggling...*

      With a grimace of disgust she pulls the hand off and throws
      it back through the door.*

      Sarah Jane shuts the door again, leans against it.  Catching*
      her breath.

      And behind her - ANDROVAX's hand reaches for her.

      Sarah Jane catches Androvax's reflection in a mirror -*
      moves like lightning.

      There's an old mop lying against the wall.  Grabs it and
      makes him keep his distance  -

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Stay back!

      CLYDE runs down a corridor.  The MAN IN BLACK follows him.

      He turns a corner - the other MAN IN BLACK coming that
      way, too.

      He's going to be trapped.  Has to think fast.

      As both Men in Black close on him from either end of the
      corridor.

      Raising their weapons.

                    Okay.  Count of four - One!  Four!

      And Clyde throws himself through an open doorway -

                                                                            CUT TO:


      SLO-MO CLYDE leaping through the doorway as a brilliant
      PRAC green light bleaches out behind him, as he falls to
      the floor.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      CLYDE comes to the office doorway.  Tentative.  There's a
      whole lot of smoke - and lying on the floor, just a pair
      of dark glasses.

      Clyde tries them on.  Looks damn cool.

      SARAH JANE is still holding the mop defensively between
      her and ANDROVAX.  But Androvax is in pain and exhausted,
      leaning against the wall.  She lowers the mop a little,*
      but remains guarded.

                                      ANDROVAX
                    The venom is getting stronger. 
                    Every vein in my body is on fire.

                    Where's Gita?  What have you done
                    with her?

                                      ANDROVAX
                    The poison clouded my head. Her
                    brat of a daughter tricked me.

                    You shouldn't have taken Gita in
                    the first place.  I said I would
                    help you. But that didn't include
                    using my friends' bodies.

                                      ANDROVAX
                    And now what, Sarah Jane Smith? 
                    Will you still help me?  When the
                    re-birth of my civilization means
                    the end of yours?

      Sarah Jane is regretful.

                    You know I can't let that happen.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      FX SHOT: Mister Dread's hand scuttling along the floor -
      it's found him.

      FX SHOT: MISTER DREAD bends down, picks up the hand and re-
      attaches it. 

      As he does so he sees RANI and GITA turn into the corridor
      ahead of him.

      Rani jumps in front of Gita.

                                    RANI
                    Don't shoot!  It's not Androvax! 

      Mister Dread takes the scanning device from his pocket as
      he walks towards them.

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    Yes, the Veil energy has gone.

      Gita is fixated, somewhere between terrified and fascinated.

                                    GITA
                    Are you - are you an alien?

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    No, I'm an android.  And you are
                    my prisoners.

      FX SHOT: His eyes glow behind his glasses.  And Gita's
      eyes pop.

      But close by, around a corner -  CLYDE watches.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      ANDROVAX spasms with pain.  Weakening quickly now.  SARAH
      JANE watches, anxious and helpless, and torn.  She puts
      the mop aside.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Is there anything I can do?

                                      ANDROVAX
                    You heard what your Xylok said. 
                    Swamp vipers - they don't give you
                    any second chances.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    No, it doesn't seem like it.

                                      ANDROVAX
                    Oh, my people, Sarah Jane Smith,
                    if only you could have seen what
                    they had done.  The Gleaming Tower
                    of Tripolann - to watch the dawn
                    light of our blue sun shimmer on
                    it...  To hear our poetry, such
                    words that would fracture your
                    heart...  Our galleries of spectral
                    paint.  We had such beauty, Sarah
                    Jane Smith.  Such... humanity.

      Sarah Jane aches for him, but won't weaken.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    I'm sorry, Androvax.  To lose an
                    entire world like that.  I can't
                    imagine how it could feel.  To
                    have nothing and no-one left. 
                    Across the whole universe.

      Androvax's eyes fill with tears.

                                      ANDROVAX
                    You fill with rage.  Become a lost
                    avenger, destroyer of worlds.  The
                    lives I have taken are countless. 
                    It was my wrath against the universe
                    for destroying my planet, my people,
                    my children.

      Sarah Jane feels his grief.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    The universe sometimes does things
                    that we can't understand.  Things
                    that seem terrible, brutal and
                    savage.  Things that make us all
                    want to rage against it.  But it
                    doesn't listen, Androvax.  The
                    universe is terrible and beautiful
                    at the same time, in ways that we
                    can never hope to understand.  But
                    I know this, that out of all its
                      destruction something new and
                    wonderful is always born.

                                      ANDROVAX
                    Is that supposed to comfort me in
                    my failure and moment of death?

      Sarah Jane knows that he is dying now...

                                      SARAH JANE
                    I know you would have done anything
                    to save your species.  When the
                    Judoon were hunting you and you
                    took my body, I felt that grief
                    and rage boiling inside you.

                    What you did was futile and wrong. 
                    I thought you saw that now, that
                    you wanted redemption.  But you
                    were prepared to destroy Earth to
                    bring your people back. You haven't
                    learned a thing. *

      Androvax's eyes are heavy - he's slipping away.

                                      ANDROVAX
                    But now I will be among them again.

      And his eyes close.  His body slumps.

      Sarah Jane regards, saddened.  Turns to walk away.

      Androvax leaps at her,

      Sarah Jane senses - but too late.

      FX SHOT: Androvax takes Sarah Jane's body.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Hello again, old friend.

      FX SHOT: Androvax's tongue flashes across her face.

                                      SARAH JANE (CONT'D)
                    Now.  To see my people re-born.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      MISTER DREAD herds RANI and GITA into the base.

                                    RANI
                    What are you going to do with us?

                                    GITA
                    I've heard what aliens do to humans
                    when they get their sticky paws on
                    them.  It was in the Sunday papers. 
                    All that probing and implanting.

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    As an android I have no interest
                    in either probing or implanting. 
                    But I do have an interest in the
                    Veil.  He is weak.  He will soon
                    need another body to sustain him.

                                    RANI
                    You mean us?  You're using us as
                    bait?  No way!

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    Your approval is not required.

                    What if he gets to the vault first?

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    My associates will handle that.

      As Clyde appears behind him.  He's wearing the sunglasses
      on top of his head.

                                      CLYDE
                    No, mate. Your associates have
                    been Clydinated.

      And Clyde gives Mister Dread a shove - he falls right into
      the open casket.

      Rani moves fast, sliding the top closed, and she and Clyde
      slam the locks into place.  Mister Dread is trapped.

      Drops the glasses over his eyes.

                                      CLYDE (CONT'D)
                    Cool shades, though. 

                                    RANI
                    Quick!  We've got to find Sarah
                    Jane.

      Clyde leads Rani and Gita out of there.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      SARAH JANE comes to the vault.  Spreads her hands over it,
      lovingly.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Soon my brothers and sisters, soon
                    I will release you.  And our people
                    will live again among the stars. 
                    And for eternities to come you
                    shall worship my name as saviour
                    of our race.

      She takes the glowing discs from her pockets - as CLYDE,
      RANI and GITA run up.

                                    RANI
                    Sarah Jane.

      Quickly, Androvax switches to Sarah Jane mode.

                    I think we've got a few things to
                    talk about when this is all over,
                    Sarah, my darling.

                    something important to take care
                    of.

      Clyde notes the alien discs.

                                      CLYDE
                    What happened to Androvax?

                                      SARAH JANE
                    The swamp viper venom took him. 

                                    RANI
                    So why are we opening the vault?

                                      SARAH JANE
                    If we can just rescue two of his
                    people, the Veil species still
                    have a chance.

      She hands one of the discs to Clyde.

                                    RANI
                    So there's no need to start the
                      star-drive?

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Mister Smith can arrange for a
                    passing ship to take them to a new
                    planet.  Now, Clyde, use the
                    activator disc.

      Together they operate the keys - and the vault door swings
      open.  Red light spilling out.

      DMP: Beyond the vault door - a breath-taking sight: the
      vault is gigantic, and filled with spacecraft of all kinds,
      some of them wrecked.  Some intact.

      They all look on in amazement.  Gita's eyes are huge.

                    get them all in there?  This door

                    Jane found.  Remember?

      And Sarah Jane's eyes are fixed on one of the spacecraft.

                    There isn't much time!

      And she starts to go through the door - but spasms with

                    Somebody tell me I didn't just see

      Clyde still has weakened Sarah Jane in his arms, as fatigued
      Androvax hangs on to the vault door.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    If you start that ship's engines
                    the vault will be de-stabilized.

                    people. Their ship - it was always*
                    calling to me! Even when I crashed*
                    on Earth with the Judoon!*
                      Destruction and re-birth, Sarah*
                    Jane Smith.  It is the way of the
                    universe.

      Androvax slams the vault door behind him as he leaps inside.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    No!

      Clyde still has one of the discs in his hand.

                    He took the other gizmo!  We can't
                    get in there!

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Any minute he'll find that ship
                    and power up its engines.

                                    GITA
                    Is that it then?  We're all going
                    to die?

      Gita grabs Rani, hugs her tight.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    I realise all this is new to you,
                    Gita but there's one thing we never
                    do in this situation.  And that's
                    give up.

                                      CLYDE
                    Yeah.  But I really wish Luke was
                    here right now.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Well, Luke isn't here.  All we've
                    got is Mister Dread.

                                    RANI
                    This way!

      And she leads them at a run.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      FX SHOT: The Veil ship.  Through its window - ANDROVAX,
      weak but determined.  Starts bringing the ship's systems
      on-line.  And its engines burst into life.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      SARAH JANE, CLYDE, RANI and GITA have reached the door to
      the cellar steps.  And the asylum starts to shake. 
      Violently.

                                      CLYDE
                    Oh this is not good.

                    He's engaged the ship's engines. 
                    Come on!  We don't have much time!

                                                                            CUT TO:SJA 4 Ep 4 Shooting Script 22/03/10   BBC 2010 CONFIDENTIAL page 24




      SARAH JANE, CLYDE, RANI and GITA lurch into the base. 
      Everything around them shakes violently.

      Sarah Jane uses the sonic to open Mister Dread's casket.

      MISTER DREAD lies there as if he's gone to sleep.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Mister Dread!  We need your help!

      He doesn't move.

                                    RANI
                    What's wrong with him?

                                      CLYDE
                    It's like he's de-activated himself.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Well if he's de-activated, maybe
                    this will work.

      And Sarah Jane fires the sonic at him.

      Mister Dread jerks and spasms.

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    That hurt.

      Mister Dread sits up and gets out of the casket.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    I'm sorry, but we need you. 
                    Androvax has started his ship's
                    star drive.

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    And the vault matrix has been
                      compromised.  I did warn you. 
                    Earth will be destroyed in
                      approximately two minutes.

                                    GITA
                    Two minutes?!  Well, you've got to
                    do something!

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    The laws of hyper-dimensional
                    physics cannot be changed.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Then use them, Mister Dread.  The
                    transmat equipment.  That's how
                    you put all those ships in there,
                    isn't it?

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    Yes.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Then you can use it to beam that
                    Veil ship out of there and into
                    space.

                                      MISTER DREAD
                      Theoretically.  But this equipment
                    was all deactivated in 1972.  There
                    is no power source.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Yes there is.  You.  You've got a
                    power cell that will keep you
                    running for five hundred years.

      Around them the shaking is getting worse.  Gita wraps her
      arms around Rani as debris and dust falls.

                                    GITA
                    Oh.  Haresh.

                                    RANI
                    It'll be all right, mum.  I promise.

                                    GITA
                    I love you, Rani.  Just always
                    thought your dad would be here -
                    you know - at the end. 

      And Clyde sees this, and is angry at Mister Dread.

                                      CLYDE
                    Come on, Mister Dread.  If you've
                    always been here to protect Earth
                    from alien stuff now's the time to
                    really get stuck in.  None of this
                    would be happening if it wasn't
                    for you. 

                                    RANI
                    Clyde's right. We didn't ask you
                    to come and brush all those alien
                    ships under the carpet.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    You have to stop this.  Now!

      Mister Dread fixes Sarah Jane with a look.

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    I want you to know.  This is not
                    in my job description.

      And Mister Dread walks over to the equipment.  Removes his
      left hand and plugs it in.  The instruments immediately
      start lighting up.

                                    RANI
                    It's working.

      But around them the place is still falling apart.

                                      CLYDE
                    Hurry up, Mister Dread.  I don't
                    think we've got much time.

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    Scanning the vault.  Locking on. 
                    Setting coordinates.

      Mister Dread gasps.

                                      MISTER DREAD (CONT'D)
                    Powering trans-matter equalizer.

      He gasps again.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    The system is draining him.

      Mister Dread slumps a little over the equipment, as the
      place continues to shake around them.

      He throws some switches

                    Transmat energizing.*

                                                                            CUT TO:


      FX SHOT: The Veil ship glows and vanishes.

      And suddenly everything is still.

      SARAH JANE, CLYDE, RANI and GITA look about them in the
      silence.  Can hardly believe it's over.

                                    GITA
                    We did it!  We did it!  We saved
                    the world!

      And she is hugging everyone, dancing for joy.

      Sarah Jane smiles, and looks at Mister Dread.  He is
      unplugging himself from the equipment.  Re-fixing his hand. 
      Clearly weakened.

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    I need a holiday.

                    power used in two minutes.

                                      CLYDE
                    Can you re-charge?

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    It's unnecessary.  Without the
                    second activator disc the vault
                    can never be opened again.  The
                      hyper-dimensional link has been
                    severed. My mission is terminated.

      And Gita is buzzing.

                                    GITA
                    Oh, Rani, wait until your father
                    hears all about this!  Wait until
                    Ocean hears.  Oh, my darlings -
                    we'll be on the news!  All around
                    the world!

                                    RANI
                    No, mum.  That's not the way it
                    works.

                                    GITA
                    Don't be silly, my darling.  We
                    just saved Earth.  I'll be on
                      Newsnight!  Haresh'll be so jealous -
                    I've got a thing for Jeremy Paxman.

      Rani looks at Sarah Jane, feeling helpless.  Sarah Jane
      looks at Clyde - who just shrugs.  What are they going to
      do?

                                    GITA (CONT'D)

                    Mister Dread, could I ask for one

      Mister Dread steps forward.
