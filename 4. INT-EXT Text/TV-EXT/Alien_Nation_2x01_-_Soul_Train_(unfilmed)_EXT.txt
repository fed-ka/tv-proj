      Sikes' car barrels down the street, passing a billboard for 
      NU-SHEEN -- Newcomer spot enhancer.

      INSIDE THE CAR

      Sikes drives. Cathy sits next to him, looking anxiously out 
      the window. Suddenly, Sikes brakes.

      HIS POV - A NEWCOMER MAN

      Dressed in a suit, walks aimlessly in the middle of the 
      street, directly in Sikes' path.

      Sikes hits the horn.

                                  SIKES
                    Hey! Move it!

      The Newcomer man stops, staring blankly at the car.

      SIKES

      Turns the wheel to go around him.

      SIKES' CAR circumventing the man, continuing down the 
      street.


      A sign reads: A DUAL HUMAN/NEWCOMER HEALTH CARE FACILITY.

      Sikes' car SCREECHES to a stop. Sikes and Cathy leap out.

                                  CATHY (pointing)
                    The Newcomer wing is over here.

      Following Cathy, Sikes rushes toward the building.


      George and Sikes walk down the dock together.                                  SIKES
                    Floyd Norell and his wife are weekend 
                    sailors. Parris looked after their boat 
                    when they weren't there.

      George pauses. Sikes notices he is troubled.

                                  SIKES
                    What?

                                  GEORGE
                    When we were here last, you mentioned 
                    putting in for a new partner.

                                  SIKES
                    Yeah... I guess I did...

                                  GEORGE
                    So... have you?

                                  SIKES
                    No.

                                  GEORGE
                    Oh.

                    George, I was being really stupid.

                                  GEORGE
                    No. It was me - I was acting like some big 
                    head pancho.

                    Matt, I don't want you to change partners.

                                  SIKES
                    Me neither, George.

      George offers a conciliatory handshake. Grinning, Sikes 
      pulls George into a hug, then claps him on the back.                                  SIKES
                    Okay, Pancho, let's get back to work.

      They continue on to a thirty-five foot sailboat. Floyd 
      Norell, mid-forties, weathered, stands on the dock, 
      scrubbing the deck of his boat. Sikes flashes his shield.

                                  SIKES
                    Mr Norell. I'm Detective Sikes - this is my

                    This is about Rick Parris, isn't it? I 
                    can't believe what I've been reading.

                                  GEORGE
                    Did Mr Parris have many visitors?

                                  NORELL
                    None that I saw. He was kind of a loner, I 
                    guess.

                                  SIKES
                    Did he ever speak to you about any 
                      friends... associates..... political ties?

                                  NORELL
                    No. We mostly talked about sailing - 
                    sailing and wine.
                            (smiles)
                    He loved good wine.
                            (shakes head)
                    This is a real shock - I thought I know the 
                    man. We were very friendly - he used to 
                    keep an eye on the boat - I trusted him.

      George cocks his head, listening to something.

                                  GEORGE
                    Did Mr Parris spend time on your boat?

                                  NORELL
                    He could have - he had the run of it during 
                    the week.                                  GEORGE (to Sikes)
                    Parris' phone records showed no 
                      incriminating calls. Perhaps he used Mr 
                    Norell's phone.

                                  SIKES
                    How do you know he's got a phone?

                                  GEORGE
                    Mr Norell's wife is on it right now.

      Sikes looks toward the boat, but there is no sign of Mrs 
      Norell. George taps his ear then points back at the boat.

      THEIR POV - MRS NORELL

      Comes topside, a portable phone to her ear.

                                  MRS NORELL (into phone)
                    No, Bob, let's buy five hundred shares. 
                    Look what happened with Omco - we were 
                    kicking ourselves we didn't buy more when 
                    it was still eighteen and a half.

                    Ten-four, dispatch.


      Two unmarked police cars and a black and white pull 
      silently up. Sikes and George get out of the first car, 
      followed by Zepeda and her partner. Two uniformed cops get 
      out of the black and white. All draw their guns. Sikes 
      signals Zepeda and her partner to take the back while he 
      and George go in the front. The uniformed cops remain 
      outside.

      Sikes and George flank the front door. George gives Sikes a 
      nod. Testing the door, Sikes finds it open. He and George 
      exchange a look, then cautiously enter.


      To ESTABLISH. A Newcomer gardener, suffering from the 
      PAPAYELA, slowly waves his electric clippers over a hedge,       never touching it.


      Sikes and George's car pulls up outside an old funky 
      trailer.

      INSIDE THE TRAILER

      Max Julian looking out the kitchen window, sees George and 
      Sikes get out of their car. Moving from the window, he 
      opens a cabinet.

      INSIDE THE CABINET

      A timer wired to plastique, Max sets the digital display 
      for three minutes. Max grabs an onion and hurriedly 
      chopping it.

      OUTSIDE

      Sikes and George approach the trailer.

      INSIDE

      Max pours olive oil into a heating skillet. There's a KNOCK       at the door.

                                  SIKES (O.S.)
                    Max?

                                  MAX
                    Hold on!

      Hurriedly throwing the onions into the skillet, he gives 
      them a turn with a spatula.

                                  MAX
                    I'm coming.

      The onions SIZZLE as Max goes to open the door.

                                  MAX (cheery)
                    Hey, guys, I'm off duty. Hope this is a 
                    social call.

      Sikes and George step into the trailer.

                    It's not.

      George recoils from the smell of onions.

                    Sorry, I'm making spaghetti sauce.

                    You heard me. And you're not going 
                    anywhere.

      Max checks his watch, considering what to do next.

                                  GEORGE
                    The Kentex that killed Parris came from a

                                  MAX (aghast)
                    What? Hey, look, don't tell anybody until I 
                    recheck my data - I gotta reputation,

      George sniffs the air, puzzled. Noticing, Max moves to the 
      stove and stirs the onions.

      He reaches for some as George sniffs again.

                                  GEORGE (realising)
                    He's cooking to cover the odour - nitro

      George grabs the skillet and hurls it out the window. 
      Sniffing the air, he rushes to the cabinet and yanks it 
      open.

      Sikes and George grab Max. Struggling, they heave him 
      through the door, then jump out after him.      OUTSIDE

      Sikes and George drag Max away from the trailer.

      The trailer EXPLODES behind them. Sikes and George hit the

      Just outside the gated airfield, Darlene Bryant stands by 
      her limousine with Marc Guerin who wears a flight jacket. 
      Her bodyguard/driver stands a few feet away.

                    God be with you.

      She kisses him on each cheek, then nods to her driver. He 
      opens the door for her. She gets in, and they dive off.

      TRACKING - GUERIN as he enters the airfield and crosses to 
      his helicopter. Two technicians from the warehouse 
      laboratory are hurriedly replacing Malathion canisters with 
      those holding bacteria. Guerin begins his pre-flight check.

      Guerin turns to see his supervisor jogging toward the       helicopter.

                    Something else -- this came from LAPD.

      Turning he jogs away. The technicians look at Guerin.

                                  GUERIN
                    Go.

      The technicians back off and away as Guerin climbs into the 
      cockpit.

      INSIDE THE CHOPPER

      Guerin checks his oil pressure and sets his altimeter. He 
      turns the ignition switch. THE CHOPPER SPUTTERS to life, 
      its blades starting to rotate. Behind it, Sikes and 
      George's car ROARS onto the airfield.

      INSIDE THE CHOPPER

      Guerin sees the car heading toward him. It circles in front 
      of the chopper, SCREECHING to a stop. Sikes and George leap 
      from the car as the chopper's blades reach lift-off speed. 
      Sikes and George raise their guns.                                  SIKES
                    Police! Halt!

      ON GUERIN

      Sikes' command is inaudible above the chopper's DIN, but 
      the intent is clear. Pulling a gun, Guerin FIRES at the 
      officers. Then he pushes on the stick. Sikes and George 
      dive for the tarmac, returning FIRE as the chopper begins 
      to rise.

      Guerin wounded, drops his gun. Grimacing, he continues to 
      push forward on the stick. The chopper turning, continues 
      to rise. Jumping up, George grabs hold of the strut, 
      lifting himself.

                                  SIKES
                    George!

      Guerin feeling the drag, looks behind and sees George. He 
      hits a lever and THE CANISTERS spew the deadly bacteria. 
      George catches the spray full in the face.

      CLOSE - Sikes reacts with horror.

      WIDE - George drops twenty feet to the tarmac. Sikes 
      empties his gun as the chopper gains altitude.

      The CHOPPER, it's fuel line hit, EXPLODES.

      Sikes rushes to shield George with his body. Flaming debris 
      falls around them.

                                  GEORGE (weak)
                    We did it... we did it.

                                  SIKES (panicked)
                    The bacteria, George...
                            (lifting him)
                    It's gonna be okay... It's gonna be okay. 
                    We'll get you to the hospital.

      They struggle back toward the car.


      Darlene Bryant, in high spirits, exits with a few well-
      healed friends.                                  BRYANT
                    Don't talk to me about computers! I had a

      INT HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

      George has been given Emily's bed next to Susan. Sikes 
      watches Dr Quinn examine George while Cathy draws a blood 
      sample.

      Sikes moves to his side.

      George looks over at his wife.

      George starts to close his eyes.

      George opens his eyes and looks at Sikes.

                    My friend... my dear friend...

      He drops into unconsciousness. Cathy finishes taking 
      George's blood sample. She and Dr Quinn move to the corner 
      to confer. Sikes follows them.

                                  QUINN

                    going through "NEESTAS"! Puberty! She's 
                    going through puberty.

      Cathy, followed by Quinn, rushes off, leaving Sikes still 
      trying to figure it out.

      INT SECURITY WING CORRIDOR - NIGHT

      Emily sits next to Buck who holds Vessna. They wait 
      anxiously. Sikes paces in front of them.

                                  EMILY

      worried about US." He looks down at the plant, discovering 
      a dead leaf.
