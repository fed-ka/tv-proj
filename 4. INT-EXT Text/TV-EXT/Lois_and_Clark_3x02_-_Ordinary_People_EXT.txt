     It pulls away from the building with a horrible GROAN.  Lois
     can only stare upwards, frozen, dropping phone.  The

     The boat pulls up and the aging Captain helps Lois and

                        (glances up at her)
                    Did you wanna leave?                              (X)

                                     LOIS
                        (working away)                                (X)
                    I...suppose I could stick it out
                    for one night.                                    (X)

     She sneaks a glance at him, then notices a wisp of smoke 
     rising from the wood.

                                     LOIS (CONT'D)
                    Quick, add some dried leaves! 
                    Okay... blow!

     Clark blows a short blast of super breath, which kicks up 
     the dirt all around Lois.

                                     LOIS (CONT'D)
                        (wiping dust out of her eyes)
                    One more time, and remember it's a
                    campfire, not a nuclear reactor.

     He blows gingerly.

                                     LOIS (CONT'D)
                    Harder
                        (he blows)
                    More leaves.
                        (adds leaves)
                    Faster!
                        (more blowing)
                    Not so fast!

     Clark is gamely trying to cooperate and finally Lois bursts 
     out laughing at their predicament.

                                     CLARK
                    What's so funny?

                                     LOIS
                    This is exactly what I thought
                    camping with Clark would be like!

                                     CLARK
                    Lois, you are camping with Clark,
                    remember?

     And suddenly the little leaf pile catches fire.

                                     LOIS
                    Oh!  Oh!  We did it!  Boy, why 
                    don't we have any hot dogs on 
                    sticks?

     Clark reaches around to grab something.

                                     CLARK
                    Next best thing.

     And he impales a banana on a stick, holds it over the fire, 
     as she sighs, begins to smile, we

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:



     The peels are scattered on the ground with the roasting 
     sticks.

     TILT UP to find a CRACKLING fire, and Lois and Clark, 
     clothes from their suitcase spread under them for a bed, 
     snuggled in each other's arms, staring at the fire.

                                     LOIS
                    You know, I dreamed of this?  Of 
                    spending the night this close to 
                    you?
                        (smiles up at him)
                    I mean, first it was Superman I 
                    dreamed of.  But then... it was 
                    Clark.

                                     CLARK
                    What happened?

                                     LOIS
                    Well, I'd be in your arms....                     (X)
                        (he holds her closer)
                    We'd kiss...
                        (they do)
                    And....

                        (a little timid;

                    And you'd tell me how you felt                    (X)
                    about me.

                                     CLARK
                    I don't know how I feel about you.

                    She's a bit taken aback.

                                     CLARK (CONT'D)
                    There's no one way I feel.  I feel
                    so many things.  And all at once...
                    Happy but kinda scared... Excited..
                    calm. Lost... found.  Safe in a
                    way I've never known, but in
                    danger, too.  This thing with us,
                    whatever it is... is stronger than
                    me.  Being with you is stronger
                    than me alone.  That's new for me.

     She is staring up at him, very moved by this. She gently
     reaches up touches his cheek, and he kisses her.  It's
     tender at first, then, as things heat up:



     Black boots into which are bloused black jumpsuits.  TILT UP
     to find Klavel and Belzer, wearing goggles to which are
     attached tiny, powerful spotlights.  They carry automatic
     weapons and make their way through the steaming jungle,
     finally approach a clearing up ahead.

                                     BELZER
                    There they are.


 63  LOIS AND CLARK                                                 63   

     They're kissing as the muzzles of the guns enter FRAME.

                                     BELZER (O.S.)
                    On your feet.

     Lois and Clark dive apart and stare up.  Clark stifles his
     impulse to leap up when he looks over and finds the gun
     aimed at Lois.

     FADE IN:


     Superman, holding flowers, floats down into f.g., some
     distance from window, unnoticed by Lois.  He hovers, as:

                                     LOIS
                    Well, it's been a little hectic,
                    Chief.
                        (beat)
                    But that other side of him I
                    mentioned?  I ... decided it's
                    something I could put up with.

     Superman smiles.

                                     LOIS (CONT'D)
                    G'night, Perry.

     Superman flies in through Lois' window. She turns, and:

                        SUPERMAN
                    I was out...                                      (X)
                        (flying hand motion)
                    And just... wondered how you were.                (X)

                    Down the street.  Tony's.  Paid

     He makes the flying hand motion, she nods, he turns and          (X)

     away, smiling, and, for the moment, at peace.
