      She tries to get reception.  But then, interference over

      Beside Ed, MIA BENNETT - 28, born optimist - steps in,

                    We come all this way.  To an empty

                    and what do we do?  Put up cheap

                    second and chat third.  I think. 
                    Gun, head, chat, yeah.  I hate
                    lists.  But you could hurt someone
                    with that thing, just put it down.

                                      ADELAIDE
                    Oh you'd like that.

                    Because I give you my word.  And
                    forty million miles away from home,
                    my word is all you've got.

      Pause.  She looks at him; somehow, she does trust him.  A

      YURI on comms.  The Med-dome has got a classic "Alien"
      isolation room; big, strong metal door, with a wide window,
      looking into a white, sterile room, with a medical couch
      centre.  On which MAGGIE's lying, now propping herself up
      on one arm, awake, dazed, with an 'owww'.

      cascading.  Water just flowing off him.

      And only now, he turns round...

      Sees Maggie.

      She sits there, unmoving, staring.  Transformed.  Her mouth *
      is a mass of cracked veins, though eyes are clear.  Hair *
      slicked back; because it's wet, the whole of her is wet. 

      And Maggie is grinning.  Her teeth and tongue are black. 
      Water flowing from her open mouth. NB, the room doesn't
      slowly flood, despite the flow; it's as if the water goes
      round her in a cycle, into her clothes, absorbed back up.

      WATER is pouring from Andy's hand, over Tarak, who's

      Tarak has been kneeling upright, now sits back.  Head down.

                  The

                    There now, that's better.  So. 
                    You must be Andy.  Hello.

      But then Tarak jerks his head upright - eyes open -

      Eyes cloudy.  Face & hair wet, water pouring from his
        cracked-vein mouth, never stopping.

      Adelaide still aiming her gun.  Determined.  But... 

      Crucial moment: she cannot do it.  The Doctor, gentle:

                    Adelaide.  We've got to go.

      Then she turns - she's running - !  The Doctor too -

      - and Andy runs!  Fierce, hard running - Tarak's on his
      feet, running, like an athlete -

      - the Doctor & Adelaide belt through the Dome -

      - Andy and Tarak following, faster and faster -

      - the Doctor and Adelaide reach the entrance-area, belt
      towards the airlock - run inside -

      Andy & Tarak reach the entrance-area, still a good distance
      back - but they suddenly STOP -

      - the Doctor is hauling on the door, Adelaide inside the
      airlock, slamming buttons -

      - the Doctor swinging the heavy door, slo-o-o-w-l-y -

      - as Andy raises one arm.  Aims it, straight.  Like a gun.

      PRAC FX: a FIERCE BLAST OF WATER CANNONS OUT OF HIS ARM -

      the glass panel in the door - the water cannon stops, glass
      clearing to reveal Andy and Tarak now walking towards them -

      ED runs in - YURI's standing back, terrified -

      MAGGIE is now at the glass window.  Her hands on the glass,
      fingers splayed, and water is pouring from her hands, down
      the glass.  Again, not shooting out; a constant stream.

                    What the hell..?

      CUT TO the Bio-Dome side of the door: Andy's reaching up,
      grabbing hold of the entire airlock frame.  Water pouring
      out faster, from his hands.  TARAK joins him.  Kneels. 

      FX: WATER jets out of Tarak's mouth, strong, hitting the

                    No, just basic.

                    I don't know.  She was talking
                    before I noticed the change, but...

                    know who I am?  Your Commanding
                    Officer.  Captain Adelaide Brooke.

      Maggie just slowly tilts her head from side to side, as
                  The 
      though inspecting Adelaide.  Water flowing from her mouth.

                                      ADELAIDE (CONT'D)
                    Can you tell me what happened? 
                    Margaret Cain.  I demand a report.

      Maggie lowers her hands.  Tilts her head at the Doctor, an
      even wider smile.  She liked that.

                    The ice field.  That's why we chose

                    Look at her mouth.  All blackened. 
                    Like there's some sort of fission.

                    water, but look at her, the water
                    never stops.  This thing, whatever
                    it is, it doesn't just hide in
                    water, it creates water.

      Suddenly, Maggie talks, calm and grave, a deep, gurgling
      voice, water still flowing from her mouth (if possible):

                    The Flood will rise.  And the waters

                    She was looking at the screen.  At

      He marches into a SECOND COMPARTMENT in sickbay; a smaller
      room, so Maggie can't hear.  ADELAIDE follows - the Doctor
      not joining them, but staying nearby, listening -

                    Imagine it, Adelaide.  If you began
                    a journey that takes the human
                    race all the way out to the stars. 
                    Imagine, it begins with you, and
                    then your granddaughter.  You
                  The 
                    inspire her.  So that in thirty
                    years' time, Susie Fontana Brooke
                    is the pilot of the first lightspeed
                    ship to Proxima Centauri.  And
                    then everywhere!  With her children,
                    and her children's children, forging
                    the way, to the Dragon Star, the
                    Celestial Belt of the Winter Queen,
                    the Map of the Water Snake Wormholes -
                    one day a Brooke will even fall in
                    love with a Tandonian prince, and
                    that's the start of a whole new
                    species.  But everything starts
                    with you, Adelaide.  From 50 years
                    ago, to right here, today.  Imagine.

      Mia.  Slamming Protein-packs on to a trolley.

      Steffi.  Shoving a trolley out towards the Corridor.

      Roman.  Circling round, staring up at the roof.

      Yuri.  Hauling Protein-packs out of the wall.

      All of them trying so hard.

      All about to die.

      He's got to.

      He goes to the outer door.  Presses the sequence of buttons.

      She's just crying at first.  Can't run, can't dodge, can't

      Shudder.

      Convulsing.

      Thrashes; the most violent of this seen from outside,

                    Yes, because there are Laws, there
                    are Laws of Time, and once upon a
                    time, there were people, in charge
                    of those Laws, but they died, they
                    all died, and d'you know who that
                    leaves?  Me!  It's taken me all
                    these years to realise.  The Laws
                    of Time are mine.  And they will
