          FADE IN:


  11INT. SMITH HOUSE - DAY

          Johnny's eating breakfast, glancing through the morning
          paper, the TV on in the background.

                                        STERN NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
                        Local law enforcement remains on
                        high alert after an article in
                        today's Boston Telegraph published
                        an internal White House list of
                        the U.S. locations most vulnerable
                        to a terrorist attack.  Maine's
                        Durgham Point oil refinery is
                        among the sites listed --

          Sick of bad news, he punches the remote.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not for breakfast.

          A few WEATHER STATIONS, an INFO-MERCIAL and then GREG
          STILLSON being interviewed leaving a meeting somewhere...

                                        REPORTER (ON TV)
                          Congressman, what do you think of
                        the article in today's paper
                        concerning Homeland Security?

                                        STILLSON (ON TV)
                        It's obvious that this country
                        needs to refocus its attention
                        and resources inward in respect
                        to Global terrorism, but this
                        isn't the way to do it.  Whoever
                        leaked this report should be
                        brought to face federal charges.

                                        REPORTER (ON TV)
                        What kind of charges?

                                        STILLSON (ON TV)
                        Treason would be a good place to
                        start.

                                        REPORTER (ON TV)
                          Switching gears just a bit, how
                        are your wedding plans coming?


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Forbidden Fruit" - TEASER - 9/10/05 - YELLOW  2.


    1CONTINUED:1

                                        STILLSON (ON TV)
                        Well, I'm a politician, so I know
                        how to delegate authority.  I've
                        left the important decisions to
                        my better half.  It's safe to
                        say, it's going to be the happiest
                        day of my life.

          Stillson smiles into the camera and moves on, as the
          television is shut off.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to himself)
                        This is really going to happen.

          He tosses the cereal bowl into the sink and hurries out...


  22EXT.  BRIDAL BOUTIQUE - DAY

          A dark Mercedes sedan pulls to the curb.  The Driver gets
          out and opens the back door, as MIRANDA ELLIS emerges
          wearing dark sunglasses, looking very Jackie Kennedy. 
          She looks around, clearly feeling like she's being watched.


  33INT. ND VEHICLE - CONTINUOUS

          Parked across the street.  An UNIDENTIFIED MAN watches
          Miranda from a distance, as he clicks SURVEILLANCE
            PHOTOGRAPHS...


  44TIGHT ON MIRANDA - SERIES OF CANDID PHOTOS - FREEZE
          FRAMES

          Of Miranda as she exits the car, looks around and then
          enters the dress shop.


  55INT. ND VEHICLE - CONTINUOUS

          Janus' SECURITY MAN (established in "SAVED") sets the
          camera down on the seat beside him as we see he's also
          carrying a gun. 


  66INT.  BRIDAL BOUTIQUE - MINUTES LATER

          In the PRIVATE DRESSING AREA in back of the store.  A
          SALESWOMAN hovers nearby as the shop PHONE RINGS.  The
          saleswoman disappears into the shop as Miranda steps out. 
          She looks stunning in the traditional white dress as she
          looks at herself in a large 3-way mirror.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Forbidden Fruit" - TEASER - 9/12/05 - GREEN  3.


    6CONTINUED:6

                                        MIRANDA
                        Francesca, I think we need to
                        take it in another inch, don't
                        you?

                                        JOHNNY (O.C.)
                        I think it looks perfect.

          Three reflections of Johnny Smith appear in the mirror as
          he steps up behind her.  She's both surprised and concerned
          to see him. 

                                        MIRANDA
                        Johnny?  What are you doing here?

          Johnny closes the dressing room door and locks it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I came to see you.

          She seems torn, happy to see him, but frightened.

                                        MIRANDA
                        You shouldn't have come here. 
                        I'm getting married in less than
                        36 hours.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, I saw your future husband
                        on television.  He's almost as
                        good an actor as you are.

                                        SALESWOMAN (O.C. THROUGH DOOR)
                        Miss Ellis?  Is everything alright?

                                        MIRANDA
                        Just a minute! 
                                (to Johnny)
                        You have to go.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Say it.

                                        MIRANDA
                        What?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Tell me that you love Greg
                          Stillson.  Say the words and I'll
                        walk away.

                                        MIRANDA
                        Johnny, please...



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Forbidden Fruit" - TEASER - 9/12/05 - GREEN  4.


  6CONTINUED: (2)6

                                        JOHNNY
                        What are afraid of?  It's just
                        the two us.  You can be honest.

          Her eyes fill with tears, then...

                                        MIRANDA
                        I love Greg Stillson.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (beat)
                        I was wrong.  You're a much better
                        actor.

                                        MIRANDA
                        You don't understand...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw you make the deal to protect
                        me.

          She seems surprised to hear it.

                                        MIRANDA
                        Then you know why I have to do
                        this.  It's not just for you. 
                        It's for me, for my father.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        So, you go along with the charade,
                        pretending that you're happy about
                          marrying a man you don't love?

          Johnny can see from her look that she's determined to
          keep him safe, no matter what.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Do you think Stillson knows about
                        the deal?

                                        MIRANDA
                        I don't know.  He's never mentioned
                        it.  But I know one thing, these
                        people aren't playing games. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        What if I could figure a way out
                        of this.

                                        MIRANDA
                        What are you talking about?

                                        JOHNNY
                        The man that offered you the deal,
                        do you know who he is?

                                        MIRANDA
                        I never saw his face.  Why?

                                        JOHNNY
                        He broke into my house the same
                        day you came back.  He left me a
                          message.

                                        MIRANDA
                        What kind of message?

                                        JOHNNY
                          I haven't figured that out yet. 
                        But I'm pretty sure he's Stillson's
                        new top advisor.  I also think
                        he's connected to Reverend Purdy
                        in some way.

                                        MIRANDA
                        I don't see how this changes
                          anything.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Whoever this guy is, he operates
                        in the shadows.  In the dark.  If
                        I can find out who he is, maybe I
                        can I draw him into the light. 
                        Then, maybe, we make a deal of
                        our own.

                                        MIRANDA
                        I don't know.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You can't give up without a fight.

          As he touches her arm, WHOOSH!


  77INT. ELLIS MANSION - MIRANDA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - VISION

          SENATOR HARLAN ELLIS sits down on the edge of the bed,
          where we see Miranda's wedding dress laid out across the
            mattress.  He picks it up in his hands and begins to weep,
          WHOOSH!  


  88RESUME INT.  BRIDAL BOUTIQUE - DAY

          Johnny flashes out of the vision.  The KNOCKING on the
          door becomes more desperate.

                        Miss Ellis?!  I'll get my key!

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'll figure this out, I promise.

          He takes off out the back of the shop, as the Saleswoman 
          suddenly opens the door.

                                        SALESWOMAN
                        Are you alright?  Miss Ellis?

                        Yes, I'm fine.

          OFF Miranda, thinking about Johnny's promise...

  99INT.  SMITH HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY

          Johnny is on the computer, as Bruce thumbs through a Bible.

                                        BRUCE
                        He was just holding her wedding
                        dress and crying?

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's what I saw.

                                        BRUCE
                        That could mean anything.  Maybe
                        she called it off and the old man
                        lost his ticket to the White House.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe.  I don't intend to leave
                        it to chance.  I'm telling you,
                        it's all connected to this mystery
                        man.  I can feel it in my bones.

          Johnny waits as some pages are being printed.

                                        BRUCE
                        I've been going over the Bible
                        passage he left for you.  It's
                        from the book of Daniel.  "The
                        third ruler of the kingdom."  It
                        sounds to me like he considers
                        you an equal.  Like he's reaching
                        out, trying to make a deal. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        A deal?  He has to know that I'd
                        never do anything to help him or
                          Stillson.

                                        BRUCE
                        Maybe he's trying to scare you.

          Johnny retrieves the printed pages, then slips on his
          jacket.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Listen, Sarah's out of town and
                        I'm supposed to pick up J.J. from
                        school and drive him home.  Would
                        you mind?




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Forbidden Fruit" - ACT ONE - 9/10/05 - YELLOW  8.


    9CONTINUED:9

                                        BRUCE
                        No problem.  Where are you going?

                                        JOHNNY
                        To put my own scare into somebody.

          Johnny exits, as Bruce continues to look at the Bible.


  1010INT. ELLIS MANSION - DAY

          Miranda studies the seating chart with the WEDDING PLANNER,
          an officious, woman in a headset.  A cute young female
          FLORIST arranges blooms, including lilies, in a sample
            centerpiece.

                                        WEDDING PLANNER
                        This is a sample table setting,
                        this china is nearly a hundred
                        years old.

                                        MIRANDA
                                (scans list)
                        Is this the official guest list?

                                        WEDDING PLANNER
                        Is there a problem?

                                        MIRANDA
                        I don't recognize half of these
                        names. 

                                        WEDDING PLANNER
                        The list came from Congressman
                        Stillson's Chief of Staff.

                                        MIRANDA
                        Why is there a camera crew listed?

                                        SENATOR ELLIS (O.C.)
                        Because the ceremony is going to
                        be televised.

          Senator Harlan Ellis enters the room.

                                        MIRANDA
                        Televised?

                                        SENATOR ELLIS
                        On the Faith Heritage Network. 
                        Greg and I thought it would be a
                        good idea to reach out to the
                        people, make them feel like part
                        of the family.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Forbidden Fruit" - ACT ONE - 9/10/05 - YELLOW  9.


    10CONTINUED:10

                                        MIRANDA
                        Daddy, I don't want this turned
                        into a media circus.  I mean, is
                        this a wedding or a political
                          fundraiser?

                                        SENATOR ELLIS
                        Both, if you we do it right. 
                                (off her look)
                        Honey, people have a vested
                          interest in Greg Stillson.  When
                        they look at him, they see the
                        future of this country.

                                        STILLSON (O.C.)
                        And the future looks fantastic!

          Miranda turns to SEE Stillson step up beside the very
          cute, very young Florist and helps her arrange a vase of
          lilies.  It's obvious he's flirting with her.

                                        STILLSON
                                (re: lilies)
                        These are my absolute favorites. 
                        So delicate and unspoiled.

          The young woman seems embarrassed as she quickly moves
          away.  Stillson turns his attention towards Miranda.

                                        STILLSON
                        There's my girl!
                                (kiss on the cheek)
                        We're really going to do this,
                        aren't we?

                                        SENATOR ELLIS
                        It's turning in to the social
                        event of the season.  The guest
                        list reads like a Who's Who of
                        beltway power brokers.

                                        MIRANDA
                                  (sarcastic)
                        I hope we can leave some standing
                        room for family and friends.

          Stillson picks up the guest list.

                                        STILLSON
                                (catches his eye)
                        You invited Congressman Kelly? 

          Stillson shoots Ellis a hard look.

                                        SENATOR ELLIS
                        It's tradition for a Junior
                          Congressman to invite his Senior
                          counterpart.

                                        STILLSON
                                  (irritated)
                        Tradition?  This sonofabitch has
                          traditionally blocked every piece
                        of legislation I've created. 
                        He's my biggest political
                        roadblock.  Now I have to feed
                        the fat bastard?

          Stillson unwittingly let's his dark side out in public. 
          He glances around, as the others look away.

                                        SENATOR ELLIS
                        If you don't invite him, people
                        will think...

                                        STILLSON
                        I'm afraid. 

          Then, like a true sociopath, his mood swings from anger
          to buoyant goodwill.

                                        STILLSON
                                (calming)
                        What the hell.  Daddy used to
                        say, keep your friends close and
                        your enemies closer.  Let's put
                          Congressman Kelly and his lovely
                        wife at table one.  How's that
                        sound, darlin'?

          He slips his arm around Miranda's shoulder. 

                                        MIRANDA
                        I'm not feeling very well.  I
                        think I'll lie down for a few
                          minutes.

                                        STILLSON
                        Want some company?

          Now it's Senator Ellis' turn to look away.

                                        MIRANDA
                        No.  I just need to rest, that's
                        all.

                        You do look a little pale.  Did
                        you see Dr. Knox?

                                        MIRANDA
                        It's nothing, daddy.  Excuse me.

          Miranda walks quickly away.

                                        STILLSON
                        Doctor Knox?

                                        SENATOR ELLIS
                          Miranda's doctor.  He's treated
                        her since she was a child.  Saved
                        her life.

                                        STILLSON
                        Is that right?

                                        SENATOR ELLIS
                        Miranda suffered rheumatic fever
                        when she was a little girl.  The
                        illness damaged her heart.

                        She never mentioned it.

                                        SENATOR ELLIS
                        She wouldn't. 

          We see Stillson's look of concern, but over what?


  1111INT.  PURDY'S OFFICE - DAY

          Johnny ENTERS, catching Purdy off guard.

                        Johnny, to what do I owe this
                        unexpected pleasure?

                        I was wondering if I might talk
                        to you about something?

                        We are friends, aren't we, Gene? 
                        I mean, if you were in trouble,
                        you'd confide in me, wouldn't
                        you?

                                        PURDY
                        Of course.  What's on your mind?

                                        JOHNNY
                          I understand your ministry
                          subscriptions have tripled since
                        you started broadcasting on
                        satellite?

                                        PURDY
                        We're extremely blessed to be
                        able to get our message out to
                        those in need.

                                        JOHNNY

                                  transcript)
                          I logged onto the ministry's
                        website and downloaded the
                        transcript of a chat room
                          conversation.

                                        PURDY
                                (uneasy)
                          I wasn't aware you were a computer
                          enthusiast?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not.  But the subject of this
                        particular conversation caught my
                        attention.  Apparently, the weekend
                        that Miranda Ellis disappeared,
                        you led a mass prayer service on-
                        line.

                                        PURDY
                        I've conducted many such services.

                                        JOHNNY
                        After she was found, the chat
                        room was buzzing with people
                          claiming that you'd performed a
                          miracle.  There were even some
                        saying you'd willed her rescue
                        through divine intervention.

                                (taken aback)
                        Well, you know that the Internet
                        is populated by some rather dubious
                          characters.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I suppose.  The interesting thing
                        to me was that you never publicly
                        denied the claims.  Never attempted
                        to set the record straight.  Why
                        is that?

          Purdy's normally calm exterior begins to wilt.

                                        PURDY
                        I'm not sure where this is going?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You've made some remarkable strides
                        in the past ten months.  And it
                        all seemed to begin with your
                        jump to satellite.

                        This picture was also on the
                          website.  It was taken the day
                        you dedicated the ministry's new

          We see Purdy, a few local dignitaries and assorted
            officials and, standing in the back just about to turn
          away, we see Mister Janus.

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        Can you tell me his name?

          RESUME PURDY AND JOHNNY

          Purdy seems slightly unnerved.

                                        PURDY
                                (beat)
                        His name is Janus.  Malcolm Janus.

                        What's his connection to Faith
                          Heritage?

                        He's a supporter.  Actually, he's
                        the one who first approached me
                        with the idea of taking the
                          ministry global.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Where would I find this Mister
                        Janus?

                                        PURDY
                        We usually meet here.  Or at my
                        home.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He doesn't have an office?

                                        PURDY
                        I'm sure he does, I've just never
                        been there.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        What do you know about Janus
                          personally?

                                        PURDY
                        He's a businessman.  He owns, or
                        runs several International
                        companies.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Owns or runs?

                                        PURDY
                        I'm not sure.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What kind of companies?

                                        PURDY
                        I'm not sure.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You don't know very much about
                        this man, do you?

                                        PURDY
                        I know he offered me the
                          opportunity to spread God's word. 
                        To carry His message and His
                          teachings to places and people
                        who'd otherwise be forgotten.  In
                        many ways, he's made my dreams
                        for Faith Heritage come true.

                        And what did he ask in return?

                                        PURDY
                          Nothing.  He's asked for nothing.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It must be true what they say. 
                        You truly must be touched by God.

          Johnny exits and we see the look of conflict on Purdy's
          face.


  1212INT. MAINE CONGRESSIONAL OFFICE - DAY

          Senior Maine Congressman PAT KELLY, a larger-than-life,
            red-faced Irishman in the Tip O'Neill/Teddy Kennedy mold,
          and his Chief Assistant, MICHAEL SCANNELL, go over an
          upcoming press release.

                                        KELLY
                        It's important that we get out in
                        front of this thing.

                                        SCANNELL
                        It might be smart to restate our
                        commitment to Homeland Security.

                                        STILLSON (O.C.)
                        I don't know about Homeland
                          Security...

          Both men TURN, to REVEAL

          GREG STILLSON

          Standing in the open office doorway.

                                        STILLSON
                        But these offices could definitely
                        use some tightening up. 
                                (big smile)
                          Apparently, they'll let anybody
                        in.

          Kelly greets his young rival with the smiling insincerity
          of a career baby kisser.

                                        KELLY
                        Greg, my boy.  You know my door's
                        always open to an eager student
                        of the game.

          Stillson smiles through the obvious shot at his
            inexperience.

                        You know Mike Scannell, my chief
                        aide.

                        Of course.  I hear you're
                          considering a run for Mayor?

                                        SCANNELL
                        I'm weighing my options.  My
                          congratulations on your upcoming
                          wedding.

                                        STILLSON
                        Thank you.  I figured it was about
                        time I moved onto the national
                        scene.

                                        KELLY
                        How's that?

                                        STILLSON
                        Polls seem to indicate that a
                        wife and family is all I need to
                        swing the Southern states.

                                        KELLY
                        We talking about Pennsylvania
                        Avenue?

                        If we are, you didn't hear it
                        from me.

                                        SCANNELL
                        I'll make sure we incorporate
                        these notes into the text.

                          Congressman.

          Scannell exits, as Kelly fixes himself a drink.

                        No.  But you probably need one.

                                        KELLY
                        How's that?

                        The press must be barkin' at your
                        heels over this newspaper article.

          It's obvious Stillson is enjoying Kelly's trouble.

                        You know, Greg, your arrogance is
                        one of the big reasons you're not
                        further along in your career.

                                        STILLSON
                        Is that right?

                                        KELLY
                        People will put up with an
                          unlikable leader as long as they
                        don't feel like they're being
                        sold down the river.  Your
                          desperate ambition for higher
                        office scares the average voter. 
                        Makes them feel like you don't
                        respect their needs.  I, on the
                        other hand, have no ambition beyond
                        the office I currently represent. 

                                        STILLSON
                        Let's cut to the chase.  You've
                        blocked every move I've made and
                        I'm tired of it.  I want it to
                        stop.

                                        KELLY
                        Or else?

                                        STILLSON
                        I can either help you through
                        this messy situation, or I can
                        step aside and let you get run
                        over.  The choice is yours.

                        You don't scare me, son.  Neither
                        does that cold-blooded phantom
                        that's pulling your strings. 
                        People around here don't like
                        outsiders.  Especially ones they
                        don't know.  So you go back and
                        tell your master that I said to
                        go straight to Hell.

          Stillson swallows his anger and heads for the door,

                        Donna and I look forward to the
                          wedding!

          Stillson blows out the door, as Kelly slugs down the rest
          of his whiskey.  His face reads more concern than he's
          willing to admit.


  1313INT.  TOWN CAR - CONTINUOUS

          Stillson slips into the back and slams the car door shut.

                        That's unfortunate.  Now we'll
                        have to do it the hard way.

                                        STILLSON
                        I don't care how you get it done,
                        just get that old man out of my

                        It's already in the works.

  1414INT.  JOHNNY'S HOUSE - BASEMENT

          Johnny's staring at the Armageddon board, while Bruce is
          on the computer.

                        I've run Janus backwards and
                          forwards and I get nothing.  Either
                        that's not his real name, or he
                        really is a ghost.

          Johnny lingers on a photo of Miranda on the board,

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's real.  And from the way Purdy
                          reacted, dangerous.

          Johnny grabs the phone and dials.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (on the phone)
                        Miranda Ellis. -- When do you
                        expect her back? -- I realize
                        she's getting married tomorrow. --
                        No, there's no message.

          He hangs up.

                                        BRUCE
                        Maybe Walt can help?

                        The White House raised the
                          terrorist alert because of the
                        article in the paper.  He's out
                        at the oil refinery, helping with
                          security. 

          The phone RINGS.  Johnny picks up.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hello.

                        I've been thinking about our
                          previous conversation.

                        I made a few inquiries and came
                        up with an address.  Perhaps it
                        might help clear things up for
                        you.  Do you have a pen?

          Johnny scribbles down the information.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I've got it.  Listen, Gene, I
                        want you to know how much... Hello? 


  1616INT. PURDY'S OFFICE - DAY

          Purdy hangs up, then HEARS...

                                        JANUS (O.S.)
                        It appears someone has their hand
                        in the cookie jar.

          Purdy looks up to REVEAL...

          JANUS

            Seemingly materialized out of thin air.  Purdy's sure he
          just heard him on the phone with Johnny.

                                        PURDY
                        I can explain.

                                        JANUS
                        The situation is crystal clear
                        from where I'm standing.

          He picks up the empty cookie jar off Purdy's desk.

                                        JANUS
                        You're out of those shortbread
                        cookies I enjoy so much.

          We see the look of relief wash across Purdy's face.

                                        PURDY
                          Cookies?  Of course.  I'll have
                        Mrs. Campion bake you a batch.

                        I need your assistance on a matter
                        of great importance.

                                        PURDY

                        As you may know, Congressman
                          Stillson and I have grown quite
                        close since the unexpected death
                        of his father.

                                        PURDY
                          I wasn't aware.

                        In many ways he looks upon me as
                          a surrogate parent.  An advisor
                        in matters of both professional
                        and personal regard.

                        I see.

                        The Congressman is, at his core,
                          a simple man.  From humble
                          beginnings.  Therefore, he feels
                        himself inadequate in expressing
                        certain communications.  Matters
                        of the heart, for example.

                                        PURDY
                        Matters of the heart?

                                        JANUS
                        The Congressman has approached
                        me, in extreme confidence, and
                        asked that I put into words some
                          unexpressed feelings relating to
                        his bride-to-be.  Expressions
                        he'd have you recite at the
                          appropriate time.

                                        PURDY
                        Are we talking about wedding vows?

                        Vows?  God, no.  A testimonial. 
                          A public attestation of emotion.

          Janus takes out a sealed envelope and slides it across

                        At the Congressman's request, the
                          envelope should remain sealed
                        until the appropriate time.

                                        PURDY
                          I understand.

                                        JANUS
                        It's crucial that we each
                        understand our roles during these
                          turbulent days ahead.  And that
                        we weigh the consequence of our
                          actions.  Don't you agree?

                                        PURDY
                        I do.

                                        JANUS
                        I do indeed.

          He turns and heads towards the door.

          TIGHT ON JANUS' FACE

          With what appears to be the hint of a smile.

                                        JANUS
                        'Til death do us part, Reverend. 
                        Words we can all live by.

          And he's gone, as Purdy regards the mysterious envelope.

                        I swear to God.  It's twelve
                        dollars an hour and we just sit
                        here doing nothing.  It's actually
                        pretty boring.

          WHOOSH!

                        It was a front.

                          A front?

                        This office.  There wasn't any
                          business here, it was just supposed
                        to look that way.

                        What about Janus?

          Johnny notices an office door at the far end of the space.

  2020INT. HEAD OFFICE - VISION

          As the room MORPHS into a furnished space.  The chair
          behind the desk turns around, we see Janus.

                                        JANUS
                                (on a headset phone)
                          I believe the public has a
                          fundamental right to know if
                        they're being adequately protected
                        from terrorism.  I don't need to
                        remind you what's at stake here
                        for you personally?  How this
                        could affect your career?

          Janus circles the writer's byline from a Boston Telegraph
            newspaper article.  The writer's name is JEREMY TOMLIN.

                                        JANUS
                          I appreciate your concern for
                          national security, but if I were
                        you, I'd worry more about your
                        own.  Your career.  The safety of
                        your family.  These are very
                        fragile things. -- That's a wise
                          decision.  I'll expect to see the
                        story in Tuesday's edition.

          As Janus hangs up, WHOOSH!


  2121INT. HEAD OFFICE - RESUME

          Johnny flashes out of the vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's Janus.  He's the one who
                        leaked the security information
                        to the newspaper.

                                        BRUCE
                        Are you sure?

                                        JOHNNY
                        He was talking on the phone about
                        it.  He'd circled the name of a
                        Boston Telegraph reporter.  The
                        same reporter that broke the story
                        in today's paper.

                        That's it, then.  If you can prove
                        Janus was the source of the leak,
                        you can bring him down.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And save Miranda.

                                        BRUCE
                        You'll have to convince the
                          reporter to go public with his
                        name.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, and we don't have much time.

          They take off, as...


  2222INT.  BOSTON TELEGRAPH STRINGER OFFICE - BANGOR - DAY

          5 OR 6 people talking on phones or working on computers. 
          JEREMY TOMLIN is on the phone.  He's casual, confident, a
          12-year veteran reporter.

                                        JEREMY
                                (on the phone)
                        Roger, I can't do it. -- Because
                        I can't reveal a source. -- That's
                        nice.  Do you kiss your mother
                        with that mouth?

          He abruptly hangs up, as Johnny steps up.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Excuse me...

          Jeremy holds up a finger, draws a bottle of Mallox from
          his desk drawer and guzzles it down.

                                        JEREMY
                        Ok.  Go.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I was wondering if I might speak
                        to you about the article you wrote?

                                        JEREMY
                        My three-part expose' on last
                          season's blueberry crop? 
                                (off Johnny's look)
                        I'm kidding.

          A copy boy, FERREL, steps up...

                        Jeremy, there's like a thousand
                        phone messages here from all over
                        the country.  Everybody wants...

                        Me to name my source.  I know. 
                        Tell them it isn't going to happen. 
                        Tell them if Bob Woodward can
                        keep Deep Throat a secret for
                        thirty years, I can protect mine
                        for at least the weekend.  Go!

          The kid shuffles away.

                                        JOHNNY
                        My name is John.

                                        JEREMY
                        Hello, John.  Good-bye John.

          He heads for the door.


  2323EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY

          Johnny follows Jeremy out of the building and up the
            sidewalk.

                                        JOHNNY
                        If I could just have a minute?

                                        JEREMY
                        I'd love to, but I've got a lot
                        to do before I go to jail.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So, you're not going to reveal
                        your source to the Grand Jury?

          Jeremy STOPS.

                                        JEREMY
                        I know you.  You're... 

                                        JOHNNY

          He starts walking again, as Johnny follows...

                        I spent three months tryin' to
                        get an exclusive interview with
                        you.  You never returned my calls.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I've been busy.
                                (off Jeremy's look)
                        Okay, I'm a jerk.   

                                        JEREMY
                        What are you doing here?  Somebody
                        hire you to figure out the identity
                        of my source?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Actually, I already know who it
                        is.

                                        JEREMY
                                (amused)

                          Unfortunately, it doesn't do me
                        any good unless the name goes
                        public.
                                (off Jeremy's look)
                        It's a long story.

                                        JEREMY
                        People have a right to know the
                        truth, John.  And people have the
                        same right to their privacy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And you'd rather go to jail?

                        It's a complicated world. 

          Jeremy takes out a business card and writes something on
          the back of it.

                        mind about that interview.

          He gives Johnny the card and is about to get in his car,

                          I can't.  I'm sorry.

          He closes the door on Johnny.


  2525INT.  ELLIS MANSION - BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Miranda is getting ready for bed, closing the French doors
          to the outside.  She pauses to look at her wedding dress
          lying across the sofa.  This should be the happiest time
          of her life, but it's anything but.  Suddenly, Stillson
          wraps his arms around her from behind, startling her.

                                        MIRANDA
                                (startled)
                        God.  You scared me.

          She realize he's wearing just pajama bottoms and a T-shirt.

                                        MIRANDA
                        What are you doing?

                                        STILLSON
                        What's it look like?

          He goes to kiss her, but Miranda pushes him away.

                                        MIRANDA
                          I can't.  I mean, we can't sleep
                          together the night before the
                          wedding.  It's bad luck.

                        Are you serious?

          She doesn't respond to his affection, as he steps back.

                                        STILLSON
                        What's wrong?

                                        MIRANDA
                        I saw the way you looked at that
                        girl today.  The way you look at
                        other women.

                                        STILLSON
                        You're angry because I looked at
                        a girl?  Darlin', men look at
                        pretty girls, it's what we do.

                        Don't treat me like I'm stupid.

          She pushes him away again, as tempers flare...

          She stops short of saying Johnny's name.

                        What?  Talk to me.

                        I grew up surrounded by powerful
                        men.  My grandfather, my uncles...
                        My father.  Even as a little girl,
                        I knew there were other women. 
                        My mother knew it, too.  There
                        was an unspoken agreement. 
                          Whatever happened outside the
                        house, stayed outside.  I can
                        deal with certain things, but I
                        won't be made a fool of in public. 
                        That I can't accept.  Not even
                        for you.

          She holds Stillson's stare, he seems oddly touched by her
          honesty.

                        I don't want to talk about this.

          She tries to pull away, but he holds her tight.

          He exits.  Miranda starts for the bed, then notices his
          clothes scattered on the floor.  She crosses to pick them
          up and something drops of his pants pocket.  She picks it
          up,

          CLOSE ON: a diamond earring.  One.

          Miranda absorbs the moment, believing it belongs to one
          of the other women that Stillson so desperately denied.

                        Not much I'm afraid, but I'm sure
                        he's the source behind the article
                        in the newspaper.  I tried to

                        That means we don't have any
                          leverage.  No way to force Janus

                        too high.  Go back to bed.

                        I can't sleep.  I'm gonna walk up
                        to the bakery and get some bagels. 
                        If the phone rings, let it go,
                        it's just people wanting comments
                        on the hearing today.

          We HEAR the phone begin RINGING inside the house.

                                        JEREMY
                        See?

          He seems bothered,

                                        KAREN
                        What? 

                                        JEREMY
                        You ever have the feeling you
                        were doing the wrong thing for
                        all the right reasons?  

          Jeremy gives her a kiss as he pats her stomach and then
          walks away.  The PHONE CONTINUES TO RING inside the house.

          Karen continues working deeper into the garden.

          Flashing out of the vision, Johnny recoils as if bitten
          himself.  He grabs for his phone and dials the number off
          the business card.

                        you get this message, keep your
                        wife out of the garden.  There's
                        danger in the garden.  I hope I
                        can get there before it's too
                        late.

  3838EXT. ELLIS ESTATE - MORNING

            Stillson, dressed in jogging attire, finishes his morning
          run.  He's bent over trying to catch his breath, as Janus
          appears.

                                        STILLSON
                                (breathing hard)
                        Mister Janus.  I missed you on
                        the road this morning.

                                        JANUS
                        I've never grasped the notion of
                        running until one's lungs explode
                        as an endorsement for healthy
                        living.

          Stillson smiles, then realizes this visit is all business.

                                        STILLSON
                        What's on your mind?

                                        JANUS
                        The future.  More to the point,
                        yours, both personal and
                          professional.

                                        STILLSON

                        If this is about Miranda, she and
                        I had a heart-to-heart last night. 
                        I can assure you she's not going
                        to be a problem.

                                        JANUS
                        That's excellent news.  I'm
                          curious, did this heart-to-heart
                        take place before or after she
                        went to Johnny Smith's house?

                        the house.  She was back in the
                        house just before daylight.

          Stillson takes a few steps away to gather himself.

                                        STILLSON
                        I don't understand, I told her...
                        I mean, I promised...

                          Perhaps, if you spoke to her again?

          Stillson spins, his pain suddenly replaced with rage.

                                        STILLSON
                        Speak to her?  What would you
                        suggest we talk about?  Johnny
                        Smith?  It seems to be the only
                        thing we have in common!

          He violently kicks a garbage can in anger.

                                        STILLSON
                        She's never going to give him up. 
                        This is just going to go on and
                        on...

          Janus continues to play him like a violin.

                        How would you suggest I handle
                        the situation?

          Stillson considers the question as we see a cold resolve
          wash over him.

                                        STILLSON
                                (cold)
                        I'll leave that decision to you. 

          He starts away, then hesitates, but never turns to look
          at Janus...

                                        STILLSON
                        This is a turning point for us,
                          Malcolm.  Don't disappoint me.

          Miranda is in her wedding dress.  KATHLEEN, a young woman
          her own age, her MAID OF HONOR, fusses over her make-up.

                        2 hours and counting.

                        Is that all?  I didn't realize it
                        was so late.

                                        KATHLEEN
                        You okay, sweetie?

          She doesn't look like a blushing bride, that's for sure.

                                        MIRANDA
                        Fine.  Just overexcited.

                        I could pull the car around back. 
                        We'd be in Canada before they cut
                        the cake.

          There's a knock at the door, as Kathleen answers, we see
          Stillson dressed in his wedding suit.

                        I'd like to speak with Miranda.

                        Now?

          Stillson's eyes narrow, as he's about to unload.

                                        MIRANDA
                        It's okay, Katy.  Can you get me
                        some water?

                                        KATHLEEN
                        Sure.  I'll be right back.

          She cuts Stillson a hard look and leaves.  Stillson steps
          in and closes the door.

                        other?

          She doesn't like the energy he's giving off.  Stillson
          steps up behind her, staring at her in the mirror.  It's
          creepy, as if he's trying to memorize her face.

                                        STILLSON

                        Before everything happens.

          He sets his hand on the side of her neck, as if he might
          strangle her right here.

                                        STILLSON
                        I want you to know that I meant*
                        everything I said last night.  I
                        don't think I ever bared my soul
                        to another human being the way I
                        have with you.

          His eyes burn through the reflection of the mirror.

                                        STILLSON
                        I love you, Miranda.  Always*
                          remember that.*

          He kisses her on the neck, then walks out, passing Kathleen
          as she returns with a bottle of water.

                        I'm not sure.

          As we see the uncertain fear in her eyes.

          Johnny tosses the shovel aside.

                        Are you okay?

                                        KAREN
                          I didn't see it.  How did you
                        know it was there?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I've had some recent experience
                        with snakes in the grass.

          CLOSE ON: Johnny picks the snake up by the tail.  WHOOSH!

          MATCH MOVE MORPH


  4141INT.  ND LOCATION - DAY

          There are small cages with different types of deadly snakes
          in them.  There's a bigger cage, where there are about a
          dozen poisonous snakes slithering around.

          SMALL CAGE 

          A slick black snake identical to the one in Karen's garden,
          is grabbed behind the head by a LEATHER GLOVE.

          SNAKE MAN

            A rough-looking guy "milks" the snake of its venom, holding
          its fangs against the edge a small glass vial, as the
          bottom pools with deadly venom.

          Observer Johnny watches as a BIG MAN (we remember him as
          one of Stillson's/Janus' Security Men) watches from a few
          feet away.

                                        SECURITY MAN
                        So, it can't kill anyone now?

                                        SNAKE MAN
                        Not for a few hours.  Not until
                        it has a chance to produce more
                        venom.  It'll make you sick as a
                        dog though.  This particular venom
                        affects the heart.

          He slips the snake into a heavy canvas bag and hands it
          to Security Man, who hands the man a wad of cash.  We
          notice that he's wearing black leather gloves.

                                        SNAKE MAN
                        Mind if I ask what you need it
                        for? 


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Forbidden Fruit" - ACT THREE - 9/10/05 - YELLOW  44.


    41CONTINUED:41

                                        SECURITY MAN
                          Somebody wants to send a message. 
                        How much for the venom? 

                                        SNAKE MAN
                        The venom?  I can't sell that to
                        you.  I mean, just a pin prick of
                        this stuff can kill a person.  

                                        SECURITY MAN
                        I guess I'll have to take it then.

          Before the Snake Man can react, the Security Man hits him
          with a powerful forearm blow to the jaw, knocking him
            unconscious.  He grabs the guy by the back of his jacket
          and drags him to the door of the large cage, opens it and
          shoves the guy into the cage full of deadly snakes.  He
          locks the cage with a padlock (with gloved hands, thus
          leaving no fingerprints).  Then he takes the bagged snake
          and the vial of venom and leaves.


  4242RESUME - JEREMY'S HOUSE - GARDEN - MORNING

          Johnny flashes out of the vision, as he realizes the snake
          was bought by Janus...

                        Karen!

          Jeremy runs to his wife and hugs her.

                                (to Johnny)
                        What happened?


  4343INT.  JEREMY'S HOUSE - HOME OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

          Johnny and Jeremy are talking.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think it was meant as a warning.

                                        JEREMY
                          Warning?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Somebody wanted to scare you. 
                          Somebody whose afraid you might
                        talk.

                                        JEREMY
                        You think my source did this?

                        He knows there's pressure on you
                        to reveal his name.

                                        JEREMY
                        That thing could have killed my
                        wife... my child.

          We see the anger swell inside him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        People get nervous.  Lives are on
                        the line.  The question now is,
                        what will you do to protect
                          yourself?

          Jeremy hesitates, then reaches for the phone and dials...

                                        JEREMY
                                (on phone)
                        Andy, it's Jerry.  How quick can
                        you put together a press
                          conference?

          Johnny sighs as it appears he's finally going to take
          Janus down.  But will it be in time...


  4444EXT.  ELLIS MANSION - DAY

          GUESTS arriving.  PHOTOGRAPHERS are snapping pictures and
          WAITERS holding trays of drinks.  A LIMO pulls up as
          Congressman Kelly and his wife get out.  As we notice
          that the event is being broadcast live on the Faith
          Heritage Network, a REPORTER interviews him.

                          Congressman, given your stormy
                        history with Greg Stillson, are
                        you surprised to be here today?

                          Congressman Stillson and I disagree
                        about how best to lead this State. 
                        But today is about family.  On
                        that subject I think we're in
                        agreement.  Excuse me.

          He moves on, greeting other guests.

          Jeremy is there in a sport coat and tie, his LAWYER, his
          wife and several reporters with TV cameras.  Johnny and
          Bruce stand in the back.

                                        BRUCE
                        It's a good thing you kept that
                          business card.

                        The important thing is we get
                        Janus' name on the record as the
                        source of the security leak.

                        Here we go.

          PODIUM

          Jeremy steps up to the makeshift podium.

                                        JEREMY
                        Thank you for coming on such short
                        notice.  I believe in the power
                        of the press.  I've dedicated my
                        life to it.  But my family hasn't. 
                                (looks over at his
                                wife)
                        There's a threat to our liberty,
                        but it's not from foreign
                          aggressors.  It comes from within. 
                        It saddens me to reveal a source
                        I've sworn to protect, but whom I
                        feel has betrayed that trust.  My
                          source's name is -- Michael
                          Scannell, Congressman Pat Kelly's
                        chief of staff.

          There's a flurry of excitement.  Johnny is shocked.

                        I don't know whether Congressman
                        Kelly knew or approved the leak. 
                          I assume an independent
                          investigation will determine his
                          culpability.  I'll take a few
                          questions now.

          The REPORTER standing next to Johnny shakes his head.

                        wiped out, all in the same day. 
                        This guy is unstoppable.

          He walks away, as Johnny realizes just how badly he's
          been duped.

                        Janus wasn't blackmailing Jeremy

                        He must have set him up or dug up
                        some dirt on him, something to
                        get him to go along with the idea.

                        I'm sure Scannell never knew who
                        he was dealing with, just a voice
                        on the phone.

                        Janus used the snake to put the
                        fear of God into Tomlin, knowing
                        he'd name Scannell and bring down
                        Stillson's biggest political
                          obstacle in the process.  It's
                          actually brilliant.

  4848INT.  ELLIS MANSION - BEDROOM - DAY

          Miranda, in her wedding dress, stands at the window,
          looking out.

                                        JANUS (O.C.)
                        I hope you're not contemplating a
                        jump?

          Miranda turns to REVEAL...

          JANUS

          Dressed neatly in a classic black tuxedo.

                                        MIRANDA
                                (slight panic)
                        Where's Katy?

                                        JANUS
                          I believe she had an emergency
                        phone call.  A family matter.

          It's obvious he's set up this moment for them to be alone.

                                        JANUS
                        I don't believe we've formally
                        been introduced.

          He offers his hand, but Miranda ignores the gesture.

                                        MIRANDA
                        I know who you are.  I'd appreciate
                        it if you'd leave.

          She turns again to stare out the window.  Janus steps up
          behind her.

                          Weddings are one of those ancient
                        rituals I've never understood. 
                        Did you know that very few members
                        of the animal kingdom actually
                        mate for life? 

                                        MIRANDA
                        You'd be the expert on animal
                          behavior.

                                        JANUS
                        There's a tribe in Africa where
                        the bride's entire family enters
                        the sleeping hut the morning after
                        the wedding.  If there's no sign
                        of blood in the marriage bed, the
                        woman is dragged to the center of
                        the village and stoned to death. 
                        It's considered a sign of betrayal. 
                        It's fortunate civilization has
                        come so far, wouldn't you agree?

          She turns to face him.

                                        MIRANDA
                        Why are you here?

                                        JANUS
                        I bring a peace offering from the
                        groom.

          Janus draws a small box from his coat pocket and opens
          it.  We see TWO diamond earrings.  They are identical to
          the one that fell out of Stillson's pants pocket.  Miranda
          seems taken aback.

                                        JANUS
                        The Congressman had planned to
                        present them to you sooner, but
                        as fortune would have it, he
                          misplaced one of them.

          She suddenly realizes Stillson didn't lie to her.  That
          the earring she found was meant for her all along.  Now
          she's unwittingly become the betrayer.

                                        JANUS
                        I know how much it would mean to
                        him to have you wear them today.

          She takes them, as Janus steps to the door, then looks
          back at her.

                          Stunning.  Truly, stunning.

          He exits.  Miranda steps to the mirror, takes one of the
          earrings and removes the backing,

          CLOSE ON: the sharp silver post of the earring, shining
          like a deadly weapon as she slips it into the hole in her
          ear lobe.

          Guests are being seated for the ceremony, STRING MUSIC
          PLAYING.  Senator Ellis is standing at the rear greeting
          guests as they head for their seats, together with Reverend
          Purdy as Congressman Kelly and his wife step forward.

          A REPORTER and his camera crew rush up to Kelly.

                          Congressman Kelly, what's your

                        What are you talking about?

                        Tomlin just finished a press
                        conference in which he claimed to
                        have documentation and recordings

          As Kelly fights his way back towards the cars.

          Purdy turns to see Janus standing from across the lawn. 
          Their eyes meet, as Janus raises his glass of champagne,
          then walks away.  Purdy has a sinking feeling, as the
          STRING QUARTET strikes up the WEDDING MARCH...


  5050EXT. ELLIS MANSION - DAY

          Everyone is now seated.  Stillson stands at the front
          near Purdy, who is to conduct the ceremony. 

          Senator Ellis waits to accompany Miranda, who is not there
          yet.

          The STRING QUARTET finishes the wedding march.  A hush of
            anticipation falls over the crowd.

          Stillson waits in silence, stony-faced.

          Purdy waits.

          Ellis waits.

          Stillson glances at Purdy.  Purdy smiles patiently.

          Stillson glances back at Senator Ellis.

          A child cries, breaking the silence.  Is shushed.

          SUDDENLY someone does appear.  But it's not Miranda. 
          It's Kathleen.

                                        KATHLEEN
                        It's Miranda!  She's not breathing!

          The frozen tableau suddenly bursts into motion and sound. 
          Senator Ellis bolts for the house.

          Stillson and Purdy exchange a knowing look, as Stillson
          heads quickly for the main house.

          Crowd chatter: "What's going on?"  "What happened?"  "Where
          is she?"  "I hope she's all right."          DEAD ZONE: "Forbidden Fruit" - ACT FOUR - 9/10/05 - YELLOW  54.

          As she's rolled past him, surrounded by paramedics, Johnny
          can just see her face as she passes...

          SLO-MOTION

          As he sees she's unconscious, but just as beautiful as
          he'd imagined.  He notices the one diamond earring.

          As he watches her being taken away, he hesitates, then
          comes face to face with,

          STILLSON

          They stand a few feet apart.

          Johnny tries to get to him, but he's wrestled away by the
          Security Men as Stillson climbs into the ambulance with
          Miranda.  As it screams away with lights flashing and
          siren wailing,

          JOHNNY

          Wrestles free from the Men's control.

                        He's cool!  We're leaving, just

          The guys move away, leaving Johnny and Bruce in the sea
          of stunned guests.

                        You should have gone to the police.

                                        JOHNNY
                        With what?  Visions?  These people
                        don't leave loose ends. 
                                (he grabs the paper)
                        Did you see this article?  It's
                        about how Stillson is seen as the
                          grieving fianc .  About how that
                        translates into votes.  You think
                        they didn't know that?!

          He throws the paper across the room, as the DOORBELL RINGS.

                        I'm not here.

          Bruce moves to the front door, then returns with Reverend
          Purdy...

                                        BRUCE
                        He's not here.  But if he comes
                        back, see if you can get him to
                        eat something.

          Bruce exits.  Purdy steps over and sits next to Johnny.

                                        PURDY
                                (beat)
                        I owe you an apology.  I was
                        blinded my own ambition.  I never
                        in my wildest imagination thought
                        it would come to this.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What are you talking about?

          Purdy takes out a familiar-looking envelope with a broken
          wax seal and sets it on the table.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What is that?

                                        PURDY
                                  (emotionally distraught)
                        Janus came to see me a few days
                        ago.  He gave me this envelope
                        and told me I wasn't to open it
                        until the proper time.  He said
                        it was something he'd written for
                        Greg Stillson.  Something
                        concerning Miranda.

          This gets Johnny's attention.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Janus wrote something about
                          Miranda?

          Johnny goes for the envelope, but Purdy stops him.

                                        PURDY
                                (becoming upset and
                                  agitated)
                        It's not even his handwriting, I
                          checked.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What...

                                        PURDY
                        He'd just deny it.  There's no
                        way to prove it came from him. 
                        I've been over it a thousand times
                        in my head...

          Johnny grabs Purdy by the arm to settle him down.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gene.

                                        PURDY
                          I assumed it was something to do
                        with the marriage ceremony.  Then,
                        after Miranda... after she
                        collapsed, I opened it.

          Purdy is clearly on the verge of tears.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What is it?  What's in the
                          envelope?

                                        PURDY
                                (beat)
                        It's her eulogy.
                                (hushed rage)
                        The sonofabitch wrote Miranda's
                        eulogy two days before she died.

          As they sit in stunned silence, we go the TITLE CARD.

                                        STERN NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                        Miranda Ellis was 24 years old.

                                                                              FADE OUT.
