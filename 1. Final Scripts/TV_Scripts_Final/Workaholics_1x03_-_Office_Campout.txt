      FADE IN:

      INT. GUYS  HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING (DAY ONE)

      TIGHT ON:  ANDERS  face.  REVEAL that he s laying on the 
      couch.  BLAKE leans over with a HEADLAMP shining into Ders  
      EAR.  Blake is wearing super-thick glasses that magnify his 
      eyes.  ADAM in the wings.

                                  ANDERS
                    There s definitely something in 
                    there.

                                  BLAKE
                    Be still.  Tell me what happened. 

                                  ANDERS
                    I was watching Project Runway last 
                    night and eating pretzel rods and 
                    just passed out.  So I guess, I 
                    like, rolled over one and a piece 
                    broke off in my ear.

                                  ADAM
                    Or maybe I ve been punching you in 
                    your sleep and you didn t know it.

                                  ANDERS
                    That doesn t make any sense.

                                  ADAM
                    It makes more sense than you even 
                    know.

                                  ANDERS
                    So, have you been?

                                  BLAKE
                          (re: Ders  ear)
                    Stop moving.  I can definitely see 
                    it, dude.

                                  ANDERS
                    Well, get it out.

                                  BLAKE
                          (like a doctor)
                    Ders, I need you to take a deep 
                    breath.  We re gonna get you home 
                    in no time.  Adam, tweezers.

      Adam finds Blake some tweezers in a drawer.  Hands them over.

                                  BLAKE (CONT D)
                    OK, hold his head steady.  We don t 
                    know what we re dealing with here.  
                    Don t want to rupture any vessels.  
                    This could be the T-virus.  Okay...
                          (blanking)
                    ... doctor sounding stuff.  More 
                    doctor sounding stuff. 

      Blake licks his chops, artfully digs in.  We hear a CLITCH 
      sound as the blockage is removed.

                                  BLAKE (CONT D)
                          (whispers)
                    Oh sweet Jesus.  

                                  ANDERS
                    What?

      Blake holds up a ROACH in his tweezers.

                                  ADAM
                    It s a fucking ROACH!!!!

                                  ALL
                      AHHHGGHGHGGH!!!! / OH MY GODDD!!!  
                      / NOOOO!!!!

      SLAM TO MAIN TITLES.


                                  END OF COLD OPEN                  Workaholics 104 - Revised Network Draft - 4/2/10        3.


                                        ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      INT. OFFICE - GUYS  CUBICLE - LATER

      Anders is on a sales call, but the guys entertain him by 
      letting him TOSS GRAPES into their mouths.

      BRETT (an outsourced IT guy) fiddles around under Adam s 
      desk.

                                  ANDERS
                          (into work phone)
                    I m saying, get out those old 
                    Bermuda shorts because this thing 
                    will double the size of your calves 
                    in thirty days.

                                  BLAKE
                          (re: cell phone)
                    Yo, our house looks like a circus 
                    tent.

      ANGLE ON:  A cell-phone photo of their tented house. 

                                  ADAM
                    Why would they disguise a poisonous 
                    death trap like that as a clown 
                    house?  If I were a kid, that s 
                    exactly where I would sneak into.  
                    Instead of dope circus tents, they 
                    should just write, like  Library  
                    or  Homework Store  on it.  Dead 
                    kid problem solved.

                                  BLAKE
                    Or there d be a lot of really smart 
                    dead kids. 

                                  ANDERS
                          (hanging up call, to guys)
                    Well, maybe if you guys didn t 
                    treat the house like a garbage can, 
                    we wouldn t have to fumigate it.

                                  ADAM
                    Ders, you re the bedtime maniac, 
                    passing out with pretzels and 
                    waking up with brain-bugs. 





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                  Workaholics 104 - Revised Network Draft - 4/2/10        4.

                                  ANDERS
                    Either way, now we have nowhere to 
                    live for the next three days. 

                                  BLAKE
                    Ders, we re camping!  It s going to  
                    be amazing.  

                                  ADAM
                    Buckle up for a bro-bond.  It s 
                    free, it s fun, and you just might 
                    learn something.

      Adam goes in for a man-hug.  Ders does not reciprocate.

      IT guy Brett pokes his head out...

                                  BRETT
                    Would you mind pulling out that 
                    box, so I can get to the outlet?

                                  ADAM
                    Notta prob, Bob.

                                  BRETT
                    It s Brett.

      Adam pulls the box out and takes a look inside.

                                  ADAM
                    Wow.  Ders, finally found a shirt 
                    that can house those bodacious C-
                    cups of yours.

      Adam holds up some CHEESY XXXL COMPANY TEE SHIRTS from 1997, 
      complete with horrible slogan and graphic.  Ders throws a 
      grape at him.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    Come on momma, give us a shake.

      Anders sighs and then shakes his titties.  The other two guys 
      shake their titties as well. 

                                  BLAKE
                    Keep those on the DL man, they ve 
                    got some serious KSP.
                          (off Ders  look)
                    Killer Sleeveless Potential.

                                  ADAM
                    Well, I think Brett deserves one 
                    for his effort.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                  Workaholics 104 - Revised Network Draft - 4/2/10        5.

      CONTINUED: (2)

      As Brett comes out from under the desk, he takes the shirt 
      from Adam.  MONTEZ pops in.

                                  MONTEZ
                    So, that s how it s gonna be?  This 
                    nerd shows up for one day to do my 
                    job and I m here everyday and I 
                    never get a tee shirt?

                                  ANDERS
                    Montez you re not an IT guy.

                                  MONTEZ
                    But I m the king of web videos.  
                    Who put you on that Chocolate Rain 
                    tip?  Who hit y all with that GIF 
                    where the penguin falls through the 
                    ice?  And that Leroy Jenkins shit?  
                    That was next level.

                                  ADAM
                    That video is like three years old.

                                  MONTEZ
                    So you don t respect the classics?  
                    What s next, you gonna buttfuck 
                    Mozart?

      Adam TOSSES him a shirt.  Montez is touched.

                                  MONTEZ (CONT D)
                          (sincerely)
                     Preciate it.

      Montez exits.  Brett is finally not blocked in and makes his 
      way out.

                                  BRETT
                    You guys should be all set.  Have a 
                    good one.

      Brett exits.  Adam KICKS the shirt box back under his desk.

                                  ADAM
                          (to Blake)
                    So who s ready to get their dope 
                    camping trip on?

                    We re all set to go -- brought some 
                      super-shrooms that Karl got from 
                    Chico.  I m talking Mario Brothers.

                                  ADAM
                    The third one?  Where you get the 
                    tail?  I didn t think graphics 
                    could get that better. 

                                  BLAKE
                    Well they did, and you didn t get 
                    the tail from a mushroom, you got 
                    it from a leaf, Game Genie.

      ALICE arrives.  Blake JAMS the shrooms under his shirt.

                    Hey, ladies, just stopping by to 
                    let you know that there s been a 
                    string of burglaries in the area.  
                    Waymond thinks someone stole CDs 
                    out of his trunk so if you see 
                      anything...

      Waymond arrives, but before he can speak...

                                  ALICE (CONT D)
                    Jesus, Waymond!  I m telling them.  
                    We re at Def Con 4 here because 
                    Waymond can t find his Cranberries 
                    mix CD.  

      Waymond walks off.

                    Every time with that guy.  
                    Whatever.  Lock up your cars.  
                    Actually you ll be alright.  I

      INT. OFFICE - LATER

      People leave for the day.  Alice gives a look over and hits 
      the lights to LOW before closing the door as she exits.

      A beat looking at the dead office, until pieces of it start 
      to move.  First, a CEILING TILE moves and Blake climbs out of 
      the ceiling.  Ders crawls out from a DESK.  Then, Adam 
      appears from a GARBAGE CAN.  The guys excitedly dash out of 
      frame together...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. OFFICE - GUYS  CUBICLE - LATER

      The guys have transformed their cubicle into a dope fort with 
      sheets, sleeping bags, etc.  Ders is fitting sheets over his  
      queen-sized AIR-MATTRESS, complete with accordion bed frame.  

                                  BLAKE
                      Somebody s too good to sleep on the 
                    floor?

                                  ANDERS
                    Yeah, way too good.

                                  ADAM
                    Why you being such a bugaboo, Dirk 
                    Furious?

                                  ANDERS
                    I think I m answering your question 
                    when I say, because the floor is 
                    gross and when I drag my foot 
                    across the carpet, clippings of 
                    your fingernails pop up.

                                  BLAKE
                    Hey, man, that s camping.  It would 
                    mean a lot to me if you would rough 
                    it with us.  A lot.

                                  ANDERS
                    Well, it s not happening.

                                  ADAM
                    Well, this is happening.

      Adam JUMPS up onto the bed pulling the sheets up and 
      terrifying Anders.  Blake joins in, jumping around.

      As Ders and Adam start to tussle, Blake realizes Ders is 
      really pissed and breaks it up.

                                  BLAKE
                    Guys!  Whoa!  What are we doing?  
                    This could and probably will be the 
                    best night of our lives.  Let s 
                    make it that kind of party and 
                    stick our dicks in the mashed 
                    potatoes.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      INT. OFFICE - GUYS  CUBICLE/TENT - LATER

      The guys sit inside a TENT sipping booze from coffee cups.  
      Adam holds his CELL PHONE UNDER HIS CHIN, for scary story 
      effect.

                                  ADAM
                    ... and it ended up that the whole 
                    entire camp... was haunted. 

      Ders studies Adam, confused.  Clearly the story was retarded.

                    Tell it again, but this time on 
                    shrooms.

      Blake holds up a bag of mushrooms.  

                                  ANDERS
                    Please don t.  I don t need to hear 
                    about a dude getting raped with a

                    Ders, you think you can handle one?

                                  ADAM
                    I think Ders should go beddie-bye 
                    on his giant dope tampoon and let 
                    us wolves howl at the moon like we

                    You have a beautiful mind.

      INT. OFFICE - HALLWAYS/EMPTY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

      The guys tip-toe towards the wide open front door looking 
      over their shoulders.  The coast is clear, so they dart for 
      it!  WAIT!  The Burglars enter the door without seeing the 
      dudes.  SHIT!  The guys DIVE into an empty office.

                                  ANDERS
                    Oh my god.  We re dead.  We re

                    No one s gonna murder us, Ders.

                      repeatedly in the face and body and 
                    left for dead.

                    The entire building is locked.  
                    That s the only way out.  The guy 
                    had a gun.

                    Thieves are like cockroaches.  You 
                    see two, there s dozens where they 
                    came from.

      Ders strokes his ear at the mention of ROACHES, as Adam peeks 
      around the corner.

                                  BLAKE
                    Guys, I ve got it.  Here s the 
                    plan.  It s so simple, so obvious, 
                    that they ll never see it coming.  
                    The roof.

                                  BLAKE
                    No fire escape, but I do have a way 
                    out.  You might remember the 
                    classic tale by...  Wait, who wrote

                                  BLAKE
                    No, Rapunzel.  That s where the 
                    word repel comes from, but it s the 
                    same thing.

      Anders and Blake UNDRESS.  Adam looks over the EDGE, 
      realizing how high up they are.

                                  ADAM
                    I could definitely jump this and

                    about you guys and I know that I m

                    That s splendid.

      As Ders and Blake tie their clothes together Adam undresses 
      to REVEAL that under his clothing, he s wearing SPANX 
      (women s compression underwear that give shape to unshapely 
      ladies).  Ders and Blake stare.

                                  ADAM
                    What?  They re called Spanx.  I 
                    haven t had time to hit the gym 
                    lately, OK?!  It s been a tough 
                    quarter and you know I m a stress-
                    eater.

      Adam devours more shrooms.

                                  BLAKE
                    Dude, you re stress-eating some 
                    high grade shit.  We need you 
                    focused.

                    Wait, we didn t--

      Adam HEAVES the clothing rope over the edge.  What he forgot 
      to do is tie one end to something on the roof.

      The rope SAILS down to the ground in SLOW MO.

                                  BLAKE
                    It s beautiful.

      Blake dips back into the cubicle and we REVEAL that the guys 
      are now dressed in the CHEESY XXXL COMPANY TEE SHIRTS FROM 
      1997 from the box under Adam s desk.  They look like mom

      chest, and PULLS his shirt over his knees like a scared boy,

                    Let the shrooms do what they do.

                    It s a text.

      Adam chomps a couple more shrooms...

                    I know.

                    people s first trip.  Just think of 
                    a happy place.

      Blake sends his text.  Adam finds a window that CRACKS OPEN!

                    We re in business, bro.  The window

      Blake runs to the window.

      WITH DERS:

      He reads Blake s text, but he s too scared to be furious.  He 
      frantically TEXTS BACK.

      WITH ADAM AND BLAKE:

      Adam is boosting Blake to the window.  Blake s phone RINGS 
      and he checks it as Adam holds him up.

                    and the robber slits people s

                    It s the prophecy.  It was foretold

                    cool would it be to deny the

      INT. OFFICE - HALLWAYS - MOMENTS LATER

      Crouched on the floor at the edge of a corner, Blake sits 
      with Adam, who s SUPER HIGH and applying MAKE-UP from one of 
      Alice s compacts.  Blake takes the compact and uses it to 
      peek around the corner.  Through the mirror we see the 
      Burglars entering a room.  Blake draws the mirror back.

                                  BLAKE
                    The server room?
                          (to self)
                    What are these guys up to?

      Blake slips past Adam to get a closer look.  Adam cautiously 
      follows, looking very pretty.

      They look in the door and find Burglars LINKING A LAPTOP to 
      the NETWORK SERVER TOWER (which we saw earlier during the 
      guys  trip).  The laptop makes a BEEP, and numbers start 
      RAPIDLY SCROLLING, painting the walls with it s light.

                                    BURGLAR #2
                    Jackpot.

      Adam and Blake pull back.

      INT. OFFICE - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Anders is startled when the DOOR OPENS.  He hears footsteps 
      approaching and he braces for a fight to the death.  The 
      stall door OPENS and he shields his face with one arm and 
      FLAILS the other in defense.

      Adam and Blake stand before him.  They find this very sad.  
      Anders notices them.

                                  ANDERS
                    You came back!  I almost killed 
                    you.  Get in here, get in here! 

      Adam and Blake cram into the stall and lock the door.

                                  BLAKE
                    Are you okay?

                                  ADAM
                    I ve been nothing but worried.

                                  ANDERS
                    I never should have left you.  You 
                    guys are my rocks.

      Adam wraps some TOILET PAPER around his hand and passes it to  
      Ders.  Ders WIPES his eyes.

      INT. OFFICE - LATER

      Blake displays some blueprints that he s sketched out.  
      Anders examines them.

                    This is my Criminal Catcher.  It s 
                    the American Gladiator Eliminator 
                    mixed with all the laser parts from 
                      Entrapment.  The Catherine Zeta-

      Adam appears from nowhere.

                          (super serious)

                    Catherine Zeta Jooooones.  She dips 
                    beneath lasers.  Ooooh whooooa.

      Adam s SINGING carries us and continues over a...

      MONTAGE:

      The guys set up the Criminal Catcher as Blake narrates.  
      Throughout, we ll INTERCUT with in INSERT of Blake s 
      blueprints.

      1.  Blake sits at the OFFICE PA MIC and plugs in his iPod.

                                  BLAKE (V.O.)
                    I ll get on the PA to get their 
                      attention, then using Adam as bait, 
                    we lure them through our gauntlet.

      2.  Ders and Adam position laser pointers on desks creating a 
      laser mine-field, a la Entrapment.  






                                                                              (CONTINUED)                  Workaholics 104 - Revised Network Draft - 4/2/10        26.

      CONTINUED:

      In his stapled XXXL tee, Blake crawls back through the laser 
      mine-field, under a low laser, ass in the air (think the 
      booty shot in the Entrapment trailer).  Blake looks back for 
      approval.  The guys give a reluctant thumbs up, kind of 
      grossed out.
 

                                  BLAKE (V.O.)
                    First up the laser jungle...

                                  ANDERS (V.O.)
                    What s that supposed to do?

                                  BLAKE (V.O.)
                      ...Physically?  Nothing.  Mentally?  
                    Total destruction.

      3.  Blake SHAKES soda cans, tapes them to the wall, and fixes 
      strings to their pull tabs.  Then strings the lines across 
      the hallway like tripwires.

                                  BLAKE (V.O.)
                    Then there s the tripwires linked 
                    to soda can tabs, which will get 
                    them all wet and slippery,...

                                  ADAM (V.O.)
                    That s cool.

      4.  Blake ties strings to the ceiling.  At the other end is a 
      water jug set atop a cubicle wall.  Blake PUSHES it and it 
      SWINGS right past Adam.  Close call.

                                  BLAKE (V.O.)
                    ... then Adam triggers the water 
                    jug pendulums of death.

      5.  All the guys weave netting out of Ethernet cords.

                                  BLAKE (V.O.)
                    If that doesn t end them, they ll 
                    be caught in our Ether-Net, which, 
                    you guessed it, is a net of 
                    Ethernet cables.

                                  ANDERS (V.O.)
                    Where do you learn this stuff?

      6.  Blake sharpens broom sticks with his Swiss Army knife.  
      Rigs them to pop up, pulls the lever and it works.  It s 
      actually super deadly.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                  Workaholics 104 - Revised Network Draft - 4/2/10        27.

                    I m an avid reader.  Anyway, if 
                    these guys are Super Shredder 
                    status and happen to get through 
                    all that, I ll be ready and waiting 
                    to engage our last line of defense; 
                    sharpened broom sticks that pop up 
                    like in Braveheart.

                                  ANDERS (V.O.)
                    Let s do it!

      END MONTAGE.

      INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

      Blake holds the office PA system mic in one hand, and his 
      iPod in the other.  Ders is on lookout, spying on the 
      burglars.  Adam is in the corner mumbling to himself, totally 
      out of it.  Blake plays DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince s 
      Nightmare On My Street over the PA.  

      ANGLE ON:  Burglars down the hall disconnecting computers, 
      etc.

                                  BLAKE
                          (robotic voice, into PA)
                    Warning!  You have activated the 
                    laser alarm system.  These are not 
                    laser pointers, they are real 
                    lasers that can burn through flesh.

      ANGLE ON:  The Burglars look around, confused, alarmed.

      Blake continues...

                    You might think it s weird we have 
                    such an elaborate security system--

      Ders swings back in the doorway and waves his hands at Blake, 
      like,  No, stop! 

                                  BLAKE (CONT D)
                          (into PA, no robo)
                    Anyway, you should be pretty 
                    freaked out.

      Just then, his iPod shuffles over to the Y all Ready For 
      This?! song.  He fumbles to shut it off.

      From out of nowhere, Adam RUSHES the burglars with a fire 
      extinguisher.

                                  ADAM
                      Leeeeeeeroy Jenkins!

      ( Leroy Jenkins!  is an allusion to a hilarious web 
      phenomenon of the same name.  Google dat.) Adam sprays the 
      Burglars in the face with the extinguisher, dowsing them in 
      white foam.  They fall to the floor, blinded, crawling on 
      their hands and knees, coughing.

      As Ders and Adam rush over...

                                  ANDERS
                    God damn it, Leroy!

                                  ADAM
                    Sorry, I had to do it.  I m kind of 
                      a maverick and I just don t give a 
                    shoot.  DO YOU FEEL ME?!

      Ders looks annoyed, but then can t help but smile.

                                  ANDERS
                    I feel you, in a major way, black 
                    hero.

      It was a pretty good move.  All the guys hi-five.  The 
      Burglars start to gather themselves.

                                  BLAKE
                    We should probably tie those guys 
                    up or something.

      INT. OFFICE - GUYS  CUBICLE - LATER

      The Burglars sit, their hands tied behind their backs, faces 
      still covered in white foam from the extinguisher.  Adam, 
      Ders, and Blake stand around them, shining a desk lamp in 
      their faces, interrogation-style.

                                  ADAM
                    So you thought you could just come 
                    in here and throw down on our turf, 
                    is that what you thought?!

                    Looks like the one thing you forgot 
                    to expect... was the unexpected.

                                    BURGLAR #1
                    Like I said, I m just tech support, 
                    I met you like six hours ago.  This 
                    is my partner, Corey.

      Ders wipes the burglar s face off, and we see that it is 
      indeed BRETT, the tech support guy from earlier.

                                  ANDERS
                    Very clever.  So you come in during 
                    the day, hidden in plain sight to 
                    case the joint.  Then come back 
                    after hours to close the deal.

                                  BLAKE
                    You will not get the codes and you 
                    will tell us what Joe Biden is 
                    after!

      The Tech Guys cover their heads.

                                  COREY
                    Please just don t hurt us.

                                  ANDERS
                    Us hurt you?  You re the ones who 
                    were bragging about slitting 
                    people s throats.  Yeah, I was in 
                    the bathroom with you and you 
                    didn t even know it.

                                  BRETT
                          (kinda creeped out)
                    I was talking about Assassin s 
                    Creed 2.

                                  ADAM
                    I don t care whose creed it is, 
                    life is precious!

                                  BRETT
                    AC2 is a video game.  We re not 
                    here for any codes.

                    Trust us, there is nothing of value

      Corey and Brett share a snicker.

                                  BRETT
                    We re just here to reboot the

      Adam, Ders, Blake, and the IT guys are all tripping balls, 
      lying together on Ders  air mattress, looking up at the 
      ceiling, which is COMPLETELY COVERED IN GLOW-IN-THE-DARK STAR 
      STICKERS that Blake put up earlier.  They lay in an amazed

      INT. OFFICE - MONDAY (DAY TWO)

      UPBEAT MUSIC plays as Waymond strolls happily into the 
      office.  He waves  hello  to a few people, and gives the 
      finger guns to Montez. 

                                  MONTEZ
                    Hey, I heard your insurance covered 
                    the break-in.  Funny how things 
                    work out.  You get that soldier-
                          coming-home-to-a-crying-dog video I 
                    sent out.  It s all about them 
                      laugh-cries in 2010.

      Waymond nods  yes  and continues on.  Waymond drops some 
      papers off in an inbox with a flourish and waves to more 
      coworkers.  Still whistling, when out of nowhere, a water-jug 
      comes flying at him and BLASTS HIM IN THE FACE.  He doubles 
      over in pain, and softly cries to himself.

                                                                          FADE OUT:
