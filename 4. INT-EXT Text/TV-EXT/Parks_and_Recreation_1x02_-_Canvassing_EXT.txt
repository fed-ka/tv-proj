                Okay -- I ve got bottled water, everyone 
                take one.  Stay hydrated.  Here s some 
                  sunscreen for your beaks -- Tom, you 
                probably don t need any -- and everyone 
                take a packet of gorp.

                Leslie s incredible.  She has the energy 
                of a 10-year old.
                      (holds up gorp)
                And the same taste in snacks.

                that my boyfriend fell into a giant pit.  
                Maybe Leslie and I should start shoving

                  playground for children at this park?  Or

                Also, will this park be at least one 
                thousand yards from my place?   Cause I 
                really don t want to have to move again.

                put an awesome new park on the abandoned

                Sorry, I need to change her.  If you have 
                a flier or something, you can leave it.

  SPY SHOT: Five or six KIDS crowd Tom s VAN.  They tighten 
  into a circle.

                              TOM
                Okay.  Looking good out there, guys.

                              DUKIE
                Mr. Haverford, one lady bought a 
                  chocolate but then she ate it and said it 
                tasted bad and wanted her money back.

                              TOM
                Come on!  You gotta leave before they eat 
                it.  And do not call the bars 
                   chocolate,   cause legally they don t 
                contain the right ingredients.  Okay -- 
                break s over.  Go.

  Tom gives them high-fives all around, and the kids run off in 
  various directions.  Tom turns, notices the camera.  Caught.

  TOM TALKING HEAD

                              TOM
                It s a youth basketball team I coach.

  He looks nervous.  JUMP CUT.

                              TOM (CONT D)
                Fine, it s kids selling candy door-to-
                door.  It s a good deal for them.  They 
                get exercise, they re outside, and I 
                split the profits fifty-fifty, with a 
                small twenty percent commission, which I 
                also get.  It s like sports, with candy.  
                For money.


  The team has reconvened, minus Tom.

                                LESLIE
                Okay, Tom called me a second ago and said 
                he was doing great, so I told him to keep 
                at it.  For the rest of us: new strategy.

                Ha ha.  Goal readjustment: we concentrate 
                on each getting just one park supporter 
                to that forum.  If you change one mind,

                three more minds, that s nine minds, 
                right?  Plus the original three.  Pretty

                Yes, I am currently a canvassing team of 
                one.  But when a government employee is 
                among her people, she can never be 
                lonely.  In times like these, I always 
                think: W-W-M-M-D.  What Would My Mom Do?
                      (thinks)
                ...She d call my mom!
                      (takes out phone, then)
                No.  She d figure it out on her own.

                So, you ve worked with Leslie for a

                Yeah. I used to be as optimistic as 
                Leslie when I first started.  She s kept

                It s the main problem with the business 
                model.  You give a kid candy to sell, 
                he s gonna be tempted.  What s the

                      (holds up slice of white bread)
                Hundred calories, tons of carbs for that 
                  long-lasting power boost, and none of 
                that healthy taste kids hate.  Plus, it 
                expands in their stomachs, so they fill 
                up quick.  For the huskier kids--

  From outside, we see Ann hanging out in Leslie s office, 
  eating gorp.  Leslie looks pleased.

  Ann comes home, wiped out.  She notices something propped 
  against the door.  Picks it up.

  It s a new ROCK BAND BASS GUITAR, with a RIBBON and a NOTE 
  attached.  She opens the envelope.  Reads it, smiles 
  slightly.

  She brings the bass inside.
