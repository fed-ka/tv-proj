Weaving through traffic on the bridge.
ROPER (V.O.)
Where's the damn wire?!
TRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
Here comes the wire... and...
Backtrack gets up in the last jump.
Cozy girl a very game second.
ROPER (V.O.)
SHIT!
The Trans Am streak off toward the city.
A hostage situation. Police barricades. Dozens of squad cars,
ambulances, spectators, SWAT team. It's a stalemate. Roper's
Trans Am pulls to a stop at the barricades. He hops out,
weaves through the spectators and past the barriers.
A FEMALE DETECTIVE, EIKO KIMURA, rushes up to him.
KIMURA
Hi, Roper.
ROPER
Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
Kimura points to the diner in the middle of the block. Roper
heads toward it. As they walk Kimura briefs him...
KIMURA
The suspect came in shortly after
the bank opened. Botched robbery. A
teller hit the silent alarm. He took
seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard.
He's still alive. So far he's asked
for...
ROPER
...a car.
KIMURA
That's right, and a plane waiting at
the airport. If he doesn't...
ROPER
...get 'em, he's going to start
shooting hostages in five minutes...
KIMURA
That's right.
ROPER
What's the suspect's name?
KIMURA
Earl.
Roper eats the donut as he crosses toward the bank.
A team of two SWAT TEAM MEMBERS, FORBES IS A SPOTTER AND
MCCALL IS A SHARPSHOOTER. KEVIN MCCALL, is the one we're
interested in. He's 25 years old, handsome, all American.
He's the best the SWAT team has.
He crouches motionless, staring through the scope of his
rifle, watching as Roper calmly walks toward the bank.
FORBES
What do you think he's got in the
bag?
MCCALL
Donuts.
FORBES
You can't take a guy down with a
donut.
Roper drags the guard out the front door and deposits him on
the sidewalk. Two SWAT OFFICERS rush up to give aid. One of
them is Jennings.
ROPER
(whispering to Jennings)
Give me your gun.
(NOTE: The method of disarming Earl is still to be determined)
Jennings inconspicuously pulls his gun out and slips it to
him. Roper quickly cocks it and shoves it in his waistband
under his shirt and vest.
ROPER
I haven't had to shoot anyone in
three years.
JENNINGS
Why not keep the streak alive?
ROPER
Because this strung-out junkie is
too stupid to get out of this without
killing somebody.
McCall and Forbes watch through their rifle scopes as the
two released hostages are whisked away by uniformed cops.
FORBES
This guy is good.
MCCALL
That's what they say.
McCall and Forbes still have their rifles trained on the
bank door. Their police radio squawks...
RADIO
The situation is secured. Suspect in
custody. Repeat. Situation secured.
McCall lowers his rifle as Roper guides Debbie through the
wave of cops rushing into the bank.
Roper is exiting the bank and putting back on his gun when
he hears the sound of a CAMERA SHUTTER. He turns to see
VERONICA (RONNIE) TATE holding the camera. She snaps one of
Roper with Earl in the b.g. being placed in a squad car.
RONNIE
There's one for the front page.
Roper puts his hand over his heart as if stricken with love...
which he in fact is.
ROPER
Ronnie, why are you torturing me? I
can't live without you.
Ronnie rolls her eyes. She doesn't take Roper all that
seriously.
RONNIE
Don't start.
She slings the camera over her shoulder and starts to walk
off. Roper dogs her.
ROPER
This baseball player you're going
out with...
(shaking his head)
He's no good for you.
RONNIE
Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He
makes two million a year, and he
worships me.
ROPER
I worship you.
RONNIE
You worship yourself.
ROPER
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
RONNIE
Greg.
ROPER
Did you know he's already got a bad
knee? In another 10 years you're
going to be pushing him around in a
wheelchair.
Ronnie stops. Looks him in the eye.
RONNIE
You know what I think? I think you
only want me now, because I'm with
somebody else.
ROPER
Who cares what you think. I want you
back and that's all that matters.
Ronnie smiles, but offers no response.
ROPER
Let me take you out tomorrow night...
Pleeease.
RONNIE
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
ROPER
(frowning)
This Greg is really getting in my
way.
Roper gets down on his knees.
ROPER
Please. I'm begging you.
RONNIE
Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
She takes the lense cap off her camera. Roper primps his
hair to make sure he looks good for the picture... CLICK!
Suddenly Roper notices that his Trans Am is being towed. He
rushes over to his car.
ROPER
Hey, that's my car.
A REPO MAN stands off to the side watching dispassionately.
REPO MAN
Not anymore. Now it belongs to Silver
Hills Financial.
Roper sadly watches the tow truck drive off with his beloved
Trans Am.
The pickup in traffic.
OMITTED
Sequence omitted from original script.
It's a four story twenties style walk-up. It's evening now.
The pickup pulls to a stop out front.
Korda calmly exits the building as Roper crosses the street,
returning from the payphone. Neither of the men take any
particular notices of each other. A WOMAN carrying her
groceries enters the building.
Roper gets to the truck. A SCREAM from inside the building.
Roper burst out the front. Down the stairs to the sidewalk.
Looks both ways down the street... Realizes in dismay that
Korda is long gone. A SIREN approaches.
Roper's pickup drives by.
A huge warehouse. Sun coming up over the East Bay, CLARENCE
TEAL rides up on a HARLEY MOTORCYLE, carrying a large cup of
coffee to go. He enters the warehouse.
The pickup is weaving through traffic.
Several Patrol Cars are parked in front of an unappealing
apartment building. A crowd has begun to gather. UNIFORMED
POLICEMEN hold them back. TWO COPS are questioning a man
wearing only green slacks. No shirt. No shoes. Just the
slacks. He is very agitated.
The pickup screeches up. Roper and McCall hop out. Roper
flashes his badge to the OFFICER in charge. (OFFICER #1)
ROPER
Roper. Metro Division. Hostage
Negotiator. Give me the short version.
OFFICER #1
Husband came home. Found that guy
and his wife "in flagrante". Now
he's holding her at knife point.
ROPER
Which apartment?
The Officer points up to the third floor.
OFFICER #1
That one with the bars on the windows.
Roper nods. Walks back over to the pickup. Looks up. Eyeballs
the building.
ROPER
How are we gonna get him out of there?
MCCALL
We could fill it with water.
Roper throws him a look. McCall walks to the back of the
pickup, reaches into the cab and digs around in his duffel
bag.
ROPER
(to Officer #1)
Have you evacuated anyone?
OFFICER #1
Only that floor.
ROPER
Is the hostage injured?
OFFICER #1
Don't know. She keeps screaming to
stay out. He keeps screaming to stay
out. We decided to stay out.
ROPER
Well, there's a good amount of
agreement on that.
McCall slams the truck door, sniper rifle in hand.
MCCALL
I'll take "highground" until SWAT
gets here.
(surveying the area)
I can get a good sight-line from
that roof across the street.
McCall marches off across the street.
ROPER
Remember, Quick Draw, we're trying
to limit the force here.
McCall calls back over his shoulder.
MCCALL
I know my job.
At that moment, a scream echoes down from the third floor
window. Roper heads for the front door of the building.
In prone position. Rifle in hand. Eye to scope.
POV THROUGH SIGHT
of Raymond's open window.
McCall comes across the street. Roper sees McCall, cool as
ever. Rifle slung over his shoulder. Roper steps into his
path.
ROPER
WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
McCall gives no answer. He pushes past Roper and continues
into the building.
Beautiful day. Roper and McCall leaning against the rail at
the walking ring. The horses are being paraded and saddled.
Roper scrutinizes them with an expert eye. McCall seems
totally disinterested.
ROPER
You know why I like the track?
MCCALL
You're a compulsive gambler?
Roper ignores that.
ROPER
Because there are a multitude of
possibility's. Everything is there
to see if you know what to look for.
You have to read the conditions,
just like in a hostage situation.
Roper points across the ring to a particular horse.
ROPER
See the four horse. Dropping in class.
No works. Front wraps. Looks like
he's broken down. But notice the
woman in the sun hat. She's the owner.
She wouldn't have come if her horse
was broken down. He's live. We use
him.
McCall listens indifferently.
ROPER
See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He
doesn't want to run today. Cross him
off... Now the Six looks good. On
his toes. Coat shiny. This
trainer/jockey combo does well. We
can't leave him out.
(turns to McCall)
What do you think?
MCCALL
I have two words for you... Seek
help.
ROPER
I have three words for you... Ex-ac-
ta.
Roper and McCall pass by a gambler.
GAMBLER
Hey, Roper.
ROPER
How you doin', Marv?
They sit down in a box right up front.
ROPER
We need the 4 and 6 to finish to
first and second.
MCCALL
(no enthusiasm)
Fine.
Roper uses his binoculars to watch the horses warm up on the
backstretch.
MCCALL
I'm told that newspaper photographer
is your former girlfriend.
Roper looks over at him. What's this about?
ROPER
Ronnie... Yeah, so.
MCCALL
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
ROPER
So what do you want?... An autograph.
MCCALL
I don't know why she'd pick him over
you.
Roper throws McCall a skeptical look.
MCCALL
(straight-faced)
I'm just practicing my lying.
ROPER
Still needs work.
MCCALL
(downcast)
You're right. I'll never be as good
a liar as you.
TRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
And they're racing!
ON THE TRACK
The horses spring from the gate. (The track announcer's call
plays through race)
IN THE STANDS
Roper watches intently through the binoculars. McCall sits
impassively.
ROPER
Okay, we're in good shape. We're in
good shape.
McCall looks across the track.
MCCALL
The 6 horse is last.
ROPER
That's okay. That's his style.
MCCALL
To run last?
ROPER
To run late!
Roper follows the horses into the turn.
ROPER
The favorite's fading. I told you he
wasn't going to run today... The
four horse has got the lead!
McCall sits like a wax figure.
MCCALL
(cynically)
The 6 horse is still last.
ROPER
He'll be running at the quarter pole.
ON THE TRACK
The horses head into the stretch. The FOUR is on the lead
and the SIX is starting to unleash a big run. Passing horses
with every stride.
ROPER (V.O.)
There he goes.
IN THE STANDS
McCall sits forward slightly.
MCCALL
They need to run first and second?
ROPER
Yeah, first and second.
Roper gets to his feet.
ON THE TRACK
The horses thunder down the stretch. The FOUR horse is in
front and the SIX is coming on from behind.
IN THE STANDS
Roper is on his feet screaming.
ROPER
Come on, Russell! Come on, Russell.
McCall jumps to this feet and joins him.
MCCALL
COME ON RUSSELL!...
(to Roper)
Who the fuck's Russell?!
ROPER
The jockey!
MCCALL
COME ON, RUSSELL!
Roper and McCall cheer together.
ON THE TRACK
The FOUR horse crosses the finish line in front. The SIX
horse is flying... Needs to beat one horse to be second...
He's running out of room... With one last surge he hits the
wire and... It's too close to call.
IN THE STANDS
McCall, really excited, turns to Roper.
MCCALL
We won!
ROPER
(disheartened)
We lost.
MCCALL
(confidently)
We won.
ROPER
How much you wanna bet?
MCCALL
You want to bet on whether you won
your bet? This is getting sick.
ANGLE ON TOTE BOARD
As the photo finish light goes out and the numbers come on...
4-6-8. They won.
IN THE STANDS
ROPER
Yes!
High fives.
ROPER
That's eight hundred bucks.
Marble facade. Tastefully reinforced windows and door.
Choppers circle overhead. Both ends of the street are sealed
off. Barricades are up. Spectators and news crews crowd behind
those. Numerous police circulate. This is a major operation
in full swing.
Roper and McCall push through the barricades and come walking
down the cordoned-off street. McCall takes a look at the
jewelry store. Well fortified, foreboding.
MCCALL
This does not look good.
Roper looks over there, gives no reaction. They reach Solis'
convertible Cadillac. It's parked out front of the travel
agency building.
ROPER
See this. Solis has me driving the
shit-mobile, and he picked this up
straight out of impound for fourteen
grand. Probably worth thirty.
MCCALL
Police corruption. It's everywhere.
Roper, bulletproof vest, hands in the air, walks across the
eerily deserted street straight toward the jewelry store.
It's quiet now. The choppers have been pulled back.
Roper reaches the sidewalk right in front of the store. Korda
cracks the door open.
KORDA
(warningly)
Stay there.
Roper stops in his tracks.
ROPER
I'm going to put my hands down, okay.
Roper slowly lowers his hands.
Korda takes a half step out the doorway. The gloved hand
that is visible is not holding a weapon. The other half of
his body is hidden inside the doorway. He wears jeans, a
black shirt, and black Nike tennis shoes. He stares fiercely
from behind the ski mask. There's no sign of fear in him.
KORDA
Are you in charge, Roper?
ROPER
Yep.
KORDA
I want a car. Like a four wheel drive.
I want it in perfect condition. I
want a uniformed cop to drive it up
right here. I want him to leave the
engine running and walk to the end
of the street. Then we'll come out.
I don't want any remote control
devices in it. I know all the tricks.
If it's not in perfect condition,
and I mean if its even low on wiper
fluid, I'm going to kill somebody
and we're gonna start again.
Korda lets that sink in.
KORDA
I want a plane waiting at the airport.
I'll tell them where I want to go
when I get there.
ROPER
Is that all?
KORDA
For now that's all.
ROPER
You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you
to do something for me. Let me take
a look around inside. Make sure
everybody's okay.
KORDA
No. You just do shit for me right
now.
Korda's eyes glare from behind the ski mask. He's an ominous
figure.
ROPER
Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think
you could give me something to cement
the deal... One hostage.
KORDA
I'll give you something.
Korda pulls a wadded-up handkerchief out of his pocket and
tosses it to Roper. Roper unwraps the handkerchief.
DETAIL SHOT
It's a human ear.
KORDA
In fifteen minutes it'll be a bigger
piece. I assume there are no
"misunderstanding".
Roper is as serious as we've ever seen him.
ROPER
I understand you completely.
Korda disappears back behind the door.
Roper trudges back in. Things are more active now. Logistical
officers are making flow charts. Photos of the hostages are
being posted on a bulletin board. Roper approaches Solis,
McCall and the SWAT CAPTAIN who are anxiously waiting for
his report.
ROPER
(flatly)
We're going to have to take this guy
out.
That draws a long silence. That's something Roper rarely
says.
SOLIS
Can't we wear him down?
Roper hands Solis the handkerchief with the ear in it. Solis
eyes it with dismay.
ROPER
I believe there's at least one
fatality in there already. The fire
alarm was probably set off by gunfire.
I believe he's working alone, both
from his conversation and the fact
that he wouldn't come out beyond the
doorway. He was holding a gun on the
hostages while he was talking to me.
His demeanor is calm and controlled,
that's what really scares me. The
other bad news is that he also
indicated a familiarity with our
techniques.
(a beat)
So, do you want to go in or wait for
him to come out?
McCall calmly offers his opinion.
MCCALL
Let him come out. Too many unknowns
in there.
Solis nods. That'll be the plan.
MCCALL
When we drive up the car, make sure
it's at an angle about three feet
from the curb.
(to SWAT Captain)
Put our best man "highground", Twenty
degree down angle.
The SWAT Captain motions and turns to one of his UNDERLINGS.
SWAT CAPTAIN
Have Anderson prep it and notify us
when he's on line.
The underling hurries off to take care of it. Solis looks at
Roper dejectedly.
SOLIS
I feel this thing going sideways on
us.
Roper tries to buck him up.
ROPER
There is some good news. He's wearing
a ski mask, so he's protecting his
identity and hasn't determined to
kill all the hostages...
(big pause)
Yet.
Cops clear spectators out of the way as a green FORD EXPLORER
RUMBLES through the barricade and heads down the deserted
street.
Another sharpshooting team. Poised. Waiting.
And still another sharpshooter team.
A sniper watches through his scope. Finger poised on the
trigger.
ANGLE THROUGH THE SCOPE
Low visibility through the haze. The figure in the ski mask
wavers in and out of the crosshairs, shielded momentarily by
the jeweler, then he flashes back into the crosshairs. The
sniper tries to lock him in.
The Explorer comes barreling toward it. Spectators scatter.
Two squad cars SCREECH up behind the barricades, trying to
block Korda's escape. The Explorer PLOWS through the metal
barricades. BASHES the squad cars out of the way. And screams
off around the corner.
OMITTED
Sequence omitted from original script.
The Explorer careens up an alley and bursts into the congested
traffic of a side street. HONK-SCREECH! A Toyota swerves to
miss it and broadsides a parked car. The Explorer fishtails
off down the street.
The Cadillac is only about a hundred feet behind the van...
Brakes SQUEALING, it swerves around the corner in pursuit.
THE VAN
hits the top of the hill and goes airborne... SLAMS back
down to the pavement.
The Cadillac roars around the corner and heads up the hill.
The brakes are stressed.
Now driverless, the cable car picks up speed... Broadsides a
car... Pushing it into parked cars...
THE CABLE CAR
Korda and the remaining passengers are rocked around.
THE CABLE CAR
THUNDERS towards us... Filling the FRAME...
A SIDE ANGLE
Shows the cable car leaving the wreckage in its wake.
CADILLAC
It passes the smashed car. McCall looks at the speedometer
as he paces the cable car. It's going at 45 mph.
MCCALL
What the fuck is going on.
ROPER
I don't know, but I've got to get on
there.
MCCALL
You're crazy.
ROPER
Pull up alongside.
The cable car barrels through... Plows into two cross-traffic
cars... Knocks them aside... Keeps picking up speed.
THE CADILLAC
Weaves through the wreckage... Makes up ground on the cable
car, trying to pull alongside.
THE CABLE CAR
For the moment, Korda is not shooting at the Caddy. His
attention is now focused downhill as...
KORDA'S POV
The cable car nails another vehicle sending it spinning off
to the side.
THE CADDY
dodges the spinning car... Jumps up onto the sidewalk...
Mows down parking meters... Jumps back onto the street.
THE CABLE CAR
Korda leans out the door, takes aim at the Caddy... Another
jammed intersection up ahead...
The Caddy collides with the front of the cable car. Tires
SCREAM. The steel wheels CLATTER. A cloud of burning rubber
forms. The cable car grinds forward pushing the Cadillac...
But it's working. The cable car is slowing.
BOTTOM OF STREET
The crowd now sees the Caddy and cable car bearing down on
them. General hysteria as they flee.
THE CABLE CAR
Korda regains consciousness. Sees what's going on. He grabs
the satchel and bails out of the cable car...
STREET
...Onto the hood of a passing taxi. The taxi slams on its
brakes. Korda rolls off the hood, picks himself up and runs
into an underground garage.
THE CABLE CAR
Grinding to a halt just short of the end of the line. Roper
grabs McCall's gun off the seat and leaps out of the Caddy
to pursue Korda. People approach to ogle the two vehicles in
astonishment.
A gray San Francisco evening. It starts to rain.
A subjective POV watching through the window as she moves
around the kitchen.
Through the window we watch her cross back to the stove.
Roper's pickup pulls up in front. He gets out. Paco jumps
out behind him. It's raining harder. They hurry up the walkway
toward the house. Suddenly Roper realizes he forgot the wine.
He goes back to the truck. Paco pads after him.
Roper opens the driver's side door, reaches in and grabs the
wine. He closes the door, starts away, but pauses to check
himself in the window.
Suddenly, a floodlight comes crashing through Ronnie's front
bay windows. It SPARKS and FLASHES. Still plugged in, it
bungees to a stop hallway down the front of the house.
FLICKERING and FLASHING.
Roper rushes toward the house... Crashes through the front
door... Up the stairway... Paco bounds after him... Roper
hits her front door running... Wham! He bounces off. He
shoulders it again... The door doesn't give... He pulls out
his gun... BAM! BAM! Shoots off the lock.
Raining more heavily now. Roper bursts out onto the back
porch. Sees Clarence leaping off the last rung of the fire
escape to the alley. Roper flies down the fire escape...
Vaults the last flight and races after Clarence.
Clarence sprints down the block... Through the intersection...
HONK! SCREECH! A car barely misses him. It does a one-eighty
on the rain-slick pavement. Clarence disappears into the
shadows. Roper arrives a beat later... Streaks through the
intersection... Into the shadows.
This one is steep. Clarence huffs and puffs as he labors. He
shoots into a doorway. Tries the door. Locked. He looks back.
Roper is coming. Relentless. He rushes across the steep
street. Almost slips on the reflective asphalt. Roper spots
him crossing and picks up the pace. He can see that Clarence
is faltering.
NEAR THE TOP OF THE HILL
Clarence staggers into an alleyway...
Narrow, dark and dripping with rain. Roper arrives at the
mouth of the alley. Gun ready, he moves cautiously, eyes
adjusting to the darkness. The PATTER of rain off the
rooftops. His FOOTSTEPS. No other sound.
He reaches the end of the alley... A brick wall. No way out.
Or so it would seem. However, Clarence is nowhere in sight.
Roper turns back. Brick walls tower on both sides, rising
into darkness. Roper checks a steel door. Locked. He checks
another one on the opposite side of the alley. Also locked.
Where did Clarence go? He moves back toward the misting light
of the street... Slowly...
The FAINT RATTLE of a fire escape... And Clarence leaps down
out of the shadow. Slashing with the knife. He catches Roper
across the arm.
Rips through his clothes right down to the skin. Roper's gun
CLATTERS under a parked car and into the street. Clarence
has first jump. He scrambles into the street, around the car
and grabs the gun...
Roper dives over the hood of the car and knocks Clarence
down before he can aim. They roll into the middle of the
street. Both have a death grip on the weapon. Clarence fights
like a trapped animal. Thrashing desperately. Roper pins him
on his back, but can't pry the gun out of his fingers.
WIDER SHOT
Headlights radiate over the crest of the hill. Coming quickly.
Roper sees this. He rolls out of the way, abandoning the
battle for the gun. Clarence struggles to his knees. Turns
the weapon on Roper... A speeding cab lunges over the top of
the hill. Clarence turns, trapped in the searing headlights.
Tires squeal. Brakes lock. Clarence is transfixed... WHAM!
He's launched through the air like a ragdoll... His body
lands limply 30 feet down the street. The CABBY gets out of
his vehicle.
CABBY
Jesus Christ. What was he doing?!
Roper walks down the hill to the body. The cabby follows.
CABBY
There was no way I could miss him.
Roper ignores the cabby. He looks down at Clarence's body,
contemplating something.
CABBY
This isn't my fault.
ROPER
Shut the fuck up!
The cabby immediately clams up.
ROPER
Get on your radio and get the police
here.
Roper stares at Clarence's body, steel-eyed.
A VETERAN wearing green fatigue is dangling another WHEELCHAIR
BOUND VET over the edge. Fourteen floors up. The two front
wheels are literally hanging out there in space.
VET #1
(rambling incoherently)
I can't fight this technology. They
have microprocessors made in totally
sterile environments. I've seen those
places. Everyone is dressed in white.
It's like paper clothing, man. They're
not even human.
Vet 2 is struggling to stay in the chair and not be tipped
into the street 150 feet below. He is, needless to say, very
panicky.
VET #2
Dave, don't do this, bro. Pull me
in. We'll do a few laps in the park
and figure out some other way.
But he's not getting through to his friend.
VET #1
I can't help this, man. Do you have
any idea what those microchips look
like? How small they are when they
put them in your brain?
McCall moves slowly across the tar paper roof. Clouds overhead
threaten rain. Vet 1 turns to him suddenly, wobbling the
wheelchair. Vet 2 shrieks and nearly goes over. McCall's
heart jumps into his mouth.
DAVE
Get the fuck out of here!
McCall is tense and stiff. He stammers.
MCCALL
I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help
you, D... Dave.
DAVE
You can't help me, man.
So much for McCall's opener. Now what?
WALTER
He's high on something, man. Give
him some thorazine or something.
Dave ignores Walter.
DAVE
No one can help me. They're
controlling my mind.
McCall moves a couple steps closer.
MCCALL
Who's controlling your mind?
DAVE
Whoa!... The government. They control
everybody's mind. You're too fucking
stupid to know that?
McCall fumbles for the right response.
MCCALL
This has nothing to do with Walter.
DAVE
They want Walter dead!
Cops keep spectators back from the building. Fire trucks and
rescue vehicles are on the scene. Everybody looking straight
up watching the wheelchair with its occupant dangling over
the side of the building.
Walter sits stock still in the wheelchair drenched with sweat,
eyes closed, praying.
MCCALL
Dave, look at me.
Dave obliges. He looks at McCall with eyes that have lost
the battle for sanity. McCall is momentarily frozen by those
eyes. Beads of sweat have formed on his forehead.
MCCALL
Tell me what's wrong.
DAVE
Particles, man. I feel them all the
time. I feel them in my arms and
legs man, that's how they punish me.
MCCALL
How can I help you with the particles?
DAVE
It's not just the particles man,
it's the whole fucking machine, this
is how they get assassins to operate.
It's been this way since the cuban
missile crisis.
Dave starts to look over into the street, he tips Walter
forward, Walter shrieks in mortal fear. White knuckles the
armrests of his wheelchair and then:
MCCALL
(blurting out)
They have less power over you if you
look into my eyes.
DAVE
Huh?
McCall even surprises himself with that one. It was a sheer
act of desperation. He holds his breath and waits to see
what the effect is. Dave turns back around.
DAVE
Huh?
Roper's truck comes speeding down the street, lurches to a
halt. He leaps out and speaks to a FIREMAN.
ROPER
Whata ya got?
FIREMAN
Some nuts dangling a guy over the
edge in a wheelchair.
ROPER
Can you get a net out here?
FIREMAN
Negative. It's 14 floors up. No nets
gonna hold a fall from that high up.
McCall nods slowly. Sweat pouring off him.
MCCALL
We've been onto them for a long time.
A glimmer from Dave. Maybe McCall is a kindred spirit.
MCCALL
Let me show you something.
Now he's got Dave's interest. McCall slowly takes out his
beeper.
MCCALL
See this. I'm jamming them, Dave.
I'm jamming their frequency so they
can't control your mind anymore.
Don't you feel that? You don't have
to do what they say.
Dave listens to his head.
WALTER
He's jamming them, Dave. Pull me
back in.
MCCALL
You see, the particles are gone,
they can't punish you anymore.
Dave tries to feel for particles. Tears form in Dave's eyes.
DAVE
Tell my dad.
MCCALL
Tell him what, what do you want me
to tell him?
DAVE
Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
MCCALL
I'll tell him. Where does he live.
We'll get him on the phone right
now.
Dave is suddenly lost in thought again. His expression turns
to a frown:
DAVE
I hate fucking Springfield.
MCCALL
Is that where you're family lives?
Then with sudden swiftness.
DAVE
I still hear them, man. You can't
jam them. They've got the technology,
man. They've got the satellites,
Jack. They keep shooting beams off
those satellites. What power do I
have?
Dave pushes the wheelchair forward. McCall LUNGES for the
wheelchair but doesn't make it. Walter SCREAMS as he falls.
MCCALL
NOOOO!
WALTER AND HIS WHEELCHAIR
freefall down toward earth in SLOW MOTION. The wheelchair
turns end over end. People SCREAM as Walter IMPACTS with the
pavement. The wheelchair CRASHES down nearby.
OMITTED
Sequence omitted from original script.
McCall looks over the edge at Walter's twisted body below.
Then he grabs Dave and wrestles him down, cuffing his hands
behind his back. The Cops and Medical Staff Members rush out
to restrain.
Establish grand stands.
OMITTED
Sequence omitted from original script.
McCall sits down in the same box as the last time. Roper
sits down next to him.
The horses go into the gate.
McCall watches intently as the horses spring from the gate.
(The track announcer's call plays over the scene.)
MCCALL
Come on four horse! Come on Seven
horse!
Roper isn't watching the horse. He's watching McCall. Watching
him redirect all his pent up emotion. Understanding exactly
how he feels.
McCall is screaming his head off.
MCCALL
Come on four-seven... Come on...
Come on... Come on...
The horses cross the wire. The four and seven finish mid-
pack. McCall hangs his head in despair. He didn't give a
shit about the race. He looks inconsolable.
ROPER
It might have happened no matter who
was up there.
MCCALL
Bullshit! Would it have happened to
you?
ROPER
Maybe... There's one thing you have
to remember... You don't create the
situations. You can only try to save
people from them.
MCCALL
I thought I could do it. I was so
damn sure of myself. But I didn't
know what to say. The words wouldn't
come. My mouth turned to mush. You
make it look so easy, Roper. But it
is not. It's not easy.
(beat)
It's a different job than looking
through the rifle scope.
ROPER
That it is.
A long silent beat.
MCCALL
How many have you lost?
ROPER
I look at it as how many I've saved.
That's the way you've got to look at
it.
MCCALL
And what about the ones you don't
save?
ROPER
You live with it... and they haunt
you. It doesn't leave.
MCCALL
And what if you can't live with it?
ROPER
You've got to decide that for
yourself.
McCall squeezes his eyes closed. He can still see that vet
falling to his death. Roper can see McCall's pain.
ROPER
I've lost three. One of them was my
partner. I think about them every
time I go into a situation.
(a beat)
There's a million people in this
city with all kinds of twisted shit
going on in their heads, and the
bitch of this job is that we expect
to go out every day and do the
impossible -- to somehow control all
this craziness... and we can't.
(a beat)
Nobody's faulting you for this,
McCall. My advice is you let yourself
off the hook.
McCall hears him but is still undecided.
MCCALL
I don't know... I don't know...
Roper gets up, stands over McCall, puts a hand on his
shoulder.
ROPER
Let's get out of here.
McCall slowly gets up and they walk out.
Establishing shot.
It's a small parking area, with security gates on either
end, and a ceiling of heavy steel wire open to the sky. There
are three or four CARS parked against the wall. Korda checks
inside the first car, looking for keys and finds none. Then
the second, and the third until...
A VOICE (O.S.)
Hey!
Korda turns sharply to find the LATINO GUARD (guard #2),
holding a clipboard, walking quickly toward him.
JAIL GUARD #2
Hold on a second here.
KORDA
Is there a problem?
The guard walks up to him. They're standing between the cars.
JAIL GUARD #2
You signed out twice.
KORDA
I what?
JAIL GUARD #2
Look, why don't you just come on
back inside for a second.
KORDA
Wait a minute, lemme see that.
As the guard shows him the sign-in sheet, Korda removes the
PEN from his own clipboard.
KORDA
Well, that's funny, I wonder how
that happened.
In a flash, Korda PLUNGES the pen DEEP into the guard's
throat. The BLOOD jumps out of his throat, onto the window
of the car as the guard, gagging in stunned silence, slumps
to ground. He then falls backward between the two cars,
drowning in his own blood.
OMITTED
Sequence omitted from original script.
ANGLE looking up at her window... The light goes out.
A suitcase THUMPS to the ground. Looks like somebody packed
for a six month trip around the world.
ANGLE WIDENS
McCall grimaces as he lugs the bag toward the truck.
MCCALL
You sure you packed everything? Maybe
you forgot your bowling ball.
Ronnie stands on the doorstep.
RONNIE
I sent that ahead, wise guy.
Paco is on the sidewalk exploring from tree to tree. Roper
calls to Ronnie from the stairway.
ROPER (V.O.)
Why don't you come back up with me,
Ronnie.
RONNIE
I think I'll stand out here in the
sun.
WIDE VIEW reveals the immensity of the abandoned facility.
At one end near the chain link fence, Roper's pickup
approaches the gate.
Roper cautiously drives toward the gate -- the CHAIN securing
the gate has been cut. Roper swings open the gate.
As he drives past we see that the bed of the truck has been
loosely covered with a TARP.
Roper drives on, winding through the maze of roadways, huge
buildings and equipment dwarfing the truc PRODUCTION NOTE:
The idea is to take us into the facility to sell that it's
abandoned, immense, eerie in it's scale -- a ghost town. We
end up wherever we want for the next scene.
Roper steps out, eyes scanning the buildings, the cranes...
Korda could be anywhere up there, watching.
As he moves away from the truck, holding the satchel.
ROPER
Korda!
In response he HEARS Korda's VOICE, eerie, almost a whisper,
coming from everywhere and nowhere as if emanating from the
ground and the buildings all at once.
KORDA (O.S.)
(filtered)
Nice of you to make it, Roper. Take
your jacket off, put it on the hood.
Roper complies, his eyes searching the buildings, where is
his voice coming from?
KORDA (O.S.)
(continuing)
Now, over to the chains, to your
left.
Roper SEES a chained off section nearby. Roper takes a few
steps when Korda's voice stops him...
KORDA (O.S.)
(continuing)
But first, let's have a look under
the tarp. Pull it back.
A momentary anxious look from Roper, then he walks to the
bed of the truck, pausing a moment, gripping the cover before
whipping it back, revealing... Ronnie's LUGGAGE.
CUT TO:
LOW ANGLE BENEATH THE TRUCK
McCall supported under the frame by a makeshift HARNESS around
his waist and legs.
KORDA (O.S.)
All right, move it.
McCall watches as Roper heads away, then releases the harness,
lowering himself to the ground. Quickly he moves the SMOKING
LEATHER GLOVES he was wearing, burned by contact with the
hot exhaust pipe.
ROPER
Reaches the the chained area, REVEALING an empty DRY DOCK,
easily one hundred feet deep and five hundred long.
At the bottom of the dry dock is a PORTABLE RADIO, the
acoustics of natural amphitheater so intense you could hear
a whisper -- the source of Korda's voice.
KORDA (O.S.)
(continuing)
Throw in and your piece.
Roper tosses his PISTOL into the dry dock.
KORDA (O.S.)
And your back up.
Roper removes the PISTOL from his ankle HOLSTER, tossing it.
Korda's VOICE cuts the eerie silence.
KORDA (O.S.)
(continuing)
Walk under the cranes and down the
alleyway. At the end, turn right.
Building thirty-six.
The RADIO CLICKS OFF.
Roper walks towards the megalith CRANES, passing under them,
then heads down the alleyway created by the tall buildings.
McCall, his RIFLE CASE on his chest, watches as Roper turns
the corner and heads down the alley way.
OUTSIDE THE TRUCK
McCall rolls out, scrambling for the cover of the building.
Slinging the case over his shoulder he finds a LADDER leading
up the side of the building, beginning to climb.
Walking down the alley way, nearing the end.
McCall moving along the edge, looking down. He spots Roper,
moving fast to keep him in sight.
He comes to the edge of the building, having to walk across
a narrow RAMP to get to the next building.
He looks down, Roper turning the corner, McCall moves on,
removing the RIFLE from its case as he goes.
Leaves the alleyway, a complex of hanger-like buildings
revealed. To his far right is a building, a SIGN reading:
BLD 36. He clutches the satchel, heading towards it.
McCall negotiating another precarious crossing between
buildings. He spots Roper, eyes quickly searching the roof
tops and buildings for the sniper's position. He sees it,
across the way, a location covering the buildings where Roper
is now walking. He heads out.
Walking towards building 36, passing by a towering, glass
fronted building on his right, his eyes are searching the
roof tops of the buildings around him.
ROPER
(to himself)
Where the hell are you, McCall?
As Roper passes a set of partially open ROLLING DOORS to the
glass-fronted building, he's startled by Korda's VOICE from
within:
KORDA (O.S.)
Right there, Roper.
Roper's eyes go to building 36, still fifty yards away.
ROPER
Shit.
Roper stops, slowly turning towards the doors.
KORDA (O.S.)
Come on in, there's someone just
dying to see you.
Roper hesitates. He turns a bit in profile, eyes searching.
ROPER
(loudly)
Where are you?
POV TELESCOPIC SIGHT: Focusing on Roper, his lips moving...
McCall, heaving for breath, has just dropped down into
position, providing a view of Roper and the inside of the
glass fronted building.
MCCALL
Right here, Scott.
He touches the LASER SIGHTING attachment to his scope, a red
beam activated...
ROPER - DAY
From inside the building Korda's VOICE:
KORDA (O.S.)
Get your ass in here, Roper.
Just as Roper starts to move he SEES the red laser DOT on
the back of his hand -- McCall is up there, right behind
him. Roper moves inside.
MCCALL - DAY
Lying prone inside the operator's booth, steadies his RIFLE,
looking through the scope.
TELESCOPIC POV: He can see Roper enter, his field of vision
limited inside the building where the light penetrates, the
room cast in HARD SHADOWS.
He MOVES to the windows, all either painted white or so
obscured with grime and dirt he can only see vague shapes
and shadows inside. He MOVES BACK to the opening, Roper now
just inside.
MCCALL
Stay cool, real easy...
On the floor he SEES a shadow cast - Korda. He moves to the
windows... inside the vague, blurred OUTLINE of a man. His
scope goes back to the satchel and the .45 taped to the
bottom.
MCCALL
Wait for the right moment, Scott...
Watching Roper as he moves away from the satchel and the
gun.
MCCALL
Oh, shit...
He moves the SCOPE ahead of Roper, SEEING Korda's shadow
cast on the floor, still unable to see him.
MCCALL
(continuing)
All right, Scott, bring him out.
Through the SCOPE, he can see Korda as he steps into view.
The CROSSHAIRS settle on Korda's upper forehead.
MCCALL
Hold it right there...
His finger tightens on the trigger...
The RED DOT centered on Korda's forehead...
MCCALL (O.S.)
Light's out, fucker...
And then Roper's HEAD fills the scope, the red dot GLOWING
on the back of his head.
In shock, McCall releases his finger...
MCCALL
Jesus!
Through the SCOPE, Roper's head blocking the shot to Korda.
MCCALL
Roper, move...
But Korda bends down, picking up the BAG, stepping back away
from Roper, clearly out of McCall's line of fire.
KORDA
Well, hate to run but I've got a
plane to catch. You take good care
of the little lady, hear?
As Korda walks down the corridor of the huge machine shop,
we now SEE a CAR parked near the end facing us. Korda suddenly
stops, turning, gesturing to the car.
KORDA
(continuing)
How careless of me. You see, there's
only one way out of here, and you're
standing right in the way.
(grins)
You could move, but then...
He shakes his head at Roper.
KORDA
(continuing)
Sure hate to be in your shoes.
He turns, walking quickly towards his car, TALKING, LAUGHING,
to himself.
Roper looks to the car, then back at the SATCHEL where the
.45 is still taped to the bottom. But Roper can't move, unable
to change his position more than a foot or two. He looks
around him, no way to stop the lathe if he releases the
button.
He can see Roper holding the box, but nothing else.
MCCALL
What the hell's going on?
McCall reading Roper's lips...
MCCALL
What car?
He swings the SCOPE up but the back of the machine shop is
blocked by his vantage point.
Then he HEARS the faint SQUEALING of tires. He lowers his
scope, holding, waiting...
McCall still can't see the car...
The CAR comes into view, the CROSSHAIRS on the windshield...
but the glare off the window is obscuring any shot of Korda.
McCall takes aim and FIRES...
The CAR explodes from the building, GLASS FLYING, the car
rolling, flipping over, coming to a rest on its wheels,
driver's side away from McCall's position.
Korda is slumped over the wheel. He looks dead. McCall slings
his rifle over his shoulder and moves towards a DRAIN PIPE
attached to the side of the building.
McCall slides to the ground via the drain pipe, but...
KORDA'S CAR
Korda is not quite dead...
The door eases open, Korda rolling to the ground, bag in one
hand, AUTOMATIC in the other. He looks up, SEEING McCall.
He OPENS FIRE, McCall hitting the deck and taking cover as
BULLETS hit the wall around him.
McCall whips out his REVOLVER, RETURNING FIRE, a GUN BATTLE
ensuing.
FIRES a round at Korda, then trying to close in on the car,
runs from his cover into the opening...
KORDA
Leaps up and FIRES, McCall taking a slug in his leg, knocking
him to the ground. The SLIDE to Korda's AUTOMATIC has kicked
open, out of bullets. He drops the gun, picks up the BAG and
runs alongside the machine shop.
ROPER
Exits the machine shop, SEEING McCall on the ground, Korda
nowhere in sight. Combat-style Roper runs to McCall, dropping
to his side.
ROPER
McCall, you all right?
MCCALL
(in pain)
I'm okay. Korda... went down the
side of the building...
ROPER
Stay put.
Roper sprints towards the building, racing alongside it,
catching a glimpse of Korda just as he disappears around the
other end. Roper charges on...
Korda runs past the building, still clutching the BAG. He
runs past another building, heading towards the dry dock
area and Roper's pickup. A moment later Roper emerges from
the machine shop just in time to see Korda round the corner
of the next building.
KORDA
Clearing the building sees Roper's PICKUP. He runs to it,
jumping inside, finding the KEYS in the ignition. He starts
the truck, pulling out, just as Roper runs into view.
ROPER
With the truck accelerating towards him he raises and FIRES,
two bullet holes in the front WINDSHIELD, missing Korda, the
truck still speeding towards him. Roper's gun jams. Roper
leaps, sliding forward on the hood, almost falling as he
grabs on to the empty window frame and the windshield wiper
blades for support, his WEAPON flying from his hand.
KORDA
Speeds around the buildings and down the alleyways, whipping
from side to side, trying to shake Roper off, Roper hanging
on for dear life.
ROPER
(shouting)
Give it up, Korda, you got away with
nothing! Nothing but a bag of shit!
It's all fake!
Korda can't help but look at the OPEN BAG beside him.
ROPER
(continuing)
Go on, you stupid fuck, look at it!
It's all shit! A hundred dollars
worth of glass!
Korda reaches in, grabbing a handful of the COSTUME JEWELRY.
He can't believe it, it's all fake!
KORDA
You fuck!!!
Korda goes crazy, slamming the truck into the side of a
building, trying to throw Roper, but Roper hangs on.
Korda then caroms off the sides of buildings, left, right,
SPARKS flying, then smashes into BOXES, CRATES, anything he
can see stacked alongside the road way, but Roper stays put,
clinging on with all he's got, swinging from side to side to
avoid the obstacles.
Then Korda SEES ahead a huge pile of BOXES, WOOD FRAMING,
PALLETS, TRASH, stacked at the side of a building. He hammers
the pedal, driving the right side of the truck into the
pile... BOXES, WOOD, PAPER, DEBRIS flying everywhere, through
the open fron window as well, Korda shielding his eyes with
his arm as OBJECTS fly around in a mad flurry inside the
cab...
ROPER
In the maelstrom lets go his grip, grabbing the upper frame
of the window and assisted by the speed of the truck, rolls
over the top of the cab, landing in the bed of the truck
along with BOXES, LUMBER, and TRASH.
KORDA
Clears his eyes, looking up, Roper is gone! He LAUGHS
hysterically... he knocked him off!
ROPER IN THE BED OF THE TRUCK
Leaning out the passenger's side SEES they are approaching
the dry dock area.
In the bed of the truck, along with the BOXES, SUITCASES and
other objects, he sees several long 2x4's. Grabbing a BOARD
he braces himself against the cab and then in one swift
movement, stands, swinging to the driver's side, driving the
2x4 through the side window, through the steering wheel,
past the dash and catching the tip of the ACCELERATOR PEDAL,
pinning it to the floor.
As Roper releases the board it WEDGES inside the door frame,
locking the wheel and the accelerator, the engine SCREAMING
wide open. Korda reacts in panic...
Roper clings to the cab, looking over the top, the DRY DOCK
looming towards them. He prepares to jump...
KORDA
Suddenly SEES the approaching dry dock. He jams on the brakes,
but it's not enough, the truck racing towards the edge...
IN SLOW MOTION THE TRUCK
Vaults over the edge of the dry dock as Roper runs down the
bed, leaping off the tail gate, arms windmilling as he goes
airborne...
The truck plummets towards the bottom...
ROPER
Lands in a huge pile of CARGO NETS and CARDBOARD BOXES, piled
near the edge of the dry dock...
KORDA
SCREAMS in wide-eyed terror as...
THE TRUCK
Hits the bottom of the dock, EXPLODING into flames.
DISSOLVE TO:
Roper and Ronnie lay on a gorgeous white sand beach, drinking
from coconuts with umbrellas in them.
RONNIE
I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti
is magnificent, Scottie.
ROPER
Yeah, I could get used to this
Paradise shit.
Roper hails a waitress, serving the hotel guests.
ROPER
(to waitress)
I'll have another Pena Colada. And
this time could you shave the ice,
please.
WAITRESS
Oui, Monsieur. Right away.
Roper stretches back into his chaise lounge, adjusting his
Ray Bans. A purring cat without a care in the world.
RONNIE
Scottie?
ROPER
Hmm?
RONNIE
I've been thinking.
TWO GORGEOUS FRENCH GIRLS unstring their bikinis, flopping
topless on the beach in front of them.
ROPER
Hmm?
RONNIE
Things have been going pretty well
between us, haven't they?
ROPER
(sensing something's
up)
Yeah.
RONNIE
You've changed you know. I don't
think there's anything you can't do
once you put your mind to it.
Uh-oh. He removes his shades to get a better look at the
curve ball.
RONNIE
I was just thinking...
(here it comes)
There's something special I want to
talk to you about.
(he's listening)
I think it's time we went to a whole
other phase in our relationship.
(pointedly)
A deeper level.
ROPER
(no longer relaxed,
sitting up)
A deeper level?
RONNIE
That's right. We've got to bare it
all. Here and now. 'Cause I think
I'm finally ready to go for it...
ROPER
(cutting her off at
the pass)
Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold
on. I know it's beautiful here. The
sun, the sand, the sea and all that
nature shit can really get to you.
But we've got to keep our perspective
here. This place isn't real. This
isn't reality.
RONNIE
Scott...
ROPER
I mean I said this trip should be a
'roadtest'.
RONNIE
...the hell are you talking about?
ROPER
I'm talking about... What are you
talking about?
RONNIE
I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping
down on this beach and gettin' you
know... 'naked in Tahiti'.
ROPER
You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?'
(off her look)
Shit, I thought you were talkin'
bout, you know... the "M" word.
RONNIE
You thought I was talking about
getting married?!
She laughs her amazing laugh.
RONNIE
I'm talking about taking our clothes
off, silly. You said you would.
AD LIBS dialogue below as CAMERA CRANES BACK and we ROLL
CREDITS over...
ROPER
You crazy? With all those people
around?
RONNIE
Know what you are?! You're a prude,
Roper.
ROPER
The hell I am!
RONNIE
(amused)
Prude.
ROPER
First you want me to put on one of
those skinny ass bathing suits --
tongs or thongs or whatever you call
them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped
around a piece of dental floss... No
way.
Over her laughter we...
