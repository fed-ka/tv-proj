notes:

To pop everything into place...

use Courier 10 (or 10 characters per inch)

set top margin at 0.4", bottom margin at 0.4" (or minimums)
left margin at 1", right margin at .25 (or minimum)
   (I had to tell the program I was using legal paper)

page breaks in hard copy indicated by ---page break---

regular tabs, hard returns and right flushes are used 
to position things to look as much like original as possible

sometimes the formatting changes slightly (as in the numbers at the
end of the lines), but I'm going to keep consistent because it's
easier

logo on front page will be noted when used but not included here

as this may be sent in .txt, originally underlined words will 
look like   _this_

I don't know what the (X) means; maybe it means the same thing as the
"*" in the other scripts


Notes:

      FADE IN:

   1  EXT. METROPOLIS PARK - IN TREES NEAR WISHING WELL - DAY #1  1   

      A familiar, gleaming red chunk of rock is held up to the sun 
      by LUCILLE NEWTRICH, a sassy, sexy woman of presence and
      determination.

                                      LUCILLE
                     Ready?

      NELL NEWTRICH, her serious and brainy little sis, checks a 
      futuristic looking video camera, almost gun-like in 
      appearance.  It is a laser.

                                      NELL
                     Ready.

      Lucille gives Nell the rock.  Nell, hands shaking nervously,
      drops it.  Lucille glares.

                                      NELL (CONT'D)
                     Sorry.

      Nell opens the breach of the laser and fumbles the Kryptonite
      into it.

                                      LUCILLE
                     I thought you said I could count on
                     you.

                                      NELL
                     You can.

      Nell snaps the breach shut -- on her thumb -- which causes 
      her to drop the laser, but Lucille, expecting this, grabs 
      the laser before it hits the ground.  Then grabs Nell by the
      collar.

                                      LUCILLE
                     Tell me this is going to work.

                                      NELL
                     It's going to work.

                                      LUCILLE
                     Tell me why.

      It is literally minutes after the final scene of Episode 6.
      CLARK is still at his desk, contemplating the ring.  He 
      snaps the case shut, determined, and steals a glance at 
      LOIS, just heading back to her desk, away from the 
      celebratory hoopla.  He moves to her.

                     that?

                     Somebody shot us with a red beam.

                                      LOIS
                     Well, go get 'em.

      He turns and makes a skyward leap.  Only he doesn't take
      off.  A FEW in the crowd note this.

                                      LOIS (CONT'D)
                     What is it?

                                      SUPERMAN
                     Um, I think I saw them go this way.

      He gestures for Lois to follow him into the stand of trees.  (X)

      Superman is on the other side of the old rusted gate Nell    (X)
      and Lucille went through; Lois is catching up as he scans    (X)
      the woods, looking for them.                                 (X)

      A stunned Lois and Superman, as she studies the gate in her
      hand.

                                      SUPERMAN
                     Do you feel... different?

                                      SUPERMAN
                     Let's stay calm.

                     Okay.

      She tosses the gate away.  It FLIES OUT OF FRAME and lands
      seconds later with a giant O.S. CLANG.

                                      LOIS (CONT'D)

                     I think we know what's happening.
                     The question is how?  Let's go back
                     out there --
                           (gestures to well)
                     -- and see if we can find some

                                      LOIS

      Nell's hand is in a bandage.  She tinkers with what appears  (X)

      She moves to a blackboard. on it, a map of a Metropolis 
      street corner has been sketched, along with arrows, cars, 
      stick figures and time codes.

                     It's me.  _I'm_ the idiot.  The 
                     idiot who told you my plan, 
                     believed you when you said you'd 
                     make it foolproof, then went ahead 
                     and invested every last cent in a 
                     heist that's never going to happen!

      She swipes the board with an eraser, taking out most of the
      plan.

                     The beam hit him.  I think it
                     worked.

                                      DRIVER
                           (now he gets it)
                     Oh, Superman.  Thanks.  Geez for a 
                     minute there I thought this lady 
                     here --

      Lois laughs at the ludicrousness of this.  Superman joins 
      her.


  23  MINUTES LATER - LOIS AND SUPERMAN                          23   

      are walking back across the field to her jeep.  Lois is
      carrying her heel-less shoes.

                                      LOIS
                     These shoes were eighty-five 
                     dollars.  Does the superheroes 
                     union cover expenses?

                                      SUPERMAN
                     No, but it does bring up an 
                     interesting issue.

                                      LOIS
                     Which is?

                                      SUPERMAN
                     You're just not the kind of person 
                     who can sit and watch someone in 
                     trouble if you can help...

                                      LOIS
                     Oh, I've got a bad feeling about
                     where this is going.

                                      SUPERMAN
                     ... but you don't want the world 
                     knowing it's Lois Lane stopping 
                     trucks, so...

                                      LOIS
                     Does this mean I have to start
                     wearing glasses?

                     He's putting on this brave face 
                     when I know it's just eating him 
                     alive... and if he sees me all red 
                     and blue, what's that going to do 
                     to him?

                                      JONATHAN
                     Lois, Clark is strong.  And I'm not 
                     talking about what he can bench 
                     press.  He's strong where it counts

      A BLAST OF SUPER-BREATH from above blows the FLAMING TARP 
      out.

      Superman looks up as the Crowd 'ooooohs' at the sight of --

      Lois, resplendent in tights, cape and mask, hovering to 
      Earth, blowing out the last of the fire.

                     them...
                           (glaring)
                     ... and funny, neither one seems
                     all that apathetic.

                     only 24 hours away -- does this 
                     happen?  Why -- then I take 
                     Superman out of the picture -- does 
                     _she_ show up?  Why -- when I am 
                     speaking -- are you not listening 
                     in _rapt_ attention?

      Lucille starts to crumple the paper but Nell pulls it away.

                     I have a theory.

                     Oh. Joy.

      Nell takes yesterday's late edition of the paper.  On the 
      front page, a shot of Lois and Superman in the burst of 
      laser light and the headline "Faster Than Speeding Light.',  (X)
      She lays it alongside today's shot of "Ultra Woman Saves
      Planet."

                     Let's say that MY Kryptonite laser 
                     worked... but not in the way we 
                     expected.  Let's say it created an 
                     unforeseen energy field... that 
                     passed through Superman, into this 
                     reporter and made her...
                     ultra-unique.

      She taps the picture of Ultra Woman.  Lucille looks at Nell.

                                      LUCILLE
                     Tell me you were adopted.  Because 
                     if we actually share genes, I'll 
                     jump in front of a bus.

                     Lucille.  Superman didn't fly onto 
                     the scene, he walked.  He didn't 
                     blow the flame out, he used a tarp.
                     I'm telling you, he's got all the 
                     super-powers of... Batman.  And 
                     _she_ is proof that those powers 
                     are transferrable.

                                      LUCILLE
                     Okay, let's say you're... not 
                     totally wrong.  We don't have the 
                     laser anymore.

      Nell produces a _second_ laser from her work bench.  Holds 
      it up.

      The door ripped off one of them and lying in the street.
      Ultra Woman tenderly setting an injured WOMAN on a medic's   (X)

                     she appreciates your concern.

      Another CHEER from the Crowd and the Husband turns away,
      chagrined.  PEOPLE take her picture.  She's handed papers to
      autograph.  She tries to take it all in stride.  Then a GIRL
      runs up.

                     six months, and we almost lost the

                           (to Clark)
                     Your mother went to work as a 
                     secretary, and ended up as office 
                     manager -- with a secretary of her

                     got over that.  What I didn't get 
                     over was her twelve hour days, 
                     working weekends, holidays.  I

  43  IN THE ALLEY                                               43   

      TWO THUGS attack a SKINNY KID.  ONE holds him down while the
      SECOND THUG gets his wallet, opens it and --

                                      THUG
                     Fourteen bucks? That's it?

      The Thug draws his fist back.  Clark catches it and whips
      the Thug around.

                                      CLARK
                     All his, so give it back.

      The kid scrambles to a corner.  The Thug knocks Clark's hand
      off; he and his partner circle Clark menacingly.

                                      THUG
                     I got a better idea.  Gimme yours.

                                      CLARK
                     Come get it.

      They attack.  But even without super-powers, Clark is nimble
      and fierce.  As he ducks Thug One's roundhouse, he
      SPIN-KICKS Thug Two into the garbage, then pivots back
      around... as Thug One whips out a gleaming knife.

                                      THUG
                     You wanna get crazy? Huh?

      He stabs at Clark and catches his sleeve.  Clark winces in
      pain and sees blood on his wrist.  The Thug grins and
      swipes.  Clark dodges.  The Thug circles, then lunges hard.
      Clark sidesteps, catches his wrist and flips the punk onto
      his back.  Clark takes the knife away, straightens and --

      Thug Two SMASHES Clark on the back of the head with a pipe.
      Clark drops, stunned.  Thug Two prepares to beat Clark to a
      pulp...  From behind, comes the SOUND of a gun being cocked.

                                      LUCILLE (O.S.)
                     Back off, Junior.

      Thugs One and Two look up to see Lucille with a gun, Nell at
      her side.  The Thugs don't move.

                                      LUCILLE

      She FIRES, just missing them.  The Thugs run out of alley.
      Clark lifts his aching head.

      He is of course surprised when the gun is trained on him.

      Nell ties Clark's wrists behind him, securing him to a metal
      chair.  Lucille keeps the gun on him.

                     I think she's unlisted.

                                      LUCILLE
                     I'm thinking more in the 'Help,
                     help, save me,' area.

                                      CLARK
                     Why me?  I've never even met her.

                     I'm sorry, you don't know Lois

      Clark tries to hide his shock with --

                     I don't know what you're talking
                     about.

      Nell connects a digital timer to the electric chair then 
      sets it for 5:00.

                                      LUCILLE

      Clark's wrists are bound behind the chair back and his 
      ankles are tied to the legs.  Pressing his toes down, Clark
      rocks his chair back quietly and looks out the half-open
      door.  Outside, he can glimpse Lucille and Nell in the
      moonlight, pacing, murmuring.  He rocks back a little
      further and now we see he's trying to free his ankles of
      their rope-bonds by sliding them down and over the end of
      the chair legs.

      Lucille slips the gun in her waistband and studies the night
      sky.  Nell, holding the laser, glances back into the garage.

      Lucille pops her head in the door.  Sees Clark still in the
      chair.  The electric wires looped everywhere disguise that
      one of his ankles is free.

      Nell and Lucille both whirl at the O.S. SOUND of the chair
      CRASHING INTO THE FLOOR.  Then a FLASH OF LIGHT and an
      ELECTRIC SIZZLE through the doorway O.S.  Lucille squints
      against the LIGHT BURST.  Nell hides her eyes.

      She and Nell head back to the garage.  PAN DOWN TO REVEAL

      soon as the sisters go back into the garage, he gets up and

                     I overheard them talking about some 
                     kind of plan to get 200 million by 
                     tomorrow...
                           (looks around)
                     Looks like they cleared out of here 
                     pretty fast, maybe they left a 
                     clue.

      Ultra Woman sees the blackboard.  It's mostly been erased.
      She turns on the X-RAY BEAMS.  Because the chalk lines are
      broken up, it's still mostly illegible as she scans.

                                      CLARK (CONT'D)
                     What do you see?

      She zeroes in on the lower corner.  There, a NUMBER wasn't
      erased entirely.  It was smeared over by a streak of chalk.  
      So by X-RAYING _beneath_ this streak she can read --

                                      ULTRA WOMAN (CONT'D)
                     A number. 9117841... something, 
                     something, something... can't get 
                     the other three, they're gone.

      She looks at Clark.

                                      CLARK
                     So how does that add up to two
                     hundred million dollars?

                                                        CUT TO:


  58  INT.  DAILY PLANET - DAY #3                                58   

      Lois works at computer.  Clark sits on her desk.  Jimmy 
      stands.  All mulling.

                                      LOIS
                     There's no facility in town with
                     that much cash.

                     So is the money coming _in_ to 
                     Metropolis.  But what bank needs

      Lois and Jimmy, absorbed by the screen, raise their hands.
      Clark moves off.

                     You ever get that interview with
                     Ultra Woman?

      Lois glances back at him, then the screen again.

                     I just wondered if she... you 
                     know... mentioned if she was seeing 
                     anybody?

                     It's not that I think I'm good 
                     enough for her -- up against Deion 
                     Sanders and Brad Pitt -- but I just 
                     can't stop thinking about her and 
                     if you could tell her that I... 
                     well, that I'm really a nice guy.

      Perry stalks through the scene, looking rumpled, haggard and
      pissed off.

                     No but he's made up for it by
                     yelling at _everybody_.

      A phone rings.  Jimmy gets it as Lois sips her coffee and 
      Clark looks at the computer.

      Behind them, Jimmy cups the phone in fear.

                     called, crying and sobbing...

      Clark gets a very bad feeling.

                                      CLARK
                     I think I want to cover this one

      In mid-hug, Ultra Woman looks up and sees Clark -- but 
      doesn't see Nell behind _her_ with the laser.  Clark is too 
      far to stop it.  Nell FIRES.  The RED BEAM hits Ultra Woman
      first, then ENGULFS her and Lucille in that EERIE GLOW.

      Both women are dazed.  Then Lucille grabs Ultra Woman and 
      HOISTS her up.

                     Thursday!

      Lucille charges and becomes a SUPER-BLUR.  Clark leaps out 
      of the way.  The BLUR shoots by him and RAMS into Nell and 
      now both sisters are a SPEEDING BLUR that zooms OUT OF 
      FRAME.  Clark runs to Ultra Woman.

                                      ULTRA WOMAN
                     That's the nasty thing about those

                     Nell... let's do a little test.
                     Pick up that guard's gun there.

      Nell gets out of the van and picks up the gun from fallen
      guard.

                     faster than a speeding bullet?

      She indicates that Nell should shoot Ultra Woman.

                     She knows who we are, Nell.  And
                     what we did.  Now, there's not a
                     jail on Earth that can hold me but
                     you...

                     ... you'd be in an awful lot of
                     trouble if she talks to the police.
                     So-ooooo, if you're so sure your
                     little laser worked, finish the
                     job.

      Yes, she does.  With a shaking hand, she aims the gun at 
      Ultra Woman.  Squeezes the trigger and --

      A cab pulls up and SCREECHES to a halt.  Nell, Lucille and 
      Ultra Woman are all startled as the sight of Superman, who 
      leaps out with the laser.  Lucille lets out a SUPER-BREATH 
      that knocks him back into the cab.  The laser clatters to 
      the ground.  He's dazed.

                     dies first?  My dear sister, I 
                     leave it to you.

      But Ultra Woman is already in motion, a garbage can lid in 
      her hand, which she flings across the street into Nell's
      stomach, knocking her back.

      Lucille starts to go for Lois but Superman grabs the 
      sideview mirror of the cab, flicks it and

      THE SUN REFLECTS into Lucille's eyes.

                                      LUCILLE

                     thought was possible.                         (X)

                                      CLARK
                     What?

                                      LOIS
                     I love you _more_.  More than I               (X)
                     ever have... more than I ever
                     thought I could love anyone.                  (X)

      They're at the fountain.  She gently pushes him back and     (X)
      sits him down

                                      LOIS (CONT'D)
                     So I have to ask you...                       (X)

      She pulls out the engagement ring box. Kneels and opens it.

                                      LOIS (CONT'D)
                     ... will you marry me?

      He looks at her, his every desire met at this moment.  Then
      smiles.

                     Who's asking -- Lois or Ultra
                     Woman?

                                      LOIS
                     Who's answering -- Clark or                   (X)
                     Superman?

      He stands.

                                      CLARK

                     _I'm_ answering.

                                      LOIS
                     I'm waiting.                                  (X)

      He slides the ring out of the box and onto her finger as

                                      CLARK
                     Yes.                                          (X)

      They kiss.  Her bejewelled left hand caresses his cheek as
      their lips meet and we...


                                                        FADE OUT.
