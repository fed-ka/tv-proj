      A tricked-out HUMMER zips down this daytime road.*

                                    BOYD (V.O.)
                    Sweet wheels, huh?



      Johnny and Boyd get out of the Hummer.  There's nobody around
      except the STATION ATTENDANT inside his glass cubicle.  Johnny
      checks the gas cap, but it's locked.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Keys?*

      Boyd takes the keys and tosses them.  As Johnny sorts through*
      them, WHOOSH...



      Johnny snaps out.  Are there more glimpses of this crazy on
      this key-ring?  Boyd is busy buffing out a fender scratch.

      Johnny TOUCHES ANOTHER KEY, as... WHOOSH! 



      Now Boyd is buying the Hummer.  He wears a slightly gaudy*
      looking three-piece suit.  Vision Johnny OBSERVES...*

                                      SALESMAN
                    If you put down another ten thousand*
                    I can cut those monthly payments for*
                    you.*

                                    BOYD
                    Do I look like the kind'a man that*
                    can't pay his debts? *
                          (pulls a wad of cash)
                    You wouldn't have change for a*
                    thousand, would ya?  *


1111RESUME - JOHNNY

      As he touches ANOTHER KEY, WHOOSH!



      Johnny snaps out again and touches one last KEY...            DEAD ZONE: "Lotto Fever" - ACT ONE - 7/12/05 - PINK  11.*




      Johnny flashes out as he looks over at Boyd, who now has his*
      wallet out, staring at a WORN SNAPSHOT.  He suddenly looks
      less like a crazed kidnapper and more like a simple man*
        overwhelmed.   

                                      JOHNNY
                    Your family?*

                                    BOYD
                    Yeah.*

                                      JOHNNY
                    How do they feel about all this?

      Boyd's melancholy mood shifts back into kidnap mode.*

                                    BOYD
                          (edgy)
                    Never mind how they feel.*

                                    BOYD (CONT'D)
                    You don't worry about how they feel. *
                          (beat)
                    I want you to take your clothes off.

                                      JOHNNY*
                          (taken aback)*
                    Do what?*

                                      BOYD*
                    You heard me. *

                                      JOHNNY
                    Listen, you can point that gun at me*
                    all you want, but there's a few things
                    I'm prepared to die for.

                                    BOYD
                    What?
                          (suddenly realizes)
                    That's not what I meant!  Who do you
                    think I am?!

      Boyd opens the back door of the Hummer and pulls out TWO
      CLOTHING BAGS.  He hands one of them to Johnny.

                                    BOYD
                    We can change in the bathroom.

                                      JOHNNY
                    We?


      They both step out of the bathroom, now dressed in TUXEDOS. 
      Johnny wears classic black, Boyd is dressed in white.

                                    BOYD
                    Sorry you got stuck with standard*
                    black, but they only had one white-*
                    on-white left in the store.

                                      JOHNNY
                    I'll try to get over it.*

                                      BOYD*
                    We need to meet a guy over at the*
                    country club.*

      Johnny notices something in the distance.

                                      JOHNNY
                    I hope you don't mind walking?*

      Boyd TURNS to SEE...

      POV - TOW TRUCK

      As the DRIVER drives away with the Hummer hooked on.

      RESUME JOHNNY AND BOYD

      Boyd freaks out and sprints across the lot.

                                    BOYD
                    Aw, geez!  Hey!  What are you doin'?! *
                    That's my car!

      Boyd helplessly watches as the truck drives away up the street*
      with his Hummer.*

                                    BOYD
                    WHY ME?!  I mean, can this day get*
                    any worse?*

      Boyd TURNS and notices...

      POV - POLICE CAR

      As it swings into the far side of the station heading their*
      way.*

                                    BOYD
                          (to himself)
                    I had to open my big mouth.*
                          (hurries back to Johnny)*
                    Alright, you play it straight or*
                    somebody gets hurt.  Got it?*

      Boyd reminds him by opening his jacket and showing him the*
      gun tucked in his waist band.  As the car pulls up we SEE*
      it's Walt.

                                    WALT
                    John?

                                      JOHNNY
                    Walt.  This is a surprise.

                                    WALT
                    Back at ya.  Sarah said you just got
                    back from Boston.

                                      JOHNNY
                    That's right.*

                    She said you were gonna take a shower*
                    and crash.*

                    That was the plan.*

                                    WALT
                    What's with the monkey suit?*

                                    BOYD
                          (friendly smile)
                    I'm afraid it's my fault, officer.*

                                      WALT*
                    Who are you?*

      Boyd hesitates slightly as he looks at Johnny,*

                          (quickly covering)*
                    This is an old friend from... high*
                    school.  Boyd Lumely.  Walt Bannerman.*

      Boyd shoots Johnny a look of disbelief, as he shakes hands
      with Walt.

                                      BOYD*

                                    BOYD
                    Sarah Bannerman? 

                                    WALT
                    It used to be Bracknell.

                    Oh, Sarah Bracknell!  Sure.  Great*
                    gal.  Quite a looker, as I recall.

      Johnny can only bite his cheek and hope this ends soon.*

      Walt glances around the empty lot.

      Walt gives them one last curious look, then DRIVES OFF. *
      Boyd's smile vanishes as soon as the patrol car is out of*

                    I was just trying to make*

                    How are we going to get out of here?

      Just then, a GYPSY CAB pulls into the station.  The DRIVER
      hops out and heads into the bathroom, a large NEWSPAPER tucked
      under his arm.  Boyd looks at Johnny and GRINS...            DEAD ZONE: "Lotto Fever" - ACT ONE - 7/12/05 - PINK  16.*




      Cruising along.*

      Johnny gets another vision of BOYD on his knees.  Oddly,
      this time we can hear a PIANO being played nearby.

      It's a heavenly sound... but the vision is pure hell as a
      HAND WITH A GUN enters frame, and FIRES!  



      A TRACT HOUSE in a run-down neighborhood.  Three bedrooms,
      peeling paint... but the flowerpots have been planted with
      care.

      It's dark, as Johnny and Boyd stumble around outside a large
      front window.

                                      JOHNNY
                    This is great, now they can add

                    Just move.

                                      JOHNNY
                    This is pathetic.  A grown man

                    Yeah, yeah, whatever.  Wait. 

      Boyd peers in through the front window...

      POV - EMILY (11)

      As she practices on an old, second-hand piano.

                                    BOYD

                    Geez, I hate to see her have to play
                    that crummy old piano.  At the big
                    house, she had a brand new baby grand. 
                    The sound would rip your heart out. 

      Just then, HEADLIGHTS wash over them.  They turn to see a
      late-model VOLVO pulling into the driveway.  They're literally*
      caught in the act.

                                    BOYD
                    Never mind.  We were just leavin'. 
                          (to Johnny)
                    Move!

      They start for the cab.

                                      MARSHA
                    You don't want to see Emily?

      Boyd STOPS in his tracks, as we see real emotion in his eyes.



      Tearing away from the house.

                                      JOHNNY (O.S.)
                    I just don't see why you couldn't
                    have asked her to borrow the car,
                    that's all?



      The beat-up Volvo sits parked out front.  A sign says, "Bingo*
      Tonight!"

                                      JOHNNY (V.O.)
                    Now it's all clear to me.  You're
                    going to win the million dollars
                    playing bingo.

                                      BOYD*
                    Very funny.*

                                      JOHNNY*
                    What are we doing here, then?*



      Johnny gets the MURDER VISION again:  Boyd being shot, on
      his knees in the grass as the PIANO MUSIC plays in the B.G. 
      Only this time we SEE a 2nd VICTIM - JOHNNY!   

      And when we PULL BACK, we SEE the killer is none other than
      the HARVARD GUY!



      Johnny and Boyd come busting out of the stairwell door.*

                                      JOHNNY
                    Which way?*

                                    BOYD
                    To the car!*

      Johnny grabs him by the arm,

                                      JOHNNY
                    No.  He'll look for us there.  This*
                    way.*

      They take off across the darkened garage.*



      Johnny and Boyd round another corner and STOP.  They bend
      over, panting and trying to catch their breath. 

                                    BOYD
                    Do you see him?*

                                      JOHNNY
                          (looking back)*
                    No.*

                                    BOYD
                    Maybe we lost him.*

      Johnny suddenly realizes that they're standing ON THE GRASS,
      exactly like in his previous visions of Boyd's death.  Then,
      we HEAR some familiar sounding PIANO MUSIC. *

                                    BOYD
                    You hear that?*

                                      JOHNNY
                    Yeah.

                                    BOYD
                    That's Emily.  That's my daughter.*

      As he TURNS, Whaack!  A GUN-BUTT KNOCKS HIM DOWN on to his*
      knees in the grass.  Johnny TURNS to find a gun with a*
      silencer pointed at him.*

      REVEALING the HIT MAN.

                                    HIT MAN
                    That was quite a show you two put
                    on.  Too bad you got involved mister,*
                    but I can't leave a witness.*

                                      BOYD*
                    Wait!  You don't have to do this!  I*
                    changed my mind!*

                                    HIT MAN
                    You got the rest of the money?

                                    BOYD
                    No.

                    Get on your knees.*

                                      JOHNNY*
                    Didn't you hear what he said?  He*
                    doesn't want to die.*

                                    HIT MAN*
                    We have a contract.  Besides, I have*
                      a professional reputation to protect. *
                    I go around breakin' deals and I'm*
                    out of business.  Now get on your*
                    knees!*

      Johnny and Boyd exchange a look, Johnny sinks to his knees*
      next to Boyd.*

                                      JOHNNY*
                    Just my luck, you hire a cold-blooded*
                    killer with ethics.*

                                    BOYD
                    I'm sorry, John.  You didn't deserve
                    this.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You're right, I don't.*

      He reaches over and puts his hand on Johnny's shoulder,*
      WHOOSH!  Johnny SEES something that we don't.*

                                      JOHNNY*
                    But maybe our luck is about to change.*

      Boyd isn't sure what he means, as the Hit Man cocks the pistol*
      and prepares to fire.  Just as we think it's too late, the*
      scene is suddenly FLOODED WITH BRIGHT LIGHT FROM EVERY
      DIRECTION --

      Johnny, Boyd and the Hit Man shade their eyes against the*
      brightness of the lights, as...*

                                    WALT (O.S.)
                    THIS IS THE SHERIFF!!  DROP YOUR*
                    WEAPON AND PUT YOUR HANDS ON TOP OF
                    YOUR HEAD! 

      It's a stunning eleventh hour reprieve, as the Hit Man*
      realizes he has no choice and tosses his gun away.  WALT,
      ROSCOE and OTHERS MOVE IN from all around them with their*
      weapons drawn.  The Hit Man is quickly hand-cuffed and hustled*
      away, as Johnny and Boyd get to their feet.

                    We are now.  Another thirty seconds
                    and it would have been a different*
                    story.  How did you know where we'd*
                    be?

                                    WALT
                    After I ID'ed Mister Lumely from the*
                    gas station security tape, I contacted
                    his wife.  She said if there was any
                    chance of finding him, it'd be at
                    his daughter's recital.  Which is
                    going on right across the street. *
                    We staked out the area and hoped for*
                    the best.*

      Boyd notices Marsha, his father and Emily appear just off*
      behind the lights.

                                    WALT

      Walt nods to Roscoe, who places a set of cuffs on Boyd.*

      Boyd looks at Walt and Johnny, then back at his family.*

                    Sheriff, I know I'm in trouble, but*

      Walt exchanges a look with Johnny, then over at the family...*

      They shake hands.  It's oddly moving.  Boyd turns, then...*

                                    BOYD
                    Oh, listen, I was gonna have a little*
                    poker game over at my place next*
                    week.  Some'a the boys from the*
                    office.  I was wonderin' if you might*
                    want'a play?*

      Johnny stares at him for a BEAT, then simply WALKS AWAY.*

                                    BOYD
                    John?  Aw, come on, don't be that*
                    way!  It's just a friendly game! *
                    We'll even let you use your super*
                    powers!  John!?

      We FADE OUT as Johnny continues walking away...*

                          THE END
