      A frenzy of media activity as people enter the court room. A 
      JOURNALIST is speaking to camera.

                    It s the first day of the trial of 
                    the MI5 Officer known only as

                    hope to see from this case?

                    Justice for myself and my children. 
                    And a sense that we live in a 
                    democracy where nobody - least of 
                    all a member of the Security 
                    Services - is above the law.

      We see Danny and RUTH walking past and into the courtroom.

      Ozal and his henchmen are walking through the streets of 
      North London as if they own them.  Ozal is miming the terror 
      of the man with the baseball bat.  His MEN are laughing 
        sycophantically.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Early morning and lawyers in wigs standing smoking. Newspaper 
      with headline HERO COP and a picture of Hasan Doyan.  Danny 
      standing alone.  He doesn t notice a woman standing next to 
      him also smoking furiously.  It is Gillian Doyan.

                    whose fingers are just touching and 
                    who are obviously having an affair.  
                    They know they should go to the

      returning to the office.  Only this time we re watching from 
      the POV of the person on the bench reading a newspaper who is
