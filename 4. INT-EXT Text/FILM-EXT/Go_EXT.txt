A light rain and crickets CHIRPING. Somewhere in the night,
DANCE MUSIC is blaring, but here it's only a whisper with a
beat.
Water trickles out of a jagged pipe. Splashing up mud, the
riverlet weaves through hamburger wrappers and sunbleached
beer cans, spent condoms and an old Spin magazine.
The tiny stream ripples past glass and trash and the body of a
woman. Face up, breathing. Dead grass caught in her braids.
Her name is RONNA MARTIN. She's eighteen and bleeding.
Bleeding a lot.
She tries to
push herself up, but the dirt around her crumbles.
Her legs are
useless. Despite it all, there's a smile of
perverse joy
to her face, like she's just remembered the
punchline to
a favorite joke.
CLAIRE (V.O.)
You know what I like best about Christmas?

SIMON
I'll give you twenty right now for a

She stops, turns on him. Her look could freeze lava.

Cash up front.
He peels off three twenties from his clip. She looks at the
money, thinking. Finally, she takes it.

A long pause.
INTERCOM VOICE

Another long pause. Ronna looks back at The Beast,

The release BUZZER stops as Ronna pulls open the door to the

RONNA
Forty-five minutes. Hour, tops. You just

CLAIRE
Hello! He's a drug dealer.
RONNA
Jesus, Claire. Don't get 818 on me here.
How much shit have I done for you? This

CLAIRE
No. No! You're making me an accessory.
RONNA
Claire. That bracelet of mine you're wearing
is an accessory. You are just some chick
who's sitting in an apartment. That's it.
It's not just the matter at hand, but years of minor adjustment
and one-upsmanship. Ronna finally drops the bravado.
RONNA
Okay, no bullshit. I need this. I don't

Ronna holds the door as Claire reluctantly steps inside.

The car is parked on the side of another residential street.
RONNA
I think it was Simon they were after. He

MANNIE
They didn't know who was dealing, just
that it was someone at the store?
RONNA
They were fishing. I bit.
Ronna's PAGER goes off with a shrill BEEPING. She checks the

RONNA
It's Claire. She paged me while I was in
there.
MANNIE
We go back to Todd. Tell him they didn't
show up, whatever. And then just swap the
pills for Claire.
RONNA
We can't.
MANNIE
Why not?
RONNA
They're gone. I flushed them.
MANNIE
Oh shit.
RONNA
Think of something. I need a hundred

Ronna and Claire weave through the densely packed lot, where
RAVE-GOERS party in and around their cars, drinking and
smoking.
As they walk, Ronna pops allergy medicine out of a blister-foil
pack. She tosses the box away. Scanning the lot, she points
to a mini-van.

Ronna knocks on the window. A NERVOUS TEENAGER rolls it down,
releasing a cloud of smoke. Ronna smiles.

medicine.
RONNA
We're out of that. We're down to chewable
aspirin.
A SKATE-PUNK GUY comes up to them, money in hand.
SKATE-PUNK GUY
Hey. People are saying you have some
really good stuff.
Ronna takes the money, looks him over.
RONNA
Show me your tits.
A beat. He pulls up his shirt to show his skinny white chest.
Deeming him worthy, Ronna hands him a pill and sends him on his
way. She adds the twenty to her stack.
CLAIRE
How much have you made?
RONNA
Four hundred.

Ronna pulls Mannie into a covered doorway, a niche set off from
the alley. They hide back in the shadows as
GAINES
races past. Ronna kneels down to Mannie, who's hunched over
his knees sweating and shaking.
RONNA
What's wrong? Mannie?
She puts a hand on his sweating forehead.
His cheeks.
RONNA
Jesus. You're burning up.
MANNIE
I can't feel my hands.
RONNA
Listen to me. We're going to find Claire

Ronna half-carries Mannie down the alley. He's too heavy to
lift, and too out of it to go much further. He collapses to
his knees. She can't get him back up.
Without warning, he HEAVES. We hear the SPLASH on the asphalt.
She props his head back against a dumpster. Wipes his face.
RONNA
Sweetheart. Mannie. I'm going to leave
you here. I'm going to get the car and
come back for you.
She fishes the keys out of his pocket. Mannie grabs onto her

She pushes his legs into the shadows. He's crying.

54
In the distance, we hear the RUMBLE of the music. Keeping low,
Ronna works her way down a row, coming to Mannie's car. She
tries one key, then another.
We LOOK UP to see Todd Gaines watching her from the hood of a
nearby car.
GAINES
How's it going, Ronna? How are sales?
Her heart skips a beat. She drops the keys.
RONNA
Todd, I can explain.
GAINES
I'm not going to ask you to.
He climbs off the car, approaching.
GAINES [CONT'D]
The thing is, it's not like I'm in a
highly ethical industry. But goddamn,
Ronna. You fucked me over for 20 lousy
hits.
He pulls his gun from the back of his jeans. By instinct, she
starts to move away.
A red Miata moves down the row behind Ronna. She looks to it
for help, but it's already passed.
RONNA
It's not what it looks like. I mean, it
sort of is, but it's complicated.
GAINES
Not really.
He cocks the gun.

RONNA
I have the cash. I have more than I owe
you.
GAINES
So now you're an entrepreneur.
At the last moment, Ronna bolts. She ducks around the corner
of a van, only to see...
A RED MIATA
doing 20 in reverse. It brakes, but there's no time. It hits
her hard.
She flies up over the roof of the car, CRASHING down on the
soft top. Her limp body starts to slip down the windshield,
but finally sticks.
PUSH IN ON GAINES
seeing the hit. HEARING it. Stunned.
A beat, then we hear the engine REV, pulling back again. That
shakes Ronna loose, letting her drop over the headlights in
front.
Rolling down the slope at the edge of the field, Ronna topples
ass-first into a drainage ditch. Her body lands with a
sickening THUD.
GAINES
stands where he is, gun still in hand, dumbfounded.
He looks to the Miata. It suddenly takes off, kicking up dirt
and grass. For a moment, all is quiet.
Finally, Gaines tucks the gun into his jeans. One last look
around, then he starts working his way back across the parking
lot. Disappears.

We stay on Ronna's body as we HEAR the Miata suddenly pull

still RAGING, but here it's only a WHISPER with a beat.
With a sudden SPASM, Ronna moves. Turns herself over on her
back. Each breath WHEEZES and GURGLES.
She pulls the remainder of the holly crown out of her hair and
tosses it aside. She tries to push herself up. Her legs won't
move.
Catching her breath, she looks to the top of the ditch, waiting
for somebody to look in. No one does. Adjusting herself, she
slides against a weathered magazine. Spin. Jane's Addiction
on the cover.
She collapses back, a new wave of pain.
After a beat, she suddenly LAUGHS, until gradually it becomes a
COUGHING. She pushes her hair back, streaking blood across her
face.
RONNA
Mannie!!
There's no answer. The YELLING hurts. She won't do that
again.
RONNA
Mannie, I got it! I remembered who the
fuck it was! Perry Farrell's dead
girlfriend. Xiola Blue. X-I-O-L-A.
Fuck, I knew there was one.
A sudden spasm of pain. She winces, sobbing. It passes.
RONNA
Don't you get it? I win.
She COUGHS as she laughs, spitting out some blood. We PULL
BACK, rising higher until we slowly
FADE OUT.

He slips Marcus a five as he rushes into the casino. A beat.

MARCUS
We have to get off the major streets.
Take a right up here. No, not here!
It's too late. Simon mistook an alley for an actual road.
SIMON
Hold on.
Aiming for the alley, Simon hits a curb on the way in. Singh's
head BANGS against the roof. The passenger-side mirror
smashes off against the wall.
TINY
Mother of fuck!

Just inches of clearance on either side, the alley runs behind

Behind them, the Ram Charger gingerly negotiates a three-point
turn into the alley. Wider, it scrapes against one side.
Ahead, the street sweeper is blocking one-quarter of the
alley. One-third. A moment of hesitation, then Simon floors
it. The Caddy hits thirty, forty. Engine RACING --
MARCUS
We can't make it!
The sweeper is already halfway across the alley. Singh braces
for impact. Somehow, Simon still thinks he can clear it.
MARCUS
STOP!
At the last moment, Simon SLAMS on the brakes. They're
skidding towards it.
Marcus grabs the wheel and jerks it. The front bumper catches
the wall, sending the trunk SLAMMING against the far alley
wall. A ear-piercing SCREECH.
A ribbon of sparks shoots off as the front and rear bumpers are
scraped away. Forward momentum finally stops.

The tires SPIN in place. The car is wedged in tight sideways.
Further down the alley, we find the broken-off

All four guys duck just before impact. The Ram Charger
CRUNCHES into the side of the Cadillac, pushing it down the
alley. More sparks shoot off as it goes.
Looking ahead, the street sweeper has moved past the end of the
alley, but the far side of the street beyond is a construction
area, flashing baricades all around. The Ram Charger will push
them right into it.

Swinging wide, the Cadillac comes free with another CRUNCH.
Momentum keeps the Ram Charger heading straight for the
construction.

Hitting a parked car, the Ram Charger tips and rolls over,
landing on its side. It SCRAPES along the asphalt, finally

With a flashlight, Zack jumps down into the ditch. He nudges
Ronna's body with his foot. She's dead alright.
He rolls the body over, grabbing under her arms. He tries to
hoist her up, but she's too heavy and the ditch is too deep.
ZACK
Little help?
ADAM
(not moving)
I can't.
ZACK
What do you mean?

ADAM
I can't do this.
Frustrated, Zack tries again to lug the body out. He can't do
it by himself. Meanwhile, Adam is starting to hyperventilate,
tears swelling.
ZACK
Okay, listen to me...
ADAM
She's dead.
ZACK
She's not dead.
ADAM
She's dead. I hit her and I killed her.
He looks around, expecting someone to walk up and see them.
ZACK
No you didn't, okay? This is all just
make-believe. This is a scene. She's
just acting dead. And you're just acting
scared.
Adam laughs to himself, still crying.
ZACK
See, there's the lights, and there's the
camera. Watch your blocking.
(pointing)
There's Michelle in wardrobe, say "Hi,
Michelle!"
ADAM
Hi, Michelle.
ZACK
The craft service truck is right around
the corner, and they have lots of little
veggie burgers on the grill. And you can
have one if you just help me finish this
scene.
(sniffing)
Can you smell them? Can you smell them on
the grill?
A beat.
ADAM
I'm not delusional.

ZACK
Then take her fucking arms!
Obeying, Adam grabs Ronna's wrists as Zack pushes from below.
Together they get the body out of the ditch. Zack climbs up to
help maneuver her into the car. Just then...
Ronna MOANS.
Adam freaks out, dropping his side. Ronna's head hits the
dirt. Louder MOANING.
ADAM
She's not dead.
ZACK
No shit!
They stand back, watching Ronna MOAN as she lies half-in, half-
out of the car.
ADAM
If she's not dead, that means we didn't
kill her. We can just leave her.
ZACK
She's almost dead. We leave her and she
dies, why did we bother coming back? I
mean, you still killed her.
ADAM
What do you mean, I killed her?
ZACK
Christ, I didn't mean it that way. C'mon.
I would never testify against you.
Adam is not reassured.
ZACK
We have to stick with Plan A.
ADAM
In Plan A she was dead.
Zack reaches into the car, pulling out The Club. Trades a look
with Adam, who finally acquieces. Almost says something,
doesn't. They both look around, making sure no one's coming.
Zack grips the bar like a baseball bat. Adam turns his back,
covering his ears.
Zack raises the bar. Adam scrunches his face tight.

Zack takes two quick breaths. And holds.
And holds. And holds.
Adam opens his eyes, looks back. Zack isn't swinging. He
lowers the bar. They both breathe again, relieved.
ZACK
Okay. New plan.

A CAR ALARM drones incessantly, the siren interrupted with an
occasional
CAR ALARM VOICE
Back away from the vehicle.
Weaving through some parked cars, we settle on an angry BMW,
its lights flashing. A small throng of RAVERS have gathered
around to look, because Ronna's limp body lies on the hood.
A familiar face pushes through the crowd, just arrived.
FILA GUY
Hey, it's Kelly. Somebody beat the crap
out of her.
Moving to find...
SKATE-PUNK GUY
Somebody call an ambulance!
After a beat, he realizes he should do it himself. He takes
off running.
ADAM AND ZACK
look around from the edge of a van in the distance.
ZACK
Look, she's fine. They're getting an
ambulance. She's fine.
Adam keeps watching, not convinced. He turns back, a
thought...
ADAM
What about that guy? The guy with the
gun. He could still go after her.

ZACK
Okay, listen. Girl in ditch -- that's our
problem. Girl out of ditch -- that's her
own problem. We're done. We did the
right thing.
Thunder RUMBLES overhead. Off Adam's look...
ZACK
Okay, approximately the right thing. In a
half-assed, thrown-together fashion.
Adam smiles despite himself. Zack points, "See? See?" That
just makes Adam smile more.
ZACK
Home?
ADAM
Home.
As they walk off, we leave the Mary Xmas Supafest still BLARING
in the distance.

It's stopped raining, but the pavement is still wet.

Mannie? Mannie?
Ronna limps ahead. A taxicab waits in the background.

CLAIRE
Mannie! Mannie!
All the alleys look the same. He could be anywhere.

A stray
black cat scratches through a pile of foam peanuts,
looking
for bugs. Another cat crawls up the body of Mannie,
propped
against the dumpster. A trickle of water drips off the
garbage
onto his face. The cat licks it clean.
Mannie smiles.

RONNA
Mannie! Can you hear me?
MANNIE (O.S.)
Yeah!
Ronna turns to see Mannie behind her, stretching his neck.
He's pale. His eyes are bloodshot. But otherwise, he's fine.
MANNIE
You look like shit.

The Beast is the only car left. Ronna and Claire circle,
looking for the keys on the ground. Calling out...
RONNA
You fucked Todd Gaines?

Made out?
CLAIRE
Kissed. A little. What?
RONNA
Hello! He's a drug dealer.
Claire doesn't want this to go any further. Fortunately, just
then...
CLAIRE
Found `em.
She shakes the mud and grime off, then throws them to Ronna.
Mannie lies back on the trunk, droopy.

You might have brain damage from

MANNIE
Dain brambage?
A beat.
MANNIE
Xavier Kugat. Starts with X.
RONNA
You shit.
She puts him in the car, holding his head like he's a criminal
on "Cops."
CLAIRE
I'll drive.
Ronna hands her the keys over the roof of the Beast, sunlight
shining off the gathered rain. They take a beat, just the two
of them.
CLAIRE
So, do you have enough money to pay off
your rent?
RONNA
And twenty left over. Maybe I'll open a
savings account.
GETTING IN...
Claire starts the car. Mannie leans up from the back seat.
MANNIE
So what are we doing for New Year's?
Ronna smiles.
RONNA
Merry Christmas, Mannie.
THE BEAST
ROARS off across the parking lot, TITLE MUSIC building.
