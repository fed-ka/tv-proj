  BLACKBOX OPENING:

    11,346.... Nautical Miles
    22........ Ports
    14........ Racing Yachts
    1......... Sunken Treasure

  EXT. OCEAN - DAY (STOCK FOOTAGE)11

  MONTAGE to music.  SAILBOATS slice through the water.  Winter 
  sun sparkles.  Sails flutter then SNAP, filling with wind, 
  lifting yachts away from shore...  It s all the glamour and 
  beauty of sailing without the Dramamine.

  WE LAND ON a sailboat headed in.  She drops her sails and 
  heads up the channel, leading us toward...

  EXT. SAN PEDRO - BOAT SLIPS - DAY22

  The usual activity among the docks.  Here and there, owners 
  do maintenance.  A few fishing boats hose off...

  At the end of one of the docks WE FIND a group of JUNIOR HIGH 
  KIDS on an oceanography FIELD TRIP.  They re gathered near a 
  tied-up RESEARCH BOAT, listening as a MARINE EXPERT describes 
  some local sea life, holding up SPECIMENS of some, pointing 
  to PICTURES of others on a chart...

                                MARINE EXPERT
                These are some examples of what we 
                might find today in our catch.  
                Pacific crab, sea anemones, any 
                number of a variety of starfish...

  Behind the Expert, on the Research Boat, a small CRANE lifts 
  a bulging fishing net...

                                MARINE EXPERT
                Once the net is released, you 
                should try to identify as many 
                  creatures as you can.  Keep a list 
                there in your notebooks... 

  The net moves into position over the pier.  It s tough to see 
  its contents, most of what s visible is seaweed.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS 313/50 "Finders Keepers" GREEN Rev  11/30/06    2.

                                MARINE EXPERT
                So far, most of what we can see is 
                kelp, which you re all familiar 
                with from the beach, right?  
                  Everybody s seen that?  So let s 
                write down  kelp ...

  The net comes to rest.  The Operator throws a lever, dumping 
  its contents - a tangle of sea weed, kelp, a giant crab... 
  and SOMETHING black, rubbery caught in a heap of kelp...

                                JUNIOR HIGH KID
                What is that, a sea lion?

  The Marine Expert tugs on the kelp.  The  sea lion  tumbles 
  out...  It s the wetsuit-clad BODY of a DEAD DIVER!  Teachers 
  and kids react.  The Marine Expert stands stunned... then --

                                MARINE EXPERT
                Somebody call the Harbor Patrol!

  Off the Dead Diver --

  EXT. SAN PEDRO - BOAT SLIPS - DAY - LATER33

  CRIME SCENE now.  LAPD is here, along with PORT POLICE...  
  DON and COLBY arrive as the CORONER S INVESTIGATOR wraps up 
  her initial exam.  She turns to them, familiar --

                                CORONER S INVESTIGATOR
                Agents.  How is it this guy rates 
                FBI attention?

                              COLBY
                He had the dumb luck to get himself 
                scooped up out of the ocean.  
                   Crimes-at-sea  are ours...

                              DON
                What can you tell us?

                                CORONER S INVESTIGATOR
                He wasn t in the water long, 16 to 
                24 hours.  Can t say for sure  til 
                I get him in the shop, but he was 
                probably dead before he went in.

                              COLBY
                      (off the diver s body)
                I m guessing the bullet hole in his 
                wetsuit had something to do with 
                that?



                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS 313/50 "Finders Keepers" GREEN Rev  11/30/06    3.

                                CORONER S INVESTIGATOR
                Actually, Granger, it s the bullet 
                hole in the diver that really 
                clinched it.

                              COLBY
                      (grins, teasing)
                Thanks.  Nice to see those 4 years 
                of medical school weren t a waste.

  She smiles.  Don turns to a nearby PORT POLICE OFFICER.

                              DON
                We have an exact location on where 
                the body was found?

                              PORT POLICE OFFICER
                The boat was dragging the bottom 
                over several miles, seeing what 
                they could pull up for the kids...

                              DON
                Kids...?

                              PORT POLICE OFFICER
                Junior High class on an 
                  oceanography field trip.

                              COLBY
                Bet this went over real well...

  Don stoops to take a look at the body, eyes the wetsuit.

                              DON
                This doesn t look like a 
                  recreational dive suit...

                              PORT POLICE OFFICER
                Nah, it s definitely commercial.

                              COLBY
                Like an oil rig worker or 
                  something...?

  Don moves to the Diver s leg, releases the knife sheath 
  strapped just above the ankle, turns it...

                              DON
                Or a salvage diver.

  He hands the sheath to Colby.  Colby reads the back...

  A beat.  Off the dead diver --

  INT. EPPES HOME - DINING ROOM - DAY44

  ALAN s at the table.  He s got a CHESS SET spread out in 
  front of him, examining and polishing some of the pieces.  He 
  looks up as CHARLIE bounds down the stairs, heading out.

                              ALAN
                Hey, Charlie, you headed to school?

                              CHARLIE
                Uh, I need to go by the FBI first, 
                drop off some crime index work I 
                did for Don, but after that, yeah.  
                      (seeing the chess set)
                Why?  Are you looking for a match?

                              ALAN
                      (absurd)
                What, with you?  You know I said 
                I d never do that again.  Have to 
                put up with you looking bored the 
                whole time, or condescending... or 
                bored and condescending... 

                              CHARLIE
                Well, seeing as your usual chess 
                partner, Larry, is currently in low-
                earth orbit, I thought maybe you 
                were getting desperate.

                              ALAN
                Not at all.  Millie says she has a 
                pretty good game, too.

                              CHARLIE
                Really.  I ll be sure to teach her 
                some of my best condescending looks 
                then...

                              ALAN
                No!  No coaching, I mean.  Millie 
                brings her own game, not yours.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS 313/50 "Finders Keepers" GREEN Rev  11/30/06    5.

                              CHARLIE
                Okay, but you re forgetting, Dad, 
                she s a mathematician.  That gives 
                her the same analytical edge that I 
                have.

  Alan suddenly stops polishing chess pieces.

                              ALAN
                Thank you.  I forgot about that.  
                I ll have to reconsider some of my 
                  strategy...

                              CHARLIE
                You ever think maybe you take the 
                whole thing just a little too 
                  seriously.

                              ALAN
                Charlie.  It s chess.  Do I really 
                have to say more?

  Alan picks up another chess piece, starts polishing.  Charlie 
  watches him a beat, gets a chuckle.

                              CHARLIE
                No, Dad.  You sure don t... 

                              ALAN
                I ll see you later.

  As Charlie heads for the door, amused --

  INT. FBI - BULLPEN - DAY55

  MEGAN works at her desk as Don approaches.  On her monitor - 
  a NAVY ENLISTMENT PHOTO of the Dead Diver.  

                              MEGAN
                Our dead guy s name is Evan Koontz.  
                He was a Navy diver until  98.  
                He s been working different dive 
                jobs since...  Landed with Morris 
                Marine Salvage about five months 
                ago.

  She hands Don the file on him, adding --

                              MEGAN
                He should ve done a little more 
                research on his employers though...

                What do you mean?

  A pair of MUG SHOTS appear on her computer monitor.

                Meet the Morris brothers, Chris and

                Serious criminals?

                              MEGAN
                Theft.  Aggravated assault...  I get 
                the feeling though the marine 
                salvage business isn t exactly the 
                place for boy scouts...

  Colby comes over, joins them (as Charlie approaches in b.g.).

                              COLBY
                I ve been on the phone with some of 
                the other salvage companies in 
                town...  Turns out every dive crew 
                between here and San Diego is out 
                right now.  And they re all looking 
                for the same thing: the  Cheetah. 

  He reveals a PHOTO of a sleek 60  yacht.

                              MEGAN
                A yacht?

                              CHARLIE
                      (reaches the group)
                A 60 foot Open Class racing yacht.  
                It went down a couple days ago.

                              COLBY
                It sank about 40 miles out.  Deep 
                water...

                              DON
                Wait a minute, I read about that.  
                It was taking part in some  round-
                  the-world race.  There s still a 
                big search going on...

                              CHARLIE
                Yeah.  They were headed for Marina 
                del Rey when she sank.  Looks like 
                the Skipper went down with her...

                Charlie, are you a closet 
                   yachtsman,  or just incredibly 
                well-up on the news...?

                              CHARLIE
                Neither.   Open Class  is the 
                cutting edge of racing yachts.  A 
                ton of math goes into their design.  
                A lot of it, I don t mind saying, 
                based on my early work in  
                  computational fluid dynamics...

                              COLBY
                Wait.  Fluid dynamics.  That s like 
                  aerodynamics, except in water?

                              CHARLIE *
                Sure.  Actually you can think of  *
                air as a very thin liquid.   *

  AUDIENCE VISION

  The low, sleek profile of a SPORTS CAR in a wind-tunnel.  
  Carried by the air currents, a ribbon of SMOKE snakes low 
  over the hood, up the windshield and over the car...

                              CHARLIE (V.O.)
                Both air and water stick to *
                surfaces as they travel over them.  *
                It s called friction.  But we can *
                create mathematically optimized *
                designs that reduce friction... *

  As Charlie speaks, the Sports Car body inverts and becomes 
  the hull of a boat, the Smoke ribbon now trailing under and 
  around the hull s keel design, accompanied by complex 
    equations...

                              CHARLIE (V.O.)
                  ...lowering the drag as air, or in *
                this case water, moves around the *
                design.  The lower the drag, the *
                faster your boat...

                Charlie, how much do you know about 
                this particular yacht?

                              CHARLIE
                Not too much.  Designs are kept 
                secret before a race.  But these 
                boats can cost easily eight or ten 
                million dollars.  Even as a 
                  shipwreck, the Cheetah still has to 
                be worth a couple million...

                Maritime Law favors whoever finds 
                the wreck first.

                              COLBY
                So we re talking, basically, about 
                  a treasure hunt.

                              CHARLIE
                  Somewhere out there, on the bottom 
                of the ocean, is a two million 
                dollar prize...

                              MEGAN
                And somewhere out there is a person 
                willing to kill for it.

                                    ACT ONE

  TWO SECOND GRAPHIC BUMPER:

  EXT. MARINA - MORRIS MARINE SALVAGE OFFICE - DAY66

  An industrial area of the marina.  The Morris Salvage BARGE 
  is tied up opposite a small office.  Don pounds on the door.  
  Colby appears from around the side...

                              COLBY
                Their salvage barge is here, but I 
                don t see anyone...

  Don notices a MECHANIC working on a boat in the next slip. 

                              DON
                Hey...  Have you seen anybody from 
                Morris Salvage around?

                              MECHANIC
                Not today...  

                              DON
                When was the last time you did?

                              MECHANIC
                I dunno.  Their boat s been out for 
                the past couple days.  Must ve come 
                back in last night, but I wasn t 
                here.

  The Mechanic goes back to work.  Colby turns to Don...

                              COLBY
                If this guy s right, it means the 
                barge was out the same time period 
                the diver was shot and dumped. 

                              DON
                Which makes this barge our crime 
                scene.

  As they turn and climb aboard the barge...

  EXT. MORRIS SALVAGE BARGE - ON DECK - DAY - CONTINUOUS77

  The barge is the ocean-going version of a heavy duty TOW 
  TRUCK - marker buoys, winch motors, cranes - most of it 
  covered with rust and/or barnacles... 

  Colby and Don cross the deck, splitting up, poking around, 
    searching.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS 313/50 "Finders Keepers" GREEN Rev  11/30/06    10.

                Bogart, Walter Huston...

                              COLBY
                Guys start looking for treasure, 
                they get greedy.

  Colby kicks at a trash bin full of empty beer bottles.

                              COLBY
                Add in a little alcohol...  Maybe 
                an argument erupts over how they ll 
                split the prize if they find it.
                      (then)
                Three guys sail out, only two end 
                up sailing back in.

  Don rounds the side of the wheel house, stops short.

                              DON
                Better call E.R.T.  Tell  em we 
                need a crime scene team out here.

  Colby comes to see -- a smeared, BLOODY HAND PRINT low on the 
  wall.  It s dried now, but there s no mistaking it.

                              COLBY
                Yeah, I m pretty sure that s not 
                finger paint...

  As Colby pulls his phone to call it in.  Don SEES SOMETHING 
  on the dock that distracts him.

  AGENT LIZ WARNER is coming up the dock...

  EXT. DOCK - ALONGSIDE THE MORRIS BARGE - DAY88

  Don hops off the barge, goes to greet Liz, all smiles.

                              LIZ 
                How you doin , Eppes?

  They hug, but Liz is unexpectedly guarded, a little distant.

                              DON
                This is one I didn t see coming.  
                What s a Riverside agent doing this 
                close to the ocean?

                We ve been seeing supply boats come

                charters or salvage boats go out 
                and make the pickup.
                      (then)
                I was hoping I could tag along with 
                your guys, see if there s any

                              DON
                Of course, yeah.  You got it.

                E.R.T. guys re on their way.  Look

                The Cheetah...

  Off the PHOTO of the Cheetah...

  EXT. MARINA - RESTAURANT - DAY99

  Megan talks with the Cheetah s wealthy owner, MEL OLIVER 
  (45).  He eyes PHOTOS of Chris and Robert Morris, and the 
  Navy PHOTO of Koontz, shakes his head.

                                OLIVER
                Morris Salvage isn t any part of 
                the official search to find the 
                Cheetah.  Doesn t mean they weren t 
                looking for her though.  Situation 
                like this, salvagers descend like 
                flies, everyone looking to grab a 
                peice of the salvage rights...

                              MEGAN
                That must be annoying.  It s your 
                yacht.  Other people trying to cash 
                in on it...

                                OLIVER
                      (shrugs)
                The way I look at it, the more 
                boats out there the better right 
                now.  Gives us a better chance of 
                finding Reid.

                That would be Reid Sarasin, your 
                Skipper.

                                OLIVER
                      (saddened)
                Yeah, I was in constant radio 
                contact with him until the last 
                minutes before he went down...
                      (then)
                Probably not a handful of people in 
                the whole world who could sail at 
                his level...

                              MEGAN
                Do you have any idea yet what 
                caused your yacht to sink?

                                OLIVER
                Design flaw probably.  We fared 
                pretty well most of the race.  But 
                3 days after leaving Honolulu, the 
                keel began to separate, the boat 
                started taking on water.

                              MEGAN
                Why didn t they turn back?

                                OLIVER
                Problem wasn t that bad at first.  
                Wasn t until the seas got rougher 
                that we realized how serious it 
                really was.  Finally Reid gave the 
                order to abandon ship.

                              MEGAN
                How many in his crew?

                                OLIVER
                Five, including Reid.  We were able 
                to contact one of the other race 
                yachts.  She doubled back, picked 
                up the others.  But Reid didn t go.  
                Guess he thought he could make it 
                with the Cheetah...

                              MEGAN
                But he didn t...

                I can build another boat, you know?

                reason the keel should have failed.

                                MILLIE
                You know, Charlie, I have some 
                sailing experience myself.
                      (adding quickly)
                For real.  Not like my chess 
                  experience.

                              CHARLIE
                No, I didn t realize...

                              MILLIE
                I took a three month sabbatical 
                from MIT, spent it navigating the 
                South Pacific with a friend I knew 
                back in grad school.
                      (then)
                It sounds as if I m in danger of 
                not having a point here, but I do.  
                And that s this...  Out at sea, all 
                bets are off.  You encounter forces 
                you could never anticipate...
                        (remembering, not fondly)
                Now some of those forces have to do 
                with being confined to a very small 
                space with someone you only thought 
                you knew; someone clearly enamored 
                with the sound of their own voice 
                and able to talk endlessly without 
                even the need to breathe...

                              CHARLIE
                But the real point...

                                MILLIE
                Oh, yes, my point...  The ocean has 
                to have exerted tremendous physical 
                  pressures on this boat.  Have you 
                  accounted for compressive creep?  
                Tensile stress?  Material fatigue?




                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS 313/50 "Finders Keepers" GREEN Rev  11/30/06    16.

                              CHARLIE
                I ran calculations to evaluate the 
                  probabilities of material failures, 
                and to check if the designs would 
                  withstand ocean conditions...  I 
                can t find a single flaw.

                                MILLIE
                Then why did the yacht sink?

  Off Charlie s wondering --

  INT. FBI - BULLPEN - DAY1111

  Megan at her desk.  She hangs up the phone, turns to Don,  *
  calls in Colby as well, who s passing with Liz -- *

                              MEGAN *
                Colby, you ll want to hear this  *
                too.   *
                      (as they gather) *
                The lab just finished a preliminary *
                analysis of the blood you found on 
                the Morris salvage barge.  They  *
                isolated three distinct samples.  
                One belonging to our dead diver, 
                Koontz, and two others...

                              DON
                The Morris brothers...?

                              MEGAN
                The blood-types are consistent.

                              COLBY
                So the Morris brothers become 
                  potential victims not suspects.  
                Which means our focus shifts where?

                              MEGAN
                Other salvage companies maybe, 
                someone trying to keep the Morris 
                crew away from finding the Cheetah?

                              LIZ
                Or it could be related to one of 
                the drug operations I was telling 
                Don about.  Either these guys were 
                  involved... or maybe their search 
                for the yacht took them too close 
                to something they weren t supposed 
                to see...



                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS 313/50 "Finders Keepers" GREEN Rev  11/30/06    17.

                              DON
                The barge.  The blood suggests the 
                murder took place on board, but we 
                don t know where the barge was when 
                it happened.

                              MEGAN
                If we knew where it was, we could 
                  determine what other ships were in 
                the area, who might ve had access.

  Off Charlie --

                                                                        CUT TO:

  EXT. MORRIS SALVAGE BARGE - ON DECK - NIGHT1313

  There s crime tape now, surrounding the wheel house where Don 
  and Colby discovered the bloody hand print.  Charlie s here 
  with Colby and Liz.

                              CHARLIE
                The question we re asking is 
                simple:  Where did this barge go 
                during the time it was out?  And 
                how can we re-trace its path?

  Charlie stops in the center of the deck, looks around as if 
  the answer is going to magically appear.  Liz smiles -

                              LIZ
                Oh, c mon, Charlie.  I m calling 
                your bluff here.

                              COLBY
                No, let him go.  He s fun to watch 
                when he gets like this.

                              CHARLIE
                The key is identifying data 
                sources.  There are a lot more 
                clues here than you probably 
                realize.  For instance, how much 
                fuel was consumed?  How many engine 
                hours were logged?  Did they record 
                any sonar readings?  Uh...  How 
                deep was the anchor chain run out?  
                And is there evidence of a 
                particular algae bloom on the 
                chain?




                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS 313/50 "Finders Keepers" GREEN Rev  11/30/06    19A.

                Ooh, I m having a bad algebra 
                  flashback.   If a salvage barge is 
                headed west at 6 knots in a 
                headwind of 8 knots...

                              CHARLIE
                It s not that difficult.  Each 
                piece of data is a constraint.  
                Since the path of the boat must 
                obey every constraint, the set of 
                possible paths gets pared down with 
                each new measurement.  So I ll make 
                a list of possible data sources.  
                You two start collecting.

                              COLBY
                Well, fuel and engine hour data 
                we ve already got.  It s right here 
                in the crime scene report.
                      (flipping pages)
                Fuel consumed, 68 gallons.  Engine 
                hours on the last trip... 16.

                              CHARLIE
                Are you sure?

                              COLBY
                That s what the report says.  We 
                can double check...

  Charlie starts scribbling on his pad, quick calculations.  
  Then he unrolls the OCEAN CHART they ve brought along.

                              LIZ
                What, Charlie...  You can t already 
                know where the barge went?

                              CHARLIE
                No, but I know where it didn t go.
                      (using the chart)
                The Cheetah went down here.  That s 
                almost 40 miles out.  But by the 
                fuel and engine hours data, I can 
                tell you right now that this barge 
                traveled a maximum of 20 miles.  
                Round trip.

  He marks a semi-circle on the chart, 10 mile radius.

                              COLBY
                So they were never more than 10 
                miles from shore.

                              LIZ
                Which means they were no where near 
                where the Cheetah went down.

                But Charlie, all our assumptions 
                about motive, about cause... 
                they re all attributed to finding 
                that boat.

                              CHARLIE
                Then all your assumptions re wrong.

                Don suspects a murder took place on 
                board.  If I can tell him where the 
                barge went, he can hopefully figure 
                out who else was in the area...

                                MILLIE
                You mean the killer...
                      (then, a let down)
                Still, a barge...  Doesn t quite 
                have the snap and sex appeal of a 
                racing yacht, does it?

                              CHARLIE
                Not exactly.

  Charlie notices Millie is carrying two books.

                              CHARLIE
                You re reading up on chess...

                                MILLIE
                Yeah.  Lasker or Jankowski?  Which 
                is gonna give me a better shot?

                It s not the kind of thing you can 
                learn overnight.

                                MILLIE
                I m a quick study...

  Just then, two suited men, GRAVES and CORDERO, appear.

                                GRAVES
                  Professor Eppes...

                              CHARLIE
                Uh, yeah?

                              CORDERO
                      (glances to Millie)
                If you don t mind, we need to speak 
                to Professor Eppes alone.

  Charlie shrugs, apologetically.  Millie waves him off.

                                MILLIE
                It s alright, Charlie.
                      (re: the books)
                I ll read them both.

  She goes.  Cordero shuts the door after her.

                              CHARLIE
                So what s this about?

  Graves and Cordero reveal their ID s.

                                GRAVES
                We re with the National Security 
                Agency.  We have a situation.  
                We re hoping you can help us out.

                              CHARLIE
                I ve always been happy to help the 
                NSA whenever I can, but I m kind of 
                involved in something for the FBI 
                right now.

                              CORDERO
                We know what you re involved with, 
                  Professor.  And we know you have an 
                interest in a missing racing yacht, 
                the Cheetah.

                want you to help us find it.


  Beat.  On Charlie.  Then --

                              CORDERO
                Alright if we take a walk?

  EXT. CAL SCI CAMPUS - DAY1515

  Charlie, Cordero and Graves walk across the campus.

                              GRAVES
                Within hours of the time the 
                Cheetah went down, we had two 
                search vessels in the area.  We ve 
                worked around the clock, sonar 
                mapping every inch of the bottom...

                              CHARLIE
                And you know for certain you re  
                looking in the spot she went down.

                              CORDERO
                The boat s locator beacon gave 
                precise GPS coordinates until the 
                moment it went under...  Still, 
                despite all our efforts, we ve 
                found nothing.

                              CHARLIE
                Can I ask why the NSA is interested 
                in finding the yacht?
                      (off their silence)
                N.S.A.  Never Say Anything, I get 
                it.

  A beat.  Charlie stares off.  By chance, his eyes land on a 
  LEAF as it FALLS from a tree, wafting lazily back and forth.

  CHARLIE VISION - 

  On the falling leaf.  Part way through its gliding descent it 
  FREEZES.  Equations suddenly surround it...

  Then the leaf becomes the hull of a SAILBOAT.  More equations 
  as it resumes a descent, gliding forward as it drops...

  BACK TO SCENE - 




                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS 313/50 "Finders Keepers" GREEN Rev  11/30/06    25.

                You can t find it because you re 
                looking in the wrong place.  Here, 
                let me show you...

  He pulls a sheet of paper from the notebook he carries, 
  crumples it into a tight ball.

                              CHARLIE
                Your search pattern probably 
                assumes that the Cheetah sank 
                  something like this... 

  He drops the crumpled wad.  It falls straight down.

                              CHARLIE
                But... 

  He grabs another sheet, folds it in half, end to end.  Looks 
  around... spots a PAPER CLIP on a file Graves carries.

                              CHARLIE
                Uh...  Paper clip.  May I?

  He snatches the paper clip, attaches it to the end of the 
  folded sheet - a crude PAPER AIRPLANE.

                              CHARLIE
                In reality, the Cheetah probably 
                sank more like this.

  Released, the paper flies forward before hitting the ground.

                                GRAVES
                It glides forward.

                              CHARLIE
                      (growing enthusiasm)
                That s right, it glides.  And a 
                boat like the Cheetah, a boat of 
                that sophisticated a design...  
                It s practically going to fly 
                  underwater, traveling laterally 4, 
                maybe 5 feet for every foot it 
                falls.

                Knowing what I know about the hull, 
                and given the depth of the water, I 
                should be able to determine, with 
                pretty good accuracy, just how far 
                she could ve traveled before 
                hitting bottom... and then the NSA 
                can refocus their search.

                              GRAVES
                How long will it take you?

  Charlie looks invigorated by the chore.

                              CORDERO
                Oh, and Professor...  This is a 
                matter of National Security.  It s 
                  need-to-know only, so not a word to

  Off Charlie --

  INT. FBI - WAR ROOM - DAY1616

  TIGHT ON the mug shots of Chris and Robert Morris.  REVEAL 
  Liz studying them.  She turns to Megan.

                              LIZ
                If the Morris barge was never near 
                where the yacht went down, they 
                weren t after the yacht.

                              MEGAN
                Maybe they re involved in one of 
                the drug operations you were 
                talking about...?

                              LIZ
                Drug runners usually stay further 
                out, in International waters.  But 
                I don t think we can rule it out.

  Colby ENTERS, interrupting.

                              COLBY
                Just talked to the E.R.T. lab.  The 
                other two blood traces we found on 
                the barge...  they definitely 
                belong to Chris and Robert Morris.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS 313/50 "Finders Keepers" GREEN Rev  11/30/06    27.

                              LIZ
                How big a leap would it be to 
                assume they re dead, same as their 
                diver?

                              COLBY
                Would explain why we can t find 
                them.  And if the killer dumped 
                their bodies at sea, they could ve 
                drifted anywhere by now...

                              MEGAN
                Wait a minute, maybe not.  Hand me 
                the Coroner s report on the diver.

  Colby grabs the FILE, hands it to Megan.  She flips pages, 
  pulls out an AUTOPSY PHOTO of the dead diver s legs... 

                              MEGAN
                Can we put this one up?

  Colby uses his lap top computer, puts the PHOTO up on the big 
  screen.  Megan points to impressions on the diver s ankles.

                              MEGAN
                The impressions on his ankles.  
                Report says they re consistent with 
                having been caused by a rope. 

                              COLBY
                Not from the fishing net?

                              LIZ
                More like something was tied around 
                his ankles.  A weight probably.

                              MEGAN
                Whoever threw him in the ocean 
                probably anchored him down.  Only 
                in his case, the rope came loose 
                somehow.  He drifted free, ended up 
                in the fishing net.

                              LIZ
                If that s true, then the other two, 
                Chris and Robert Morris... they 
                could still be anchored to the 
                bottom right where they were 
                dropped.

  Beat.

                              ALAN
                Doesn t mean anything other than 
                what it means...  You make the 
                choice of what needs to be done 
                when.  I trust that choice...

  Charlie isn t calmed.  In fact, just the opposite.

                              CHARLIE
                You know what?  Forget it, it s 
                moot now anyway.  I m just about 
                done with what I was doing.  I m 
                tired, I m hungry... but I ll stay 
                out here and do what Don wants me 
                to do...

  Alan watches Charlie confused...  then goes --

  EXT. FBI - BRIDGE - NIGHT1818

  Don comes out of the building, onto the bridge.  Liz is 
  there, on her cell phone.  She hangs up looking annoyed.

                              DON
                Hey.  What s up? *

                              LIZ
                My new landlord.  She was supposed 
                to let the cable guy in today.  She 
                forgot... for the third time.

                              DON
                That s not really what I meant... *

  They stand a beat, awkward...  Liz tentative -- *

                              LIZ
                Look, Don...  Last time, with us...   *
                I was just passing through.  Now  *
                I m assigned here, and... *

                              DON
                And... *

                C mon.  It gets complicated now. *

                              DON *
                Why? *

  Liz pauses, thinks. *

                              LIZ *
                Because I like you. *

                              DON *
                I m right there with you. *

  Liz takes him in, scrutinizing, not wanting to get hurt. *

                              LIZ *
                But I m thinking we may want  *
                  different things. *

                              DON *
                I just want to get to know you  *
                better. *

                              LIZ *
                People will find out. *

                              DON *
                So what? *

                              LIZ *
                This is the bureau.  It matters.*

                              DON *
                A lot of agents are together. *

  Beat.  She s still wary. *

                              LIZ *
                And where does your prosecutor  *
                  girlfriend fit into all this? *

                              DON *
                She doesn t. *

  Just then, Charlie appears, not realizing he s interrupting.   *
  He hands Don some rolled up charts.

                We want it.  But the search boat 
                won t be able to go out until 
                morning when it s light.

                              LIZ
                You were able to map out the 
                barge s path?

                              CHARLIE
                Sort of.  I laid out a large grid.  
                They ll have to search it.  But 
                there s a better than 83% chance 
                that it covers the Morris barge s 
                  operations...
                      (then)
                And it s just as I figured.  They 
                never left the shallow water...

  EXT. COASTAL CLIFFS - PALOS VERDES - DAY (STOCK FOOTAGE)1919

  Establish the FBI s SEARCH BOAT trawling just off the 
  shoreline.  If possible, footage also establishes submersible 
  drone or remote underwater camera going into the water.

  INT. FBI - TECH ROOM - DAY2020

  With a few extra monitors, the Tech Room has been set up to 
  receive a live feed from the Search Boat.  Displays show 
  detailed sonar, underwater video, radar and depth images...

  Charlie sits at the desk, marking the ship s progress over 
  the search grid.  Colby and Liz look on --

                              CHARLIE
                GPS coordinates put them right on 
                the edge of Abalone Cove...

                Charlie, we re going to be coming 
                around to the port side now, and 
                beginning another pass...

  Charlie leans forward to a microphone, slightly awkward --

                              CHARLIE
                      (into microphone)
                Uh, copy that.

                Charlie, you said last night 
                there s an 83 percent chance the 
                Morris barge was actually working 
                within your search grid. 

                              CHARLIE
                Yeah, that s right.

                              LIZ
                So there s still a 17 percent 
                chance they weren t...

                              CHARLIE
                Wow, I didn t realize you were such 
                    a glass-half-empty type.  83 
                percent is actually a very high 
                  probability. 

  A FLASH of something passes across the video monitor, then 
  it s just more murky water and ocean bottom.

                              COLBY
                Whoa.  Go back.  What was that?

                      (over speaker)
                Yeah, Charlie.  Sonar mapping s 
                picking it up too.  Let me steer 
                the camera back around.

  They all watch the screen, P.O.V. of an underwater camera, as 
  the Tech steers the camera drone with a JOYSTICK.

                              COLBY
                It was back this way a little bit I 
                think.

                              CHARLIE
                He ll get it...

  Suddenly on the monitor, the unmistakable form of a human 
  body, anchored to the bottom by its ankles.

                              LIZ
                It s a body.

                Negative.  This is much bigger.

  Eyes go to the video monitor - as the camera moves along the 
  murky bottom... finally reaching the stern of a boat, canted, 
  resting on the bottom...   CHEETAH .

                              COLBY
                It s the Cheetah.

                              CHARLIE
                It can t be.  I ve done all the 
                  calculations.  It shouldn t be 
                anywhere near here.

                              LIZ
                It shouldn t be, Charlie.  But it 
                is.

  On Charlie... and the Cheetah s image on the monitor --

                                  ACT THREE

  TWO SECOND GRAPHIC BUMPER:

  EXT. MARINA - DAY2121

  CHEETAH has been raised from the ocean floor and now hangs in 
  a sling next to the docks, water still draining off her.  Six 
  large LIFT BAGS hang from her rails - deflated balloons.  Don 
  crosses toward the yacht with Charlie and Colby.

                              CHARLIE
                None of this makes sense.  Every 
                piece of data available says this 
                yacht went down 40 miles out to 
                sea.

                              DON
                So how d she end up on the bottom 
                so close to shore?

                              COLBY
                We don t know.  But Morris Salvage 
                knew right where to look.

  They reach Liz, standing next to the Cheetah.  She s 
  examining one of the deflated LIFT BAGS.

                              LIZ
                Here s something else that doesn t 
                add up.  Lift bags.  They re used 
                to raise a sunken ship to the 
                surface.  But these were already on 
                the Cheetah when we found her.

  She turns one over, revealing some familiar markings.

                              DON
                M.M.S.  Morris Marine Salvage.

                              LIZ
                They d already brought her up.

                              COLBY
                Why would someone bring a 2 million 
                dollar prize to the surface... and 
                then throw it back?

  Attention shifts to the NSA s Graves and Cordero as they 
  comes stomping down the dock, flashing badges.

                Where s the Agent in Charge?

  Someone points toward Don.  They make a bee-line... until 
  they see Charlie.  They veer toward him instead.

                              CHARLIE
                That s not true, honestly.  I m as 
                  surprised as anyone we found her.

                                GRAVES

                I don t even know what this is about,

                      (finally, reluctant)
                NSA s been tracking an arms dealer 
                named Hashim Aziz.  He s Pakistani, 
                  terrorist ties, on every agency s 
                watch list...

                              DON
                And you think he s somehow 
                  connected to the racing yacht?

                                GRAVES
                Aziz recently transferred a large 
                sum of money to Reid Sarasin.

                              DON
                Sarasin.  That s Cheetah s  
                skipper.

                The reason for the payment is 
                unknown.  Best guess now is that 
                the yacht was smuggling something 
                for Aziz...

                              DON
                Which explains why someone would

  Megan, Liz and Colby.  Colby with the ocean chart showing the 
  Cheetah search area out in deep water.

                              COLBY
                All search efforts for the Cheetah 
                were focused way out here... and 
                really for only one reason.

                              MEGAN
                Because that s where the locator 
                beacon stopped transmitting.

                              COLBY
                The assumption was, it stopped 
                  transmitting because the yacht went 
                under water.

                              LIZ
                But there are other reasons the 
                beacon might ve quit, right?

                              MEGAN
                Like if someone turned it off.

                              LIZ
                But why do that?

                              COLBY
                Say you re the skipper, Sarasin.  
                You re the only one left on board, 
                you re taking on water, and you re 
                  smuggling something.

                              MEGAN
                You re gonna try to get your boat 
                to shallow water.  That s the only 
                way you ll be able to recover 
                whatever you re smuggling.

                              COLBY
                But you don t want anyone else to 
                know where the yacht ends up.

                              LIZ
                I get it.  Once my crew s gone, I 
                turn off the homing beacon, and aim 
                my yacht for the closest 
                  shoreline...

                              COLBY
                Explains how the boat ended up so 
                close in.  And how the Morris guys 
                knew right where to look for it.  
                Sarasin told them.

                              MEGAN
                      (realizing)
                Which means he didn t drown at sea.  
                He s still alive!

  Off their reactions...

                No good deed goes unpunished, 
                right?

                              DON
                Don t worry about the NSA guys.  
                They re over it already.

  Beat.  Something else is bugging Charlie.

                              CHARLIE
                I feel bad I back-burnered your 
                stuff to work on theirs.

                              DON
                Charlie, what re you gonna do?  You 
                didn t have a choice, right?

                I don t know, maybe I did... 
                      (beat, off Don)
                I was so obsessed with that yacht - 
                truth is, when they offered me a 
                chance to work on it, I jumped.

                              DON
                      (beat, teasing)
                Then maybe you do have something to 
                feel bad about.

  Charlie smiles.  The air s cleared.

                              DON
                If you re interested, NSA thinks 
                the Cheetah was smuggling 
                something.

                              CHARLIE
                      (dawning)
                  Smuggling...  Makes perfect sense.

                              DON
                What, you already knew that?

                              CHARLIE
                No.  But it explains why I couldn t 
                find a flaw in the boat s design.  
                The hull only failed because the 
                yacht was carrying an extra load, 
                weight it wasn t designed to 
                handle.
                      (then, curious)
                What were they smuggling?

                              DON
                Don t know.  The race took them to 
                16 different ports all over the 
                world.  Whatever they were carrying 
                could ve been loaded on anywhere.

                              CHARLIE
                That s not true.

                              DON
                Why not?

                              CHARLIE
                I studied the boat s performance.  
                The Cheetah s pace slowed slightly 
                following the stop in Singapore...



                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS 313/50 "Finders Keepers" GREEN Rev  11/30/06    41.

                              DON
                Which would indicate they took on 
                extra weight, right?

                              CHARLIE
                Matter of fact, it wouldn t be 
                  difficult to calculate exactly how 
                much extra weight they took on...

  A beat between them.  Then they hurry toward the building.

                  Katyushas are common, but not

                We know the guidance systems were 
                pulled from the Cheetah just about 
                38 hours ago.

                              MEGAN

  INT. FBI - INTERROGATION - DAY2828

  JANETTE SARASIN sits at the table.  Early-40s, face weathered 
  from wind and sea, but, no doubt, she was a beauty once.  
  Megan sits opposite her, close, while Colby paces.

                              MEGAN
                You don t strike me as a woman in 
                  mourning, Mrs. Sarasin.

                              JANETTE
                That s because I haven t given up 
                hope my husband will be found.

                              COLBY
                Sure.  That or he s already 
                  contacted you, told you he s alive.

                              JANETTE
                That s ridiculous.  There s still a 
                search on looking for him...

  Beat.  Megan eyes Janette a moment, smiles.

                              MEGAN
                Married to a man who races yachts 
                around the world.  Must be pretty 
                  exciting.

                              JANETTE
                I really don t do much traveling 
                  anymore...

                              MEGAN
                I didn t mean exciting for you.  I 
                meant exciting for him...  Can t 
                imagine he s around much, though.  
                And you have three children?

                              JANETTE
                What do my kids have to do with this?

                              MEGAN
                Just helps me to fill in the 
                picture, that s all.  And what I 
                see is you, at home, raising kids 
                alone, while Reid sails around the 
                world, partying it up like he s 
                still 25 years-old...
                      (eyes Janette hard)
                Haven t you made enough sacrifices 
                for this guy already?



                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS 313/50 "Finders Keepers" GREEN Rev  11/30/06    46.

    CONTINUED:2828


  Another beat.  Janette s trying hard to look tough.

                              COLBY
                The nature of what your husband was 
                smuggling, Mrs. Sarasin, means we 
                can classify him as a terrorist.  
                You re helping him, so in effect, 
                you become a terrorist as well.  
                You can be held indefinitely...

                              MEGAN
                Means you d be sacrificing your 
                kids too.  You really ready to do 
                that for him?

  Megan lets that hang.  Janette s wavering --

                              MEGAN
                Would he ever do that for you?

  EXT. MARINA - BOAT SLIPS - NIGHT2929

  Cordero comes down the dock.  Colby and Liz are waiting for 
  him.

                              COLBY
                It s a cabin cruiser, belongs to a 
                friend of the Sarasins.  The wife 
                says he s been hiding out there...

                              CORDERO
                Your lead...

  Colby s the first to start toward the boat.

  EXT. MARINA - CABIN CRUISER - NIGHT3030

  The three Agents cautiously approach the vintage CABIN 
  CRUISER.  Lights are on.  Guns drawn, they silently board, 
  take positions.  Colby pounds hard on the cabin door --

                              COLBY
                Reid Sarasin.  Federal Agents!  
                Come on out!

  A beat.  Nothing.  Colby steps back, then kicks the door in.

  INT. CABIN CRUISER - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS3131

  Guns up, the three Agents enter the cramped cabin.  Spaces 
  are narrow, tight.  Lots of hiding places.  Dim light adds to 
  the sense of danger...



                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS 313/50 "Finders Keepers" GREEN Rev  11/30/06    47.

    CONTINUED:3131


  Room to room, Colby, Liz and Cordero search the cabin.  Under 
  bunks, in the head, storage cabinets...  Finally --

                              LIZ
                He s not here.

  Cordero points to some food wrappers, dirty dishes --

                              CORDERO
                Looks like he was.  Could his wife 
                have tipped him off?

                              COLBY
                No.  But maybe she knew he was 
                already gone.

  EXT. MARINA - CABIN CRUISER - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS3232

  The Agents emerge onto the deck, glance around.

                              LIZ
                I ll call it in to Don.  Maybe they 
                wanna have another go at the wife.

  As Liz pulls her phone, Colby sees something on the forward 
  rail - a torn piece of FABRIC, snagged on the top edge.

  He moves forward, looks into the water alongside the boat...  
    A concentric RIPPLE emanates out from under the nearest dock.  

                              COLBY
                Liz.  Hold up.

  She puts away her phone, joins Colby, sensing something s up.  
  Then Colby spots something in the water, points.

                              COLBY
                There.  What s that?

                              LIZ
                Looks like the tip of a snorkel.

  Sure enough, it s the top 2 inches of a SNORKEL, barely 
  visible sticking up from the water.  Colby grabs a discarded 
  CONTAINER off the ground, fills it with water...

  He then dumps it into the open tip of the snorkel.  Almost 
    immediately, REID SARASIN comes sputtering up to the surface.

                              COLBY
                Alright, Captain Nemo.  Up on the 
                dock.  Let s go.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS 313/50 "Finders Keepers" GREEN Rev  11/30/06    48.

  Don and Graves in with Reid Sarasin.  Sarasin has dry 
  clothes, but his hair is still wet, tousled as --

                              SARASIN
                You think I chose to put those 
                crates on my boat?  My life was 
                  threatened.  I was forced to.

                              DON
                And were you forced to cash that 
                big check they wrote you too?

  Beat.  Sarasin shakes his head, burdened --

                              SARASIN
                The whole thing unraveled when the 
                damn boat started leaking.  It was 
                supposed to be easy.  Sail in, 
                unload the crates, sail out on the 
                next leg of the race...

                Two guys.  I don t know their 
                names.  I just had a phone number.

                C mon, you can do better than that.  
                Unless you want to take a triple-
                murder rap alone.

                              SARASIN
                Wait.  I didn t have anything to do 
                with that!  I just sail boats, 
                that s all.  I didn t kill anybody.

                show them where the Cheetah went 
                down so they could recover the 
                crates.

                You gotta be pretty damn committed to 
                the cause to be smuggling missiles 
                into the U.S.  Does NSA have an idea

                Hashim Aziz is an arms dealer at

                Which means it could be anyone...

  Graves paces on the phone in the b.g. as Don appears.

                He does it anytime he goes to the 
                toy box.  Let s say he s looking 
                for his favorite yellow truck.

  AUDIENCE VISION - a small yellow toy truck sits alone in the 
  bottom of a toy bin.

                              CHARLIE (V.O.)
                But the truck is in a bin full of 
                all his other toys...

  The toy bin fills with other toys, hiding the yellow truck.

  Stuffed animals magically disappear.  Then blocks and action

                toy truck.

  All toys except the yellow truck disappear.

  Under the orange wash of mercury-vapor lamps, we find the 
  yellow BOX VAN parked alongside the warehouse.  Sounds of 
  ships loading in the distance, train engines...

  Out of the shadows, the Agents appear - Don, Colby, Liz, 
  Cordero and Graves ( casual tac ).  Colby uses a flashlight 
  to peer inside the box van.

  The Agents storm in, looking for immediate cover.

  Colby and Graves go right, paired up.  Suspect #1 fires.  The 
  Agents hold cover, then rise and return fire.  Then --

  They hug cover, not knowing where the next shot might come 
  from...  Colby makes a lateral move to the right for 
  position.  Suspect #1 fires again.  Graves fires, forcing 
  Suspect #1 back.  As Colby makes another move to the right --

  Cordero spots the crates, motions toward them.

  Don makes a move, goes.  Liz follows.  Suspect #1 sees them, 
  raises his gun, taking aim...  Colby rises behind him.

                              COLBY
                Drop it!

  Suspect #1 doesn t.  Colby FIRES, sending Suspect #1 tumbling 
  down the stairs...

4141INT. DOCK WAREHOUSE - NEAR THE ROLL-UP DOOR - NIGHT 

  Behind the wheel, Suspect #2 races toward the open roll-up 
  door, making his escape.

  Don appears in his path.  Suspect #2 s only escape route is 
  right at Don... and he s not slowing...

  Don levels his gun, BLAM BLAM!, fires TWO SHOTS through the 
  windshield, right next to Suspect #2... then swings his gun 
  straight on.  The next pull is the kill shot...

  Suspect #2 slams on the brakes.  Don s lit up by the 
  headlights in the swirl of dust as the car comes to a stop.

                              DON
                Hands!  Lemme see your hands!

  But Suspect #2 s not giving up.  He opens the door to bail 
  out on foot.  But as the door opens...

  Liz appears and kicks it shut hard, pinching Suspect #2 
  between the car and the door.  As the door bounces open 
  again, she levels her gun...

                Get on the ground!  Down!

  Don s there as Suspect #2 complies.  He moves in, twists back
