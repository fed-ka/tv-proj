A Boeing 737 roars into the night sky.
COACH CLAYTON (V.O.)
Had a 108 yard kickoff return against
Taft. Michigan's been down to see
him twice.
We see a run-down tenant SHACK on the edge of a large cotton
field.
Battered and old, in a declining Pennsylvania neighborhood,
hard by a STEEL WORKS.
Joe leads Darnell down to the end of the tunnel, where Autumn
is waiting. He introduces them. She's even more attractive
than Darnell thought she'd be.
She takes Darnell's hand and leads him out onto the field
where he's greeted by the E.S.U. BAND playing the school
fight song. The CHEERLEADERS whip into action, legs kicking,
pom-poms whirling.
The band parts and Darnell walks out into the 90,000 seat
stadium, an awesome sight for any young man. Autumn points
to the giant DIAMOND VISION SCOREBOARD. Darnell's name and
picture appear. The stadium P.A. ANNOUNCER cuts in.
P.A. ANNOUNCER
Now for the starting line-up for the
E.S.U. Timber Wolves. At tailback,
number 20, Darnell Jefferson!!
DARNELL
You got that right.
Darnell, in his excitement, does a little end-zone dance.
Slaps hands with Joe.
Romantic, Ivy-League look, lit by soft-glo footlights. Darnell
and Autumn walk, side by side, stopping outside Autumn's
dorm.
DARNELL
Thanks for showin' me around, Autumn.
I don't meet too many females like
you. You got a lotta class. Real
efficacious. Maybe I'll check you
out in the fall.
AUTUMN
I hope so, Darnell.
He leans down to kiss her. She hesitates, not sure about
this, then comes forward, kisses him on the lips, starts to
let it deepen, then breaks it off.
AUTUMN
Good night.
As he watches her go up the steps, we go to:
Early February: It's National Decision Day and Darnell's
home is under seige. Reporters. Microphones. Television
cameras. Darnell steps out onto the porch wearing an ESU
jersey with #1 emblazoned on it.
DARNELL
Now you know where I'm going and
what we're indubitably going to be.
MUSIC and TITLES END.
A hot, late summer day. Over the deserted Quad, we see the
title: 6 MONTHS LATER.
It fades and we MOVE TO REVEAL a city BUS pulling up at a
curb adjacent to the Quad. Off steps Darnell, carrying one
battered suitcase. Joe Kane and BUD LITE KAMINSKY, offensive
line tackle, are there to greet him.
JOE
Hey, Darnell, Welcome to E.S.U.
DARNELL
(shaking hands)
Yeh, good to see you guys. What
happened to the band and the dancin'
honies?
JOE
Regular students don't come back for
two weeks yet. Not that they woulda
been here. Now that you've enrolled,
you're just another wormshit freshman.
College hang-out, bar, catering to athletes and their
admirers. A black HARLEY DAVIDSON, driven by Joe Kane with
Darnell on the back, pulls up at the curb. They get off,
head inside.
The crowd from the 911 (Bud, Alvin, Lattimer, Darnell, Bobby
and Louanne) follow Joe down the hill behind the bar toward
a busy two-lane highway. Joe, a little drunker than the
others, starts HOWLING at the moon like a Timber Wolf. The
others join in.
BUD
What are we doin', Joe?
JOE
(slightly slurred)
There's something I wanta try. Gotta
wake up our Mojo. Start settin' the
tone for the season.
BUD
This is not a good time to be settin'
anything. You're in no shape...
Suddenly Joe makes a dash out onto the highway.
BUD
Joe, c'mon Joe, don't be an asshole.
Joe! God-damnit, why's he always
doin' shit like this? Coach'll fuckin'
kill me. Alvin, go get him, will ya?
ALVIN
Hell no, you go get his ass. Crazy
motherfucker.
Joe stands on the white line, cars and trucks whizzing by,
then lies down on his back, arms at his side.
JOE'S POINT OF VIEW
Cars and trucks blast toward us, roar on by, right on top of
us, honking, spraying grime, shaking the asphalt.
Bud and the others on the side of the road are increasingly
worried now.
BUD
Fuck this shit.
Pissed off, Bud sprints out to the white line. The draft-
wake of a passing truck almost blows him over.
BUD
C'mon, Joe, that's enough. Let's get
the hell outa here. What if somebody
drifts or crosses the line to pass?
JOE
What's the matter, Bud? Can't you
follow?
Bud hesitates a second, scared, but stung by this dare.
BUD
(torn)
God-damnit, god-damnit. Shit.
Bud can't fight it. He lies down on the line, his head
touching Joe's feet. Joe begins to HOWL again. Bud joins in.
Alvin and the others can't believe it.
ALVIN
Startin' to look like a loaf of Wonder
bread out there.
BOBBY
They're makin' us look like pussies,
ya know. Standin' here suckin' our
thumbs.
LATTIMER
(to Alvin)
Yeh, and there's nobody from the
Defense out there.
Bobby and Lattimer look at each other a beat. Time to ante
up. Both turn to Alvin.
ALVIN
What are you lookin' at? You think
you're bad?
Alvin snorts in disgust and starts out onto the blacktop.
Bobby and Lattimer smile, go to follow. Louanne grabs Bobby,
holds him back.
LOUANNE
(vaguely sexual)
Bobby, be careful, o.k? Please, be
careful.
Bobby smiles, grabs her ass, pulls her to him, gives her a
long, passionate kiss, then sprints out to the white line,
leaving her breathless.
Alvin, Bobby and Lattimer lie down in front of Bud. Now
there's a line of five, a human highway median. Everybody
scared shitless, howling their lungs out.
Louanne and Darnell watch from the side of the road.
DARNELL
This guy do this kinda shit a lot?
They never mentioned this in
recruiting.
Finally, Joe laughing wildly, jumps up and they all scramble
back to safety. Out of breath, but pumped up, they exchange
exhilarated high fives. Alvin just shakes his head.
DISSOLVE TO:
Darnell and Joe walk across campus. Darnell carries a
gleaming, chromed TROPHY with a football player on top. He's
still thinking about the test.
DARNELL
I don't know... I left a lot of 'em
blank.
JOE
Don't worry, you'll do all right.
Lotta people don't finish.
DARNELL
(not convinced)
Yeh.
JOE
What are you doin' with the trophy?
DARNELL
Coach Winters asked me to bring it
to the meeting. I don't know what
for.
Suddenly Darnell sees Autumn walking across the Quad.
DARNELL
I'll see ya at the meeting.
(handing him the trophy)
Take this for me, will ya?
Joe starts to protest, but Darnell is already off, racing
across the Quad, quickly catching up with Autumn.
DARNELL
Hey, Autumn, hold up! What're you
doing here? I thought students didn't
come back for two weeks.
AUTUMN
(rather coolly)
I came back early to see a friend.
DARNEL
You're looking fresh, Autumn. A
package of pulchritudiness. What
about getting together later tonight?
Maybe get a pizza? They got pizza in
this town don't they?
AUTUMN
I can't tonight.
DARNELL
How about tomorrow night?
AUTUMN
I don't think it's a real good idea
for us to see each other, Darnell.
DARNELL
What's the matter? I'm not good enough
for you all of a sudden? Too young,
is that it? I'm not, ya know. They
held me back a year.
AUTUMN
No, it's not that... I've got a
boyfriend.
DARNELL
Did you have this boyfriend when you
showed me around?
AUTUMN
(reluctant to admit
it)
Yes.
DARNELL
Yeah, well, it didn't seem to bother
you then. I'm willing to overlook it
now.
AUTUMN
I was mad at him.
DARNELL
For what?
AUTUMN
I caught him with another girl. A
white girl.
DARNELL
And you're still with this nigger?
She nods, slightly embarrassed.
AUTUMN
Look, I got to get going, Darnell.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to lead you
on. I'm glad you came here.
She starts walking away.
DARNELL
Wait a minute. I can at least walk
with you, can't I? Nothin' wrong
with that.
She speeds up. He speeds up.
AUTUMN
I'm in a hurry.
DARNELL
I can keep up. I run the forty in
four-four.
She's just about to say something when RAY GRIFFEN arrives.
Ray's the starting tailback, black, handsome, clean-cut,
well-spoken, middle class.
RAY
Hey, Autumn --
This is exactly what Autumn didn't want to happen. Ray and
Darnell eye each other like a couple of roosters.
AUTUMN
Hi, Ray. This is...
DARNELL
(cutting in, offering
his hand)
Darnell Jefferson.
(pointedly)
Tailback.
RAY
(shaking Darnell's
hand)
Ray Griffen.
(just as pointedly)
Starting tailback.
DARNELL
I know. That's why they recruited
me.
Autumn can't believe he said this. She starts to interject
something to break the tension, but never gets the chance.
RAY
The two guys they recruited before
you are handing out Gatorade now.
(making the jerkoff
motion)
Better start strengthening your wrist.
DARNELL
We'll see.
(departing, to Ray)
Give my best to Miss Lilly.
Autumn's mortification is complete.
RAY
(to himself)
What the hell is that supposed to
mean?
Establish the new, modern KELLER CENTER, home of the E.S.U.
Athletic Department.
Passing drills. Joe Kane takes a snap, fades to pass, throws
an out. The ball sails two feet over the receiver's head.
Joe's angry with himself.
COACH CLAYTON
(to Winters)
He's too pumped up. Tryin' to win
the damn Heisman on every throw. I'm
not sure he's ready for all this
hype.
COACH HUMES
Little late to be worryin' about
that. If we don't follow up the Sports
Illustrated cover with something,
it'll look like we didn't believe in
our own player.
WINTERS
Don't worry, Joe's a tough kid. He'll
be allright.
Scrimmage. Joe hands off to Darnell. He sweeps right, cuts
it up, blows past the end. In a spectacular display of broken
field running, Darnell breaks to the sideline, cuts back,
eluding the corner back, and stiffarms the safety. Alvin,
pursuing the play, finally tackles him from behind, stripping
the ball at the same time. There's a wild scramble for the
fumble. Darnell is crushed under the pile, as the defense
recovers it, ruining an otherwise brilliant run.
The players unpile to reveal Darnell, writhing on the ground,
the wind knocked out of him. Ray Griffen runs by to take his
place.
GRIFFEN
Hey, nice writhing, Jefferson. You
got all the moves.
WINTERS
(shouting to the team)
Allright, move it up. Let's go, 15
yards, run the next play.
The scrimmage moves up 15 yards leaving Darnell behind.
Winters sprints over to Lattimer, grabs him by the face mask.
WINTERS
Cut the necktie tackle horseshit.
You think you're in some kinda
highlight reel? He left you huggin'
air. Target his guts. Drive right
through his abdomen. I wanta see
snot bubbles in his nose. I wanta
see shit in his underwear.
Lattimer nods chastised. Winters moves over to check on
Darnell.
WINTERS
You injured, Jefferson, or just hurt?
DARNELL
(gasping)
What do you mean?
WINTERS
If you're hurt, you can still play.
If you're injured you can't. Are you
hurt or are you injured?
DARNELL
I think I'm just hurt.
WINTERS
O.k., then get up.
Winters extends a hand. Darnell grabs it, struggles shakily
to his feet
WINTERS
Nice run. Think what it coulda done
for us if we still had the ball.
(handing him the ball)
This is a football. I want you to
carry it with you wherever you go.
Never let it out of your sight.
(to the rest of the
team)
Any of you see him on campus, take a
swipe at the ball. Try to knock it
out of his hands. Recover it.
(to Darnell again)
If anybody, but you, returns this
ball to me, you'll wish you'de never
been born.
Winters wheels off leaving a wobbly Darnell alone with his
football.
WINTERS (V.O.)
This isn't gonna get it, goddamnit.
Opening day of school. We take CUTS of students arriving,
football players checking out the new girls from atop the
wall of the athletic dorm, Louanne and Autumn greeting
returning sisters at the sorority, students registering for
classes etc.
Camille comes out the front door, summoned by the horn. She
stops at the sight of something. We REVERSE TO REVEAL Joe on
his Harley.
CAMILLE
We goin' on that?
JOE
Yeh. I thought we might take a ride.
CAMILLE
I promised my dad I'd never get on
one of those.
JOE
What are you, one of these trust-
fund princesses? It's fine for me to
play a game I don't know, but I ask
you to try somethin' different and
you hide behind your daddy.
He holds out a motorcycle helmet toward her, daring her. She
burns, but her competitiveness makes it impossible for her
to decline this challenge.
CAMILLE
(snatching the helmet)
All right. But we go slow. No cowboy
stuff.
Joe smiles and kicks the starter. Camille climbs on and they
roar off.
Just outside town. Joe and Camille come down the highway at
moderate speed. Camille's hanging on for dear life, but we
can tell she's enjoying it.
JOE
This speed, o.k.?
CAMILLE
Yeh, fine.
JOE
Good.
Joe immediately accelerates, throwing Camille's head back.
Her SHRIEK is lost in the whine of the engine, as they speed
away from camera.
CAMILLE
Slow down, damnit. Joe... Joe!
They approach a high-banked turn, beyond which appears to be
a long, sheer dropoff. Joe looks back at Camille, smiles
devilishly, not looking where he's going. Camille sees they're
heading straight for the edge.
CAMILLE
(freaked)
Joe, look out!!!
Too late. Joe brakes, fishtails, but goes over the top of
the bank, off the edge, flying out into oblivion, Camille
screaming.
CUT TO:
ANGLE ON HARLEY
As it plops down onto a wide LEDGE not visible from the road,
three feet below the top of the bank. Joe lands it, skids to
a professional stop, breaks into raucous laughter. Camille
jumps off the bike, scared stiff and livid with anger.
CAMILLE
How could you do that, you stupid
punk? It isn't funny, god-dammit,
you coulda killed us! You're crazy,
you know that...
JOE
Take it easy. I've done that a hundred
times. No big deal.
CAMILLE
Oh, yeh? Then why are you shaking?
JOE
(embarrassed)
I don't know... I guess cause I've
never done it with someone else on
the bike.
CAMILLE
You just wanted to scare me. Are you
happy now?
JOE
Yeh, pretty much. And the scream was
even better than I thought it'd be.
Every dog within hearing distance
wants to mate with you now.
Camille's ready to throttle him, then something catches her
ear. Sure enough, there are SEVERAL DOGS BARKING in the
distance. Joe smiles at her. She looks away, still angry,
but amused in spite of herself.
Joe watches Bud Lite, Darnell, Alvin and Lattimer file in
and unveil a life-size CARDBOARD STAND-UP of Joe's Sports
Illustrated cover pose. They whoop it up, as Joe tries to
muster some enthusiasm.
Darnell and Autumn are having a daytime tutoring session on
a secluded patch of lawn. Darnell holds his football. As he
begins to read aloud from East of Eden, Autumn pokes the
ball out of his hand. They both scramble for it, Darnell
winding up slightly on top of her. They eye each other a
beat. Darnell bends down to kiss her. She lets herself kiss
him for a second, then gets up and starts to collect her
books.
Lattimer, in his euphoria, races out into the lot, and begins
head-butting car windows. He breaks out three in a row, and
yells in triumph, his forehead dripping blood.
Winters, walking with the TEAM TRAINER, has seen this from
across the street. He knows there's something dark at work
here.
WINTERS
N.C.A.A. is gonna test half the team
before the game Saturday. Make sure
Lattimer knows about it.
MUSIC AND MONTAGE END
The crowd stands, waving banners, as the E.S.U. kicker comes
forward and kicks the ball high into the fall sky. The
MISSISSIPPI STATE RETURN MAN fields the ball at the four
yard line and returns it to the 22 where he's buried. The
defense trots out and huddles up.
ALVIN
All right, let's get evil. 60 minutes,
balls out. Let's open a can of kick-
ass. Kill 'em all. Let the paramedics
sort 'em out.
The Mississippi State offense breaks it's huddle, comes to
the line of scrimmage. Alvin, prowling behind the line, locks
eyes with the tailback, No.23.
ALVIN
Hey, 23, don't think I don't recognize
you, you little fuck.
The tailback looks away.
ALVIN
Hey, pay attention when I'm talkin'
to you, nigger. You're the guy that
shot my mother aren't you?
TAILBACK
What?
ALVIN
You were tryin' to steal her fuckin'
car weren't you, cocksucker.
TAILBACK
Shut up. I never heard of your mother.
On the sidelines, Darnell is watching this exchange.
DARNELL
(to Joe)
What's Alvin saying to that guy?
JOE
Just gettin' himself pumped up.
DARNELL
He wasn't pumped up already?
ANGLE ON ALVIN AGAIN
ALVIN
(to tailback)
Thought I'd never find you didn't
ya? But I got you now nigger, and
I'm gonna kill you motherfucker. I'm
gonna bust your guts open and watch
you die.
The ball is snapped. The quarterback pitches to the tailback
as Alvin charges into the hole, screaming at the top of his
lungs. The tailback, eyes wide with fear, cuts back, away
from Alvin, where he's promptly crunched by Lattimer. The
ball flies loose, there's a scramble, Alvin comes up with
it. E.S.U. ball.
ANGLE ON
The bench and stands erupt as Lattimer and Alvin but heads
and trot off the field.
WINTERS
Atta baby, Alvin, heads up. Big pop,
Steve, way to stick 'em.
(turning to Joe)
O.K. Joe, let's go up top. Take it
to 'em right away.
Joe leads the offense on. A disappointed Darnell stands on
the sidelines.
JOE
(in huddle)
O.K. let's put the women and children
to bed, and go lookin' for dinner.
Don't let em up. 51 Strike, Orange
left. On 4.
Joe begins to howl like a wolf. The others join in. A pack
of Timberwolves. They break the huddle, come to the line of
scrimmage. Bud Lite begins to sing.
BUD LITE
Bali Hi, will call you, anytime, any
day. Here am I, your special island...
Bud lines up opposite a big, black DEFENSIVE TACKLE.
BLACK TACKLE
Shut up, snowflake. You think you're
in the school play?
BUD LITE
No, Bali Hi, the endzone is calling.
And the highway runs right over your
ass.
BLACK TACKLE
Bullshit, you're gonna be my bitch,
baby. You gonna be my punk bitch.
BUD LITE
(singing again)
So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen,
good night, I hate to go and leave
this pretty sight.
Joe hits the 4 count, and the ball is snapped. Bud Lite and
the Big Tackle fire out. Bud drives a forearm into the stomach
of the Black Tackle, doubling him over. The Black Tackle
comes back, slamming a forearm up under Bud's chin, snapping
his neck back.
Joe, meanwhile, fades to pass, pump fakes, steps up. Bud
Lite, chicken fighting the Black Tackle, sticks his fingers
in the Tackle's eyes, then cut-blocks him to the ground. The
Tackle falls on Bud, and smashes a fist into his ribs. Bud
rolls him over.
Joe spots his flanker back, MAURICE WARD, on a flag pattern.
Lofts a perfect spiral to him in the corner of the endzone.
Touchdown.
The crowd goes wild, as Bud Lite pushes off the Black Tackle's
throat getting up from the pile. Joe pumps a fist in the
air, hugs Ward, as the team celebrates. MUSIC BEGINS.
FADE THROUGH TO:
ANGLE ON SCOREBOARD
It reads E.S.U. 28, Mississippi State 20. 4th Quarter.
WINTERS
Jefferson! In for Griffen.
Darnell jazzed at his first chance to see action, buttons
his chinstrap, races onto the field.
HARVEY (V.O.)
2:05 left. Kane hands to Jefferson...
ANGLE ON DARNELL
He takes a handoff, runs a trap up the middle, is hit by
THREE TACKLERS, clawing at the ball. They bring him down,
but Darnell doesn't fumble. He gets up, still clutching the
ball, and starts back to the huddle with it. The REFEREE
hustles after him.
REFEREE
Excuse me, son, but we're gonna need
that football for another couple
minutes.
Darnell, suddenly realizing, gives it up. Even Winters has
to laugh. We go to:
ANGLE ON LATTIMER
Lattimer, sacking the quarterback, tackling him high, ripping
his helmet off. Lattimer runs off the field, holding it up
like a trophy.
The gun sounds, the game is over.
ANGLE ON COACH WINTERS
Accepting congratulations from his staff.
WINTERS
Guess we'll be on the payroll for
another week.
ANGLE ON BUD LITE AND THE BLACK TACKLE
walking off the field together, both their jerseys blood-
stained.
BUD LITE
Good game, man. Really enjoyed it.
BLACK TACKLE
Yeh, you're a strong motherfucker.
Shitty singer though.
Joe walks across campus, headed for Camille's dorm.
BERMAN (V.O.)
Michigan also won big today. Timothy,
"He Could Go All The Way Men", will
be looking to do so against the
Timberwolves. And of course the able
Kane will be looking to also. I can't
wait.
Darnell sits alone on a bench under an old Willow, just
staring out at the night. He hears a voice behind him.
VOICE (V.O.)
So where you wanna go?
He turns. It's Autumn.
Camille, carrying an armload of books, comes down the library
steps, having been studying late. As she heads for her dorm,
she sees Joe and Sheri going across the Quad; Sheri draped
around Joe, nuzzling him.
Joe looks over, spots Camille, stops; surprised, embarrassed
to see her. They exchange a look. Camille, upset, turns and
wheels off. Joe wants to say something to her, but can't get
it out.
ON DARNELL AND AUTUMN
We don't know where yet, but they seem to be slipping and
sliding, clutching on to each other.
AUTUMN
You're right, nobody would ever see
us here.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL
A very nervous Bobby Collins comes down the hall and knocks
on Coach Winter's door.
WINTERS
C'mon in, Collins.
Joe is posed in front of the school library, one of it's
more photogenic buildings. T.V. sportscaster LYNN SWANN and
his video crew wait to interview him as a MAKEUP GIRL finishes
applying makeup to Joe's face. Publicist Sharon Braver watches
like a hawk.
SWANN
(to his cameraman)
We ready, Jerry? O.K., let's mark
it.
An assistant marks the take, and Swann turns to Joe.
SWANN
Joe, this game is being billed as a
potential "Heisman Shootout". Did
you feel any added pressure this
week...
A phalanx of photographers crowd around, snapping away as
Joe goes through passing drills.
SWANN (V.O.)
...knowing that you're going head to
head with Heisman rival, Tim Waymen?
JOE
Well, ya know, you try to block it
out, but it's basically impossible...
Everybody seems to be talkin' about
it, all the newspapers, the
interviews...
Sharon Braver steps directly in front of the video camera,
waves off the take.
BRAVER
Hold it! Hold it!
SWANN
What?! What's the problem?
Braver takes Joe aside, talks to him confidentially.
BRAVER
What you're saying is true, of course,
but I don't think it's the message
you want to send.
BRAVER
This game is nationally televised,
so most Heisman voters will be
watching. I think a more casual
approach is better. Modest,
controlled, casual.
Joe nods and heads back in front of the camera.
SWANN
(to Braver, irritated)
We all set now?
(gets a nod)
Let's mark it.
(the take is marked)
Joe, this game is being billed as a
potential "Heisman Shootout."
A huge bonfire burns, as a large segment of the student body
has gathered in front of the Timberwolf statue. The
cheerleaders, all wearing "KANE IS ABLE" buttons, whip the
crowd up, as Joe is introduced on the podium.
SWANN (V.O.)
Did you feel any added pressure this
week, knowing that you're going head
to head with Heisman rival, Tim
Waymen?
The cheerleaders begin to chant, "Let's go, Joe." On "Joe",
they assume the Heisman trophy pose. Joe seems slightly
embarrassed by it all.
JOE
No, I don't really think too much
about that kinda thing.
Swann shoots Braver a poisonous look.
Joe and Camille sit on a bank looking down at the railroad
tracks below. Neither says anything. Joe seems strangely
preoccupied. Camille decides to break the silence.
CAMILLE
Your parents comin' to the game
tomorrow?
JOE
My mom's dead. My dad has never seen
me play.
CAMILLE
Why not?
JOE
Guess he's not that interested in
football.
CAMILLE
But you're one of the best players
in the country.
JOE
(snapping)
He's just not into it, o.k.?
CAMILLE
(chastised)
O.k.
(silence)
What's goin' on, Joe? You ask me out
here, like you wanta talk about
somethin', then you don't say
anything. You worried about tomorrow?
JOE
No... I'm worried about the days
after that. I just. I don't know...
I feel like tomorrow's gonna be my
last game. I want to stay up, make
the time go slow.
CAMILLE
Why would it be your last game? You
afraid of getting hurt?
JOE
No, that'd be a relief. Then, at
least, I wouldn't be a failure.
CAMILLE
Joe, why are you thinking like this?
Why would you be a failure? You're
having a great year, you're a Heisman
Trophy candidate, you got millions
of dollars waiting for you in the
pros.
JOE
(testy)
How do you know what's waiting for
me? You don't know me at all.
CAMILLE
(hurt)
I don't know you? How can you say
that?
JOE
Because you wouldn't be here now if
you did. You only know the guy that's
supposed to make millions in the
pros.
CAMILLE
Is that what you think? That I'm
with you for the money?
JOE
Why else?
Infuriated, she slaps him across the face.
CAMILLE
Fuck you, Joe.
(starting to cry)
I don't give a shit about your money.
I don't even give a shit about
football. And you know what? Maybe
you're right, maybe I don't know
you.
She turns and storms away up the hill, as we hear a TRAIN
WHISTLE. Joe watches her go, then starts down the hill toward
the tracks as the train comes into view.
Camille stops, turns back, sees Joe headed for the tracks,
starts to worry.
Joe reaches the grade and steps into the middle of the tracks
facing the oncoming train. Horrified, Camille runs down the
embankment toward him.
CAMILLE
Joe! Joe! My god, Joe, what are you
doing? No! No!
As the train approaches, it's horn blaring, Joe lies face
down on the tracks, his hands gripping the railroad ties.
Camille arrives at the bottom of the hill in time to see the
train race over him. She falls to her knees screaming.
Under the train, we see Joe desperately hugging the ground,
head down, toes dug in, hands clutching the ties. It's like
a tornado under there, dirt debris flying everywhere, his
clothes flapping wildly.
The train passes. Camille looks up, afraid to breath as Joe
lies motionless on the tracks. Suddenly he stirs, pushes
himself up to his knees. She lets out a scream of joy, races
toward him, as he gets to his feet, stumbles off the grade.
She hugs him to her, tears streaming down her face, helps
him over to the embankment.
CAMILLE
God Joe, oh god, are you allright?
JOE
(drained)
Yeh, just got some dirt in my teeth.
Guess you've really seen the dark
side now, huh? You should've gotten
out while you had the chance. Before
it all goes to hell.
CAMILLE
I don't wanta get out, damnit. What's
wrong Joe? Why would it all go to
hell?
JOE
I'm a Kane, Camille. That's all it
takes. We're cut out to be drunks
and fuck-ups. We never live up to
expectations. It's in our blood. My
dad, brothers, uncles -- we all drink
and sooner or later we all fuck up.
My dad went the longest. Waited till
he was playin' triple A ball, before
he hit the wall. Sometimes I feel
like I'm just waiting for my turn.
The better I do, the closer it gets.
CAMILLE
You're not like them, you can beat
all that. You can stop drinking, you
can break the chain.
JOE
If I gave up that, I wouldn't be
much of a football player. And if I
wasn't a football player, what would
I be?
The question hangs in the air.
CAMILLE
You'de still be Joe. And I'd still
love you.
He pulls her to him, kisses her hair, they slump against
each other.
JOE
Just don't say I never warned you.
STEVE ZABRISKIE and BO SCHEMBECKLER in the foreground, the
jammed to capacity stadium in the background. This shot is
going out on nationwide T.V., the college Game of the Week.
ZABRISKIE
4:29 to go and it's been a great
one. Two undefeated teams goin' after
each other. Michigan up by four, 24-
20, but the lead has changed hands
three times, and you get the feeling
that whoever has the ball last is
gonna win it.
ANGLE ON FIELD
Joe brings the offense to the line of scrimmage. Yells
signals.
SCHEMBECKLER (V.O.)
Well, it was billed as a Heisman
shootout, and it's been all of that.
Both Waymen and Kane moving their
teams up and down the field, having
big days.
Joe fades to pass, looks right, looks left, can't find a
receiver, decides to run for it. He sprints up the middle,
15, 10; a SAFETY comes at him at the 5. We see
Joe's P.O.V. through HELMETCAM. He pushes the lunging safety
away, turns back just in time to be blasted by the OTHER
SAFETY he never saw. Joe is knocked down, over the goal line
and out cold. The crowd goes wild.
ZABRISKIE (V.O.)
Kane back to pass, can't find anybody,
gonna run it himself, ten, five, hit
at the goal-line... Touchdown E.S.U.!!
Great run by Kane!
Joe lies motionless as his teamates run over to him.
SCHEMBECKLER (V.O.)
He's still down. Looks like he's
hurt.
We go to Winters, worried on the sideline, as the celebration
around him begins to die down.
ANGLE ON JOE
As he's carried off the field, his arms around two linemen's
shoulders, and lowered onto the bench. We go to a BLURRY
IMAGE of a man's face waving something. We REVERSE to REVEAL
a DOCTOR waving smelling salts under Joe's nose. Joe begins
to come around. The doctor holds up two fingers.
DOCTOR
How many fingers am I holding up?
JOE
Four.
Michigan comes to the line of scrimmage. As Tim Waymen gets
under center, Alvin begins to yell at him.
ALVIN
Hey, powderpuff. You're the white
boy that ratted my brother out. Sent
him to jail, cocksucker. Ran off
with the fuckin' money. Left the
blood to do the time, huh?
Waymen begins to call signals.
ALVIN
Yeh, you're the little bastard.
Account of you, my bros' datin' his
cell mate. You hear me, powderpuff?
Gonna make you pay. You gonna be my
cellmate now. You gonna have 250
lbs. of pissed-off nigger up your
ass.
ZABRISKIE (V.O.)
E.S.U. in an eight-man line looking
for the run on third and short.
The ball is snapped. Waymen fakes a handoff to his fullback,
hides the ball on his hip, fades to pass. On the sideline,
Coach Winters yells, "Pass! Pass!"
Alvin's not fooled by the run, he shakes his blocker and
takes dead aim on Waymen. Just as Waymen releases the ball,
Alvin blasts him, driving him into the turf.
ZABRISKIE (V.O.)
Waymen fakes to Simms, Mack on the
blitz, Waymen is goin for it all!
Hit as he throws.
The ball, however, flies through the air, a perfect spiral.
The E.S.U. secondary has been fooled by the play fake and is
a step behind. The ball comes down in the hands of the
Michigan tight end, JERRY HUNT.
ZABRISKIE (V.O.)
Hunt has got a step. He's got it!
Touchdown!
Winters slams his headphones to the ground.
SCHEMBECKLER (V.O.)
Great clutch throw under pressure.
Can't do it much better than that.
ANGLE ON JOE
The Doctor examines Joe, shines a light in his eyes, makes
him track his finger, etc.
DOCTOR
You're vision's back to normal.
WINTERS
You think you can go?
JOE
Yeh, I'm fine. Just a little headache.
(getting up, shouting
to his teamates)
O.K. Offense, let's get it back.
Alvin, meanwhile, plops down on the bench in disgust.
ALVIN
Damn tough to scare that little white
boy. Either his momma dropped him on
his head, or the motherfucker is
deaf.
Coach Winters goes to Darnell.
WINTERS
Jefferson, in for Griffen.
Griffen slams his helmet to the ground.
Joe breaks the huddle as the E.S.U. offense comes to the
line.
ZABRISKIE (V.O.)
Ball on the Michigan 47, 1:02 to go,
Kane brings 'em to the line of
scrimmage.
Joe fades to pass once again, lets the rush come, then flares
out a screen pass to Darnell. Darnell grabs it and takes
off, slipping tackles, cutting back, juking. Darnell finally
runs out of bounds at the twenty.
ZABRISKIE (V.O.)
Great run by Jefferson, the highly-
touted Freshman, the longest of the
day for the Wolves. And this one is
turning out to be everything we
thought it would be.
ANGLE ON DARNELL
coming back to the huddle, pumped up. Joe kneels in the
center.
JOE
O.K., time to put the women and
children to bed, and go looking for
dinner.
He begins to howl, as do all the others. The Call of the
Wild.
JOE
82 Strike, Eagle, Crown, on 2.
They clap hands, come to the line. Joe looks over the defense,
bends under center and barks signals, The ball is snapped.
Action goes to SLOW MOTION.
Joe fakes to Darnell, fades to pass. The Michigan cornerback
comes on a blitz, locked on Joe. Joe starts to roll, but
knows the corner will catch him. On the run, he launches the
ball toward Darnell. Darnell opens his hands to receive it,
but at the last second, the Michigan SAFETY steps in front
and intercepts it.
ZABRISKIE (V.O.)
Kane looking for Jefferson. It's...
Intercepted! Intercepted by Freeman!
And that should do it.
Joe sinks to his knees in frustration. The blitzing cornerback
does a quick pit-pat on Joe's helmet. Winters looks like
he's been punched.
As Michigan and Tim Waymen celebrate on the sideline, we go
to:
Darnell comes out of the locker room, having showered and
dressed. He's surprised to see Autumn and her father talking
to Coach Humes.
DARNELL
Hey, Autumn.
AUTUMN
Hi, Darnell.
DARNELL
Is this your dad?
AUTUMN
Yes...
DARNELL
How do you do, Mr. Haley. I'm Darnell
Jefferson.
MR. HALEY
Jefferson? Nice run you made on that
screen pass. Another block and you
might have scored.
DARNELL
Thank you. We'll get 'em next year.
MR. HALEY
How do you and Autumn know each other?
You a friend of Ray's?
Darnell is jolted by this question. It's obvious that Autumn
has never told her dad about him.
AUTUMN
(filling the void)
Ah, I tutor him...
MR. HALEY
Oh really? In what?
Darnell would like to crawl under a rock.
DARNELL
Math and English.
MR. HALEY
Ah.
There's a slight tone of condescension in Mr. Haley's voice.
He realizes Darnell hasn't passed his entrance exam. This is
not lost on Darnell.
MR. HALEY
Well, stay on top of that, Darnell.
I'd have been in real trouble if I
hadn't gotten my degree. I played
ball once. Hurt my knee.
DARNELL
Yeh, I know...
MR. HALEY
I used to put a copy of my report
card inside the webbing of my helmet
to remind me that college was more
important than football.
DARNELL
(forcing enthusiasm)
Good idea. Well, I gotta get goin'.
Nice to meet you Mr. Haley.
MR. HALEY
Nice to meet you, Darnell.
DARNELL
See you around, Autumn.
Before Autumn can respond, Ray Griffen approaches from the
other direction.
RAY
Hey, Mr. Haley. Good to see you.
MR. HALEY
Hey, Ray. You still havin' dinner
with us tonight?
Darnell embarrassed and humiliated, hears all this as he
walks away. Autumn wants to go explain, but can't in front
of her father.
A speeding car goes by us, weaving, crossing the yellow line
on the curves.
Darnell's walking across campus toward class. Autumn sees
him, calls out to him.
AUTUMN
Darnell, wait. C'mon Darnell, I wanta
talk to you.
Darnell doesn't slow up. Autumn has to run to catch up.
AUTUMN
Where you been, I been callin' you?
DARNELL
Been busy.
AUTUMN
Darnell, I'm sorry about Saturday.
It was an awkward situation.
DARNELL
It wasn't awkward. It was educational.
I realized how you see me. I'm good
enough to tutor, to go places with,
but not to tell your father about.
AUTUMN
That's not it. It's just that my
father expects me to be with somebody
like Ray. He wouldn't understand us.
DARNELL
(stopping)
Why not?
AUTUMN
I don't know... he likes Ray cause...
DARNELL
He's a good student, he acts right...
he doesn't need football. He's class
and I'm not, right?
AUTUMN
I didn't say that.
DARNELL
You don't have to, Autumn. I'm
everything your dad used to be and
don't want you fallin' back into.
AUTUMN
Darnell...
DARNELL
You were right before, Autumn. I
should have another tutor. Thanks
for everything you did for me.
Darnell walks away. Autumn can only watch him go.
Winters and Galen Howard are walking across the field after
practice. The stadium is deserted.
HOWARD
I been talkin' to Chancellor Wilson...
WINTERS
What's he wanta do now, cut practice
down to once a week?
HOWARD
No, he's happy with the way the
season's gone so far. The Alumni
have pretty much stayed off his back,
but with Joe out now, it could all
be up for grabs again.
WINTERS
He thinks he's gonna have trouble
marchin' the ball down the old fund-
raisin' board, huh?
HOWARD
The facts are, all we have left are
freshman quarterbacks, and nothin' I
saw at practice today, convinced me
that any of them are ready to step
in.
WINTERS
What are you sayin?
HOWARD
We gotta get Bobby Collins back.
WINTERS
Wilson say that?
HOWARD
He didn't have to.
WINTERS
Forget it, Galen, Collins is no All-
Star either.
HOWARD
Yeh, but he's good enough to get us
a split of the next four games.
WINTERS
Look, just because you're Wilson's
boy all of a sudden, doesn't mean
I'm gonna let him make me look like
a fuckin' whore.
HOWARD
Don't give me that high and mighty
shit. There's a lotta people on the
bubble here. Four straight loses and
we're out of bowl contention. How's
that gonna make you look? If you're
too stupid to consider your own
situation, then maybe you oughta
think about your assistant coaches.
They've got families to feed too.
Howard walks away, pissed off, leaving Winters alone in the
middle of the field.
Learnihan and Winters come down the steps, their faces set.
As they split off:
LEARNIHAN
Another case like this, I'll take it
all the way up to the Governor.
WINTERS
Don't mess with me, Learnihan. I'll
have you teachin' Study Hall.
7) Darnell, with his books, on the way to the library, passes
the frat house where the victory party is in progress. He
sees Ray and Autumn walking together. Autumn sees him, her
face lights up. He gives her a slight smile, keeps walking.
She watches him with a certain longing.
The E.S.U. defense is on the field. Alvin moves up opposite
the OFFENSIVE GUARD.
ALVIN
I know you, motherfucker. You're the
prick who got my little sister
pregnant. We ain't seen you around
lately. Where you been, huh? Answer
me, motherfucker, or I'm gonna peel
your cap.
The ball is hiked. Iowa runs a sweep left. Lattimer tries to
get outside to contain, but is blocked by the fullback, who
goes low and cuts his legs out from under him.
WINTERS
Shit, Lattimer...
Alvin pursues the play as the ballcarrier heads for the
corner, then suddenly cuts back. Alvin has overrun the play
slightly. We go to SLOW MOTION as he turns and is hit with a
wicked CRACK-BACK BLOCK by the guard he taunted. Alvin's leg
flexes at a horrifying angle. We HEAR THE SNAP of bone and
tendon, as Alvin plummets to the ground, writhing in pain,
grabbing his left leg.
WINTERS
Oh, no...
The doctor and trainers sprint out to the field.
Alvin is being strapped on the stretcher.
ALVIN
(wailing in pain)
Oh, shit, oh shit, I'll kill that
motherfucker. I'll... Oh shit...
An ambulance carrying Alvin emerges from the stadium. We
hear CHEERING inside, the SIREN outside.
HARVEY (V.O.)
Twelve seconds left, Iowa driving
for the winning touchdown. Fourth
and goal at the one. E.S.U. trying
to hold on without their star middle
linebacker, Alvin Mack.
The E.S.U. defensive line digs in. Lattimer tries to suck up
his remaining strength.
Iowa runs a blast to Lattimer's side. He fights through one
block, the ballcarrier coming right toward him. They meet in
a titanic collision at the goal line. The back keeps driving,
twisting. Lattimer tries to hold him, but weaker than he was
on steroids, is unable to. The back falls over the goal line.
Touchdown. IOWA 13 E.S.U. 10.
As the Iowa players celebrate all around him, Lattimer sits
where he fell, a beaten and humiliated young man.
REPORTER (V.O.)
Coach, you've lost two of your last
four.
Joe walks out with his suitcase. Coach Winters waits for
him. Shakes his hand. They get in the car.
WINTERS (V.O.)
Congratulations. I'm proud of you,
Joe.
Camille comes off the court, after tennis practice. She's
surprised to find Joe waiting for her.
JOE
Hello, Camille.
CAMILLE
(cool)
Hello, Joe. You allright now?
JOE
Yeh... yeh, I think so.
CAMILLE
Good, I'm happy for you.
She starts to walk away, heading for the bike racks.
JOE
Camille, hold on, O.K.? I'm sorry
that I didn't want... that I couldn't
see you.
CAMILLE
You couldn't even talk to me. What
happened to "there's somethin' goin'
on between you and me"?
Camille gets on her bike...
JOE
C'mon, Camille, I was embarrassed. I
couldn't...
and pedals off.
JOE
(shouting after her)
I couldn't understand why anybody
would wanta talk to me. Camille!
She just keeps on going.
A bus comes up the hill toward us, on the main street of
Joe's sooty, little home town, the huge stacks of moribund
steel works filling the sky in the background. The bus stops
at a corner. Joe steps off. No bag. He's not planning on
staying long.
Joe goes to the front door. Knocks, gets no answer, pushes
the door open, walks through the messy, cluttered house to
the back porch. Seated in a metal folding chair, smoking a
cigarette, looking out at the yard is Joe's DAD. He's got a
couple days growth of beard, and although not drunk now, he
has the look of one.
JOE
How ya doin', Dad?
DAD
(surprised to see him)
Joe! What's this? They throw you
out?
JOE
No.
JOE'S DAD
I heard about your little set-to.
They had it on the news here.
JOE
Yeh, they sent me to rehab.
JOE'S DAD
We know what that's worth. Your
brother's been through it three times.
Joe nods sadly.
JOE'S DAD
So what are you doin' here?
JOE
I've been thinking about some things,
Dad.
JOE'S DAD
That's what that damn rehab'll do.
Make you think about a lotta things
you can't do nothing' about.
JOE
I kinda been wonderin' why you never
came to any of my games. All those
years.
JOE'S DAD
Oh, I don't know. I guess I didn't
wanta make you nervous. You mighta
tried too hard and screwed up.
JOE
Or I mighta done real well. Which
woulda been harder on you, Dad?
JOE'S DAD
(sensing the anger)
What do you mean?
JOE
Mighta made you feel bad. Like maybe
it wasn't written someplace that we
all gotta go on our ass. Like maybe
you coulda done somethin' more, if
you'de tried a little harder.
JOE'S DAD
Or maybe I didn't wanta see you
gettin' all excited, all pumped up
with pride, when I knew one day it
would all come crashin' down. Just
like it did.
JOE
I think I spent the last couple years
hopin' I'd die before that day. But
you know what Dad? That day came and
I'm still here. And I got one more
game this year. I don't know how
well I'll play or even how much, but
I want you there.
JOE'S DAD
How would you feel introducing your
drunk dad to all your friends? You
think about that?
JOE
I could live with it, if you could.
(handing him a ticket)
Here's a ticket. Section 2, Row 6.
Fifty yard line. If you don't come,
I'll never ask you again.
JOE'S DAD
O.K., Joey. And good luck.
They give each other a short, quick hug. Nothing sentimental.
Joe walks back through the house. His dad stares out at the
yard.
Joe takes a snap, fades to pass, throws an out. The ball
flutters badly, falling short.
CLAYTON
He's rusty. I doubt if we can start
him.
WINTERS
(simmering)
He's worse than that. He's outa shape.
(blowing his whistle)
All right, that's enough for today.
Practice is cancelled. Everybody off
the field, but Kane.
(the players hesitate)
C'mon what the hell are you standin'
around lookin' at? Get outa here.
The players, surprised at this turn of events, begin to file
off. Even the coaches are baffled. Winters walks over to
Joe, who has no idea what this is about.
WINTERS
Didn't do much while you were in
there, did ya?
JOE
Well, we didn't exactly have a team...
WINTERS
You could've worked out on your own.
JOE
I had some other things to worry
about...
WINTERS
Well, we're gonna make up for lost
time. We'll start by hoppin' the
steps.
JOE
Hoppin' the steps?! What, you're
gonna punish me now.
WINTERS
Don't talk back to me, Joe. I'll
kick your ass. I went easy on you,
'cause you had to get through detox,
but that's out to sea now. You let
this team down; you let this program
down. Start those steps. Right leg.
ANGLE ON JOE - STADIUM
Hopping up the stadium steps on his right foot, laboring as
he passes Winters, halfway up.
WINTERS
Now the left.
Joe switches to his left foot and continues hopping up the
steps, his quadriceps bursting with pain.
DISSOLVE TO:
JOE - LATER - STADIUM
hanging by his arms, moving hand over hand along the crossbar
of the goalpost, panting with fatigue, Winters watching from
below.
DISSOLVE TO:
JOE - AT SUNSET - STADIUM
Bone weary now. Winters has him run 20 yards, get down and
do 10 pushups, run another 20 yards, do 10 more pushups etc.
Joe staggers the 20 yards, drops to do his pushups, can only
do 4. Winters yanks him to his feet, pushes him forward to
run again.
WINTERS
70 guys. 70 guys who busted their
butts all year. Because of you they
might not win the conference. Because
of you they might not go to a bowl.
JOE
(barely able to stand)
I didn't wanna leave... I just screwed
up...
WINTERS
You dogged on them.
JOE
(stopping, exhausted)
No, no I never dogged. I worked my
ass off. I played hard...
WINTERS
(pushing him forward)
Then you shoulda stayed in shape.
Keep runnin', dammit.
JOE
(wobbling, starting
to break down)
I always played hard. I gave my
everything for you. When you came to
the Center, I thought you were really
worried about me. But you don't give
a shit. We're all just a buncha sled
dogs. If you had another guy who
could throw, you'da left me in the
fuckin' hospital.
(falling to his knees,
sobbing)
The only thing that matters is the
program, the god-damn program.
Winters pushes Joe down to do his pushups. Joe has to strain
mightily to do two.
WINTERS
Nobody forced you to play football,
Joe. Not me, not the program, nobody.
But when you sign on, you commit
yourself to pay the price, to do
whatever it takes. Well, you haven't
paid the price yet. You still owe
this team. You owe this team big-
time.
(walking away)
Get a shower.
Joe tries to get up, but collapses face down on the turf, as
Winters continues to walk away.
HARVEY (V.O.)
Wolves movin' left to right on your
radio dial. Looking to generate some
offense. They've been up and down
the last few weeks.
ANGLE ON BOBBY COLLINS in the huddle.
COLLINS
28 Thunder right. On go.
They break and the E.S.U. offense comes to the line. Collins
calls signals. We go to SLOW MOTION as he fades to pass.
Darnell fakes a block, then rolls out for a screen pass.
Georgia Tech's defensive line comes hard. Bobby flips the
ball over the charging defenders. Darnell catches it, gets a
good block from Bud Lite, then tucks in behind Ray who is
out ahead blocking.
There's only one linebacker to beat and Darnell will be into
the secondary. Figuring Ray will block the guy, Darnell begins
to look for the safeties. Ray, however, barely brushes the
linebacker, who doesn't even break stride. He lowers his
head, and drives into Darnell, his helmet hitting the
football. Fumble! There's a scramble. The Yellow Jackets
free safety comes up with it.
REGULAR SPEED
The crowd and the E.S.U. bench, quickly deflated, sit back
down. Darnell gets to his feet, glares at Ray, but says
nothing. He knows Ray tanked the block.
Bobby Collins fades back to pass, is rushed, throws a quick
sideline, but it's a little short. The Yellow Jackets'
CORNERBACK sprints up, intercepts it and runs 30 yards down
the sideline for a touchdown.
HARVEY (V.O.)
Collins back to pass, rushed, now
fires out in the flat. It's picked
off by Hill. Down the sideline. He's
gonna go in untouched. Touchdown,
Georgia Tech.
The E.S.U. players return to their bench for the start of
the second half, gather in a circle. Joe looks up in the
stands to the seat he reserved for his father. It's empty.
BEGIN A SERIES OF SHOTS:
1) Joe takes the snap from center, fumbles it, falls on it.
2) Joe looks to throw over the middle, waits too long, is
sacked.
3) Joe underthrows Darnell coming out of the backfield.
Clayton approaches Winters on the sideline.
CLAYTON
Joe's too tentative, too cautious
out there. He seems flat. Maybe we
oughta give Collins another shot.
WINTERS
Joe just needs to get the feel back.
He'll be allright.
CLAYTON
Sam, we can't afford to wait...
WINTERS
(snapping)
I said he'll be allright.
ANGLE ON JOE
HARVEY (V.O.)
5:51 to go. Georgia Tech up 10 to
nothing. The Wolves are gonna have
to find some offense in a hurry here.
Their defense has been keepin' them
in it.
As he starts off the bench for the field, Coach Winters comes
up to him.
WINTERS
Joe, I know that Rehab was good for
you. Got rid of a lotta bad habits.
But what about the rest of you? What
happened to the Joe Kane that used
to take command of this team, the
Joe Kane these guys i'd run through
a bulldozer for? They put him out
with the trash? What are you waitin'
for, somebody to feel sorry for you
cause you've had some problems? Nobody
in this stadium gives a shit. It's
time to step up, Joe. Time to sit at
the head of the Table.
ANGLE ON THE E.S.U. OFFENSIVE HUDDLE
As Joe comes into the huddle. He's all business now.
JOE
All right, we've held these guys up
long enough. Give me time back here,
and I'll rip 'em apart. 16 shift,
green, bolt. First sound.
Joe brings the offense to the line of scrimmage, yells "Go!"
The ball is snapped, Joe drops back, hits Darnell on the
sideline. First down. In quick succession, we see Joe:
1) Complete a 15 yarder to Ray over the middle.
2) Fades to pass, is rushed. Forced out of the pocket,
scrambles for his life, manages to get down to the 4 yard
line. He gets up, surveys the distance to pay dirt.
HARVEY (V.O.)
Nice bit of scrambling by Kane to
get it to the four, but it's gonna
bring up fourth and goal. No doubt
about it, with 3:45 they've gotta go
for it here, if they're gonna get
back in this game.
ANGLE ON THE SIDELINE
Winters puts his arm around Ray who will take the play into
the huddle.
RAY
Give it to me up the gut, Coach.
They've been ignoring me. I know I
can score.
WINTERS
No, we're gonna go with the sweep.
Winters gives Ray a shove and he runs onto the field. Ray is
upset, angry. He swears to himself.
ANGLE ON FIELD
Ray enters the huddle, whispers in Joe's ear.
JOE
28 Thunder right. On 2.
The team breaks out, comes to the line. Joe looks over the
defense, screams signals as the CROWD NOISE is building.
We go to SLOW MOTION as the ball is snapped. Ray takes one
step forward then turns right, leading the play. Joe pitches
to Darnell who follows Ray. Georgia Tech's outside linebacker
comes up to stop the play. Ray stumbles before he can make
the block. He drops out of our picture.
DARNELL
Shit!
Darnell is forced to go wider toward the sideline. The
linebacker and cornerback are closing, both have the angle
on him. Darnell starts to cut back. He lowers his shoulder
to take the linebacker's blow. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Ray
reappears and throws a devastating block on the linebacker,
knocking him back into the cornerback, taking them both out.
Darnell cuts it up and blasts over the safety at the goal
line. Touchdown, E.S.U.
The stands erupt. It's the first thing they've had to cheer
about all day. Winters just looks at the clock, goes over to
talk to his defense.
Darnell foregoes his touchdown dance. He runs over to Ray,
grabs him by the helmet.
DARNELL
Monster block, man. Monster
motherfuckin' block.
Ray smiles. They butt heads and run off the field
Georgia Tech has the ball. They break their huddle.
HARVEY (V.O.)
1:11 and counting. Third and one.
The Wolves have got to stop them on
this play if they're gonna get the
ball back. A first down here and
it's all she wrote. E.S.U. is out of
timeouts.
The Georgia Tech quarterback fakes to his fullback, hands
off to his TAILBACK on the countertrap. The tailback runs
behind his big, pulling tackle, both right at Lattimer.
Lattimer takes on the tackle, sheds his block. The back lowers
his head, starts to power into Lattimer. Lattimer lets out a
fierce yell.
Smash! Lattimer explodes into the tailback, the collision
lifting the back off the ground, whiplashing his neck,
vibrating his helmet. Lattimer's legs churn, driving the
tailback back and into the ground. We see the back's face.
There are snot bubbles in his nose. No first down. No way.
Lattimer jabs both arms in the air. The crowd goes nuts, as
the defense slaps helmets, and runs off the field, windmilling
their arms, whipping up the crowd.
ANGLE ON SIDELINE
Winters congratulates the defense as it comes off the field.
He meets Lattimer, looks into his eyes. Sees the steroids
there. He knows it's the only way the kid could have done
it. Decides not to bust him. Lattimer knows it. Winters gives
his helmet a little slap, more in sympathy than praise.
ANGLE ON THE YELLOW JACKET PUNTER
He catches the snap, boots the ball away.
Darnell fields it at his 12, starts toward the right sideline,
where hemmed in, he looks like dead meat. Suddenly, he
reverses his field, racing for the opposite sideline, where
a picket line of blockers awaits him, if he can get there.
He turns on the jets, barely beating two tacklers to the
corner, and then turns it up the left sideline, picking up a
wicked series of crack-back blocks, until he's finally run
out of bounds at the Yellow Jacket 35 yard line.
ON STANDS
The E.S.U. fans are on their feet. Winters races over to
Joe.
WINTERS
Time for 2 plays. If it's not open
in the end zone, take the sideline.
As the offense runs onto the field,
Winters checks the scoreboard. 17
seconds left. Georgia Tech 10. E.S.U.
7.
As Darnell comes off the field, Autumn runs out and hugs
him, leads him to her dad.
AUTUMN
Daddy, you remember Darnell.
MR. HALEY
Yes, I do. Great catch, Darnell.
DARNELL
Thank you, sir. I got somethin' for
you.
Darnell reaches into his helmet and takes out a sweat-stained
piece of paper.
DARNELL
My entrance exam. Got a 92. Coach
Winters said you got an 87. He looked
it up.
MR. HALEY
(laughing)
I'll kill him.
ANGLE ON JOE KANE
walking toward the tunnel, acknowledging the plaudits of the
fans. He looks for Camille, doesn't see her. Coach Winters
comes up next to him.
WINTERS
Hell of a throw, Joe. Good to see
you back.
Winters gives him a quick, but firm hug.
WINTERS
And don't worry about the Heisman.
We'll gear up for it next year.
Joe manages a weary smile.
ANGLE ON BUD LITE
coming down the tunnel, Bobby Collins next to him. Both stop
as Louanne walks toward them. Bobby smiles to himself in
anticipation of her fawning over him. She walks right by him
and up to Bud.
LOUANNE
You still feel like gettin' a beer?
Bud smiles. Bobby quickly looks around for someone else to
hit on, hails a cheerleader. Bud and Louanne walk off
together. Louanne stops when she sees her father, fearful of
his reaction.
LOUANNE
He's not a football player any more.
He's graduating this year.
WINTERS
He's still got a bowl game.
Louanne waits, not sure whether her father's angry or not.
WINTERS
So make sure he doesn't violate
curfew.
Louanne smiles. Winters returns it, and walks away.
ANGLE ON STEVE LATTIMER
Sitting on the bench, his head in his hands, weeping.
HARVEY (V.O.)
An amazing conclusion to a great
season. We can see Steve Lattimer
down on the bench weeping tears of
joy as E.S.U. goes back to a bowl
for the first time in three years.
These are not tears of joy, but a man/boy who knows he'll
never be able to play pro football without steroids.
Joe sits on a bench at the intersection of four converging
Quad paths. Camille approaches from the opposite direction,
stops when she sees Joe.
CAMILLE
What are you doin' here?
JOE
Waitin' for you. I figured you'de
have to come through here on your
way to dinner.
This softens, relaxes her a bit.
CAMILLE
Shouldn't you be out celebrating?
You played real well.
JOE
I need your help with somethin'. I
know I'm not your favorite guy right
now, but it's all startin' again.
The expectations, the pressure, the
talk about the Heisman next year. I
was wonderin' if you'de like to go
somewhere, maybe share a six-pack
with me?
Camille's shocked that he might be drinking again. He pulls
a six pack of 7-Up out from behind his back. She laughs in
spite of herself. They settle again.
JOE
I miss you, Camille. I don't like
bein' without you.
CAMILLE
I'll think about it.
They look at each other a beat, come forward into a long
kiss and embrace as we pull up and back.
CREDITS BEGIN TO ROLL AS
Coach Winters, flanked by Humes and Clayton, walks down the
tunnel to a waiting car. No effigy this time.
HUMES
Tickets are in your coat. Itinerary
and player profiles in the briefcase.
We got a 9:00am tomorrow in Baltimore
with the kid from Park. Then we're
on to...
They continue down the tunnel toward a new recruiting season,
another year in the annals of The Program.
