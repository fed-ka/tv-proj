MARGARET heads down the busy street, shopping bag in
hand.
MARGARET sweeps outside the shop, glancing across the
street at-
THREE PRETTY GIRLS dolled up for the evening and arms
linked, crossing on the other side of the pavement.
PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN 1
Margaret, do you want to come to
the pictures?
MARGARET's eyes catch on the glitter of a broach in
passing. They turn to look at her WHISPERING and
GIGGLING.

PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN 2
She can't come, she's got to
study.
The FLUSH of MARGARET'S skin -
PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN 2 (CONT'D)
Miss Hoity Toity!
The STING OF EMBARRASSMENT.
THE SENSE OF THE PRETTY GIRLS WHISPERING ABOUT HER, EYES
TRAVELLING OVER her disparagingly.
ALFRED (V.O.)
Never run with the crowd,
Margaret. Go your own way.
The SWAY of a SKIRT as they walk away.
ALFRED OOV
(close to)
Open it then.
A shout in the street. A woman's voice.
CAROL OOV
Can I suggest you remove the
sticker from the back of your car.
Margaret looks through the net curtains and sees CAROL
THATCHER[early 50's] just visible stepping out of a taxi,
remonstrating with the driver, clutching her purse and
waving her credit card at him with rising irritation.
CAROL OOV (CONT'D)
Well then take the sticker off! I
call that false advertising! I
would say keep the change, but
there isn't any change.
Chaos outside the Grand Hotel in the aftermath of the
bomb.
The injured are pulled through the rubble.
NEWS READER (V.O.)
At ten to three this morning an
explosion extensively damaged the
Grand Hotel in Brighton, scene of
the Conservative Party conference.
NEWS READER 2 (V.O.)
...Where the Prime Minister and a
number of her cabinet were
staying. They escaped unhurt -
The WHIR of SIRENS-
The BLUR of FIRE ENGINE LIGHTS-
The image of a BODY being stretchered out of the rubble
by FIREFIGHTERS.
NEWS READER 3 (V.O.)
Five people have died, many others
are injured, some critically. The
IRA have claimed responsibility.
DENIS and MARGARET sit in their coats covering MARGARET's
evening dress and DENIS pyjamas. Both looking out in
silent shock at the devastated Grand hotel, reflected on
the glass of the car windows.
MARGARET looks on with quiet, sobering despair, still
numb with shock. DENIS looks at her. He grips her hand.
They sit, fingers locked.
MARGARET walking with AIREY NEAVE towards Downing Street
for a Cabinet Meeting.
All around, heaped high on either side as far as the eye
can see are bags of rubbish. But not neatly stacked, just
thrown there, many of them rotting down, spilling their
filthy, putrid contents onto the street.
SHADOW MINISTER VO
Minister, the breakdown of
essential public services -
transport, electricity, sanitation
is not the fault of the trades
unions but of this Conservative
government in which you so
shamefully serve!
The stench is awful - and MARGARET'S expression reflects
that as she picks her way through.
MARGARET makes her way through a crowd of applauding
workers in crisp white uniforms. Like them, she wears a
white cap on her head.
MARGARET
You are the backbone of our
nation! Small firms like Loveday's
Ice Cream. How are you? So nice to
meet you ladies.
General merriment as MARGARET, now inside an ice-cream
van, has a go at dispensing an ice cream from the
machine.
MARGARET (CONT'D)
I'll just have a small one,
because I'm watching my figure.
(handing the cone
out)
That's for you young man!
MARGARET among the ladies again.
MARGARET
It has to be something icy on a
stick for Denis.
Laughter.
MARGARET (CONT'D)
(returning to her subject)
That's the only way we will
produce jobs, real jobs, jobs that
sustain.
MARGARET is standing on an impromptu stage outside a
factory. She has a hard hat on her head.
MARGARET
The Trade Union Movement was
founded to protect workers. Now it
persecutes them. It stops them
from working. It is killing jobs
and it is bringing this country to
its knees. I say enough. It's time
to get up. It's time to go to
work. It's time to put the Great
back into Great Britain!
The CAMERA from behind on MARGARET rising up out of the
car, to face a waiting PRESS CORP. The jostle of a POLICE
OFFICER, DENIS and OTHERS press her either side-
MARGARET
I should just like to say that I
take very seriously the trust the
British people placed in me today,
and I will work hard every day to
live up to that responsibility.
And now, I should like to share
with you a prayer of St Francis of
Assisi: Where there is discord may
we bring harmony... Where there is
error may we bring truth... Where
there is doubt may we bring
faith... Where there is despair
may we bring hope..
The CAMERA rises up, high above MARGARET until she is
just a blue dot, on the dark tarmac, a lone woman
standing facing the circle of cameras and microphones.
The door of Number 10 looms ahead.
Chaos outside the Grand Hotel in the aftermath of the
bomb.
The WHIR of SIRENS-
DENIS and MARGARET sit in their car, looking out in
silent shock at the devastated Grand hotel, reflected on
the glass of the car windows.
MARGARET (V.O.)
That's when I thought I'd lost
you.
A TELEPHONE RINGS CUTTING THROUGH FROM ANOTHER TIME...
A journalist stands outside the Commons making his
report.
NEWS JOURNALIST
- that there must be a change in
that style of management. That Mrs
Thatcher must listen more, and on
occasion, give in.
(ARCHIVE FOOTAGE) Relentless images of violence over
this. Mass riots. PROTESTORS charging POLICE LINES.
POLICE on HORSEBACK trying to force the PROTESTORS back.
One of them - a GIRL - caught out, goes down with her
placard, is trampled beneath the horses' hooves,
horribly.
RIOTERS with blood streaming down their faces. Banners -
DEATH TO MAGGIE.
OFF WITH HER HEAD.
84
PROTESTORS
Maggie... Maggie... Maggie. Out...
out... out.
With a WHOOSH of flames the north side of Piccadilly
Circus goes up in flames. Smoke and blood and fire
everywhere.
With the Eiffel Tower illuminated behind him, Trevor
MacDonald makes his report.
TREVOR MACDONALD
Tonight in Paris Mrs Thatcher is
among thirty four world leaders
who came together to celebrate the
end of the Cold War and herald the
start of a peaceful new age of
East/West cooperation.
