Film 1


Screenplay by 
William Boyd


Based on the novel 
Boyd William by  Restless 


The story of British Secret Service operations in the USA 
during 1940-41 is one of the last great secrets of World 
War II, and indeed it remains a major political and 
diplomatic embarrassment.  The Washington Post described 
 the activities of British spies in the United States as  a
masterful covert-action programme -- arguably the most

The Renault 5 motors into a perfect, isolated English

beech trees.

IN THE CAR -- through the windscreen. Ruth sees a BIG FAT 
GUY -- in a sweatshirt, bushy sideburns -- holds up his

a couple of inches to spare on each side.

Ruth and Jochen get out, go through the gate and up the 
path to the front door.

Sitting in the doorway is a very attractive OLDER WOMAN (in 
her 60s) sitting in a wheelchair. Grey hair well cut, fine 
 mother, SALLY featured. Shrewd eyes.  This is Ruth s

SALLY

Ruth and Jochen look on in astonishment as Sally wheels 
herself into the hall.

Sally steps out of it.  Smiles brightly. She kisses them.

SALLY
I fell and hurt my back. Doctor 
said not to overdo the walking.

She opens the door and peers out. MOVE IN ON HER FACE -- 
her eyes narrow, darting her gaze here and there, looking 
for something. She relaxes. Shuts it again.

SALLY
Did anyone follow you?

RUTH

But Sally strides past them and into the kitchen. Ruth 
follows Sally into the big kitchen. Jochen trailing behind.

Ruth glances back and she and Jochen look at each other.

Aga, picture-window overlooking a meadow and woods behind 
the house.  Remains of lunch on the table. 

Sally and Ruth sit facing each other. Jochen is playing in 
the garden. We can hear his whoops and shouts, OVER.  

Sally pours them each a glass of wine. Ruth is rolling a 
cigarette.  Sally contemplates her daughter.RESTLESS FILM 1  YELLOW REVISIONS  4.7.12      5

EXT    PARIS STREET/ MARKET     DAY66

It is 1939. A Paris street. A ROW OF MARKET STALLS have 
been set up. SHOPPERS bustle here and there. 

AT THE END OF THE STREET -- a MARCH heading towards us. 
Tricouleurs, banners saying ACTION FRANCAISE. They are 
  A SNARE DRUM beating time. MEN singing the  Marseillaise .
marching in time to the rhythm. Some wearing medals, some 
tricouleur sashes. RESTLESS FILM 1  YELLOW REVISIONS  4.7.12      8      


CAMERA FINDS -- a very BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN -- late 20s. 
 DARK HAIRED. Red lips, hair loosely tied back. She s
reading a newspaper. Glancing through it. She lowers it, 
hearing the music. And then looks impatiently down the 
street both ways for someone -- her head tilted in a 
certain way.

But, despite the difference in colouring, something about 
her says immediately that this is the young Sally 
Gilmartin/Eva Delectorskaya. That way of tilting her head, 
the unflinching gaze, that makes this VERY obvious. She 
folds her newspaper, picks up the basket at her feet.

SOUND of the march getting closer as we FOLLOW Eva to a 
market stall.

He heads off, gives her a wave.  Eva shouts after him.

EVA
Be careful!

She smiles. Impossible Kolia.  She watches him cross the 
road, head up the street.  She sees him greet ANOTHER MAN. 
Wearing a brown Trilby and a tweed coat.  They head off 
together. Kolia talking animatedly as if they know each 
other well.  Eva heads for the fruit stall, thinks nothing 
of it.

end of a row, discreetly noting things down in a small 
notebook.

A FOLDED note is being passed down the row towards him. 
Kolia looks round, takes it, surprised.

He opens it, reads. Frowns.  He stands and leaves the hall 
going out a side door.

Kolia steps out. Closes the door behind him. 

Looks up and down. Waits a moment. Nobody. Looks at his 
watch. OVER -- more CHEERS and APPLAUSE from the hall.  
Thunderous applause.

Kolia gives up, lights a cigarette and heads up the alley. 
He stops.

THREE MEN -- coats, hats -- appear at the end.

TWO MORE MEN coming up behind.  They close in on him. Big 
MEN with slab-like, unsmiling faces. They hem him in.
