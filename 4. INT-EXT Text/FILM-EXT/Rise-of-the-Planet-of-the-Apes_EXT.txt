She sits in a tree with ALPHA, her mate - large and muscular,
a PROMINENT WHITE BIRTHMARK ACROSS HIS SHOULDER, LIKE A
SHOOTING STAR.
Around them, under the TREE CANOPY, a COMMUNITY OF
CHIMPANZEES naps, eats, plays.
A DOZEN POACHERS on horseback slog through the jungle.
They're working towards the GROVE, visible in the distance.
As they near it, the LEADER points, sending the MEN moving
quietly, NETS and RIFLES ready.
Alpha sits up, sensing something. BIRDS take sudden flight.
He stands on the branch and YELLS OUT A WARNING. FEAR
ignites the community - but too late.
POACHERS BURST INTO THE CLEARING, horses' hooves kicking up
dirt. CHIMPS SCATTER.
Bright Eyes wants to stay by Alpha's side, but he bares his
teeth and sends her off.
Then he drops, landing firmly on the clearing floor. All
around him, POACHERS pursue terrified apes, nets swinging.
MALE CHIMPANZEES jump up and down, SHOUTING AND SCREECHING -
an aggressive show. A futile attempt to protect the tribe.
Alpha zeroes in on a POACHER attempting to scoop up a YOUNG
CHIMP. He streaks across the clearing, KNOCKS THE POACHER
FROM HIS MOUNT.
Alpha POUNDS his CHEST, letting out a BATTLE CRY -- trying to
rally a counter-attack.
But the other chimps pay no heed. There's no organization to
the defense. It's chaos.
SHOTS RING OUT. The Chimps mauling the Poacher drop, one by
one. Others take off.
2.
Alpha spots Bright Eyes across the clearing, dragged off in a
net. He RUSHES to save her, leaps in the air...
A SHOT RINGS OUT.
BRIGHT EYES WATCHES - HORRIFIED - AS ALPHA CRUMPLES IN THE
AIR AND FALLS TO THE GROUND. LIKE A STONE.
FADE TO WHITE
TWO FACES wearing SURGICAL MASKS lean in and peer down at us.
FRANKLIN - broken horn-rimmed glasses - and CAROLINE - curly
red hair under a sterile cap.
CAROLINE
Nanotherapy, beta version: Tuesday,
March 10, 2011. Female Test
subject Number four.
Franklin reaches for us, smiles...
FRANKLIN
Here we go, Bright eyes.
A MIST fogs our view for a moment.
CAROLINE
Not too much. She needs to be
calm, but alert.
VOICE THROUGH INTERCOM
Go ahead - send her through.
A LOUD HUM and we start moving, sliding into a tunnel a
tubular CT SCAN - with a MIRROR on the top.
Now WE SEE OUR FACE REFLECTED: A FEMALE APE IN A GAS MASK.
Bright Eyes.
Will climbs into his truck. Alone, he allows his excitement
to show. Abstract thought!
He pulls away from the BIO LAB, which is tucked in a corner
of an old military base.
Will drives over the majestic Golden Gate Bridge.
Will pulls up in front of his house.
Set in a hillside neighborhood, it's neat, nondescript. The
home of a bachelor who hasn't given it much thought.
As Will pulls into the driveway, WE HEAR C SHARP PLAYED OVER
AND OVER ON A PIANO.
7.
Will - dressed in an ill-fitting suit off the rack, hair
brushed in an attempt at neatness - meets STEVEN JACOBS as he
steps from a beautiful BLACK JAGUAR.
JACOBS
You could at least try to look
excited.
0
10.
Will's too nervous to look excited. He eyes the FOUR SUITS
disembarking from nearby TOWN CARS.
WILL
I'm not good with this stuff.
Jacobs puts a hand on Will's back, leads him inside.
JACOBS
You'll do fine. Just speak
English. Keep the science simple.
Lucky BURSTS from the lab building and runs across the
grounds. He leaps over a car, then heads for the nearest
building.
Rain and fog. An AMBULANCE pulls out, past POLICE CRUISERS
and two CDC (CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL) VANS.
Will - face cut, clothing torn - finishes with a DETECTIVE
and walks through the chaotic aftermath. He watches Caroline
walk alongside a stretcher carrying Donnie, his shoulder
packed in ice.
He spots Jacobs, who looks wrecked. He hurries over to him.
WILL
Are they gone?
JACOBS
Long gone.
Will knows the answer, but has to ask anyway.
WILL
Did they say anything before they
left? I mean, about Phase 2.
JACOBS
Look around you, for Christ sakes.
We'll be lucky if we don't go to
jail.
Will's gutted - devastated.
WILL
But we're so close.
JACOBS
You think you're the only one who's
got something at stake here? I've
got my own skin in this game!
WILL
What happened had nothing to do
with the 112.
(desperate to clarify)
Take an already aggressive animal,
make it smarter - you're going to
get a potentially dangerous
SITUATION -
15.
JACOBS
What makes you so damned positive
about that?
(pauses for emphasis)
What if this drug does things you
don't understand? Are you going to
take responsibility for that?
Because I'm sure as hell not going
to.
Here Will hesitates.
JACOBS (CONT'D)
We're not ready for human trials.
Hell, we weren't ready for monkey
trials.
WILL
They're apes.
JACOBS
This is what we're going to do:
You're taking a sabbatical. I'll
let the board handle the lawsuit.
When this blows over I'll bring you
back and we'll start over - we'll
do it right this time. With mice.
Tiny mice that can't hurt anybody.
Will finds to his dismay that he's got nothing to say.
Will climbs into his truck and pauses. He reaches into a
jacket pocket and brings out a VIAL - IT'S THE VIAL of 112 HE
USED IN THE PRESENTATION - THE ONLY REMAINING ONE.
TAP AT THE WINDOW. Franklin's face appears.
Will shoves the VIAL back into his pocket, rolls down the
window.
 FRANKLIN
Show you something, boss?
16.
WILL
I don't work here anymore,
Franklin.
FRANKLIN
I just put down fifteen animals,
Dr. Rodman. The least you could do
is give me a moment of your time.
Will's shoulders sag with exhaustion. It's been a long,
devastating day.
WILL
of course.
Will pulls up in his truck.
Will's coat is pulled forward to shield the baby at his
chest. He barely has the key in the lock when Irena opens
the door.
IRENA
It's Friday night. I had a date.
WILL
I'm sorry - there was -
She doesn't wait to hear his excuse, just moves down the
walk, her footfalls pointed and angry.
He pauses there. Apparently no end to this bad day.
From up here, the chimp has a commanding view of the entire
neighborhood. A group of CHILDREN rides bikes. A MAN mows
his lawn.
There's a HONK below, and the chimp watches as a TAXI pulls
up to the HOUSE NEXT DOOR.
HUNSIKER - A MAN in an AIRLINE PILOT uniform - kisses his
WIFE and young DAUGHTER, ALICE, then climbs into the cab with
his carry-on suitcase.
Alice clutches a doll in her hand as she watches her daddy's
Taxi disappear around the corner... Then TODD, the big
brother, SWIPES THE DOLL FROM HER HAND and rides off on his
bike. His FRIENDS LAUGH.
The chimp watches, riveted, as the Alice BURSTS INTO OUTRAGED
TEARS and runs after them.
WILL (O.S.)
Caesar! Breakfast!
The chimp turns at Will's call. HIS NAME IS CAESAR.
VISITORS buy tickets at the entrance gates. Will pulls
around to an Employee Parking Lot.
The movement of a SWING. Caesar's strapped in it, and WE
NOTICE IMMEDIATELY THAT HE'S GROWN OLDER.
SUPER: TWO YEARS LATER
Caesar's features are more mature. He appears more like a
"little boy" - and his EYES HAVE TURNED A DEEP GREEN.
Back and forth Caesar goes, as high as he can manage.
At the height of his forward motion, he peers down into the
neighbor's yard where, for just an instant, HE CAN SEE TODD
PLAYING BALL WITH ALICE AND ANOTHER KID.
At the height of his backward motion he catches another
glimpse.
Caesar pumps his legs, eager to get a better look...
SQUEAK.SQUEAK of the SWING, the PIANO FAINT from out here.
Caesar studies the harness that's keeping him in the swing.
There's a clamp on either side and a clamp on the back. He
undoes the one on his right side. CLICK. Then the left
side. CLICK.
Caesar wriggles the harness around so that he can reach the
clamp on his back with his long chimpanzee arms.
Caesar stands at the edge of the yard, unsure what to do
next. All three kids - Todd, Alice and Todd's buddy - have
stopped playing to stare at him.
Caesar spots a BALL lying on the grass. He picks it up and
tosses it to Todd's Buddy. The Boy catches it, throws it
back to Caesar.
TODD'S BUDDY
Check it. He wants to play.
Thrilled at the contact, Caesar throws the ball to Todd. But
Todd has an idea, and the idea makes him smile.
Alice doesn't have a good feeling. She watches as her
brother throws the ball to his Buddy OVER CAESAR'S HEAD.
29.
TODD
Monkey in the middle.
Todd's Buddy LAUGHS. Caesar LAUGHS too, although he's not
sure what's funny.
Will and Walter walk down the street looking for Caesar.
WALTER
Caesar!
WILL
He won't go far.
WALTER
You don't know that.
WILL
I do, Dad.
Will and Walter search down the street. Then they hear it:
 HUNSIKER'S YELL. Will runs for the neighbor's house.
30.
Hunsiker approaches Caesar with a raised bat. The terrified
chimp backs toward his fence.
HUNSIKER
Hah! Hah -
Will JUMPS INTO THE YARD AND PUTS HIMSELF BETWEEN HUNSIKER
AND CAESAR. Caesar cowers behind him.
WILL
Hold on - it's okay - he's
harmless!
HUNSIKER
Your monkey came onto my property!
Threatened my kids!
By now Caesar has climbed into Will's arms, burying his head
in. his neck. Will backs toward the gate.
WILL
It won't happen again...
HUNSIKER
Damn right it won't happen again!
I'll press charges if it does!
Will holds Caesar close and hurries home.
From high above, WE PASS OVER the Golden Gate Bridge, the
link between the bustling city and a huge, green FOREST.
As Caesar scrambles out of the truck, WILL HOOKS A HARNESS
TO HIS COLLAR and helps Walter from the car.
The chimp looks around at the SOARING TREES. What is this
place? The three of them head into the forest, Caesar
tugging at the leash.
WALTER
Take him off the leash.
 WILL
There's a place up ahead.
32.
They've walked deep into the park. No people here. Will
kneels next to Caesar.
WILL
Don't go far. Stay where I can see
you.
Will takes OFF CAESAR'S HARNESS. The chimpanzee runs, begins
flying from tree to tree. Will watches, nervous. But it's
gratifying to see Caesar so happy.
The CHIMP DISAPPEARS around a corner. A moment passes, then
another. The men follow... and discover CAESAR STANDING IN A
GROVE OF TREES.
WILL (CONT'D)
(YELLING)
Remember - stay where I can see you
- if you got lost in these woods
I'd never find you.
BUT CAESAR BARELY HEARS HIM. HE'S UTTERLY CAPTIVATED. THE
SPOT IS BEAUTIFUL, WITH GREEN, LUSH BRANCHES JOINING TO FORM
A CANOPY OVERHEAD.
WALTER
Go ahead. Climb!
The men sit down on a log, watching as Caesar swings from the
branches. Free, elated. An animal in his element.
Caesar begins climbing a redwood. Our view of him is
obscured by the leaves. As his dark form ascends, Will and
Walter become smaller and smaller down below.
SUPER: THREE YEARS LATER
RUSTLING LEAVES whisper Caesar upward. He moves with an easy
grace, exhilarated by the freedom.
At the TOP of the giant redwood CAESAR EMERGES THROUGH THE
LEAVES - AND WE SEE THAT HE'S GROWN, FILLED OUT - THE CHIMP
EQUIVALENT OF A FULL-BLOWN TEENAGER.
HIS DISTINCTIVE LOOKS ARE MORE PRONOUNCED NOW: EYES A DEEP
GREEN, FEATURES SOMEWHAT LESS SIMIAN, PERHAPS MORE HUMAN...
Caesar looks across the bay to San Francisco, looks north at
the mountains. Then down to Will below.
Will's pointing to his watch.
33.
 CLOSE ON A HARNESS. Will has it waiting as Caesar lands
beside him on the forest floor.
Will attaches the harness and they walk together. Caesar's
much taller now - over five feet.
WILL
Sorry to rush you - got to get home
and check on Walter.
They approach a WOMAN with a LARGE DOG on a leash - a GREAT
DANE. The dog BARKS, lunging menacingly. The Woman
struggles to control him.
WOMAN
(INCREDULOUS)
Is that a chimpanzee?
WILL
Don't worry - he's harmless. Very
sweet.
The big dog keeps BARKING.
Annoyed, Caesar finally turns and gives him a LARGE,
CHIMPANZEE SNARL, BARING HIS TEETH.
The Great Dane immediately WHIMPERS - terrified - and pulls
the Woman away.
WILL (CONT'D)
Guess he had it coming.
Caesar watches as the Woman walks off with the dog, HIS GAZE
LINGERING ON THE LEASH.
THEN HIS EYES MOVE TO HIS OWN LEASH. Is he a pet too?
Will drives up, Caesar in tow. The ZOO'S BEING RENOVATED -
machinery everywhere.
Disoriented because of the construction, Will makes a wrong
turn as he leads Caesar to the car.
They find themselves in front of THE PRIMATE ENCLOSURE.
Caesar goes rigid, staring at a DOZEN CHIMPS in the branches
of the trees - behind bars. They stare back at him. One
CHIMP, a GRIZZLED OLD MALE, STEPS FORWARD - OMINOUS. HE
LOOKS AT CAESAR AS IF LOOKING INTO HIS SOUL.
Caesar's transfixed.
Will looks back and forth between the chimps and Caesar.
Neither makes a sound.
WILL
Come on.
As Will drags Caesar off, the apes in the enclosure climb
higher in the tree to watch. Suddenly they ALL BEGIN TO
SCREAM IN A DEAFENING CHATTER.
The Home Aide lights herself a cigarette, sits down on a deck
chair.
Walter pauses on the porch, blinking in the sun. The street
ahead of him is quiet. No one around.
Walter wanders down the front path. When he arrives at the
sidewalk he keeps on going, STEPPING OUT INTO THE STREET.
0
40.
He's immediately startled by a SUDDEN HONK, the SOUND of
SQUEALING BRAKES, and a car fishtailing out of control. The
car SMASHES into a nearby tree.
Walter backs up as Hunsiker approaches, still jabbing the
menacing finger.
HUNSIKER
Look at the front of my car you
stupid, stupid old man! You should
be locked up! Your son's going to
pay for that damage -
CAESAR EXPLODES OUT THE DOOR.
No time for anybody to react. The chimpanzee BODY SLAMS
HUNSIKER to the ground.
WALTER
Caesar...
Straddling Hunsiker, teeth bared, Caesar pounds him with his
fists.
HUNSIKER
Help! Get him off -
WALTER
Caesar... no... Stop!
Walter grabs Caesar by the shoulders, tries to pull him back.
But Caesar's too carried away by his rage - he shrugs the old
man off his back.
Then he grabs one of Hunsiker's hands and BITES OFF THE
"JABBING" POINTER FINGER.
41.
HUNSIKER
Aaaaaaaah!
Walter struggles to his feet and grabs Caesar again. A PULSE
OF HUNSIKER'S BLOOD STREAKS ACROSS HIS NECK.
WALTER
Caesar!
Caesar hesitates. Blood dripping down his chin, he looks
over his shoulder and meets Walter's eyes.
WALTER (CONT'D)
Please stop.
Hunsiker uses the distraction. He scrabbles to his feet and
sprints for his house.
CAESAR CATCHES A GLIMPSE. ANIMAL INSTINCT TAKES OVER - IT'S
TOO BIG TO FIGHT.
He races after Hunsiker. WALTER FALLS TO THE GROUND. HIS
HEAD HITS THE PAVEMENT, stunning him.
Just as Hunsiker's about to reach his front door, Caesar
flies from behind - his feet hitting the door - and lands to
block Hunsiker's entrance.
White with terror, Hunsiker - clutching his bleeding hand to
his chest - takes off running down the sidewalk.
Hunsiker runs for his life. He looks over his shoulder -
Caesar's galloping behind, in hot pursuit.
He tries to speed up - can't go any faster. Again he glances
over his shoulder - Caesar's closing in.
Breath coming hard, Hunsiker sprints, scrambles, desperate to
escape. He looks over his shoulder-but this time CAESAR
HAS DISAPPEARED. HE'S NOT ANYWHERE, UP OR DOWN THE STREET.
Unsure where to go, half-stumbling, Hunsiker keeps running.
Then, OUT OF NOWHERE, CAESAR SWINGS DOWN FROM A TREE. HE
LANDS SQUARELY IN FRONT OF HUNSIKER, BLOCKING HIS PATH.
Hunsiker backs up, changes direction, runs across the street.
0
42.
Enjoying the chase, taking his time, Caesar grabs a tree
branch and swings from tree to tree.
with one giant jump, he makes it to the top of a tree across
the street, tracking Hunsiker like prey.
Hunsiker's running out of steam. Caesar swings down in front
of him and KICKS him in the chest, sending him flying.
Calmly he stands over Hunsiker, who cowers.
HUNSIKER
Please no...
Caesar pounds his chest, YELLING in triumph.
But then he sees something across the street that abruptly
pulls him out of his euphoria: WALTER - STRUGGLING, BLOODY -
BEING HELPED TO HIS FEET.
He looks down at Hunsiker, cringing.
All at once CAESAR REALIZES WHAT HE'S DONE.
Will's car drives down a two-lane highway.
REPORTER (V.0.)
.chimpanzee named Caesar,
terrorizing the quiet family
enclave and mauling neighbor
Douglas Hunsiker, a pilot for
Global Airlines.
As Will pulls into the entrance, Caesar's glued to the
window.
As they climb from the car, MR. LANDON, 50's, emerges from
the office. DODGE, 20's, hangs back.
WILL
You must be Mr. Landon.
(SHAKING HANDS)
This is Caesar.
MR. LANDON
Nice to meet you, Caesar. This is
Dodge, helps me run the place.
WILL
I've been telling Caesar about the
animals you have here. How much
fun it is.
MR. LANDON
Yes, we have a big play center
where the chimpanzees like to
climb.
(TO CAESAR)
Want to see the play center?
Caesar nods. Absolutely.
A HUGE CAGED STRUCTURE, the size of a gymnasium. Inside are
climbing constructions, ropes, toys, and, in the middle, a
LARGE TREE, reaching up through the top bars.
A CAGED-IN BRIDGE leads to a row of DARK DENS. But for
now... it's empty. No apes in sight.
Caesar approaches with will and Mr. Landon.
MR. LANDON
What do you think, Caesar? Want to
give it a try?
Trying to mask his growing dread, Will removes Caesar's
harness.
45.
WILL
Go ahead.
He watches Caesar - unsuspecting - move through AN OPEN, GATE-
LIKE SLIDING DOOR.
Caesar scampers up the ledges and leaps to a bar. He swings
from bar to bar, then hits the ground and runs for the tree.
Will can barely watch AS DODGE ROLLS THE SLIDING DOOR CLOSED,
LOCKING IT.
He braces himself.
Caesar joyfully climbs the sprawling tree until he HITS THE
TOP OF THE CAGE. Branches continue through spaces in the
bars, but HE'S REACHED...
A DEAD END.
CAESAR TURNS, FINDS WILL'BELOW. What he reads in Will's eyes
gives him a sudden, sharp sense of dread.
HE LOOKS TO THE CAGE ENTRANCE, SEES THAT THE GATE IS LOCKED.
HE'S LOCKED IN. TRAPPED.
Caesar SHRIEKS, speeds down the tree.
Other SHRIEKS join in. EXCITED APE NOISES - coming from
UNSEEN, CAGED APES - fills the atrium.
The STRANGE ANIMAL VOICES FUEL CAESAR'S PANIC. He runs to
the gate, tries to shake it open.
WILL
It's okay, Caesar. It's going to
be okay...
The words are for him as much as Caesar.
WILL (CONT'D)
You're going to live here for a
while. This is what the Judge says
we have to do.
0
46.
WHAT? Caesar can't believe what he's hearing! He
frantically signs, desperate, pleading.
The SHRIEKS of the UNSEEN APES continue, feeding Will's
apprehension. Caesar doesn't belong here. It takes every
bit of restraint he has not to take Caesar out, to run...
WILL (CONT'D)
They'll take good care of you here.
DODGE
That's about it for visiting hours.
Will shoots him a look of daggers.
MR. LANDON
What Dodge means is, in our
experience, longer you drag out the
leave-taking, harder it is. On
both of you.
Caesar WHIMPERS, tries to bend the bars apart. When this
doesn't work, he tries prying them open with his teeth.
WILL
I'm sorry to trick you this way,
but you would never have agreed. I
was afraid they'd hurt you if they
forced you -
MR. LANDON
He'll be fine.
Will gives Caesar a last, long look. The pain in his eyes is
matched only by Caesar's.
WE STAY WITH CAESAR as Will forces himself to walk away.
Caesar's SHRIEKS build. The SURROUNDING APES chime in...a
CACOPHONY OF PRIMAL ENERGY.
CAESAR HURTLES HIS BODY AGAINST THE CAGE.
DODGE
Caesar. Hey. I can get you out.
Dodge stands at the end of the atrium, BECKONING.
DODGE (CONT'D)
This way.
47.
Caesar follows Dodge to the far end of the play area, then
through the CAGED-IN BRIDGE. Will's almost out of sight.
Caesar can see that he's nearly reached the car.
He GRUNTS with stress as he follows the bridge into...
.and finds the Will's car, driving down the winding road,
away from the Ranch.
Walter's frail hand runs along the cold rail of Caesar's
swing set. Empty. Useless in the back yard.
The Aide stands nearby, sending a text message.
Caesar walks across the bridge. To his left, (connecting to
the bridge) he sees TWO MORE APE HOUSES CONNECTING TO THE
BRIDGE:
THE ORANGUTAN HOUSE - which is empty.
And THE GORILLA HOUSE, which houses only one lone gorilla,
BUCK, who stares out at Caesar. Caesar registers THE FACT
THAT BUCK'S NOT OUT WITH THE OTHER APES. Then he moves on
toward the atrium.
The APES are visible inside. CAESAR GETS HIS FIRST GOOD LOOK.
Over two dozen CHIMPANZEES and three ORANGUTANS roam around
the atrium. The groups don't mix - chimps hang with chimps,
orangutans with orangutans.
They haven't noticed him yet.
Caesar enters, heads for the tree. One by one, the apes take
notice. They STOP AND STARE at this new arrival - DRESSED
LIKE A HUMAN.
HE'S ONE OF THEM, BUT LOOKS VERY SUBTLY DIFFERENT. GREEN
EYES, FACE CONTOURED WITH SLIGHTLY HUMAN FEATURES, POSTURE
MORE UPRIGHT...
Caesar looks around, finds THIRTY PAIRS OF APE EYES ON HIM.
Should he continue to the tree? Go back to the cage?
54.
He spots a BALL across the way. Moves to it - the eyes
follow him. He picks it up. The eyes wait.
Caesar rolls the ball to a nearby chimp. It receives the
ball, gives Caesar nothing - no smile, no connection - then
tosses it to Rocket.
Eyes on Caesar, Rocket discards the ball like a piece of
trash. His look is insolent, an unmistakable challenge.
AFRAID, CAESAR TURNS, HEADS BACK TOWARD HIS CAGE. ROCKET
SWINGS OVER A COUPLE OF BARS AND LANDS IN FRONT OF HIM.
Caesar tries to walk around. Rocket blocks his path, reaches
out and pulls at Caesar's sleeve, as if to examine the
material. Caesar jerks his arm away.
Rocket bares his teeth, raises his arms.
Caesar considers the options - should he run? Before he can
make a move, Rocket GRUNTS, grabs his shirt at the chest.
Caesar tries to push Rocket away, but the larger chimp throws
Caesar to the ground, pinning him.
Caesar struggles to get away, accidentally SLAPPING Rocket
across the face.
OUTRAGED, Rocket SLAMS his hand on Caesar's chest and starts
POUNDING him. Caesar tries to block the blows, but they're
coming hard and fast: his head, his stomach, his chest.
Apes SHRIEK, jump up and down, egging Rocket on.
Caesar manages to break loose, crawling away. Rocket grabs
at his shirt, drags Caesar closer.
He opens his mouth wide, moving sharp teeth toward Caesar's
face. Caesar struggles, barely holds him off - and...
.ROCKET BITES HIS ARM. BLOOD SPURTS.
BAM! A SHOT RINGS OUT. Chimps scatter.
Stunned, Rocket spins around - HIS MOUTH FULL OF CAESAR'S
BLOOD - AND SEES DODGE OUTSIDE THE CAGE, RIFLE IN HAND. He
pulls a TRANQUILIZING DART from his shoulder.
Caesar starts to move off -
BAM! DODGE SHOOTS A TRANQUILIZER DART INTO THE SIDE OF
CAESAR'S NECK - HE GRABS AT THIS THROAT AND FALLS.
BAM! DODGE SHOOTS ROCKET AGAIN.
55.
Caesar rolls over to look up... as Rocket topples onto him.
Out cold.
Dodge pulls heavy bags of Primate Chow from a truck, stacking
them in a SHED. He spots Stewart striding towards him, and--
Ducks out of sight, vainly brushing back his hair.
STEWART (O.S.)
What were you thinking?
DODGE
oh, hey Doc.
STEWART
That chimp needs protection.
Dodge's face falls.
STEWART (CONT'D)
You could've gotten him killed.
DODGE
(A LIE)
I told Rodney not to open his cage.
STEWART
Can't you see how sensitive he is?
How intelligent?
DODGE
Yeah, no, he's a real smart
dresser.
STEWART
I want him moved to the orangutan
house. He'll be safe there until
we re-introduce him to the group.
DODGE
I'm sorry, since when do volunteer
animal doctors make the rules
around here?
57.
STEWART
Please. Just do it.
DODGE
Whatever you say, doc.
Dodge returns to stacking the chow.
DODGE (CONT'D)
You're the one with the college
education.
A large truck backs onto a loading dock. Will watches as a
NEW GROUP OF CHIMPANZEES are unloaded from the truck and
brought into the lab.
Will opens the door to FIND STEWART STANDING THERE. For a
moment he's too shocked to say anything.
STEWART
Sorry to drop in on you like this.
The clinic at the zoo gave me your
address but they didn't have a
phone number -
WILL
(RECOVERING)
Don't worry about it. You want to
come in?
Nighttime.
Will waits at a picnic table as Dodge approaches with Caesar
on a leash. He's immediately struck by Caesar's injured
appearance, but he plasters a smile on his face. Caesar's
clearly thrilled to see him.
WILL
There you are! I heard what
happened.
CAESAR
(SIGNING)
Home now. Caesar home.
He tugs Will away from Dodge.
WILL
I'm going to get you out of here,
but not today. I'm working on it.
Caesar's face falls.
WILL (CONT'D)
Soon. I promise.
Will notices Dodge's ELECTRIC CATTLE PROD.
CAESAR
(SIGNING)
Home.
Still a question, a flicker of hope.
WILL
(kills him to say it)
Not yet. I can't yet.
Caesar realizes: Will's going to leave him here.
First incredulous - then outraged - Caesar turns away and
starts walking back to his cage.
WILL (CONT'D)
Wait a second - Caesar, where are
you going?
 Caesar doesn't respond, doesn't turn, just keeps walking.
Dodge catches up with him.
62.
DODGE
(loud enough for Will)
No place like home, huh monkey boy?
WILL
Caesar - come back here!
He watches Caesar's retreating back, Dodge trotting alongside
him. Realizes Caesar's nearly breaking into a run.
Dodge locks Caesar in his cell. Then moves around to the...
.storage shed. He notices Will's car still parked in front
of the office... just as -
BAM! WILL DECKS HIM WITH A FIST TO THE FACE. Dodge hits the
ground. Will stands over him, too livid to realize he
might've just broken his hand.
WILL
You son of a bitch.
Dodge scrabbles to his feet, wipes the blood from his nose.
DODGE
That was not a smart thing to do.
Dodge is clearly much tougher, stronger than Will, but Will's
too angry to care.
WILL
If I find out Caesar's been hurt,
if he's mistreated in any way, I
swear I'll have you brought up on
charges.
Dodge looks towards Landon's house, restrains himself.
DODGE
That wild-eyed chimp isn't yours
any more. He's mine now.
The truth of the statement is worse than any punch.
DODGE (CONT'D)
And you're on private property.
Now get the hell out of here.
63.
WILL
Forget jail. I'll come back and
kill you.
A bag of CHIPS AHOY COOKIES. Caesar - looking morose -
watches as Rodney pops a cookie in his mouth and stuffs the
bag into the shed...
STEWART (O.S.)
Morning Caesar.
Caesar walks across the bridge. He passes the entrance to
the chimpanzee house - and keeps going.
67.
He arrives at the Gorilla House.
Buck's visible in his cage, asleep on a bed of straw. Caesar
unlocks the door latch and opens the cage door.
He waits, but Buck doesn't budge. He's still fast asleep.
Caesar hesitates. Then he slowly...
.across the bridge...
.and into the atrium. Caesar follows.
The full moon shines down on Buck, the tree, the climbing
structure.
The gorilla feels his feet on the grass, savoring every step.
Then he begins to run. He runs as fast as he can, all the
way across the atrium, then all the way back.
Back and forth, GORILLA WIND SPRINTS of freedom.
Caesar stands back, silently watching.
A morning like any other. Dodge goes through his routine:
0 opening the door, wheeling out a wheelbarrow.
68.
He makes his way to the ape houses.
Dodge and his wheelbarrow approach the Gorilla House. Closer
and closer to the cage... until they're right in front.
The CAGE DOOR'S CLOSED, BUCK INSIDE. Dodge shovels primate
chow into the gorilla's trough.
BUCK TAKES A HANDFUL AND LOOKS ACROSS TO CAESAR, WHO RETURNS
HIS GAZE FROM THE ORANGUTAN HOUSE.
A car pulls up to the gate. Evans is driving. He looks ill.
GUARD
(OPENING GATE)
Early day today, Evans?
EVANS
Actually I'm not feeling too good.
EVANS GETS A SHIVER.
GUARD
You know what: Whiskey, lemon,
honey and a cup of hot water.
Never fails.
EVANS
Thanks - I'm on it.
Evans drives off.
Stewart sits atop one of the ranch horses, looking down at
the chimpanzee area.
She watches CAESAR walking across the bridge. Caesar moves
easily among the apes, his Alpha Male status clear as the
others make way for him.
Stewart's relieved - and a little surprised - to see Caesar
so at ease with the other apes.
Caesar sits high in the tree, looking down at the apes.
Rocket's part of the group again, but no longer the Alpha.
Caesar's got his eye on CORNELIA, a FEMALE APE, standing with
a group of females. He follows her movements with his
eyes...
Maurice climbs up next to Caesar.
MAURICE
Why cookie Rocket?
CAESAR
Need strong. All apes strong.
MAURICE
No understand.
Caesar grabs a small twig off the tree and BREAKS IT.
CAESAR
Gorilla.
He breaks another twig.
CAESAR (CONT'D)
Orangutan.
He breaks another.
CAESAR (CONT'D)
Chimpanzee.
He grabs a bunch of twigs and holds them together - now they
can't be broken.
CAESAR (CONT'D)
Apes.
Establishing shot. A beautiful morning.
LONG SHOT of Will sitting at a gravesite service, surrounded
by twenty-odd PEOPLE. WE RECOGNIZE Stewart, Jacobs, one of
the Aides.
Will waits at the picnic table. He's been there a while.
Finally Rodney appears.
RODNEY
Sorry - can't get him to come out.
He won't budge.
WILL
He knows I'm here?
RODNEY
I told him.
Will brushes by Rodney, heads for the cages.
RODNEY (CONT'D)
Hey - you are not allowed back
THERE -
Will ignores him, keeps going.
Caesar sees Will coming. He turns his back, heads to a
common area away from the bars.
Will runs up to the cage.
WILL
Caesar - please! I've got
something to tell you -
(BEAT)
It's about Walter.

76.
WE FIND CAESAR deep out of sight in the orangutan cage. He' s
heard Will's words.
Will waits. Caesar's not coming out.
NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
NASA has temporarily lost
communication with the Icarus.
Deep night at the ranch. A moon half-hidden by clouds.
Caesar slips out of the orangutan house, heads toward the
GATE.
As he passes the chimpanzee house HE HEARS A CHIMPANZEE CALL
OUT. He turns. Finds Rocket staring out at him, wanting to
go with him.
Caesar hesitates. Rocket CALLS OUT LOUDER.
To quiet him, Caesar walks over to Rocket's cage, but as he
gets closer, he sees something that gives him pause: ROCKET'S
EYES HAVE CHANGED.
Caesar gets right up against the bars of Rocket's cage, takes
Rocket's face in his hands and looks into his eyes: THEY ARE
UNMISTAKABLY GREEN.
Reeling, Caesar tries to make sense of this. And then he
remembers the bite. Rocket bit him. He looks down at the
wound on his arm, now nearly healed.
Has Caesar's blood changed Rocket?
Caesar opens Rocket's'cage. The chimp emerges, ready for
anything.
Caesar and Rocket barrel across the ranch, past the living
 quarters, past the barn, onto the winding road leading away.
78.
Middle of the night, only a few cars.
Caesar and Rocket stick to bushes and shadows. They wait for
a break in traffic, cross the highway.
In the distance the LIGHTS of the TOWN give a glow to the
night sky. Caesar and Rocket gallop toward it.
Dark, quiet. RUSTLING IN THE TREES, as if a storm is coming.
SUDDENLY CAESAR BURSTS THROUGH, SWINGING FOR THE NEXT TREE
A moment later ROCKET FOLLOWS.
Swinging from tree to tree, they make their way down the
suburban street.
Feet pounding the pavement, Caesar and Rocket head away from
Will's house.
GEN-SYS RESEARCH SIGN. The grounds are deserted. A SECURITY
GUARD listens to RADIO in the guard kiosk.
Caesar and Rocket - eyes on the Security Guard - stop at a
spot hidden by a tree and scale the fence.
Caesar and Rocket drop down to the grass. They SNIFF THE
AIR, head toward the Primate House.
Caesar and Rocket arrive at the Primate House. Caesar tries
the big double door - locked. He looks upward, spies a ROW
OF AWNING WINDOWS near the roof.
Rocket pushes a dumpster close to the building wall.
Then Caesar jumps on the dumpster and catapults himself to
the window's ledge. Hanging by one arm, he swings himself in
through the window.
Rocket follows.
0
80.
Caesar and Rocket head for the fence. A GUARD approaches on
his nightly rounds.
They look at each other, lay low.
To protect Caesar, Rocket takes off running. The SHOCKED
SECURITY GUARD SEES HIM, GIVES CHASE, FUMBLES FOR HIS WALKIE-
TALKIE.
But Rocket's too fast - in a moment he's out of sight.
Caesar's waiting when Rocket runs up. They take off
together.
Dawn of a new day.
Will speeds out of the driveway, Stewart by his side. She's
dialing her cell phone.
The two CHIMPANZEES drag Mr. Landon toward the Ape Houses.
Rocket follows, munching cereal from a box of Cheerios.
IN THE DISTANCE
Rodney's visible, being dragged, SCREAMING.
Will's car speeds up to the gate and stops.
STEWART
(ON PHONE)
No one's answering.
In the distance they can HEAR the PHONE RINGING at the ranch
house. From where the car is, nothing out of the ordinary is
visible.
Will thinks a moment, gets out of the car.
WILL
You go get help.
STEWART
Not a way in the world. I'm coming
with you.
They sneak into the back of the ranch house. All is quiet.
Caesar climbs onto the open tailgate of a pick-up truck.
 Apes gather around, expectant.
92.
CAESAR
(VOICE STRAINING)
No.
At the sound of Caesar's voice, the apes rise tall.
FROM THE CHIMPANZEE HOUSE Will and Stewart watch, stunned.
CAESAR (CONT'D)
C...Cage!
The humans' jaws drop, petrified.
CAESAR (CONT'D)
NO CAGE! NO MORE'.
CAESAR FIERCELY POUNDS HIS CHEST. EXACTLY LIKE ALPHA.
THE APES SHRIEK TO HEAVEN.
BEAT OF JUNGLE DRUMS as CAESAR BOLTS FROM THE TRUCK BED.
APES RACE TO FOLLOW HIM OFF THE RANCH.
Will - and the other humans - are blown away.
The pack of apes, led by Caesar, emerges from the ranch gate
and moves out over the countryside.
ANIMAL CONTROL, AMBULANCE, POLICE VEHICLES stream onto the
ranch.
VOICE
They could be spread out all over
the County by now.
Will and Stewart - released from the cages - speak to OFFICER
HUFFS. Dodge, Rodney, and Landon huddle nearby.
WILL
No - they'll stick together.
DODGE
(INTERRUPTING)
They're following one ape. You
kill him, you stop them all.
HUFFS
There's a leader?
93.
DODGE
(POINTING)
Ask him - he raised him.
All eyes to Will.
WILL
His name is Caesar. If I can
reason with him, I know I can put
an end to this.
HUFFS
Reason with him?
Huffs thinks he's nuts. He turns, starts toward his squad
car. Will follows, Stewart on his heel.
WILL
You don't understand - this chimp
is smart - he'll listen to me
HUFF
(to nearby JUNIOR OFFICER)
Get on the horn with every agency
you can think of! We've got to
track down these monkeys before
they do major damage!
The Junior Officer - GRANGER - heads for his car. Dodge
follows.
DODGE
You need me riding with you. I've
got experience with these animals.
(eye on Will)
I can point out the one you want.
An AMBULANCE pulling away. Two POLICE CARS out front.
Jacobs stands talking with a couple of POLICE OFFICERS.
OFFICER
(handing Jacobs a card)
If you think of anything else, this
is where I can be reached -
A RUMBLING SOUND from behind.
They turn to see a RANCH APE ARMY heading their way.
Shocked, they leap out of the way as best they can.

The apes STAMPEDE past them and SWARM INTO THE LAB.
94.
A stunned officer gets to his squad car walkie-talkie.
OFFICER
We have a situation at Gen-Sys
Laboratory! Approximately two
dozen apes, gorillas, I don't know
what the hell they are -
AUDIBLE CHAOS from inside the lab. YELLING, SCREAMING,
DESTRUCTION.
Jacobs, a Security Guard and the two Officers are huddled
behind a squad car. Other Employees are hiding and watching
from the safety of the parking lot. They suddenly realize
that everything has GONE SILENT.
A moment later, LAB DOORS FLY OPEN.
OFFICER #1
Here they come!
A MASS OF PRIMATES BARREL TOWARD THEM.
OFFICER #2
There's more of them!
JACOBS
(REALIZING)
Those are my chimps...
They duck as the apes run by - some of them right up and over
the car they're crouched behind.
BAM! BAM! BAM! as the chimp's hit and leapfrog over the squad
car - and their heads.
The apes stampede across the parking lot, where several use
Jacobs' BLACK JAGUAR to VAULT OVER THE FENCE.
The last is BUCK, whose weight CRUSHES the car.
And then they're gone. Every last one of them.
Quiet now, except for CAR ALARMS.
Four HELICOPTERS wait. Hoff s, Will and Stewart climb into
one of them.
A hillside park overlooking San Francisco bay. THICK FOG
moving in.
KIDS EVERYWHERE - slides, seesaws, climbing structures.
A LITTLE GIRL plays in a sandbox. Her MOTHER reads on a
bench nearby. The Girl looks up, claps her hands.
GIRL
Monkey!
OVER HER SHOULDER WE SEE A CHIMPANZEE HEADING OUR WAY. Then
another. And another.
REVEAL THREE DOZEN APES EMERGING FROM THE FOG, MAKING THEIR
WAY DOWN THE SLOPE.
suddenly the Little Girl's not so sure.
PEOPLE START TO NOTICE - GRAB THEIR KIDS.
The Mother looks up from her book. SOMEONE SCREAMS.
97.
GIRL (CONT'D)
Mommy?
The Girl's surrounded now by moving apes --- the Mother can't
get to her.
MOTHER
April!
Suddenly Caesar doubles back from the lead. He scoops her up
and puts her down out of harm's way.
Then he continues herding the apes forward. He knows where
he's going.
SIRENS APPROACH. Squad cars give chase.
A SIGN: THE SAN FRANCISCO ZOO.
FAMILIES. Hot dog stands and ice cream vendors.
The fun is interrupted by the SOUND OF HELICOPTERS sweeping
low overhead. Faces turn skyward...
98.
A moment later, Caesar and his apes RUMBLE IN. Chaos.
PEOPLE scatter. SCREAM.
Released balloons float lazily upward.
As the apes pass other enclosures, the ANIMALS GO NUTS.
Lions ROAR. Giraffes run back and forth.
All kinds of apes - Chimps, Orangutans, Gorillas - rush from
their separate enclosures.
Caesar's apes are waiting for them.
Caesar makes eye contact with the GRIZZLED OLD MALE
CHIMPANZEE. Then - as a unit - they all run for the exit.
99.
By now, ALL THE ANIMALS ARE GOING CRAZY.
Above, the sky is full of helicopters now -- some Police, some
News Crews.
Jacobs watches a TOW TRUCK pull away with his ruined black
Jaguar in tow.
He climbs into a waiting taxi. He looks like hell.
Apes leap over cars, run in and out of traffic. PEDESTRIANS
take cover.
SNIPER FIRE RINGS OUT from helicopters above - an APE FALLS.
Caesar's leading, running alongside Cornelia. She falters.
Caesar slows with her, concerned.
SHE LOOKS ILL. But Cornelia digs deep and picks up her
speed.
Caesar continues on.
Cars speed across the bridge in both directions. HIGHWAY
PATROLMEN rush to block the entrances.
FOG.
101.
The apes arrive at the shadow of the great bridge - a
stampeding phalanx with Caesar at the lead.
But Cornelia can't keep up any more. Losing her balance, she
stumbles, falls.
Caesar rushes to Cornelia's side. By the time he reaches
her, she's dead - a WHITE FOAM has formed at her lips.
She's been poisoned.
CUT TO:
FLASHBACK of Cornelia, sniffing the cookie. Will yelling
"Don't"...
CUT TO:
Caesar - devastated, the rage building in his face.
He looks up as one of the HELICOPTERS BUZZES LOW - HE SEES
WILL. THEY MAKE EYE CONTACT.
Caesar struggles to his feet with Cornelia in his arms - he's
going to carry her across the bridge.
Other helicopters BUZZ low, SHOTS RING OUT, SIRENS CLOSE IN.
Apes take cover around trees and structures, but they're
getting PICKED OFF.
Maurice takes Cornelia from Caesar's arms as Buck and Rocket
urge him forward.
Koba hangs back, watching, fascinated, as Maurice lays
Cornelia's body on the grass.
Two CHP PATROL CARS are frantically stopping new traffic from
entering the bridge and waving exiting traffic through.
102.
Suddenly, OUT OF THE FOG, THE APES APPEAR.
TRAFFIC slams to a halt.
PEOPLE are STUNNED as chimps, gorillas, orangutans VAULT OVER
THEIR CARS, run down the middle of the traffic - stampeding
across the bridge.
Helicopters BUZZ around like flies - SHARPSHOOTERS unable to
get a safe shot.
AT THE NORTH END OF THE BRIDGE
Blocked off by CHP, all traffic stopped.
A few helicopters touch down - SHARPSHOOTERS jump out, rifles
ready, and follow on foot behind SQUAD CARS, FOUR ACROSS,
THAT SLOWLY DRIVE ACROSS THE BRIDGE - TOWARD THE APES.
DODGE IS AMONG THEM.
AT THE SOUTH END OF THE BRIDGE
Caesar and his apes race forward.
POLICE REINFORCEMENTS and EMERGENCY VEHICLES arrive.
HELICOPTERS above.
Will's helicopter has set down. He and Stewart stand near an
ASSEMBLING ARMY -- an amalgamation of 'human special forces.'
Huffs and a small GROUP OF OFFICERS debate nearby.
OFFICER #1
We can't gas the forest! The
slightest wind would take it over
to Tiburon.
OFFICER #2
Well it'll take us months to find
them in there.
OFFICER #3
Not to mention rounding them all
up.
Will approaches the group.
WILL
I know where they are.
The Officers look at him. Who the hell is this guy?
Huffs - embarrassed - gestures toward Will.
HUFFS
This man owns one of the chimps.
(BEAT)
The so-called "leader". Says he
can reason him out.
107.
WILL
His name is Caesar. I think he'll
listen to me. If he comes out, the
other apes will follow.
Sounds pretty far-fetched.
OFFICER #1
You think you know where to find
this monkey?
Will starts to correct him - lets it go.
WILL
I do. I used to bring him here.
The Officers look at each other.
OFFICER #1
We don't have a lot of options.
Let's give it a try.
WILL
But you have to promise me - if I
can get them out, you'll take them
peacefully. Tranquilize them, cage
them. No killing.
Beat.
HUFFS
Whatever it takes.
Will and Stewart stand at the edge of the woods. They're at
the path Caesar and Will used to take.
She's terrified, trying to mask it.
WILL
You think this is a bad idea?
STEWART
Definitely.
He thought so.
STEWART (CONT'D)
He's never going to agree to come
out with you.
108.
WILL
I know. Got to try, right? I owe
him that much.
Will kisses her. Heads off down the path. Then he pauses,
turns to look at her.
WILL (CONT'D)
(YELLING BACK)
Think he'll forgive me?
STEWART
(can't quite hear him)
What?
Will waves it off - never mind.
Stewart watches him walk down the trail... and disappear into
the woods.
Will walks. FLASH OF BLACK up ahead. His pulse quickens -
he follows it.
CRACKLING of BRANCHES.
More BLACK, swinging through the trees. Is it Caesar?
Will follows.
Will enters the clearing.
He knows this place. Up ahead is the GROVE OF TREES with the
CANOPY that Caesar always loved.
Huffs stands looking at his watch. He looks up, turns to an
ASSEMBLED GROUP OF ARMED MEN.
HUFFS
Follow me.
Stewart double-takes, sees the ARMY HEAD OFF IN WILL'S
DIRECTION, GUNS READY.
STEWART
Hang on a second...
(to nearest Officer)
Where are they going?
109.
Looks are exchanged. Someone grabs Stewart, who struggles
with all her might.
STEWART (CONT'D)
WHERE ARE THEY GOING?!
Quiet here. Will heads toward the Grove of Trees.
WILL
Caesar! ...
He keeps walking, almost there. A DARK FIGURE DROPS DOWN IN
FRONT OF HIM.
IT'S KOBA.
Will takes a step back, fear crawling up the back of his
neck.
WILL (CONT'D)
You.
Koba stands up tall. Eyes Will.
He takes his time - like he's enjoying every second of
this... He walks towards will, bares his teeth.
Suddenly CAESAR APPEARS, SLAMMING INTO KOBA, knocking him
away.
ENRAGED, KOBA STARTS TO CHALLENGE CAESAR... BUT CAESAR JUST
STARES HIM DOWN.
KOBA - THE COWARD - SLINKS OFF, DISAPPEARING INTO THE WOODS.
Which leaves just Will and Caesar.
CAESAR
Humans coming.
WILL
No. I'm alone.
Will pauses - there's so much he wants to say.
WILL (CONT'D)
I owe you an apology.
CAESAR
Will want Caesar dead.
110.
WILL
I thought you had killed a man.
But I should have known better.
Caesar's face is unreadable. Will can't tell what he's
thinking.
WILL (CONT'D)
I want you to know that all of this
is my fault. My responsibility.
(BEAT)
Can you forgive me?
BIRDS TAKE SUDDEN FLIGHT. Caesar's eyes shift to the path.
Will realizes he's been betrayed.
WILL (CONT'D)
(PANICKED)
Wait - no -
CAESAR
Will leave.
WILL
I won't -
CAESAR
Will leave now.
WILL
No. I'm staying with you.
Caesar pushes him. Will staggers backwards, falls down.
At that moment, HUFFS and his ARMY step into the clearing.
Huffs takes aim at Caesar.
WILL (CONT'D)
NO!
HE RUSHES CAESAR JUST AS HUFFS PULLS THE TRIGGER. THE BLAST
OF THE GUN SHATTERS THE FOREST'S SILENCE.
AT THAT SAME MOMENT APES DROP FROM THE TREES -- IT'S AN AMBUSH
- a COUNTERATTACK.
Huffs and his men are taken by surprise. SHOTS are fired,
but not fast enough.
UNLIKE ALPHA'S BATTLE IN THE AFRICA, IT'S A SLAUGHTER IN THE
APES' FAVOR.
AS THE APES MAUL THE MEN, CAESAR CARRIES WILL THROUGH THE
CARNAGE.
Caesar lays Will out on the forest floor. There's a lot of
blood.
Will tries to speak. He looks up at Caesar.
Caesar takes him in his arms, cradles him with love.
Will looks into Caesar's green eyes. He relaxes. Lets go.
Then the life passes out of him.
Stewart sits in the back of a locked Police Car, looking out
at the forest in the gathering darkness.
All is quiet.
The forest is vast, dark, green. Impenetrable.
HONK OF A HORN.
Hunsiker - Will's neighbor - exits his house with a small
rolling suitcase. He's wearing his pilot's uniform.
The airplane takes off into the sky.
NEWSCASTER VOICE #1 (O.S.)
As the ape search continues, a
virulent flu strain has exploded in
and around San Francisco, sending
shock waves and panic throughout
the community.
We move along the ground of a clearing toward a lush canopy
of trees. As we get closer, we notice flashes of movement.
NEWSCASTER VOICE #2
Authorities suspect the origin of
the deadly virus might be Gen-Sys
Laboratories - the same private
company from which several
laboratory chimpanzees escaped
earlier this week -
We're still fifty yards away from the trees, but we can see
it's filled with apes - chimpanzees, orangutans, gorillas.
We keep pushing in, closer and closer to the trees. As we
move past the leaves WE FIND BUCK. MAURICE. AND, SITTING
APART FROM THE OTHERS... KOBA.
All of them have eyes in varying shades of GREEN.
113.
NEWSCASTER VOICE #3
As the death toll rapidly rises,
Hospitals are desperately trying to
meet the growing demand...
Caesar sits alone, staring straight at us.
NEWSCASTER VOICE #4
(INCREASINGLY DESPERATE)
Although isolated in the western
region of the country, the numbers
are catastrophic and quickly
rising...
Push in on CAESAR'S FACE.
NEWSCASTER VOICE #5
Efforts to quarantine appear to
have failed. The strain has been
spotted as far away as Singapore
and Australia...
CLOSER AND CLOSER ON CAESAR'S FACE.
NEWSCASTER VOICE #6
(RAGGED)
Casualties have reached apocalyptic
levels. Authorities urge you to
stay inside your homes...
(LONG BEAT)
For those of you who can hear me, I
say...
(VOICE BREAKING)
God's speed and so long to you all.
The NEWSCASTER'S VOICE is replaced by the WHITE NOISE OF A
SNOWY TELEVISION SET.
CAESAR'S EYES FILL THE SCREEN.
