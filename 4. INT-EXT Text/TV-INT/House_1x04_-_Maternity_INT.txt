      ETHAN and KAREN HARTIG (30s, high-powered) hold their NEWBORN
      DAUGHTER.  They're exhausted, but also exhilarated, blissful. 
      Almost punchy.  Mid-conversation:

                                      ETHAN HARTIG
                    Amber?

                                      KAREN HARTIG
                    No.

                                      ETHAN HARTIG
                    Why not?

                                      KAREN HARTIG
                    It's a stripper name.

                                      ETHAN HARTIG
                    Find me one stripper named Amber
                    Hartig. 
                          (off her look)
                    Or not.  Okay.  Non-stripper name...
                    Uh... Desiree?  Bambi?  Kandy Kane?  

                                      KAREN HARTIG
                    Max.  Maxine.  Max Hartig, that's a
                    cute name.

                                      ETHAN HARTIG
                    If you're a professional boxer, maybe.

      Karen holds their hospital-supplied teddy bear in front of
      the swaddled baby, trying to catch her eye.  But their
      daughter's drifting off to sleep.  They stare in wonder. 

                                      KAREN HARTIG
                    We made this little creature. 

                                      ETHAN HARTIG
                    It's incredible.

                                      KAREN HARTIG
                    The most crazily amazing thing we've
                    ever done.

                                      ETHAN HARTIG
                    I almost ran the marathon last year.

                          (to the baby)
                    If you're lucky, you won't inherit
                    Daddy's sense of humor.

      He takes the teddy bear, waves it in front of the baby.

                                      ETHAN HARTIG
                    Say hi to bear...

      The baby spits up right onto the bear.  Oops.  That didn't
      work.  Karen's worried--

                                      KAREN HARTIG
                    She's not even eating anything, how
                    can she be spitting up?

                                      ETHAN HARTIG
                    We can't bug them again.

      Karen looks at her husband, pleading...

                                      ETHAN HARTIG (CONT'D)
                    ...Okay.


      Ethan walks with their OB/GYN, DR. LIM (in scrubs, 40s,a
      hotshot).  He's slightly annoyed to be dragged into this.

                                      ETHAN HARTIG
                    I'm sorry, it's our first kid, we're
                    both a little panicky, I guess.

                                    LIM
                    You gotta ask the pediatrician next
                    time.  I just deliver 'em.

      They pass into--


      They enter, cross to the mother and child.

                                    LIM
                    She's spitting up?

                                      KAREN HARTIG
                    Second time in an hour...

                                    LIM
                    You lived underwater for nine months,
                    you'd have a lot to spit up, too.

      Dr. Lim picks the baby up, her arm hangs loosely.  He touches
      her cheek.  The baby doesn't move.  No rooting instinct. 
      Lim frowns.

                                      KAREN HARTIG
                    Something wrong?

                    Little lethargic...
                          (feeling her forehead)
                    She's hot.

                                      ETHAN HARTIG
                          (getting worried)
                    We didn't think... Is she--

      The baby's head trembles.  She's having convulsions.

                                      KAREN HARTIG
                    What's happening?

      Lim, still holding the baby, punches a button on the wall. 
      A beeping alarm goes off.  A light just outside the maternity
      room door starts flashing on and off.  Lim calls out into
      the hallway--

                                    LIM
                    Need some help here!*

      Lim quickly lays the child down in her bassinet and starts
      removing her swaddling...

                                      ETHAN HARTIG
                          (panicking)
                    What's wrong with her?

      Lim's too busy checking the girl with his stethoscope to
      answer.  Off the terrified Hartig parents, experiencing their
      worst nightmare, we:

                                          ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      A good-looking DOCTOR in a pristine lab coat carries his
      chart up to the bed of a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG PATIENT.

                                      DOCTOR
                    The MRI's back. 

                                      PATIENT
                    And?

      He takes her hand.  Oozing empathy:

                                      DOCTOR
                    It's what we expected.  The accident
                    caused serious damage...

                    HOUSE (V.O.)DOCTOR
        It's amnesia... ...It's amnesia.

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL:


      The nicest lounge in the hospital.  Plush leather reclining
      chairs, artwork on the walls.  HOUSE lies on one of the
      chairs, eating skittles and watching the above scene (from a
      daytime soap) on a plasma screen TV.  Dr. Lim enters with
      another OB, DR. KUBISAK.  They see House.

                                      KUBISAK
                          (pointedly)
                    Enjoying our lounge, House?

                                      HOUSE
                    Just getting milk for my coffee.

      He's not drinking coffee.  Notices them noticing.  Helpfully:

                                      HOUSE (CONT'D)
                    Which you're out of.

      The doctors exchange a look: what a dick.  Lim plops down on
      a couch while Kubisak opens the fridge, calls to Lim:

                                      KUBISAK
                    Flat or sparkling?

                    LIMHOUSE
          Sparkling.Flat.

      Kubisak ignores House, tosses a Pellegrino to Lim.

                                      KUBISAK
                    So the Hartigs...?

      House turns the sound up.

                                    LIM
                    Alright, so their baby gets a fever--

                                      KUBISAK
                    Don't tell me, kid had a seizure?

                                    LIM
                    Yep.  The parents of course start
                    freaking and I have to deal with
                    that for an hour.

                                      KUBISAK
                          (looking up from fridge)
                    Like it was your fault.

      House turns the sound down slightly.  He's eavesdropping.

                                    LIM
                          (smiles, a joke among
                            Ob/Gyns)
                    She was perfect when I delivered
                    her; you want to blame someone, blame
                    the pediatrician.

                                      KUBISAK
                    How's the kid now?

                                    LIM
                    Bowel obstruction, she's under
                      observation.  She'll be fine.

                                      KUBISAK
                      Pediatrician will take all the credit.

      Kubisak chuckles at the joke.  Turns to where House was
      sitting.  House is gone.

      Like the others, she's hooked up to an IV, an arterial line,

                    Diagnosed with a small bowel

                                      WILSON
                    I'm still amazed you're actually in
                    the same room with a patient.

                    baby.  Undiagnosed febrile illness,
                    101 degrees and trending upwards.

      House looks at Wilson, like: see? 

                                      WILSON
                    Wow.  That is amazing.  You hung out
                    in the OB/GYN lounge all morning and
                    you heard about two sick babies. 
                    It's eerie.

                    They fell sick within four hours of
                    each other.  They had the same
                    delivery room and their maternity
                    rooms were neighboring, so
                      transmission's possible.  And they
                    have the same symptoms.

                    The Hartig girl has a bowel
                      obstruction.  No matter how close
                    their beds are, I'm pretty sure kids
                    can't share a blockage.

                    What does "bowel obstruction" on a

                    Normally, I'd say it means that the
                    patient's bowel is obstructed.  But
                    I'm guessing you've got some deeper
                    truth to impart.

                    It means some random doctor of
                      indeterminate skill thinks that the
                    patient's bowel is obstructed.

                    Even if that is air, it could have
                    been there before the obstruction. 

      House looks at the two babies.  Firmly:

                                      HOUSE
                    No.  Something's infected both these
                    infants.

                                      CUDDY (V.O.)
                    And you're the only one to put it
                    together because...


      CUDDY is shuffling through some papers and largely ignoring
      House.

                                      HOUSE
                    Because I'm the only one who looked
                    at both kids.  I want them isolated. 
                    And I want the maternity ward shut
                    down.

                                      CUDDY
                    Because you're better at reading X-
                    rays than a radiologist.

                                      HOUSE
                      Radiologists always overread babies'
                    X-rays, especially when they're asked
                    to rule out a pathology.  He read
                    into it what he wanted.

                                      CUDDY
                    Which is exactly what you're doing. 
                    You're finding a cluster because it
                    would be interesting to find a
                    cluster.  Two plain old sick babies
                    would just bore you.

                                      HOUSE
                    This is why I don't waste money on
                    shrinks.  You give me these great
                    insights for free.

                                      CUDDY
                          (mock surprise)
                    Shrink?  If you'd consider seeing a
                    shrink, I'd pay for it myself.  The
                    hospital would hold a bake sale, for
                    God's sake.

                    Two sick babies...  It's very sad...
                    but it doesn't prove an epidemic.

      As she leaves...

                                      HOUSE
                    How many do?


      CHASE is sprawled out on a chair, taking a nap.  CAMERON
      sits at the desk, typing a letter.  FOREMAN is reading a
      large medical textbook.

      House enters, grabs Foreman's book and tosses it onto Chase. 
      Chase leaps up, totally confused--

                                      CHASE
                    Ow!

                    Get up.  We're going hunting.

                                      FOREMAN

                    Wabbits.

      And he leaves.  They follow.


      An AFRICAN-AMERICAN COUPLE (20s) is asleep on the single
      bed.  Their blue-capped BABY BOY lies on his back in the
      bassinet, staring upwards, alert.  House and Foreman enter. 
      The parents slowly rouse themselves as they notice the Doctors
      examining their baby.

                                      HOUSE
                    Hi.

      Foreman looks at the chart as House picks up the child.  The
      baby starts crying loudly.

      He hands the child to Foreman, says, sotto:

                    He's screaming, he's fine.

      House walks out, leaving Foreman with the confused parents...

                                      FOREMAN
                          (at a loss)
                    Good looking kid.

      Foreman puts the kid in its bassinet and quickly exits.  The
      parents are confused about what just happened... but somehow
      flattered.


      Cameron and Chase enter another room, to find a FATHER-TO-BE
      holding his VERY PREGNANT WIFE's hand.  She's in labor. 
      Groaning.  Doing breathing exercises.  The woman looks up,
      very surprised.  Chase and Cameron turn on their heels--

                                      CAMERON
                    Wrong room.

                                      CHASE
                    We'll see you later.

      They leave...


      ...and run into House and Foreman.

                                      CHASE
                    That's it, right?  Twelve rooms.

                                      CAMERON
                    Good news.  No epidemic.

      House says nothing.  He's clearly disappointed his theory
      hasn't panned out.

                                      FOREMAN
                          (to House)
                    Tragic, huh?

      The elevator doors open and some DOCTORS get out.  Which
      reminds House:

                    Overflow rooms.  Third floor.

      House gets into the elevator right before the doors close. 
      The rest of the team share a look, then hurry but it's too
      late, the doors are closed.  They push the button.

                                      FOREMAN
                    This imaginary infection has spread
                    to the next floor?  Maybe we should
                    check neighboring towns as well?

      Chase shrugs.  Typical House.


      House enters another room (on the floor above).  KIM CHEN
      and JUDY LUPINO (girlfriends, comp lit grad students) are
      surprised to see the doctor.  Judy, the birth mother, holds
      their baby BOY.

                                    JUDY LUPINO
                    We were just going to call...

                    He got hot all of a sudden?

                          (how did you know?)
                    Yeah.

      Judy shows the swaddled baby to House.  The poor kid is
      lethargic, out of it.  We can read it on House's face: this
      is a third sick baby.  It is an epidemic. 


      We're looking through the window into the NICU.  The eight
      babies who were here earlier are mostly gone.  The room is
      weirdly empty except for the three kids we've met (the Howsam,
      Hartig and now the Chen-Lupino baby) who have been isolated
      from the rest of the kids. 

      PAN OVER to Cuddy supervising ORDERLIES who wheel a baby in
      a bassinet down the hallway, towards the elevator.

      AT THE ELEVATOR, A YOUNG COUPLE gets off.  The wife is
      pregnant, about to pop.  Cuddy sees this and her face falls. 
      She hurries over--

                                      CUDDY

                    ambulance to take you to Princeton
                    General.

      Cuddy corrals the couple and NURSE ALPERT onto the elevator:

                    We have to leave?

                    Why are you--

      He's cut off by his wife's groan as she begins a contraction.

                    You'll be there in no time.

                    I'll be in the clinic; grab me if

                      unimportant.

      They follow him out.


      The Hartig baby is on a mobile incubator.  Chase and some
      ORDERLIES are taking her away from her distraught parents
      for testing.  The Hartigs watch as their baby's wheeled
      farther and farther down the hall, away from them.  Ethan
      leans against a wall.  Karen stands in the center of the
      hallway, her hands crossed.  (Their body language should
      show the toll this is taking on their relationship.)


      Away from the parents, Chase supervises TECHNICIANS as the
      Hartig child is given a full body MRI (a "babygram").  Her
      tiny body is strapped down, hands above her head on the
      platform.  The platform slowly slides inside the tube.

      INSIDE THE MRI

      Inside the machine.  A claustrophobic tunnel.  The banging
      sounds are deafening, like a machine gun battle.  But the
      Hartig child stares upwards, listless, unaware of its
      surroundings.

      IN THE OBSERVATION AREA

      Chase watches a monitor as the "babygram" appears -- an eerie
      full-size MRI showing the entire child.


      Cameron and Foreman sit with Kim Chen and Judy Lupino. 
      They're trying to hold in their emotions, and having a hard
      time of it, especially Judy (the birth mother, still in her

                    Maybe the vents?


      The hospital's cleared mothers and kids out of the maternity
      and delivery rooms.  Cuddy's here, trying to find the source
      of the infection.  She's got her own team -- FIVE MEDICAL
      STUDENTS -- swabbing different surfaces.  Wilson looks on
      dubiously as she speaks to a MALE MED STUDENT (sleep deprived,
      26 but looks 22).

                                      CUDDY
                    Could be airborne.

      Cuddy nods: of course.  The student goes off to instruct the
      rest of his team.

                    They're not delivering babies.

                    gel dispensers are empty or broken.

                                      WILSON
                    That's bad.  And yet diagnostically
                      completely insignificant.

                    If the staff can't clean their hands,
                    no wonder an infection's spread.

      Before he can tell her to calm down, Cuddy is on the move. 
      She has noticed the Male Med Student swabbing a sink.  His
      tie dips into the drain as he works.

      He spins the ultrasound's screen around so that she can see

                    We're taking your son off vancomycin.

      We're INTERCUTTING between the two rooms as the doctors give
      different diagnoses to the two sets of parents...

                    Seems to be a germ called pseudomonas.

                    We think it's MRSA.  Methycillin-
                    resistant staph aureas.  It's a very
                    resistant form of a very common bacteria.

                      Vancomycin is the best treatment for
                    MRSA, so we're going to keep giving
                    it to your boy.

                    Is it going to cure him?

      Foreman leans in.  Talks softly.

                    Your son is very sick.  You need to
                    know that.  This is a Hail-Mary.  It*
                    might cure him... but it might not.

      rises and leaves. 

      REVEAL Wilson, at the nearby Nurse's station, noticing the
      look on Kim and Judy's faces as Cameron walks away.

                    Alison.  Their baby is dying.  If
                    those parents weren't in tears by
                    the time you left, you didn't tell

                    for the likely death of their child!

      Cameron stops.  She speaks quietly, but angrily.

                                      CAMERON
                    If their son dies tomorrow?  You

                    those poor women have a few hours of

      She walks off.  Leaving Wilson wondering what the hell is
      wrong with her.


      House is leaving his office for the day, locking up.

                    Dr. House?

      Jill (the Norplant woman) is there with CHARLIE, a scruffy
      young man who clearly doesn't want to be there at all.

                                      HOUSE
                    Oh, no...

      House walks as quickly as he can away from her.  Which,
      obviously, isn't that quickly.  She tails him, Charlie
      trailing behind her.

                                    JILL
                    This is my husband Charlie.

                    thought I had--

                    Mono?

      Jill stares at him, pleading.  She really looks like she's
      about to have a meltdown.

                                    JILL

                    Shouldn't Charlie be tested?  You

                    I was.  I wasted a couple hours
                    chasing it down, but of course, turns
                    out the formula hasn't been anywhere

                    I am calm.

      She notices the Male Med Student she'd yelled at that morning. 
      He's standing at the Nurses' Station, talking to a NURSE. 
      His tie is once again peeking out of his jacket, and is now
      draping over the countertop. 

      Cuddy grabs a pair of scissors from the Nurses' Station and
      starts cutting off his tie.

                                    MALE MED STUDENT

                    I warned you.

      She hands him back the piece of his tie, then walks over to
      Wilson.  Wilson raises an eyebrow.

                    I did that calmly.

      Chase shocks the baby. 

      VFX: inside the baby's chest, his heart PULSES once as the
      electricity hits.  But it doesn't start beating on its own. 
      We hear the concern in the doctors' voices:

      House steps forward, puts a hand on Chase's arm, shakes his

      down.

      The doctors start taking off their gloves.  The nurse turns

      Cameron just stands there, can't stop staring down at the
      infant's body on the operating table.

      Silence for a beat.  Then House is back to work.

                    Tell them their child probably saved

                    Wilson, make sure she does her job.

      And House leaves.


      Wilson and Cameron enter to find the Chen-Lupino parents
      waiting nervously.  Two other sets of PARENTS also look up,
      expectant and scared.

      Judy Lupino's holding the hospital-supplied teddy bear in
      her arms.  She sees the look on the doctors' faces and
      immediately gets it.  Kim Chen looks and gets it, too.

      Wilson waits for Cameron to say something, but she remains
      silent.  Wilson steps forward as the couple breaks down...*                                                  HOUSE - Ep03 - GREEN - 8/13/04  40.




      Kim Chen and Judy Lupino cry and hold each other as they
      look upon the body of their son, who's been moved here. 
      He's been cleaned up a bit; the lines have been cut but
      they're still attached to his body.  Judy places her cheek
      on his belly as she cries.  Kim puts her fingers in his tiny
      hand.


      Wilson and Cameron walk and talk. 

                                      WILSON
                    Alison.  Something going on?

                    You were frozen back there...

      Cameron says nothing.  Wilson regards her a moment.  Not
      sure what to say.  Then Cameron notices Chase coming down
      the hallway toward them.  It doesn't look good--

                                      CAMERON

      CLOSE ON HOUSE siting on a bench, in a dark, cold, windowless
      room in the hospital's basement.  He's lost in thought. 
      Staring into the distance.

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL that House is looking at a tiny, sheet-

      He gets up, pulls the sheet off.  We don't see the dead

      He didn't save this child.

      We might think he's come here to commune with his patient,

                    Well, it only seems to hit children,
                    the mothers aren't sick, so...

                    the sick kids.

      They get up to go do their tasks.

                    I'll look into whether there's any
                      antivirals for these eight.

      As they're almost at the door, House is still ruminating.

                                      HOUSE
                    Wait.  The kids who were on the floor
                    but didn't get sick... are any of
                    them still in the hospital?

      On a monitor, Foreman watches as a bar graph appears,

                    And what's weirder, the healthy baby
                    we tested?  He's positive for
                    Echovirus 11 and CMV antibodies,
                    too.

      Across the room is the whiteboard listing the eight possible
      viruses.  Five of them are crossed off, leaving only Echovirus
      11, CMV, and Parvovirus B-19.  House stares at the board. 
      Did they go down the wrong path?  Then he gets it:

                                      HOUSE
                    Of course.  They're infants, they
                    have their mothers' blood, their
                    mothers' antibodies.

                                      FOREMAN
                    So we just learned nothing?

                                      HOUSE
                    No.  We have half the picture.  The
                    healthy kids survived because their
                    mothers' antibodies saved them.

                                      FOREMAN
                          (getting it)
                    If the mom had CMV in the past, she'd
                    have the antibodies for CMV, her kid
                    would be immune from it... 
                          (then)
                    So we test the sick kids' moms for
                      Echovirus, CMV and Parvovirus.

                                      HOUSE
                    And whichever they don't have the
                      antibodies for, that's what's killing
                    their kids.

      Foreman scrambles out the door.

      He walks to the whiteboard, where all the viruses but CMV, 
      Echovirus 11 and Parvovirus B-19 are now crossed out.

                    It's an enterovirus, it lodges in
                    the intestinal tract.

                      Enteroviruses cause diarrhea and flu-
                    like symptoms in adults; maybe a
                    rash.  But for newborns, it can be
                    deadly.  It's damaging her heart.

                    We're giving all the kids large doses
                    of IVIG.  It's a solution of
                      antibodies normally found in adult
                    blood.  We hope it will help.

                      Unfortunately, viruses are more
                    difficult to treat than bacterial
                      infections.  We still haven't found
                    a cure for the common cold.

      They lift her up. 

      The parents are standing close to each other, closer than
      we've seen them since the first scene.  Ethan carefully
      cradles Maxine's head, Karen her body.

      watch the Hartigs.  The parents are close to tears, holding
      in their emotion...  It's clear they desperately need this...

                    That would be no.

      He opens the door to leave.  Then he stops, a thought coming*
      to him.

      Chase is checking the Howsam baby.  Foreman and Cameron are
      looking at Maxine Hartig's BP monitor.

                                      FOREMAN
                    Chase.  Take a look.

      Chase walks over, looks at the monitor...


      Ethan Hartig pours a cup of coffee.  His wife rests on the
      bench.  They see Chase, Cameron and Foreman enter the lounge. 
      And here's what they think: we're about to hear that our
      daughter is dead.  They're statues as the doctors approach.

      And then Chase smiles.

                                      ETHAN HARTIG
                          (stunned)
                    Oh God.  It's good news?

      Karen bursts into tears.  Then Ethan.

      Cameron works on some paperwork at the Nurses' Station near*

                    Thanks.

                    And no wonder.  You've had a real
                    hard time the last couple days. 

                                      CAMERON
                    And you haven't? 

                                      HOUSE
                    Not like you.

      She doesn't say anything.

                                      HOUSE (CONT'D)
                    Anyone who's that awkward either has
                    no experience with death, or too
                    much.  And I'm pretty sure it's not
                    the former.

      Cameron doesn't like being put under House's microscope.

                    Chase told me about that idea you
                    had, the parents holding the baby...
                    where did you get that?

      She doesn't reply.

                                      HOUSE (CONT'D)
                    You lost someone, didn't you? 
                          (off her silence)
                    Did you lose a baby?

      Cameron's stunned he'd ask her that.*

                                      CAMERON
                    You can be a real bastard.

      She walks away.  FOLLOW HER as she turns a corner and sees*
      the Hartig family heading towards the elevator. 

      They're happy, vibrant.  Talking excitedly, though we're too
      far away to hear.  Ethan pushes Karen, who's in a wheelchair. 
      She holds her baby in one arm and a large bouquet of flowers
      in the other.  They board the elevator.  Ethan kisses his
      wife.  Kisses his daughter. 

      Cameron watches, her happiness for the Hartigs mixed with
      some profound sadness.


      The ward is being reopened.  ORDERLIES moving equipment back
      in.  House stands outside the NICU, thinking, staring.  Wilson
      finds him there.

                      Enteroviruses are spread by humans...

                    him.

                                      WILSON

                                      HOUSE
                    And the babies didn't share any common
                      personnel.  That's what's weird.

                    Yeah.  That's what's weird.

      Wilson takes off.  House stands there thinking for a long
      beat.  Then House hears a cough.  He turns to see a 65-YEAR-
      OLD WOMAN.  She wears a T-shirt that reads "Hospital
      Volunteer" and carries a basket of teddy bears under her
      arm.

      VFX: We FLASH BACK.  QUICK CUTS show House piecing together
      how the infection was spread:

      -- The Volunteer walks the hallway with her basket.  She
      scratches her nose and brushes her hand against a bear.  We
      ZOOM IN TO A MICROSCOPIC LEVEL and see the virus moving from
      the skin of her hand to the bear's artificial fur...

      -- She hands the bear to Karen Hartig. 

      -- Karen wipes her baby's mouth.  We ZOOM IN to show the
      germ spreading from Karen's hands to Maxine's mouth and
      latching on...

      BACK TO SCENE

      The Volunteer scratches her nose.  Turns to see House staring
      at her like a hawk at a mouse.  Looks behind her to see what
      House is looking at, realizes it's her.

      chair in the fancy lounge, watching his soap opera.
