
    No light; stacks of crates and file cabinets loon out of
    the darkness.  Then, the heavy door is POUNDED from the
    outside.  It SPLINTERS, breaks.  Three men enter the room
    and, waving flashlights, begin to ransack it.  All 
    cabinets, crates and files are stamped "Bureau 39."

    Cabinets are torn open and contents either dumped on the
    floor or stuffed into sacks.  The leader of the trio, 
    DEVANE (mid-thirties, a CIA type with cold, hard 
    features), crowbars open a crate.  Inside, carefully 
    packed, are a variety of mineral and metal fragments.  He
    sorts through them until he comes to a leather pouch.  He
    opens the pouch and empties its contents into his hand.
    He holds a green-glowing chunk of crystal: _Kryptonite_.

                                                                  *

               When you said Italian I had no idea

               Spend the rest of your life... I

                             LUTHOR
               I'm serious.

    Luthor smoothly drops to one knee and produces a large
    ring case.  He opens the case to display a tastefully
    enormous diamond ring, offers it to Lois.  Lois takes it,
    impressed with it's beauty, but more impressed with the
    importance of this moment in her young life.

                             LUTHOR (Cont'd)
               Lois Lane, will you marry me?

                             LOIS
                     (stunned, after a pause)
               I don't know what to say.

                             LUTHOR
               There are only three possible
               choices:  Yes.  No. Maybe.

    Lois isn't prepared to opt for any of the above at the 
    moment, but is obviously flattered.

                             LOIS
               It's not that simple.  What about                  *

               Is there something else? Some 
               other hesitation?

    She still doesn't answer.

                     (gently)

               Yes.

                             LUTHOR
               So, it's 'maybe', for now.

                             LOIS
               _Maybe_ 'maybe'.

    She hands back the ring.

                             LOIS (Cont'd)
               It _is_ beautiful.

                             LUTHOR
               Without you, it's just a chunk of
               rock.  On your hand, it's priceless
               to me, more important than any 
               other object in my life.

    The co-pilot approaches along the aisle, hands Luthor a

    FADE IN:


    Lois and CLARK, mid-conversation, enter the building and 
    walk toward the elevators.

                             LOIS
                     (frustrated)
               How many is that?

                             CLARK
               Six.

                             LOIS
                     (counting on her
                      fingers)
               Dancer, Prancer, Comet, Blitzen,

                             CLARK
               That's seven.
                     (singsong)
               One more.

                             LOIS
               Donner...

                             CLARK
               You're stuck.

                             LOIS
               I am not stuck.
                     (thinking, then giving
                      up)
               I'm stuck.

                             CLARK
               Five bucks.  'Bucks', get it?

                             LOIS
               Okay, okay.  Just tell me the name.

    Clark puts his arm around Lois.

                             CLARK
               Vixen.

    They've arrived at the elevators.  A Businessman is 
    already waiting, standing beneath a 'No Smoking' sign. 
    Oblivious, he begins to light up.  With a covert blast 
    of _SUPER BREATH_, Clark blows out the lighter flame.  As 
    they wait...

               You're on.  Piece of cake.

    The Businessman again tries to light his cigarette.  Clark 
    _BLOWS_ it out.

                             CLARK
               Go.

               Sleezy?

               Joe, Steve...

                             CLARK
               Time's up.  That's ten you owe me.

    The Businessman has been shaking his lighter.  Again he 
    tries, again Clark _BLOWS_ it out.  Lois reaches into her 
    purse and hands Clark a bill as the elevator arrives.

                             LOIS
               I hate this, I hate this.  Tell me.

                             CLARK
               It's so obvious.

    The Businessman cuts in front of Lois, heading for the 
    elevator.  She snatches the cigarette out of his mouth, 
    breaks it in half, dumps it in a trash bin.  He stops, 
    astonished.

                             LOIS
               Can't you read?!

    She points to the 'No Smoking' sign.  She and Clark step 
    into the elevator, the Businessman stays where he is.' As 
    the doors begin to-close...

               I'm just the messenger, boys and

               what I've been told.  And that's

    Another groundswell of disapproval, DROWNING OUT

               Clark, we're newspaper people.
               We're supposed to have the
               resources to write the news _as_
               _it_ _happens_.  Old news isn't

               I've seen this before.  Management
               pretends there's this big crisis to 
               panic everyone into cutting costs.

               I heard some people talking about a

               Nah.  It's not his fault.  He would

                             LUTHOR
               For those of you who don't know me,
               my name is Lex Luthor.
                     (beat)
               I, no less than you, have been
               greatly distressed by the sea of
               troubles that has mired Metropolis'
               one great newspaper.  I don't know
               why your advertisers have deserted
               you and circulation is down.  I
               don't know why the banks have shut
               off your credit lines.  And I don't
               know why you depleted your cash
               reserves through unnecessary
               expenditures.
                     (glares at the "suits"
                      with him)
               Though I have my suspicions.
                     (beat)
               I do know that the problems can be
               solved with strong leadership and
               fiscal responsibility.

                             LUTHOR (Cont'd)
               Therefore, I have taken the one                    *

               Today begins a new era.  I promise
               you no interference, only a few 
               minor modifications, and _no_

               It's not true.  Give him some

    FADE IN:


    Business as usual, except someone is hanging a picture of
    Lex Luthor on the wall.



    Perry enters his office.  To his annoyance, Luthor is
    sitting behind his desk, speaking to someone whose back is
    to Perry.

                             LUTHOR
               'Morning, Perry. I hope you'll
               forgive this intrusion, but my
               office won't be ready until
               tomorrow and I needed a quiet place
               to make some calls.

                             PERRY
               Uh, well, no problem.  Now, if

               I don't believe you've met Chip

    The man Luthor was facing turns around. CHIP PETERSON is
    an asp in yuppie's clothing.

                             PERRY
               No.

               A pleasure to meet you, sir. I'm a
               great admirer of your work.  You've
               had such an illustrious career.

               Business School.  Top of his class.
               He's very interested in journalism.

               Chip is our new Supervising
               Editor-in-Chief.

    Perry takes a moment to digest this.

               Don't worry, Mr. White.  We'll make
               the transition as smooth and 
               painless as possible.

    Perry puts his hand on Chip's shoulder.

                             PERRY
               Son, will you excuse us?

                             CHIP
               That won't be necessary.

                             PERRY
               I think it is.

    Perry hauls Chip out of the chair and propels him out the 
    door.

               pimply-faced, under-aged cow 'chip'

               That's one interpretation.

               Here's another.  Get the hell out

    Luthor doesn't budge, instead settles back in Perry's 
    chair.

               work together.  Maybe even to love 
               each other.  Think of this... as

               Think of this as our divorce.  Period.

    Perry SLAMS the door on his way out.  A moment later he 
    re-enters, grabs his Elvis picture from the wall, exits 
    with another SLAM.  Luthor sighs.



    Lois, happily humming to herself, emerges to find Perry,

    Luthor leans over the desk.  His manner is friendly, but 
    firm.

               Excellent piece of writing, Clark,

               Why?  This is a hot topic.

                             LUTHOR
               'Controversial' would be a better
               word.

                             CLARK
               Allegations of excessive rate hikes 
               at Metropolis Electric is 
               controversial?

                             LUTHOR
               That _necessary_ rate hikes are 
               'excessive' is _your_ opinion, 
               not the opinion of this paper.                     *

                             CLARK
               This wouldn't have anything to do 
               with your being on the Board of 
               Metropolis Electric, would it?

                             LUTHOR

               Is this how it's going to be,
               Luthor?  The 'free press' free only

                             LUTHOR

               around here, Kent, you're 'free' to
               leave.

    Luthor turns back toward Perry's office without seeing
    Lois or realizing she's overheard.  She crosses to stand
    by Clark's desk, looks after Luthor.

                     (astonished)
               What?  No, of course not.  I just
               hired another fellow to work with
               him.  Take some of the load off.

                             LOIS
               But Perry wants the load.  He
               won't accept this.  He'll quit.

                             LUTHOR
               I sincerely hope not.  It would be
               a great loss to the paper.  If he
               only weren't so resistant to 
               progress.
                     (pausing, worried)
               If I've made a mistake, I better
               talk to him.  I'll apologize.

                             LOIS
               And Jimmy and Jack?  And Clark?
               What were you two arguing about?

                             LUTHOR
               I gave Jimmy and Jack jobs.  The 
               only ones available.  I'll have 
               then back up here as soon as 
               humanly possible.  I promise.
                     (beat)
               As for Clark, he seems to have this 
               unreasonable hostility toward me.  
               I don't know why.  I have nothing 
               but respect for him.

               me. Everything will turn out fine.

    Lois finally succumbs, smiles.

               It's going to work out fine, Clark.
               Just give it time.  Lex will turn 
               things around.

                             LOIS

               Look, Clark, I'm not naive.  I know
               Lex didn't reach his station in
               life by being a nice guy.  But look
               at the _good_ he's done.  Luthor
               Hospital, Luthor Home for Children,
               Luthor Foundation for the Arts.                    *

               A cover.  It's all a cover.

                             LOIS
               Why?  If he's such a rotten human

                             CLARK
               Because _that's_ the part he enjoys

               more than just evil.  He's a

    Jonathan and Martha exchange a glance.  They know he's in

               You have to prevent it, Clark.
               Knowing what you know about Luthor.

               Maybe it's time to do more than

    people start racing for exits.  Clark peers through the
    floor with _X-RAY VISION_.

               Get everyone out!

    Lois nods, hurries toward the exit. Clark rushes toward
    the storeroom door.  Smoke is in the room.  He loosens his
    tie, removes his glasses, enters the storeroom.

    More EXPLOSIONS, flame, smoke everywhere.  One of the
    metal struts supporting the staircase snaps, but, before
    anyone falls, Superman is there to hold it together as the
    workers pass in safety.  When all have gone, Superman
    looks around to see...

    On his hands and knees, he pushes through a door into the
    stairwell and begins to crawl toward the stairs, but it's
    too far and the smoke is too thick.  Then Superman is at
    his side, scooping him up in his arms.

    Lois enters his study.  Luthor is breakfasting in a 
    high-back chair with a tray.  Mrs. Cox is at his side.  
    Lex stands as Lois comes in, gives her a kiss.

               So pleased to meet you.

    She lays a hand lightly, possessively on Luthor's 
    shoulder.  Lois looks at it.

               Mrs. Cox is my personal assistant.

               Whatever's necessary.

    Mrs. Cox leaves.  Lois turns back to business.

               Lois, there isn't an advertiser in
               this city that I could count on for
               revenue.  Besides, the Planet was 
               pitifully under-insured.
               Rebuilding makes no economic sense.

               another job... Perry's threatening 
               an early retirement.

                             LUTHOR
               Is that all bad?  Perry deserves 
               retirement.  He's worked too hard 
               for too many years.  Let him enjoy 
               life for a change.

                             LOIS
               His life was the Planet.  Mine,

               Lois, I know you called the Planet 
               home.  But I can make another home 
               for you.

                             LOIS
               Lex, I couldn't just sit around 
               organizing dinner parties.  I need 
               to work.

                             LUTHOR
               I know that, my darling.  That's

               Let me make a few calls.  I know
               some of the bailiffs.

    Jimmy hangs up on the DIAL TONE, turns and looks back

    into a large room where, seated on the floor, around the
    "table," are Perry, Lois, Clark and several other
    Planeteers.  They're all sipping champagne, Perry slightly
    more than sipping.  On the wall is a banner that says
    "Happy Retirement, Mr. White!" A belly dancer, CLANGING
    finger cymbals, gyrates wildly around the room.

                             LOIS
               Clark, you're talking about a man I
               trust and admire, who's always been
               completely truthful with me.                       *
                     (beat)
               If you really cared about me, you'd
               let me... _help_ me be happy.  I've
               gotten a good job and found someone
               who wants to spend the rest of his
               life with me.  What's wrong with
               that?

                             CLARK
                     (very frustrated and
                      angry)
               Okay.  If that's what you want,
               then... fine.  Get in bed with the
               devil.

                             LOIS
                     (equally angry)
               Fine.

                             CLARK
               Let's get back to the party.

                             LOIS
               And have a _really_ _good_ _time_.

    The duo head back toward the table only to see Perry now
    gyrating with the belly dancer as the others CLAP out the
    rhythm.

                                                CUT TO:


    Lois enters Luthor's study. He stands to greet her with
    open arms.

                             LUTHOR
               So... how was the retirement
               dinner?

                             LOIS
               Painful.

                             LUTHOR
               I'm sorry.  I wish there was
               something I could do to help.

    Luthor takes Lois into his arms and she stares up at him.

                             LUTHOR (Cont'd)
               What is it?

                             LOIS
               Nothing.  It's just... do I really
               know you?  Know enough about you?

                                                (CONTINUED)

                             LUTHOR
               My life is an open book.  Shall I
               read it to you?

                             LOIS
               Only the parts you wouldn't want
               anyone else to know.

                             LUTHOR
               Okay.
                     (beat)
               I started with nothing... orphaned
               at age thirteen.

                             LOIS
               It must have been terrible.

                             LUTHOR
               Yes.  But it made me strong.
                     (beat)
               I'm no saint, Lois. I've done
               questionable things in pursuing
               success.  Unfortunately, that's the
               nature of big business.



    Luthor meets with the "suits" who accompanied him to
    announce he had bought the Planet.

                             LUTHOR
               Don't worry about the advertisers
               and the banks.  They'll do what I
               tell them to do.  The Board's
               decision to sell the Daily Planet
               to me must be immediate and
               unanimous.  Naturally, your loyalty
               will be rewarded, or should I say
               'compensated.'



                             LUTHOR
               Sometimes, out of jealousy or
               frustration, I've over-reacted.



    Luthor sets the timer on an explosive incendiary device,
    puts it in a lunch pail (identical to Jack's), hands it to
    the gloved Mrs. Cox.

                             LUTHOR
               I've been ruthless toward my
               enemies.



    Luthor loads a full clip into his 45 automatic and places
    it inside the attache case.



                             LUTHOR
               But, as God is my witness, I swear
               to you, from this moment on, I will
               change.  I no longer want to hurt
               anyone.


68  ANGLE ON LOCKED CABINET                                     68 

    We can see flickers of a deadly green glow slipping
    through the cracks.


69  BACK TO LUTHOR                                              69 

    He walks over to his desk, takes out the box with the
    engagement ring in it, brings it back to Lois.

                             LUTHOR
               Lois, I'm ready to devote my life
               to you, to commit to you utterly
               and eternally.

    Luthor is down on one knee again.

                             LUTHOR (Cont'd)
               Will you marry me?

    Lois stares at him a moment.  She thinks back to:



                             LOIS
               Superman, is there any hope for us?

    Superman shakes his head "no."



                             LOIS
               Yes, Lex.  I will marry you.

    Luthor pulls Lois toward him and they kiss, passionately.

    Lois momentarily parts from Luthor.  Has she heard
    something?  Maybe not.  After a moment, Luthor pulls her
    back and they kiss again.
