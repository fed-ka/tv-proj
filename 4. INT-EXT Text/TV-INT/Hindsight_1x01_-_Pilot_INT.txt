      Becca and Lolly, barely standing upright now, analyze the 
      options at a jukebox.

                                  BECCA
                    Oh my God, yes! A-25! Look look 
                    look!

                                  LOLLY
                    Yes! Do it! 

      They throw their arms around each other and jump around as 
       Groove is in the Heart  blasts from the sound system.


      Becca and Lolly join the revelers s countdown --

                                  VOICES
                    Ten, nine, eight...

      Behind them, we see big foil balloons that spell out 1997. 

                                  VOICES (CONT D)
                    Seven, six, five...

                                  BECCA
                    I love you.

                                  LOLLY
                    You re so mushy. 
                          (kissy face)
                    I love you too.

                                  VOICES
                    Four, three, two... Happy new year!

      Everyone bursts into drunken Auld Lang Syne. Someone points a 
      disposable camera at them and they smile. CLICK! We FREEZE...

      SFX:A KNOCK                                                                                    3.



    The singing stops abruptly with the knock.

                                  ANDY (O.C.)
                    Becca? We should motor. 

    We REVERSE to see Becca, grown-up and polished now, hair 
      sleek, eyebrows groomed, face wistful, dressed in an elegant 
      navy sheath. She s been paging through an old photo album. 

    We pull back to see she s in her CHILDHOOD BEDROOM, now 
      cleared out of adolescent artifacts but for a few classics 
      (e.g. tennistrophies, framed picture of DylanMcKay). 

    We REVERSE AGAIN on the picture in the album and see a small 
      handwritten caption beneath it: Becca and Lolly, New Year s 
    Eve 1997.

    She snaps the album closed and sets it down on her bed. 

                                  BECCA
                    Coming.

    As she leaves, we catch a glimpse of a simple, elegant white 
      gownhanging on the front of the armoire.


      Well-dressed guests mill around for cocktails, greeting each 
      other and drinking Champagne.

      Camera finds Becca as she works the room like a pro, kissing 
    and hugging some guests, shaking hands with others that she s 
      meeting tonight for the first time. She s cool as a cucumber, 
    but she s not happy. The flowers, an unkempt and whining 
      child, the waiter overfilling the wine glasses: she murders 
      them all with her eyes.

                                  ANDY (O.C.)
                    You realize this rehearsal dinner 
                    is nicer than most weddings.

      Becca turns to see her groom, ANDY KELLY, 40 - the ultimate 
      nice guy. 

                                  BECCA
                    But the flowers are the wrong 
                    color. 

      Andy looks at the flowers. Doesn t notice anything amiss.                                                                                    4.


                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    Purple orchids. Purple! I asked for 
                    celadon and shamrock. What is this, 
                    a doctor s office? 

                                  ANDY
                    Everything that mattersis perfect. 
                    I like purple orchids.

      Becca kisses him again as thanks for saying the right thing.

                                  BECCA
                    I like you.

    His eyes follow hers as she glances over at what s really 
      bothering her: an empty seat...witha placecardfor LOLLY.

                                  ANDY 
                    I m sorry she didn t show.

      Becca looks pained, but before she can really respond...

                                  GEORGIE (O.C.)
                    There sthe blushing bride-to-be.

      Becca turns and sees her mother, GEORGIE BRACY McNAMARA, 60, 
    and Georgie s husband DONALD McNAMARA, 65, who just got here 
    and already looks like he wants to leave.

                                  BECCA
                    Hi, Mom.

                                  GEORGIE
                    Don t sound so overjoyed. Hello, 
                    Andrew. Are your parents here yet?

    She offers up a cheek to Andy.

                                  ANDY
                    Yes, they re here, and they re so 
                    excited to see you. 

                                  GEORGIE
                    Why? I ve known them for thirty 
                    years, we can t possibly have 
                    anything new to talk about.

                                  ANDY
                    I ll go find them.

      Georgie glances around the room, assessing. Disapproving.                                                                                    5.


                                  GEORGIE
                    Greek food. So spicy.
                          (to Becca)
                    No Lolly?
                          (to Donald)
                    Her best friend from college. They 
                    haven t spoken in years.

      Donald, who is clearly already familiar with the story, gives 
      Becca a sympathetic glance.

                                  GEORGIE (CONT D)
                    Such a shame. I adored her. What a 
                    free spirit.

                                  BECCA
                    You used to think she was a bad 
                    influence.

                                  GEORGIE
                    Nonsense. She marched to her own 
                    drummer, but... you needed someone 
                    like that. As a counterbalance. 
                    You ve always been so wound up.

                                  BECCA
                          (grinding her teeth)
                    Wonder where I got thatfrom.

                                  GEORGIE
                    I don t see your brother, either.

                                  BECCA
                    Mom, you know these things are hard 
                    for him. He ll be here.

                                  LINCOLN (O.C.)
                    There s my girl!

      Becca is relieved to spot her dad, LINCOLN BRACY, a former 
      quarterback with a million-dollar smile; the stylish sylph on 
    his arm is his girlfriend, SABRINA ZABAR, 30 (thin, pretty, 
      your basic nightmare).

      Georgie looks like she s about to bolt --

                                  GEORGIE
                    Well, if it isn t the prom queen 
                    and her sugar daddy.

                                  BECCA
                    Mom. Just... stay. Say hello. Be 
                    nice.                                                                                    6.


      Lincoln envelopes Becca in a huge bear hug. Coming out of it, 
      Becca gives Sabrina a big, ice-cold smile.

                                  SABRINA
                        (I hate you)
                    Becca, you look beautiful.

                                  BECCA
                        (I hate you more)
                    So do you, Sabrina.

                                  SABRINA
                    Can I tell her our news?
                          (jumping the gun)
                    We re engaged!

      Sabrina links her arm through Lincoln s, showing off her 
      sizable emerald ring. Georgie freezes. Becca glances from one 
      parent to the other, waiting for the grenade to explode. But 
      both of them have frozen smiles on their faces. Finally, 
      Donald carefully breaks the ice:

                                  DONALD
                      Congratulations, Link.

      Lincoln shakes hands with Donald as the two of them silently 
      acknowledge the futility of trying to please all the women in 
      your life at the same time.


    The dinner is in full swing - everyone is talking and 
      laughing. Becca sits between Andy and an empty chair. She 
      plays along, laughing and smiling, but we can see her head is 
      someplace else.

    Her brother JASON BRACY, 42, slips into the seat next to her. 
      He s handsome but gaunt. Looks like he s done some living.

                                  BECCA
                    Jason! You re here! 

                                  JASON
                    Just for a minute. I can t stay.

    She gives him a plaintive look, but accepts what she can get.

                                  BECCA
                    Did you hear? Dad s engaged to 
                    Sabrina.

                                  JASON
                          (dry as a bone)
                    Fantastic news!                                                                                     7.


                                  BECCA
                    We should send them an Edible 
                    Arrangement. 

                                  JASON
                    Yeah. Just all prunes.

      Becca and Jason stifle laughter. She gazes at him fondly, 
      wistfully. He s already squirming, ready to bolt. 

                                  JASON (CONT D)
                    Think I ll go out for a smoke.

                                  BECCA
                          (nostalgic)
                    Remember when you used to be able 
                    to smoke inside?

                                  JASON
                    Thought you quit.

                                  BECCA
                    Yeah. But when I see someone with a 
                    cigarette I want to french kiss 
                    them just to suck the smoke out of 
                    their throat.
                          (hopeful)
                    Come back?

    He nods and heads for the door. She knows he won t come back. 

      CAMERA FOLLOWS Becca s gaze to SIMON GLASS, 50, her boss. 
      Picture a bitchy, moody Phillip Seymour Hoffman. He checks 
    his watch for the hundredth time, and then catches Becca 
      looking at him. He breaks into a big, fake smile and raises 
    his glass, tapping it with a knife.

                                  SIMON
                    Everyone! A toast, please. 
                          (raising his glass)
                    To my dear Rebecca, who came to 
                    work for me when she was just slip 
                    of a thing in tragic Ann Taylor 
                    separates. My little lump of clay - 
                    you ve been a tremendous assistant 
                    and a true asset to our company 
                    for... how long has it been?

                                  BECCA
                          (kill me please)
                    Fifteen years.                                                                                    8.


                                  SIMON
                    Well. I m so glad you ve found love 
                    again and I hope the temp you hired 
                    to fill in for you during your 
                    honeymoon isn t as unpleasant as 
                    the last one you hired for your 
                    last honeymoon.

      Everyone laughs and claps, somewhat awkwardly. 

                                  BECCA
                    Thank you, Simon... 
                          (muttering)
                    For making it all about you. 

      Andy puts his arm around Becca and gives her a squeeze.

                                  ANDY
                    It s just Simon being Simon.

                                  BECCA
                    If you d told me 15 years ago I d 
                    still be working for him, I d have 
                    scratched your eyes out. 

                                  ANDY
                    He s an amazing producer. You ve 
                    made such great connections. And 
                    he s promoted you every year...

                                  BECCA
                    He trims his toenails in front of 
                    me.

                                  ANDY
                    ...And that is a disgusting mental 
                    image that I will never un-see. 

                                  BECCA
                    Would you excuse me for a moment?


      Becca locks herself in a stall and sits down on the closed 
      toilet lid. Just needs to decompress for a second.

    The door creaks open. Enter Georgie and one of her cronies, 
      NANCY (a certain age).

                                  NANCY (O.S.)
                    ...Well, thank God she s settling 
                    down before she s forty.                                                                                    9.


                                  GEORGIE (O.S.)
                    Settling being the operative word. 
                    Although after what she went 
                    through the first time, she could 
                    use a boring husband. 

                                  NANCY
                    I never understood why she was in 
                    such a rush to marry Sean. They 
                    were so young.

                                  GEORGIE (O.S.)
                    Don t you remember? She was madly 
                    in love. They had to be together. 
                     Mom, you will never understand our 
                    love.  Lincoln was beside himself.

    ON BECCA: cringing. The truth stings.


      Becca crosses the lobby. The doorman, VINCENT, 45, temples 
      greying, gives Becca a wide smile.

                                  VINCENT
                    Aw, there s my girl. Big day 
                    tomorrow!

                                  BECCA
                    Yeah, like d j  vu all over again.

                                  VINCENT
                    Some brides are so beautiful, they 
                    gotta do it twice.

                                  BECCA
                    Vince, you re sweet. Maybe I ll 
                    marry you next.


      Becca eenie-meenie-miney-mo selects and opens a bottle of 
      wine from Lincoln s wine fridge. Just as she pours herself a 
      glass, she hears the door opening...

                                  LINCOLN (O.C.)
                    Drinking alone, kid?

      Becca turns to face her dad, guilty as charged.

                                  BECCA
                    I m not alone. You re here! And... 
                    Sabrina.

      Sabrina looks past Becca and focuses on the wine bottle.                                                                                    11.


                                  SABRINA
                    That is an extremely expensive 
                    bottle of wine, Becca.

                                  BECCA
                    Oh. I just picked one at random.

                                  SABRINA
                    Yes, obviously.

                                  BECCA
                    Sorry. 

                                  SABRINA
                    Did it occur to you that we might 
                    have been saving that bottle for a 
                    special occasion?

                                  BECCA
                    My wedding s not a special 
                    occasion?

                                  SABRINA
                          (muttering)
                    It s not like it s your first 
                    wedding.

                                  BECCA
                          (oh, it s on)
                    I made a youthful mistake -- 

                                  LINCOLN
                    Okay. Both of you. Stop. Everyone 
                    go to bed. We re all tired and 
                    tomorrow is a big day. 

      Lincoln is always the peacemaker. He kisses Becca s forehead 
    and guides Sabrina out of the kitchen towards their bedroom. 
    As Sabrina glances back, Becca drains her glass of wine.


      Becca skulks down the hallway, trying not to look at the 
      framed photos on the walls -- mainly adventure photos of 
      Sabrina and Lincoln: sky diving, swimming with dolphins. 
      Subversively, she swaps a picture of Sabrina with one of her 
    and Jason, grinning, her front teeth missing.


      Back in Becca s bedroom where we first met her.                                                                                     12.


    She sits down and picks up the ALBUM again and lies back 
      against the pillows, opening it once more to the same photo 
    we saw of her and Lolly at New Year s 1997. She flips a few 
      pages ahead...toa PHOTO of Becca dressed as Veronica, Lolly 
    as Betty, and a guy (we ll soon meet him as SEAN) dressed as 
      a pirate. We see the caption in Becca s compact, meticulous 
      handwriting: Becca, Lolly and Sean, 10/31/97. Becca smiles 
      wistfully at the memory...


    We POP to a memory of the night this photo was taken. Becca 
    is with LOLLY in a bar, both in a fit of laughter outside the 
      men s room. Once again, they re both trashed.

                                  LOLLY
                    I mma watch the door for you. I 
                    love you. I won t let annnnnybody 
                    in. Swearta god!

                                  BECCA
                    Swear! Like really!

                                  LOLLY
                    Swear.


      Becca crouches over the toilet and hears the door creak open.

                                  BECCA
                    Lolly, that had better be you.

    But instead, Becca emerges from the lone stall to find SEAN 
      ABRAMS (22, tall, athletic but artistic, too cute for words), 
      pleased but not at all surprised to encounter a girl in the 
      men s room. He gives her a crooked smile. That smile...!

                                  SEAN
                    Who s Lolly?

                                  BECCA
                    I don t... I don t know.

      Stick a fork in her, she s done.


    She flips to another page and we briefly see an 8 x 10  photo 
      from Becca s first wedding day - Becca in a frothy white 
      dress and SEAN in a tuxedo are exiting the church, smiling, 
    as guests throw birdseed. She flips past this page quickly, 
    not wishing to dwell here.                                                                                    13.


      Becca flips to the last page of the album, which features 
      just one photo of her and Lolly, bundled up in Times Square: 
      another year, another New Year s Eve. The ball about to drop 
      says 2003. This is the last memory she chose to preserve; 
      there is nothing on the next page, no next volume. She closes 
    the book and reflects for a moment.

      Then: a knock at the door.

      Jason pops his head in. Becca s face lights up... until she 
      sees that Jason isn t looking for company.

                                  JASON
                    Can I borrow twenty bucks? 
                          (explaining himself)
                    For a pizza.

                                  BECCA
                    Didn t you eat at the dinner?

                                  JASON
                          (wincing)
                    Greek food?

      Becca gets up and hands him a twenty from her wallet. He 
      spots the photo album.

                                  JASON (CONT D)
                    Tripping down memory lane?

                                  BECCA
                    Oh, you know. Just questioning 
                    every decision I ve ever made. 
                          (sighing)
                    Don t you sometimes wish you could 
                    go back and start over? 

                                  JASON
                    You re talking to the 35-year-old
                    guy who s living with his dad.

                                  BECCA
                    You re not livinghere. 

                                  JASON
                    Right. I m just staying here with 
                    all my stuff and I don t live 
                    anywhere else.
                          (off her look)
                    It s okay, Becca. I m regrouping.                                                                                     14.


                                  BECCA
                    But that s just it. If you could go 
                    back and do it all over again, but 
                    knowing everything you know now... 
                    think of all the things you would 
                    change.

                                  JASON
                    Think of all the things I could 
                    screw up.

                                  BECCA
                    Think of all the things I didscrew 
                    up. 
                          (re: Lolly)
                    I miss her so much.

                                  JASON
                     Do not pursue the past. Do not 
                    lose yourself in the future. The 
                    past no longer is. The future has 
                    not yet come. Look deeply at life 
                    as it is.  

                                  BECCA
                    Profound. Fortune cookie? 

                                  JASON
                    Buddhist proverb. We bedazzled it 
                    onto tote bags in rehab.

    He winks at her, uses the twenty to wave goodbye, and 
      disappears.

    She rubs her temples. She has to clear her head. Shower?


      Becca stands under the beating hot water, trying to get 
      centered. She closes her eyes, remembering...

                                  VOICES (O.S.)
                    Ten, nine, eight...


    ON BECCA in the shower. She rubs her eyes as her focus starts 
    to get blurry. 

                                  VOICES (O.S.)
                    Four, three, two...

    The edges of her peripheral vision start to go black. As she 
      faints, we...

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.


       The Sign  by Ace of Base playing on the clock radio wakes 
      Becca from a fitful night s sleep. She rubs her eyes. Looks 
      around. How dshe get here? 


      Becca splashes water on her face, takes two Advil, then two 
      more. Ugh... her head is pounding. She must vedrank more 
      than she realized last night. She needs coffee. And air. 

    She drops her robe to get dressed and catches a glimpse of 
      herself in her underwear. Damn. She looks good. 

                                  BECCA
                    Huh. That Tracy Anderson video 
                    really paid off.

    As she admires herself, she doesn t notice the reflection in 
    the bathroom mirror of her OLD WEDDING GOWN on the armoire.


      Becca goes to make herself a coffee. 

                                  BECCA
                          (muttering to herself)
                    Where s the Keurig? 
                          (calling out)
                    Hey, where s the Keurig? 

    No answer. 

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                          (mimicking Sabrina)
                     Your dad and I don t drink coffee 
                    anymore. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    16.

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    We drink green tea, for the 
                      antioxidants.  
                          (mimicking Lincoln)
                     Isn t she terrific? Sabrinatakes 
                    such great care of me.  
                          (as herself)
                    Do you even know what antioxidants 
                    are, Sabrina? Can you spell 
                    antioxidants? Jesus H. Christ, 
                    you d better have some instant 
                    around here somewhere.

    She finds a can of instant coffee in the cabinet. Ugh. 

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    We will all drink Maxwell House in 
                    hell.


      Becca knocks on the door to Jason s bedroom.

                                  BECCA
                    I m going to Starbucks. You want 
                    anything?

                                  JASON (O.S.)
                    Uh, no thanks!

      Muffled noises from behind the door. A girl s giggle. Becca 
      clocks this: he s not alone. 

                                  BECCA
                    I thought you were just ordering 
                    pizzalast night.

                                  JASON (O.S.)
                    Can you give me a minute?

      Another giggle. Becca rolls her eyes.

      It s then that she turns around and notices:

    THE GALLERY OF FAMILY PHOTOS hanging on the wall: Becca s 
      stiff high school graduation portrait... her perfectly 
      dreadful prom photo from 1986, frosty lipstick and turquoise 
      satin... Jason at 13 in full CB ski regalia...

      ...Her parents  WEDDING PHOTO. 

      Becca stops and stares at the faded young Georgie and 
      Lincoln, goofy smiling flower children.                                                                                    17.


    No evidence of Sabrina and the dolphins anywhere. Confused, 
      Becca pushes through the door into the living room...


      Becca emerges into a wedding war zone. The living room is a 
      wasp s nest of people in full throttle planning mode.

      Suddenly someone sees Becca, and in a blink, all the 
      attention is directed at the bride; she stands with a 
      stricken expression as the sharks surround her, thirsty for 
      blood... she s still not quite believing this is happening 
      because at the center of all of this is 

      GEORGIE

      withher hair in rollers, the HAIRDRESSER trying to pin 
      Georgie s last few locks into place. In walks Lincoln.

                                  LINCOLN
                    Where are my car keys?

                                  GEORGIE
                    Link, where are you going?

                                  LINCOLN
                    Tennis!
                          (off Georgie s horrified 
                          face)
                    Kidding! I m picking up Sophie at 
                    the train station! I ll be back in 
                    twenty minutes! 
                          (re: the hair rollers)
                    You look adorable. I love this look 
                    for you.

    He grabs her chin and kisses her.

    ON BECCA: as she stares at her parents, baffled. 

                                  BECCA
                    Mom? What are you...? What s going 
                    on?

      Georgie turns to Becca: 

                                  GEORGIE
                    For God s sake, have you not taken 
                    your shower? I m having a heart 
                    attack. 


      Becca pinches herself on both arms:                                                                                    18.


                                  BECCA
                    Wake up. WAKE UP.

    She thinks a moment, then throws open the door to Jason s 
      room and sees him standing alone and naked in the middle of 
    the room. He crosses his hands over his crotch, horrified...

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    There was a girl in here.

                                  JASON
                    God! Can you not just barge in 
                    here?

      Becca throws back the sheets. The bed is empty. The bathroom 
    is empty too. Whoever was here is gone. 

      Jason throws on some clothes while she noses around his room 
      like the Secret Police, clocking the VHStapes, a Nirvana 
      poster, an clunky old cordless phone, an AiwaWalkman, a boxy
    old Macintosh IIewith the flying toaster screen saver...

                                  BECCA
                    ...Flying toasters?

      Becca whirls around to Jason. 

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    This may sound crazy, but I m 
                    having a very vivid dream that it s 
                    1998 and I m marrying Sean today. I 
                    need to wake up. 

                                  JASON
                    Um... okay. 
                          (beat)
                    But it is 1998 and you are marrying 
                    Sean today.

      Becca looks back at the flying toasters and rushes to --


    She rushes to her room and picks up the ALBUM, flipping 
      through it frantically. We catch glimpses of photos, 
      including the photo of Lolly, Sean and Becca at the dive bar 
    on Halloween. 

    And then... blank pages. Page after page of... nothing. 

                                  BECCA
                    Oh, my God. Where did my life go?

      TITLE UP: HINDSIGHT                                                                                    19.


                                        ACT TWO

      ANGLE ON: A HAND POUNDING URGENTLY ON A DOOR.

                                  BECCA
                    It s Becca! Open up! I have to talk 
                    to you! 


    The door creaks open. Here s LOLLY WARD, 25 going on 16, in 
    her 90210 pajamas with a hilarious case of bed head. She s 
    the girl from all the pictures, and she grins at Becca, who 
    is in a Michigan hoodieand carrying a Pradabackpack.

                                  LOLLY
                    The beautiful bride! I thought we 
                    were meeting at the hairdresser. 
                    Did you forget something? You 
                    could ve just called me. Although I 
                    have no idea where the phone is. 
                    How are you? Do you need coffee? I 
                    need coffee. 

      Becca touches Lolly s face, like she s seen a ghost.

                                  BECCA
                    It s really you. You re here. We re 
                    friends.

                                  LOLLY
                          (weirdedout)
                    Of course we re friends. Is there 
                    something on my face? 

                                  BECCA
                    No...I mjust...
                          (tearful)
                    ...sohappy to see you.

      Becca hugs Lolly, who looks confused. Becca s normally not 
      touchy-feely. 

                                  LOLLY
                    Are you okay? You should eat 
                    something maybe. It s been months 
                    since you ve eaten. I think there 
                    are English muffins, unless you 
                    packed them. What am I going to do 
                    without you? Buy my own English 
                    muffins? Forget it. I ll just 
                    starve to death. But whatever, go 
                    be happy, I ll just live here alone 
                    like a savage.                                                                                    20.


      Lolly pads back into the apartment. It s very post-grad. 
      Boxes of Becca s stuff are stacked by the door. Becca takes 
    in the achingly familiar surroundings as Lolly flops onto the 
      couch, clicks on the TV. Richard Simmons, bouncing around.

                                  LOLLY (CONT D)
                    God, I m so out of shape. I have to 
                    go back to Cardiofunk. Oh, before I 
                    forget: Simon called. He wants you 
                    to come into the office today. I 
                    reminded him it was your wedding 
                    day, and he was like,  darling, you 
                    are the kind of person who will 
                    never understand the concept of 
                      responsibility.  What a prince.

      Lolly flips past a few more stations. We see a quick flashof 
    the faces of Monica Lewinskyand Linda Trippon the news. 

                                  BECCA
                    Lolly... there s something I have 
                    to talk to you about.

      Lolly hears gravitas in Becca s voice. She looks up. 

                                  LOLLY
                    Oh my God. Did you get your period? 
                    On your wedding day? Did you take 
                    muscle relaxers like Ginnyin 
                    Sixteen Candles and now you feel 
                    like you ve got cotton balls for 
                    brains? Because that also happened 
                    to a cousin of mine, like how did 
                    she not learn the most important 
                    lesson of that movie...?

                                  BECCA
                    Lolly. I did not take any muscle 
                    relaxers and that was not the most 
                    important lesson of that movie. 
                    Please. 
                          (holding out her arm)
                    Pinch me. Hard.

      Lolly, suspicious, pinches Becca. Hard.

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    Ow!

                                  LOLLY
                    You said pinch you!

      Becca leaps up and starts to pace, wild-eyed.                                                                                    21.


                                  BECCA
                    I know! And I felt it! So then I 
                    can t be dreaming. Which means that 
                    everything that s already happened 
                    to me... my whole life... is just 
                    gone. Poof. 

      Lolly struggles to decode her... Eureka, she s got it:

                                  LOLLY
                    You re having second thoughts. 

                                  BECCA
                    Yes.

                                  LOLLY
                    You think your identity will 
                    disappear once you re married. Your 
                    identity will change forever and 
                    your life as Becca Bracywill fade 
                    into oblivion.

                                  BECCA
                    No. Lolly, listen...

                                  LOLLY
                          (on a roll)
                    ...And you re finally starting to 
                    crack under the pressure of 
                    everyone being like,  why are they 
                    getting married so young?  Because 
                    you re in love, duh! Your parents 
                    should understand that better than 
                    anyone. They were super young when 
                    they got married and look how happy 
                    they are. 

      This lands on Becca... knowing how not happy they are.

                                  BECCA
                    Lolly, stop talking and listen. 
                    When I woke up this morning, I 
                    thought I was about to get married 
                    to another man.

      Lolly s eyes go wide.

                                  LOLLY
                    Oooh. That s so Freudian. Like, 
                      Interpretation of Dreams Freud, not 
                    Beyond the Pleasure Principle 
                    Freud. Obviously. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    22.

                                  LOLLY (CONT'D)
                      A subconscious desire to marry 
                    someone else on the eve of your 
                    wedding. It s like... otherpenis 
                    envy. Who was it?

                                  BECCA
                    Andy Kelly.

      Lolly stares at her, waiting for the punch line.

                                  LOLLY
                    Ew. He s practically your cousin. 

                                  BECCA
                    We are notcousins! Our parents are 
                    just very good friends!

                                  LOLLY
                    But we just set him up with what s- 
                    her-name. That temp from your 
                    office. Melissa? Marissa? 
                          (finding it)
                    Melanie.

                                  BECCA
                    Look, you re not getting it. I 
                    didn t dream it. It was all really 
                    happening. I was 39. I was marrying 
                    Andy Kelly. Non-blood-relation, 
                    super nice Andy Kelly. I know he 
                    used to be dorkybut he got cute. 
                    Like Patrick Dempsey. But then I 
                    blacked out.
                          (reliving it)
                    ...I woke up in my bed and the last 
                    fifteen years had disappeared. And 
                    now I m here. With you. And I know 
                      something s wrong because you re 
                    acting like nothing s wrong and 
                    yet... we haven t spoken in eight 
                    years.

      A beat. Lolly looks stricken.

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    I know how this sounds, but there s 
                    no other explanation. I am here 
                    from the future. 

    Off Lolly s totally bewildered expression, we...                                                                                    23.



      Lolly stands glued to the wall as Becca tears through the 
      apartment, opening drawers, looking for some evidence of the 
      future that hasn t happened yet.

                                  LOLLY
                    I m a little concerned. I think I 
                    should call your mom.

                                  BECCA
                    No! Please don t... We need to 
                    figure out what s going on. 

    She pulls down a Yellow Pages from on top of the fridge - 
       Keep until October 1999.  

                                  LOLLY
                     We?  I think this is your game, 
                    McFly.

                                  BECCA
                    This is not a game. Come on. Think 
                    about it! I m the most rational 
                    person you know! Why would I be 
                    saying this if it weren t true? 
                          (off Lolly s blank look)
                    Say something. Say anything...

                                  LOLLY
                    Oh my God, Say Anything was such a 
                    good movie.

                                  BECCA
                    I know. It totally holds up. 
                          (remembering suddenly)
                    You just got over the clap, didn t 
                    you? 

      Lolly pulls back, offended.  

                                  LOLLY
                    Excuseme?

                                  BECCA
                    You got it from some guy you met at
                    Benetton! He had three earrings in 
                    one ear! You never told me about 
                    him until after the fact because 
                    you slept with my... oh my God! You 
                    slept with my brother! Last night! 
                    The night before my wedding to 
                    Sean! It justhappened! That was 
                    you in the bed this morning!                                                                                    24.


      Lolly turns scarlet.

                                  LOLLY
                    And it s going to go on for months 
                    and in the end it s going to be a 
                    disaster! You re going to break his 
                    heart, not to mention give him 
                    gonorrhea! It was incredibly hard 
                    on him, and you were just like...
                          (remembering)
                    You didn t treat him very well. 

      Lolly s freaked out now. She starts to put together a hasty 
      exit strategy: cardigan, keys, scrunchie.

                                  LOLLY (CONT D)
                    You know what? I m just gonna go.

                                  BECCA
                    Don t. I really don t want to 
                    fight. 
                          (voice breaking)
                    I don t ever want to lose you 
                    again.

                                  LOLLY
                          (weirdedout)
                    Don t be such a drama queen. You re 
                    not going to lose me. I m just 
                    going to go pick up my dress at the 
                    tailor while you take a nap or a 
                    siesta or something and work 
                    through this... situation.

      Becca resigns herself as Lolly is halfway out the door. 

                                  BECCA
                    You re right. I know you re right. 
                          (then:)
                    I think I should go talk to Sean.

                                  LOLLY
                    Isn t that bad luck? You spent last 
                    night apart because you were too 
                      superstitious.

                                  BECCA
                    I think I have to take that risk.

                                  LOLLY
                    What are you going to wear? That? 
                    Not that.                                                                                    25.


                                  BECCA
                    I don t know. 
                          (trying to sound calm)
                    Will you come meet me later at the 
                    coffee shop?

      Lolly gives Becca an encouraging but cautious arm squeeze.

                                  LOLLY
                    Okay. But promise me: no Valium. 
                          (solemnly)
                    Remember Sixteen Candles.

                                  BECCA
                    Okay.

      Lolly leaves.


      Becca opens her old closet to find something to wear and 
      almost cries when she realizes the size 2 jeans fit her 
      again. To the beat of Beck s  Loser,  We see a quick MONTAGE 
    of Becca trying on all the clothes in her closet, delighted 
      that everything fits, though slightly horrified by some of 
    the fashion bloopers (e.g. flannelcowboy shirts, motorcycle 
      boots, baby doll dresses over mini-tees, wide-legged sheer 
      floral lounge pants over bodysuits, cable-knit sweaters 
      cropped to child size...). She pulls out a denim mini skirt 
      with a frayed hem, checks the label. 

                                  BECCA
                    Size two...!

    She pulls it on and it fits. Now the tears come. Size two!


      Becca s taxi rolls up to a warehouse studio in the heart of 
    the as-yet-undeveloped meat-packing district. From inside the 
      cab, she sees him sitting on the industrial metal steps, 
      wearing his paint-spattered jeans, worn out work boots, and a 
      well-loved, threadbare flannel shirt. 

      Becca gets out of the cab. It pulls away, leaving her staring 
    at SEAN, whom we recognize from the photos. He s in paint-
      spattered jeans and a t-shirt, shooting the breeze with some 
      rough-looking Con-Ed guys. 

    He glances over, doesn t immediately notice her, but then 
      does a double-take as she catches his eye. He walks over to 
      her, looking not unhappy but a little puzzled...                                                                                    26.


                                  SEAN
                    I thought we weren t seeing each 
                    other today.

                                  BECCA
                    I changed my mind. I had to see 
                    you.

      After a beat: he grins. And just like that, it s like the 
      first time they met  - that smile, that stomach flip -

                                  SEAN
                    Wanna come up?


      A sunny, cavernous space; sparse, hippie-chic furnishings and 
      lots of books. Huge canvases lean against the walls. Tucked 
      behind a screen, an unmade bed. 

                                  SEAN
                    Hi. 

                                  BECCA
                    Hi.

      Becca just looks at him for a moment, appraising him, 
      remembering how beautiful he was. Is. Whatever. Their 
      chemistry is overpowering. He grabs her, kisses her, and they 
      fall into the unmade bed. He briefly comes up for air -- 

                                  SEAN
                    I m not complaining, but isn t it 
                    bad luck for us to see each other 
                    today?

    But she s past that and starts ripping his clothes off. 

                                  BECCA
                      Shhhhhh...pleasestop talking.


      Breathless, post-amazing-sex, Sean and Becca lie on the bed, 
      both looking a little surprised at what just happened. 

                                  BECCA
                    Oh my God. That was so good.

                        SEANBECCA
        (mock boasting)(thinking of Andy)
      I should really teach a All these years, I was so 
      seminar.sure I was just... 
                                                    embellishing.                                                                                      27.


      A beat.

                                  SEAN
                    All what years?

                                  BECCA
                          (lost in thought)
                    There s just no comparison. It s 
                    like a ride on a Cessnaversus 
                    going up in the Space Shuttle.

                                  SEAN
                    Am I the Cessnaor the Space 
                    Shuttle? They both sound awesome. 

    She looks at him again. Now that she s not blinded by sexual 
      desire, she s seeing him through clear eyes. Maybe too clear.

                                  BECCA
                      I shouldn t have done that. 

    She gets up, hastily starts putting her clothes back on.

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    What happens if I wake up tomorrow 
                    and I m back? How do I explain 
                    myself? Does this even count? 

                                  SEAN
                    Becca... what are you talking 
                    about? Explain yourself to who? 
                          (really worried)
                    Is there someone else?

                                  BECCA
                    No. 
                          (pointedly)
                    I was always faithful to you. 

                                  SEAN
                          (face darkening)
                    Becca, it s our wedding day. Can we 
                    please not bring that up...? 

                                  BECCA
                    This isn t about that. It s about 
                    me. 
                          (remembering Jason s 
                          words)
                    I m regrouping.

      Sean waits a beat.                                                                                    28.


                                  SEAN
                    That sounds ominous. 
                          (forced levity)
                    Are we still getting married?

      Becca doesn t say anything.

                                  SEAN (CONT D)
                    That was a joke. I m joking! We re 
                    still getting married.
                          (panicking)
                    Right? 

      Dressed now, she heads for the door. Has to get out of here. 

                                  SEAN (CONT D)
                    I don t get it. Yesterday you were 
                    super psyched for this.

    He leaps out of bed, naked, following her to the door...

                                  BECCA
                    Yesterday was a long time ago.
                          (carefully)
                    I love you. I ve always loved you. 
                    But what if getting married sets us 
                    both off course? 

                                  SEAN
                          (starting to fume)
                    You can only choose one thing. So  
                    every decision you make sets you 
                    off course. It s a universal law. 

                                  BECCA
                    Is it?

                                  SEAN
                    Are we really going to get into a 
                    debate on existentialism right now?

                                  BECCA
                    I need some time to think, Sean.

                                  SEAN
                    Whatever. Fine. Go... think. 

    She wants to kiss him, but he closes the door.

                                                                      END ACT TWO.                                                                                    29.


                                      ACT THREE


      Becca lets herself into her parents  apartment and finds 
      Lincoln in the kitchen, eating ice cream. He freezes when he 
      sees her: caught in the act.

                                  LINCOLN
                          (re: ice cream)
                    Don t tell your mother.

                                  BECCA
                    I don t know if I can marry Sean.

    Her face crumples up. He gives her his patented sympathetic 
    dad look, and she bursts into tears. Lincoln puts down the 
    ice cream and envelops her in a daddy hug.

                                  LINCOLN
                    Becks, it s okay. Whatever you want 
                    to do is fine. But... did something 
                    happen?

      Becca tries to pull herself together. Hiccuping --

                                  BECCA
                    I look into the future and all I 
                    can see are a series of crossroads 
                    where I make the wrong decision. 

                                  LINCOLN
                    But Becca... your future is so 
                    bright. So full of possibility. I d 
                    give anything to be 25 again.

                                  BECCA
                    I wouldn t be so sure of that.

    He puts a hand on her teary cheek.

                                  LINCOLN
                    You know what I wish you could see?

                                  BECCA
                    What?

                                  LINCOLN
                    Your face, when Sean walks into the 
                    room. Reminds me of when you were a 
                    baby, the first time you turned on 
                    a light switch. Like you couldn t 
                    believe your luck. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    30.

                                  LINCOLN (CONT'D)
                    That s magic, kid. You don t find 
                    that twice in your life.

    On Becca...

                                  GEORGIE (O.C.)
                    Becca! There you are! Where have 
                    you been? 

      Lincoln and Becca whirl around to see Georgie, hair and 
      makeup done, wearing a robe. 

                                  GEORGIE (CONT D)
                    I was calling your apartment, 
                    calling your office... Link! Were 
                    you eating ice cream? 

                        LINCOLNGEORGIE
          (guiltily)(inspecting Becca)
      I was just looking at it.Are you crying?

                                  BECCA
                          (yes)
                    No. Maybe. 
                          (frantic)
                    I m feeling very exposed and 
                    emotional and like my nerves are 
                    totally shot.

                                  GEORGIE
                    Your nerves? Look at your eyes! 
                    They re puffy! I m getting the 
                      Preparation-H.

                                  BECCA
                    No! Mom! You are not putting 
                    hemorrhoid cream on my face! 

                                  LINCOLN
                    She might just be hungry. She 
                    hasn t eaten in six months.

      Lincoln holds out a bag of pretzels to Becca.

                                  LINCOLN (CONT D)
                    Here you go, baby.

                                  GEORGIE
                    So help me God, Lincoln, if you 
                    give that girl so much as one 
                    pretzel, we are getting a divorce! 
                    You know how she bloats!                                                                                    31.


      Becca erupts in a fresh torrent of tears and runs out. 
      Lincoln and Georgie look at each other, puzzled.


      Georgie follows Becca into her bedroom and closes the door.

                                  GEORGIE
                    I m sorry, darling. That was 
                      thoughtless of me. We ve all just 
                    been so careful for months about 
                    the salt and the trans fats --

                                  BECCA
                          (cutting her off)
                    Are you happy in your marriage?

                                  GEORGIE
                          (taken aback)
                    Am I happy in mymarriage? What are 
                    you talking about?

                                  BECCA
                    Do you still love Dad? Yes or no?

                                  GEORGIE
                    He s my best friend, Becca. Of 
                    course I love him. What do you want 
                    me to say? Are you having second 
                    thoughts? Because I ve got 200 
                    guests arriving in a few hours and 
                    we re spending more on the raw bar 
                    than I spent on your college 
                    tuition.

                                  BECCA
                    Hey, Mussolini, there are more 
                    important things to worry about 
                    today than shellfish.

                                  GEORGIE
                    Oh, so now I m a ruthless dictator? 
                    I thought you loved oysters.

                                  BECCA
                    I do love oysters. 
                          (remembering a favorite 
                          old joke)
                    You know what they say about the 
                    first man who ate an oyster.

                                  GEORGIE AND BECCA
                    He must have been really hungry.                                                                                    32.


      They both smile at the familiar punch line.

                                  BECCA
                    Oh, God, Mom... I m so sorry about 
                    all of this.

    On Georgie, searching Becca s face:

                                  GEORGIE
                    Rebecca, am I calling off this 
                    wedding?

      Suddenly the door swings open. It s Jason. He stares at his 
      mother, stares at Becca. Trying to assess the situation. 
      Becca can t speak. Just looks at Georgie, then at the floor.

                                  GEORGIE (CONT D)
                    I m going to take your lack of 
                    response as a no.

      Georgie leaves. Jason looks back to Becca.

                                  JASON
                    Can I talk to you for a sec?


      Jason and Becca hide out in the bathroom.

                                  BECCA
                    Remember when this was our 
                    clubhouse?

                                  JASON
                    Yeah. You were the club president 
                    and I was the minority whip. 
                          (hesitating)
                    So... I just talked to Lolly.

                                  BECCA
                    What dshe have to say?

                                  JASON
                    Among other things, she thinks 
                    you re having a nervous breakdown.

                                  BECCA
                    I m not having a nervous breakdown. 
                    I m just conflicted. I don t know 
                    who I am and I don t know what to 
                    do. I m totally paralyzed with 
                    indecision and I feel like I m 
                    having an out-of-body experience.
                          (realizing)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    33.

                                  BECCA (CONT'D)
                    Oh, God. That sounds like a nervous 
                    breakdown, doesn t it.

                                  JASON
                    It sounds like you re trying to get 
                    control of your own life by trying 
                    to control everyone else.

                                  BECCA
                          (realizing)
                    Did Lolly break things off with 
                    you? 

                                  JASON
                     Things ? There s no thing.

                                  BECCA
                    I know you slept with her last 
                    night so you don t have to play 
                    dumb. Was ending it her idea or 
                    yours?

                                  JASON
                    I don t know what you re talking 
                    about.

                                  BECCA
                    What exactly did she say to you? 
                    It s absolutely crucial that you 
                    recount the conversation verbatim.

                                  JASON
                          (relenting)
                    She called and said it was fun but 
                    it couldn t ever happen again. 
                    Something about not wanting to hurt 
                    me in the end? I don t know, I 
                    don t speak that language.

      Becca s face lights up. She tumbles out of the tub.

                                  BECCA
                    She believes me. She really 
                    believes me. 
                          (relieved)
                    Thank you.

                                  JASON
                          (sarcastic)
                    No, thank you, Becca.                                                                                    34.



      Lolly is sitting at their regular table, staring out the 
      window, looking preoccupied. Becca slips into the booth.

                                  BECCA
                    Hi.

                                  LOLLY
                    Hi. 

    The waitress, recognizing them, serves them their regular 
      drink order: two Diet Cokes and a bowl of bagel chips.

                                  LOLLY (CONT D)
                    I went over and over it in my mind, 
                    and there s just no way you would 
                    know about the guy from Benetton, 
                    unless I got drunk and told you, 
                    and you can t drink when you re on 
                    Tetracycline. God, I m so 
                    embarrassed.

                                  BECCA
                    It s okay. VD is the new black.

                                  LOLLY
                    What?

                                  BECCA
                    Nothing. Sorry. You were saying...

                                  LOLLY
                    The only thing I m sure of is that 
                    you re not the same Becca you were 
                    yesterday. 

                                  BECCA
                    Because I m not. Do you believe me? 
                    If you broke things off with Jason, 
                    you must think there s a shred of 
                    truth to what I m saying...

                                  LOLLY
                    Just tell me. Tell me everything. 

      Becca takes a deep breath.

                                  BECCA
                    Okay. It was 2012. My parents had 
                    been divorced for a few years...                                                                                    35.


                                  LOLLY
                    Wait, yourparents? But they were 
                    such a cute couple! I wanted to be 
                    them when I grew up! You know what 
                    I mean. Part of a couple like that. 
                    Me and Hugh Grant. Please tell me 
                    that Hugh Grant is my husband 
                    because that s what gets me out of 
                    bed in the morning and I am not 
                    even exaggerating.

      Becca ruefully shakes her head No. Lolly sighs sadly.

                                  LOLLY (CONT D)
                    Sorry. You were saying. 

                                  BECCA
                    She said the fire was gone and she 
                    and my dad were like brother and 
                    sister, they never had sex anymore 
                    and she needed to live her life 
                    before there were no more chapters. 

                                  LOLLY
                    God, that s sad. I feel so sad for 
                    her.

                                  BECCA
                    I wasn t sad. I was just pissed. I 
                    said some horrible things. So I m 
                    sad about that. 

      Lolly absorbs this, then asks the burning question:

                                  LOLLY
                    What about Jason?

                                  BECCA
                    He d been in and out of rehab. And 
                    jail. It s been a tough couple of 
                    years for my family. And there was 
                    no one in the world I needed to 
                    talk to more than you. But we 
                    hadn t spoken in years. The phone 
                    number I had for you was out of 
                    service and I don t know where you 
                    live and the only emailI have for 
                    you is AOL.

      Lolly is near tears.                                                                                     36.


                                  LOLLY
                    That s awful. All of it sounds 
                    awful. Do people not use AOL
                    anymore? 

                                  BECCA
                    It s become unfashionable.

                                  LOLLY
                    But I really love AOL. 

      Becca reaches for Lolly s hand. 

                                  BECCA
                    I know. AOLloved you too.

      Lolly withdraws her hand to swipe away an escaped tear. 
      Changes the subject.

                                  LOLLY
                    Obviously you quit working for 
                    Simon, right? He s such a third 
                    rate excuse for a producer. What s 
                    your career like? Amazing, right? 
                    Did you ever move to London? You 
                    were going to become the producer 
                    in residence at the Globe! That s 
                    how I was going to meet my husband, 
                    Hugh Grant. 

                                  BECCA
                    Uh, no. I was still here in New 
                    York. Same apartment. Working for 
                    Simon. 

                                  LOLLY
                    Still?

      Becca doesn t love the disappointment in Lolly s voice.

                                  BECCA
                    I made a lot of good connections.
                          (rueful)
                    I even had an interview once with 
                    Lydia Stone.

                                  LOLLY
                    Ooooh. She s a powerhouse.

                                  BECCA
                    But I blew it. I was late and 
                    exhausted because Sean and I had 
                    been up all night fighting and... 
                    it was stupid. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    37.

                                  BECCA (CONT'D)
                    I never really became much of 
                    anything. At the end of the day... 
                    well, he promoted me a bunch of 
                    times, but I was just a very well-
                    educated secretary. 

                                  LOLLY
                    And Andy Kelly?

                                  BECCA
                          (remembering)
                    We were always such good friends. 
                    And then we were both single and 
                    just started hanging out and he s a 
                    big foreign film buff, so... 

                        LOLLYBECCA
            (unimpressed)...we saw a lot of movies at 
      That sounds really romantic.the Angelika.

                                  LOLLY
                          (cutting to the chase)
                    Were you in love with him?

                                  BECCA
                    I don t know. I loved him. Is that 
                    different? 

                                  LOLLY
                    No one has ever been able to 
                    explain that to me.

                                  BECCA
                    Honestly, I was happy. I thought I 
                    had everything. Coke Zero. TiVo. 
                    This Brazilian hair straightening 
                    system that was completely beyond 
                    belief. 
                          (beat)
                    But I didn t have you. 

      A beat.

                                  LOLLY
                    What happened to us, Becca?

                                  BECCA
                    Sean was cheating. And you knew. 
                    And you didn t tell me. 

      Lolly is shocked.                                                                                    38.


                                  LOLLY
                    But I would never do that. I m your 
                    best friend. Why would I do that? 
                    Becca, I m so sorry...

                                  BECCA
                    No. Don t apologize. It hasn t 
                    happened yet. 

                                  LOLLY
                    Well, nothing has. Right?

                                  BECCA
                    Right. 
                          (sheepish)
                    Except that I had sex with Sean 
                    today. 

                                  LOLLY
                    You had sex with Sean? Today? 
                    Jesus, how early did you wake up?

                                  BECCA
                    Early. 

                                  LOLLY
                    And...?

                                  BECCA
                    And now I cheated with my ex-
                    husband who I haven t married yet 
                    on the day I m supposed to marry a 
                    guy I haven t started dating yet. 
                    I m so confused. What do I do now?

      Lolly reaches across the table and grabs Becca s hand.

                                  LOLLY
                    This isn t just happening to you, 
                    Becca. It s happening to me and to 
                    Sean and to everyone. And maybe 
                    this is happening so that we can 
                    allget a second chance. Things are 
                    already changing from how you 
                    remember them, right? 

                                  BECCA
                          (realizing it s true)
                    It s so scary. What if I end up 
                    someplace completely different?

                                  LOLLY
                    You re already someplace completely 
                    different. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    39.

                                  LOLLY (CONT'D)
                          (raising an eyebrow)
                    Patrick Dempsey gets cute? Really?

                                  BECCA
                    No one was more surprised than me.

      Becca s backpack starts to vibrate. She pulls out a PAGER. 

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    I forget how this works.

      Lolly takes it and shows her where the message is.

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    Sean. Wants me to come meet him.

                                  LOLLY
                    Go.

                                                                  END ACT THREE.                                                                                    40.


                                          ACT FOUR


    We find Becca at one of her favorite places: the little park 
      near her apartment. It s shaggy but charming: a quiet oasis 
    in the middle of the city. She looks up and sees Sean, in his 
      tuxedo, the tie undone, looking rakish and handsome and 
      totally freaked out. He s holding a white paper bag.

                                  SEAN
                          (nervously)
                    Thanks for coming to meet me.

                                  BECCA
                    Sean...

                                  SEAN
                          (cutting her off)
                    Before you say anything, let me get 
                    this out. 

    He drops down to one knee. 

                                  SEAN (CONT D)
                    Becca, when I met you, I was lost. 
                    I didn t know who I wanted to be or 
                    what I was supposed to do with my 
                    life. But you wanted to be with me, 
                    so I thought -- if someone that 
                    great and that beautiful and that 
                    smart wants to be with me, then I 
                    must be an okay guy. But I don t 
                    want to be just an okay guy. I want 
                    to be a better guy. You make me 
                    want to be a better guy. So I m 
                    asking you again: will you marry 
                    me?

                                  BECCA
                    You re saying everything I want to 
                    hear, but...

                                  SEAN
                    Tell me what it is you re worried 
                    about. You at least owe me that.

                                  BECCA
                    I m worried we re destined to make 
                    the same mistakes over and over 
                    again, no matter what promises we 
                    make to each other today.                                                                                     41.


                                  SEAN
                    Listen... it was my destiny to meet 
                    and fall in love with you, and I 
                    don t want to change that. I would 
                    gladly fall in love with you, and 
                    go through all the good and bad 
                    times, over and over again. I want 
                    you to trust that I mean what I m 
                    saying. I want to make it 
                    impossiblefor you not to trust me. 
                    Starting today.

    He flashes her that smile. Her stomach flips.

                                  SEAN (CONT D)
                    You don t have to answer me now. I 
                    just want you to know I m going to 
                    be at the church, and I hope I ll 
                    see you there. 

    He reaches into a bag and hands her a Shamrock Shake.

                                  SEAN (CONT D)
                    I know your mother made you swear 
                    off dairy until after the wedding, 
                    but I figured... you ve come this 
                    far.

    She takes it, looks at it, takes a sip.

                                  BECCA
                    This is also just as good as I 
                      remembered.

    He grabs her and hugs her. Over his shoulder, we see her face 
    as she melts into him. Etched with longing and confusion.

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    You were the Space Shuttle.

    He lets go. Gives her one more look before he turns to go. 
    She watches him walk away, her face a labyrinth of emotions. 

    ON BECCA as we see a MONTAGE of memories as they POP through 
    her head:


      Sean and Becca in bed on a Sunday morning with the paper;


      Sean coming home with a squirming puppy under each arm;                                                                                    42.



      Becca and Lolly screaming and ducking for cover as the top 
      flies off the blender while Sean blends margaritas. Blink and 
      you ll miss it as Sean hip-checks Lolly.


      Sean and Becca bundled in winter coats building a demented-
      looking snowman in her favorite park when Sean spontaneously 
      drops to his knee and proposes to her (the first time)...


      Resume on Becca, staring at the spot where he s now proposed 
    to her... twice. She stares at a clock on the bank across the 
      street. It s now 4:30pm.


      A younger Vincent (the doorman) waves to Becca as she rushes 
      across the lobby towards the regular elevators.

                                  VINCENT
                      Congratulations, Becky! Big day!

      Becca stops and stares at him for a moment. Half-smiles.

                                  BECCA
                    Thanks, Vincent.

    Off her conflicted face...


      Becca emerges from the shower, pulls on a robe, and wipes 
      away the condensation from the mirror. In the reflection, we 
      see...

    The old wedding gown, hanging on the armoire.

      A KNOCK on the door. Georgie. Dressed and ready. 

      Becca opens the door and lets her in.

      Georgie gives Becca a box, which Becca opens. It s an antique 
      sapphire bracelet. 

                                  GEORGIE
                    Old, blue and borrowed, although 
                    you can keep it. 

      Georgie shows Becca how to unhook the delicate clasp.                                                                                    43.


                                  GEORGIE (CONT D)
                    Your dad gave it to me the day you 
                    were born. Sapphire for my 
                    September baby. 

    On Becca, deeply moved by the gift but also perplexed: 

                                  BECCA
                    You never gave me this before.

                                  GEORGIE
                          (confused)
                    Before when? 

                                  BECCA
                          (elusive)
                    Nothing. I mean I ve never seen it 
                    before. 
                          (voice catching)
                    It s a beautiful bracelet.

      Georgie puts the bracelet on. 

                                  GEORGIE
                    I know you think I meddle too much, 
                    but I really just wanted everything 
                    in your life to be perfect. 

                                  BECCA
                    Mom... maybe there s no such thing 
                    as a perfect life. And even if 
                    there were, I m not sure I want 
                    one. 

      Georgie lets this sink in.

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    Maybe if you strive too hard for 
                      perfection, you miss everything. 
                    All those moments in between. And 
                    for what? A gold medal at the 
                    finish line?

      ANGLE ON: the bracelet, as Georgie holds Becca s hand and 
      gently adjusts it so that it lays flat: a tangible 
      representation of how things are already different and how 
    the future holds infinite unknowns...

                                  GEORGIE
                    Well, then, find those moments and 
                    appreciate them, and you ll have a 
                    beautiful marriage. 

      Georgie kisses her on the forehead.                                                                                    44.


    The fierce gay male WEDDING COORDINATOR (#2) bursts in. 
      Seeing Becca in her slip:

                                  WEDDING COORDINATOR #2
                          (horrified)
                    She s not dressed?

                                  GEORGIE
                    Give her a minute. She ll be ready. 
                          (getting it, finally)
                    It s just a dress.

      Suddenly everyone s in a panic around Becca. From Becca s 
      point of view, the noise fades away as she and her mother 
      share a private smile.

                                                                    END ACT FOUR.                                                                                    45.


                                          ACT FIVE


      ANGLE ON: a small white card with Georgie s debutante script: 
    To Becca on her wedding day. Wishing you luck and love, Mom.

      PULL BACK to see Becca taping it into her photo album. She s 
    now in her wedding dress.

    In the doorway, we see Lolly, in her mint bridesmaid s dress, 
      watching Becca, searching Becca s face. Becca smiles.

                                  BECCA
                    Boy, am I glad to see you.

                                  LOLLY
                    You look beautiful. 

                                  BECCA
                    There really is something about 
                    this dress, isn t there? It s just 
                    so... bridal. 

      Lolly hands her an Irish sixpence.

                                  LOLLY
                    Put this in your shoe. Luck of the 
                    Irish. Not that I believe in any of 
                    that. But it couldn t hurt. Right?

                                  BECCA
                    Come on, Eileen. 

                                  LOLLY
                    Love that song somuch.

      Lolly smiles at Becca s reflection, holds her shoulders.

                                  LOLLY (CONT D)
                    Whatever happened in the future, 
                    I m sure you can change it and make 
                    it better. I know I couldn t... but 
                    you can.

    On Becca, as this lands:

                                  LOLLY (CONT D)
                    In any case, we gotta get this show 
                    on the road. This bra and I have 
                    another half an hour before I take 
                    it off and burn it.                                                                                     46.



      Guests are all in their seats. We see the look of relief on 
      Sean s face as Becca appears at the church entrance, ready to 
      walk down the aisle with Lincoln. 

      Becca looks down the aisle, sees the guests craning their 
      necks to look for her. 

      Becca sees Lolly fussing over her bouquet and notices Jason 
      staring at her. Lolly looks up and meets Jason s eye, 
      blushing a bit and smiling. Jason smiles back.

      Lincoln appears by Becca s side and holds out his arm.

                                  LINCOLN
                    I m glad you decided to go through 
                    with it. Don t worry -- everyone 
                    freaks out on their wedding day, 
                    one way or another. 

    As she makes her way down the aisle, she catches glimpses of 
      everyone: 

      - Georgie, escorted by Jason, reaching the altar and turning 
    to beam at Lincoln and Becca; 

      - The energetic flower girl tossing petals into people s 
      laps;

      - Lolly standing next to the minister, bouncing with 
      excitement; 

      - Sean, looking handsome and confident;

      - And finally...

      ANDY. 

      Looking younger, with longer, floppier hair. He s sitting 
      with his parents. 

      Becca locks eyes with him. Can t take her eyes off him. 
      Finally, here, at the end of this long, crazy day, her two 
      worlds are colliding. Wheels turn in her head as she 
      remembers...                                                                                    47.



      2010. POV of someone walking through an apartment, tidying 
    up. Stylish upholstered furniture, framed artwork, a vintage 
      lamp, a sleek flat screen TV. A mid-century modern couch and 
      Jonathan Adlerthrow pillows.

      SFX:the front door groans open and then closes again. 

                                  ANDY
                    Becks, you here? God, what a day. 

      Andy drops his keys into the key bowl, checks the mail. 

      Becca is on the couch, typing on her laptop. 

                                  BECCA
                    I was thinking Indian for dinner. 
                    Should we go to Pink Elephant?

    He holds up a bag of Indian takeout from The Pink Elephant 
    and hums the Indiana Jones theme. Off Becca s satisfied look 
    as he leans down to kiss her...


      Resume on the processional. Becca continues to stare at Andy 
    as she notices a PETITE BLONDE sitting next to him... holding 
    his hand. He leans over to whisper something in her ear. 
      Melissa? Marissa? Melanie.

    As Becca reaches the front of the church, Sean watches as 
      Becca climbs the steps to the altar. 

                                  SEAN
                          (whispering)
                    I knew you d come.

      Becca hands her bouquet to Lolly and Sean takes her hands... 
      although he seems unable to meet her eye. He nods to the 
      minister, then turns and scans the room. Looking for... what? 

    ON BECCA: as she tries to catch Sean s eye. She needs 
      something from him. Some connection. A sign. 

                                  MINISTER
                    Friends, Romans, co-op board 
                    members... lend me your ears!

    The guests chuckle.                                                                                    48.


                                  MINISTER (CONT D)
                    We re here today to witness the 
                    marriage of these two fine young 
                    people, Rebecca and Sean. What God 
                    has brought together, let no man 
                    tear asunder. If anyone present may 
                    raise objections to this union, 
                    speak now or forever hold your 
                    peace.

    ON BECCA: as she glances out at the guests, at her parents, 
    at Lolly, at Andy, at Sean, who finally meets her eye. His 
      expression is expectant, hopeful... but scared too.  

                                  MINISTER (CONT D)
                    Rebecca, do you take this man to be 
                    your lawfully wedded husband, in 
                    sickness and in health?

      Becca s desire to go back and do it all over again wrestles 
    for one more moment with her desire to explore the road not 
      taken.

                                  BECCA
                    Um...

    But she can t change Sean. She can t change her parents. She 
      can t change Lolly.

    The only path she can change is her own. 

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    ...No.

    ON BECCA, as she realizes what she s just said...

    She grabs Lolly s hand and the two of them run down the 
      aisle. Becca pauses at Simon s row:

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    You should cancel that temp I 
                    hired. She s gonna be terrible. 

    She pulls Lolly to the exit and they burst out into --


    The two girls push their way through a heavy door into the 
      nearly-empty dive bar we recognize from the teaser. They rush 
      over to the jukebox, giggling uncontrollably, slip in 
      quarters, push some buttons. The opening bass thrum of 
       Groove is in the Heart  comes up as the two best-friends- 
      again start dancing their heads off. And we... 

      SMASH TO BLACK.

                                                                        END PILOT.
