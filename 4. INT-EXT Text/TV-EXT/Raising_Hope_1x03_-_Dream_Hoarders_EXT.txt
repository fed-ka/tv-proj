      Jimmy and Burt stand in front of a greenhouse with two barn
      doors on the front.  The doors are open and the greenhouse 
      is completely full of shit.  You can't even take a step in. 
      There are lawn chairs, second hand furniture, boxes, all
      kinds of various crap.

                                      JIMMY  (V.O.)
                    Your grandma is a hoarder.

      We jump cut through the following action.  Virginia and
      another maid are putting cleaning supplies into the "Knock,
      Knock, Knock" Pacer.  A nicely dressed woman approaches them
      from the house carrying a fax machine.  She offers it up to
      the two of them and they thank her.  

                                      JIMMY (V.O.)
                    One of the only perks of cleaning
                    houses is getting all the crap the
                    rich people no longer want.  

      As the woman goes back to the house, Virginia and the other
      maid start to wrestle over the fax machine.  At one point
      Virginia has the cord wrapped around the other maid's neck.     

                                      JIMMY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    It never bothered your grandmother
                    that she didn't have a use for any
                    of this stuff.  All she knew was it
                    was free and she wanted it.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Virginia puts a fax machine in the back corner of a fairly
      empty greenhouse.  We time dissolve to see the greenhouse
      get more and more full until it becomes the wall of shit we
      saw before.      Raising Hope         1ARY02       "Dream Hoarders"6.

                    The more stuff she brought home, the
                    crazier it seemed.  And the crazier
                    it seemed, the less we talked about
                    it.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


      We pull back to see that Jimmy and Burt are standing in front
      of the greenhouse.  Virginia crosses in holding the lamp
      from the previous scene.  Hope is sitting in the grass.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    What are you guys doing in my stuff? 
                    You didn't touch my stuff did you? 
                    Don't touch my stuff.  That's my
                    stuff.

      Burt backs away from the stuff.

                                    BURT
                    I didn't touch anything.  He opened
                    it.  

      Virginia drags a table over to the wall of shit and then
      stands on it to put the lamp on top.

                                      JIMMY
                    Mom, I need to make a little room in
                    here for Dad's pool chemicals.  Can
                    we maybe pick a few items that you
                    might not need?

                                      VIRGINIA
                    I need everything in here.

                                      JIMMY
                    You need everything in here?  Really?  
                          (picks up a box)
                    You need this box of towel racks? 
                    Because not only have I never seen
                    anyone in this house hang up a towel,
                    but we only have one bathroom.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Now we do.  But we don't know how
                    many bathrooms we're going to have
                    when you father and I get our own
                    place.

                                      JIMMY
                    Do you think you're going to have

                    close with the lottery lately.  Two*

                    week I almost got two.  I think she's

                    Nice.  I'm glad we didn't win last
                    week.  Now we can get a house and a
                    boat.

                                    BURT
                    Oh, I've been thinking about boat
                    names.  How about "Ship Happens"...

                          (off her look)
                    I'll keep thinking.

                    How about you keep thinking about
                    where to put the pool chemicals. 
                    I'm going out to get some baby-
                    proofing stuff.

                    See if the hardware store has sheds
                    on sale.

                                      JIMMY
                    I'm not going to the hardware store. 
                    I'm going to the grocery store.  I
                    think Sabrina's working tonight.

                                    BURT
                    There you go.  Just because she has
                      a boyfriend don't give up.  Girls
                    are just like the lottery.  You can't

      FADE IN:


      Virginia and Burt are looking through the hole in the wall
      of shit.  They can see Hope crawling towards the back of the
      greenhouse.  Virginia hops up.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Quick, help me get this stuff out of
                    here.

      Virginia goes to move an item and everything shifts a little.   

                                    BURT
                    Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Not a good idea.

      Burt looks and sees that Hope is okay.

                          (panicked)
                    This is bad.  This is really bad. 
                    I'm freaking out a little here, Burt. 
                    I'm not doing good with this.  Think
                    of something.  How are we gonna fix
                    this?  Think.  Think. 

                                    BURT
                    You know I can't think on demand
                    like that.  

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Think.

                                    BURT
                    Stop saying think.  Every time you
                    say think all I can think is the
                    word think.  The word just fills up
                    my whole brain.  Think.  Think. 
                    Think.  It keeps changing colors and
                    sizes.  I can't get past it.

      Virginia lays down on the ground on her back.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Alright.  Alright.  I'm getting too
                    antsy.  I need to clear my head. 
                    Relax me.  Do my thing.  

      Burt sits down by her head and starts to very gently rub her
      forehead.  She closes her eyes and starts to calm down a
      little.       Raising Hope         1ARY02       "Dream Hoarders"12.

                    to the baby we need to get it to

      Burt looks at her sheepishly.

                    You're still just thinking of the
                    word think aren't you?

                                    BURT
                    Yeah.  A little guy with a hand pump
                    just came out and pumped up the word
                    until it exploded into a million

                    Jimmy came home but I sent him back

      Burt is sitting near the back corner of the greenhouse where
      we can see Hope is inside playing with a toy.

                    She's cool.  I'm keeping her
                      entertained. 

      Burt puts his mouth against the glass and blows up his face
      like a blow fish.  Virginia holds the box of sugar cubes up
      to the glass.

                    left.  

      Unseen by them, Jimmy comes in the backyard with his box of
      sugar cubes.

                                      JIMMY
                    What's going on?  What are you guys
                    doing?

                                    BURT
                    Um...  

      Burt and Virginia share a look.

                                    BURT (CONT'D)
                    Your baby's trapped in your mother's
                    clutter. 

                                      JIMMY
                    What!?   

      Jimmy starts frantically looking into the sides of the
      greenhouse.

                                      JIMMY (CONT'D)
                    Is she okay?  Can she breathe in
                    there?     

                                      VIRGINIA
                    She's fine.  She doesn't even know
                    she's trapped.  Don't worry.  Your
                    father's gonna suck her out.  

                                    BURT
                    She's in good hands.  Remember how
                      delicately I vacuumed out that dead
                    squirrel from the bottom of the
                      Wasserman's pool last week?  Not a
                    bruise on it.  Little guy coulda had
                    an open casket.      Raising Hope         1ARY02       "Dream Hoarders"16.

      Jimmy looks into the greenhouse and then back to Virginia.

                                      JIMMY
                    What did you... How the hell did
                    this happen?

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Well, you went out for ice cream and
                    then had unprotected sex with a serial
                    killer.

                                      JIMMY
                    No, no, no you can't keep going to
                    that.  I left you guys in charge of
                    Hope and now she's trapped under a
                    giant pile of crap because you're a
                    hoarder.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    I am not a hoarder. 
                          (punches Jimmy)
                    You're only a hoarder if you keep
                    things inside the house.  

      Burt turns the vacuum on.

                                    BURT
                    Jimmy, leave her alone.  I was
                    supposed to be watching her.  I got
                      distracted by the lottery numbers.

                                      JIMMY
                    Oh, well I can see why you couldn't
                    miss that.  I assume you won.

                                    BURT
                    No.  Why would you assume that?  Did
                    you hear something?  Did they do a
                    re-draw or something?  

      We hear the sound of the vacuum latching onto something.

                                    BURT (CONT'D)
                    Got her.

      From inside we see that the hose has latched itself onto the
      back of Hope's diaper.  She's lying on her stomach.  Burt
      starts to slowly pull her towards him and she starts to slide
      backwards.  Jimmy and Virginia rush over to the front where
      Burt continues to pull on the hose.

                                      JIMMY
                    Make sure the suction's not too high. 
                    I don't want to have to explain a
                    hickey on her ass to day care.      Raising Hope         1ARY02       "Dream Hoarders"17.

      Burt continues to pull.  He goes a little faster.

                                    BURT
                    Here she comes.  We're in the home
                    stretch.

      Burt pulls the hose out.  There's only a diaper on the end
      of it.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Great.  Now she's gonna pee on my
                    stuff.

                                      ACT THREE

      FADE IN:


      Jimmy is on the ground looking in the greenhouse.  Burt and
      Virginia stand nearby.

                                    BURT
                    Is she okay?

                                      JIMMY
                    Yeah, I see her.  She's over by an
                    old fur coat someone gave you.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Nobody ever gave me a fur coat.

      They all share a look.  Jimmy bangs on the side of the
      greenhouse and a possum runs out of the clutter and down the
      driveway.

                                      JIMMY
                    This is crazy.  I'm going in.

      Jimmy goes to move something and Burt stops him.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Don't touch that.  If you move the
                    wrong thing it could all come crashing
                    down.    

      They all share a look.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      We hear the song "Istanbul" only this time by They Might Be
      Giants.  Tight on Maw Maw in a shower cap with a very serious
      look on her face.  Her tongue is sticking out like Michael
      Jordan and she bops to the music.  We widen to reveal that
      she's standing in front of the wall of clutter as the others
      anxiously look on.  She's wearing pants and a bra.  She dances
      over to the wall and points to a lawn chair in the middle. 
      Burt removes it.  Nothing moves.  They smile.  We do quick
      time jumps to see Maw Maw dancing to various parts of the
      wall and pointing to various items and eventually they get
      to Hope.  She's free.  Jimmy walks to the house with her. 
      He's not happy.  

                                    BURT
                    You're not even going to thank your
                    great Maw Maw?      Raising Hope         1ARY02       "Dream Hoarders"19.
      1st Rev. Prod Draft  (BLUE)        08-09-10



                                      JIMMY
                    Thanks, Maw Maw.

      Maw Maw gives Jimmy a thumbs up as he exits into the house.    

                                    MAW MAW
                          (to Burt)
                    I like your pants.  Let's trade pants.

      Burt looks at Virginia.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Humor her.  She just saved your
                      grandaughter.

      Burt start to take his pants off.

                                    BURT
                    I hate doing this.  She always leaves
                    tissues and chicken bones in my
                    pockets.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Virginia and two other maids are putting cleaning supplies
      in the "Knock, Knock, Knock" Pacer.  The woman of the house
      crosses to them holding a popcorn maker.  The other maids
      look at Virginia.  She motions for them to take it.  Laquisha
      hands Virginia her clip-on hair extensions to hold and she
      and Guadalupe start to wrestle each other.  Virginia watches
      enviously.

                                      JIMMY (V.O.)
                    And for Grandma it means stepping
                    aside and letting Guadalupe and
                    Laquisha duke it out for a twenty-
                    year-old Hamilton Beach popcorn maker.
