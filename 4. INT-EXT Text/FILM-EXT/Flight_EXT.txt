It's still more night than day as we look down on the HOTEL
ATLANTA. The lit sign for the HOTEL ATLANTA may be the only
source of light as we hear a metallic rattle.
We follow the metallic rattle to a door. The rattling stops
and we watch the knob slowly turn.
Tight on a feminine arm with a tattoo that announces "hope."
We pull back to find that both arms are employed in the
pulling of what looks like a large suitcase.
NICOLE MAGGEN, a beautiful but tired woman, finishes pulling
the suitcase that we now surmise to be a folded-up massage
table out of the motel room. With her bra in one hand and
the rickety table resting against the wall of the exterior
2nd floor hallway of the motel, she assesses her situation.
She digs in her purse, lights a cigarette and continues
digging in her purse. She finds a beat-up candy tin. She
opens it and quickly sorts through a collection of burnt
foils, heroin foils, looking for residue. Nothing.
She now finds and holds up the 100 bucks she just made. She
flips open her cheap phone and makes a call...she thinks
better of it and hangs up.
NICOLE forces the clumsy table into the hatchback of a 1988
Toyota Tercel and slams it shut.
The sun would be rising if the sky wasn't swirling with grey
clouds. We see the American Suites Hotel and recognize it as
a decent commuters' hotel near the airport in Orlando. The
sound of a clock radio breaks the calm of our picture.
WHIP leans against the landing gear of the JACKSON-RIDGEFIELD
88 PASSENGER JET -- He takes a swig from a small bottle of
mouthwash -- gargles, then spits the green foam on the
tarmac. WHIP wipes fatigue from his face as he stashes the
mouthwash in his pocket, then quickly completes his visual
walk around. He looks at the sky again as he steps on to the
jet way ladder. His foot slips, sending his shoe SPLASHING in
to a puddle.
WHIP
Son of a bitch!
Whip shakes the rain out of his shoe as he continues up the
stairs.
NICOLE gets out of her Tercel and slams the door twice before
it closes. She checks the address on her phone and looks up
at the enormous mansion.
NICOLE has her keys out as she hustles for her door. She
looks to find the door slightly open. She pushes it fully
open to see FRAN, the building manager, standing in her
living room holding her camera. He tries to be casual...
21.
FRAN
Where you been Nicole?
She is scared and pissed by his invasion of her space.
NICOLE
Fuck! Fran...get out.
FRAN
You're like a little ghost. I
never know when you're here.
NICOLE
Get the fuck out Fran!
She grabs the full-bodied 35 MM camera from him.
FRAN
As the building manager I have a
legal right to enter an apartment
if I believe the occupant is
unwell. Especially if said
occupant is not current on her
rent.
He takes a slimy step towards her. She steps away.
NICOLE
Fran, please just gimme a minute.
Get out. I have the rent. I will
bring it down to you. Just let me
shower.
FRAN
You could just bring the check down
now, use my shower. I got good
water pressure. You know that...
FRAN leans against the door frame, trying to strike a
seductive pose. NICOLE smiles and holds up her camera.
NICOLE
You're in the perfect light Fran.
(he smiles, preening)
Back up a little...little more.
FRAN steps outside and on to the landing.
The JR-88 finishes its barrel-roll, skimming over suburban
rooftops and trees. A CLOUD-TRAIL of Jet-A SPEWING from its
wings.
As the INVERTED PLANE ROARS overhead the CAMERA PANS to find -
NICOLE
Being rushed out of her apartment on a stretcher. The TWO
PARAMEDICS and Fran (the landlord) instinctively duck as the
jet SCREAMS over.
FRAN
(at the sight of the jet)
Jesus Christ! What the Fuck!?
WHIP's being pulled up a grassy hillside. In the distance
WHIP can see the shattered airplane lying in a crater. Fires
smoulder around the impact zone. Passengers are joined by
first responders as they frantically carry, drag and walk the
injured and the dead from the plane. WHIP sees a fire truck
fly by him, down the grassy slope towards the burning plane.
FADE OUT.
FADE IN:
WHIP'S POV --
LOOKING UP at the sky -- WE SEE black, oily SMOKE billowing
across the shattered church steeple --
WE GLIMPSE PEOPLE rushing past, some are wearing white
flowing robes --
WE HEAR DISTANT SIRENS APPROACHING AND PEOPLE PRAYING --
FADE OUT.
FADE IN:
A LOUD SIREN SCREAMS --
WHIP'S POV --
LOOKING UP at the ceiling of an ambulance --
TWO EMTS are urgently attending to him --
FADE OUT.
FADE IN:
41.
WHIP'S POV -- NIGHT
A halogen overhead light and an air-conditioning vent --
brown-stained acoustic ceiling tiles --
WE HEAR the rhythmic BEEP of a heart monitor --
HARLING stands in the doorway looking in. He sees...
The MORNING NURSE is helping WHIP to stand. HARLING points
his camcorder at WHIP and the NURSE.
HARLING MAYS (O.C.)
If this is gonna turn into a sponge
bath, I'll come back.
NURSE
SIR-
HARLING immediately goes to WHIP and supports him.
48.
WHIP
It's okay, Harling.
HARLING MAYS
That's right honey, I'm on the
list. Harling Mays. Some say they
Harling knew me.
HARLING boxes her out. She steps away.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)
Honey can you hustle us a couple of
daiquiris and a cocktail weenie?
On second thought just bring the
booze. I brought my own weenie.
No reaction as the NURSE collects the trash and towels.
HARLING focuses his camcorder on the NURSE and leaves WHIP in
an unsteady stance. HARLING films her and comments...
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)
She's offended, and she should be.
I'm a pig. And I hate me. That's
what we have in common Nurse
Ratched...we both hate me.
And she's gone. HARLING turns to WHIP.
HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)
Whip? What the fuck my man?
They're sayin', "Sweet Jesus, what
a fuckin' stud that pilot is."
You're a hero, no shit. You will
never pay for another drink in this
life time. There is crazy news
people all over, look at this shit--
HARLING helps WHIP to the window...
From WHIP's window we can see a slew of news vans with signal
towers as well as reporters milling about -- a small zoo.
WHIP is wheeled out of a service exit by an ORDERLY who also
holds the duffle bag of WHIP's stuff around his neck. Whip no
longer wears the eye patch but has a butterfly bandage over
his left eye brow.
HARLING jumps out of his 2001 Cadillac STS and immediately
takes over, grabbing the duffel bag.
WHIP
Thanks Mike.
The ORDERLY tries to hand WHIP a medical file. HARLING
snatches it.
HARLING MAYS
Yeah, thanks Mike.
(Harling tips him)
Here's 20 American.
ORDERLY MIKE
Thanks. Good luck, sir.
HARLING hugs WHIP who hangs on tight. The ORDERLY spins the
chair around and heads back inside.
HARLING uses his key fob to remotely pop the trunk and stow
Whip's duffel.
61.
HARLING MAYS
This is how they get the Stones out
of Madison Square Garden, man. 4
smoked black limos fly outta the
VIP driveway and the fans jump on
the limos...mayhem. Those limos?
Empty. Meanwhile, Mick and the boys
go out the service exit into
delivery vans -- casual, rock star
type shit.
HARLING helps him into the front seat and they pull away.
The Stones, "Gimme Shelter" starts to play...
53 As they drive off, we see media mayhem collected in front of 53
the hospital. Trucks with towers, cameramen, stringers and
newscasters add to catering trucks and coffee stands as the
vultures wait for the carrion of sound bytes and footage of
survivors.
WHIP's BUICK turns off the blacktop past a small weathered
billboard: WHITAKER CROP DUSTING. Also a real estate "FOR
SALE" sign is posted in front.
Whip pulls into a long, dirt driveway that approaches a one-
story farm house. He gets out of the car. With his cane in
one hand, he uses his free hand to toss the grocery bags
close to the steps and heads inside.
WHIP slides open the heavy barn doors to reveal -- A VINTAGE
CESSNA 172 -- covered in dust and bird shit from the years of
stagnant storage.
WHIP lights a smoke as he marvels at the little piece of
aviation history resting in his barn.
63 Whip dumps out the liquor onto the grass as he hobbles back 63
to the house.
65 WHIP uses just his cane now as he drags a garbage bag full of
65
empty liquor bottles to his garbage cans. He tosses the bag
of empties in a can. His work done, WHIP lights a smoke and
stares at the empty fields that run forever as does the
landscape of his mind. He quietly tries to grasp the horror
he endured and the reality of his survival.
A REPORTER gives a lead in at the crash site.
CRASH SITE REPORTER #1
Kevin, it's still chaotic here at
the site. Apparently a small
ministry was conducting services
near to where the plane came down.
So the scene here is a mix of
survivors and first responders, I
was able to catch up with an actual
passenger moments ago...
A YOUNG SHORT HAIRED BLONDE MAN GIVES HIS ACCOUNT
PASSENGER 1
We were in a nose dive and people
were screaming and yelling and then
the plane turned upside down and we
had to hold on to our seat belts to
keep from falling out of our chairs
-- I saw one kid fall to the floor
and this flight attendant picked
him up and handed him to his
dad...I didn't see her again.
CRASH SITE REPORTER #1
More details and more reports of
the casualties are continuing to
fly around. I can tell you that
there appears to be many, many
survivors. That's all I have for
now. Kevin?
Another reporter has a passenger's account.
CRASH SITE REPORTER #2
Rebecca, surviving passengers are
being put in ambulances, police
cruisers and even first responder
vehicles and they are being taken
to local hospitals for treatment.
Some of the injured appear serious
and it's safe to assume at this
point that there are at least a few
fatalities. Let's roll the tape of
the passenger I caught up with
earlier.
A MAN with SHORT DARK HAIR explains his experience.
75.
PASSENGER 2
We turned like a corkscrew and all
I could think was, "this is really
happening, I'm going to die" and
then all of a sudden the plane was
upside down but steady and the
pilot must have known how to fly it
that way. He flipped it back over
and landed it hard.
CRASH SITE REPORTER #2
Obviously a harrowing ordeal for
those on the troubled plane. This
is Callie J Kenner for News 5.
A third Reporter gets a FEMALE NEIGHBOR's perspective.
CRASH SITE REPORTER #3
Folks in the houses that border
this field came running from their
houses...
NEIGHBOR
I thought it was thunder at first.
But it shook the ground hard.
Thunder don't do like that. I ran
outside and I could hear people
yelling and I could see a small
fire at first. I just took the
dogs and headed down there. Then I
saw the plane crumpled on the
ground. I never seen nothing like
that in my life.
CRASH SITE REPORTER #3
Just like that plane, this
community is shattered. Folks here
remain on edge as media trucks
continue to line their small road
and crowd the field where the plane
still lies. Back to you, Tom.
A news light shines on a lone reporter who stands atop a
small hill above the crash field.
76.
CRASH SITE REPORTER #4
We're gonna take another look at
the cell phone footage that
captured the last moments of
SouthJet's Flight 227.
WE SEE THE GRAINY CELL PHONE FOOTAGE OF THE PLANE
After the PLANE levels off and smacks down in the field, we
return to REPORTER #4 in the crash field.
CRASH SITE REPORTER #4 (CONT'D)
Many hours have passed since the
footage you just watched but the
crash site remains active as
investigators work through the
night. Using flood lights and
miners' caps, teams continue to
comb the crash field looking for
the answers to the hard questions
as to what brought down SouthJet's
flight 227. Those answers remain
in darkness as do the broken pieces
of the aircraft. Hopefully
sunlight will bring answers. For
now this is Kent Johnson reporting.
A 12-pack of beer hits the passenger seat as Whip climbs
behind the wheel. Whip cracks open a "handle" (half-gallon)
of vodka and takes a liberal pull. Whip's shoulders relax as
the alcohol kicks in.
71 After a moment, he starts the car, shifts into gear -- downs 71
another huge slug of vodka -- and pulls out.
WHIP parks his car at a fire hydrant right in front of
NICOLE's building and gets out with his cane. He pops a fresh
beer and looks at the building, looking for a proper
entrance. He notices Fran walking quickly along the second
story balcony -- carrying a baseball bat.
Whip thinks nothing of it and begins casually poking through
the stuff in Nicole's car -- a random collection of junk
including clothes and photographs -- mostly of rock bands
performing.
Now, WHIP HEARS an argument escalating between Fran and
NICOLE.
FRAN (O.S.)
The guy in Unit 1 just told me you
stayed here last night?!
NICOLE (O.S.)
Franny relax, I'm just getting my
shit outta here, okay?
FRAN (O.S.)
What about the rent! YOU OWE ME
MONEY!
He heads off...
WHIP does a decent job of making his way up the exterior
staircase. That beer is making his leg feel a little better.
WHIP moves more aggressively up the stairs as the ARGUMENT
GROWS LOUDER...
FRAN (O.S.)
Who do you think broke down this
fucking door to let the paramedics
in there? Huh?! -- You gotta pay
for all this.
78.
NICOLE (O.S.)
I'm sorry. Just let me get my shit
and get outta here. I will pay you
when I can.
FRAN (O.S.)
I know, just take a shower with me.
How hard is that? C'mon.
NICOLE (O.S.)
No. I'm not doin' that.
FRAN (O.S.)
If I had a bag a dope you'd be on
your knees in my shower right now,
right? Come on...
NICOLE (O.S.)
DON'T TOUCH ME!
WHIP PICKS UP THE PACE OF HIS LIMP TOWARDS THE FRACAS.
FRAN (O.S.)
Gimme the camera, for collateral.
What's it worth?
NICOLE (O.S.)
No fucking way! I will kill you if
you touch this camera! I will pay
for all of this! I will pay, okay!
WHIP crests the top of the staircase to see...
SCENE 75 COMBINED WITH SCENE 74
WHIP opens the door to find HUGH in his driveway.
WHIP casts a strange figure with his bare chest, boxers and
brandishing a shotgun. They stare at each other.
HUGH
Do you wanna shoot me or can I come
inside?
WHIP
C'mon in. I'll shoot you inside.
HUGH walks closer to the porch. WHIP questions him.
WHIP (CONT'D)
You just decided to drop by?
HUGH
Your voice mail is full and you
never answer your cell phone. I
called your cell 10 times.
WHIP
I turned it off.
HUGH nods as the explanation lands.
HUGH
I thought we'd take a ride.
WHIP measures HUGH's intention...
WHIP
Okay, gimme a minute. Wait here.
82 HUGH nods and recedes from the door as WHIP goes to get 82
dressed.
83.
WHIP joins HUGH on a rectangular platform on top of a two-
story scaffolding frame. The platform provides a perfect
view of flight 227's final resting area. We see the awesome
devastation that 50 tons of metal flying at 140 miles an hour
can do to a hillside.
HUGH
You can see the initial impact
sheared the right wing clean off.
If only the left wing had come off
at impact, I think everyone would
have walked off that plane.
WHIP
The left wing partially pulled away-
HUGH
It snapped but stayed connected to
the airframe. So it whipped back
towards the plane, hit the fuselage
in front of the tail. If you were
sitting in the last 6 or 7 rows on
the left side, it was like being
hit by a train.
WHIP
I drank a lot the night before that
flight. I drank that morning too
and I used coke to straighten up.
HUGH
I know, it's in the toxicology
report.
WHIP
But that's not the reason this
happened.
HUGH
I know.
WHIP looks at HUGH expecting him to finish his thought. HUGH
holds his look for a beat before changing thoughts.
HUGH (CONT'D)
The John the Baptist Pentecostal
Mission.
We hear voices; a low murmur that gets louder, chanting.
WHIP looks to the top of the hill to see...
PENTECOSTAL MASS IN PROGRESS
84.
A MINISTER in a dark purple cloak calls from the new
testament as the CONGREGATION responds in unison.
MINISTER
"He will wipe away every tear from
their eyes, and death shall be no
more, neither shall there be
mourning, nor crying, nor pain
anymore, for the former things have
passed away." -- Revelation 21:4
There are at least 50 people sitting in white folding chairs
at the foot of the hill. A small brook babbles behind them.
WHIP continues to take in the bizarre scene.
HUGH
They helped pull survivors out of
the wreckage. Now they come out
here every day and have a mass 30
minutes prior to the crash. And
then they sit in silent prayer for
10 minutes at 9:42...which is when
you went down.
WHIP is overwhelmed by the magnitude of the crash field and
the WORSHIPPERS. WHIP looks back at the crash site to see...
NTSB INVESTIGATORS
Inside the crash site, a small group of INVESTIGATORS with
NTSB jackets following the lead of a CONFIDENT WOMAN. HUGH
answers the question in WHIP's mind...
HUGH (CONT'D)
Ellen Block, she's the head of the
investigation for the NTSB. She's
the one that's gonna ask the tough
questions.
WHIP
Why'd you bring me here?
HUGH
I needed you to see this.
WHIP
You trying to scare me?
HUGH
I need to know that you can handle
all this.
85.
WHIP continues to stare at the awesome dent in the earth.
HUGH (CONT'D)
Listen clearly. There was a
mechanical issue with the plane,
but what you and I know? Is that
this was an act of God. I'm gonna
fight to get the NTSB to place "act
of God" on the probable causes
list.
WHIP
Who's God would do this?
It's quiet before HUGH makes his case.
HUGH
So here's the deal. Avington Carr,
the owner of the airline, is on our
side...and he's got big friends in
Washington. He wants to sit down
with us. 10 O'clock tomorrow
morning.
WHIP's had enough. He starts to walk away. HUGH stops him.
HUGH (CONT'D)
You can't drink. You're under the
microscope. You can't be out
buying liquor. No bars, no drugs.
WHIP
I'll stop. I can stop.
(Hugh stays quiet)
I told you I can stop. I won't
drink.
HUGH
10 O'clock tomorrow morning with
Mr. Carr, the owner of the airline.
NICOLE sits with her camera staring at a candle on the table
in front of her. An AA Book rests on the table. She snaps a
picture of the flame and then focuses out to the grassy
landing strip and the rolling hills.
WHIP enters carrying the large plastic bottle of water from
the kitchen.
WHIP
Morning.
WHIP coughs and rubs his eyes.
NICOLE
Are you okay? You were in bad
shape when I got home.
WHIP
Tired. Guess I drank a bit.
NICOLE
A bit?
WHIP
You wanna count the fuckin' beers?
They're still in the garbage.
Vodka too, is that okay with you?
NICOLE
It's more than okay, Whip.
WHIP
Good.
It's quiet as they let the awkward exchange pass.
NICOLE
I've been watching the sky change
as the sun rises. Beautiful.
(holds up the camera)
Perfect light, I went out and took
some great shots.
WHIP reaches for the camera. She hands it to him.
93.
WHIP
Lemme see that camera.
NICOLE
My mom got it for me. Towards the
end, when she knew she wasn't gonna
recover. She maxed out her credit
card to buy me that camera and a
lighting kit.
NICOLE takes a moment to tamp down some emotions.
NICOLE (CONT'D)
It's just so beautiful here. Did
you grow up here?
WHIP still holds the camera as he sits down.
WHIP
It was my grandfather's farm, my
dad grew up here. He was a pilot
in World War II, flew with the
332nd. See the landing strip out
there? He built that. He ran a
crop duster outta here until the
EPA put an end to that.
(she nods, listening)
He traded the crop duster for a
used Cessna. He flew that damn
thing all over. It's still in the
barn. I was gonna sell this place
after my dad died. Then I got
divorced...
NICOLE
And your mom?
WHIP
Dead...she's dead. Your dad still
alive?
NICOLE
I'm pretty sure my father lives in
Colorado.
WHIP
You got no relationship with him.
NICOLE
He drank. It was my mom that
raised me. She was incredible.
NICOLE lights a cigarette as the memories are tough.
94.
NICOLE (CONT'D)
She held it together for so long, I
couldn't tell how sick she was.
Even through chemo she looked
beautiful.
NICOLE leans over and blows out the candle.
NICOLE (CONT'D)
They gave her very heavy meds for
pain. Dilauded, morphine,
oxycontin. I started taking them
with her. We would get all
medicated and sit in our back yard
and talk and talk and watch the sun
go down. We'd be so stoned that we
couldn't get up to go inside when
it got dark.
(laughs, fights the pain)
I know it sounds crazy to get
hooked on dope with your mom, but
she was dying and we spent her last
seven months together like
teenagers, trading stories about
boys and whatever. She loved me.
WHIP lifts the camera and points it at NICOLE. She contorts
her face into a sly smile. WHIP snaps it...she laughs.
89A A CHURCH BELL SWINGS INSIDE A STONE BELFRY 89A
The blue sky is the perfect backdrop as we reveal...
PHARMACY -- PARKING LOT - DAY
WHIP watches an airliner fly over head as he stands by his
car smoking a cigarette. He wears his suit from the funeral.
NICOLE approaches. She's in a great mood.
NICOLE
Are you okay? How was it?
WHIP
It was okay, okay. How're you
doin'?
A beat.
NICOLE
Well, I got through my first day.
They haven't fired me.
WHIP
That's good. Cause for a
celebration.
NICOLE
They needed someone to work the
night shift. They asked me and
it's time and a half so...
98.
She sorts through her shoulder bag...
NICOLE (CONT'D)
I gotta vest and here's my name
tag. Oh oh oh....I got you
something..
(hands him a nice lighter)
It's a P-51 mustang on there...
(flies her arms like
WINGS)
You're dad flew a P-51, right?
WHIP
(stares at the lighter)
He did. So should we get some
dinner?
NICOLE
I promised Sheila I would be at the
meeting tonight. She's the one
that's been helping me, my sponsor.
Can we do it tomorrow night? And
Please, Whip don't make me choose
between dinner with you and the
meeting.
WHIP nods, playing with the lighter.
WHIP
No, it's okay. You should go.
NICOLE
Why don't you come with me? We'll
eat after. It's an open meeting.
WHIP
Open meeting?
NICOLE
That means anybody can come.
Anybody.
WHIP
Even me?
She is bubbling with happy spirit; she's hot. She's hard to
deny as WHIP can't help but smile at her.
A small pickup truck rambles to a stop in the driveway. We
hear music and laughter as NICOLE gets out.
NICOLE
Thanks for the ride guys. I'll see
you tomorrow.
COWORKER
Keep it up Nicole, you could be
employee of the year.
They all laugh; Nicole waves as they drive off. She walks
towards the house which is dark. She hears music and looks
towards the barn to see bright light escaping through the
sagging doors and split wood walls.
NICOLE slowly approaches the almost glowing barn door. Her
curiosity compels her to pull it open.
The door swings open to find the plane pointed towards the
driveway with an aged patina but revitalized shine. Lenny
Kravitz, "Fly Away" blares from the stereo...
WHIP emerges from the cockpit. He's still in his suit but
with his jacket off and sleeves rolled up. He's energized
like an excited kid. He runs up and kisses her.
NICOLE notes the cloud of smoke hanging in the air and the
burning cigarette in the ashtray, empty beers.
WHIP
Looks great right?
106.
NICOLE
It's kind of...beautiful.
WHIP wipes at his nose.
WHIP
It's a Cessna 172, it was my dad's.
He kept it perfect.
NICOLE takes in this cool trinket of aviation history.
NICOLE
Does it work...
WHIP
Yeah, he flew this plane a few
months before he died. I learned
to fly in this plane. You can land
it anywhere.
WHIP laughs, remembering...
WHIP (CONT'D)
My friend Harling and I flew it to
Jamaica.
NICOLE
Jamaica? In this?
WHIP
We set off for an overnight fishing
trip two hours south of here. We
ended up in Bethel, Jamaica.
NICOLE
You're insane.
WHIP
It was like a picture on a post
card. The white sand and sky blue
water. Most beautiful place I've
ever been.
NICOLE
Was the water warm?
WHIP
Yeah, really warm.
NICOLE
That's my kind of place.
WHIP
Let's go.
107.
NICOLE
Sure, why not.
NICOLE laughs thinking they're playing a game.
WHIP
Let's go tomorrow.
NICOLE
You're serious?
WHIP
We'll leave in the morning...we'll
just go. Start over.
NICOLE realizes he's serious as he opens another beer.
NICOLE
Whip, we can't.
WHIP
It's a beautiful beach, it's
paradise.
NICOLE
I'm worried about you.
WHIP
(laughs a bit lit)
I'm fine thanks.
NICOLE
No you're not, you're really not.
You need help, Whip. I think you
need rehab.
WHIP
You go to a couple of AA meetings
and all of a sudden you think
you're Jesus Christ? Worry about
yourself.
NICOLE
We're the same Whip, you and me,
we're the same-
WHIP
WE'RE NOT-
NICOLE
WE ARE-
108.
WHIP
I didn't suck dick to get high.
And don't give me a whole...
NICOLE
Never Whip, I never in my life-
WHIP
Your mom died and dad drank and
bullshit, bullshit, bullshit --
NICOLE
Stop. Please stop.
WHIP
Is that why you shot dope?
NICOLE
That's not fair-
WHIP
Well there's a lot of people out
there who lost their mom who've
never had a drink in their life.
NICOLE
You're sick, Whip.
NICOLE walks away, leaving WHIP with his plane and his dream
of freedom. WHIP calls after her.
WHIP
I choose to drink.
NICOLE
Do you? You choose it? I don't
see a lot of choice goin' on.
WHIP
I choose to drink! And I blame it
on me. I'm happy to. I've got an
ex-wife and a son I don't see.
Why? Because I choose to drink!
NICOLE quietly exits the house, carrying a crate of her
stuff. She has a duffel bag of clothes over her shoulder as
she makes her way to SHEILA's car that we see parked at the
top of the driveway, far from the house.
WHIP sits in his car. Rain pounds the windshield as we watch
him expertly add vodka to a half-full bottle of orange juice.
WHIP gives the bottle a shake before taking a long drink.
WHIP takes another drink before re-capping the bottle and
stowing it in the glove box. WHIP gets out and we watch him
walk in the rain towards the door of the hangar. A SECURITY
GUARD meets him and takes him inside.
The rain has subsided as WHIP pulls up to his driveway.
Whip turns into the driveway and spots a NEWS VAN in front of
his house. He makes a U-turn and speeds away.
The rain has completely stopped but everything remains wet as
WHIP bangs his front tire in to the curb as he attempts to
park in front of a well-maintained house.
WHIP gets out of his car and makes his way across the street
and towards the house. We notice...
The DRIVER OF A BLACK PRIUS that has been parked farther down
the street gets out of his car, talking on a cell phone.
WHIP walks up the steps and knocks on the door. He waits a
beat and knocks again. Finally, it opens -- DEANA, an
attractive, well-dressed woman in her 40's, stands there
staring.
DEANA
What are you doing here?
WHIP
It's lovely to see you too Deana.
May I come in?
116.
DEANA takes a moment before stepping aside to allow WHIP in.
OFFICER EDMONDS stands up as CHARLIE and HUGH approach
carrying coffees.
CHARLIE
Good morning, how's our man?
127.
OFFICER EDMONDS
Not a peep.
CHARLIE knocks on the door and checks his watch as he waits
for WHIP to answer. CHARLIE cocks his head, knocks again.
CHARLIE
I think your pilot overslept.
HUGH
You didn't let any girls in there
last night did you?
OFFICER EDMONDS
No sir, not a soul. No one came in
or out.
They all wait awkwardly as HUGH checks his watch and knocks
on the door. More silence...
OFFICER EDMONDS (CONT'D)
I have a room key.
CHARLIE takes the room key and lets himself in.
133 The opening bars of Joe Cocker's "Feelin' Alright" crackle 133
just before we see WHIP step out of the hotel room and begin
a relatively steady strut down the hallway. Deja Vu.
Sunglasses on, WHIP is backed by HUGH and CHARLIE who flank
him from a few steps behind. Further back we can see that
OFFICER EDWARDS also exits the room wearing latex gloves,
carrying a large plastic garbage bag that obviously holds any
evidence of the debauched night or the morning's
resurrection.
WHIP sits at a lone picnic table in a fence-enclosed
courtyard. He checks his watch and looks up.
WHIP stands and walks towards us, towards his visitor. As he
gets closer we see a smile break across his face. A smile we
haven't seen since he first saw NICOLE. We reverse to see...
WILL -- WHIP's 17 year old son stands next to a GUARD.
GUARD
You have 40 minutes.
WHIP
Knuckles, you're looking good.
(BEAT)
I sent you something for your
birthday.
WILL
Yeah. I got it.
Another beat as they can't find a way in to a conversation.
148.
WHIP
This is a real surprise; a great
surprise. I haven't seen you-
WHIP chokes up. WILL nods. It's intense. WHIP motions to
the table and they both sit. WILL pulls out a notebook.
WILL
College counselor thought I should
come and interview you.
WHIP
Great. An interview. Okay.
WILL
I'm writing essays for college
applications.
WHIP studies him and laughs...WILL nods and tries to smile.
WHIP
Listen Will, it means everything to
me that you came here. You are an
amazing kid and you deserve great
things...
Again WHIP has to tamp down his emotions.
WILL
So can you help me with this essay?
WHIP
Yeah. Of course.
WILL pulls out a small voice recorder and clicks it on...
WILL
This essay. I have to do an essay
called, "the most fascinating
person I've never met."
The two men just look at each other.
WHIP
And that's me?
WILL nods, both men are struggling to keep it together.
WILL
Can we pick up where we left off?
WHIP nods, unsure as to where this is going.
149.
WHIP
Okay.
WILL
Who are you?
WHIP
Good question.
WHIP smiles...a great, familiar question. He begins to
alternately laugh and sob as there is great relief in the
promise of a connection with his son.
