COMMANDER JAMES TURNER turns to his left
General "WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?"
N.A.S.A. Technician #1 All systems crashing!
N.A.S.A. Technician #2 Massive failure. We lost them.
Utter silence. Utter desolation. DOLLY IN ON GOLDEN'S FACE. Utter
disbelief.
THEO and PEARL
(at telescope)
, and JIMBO
(at the console)
, 20's, are
star-gazing. Astronomy books, Starbucks cups, etc.,
spread all over. Nine Inch
Nails plays on the radio. These three
could land a date if only they would lose
the road flares
(plaid shirts, glasses)
that signal the painful fact that they
are die-hard science
nerds THEO'S POV - THROUGH WKU TELESCOPE - Far off in space
is a
dusty, murky swarm of matter - something resembling a FLOATING
EXPLOSION.
Jimbo When are we going to let N.A.S.A in on what we've found?
Theo We don't even know what we have yet. Comet, asteroid - it
could be
anything up there. And don't be so eager to red flag
N.A.S.A. They don't call us
when they discover anything.
Jimbo Yeah, but this is their sandbox were playing in.
Theo This is our discovery. We're going to hold a press
conference. We're
going to be famous. SPACEWATCH'll name this
thing after us. Job offers are going
to fly in from all the big
companies. J.P.L., that think tank up at M.I.T., hell
even
N.A.S.A. 'll be chasing us.
Pearl I'm going on Oprah, Larry King, Letterman...
Jimbo Hell with them, I'm going on Howard Stern....
Pearl
(concentrating)
This things really acting up tonight. We should find out
if
anyone else knows about this.
Theo How?
Jimbo
(master of factly)
Call N.A.S.A
Theo And say what? "Hi, we're a couple astronomer geeks who found
something
really bitchin; floatin' in space." You can't just
call N.A.S.A. It's like
calling the White House. Besides, you'll
never get the number.
Jimbo I have the number. I got it from "Mega monster."
Pearl Who?
Jimbo He's some super-hacker, I went to high school with. Guy's
totally wired
into every encrypted government installation.
Theo He's also an ex-con.
Jimbo They never proved he shut down the power in those seven
states.
Theo grabs the phone.
Golden and his crew, devastated and exhausted, search for
answers. We cut around
the room.
Clark What the hell was that?
Technician 1 Space junk?
Technician 2 Too big, too much. It took out the whole shuttle.
Clark The press is going to want answers. What are we going to
say?
Golden Nothing. Not until we know what happened.
INTERCUT - N.A.S.A. MISSION CONTROL/WKU OBSERVATORY
Two N.A.S.A. techs, FLIP and SKIP, looking very haggard,
furiously typing
numbers into the circulator. The phone RINGS,
Flip answers.
Jimbo
(whispers to Pearl & Theo)
I got mission control....!
Flip Yeah, Mission Control.
Jimbo
(into phone)
Uhh hi, I'm an astronomer in Kentucky, and I was wondering
if
you guys had seen some strange activity in the southern middle
quadrant of
the asteroid belt between Antares Major and Epsilom
Scorpio....
Flip Who is this?
Jimbo My name? Uhh....Louis Lipshitz...
Flip This is a restricted line. How did you get it? Where are
you?
Jimbo Lexington... Massachusetts.
Flip Can you tell me the exact co-ordinates..?
Theo Hang up! Hang up now!
Jimbo hangs up the phone.
Theo Lexington.. uhh...Massachusettes. Idiot. I told you not to
call them.
FIFTY T.V.s are BLOWN across the showroom floor. SALESMEN and
CUSTOMERS dive to
the floor, SCREAMING.
Golden enters the room and sits down. Technician Flip hands him a
secure phone.
Golden sinks into his chair. In the b.g., VIDEO
MONITORS show twenty live feeds
from T.V. stations across the
country.
Temple
(V.O.)
Can you go secure?
Golden
(presses a button on the phone)
I am secure. Go ahead, General.
He listens...WE HEAR the distinct gargled voice of a secure line.
Golden When?
Temple
(V.O.)
Twelve minutes ago. Now you know what happened to your shuttle.
INTERCUT - GOLDEN / TEMPLE
Temple paces in his office.
Temple I'm going to brief the President. What's going on here,
Dan? Why didn't
we have warning?
Golden Tell the president it's called "budget cuts." We don't
have enough
telescopes to track the skies.
Temple Is it over?
Golden I don't know. We'll figure it out.
(hangs up)
Flip enters the room. Skip writes notes....
Golden
(to Skip and Flip)
Fly a team up to New York. Contact every Space Watch
facility
in the world. We gotta find what part of the sky this is coming
from.
Skip I'll call J.P.L. and get the Hubble telescope on it.
Golden Did we find who made the phone call last night?
Flip The F.B.I.'s on it.
Theo is sleeping. The door is RAMMED in. Two F.B.I. AGENTS ROAR
into the room,
overwhelming him.
F.B.I. AGENTS and N.A.S.A. SCIENTISTS examine a CHUNK OF
ASTEROID, still
smouldering, which has ripped through the roof
and floor of a subway car. The
plastic seats and aluminium
panelling of the car has melted.
Jimbo, Theo and Pearl sit in front of three F.B.I. AGENTS. Two
N.A.S.A.
ASTRONOMERS look over the kids' TELESCOPE PHOTOS with
concern.
Jimbo So, that N.A.S.A. guy wasn't kiddin; about bein' arrested
and....
Federal Agent Please shut up.
Jimbo Yes, absolutely, yes sir.
N.A.S.A. Astronomer I'm a N.A.S.A. astronomer. When were these
photos taken?
Federal Agent And which of you called N.A.S.A. Mission Control
last night?
Jimbo
(points at Theo)
Him.
Theo
(points at Jimbo)
Him.
Jimbo I was calling the Houston area code, which is 713. I was
calling 712,
which is outside Spokane, Washington, where my Aunt
Zelda....
N.A.S.A. Astronomer Tell us the exact ascension angle of your
telescope when
this was taken.
Theo It's our discovery. No way.
N.A.S.A. Astronomer Your "discovery" killed close to 100 people
in New York
alone - people who could've used a warning.
Jimbo, Theo and Pearl lower their eyes.
Jimbo Our math must've been off! we thought it was gonna pass the
Earth!
Pearl Ascension 712, retention 345.
F.B.I. Agent 2 And you've told no one about this- not your
teachers, not your
friends?
N.A.S.A. Astronomer
(into cellular phone)
J.P.L., please. Search
co-ordinates...
N.A.S.A.'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory home of the HUBBLE SPACE
TELESCOPE. Two
J.P.L. TECHNICIANS man the Hubble's control
console.
J.P.L. Technician 1 New info! Plot co-ordinates 712 by 345. Let's
move on
high-resolution imaging. J.P.L. TECHNICIAN 2 punches the
co-ordinates into a control console.
Images from the Hubble arrive on a high resolution printer.
J.P.L. Technician 1
grabs four PHOTOS from the printer.
Technician 2 swipes stuff off the console,
making room. Together
they arrange the four photos. They star silently at the
awesome
COMPOSITE PHOTO.
J.P.L. Technician 1 Motherfu......
Golden and all his TECHNICIANS crowd around a console, staring at
a smaller
version of the COMPOSITE PHOTO.
Golden Copies to the Pentagon, Colorado Space Command, and the
Washington
office. We gotta compute size, composition, speed,
impact point
WE SEE the photo -- A HUGE ASTEROID
- BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT
Golden and Clark enter. A group of ten N.A.S.A. SENIOR
TECHNICIANS are all
talking at once.
Golden Okay guys, one of the worst days in N.A..S.A history just
got worse.
Ten million to one. A rogue comet came from deep
space and collided with an
asteroid. Some
kids actually got a
picture of the collision event and told no one.
The stuff that
hit this morning was the collision's forward-thrown matter, mere
pebbles from what's
about to come. Walter?
Clark A big asteroid. E.T.A., eighteen days. A lot bigger than
the five mile
one that obliterated the dinosaurs.
Silence. Everybody stares at each other.
The phone CHIRPS.
Golden's Secretary Director, the Pentagon.
Golden hits a button.
A LARGE T.V. SCREEN establishes AUDIO/VISUAL link.
INTERCUT; PENTAGON - SITUATION ROOM/ N.A.S.A. - BRIEFING ROOM
Temple sits with the Joint Chiefs, White House Chief of Staff,
the Directors of
the N.A.S.A., C.I.A., etc.
Temple Dan, we're all here. Tell us what we're up against.
Golden
(V.O.)
In it's simplest terms? The end of Mankind. One asteroid, one
mile wide or bigger, impacts the Earth with the equivalent force
of all the
nuclear weapons in the
world, times a thousand. Half
our population will die within 24
hours from tidal waves and
heat pulses. The other half won't be so lucky. In the
end, it
will be men
eating the flesh of other men.
(beat)
It's not the end of the
world, General, the world - Earth -
will still be here. But there will be no
life - maybe
cockroaches and
some resilient strands of bacteria.
Temple Well, that's really positive, Dan. The President just got
off the phone
with the Russians. They're just about to launch a
new Mars Probe on the biggest
rocket in the world.
Golden and
the N.A.S.A. BRASS exchange sceptical looks.
Golden
(V.O)
With the worst guidance system in the world. Their Mars Probe in
'96 was found by a pygmy tribe in Africa.
Temple They're going to pull off the probe and replace it with
four Atlas
Class IV nuclear warheads. Enough punch in their
opinion - not to break it up -
but to slow it down enough to
miss Earth's orbit.
Golden
(V.O)
Their launch date is set for next month.
Temple They're going to move it up.
Golden
(V.O)
To when?
Temple Sixteen hours from now.
All the N.A.S.A. Technicians CLAMOR at once.
Golden
(V.O)
What are they gonna do, glue, spit, and scotch tape it together?
Even if they get a nuke out to the asteroid, a surface nuclear
detonation is not
going to work.
The only way is to split the
thing in half and hope the two pieces
slide past us.
Temple Thank you for bringing up the impossible, Dan.
Colinswood People, the President's joining us, Mr. President?
President
(V.O)
Well, this has been a tough day. The media's all over this.
They're going to get nothing. Telling the public we might all be
dead in
eighteen days achieves nothing but panic.
Golden
(V.O)
Mr President, finding this speck in the sky is a very hard thing
to do unless you have the exact co-ordinates. There are only
twelve telescopes
powerful enough
to see it right now. You've
got a full moon goin' for four days -
makes it all but
impossible to see.. Once these things draw closer to Earth,
you'll never keep a lid on
this. No way.
The video screen blinks off. Golden looks at his Techs.
Golden How many of you are as scared as I am?
Golden raises his hand. All the other N.A.S.A. Techs, one by one,
raise their
hands.
Golden One giant leap for Mankind. Everyone remember that? This
is what we are
going to do. We're going to fly to that asteroid
with a nuclear device, implant
it and get off
before it blows.
Quincy?
All eyes turn to N.A.S.A. Chief of R&D;, RONALD QUINCY. Quincy has
coke bottle
glasses and a 198 I.Q.
Quincy Look: set a fire cracker off in your open palm, you get a
third degree
burn. Close your fist, It'll do some serious
damage. If we can get a nuke deep
in one of the asteroid's fault
lines, she'll split in two, like a diamond.
Golden You're all looking art us like we're crazy. We're not.
Skip Dan, our currant shuttle fleet is too old and too slow.
Golden What I'm going to tell you is a breach of national
security and could
land me in jail, but in eighteen days there
arnt' gonna be any jails,
so....We're not gonna use a
current
shuttle. Gentlemen, I'm talking about the X-71.
Skip It's done?
Quincy Has been for three months.
Golden Time is our enemy. This is like the race to the Moon, guys
- what this
Agency was founded on.
Skip Boss, we're good at space travel, but you're talkin' about
drilling a
hole.
Golden Quincy's been working on excavating the ice from the Moon
- he's gonna
reorient his thinking. Right, Quince?
Quincy Right. And the first thing I'm gonna do is talk to the guy
I ripped
off. His name is Harry S. Stamper. He's the best oil
driller in the world.
Golden I don't care who he is, what he's doing.
A.J., holding his breath under water, shimmies down the drilling
pipe
feet-first, inside the water-filled concrete tube running
from the rig to the
ocean floor.
A.J. is pinned against the hole wall by one of the disconnected
pipes. Harry
comes down the hole. He plants his back against the
hole wall and kicks the
pipe, freeing A.J. A slow, deep, RUMBLE
emanates from below. The Briny water
inside the hole suddenly
turns BLACK and VISCOUS.
A.J. and Harry exchange an alarmed look. Harry, then A.J., pull
for the surface,
up the drilling hole as --
Golden, Clark, Skip, Flip and the rest of the Mission Control
Technicians watch
a live feed from Russia. A RUSSIAN ENERGIA
SUPER BOOSTER ROCKET sits on its
launch platform.
Flip Look it that sucker. They got a nuke up there in sixteen
hours?
Skip It'll never fly. Never.
Clark Three things the Russians make well, guys - vodka, gymnasts
and rockets.
Don't count 'em out.
Golden It's the late 20th century, I run the U.S. Space Program,
and I'm
praying to God the Russians are better at this than we
are....
Golden, Clark, and all the N.A.S.A. Techs stare at the burning
rocket.
Golden So, where's our oil driller?
Jimbo, Theo and Pearl sit in a holding cell some place. Jimbo's
banging on the
door.
Jimbo Hey, zipperheads! Ever watch "L.A. Law?" Right to remain
silent, right
to an attorney? My brother's a bad-ass lawyer -
he's gonna sue your asses to
Mars. I was in pre-
law for a
month - you can't put somebody in jail for makin' a phone
call!!!
Pearl It isn't about that, Jimbo. We saw something we weren't
supposed to.
Theo Something they're not telling the public.
Jimbo Yeah, that's why they were so hot for the co-ordinates. Do
you think
it's an asteroid? Or comet?
Theo I dunno - but I bet it's a whopper.
Harry, AJ. and Grace are led into the room by Stinson. Quincy's
eyes move to
Harry --
Quincy He's here.
Quincy, Clark and Golden stand, approach --
Quincy
(cont'd)
Dan Golden, meet Mister Harry Stamper, the finest oil driller
in the world.
Golden Mister Stamper..
(shaking hands)
Dan Golden, I'm Director of --
Harry I know who you are. I watched T.V. once. Apollo 8, right?
First manned
lunar orbit.
Golden That was a long time ago. I run this place now. And we've
got a serious
problem on our hands that Quincy here thinks you
might be able to help us out
with --
Quincy eagerly outstretches his hand. They shake. Quincy doesn't
let go.
Quincy I'm a big fan, Mr. Stamper.
Harry I kinda caught that.
(to Golden)
What's the problem, gentlemen?
Golden I wonder if we might speak alone?
Harry These two are my right and left arms. Grace Stamper and
Albert Jack
Frost. Stupid name, so we call him A.J..
(handshakes)
They run my company. You
talk to me, you
talk to them.
Golden Okay.
Golden direct everyone into --
Golden, Temple, Clark, Harry, Grace, and A.J. sit in a dark room
viewing a
VIDEOTAPE. Quincy stands beside the projector,
supplying narration. On the tape
we see Harry on a rig platform
shaking hands with an ARAB BUSINESSMAN --
Harry Great, home movies.
Grace and A.J. smile.
Quincy Nineteen eighty five. The first well drilled over 50
thousand feet.
They said it couldn't be done. You did it.
Incredible.
ON THE SCREEN - Harry's on another rig, shaking hands with an
INDONESIAN
BUSINESSMAN. Harry leans over and kisses the bit. The
Businessmen shake their
heads, awed.
Quincy
(cont'd)
Nineteen Ninety-One. Directional drilling through two miles of
anthracite. They also said that couldn't be done. You did it.
Incredible.
Harry looks at Quincy strangely; this sure is a bizarre form of
celebrity.
Quincy
(cont'd)
Ninteen Ninety-Three. The first hole over seventy thousand.
Once again they said --
Golden Move it along, Quincy.
Quincy Right, sorry. Mister Stamper, you're the world's foremost
expert in
deep drilling. You hold specialized patents in high
speed bits, drilling fluids,
downhole motors Can I call you
Harry?
Harry Stick with Stamper.
Golden Well, Mister Stamper, we need you to drill a hole. It's in
a difficult
place.
Harry I've drilled in them all.
Golden Not...this place. This is really out there.
(beat)
Space, Mister
Stamper.
Harry As in...outer?
SATELLITE PHOTOS OF THE ASTEROID come up on the screen --
Temple You've watched the news the last 24 hours? You heard about
the meteor
shower?
(Harry nods)
What you don't know is that an asteroid is on a collision
course with
Earth. If it hits us, Earth as we know it will be
over.
Golden We're manning a mission to that asteroid to plant a
nuclear device in
it's core. To do that we need to drill an
eight hundred foot hole.
Harry looks at A.J. and Grace.
Harry A.J., is this guy shitting me?
A.J. I don't think they shit people at N.A.S.A., Harry --
Harry An eight hundred foot hole. On a moving asteroid. In space.
Golden All we want is your advice in perfecting our drilling arm,
any help you
can provide. We'll pay your usual consultancy, of
course.
Harry Show me your rig.
Quincy leads Golden, Harry, A.J., Grace, and Clark through
N.A.S.A.'s Research
and Development area. This place looks like
"Q's" weapons shop from the James
Bond movies as funded by every
company on the fortune 500 --
Huge, clinically clean, dominated by MASSIVE ROCKET ENGINES.
TECHNICIANS in
white coats and hairnets work on a variety of
equipment.
TECHNICIANS hunch over a ROVER VEHICE, not the golf cart used on
the moon. This
is low, squat, sturdy, with an enclosed airlocked
passenger compartment.
Quincy The "Armadillo" - our fourth generation rover. It carries
a six-cell
solar engine with 824 horses. This was a joint
venture with the Germans.
(winks)
It's designed by Porsche.
Quincy motions to TWO TECHNICIANS. They roll over a ROBOTIC ARM
on a gurney,
powered by an ELECTRIC MOTOR. The robotic arm is
connected to an OIL DRILLING
BIT.
Harry Where's the Kelly?
Quincy This baby works without one.
Harry How does it work?
Harry starts to inspect the bit.
Quincy It works through a series of complexly designed
differential gears.
Harry's face tightens, as he studies the bit further --
Harry This is my Patent.
Quincy "Drilling Power Transfer Without Conventional Hydraulics,"
by Harry S.
Stamper. You registered it with the U.S. Patent
Office last year.
Harry You stole it.
Quincy We just borrowed it, Mister Stamper.
Quincy unpockets a remote control panel and presses a button. The
drill bit
presses down into a block of concrete and begins to
rapidly CHEW through it, as
Harry marvels at the realisation of
his design.
Quincy
(cont'd)
We built this arm to mine ice from the moon -- greatest
discovery in space in thirty years.
Harry What'd this cost?
Golden Ten million.
Quincy Twenty-our million.
Harry Boy, I'm in the wrong line of work. So, that's where my
taxes go. For
thievin' incompetent, government employed rip-off
artists?
A.J. No torque adjustment, no pressure release valve....a big
hunk of junk.
Quincy We're working on that.
Harry What happens if you hit gas? You have three seconds. Drill
faster, run
like hell, or pray.
(beat)
Time's up. You're dead., The rig just blew.
Golden Gentlemen, gentlemen, wait a second. The crux of the
matter....
Harry Hang on. I betcha everyone in this room has a PH.D.
Golden Or three....
Harry I left school after tenth grade. I earned my PH.D every day
offshore
drilling holes. You can't get it in a book. Drilling
holes is about instinct -
about smellin' it. Drillin' holes is
an art. You want the crux of the matter?
(beat)
You stole my
patent, and you don't have a goddamn idea how to
use it. As for this piece o'
crap, don't insult me.
(walks around the rig)
I'll rebuild it - the right way - and drill the
hole for you.
Grace Uhm, pop, could we discuss this...?
Harry Just give me a space suit.
Golden You won't need one. You're not going up.
Harry You don't have a choice. I think all you PH.D's know that.
Harry walks off. Grace and A.J. follow.
Golden
(calling after Harry)
Harry. Let's figure this out.
Harry sits opposite Golden and Temple. Grace and A.J. stand
behind him.
Harry First of all, you're going to buy my patent.
Temple Of course, completely in order. What is the price?
Harry Fifty million dollars.
Uncomfortable pause. Temple clears his throat.
Temple Mr. Stamper, this mission is to preserve the future of....
Harry You're right, too low. I'm still pissed. Seventy million.
Temple Done.
Harry looks to Grace.
Harry Give that money to my Greenpeace buddies.
(smile)
Told
you...complicated.
Harry goes to shake, pulls back --
Harry
(cont'd)
And I never want to pay taxes again.
Temple I'll call the I.R.S., try to uhm, explain the situation.
They begin to shake. Harry withdraws his hand.
Harry I have this great log cabin in Montana. It's kind of a
nature...getaway...thing.
Temple You want us to buy that, too?
Harry No. I fly fish there. But the fly fishin's sucked ever
since they put in
that goddamn hydro-electric dam. I want it
gone by the time I get back.
Temple reluctantly nods. They stand to shake, Harry pulls away
again.
Harry
(cont'd)
Now about my crew.
Golden The deal was for you, not others.
Harry I'm only as good as the men I work with. The ones in those
home movies
of yours.
Golden It's out of the question.
Harry half-smiles to Grace.
Golden
(cont'd)
Okay, who?
Harry :My chief tool pusher. You game A.J.? A.J. Wouldn't miss
it, Harry.
Harry And my roughnecks, Roustabouts, and Rockhound?
Temple Rock what? Is that a dog?
Harry No. Just a meek, geek geophysicist.
Golden What kind of men are these?
Bennie, Chick
(30's, a street philosopher)
, Max
(35, hulky)
, TITO, and ROCKHOUND
(small, wiry)
are riding in high style. Chick is hanging out of the sun roof
with his shirt off. Radio's on full blast. Rockhound's pouring
whiskey from the
fancy decanters.
Chick We're living LARGE!
Bennie
(talking on a cellular phone)
Give me nickels on Miami, Washington, San
Diego, and Green Bay.
(listens)
Quit whining. Last thing I need is to be friends
with my
bookie.
(listens, then angry)
(MORE)
Bennie
(cont'd)
Look, when the entire Mexican Army had Butch and the Sundance
Kid trapped in that Hacienda, did they wait to die? Hell no. They
went out guns
blazing. I live
by the code of that movie, man.
Bennie hangs up the phone, he looks across from him at -- Tito
Guevara, late
30's, stocky, tattooed, Latino,
(reformed 118th Street L.A. o.g. gangbanger who
was rescued from
the streets ten years back and put to work on a rig by Harry)
is reading a book "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus."
Chick drops down into his seat, continues his heated discussion
with Max.
Chick Charlie Bronson could kick Steve McQueen's ass and have
enough left over
to duke it out with Burt Reynolds in his
"Smokey and the Bandit" period.
Max I'm glad you qualified that shit 'cause you know the Burt
Reynolds of
"Deliverence" would have kicked Charlie's ass.
Chick Burt was trouble in that flick.
Max What would you say the all-time, slam-bam, take-no-prisoners,
kick-ass
Charlie Bronson movie is?
Chick All time? Well, let me think. "Dirty Dozen," the first
"Death Wish." No,
no! That movie where he hunted the buffalo. I
don't remember the name but he
hunted a buffalo and he said like
three words during the whole picture. That's my
selection.
Max Fine. The buffalo movie. That's your pick. You relly think
that buffalo
Charlie could have thrown-down with the Steve
McQueen form "Bullitt?"
Chick He'da whooped his ass and then his father's. We'll settle
this right
now. Rockhound? You heard the debate. You're the
Supreme Court. What's the final
verdict?
Rockhound Tough call. But for me though, one name -- Poncherello.
Eric
Estrada. You know, "Chips."
Chick and Max just look at him. A beat. Then --
Max What did you ask him for? Guy makes his living looking at
rocks.
The limo pulls over and stops. The DRIVER gets out and walks to
the rear door.
Opens it.
Harry has just briefed his crew on the mission.
Bear ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?
Chick Harry, this is some "Star Wars" shit. This ain't for us.
Harry It's a job, like any other. Just a different location.
Max We work rigs. We understand rigs. We don't know dick about
being
astronauts.
Rockhound
(pointing)
I might add that to get us up there they're going to have
to
strap our asses on one of those rockets. That means fire,
involuntary shit
release, and a slew of other stuff I can't hang
with.
JIMBO We don't have "The Right Stuff," know what I'm saying?
(looking around)
We're Roughnecks.
Harry I'd rather die up there fighting this thing than sit
here
waiting for it.
Harry's line hangs in the air. Everyone exchanges looks.
Bear I don't like the idea of waiting around to croak. It's
wimpy.
Chick If Harry-the-iron-ass is going, I'm going with him.
Bear Hell, I'm going just so I can say I went.
(shrugs)
Once we get up there,
it's making hole.
Tito I'm in.
Max, Chick, and Tito sit in HOSPITAL SMOCKS on two examination
tables. They have
tattoos, long hair. A cigarette dangles from
Tito's lips. AIR FORCE NURSES are
everywhere. A NURSE clips a
SWATCH OF HAIR from each of the men. She comes to
Tito. He grabs
her arm. Takes the scissors from her.
Tito Nobody touches my hair but me.
He cuts a SWATCH of hair, gives it to her. A SECOND NURSE is in
front of Max and
Tito.
Max You're not taking any more blood. You vampires already have
enough to feed
your coven for a year.
Nurse
(nasally-voiced)
We need to know what substances you've recently
ingested.
Tito What, uhh, "substances" you talkin' about?
Nurse
(matter of fact)
Drugs.
Ma and Tito eye each other nervously. Head Nurse, HELGA, stands
before Chick
with an ENAMA PROBE and a JAR OF VASELINE.
Chick An Ena-WHAT?
Helga Enema.
Chick And you want to stick it where?
Helga sticks the ENEMA PROBE in a jar of VASELINE.
Chick
(cont'd)
No way, lady. I came here to drill.
Helga So did I.
Chick sits before a hugely endowed but square female N.A.S.A.

PSYCHOLOGIST.
Psychologist Say the first two words that come to mind, beginning
with each
letter.
Chick Bodacious and....Bountiful.

Succulent and Sinful.
She holds up the letter "F" and HOLD ON CHICK'S REACTION.
Harry sits before the Chief Physician, DR. BANKS. Golden looks
out the window.
Dr. Banks, dead-serious, flips through the
medical and psychiatric test scores.
Dr Banks Mr. Stamper, your men...are...take Mr. Chappel. I
believe they call
him Chic.
Harry Charles, but if you call him that, he'll kill you.
Dr Banks
(nervous laugh)
I assume you're joking.
(no response)
Your men show
aggression, extreme maladjustment to their
surroundings, anti-social behaviour
--
Harry With all due respect, Doctor, I don't know too army guys
who are social
when someone is trying to jam a tube up their
butt.
Dr Banks Does your company have a drug testing program? These
toxicology
reports are a throwback to the sixties. All show huge
levels of nicotine and
alcohol. Three of the, four show illegal
drugs. A couple I had to look up. One of them
had "Kematine" --
a very potent sedative.
Harry A lot of people take sedatives.
Dr Banks This one is used on horses.
Harry I don't tell my men how to live their lives. They're with
me to do a job
and they do it well.
Golden This is getting us nowhere. Can they fly, or not?
Dr Banks
(flipping through physical records)
Failed. Failed. Really failed.
Under the circumstances...
(locks eyes with Golden)
They're the finest physical
specimens I've ever seen.
Harry's crew walk together in newly issued N.A.S.A. jumpsuits.
Bear and JIMBO
have ripped the sleeves and collars off their X-
Large suits.
They walk past two N.A.S.A. mathematicians.
Mathematician 1
(to mathematician 2)
We're screwd.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL
Temple and Golden standing there with their arms crossed,
watching the motley
crew of Roughnecks. They're joined by
U.S.A.F. test pilots COLONEL SHARP, a
young Chuck Yeager type,
and LT. COLONEL LUCAS TRUMAN, 30's, rigid and muscular.
Sharp I mean, they kind of look like Armstarong, Lovell, and
Glenn.
(turns,
soberly to Golden)
So, my wife and little girls' lives are in their hands, sir?
Golden We need to drill. Do you know how to drill, colonel?
(beat)
Neither do
I. They're going up.
Temple
(pointing to his lapel)
With my stars came the power to be blunt. These
drillers are
not trained for this, Dan.
Truman shakes his head. Sharp eyes Golden, waiting for a
response.
Golden General, it's our job to get them ready to go into space.
They're there
to do the drilling.
(beat, then)
And Colonel Sharp, we all have families.
A hard look from Sharp to Temple, as Golden walks away.
Temple
(to Golden)
If they can't drill this hole, my men are going to take
over.
Quincy is face-to-face with Golden. TECHS work on the drilling
arm in the b.g.
Harry and the Roughtnecks are across the room.
Harry That Armadillo car. Get it in here.
In rolls the Armadillo, two TECHNICIANS pushing it. Harry and the
guys look at
it. Quincy shows it off.
Quincy Pressurised titanium alloy cab. Airlocked life support.
The chassis's
by General Motors. Heavy duty suspension and six
wheel drive.
Harry How were you going to power your drill arm?
Quincy Turbo-jet engine fuelled by Kerosene and liquid oxygen.
Harry I need to be able to start and stop. I need different
speeds, and I need
reverse.
Quincy A jet engine can't do that.
Harry It can if it's hooked up to a clutch. A.J., get me a Mack
truck
transmission.
Quincy That's so simple it's brilliant.
Harry I'm a simple man. But don't underestimate me.
A.J. Chick, Max! Mack truck tranny!
Chick and Max hurry off. A.J. smiles at Harry.
Harry, A.J., Bennie, Chick, Max, and Tito sit before Quincy, who
demonstrates a
series of components on the N.A.S.A. SPACE SUIT.
Quincy The new generation EMU - Extravehicular Mobility Unit -
provides oxygen
for seven hours, a pressurised enclosure, and
temperate control. The gloves and
helmet slide
on and lock with
a twist, like this. The cap is worn underneath. It
contains a
mike and headphones for two-way communication. We'll be able to
see
you from a small
video cam mounted inside the helmet. The
Undergarment has 300 feet
of plastic tubing circulating cooling
water. Owen...
OWEN THE TAILOR, five foot nothing & bald, stands in front of the
men.
Owen These are made for men 5'8" to 6'2", between 140 and 200
pounds. All of
you fit within those parameters - thank God we
won't have to do any
re-tailoring....
Owen stops because --
Bear and Jimbo stand in the doorway --
JIMBO Yo. This where we get our suits?
Bear Sorry, we're late. Doc said we had... What do we got?
JIMBO Cholesterol difficulties. Said we gotta enter "The Zone."
Bear Shit, the only zone I know is the one around my mama's
grill.
JIMBO
(holding up form)
But we're approved.
Owen looks at the human mountains standing before hi, and then at
the tiny EMU
suit. Alterations will be necessary.
Clark briefs Harry and the mildly attentive Roughnecks. Sharp,
Truman, CO-PILOTS
MEGAN WATTS
(30's, tough as nails)
and STAN WESTON stand in the back along with
N.A.S.A. Engineers
JACK CROSS and RAYMOND SEARS.
Clark United States astronauts train for eighteen months. You
have nine days.
Officers Sharp, Truman, Watts and Weston are
your military instructors and the
only pilots to have flown the
spacecraft.
(beat)
Each is a combat decorated officer
and among the finest men and
women we have in the service. Pay attention to
them.
Sharp We spend six months on emergency training - we're throwing
that out. If
we fail, everyone dies. Game over. That's a heavy
load but it's ours to carry.
The purpose of this is to train you
in the physical and mental rigors of working
in a weightless
enviroment so that you will not panic. So you can do your jobs.
(beat)
You will vomit.
Your eyes will be sucked into the back of your
heads. You'll be so
tired you can't eat but that won't matter
'cause you'll be so sore you can't
take a dump. By the
way...good morning.
Splash, Splash. Harry and the Roughnecks descend underwater. They
look like
Michelin Men in their thick space suits. Navy divers
are around them as they are
lined up.
Through the underwater speaker, WE HEAR a trainer giving them
instructions for
their weightless aerobic training. WE HEAR a
loud, embarrassing gastric sound
from Bear's suit.
Bear Houton, we have a problem. That is some vicious methane.
Harry gives a "shut the fuck up" look. Time passes as the guys
are dying,
HUFFING and PUFFING. One by one, they reach
exhaustion. A cabled harness hoists
each out.
Harry and his team, in T-shirts and running shorts, jog on a
series of
threadmills, wired to EKG machines, nostrils taped
shut, breathing tubes locked
Harry plastered to the seat, MOANING so scared he can't puke. The
plane
barrel-rolls and dives straight to the ground. Harry is
GRUNTING and sweating
trying to stay conscious.
The Roughnecks walking to the T-38 Hanger. Sharp stands on the
stairway to the
707 and calls everyone to attention.
Sharp Trainees, AT EASE
(in command)
We are not done here. We're taking you
for a little ride. This
bird will climb to 40 thousand feet and drop to 10
thousand feet
to give
you the feeling of weightlessness for 30 seconds.
Welcome to
The plane drops. The Roughnecks lift off inside. Everyone's
flying around the
cabin. It's a disaster. Guys bump heads. Bear
floats like a beached whale. Jimbo
rams the roof. Hary hold a
barf bag as he floats. An alarm SOUNDS, then the
plane levels
off, the guys go slamming into the floor.
Tracking past a row of stalls, WE SEE the soles of a pair of
shoes peeking out.
Then another pair, another, and another over
the multiple sounds of guts being
tossed into the toilet.
Golden, Clark, and Sharp stand outside the stalls.
Golden This is like putting the Hell's Angels in space.
Harry and the Roughnecks are welding the Armadillo, working tough
and hard.
The Roughnecks are getting dressed.
Max
(to Chick)
We're going to go pound some brews where they have a lot of
sweaty, naked women. You in?
Chick
(shakes head)
No. I got to take care of something.
The Roughnecks walk out, leaving Chick behind.
INT N.A.S.A. CAR - NIGHT
Driven by a uniformed N.A.S.A. TECH, Chick pulls up to a house in
a residential
neighbourhood. He sits there with a beat, unsure
of what to do.
A seedy Houston drinking hole. All the Roughnecks sit at the bar.
The bar is
littered with EMPTY MUGS AND SHOTGLASSES. A WOMAN
looks at Bennie.
Woman What are you boys doin' down here in good 'ol Houston?
Bennie
(burps)
We're in astronaut training.
This gets the reaction you'd expect.
Harry and Quincy go over a list of stuff to order and logistical
problems.
N.A.S.A. Tech rushes into the room.
N.A.S.A. Tech Space Command spotted more incoming.
Quincy
(springing up)
Where' it headed? How big?
N.A.S.A. Tech Don't know.
They start to run out of the room. Harry follows.
The camera follows up a long ladder to a huge rocket bell housing
where A.J. and
Grace are kissing passionately. They notice Harry
and Quincy, and the other
Techs heading for Mission Control.
Harry locks eyes with A.J. He doesn't like
it. A.J. and Grace
know something is up. They follow Harry and the others into
Mission Control.
The room is lit up. Men are scrambling. Phones and satellite
charts pop up.
Tracking devices PING. Golden on top of the
chaos. A TRACKING TECH plots on a
map. Clark stands over a
N.A.S.A. TECH reading a computer screen.
Golden Projected impact tracking. I need stats!
Tracking Tech Eastern Asian Hemisphere... someplace...ETA 17
minutes.
N.A.S.A. Tech We have confirmation. The incoming is about the
size of the
Astrodome.
Clark We've got to warn.
Golden Warn who? The whole South Pacific?
Golden, with lack of sleep and stress, falls back into a chair.
He closes his
eyes, opens them -- finding Harry in the upper
Mission Control Deck. They lock
eyes for a long moment.
The city ablaze in neon. The harbour, floating junksmanned by
Chinese merchants.
A loud sonic boom CRACKS in the sky. There's
a BRIGHT FLASH in the sky. Night
becomes day for two seconds.
The world slows down, motion creeps. The bright FLASH catches the
face of a
little BOY reaching out for his father's hand. The
asteroid SHRIEKS down,
hitting the harbour's surface in a red
hot FLASH-BOILED at 100 thousand degrees.
The room is silent. Reports are starting to come in about the
devastation.
Golden walks up to Harry who is standing with Grace
and A.J. He pulls Harry
aside.
Golden Stamper, answer me one question - have you ever let anyone
down?
We go close on Harry's face. Searing flashbulbs popping, WIDEN TO
WE SEE him from behind as he addresses the massive crowd. The
U.S. PRESIDENT
stands before a throng of reporters.
PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS
Papers headlines, CNN reporters flash on screens. Images of
people watching the
news in bars, at home. A NEW YORK POST slams
down on the pavement, the headline -
SHANGHAI DISASTER, MASSIVE
DEATH TOLL RISING.
Jimbo is talking to an F.B.I. AGENT who is on the other side of
the bars holding
a newspaper.
Jimbo If it's over then why aren't you lettin' us out of this
goddamn cell?
F.B.I. Agent Be real soon, son.
The agent flips the newspaper into the holding cell and walks
away.
Jimbo Don't walk away, I want to talk to my lawyer. You hear me?
Pearl
(refering to the newspaper)
This says that the asteroid came from the
Southern Hemisphere.
Theo Southern Hemisphere?
Pearl No kidding. It's a big sky - they want people to look the
other way.
Stu the cabbie is riding with a WALL STREET GUY.
Stu Kennedy lied about the Bay of Pigs, Nixon...Watergate, say no
more.
Clinton. One word. 'Women.' If I know one thing; ALL
PRESIDENTS LIE.
Morning after the devastating disaster in Shanghai. Harry walks
into the quiet
room. Harry's all business.
Harry Forty thousand people died last night. But I guess that
didn't concern
any of you. I hope you all had a good time last
night.
The Roughnecks look around. They know there were wrong.
Chick I gotta tell you...I'm scared.
Harry Well, you should be scared. We all should be. 'Cause if we
fail, they
say the Earth will die.
Harry sits down, looks out the window at N.A.S.A. Techs working
in the room down
below.
Harry You think these N.A.S.A. guys are a bunch of clean-cut
pussies, that's
it. They can out think you, they can outrun you.
This job, gentlemen, is as real
as it gets. I need every one of
you.
(he looks them in the eye)
If you're not up to it,
then walkout of that door.
Finally. Theo and Pearl, frustrated, go to the TWO-WAY MIRROR,
blocking Jimbo
from view.
Theo I'm hungry! When're we gonna eat?
Pearl I have p.m.s.!! I need some ibuprofen!
Jimbo grabs Randy's legal pad and writes:
HELP!! BIG ASTEROID GOING TO HIT EARTH. COORDINATES 712 BY 345.
Randy stares at the message.
Randy Okay, I'm done here!
The door opens. Two F.B.I. AGENTS lead Randy out. Jimbo looks at
Theo and Pearl.
Jimbo He flunked the bar three times.
-- Harry shows Quincy his DRAWINGS of the DRILLING ARM - the way
Harry wants it.
-- Harry, A.J. and Quincy work with the TURBO PROP ENGINE,
transforming it into
a JET FUEL GENERATOR.
Quincy We'll run your liquid oxygen from the shuttle through a
tube into the
intake manifold. No problem.
A.J. I figured out how to bring up the slag. Direct the jet
turbine's exhaust
down the drill pipe. It'll blow the stuff
right up the hole.
Harry Good, A.J. Good.
-- Chick, Bennie, Bear, Jumbo welding new pieces of the DRILLING
ARM together.
The Roughnecks have changed. Chick and Bennie now
have crew-cuts.
-- A.J., Harry, Max and Tito build the drilling arm.
A.J. descend to the tank's bottom. Harry, Chick, Bennie, Max and
Tito are in
bulky white pressure suits. Jimbo and Bear wear the
largest pressure suits ever
made. They talk through their helmet
radio links.
One drilling arm starts turning. The Roughnecks turn toward a
STACK OF 20 FOOT
LONG STAINLESS STEEL DRILLING PIPES on the
tank's bottom. ABOVE WATER - SIDE OF
TRAINING TANK
Golden hits a stopwatch.
Golden
(into intercom)
Go.
Bear and Jimbo grab a pipe string and handle onto the mock-up
drill arm. They
clamp it on. Bennie and Chick screw a drill bit
onto the pipe string. They are
good, very good. The work with
the manic intensity of a pit crew at Indy.
Harry Done!
ABOVE WATER - SIDE OF TANK
Golden hits his stopwatch. Smiles. The N.A.S.A. Brass is
impressed.
Golden These guys are fast. Harry, interior gauge check.
Harry We're on A.J.
A.J. Let's see what this baby can do.
Harry and A.J. move the Armadillo's AIRLOCK DOOR. It has an
exterior open/close
button. Harry punches it. The side door
opens. Harry enters, then A.J.
Harry and A.J., still underwater, climb inside. Harry presses the
PRESSURIZATION
button. Simulating pressurisation in space, the
water in the cab is blown out,
and air WHOOSHES IN.
Harry and A.J. sit dripping in the watertight cab. Through the
front window WE
SEE the other Roughnecks in the tank. Harry
unlocks his neck seals. Pulls off
his helmet.
Harry Lose the helmet, A.J.
A.J. snaps out of it. His hands go instinctively to the helmet
and in one
motion...CLICK. It's off.
Harry
(clicks radio)
We're in. Run the simulation.
The interior PRESSURE GUGE NEEDLES and MONITORS
(engine torque, drill direction,
etc.)
start bobbing. The drill starts to cut into a BLOCK OF CONCRETE.
Golden
(V.O)
How's she look?
Harry Torque adjuster's good. Fuel level good. A.J., downhole
pressure?
A.J. We can do better. I'm increasing the RPM's to seven
thousand. We can get
more torque.
Golden
(V.O)
Negative, A.J. Don't exceed ix thousand. Not on this run.
A.J. Relax. I built this thing. She's got more in her. Increasing
the RPM's.
Golden
(V.O)
Negative, A.J. A.J. increases the RPM's. The gauge starts to
rise. The N.A.S.A. Brass shifts
uneasily in their seats. They're
not accoutomed to seeing their astronauts
disobey orders.
Golden
(V.0)
(cont'd)
A.J., shut the Armadillo down now
A.J. We can push it, further. Let's see what she can do.
Suddenly, the RPM''s shoot into the red. A red siren spins in the
control room.
The Armadillo SHAKES violently. The DRILLING BIT
grinds to nothing. The
Armadillo BLOWS a tranny.
Harry's eyes close. He's pissed.
IN THE CONTROL ROOM
The N.A.S.A. Brass looks to Golden. One of them shakes their
head. Sharp and
Golden exchange a look. Sharp shakes his head.
INSIDE THE TANK
A.J. presses a button and the cabin, simulating
"depressurisation" in space,
begins to fill with water.
Everyone around him just watches, as A.J. climbs out of the tank.
After a
minute, A.J. looks up, sees all the eyes in the room on
him.
Harry and A.J. stand in the centre of a high-tech supply room.
SPARE PARTS from
shuttles, PROTOTYPES and WORK TOOLS are
everywhere.
Harry You tell me what the hell you think you're doing?
A.J. I'm trying to work with the team.
Harry Bullshit. You're trying to lead this team. You're trying to
be me.
You're not me.
A.J. What do you want? You want me to quit?
Harry If you can't bury this cowboy shit, yeah, I want you to
quit.
A.J. I don't have to prove anything to anybody, Harry.
Harry I listen to N.A.S.A., you listen to me. That's the chain.
Either you
follow it, or you're done.
A.J. I'll follow it.
Harry I stood up for you, because I've made a life of proving
people wrong.
Harry's hand slides down to the medal hanging from his neck.
Harry
(cont'd)
When I was about your age, I was in Galveston, Texas. I scraped
together some money, bought some old equipment, a little land. I
set up a rig
and drilled my first hole. Then I sat there and
watched her soak up the sun for six
months - waiting for this
baby to pop. Everybody told me to quit. I wouldn't
listen. My
wife ran off with a drill-rigger, left me with Grace. Everybody
in town thought I
was a fool. But I stayed with it. And in the
last hour of the last day, she
popped. She spit out that black
gold and I danced in it like a wild Indian.
(reflective )
I
captured the magic
(holding medal)
This is the last piece of pipe that struck
gold that day.
Harry takes off the medal. Sets it on the table. He grabs a
cutting vice and
cuts the medal in two perfect halves. He hands
one half to A.J.
Harry
(cont'd)
Here, take it up there.
QUICK MONTAGE
Inside the neutral buoyancy tank -- Harry's crew goes through all
DRILLS one
final time
(final mission checks)
in quick succession. Everything runs
perfectly. The Armadillo
is rebuilt and shown functioning without error. A.J.
works as
part of the team.
The hour of the mission. The two teams sit in the orange N.A.S.A.
flight
pressure suits. Golden enters and stands before the room.
Golden In the book of Revalations, the Bible speaks of a final
day on Earth,
when all mankind shall perish, shall cease to
exist. This day is known as
Armageddon.

Right
now, that day conflicts with six billion schedules.

I've been with N.A.S.A. my entire adult life.
Eleven years as
an astronaut, another fifteen on the ground at Mission Control.
Twenty-six years I've had
to answer one question -- why? Why
more money? Why the race for
space? Why do we need to know what
is up there?
(beat)
When we come through
this, I'll take
comfort in the fact that
I won't ever have to answer those
questions again. You are our
warriors up there. You are our last hope. God be

The crew stands......
Harry exits the elevator and start to walk to the CATWAL to the
Freedom shuttle.
Harry carries his suitcase.
N.A.S.A. Tech 1 Sir, was that case authorised for transport?
N.A.S.A. Tech 2 Our weight to fuel ratio's calibrated to the

How much does that weigh?
Harry Sixty pounds.
N.A.S.A. Tech 1 That can't go up with you, sir.
Harry Wait here.
Harry enters the cabin. N.A.S.A.'s crack seven-member "Strap-in-

work. Harry's crew are outfitted with their
HELMETS and CHUTE PACKS. Each step
is methodical, each piece of
equipment is checked and rechecked.
Harry Hey you. Yeah you. Come here.

Would you prefer an appetiser or aperitif?
Through the cockpit window, the BLUENESS of Earth's atmosphere
becomes the
BLACKNESS of space.
Clark Freedom, Independence. You're looking good. Prepare to
start docking
procedures at the MIR.
Sharp addresses the crews of both shuttles over the radio --
Sharp Listen up -- the MIR will be spinning to give us gravity so
we can work
faster. You might feel queasy or dizzy. We'll dock,
transfer the fuel, then
detach from the MIR.
Fast and safe.
This stuff is very volatile.
Lev is working feverishly, running highly insulated liquid oxygen

Bennie Looks like you have a lot of free time on your hands.
Lev Yeah. I alone by myself.
Watts comes into the room. The first woman Lev has seen in a

A.J. runs through another corridor, heading for the docking port
as the walls
around him POP! Lev files around the corner almost
smashing into A.J.
The smoking circuitry SPARKS, and the REAR MODULE explodes in a
VIOLENT
CONCUSSION, LAUNCHING A LONG TONGUE OF FLAME into --
MODULES
Harry and Chick race for the DOCKING MODULE as -- BEHIND THEM, A
SECOND MODULE
fills with FIRE and EXPLODES, rocking the MIR.
Then a third. Fire starts to RIP
THROUGH corridors in the MIR.
Everything is SIDEWAYS. Lev is KNOCKED to the ground. A HEAVY
COMPUTER BOARD
falls, separating A.J. and Lev.
Attempting to reach A.J., Lev turns back and runs from where he
just came.
A.J. looks left, then right. He doesn't know how to get to the
docking port. He
starts running.
Sharp re-joins Bennie and Truman. They unhook the FUEL LINES to
the shuttles.
Sharp and Chick run aboard Shuttle Freedom. Truman
boards Independence.
A.J. is at the corridor fork. Right or left? The Russian writing
above both
paths doesn't help. Just as he's about to go left --
Lev suddenly appears, grabs
A.J., and PUSHES HIM into the RIGHT
CORRIDOR.
Lev Run Yankee!
Sharp
(to Watts as he sits and buckles up)
Shut the doors and fire her up!
Watts We still have people out there.
Sharp It's them or ALL OF US. CLOSE THE DOORS NOW!
As the doors are closing, Harry and Chick rush into Shuttle
Freedom. Harry's
fingers grab the doors just in time. The doors
retract back.
Harry Did A.J. make it?
Chick I didn't see him.
Truman buckles himself in, fires up the Independence.
Freedom is fired up. The MIR shudders again. TILTS further.
Sharp We have to GO!
A.J. and Lev are running hard as DEBRIS falls behind them and the
walls start to
TEAR APART. They turn a corner, headed toward the
docking port --
Harry is at the door, eyes frantically searching for A.J. --
Sharp WE GO NOW!
Sharp stabs a button on his pilot console. The AUTOMATED DOORS
BEGIN to slide
shut.
Truman stabs a button on his pilot console. The AUTOMATED DOORS
BEGIN to slide
shut.
A.J. and Lev race into the docking port from a rear corridor.
Harry sees them.
Lev dives into Independence just as the doors
close. A.J. dives head-long
through the shutting Independence
doors.
Sharp
(to Watts)
Full thrusters!
A.J. sits panting on the floor of the shuttle next to the docking
port door. Lev
stares down at him.
Lev I am Cosmonaut Lev Andropov, what your name?
A.J. My name is A.J.
Lev You just blew up my home.
SUPER -
TWENTY THREE HOURS TO THE MOON
Golden and Sharp sitting around going over data. New images of
the closer,
meaner asteroid approaching.
Interior small sleeping area. Max hanging upside-down in zero
gravity. Wakes up
yawning. He looks to Bear.
Max Oh, man, did I have a dream.
Bear So did Martin Luthor King.
Max No, this was a bad dream. We were drilling and the ground ate
the bit.
Then it ate the pipe, then the derrick. Then it ate us.
Bear That's a dumb-ass dream.
Max I'm not coming home.
They look at each other.
Harry, Bear, Chick, and Sharp stand looking out the cockpit rear
window toward
the brilliant blue Earth.
Bear What are you thinking about, Chick?
Chick My kid. You.
Bear My Mom, she'd be proud to see me as an astronaut.
Chick Harry, what are you thinking?
Harry
(looking at Earth)
How beautiful it is. Thinkin' about all that oil I
sucked out
and spit into the air.Funny how a man can live 46 years and
realize
he ain't been doing the right thing.
BEHIND A CURTAIN - Golden confers with Collinswood.
Collinswood The President is counting on you to put out the fire,
Dan. Say
whatever you have to. Just do it.
Golden walks from behind the curtain. Walks up to the podium, ten
VIDEO CAMERAS
swivel into position.
For a long moment Golden just stands there, saying nothing.
Golden I work for the President of the United States.
(long pause; looks over
at Collinswood)
But I think it's my duty as a scientist to tell the world what
is happening. Three,
days ago a manned space mission was sent to
intercept an asteroid
which has entered the Earth's orbit.
(REPORTERS all chatter)
This is a difficult
mission. In all
frankness, it is the most
difficult mission anyone has ever flown.
(beat)
A little over fifty years ago we sent our Armed Forces half-way
around
the world to save the
world from an evil empire that
threatened mass extinction. The men
and women of this nation
united, answered the calland preserved our freedom.
(beat)
Once again
we face a threat to our way of life. And once again
we look to our
military to preserve our future. The men and
women selected to lead this mission
are America's
finest and
most decorated career officers in the military. Our
hopes and
prayers are with them. Thank you.
Golden walks off. The REPORTERS CLAMOR
Reporters
(UNISON)
Director Golden! DIRECTOR GOLDEN!
BACKSTAGE - Golden approaches Collinswood.
Collinswood Golden, your drillers better not let us down.
Golden We'll do your best.
Watts
(unbelieving)
My goodness, look at that thing....
Sharp We have visual of target, Houston. Velocity thirty-three
hundred miles
an hour.
Clark sits with Techs Flip and Skip. Golden and Temple pace
behind the console.
Harry, Chick, Bear, and Max finish buckling into their seat
restraints and
harnesses.
A.J., Lev, Bennie, Jimbo and Tito buckle on harnesses. Bennie
looks at A.J.
nervously.
THE LUNAR SURFACE completely fills the cockpit windshield. We've
lost sight of
the oncoming asteroid.
Sharp Visual contact with target lost, Houston.
IN THE REAR CABIN - Harry, Chick, Bear, and Max stare in awe at
the
ever-approaching Moon.
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD - THE LUNAR SURFACE is only 150 miles
down, looking close
enough to reach down and touch.
Clark
(into headset)
How we doin', Freedom, over?
Watts Nearing the Dark Side, Houston, a minute thirty and
counting.
Skip Twenty seconds till we lose radio contact, Director.
Clark You're on your own, Willie. You've got to raise your
velocity 17
thousand miles an hour or you won't catch the
target, over.
Sharp See you on the other side, Houston.
Skip
(V.O)
Entering Dark Side, Freedom, and counting: ten, nine, eight,
seven...
Skip Radio contact terminated.
The radio crackles with STATIC. ON THE TECHNICIAN'S CONSOLES, all
of Freedom's
and Independence's COMPUTERIZED SYSTEM MONITORS
(pressurization, oxygen,
electrical power, fuel capacity, etc.)
GO DEAD.
Golden They'll be pullin' nine and half G's for eleven minutes,
General.
Temple Anyone done that before?
Flip Yeah. That Russian monkey in 1957.
Clark We'll pick 'em up again in sixteen minutes, Danny.
Golden If they're still alive.
The radio is STATIC.
Watts Rockets ready for burn, Willie.
Sharp
(over shoulder to Harry and others)
Time to suck it up, people. Just
pretend you're on the big
roller coaster at Disneyland...
(mumbles under breath)
...times a
hundred....
Sharp reaches for the BOOSTER ROCKET SWITCH. He gives Watts one
last look, then
throws the switch.
Harry, Chick, Bear, and Max get hit with the first G-Forces.
Their torsos press
back against their seats. They flex their
arms, breathing deeply, expanding
their chest cavities as they
were taught in training.
Harry I hate to fly, I hate to fly, I hate to fly....
A.J., Lev, Bennie, Jimbo, and Tito get slammed back by the first
wave of
G-Forces.
Watts reads her VELOCITY INDICATOR under G-Forces so bad she
speaks through
clenched teeth
Watts Fourteen thousand....sixteen thousand...twenty thousand
miles an hour,
Willie...!
Silence. Tension. Technicians stare at their consoles.
Clark They're hittin' the big G's right about...now.
Golden Come on, Willie, you can do this....
Excruciating, gut-wrenching, turn-your-intestines-inside-out G-
Forces. HARRY and
CHICK'S FACIAL MUSCLES distort hideously;
their rubbery cheeks and lips flatten
out. They continue anti-G
exercises, tensing every muscle, trying to keep blood
flow
evenly distributed.
A.J. and Bennie's distorted faces, likewise, go through the anti
G-Force
exercises, tensing every muscle.
Continued STATIC on the radio. Everyone sits nervously waiting.
Suddenly the
shuttles' computerised SYSTEM MONITORS begin to
click back on.
Clark Freedom, come in, over. Independence, come in, over.
Nothing. Golden grabs the mike.
Golden Willie? Come in, over. Willie, can you hear me...?
Total silence. A pin could drop. The N.A.S.A. Technicians stare
nervously at the
Central Board.
Then, suddenly through static
Sharp
(V.0)
Houston, you gotta see this to believe it....
Elation. Held breaths are exhaled. Golden and N.A.S.A.
TECHNICIANS smile. No one
is more relieved than Grace.
Sharp and Watts stare through the windshield at --
THE ASTEROID, below them and dead ahead. We get our first
(and only temporary)
clear glimpse of the designated landing field, a relatively
smooth, unobstructed
plane on the asteroid's surface.
Harry is green, looks like he's gonna blow chunks.
Sharp We're awake, we're not pukin'....
(looks over shoulder at Harry)
....well, Harry is. And we got a clear path to the target.
Houston, over.
Truman smiles.
Truman Copy that, Freedom.
Clark gives Golden a thumbs up.
Clark We'll take you in, guys.
In one terrifying second, visibility is cut to twenty feet. Then
BANG! BANG!
BANG! BANG!
PEBBLES and SMALL ICE CHUNKS strike the windshield, chipping and
denting it. The
impacts are violent; the interior is buffeted
around. It's the space equivalent
of bad hailstorm.
Sharp Damn it....!
Clark
(V.O)
What is it, Willie?
Sharp Problem, Houston. We've got debris all over us!
REAR OF COCKPIT - Harry and the others, alarmed, are buffeted
around violently.
No visibility here either. Ice chunks and pebbles BANG against
the windshield.
Truman I've got no visibility. I've lost orientation to the
target!
Suddenly, as sudden as it came, the debris clears.
But a HUGE ICE BOULDER the size of a three-story building twirls
into
Independence's path. It hits a BOULDER which collides with
another.
Truman Big guy! Dead ahead!
Truman stabs his directional thruster button. Shuttle
Independence veers to the
right....
Sharp hits his directional thruster, and Freedom veers to the
left....
Truman
(panicked)
I lost left thruster! No control! I have no control!
In the Independence's cargo bay, one of the Armadillos RIPS free
from its
moorings and plunges through the CARGO BAY DOORS.
Sharp steers Freedom past the ice boulder.
Watts Where's the other ship....?!
Suddenly the Independence, with a RIPPED OPEN CARGO BAY DOOR,
careens directly
across Freedom's path, filling Freedom's
cockpit window, nearly colliding with
her.
Sharp hits his thrusters, veering away from the damaged
Independence.
Sharp and Watts watch Independence twirling toward the asteroid.
Suddenly
BANG!!!
The INDEPENDENCE'S ERRANT ARMADILLO strikes the Freedom's nose,
spider-webbing
the WINDSHIELD. Sharp and Watts recoil in terror.
Watts SCREAMS.
The fuselage is spinning. A.J., Bennie and the others are in
terror. In the
cockpit, Truman SCREAMS over the radio
Truman Houston, MAYDAY, MAYDAY, we're going down!
The Shuttle's roof collides with a rock. We hear SCRAPING METAL.
The CEILING
dents in, dislodging INTERIOR CEILING PANELS filled
with wires and electrical
components; they rain down on A.J. and
the others.
Choas. The SPARKING CABIN fills with smoke.
Truman Crew, go to life support!
Everyone grabs for their HELMET, frantically trying to get them
on. A.J. gets
his on, but he can't lock his neck seal. He
fidgets with the little SEAKL LOCKS.
A.J. rips off the helmet. It slips from his fingers and floats
off through the
zero-g cabin!
A.J. Goddamn it!
A.J. throws off his seat harnesses and goes after his helmet. In
zero-gravity,
the sides of the twirling cockpit revolve around
A.J. as he moves.
We hear a CACOPHONY OF VOICES and BANGING ROCKS against
Independence's fuselage.
Truman MAYDAY, HOUSTON, MAYDAY....!!
Golden and the N.A.S.A. personnel can only sit and listen,
horrified, impotent
to do anything.....
AT THE BACK OF THE CABIN - A.J. reaches his helmet and
frantically gets it back
on. The fuselage is still twirling
around him.
Bennie, strapped in and freaking out, throws off his seat harness
and bolts for
the SAFETY EMERGENCY HATCH equipped with EXPLOSIVE
RELEASE CHARGES.
Truman sees Bennie at the Emergency Hatch. BIG ROCKS smash off
the windshield in
front of Truman; the windshield's safety glass
is weakened, splintered, to the
point of bursting.
Truman Get away from that door!!!!
Bennie is wild-eyed, crazed.
Bennie Go to hell, man, I ain't dyin' on this thing!!!!
A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS
A ROCK SMASHES through the windshield, gouging into Truman.
Depressurisation.
Truman and Co-pilot Weston are sucked out
through the windshield.
Bennie BLOWS the Emergency Hatch's explosive charges. The hatch
door pulls
Bennie out into space...to his death.
FLASH CUTS Independence's System Monitors flash off
PRESSURIZATION goes to
zero; CABIN OXYGEN goes to zero;
INDIVIDUAL LIFE SUPPORT MONITORS go to zero.
Independence's radio transmissions are STATIC and PANICKED
VOICES. Golden runs
down the aisle to Independence's monitors.
Skip No cabin pressure! Systems-wide failure!
Harry and the Roughnecks are SMASHED around in their seats.
IN THE COCKPIT - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
A BOULDER the size of a house looms downslope. Shuttle Freedom is
skidding
straight for it.
Sharp and Watts watch helplessly as the Shuttle skids toward the
boulder.
Harry and the others JOLT to a stop. No one moves. No one
breathes. It's scary
as hell.
wait
breathlessly for some response. Golden GRABS the mike.
Golden Freedom. come in.
(no response)
Independence, come in . no response)
Come in, Freedom.
Nothing. Skip buries his face in his hands. Flip chews his
pencil. Golden,
having lost one crew already, twists his wedding
ring.
Sharp
(V.O)
Houston, it's Freedom. We just landed on this son-of-a-bitch,
over.
Golden and the Technicians breath a sigh of relief.
Watts
(V.O)
What's the status of Independence?
CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HARRY, as he waits for Houston's response to
this last
question.
Sharp
(V.O)
We lost her.
CAMERA TIGHT ON HARRY. He's lost men before, many men on oil
rigs. But not
A.J.....
Chick
(O.S.)
Harry, Harry, Jesus Christ, this can't happen....
Harry snaps out of it, turns to Chick.
Harry It did happen. They're gone. Deal with it. We got a lot of
work to do.
Harry unharnesses himself and rises.
Golden looks at Grace. She looks back. A tear slides off her
cheek to the
console. Harry's daughter doesn't say a word, or
break down. She just quietly
rises and walks to the back of the
room. Grace rubs her bare ring finger. A
BEAT.
CAMERA SPIES the ZERO BARRIER CLOCK. Seven hours, 52 minutes, 000
feet drilled.
Chick, Bear, and Max prepare to disembark, donning helmet and
glove assemblies,
clicking neck and wrist seals into locking
position.
Harry comes into the cockpit. Watts is flipping switches and
reading gauges.
Sharp's on the radio. A haze fills the cockpit.
Watts Engine ignition system isn't responding.
INTERCUT - FREEDOM/ MISSION CONTROL
Golden What's the problem?
Flip Engine ignition. Starting diagnostics.
Sharp Houston, I don't know where we are. Tell me how far we
overshot Harry's
sweep spot. Advise on currant location, over.
Skip motions to Golden and Clark. They hurry over to his console.
On Skip's
computer screen is a MAP OF THE ASTEROID containing
its geological fault lines.
Skip They overshot their landing 26 miles. There's a different
fault line, but
it's deeper.
Golden How much deeper?
Skip Two hundred feet.
Golden exchanges a look with Temple.
Golden Harry, your fault line's fifty yards off the starboard
side.
Harry stalks to the rear.
Harry Rockhound.
Rockhound Yes, sir.
Harry I'm gonna get you some surface samples and you're gonna
tell me what I'm
up against.
Rockhound Rocks are my life.
Watts Willie, we might be stuck.
Sharp exchanges grim looks with Pitts and Fisk over this bad
information.
Harry The good news just keeps comin'. Load up, guys.
Sharp watches Harry and the guys exit to the rear.
Chick, at the Armadillo's controls, engages gears.
Sharp, Watts, Pitts and Fisk have a PANEL removed, exposing the
guts of
Freedom's wiring and components. Watts and Sharp are
inside the panel, scrunched
against the fuselage wall, unbolting
a large COMPONENT. Watts hands Pitts and
Fisk a SMALLER
COMPONENT.
Watts Unbolt the housing. There and there.
The rock CHIPS spew into the COLLECTOR in front of ROCKHOUND.
Harry looks on.
Harry What do you make of that?
Rockhound picks up several chips. Draws them close to his eyes.
Rockhound Oh my. Oh my, my, my. This isn't rock. It's uhh, it's
uhh,
it's......iron.
Harry Iron deposit?
Rockhound
(shakes head)
No. It's been melted. Forged rather. I've only seen
this once -
at a volcano in Hawaii.
(looks up at Harry)
You're drilling into a
big slab of cast-iron, Mr. Stamper.
Harry picks up the radio.
Harry Give me Dan Golden.
INTERCUT - MISSION CONTROL / FREEDOM
Golden's handed the phone.
Golden Yeah, Harry. What's your situation?
INTERCUT - GOLDEN AND TEMPLE IN MISSION CONTROL / HARRY ON
FREEDOM
Harry Situation? You put me down on the worst possible place on
this asteroid.
I'm drillin' into something I shouldn't. The hole
just ate one of my
diamond-tipped bits in thirty minutes. That
has never happened to me in twenty years.
Golden You're forty minutes in. You should be down 150 feet. How
far are you?
Harry Not far.
(beat)
Twenty-three feet.
CLOSE ON Golden as he looks at Temple.
Temple This is an exercise in futility.
Golden
(to Harry)
"Don't tell me what you can't do, tell me what you can."
Remember that, Stamper? Go faster.
Harry We will.
Golden How?
Sharp and Pitts enter. Fisk hands Sharp the phone.
Sharp Sharp, over.
PUSH IN on Sharp in EXTREME CLOSE-UP. His jaw tightens. His eyes
dart.
Sharp
(cont'd)
Sir, the bird can't fly.
Temple
(V.O.)
Well, you need to get it fixed unless you want to die along with
that asteroid.
A LONG PAUSE, as Sharp listens.
Sharp :
(cont'd)
Yes, sir.
Temple
(V.O.)
And, I don't want those drillers knowing about this. They have
enough to worry about just drilling the damn ole.
Collinswood
(V.O.)
Colonel Sharp, this is Chief of Staff Collinswood. Have
Pitts
and Fisk prepare to detonate that nuke on the surface. Too many
lives are
at stake here. Have them standing by.
Sharp On your order sir.
CAMERA moves through the wreckage of Independence. Nightmarish.
EMERGENCY LIGHTS
still on battery flicker. The shattered
windshield; the blown emergency hatch; A
CORPSE lies face down,
helmet half on, half off; Independence's huge tubular
NUCLEAR
DEVICE.
Something moves on the ceiling. REVEAL A.J. hanging upside down,
caught in the
twisted fuselage skin. A.J. cuts himself down. He
twirls to the ground. Sees
LEGS MOVING UNDER RUBBLE.
A.J. throws off the rubble, revealing Lev, dazed but alive. A.J.
helps him to
his feet.
Lev What happened to the others....
A.J. and Lev move toward the cockpit.
A.J.
(grabs the radio)
Freedom, come in, over. Freedom, come in, over....
Freedom...?
(shaking head)
It's you and me.
A.J. smashes the radio in frustration.
Harry Why don't we cut to the chase, fellahs? What the fuck is
going on with
that other nuke?
Harry stares at the nuclear weapon.
Sharp Stamper, if you can't drill the hole, we're detonating this
thing on the
surface....
Chick and the guys eye each other. Harry walks off, pissed
off....
Golden and Clark are hunched over monitors. Two MILITARY AIDES
carrying a
NUCLEAR COMMAND LINK
(FOOTBALL)
SUITCASE.
Golden, alarmed, tries to figure out what they have.
Chick, Bear and Max enter through the airlock. Everyone turns and
stares at
Sharp.
Sharp There's no way in hell you're gonna get that hole dug, and
you know it.
Harry Well, it wasn't my scientists that told me about the
fucking fire
cracker inside the hand story. Are we detonating on
the surface or are we gonna
drill?
Bear I didn't come up here to die.
Chick I say we drill. They say we have until Zero Barrier.
Sharp
(freaked out)
That hole better be dug in two hours, or we're detonating.
Whether you're on this godforsaken rock or not!
Harry We're drilling.
Harry and his crew file out.
Golden
(to Temple)
What is going on up there?
Temple Your drillers aren't doing the job, Dan.
Golden After 15 minutes? What do you expect?
Temple Golden, we are preparing for surface detonation.
Golden A surface detonation isn't going to do it, General. My
scientists have
already told you that. It must be detonated
inside the asteroid. The alternative
is that the Earth
will be
bombarded by smaller matter which will be just as
catastrophic.
Temple stares off pensively into the sky.
Temple We have a lot better chance of surviving the "smaller
matter." The
drillers have two hours
(to the Aides)
I want you ready on my command.
The Adjutants prepare the nuclear command link.
Military Adjutant Sir, we have interface with the weapon. Remote
detonator
standing by.
Lev is sitting on the ground, head in his hands, completely
demoralised.
Lev I feel like Skywalker Luke when he learn Darth Vader his
father. What I
should do?
A.J. Get up, we got work to do.
Lev A.J., let me cash in my chips.
A.J. Lev, we're getting off this rock, if I have to drag your ass
the whole
way.
(off Lev's look)
Now get up!
A.J. walks into the Independence cargo bay, detached from the
nose section. Then
climbs into Independence's Armadillo.
A.J. C'MON LEV, PUT YOUR WEIGHT INTO IT!
Golden turns to Temple.
Golden The asteroid's surface is heating up.
Temple What does that mean?
Golden It means they may not be able to work on the surface for
much longer.
The temperatures will be unbearable.
Temple Golden, tell your drillers the clock is ticking. I have 6
billion
people down here relying on them!
In the b.d. hangs a crayon drawing of sunny day by Temple's
daughter.
Temple
(cont'd)
A lot of people are die....
The ARMADILLO blasts through the cargo bay door. A.J. and Lev
roll off away from
the Independence.
A.J. cranes his neck looking out through the Armadillo. A RIDGE
with THRE TALL
SPIRES is in the distance, ringed with LIGHT from
Freedom's FLOOD LIGHTS.
A half-smile from A.J hope.
Sharp comes back from the cockpit, carrying the detonator.
Harry's on the phone
to Golden.
Harry ...You told me that the only way to deal with this hunk 'o
crud is to
get a nuke 1000 feet down. You sticking with that?
Golden
(V.O.)
Firmly.
Harry Great. Glad we have that understanding.
Golden
(V.O.)
IF you're gonna pull this off, we have to have a little talk
about time...and temperature. Zero Barrier's in two hours.
Harry Wait...wait..what about temperature? When did temperatures
come into the
picture?
Golden
(V.O.)
Harry, your suits are good upto 150 degrees Celsius....
Harry And...? How hot is it going to get?
Golden
(V.O.)
We didn't anticipate you being on the asteroid so long. The
clock is ticking...
Harry How hot is it going to get?!
Golden
(V.O.)
Three hundred and fifty degrees.
Harry's face drops.
Harry Thanks for telling us now, Golden....I don't think my bits
can handle
those kind of temperatures....
Harry clicks off the radio.
Watts We've still gotta fix this shuttle, Stamper.
Harry Give me some more good news. You've got two new assistants
who can fix
your shuttle. Bear, Max, hop to it. There's not a
machine they can't fix. We can
handle the hole from here.
A.J. Over the hill.
Suddenly, the ground under the vehicle shakes sharply. A.J. stops
the Armadillo.
The ground around the vehicle heaves up and down. The GROUND
SPLITS. One
TECTONIC PLATE rises 15 feet in the air. The ground
breaks like a wave, up and
down.
Here, too, the ground shakes. Bear, terrified, drops a DRILL
PIPE. Max is shaken
to the ground.
Chick is nearly thrown off the Armadillo.
Chick Clear the rig!!!
Chick jumps down, bouncing. Everybody gets the hell away from the
drilling hole.
The asteroid shakes violently, throwing A.J. and Lev around the
cab. ROCKS BANK
down on the Armadillo's top and hood. The
ASTEROID SURFACE continues splitting
apart across the slope's
fall line.
A.J. EARTHQUAKE!
The asteroid RUMBLES a few more seconds, then the quake slowly
stops. All is
stll.
A.J.
(cont'd)
Let's take a look.
A.J. throws it in neutral. The Armadillo stops.
A.J. Hey, Lev, we're gonna see what this Porche engine can do....
He throws it in drive. The Armadillo lurches ahead.
-- A.J. punches the Armadillo's PRO-GRAVITY THRUSTER "OFF"
SWITCH.
A.J. punches the PRO-GRAVITY THRUSTER "START" SWITCH. Nothing....
The Armadillo continues lifting into space, from which there is
no return. A.J.
toggles the "start" switch. The swtich's
INDICATOR LIGHT FLICKERS.
A.J. HOLD ON, LEV, I GOT HER WORKIN'!!
A.J., lying sideways, keeps toggling the thruster START SWITCH.
The indicator
light finally FLASHES "IN" and A.J. rams it into
drive --
A.J., shaken, takes a deep breath and gets out.
Max finishes unbolting the BROKEN TRANSMISSION HOUSING. He passes
it to Chick
who dumps it on the surface. Sharp and Truman work
with Bear and Chick who feed
in the good transmission housing.
Max presses the airlock. The doors close and the cabin
pressurises. Max clicks
off his helmet. He begins installing the
transmission housing and the linkage.
Skip is analysing the asteroid's THERMAL READINGS. A MULTI-
COLORED THERMAL IMAGE
MAP shows most of the asteroid is GREEN
(no heat)
, but around the chosen landing
site are numerous RED SPOTS
(heat)
.
Skip Look at these thermals. This is BEFORE sunlight hits the
drill site.
She's really heating up....
Max is bolting. The DOWNHOLE PRESSURE GAUGE NEEDLE jolts. Max
doesn't see it. He
keeps working.
Max is furiously unbolting the TRANNY HOUSING. There are two
bolts to go. He
ratches one off....
Max I'm doin' it, I'm doin' it.
Max gets to the last bolt....
Harry
(V.O.)
Go Max, go Max, get the last bolt....!
Max gets the last bolt undone.
Max DONE!!
Max stares at the DOWNHOLE PRESSURE GAUGES, groping through the
compartment for
his helmet.
Max Pressure's through the roof! Shit, where's my helmet....!?
Max is thrown against a wall of the rear compartment.
Max is SLAMMED against the wall again. Terrified, he grabs for
his helmet and
locks the NECK SEALS.
Max, helmet on, is frantically scrambling to the airlock, but
there's no time...
Max I CAN'T DEPRESSURIZE!!
Max punches the DOOR LOCK without depressurising the cabin and is
sucked
violently out of the rear compartment into open space.
Skip motions to Golden. He comes over.
Skip They just lost the rig. The hole blew out.
Golden takes the news stoically. He thinks, looking across the
room at Temple.
He looks at the clock. ONE HOUR AND FORTY
MINUTES TO GO.
Golden Say nothing.
Golden stares at the wall. Grace is curled up on a chair in the
corner.
Harry
(V.O.)
We have good news folks. A.J. and the Russian just showed up. No
other survivors.
Grace shuts her eyes, smiling. Sobbing.
Skip looks at thermal readings with alarm.
Skip Dan, the surface is heating up!
All the TECHNICIANS stand, staring at the CENTRAL BOARD, where a
graph shows the
drilling progress.
Flip Nine hundred and eighty...Nine ninety...they're into the
fault, they're
doing it.
Golden looks at the CLOCK. THIRTY-ONE MINUTES TO GO. He twists
his wedding ring.
Golden Now just get the thing in the hole.
All the TECHNICIANS stare at their monitors. The atmosphere is
thick with
tension. Clark chews his nails.
Skip She's gettin' hotter! Gotta mean gas - methane, helium,
probably water
vapor.
Golden continues looking at the THERMAL IMAGING.
Golden Harry, c'mon, we got thirty minutes.
A.J, tied to a SAFETY TETHER, comes down the hole with a HAND-
HELD CUTTER and a
LENGTH OF ROPE. He reaches the obstruction.
The DRILL PIPE has been mashed,
bent, buckled. Severed ends stab
into the sides of the hole. A.J. starts cutting
with the hand-
held cutter.
The hole shakes. A.J. freezes, sweating.
Harry
(V.O.)
A.J., we need you. I need everything you got.
A.J. wrestles with the severed pipes, untangling them, tying the
ROPE to them.
He gives the rope a tug. Chick and Bear, above,
pull up the broken pipes.
A.J. experiences the DEEPEST, MOST SINISTER RUMBLE YET, emanating
form the
asteroid's core, something from hell. There's a
horrendous WHOOSHING SOUND.
A WINDSTORM OF PEBBLE, like a blowing tornado, whooshes up from
the hole,
smashing into A.J.'S FACESHIELD.
A.J. THIS SUCKS....
A.J. is whooshed violently out of the hole.
Golden addresses the room.
Golden The situation: the hole is drilled but the remote
detonator is not
functional. One of the crew is going to stay
behind and....
(deep breath)
...manually detonate the device.
Golden looks over at Grace. She is stunned. The news is just
sinking in.
Golden Don't stay for this.
Grace I'm not leaving.
Temple In 18 minutes we will be at Zero Barrier.
(to Grace)
Your father better
be a man of his word.
PAN FROM HARRY...to A.J. to...to Chick....to Lev...to Bear.
Everyone is huddled
inside the cabin.
The SMASHED REMOTE DETONATOR, a 2000-foot spool-drum of
ELECTRICAL WIRE and a
KNIFE sit on the table.
Sharp
(stoically)
I'd trade places with any one of you. But we need two people
to
fly this mother back. So, we either all stay or you guys draw.
Sharp raises a BUNDLE OF ELECTRICAL WIRES in his hand. The crew's
going to draw
straws. The highest tension yet. No one breathes,
no one moves.
Sharp Who's first?
(no response)
Clockwise then.
Sharp holds the WIRE STRAND BUNDLE in front of Lev.
Lev stares at it. He smiles nervously and reaches...and draws.
The strand is
LONG. Lev exhales. Next...
Chick, Chick stares at the bundle, sweating. He grabs a strand.
Pulls slowly.
LONG. He exhales. Next...
Bear. He stares at the bundle, thinking, choosing. He grabs and
pulls quickly,
decisively. LONG. Two strands remain, and two
men, Harry and A.J. It's A.J.'s
turn....
A.J. stares at the wire strands - not a bundle now. A.J. shifts
in his chair.
The matter will be decided on this last pull. A.J.
looks at Harry. They lock
eyes.
Harry Your turn.
A.J. I ain't gonna draw against you Harry.
Chick
(starts to get up)
I can't watch this.
Harry
(stern, hard)
Sit down, Chick.
Chick sits down. Harry looks at A.J.
Harry Draw.
A.J. stares at the two strands. Gets used to the idea. He reaches
and begins to
pull. Stops. Chooses the other strand. And pulls.
It is SHORT. A.J. stares at
the SHORT STRAND OF WIRE in his
hand. We see a fear on his face that gets
covered by a small
smile.
A.J. Well, I guess I won. Now I'm the guy who gets to save the
Earth.
A.J. takes off the half medallion. Harry takes off his half
medallion.
A.J. We said we'd join these after we drilled the hole. It just
ain't gonna be
on Earth.
They slide the two halves together to make a whole. Harry and
A.J. exchange a
long look.
Watts flips switches. Suddenly the jets ignite!
Watts Ignition! She's started!
Skip turns to Golden excitedly.
Skip They got Freedom goin'!
A.J. and Harry stand in the airlock, helmets on. Harry carries
the two thousand
foot spool-drum of wire. The airlock opens.
Harry and A.J. descend onto the
asteroid.
Golden looks at the CLOCK running down - ten thirty-three... Ten
thirty-two... Ten thirty-one...
A.J. explodes from the airlock into the cabin.
A.J. Goddamn it, HARRY....!
A.J. lunges for the airlock.
Sharp grabs A.J. with his good arm, helped by Bear..holding him
back.
A.J. LET ME GO....LET ME GO....!!
SHARP YOU HAVE NO OXYGEN...YOUR TUBES ARE RIPPED...LET IT
GO....!!
A.J., sobbing, furious, POUNDS on the AIRLOCK WINDOW, staring at
Harry outside.
A.J.
(pounding on the door)
HARRY!!
Harry turns and walks back to the drilling hole. Sharp looks at
him.
Sharp This guy really is a hero....
Skip Director? It's Mr. Stamper. He wants to talk to his
daughter.
Golden looks over at Grace. Their eyes meet....
A N.A.S.A. Tech hands Grace a mike and exits. She stares at the
static on the
monitor. Harry's face fades in and out. Grace
knows something is very wrong from
her father's strained, tired
face. She forces a smile. INTERCUT with Harry
inside the
Armadillo
Grace Daddy.
Harry
(V.O.)
Grace. I...
(sighs)
This is so hard for me. I don't have....
Tears start to well up in her eyes.
Harry
(V.O.)
(cont'd)
...I just....want you to know how much I love you.
Grace I'm so proud of you, Daddy.
Grace wipes a tear from her face.
Harry
(V.O.)
(looking at Earth)
It's so beautiful up here. So pure.
(swallows
hard)
I remember something I read once..."The world is a fine
place...and worth
fighting for."
looks at Earth, smiles)
Gracie, I'm just an iron-ass-warrior doin'
what's best.
(pause)
Take care of A.J. I'll look in on you from time to time....
Harry pulls off the video link. Grace's monitors go black. Grace
touches the
monitor, as Harry's face fades away.
Her knees buckle. She sinks to the floor.
Watts and Sharp settle into the cockpit and begin flipping
switches.
Sharp hits the THRUSTER SWITCH.
Nothing happens. He HITS it again. Again.
Watts unbuckles and goes to the ENGINE IGNITION SYSTEM.
The timer continues counting down to one thirty-four... One
thirty-three... One thirty-two...
Skip The thrusters are down! 32 seconds.
The timer counts 23...22...21.
Watts is frantically adjusting the FUEL MODULATOR'S VALVES...
Sharp Watts, we gotta get that thing going!
Watts THE INTERIORR VALVE'S STUCK!
Lev crowds in next to her.
Watts
(cont'd)
(to Lev)
BACK OFF!! YOU DON'T KNOW THIS COMPONENT!!
Lev backs off. Keeps looking at the modulator, curiously.
IN THE COCKPIT - the Timer reads 10...9...9...SHARP keeps hitting
the THRUSTER
SWITCH.
Golden paces. Technicians stare pessimistically at consoles.
Golden Stamper, you gave me your word. You have five seconds.
PRESS THE
BUTTON!
Temple
(V.O.)
Sharp, I NEED A SOLUTION!
BACK TO LEV , Watts and Sharp.
Sharp Sir with all due respect, if I knew the PROBLEM, I'd give a
SOLUTION,
SIR..!
Temple Well, find a solution!!
Lev
(to Watts)
WE HAVE JUST THE SAME SHIT PART IN RUSSIA!! SOMETIMES IT NOT
WORK SO WE HIT!! YOU GOTTA GIVE IT WHACK!! WHACK!! HIT!!
Watts WHAT!!?
Lev GIVE IT WHACK!!
Lev grab a wrench and goes ballistic. SMASHES it down on the
component, AGAIN
and AGAIN and AGAIN. We hear JET FUEL COURSE
through the component and --
-- SHARP hits the IGNITION SWITCH and the THRUSTERS FIRE.
Sharp, Watts, A.J., Lev and Bear watch Harry becoming smaller and
smaller on the
asteroid.
Harry falls ass-first down the hole, his PRO-GRAVITY THRUSTERS
pushing him
further and further down. Harry's FINGERS GOUGE into
the walls of the hole. He
scissors his legs. HIS BOOTS scrape
the sides. He begins climbing up out of the
hole....We see that
his air has been punctured. He's losing pressure. He starts
to
choke.
They've ascended to a safe distance.
Sharp Something's wrong.
A.J. Don't worry. He'll come through.
Sharp We should have detonation by now.
A.J. Harry doesn't fail.
Sharp We're going back.
A.J. What?
Sharp Every life, that you know, will die....unless that nuke is
detonated.
WE MOVE DOWN the faces of the terrified men, looking down on the
craggy
asteroid....
Chick
(unsure)
That means we might die too....
Sharp Watts, prepare for re-landing. NOW!!
Watts, frozen with fear, begins hitting switches.
The detonation ROCKS the cabin. Everyone's violently buffeted
around.
Watts Houston, we have detonation!
Watts fumbles for the reverse switches as the flames from the
explosion grow
CLOSER....She hits the directional THRUSTERS,
jamming it as hard as it will
go...the flames bite up at them.
The shuttle veers off toward Earth.
A.J. Harry....
A.J. and the others stare out the cockpit window as the NUCLEAR
FISSION
EXPLOSION FLAMES OUT, the halves of the asteroid wing
off.
Grace is quietly weeping.
THE ASTEROID'S DETONATION is computer-imaged on the Central
Board. WE SEE the
ASTEROID'S TWO HALVES, moving in new
directions. The Technicians stare in
wonderment.
Golden Where are they, Flip? Give me some angles, give me some
directions,
give me speeds...
Flip
(analysing new data)
The new courses are....they're gonna miss us!
The Technicians CHEER. Grace looks up. Wipes her tears. Golden
approaches her.
Golden I just want to tell you I'm proud to know the daughter of
the man who
just saved the world.
N.A.S.A.TEHNICIANS sit at consoles, exhausted. There are Coke
cans, coffee mugs,
cigarettes overflowing ashtrays. Jimbo, Theo
and Pearl, wearing V.I.P. VISITORS
BUTTONS, stand at the back.
Jimbo This definitely doesn't look like a glamorous job.
A.J., Chick and Bear unbuckle, begin to rise from seats.
Chick I'm dyin' for a Budweiser.
Sharp Stay seated. Let the medical quarantine trucks set up.
Bear I ain't gettin' another enema from Nurse Ratchet.
A.J., Chick and Bear look at each other.
A.J. What would Harry do?
Bear I think he'd go get a beer.
