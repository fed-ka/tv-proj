      FX SHOT: DMP - Establishing shot.  A big old house with
      large overgrown grounds surrounded by high fencing.  The
      place looks empty and semi-derelict.  There's a an old
      faded sign - ST JUDE'S HOSPITAL.  It's faded - over it has
      been nailed another sign - PRIVATE PROPERTY, KEEP OUT! 
      But even this has been hanging there for decades.

      There are a lot of Keep Out signs.

      But they don't deter GILL, a teenage girl.  With a glance
      around her, she is slipping through a gap in the fence,

      She's about 17, dressed in jeans and a biker's jacket.  No
      girly-girl.  She can clearly handle herself.  But she keeps
      low as she runs towards the derelict hospital, as if she's
      expecting someone to take a shot at her.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      It's a low-angle view of an alien landscape - the camera-
      view of a robot probe moving across the Martian surface.

                    beautiful morning on Mars today.

      surface temperature and the probe's Martian latitude and

      And we find SARAH JANE and CLYDE watching the Mars footage
      on MISTER SMITH's screen. It's a split screen, one side 
      shows the footage from NASA's PoV with numbers and text 
      etc, the other side the clean footage direct from the probe 
      to Mister Smith.

                    Well done, Mister Smith.

      And then the other half of the screen blanks out too.

                    Looks like NASA just lost yet

      GILL is running - looks almost fit to drop.  The look of
      someone being hunted.

      Behind her, the MEN IN BLACK led by MISTER DREAD pursue
      her relentlessly. 

      She staggers as her ankle twists. She catches her breath. 
      Hopeless.

      MISTER DREAD calls to her.

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    Escape is not an option.

      Gill looks back at Mister Dread.  And she limps hurriedly
      around a corner...

                                                                              CUT TO


      GILL flattens herself against the wall.

      She snarls - but it's not a girl's voice -

                                      ANDROVAX
                    Human bodies!  Useless!

      FX SHOT: Gill shimmers - and out of her body slips ANDROVAX. 
      His clothes are covered in dried-on dirt.  He looks about
      him warily.  Gill's body lies unconscious on the ground.

      FX SHOT: Androvax's forked tongue flashes across his face.

      And he runs away - just as MISTER DREAD and the MEN IN
      BLACK arrive.

      Mister Dread takes a scanner from his pocket - passes it
      over Gill's body.

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    She is unconscious.  The Veil has
                    gone.

      Nearby ANDROVAX hiding in the undergrowth, panting. 
      Exhausted and weak.  Then moves off.

      MISTER DREAD takes in their surroundings through his dark

                    We will find him.

      Haresh's car pulls up outside their house.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      HARESH turns off the ignition.  He and GITA are in the
      middle of something -

                                      HARESH
                    Gita, they're called BURPSS. 
                    They're a bunch of windbags.

                                    GITA
                    Why do you refuse to believe what
                    you've seen with your own eyes?

                                      HARESH
                    I'm not denying aliens exist.  
                    But whatever they were doing here,
                    it was a one-off.  You're not going
                    to see them again.

      As Haresh turns to get out of the car - and Gita turns to
      see stealthy ANDROVAX across the road.

      She screams.

      Androvax runs out of sight into Sarah Jane's garden - as
      Haresh spins around to Gita.

                                      HARESH (CONT'D)
                    What's wrong?

                                      HARESH
                    Oh, yes.  Very funny.

      And he's getting out of the car.

                                                                              CUT TO


      And GITA is jumping out of the car, too.  Angry.  She pops
      the boot.  Confronting HARESH.

                                    GITA
                    It ran into Sarah's drive.

      She pulls a wheel brace from the boot - presses it into
      Haresh's hand.

                                    GITA (CONT'D)
                          (emphatic)

                                      HARESH
                    Me?  What about you?

      And there's the bang of the car door - we see Gita has
      locked herself in Haresh's car.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      HARESH walks into the drive.  He's not expecting to find
      anything.  And isn't intending to do more than take a quick
      look.

      But there's the snap of a twig.

      Haresh spins around.  Suddenly on edge.

      Hidden deep amid big, thick bushes, ANDROVAX watches...

                                      HARESH
                    Hello?  Is there anybody there?

      And Haresh thinks he sees something amid the bushes.

      Androvax's POV: Haresh coming towards him.

      As -

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Haresh?

      Haresh almost jumps out of his skin as Sarah Jane emerges
      from the front door - RANI and CLYDE with her.

                                    RANI
                    Dad?  What are you doing?

      In the bushes, Androvax pulls back deeper into the shadows.

      Haresh is more than a little embarrassed.

                                      HARESH
                    I'm sorry.  Gita thought she'd
                    seen someone suspicious.

                                      CLYDE
                    And you thought they needed a hand
                    changing a tyre?

      Haresh gives in.

                                      HARESH
                          (to Sarah Jane)
                    She thought she'd seen the lizard
                    alien we saw at Genetech.

      Sarah Jane tries to hide the shiver of worry.  Smiles.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    An alien? In my garden?

      And she consciously starts to lead them back to the door -
      away from any possible threat.

      Clyde and Rani exchange a worried glance, and follow (Rani
      bringing up the rear).

                                      HARESH
                    She dragged me along to this UFO
                    society this morning.  BURPSS.

                                      CLYDE
                    Pardon me?

                                      HARESH
                    Exactly.  I think it's got her
                      imagination running wild.  You
                    know what your mother's like.

      Rani's distracted by something nearby - more a feeling
      than a sound, but tries to ignore -

                    Sender?

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Well if I come across any aliens 
                    I'll be sure to let Gita know.

      - Unseen by the others, Rani senses something behind her;
      turns...

                    See you later, Rani.  Macaroni
                    cheese for tea.

                                      RANI*

                    Oh,  great.*

                                      CLYDE
                    Thought you said your dad's macaroni
                    cheese was like eating super-glue?

      Rani ignores.  Turns to Sarah Jane.

                                    RANI
                    We should go back up to the attic. 
                    Use Mister Smith.

                                      CLYDE
                    What for?  Androvax?  No way.  The
                    Judoon took him prisoner.  He isn't
                    coming back here.  Why would he? 
                    It's like your dad said - your
                    mum's seeing things.*

                                      SARAH JANE
                    On the other hand, Androvax is a
                    genocidal killer who destroyed
                    twelve worlds.  Never mind that
                    nasty habit he has of jumping into
                    other people's bodies.

      Sarah Jane shivers at the memory of her possession by
      Androvax.

                    trouble.

                    Which is why we should ask Mister
                    Smith for help now.

      And she's moving past Sarah Jane towards the front door. 
      Something about her manner isn't right.  Sarah Jane is
      wary.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    We don't need Mister Smith.  I can
                    do a scan right here.

      Sarah Jane opens her watch - and it's instantly setting
      off alarms.

                                      CLYDE
                    Oh.  That is not good.

      Sarah Jane is grim.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    No, it isn't - is it, Androvax?

      And she's looking at Rani.

      FX SHOT: Androvax's tongue flashes across Rani's face.

      Rani pushes past Sarah Jane - launches herself through the
      front door.

                                      SARAH JANE (CONT'D)
                    Stop!

      But Rani is through the door.  Slams it on Sarah Jane and
      Clyde.

                    you can forget any idea of body-
                    jumping any of us.

                                      ANDROVAX
                    Taking a body gives me more strength -
                    a little more time.

      Androvax, passes a hand over his face, staggers a little.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    For what? What's wrong with you?

      She moves a little closer - Clyde's on alert.

                                      CLYDE
                    Careful.  He's putting it on.

                                    RANI
                    No, he's ill.  I felt it.  Really
                    ill.

                                      MISTER SMITH

                    fish that devour you to the bone
                    before you feel the first bite and
                    weeds that trap you, wrap you up
                    and drink your blood.  Not many
                    escape from there.

                                      MISTER SMITH
                    Swamp viper toxin is fatal. 
                    Androvax is dying.

      Sarah Jane, Clyde and Rani exchange a look.

                                      ANDROVAX
                    I don't have much time. I need you
                    to help me.  Help save my people!

                    But your species is dead.  Your
                    planet turned into a ball of ice
                    when its star died.

      Androvax spasms with pain.

                      civilisation on a new world.  But
                    they crashed.

                    In prison I met a Bouken pirate. 
                    He had acquired the activator disc
                    to a vault here on Earth. But he
                    tricked me.  The vault needs two
                    discs.  I need Mister Smith to
                    help me crack the vault's second
                    code.

                    spaceship in a vault?  Just how
                    big is that going to be?

      Androvax is weak but determined.  Time running out.

                                      ANDROVAX
                    Does it matter?  I have destroyed
                    twelve planets.  Twelve
                      civilizations.  Please, help me

                    Of course I do.  Androvax taking
                    control of my body was one of the

                    But I was inside his mind as much
                    as he was in mine - I felt his
                    pain and grief.  He raged against
                    the universe for taking his people.

                    I know.  But now Mister Smith has
                    traced the alien energy signature
                    that matches this.

                    Well, I am very proud of my
                    begonias.  But I didn't realize
                    they were a cosmic must-see. 

      Ocean smiles, like she's endured all this before.

                    Well, if you do find any aliens, 
                    I can always use another set of
                    green fingers in the garden.

      Sarah Jane flashes a smile - and as she gets into the car
      no-one sees her pull out the sonic lipstick and zap Minty's
        contraption.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Sarah Jane's car pulls up outside the boarded asylum. 
      SARAH JANE, RANI and CLYDE get out.

                                    RANI
                    How creepy is this place?

      Clyde reads the old sign -

                                      CLYDE
                    Saint Jude's Hospital.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    Not a hospital.  It was an asylum.

      Rani and Clyde exchange a look.  Creeped out.

      Sarah Jane sonics the padlock on the gate.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      SARAH JANE, CLYDE and RANI are heading towards the building.*

                                      SARAH JANE
                    From the look of the signs back*
                    there, someone still owns this*
                    place.*

                                    RANI
                    Along with a vault big enough to
                    hide a spaceship in?

      Sarah Jane moves off, exploring.  Scanning with her watch.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    The vault must be hyper-dimensional.

                                      CLYDE
                    Which means, exactly...?

                                      SARAH JANE
                    The entrance might be on Earth -
                    but the vault itself is somewhere
                    else.

                                    RANI
                    And big enough for the Veil ship?

                                      SARAH JANE
                    And maybe more besides.

      They've reached the door.  Sarah Jane sonics it.*

                                                                              CUT TO*


      A car (an immaculate black 1965 Humber Super Snipe) prowls. 
      Inside MISTER DREAD and his MEN IN BLACK  continue to look
      for Androvax.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      SARAH JANE, CLYDE and RANI run from the asylum towards the
      waiting Figaro.  The MEN IN BLACK pursue, walking but
        unstoppable. Then MISTER DREAD stops, as do the other two.

                                      MISTER DREAD
                    Let them go.

      SARAH JANE, RANI and CLYDE get into the Figaro and it powers
      away.

                                      MISTER DREAD (CONT'D)
