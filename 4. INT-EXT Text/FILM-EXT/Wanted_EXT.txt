A sharply dressed man, MR. X, wearing a dark .Armani suit,
enters a skyscraper through the lobby. He's a shade
taller than most of the office workers who are coming and
going.
Mr. X's momentum carries him from one building to the
next, over an alleyway, the wet-concrete shining below.
He lands on the...
ROOF OF THE NEXT BUILDING:
...and rolls up quickly, guns ready.
His eyes spot FOUR MARKSMEN running and ducking for cover
on the neighboring rooftop..
.and on a dead sprint across the roof...
. he spots about a CENTIMETER OF FLESH sticking out from
around an air-conditioning vent. He fiKes the his
left band.
The bullet flies through the air and rockets into the
flesh... which happens to be one of the marksmen's ears.
The guy YELPS IN PAIN and falls back from the vent,
exposing himself. That's all Mr. X needs, and another
shot rings out while he's still on a dead run. THWAP!
The bullet finds its mark in the yelping man's forehead,
silencing him, just as...
.Mr. X ducks behind a stairwell door.
He pulls up his right hand and looks down the barrel of
this pistol: built into the barrel is thin c u r
screen. It actually shows the heat signatures of the
three remaining marksmen, one of which is directly in
front of him, hiding behind a small rooftop supply shed.
A second marksmen is just on the other side of the
stairwell. The third is on the far side of the rooftop.
Mr. X takes another look at the heat signature of the
marksman hiding behind the shed and he FIRES his gun...
5.
/~,
...then does an amazing thing: in the split second that
the bullet travels forward, he jerks his gun to the
side... actually steering the bullet around the wall and
into the ksman's throat.
Before the guy's blood hits the ground, the assassin is
moving again: he dashes away from the stairwell then
makes two incredible shots; one knocks a piece of
aluminum off the top of the stairwell...
..which causes it to flip up in the air above the head
of the hiding marksman...
. the second shot strikes the aluminum again, ,,..,sending
the bullet ricocheting down into the ton of the
marksman's heads As he falls...
THE CAMERA MOVES OVER TO WHERE... the FINAL MARKSMAN is
breathing hard, like an engine with a chronic misfire, as
he looks out at the dead bodies of his fallen comrades...
all chopped down in a matter of seconds.
He squeezes his eyes shut, trying to psyche himself up...
LAST MARKSMAN
(SOFTLY)
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
He looks out at the stairwell door... and all is quiet.
Maybe Mr. X didn't know he was there, maybe he left,
maybe the last marksman can sneak away after all.
LAST MARKSMEN
(SOFTLY)
Okay... okay...
He finally decides...
.and takes one step forward...
THWAP1!1 A bullet disintegrates his knee.
He falls, clutching the knee in agony, as Mr. X walks
toward him slowly until he stands right over him like a
hunter over his prey.
Mr. X's shoe comes down on the final marksman's wrist,
pinning it away from his dropped weapon.
MR. X
(GROWLS)
Who sent you?
6.
For a moment, we're not sure the last marksman's going.to
answer. Then...
LAST MARKSMEN
(NERVOUSLY)
We're... we're just the decoys, man. We
were paid to get you out here...
The marksman points at a small VIDEO CAMERA sitting on
the roof, relaying their every move...
Mr. X's face falls as.those words register, and just
then...
RA ROCKETS over thetreets of the city, block
after block in the blink of any eye...
.until it reaches a rooftop, over a mile away.
ON THE NEW ROOFTOP:
A man named CROSS is in a crouch, holding a massive RIFLE
pointed upward, at an angle...
A small SCREEN on Cross' gun shows the scene from the
roof, along with various elemental measurements: wind
speed, pressure, temperature, distance, altitude...
.. the information on __the reflects off of Cross'
eyeball as he processes,,the shot... a quick adjustment to
the gun and a slight pull of the trigger...
BOOM...
We follow the arcing bullet back over the rooftops in an
instant. Somehow it keeps it's elevation and it's
path...
.to the resigned look on Mr. X's face: an outsmarted
man, a dead man.
The bullet hits him square in the chest, and he falls to
his knees, then slumps over, dead.
Flies start to gather as he lies there.
First one, then two, then several as night TIME-DISSOLVES
to day...
.and two pairs of legs approach the dead body of Mr. X.
7.
The first set belong to an older man, SLOAN, who looks.
like he has seen his share of death. The other set
belong to the hottest black woman on the planet, FOX.
As they look down at the dead body...
FOX
It was a set-up all the way?
Sloan just nods.
He then stoops down, shoos some of the flies away with
the back of his hand and picks up the file that Puja gave
Mr. X.
The CAMERA PUSHES IN on the back of Sloan's hand as he
reads the file. It, too, has the tattoo pf the three-
headed do q, in the same spot as Mr. X.
FOX (CONT'D)
(re: the dead body)
That's two heads in two weeks. Which
leaves only one: you.
Sloan nods.
SLOAN
He wants out.
FOX
And killing all three heads gets him
that?
Sloan nods again.
FOX (CONT'D)
Well, I don't know if we have anyone who
can stop him.
Sloan squints back up at Fox.
SLOAN
There's one person who can.
FOX
Yeah? Who?
And with that, we...
SMASH CUT TO:
8.
Wesley pedals a ten-speed down a busy street. It's
raining, and he squints to keep the water out of his
eyes.
He stands nervously at an ATM machine. He checks to see
if anyone is looking, and then hits the "check balance"
button.
A message comes up: "You have $47.92 in your account.
Would you like another transaction?"
He clicks "yes" and then "quick cash" and waits for the
$40 to dispense.
IN . WESLEY'S APARTMENT - DUSK
Wesley enters, toting his bike, only to find Cathy and
Barry laughing on the couch, watching some crap on
television.
He's two steps in the door when...
CATHY
Where's the spaghetti?
WESLEY
What?
14.
CATHY
I specifically told you to get noodles on
your way home. God, Wesley, I already
put the sauce on.
WESLEY
Sorry. Ididn't...
CATHY
You didn't listen is what you didn't.- I
might as well talk to the wall.
WESLEY
I'll be right back.
He turns around.
He's back on the ten-speed, pedaling again in the rain,.a
pissed expression on his face.
WESLEY (V.O.)
My parents both died when I was born.
He grits his teeth as we...
CUT TO:
The ten-year-old Wesley moves furtively to a side of the
clap trap house, and pries loose a board.
WESLEY (V.O.)
..so I had to hide my stash like it was
a bag of many jane.
Stuck in a hole is a copy of THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO.
He moves back around the corner and standing there is his
FOSTER MOTHER, pissed as hell...
WESLEY (V.0.), (CONT'D)
One time my foster mother found my copy
of CATCHER IN THE RYE...
.she holds a copy of the book in,her hand, getting
ready, to strike..
WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
.and God told her to beat me with it.
Young Wesley takes a beating, WHAP, WHAP, WRAP!
.his face screws up, taking the blows...
WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
.But despite them, I thought I was gonna
be something special.
CUT TO:
.that same expression is plastered on Wesley's face as
he pedals. He banks the bike up a curb and into a
grocery store parking lot.
Across the street, a man watches from behind the wheel of
a 171 Chevy Chevelle.
In fact, it's Cross, the man we last saw assassinating
Mr. X on the rooftop.
He watches Wesley park the bike and move into the store.
There is a cherry red FERRARI convertible parked right
next to the store.
Wesley is still trying to figure out what the hell is
going on as Fox tosses him the ke !
FOX
Drive!
WESLEY
What?!!
But Fox just leaps into the passenger seat, guns up and
ready, as Wesley's legs. somehow take over and he hops
behind the wheel.
Just then, Cross's ev ll Mound the corner,
practically going up on two tires.
Wham! Wesley turns the ignition, pope the clutch, and
smashes the gas pedal as the car nearly snaps his neck
when it launches forward.
He races through the gears and rips around a corner and
out into traffic.
WESLEY (CONT'D)
Where are we going?
FOX
Just drive!
The Chevelle stays on his tail behind them; Cross drives
and fires his Glock at the same time. Bam! Bam! Sam!
Fox does her best to send bullets back his way, while
Wesley mans the wheel, breathing hard, still stunned at
what is happening.
He spots a side-street...
WESLEY
Hold on!
...whips the car into a rubber-squealing turn...
20.
...and ends up going the wrong way down a narrow one-way
street!
He now has to weave in and out of cars headed right for
them, as Cross stays tight on their ass.
Horns are BLARING in his face, but Wesley somehow keeps
the. Ferrari on all four tires as he bobs in'and out of
the paths of oncoming cars.
A 4 X 4 Chevy Pickup is headed like a missile right at
them...
Wesley's eyes go wide.
WESLEY
Truck!
FOX
Go around it!
WESLEY
No! Shoot the tires!
Fox looks at Wesley, momentarily stunned by his idea,
then spins and fires away at the oncoming truck.
The front tires on the truck explode and the truck veers
hard right, where it bounces off a Fed Extrugk.,,, hat
sends it into a violent roll.
Wesley guns the Ferrari at the tumbling truck as it flips
forward... right over their car!!!
Wesley watches it fly over them, amazed his idea
worked... when finally it SMASHES down into the street
between them and Cross's Chevellel
Cross is forced to slam on his brakes and slide out...
but it's too late... his Chevelle smashes into the 4 X 4
before skidding to a stop, a tangled mess in the street.
Wesley snaps back to reality and rips the Ferrari off the
one-way street and down a side street.
He pulls the car to a stop, then looks over at Fox,
amazed.
21.
FOX
(SMILING)
There's a lot of things you don't know
about yourself, Wesley.
WESLEY
Who was that?
FOX
That... was the man who killed your
father. And now he's trying to kill you.
Wesley forces a laugh, but right now it's hard to paint
any-thing as ludicrous.
WESLEY
No. I mean... I told you my father died
when I was a baby.
She leans right into his face so that their noses are
only inches apart.
FOX
Have you ever believed that? Have you
ever been content with that answer?
Wesley stops, not sure of anything right now.
FOX (CONT'D)
Today's your new birthday, Wesley.
Drive.
He settles back in his seat and pops the clutch again,
this time, easing.a little more respectably into traffic.
The Ferrari cruises to a stop outside a warehouse.
FOX
The people I work with... we believe your
father passed his skills on genetically
to you. You knew how to handle the car,
you knew to shoot at the truck.
WESLEY
I... I...
FOX
It's that confidence we're gonna need to
work on.
Wesley is still dazed.
22.
FOX (CONT'D)
Now I want you to look at me and tell me
something. And I want you to be honest
with me.
WESLEY
What?
FOX
Do you think I look fat in this outfit?
WESLEY
What?!
FOX
I thought so. Let's go.
She hops out. They walk inside a...
Sloan and Wesley move down a busy commercial street.
SLOAN
I know thin is hard for you to
understand, Wesley, but I want you to
concentrate on what I'm saying. Your
father was a member of the Fraternity, a
collection of the most powerful assassins
the world has ever known.
They weave against the flow of pedestrians out and about
on the city streets. Instinctively, people step out of
their way.
WESLEY
But I've never heard of...
25.
SLOAN
We don't advertise Wesley. We blend into
the environment like moths against a
tree.
CUT TO:
The CAMERA moves across an expansive lawn...
SLOAN (V.0.)
We disappear into our surroundings.
.until it finds a man with a three-headed dog tattoo on
his hand, trimming a hedge. THE GARDENER.
CUT TO:
Sloan is still walking with Wesley. Wesley watches every
face that passes them by... any of them could be
Fraternity members.
26.
SLOAN
..until that time when we are called
into action.
CUT TO:
The Gardener works his gardening shears on a hedge in the
front of this mansion... CLIP, CLIP, CLIP. We realize
A,
he's cutting a hole all the way through the hedge.
Then, he reaches down into his burlap sack and withdraws
a long range rifle with a scope. He pokes the rifle
through the freshly-cut hole, looks through the lens,
starts to squeeze his trigger...
The CAMERA SHOOTS WAY UP to give us an aerial view of the
neighborhood. We see that we are in the hills over the
city, and across the canyon, a Japanese man is just
pulling into his driveway, driving a black Audi, a mile
away.
He brakes his car, opens his door, but THWAPI A bullet
disintegrates his head and he topples over, never knowing
what hit him.
Back at the hole in the hedge, we see the Gardener's
eyeball looking through from the other side... until it
disappears and he is gone.
CUT TO:
The customer takes the gun from the Gunsmith and pays him
in cash.
27.
He then tucks the gun in his belt and walks out the door,
like he's a bad-ass, instead of the goombah that he is.
He only gets a block before the gun at his waist
EXPLODES, causing him to flop on the sidewalk, like he
just stepped on a land mine.
The bell to the Gun Shop jingles as the Gunsmith leaves
and heads in the opposite direction, whistling to
himself, not paying attention to the pedestrians running
to help the dying Italian.
SLOAN (V.0.)
And when the time comes that we are
called, death is as certain as the sun.
CUT BACK TO:
Wesley shoves his ATM card in the machine and hits the
"check balance" button. Which reveals: $100,000.92.
Amazed, Wesley takes out a grand, the machine just
spitting him money.
Smiling, Wesley jumps back on his ten speed and zips into
traffic.
The s in in wheel of the bicycle turns into...
Wesley flies out the front door, just as Fox's Diablo
swings around the corner.
FOX
What's up, new man?
36.
WESLEY
You were watching?
FOX
Never stopped. How'd it feel, saying
exactly what you wanted to say?
WESLEY
Like I had a gun in my hands.
Fox grins as Wesley jumps in the car and she mashes on
the pedal. The Diablo's tires smoke as she launches it
out of there.
Fox is seated at a small outdoor cafe, sipping on a
latte, reading the paper. There's a story about the
death threats to Henry Helms on the front page.
Just then Wesley approaches, his face splattered with
flecks of blood. She wipes his face with a napkin.
FOX
You haven't quite figured out this whole
"blending in" thing, yet. Let's go.
A huge Chevy 4X4 pulls up and Fox hope out from behind
the wheel, followed by Wesley. They get to the door and
Fox pulls out a metal device to pick the lock.
WESLEY
What is this?
FOX
This...
She picks the lock and they step inside...
They walk down a downtown lane, buildings crowding in on
them from all-sides. Not too many people are out this
late; they have the sidewalk to themselves.
FOX
Your father lov ed you, Wesley. He talked
about you all the time.
WESLEY
Really?
Wesley looks at her hopefully. She smiles, thinking
about the past.
FOX
That's a fact. He knew he wasn't
supposed to, but he couldn't help it.
WESLEY
You worked with him?
FOX
(NODS)
He trained me. Made me what I am.
CUT TO:
A younger, greener Fox stands alone in the alley, eyes
scanning the rooftops.
FOX (V.0.)
I remember one night he had me on my own
.for the first time, and I was tagging
this target named Buster Burgess. But I
was green and clumsy and stupid. Buster
marked me and disappeared into this old
tenement building.
45.
A shadowy figure creeps to the edge of the building and
looks down. We can't quite make out his face. Fox is
looking the other way and he's got a clean shot.
He raises a rifle to his eye...
BAM!
He nails Fox in the thigh, and she falls helpless to the
pavement.
FOX (V.0.)
Motherfucker shot mein the leg. Put a
damn hole in my favorite skirt.
The figure re-aims, ready to take out the helpless Fox.
FOX (V.0.) (CONT'D)
Then you know what happened?
WESLEY (V.0.)
My father saved your life? Put a bullet
in Burgess?
k,
FOX (V.0.)
Naww. I ended up with four more slugs in
me.
The figure unleashes four more shots.
BACK TO:
They turn a corner and head up into the lobby of a tall
building, their conversation continuing...
WESLEY
What kind of training is that?
FOX
I'm here, aren't I?
INSIDE THE LOBBY:
Wesley weighs all this, puts it together.
WESLEY
My father was Burgess, wasn't he?
Fox nods, smiling. They step...
46.
INSIDE AN ELEVATOR:
.andstart riding it up.
FOX
He didn't hit me anywhere important, and
he used pin-shot bullets that didn't do
any real damage. But you can be damn
sure I don't let any mark get the high
ground on me again.
Shesmiles at another thought.
FOX (CONT'D)
And you know what we did instead of go to
the hospital to stitch me up?
WESLEY
What?
FOX
We went driving.
CUT TO:
A PORSCHE SHOWROOM sits on the corner. SMASH! A black
911 convertible breaks through the glass and skids to a
stop next to Fox in the street.
Two hands pull her up and drop her in the passenger seat,
and the car roars off.
BACK TO:
Wesley smiles. The elevator DINGS.
Fox and Wesley step out on to the rooftop where Mr. X was
gunned down.
WESLEY
What's this?
FOX
This is where your father was killed.
Wesley's eyes narrow and he looks around, taking it all
in.
47.
WESLEY
How?
FOX
We're not sure. The fence he was meeting
was shot in the head... which led him out
to here... but it must've been a set-up
all along. All I know is it would take a
hell of a trap to bring your father down.
Wesley crouches down by where his father's body would
have been, running his fingers over the gravel rooftop.
WESLEY
My whole life I thought he was dead. I
shouldn't feel any differently just
because it happened 20 years later.
FOX
But...
WESLEY
But, I do. Like I missed my one chance.
FOX
Well that's why you're here. To make up
for lost time.
Wesley looks back at her.
WESLEY
Can I see his body?
CUT TO:
.the s city street, now full-sized, buzzing with
activity, pedestrians hurrying to work, cars and taxis
and trucks whizzing through the street.
Sloan and Wesley walk down the sidewalk, passing
streetlight after streetlight until they reach one in
particular.
SLOAN
The Fraternity's grasp reaches every
facet of the world's major cities,
including their construction. Look at
this streetlight.
Wesley peers at it... there is a plaque affixed to the
pole... the standard thing you find on these things...
"Municipal C. W. 63070."
But then there is something different on this one... a
tiny symbol on the bottom of the plaque... the Cerberus
instead of the seal of the cit
Sloan presses the symbol and the plaque slides aside,
revealing a hollow space behind it. He reaches his hand
inside and pulls out a small handgun... flips out the
clip expertly, then racks the weapon.
Wesley can't believe it.
WESLEY
You have stashes...
SLOAN
.everywhere.
WESLEY
Jesus.
54.
Just then, two POLICE OFFICERS walk by, eye.the gun Sloan
has pulled out.
POLICE OFFICER
Sir...
Sloan flashes his tattoo at them.
SLOAN
Keep moving, fellas.
They nod and do just that.
SLOAN (CONT'D)
They let us do our jobs, we let them
live.
THE CAMERA PUSHES IN on Wesley's face as he realizes the
full scope of this organization and we...
DISSOLVE TO:
SERIES OF SHOTS:
GUN RANGE. Wesley firing his Imanishi 18 on the shooting
range, steering the bullets wherever he wants them to go.
WESLEY
Closer.
Impressed, the Gunsmith moves the corpse closer to the
target, making the angle all that much tougher.
Wesley gets ready to squeeze his trigger, but a pistol
starts FIRING next to him.
He looks over... Sloan is standing nr= &o; him, firing at
the target. Every shot bends around the body and hits
right in the forehead of the target.
Wesley smiles, impressed.
LIBRARY. Wesley thumbs through an old Fraternity book,
which has detailed sketches of an assassination in 17th
century Paris.
MEAT LOCKER. Wesley working out on a heavy bag, honing
his punches, the Chef holding the bag for him, muscles
rippling.
MAP ROOM. Wesley walks by himself amongst the miniature
city, trying to memorize where the red marks are.
55.
INTERROGATION ROOM. Wesley sitting here,. being grilled
by Sloan, as he tries to-tell the undetectable lie.
SLOAN
Our job isn't just about how fast or true
you shoot, Wesley. Physical agility will
always lose to mental agility. It's
warfare of the mind.
FO 'S APART. Wesley looking at Fox through the
bedroom door.
SLAUGHTERHOUSE. Wesley working with the Butcher on the
art of knife play.
MAP ROOM. The Gardener and Fox show Wesley the rooftop
of a certain building on the model city, one corner of
the roof painted red.
ROOFTOP. Fox and the Gardener now with Wesley on that
actual rooftop, pointing out firing angles, modes. of
ascension, and escape routes. The Gardener moves over to
a cornerstone in the roof of the building and then easily
lifts it off, revealing a stash of assault rifles.
k SHOOTING G . Wesley looking at some ammunition while
the Gunsmith talks and demonstrates. He fires at one of
the targets, which EXPLODES in a splattered mess and we
cut to...
Wesley and Fox walk down a crowded urban city street. The
CAMERA finds Wesley's tattoo and then moves around behind
Fox and holds on hers.
WESLEY
Where's the Diablo?
FOX
(SHRUGS)
I got tired of the color.
Wesley can't help but smile, then Fox stops. They're
standing right in front of a CAR SHOWROOM, displayed in
the window is a MIDNIGHT BLACK PORSCHE 911 convertible
sitting in a showroom window... 'us like the one
Wesley's father smashed in Fox's story.
62.
Suddenly, the car comes flying out of the window, glass
shattering everywhere as it tears up the street.
WESLEY (V.0.)
Being a member of the Fraternity was like
winning the lottery...
ON THE CITY STREETS:
Traffic lights mean nothing, as Wesley mashes the
accelerator to the mat, and the Porsche responds, ripping
up the road like a tiger on the prowl.
Fox rises up in the passenger seat, looking over the
windshield, the wind whipping her face...
WESLEY.(V.0.)
This... this is what my dad's life was
like. He was a fucking god.
He weaves in and out of traffic, then rips around a
corner, narrowly cutting in front of an eighteen-wheeler,
which has to slam on its brakes.
WESLEY (CONT'D)
Where we headed?
FOX
Trial by fire, sugar. Hook a right.
Wesley whips the car around a corner...
FOX (CONT'D)
Park it here, baby.
He pulls the car to the side of the street...
.in front of a busy outdoor mall. It's covered with
shops, eateries, movie theaters and people, people,
people.
Fox eyes the crowd.
WESLEY
You need a new wardrobe or something?
FOX
we're here for a reason and it ain't
clothes-shopping. Somewhere in that
crowd is your first target.
63.
WESLEY
A test?
FOX
(shakes her head)
The real thing.
WESLEY
Who's the mark?
FOX
You'll know him when you see him.
WESLEY
What if I don't?
FOX
Then you get shot.
Fox hands him his Imanishi pistol, which Wesley rolls
over in his hand.
FOX (CONT'D)
It's graduation day, baby.
I He nods and makes his way toward...
THE OUTDOOR MALL:
.where he quickly mingles with the crowd. He has his
hands tucked into the front pocket of his hooded-
sweatshirt, the pistol inside. People pass him on his
left and right, some make eye contact, some don't...
anybody could be the target..
Wesley's eyes scan to the rooftops, surveying... the
SECURITY GUARD by the theater, the SWEATER-FOLDER at The
Gap, the SCARY-LOOKING GUY shopping at the sunglasses
stand.
And then Wesley's eyes settle on someone he was not
expecting to see... Barry, his best friend that was
shagging his girlfriend... is thumbing through books
outside the BARNES AND NOBLE... seemingly. not paying
attention to what's around him.
Wesley can't believe it. It can't be him. Can it?
Just then, Barry stops looking at the books and starts
walking toward Wesley, keeping his eyes down. Fuck, this
can't really be happening...
64.
..Wesley gets ready, both hands inside that front
pocket...
.and now Barry meets his eyes... still coming... still
coming...
BARRY
Wesley... hey dude.
Wesley can't believe itl
BARRY (CONT'D)
Thanks for calling me. I wanted to
say...
Wesley pulls out his gun and Barry throws up his hands...
BARRY (CONT'D)
Whoa, man!!
But now we see Wesley is looking past B_arry. over his
shoulder...
WESLEY
Get down!
.and he's looking at a man we recognize from his
office... The Consultant.
He's approaching rapidly behind Barry, fisting a 'pair of
pistols!
Just as Barry hits the deck, Wesley pulls the trigger...
.but it lust CLICKS, the chamber empty...
SMASH CUT TO:
THE PORSCHE:
Fox holds the clip to Wesley's Imanishi, tapping it in
her hand. Holy shit, she gave him an empty gun...
SMASH BACK TO:
THE OUTDOOR MALL:
Wesley can't believe his gun is empty. In the split-
second that it takes him to realize this, the Consultant
has his guns leveled, taking aim, but...
65.
...Wesley moves faster than we thought he could move...
he darts behind a kiosk hocking monogrammed apparel, and
dashes full speed through the crowds lining the street.
The Consultant chases after him, knocking shoppers out of
the way, sending fanny packs and Nordstrom bags flying.
Wesley hooks a right around a SHARPER IMAGE and heads
straight down a narrower section, like he's on a mission,
knowing exactly where he's going. And now we see why...
Because the city around us goes stark white like the Mg
Room. We're seeing what Wesley sees, what he's memorized
in all those hours staring at the model. Finally we see
one SMALL BENCH next to a fountain, which is bright red.
Immediately the natural color of the city c2 Ws back and
Wesley is running all out for that bench. He goes into a
slide, hitting the grass .underneath the bench, sliding
under it, popping up on the other side.
He rips a metal panel off the back of it as he does,
revealing an AUTOMATIC PISTOL...
.and just as quickly, he's up on one knee, aiming,
using the bench as a shield as the Consultant rushes up,
surprised and BAM! BAM! BAM:
The Consultant drops where he is, three bullets hitting
him in his two shoulders and his chest.
People start SCREAMING and RUNNING the hell away from the
gunplay. Wesley is about to run away himself, but when
he turns, Fox is right there beside him... smiling. A
couple of SECURITY GUARDS are with her, smiling as well.
Wesley looks over at The Consultant, who site up, smiling
too, even though he's bleeding from three spots on his
body...
FOX
Pin shot bullets.
Wesley looks down at the gun.
WESLEY
Just like my father used on you.
Fox nods, as the Security Guards go to help the
Consultant to his feet.
WESLEY (CONT'D)
You were watching me in the office.
66.
FOX
(NODS)
Protecting our assets.
She hands the clip from the Imanishi over to Wesley...
FOX (CONT'D)
Time to do this for real.
CUT TO:
The Porsche once again tears across the asphalt, as
Wesley drives.
FOX
Wesley, you gotta know something. No
matter what kind of training you've done
these last few weeks, killing your first,
well that's gonna change you forever.
Wesley drives for a while. Then...
WESLEY
You know what my foster mother. told me
when I was six years old?
Fox shakes her head.
WESLEY (CONT'D)
She caught me eating some jello out of
the fridge after my bedtime. I knew I
wasn't supposed to but I was so damn
hungry, and it was just some fucking
jello. Anyway, after she hit me so hard
I couldn't bite down straight for a week,
she told me... she told me that God had
killed my parents because I was such a
wicked boy.
FOX
Jesus. Someone needs to find that bitch
and set her straight.
WESLEY
So I grew up thinking I was the reason I
never knew my parents. But now, to find
out, that no, my father didn't give me up
because he had died... he gave me up
because he was Protecting me... well I
guess I want to give him something back.
71.
FOX
Here we are.
They are surrounded by industrial looking warehouses, one
of which has the words Times-Herald on it. Newspaper
delivery TRUCKS make their way in and out of the loading
dock area of this building.
Overhead, an EL TRAIN scrapes along the worn tracks.
Fox pulls around a corner and back into an alley, so they
can have a view of the corner in front of them.
Wesley scans the area quickly.
WESLEY
Not very discreet, are they?
Fox smiles knowingly, and looks up, revealing what Wesley
is talking about. On various rooftops we-see FIGURES
peering down. looking over the site.
FOX
The others are only backup singers. This
is your show.
Fox subtly moves her head and figures disappear,
crouching down.
Just then, out the windshield, they see a MAN wearing a
long black overcoat approaching the corner near the
newspaper building.
Fox's eyes start to dance.
FOX (CONT'D)
Remember: he's good, baby. But you're
the best I've ever seen.
Wesley nods and the two of them step out of the car.
IN THE STREET:
From a distance, Wesley approaches Cross from the back.
His steps become quicker, getting closer every passing
second. Wesley starts to reach in his coat for his
gun...
.and that's when Cross firesl Quick as lightning,
Cross has guns out and lets loose toward the roof of a
nearby warehouse.
72.
His bullet has the instincts of a bird dog, and it curves
over the edge of the building and finds its mark, causing
a crouching ASSASSIN to plunge from the roof to the
street near Wesley!
The others on the rooftops hail down bullets as Cross
disappears into the nearest building, the Times-Herald.
Wesley and Fox run toward the building as three other
Fraternity members beat them there, the BELLMAN, the
WAITER, and the ELECTRICIAN.
Wesley sees them congregate on the loading dock and then
start inside the building...
WESLEY
No!
The minute Bellman exposes himself in the open loading
dock door he is cut down from inside, his bloody body
falling backwards into a newspaper truck parked at the
dock.
Wesley and Fox join the other two on the dock as
screaming WORKERS run from the place.
WAITER
We need a way in there.
ELECTRICIAN
Let's find another door.
WESLEY
He'll be long gone by then.
FOX
(shaking her head)
He's got the high ground.
Wesley sees an unmanned forklift on the dock.
WESLEY
On the pallet.
They all jump on the pallet held by the forks of the
lift. Wesley throws the machine in reverse and it backs
into the warehouse, the four assassins safely crouching
on the pallet on the front.
INSIDE THE NEWSPAPER BUILDING:
Once inside...
73.
WESLEY
Separate.
The lowest level is the loading dock, where pallets of
newspapers and massive unused paper rolls await.
WITH THE ELECTRICIAN:
The Electrician hustles between the pallets and boxes,
eyes darting, guns drawn. He backs up to a pallet of
stacked newspapers, using it as cover. What he doesn't
realize is that between each stack of papers is a space,
just big enough for a --
THWAP! A bullet finds its way through the space and hits
the Electrician in the back of the shoulder, spinning him
around.
CLOSE ON: Cross' gun. Another shot and we follow the
bullet, across the dock and dipping low into the next
space in the paper stack -- right where Electrician is
now leaning...
.the bullet buries in his eye, sending him to the
flog.
Wesley sees Cross race for a set of stairs. Just as
Wesley is about to cut him down, Cross fires at a wooden
beam holding back some massive rolls of NEWSPAPER. The
rolls tumble over and Wesley has to dive out of the way,
allowing Cross to escape up the stairs.
Wesley, Fox and the Waiter all race for the stairs.
ON LEVEL TWO:
Giant printing machines are running full speed, printing
up the morning edition.
A group of NEWSPAPER EMPLOYEES see the guns the
Fraternity members are toting and scramble for safety.
Wesley has to yell to be heard over the whirring
machines...
WESLEY
(to the Waiter)
Stay here and cover us. There's no angle
for him to hit you if you stay here.
Wesley points at a scaffolding that runs above the
machines.
74.
WESLEY (CONT'D)
Don't let him get up there. And stay
clear of the presses! He'll use them
however he can.
WAITER
How do you know?
WESLEY
It's what I'd do.
With that, Wesley and Fox disappear amongst the
machinery.
The Waiter takes a step back from the press, where over a
hundred pounds of paper spins through every second.
He sticks his head out to try and keep an eye on that
scaffolding. Everything looks clear, until...
...shots ring out and a shelf o w a1l o
Waiter's head gives way! He turns to see a bunch of cans
of spray lubricant falling to the floor. No big deal,
until Cross shoots one of them out of the air, causing it
to explode!
The burning oil covers the Waiter, who SCREAMS and
stumbles nearer the printing press...
BAM BAM BAM!
More shots from Cross and one of the RESTRAINING ARMS on
the roll of paper feeding the machine breaks in half.
The paper roll spins wildly from the machine and like a.
saw, cuts the Waiter in hplf !
With a leap, Cross is on the scaffolding over the
presses. For just a second, Cross stops as he locks eyes
with Wesley...
..but Fox is already firing at him so Cross has to keep
moving...
He heads up a second staircase, but not before he sends a
stream of bullets back at Fox, who athletically
cartwheels away...
.but one of Cross's bullets disintegrates a gear on the
press near her, sending flying metal everywhere. A piece
of shXapnel b ies into Fox's leg... making her break out
of her cartwheel and flop down, wounded.
75.
FOX
Fuuuucckkk!
Cross races along the scaffolding and disappears into a
door.
FOX (CONT'D)
Keep goin', baby! Take him!
Wesley races for the stairs. He is the only one left to
chase Cross to level three.
ON LEVEL THREE:
Wesley bursts through the door, guns ready. The place is
already in pandemonium, with PEOPLE yelling and screaming
and running for cover. Quickly, Wesley realizes he's in
the business offices of the paper, and it looks
surprisingly similar to his old office. Lame-ass
cubicles and florescent lighting everywhere.
Wesley jumps up on a desk.
WESLEY
Cross!
Unafraid, Cross climbs up on a desk on the other side of
the office. Without hesitation, Wesley opens fire at
Cross... who immediately returns fire...
.and his bullets actually collide with Cross's by ets
in mid-air!!! The bullets ricochet and take out a
COMPUTER SCREEN where someone was playing SOLITAIRE.
The two assassins blast away, all while diving and moving
over and in the cubicles. Cross has a gun similar to the
Imanishis, and they each steer their bullets at each
other from sharp angles...
Strangely,. the first bullet collision was not blind luck,
but the pattern for the battle. They are fighting the
same fight, their bullets meeting in the middle, each man
using the same techniques at the exact same time.
Wesley needs an angle, and spots a DRY ERASE BOARD the
words "Action Items" written on it. He fires at it, and
his bullets bounce off it at an angle where one of them
strikes Cross in the shoulder... THWAP!!!
Cross can't believe he's hit but he doesn't have time to
flinch... right as Wesley fires again, he turns, barely
avoiding the rain of bullets and leaps through a nearby
window, smashing the glass out,
76.
Wesley doesn't hesitate behind him... he sprints for the
same window and dives through it, guns at the ready
and...
OUTSIDE THE WINDOW:
.we stay with Wesley as he falls from the third floor,
firing his guns the whole time...
.until he lands top of an "L" train moving at ll
speed.
THE WAREHOUSE DISTRICT:
Fox limps out of the newspaper building and hurries to
the Porsche. She ignores her wounds and rips the car out
of the alley, chasing after the fleeing L train.
ON THE L TRAIN:
Ahead of Wesley, Cross is also on the top of the train.
He manages to get up, spin around, and fire at Wesley...
.but they both have to duck as the L train whips under
an overpass, which misses smashing both of them by mere
inches.
Cross takes the opportunity to swing down between cars
and enter one of the L cars.
BEHIND HIM:
Wesley hurries across the top of the train, spying the
trail of blood that Cross is leaving behind from his
wound.
Wesley smiles, a shark on a wounded baby seal, as he also
swings down between the cars and enters...
THE FIRST L CAR:
.where he sees the trail of blood leading all the way
down the center of the empty car and out the back door.
Wesley hovers in the entry way, his guns up and ready.
He takes a step forward to follow the blood trail, and
immediately, he is decked from the side by an ambushing
Cross.
They tumble over the first row of seats, both losing
their guns.
77.
Wesley kicks Cross off of him, but Cross-spins with two
new suns in his hand! Wesley is.on him quick though, and
SLAMS Cross into one of the train's windows hard enough
to crack it. With a quick twist of Cross' wrist, Wesley
takes a sun from him Just as Cross kicks h,m off...
.Wesley fires as he falls backwards. Cross falls
backwards too from the momentum...
..and they both smash out opposite windows of the train
before landing on either side of it!
But the amazing thing is... they stand up and keep
firing as the cars are whipping by at 80mph, and
realize they. are timing their shots to actually blast
between each car in the s it-second the opening passes.
ON THE TRAIN:
COMMUTERS ride along in blissful ignorance, reading their
papers, holding on to the handrails... completely unaware
of the gunfight raging outside the train.
A bullet whizzes through an open window, pierces a
BUSINESSMAN'S paper, and exits a window on the opposite
side of the car. The man sticks his finger through the
hole, unaware of the battle outside. What the hell?
IN THE ALLEY:
On opposite sides of the train, Wesley and Cross are both
sprinting and firing, trying to get to the end of the
last train, while dodging each other's bullets...
.as the last car passes, they each jump on the tracks,
ending u with guns tucked under each other's chin!
CROSS
Wesley!
This takes Wesley aback...
CROSS (CONT'D)
Look into my eyes!
Wesley's finger is starting to squeeze his trigger... as
is Cross's.
CROSS (CONT'D)
(growls, in pain)
Look into my eyes, goddammit!
78.
Finally, Wesley does and his face goes slack as he sees
himself reflected in Cross's Dupils.
Just then, Fox pulls up in the Porsche about fifty yards
away, and her headlights illuminate them.
Cross shifts his eyes to her, then does a curious thing:
he lowers his gun, then drops it to the ground. Wesley
can't believe Cross would leave himself defenseless.
Moving swiftly, Cross men tucks something into the
Rocket of Wesley's hooded sweatshirt.
CROSS (CONT'D)
(WHISPERS)
Everything they told you was a lie,
Wesley.
With that... Cross falls down. His black jacket spills
open to show a gun shot wound not just to his shoulder,
but to hig n too. one of Wesley's bullets through
the train must have found its mark.
Cross is bleeding profusely. He gasps a couple of
times... then, with his last bit of energy...
CROSS (CONT'D)
Find the missing piece. And... don't...
let them... dispose of the weapon...
With that, the life goes out of Cross's eyes.
Wesley stares at that face, trying to decipher some
meaning there. But Cross just stares blankly back at
him, just as Fox comes limping up.
FOX
You did it, baby! Son of a bitch, you
did it. You put down motherfucking
Cross!
Wesley looks down and sees some of Cross's blood on his
hands from their clench. There is also some on the gun
he is holding. ar --h d ed crun.
Wesley reaches down and takes the other pearl-handled gun
from where it dropped and looks over them both.
FOX (CONT'D)
What'd he say to you?
Wesley looks up, sees some sort of anticipation in Fox's
eyes. He looks back down at Cross's body..
79.
WESLEY
He said... he said 'pies on the
Fraternity...'
Fox measures him, like she's not sure if he's telling the
whole story. Finally, she nods...
FOX
Well... damn, I couldn't be more proud of
you, baby! Let's go lay this on Sloan!
WESLEY
Yeah, sure.
FOX
What's wrong?
WESLEY
I think I need.a minute to myself.
FOX
(UNDERSTANDING)
Sure. It's your first kill. I'll wait
for you...
WESLEY
Naah, that's all right. You need to get
stitched up. I'll meet you at that
Korean place.
FOX
You sure?
But he's already walking off. She watches him go,
thinking...
CUT TO:
Wesley walks down the street. PEOPLE instinctively get
out of his way as he cuts a path down the sidewalk.
Then he pulls out what Cross slipped inside his pocket:
a beaten-up copy of COUNT OF ONTE CRISTO. In fact,
there's no mistake, it's the same copy he had as a kid.
Wesley tries to make sense of this as he opens up the
cover... printed on the inside in a steady hand are the
words: "I left you something."
Wesley lowers the book and sees a cheesy guy park a
Harley at a curb. He bee-lines for the guy.
80.
Wesley now blazes down the highway, pushing the Harley to
its limits. His angry expression hasn't dissipated.
The Harley pulls up to a lower-middle-class house, the
kind you might find in any run-down suburb. Kids run
around the neighborhood, playing.
ON THE BIKE:
Wesley sits and looks at one particular house. He climbs
off'and heads to the side of the house, still carrying
his book.
SIDE OF THE HOUSE:
He ducks through a broken chain-link fence and moves down
the side of the house...
.until he finds a familiar wooden BOARD. Familiar
because we've seen this place before: it's where he
lived when he was a foster kid.
He removes the board, then reaches into the hole. His
hand seizes on something. From the hole, he withdraws a
KEY attached to a note with an address on it: 1850 North
Highbury St.
Wesley's eyes move from the copy of MONTE CRISTO, to the
key, and back to the book.
Finally, he lowers his hands... revealing a little eight-
year-old kid, watching him curiously from the back yard.
WESLEY
Hey.
KID
Hey.
WESLEY
You live here?
The kid.nods .
WESLEY (CONT'D)
Foster home?
4014 The kid nods again.
81.
WESLEY (CONT'D)
Read this.
He tosses the kid the book and heads off.
He pulls the Harley over to a curb and then reaches into
his jacket pocket and withdraws the note and the key.
Across the street, the address matches: 1850 N.
Highbury. The place looks like a concrete fortress... no
windows, just a large-iron door in front.
Wesley approaches, not sure what the address could mean.
He gets to the door, looking for a key-hole, but he
doesn't find one.
He fidgets there awkwardly for a second, but then...
.the door opens, revealing a woman, ANNA. She takes a
look at Wesley and then puts a trembling hand over her
lips.
ANNA
Come in, Wesley.
He stares at her, trying to figure this out. He steps...
INSIDE THE HOUSE:
.and finds that the place is nicely decorated; an
attempt to cover up what is really a reinforced bunker.
Anna is now trying to hold back tears, but can't.
ANNA
He's dead, isn't he?
There's no point lying to this woman...
WESLEY
Yes, ma'am.
She nods knowingly, sadly.
ANNA
He told me if he didn't come back... it
would be you who pulled the trigger.
WESLEY
 He killed my father...
82.
Anna looks at him, confused. But then, realization sets
in...
ANNA
I think you need to meet someone...
she leads Wesley into another room, where a five-year-old
boy, plays the floor.
ANNA (CONT'D)
Wesley. This is your brother... Andrew.
Wesley's not sure what to make of this.
WESLEY
My brother?
ANNA
Half-brother. But both of you, you are
both 100 percent your.father's boys.
I've seen that from the beginning.
Andrew is busy playing with a couple of BLACK TOY
BUILDINGS on the floor. Wesley studies the little guy,
still confused.
ANNA (CONT'D)
Your father... he was with you the whole
time.
Wesley looks up and sees what she's referring to. The
walls are filled with pictures of Andrew, Anna, and...
remarkably...
...photoaraths of Wesley at various ages w hgn he was-
growing u !
ANNA (CONT'D)
This was his favorite.
She hands him a picture of Wesley at about age 12,
sitting with his back to a tree, reading COUNT OF MONTE
CRISTO. The picture has been taken through a windshield,
across the street.
Wesley reels, his legs give out, he slumps against one of
the walls...
FLASH: Cross firing at Fox and Wesley at the grocery
store. But now we see that Fox positioned Wesley between
herself and the shooter. He wasn't trying to hit Wesley,
he was trying to separate him from her.
83.
Wesley, thinking, remembering...
FLASH: Wesley studying Cross's face in the file, seeing
that there isn't jealousy in those eyes.
Wesley still slumped against the wall, surrounded by
pictures of himself...
FLASH: Wesley reflected in Cross's pupils.
Holy shitl!! Cross was his father!!! Wesley looks up at
Anna's kind face...
ANNA (CONT'D)
When your father and I found each other,
when we had Andrew, he said he could no
longer live the way he had been living.
He said he wouldn't give us up, the way
he had given up his first eon.
Wesley stares at the picture... he can't believe he was
being watched back when he felt so alone.
ANNA (CONT'D)
It was his greatest regret.
She leaves him in the room, alone, with his brother.
Wesley watches the kid, trying to process it all.
For the first time, emotions overcome him, and he breaks
down...
.but he's too tough now to sob, so he forces the Bob
down in his throat and blinks back the tears. Goddamn,
he has a brother.
IN THE KITCHEN OF THE SAFEHOUSE - NIGHT - LATER
He walks up behind Anna, who is sipping some coffee at a
kitchen table, red eyed.
ANNA
would you like some coffee?
WESLEY
I'm okay.
Wesley sets the key down on the table.
WESLEY (CONT'D)
Do you know what this opens?
CUT TO:
84.
A LONE KEYHOLE in a solid closet door.
Wesley sticks the key in and swings the door open
revealing a LONG BLACK COAT, just like his father's.
ANNA
I guess it's not much of an inheritance.
WESLEY
(STEELY)
He left me more than this.
Wesley takes the coat and folds it over his arm.
ANNA
I want you to know that he forgave you
before you ever pulled the trigger. He
tried to keep you out of it for so
long...
WESLEY
Why didn't he just tell me?
ANNA
once they had you... he couldn't risk it
unless you were alone. He knew his one
shot at telling you might be his last.
Her eyes harden a little bit.
ANNA (CONT'D)
You have to finish what he was doing,
Wesley. It's the only way any of us will
ever be free. Especially your brother.
They won't stop hunting us... your father
knew that.
Wesley nods.
WESLEY
I'll be back as soon as this is over.
ANNA
You have family here.
Wesley nods, these words meaning so much to him.
Sloan, the Butcher and the Pharmacist walk across the
parking lot toward the door of the smoking Bar-b-que
joint.
WESLEY (V.0.)
60 During his life, he was said to have
killed over four hundred bears and was
the pride of this small community on the
Rhine. You want to know how he died? A
pair of black bears singled out his house
from the entire village, mauled his wife,
killed his twin daughters, and then lied
in wait for him to get back from the
woods.
SIRENS wail and a HELICOPTER hovers nearby as Wesley
stands on a roof, looking down on the scene. He sees
EMT's roll a gurney out toward an ambulance as COPS cover
every inch of the ground.
From where he is, it looks like every cop in the city is
here.
ON THE GROUND:
One COP looks up and sees a figure on the roof, long
jacket blowing in the breeze. Surprisingly conspicuous.
COP
What the fuck?
K
COP 2
What is it?
The first cop points up toward Wesley on the roof.
COP 2 (CONT'D)
(into the radio)
Air Support can you get a beam on the
four-story southeast of our position?
ON THE ROOFTOP:
Quickly, a spotlight lights up the spot where Wesley was
standing, but now we see it's iust an air-conditioning
vent with soave loose streamers flapping off of it. Damn,
it looked just like Wesley a moment ago... was it?
HELICOPTER PILOT
(on the radio)
Negative, roof is clean.
Wesley steps out of a dark doorway, his hard eyes
following a police car as it roars by without noticing
him.
98.
He pulls his jacket collar up, puts on.a skull cap, and
takes off in the opposite direction, away from the scene.
He passes a newspaper dispenser, but the CAMERA STAYS.on
the front page, which is still talking about Henry Helms.
The CAMERA HOLDS ON A photograph of Helms, which...
DISSOLVES TO:
Morning...
A gaggle of large bodyguards surround the Helmses as they
hurry out of a side door and make it into a LIMOUSINE.
They notice the half dozen MOTORCYCLE COPS positioned
around their limo.
A LEAD BODYGUARD holds the limo door for them.
HENRY HELMS
(re: the cops)
What's all this?
LEAD BODYGUARD
We're not taking any chances.
He shuts the door for them before climbing behind the
steering wheel.
The limo starts to make its way down the drive, flanked
in front and in back by dark SUBURBANS and the motorcycle
cops.
Commercial ships cruise up and down a river, under an
expansive BRIDGE.
99.
Sitting next to the incline to the bridge, is an
abandoned four story building, what used to be.a
HOSPITAL.
On another tall building, Sloan talks into a radio.
SLOAN
Hold until I give the word.
He clicks off the radio and looks into his palm, where-
e's holding that pearl handled aun, fingering the dried
blood.
ON A CITY STREET:
The suburbans and cops flank the limo as it rolls through
the concrete jungle.
IN THE LIMO:
The bodyguards peer up at the buildings ready for
anything.
Henry Helms reaches over and grabs his wife's hand, a
reassuring gesture. But his white knuckles betray his
trepidation.
The driver watches as they reach a frontage road on the
east side of the river.
ON THE ROAD:
They make a turn along the river and haul ass toward the
bridge. Traffic is sparse and they look like they have
an easy clear passing.
ON THE HOSPITAL ROOFTOP:
The Gunsmith sits, waiting patiently...
100.
ON ANOTHER ROOFTOP:
Sloan watches the Limo starting to approach the bridge.
SLOAN
(into the radio)
Here comes the car. Any minute now.
Take your positions.
Sloan leans out over the edge of his building, gun ready.
QUICK SHOTS:
On the hospital roof, the Gunsmith puts down his
binoculars and picks up a rifle.
The Pharmacist leans over the edge of a building and
looks down, high-powered rifle in his hand.
On another building, the Chef does the same.
And on still another building, the Gardener also gets
ready.
Each killer is in a different spot and has a gun, pointed
and ready, just waiting for the signal...
ON THE ROAD:
The limo is about halfway up the incline now, a sitting
duck, hellfire about to rain down upon it.
ON THE HOSPITAL ROOFTOP:
The Gunsmith waits, waits, waits...
.and then, out of nowhere, surprising the hell out of
him, a knife is held to his neck from behind.
The Gunsmith doesn't even so much as swallow, as the
blade is so tight against his throat that it draws a drop
of blood.
GUNSMITH
(NERVOUSLY)
Wesley?
The CAMERA MOVES TO THE SIDE to show Wesley crouched
right behind him, a look of icy determination on his face
as he holds the knife in place.
101.
WESLEY
(GROWLS)
The name is Cross.
In the distance, the Helms limo moves on, safely.
WESLEY
Looks like you missed your chance. Now
where is Sloan?
The Gunsmith feels the edge in Wesley's voice.
GUNSMITH
You don't understand, man. This ain't
about Helms. The Intern told you right
where to go...
He smiles.
GUNSMITH (CONT'D)
.I'm just the decoy.
THE CAMERA WHIPS around behind Wesley... to show that
three laser sights are lighting up his back in a perfect
pattern.
And now we see it, this was al a Bet-up to get Wesley in
the open. The three surrounding rooftops, slightly more
elevated, hold each of the three assassins crouched-in
sniper positions, zeroed in on Wesley's back.
But instead of surprise, Wesley just leans in closer to
the Gunsmith's ear.
WESLEY
(WHISPERS)
She told me that, too.
And with that, he rolls the o0 over of ,
just as the assassins on the higher rooftops all unleash
a hail of bullets.
BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! The Gunsmith takes a dozen
shots, all in the chest, but none of the bullets make it
through the Gunsmith's body.
WESLEY (CONT'D)
Should've studied your anatomy, fellas.
Wesley FIRES BACK indiscriminately at the neighboring
rooftops, lying on his back, using the.dead assassin's
body as a shield.
102.
Quickly, he bucks the Gunsmith's body off of him and
scampers for a nearby stairwell.
ON THE ROOFTOPS:
The assassinB-all disappear from their positions and head
to the street.
CUT TO:
We've seen this place before. It's the same roof where
cross took out the second head of
The door is kicked open and Wesley walks out, eyes
blazing.
Sloan is waiting for standing t feet away,
holding his father's pearl-handled gun, trained right on
Wesley's head.
SLOAN
Can't say I don't have a sense of irony.
The place I first decided to bring you
in.
Wesley is clutching his wounded shoulder with his wounded
hand as blood starts to seep out of it in big red drops.
SLOAN (CONT'D)
You once asked why I helped hide you as
an infant... It gave me power, Wesley'.
Power to become a head of the Fraternity.
Power over your father. And ultimately
it gave me you: the perfect weapon to
kill your father.
WESLEY
But now you have to dispose of the
weapon.
SLOAN
In some ways it pains me to do so. You
460 are like the son I never had.
106.
WESLEY
Fuck you.
Sloan's eyes narrow.
SLOAN
Fine. Keep your worthless dignity.
You're still just the same loser we
plucked off the street six weeks ago.
Wesley continues to bleed, taking this in. Sloan laughs
derisively.
SLOAN (CONT'D)
You can't win, Wesley. The Fraternity is
everywhere. Even if you kill me others
will come from other cities to take my
place. You'll be hunted your whole life.
(BEAT)
But that's not gonna happen. Like I told
you before, when we are called, death is
as certain as the sun.
Wesley stands as straight as he can muster. The two men
face each other like two gunmen on Main Street in Dodge
city... an old newspaper even blows through like a
tumbleweed.
And we are close on Wesley's face. act it i the
same shot from the opening of the movie.
WESLEY
Six weeks ago, I was ordinary and
pathetic.
We see now that his healthy hand is inching away from his
bleeding arm, reaching into his sleeve...
WESLEY (CONT'D)
But not today.
With that, he nulls out the matching pearl-handled gun,
the twin-brother of the one Sloan is holding, and they
both open fire...
.Wesley shoots Sloan's bullets out of the air and Sloan
does the same. Just like he did with h' father.
.But Sloan is good, and one of the bullets finds it's
mark, hitting Wesley sSMarely in the same arm that took
the knife.
107.
WESLEY (CONT'D
Uhhh!
He can't raise his arm, it's useless, but he's come too
damn far to stop now... he flips his gun from his good
hand to his bad hand and manages to keep FIRING!
Then Wesley does something unexpected... he starts
sprinting straight at Sloan, still knocking his bullets
out of the air...
He closes the gap... ten feet... five feet...
..a surprised and worried expression now spreads on
Sloan's face,.like what is this kid doing?
But Wesley is not stopping, he shoots the gun out of
Sloan's hand and then closes on him, tackling him off his
feet!
They go flying right over the edge of the building.
Wesley's able to grab on to a railing cable and stop
himself...
..but Sloan is going to go over.
At the last moment, Sloan reacher. for-something.
anything. and grabs one-handed the barrel of
Wesley's gun...
For a moment, they dangle there in this precarious

It's true. Six weeks ago I was ordinary
and-pathetic. Just like you.
He sits up, moving OUT OF FRAME.
CUT TO:
The place is now blanketed with cops, looking at the dead
bodies, trying to make sense of what happened.
WESLEY (V.0.)
But I've learned something in that time.
I've learned about the man who made me.
Cope stand on the street, handing out pictures of Wesley,
asking pedestrians if they've seen this man.
WESLEY (V.O.)
I've learned about the man I am.
The door to the safehouse opens, and Anna, Wesley and
Andrew step out into the bright sunlight. Wesley is
carrying his little brother.
109.
They turn and head up the street, toward the eastern sun.
The CAMERA RISES UP, UP, UP, where it hovers for a
