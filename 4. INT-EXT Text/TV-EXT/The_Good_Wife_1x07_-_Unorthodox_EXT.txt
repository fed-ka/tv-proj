      oddly.  See an Orthodox man passing.

                                  KALINDA

                    near here--

                    Excuse me?  Are you looking for me?

      They turn to find a confident and sunny Orthodox housewife, 
      returning to her house with groceries.  ANNA LOEB, (27), 
      elegantly though conservatively dressed, worldly.  

                                  ALICIA
                    No, we re actually... Are you...?  

                                  ANNA
                    Anna.  Jonas Stern s daughter.  

    It takes them a second, actually more than a second to absorb 
      this.   Alicia and Kalinda stare at the Orthodox woman.  

                                  ALICIA
                    I m sorry, I...

                          (chuckles)
                    Don t worry, I get that a lot from 
                    dad s friends.  This is me now.  Hi.

                                  KALINDA
                    ...Hi.


      Alicia and Kalinda wait on the doorstep looking in at Isaac 
    and Anna talking, discussing.  Mostly Isaac talking.

                                  ALICIA
                    Wow.  

                                  KALINDA
                    Yeah.  A year ago she was club-
                    hopping with Tara Reid.  You know 
                    what she ll be doing in another 
                    year?  Club-hopping with Tara Reid.

      Alicia smiles at Kalinda s cynicism:

                                  ALICIA
                    Have you ever been surprised by 
                    anyone?

                                  KALINDA
                    Nope.

                                  ALICIA
                    Even me?

                                  KALINDA
                    Especially by you.  

      Alicia laughs as Isaac approaches.  Closes the door.

                                  ISAAC
                    Sorry, I know Anna probably told 
                    you: we ve already hired a lawyer.  
                    He did work for my brother on a 
                    foreclosure, and he s very good.  
                    But thank you.

                                  ALICIA
                    Isaac, could you just tell us what 
                    happened?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #106   "Unorthodox"   GOLD COLLATED   10/29/09    8.

                    Are you Jewish?

                                  ALICIA
                    Am I-- Is that important?

                                  ISAAC
                    To understand what happened, yes.

                                  KALINDA
                    It s important to be Jewish to 
                    understand a slip-and-fall?

                                  ISAAC
                    Yes, I m sorry you came all this way, 
                    Mrs...? 

                                  ALICIA
                    Florrick.

      Isaac pauses, startled:  Florrick? 

                                  ISAAC
                    You re...?

      Alicia exhales, nods.  Here we go again.  But Isaac takes a 
      second, thrilled.  

                                  ISAAC (CONT D)
                    Your husband was a great man, Mrs. 
                    Florrick.  A very great man.

      Alicia pauses, surprised as Kalinda shoots her a smile.

                                  ISAAC (CONT D)
                    The hate crimes on 58th, he put the 
                    skinheads away for life.  He took us 
                    seriously.  How s he doing?

                                  ALICIA
                    He s... in prison.

                                  ISAAC
                    Yes, I m sorry.  A righteous man 
                    quickly finds the world aligned 
                    against him.

      Kalinda clears her throat: yep,  righteous.

                                  ALICIA
                    Thank you, Isaac.  Actually, can 
                    you just show us what happened, 
                    since we came all this way?   

      Isaac considers it, considers her.  The mood completely 
      changed now.  And... 


      ...click-- a photo of a wire fifteen feet overhead.  Thinner 
      than a telephone wire, it seems to serve no purpose.  Click-- 
      another shot of the same wire connected to a thin pole.  Click-- 
    the wire runs from pole to pole down the street.

                                  ISAAC
                    It s an eruv wire.

      Kalinda takes pictures as Alicia walks with Isaac and Anna:  

                                  ALICIA
                    A what?   

                                  ISAAC
                    You know the Sabbath is a holy day 
                    of rest?  
                          (Alicia nods)
                    An exception is made for minor work, 
                    like carrying a baby or groceries, 
                    in a community s courtyard.

                                  ANNA
                    But there are no courtyards these 
                    days so the eruv wire--
                          (points to the wire)
                    --creates a symbolic courtyard.  For 
                    the whole neighborhood.

                                  ALICIA
                    So... this  eruv  wire fell?

                                  ISAAC
                    Yes, from there.

    The corner of the Loeb house where the eruv wire attached.  

                                  ALICIA
                    And it s not the responsibility of 
                    the community?

                                  ISAAC
                    No.  It s on our property.

                    she s suing you for 1.2 million.  I

      Alicia turns, sees a man leaning against the stoop.  RYAN 
      ALPRIN (33).  Not orthodox.  Handsome but quirky, wildly 
      unpredictable, wildly unlawyer-like, and wildly... well& wild.  

                                  ISAAC
                    Mr. Alprin, there you are.  This is 
                    the other lawyer Anna mentioned.

                                  ALICIA
                    We were just discussing the suit.  
                    We think our firm could offer you 
                    some... assistance.

                                  RYAN
                    Odd, I didn t know I needed some... 
                      assistance.

      Ryan turns to Isaac.  A second.  Alicia looks between them.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Mr. and Mrs. Loeb, why don t you 
                    give us a moment to talk.  

                                  ISAAC
                    Yes, please.  Ryan, if you could 
                    make this work, we would prefer 
                    that.  And, Mrs. Florrick, next 
                    time you see your husband, please 
                    tell him how much he is 
                    appreciated. 

      Ryan turns to Alicia at the name, studies her.  Of course, 
      that Florrick.  Isaac and Anna start back toward the house as 
      Alicia and Ryan wait.  All smiles.  Then... the client s gone.

                                  RYAN
                    So, I do the depositions, the pre-
                    trial motions, prep for next week s 
                    trial, and here comes the 600 pound 
                    gorilla.

                                  ALICIA
                    Yep, that s me, 600 pounds.  
                    Stocking feet.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #106   "Unorthodox"   GOLD COLLATED   10/29/09    11.

                          (checks her watch)
                    ...two hours ago.  Our firm is doing 
                    this as a favor to Mrs. Loeb.  Why 
                    willful and wanton conduct?

    But Ryan starts off.  Alicia shoots Kalinda an  I ll handle 
      this  look, follows...

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Look, I was put on this case.  It s 
                    not my choice.  And I really don t 
                    care if it s your choice.  So call 
                    it 600 pound gorilla or whatever 
                    you want, but I m now your second 
                    chair. 

      Ryan looks over at her.  Shrugs.

                                  RYAN
                    They saw the eruv wire was down; 
                    they knew it could trip somebody 
                    up; and they didn t try to repair 
                    it.  That s why it s willful and 
                    wanton conduct, and subject to high 
                    punitive damages.

                                  ALICIA
                    They admitted that?

                                  RYAN
                    In their depositions.  

                                  ALICIA
                    And-- Why did they admit that?  

      Ryan stops by his motorcycle, puts on his helmet.

                                  RYAN
                    The wire fell on the Sabbath.  They 
                    couldn tdo anything.

                                  RYAN
                    It s a perfect legal trap.  It 
                    fulfills the demands of civil 
                    liability because their religion 
                    wouldn t let them act.  

                                  ALICIA
                    And your defense?

                                  RYAN
                    My defense is to suggest you go tell 
                    your boss you re meeting regularly 
                    with me, and I m doing a great job.  
                    And let me win this case.

      Ryan revs his engine, and Alicia yells over it:

                                  ALICIA
                    It s not going to happen, Mr. 
                    Alprin.  We re in this together.

    But Ryan races off, and Alicia watches him go.

      Ryan opening his door.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Hello, Mr. Alprin, we-- 

    But Ryan turns inside, lets the door swing closed, but Alicia 
      catches it, enters.

                                  EZRA
                    Shoymer is a purely volunteer 
                    policing force for the Hasidim.  
                    Mostly we deal with hate crimes. 

      Kalinda, with Nikon, walks with EZRA, an Orthodox college 
      student in his 20s.  Modern, a street accent.  Mutual 
      respect.  Pragmatist to pragmatist.

                                  EZRA (CONT D)
                    We don t carry guns; we have no 
                    power to arrest.  We carry walkie-
                    talkies and badges, that s it.  

                                  KALINDA
                    And you were the first responders 
                    on the scene?  

                                  EZRA
                    Yeah, right here.  Lady was on her 
                    back, screaming.  Really in pain.   

                                  KALINDA
                    On her back?  She fell forward.

                                  EZRA
                    Yeah, she rolled on her back.  
                    There was a lot of broken glass in 
                    her groceries. 

    Oh, Kalinda nods.  Points toward a surveillance camera on a 
      pole overlooking the scene:

                                  KALINDA
                    That seems to have a direct view.

                                  EZRA
                    It was put in before the lady fell, 
                    but it wasn t hooked up until 
                    after. 

                                  KALINDA
                    Unlucky.

                                  EZRA
                    Yeah.  Just happened that way.  
                    With the hate crimes around here, 
                    we have almost every square yard of 
                    this street covered by cameras.

      Kalinda nods, zooms her Nikon in on a deli across the street.  
      Pans along the roofline.  Yep.  Another surveillance camera, 
    two actually.

                                  KALINDA
                    Can I ask a favor, Ezra.  Could you 
                    stand here-- where Dawn fell.  

                                  EZRA
                    Sure.


      Alicia sits with a sandwich outside court.  A beautiful day.   
    She looks up from case notes, sees... 

      ...Isaac and Anna in the shade.  Isaac talking on a cell.  
      Anna behind him, looking off in the other direction.  Almost 
      back to back.  

      Alicia eyes them.  Is that a picture of marriage?  Two people 
    at cross purposes?  No connection?  But Alicia suddenly sees...

      ...Isaac reaching his hand behind him.  And Anna feeling the 
      touch of his hand, places her palm in his.  It s a tiny 
      little glimpse of intimacy.  More passionate than a kiss.  
      Private.  Intended for no one else.  And...



                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #106   "Unorthodox"   GOLD COLLATED   10/29/09    30.

      ...Alicia smiles.  Marriages are just mysteries.  Ryan flops 
    on the bench beside Alicia, eating potato chips. 

                                  ALICIA
                    Nice cross.

                                  RYAN
                    Thanks.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Where d you go to school?

                                  RYAN
                          (looks at her)
                    So we re getting intimate now?

                                  ALICIA
                    Yep, school talk.  Very personal.

                                  RYAN
                    Samford University.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Stanford, really?

                                  RYAN
                    No, Samford, Cumberland.  Ranked in 
                    the top 133 of law schools.

      Alicia smiles.  Okay.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    I make up in passion what I lack in 
                    law books. 

                                  ALICIA
                    You re good.

      Ryan smiles, gets up, starts toward court.  Alicia watches him 
    go.  


      Alicia exits, exhales deeply, sees Ryan hanging up his cell.  
      Quiet:

                                  RYAN
                    They want to talk settlement.  They 
                    know we ve lost our First Amendment 
                    argument; now they want to pick our 
                    pockets.

                                  ALICIA
                    We don t have a lot of options.  *


      Isaac and Anna.  They approach court.  A pronounced gap between 
      them.  A marriage on the rocks.  They re eyed by... 

      ...Alicia.  Frazzled herself.  They both see her.  Nod.  And 
      Isaac moves past as Anna pauses with Alicia.  Tired.  

                                  ANNA
                    It s going to be hard.  

                                  ALICIA
                    I know, I m sorry.

                                  ANNA
                    I can see-- even with small things-- 
                    he doesn t trust me.  It s like 
                    with my dad-- after rehab the first 
                    time-- he looked at me differently.  
                    Like I was a time bomb.  

      A hard thought.  Anna faces it.

                                  ALICIA
                    I m sure Isaac wants it to work.

                                  ANNA
                    He does.  You can t just throw a 
                    marriage away.  Can you?

      Alicia shakes her head, looks up, sees Ryan passing.  And...

      OMITTED3535


      ...bang-- Alicia bangs out the door, Ryan beside her, the two 
      sharply whispering:



                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #106   "Unorthodox"   GOLD COLLATED   10/29/09    56.
      CONTINUED:4040


                                  ALICIA
                    This is what you re going to do.  
                    After jury instructions, you turn 
                    yourself in, or I m going to the 
                    judge.

                                  RYAN
                    This is all a mistake.

      Alicia stops, turns to him:

                                  ALICIA
                    Don t.  I mean it.  

                                  RYAN
                    I m sorry.  

                                  ALICIA
                    No, this is not one of those 
                     sorry  things.  Turn yourself in, 
                    or I will.

    And Alicia charges on ahead.  Jaws set to keep in the emotion.
