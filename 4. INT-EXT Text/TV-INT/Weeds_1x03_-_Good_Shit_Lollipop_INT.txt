    CLOSE UP - ISABEL (DAY 1)77

    Nervous, sweating, embarrassed.  We PULL BACK to see she s in 
    her nightgown standing on a scale in the middle of Celia s 
    bathroom getting weighed by CELIA like a prize fighter before 
  a title bout.  This has the feeling of ritual.

    The scale swings back and forth WILDLY until finally settling 
    on a number just south of one hundred pounds.  Ouch.  Isabel 
    radiates guilt, shame, defeat.  Celia radiates 
    disappointment, anger, determination.

                                CELIA
                  You ve been sneaking food.

                  I gotta get dressed for school.

    Isabel slinks out.  Celia yells after her.

    Forgot she was coming?  Completely out of character.  Nancy 
    shrugs it off.  Pulls his weekly buy out of her shoulder bag.

    She stands.  Hands the forms back to the Assistant.

                  I ll need one form of 
                  identification.  Driver s license.  
                  Passport.  Military ID. 

    Nancy digs in her bag for her driver s license.  Hands it 
    over.  The Assistant makes a quick xerox.  Hands it back.

                                ASSISTANT (cont d)
                  That ll be one hundred dollars.

    Nancy pays in cash.  A pre-signed card is stamped.  And she s 
    done.

1313SCENE OMITTED 


    Nancy is buzzed in through a metal door.

    Wow.  It s nice inside.  Glass cases.  New Age music playing.  
    An ATM up against one wall, a rent-a-cop standing against 
    another.

    And in those glass cases: Buds.  Seeds.  Plants.  Cuttings.  
    Hash.  Trims.  Crystals.  Candy bars.  Lollipops.  Hemp oils.  
    Hash oils.  Every conceivable form of marijuana.  A trio of 
    young hip Salespeople dressed in identical lab coats stand 
    behind the counters. 

    Nancy s wide-eyed.  Amazed.  Concerned.  How the hell can she 
    possibly compete with all this?  CRAIG X-- beard, glasses, 
    suit-- appears in front of Nancy anticipating her confused 
    state.

    getting, plus what she originally left on the table.  Starts 
    to exit.

    Heylia shoots a death stare at Conrad.  He quickly shuts his 
    mouth.  Nancy starts to exit.  Conrad pulls Nancy aside.

    Shane is dressed in camouflage patterned clothing.  He 
    methodically checks and loads a BB gun like Rambo getting 
    ready to do battle with an entire army.

                  So, Julie Googled  how to give a 
                  blow job  and found this web site 
                  that teaches girls how to deep 
                  throat.

                                SILAS
                  I heard Megan can do that.  Dennis 
                  Kling says her mouth is like a dirt 
                  devil.

                                CALEB
                  Daredevil?  He s blind, not deaf, 
                  and I don t think he sucks dick at 
                  all.  He s a hero.

    Silas takes the beer out of Caleb s hand, pours it out, then 
    gets up, heads off by himself.

    SCENE OMITTED2121


    Silas comes upon MEGAN BEALS-- young, pretty, deaf-- spray 
    painting over graffiti that reads:  MEGAN GIVES GOOD HEAD .  
    She s crossing out the word GOOD and writing in the word 
    GREAT.    

    Obviously she doesn t hear Silas come up behind her.  He 
    stands there and makes dumb noises that she can t hear to 
    amuse himself.

                  Megan!  Boo!  Yeeoww!

    She doesn t respond.  Silas is cracking himself up.  When 
    she s done, she stands back to admire her work. Bumps into 
    him.  Turns around, startled.

    He smiles at her drunkenly.  She tries to get past him.  He 
    playfully blocks her path.  She changes course, tries to get 
    past him again.  He blocks her once more.  Flashes another 
    drunken smile.  

    She looks at him.  Knows exactly what he wants.  Smiles. 
    Motions for Silas to undo his pants.   He does eagerly.  Then 
    closes his eyes as she lowers herself out of frame.  

    Suddenly he hears a whizzing sound.  His eyes shoot open.  He 
    looks down to see Megan spray painting his dick a deep shade 
    of blue.   

    He quickly pulls away.  She gets up off her knees.  Flashes 
    one last smile at him.  Walks off leaving Silas looking like 
    Violet Beauregarde.

    Popcorn.  Tons of it.  Nancy-- the phone glued to her ear--

    Just then Nancy sniffs the air.

                  God-- that smells amazing.

    An alarmed Nancy drops the phone.  Wipe away SPLIT SCREEN.  
    She throws open the oven.  Starts extracting tins of freshly 
    baked cornbread.  Burns herself.

                                NANCY
                  Ow!  Damn it!

    She drops one of the tins.  She goes to the sink and runs 
    cold water over her burned finger.  Hears POP, POP, POP.  
    Goes to check the popcorn.  Wasn t that.  Then turns to see 
    Shane run in holding the BB gun.

                                SHANE
                  I did it!  I shot the mountain 
                  lion!  I shot the mountain lion!

    But before Nancy can process what Shane s talking about all 
    the popcorn starts POPPING WILDLY.

                  That s great sweetie.  Go get ready 
                  for bed.

    Shane heads upstairs swaggering victoriously like Ernest 
    Hemingway after a big game kill.  

    Nancy tends to all the popping popcorn.  As she does, we see 
    Silas silently and stealthily enter in the background of the 
    shot.  He tries to hide the blue paint that s beginning to 
    bleed through the crotch of his pants.  He quickly disappears 
    up the stairs.

    Nancy s oblivious to this as she finally gets the popcorn and 
    the cornbread under control.  Then remembers that she left 
    Conrad hanging on the phone.  

    She runs to pick the phone back up.  But the line s dead.  
    She hits redial.

    dead in her tracks.  We see her face cloud over.  Too late.  
    Major equipment malfunction.

                                DEAN (cont d)
                  Good night, sweetie.

                   Night, Dad.

    He kisses her.  Turns off the light.  Exits.

    Celia s on top of the bed doing a crossword puzzle.  Her face 
    is covered in an  ice mask.   It s truly frightening.  Dean 
    enters with his laptop.  

                                DEAN
                  I m worried about Isabel.  Maybe we 
                  should take her to the doctor 
                  tomorrow-- make sure she doesn t 
                  have some kind of stomach flu.

                                CELIA
                  Oh please-- She s perfectly fine.

                                DEAN
                  She shit herself in school.  How is 
                  that fine?

                                CELIA
                  She shit herself because she was a 
                  little piggy.  I found her 
                  chocolate stash the other day and I 
                  switched it out for laxative bars.

    Dean just stares at Celia in disbelief.

                                CELIA (cont d)
                  What?  It was a good plan.  Maybe 
                  next time she ll think twice before 
                  scarfing down a whole bag of 
                  chocolate.  

    Dean continues to stare at her.

                                CELIA (cont d)
                  Come on-- I eat those same 
                  laxatives in reasonable amounts 
                  every day and I don t shit all over 
                  myself.

    Dean s outrage silently builds.

                                CELIA (cont d)
                  Look, I didn t mean for this to 
                  happen-- I was just hoping for some 
                  nice loose doodies.  Clean the girl 
                  out a bit.

    Dean angrily grabs a pillow and blanket.  Heads to the door.  
    Turns back.  Stares daggers at his wife.

    But little Isabel is otherwise engaged.  Busy switching out 
    Celia s diet pills for Immodium anti-diarrhea pills.  She 
    hears her mother calling.  Quickly finishes up.  Runs out.

                                CELIA (O.S.)

    Isabel comes into the kitchen.  Sits at the breakfast table 
    like a good little girl.  Dean puts down his newspaper.  
    Leans over to her pointedly.

    Dean smiles at Isabel.  Glares at Celia.  Goes back to his 
    newspaper.  Isabel flashes the slightest trace of her demonic 
    Jack Nicholson grin.  Celia remains oblivious to it all.

                  hear?  Someone killed the 
                  Alderson s cat, and it wasn t the 
                  mountain lion.  Alison is losing

                  I read somewhere that killing small 
                  animals is the first sign of 
                  psychotic behavior.  You should 
                  probably tell the parents so they 
                  can rush the little sociopath into 
                  therapy before he starts tooling 
                  around Agrestic in a white van with

    The usual poker game.  The usual potheads.  Only the cards 
    and chips have been pushed off to the side.  The center of 
    the table is now taken up by straw cellophane wrapped Mrs. 
    Beasley s-like gift baskets filled with cookies, cornbread, 
    popcorn balls, and of course, weed.  We PAN UP to see Nancy 
    proudly standing behind it all.

                  You mean everything in there is 
                  loaded with--

                                NANCY
                  It sure is.  But that s not all I m 
                  offering.  For the old school 
                  smokers in the room, I ve got some 
                  wild and wonderful Indica/sativa 
                  blends, organic or hydroponic, 
                  sticky, hairy and just delicious to 
                  smoke.

    Nancy grabs a basket.  Unwraps it.  Pushes it toward them.

                                NANCY (cont d)
                  Please, help yourselves to samples.  

    They all grab at various items in the basket.  Nancy 
    nervously awaits the verdict.  Doug takes a piece of 
    cornbread.  Places it in his mouth.  Closes his eyes.  Savors 
    it.  

                                NANCY (cont d)
                  So?

    Takes a moment.  Finally passes judgment: 

                                DOUG 
                  Fuck me-- that s awesome!

    They all go for the cornbread.  Smiling.  Nodding.

                  I think I could exist off nothing 
                  but this for the rest of my life.

                                NANCY
                  I m glad you like it.  So, here s 
                  my final pitch, guys.  The clubs 
                  are fun and everything, but with 
                  me, you get great shit right here 
                  in town.  I know what you like, and 
                  I make sure it s there when you 
                  want it so you don t have to 
                  schlepp into the city.  But most of 
                  all, I don t xerox your driver s 
                  license and put your name in a 
                  State controlled data bank.

                  that sooner.

                  Eh.  

    Doug stuffs his mouth with green corn bread.

    They all start going for the baskets.  Throwing cash at her.  
    She dutifully collects it all up.  Stuffs it in her bag.

    Thank God!  It worked!  She s incredibly relieved.  She pulls 
    Doug aside.

    stick his finger in the mixing bowl.  She quickly slaps his

    He takes a step back.  Thinks he s in trouble.  Instead she 
    grabs him.  Hugs him.  Tight.  She still thinks he shot the 
    cat, but at least understands where it s coming from.

                                HEYLIA
                  That s right.  You are very polite, 
                  snowflake, but your scratch only 
                  covers last week s buy and the 
                  ring.  You still short for all the 
                  shit you wanna take this week.  So 
                  looks like you got yourself a 
                  business decision to make: the 
                  strange or the Range?

    Nancy s not happy about this.  She thinks it over.  Grabs the 
    weed.

                                NANCY
                  I ll be back.

                                HEYLIA
                  Don t let the door hit your cute 
                  little ass on the way out.

    Nancy glares at Heylia.  Turns to Conrad.

                  Thanks for everything Conrad.  That 
                  cornbread recipe really saved my 
                  cute little ass.

    Nancy exits.  Everyone turns to Conrad.  Uh-oh.  Heylia 
    stares him down.  Takes a deep, deep breath.  Unloads with 
    both barrels:

                                HEYLIA
                  YOU GAVE AWAY MY CORNBREAD

                  it?!?  You don t put weed in my 
                  cornbread!  Plus that recipe a

                  to chase you, it s gonna be worse.

    Isabel is loving every minute of it.  She looks satisfied, 
    avenged, triumphant.  Bites into a candy bar defiantly.

    Nancy, the kids and Lupita are all watching someone screaming 
    on television.  Nancy looks away during the really scary part 
    of the movie and suddenly sees out the window:

    CLOSE UP - A MOUNTAIN LION (NIGHT 4)5252

    At the edge of the backyard.  And there s a small red streak 
    of dried blood falling from its eye like a tear drop.  It 
    stares at her.  Turns.  Disappears into the night.

    CLOSE UP - NANCY (NIGHT 4)5353

    As she smiles to herself.  Has a look on her face that says 
     thank god my son is only slightly fucked up .  She turns 
    back to the television.  Doesn t say anything.  Just 
    continues watching the movie with her family as we...

                                                              FADE OUT.
