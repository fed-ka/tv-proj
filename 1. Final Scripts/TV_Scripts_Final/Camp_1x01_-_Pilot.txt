REVEAL: MARINA, 17, luscious and sexy, with a big heart, too-
tight clothes, and a weak spot for believing the lies boys 
tell in order to get laid.  She looks at KYLE, 35, her mom s 
boyfriend, who RAPS ALONG TO THE EMINEM song on the stereo. 

MARINA

Marina climbs out of the back of the convertible MAZDA and 
Kyle PEELS OUT, kicking up dust.  Marina sees THREE GIRLS her 
age, all baffled by their service-less cell phones.  Marina 
smiles but they freeze her out, like the J. Crew girls always 
 em,   do to the Forever 21 girls.  Marina thinks,  Fuck
tosses back her beautiful hair, and walks.  

S CAR - CONTINUOUS DAD EXT. KIP S

Kip and Larry hug.  Larry gets back in the car. 

LARRY
I love you, buddy. 

KIP
(I love you too)
Can you say that a little louder?

Larry smiles and drives off.  Kip turns to see Marina, walking 
in SLOW MOTION, turning heads.  Look what God did!  Kip has

 smiling!  Maybe his dad was right! She s

But just as that flicker of hope starts to catch fire... a 
guy walks by with some FISHING POLES.  And the tip of one 
CATCHES on Kip s nose ring and PULLS IT OUT.  After a second, 
Kip begins to SHRIEK.  We FREEZE and...

TITLE CARD: CAMP! 

BACK TO KIP:  As PEOPLE rush to Kip, his shrieking FADES OUT 
and we hear a sing-songy, enthusiastic, female voice-over.  

V.O. 
Announcements!  Announcements!  
Annou-ounce-ments!  Welcome to 
Little Hawk Family Camp!

We hear CHEERING as we take a quick tour of LITTLE HAWK 
FAMILY CAMP as CAMPERS descend on its vibrant, rustic beauty.  

-- Good-looking male COUNSELORS help FAMILIES unload their 
cars and tote their luggage to cabins via wheelbarrows.

the LAKE where a gang of PRETTY GIRLS sit on a wooden raft. 

V.O. (CONT D)
So, welcome back to all of you 
returning families and it s nice to 
see some new faces! 

-- A MOTHER chases her two-year-old at the beach.  The 
toddler wreaks havoc, trampling oiled-up sunbathers.

INT. DINING HALL - DAY

MACKENZIE GREENFIELD, director of Camp Little Hawk, the voice 
of the voice-over, stands on a bench with a mic in her hand.  
She s in the middle of the packed dining hall overlooking the 
lake.   Mack  is 40 -- fit, pretty, and relentlessly positive 
-- the ultimate camp person.  Not a mean bone in her body. 

MACKENZIE
You guys, we have so much great 
stuff planned.  I want to see 
everybody at the talent show 
 be shy.  But, no Friday.  Don t
 nudity this year, okay?  I m
talking to you, Mr. McGuinness.  
Seriously.  That was really 
upsetting.  Think of the kids.   

Laughter.  Kip, a bandage on his nose, and Marina, both 
wearing Little Hawk T-shirts, scurry around with the other 
young Counselors in Training (CITs) waiting on tables, a 
little lost amid all the clatter.  Somebody hands Mackenzie a 
note.  She reads. 

MACKENZIE (CONT D)
We have a birthday!  Declan Tracy 
 give him turns seven today.  Let s
a big Little Hawk Happy Birthday...

Kip LOOKS HORRIFIED AS EVERYBODY GETS UP ON THEIR BENCHES AND 
STARTS TO SING.

As little DECLAN runs around the dining hall...

PICK UP: ROBBIE EISENBERG, 22, entering.  A high-achiever, boy-
next-door cute, Robbie is the head of activities.  He takes us 
over to WES CARMICHAEL, 27, his best friend at camp.  Wes is 
in charge of maintenance.  Staggeringly good-looking, a laid-
back force of nature, Wes has three goals in life: food, sex 
and weed.  They raise their voices to talk over the singing. 

ROBBIE
Hey, man.

WES
How was your year?

ROBBIE
Good.  I, uh, got into law school.  
What about you? 

WES
I crewed a boat down to the Turks 
and Caicos with this rich chick, 
taught some snowboarding in Aspen, 
then climbed Machu Picchu and ate 
mushrooms at the top.  But, law

Wes nods at THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DINING ROOM, WHERE SARAH

The song ends.  Sarah looks up to see Robbie and Wes staring 
at her with muted alarm.  She starts laughing and waves.  

 BACK WITH MACKENZIE, waving to friends, tousling Declan s
hair, her jubilance contagious.  She s about to jump off the 
bench when a DAD at one of the tables shouts up to her:

DAD

Mack suddenly looks uncomfortable.  She covers with cheer.  

MACKENZIE

MACKENZIE (CONT D)
But you know what?  Change is good.  
Change is what makes us grow. 

SMASH TO Mack alone in a giant bed, watching TV, surrounded 
by take-out containers and an empty bottle of wine. 

MACKENZIE (O.S.) (CONT D)
Change is a fantastic adventure.

AND BACK WITH MACK, struggling to stay positive. 

MACKENZIE (CONT D)
Besides, you know who is here, Don?  
Me.  And I am up for the job.  

SMASH TO a week ago -- Mack opens a shed to find a BLACK BEAR 
sitting on its furry ass, guzzling ketchup.  Mack SLAMS THE 
DOOR AND LEANS AGAINST IT, TERRIFIED.  Then:

Mackenzie bends over the pipe.  Wes and Roger find themselves 
checking out her ass, enjoying the view of lacy thong peeking 
out of her shorts.  They catch each other and look away.

It was a mutual breakup.

Mack throws the hammer she s holding to emphasize her point, 
it hits the ancient pipe.  Which immediately cracks.  Brown 
water SHOOTS in the air.  Roger laughs on his way to the car.  

ROGER
Okay, you know where to find me.

Mackenzie puts calamine lotion on the red, blistered hands of 
a camper, OLIVER, 12. 

MACKENZIE
Oliver, listen to me.  A poison ivy 
 rash is very contagious.  Don t

suspiciously at all the ropes.
