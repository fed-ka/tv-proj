      WE RE CLOSE ON THE FACE OF a friendly DOCTOR (30s, scrubs). 

                                  DOCTOR
                    He s going to be fine. As heart 
                    attacks go this was pretty mild.  
                    More of a wake-up call to ditch the 
                      cigarettes and take up jogging.

      REVERSE ON

      David and his mom JUDY (40s, Billie Jean King hair) receiving 
      the good news.  Judy looks relieved.  David like he s been 
      tasered.

                                  JUDY
                    Can we see him?

                                  DOCTOR
                          (smiles)
                    I ll take you back.

      She s starting to go with him when she notices David making 
      no move to follow.

                                  JUDY
                    Honey?

                                  DAVID
                    I ll catch up.

      She kisses his cheek, exits.   

      We STAY ON DAVID as he struggles to process what the fuck 
      just happened tonight.

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.



      Wheeler shuts the door and drives the sports car around to a 
      distant parking space.

      He kills the engine, takes out a fat joint, and sparks up.                                                                                      9.



      David slips in the back to watch his girlfriend KAREN (19, 
      cheerleader peppy) teach a class of WOMEN in thong Danskins 
      and tights.  

                                  KAREN
                    ...keep breathing... three... 
                    two... one... You made it!

      The class ends.

                                  KAREN (CONT D)
                    Great work, ladies!

      As the aerobicizers collect their things and go David walks 
      over to see Karen.

                                  KAREN (CONT D)
                          (excited to see him)
                    How s your first day going?!

                                  DAVID
                    Pretty good. Some guy tipped me 
                    fifty bucks!

                                  KAREN 
                    What are you gonna buy me?

      David moves closer, makes a teenaged stab at seductiveness.

                                  DAVID
                    Why don t we discuss it after work? 
                    Mom s been spending nights at the 
                      hospital... we ll have the house to 
                      ourselves.

      He goes for a kiss but she pulls away, nodding to the WOMEN 
      starting to trickle in for her next class. ( Not at work. )

                                  KAREN
                    We can t tonight. Remember? We have 
                    the party...

                                  DAVID
                    What party?

      She puts a finger to his lips to signal  Not so loud. 

                                  KAREN
                          (low)
                    The staff s summer kick-off kegger. 
                      Everyone s going.                                                                                    10.


                                  DAVID
                    Am I allowed to?

                                  KAREN
                    Why wouldn t you?

                                  DAVID
                    Because I m not staff... I mean, 
                      technically. 

                                  KAREN
                          (wry)
                      Technically?

                                  DAVID
                    According to Nash.

                                  KAREN
                    Nash is full of shit. And himself.

      David concedes this with a laugh.  As more WOMEN arrive:

                                  KAREN (CONT D)
                    You d better go. My next class is 
                      starting...

      A quick peck and she s gone, her ass spectacular in Spandex.



      An outdoor dining area overlooking the pool.  Members lunch 
      at umbrella-shaded tables.

      Nash and David arrive.  As they make their way across the 
      patio Nash works the crowd, shaking hands, flirting, etc.

      A MEMBER calls to Nash:

                                  MEMBER #1
                    Think Connors has a shot at winning 
                      Wimbledon?

                                  NASH
                    Hard to say. He ain t getting any 
                    younger. And his net game is for 
                    shit.

                                  MEMBER #2
                    Ever play him?

                                  NASH
                    Once.                                                                                    11.


                                  MEMBER #1
                    Who won?

      A wily Jack Nicholson grin:

                                  NASH
                          (feigns modesty)
                    Well he did make me work for it...

      The table erupts in cheers.  Nash is basking in the adulation 
      when suddenly he stops in his tracks as he sees his nemesis, 
      the club s GOLF PRO (Skip, 30s).

                                  GOLF PRO
                    Nasser.

                                  NASH
                    Skip.

      They give each other a wide berth as they continue past.

                                  DAVID
                          (whispers)
                    Who was that?

                                  NASH
                    Golf pro... 
                          (under his breath)
                      Cocksucker.

      David and Nash take a seat at a TABLE OVERLOOKING THE POOL.  
      As David looks at the menu, Nash lights a cigarette.

                                  NASH (CONT D)
                    So... why NYU?

                                  DAVID
                          (shrugs)
                    I don t know. It s a good school. 
                    Commute s easy--

                                  NASH
                    I mean why are you doing the whole 
                    college thing?

                                  DAVID
                    Why does anyone? 

                                  NASH
                    To get laid.

                                  DAVID
                    And hopefully a job.                                                                                    12.


                                  NASH
                    You ve got a job.

                                  DAVID
                    I mean one I can still be doing 
                    when I m forty.

                                  NASH
                    I m thirty-eight.

                                  DAVID
                    But you played on the pro circuit.

                                  NASH
                    Briefly.

                                  DAVID
                    You beat Jimmy Connors.

      Nash gives him a sly look.

                                  NASH
                    When he was fourteen.

      A WAITRESS comes over.  David is about to order when -- 

                                  NASH (CONT D)
                    Two club sandwiches, extra mayo, 
                    and a couple of Arnold Palmers. 
                    Thanks, sweetheart.

      She collects their menus, exits.  Without missing a beat:

                                  NASH (CONT D)
                    I just hate to see a bright young 
                    guy like you throwing your life 
                    away on an education. And for what? 
                    A desk job and a fax machine? Two 
                    weeks paid vacation in Florida? I 
                    spend the whole winter in Florida, 
                    on the resort circuit getting paid 
                    to work on my tan...

      It s a compelling argument.  David is giving it some thought 
      when he s suddenly distracted by someone who has just exited 
      the womens  locker room.


      SKYE, 19 

      Brunette, bikini-clad, and absolutley foxy.                                                                                    13.


      Heads turn and time slows as she makes her way to a chaise, 
      eyes inscrutable behind Ray-Bans, kicks off her Dr. Scholls, 
      and pads to the diving board... 

      She s about to step onto the metal ladder when she turns and 
      glances David s way. 

      Is it his imagination or does she show him a secret smile? 

      David watches her climb the ladder and swan dive into the 
      pool below with the rapt look of man having a holy vision.



      David is behind the counter stringing a racket when he s 
      approached by a club member named GETTY (late 40s, trim) 
      wearing white shorts and a salmon Le Coq Sportif polo with 
      the collar turned up.

                                  GETTY
                    So... you the new assistant pro?

                                  DAVID
                          (nods)
                    David.

                                  GETTY
                    Doug Getty... You wanna hit?

                                  DAVID
                    Excuse me?

                                  GETTY
                    I m pretty good. It ll be fun for 
                    you. And I have some time to kill.

      David is confused.

                                  DAVID
                    Are you asking to book an hour with 
                    me?

      Getty looks impatient.

                                  GETTY
                            (aggravated)
                    Fine. Whatever. I ll pay for the 
                    hour. Let s just play, already.

      David grabs his racquet.                                                                                    14.



      David watches as his mom fusses over his convalescing father.

                                  JUDY
                    You have to eat.

                                  SAM
                    But the food here is so bland.
                    It s worse than Army chow. Dave, 
                    old buddy, run down to the corner 
                    and get your old man some White 
                    Castle...

                                  JUDY
                    Don t you dare, David. 

      She gives Sam a stern look.                                                                                    15.


                                  JUDY (CONT D)
                    Your White Castle days are over. 
                    When you get home you re going on a 
                    diet and doing my Richard Simmons 
                    tapes with me. I won t have you 
                    scaring me like you did again. 

      She kisses his bald spot.  To all appearances they seem like 
      an ordinary married couple.

      A pretty KOREAN NURSE, 30, enters.  

                                  NURSE
                    How are we doing in here?

      Sam immediately perks up.

                                  SAM
                    Great!

      He blushes like a schoolboy as she listens to his heart.

                                  JUDY
                    Has anyone ever told you you have 
                    the most beautiful eyes?

      David looks hopelessly confused.



      Karen waits outside the hospital entrance in her Honda Civic.

      David gets in.

                                  KAREN
                    How s your dad?

                                  DAVID
                    Fine. I guess.

      Still trying to process his parents  very odd marriage.

                                  DAVID (CONT D)
                    You want to swing by my house so I 
                    can swipe some booze from my folks 
                    liquor cabinet?

                                  KAREN
                    It s okay... I stole a sixpack of 
                    my mom s wine coolers.

                                  DAVID
                    Won t she miss them?                                                                                    16.


                                  KAREN
                    She s too wasted on Darvon to 
                    notice.

                                  DAVID
                    What s that?

                                  KAREN
                          (nods)
                      Painkillers, for cramps.

                                  DAVID
                    They any good?

                                  KAREN
                    When I left she was watching Wheel 
                    of Fortune and trying to buy vowels 
                    that don t even exist.

      She puts the Civic in gear.

                                  KAREN (CONT D)
                    I swear to god I can t wait to get 
                    out of the house... Hey, I have an 
                    idea! Want to look at apartments 
                    this weekend? I know we can t move 
                    in together until after graduation, 
                    but it can t hurt to look, right? 

                                  DAVID
                    Sure.

      With forced enthusiasm.



      Misty holds on for dear life as Wheeler takes her on a wild 
      ride over the hilly greens, testing the upper speed limit of 
      the golf cart s motor.

                                  KAREN
                    You re crazy!

      Wheeler steers towards the crowd milling around the kegs, 
      sending people scattering.

      Suddenly up ahead they see...                                                                                    27.


      Steve LeFevre putting the moves on another female staffer.  
      He blanches at sight of the incoming golf cart speeding at 
      him and starts running. 

      Wheeler laughs maniacally as they chase the fleeing LeFevre 
      across the golf course until he has no choice but dive into a 
      sand trap to escape them.

      Now Misty is laughing too, triumphantly, her hair whipping in 
      the breeze, until --

      The joyride suddenly turns scary as they hit a bump and she s 
      CATAPULTED OUT OF THE CART.

      It happens so fast it s shocking:  one moment she s laughing, 
      having the time of her life, the next she s ejected with such 
      force a broken neck seems certain...

      If not for the WATER TRAP that fortuitously breaks her fall.  
      She lands with a BIG SPLASH and quickly disappears from view.

      Wheeler is horrified.

                                    WHEELER
                    Misty!

      He scrambles out of the cart.  

      Misty pops back into view, her soaking tee clinging to her. 
      Neither she nor Wheeler speak for several stunned seconds as 
      they both marvel at the fact she s unhurt... before burst 
      into relieved laughter.

      Wheeler grins, strips naked and CANNONBALLS into the water.  
      Soon they are splashing each other and frolicking like kids 
      in a swimming pool.

      Soon their co-workers running from all directions, shedding 
      clothes and leaping into the water, in what quickly escalates 
      into an impromptu skinny-dip. 


      TIME CUT - LATER

      David parties with the other staffers in the water trap.  
      He s wasted, any worries about the future obscured by a fog 
      of alcohol and pot smoke.     

      Suddenly he bumps into Nash, who has a girl on his shoulders.  

                                  DAVID
                    Nash!                                                                                    28.


                                  NASH
                    Having fun?

                                  DAVID
                    Epic.

      He s about to take a hit when Nash confiscates the joint.

                                  NASH
                    You might want to go easy on this.  
                    In fact a little coffee wouldn t be 
                    a bad idea... 

                                  DAVID
                    Why?

                                  NASH
                            (downplaying it)
                    We ve got a little problem. That 
                    k nocker you played earlier today? 
                    Getty? 

                                  DAVID
                    The one who got so pissed when I 
                    beat him?

                                  NASH
                          (nods)
                    Well he s president of the board. 
                    And unfortunately he feels your 
                    game isn t strong enough for you to 
                    be employed here.

                                  DAVID
                    But I beat him! 

                                  NASH
                    He says he got three games off you.

                                  DAVID
                    Only because I let him! He was such 
                    a sore fucking loser I felt sorry 
                    for him.

                                  NASH
                    He s pressuring me to fire you.

      David is stunned.

                                  DAVID
                    Are you? Firing me?                                                                                    29.


                                  NASH
                    I won t have any choice if you 
                    don t wipe the court with him. I 
                    mean it. You can t let him get a 
                    single game off of you. Not one.

                                  DAVID
                    What are you talking about? 

                                  NASH
                    I got him to agree to a re-match.  
                    He can t get a single game off you. 
                    You beat him 6-0, you get to keep 
                    your job. If not... it s back to 
                    charging rewind fees at Video City.

      David is quiet as this sinks in.

                                  DAVID
                    When?

                                  NASH
                    Tomorrow morning.

      He suddenly frowns, checks his Timex, corrects himself:

                                  NASH (CONT D)
                    Sorry. This morning. Seven sharp.

      He claps David on the back:  Everything s gonna work out...

      But David s not so sure.



      Karen is wrapping up a Jazzercize class when she sees Barry 
      arrive with a coffee for her.

      Off Barry s smarmy smile...
