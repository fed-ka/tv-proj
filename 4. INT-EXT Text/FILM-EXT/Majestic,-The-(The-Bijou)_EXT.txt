HOLLYWOOD (AERIAL VIEW) - NIGHT
SUPER TITLE: 1951
A gigantic aerial shot.
Postwar autos fill the muggy
midsummer evening air with the sounds of thousands of HONKING
HORNS, a mere precursor to the traffic yet to come.
Darkened
outlying neighborhoods are evidence of the postwar home
construction boom, as scores of stucco bungalows are being
built in the areas surrounding the beating heart of the town,
a swath of garishly bright concrete called
HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD.
PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
Of course, it's not like the
postcards say it is.
This is what
it's like.
I'm Pete Appleton, and
this is my town.
Still in the same shot, we rocket down into the center of the
intersection of Hollywood and Vine, then head west along the
boulevard, skimming just above the traffic -- past Musso and
Frank's Grill and the Hollywood Canteen, past the Egyptian
Theater and a rumbling Pacific Electric Red Car, across
Highland Avenue, past the Paramount Theater, and across the
street to
GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATER.
PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
Born and raised here, thank you
very much.
Sometimes, it seems
like everyone here is from
somewhere else.
But everyone loves
the movies, so Hollywood is
everyone's town, and they come here
by the busload.
To them, Grauman's
Chinese Theater is just about the
most exciting place on the planet.
To me, it's the theater that's
playing "The African Queen."
And like the man said, the film on the marquee is "THE
AFRICAN QUEEN."
Still the same shot, buses disgorge
TOURISTS, who move into the forecourt of the theater.
The
MEN doff their hats and mop their brows.
The WOMEN pull
their blouses away from their chests, fanning themselves with
movie-star maps as they marvel at the signed cement blocks.
We MOVE AMONG THEM, until we pick up A COUPLE, and we stay
behind them as they work their way through the crowd, on
their way to
THE THEATER ENTRANCE,
where an ornately attired DOORMAN smiles and tears their
tickets.
DOORMAN
Newsreel's just starting, folks.
PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
That's me and my girlfriend.
Her
name is Sandra Sinclair, and this
is her town, too -- she's from
Cleveland.
She came out here to be
an actress, and that's just what
she's doing.
The first picture I
ever wrote, a little potboiler
called "Sand Pirates of the
Sahara."
Okay, it ain't "Citizen
Kane," but you gotta start
somewhere.
MOVING INTO THE LOBBY
an explosion of glitz mixed with Chinese myth and legend.
Everywhere you look, it's red and orange and plush carpeting
and golden light.
We MOVE THROUGH the lobby, still in the
same shot, still tracking the couple, heading for the
auditorium doors, which are swept open by two ramrod-erect
USHERS and we move into
THE DARKENED THEATER.
As the couple, Pete and Sandra, find seats, we HEAR the
soundtrack of the film before we see the screen, the
unmistakable strains of a march, and then -- still in the
same shot -- we see the screen...
A NEWSREEL.
As the march SWELLS to a crescendo, we HEAR THE NEWSREEL
ANNOUNCER'S SONOROUS VOICE:
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER
Bringing the news of the world to
you!
Over a newsreel shot of a packed Congressional Committee
Hearing Room, a title blares "HOLLYWOOD REDS GO TO JAIL!"
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER
Four years ago, in one of
filmland's darkest hours, ten men,
the so-called "Hollywood Ten," were
called to testify before the House
Committee of Un-American
Activities, investigating the
proliferation of the dreaded Red
Menace in Hollywood.
We see several shots of WITNESSES engaged in heated verbal
battles with congressmen, especially Committee Chairman T.
JOHNSTON DOYLE and the Majority Counsel, ELVIN CLYDE.
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER
Refusing to answer the lawmaker's
questions, cowering behind the
Fifth Amendment's protection
against self-incrimination, the ten
motion picture writers dared
Congress to come after them.
Well,
come after them they did!
And
after years of court wrangling,
it's now time to pay the piper!
Over shots of several of the "Hollywood Ten" being led to
jail in handcuffs, the newsreel narration continues.
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER
And so, it's off to jail, the
charge: Contempt of Congress!
This
should give you fellas something to
write about now!
A new round of
investigations begins this fall,
the mandate: Get the reds out of
Hollywood!
In the audience, one man YELLS "Lock up the commie
bastards!," and a few others cheer and laugh.
As the
newsreel moves on to a somewhat more innocuous subject, we
WHEEL AROUND AND...
ENDFRAME ON PETE APPLETON AND SANDRA SINCLAIR.
Pete's a handsome fellow in his 30s, and Sandra's a starlet
pretty girl in her mid-20s.
As she rummages in her purse,
Pete watches the newsreel.
SANDRA
Pete, there's time before the
picture starts, you want to get
some popcorn?
PETE
You bet, honey.
Pete kisses Sandra on the cheek, then stands and sprints up
the aisle to the concession stand, a big unworried grin on
his face.
PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
We were young, we were in love, and
we were working in pictures.
Life... was good.
DISSOLVE TO:
UNITED PICTURES STUDIOS - MAIN GATE - MORNING
Pete pulls up to the guard kiosk in his spiffy yellow
convertible Plymouth.
The Guard, RAY, steps out to meet him.
Pete lights up a cigarette.
We get a better sense of him
now.
Though earnest, he's jocular, and a bit of a fast
talker.
PETE
(very chipper)
Mornin', Ray.
Whaddya know whaddya
say?
Me and Sandra caught "The
African Queen" at the Chinese last
night.
Great picture, great
picture.
Ray is nonplussed.
Tips his hat.
Regards Pete suspiciously.
RAY
Mr. Appleton.
PETE
What's with this "Mr. Appleton"
crap?
Your boss hiding in there?
RAY
You're clear to go in.
PETE
What's that mean?
Ray heads back to his kiosk, shaking his head.
RAY
Have a pleasant day.
Pete, covering his worry well, drives onto the lot.
UNITED PICTURES STUDIOS - WRITER'S BUILDING - MORNING
Pete pulls up, hops out, grinds out his cigarette, looks
around and goes inside.
STUDIO STREET - DAY
FROM FAR AWAY, we watch as Leo and Pete come out of the
Writer's Building and join a flood of DRESS EXTRAS, all done
up in Puritan pilgrim garb and heading for the commissary.
As they move through the mob and emerge on the other side,
it's clear that Pete is reeling from something he's just been
told.
PETE AND LEO
LEO
Peter, their hands are tied.
You
see that, don't you?
PETE
I... I don't believe this.
LEO
Are you saying it's a mistake, that
you didn't go to any meetings?
They say you did.
PETE
Who the hell is this "they?"
LEO
Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it
don't matter who the hell "they"
is.
"They" know who "they" are,
that's all that matters.
(deliberately)
Now, did you go to any meetings?
PETE
(on the spot)
No.
Yeah... I... I don't know.
Maybe I did.
Leo, this was before
Pearl Harbor.
I was in college.
It was a bunch of kids, and I was
just one of 'em.
I didn't believe
in what they were saying.
Hell, I
didn't even know what they were
saying!
LEO
So, you're saying that it's true.
You went to a meeting of a known
communist organization.
PETE
Leo, I was trying to impress a
skirt.
You know me, I'm non-
political.
Republican, Democrat,
Communist, there's not a dime's
worth of difference between 'em
anyway.
LEO
You should watch what you say.
PETE
I don't know who fingered me, but
I'm not a communist!
LEO
Kid, that cuts no ice with them.
PETE
(frustrated)
What?
That I'm accused of being a
communist when I don't happen to be
one?
LEO
They know you were at that meeting,
Peter.
They've been told, and they
know.
PETE
Leo, you're my agent.
Tell "them"
to take a flyin' piss.
I didn't do
anything wrong.
I fought in the
war, for crissakes!
LEO
Fought?
Come on, Pete, you ran the
PX at Fort Dix.
PETE
I was decorated.
LEO
I know.
A Purple Heart.
PETE
Exactly.
LEO
You broke your arm.
You were
coming out of a bar.
You were
drunk.
PETE
At least I was on our side!
Look,
they want me to testify?
I'll
testify.
I'll tell 'em anything
they want to hear!
Jesus, Leo,
this is my career!
LEO
You can't testify.
PETE
Why not?
Leo takes a gold cigarette care from his breast pocket,
offers a cigarette to Pete and takes one for himself.
LEO
Don't take this personally, kid.
If it were up to me, I'd have you
testify wearing your uniform and
your medal, wrapped in a flag with
one hand on your heart and the
other hand on a bible.
What can I
say?
I like you.
Leo lights Pete's cigarette and his own.
Puts a fatherly
hand on his shoulder.
LEO
They don't want you to testify
because you're not a big enough
fish for them.
They just don't
want you writing pictures for now.
That's all.
PETE
(under his breath)
Yeah, well, that's enough.
LEO
Peter, I believe in you.
More to
the point, I read your new
script... um...
PETE
"Ashes To Ashes?"
LEO
That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes."
I think it's great.
But it'll
never get made with this communist
business hanging over your head.
You can't work until you're cleared
-- and believe me, starting right
now, I'm gonna do everything I can
to make that happen.
PETE
So, it is a blacklist.
LEO
(defensive)
Don't say that.
There is no such
thing as a blacklist.
(calm)
Now, are you gonna play ball?
PETE
(sullenly)
Yes.
(then, pissed)
Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!
Leo blows out a thin stream of smoke.
LEO
(hand on Pete's shoulder)
Kid, this is the United States
Government we're talkin' about.
Fair ain't the point.
CUT TO:
FROLIC ROOM - NIGHT
Pete takes a few steps, stumbles, stops, takes a deep breath,
then totters briskly towards his car.
He hauls the door open
and sits inside heavily.
PETE'S CAR - NIGHT
Sitting slumped against the steering wheel, Pete looks as
though he could fall asleep right there, which would probably
be a good idea.
PETE
(mumbling)
Drive.
Drive.
Bad idea.
Too
drunk to drive.
He looks at his watch.
PETE
One-thirty.
Huh!
Early.
Can't go
home yet.
He turns the key and hits the starter.
The engine hums to
life.
Pete sits up, opens his eyes wide, shakes off the haze
and puts the car in gear.
The Plymouth lurches forward a few yards, screeches to a halt
and stalls.
PETE
Oops.
He re-starts the car, puts it in gear, and pulls away and
down the deserted boulevard.
DISSOLVE TO:
SANTA MONICA BEACH, AMUSEMENT PIER - NIGHT
The full moon is low over the ocean.
Pete's car is parked at
the edge of the sand, the water fifty yards away.
The ferris
wheel and the roller coaster of the amusement pier are dark
and eerie silhouettes, lit only by moonlight.
Pete is asleep
in the driver's seat, head tilted back, his hat covering his
face, snoring.
The waves CRASH against the pilings and startle Pete awake.
PETE
Huh?
Whatsa...
Instantly, he grabs his head.
PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
I had no idea how I got to Santa
Monica, but it certainly was a good
idea.
I don't think I could've
faced the headache I had alone in
my apartment.
At least I had the
ocean air.
Pete takes a deep breath... and starts coughing.
He gets out
his cigarettes and lights up.
He takes a puff and glances at
his watch.
PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
Three forty-five.
I had only been
there for a couple of hours at
most.
Truth be told, I was still
fairly drunk.
He starts the car and heads for the highway.
PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
I'd head north until the sun came
up or I ran out of gas, whichever
came first.
DISSOLVE TO:
PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT
Pete drives along the moonlit two-lane blacktop.
Waves crash
to the shore below the roadway.
PETE'S CAR (DRIVING) - NIGHT
Pete is finally relaxed.
He takes off his hat and jams it
down in the back seat.
He takes a deep breath -- with the
wind in his hair, a smile grows on his face and he seems at
peace.
He glances down at the speedometer -- then at the
fuel gauge.
INSERT - FUEL GAUGE
Pinning on "empty."
PETE
Shit.
PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
Guess which came first.
He scans the road ahead -- nothing.
Glances to his right.
PETE'S POV
The lights of a small town can be seen off in the distance.
Pete veers the car off the highway and makes the turn that
will take him toward the lights.
He passes a hand-painted
sign that gives him hope: "GAS - 1 MI."
CUT TO:
RORY'S GAS STATION - NIGHT
Pete's car rolls up and stops.
There's a light on the sign
and another in the station's window, but the place is
deserted.
PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
I should've known better than to
think that a service station in the
sticks would be open at this hour,
but it wasn't like I had a lot of
choices.
Pete looks ahead toward the town.
Its few lights twinkle in
the distance.
PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
What the hell.
At least there'd be
a diner opening in a couple of
hours.
I'd get some pie and
coffee, and then I could worry
about the gas.
Pete pulls out onto the road.
ROAD - NIGHT
Pete's car trundles along, blowing past a hand-painted
roadside sign which reads:
SLOW!
NARROW BRIDGE - SINGLE LANE - NO GUARDRAIL
USE CAUTION!
PETE'S CAR (DRIVING) - NIGHT
Pete's headlights catch a glimpse of another sign, reading
"LAWSON WASH," just in front of a small wooden auto bridge.
Barely reducing his speed, Pete heads onto the bridge...
HIS POV - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
... his headlights pick up the glowing eyes of a hapless
possum...
Pete swerves to avoid the animal, and a wheel drops off the
edge...
BRIDGE - NIGHT
... and the Plymouth careens over the side of the bridge and
into the rapidly-moving water below!
UNDERWATER - NIGHT
The water is flowing very quickly, and the current is
intense.
Pete pulls himself out of the driver's seat
(thankfully, it's a convertible) and swims over the
windshield.
But... his left sleeve is caught on the door handle.
Nearly
out of breath and panicking, Pete shucks off the jacket and
heads for the surface.
THE WASH - NIGHT
Pete breaks the surface and gasps for air.
His fight isn't
over yet, as the current is pulling him rapidly downstream.
He swims with all his might toward the far bank.
FAR BANK OF THE WASH - NIGHT
Drained, Pete pulls himself out of the water and staggers to
his feet.
PETE
(gasping)
Oh my god!
I don't believe... oh
my god...
He stumbles along backwards a couple of steps... and his heel
hits a rock...
Pete falls backward -- and his head strikes a glancing blow
on another rock.
He rolls down the bank, unconscious, and
lands face down in the mud.
CUT TO BLACK.
IN BLACK, we slowly become aware of a panting, breathing
sound -- the sound of a dog...
FADE IN:
ON A DOG'S FACE
A yellow labrador, full frame.
It takes a couple more
sniffs, then starts licking furiously.
OLD MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Maggie, whatcha got there?
Huh,
girl?
Whatcha find?
FAR BANK OF THE WASH - DAWN
Pete is still laying face down on the bank, being fervently
licked in the face by the dog.
ON THE OLD MAN
A no-nonsense sort in his late-60s, he wears overalls and an
old railroad cap.
He comes down to Pete, and using his
walking stick, pokes him in the side.
OLD MAN
Mister, who are ya?
my dog likes
you, but that don't mean much, she
likes skunks, too.
Sweet n'stupid,
that's why I keep her.
Pete blinks up at the Old Man, his mouth gaping open.
OLD MAN
Mister, you okay?
You look wet.
You in an accident or somethin'?
PETE
I... I don't know.
He sits up, and the Old Man gets a look at his head, which is
caked with mud and blood on one side.
OLD MAN
You best come with me.
Can ya
walk?
PETE
I... yes, I think so.
He stands up shakily.
The Old Man gives Pete a hand.
OLD MAN
Come on, we'll have the Doc look
you over.
PETE
My head hurts.
OLD MAN
I shouldn't be surprises.
You
smell like that was quite a night
before you had there.
(to the dog)
Maggie!
Let's go now!
And they head toward the road to town.
BOOMING UP, we SEE
them pass a roadside sign:
ON THE SIGN:
WELCOME TO
LAWSON, CALIFORNIA
EST. 1869
ELEV. 275
POP. 1755
THE TOWN
THAT GAVE ITS ALL
OLD MAN (STANTON)
Name's Stanton Lawson.
My
ancestors founded this town.
PETE
Ancestors?
STANTON
Actually, my grandpap.
But
"ancestors" sounds better, don't
it?
(hands Pete a
handkerchief)
Here.
Pete takes the handkerchief and wipes the mud and some of the
blood off his face.
PETE
I suppose.
Thanks.
STANTON
You look familiar, fella.
What's
your name?
Pete stops, thinks for a moment.
PETE
I'm... I... I honestly don't know.
CUT TO:
COMMERCE STREET - LAWSON, CALIFORNIA - DAY
Pete and Stanton walk along Commerce Street, the main drag
through the center of the small town.
Lawson is a bit run
down, creeping inexorably toward decrepit.
Despite that,
there's a timeless quality to the small buildings, a familiar
All-American feel.
Several of the PEOPLE walking along the street take notice of
Pete and nod to Stanton, who nods back.
PETE
They all know you?
STANTON
'Course they all know me.
And I
know all them.
Town's got my name,
don't it?
They pass the window of the drug store, COLE'S PHARMACY.
Pete looks down and sees
TWO FADED GOLD STARS
in the window with two faded photos, all decked in tattered
black crepe.
Two boys, no more than 18 and 19, who went off
to war and didn't come back.
Stanton notes Pete stopping to look at the stars and photos.
STANTON
Ernie Cole here just got himself
elected mayor.
Lost both his boys
in the war.
Kenny at Anzio and
Willie at Normandy.
PETE
(thinking)
The war...
STANTON
(points across the street)
Mabel over there at the diner lost
her husband Max.
Okinawa, I
believe.
ANGLE - MABEL'S DINER
A typical small-town greasy spoon -- with one faded star
prominent in the window.
CLOSER
On MABEL LANIER, a sweet-faced woman in her 30s.
She stares
vacantly into space, her reverie broken by a customer needing
a coffee refill.
STANTON
All told, this little town gave
sixty-two of its finest to the war.
Seventeen of 'em at Normandy alone.
More'n its share, I should say.
Got us a letter from President
Truman.
City council commissioned
a war memorial.
Been sittin' in
the basement of city hall these six
years.
Town never had the heart to
put it up.
Place just hasn't been
the same since the war.
STANTON AND PETE
Pete looks longingly toward the diner.
Stanton takes note.
STANTON
You hungry, son?
PETE
Yes.
Very.
STANTON
Got any money?
Pete rummages in his pants pockets, and comes up with three
quarters.
STANTON
Six bits.
More'n enough to buy
some breakfast.
C'mon.
And they head across the street.
CUT TO:
A PLATE WITH TWO PIECES OF APPLE PIE
A fork comes into frame and tears into one of the slices.
WIDER
COMMERCE STREET - DAY
A stoop-shouldered little man in his late 60s, HARRY TRUMBO
shambles along the street, headed for Mabel's Diner.
There's
a sadness about Harry, the world-weary melancholy of a man
who has little to smile about because he has little to care
about.
After a couple of steps, he's met up by DOC BEN
LARDNER, a vigorous man in his 50s.
He comes up behind Harry
and claps him on the back.
LARDNER
'Mornin' Harry.
Fine day, isn't
it?
HARRY
Morning, Doc.
Yes, yes it looks
just fine.
LARDNER
Plenty to do today?
HARRY
(vaguely)
Oh, yes, plenty.
Plenty.
They're at the door of the diner.
Doc opens it for Harry.
LARDNER
After you.
DOC LARDNER'S OFFICE - DAY
The Sheriff's sedan pulls up to the office and SHERIFF CECIL
ELDRIDGE, 45, gets out.
As he gets a few steps from the
door, Harry Trumbo jumps out from around the side of the
building and stops him.
HARRY
(excited)
Cecil!
Cecil, there's a young man
in there...
ELDRIDGE
(startled)
Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna
give me a heart attack right in
front of the doctor's office?
HARRY
Listen to me!
The young man in
there...
Eldridge keeps moving to the door.
ELDRIDGE
(interrupting)
Stan Lawson found him unconscious
by the wash this morning, and I'm
here to investigate, and if we find
anything interesting, it'll be in
the paper, so why don't you just...
Harry jumps in front of Eldridge and grabs him by the
shoulders.
HARRY
Cecil, listen to me!
The sheriff stops.
HARRY
(breathless)
It's Luke.
CUT TO:
DOC LARDNER'S OFFICE - DAY
Harry, Pete, Eldridge and Lardner come outside.
ELDRIDGE
C'mon, I'll give you two a lift
back to the Bijou.
PETE
The Bijou?
LARDNER
That's where you live.
PETE
We live in a theater?
HARRY
Only one in town.
(he opens the car door for
Pete)
Get in, son.
ELDRIDGE
(sotto, to Lardner)
Ben, when's Delly due back?
LARDNER
(sotto)
Tomorrow afternoon...
(seized by a thought)
... oh my god...
ELDRIDGE
(sotto)
Exactly.
Break it to her gently.
Eldridge and Harry get in the car.
Lardner comes over to
Pete's back seat window.
LARDNER
Get plenty of rest, Luke.
You took
a pretty big wallop there.
He turns to move away, then turns back.
LARDNER
Good to have you back.
Eldridge starts the car and they drive away.
(NOTE: Henceforth, "PETE" will be known as "LUKE."
It'll be
easier to keep track of things, since everyone's now calling
him Luke, anyway.
Trust me.)
CUT TO:
IN FRONT OF THE BIJOU - DAY
Eldridge's car rounds the corner, pulls up and stops.
ELDRIDGE
Here we are.
HARRY
Well, son, you're home!
Luke peers across the street... his mouth gapes open...
HIS POV - THE BIJOU.
The Bijou is a decaying, Dada-esque, grab-bag of building
styles.
It's as though the architect took random parts of a
Chinese temple, a Mosque, a Pagoda, a Sphinx, a symphony hall
and a slaughterhouse, put them in a bag, gave it a good
shake, tossed the contents out onto a blueprint and promptly
built the result.
As a matter of fact, if you didn't know that the place was
"The Bijou," you'd probably wonder what the cryptic message
" HE B J U"
was trying to convey from atop the crumbling parapet.
And now, the reason for the deteriorated state of the " HE B
J U" sign becomes apparent.
Train tracks run right behind
the building on an elevated trestle.
As we watch, a TRAIN
ROARS BY.
Everything shakes.
It's not an earthquake, it's a
trainquake.
The "J" teeters at a jaunty angle, threatening
to dislodge and tumble down to join its fallen brothers.
LUKE
stares at the monstrosity.
His face is ashen.
His heart has
sunk to somewhere below his knees.
The Bijou.
Harry jumps out of the car excitedly.
HARRY
Thanks for the lift, Cecil.
ELDRIDGE
Don't mention it.
Welcome home,
Luke.
LUKE
(faint smile)
Thanks.
Luke opens the back door and slowly steps out.
Harry grabs
his arm and pulls a ring of keys from his pocket.
HARRY
Wait'll you see the inside!
LUKE
(deadpan)
Can't wait.
CUT TO:
COMMERCE STREET - EVENING
Luke and Harry, walking along, make a turn onto Commerce
Street, heading for Mabel's.
It's still light out, and a
soft breeze skitters some leaves along the sidewalk.
HARRY
I take breakfast and supper at
Mabel's every day except Sunday.
Have for years, since Lily died.
If it weren't for Mabel, I'd
probably starve to death.
ERNIE COLE, a slight, balding man in his 50s, is locking the
door of his pharmacy across the street, when he spots Harry
and Luke.
ERNIE
Harry!
Hold on a second!
Ernie runs across the street and, slightly winded, stands
before Luke, staring.
Luke shoots a glance at Harry, who
taps Ernie on the shoulder.
HARRY
It's really him, Ernie.
ERNIE
(agape)
Well, I'll be...
He sticks his hand out and Luke takes it.
Ernie pumps it
enthusiastically.
ERNIE
By god, Luke, if it isn't good to
see you again.
LUKE
(uncertain)
Uh, thanks.
Good to see you again,
too, uh...
HARRY
Ernie.
LUKE
... Ernie.
ERNIE
(still at a lose)
Well, I'll be...
HARRY
We were just gonna get some supper.
Would you like to join us?
ERNIE
Would I ever!
The three walk toward the diner, but before they get two
steps, they hear:
WOMAN'S VOICE
Is that Luke Trumbo?
They turn to see a stout woman, KATIE RUTHERFORD, 40s,
rushing toward them.
She rushes right into a very surprised
Luke's arms and hugs him tightly.
KATIE
Oh, Luke, it's so good to have you
back!
HARRY
Katie, would you like to join us
for dinner?
The more, the merrier.
CUT TO:
MABEL'S DINER - NIGHT
The diner is packed.
In addition to Ernie and Katie, MEN,
WOMEN and CHILDREN occupy every seat and table, and many more
are standing, even hanging out the door.
At the focus of the crowd are Luke and Harry, seated at the
counter.
Harry is leisurely eating a chicken dinner, while
Luke is working on a steak.
A young man seated at the
opposite side of the counter is speaking.
He's CARL LEFFERT,
30s.
CARL
(eagerly)
Hey, Luke, remember the time you
and me, we was playing with
firecrackers and the one you was
lighting blew up too soon and
singed all the hair offa my head?
A few people shake their heads, smile and laugh.
LUKE
Uh, no.
What happened?
CARL
(deflated)
Well... um, all the hair got singed
offa my head.
It was pretty funny.
A couple of TITTERS are heard.
LUKE
Oh.
CARL
Even my eyebrows.
But they grew
back.
Luke leans toward Harry, who never looks up from his chicken.
HARRY
Carl.
Friend of yours from high
school.
Everybody calls him
"Cueball."
LUKE
(sincerely)
Oh, hi Cue... Carl.
Sorry.
CARL
(brightening)
Oh, heck, that's all right.
It's
just good to have you back.
Isn't
that right, Bob?
Hey, Luke, you
remember my brother Bob?
You two
joined up the same day.
Luke smiles and nods at the young man sitting next to Carl.
BOB LEFFERT
is a good-looking fellow, a few years older than Carl.
His
face is pale and downcast, and he wears a cap pulled down on
his forehead.
He looks up at Luke with hollow eyes.
Brings
his right hand up, pushes the brim of his cap up.
Except
there's no hand there -- it's a hook.
LUKE
(quietly)
Hey, Bob.
Good to meet you.
Bob doesn't react.
He glances away, and for a moment, his
eyes meet Mabel's.
She smiles warmly.
He turns away.
Ernie Cole pipes up.
ERNIE
Luke, I know there's a question
that's on everybody's mind.
LUKE
What's that?
ERNIE
Well, now that you're back, what're
your plans?
All eyes on Luke.
He freezes, having just taken a forkful of
food in his mouth.
Harry jumps in.
HARRY
Gonna re-open the Bijou, that's
what.
A MURMUR goes through the crowd.
Stanton Lawson, standing
behind Luke, taps him on the shoulder.
STANTON
That true?
LUKE
(on the spot)
Well... we're gonna try.
ERNIE
That's a lot of work, son.
Place's
been closed, what, three, four
years now.
Gonna be tough.
HARRY
If it's tough, that means it's
worth doing.
Someone shouts "That's the spirit!," another shouts "Hear,
hear!," and a chorus of VOICES join in agreement.
ERNIE
Hey, where's Spencer Wyatt?
SPENCER'S VOICE
Uh, back here, Mr. Mayor.
ERNIE
Well, come on out here so's we can
see you.
SPENCER WYATT steps around from the back of the crowd near
the door.
He's a tall, dark-haired, gangly, bespectacled
kid, no more than 19 or 20.
Painfully shy, he clutches a
clarinet case to his chest.
He timidly smiles and waves at
Luke, who smiles and nods back.
SPENCER
Hey, Luke.
LUKE
Hi, Spencer.
ERNIE
Spence, that band of yours -- you
think they're ready to play?
(to Luke)
Spencer and his pals went ahead and
got together a good ol' big band.
SPENCER
We've been practicing... uh, sure,
I guess.
ERNIE
Well, how about tomorrow night,
eight p.m., in city hall square?
What I'm proposin' is a "Welcome
Home Luke" celebration.
Vociferous general AGREEMENT from the crowd -- which is
quickly quieted by a MURMUR, which starts at the front door.
The crowd parts and grow silent, revealing a woman standing
in the doorway.
ADELE
She locks eyes with Luke.
Her hand goes to her mouth and her
eyes well up.
Slowly, she moves around the counter, the
crowd moving aside for her.
She stands in front of Luke, who has stood up to meet her.
Her eyes moist, she looks up at him.
ADELE
Do you... remember me?
LUKE
I've seen you before.
Your
picture...
Mabel, clutching a napkin, leans over to Katie.
MABEL
(sotto)
Look!
LUKE
... but I don't think I remember
you.
Adele leans up and kisses him softly.
He looks at her.
LUKE
But I'll sure try.
As Mabel and Katie dab at their eyes, we
CUT TO:
COMMERCE STREET - NIGHT
Adele and Luke stroll down the street side by side.
She
looks at him for a long moment.
LUKE
What.
ADELE
No, I... I just wondering where
you've been all this time.
LUKE
Me too.
ADELE
You look... different.
LUKE
I do?
ADELE
Yeah, a little.
I think you grew
an inch or so.
And you've lost
weight.
LUKE
I did?
Huh!
Tentatively, she takes his hand and holds it.
From behind
them, we HEAR A SHUFFLING SOUND.
Adele turns...
ADELE'S POV
Keeping a discreet distance, EVERYONE from the diner is
following them.
Adele turns and addresses the crowd.
ADELE
(to the group)
You can all go home, now.
He's not
going anywhere.
LUKE
Go on home, folks.
And thanks for
the welcome.
Harry comes over.
LUKE
I'll be home in a little while,
Harry.
Don't wait up.
HARRY
You two have a lot of catching up
to do, I guess.
LUKE
You bet.
HARRY
Goodnight, son.
(tips his hat)
'Night, Delly.
And the rest of the crowd disperses, variously wishing the
pair goodnight.
Luke and Adele watch them disperse.
LUKE
There.
We're alone.
They turn and start walking.
ADELE
Then why do I feel like we're still
being shadowed?
LUKE
Well... where can we go?
Adele brightens.
ADELE
I know a place.
Come on!
She grabs his hand and they run toward the town square.
LAWSON CITY HALL - NIGHT
Adele and Luke stand by the front steps.
LUKE
City hall?
ADELE
You must not remember anything.
Come on.
She grabs his hand and they run to the side of the building.
SIDE OF CITY HALL - NIGHT
Adele and Luke stand by a basement window, inches off the
ground.
She looks around.
Certain the coast is clear, she
pounds on the window in three "special" places, and it pops
up and open.
She looks at Luke.
ADELE
You first.
LUKE
Why me?
ADELE
Be a gentleman.
You have to help
me down.
AS LUKE CLIMBS IN, WE
CUT TO:
A LARGE, MUSLIN-COVERED OBJECT.
Slowly, the muslin is drawn off, revealing A STATUE OF A
KNEELING SOLIDER, praying before a soldier's grave.
We
slowly PAN DOWN from the top of the statue...
THE BIJOU - NIGHT
Luke comes down the street and heads for the front door.
He
has a definite spring in his step as he pulls out his keys
and enters.
STREET - NIGHT
Adele and Luke walk along, arm-in-arm.
ADELE
This is strange.
Do you feel it?
LUKE
What?
ADELE
We've done this before, so many
times.
The last time was so long
ago, but it feels like yesterday.
LUKE
Oh.
Pause.
ADELE
You know, everyone's so excited
about the Bijou re-opening...
LUKE
(interrupting)
It's gonna cost over nine hundred
dollars to open the place, Delly.
ADELE
(shocked)
Nine hundred...
LUKE
Yeah, and needless to say, none of
us has that kind of money lying
around.
ADELE
What about a loan?
You could go to
the bank...?
LUKE
A loan to a man who ran his
business into the ground and his
son who can't account for the last
nine-and-a-half years of his life?
Not likely.
ADELE
Well, there's got to be a way...
LUKE
(suddenly)
Have you got a cigarette?
Adele stops.
ADELE
When did you start smoking?
LUKE
I don't smoke?
ADELE
You tried to once.
It was pretty
pitiful.
LUKE
Oh.
Adele glances curiously at Luke as we
CUT TO:
A CLARINET
launching into the opening bars of "Don't Be That Way," an
old Benny Goodman tune.
CITY HALL SQUARE - DAY
Spencer Wyatt's big ban is comprised of a dozen or so
MUSICIANS about Spencer's age -- except for the drummer,
AVERY WYATT, 40s, Spencer's dad.
Though no Gene Krupa, he
pounds the skins pretty well, all the while smiling proudly
as his son plays clarinet and leads the band.
Despite the last minute decorations, the Square looks nice,
hung with multicolored paper lanterns and colored lights.
ON LUKE AND ADELE
dancing to the music, along with several other COUPLES.
LUKE
(nodding toward the band)
They're not bad.
ADELE
No, they're not.
I'd say your
investment was paying dividends.
LUKE
My what?
ADELE
Back in '37, you heard Benny
Goodman play for the first time, so
you went out and got a used
clarinet.
You wanted nothing more
than to be able to play like him.
You tried hard, but it wasn't long
before it was clear that Benny
Goodman would never be looking over
his shoulder.
So you gave the
clarinet to Spencer.
LUKE
Huh.
That was nice of me.
ADELE
You had a hidden agenda, though.
See, when he was five or six,
little Spence used to follow you
around like a puppy.
Bothered the
hell out of you.
But as soon as
you gave him the clarinet...
LUKE
... he started practicing, and he
left me alone from then on.
ADELE
Exactly.
And he got good.
LUKE
No kidding.
They dance a bit.
ADELE
Now, did you remember that, or...
LUKE
Nope.
Just filling in the blanks.
ADELE
Oh.
Okay.
And as they dance away, we
CUT TO:
THE SAME - LATER
ON THE REFRESHMENTS TABLE
Luke is pouring two glasses of punch, while Adele is being
shyly admired (and having her ear bent) by two twin brothers,
ALEX and CHARLIE MCKENNA, mid-20s.
ALEX
You're the luckiest guy in town,
Luke.
Delly's 'bout the prettiest
thing ever come outta Lawson.
LUKE
(to Alex)
Thanks, Charlie.
ALEX
I'm Alex.
He's Charlie.
CHARLIE
I'm Charlie.
ALEX
Yessir, 'bout the prettiest thing
we ever seen, ain't that right,
Charlie?
CHARLIE
You bet.
ADELE
(ala Mae West)
Thanks boys, ya flatter me no end.
The brothers laugh goofily.
CHARLIE
Hey, she's doin' that movie star,
what's her name...?
ALEX
(ignoring his brother)
Hey, Delly, what was that test you
was outta town takin'?
ADELE
It's called the State Bar Exam.
CHARLIE
Shoot!
ALEX
Imagine that, Charlie!
A lady
bartender!
CUT TO:
THE SAME - LATER
Adele and Luke are slow dancing to "Thanks for the Memory."
LUKE
How do you tell those two apart,
anyway?
ADELE
Alex and Charlie?
Simple.
Alex is
the smarter one.
LUKE
That's... pretty frightening.
They laugh and dance a bit more.
ADELE
Your dancing's very good.
LUKE
Thanks.
ADELE
It never used to be.
You were two
left feet on the dance floor.
Like
pulling teeth to get you to do a
little box step.
LUKE
Guess I must've learned.
Luke dances Adele away, a slightly nonplussed expression on
her face.
The band finishes the song, and everyone
enthusiastically APPLAUDS.
Spencer bows shyly, blushing
slightly.
He nods to the band, and they bow before he
motions for the crowd's attention.
SPENCER
(nervously)
Thanks, folks.
Gee, can you tell
we never played in front of people
before?
The crowd yells "No!," "You guys sound great!," etc.
SPENCER
Well, this is our first time, and
it's really all because of Luke.
I
mean, it's because of Luke coming
back that we're here tonight -- but
I'm talking about this.
He holds up the clarinet and scans the crowd until he sees
Luke.
SPENCER
(to Luke)
When you didn't come back, I
learned how to play this so I could
remember you.
And now that you're
back, well, I'll never forget you.
(to the crowd)
Luke gave me this clarinet, but he
gave this night to all of us.
The crowd APPLAUDS warmly.
SPENCER
Okay folks, here's Mayor Cole!
The crowd APPLAUDS as Ernie Cole mounts the band riser.
He
turns and addresses Avery Wyatt, on drums.
ERNIE
Pretty proud of your boy, Avery?
Avery smiles broadly and beats the KICK DRUM five or six
times to register his reaction.
ON THE KICK DRUM -- "WYATT'S HARDWARE, LAWSON, CALIF."
ERNIE
Looks like you might have to find
someone else to mix paint at the
store, 'cause I think Spencer's got
a big career ahead of him.
APPLAUSE again, and Ernie waits for it to settle.
As soon as
he starts speaking, the crowd becomes totally silent.
ERNIE
You know folks, here in Lawson, we
gave a lot for our country.
A lot.
And we never complained and we
never faltered.
And we never
forgot.
Ernie's voice cracks slightly with emotion.
He clears his
throat and continues.
ERNIE
We never forgot.
And so when one
of our own came back to us, I gotta
tell you folks, it was like a
miracle.
Luke, seein' you walking
down the street, it was... well, it
was kinda like seein' one of my
boys alive again.
I think I speak
for everyone here when I say that
not a day goes by when we don't
keep our boys' memories alive.
But
Luke, having you back among us...
well, it helps us keep their
spirits alive, too.
God bless you,
son.
The crowd APPLAUDS.
Adele takes Luke's hand and smiles.
Ernie wipes his eyes and changes the subject.
ERNIE
All right, enough a'that.
This is
a celebration, so let's have us a
good time -- but not too good a
time, 'cause I see just about every
member of the city council here
tonight, and we have an eight a.m.
council meeting tomorrow morning,
and I expect y'all to be there!
All right, take it away, Spencer!
And Spencer kicks the band into the next tune as we
DISSOLVE TO:
THE SAME - LATER
Luke and Adele come over to Harry and Mrs. Terwilliger,
standing at the periphery.
Old Tim stands a few feet back.
LUKE
Why don't you two get out there and
dance?
HARRY
Oh, no, I...
Mrs. Terwilliger blushes.
MRS. TERWILLIGER
I haven't danced with another man
since Mr. Terwilliger passed.
LUKE
When was that?
MRS. TERWILLIGER
Nineteen-oh-nine.
Harry touches Luke's arm.
HARRY
Son, we're gonna go.
You two kids
have a lovely time.
Goodnights are exchanged, and the trio leaves.
Alex McKenna
comes up to Adele and taps her on the shoulder.
ALEX
Delly, can I have a dance?
ADELE
Sure.
Alex leads her to the dance floor as Adele shoots Luke a
little "help me!" look.
Luke smiles back and watches the
dancing crowd.
After a moment, a man in a white suit and bow
tie, ROSCOE FITTS, 40s, comes over to Luke and extends his
hand.
FITTS
Luke, you probably don't remember
me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer
here in town.
LUKE
(shakes his hand)
Good to meet you.
Again.
FITTS
Like Ernie said, we're all glad to
have you back.
LUKE
Thanks.
FITTS
And I hear you and Harry are
planning on re-opening the Bijou.
LUKE
We're gonna try.
Place needs a lot
of work.
FITTS
I can only imagine.
You know, I
spoke with your Dad last year about
maybe taking the Bijou off his
hands.
I don't think he gave it
very much thought.
LUKE
Well, he loves the place.
It's his
home.
FITTS
Luke, I'm hopping you can help him
see the reality of the situation.
I'll come to the point.
I want to
buy the property, and I'm prepared
to offer six-thousand dollars for
it.
And that's just for the
property, mind you.
If you want,
I'll leave it to you and your
father to dismantle and liquidate
the building for whatever salvage
value it has, and you keep those
proceeds.
I just want the land.
LUKE
(taken aback)
That's... well, that's very
generous, but if you've already got
a store...?
FITTS
The days of the storefront grocery
are numbered.
I plan on putting up
a free-standing supermarket.
LUKE
(it's an alien word)
A super market.
Huh.
FITTS
You think it over.
No reason to
risk financial ruin for the sake of
a crumbling old building.
Fitts takes Luke's hand and shakes it.
FITTS
Good to have you back, Luke.
As Luke watches Fitts walk off, we
CUT TO:
THE SAME - LATER
ON SPENCER
SPENCER
Last dance, folks!
The crowd MOANS slightly, and Spencer kicks the band into
"Moonlight Serenade," slow and easy.
ON ADELE AND LUKE
As they hold each other close and dance.
Adele rests her
head on Luke's shoulder, her eyes closed.
Luke strokes her
hair and sways her gently to the music.
Luke looks toward the edge of the dance floor.
LUKE'S POV
Bob Leffert is standing there, staring at the band.
Mabel
comes up behind him and taps him on the shoulder.
She's
asking him if he would like to dance.
Bob looks down at the
ground, self-consciously shoves his hook-hand in his pocket
and moves away, leaving Mabel standing there.
As Luke watches and the MUSIC CONTINUES OVER, WE
DISSOLVE TO:
MONTAGE:
Luke and Adele dancing...
... walking slowly arm-in-arm down Adele's street, up her
walk to her door...
... kissing passionately on her doorstep...
... Adele going inside and Luke walking away, each unable to
take their eyes off the other...
... Luke walking the quiet streets of Lawson, smiling
beatifically...
MATCH DISSOLVE TO:
THE BIJOU - NIGHT
Luke turns the corner and heads for the theater door.
He
pulls out his keys and enters.
THE BIJOU SIGN - DAY
Luke is on the roof of the theater, pliers in hand and tool
box nearby.
He's just straightened out the "J" and he steps
back... carefully... to admire his handiwork.
For the first
time in a long time, the sign actually reads, "THE BIJOU."
But not for long.
Luke tenses... the building starts
shaking... and the train passes by behind the theater.
Luke
lunges out of the way as three letters shake lose and fall.
Once again, the sign reads, " HE B J U."
Luke winces.
CITY HALL SQUARE - DAY
Ernie Cole and Avery Wyatt stand solemnly at the front of a
small group gazing at the base of the war memorial, as it
takes shape in a prominent place in the square...
THE BIJOU SIGN - DAY
Luke and all the letters up again.
He steps back, checks his
watch, and like clockwork, the rumbling begins and a train
goes by.
This time, however, only the "J" tips over at a
jaunty angle.
Luke smiles.
THE BIJOU SIGN - NIGHT
Luke's standing near the sign.
He yells to Adele, down below
on the ground.
She, in turn, yells to Harry, standing near a
switch panel behind the candy counter.
He throws the
switch...
... and the sign lights up beautifully!
Then, they all feel
the rumble -- the train rolls past, and, although they rattle
and shake, no letters fall.
A CHEER goes up from Adele,
Harry, and the small crowd of ONLOOKERS below.
Delighted,
Luke takes a formal bow.
The boogie-woogie ends as we
DISSOLVE TO:
CITY HALL SQUARE - DAY
ON THE MEMORIAL
Complete and polished, standing proudly in the center of the
square.
WIDER
It's a clear, balmy day, and the whole town is turned out.
Mayor Ernie Cole is at the podium.
He finishes his remarks,
then picks up the two faded gold stars representing the lost
lives of his sons.
He holds them up, high above his head.
ON THE CROWD
One-by-one, the gold stars of the town's boys are solemnly
held aloft by their loved ones.
Luke and Harry stand at the side of the square, looking out
at the sea of four or five dozen gold stars being held aloft.
Luke catches a glimpse of a man in an army uniform...
LUKE'S POV
It's Bob Leffert, standing with Mabel, looking very sharp in
his dress greens.
He brings his hook-hand up and salutes
smartly.
Mabel takes his good hand, squeezes it as she
blinks back tears.
Luke smiles at this scene as Harry wipes his eyes and puts
his arm around Luke's shoulder, pulls him close and kisses
him on the forehead.
DISSOLVE TO:
THE SAME - LATER
The Lawson High School Marching Band is set up on the steps
of City Hall, playing the "Star Spangled Banner."
They are
being conducted by their director, MR. PHILLIPS.
Luke and
Harry, hands over their hearts, watch and sing along.
Then,
Luke takes a closer look at the DRUM MAJOR...
ON THE DRUM MAJOR,
a tall young man wearing an ornate brocaded red and white
uniform with "LHS" emblazoned across the chest.
ON LUKE
He has an idea.
The anthem ends, and Luke excuses himself
and moves forward, buttonholing Mr. Phillips as he comes down
the steps...
DISSOLVE TO:
BIJOU - DAY
Luke and Adele are on ladders, hanging letters on the
marquee, which reads:
GRAND RE-OPENING TONIGHT!
GENE KELLY
AN AMERICAN IN PARIS
Harry comes outside and gets their attention.
Grandly, he
gestures toward the door, and out strides
OLD TIM,
wearing his new uniform -- it's the Lawson High School drum
major's uniform, modified here and there.
"B-I-J-O-U" is
proudly emblazoned across his chest in gold brocaded letters.
Luke and Adele applaud.
Old Time looks up at them -- AND
SMILES!
LAWSON CEMETERY - DAY
It's a beautiful, bright, sunny day.
Luke and Adele stand at
the front of the large group of mourners.
REVEREND COLEMAN,
50s, conducts the service.
COLEMAN
We commit to the earth the mortal
remains of Harry Bernard Trumbo,
safe in the knowledge that his
immortal soul is at peace and at
last reunited with his beloved
Lillian in the bosom of the Lord.
Let us pray.
Everyone bows their heads.
COLEMAN
"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall
not want, he maketh me to lie down
in green pastures..."
Luke looks up at the sky, then steps forward and lays a
single rose on Harry's casket.
Then, as everyone
surreptitiously watches, he turns and walks away from the
gravesite, toward the cemetery entrance.
Adele watches Luke depart...
ANOTHER ANGLE
... and she's not alone.
Agents Saunders and Brett are
watching everything from their car, which is parked nearby.
As Luke walks away, Saunders snaps his photo with a long-lens
camera...
DISSOLVE TO:
THE BASE OF THE WAR MEMORIAL,
and Luke's name inscribed there.
CITY HALL SQUARE - DUSK
Luke stands in front of the memorial, head bowed.
After a
moment, he sits, leaning against the memorial.
ON LUKE
Lost in thought, he buries his face in his hands.
ADELE'S VOICE (O.S.)
Mind if I join you?
Luke looks up, squinting.
Adele stands above him, backlit by
the golden light of the sundown.
LUKE
Sure.
She sits next to him.
Tentatively, she touches his shoulder.
He leans into her, and she enfolds her arm in his.
Pause.
LUKE
Your father said... that I would
start to remember things.
Suddenly, Adele feels as though she's walking on eggshells.
ADELE
(slowly)
What... do you remember?
LUKE
Well... everything.
It started
coming back a couple of days ago.
I remember everything now.
ADELE
I see...
LUKE
Delly.
I'm... I'm not... Harry
wasn't my father.
And I'm not...
I'm not Luke.
She closes her eyes.
All her suspicions are suddenly
confirmed.
ADELE
(adrift)
Oh...
Her tears start, and she moves to hug Luke -- but instead,
she starts hitting him, flailing, beating on his chest.
He
hugs her tightly, and she completely lets go.
ADELE
(crying)
Oh, god, I knew!
I knew!
I knew
from the start!
I wanted you to be
Luke!
I wanted you to be alive!
You're so much like him, you have
no idea.
No wonder everyone else
accepted you!
You don't know what
you -- what Luke meant to this
town, suddenly being alive!
You
don't know what this town lost!
You just don't know...
She pulls away, stands, and looks him in the eye.
Luke
rises.
ADELE
(sobbing uncontrollably)
I knew you weren't Luke!
And I
tried not to fall in love with you!
And... I don't even know your name!
Oh, god...
Luke moves toward her.
She backs away.
LUKE
I fell in love with you, too,
Delly.
Only now I don't know how I
feel, about you or about anything.
I only think I know how Luke would
feel.
She's still sobbing.
He moves to her, takes her in his arms.
LUKE
Delly, shhhhhh...
ADELE
(pulling away)
No... I can't... I have to... I
can't...
She runs off, crying...
DISSOLVE TO:
SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
Pete comes out into the bright midday sun.
It takes a moment
for his eyes to adjust, and when they do, he becomes aware of
perhaps TWENTY PEOPLE lining the sidewalk in front of the
station.
PETE'S POV
We recognize several of the people.
Carl Leffert.
Bob
Leffert and Mabel Lanier.
Daley Thornhill.
Katie
Rutherford.
Stanton Lawson.
Now, there's nothing in the
least bit threatening about the gathering -- and that's
what's so disturbing about it.
They're not an angry mob,
they're just standing there, running the gamut of emotions.
Shock.
Disillusionment.
Betrayal.
It's an awkward moment.
Pete doesn't quite know how to
react.
He wants to go over and talk to them, but he wouldn't
know what to say.
He wishes one of them would talk to him,
just say something, anything.
But no one does.
Then, Bob Leffert turns away from Pete.
He shoves his hook
hand into his pocket and sullenly moves away, followed by
Mabel, then his brother, then the others...
... leaving Pete alone.
DISSOLVE TO:
THE BIJOU SIGN - NIGHT
Pete sits leaning up against the base of the dark sign.
A
gentle breeze tousles his hair as he gazes up at the stars.
After a moment, he HEARS footsteps coming up the ladder to
the roof.
PETE
Who's that?
ADELE'S VOICE
It's me.
Adele climbs onto the roof, comes over and sits down next to
Pete.
ADELE
Hi.
PETE
Hi.
Pause.
ADELE
I'm sure a lot of people down in
L.A. are worried sick about you.
PETE
Yeah?
I'm sure a lot more people
down in L.A. want a piece of me.
He turns to her.
PETE
This Luke was a pretty good guy,
wasn't he?
ADELE
(wistful smile)
Oh, yes.
Yes, he was.
PETE
Well... let me tell you, I'm not
Luke.
I know who I am now, and you
don't.
And... I don't like me very
much.
ADELE
(changing the subject)
You know, it's going to take me a
while to get used to calling you
Pete.
(she takes it for a spin)
Pete.
Pete.
It's a nice name.
PETE
Thanks, I like it.
I think.
Pause.
PETE
Delly, I want to do the right
thing.
Pete can't believe he just said that -- but he did.
ADELE
I believe you.
PETE
The truth is, I'm a lot of things,
but communist isn't one of them.
ADELE
But if you only went to one
meeting, why does anyone care?
Besides, why should it even matter
if you were a communist?
PETE
Come on, Delly, look at the country
today.
We're fighting communists
in Korea, we're paranoid about the
Russians, we've got this thing with
the Rosenbergs and the atomic
bomb...
(bitterly)
You think they want "suspected
communists" entertaining the
American public with party
propaganda like, gosh I don't know,
"Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
ADELE
Forget about all that.
You want to
do the right thing?
Then defend
your name.
If someone says
something about you that's untrue,
you have to stand up and say so.
I
know the law, and the law's on
your side.
Beat.
PETE
What about you, Delly?
ADELE
I am, too.
Pete smiles and puts his arms around her.
PETE
You'll stand by me?
ADELE
Whatever happens.
They kiss, and we
DISSOLVE TO:
RORY'S GAS STATION - MORNING
There's a thick bank of coastal fog just down the road,
obscuring any view of the ocean a mile away.
It's deadly
quiet as gas station owner RORY, late 60s, pulls up and parks
his Model A truck.
He gets out, and an big old German
Shepherd, LOTTIE, jumps out of the truck bed.
Rory moves to the door, and is about to put his key in the
lock, when Lottie starts whining, looking toward the fog bank
and sniffing the air expectantly.
RORY
Whatsit, girl?
He stops -- he hears something, too -- a LOW RUMBLE.
Lottie
starts BARKING.
The RUMBLE is getting LOUDER.
Rory's
getting worried.
He looks at
THE FOG BANK.
It's starting to GLOW from within.
Lottie's barking gets
LOUDER and angrier.
Suddenly, a large black car punches out
of the fog bank and tears down the road.
It's followed by
another, and another -- and perhaps a dozen more cars and
trucks, all heading hell-bent-for-leather toward the town.
Rory moves toward Lottie, trying to quiet her as the cars fly
past the station.
RORY
Shhhhh.
I know, Lottie.
This
time, I thought it was the Martians
for sure.
CUT TO:
COMMERCE STREET - DAY
The place is bedlam, overflowing with REPORTERS, NEWSREEL
CAMERA CREWS, PHOTOGRAPHERS, you name it.
A RADIO CREW is broadcasting in front of Mabel's Diner.
The
REPORTER is on-the-air, hugging his microphone, speaking
above the din.
Mabel stands next to him, his hand on her
shoulder.
Bob Leffert stands nearby, grim.
REPORTER
I'm here with Mabel Lanier, the
owner of the diner here on Commerce
Street where Appleton often took
meals.
Mrs. Lanier, tell me, what
are your thoughts about having such
a celebrated suspected communist in
your midst all this time?
MABEL
Well, its kinds hard to believe,
'cause Luke -- I mean Peter -- is
such a... I mean, since he's been
back, I've never seen the town so
happy and all.
It's like he gave
us some... I don't know... some
hope, I guess.
REPORTER
What she's referring to folks, is
yet another bizarre twist in this
story.
Not only is Appleton alive,
but he's been suffering from
amnesia and living here in Lawson,
where, due to a startling
resemblance, everyone in town for
the last three months has taken him
for one of Lawson's dead war
heroes, Albert Trumbo...
MABEL
(a catch in her voice)
Luke.
We always called him Luke.
Mabel glances at Bob, who lowers his head.
CUT TO:
LAWSON PASSENGER DEPOT - DAY
Pete and Adele walk slowly down the platform toward the
waiting train.
ADELE
You've got everything?
PETE
Yeah.
Except a chance in hell of
coming out of this intact.
ADELE
You'll be fine.
No matter what Leo
Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred
and seventy-five years of American
law on your side.
Don't forget
that.
PETE
I wish you were coming with me.
ADELE
And who's gonna run the projector
until you get back?
Mrs.
Terwilliger?
PETE
Maybe we could train Cat to run the
projector.
You know, a system of
scratching posts, and gears, and
levers...
They both smile as the train's HORN blows.
CONDUCTOR
Board!
Pete picks up his suitcase and they walk toward the passenger
compartment.
ADELE
Did you bring along something to
read?
PETE
Damn...
Adele pulls a pocket-sized leather-bound book out of her
purse and hands it to Pete.
ADELE
I didn't think so.
Here.
This is
mine, you can borrow it.
INSERT - THE BOOK
Well-worn and scuffed, nevertheless the title is clear:
CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES
ANNOTATED EDITION
Pete looks at the book, then at Adele.
ADELE
Not exactly light reading, I know.
Believe it or not, I've read this
since high school, and it got me
all the way through law school.
Besides, there's something in there
that'll help you.
You won't have
to get very far, it's near the
beginning.
PETE
(clearly touched)
Delly... thanks, thank you.
I'll
take good care of this.
ADELE
Just remember two things.
First,
the law is a living thing.
It made
us free and it keeps us free.
Sometimes it gets twisted around by
people for their own purposes.
Sometimes it makes mistakes,
sometimes big mistakes.
But in the
end, the law prevails for the just.
Sometimes, it takes a while.
PETE
Okay.
What's the second thing?
She thinks for a moment.
She needs the right words.
ADELE
I'll be here... if you come back.
The train pulls out.
Adele and Pete exchange waves as we
DISSOLVE TO:
BILTMORE HOTEL - DAY
As Pete exits the hotel, a DOZEN REPORTERS AND PHOTOGRAPHERS
have him completely surrounded.
FLASHBULBS pop.
He's taken
aback, flustered.
FIRST REPORTER
(seeing Pete)
There he is!
SECOND REPORTER
Pete!
Are you going back to
writing pictures?
PETE
I don't know...
THIRD REPORTER
You a commie, Pete?
PETE
No, of course not...
SECOND REPORTER
What about the girl, Pete?
You
gonna marry her?
Is she coming to
Hollywood, or are you...
PETE
Look, fellas, I don't have anything
to say...
Pete is trapped in the crowd, when he feels a hand on his
shoulder.
LEO
spins him around, and pushes him through the crowd toward the
curb.
LEO
Come on, kid.
At the curb is a black Cadillac limousine.
Leo hauls open
the back door and pushes Pete in, before climbing in himself.
The limo drives away, as the reporters give chase.
PETE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
The limo pulls up, and Leo opens the door.
Pete vacantly
grabs his suitcase and gets out.
Leo shuts the door and
calls after him, waving Pete's hat.
LEO
Peter!
Your hat!
Pete comes back and takes his hat.
Leo grabs his hand.
LEO
I was lookin' out for you all the
time, kid.
You did good.
I'm real
proud of you.
(to the driver)
Okay, let's go.
(to Pete)
Get some rest, kid!
As the limo pulls away, we
CUT TO:
TRAIN (MOVING) - DAY
Our view of the moving train is from outside, as it speeds up
the spectacular coastline north of Santa Barbara.
Looking
into one of the train's windows, we SEE Pete sitting, staring
out at the passing scenery.
PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
Dear Adele, on my way back to
Lawson STOP.
That is, if they'll
have me STOP.
Train arrives four
p.m. STOP.
Hope you can be there
STOP.
Pete.
DISSOLVE TO:
LAWSON PASSENGER DEPOT - LATE AFTERNOON
The train is just pulling in to Lawson.
As it SHUDDERS to a
halt, the door of the passenger compartment opens and Pete
steps out -- looks -- and his jaw drops open...
HIS POV
The ENTIRE TOWN has turned out.
They're all there, smiling
broadly.
A large, hand-lettered banner reads:
WELCOME HOME PETE!
LAWSON'S FAVORITE SON
A CHEER goes up from the crowd, breaking the silence.
Pete
descends from the train and moves into the throng.
The first
two people he encounters are Bob Leffert and Mabel Lanier.
bob sticks out his good hand and Pete takes it, both smiling
as they shake hands vigorously.
BOB
Luke... um, I mean, Pete, if it
weren't for you, I wouldn't have
had the nerve to ask this fine
woman to marry me.
Mabel's mouth drops open.
PETE
Bob, congratulations!
When'd you
ask her?
MABEL
Holy moley!
Just now!
(to Bob)
Yes, Bob!
Yes!
As Mabel kisses Bob for all she's worth, Pete continues into
the crowd, where he's kissed, embraced, patted on the back.
ADELE
is at the back of the crowd, working her way to the front.
She rushes into Pete's arms, and they kiss.
Another CHEER
goes up.
PETE
I see you got the telegram.
ADELE
Pete, I'm so sorry about what they
did to you.
I didn't think you'd
come back, I thought you'd want to
write again...
PETE
Dell, I can't write unless I'm
happy, and I can't be happy unless
I'm here -- and with you.
(grabs her shoulders)
This is me, Delly.
Pete Appleton.
And I love you!
ADELE
(tears in her eyes)
And (hic!) I love you, Pete!
They kiss again.
Pete pulls away and looks at his watch.
PETE
(smiling)
C'mon, Dell, we gotta go.
Showtime
in fifteen minutes.
The train whistle BLOWS as it slowly pulls out of the
station.
PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
"Happily ever after" is a relative
term, folks.
My world is much
smaller now, and my dreams are very
different than they were.
But I
have something now that I never had
before: I have the magic.
And
it's for sale at the Bijou, every
day of the year.
All you need is
the price of a ticket.
We BOOM UP to see Pete and Adele moving into and being
enveloped by the crowd.
Spencer Wyatt's band is assembled in front of the depot
office, and they kick into some up-tempo boogie-woogie as we
move up and away -- still in the same shot -- moving over the
town, settling down again to grab a shot of the Bijou's
marquee.
The neon chaser lights POP ON, illuminating the
sign, which reads:
THE END
Then, the letters on the marquee START SHAKING.
We BOOM UP
TO THE TOP OF THE THEATER, and the "BIJOU" sign...
... as the train RUMBLES BY behind the theater...
... and the "J" teeters loose and swings by a thread...
... and we IRIS DOWN ON IT AND...
CUT TO BLACK.
