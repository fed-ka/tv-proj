      CLOSE - A NEWSPAPER

        a front-page photo of CARL ROBINSON in ball togs, a headline
      screaming "STAR PITCHER HUNTED IN GRUESOME SLAYING."

      MacLeod is grimly reading the paper.  He is just entering
      the dojo, and the headline has stopped him.  As he-reads, he
      feels EYES on him.  He looks up to see --

      TALBOT, a young black kid, maybe ten, standing there silently,
      watching him.  Waiting.  Something odd about this.

                                      MACLEOD
                    How'd you get in here?

      Talbot snorts.  This doesn't even merit an answer.

                                      TALBOT
                          (flat)
                    You MacLeod?

      Perfect.  A ten year-old with attitude, interrogating him.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (beat)
                    Who are you supposed to be?

                                      TALBOT
                    I'm askin' the questions here.

      Talbot hands him a folded piece of paper.

                                      TALBOT (CONT'D)
                    You can read.

      MacLeod isn't in the mood for this.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (an edge)
                    I'm working on it.  You go real slow,
                    I can follow the pictures okay.

      As MacLeod takes the note, Talbot bursts into movement, tennis-
      shoes around MacLeod and out the door.

      MacLeod unfolds the note, holds it up, and we see some
      handwritten words:

      INSERT NOTE: "Laker Warehouse.  Carl"


                                                                (CONTINUED)96503       "Manhunt"      7.       Final Shooting Script 7/18/96

      It's from Carl.  MacLeod crumples the note, swings around to
      head out of the dojo -- WHAM -- he's plowed into by a woman
      coming in.  MacLeod grabs her to keep her from falling over.

      GLENDA ALVAREZ recovers her balance.  She's late-20s, in
      good shape, brassy -- she launches a Brooklynese preemptive
      strike.

                                      GLENDA
                    Hey, hey, hey, watch where you're
                    goin'!  And where you put those hands?

      She pushes his hands away.  MacLeod grits his teeth.  Not
      even noon, and the day is already biting him in the ass.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'll try.
                          (beat)
                    Look, I'm just on my way out.

                                      GLENDA
                          (dismissive wave)
                    Apology accepted.  I get lots worse
                    on the subway, believe me.  I could
                    show you marks.

      She's already nosing around the dojo, poking and prodding.

                                      GLENDA (CONT'D)
                    Is it open for business?
                          (cutting him off)
                    Couldn't tell by the clients.

      She's on auto-pilot, prodding a practice bag gingerly, as if
      the germs would jump on her.

                                      GLENDA (CONT'D)
                    I mean, who's gonna join a dump in
                    this condition?  What it needs? 
                    Fixing up, big-time.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Look.  I don't have the time...

                                      GLENDA
                          (over him)
                    You think I'm kidding?  You know it,
                    I know it ... only the dork owns the
                    joint?  Not a clue.

                                      MACLEOD
                    But you could straighten him out.

                                      GLENDA
                    Bet your cute buns.

      Without a pause, she turns, gives the bag a rapid ONE-TWO
      karate punch, then a high, swinging kick.

                                      GLENDA (CONT'D)
                    So.  Where do I find this Neanderthal?

                                      MACLEOD
                    About two feet in front of you.
                          (beat)
                    And we're closed.

      She freezes in mid-swing, as MacLeod turns on his heel and
      leaves.  Glenda's mouth falls open -- slaps shut.

                                      GLENDA
                    Ouch.


      A dark, unwelcoming space.  Junk and old machinery.  If you
      came in with a wallet, you'd leave without it.  If you ever
      left.  Stale smell of uric acid.

      MACLEOD wrinkles his nose, moves warily through the space
      until he gets the BUZZ.

      A BEAT -- Carl steps into view.  He's disheveled, grim-faced,
      haunted looking.  They look at each other a BEAT.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Nice neighborhood.

                                    CARL
                    Yeah.  Penthouse was gettin' on my
                    nerves.  Figured I needed some new
                      am-bi-ence.
                          (bitter)
                    Call it Chez Carl's.  What do you
                    think?

      MacLeod takes in the tight face.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I think you've looked better.

                                    CARL
                    Sure as hell felt better.
                          (beat)
                    How bad is it out there, MacLeod?

      MacLeod takes the HEADLINE out, shakes it open.  Carl takes
      it and reads, confirming what he already knows.

                                    CARL (CONT'D)
                    Damn.

                                      MACLEOD
                    TV, papers, the talk shows -- Carl
                    Robinson, wanted for murder.  You
                    sure got the coverage down, Carl. 
                    Did everything but take out an ad.

                                    CARL
                    You think I wanted this?!  The punk
                    didn't give me a choice!

                                      MACLEOD
                          (beat)
                    It doesn't make much difference now.

      Carl throws the wadded paper down, kicks a box aside in
        frustration.

                                    CARL
                    Know where I was last week?
                          (beat)
                    Dinner.  Sittin' at the same table
                    with the Mayor and the Governor.  We
                    talked about the game, my fast ball...
                    then they asked me if I ever thought
                    about going into politics.
                          (agonized)
                    You know what I'm saying?  Politics,
                      MacLeod... and they wanted me there
                    with them!  Me, Carl Robinson!

      MacLeod sees how he's torn, but there's no way to soften the
      blow.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Not anymore.  The only ones who want
                    you now are the cops.
                          (beat)
                    Put it behind you, Carl.

                                    CARL
                    Hey, no big thing.  I only waited
                    what -- two, three lifetimes for
                    this?  They were opening the door. 
                    I was there.
                          (deflating)
                    Now it's over.  Gone.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's time to disappear, Carl.

                                    CARL
                    With what?  I use my name, credit
                    card, they'll throw my ass in jail. 
                    I can't even get to my money.  My
                    face is all over the place.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (beat)
                    Come on.  Use my place.  We'll put
                    something together.  It beats this
                    hotel.

      He turns to go.  Carl hesitates, pride making him stiff.

                                    CARL
                    MacLeod?
                          (off his look)
                    Never wanted to drag you into this.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm already in it.


      MacLeod and Carl, heading to MacLeod's.  Carl staring straight
      ahead, seething in frustration.

                                      MACLEOD
                    No one said it was.

                                    CARL
                    I was this close, MacLeod.  This
                    close.  Malcolm, Martin, I watched
                    'em all go down.  I swore I'd make a
                      difference.
                          (beat)
                    Then some hotshot kid throws it all
                    in the crapper.  My whole life!

                                      MACLEOD
                    You still have your life, Carl.

                                    CARL
                          (bitter)
                    Right.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Listen to me.
                          (beat)
                    You start over.  Another country,
                    new people... After a few years, you

                                    CARL
                    From the bottom.

                    It's more than most people get.

      There's no answer to that.  They're turning into MacLeod's
      street.  As they do, they see ahead --

      MACLEOD S POV - TWO POLICE CARS

      and two or three POLICE, waiting outside the dojo.

      RESUME - SCENE

      as Carl reacts, quickly slides down out of sight.

                    Damn!  How the hell did they know?!

                                      MACLEOD
                    Somebody did some homework, found we
                    were friends.  Your tax dollars at
                    work.
                          (grim)
                    Hang on.

      He swings the T-BIRD into a wide U-Turn.  As he does, they
      feel the BUZZ.

      CARL sneaks a look over at the Cops, and sees --

      MATTHEW

      standing with them.

      RESUME CARL

      as he reacts to the sight of Matthew.

                    C'mon, man, get me outta here!  Go,
                    go, GO!

      MacLeod puts the pedal down and roars off.

      ANGLE - MATTHEW

      As he feels the BUZZ, turns to face the departing T-Bird. 
      He makes no move to follow -- just smiles slightly and waggles
      his fingers at the departing car: 'Be seeing you.' And OFF
      his look --


      The CAN in Carl's hand, as he grips it hard, crumples it
      into twisted scrap, then slams it hard on a table.

                                    CARL
                    Now he wants to kill me.

      The bar is deserted.  In the B.G. a faint sound of acoustic
      guitar:

      JOE DAWSON is at the bar, sitting unobtrusively on a stool,
      playing some early blues as Carl talks to MacLeod at a table.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Why now, when he could have taken
                    you then?

                                    CARL
                          (evasive)
                    What the hell's it matter?

      Carl realizes he's being loud, glances warily at Dawson. 
      MacLeod sees his look.  He waves Dawson over.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's okay.  Joe's a friend.  You can
                    use his back room until we figure
                    this out.

      Dawson puts the guitar aside, moves towards them.  Carl eyes
      him doubtfully.

                                    CARL
                    You trust him?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I have to.  He knows about us, Carl. 
                      Everything.

      And OFF Carl's look, Dawson extends a hand to him.

                                    JOE
                    Joe Dawson.  Let's just say I got a
                    soft spot for Immortals.

      Carl looks at the offered hand a BEAT -- then grudgingly
      takes it.

                    Guess any guy who plays Robert Johnson
                    like that might be okay.

                                    JOE
                          (a smile)
                    Thanks.  Same goes for any man who
                    can strike out Griffey twice in a
                    game.

      Carl manages a tight smile, easing the mood.

                      accommodations.

      And OFF this, MacLeod turns to leave.  Carl turns and calls
      after him.

                                    CARL
                    Where are you going?

                                      MACLEOD
                    To talk to McCormick.

                    You're wasting your breath.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What's to lose?

      MacLeod takes a beat.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Let's see what he can teach me.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                          ACT TWO

      FADE IN:


      MacLeod enters to find Matthew there, sitting in his chair,
      feet propped on the desk -- he's nonchalantly playing with a
      slinky, watching as it rolls from hand to hand.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You're in my office.  In my chair.
                          (cold)
                    And I don't remember inviting you.

      Matthew ignores this, just keeps toying with the slinky,
      back and forth.

                                      MATTHEW
                    What I like about these?  If you had
                    enough stairs, they'd keep on going
                    forever.

      MacLeod lifts a foot -- sweeps Matthew's feet off the desk.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Unless they're stopped.

      Matthew is up like a shot, face to face with MacLeod.  Eyes
      hard, unblinking.

                                      MATTHEW
                    A lot like us, MacLeod.

      MacLeod pushes in closer, eyes boring back into Matthew.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Just like us.

      There's a tense beat.  Matthew is the first to break it.

                                      MATTHEW
                          (beat)
                    I checked you out, MacLeod.  Far as
                    I can see, we don't have a problem.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Just one.
                          (beat)
                    You're after Carl Robinson.

                    Just serving the state.  Killer gets
                    caught, the world is a safer place.

                    Serial killers, cannibals, bombers...
                      Psychopaths come in all shapes and
                    sizes, MacLeod.  It doesn't make any
                      difference to me.  Because I just
                    have one job.
                          (beat)
                    I bury them.

                                      MACLEOD
                    This wasn't murder, it was a fight
                    between Immortals.  Carl had no
                    choice!

                                      MATTHEW
                    Maybe not this time, but this time
                    I'll have him.

                                      MACLEOD
                    For what?  Carl is no murderer.

                                      MATTHEW
                    That your opinion, judge?  Or are
                    you the whole jury?
                          (pointed)
                    Let me tell you something about your
                    good friend, Carl Robinson.
                          (cold)
                    He's a murdering bastard.  He always
                    has been.

      And OFF THIS, we --

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:


        A ramshackle wood structure.  Inside it, past the hay bales,
      Matthew faces Carl Robinson.  It's several weeks later, and
      Carl looks different.  Putting on new clothes, the hunted
      look is gone, but the scars on his back are evident.

                                      MATTHEW
                    I wish we had more time, Carl, but
                    the South's gonna make a stand. 
                    War's coming and no one knows what's
                    going to happen.  It won't be good
                    for a black man out on his own.

                                    CARL
                    No need to explain, Matthew.

                          (pained smile)
                    I got me a whole back full of reasons
                    why I shouldn't stay here.
                            (shouldering a small
                            rucksack)
                    Still.  Something about the South
                    I'm gonna miss.  That seem strange
                    to you?

      Matthew shakes his head sadly.  We see a bond has grown
      between these two.

                                      MATTHEW
                    It's not gonna be easy out there.

                                    CARL
                    Yeah.  But I know what I am now,
                    Matthew.  Know how to survive.  You
                    taught me that.

                                      MATTHEW
                          (shrugs it off)
                    You'd have done the same.

                                    CARL
                    No.  See, you taught me something
                    else... that not every white man
                    uses a whip.

      He raises his arms, the wrists that are, for the first time
      in his life, unchained.

                                    CARL (CONT'D)
                    You didn't treat me like a slave,
                    Matthew.  Ain't gonna forget that.

                    You've been more than my teacher. 
                    You've been my friend.

      Matthew nods, moved.  He clasps hands with Carl.

                                      MATTHEW
                    I believe your best chance is to
                    head north.  Chicago, maybe New York.

                                    CARL

                    attend to.

      He turns, starts to throw the sack over his shoulder and
      moves towards the door.  Matthew reacts, moves to stand in
      front of him.

                    The hell it isn't.  If you mean Seth
                    Hobart, you can forget it.  You stay
                    away from him.

                    that breaks the chains of bitterness

                    I hear you, Matthew.

      He turns and steps out the door.96503       "Manhunt"      24.       Final Shooting Script 7/18/96




      MacLeod is tight, pissed, as he confronts Carl with what

                    Dammit MacLeod, Hobart owned me,

      He turns and slams out the door.  And OFF MacLeod's look --


      CLOSE - A DESKTOP

      as a row of MUGSHOTS is dropped on it: various angles of
      CARL ROBINSON, looking unhappy, defiant.

                    brought in.  Rich, poor, young, old...
                    it's always the same story.
                          (beat)
                    You'd never know he was one of us.

      MacLeod takes the mugshots from Matthew's hand, tosses them
      back on the desk.

                                      MACLEOD
                    But he is one of us.  You know he
                    killed in self-defense.  Corman
                      challenged him.

                                      MATTHEW
                    I don't care about Corman.  Hobart
                    was my wife's father.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Is this about justice, or is this
                    about revenge?

                                      MATTHEW
                    I thought a man like you would
                      understand.
                          (beat)
                    There's no statute of limitations on
                    murder.

      MacLeod reacts.  He does understand.

      ANGLE - THE FRONT DESK

      as the DESK SERGEANT looks up from his file book, taking a
      BEAT to register what someone has just told him.  He doesn't
      know what the guy is talking about.

      He's looking at Trey Franks.  Trey is as disheveled as before. 
      No cigar, no sign he's drinking -- he just looks resolute,
      determined.

                                    TREY
                    I said, it's about Carl Robinson. 
                    About the murder.
                          (beat)
                    I know something.

      And OFF his look --

      RESUME MACLEOD AND MATTHEW

      MacLeod is trying a new tack.

                                      MACLEOD
                    C'mon, you can't send one of us to
                    prison for doing what he has to do.
                          (beat)
                    Things can happen during an
                      investigation.  Evidence gets
                      mishandled, somebody drops the wrong
                    glove...

      Matthew looks at MacLeod quizzically.

                                      MATTHEW
                    I believe you're asking me to throw
                    this case, MacLeod.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm asking you to find a way out of
                    this.  You know you can't send him
                    to prison!  How long before they
                    find out about him?  About all of
                    us?

      Matthew looks at him a BEAT.  He speaks -- the implication
      is clear.

                                      MATTHEW
                    Carl's not gonna make it to trial,
                    MacLeod.

      A COP approaches, nods tersely to Matthew.

      Matthew moves aside, cocks his head as the Cop whispers
      urgently.  As Matthew listens, his face tightens.  The Cop
      moves off, and Matthew turns back, looking grim.

                                      MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                    World's a strange place.
                          (beat)
                    The case is closed.  Someone just
                      confessed.
                          (off MacLeod's look)
                    But it wasn't Carl Robinson.

      As MacLeod reacts, a man is led past them in handcuffs: TREY
      FRANKS.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                      END OF ACT TWO96503       "Manhunt"      31.       Final Shooting Script 7/18/96



                                        ACT THREE

      FADE IN:


      MacLeod faces Carl, who has just been released.  He's pacing
      in disbelief, joy, relief that he's out.

                                    CARL
                    Who knows why held want to confess? 
                    All I know is, I'm out of there.

                                      MACLEOD
                    So you let Trey Franks take the rap
                    for you?  You think it's right?

      Carl stops.  He rubs the wrists that were handcuffed, chafed
      by the memory.

                                    CARL
                          (incredulous)
                    Right?  What the hell's right got to
                    do with any of this?
                          (beat)
                    Every time, I mean every time I fought
                    to do something, get somewhere...
                    BANG!
                          (smacks his palm)
                    Something came along and knocked me
                    on my ass.
                          (with feeling)
                    For once, just this one time,
                    something good drops out of the sky. 
                    A gift, MacLeod...
                          (beat)
                    And you want me to throw it away.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I want you to keep an innocent man
                    out of prison.

                                    CARL
                    How?  You want me to tell the truth? 
                    Keep it nice and simple?


                                                                (CONTINUED)96503       "Manhunt"      32.       Final Shooting Script 7/18/96

330CONTINUED:330

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's not simple, and it's not easy.
                          (locking eyes)
                    But you're going to do something
                    about it.

      Carl paces away, edgy, uncomfortable in the face of this.

                                    CARL
                    Look, when this happened, my life
                    ended.  Now I got it back... I'm
                    Carl Robinson again.

      He looks at MacLeod for understanding, almost pleading.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Carl the hero.  Must feel good.

                                    CARL
                    MacLeod, I can DO things, make
                    something outta of my life... can
                    make a difference.  I can help.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (quiet)
                    And Trey Franks can't.

                                    CARL
                    The man's a nobody.  He's nothing. 
                    Hell, he's less than nothing.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Like Carl the slave.

                                    CARL
                    Don't even think about going there,
                    MacLeod.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Because you suffered?
                          (beat)
                    How much you got in the bank, Carl?

                                    CARL
                    What's that got to do with anything?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Five, six million and that penthouse
                    of yours, another three, and that
                    Ferrari.

                                    CARL
                    You got some point you want to make
                    here, MacLeod?

330CONTINUED: (2)330

                                      MACLEOD
                    Give the tortured crap a rest.  Your
                    slave days are long gone.

      Carl turns away.

                                    CARL
                          (trying to regroup)
                    Hey, look at it this way.  This is
                    probably the best thing ever happened
                    to ol  Trey.
                          (beat)
                    He wants his big moment in the sun...
                    I'm gonna let him have it.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Not good enough.

                                    CARL
                          (hardening)
                    It'll have to do.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (pissed)
                    Yeah?
                          (beat)
                    Come with me to the station and tell
                    him that.

      Carl turns away, MacLeod takes his arm.  Carl freezes, tensing
        dangerously.

                                    CARL
                    One time.  Take your hand off me.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Not until we're done.

      Carl explodes.  He grabs MacLeod, lifts him bodily, and with
      a roar -- throws him against the dojo wall.

      MacLeod slams against the wall, hits the mat.

                                    CARL
                    We're done.

      He turns and starts away -- but MacLeod comes right back
      TACKLES Carl to the mat.

      IN TIGHT as they go at it.  Boxing, karate, dented walls --
      Carl is powerful, a tough street fighter, but MacLeod has
      been around longer, knows the arts.

      As they fight, Carl is thrown against the OFFICE WINDOW,
      which shatters.  VARIOUS ANGLES as --

      -- RACKS OF KENDO STICKS are knocked flying.

      -- BOXING BAGS taken down, their ropes snapped.  Finally:

      It's over.  Both are on their knees, bloodied and exhausted. 
      MacLeod forces himself, pushes to his feet.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You ready for more?
                          (beat)
                    Because I'm not finished.

      Carl sees he's not.  Breathing hard, he pushes to his feet,
      wipes blood from his mouth.  Finally --

                                    CARL
                    Okay, damn you.  Okay.  I'll see
                    him.

      He lurches out the door.  MacLeod slumps against a practice
      bag, catching his breath.

                                      GLENDA (O.S.)
                    Anybody home?

      You hear her before you see her.  Then Glenda motors in:
      tight tights, a jeans jacket, a mouth in motion.

                                      GLENDA (CONT'D)
                          (entering)
                    Came to see if you thought about
                      renovating.  We do some aerobics
                    here, a steamroom there, maybe a
                    little boutique...

      She stops.  Speechless.  Staring at the destruction.

                                      GLENDA (CONT'D)
                    Oh.  Oh my.

      MacLeod pushes off the practice bag.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Great idea.
                          (beat)
                      I couldn't wait to get started.

      And OFF her look, he lurches out after Carl.


      MacLeod and Carl wait near the desk as a Cop confers with a
      superior.

                                      MACLEOD
                    We should've gone through his lawyers.

                                    CARL
                    They'll let us see him.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You're pretty sure of that.

                                    CARL
                          (beat)
                    I'm a star.

      Detective Frayne approaches Carl.

                                      DETECTIVE FRAYNE
                    Robinson?

      There is a tense beat.  Then Frayne produces a virgin
      BASEBALL.

                                      DETECTIVE FRAYNE (CONT'D)
                    If it's not too much trouble?
                            (apologetic)
                    To Jerry.  He's my boy.

      Carl takes the ball, awkwardly pats his pocket for a pen
      MacLeod hands him one, gives him a look.  Carl takes the
      ball, signing it, as Frayne beams.


      MacLeod and Carl lean against the wall.  Trey sits, huddled,
      uncomfortable, a forlorn figure.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Let me get this straight, Trey.  You
                    killed him because he owed you money?

      Trey nods.  He's rehearsed the lines in his mind, has them
      straight.

                                    TREY
                    But he wouldn't pay, so I came after
                    it.

                    And you killed him with a big knife.

                                    TREY
                    More like a sword, kind of thing.
                          (edgy)
                    Look, I already told this to the
                    cops.

                                      MACLEOD
                    And then Carl came along, after you
                    killed the guy, and he got caught.

      Carl is looking at Trey.  Trey tries to avoid his gaze.

                                    TREY
                    That's right.  That's what happened.

                                      MACLEOD
                    So you hated this guy, Trey?

                                    TREY
                    I guess.  Pretty bad.

                                      MACLEOD
                    So why'd you lend him money, this
                    guy you hated so much?

      Trey looks trapped.  He s not that smart, not used to this
      pressure.  He sees MacLeod, Carl watching him.

                                    TREY
                    I did it!  Why won't you just believe
                    me?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Because it's not true.

                                    TREY
                          (beat)
                    I ain't gonna talk anymore.

      He s shutting up, closing in.

      MacLeod turns to Carl.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Carl...

      Carl nods.  He knows what he has to do.  Carl moves in very
      close to Trey, speaks quietly.

                                    CARL
                    Trey.  You know you didn't do this.

      Trey starts to speak, but Carl puts a hand on his arm.

                                    CARL (CONT'D)
                    No.  You know it, Trey, and I know
                    it.  And you gotta tell the Police.

      Trey sags.  He faces Carl's gaze, full on.

                                    TREY
                    Then they go after you.

                                    CARL
                    Maybe.
                          (beat)
                    You can't throw away your life.

                                    TREY
                    I don't got a life to throw away.
                          (beat)
                    Look, it's not like I don't know
                    what I am.  I KNOW what I am.  I'm a
                    joke.  White trash.  I can't play
                    ball, I can't...

                          (awkward)
                    Listen, Trey...

      Trey holds up a hand, cuts off Carl's protest with simple
      dignity that we haven't seen before.

                                    TREY
                    We both know it.
                          (beat)
                    Growing up, I hated guys like you. 
                    Rich, black, smarter than me ...
                          (beat)
                    Then I met you.  Seen the way you
                    play, way you treat people... what
                    you had inside you.
                          (beat,)
                    And I stopped hatin' you.  I wanted
                    you to win.  More than anything, I
                    wanted to help you win.

      Carl is moved.  Can barely stand to hear this.

                                    CARL
                    I know you did, Trey.

                                    TREY
                    You gotta hear me, Carl.  See, it
                    was the first good thing I ever
                    wanted.

                    If you had to do it, you musta had a
                    good reason.

                          (pleading)
                    Let me do this, Carl.  Please.  It's
                    all I got.

      And OFF Carl's reaction --


      MacLeod stands at a desk, waiting.  A tense atmosphere in
      the room, grim Cops talking quietly, glancing at MacLeod.

      Then, two DETECTIVES approach the desk.  One is Frayne, the
      other Matthew.  Frayne slaps something on the desk: CARL'S
      SWORD.

                                      DETECTIVE FRAYNE
                    The test was positive.  The
                      bloodstains matched the murder victim
                    and Robinson's prints are all over
                    it.

                                      MATTHEW
                          (to MacLeod)
                    If I had a crystal ball, you know
                    what I'd see.  I'd see you doing ten
                    to twenty years aiding... abetting...
                    accessory to murder.

                                      MACLEOD
                    All I did was find it.

                                      MATTHEW
                    I bet you found him, too.

                                      MACLEOD
                    No.

                                      MATTHEW
                    You tell us where and you'll save
                    yourself a world of trouble.

      MacLeod plays it well.  He hesitates and then, as if he's
      been broken:

                                      MACLEOD
                    I won't tell you.
                          (beat, off their looks)
                    But I'll show you.

      AND OFF THIS


      A tense Carl waits inside as MacLeod approaches.  He's holding
      a pump-action SHOTGUN.  MacLeod lowers his hands, and they
      face each other for a BEAT.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You ready?

      Carl raises a pump, racks it hard, takes a breath.

                                    CARL
                    As I'll ever be.


      A door slowly opens into the hallway.  A BEAT -- then MacLeod
      cautiously pokes his head out, waiting.

                                      MATTHEW (O.S.)
                    It's clear.

      Matthew, coming down the corridor.

                                      MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                    Better move it.  This "window" only
                    stays open for five minutes.

      MacLeod waves at the O.S. morgue:  Carl steps from the door,
      dressed in the civvies MacLeod brought along.  The three
      hurry down the corridor.

                                      MACLEOD
                    The police won't be looking for you
                    anymore.  And Trey's free.

                                    CARL
                    Great, but did you have to shoot me
                    so many times?  Felt like the damn
                    OK Corral.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Quit complaining.  You've still got
                    your head.

                                    CARL
                    It's freezin' in there.

                                      MACLEOD

                    Who picked these clothes out?  Your
                    mother?

      They're at a door.  MacLeod throws a look at Matthew.

                                      MACLEOD
                    We could leave him.

                    Not a chance.

      And as they move out a door --
