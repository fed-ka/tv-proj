  11EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - PORTLAND - DAY

          A desolate, industrial area of Portland and we may see a
          sign that says the word 'Portland' on one of the several
          old warehouses.  Not a soul in sight.  A squad car rolls
          into the frame.  JOHNNY, WALT and a Portland cop, OFFICER
          KOHLAN (20's) get out.  This young cop is still excited
          about just "being" a cop, a rather "gung ho" type. 

                                        OFFICER KOHLAN
                        You're sure she's in there?  You
                        get some kind of tip?

          Walt glances at Johnny who, we understand, must have had
          a vision before we faded in...

                                        JOHNNY
                          A "tip".  Yeah.  In a manner of
                          speaking.

          The cop nods, not surprised, as they move toward the
            warehouse...

                                        OFFICER KOHLAN
                          Runaways always find their way to
                        this part of the city.  The
                          abandoned warehouses are easy to
                        break into.    

          The trio enter the warehouse...


  22INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

          It's dark as night but for small streaks of sunlight that
            penetrate the old building; the contrast makes it hard to
          see but as they move in further, they see junk food
          wrappers and other signs of squatters who have been there. 
          Kohlan catches a whiff of something coming from another
          room... whispering --

                                        OFFICER KOHLAN
                        You smell that?  That ammonia
                        smell?




                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: ENEMY MIND - TEASER - 05/22/02 - YELLOW  2.

                                        WALT
                        Smells like cat piss.

                                        OFFICER KOHLAN
                        What are these kids up to?

          Kohlan nods, intrigued, yet still unsnaps the safety strap
          on her holster and puts her hand on her gun... looks to
          Walt...

                                        OFFICER KOHLAN
                        I know you're a little out of
                        your jurisdiction, Sheriff, but I
                        might need a little back-up here,
                          okay...?

          Walt acknowledges...


          MOVING LONG SHOT POV TO REVEAL A SMALL AREA IN THE
            WAREHOUSE -- DAY

          SCOTT (17, a grungy/punky street kid, but clearly very
          bright in a computer geek sort of way) is working at a
            makeshift lab table.  Two other boys sit on the floor
            watching.  Leaning against a wall watching are two girls:
          TAMMY MOE (16), a VERY punked-out girl with a mohawk and
          multiple piercings and tattoos, and JILL DERR (also 16, 
          not nearly as hardcore as Tammy, a more accessible
          appearance, 'newer' to the alternative culture).  Jill is
          the runaway from Cleaves Mills who is the object of Walt
          and Johnny's search.

                                        TAMMY
                        I'm hungry.  Anyone have any money?  

          The lab table contains only the most basic implements --
          just modified everyday items from a hardware store -- and
          empty boxes of cold medicine litter the table and floor:
          raw materials.


          RESUME KOHLAN, JOHNNY AND WALT

          as the cop looks to Walt and Johnny, silently directing
          them to split up to best cover escape routes although the
          open space design makes that very difficult... we stay
          with Johnny as he eyes --


          POV - JILL

          who looks tired, worn out... she reacts as Kohlan moves
          in from her position...

  2CONTINUED: (2)2

                                        OFFICER KOHLAN (O.S.)
                        How's it going there, Mr. Science?

          Scott reacts by pushing over the lab table to block
          Kohlan's approach and the boys bolt... Walt and Kohlan
          running after the boys into the darkness of the warehouse,
          trying to cut off their escape... but Johnny's quest for
          Jill takes him into the lab...


          ANGLE - SLOW MOTION

          Jill's briefly frozen like a deer in headlights as she
          sees him coming toward her; Johnny and Jill's eyes
          connect... but then we HARD CUT TO -- 


          RESUME NORMAL SPEED - NEW ANGLE - FLOOR

          where two different pools of spilt liquid running towards
          each other.  When they collide, they erupt in a FUMEY
          CHEMICAL REACTION.


          RESUME THE ROOM

          Jill and Tammy use the diversion to escape... but Johnny
          is caught in the misty cloud of fumes...  Coughing, Johnny
          tries to push himself away from the noxious vapors, but
          he is overcome and passes out.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

  44INT. DR. TRAN'S OFFICE - DAY

          Johnny sits, as DR. TRAN finishes up an examination...
          (Note: let's get some MEDTECH help here to suggest some
          alternative to our usual checking the eyes and looking at
          brain scans.  Maybe a nurse is drawing blood during this. 
          Or they're doing an EKG.  Might the lab results be on a
          computer screen?)

                                        DR. TRAN
                                (as he examines Johnny)
                        What were you doing all the way
                        down in Portland?

          He finishes the exam, moves to consider the lab results...*

                                        DR. TRAN
                        The emergency room sent us your
                        lab results.  The street name for
                        the drug is "Special K."  Ketamine,
                          a common pet tranquilizer.

          That just isn't an option for Johnny, he shakes his head,
          stands to leave...

  55EXT. DERR HOME - DAY - ESTABLISHING


  66INT. DERR HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

            A typical scene in a runaway's home.  A frantic, sleepless
          mother on the phone... talking to police... talking to
            neighbors... talking to anyone who might have some word
          on the whereabouts of their daughter...

          Here, MRS. DERR (Jill's mother, 40's, middle class) can
          be seen through the door to the kitchen on the phone... 
          on the other end, is a Portland police officer...

          And the content of this conversation is not terribly
            important to absorb... it's a tone, a mood, a setting
          because as it continues, we pan to find Johnny waiting...  
          musing over a variety of pictures on a piano...

                                        MRS. DERR
                                (to phone)
                        What I don't understand is...
                                (beat)
                        No, but what I don't understand
                        is...  
                                (beat)
                        But I thought you said this, this
                          warehouse district is where all
                        the kids...

          As Johnny picks up a photograph of Jill as a six year old
          Tinker Bell...  Mrs. Derr's dialogue getting lost in the
          background as Johnny's vision begins... we RAMP TO HIS
          FACE as we hear: 

                                        BOY #1'S VOICE
                        Jill, come back!  You'll get lost.


6A6AA JOHNNY VISION - EXT. WOODS - DAY

          where we MATCH CUT with a 6-year-old Jill turning around,
          responding to A CHILD'S HAND grabbing her shoulder.  Jill
          is wearing a Halloween costume -- Tinker Bell from "Peter
          Pan," complete with wings and a magic wand/pinwheel.  We
          hear sounds of a children's Halloween party near-by...

                                        BOY'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Boo!

          Jill SCREAMS, frightened, and runs away into the dense
          October woods.  WIDEN TO REVEAL BOY#1 (8) dressed in a
          scary Halloween costume.  FINDING JOHNNY standing off to
          the side, a passive observer.




                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: ENEMY MIND - ACT ONE - 05/17/02 - BLUE  7.

                        Jill, come back!  You'll get lost.

          The boy runs after her, disappears into the trees.  The
          vision ends... and we...

  88RESUME JOHNNY

          as he puts the picture down... his eye is caught by another
          photo, partially hidden among the various frames... and
          he sees an older Jill posing with some friends... one of
          them is the girl Johnny saw with her at the warehouse...

                                        MRS. DERR
                                (to phone)
                        You must have patrols... how can
                        a city like Portland allow kids
                        to... to... live in conditions
                        like that.  I really can't imagine
                        what would take priority over...
                                  (frustrated)
                        Yes, fine... I'll call you later,
                          Sergeant...

          She hangs up, stands there for a beat and gathers
          herself... wipes a tear from her cheek... she glances
          over at Johnny... lets out a helpless sigh that says  
          much about her life.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mrs. Derr... do you know the girl
                        with the blonde hair in this
                          photo...?

          Mrs. Derr moves over.  The second photo was shot a year
          or so ago and the girls are not as far into the rave
          culture yet but there's no doubt it's the same girl.

                                        MRS. DERR
                                (nods)
                        Tammy.  Tammy Moe.  That's not
                        how she looks now.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know.  I saw her in Portland
                        with Jill.

                                        MRS. DERR
                                (sighs)
                        I might have known.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Did they run away together?

                                        MRS. DERR
                                (getting angry)
                        Tammy doesn't have to run away. 
                        Tammy's mother... she lets her
                        stay out at all hours of the night,
                        I can't even begin to talk to the
                          woman...

          She stops herself as though getting angry is not allowed
          in this house; she sighs... sits...

                                        MRS. DERR
                        I have no right to criticize.  I
                        haven't been the world's best
                        mother, Mr. Smith.  Sometimes I
                        haven't been a mother at all.  In 
                        my own loneliness, I leaned on
                        her too much, asked too much of
                        her.  It wasn't fair.  There are
                        so many things I regret...

          She studies a Chinese cork sculpture of a tiny village on
          a hill on a coffee table... a pleasant memory crosses her
          face...

                                        MRS. DERR
                        Jill always loved our little
                        Chinese village... I'd come into
                        the room and find her staring at
                        it... hypnotized almost... god
                        knows what she saw in there...
                        have I already told you this?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (smile, gently, just
                                being there for her)
                        Yes, ma'am.

          The phone rings again...

                                        MRS. DERR
                        I'm sorry; it doesn't stop ringing. 
                        And every time it rings... I pray
                        to God it's her.

          She takes a beat and answers the phone...

                        Hi, Dad... no not yet... hang on
                          a second...

          She turns to Johnny...

                                        MRS. DERR
                        Tammy's address is 14290 Roblar
                        Street.
                                (bitterly)
                        I'll bet she slept in her own bed
                        last night.


  99INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON Tammy Moe as she sits in the Sheriff's office. 
          Then WIDEN to reveal Sheriff Walt Bannerman across his
          desk from Tammy and Johnny sitting off to the side...

          In the background, through the windows of Walt's office,
          we can see Tammy's MOTHER (Late 30's, worn as an old
          leather jacket) sitting in a chair waiting for her
            daughter.  She lights up a cigarette, bored.  Obviously
          this isn't the first time her daughter has been in trouble.

          Walt sets a tiny (1 inch by 1 inch) ziploc bag on his
          desk containing a trace of white powder in it, and also a
          small glass vial (like the kind insulin or other legal
          drugs come in).

                                        WALT
                        You just happen to have pet
                          tranquilizer lying around your
                          bedroom.

                                        TAMMY
                        I have a rambunctious cat.  What
                        are you gonna do?

                                        WALT
                        Having this in your possession is
                        serious... you'll have a juvenile
                        record now...

                                        TAMMY
                        Oh well, there goes my full ride
                        to Harvard.

          Walt glances to Johnny - this isn't going anywhere...

                        Tammy, she's your best friend.   
                        You know how dangerous it is on
                        the street...

                                        WALT
                        This is the time to help us, while
                        we can still put in a good word
                        for you with the judge...

                        Do you understand her mother wants
                        to send Jill to some lock-up rehab
                          facility?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe she needs to be in rehab...

                                        TAMMY
                        She's not doing that many drugs. 
                        Do you know what they do to people
                        in those places?  They shoot you
                        full of tranqs and strap you in
                        bed.  Talk about danger. 
                                (beat)
                        I need a cigarette.

                                        WALT
                        There's no smoking in the building.

                                        TAMMY
                                (looking over her
                                  shoulder at her Mom)
                        My mom's smoking.

          Walt frowns, hits the intercom...

                                        WALT
                        Deputy Shoenfeld, you have a woman
                          breaking the law three feet away
                        from you.

          Hangs up; in the background we see a deputy tell the woman
          to put out the cigarette.  During Walt's action, Tammy
          studies Johnny...

                                        TAMMY
                        I know who you are.  That psychic
                        guy.  I've seen you on TV.  You
                        used to teach, right?  So you
                        bust kids for a living now?

          She reacts as Johnny moves toward her with a purpose...
          she's not sure what he's about to do...

1010A JOHNNY FLASH - EXT. PORTLAND ALLEY - DAY - SUBJECTIVE
          POV

          DIGITAL CAMERA moving down streets and narrow alleys,
          turning, twisting, finally it finds a six-year-old Jill
          as Tinker Bell standing incongruously looking down by a
            dumpster, where two legs of body can be seen; she looks
          at our approach... as we reach a close-up... suddenly a
          large hand with a Cougar tattoo covers her mouth as someone
          grabs her from behind and on her shock... and ours...


  1111RESUME JOHNNY

          As Tammy finally breaks Johnny's grip... and she's shaken
          by the experience...

                                        TAMMY
                        Get this pervert away from me! 
                        Mom??!

          The strange vision lingers with Johnny.  Tammy moves to
          her mother in the outer office.  Walt follows to the door,
          looks to the deputy:

                                        WALT
                        Book her on possession.  Call the
                        designated court worker.

          Johnny's face registers his reaction to the strange vision
          he saw.  Walt looks at him with concern.

                                        WALT
                          Anything?

                        his right hand.  This time I could
                        see it's a Cougar.

                        I'll call that into the Portland
                        police.  Maybe someone with that
                        tatoo is in their computer system.

                        You okay?  You don't look so good.

          Johnny takes a beat, tries to shake off the vision...

                        It's... nothing.  I have to get
                        back to Portland...

          He moves to exit...

  1313INT. SMITH HOUSE - JOHNNY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Johnny pulls a few items out of his dresser and packs

          it's important to note that this tone is amiable and

                        'A little off'... do you understand
                        what it means in the context of
                        the rest of humanity for your
                        brain to be a little off... that
                        puts you in another galaxy far,
                        far away.  A little off how and
                        don't spare the details...?

                        When I saw the girl in the alley... 
                        she wasn't her real age - she was
                        maybe six or seven years old...
                        dressed in a Halloween pixie
                        costume... like a... a leftover
                        from another vision I had of her
                        this morning... 

                                        BRUCE
                        This is Johnny's dead zone.  This
                        is Johnny's dead zone on drugs. 
                          Scrambled eggs, baby.

                        It was just a little
                            disconcerting... but I understood
                        what it meant...

                                        BRUCE
                        It meant you have to go back to
                        the hospital, John.

  1717EXT. PORTLAND WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING


  1818INT. CLUB - NIGHT

          A makeshift club with a DJ's sound-system in the corner,
          a few flashing lights, water bottles and light sticks
          everywhere and a MULTITUDE OF TEENAGERS dancing to a
          thumping techno beat.

          A rave is in full swing...

          CAMERA FINDS Scott (the young man we saw making drugs in
          the teaser) standing... suddenly without warning, he's
          grabbed by a hand with the same Cougar tattoo from Johnny's
          vision and pushed into the wall... and we're face to face
          with MALCOLM (late 20's, Caucasian, short hair, clean cut --
          put him in a suit and he could be lean and hungry junior
          exec, except for the brutal, amoral look in his eyes, the
          look of a true criminal; the young Ray Liotta).

                                        MALCOLM
                        What did I tell you?  What did I
                        tell you?

                        I don't think you are, Scotty.  I
                        hear you're dealing again.

                                        SCOTT
                        I'm not.

                        go up in smoke last night?  I'm

                        people I work with want to know
                        why and you're the why, Scotty. 
                        So you're gonna have to make it
                        good... from what we hear, you've

                        have ten grand... I'm completely

                        really hope for your sake you're
                        lying.  Because I need that money.

          action between Malcolm and Scott concluding... her eyes
          narrow with fear...

          begins to pulse, to rustle rhythmically.  As the techno
          music from the rave slowly enters this vision, MORE trees
          start moving.  

          Like an ominous heartbeat, they pulse in rhythm to the
          music.

          the kids in the rave, stretched thin like the trees, and
          lit in a strange brownish light... This is NOT a literal
          morph, but they appear to emerge directly out of the trees --
          they have gray, bark-like bodies...

          Ultimately, this distorted/fused image goes beyond either
          of its two origins, i.e., the rave and the October woods. 
          Lit by this strange brownish light, the dancing kids could
          also be trapped souls writhing in the sulfurous fires of
          hell, the trees could be that infamous lake of fire's

          similar, although exaggerated, to the description of rehabs
          that Tammy delivered at the station house.)  Off the shock
          of the flash --

          as he surprises Bruce, grabbing the keys out of his hand
          and shoving him hard with his elbow into some garbage
          cans... Bruce falls over the cans as Johnny jumps into
          the PT Cruiser, starts the engine and drives away as Bruce
          stumbles to his feet, chases the car but too late...

                        Sarah, he's in bad shape.  We've
                        got to get Walt down here...

                                        SARAH
                        He went up to north county on an
                        arson call... he should be back
                        soon...

                                        BRUCE
                        Should I call the local police?

                                        SARAH

                                  thoughts straight)
                        I don't know.  I... I guess so. 
                        We'll come as soon as we can...  
                        I need to get a babysitter.  I'll

  3232INT. PT CRUISER - NIGHT (PROCESS)

          (From now on, in scenes where Johnny is alone, the camera
          work should become darker, more film noir.  His world
          should appear more ominous than it actually is -- the
          look should express the growing paranoia in Johnny's mind. 
          For example, this scene should be a MILD version of the
          driving scene in "Natural Born Killers.")

          Johnny drives, forcing himself to focus.  His cell phone
          RINGS.  He ignores it.  It keeps ringing.  Finally, he
          answers... 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hello?

  3333INT. BANNERMAN BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Sarah who is trying to get dressed and talk on the wireless
          phone at the same time is frenetic... 

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny, are you all right?

          Johnny can guess why she's calling but he plays dumb,
          puts on a cheerful voice...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, Sarah, what are you doing up
                        this late?

                                        SARAH
                        I'm up this late because I just
                        got a very scary call from Bruce.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, well Bruce has a problem...

                                        SARAH
                        He has a problem...?  He says you
                        knocked him to the ground, stole
                        his car...

                                        JOHNNY
                          I didn't 'knock him to the ground'. 
                        It was a little push... he
                        tripped...

                                        SARAH
                                (incredulous)
                          Johnny...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Look, it's not as bad as it seems. 
                        Really.  I'll be back as soon I
                        find Jill.   

            Suddenly, the intercut takes a strange turn as we push to
          Johnny who looks at the phone -- and this time when we
          intercut to Sarah we're --


  3434INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - NIGHT

          And this is not real - it's Johnny's paranoid vision: in
          his mind, the office looks more like NORAD with
            sophisticated technical gear, scanners, satellite maps on
          monitors... experts working on isolating a signal...
          finding Walt signaling Sarah to stretch Johnny longer...
          she nods... now conspiratorial --

                                        SARAH
                        We'll help you look for her,
                          Johnny... we'll come down there...
                        just tell me where you are...

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're tracing this call, aren't
                        you.  From my cell phone signal.

                                        SARAH
                        What are you talking about...

                                        JOHNNY
                          I thought I could trust you, Sarah.  

          Johnny turns off the phone... after a beat, he throws it
          out the window.


  3535INT. BANNERMAN HOUSE - BEDROOM

          Back to reality.

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny?  Johnny?

          She knows he's hung up.  Off her reaction...


  3636INT. (SQUAT) WAREHOUSE#1 -  NIGHT

          The first warehouse we were in when the drugs exploded. 
          As Johnny walks through, on the wall is one of those
            wonderful film noir chiaroscuro shadows -- a bunch of
          vertical lines: shadows of the bars covering the windows.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: ENEMY MIND - ACT TWO - 05/22/02 - YELLOW  24.

          NEW ANGLE

          As Johnny continues inside, NOT looking at the shadows,
          the shadows have now transformed into a silhouette of
          trees blowing softly in a breeze deep in a poplar forest...

          Johnny reaches the same area which, in the teaser, Jill
          and Scott were "squatting" in, but now their items are
          gone...

          Johnny looks through the debris on the floor.  Picks up a
          few junk food wrappers, doesn't get any visions.  But
          then he finds a dime, picks it up and --


3737A JOHNNY FLASH - EXT. ROSIE'S DINER - DAY

          (Note: Johnny's visions now have a darker feel -- they
          are more disjointed, trippier.  Think: "Run Lola Run.")

          6-year-Jill is "sparing for change," panhandling in a
          seedy part of town.  A man gives her a coin.  Behind her,
          we see Rosie's Diner... a sign advertises "Home Cooking"
          and "Truckers welcome".   


  3838RESUME THE WAREHOUSE

          Johnny, a concerned look on his face, puts the coin in
          his pocket...

  4040EXT. ROSIE'S DINER - MORNING

          True to the vision, Jill - the teenage version - is there
          sparing for change.  She hasn't slept.  Pedestrians on
          their way to work mostly ignore her.

                        Can we talk?

          She looks up and sees Johnny and thinks about running... 
          but she's tired and weak with hunger...

                        Okay?  Leave me alone.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        I just want to talk.

          She studies him.  And she has an attitude.  But hunger
          dictates her approach to this guy.  At least there may be
          a free meal ticket here.  If a conversation is the price
          of a meal, so be it.

                                        JILL
                        Okay.  I get a breakfast burrito. 
                        You get a sermon.  But that's it.

                        Deal.

          She studies him a beat, decides the meal is worth the
          risk and promptly ups the ante...

                                        JILL
                        Two breakfast burritos.  My
                          boyfriend is waiting for me to
                        bring him something.  

          As they move toward Rosie's Diner where we see the PT
          Cruiser parked...

                        I'll even throw in some hash
                        browns.

          As they move toward the diner, Johnny's eye is caught by
          a stray alley cat toying with a dead mouse... the cat
          freezes as it sees Johnny as though afraid Johnny will
          take his catch... and Jill touches the door as she
            enters... RAMP TO JOHNNY'S FACE... as he suddenly finds
          himself...

          He turns to see the teenage Jill is the prey there in the
          woods...

          Before he can call out a warning, the vision ends...

          Johnny has been holding the door for an extra beat.  The

          nods uncomfortably.  Enters the diner with Jill.

          He removes the blade from his throat and off camera buries

          (Note: The diner must have a rear exit.) Jill eats a
            breakfast burrito with gusto.  She's hungry, yet with
            occasionally full mouth, she still unburdens herself to
          Johnny.  An extra bag full of food - Scott's bag - is
          also on the table.

                        You totally freaked her out. 
                          Totally.  So far I'm not impressed.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I found you, didn't I?

                        That doesn't prove anything.  So,
                        go on, prove it to me.

                        Your mom has a cork sculpture of
                        a tiny Chinese village, and when
                        you were a little girl, you used
                        to stare at it for hours,
                          daydreaming that you lived in the
                        little house on the island.  You
                        were married and had a little
                        baby and the stork flying over
                        the house was your pet.

          By now, Jill has stopped chewing in shock and now she
          swallows hard.  She stares at him incredulously...

                                        JOHNNY
                        You'd already started running

                        Or do you...?

          Johnny glances out the window... eyes narrow as he sees --

                        things are gonna be easy or that
                        you and your mom are suddenly

                        My mother doesn't want me home...
                        She was going to send me away.  I
                        just saved her the trouble.

                        I can't talk to her.  I've never
                        been able to talk to her.

                                        JOHNNY
                        There are people who can help
                        with those kinds of things.

                                        JILL
                        It's too late for that.  I mean,
                        it's not like I'm planning on
                        doing drugs the rest of my life. 
                        I even told her that I'd go to
                          meetings, you know, like A-A,
                          whatever, but she said she couldn't
                        trust me.  She's never trusted
                        me.
                                (beat, and that hurts)
                        So I left.  And I'm doing all
                        right.  I've got the nicest
                          boyfriend I ever had.  We're even

                        soon as we have the money, which
                        we'd probably already have if
                        this psychic guy hadn't shown the

          as the door opens and Malcolm enters - Johnny sees the
          Cougar tattoo on his hand as he makes eye contact with
          Jill who looks scared... but before we can see what happens
          next, time seems to slow and then actually GOES BACKWARDS
          (STEADY CAM) as though it has stretched like a rubber
          band too far and then is snapped back -- as Johnny's drug-
          induced weird vision shows Malcolm reversing course - and
          this is like a magic carpet ride - with a WHOOSH - Malcolm
          flying backwards in time out the door and down the street
          (walking in reverse) backing into one alley and then
          another... where he is arriving back at the body of Scott,
          sprawled at the foot of the dumpster.

          In this reverse action, Scott stands and Malcolm pulls
          the knife out of him, and then the action begins to move
          forward.  Malcolm kills Scott again, Scott's body falls
          to the ground, and as Malcolm begins to leave the alley
          the vision ends and we...

          miss each other... screeching brakes... more horns... the
          car that missed Johnny stops and the irate driver jumps
          out...

                                        DRIVER
                        Hey, are you okay, Mister?

          Johnny on the ground, tries to get his bearings... ahead
          of him, he sees teenage Jill on the street, glancing back
          as she runs into an alley... he scrambles to his feet,
          picks up his cane and continues the chase...

  5656EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

          Running with Johnny down the alley between warehouses...
          looking for her... looking down one side alley then
          another... finally, he spots her...


          P.O.V. - JILL

          Jill, the teenager, stands by a dumpster very much like
          Johnny saw the little girl standing there in his vision
          in act one.  Completely shellshocked, she looks down at
          Scott's lifeless body, then over at the approaching
            Johnny...


          JOHNNY

          moves to her...

                                        JILL
                        He's dead.

          Johnny who is out of breath... reaches down and checks
          for life signs... on his touch...

                        We can't stay here.  

          He grabs her arm and as he does...


  5959ANOTHER JOHNNY FLASH - THE WOODS - AN OLD DODGE TRUCK

          bearing down on them as Johnny and Tinker Bell run through
          the woods... the massive vehicle crushing through the
          small trees... crushing the trees beneath it as it closes
          in on the runners... closer... closer...          THE DEAD ZONE: ENEMY MIND - ACT THREE - 05/17/02 - BLUE  36.

                        What is it?  What's wrong?  

          Suddenly the sound of an old truck...


          P.O.V. - THE END OF THE ALLEY

          The old truck turns... its wide body almost filling the
          space between the buildings... at the wheel, the silhouette
          of Malcolm...


  6161EXT. STREET - DAY

          Walt, Bruce and Sarah listening to the motorist describe
          the accident he almost had...

                                        DRIVER
                        All I can tell you is that he ran
                        out into traffic like he was blind
                        or something, like he didn't even
                        see us...

                        He took off after a girl... down
                        that alley... toward the old
                          warehouses...


  6262INT. ALLEY - LONG SHOT - JOHNNY AND JILL

          being chased by the truck toward us in the alley -  Johnny
          is moving pretty damn well for a guy who uses a cane but
          it's no match for a truck... and in...


          VARIOUS ANGLES

          it's clear that time is running out for them... it's a
          pretty exciting chase that takes them around a corner...
          down another alley... and out of sight of the dumpster...
          finally...

          And she pulls Johnny into a narrow opening in a warehouse
          wall... and they fall in...


  6363INT. ABANDONED INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY

          As the truck passes by outside... barely missing them...
          then they hear the screeches of brakes as the truck
          stops... she's already got his hand... but for an
          occasional shaft of light, it's extremely dark inside...

                                        JILL
                        Come on... I know all the places
                        to hide...

          Moving with them into the dark labyrinth of the industrial
          plant... through the criss-crossing shadows... into a
          dark hiding place...


          CLOSER

          as they try to keep still... controlling their breath
          from making too much noise... A long beat...

          Noises of someone coming... coming closer...


          THE SILHOUETTE OF MALCOLM'S HEAD

          in the darkness moving awfully near-by... closer, closer...


          JOHNNY AND JILL

          huddle together... about to be discovered... but...


          THE SILHOUETTE

          moves away now and disappears into the darkness... a moment
          later we hear his footsteps climbing stairs...

          JILL

          She grabs Johnny's arm and coaxes him to follow her... as
          she touches him... Johnny notices...


          ON THE WALL - THE SHADOW OF A COUGAR STALKING PREY 


          JOHNNY

            hesitates... doesn't stand... she looks at him...

                                        JILL
                                (whispers)
                        What?

          He looks around confused...

                        Come on... he's gone... I think
                        he went upstairs...

                                        JOHNNY
                          I can't.

                        I'm lost in the woods.

          And as she reacts confused... we track around them to
          reveal that - to Johnny - they're in the woods, surrounded
          by trees as far as the eye can see...

  6464EXT. ALLEY - DAY

          Walt, Bruce and Sarah move down the alley... Sarah spots
          a pair of legs sticking out from behind the dumpster...

                                        SARAH
                        Oh no... Oh no...

          Thinking it's Johnny, she runs down the alley... Bruce
          and Walt are right behind her...


          ANGLE - AS SARAH ARRIVES

          reacts with a mixture of horror and relief as she sees
          it's not Johnny...

                        It's the kid we saw with Jill the

                                (to Sarah)
                        I don't want you to see this.

                                (shaken)
                        It's a little late for that, isn't
                        it?

                        Club drugs are big business down
                        here.  Most of the major dealers
                        are mobbed up.  Not a good field

  6565INT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT -  DAY

          As before, very very dark... Johnny holds tightly onto
          her wrist... as though he's holding on to reality itself...
            whispering...

                                        JILL
                        But that was yesterday... the
                        drugs should have worn off by
                        now...

                        Maybe in other people...

                                        JILL
                        Are you still in the woods?


    6666FAVORING HIS ANGLE

          to see that he still sees them surrounded by the woods...
          he nods, in his own way blind... ...

                                        JOHNNY
                        It doesn't usually stay like
                        this... for this long... I just
                        can't get out of it...

          The teenage Jill is in the woods with him in this view in
          matching proximity as the industrial plant... and as chatty
          as the dialogue sounds... Johnny is still gripping her
          arm and she's scared half to death... so it's not meant
          to be funny when she says:

                                        JILL
                        You know what's funny about this?

                        Not much.

                        I got lost in the woods when I
                        was six.  At a Halloween party.

                        I know.

          She realizes what she has to do in this situation and she
          rises to the challenge.  She moves to look him straight
          in the eye...

                                        JILL
                        I can't remember ever being so
                        scared.  But I got out.  And so
                        will we.  Okay?

                        you trust me to do that?

                        cans... and my old girlfriend
                        who's married to the sheriff was
                        tracing me by satellite through

                        Just remember that your mind reacts

                          sometimes scary ways.  I can help
                        you control it...

          The growl of a large cat startles Johnny and he turns to

          And indeed he moves out of view into the woods... Johnny

                        it doing out here?

          pushes through the woods... but as lightning strikes,
          some trees catch fire - unusual bright white fire... Johnny
          runs from the flames which seem to take on a life of their
          own... like we saw earlier, the trapped souls writhing in
          the sulfurous fires of hell, the trees could be that
          infamous lake of fire's flames... fiery plasma arcs
          reaching to grab him... as he reacts to the flames burning
          his skin... and that's when he yells...

          Johnny turns and suddenly he is back in the --

          and the Cougar is right behind him.  The cougar LEAPS at
          Johnny, and it is as if the cougar brings the woods with
          him and we go back to --          THE DEAD ZONE: ENEMY MIND - ACT FOUR - 05/22/02 - YELLOW  46.


  7878EXT. WOODS

          and the Cougar has changed into Malcolm.  Malcolm drags
          Johnny to the ground.  The two men fight... thunder and
            lightning... Johnny is no match for Malcolm... Malcolm
          starts kicking the crap out of him...  Then, Johnny's
          hand reaches out and finds a short broken branch...

          Johnny gets to his feet and SWINGS the branch at Malcolm,
          when it lands, we suddenly cut to:


  78A78AINT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT

          And we see it is not a stick in Johnny's hand but the
          cane.  Malcolm reels.

          We now INTERCUT between the woods and the plant, a la
          "Altered States."  Each time Johnny swings the branch/cane,
          when it lands on Malcolm, the impact momentarily snaps us
          back into reality...

          Finally, Johnny swings the branch/cane and catches Malcolm
          flush on the side of the head and Malcolm falls... This
          last HIT ends this intercut and now we STAY in:


  7979INT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT

          as Malcolm falls backwards yelling very briefly.


          ANGLE - LOOKING DOWN AT MALCOLM

          We see he's fallen on some industrial equipment below
          grade.  He is strangely contorted - clearly he's broken
          his back and neck...  Blood oozes from his mouth.

          A beat later, Walt, Bruce Sarah and Kohlan, gun drawn,
          run up... and look down at the dead man...

          Mrs. Derr looks exhausted... the television is on in the
            background... and canned sitcom laughter fills the scene
          as she pours herself a cup of herb tea at the kitchen
          counter... for a beat, the day catches up to her and her
          mind drifts and she just stands there thinking but then
          she pulls herself back to the moment and we may realize
          this sort of thing happens a hundred if not a thousand
          times a day.  She reacts as she hears a door shut... and
          her first thought is that it's on the TV... but then she
          realizes who it might be... because every door you hear
          might be the door that brings her back... and this time
          her dreams are realized because as she moves out of the
          kitchen, she sees Jill standing there... and as mother
          and daughter's eyes ask so many questions, a tear rolls
          down Jill's cheek... and she moves into the arms of her
            mother... and these two very troubled women hold each
          other for support... as the sitcom laugh track howls in

          came.

          as Jill sticks her hand around the doorframe.  It's holding
          the Tinker Bell wand, the right distance above the floor
          where a child would hold it.  Johnny reacts as Jill pokes
          her head around the doorframe as well, and we see it's
          the 16-year-old Jill -- she's just kneeling to make herself
          appear shorter.

                        I ran and ran around in there
                        until I got tired and sat down. 
                        My mom; she heard me crying and
                        found me.

          They exchange an intimate look...

                                (moving quickly by
                                the sentiment)
                        Hey, I brought something else...
                        when I was a kid my mom used to
                        read this to me when I was sick
                        in bed... now I'm going to read
                        it to you...

          She shows Johnny a book:  Alice's Adventures In
            Wonderland...

                                        JOHNNY
                        My favorite.  After this we can
                        sing a few choruses of "Puff the
                        Magic Dragon"...

          And as Jill opens the book and begins to read the opening
          lines...

                                        JILL
                        "Alice was beginning to get very
                        tired of sitting by her sister on
                        the bank, and of having nothing
                        to do..."

          And we pull back and...

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                        END OF ACT FOUR

                                              THE END
