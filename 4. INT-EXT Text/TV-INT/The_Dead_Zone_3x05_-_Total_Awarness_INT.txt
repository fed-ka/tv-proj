          A TRUCK is FLYING THROUGH -- no signs of stopping.

          The car SWERVES to the left, BARELY MISSING THE TRUCK,
          before T-BONING a parked car.  The truck KEEPS GOING.


  44INSIDE THE CAR

          Gibson is shaken, but apparently unhurt.  She checks
          Sylvia, who is dead, then looks around worried.  Gibson
          TUGS Sylvia's purse away, kicks open the passenger side
          door, and GETS OUT.



          Looking from on high -- FLASH POPPING frame by frame --
          watching Gibson RUNNING FROM THE SCENE.  Grainy,
          voyeuristic and threatening, this footage should suggest
          that SOMEONE IS WATCHING.  FLASH POP TO --



          JOHNNY SMITH and BRUCE approaching.  STAY ON this low-
          grade video camera just a little too long... again, SOMEONE
          IS WATCHING.  Pan down to reveal Johnny and Bruce entering.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not obsessive.  I'm selective.

                                        BRUCE
                        So then select something.  This
                        is the third store we've been in
                        today. 



          As Johnny and Bruce browse.  ANOTHER GRAINY POV.

                                        BRUCE
                        You know what I got for my ninth
                          birthday?  A bible.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And apparently you're still bitter
                        about it.          DEAD ZONE: TOTAL AWARENESS - ACT TEASER  - 1/15/04 - BLUE-2  3.

          Johnny glides past the squirt guns, sports gear and movie
          tie-ins toward a set of Lego action figures (the kind you
          have to assemble).  He touches one --

          J.J. unwraps the container as Johnny -- present in the
          scene -- watches with expectation.  But as J.J. opens it,
          the lid FLIES OFF, SPEWING Lego pieces everywhere.

          Johnny moves on to the science toys, picking up a ROCK-
            POLISHING KIT--

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm officially a dad now.  I can't
                        just give J.J. a card and a twenty--


  1212VISION - ALTERNATE BIRTHDAY PARTY

          J.J. unwrapping the rock polishing kit -- again, Johnny
          is right at J.J.'s shoulder.  The other boys HOOT.  Another
          miss: Johnny might as well have gotten him socks.

                        Okay, nothing geological.  I'm
                        a... fun dad.

          He picks up a bow-and-arrow set, but now Bruce takes it.

                                        BRUCE
                        You don't need a vision to see
                        that's a bad idea.

                        I need something... something
                          perfect.

          As his eyes, then Bruce's eyes, settle on--


            A SKATEBOARD

          Bruce picks it up.  A big smile.

                        Now we're talking, fun dad.

          He hands the board to Johnny, who happily accepts it.  We
          hear a DEAD ZONE WHOOSH!, which makes Johnny think, then
          turn back.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Helmet.  Definitely need a helmet.

          He tucks a helmet under his arm.



            A middle-aged female CLERK puts the helmet in a bag with
          the skateboard as Johnny pulls his credit card out of his
          wallet.

                                        CLERK
                          Ninety-nine forty.

          The Clerk accepts the card, swipes it.

                                        BRUCE
                        J.J.'s gonna love it.  And your
                          driveway is a perfect track--

          BEEP.  The card isn't working.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Problem?

          The Clerk swipes the card a second time.  Another BEEP. 
          This time the Clerk reaches for her scissors.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What are you doing?

          She's CUTTING the card INTO PIECES.

                                        CLERK
                        Sorry, Mr. Smith, but your card
                        has been revoked--

          The Clerk DROPS the pieces into Johnny's outstretched
          hand.  As they land--

          Staring at the credit card shreds in his hand.  Meanwhile,
          Bruce has pulled out his wallet.

                                        BRUCE
                        I got you covered.  How much was
                        that again?

                                        CLERK
                          Ninety-nine forty.  Cash or credit?

          Bruce starts to hand her his credit card, then thinks
          better of it.  Smiles.

                                        BRUCE
                        Cash.  Definitely cash.

            Disturbed by his visions, Johnny steps away and looks up
          at--


          A STORE SECURITY CAMERA

          Staring down at him, silent, LED glowing.  A few quick
          glances and Johnny SEES three more cameras.  Damn things
          are everywhere.  Bruce steps up, holding the new purchases.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Let's get out of here.



          Staring back at Johnny and Bruce, looking up at the camera. 
          As they exit, Gibson appears, dark eyes on Johnny, slipping
          out after him, hiding her face from the camera.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

          FADE IN:


          Johnny is on the phone, agitated, as Bruce examines the
          badly-gift wrapped helmet and skateboard.

                                        JOHNNY
                        ...but all my payments on that
                        credit card should be current.
                                (listens)
                        No, not personally.  They're made
                        through a trust--
                                (more listening)
                        That far behind?  Okay, thanks.

          He hangs up without saying good-bye.

                                        BRUCE
                        Man, you've gotta get this money
                        thing straight with Purdy.  Aren't
                        you afraid he's ripping you off?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's complicated.  Don't worry,
                        I'm dealing with it.

          Bruce hands Johnny the skateboard package, shaking his
          head as Johnny's phone RINGS again.  Johnny sighs and
            answers--

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hello?

                                        FEMALE OPERATOR (V.O.)
                        Good afternoon Mr. Smith.  This
                        is Bonnie with Wind-n-Sea Cruises
                        and I'm happy to inform you that
                        you have won an all-expense paid
                          cruise...

                        Not interested...



          Behind the wheel, Gibson, now revealed as "Bonnie, the
          Female Operator."  She's  parked up the street from
          Johnny's house.  As she continues her rap to Johnny, she
            SCRIBBLES NUMBERS on her left forearm, using a felt marker. 
          (She has PUSHED UP the sleeves of her sweatshirt to reveal
          that both forearms are covered with numbers.  These are
          not tattoos, but plain old ink.)

          We SEE THE NUMBERS as she gleans them off Johnny,
            superimposing her visions of rapidly flashing numerals
          across her face.

                                        GIBSON/BONNIE (PHONE)
                        Not interested?  Not even if I
                        told you this fabulous once-in-a-
                          lifetime romantic cruise is valued
                        at 2,399 dollars?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sorry, I don't want to waste your
                        time.

                                        GIBSON/BONNIE (PHONE)
                        If you'll just take a minute to
                        hear what you've won, you won't
                        regret it... Are you sitting down?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, I'm hanging up.

          And he does.



          Talking to the dial tone.

                                        GIBSON
                          ...Thanks for your time...

          She finishes writing down the last of the numbers on her
          arm, pressing hard, like a compulsive.  Then she tosses
          the phone out the car window.

          She TAKES A BREATH, as if the process of "reading" Johnny
          was physically difficult.

          The contents of Sylvia's purse are spread on the car seat
          next to her, notably a TAROT CARD, a FEATHERED DART, and
          half a dozen additional CELL PHONES.  Gibson tosses the
          tarot card, dart and other cell phones into her back pack,
          then dumps the purse and everything else in the back seat.

          She PULLS DOWN HER SLEEVES, looks out the front windshield,
          sees--



          In fact, it's only half a dozen nine-year-old boys, though
          more are arriving with various parents.  Amid the general
          chaos we find SARAH, a BIRTHDAY CAKE in her arms, greeting
          one of J.J.'s friends (ZACK).

                                        SARAH
                        Hey, Zack, ready for some mortal

                        J.J.!

          J.J. turns toward her from the scrum of boys.

                                        J.J.
                        What?

          She gives him a handful of coin-like tokens.

                                        J.J.
                          Awesome!  Thanks, mom.

                        party.

          He and Roth move off.

          JOHNNY

          A big wrapped PACKAGE under his arm, as he deftly slides
          through a sea of tweens, parents, and Laser Tag employees
          in their black T-shirts and headphones.  As Johnny reaches
          Walt and Sarah, he freezes, and looks directly up at--


          A SECURITY MONITOR

          Above the front desk, showing multiple views of the Laser
          Tag facility.  Including one of Johnny looking up at the
          monitor.

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny?

          Momentarily spooked, Johnny responds--

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sorry.  Where's the Birthday Boy?
                                (spotting his son)
                        Hey, J.J.!

          J.J. WAVES a quick hello, then dives back in with his
          buddies.  Sarah takes the present from Johnny.

                                        SARAH
                        Why don't I take that?  You two
                        better gear up--

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gear up?

          He sees Walt holding a pair of GAME VESTS.  FWAP!  A vest
          hits Johnny in the chest.

                                        WALT
                        Welcome to fatherhood.



            A black-walled maze filled with smoke.  Human shapes,
          both child and adult, ZOOM back and forth, FIRING laser
          beams with enthusiasm and abandon.  We hear a cascade of
          ELECTRONIC PINGS as the hits ring up.

          Find Johnny, totally into it and moving fast despite the
          cane, snagging J.J. as he passes.

                        Oh yeah?

          He MOVES OFF to shadow Walt -- the biggest killing machine
          in the maze.  Sure enough, Walt is BLAZING AWAY like a
          laser tag Rambo.  Johnny makes what looks like a suicidal
          move, STEPPING INTO Walt's field of fire.

                                        WALT
                        Eat laser beams, punk!

            A BARRAGE OF RED BOLTS hits Johnny.  Then he RUNS OFF,
          finds J.J.

                        Come on.

          Johnny leads J.J. into a narrow passage, then turns him
          around and aims him back the way they came.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Wait until I give you the signal.

          Then he takes up a position at the other end of the choke
          point.  A larger figure APPEARS between them.  Walt.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Now!

          J.J. rains RED BOLTS on Walt, who is being TAGGED by Johnny
          from the other side.  Walt WHIRLS and returns fire.

                                        WALT
                        That's it!  You're going down!

          Then he BLASTS them, and the chase is on again.  Walt
          rounds a corner, only to be ambushed by --


          BRUCE

          Guns blazing.  Bruce retreats, Walt in hot pursuit.

  2525THREE QUICK VISIONS - GIBSON

          In the car with Sylvia seconds before the crash... watching
          Johnny in the toy store... and talking on the cell phone
          in the front seat of her stolen car--

                        to hear-- 

          --She's also WRITING on her forearm.


  2626RESUME JOHNNY

          Disoriented by smoke and darkness as well as the vision. 
          He sees Gibson looking at him, red lasers slicing past
          her.  Something spooks her, and she suddenly turns,
            disappearing deeper into the maze.  Ignoring the continuing
          PINGS of lasers tagging him, Johnny SLIPS through the
          dark and smoke.  (The Man and Woman we saw earlier ARE
          HERE, IGNORING all the other players.)

          Johnny rounds a corner and finds her waiting for him.

                                        GIBSON
                                (insistently)
                        We need to talk!

          She REACHES INTO HER BACKPACK.  The gesture makes Johnny
            hesitate.  Does she have a gun?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Do I know you?

          Before she can answer, TWO GREEN LASER BEAMS converge on
          her.  She moves, pulling Johnny into the path of the beams,
          triggering --


2727A VISION

          Flying back down the green beams to the "couple," Adams
          and Roth.  They are dressed for laser tag (or not?), but
          the weapons they hold are REAL PISTOLS.  With silencers.

          Adams and Roth both SHOOT Gibson, who FALLS DOWN DEAD.


  2828RESUME JOHNNY

          He pushes Gibson aside and TURNS TOWARD Adams and Roth. 
          But the crush of laser taggers is too great.  Realizing
          they've been spotted, the couple MELTS into the crowd and
          disappears into the darkness.

          Each display is met with a round of boos or cheers.  Walt

                        It's Johnny, who knows?  Maybe he
                        got overwhelmed by all the kids.

                        Let me call him.

          As Bruce SPEED DIALS Johnny's number, nearby, J.J. listens
            intently, wondering what's going on with Johnny.

                                        SARAH
                        It's time to light the candles--

                        He's not answering.

          Walt and Sarah look at each other, at J.J., then at the 
          boys who hover around the cake, ready to RIOT.

                        okay?

          Off J.J., satisfied but still disappointed--



          With Coulter behind him (TABLET COMPUTER under his arm),
          Johnny UNLOCKS his door and TOUCHES his security system

          They slip past Johnny, who follows Coulter to--



          Adams and Roth pass through different parts of the house,
          VISIBLE on Johnny's security system MONITOR.  Coulter
          OPENS his tablet and starts navigating his way through a
          menu on the screen.  (By the way, all this technology is
          off the shelf and already in use in some form today.)


          ON THE SCREEN

          A ROW OF THUMBNAILS from various security camera feeds
          Coulter is monitoring, including Johnny's cameras.  In
          another window on the screen, Coulter has called up a
          record of Johnny's ALARM ACTIVITY.

                                        JOHNNY

                          protection.

          A LOGO for ARGON SECURITY glows from the flat panel. 
            Something clicks in Johnny's mind, and he looks to...


          KITCHEN SECURITY MONITOR

          Down in the corner, something he never noticed before,
          the same ARGON logo.  Curious, he goes to his alarm control
          panel in the kitchen -- there's that logo again.


          WIDER VIEW

          Johnny returns to Coulter and the computer monitor, cocking
          his head to make sense of it.

                        I'm not allowed to know how? 
                        Seems very "1984."

                        "1984" was twenty years ago, Mr.
                        Smith.  Surely it's worth

          Johnny thinks about touching Coulter's laptop, but Coulter
          turns back, watching him.  Johnny's feeling more and more
            uncomfortable.  Coulter exits, leaving Johnny alone in

          another tablet computer while he talks on the phone.

                        You let her get to Smith once
                          already.

                        and I'm with Mr. Smith right now. 
                        He's secure.

          Coulter gives Johnny a thumbs up.  Johnny smiles wanly. 
          Even without hearing the other end of the phone
            conversation, he feels anything but secure.

                                        SCANLON
                        You've got forty-eight hours until
                        the senate hearing to wrap this
                        up.  Find the girl.  Find Neal
                          Pynchon.  And keep Johnny Smith
                        under lock and key.  Understood?

          Scanlon hangs up.  Coulter snaps his phone shut, giving
          Johnny a confident smile.          DEAD ZONE: TOTAL AWARENESS - ACT ONE - 1/14/04 - WHITE-2  19.



          Gibson, hunkered down, looking in the rearview back at
          Johnny's house.  Roth and Adams are out front.  The SUV
          and their Crown Vic are clearly visible.  Gibson dials
          911 on yet another cell phone.

                        I live on Cecil Green Park Drive,
                        6200 block, and there's two
                        suspicious men parked in a car in
                        front of my house--

                        Okay, I have possible burglars at
                        6200 block of Cecil Green Park. 
                        May I have your name--?

          Gibson's already hung up, DROPPING THE PHONE out the
          window.  Crunch.  She turns her attention back toward
          Johnny's house, waiting for events to unfold.



          Coulter returns, tries for casual with Johnny, who now
          knows something is very wrong.  Johnny listens to Coulter,
          but is calculating his options all the while.

          darts by himself in a tiny ROADHOUSE, a stack of empty

          end of the bar, the BARTENDER (DOUG) and TWO REGULARS
          (FITCH and NICK) watch him, shaking their heads.

          Johnny, in the vision, watches the young man, totally
          absorbed in his game.  He takes note of the bartender and
          the regulars.

          Johnny surveys the bar, notices a bumper sticker on the
          cash register that reads, "WHERE THE HELL IS KEYHOLE, NEW
          HAMPSHIRE?"

          He hands the dart back to Gibson.

                          Anything?

                          Keyhole, New Hampshire.  Doesn't
                        mean he's still there.

          Gibson shakes her head with a smile and puts the car in
          gear.  As they pass the Stoners on their way out, Gibson
          notices them getting out of their car, littering beer
          cans as they all head off into the woods to take a leak.

                                                                                  CUT TO:          DEAD ZONE: TOTAL AWARENESS - ACT TWO - 1/14/04 - WHITE-2  30.

                        So, Gibson... You strike me as
                          somewhat of a free spirit.  How'd
                        you wind up working for the

                        It's okay.  I mean, it happened
                        when I was a baby.  Spent a couple
                        years in foster care...  No one
                        knew what to do with me.  The
                        numbers would start to come on
                        all fast and furious, and I
                          couldn't make it stop.  I used to
                        sit in a corner and bang my head
                        against the wall, trying to shut
                        it off.  My caseworker decided I
                        was autistic and put me in an
                          institution.

          Coulter snaps his phone shut.


          TIGHT ON COULTER'S TABLET

            A "SEARCHING" indicator FLASHES for a few beats, then a
          Yahoo!- style map POPS UP, showing the area around the
          truck stop.  A few more CLICKS and we ZOOM IN on a MAP of
          the truck stop itself.  Several small EYEBALL ICONS BLINK,
          indicating nearby surveillance cameras.

          Coulter CLICKS on the nearest one and a window OPENS
          revealing--


6666A LIVE VIEW OF THE TRUCK STOP

          Coulter CAN SEE HIMSELF standing in the security view. 
          He LOOKS UP, spotting the camera.

          Beneath the window is a small graphic with arrows to STOP,
          REVERSE, PLAY, etc.  Coulter hits REVERSE.  Grins.

                                        COULTER
                        Please be kind.  Rewind.

          The view WHIZZES back -- people leaving and entering the
          lot, a guy having a smoke, a couple making out -- until
          TWO FIGURES APPEAR -- JUMPING BACKWARDS out of a truck:
          Johnny and Gibson.

                                        COULTER
                        Gotcha.



          Johnny and Gibson are getting impatient, as they wait in
          silence.

                                        GIBSON
                        Why aren't we moving?

          Scanlon calls up a map of New Hampshire.


          TIGHT ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN

          as he pulls down a menu next to the map.

          The menu is titled: "Asset Coverage" and lists things
          like:  CELL PHONE, RADIO, TELEVISION, PRIVATE SECURITY,
          SATELLITE, TRAFFIC MONITORS, ELECTRICAL GRID, etc.  At
          the bottom of the long list is a selection that reads:
          "Show All."  Scanlon clicks it.  Instantly the map begins
          to fill up with overlapping colored circles, showing the
            multitude of coverage areas EYETRAP has access to.  Within
          a few seconds the map is completely covered -- except for
          one small dark area.  Scanlon zooms in on the map to reveal
          a tiny speck of a town:  KEYHOLE, NEW HAMPSHIRE.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

          riddled with bullet holes, it reads: "Welcome to Keyhole,

          the TOW TRUCK passing.

          Eight stools, the same two regulars (Fitch and Nick), and  
          the bartender (Doug).

          All turn toward Johnny and Gibson as they enter -- a hairy
          eyeball moment.

                                        GIBSON
                          Evening, gentlemen.

          A beat.  Doug gestures to two of the open stools.

                        What'll it be?  We have beer,

                        I'll have a whiskey.  Small batch
                        if possible.  Neat.

                        Beer it is.

          Doug pulls two drafts from the micro-brew tap behind the
          bar.

                                        DOUG

          A DARTBOARD

          He casually slides over there and PULLS the darts out of
          the board.  The instant he touches them--


7979A VISION - DAY

          Dart vision -- WHOOSHING toward the board -- TWANG!  Then
          the dart is PULLED OUT by the same guy from Johnny's
          earlier vision.  Fitch and Nick are here, with Doug the 
          bartender-- they all seem to know Pynchon.  Maybe they're
          protecting him.

                                        DOUG
                        Double or nothing, Neal?

                        going--

          He shrugs on a sheepskin coat and heads for the door. 
          Johnny, present in the vision, sees this and follows him--


  8080GIBSON

          She watches Johnny WALKING OUT THE DOOR, a distracted
          look on his face.  Gibson makes a lame attempt at a
          graceful exit--

                                        GIBSON
                        Well, thanks for the hospitality,
                        but we gotta blaze--

          And she RUSHES OUT.  Doug, Fitch and Nick exchange looks.



          Fitch is looking out the window.  To Doug --

                        This is all my fault.  I asked

                        I knew Scanlon was up to something. 
                          I should have calculated the risks
                        more carefully.
                                (to Gibson)
                        At least you got out alive.  My
                        advice is to keep running.  That's
                        what I intend to do.  Tonight.

          Pynchon starts throwing things into a small bag.

          notices.

                                        PYNCHON
                        Put that down.

          Pynchon grabs for the picture in Johnny's hands, brushing
          against Johnny and triggering --


  8989VISION

          A security camera POV from an ATM.  The young woman from
          the photograph is making a withdrawal.  Behind her stands
          a MAN dressed in black, dark glasses and a baseball cap
            obscuring his face.  As the woman finishes her withdrawal,
          the man robs her, taking her money, then shoots her point
          blank.  As she falls to the ground, the man casually walks
          away.  As the sequence ends, it suddenly snaps back to
          the beginning and repeats.

          The vision widens to reveal Johnny, watching this on a
          computer monitor -- the view widens further to reveal
          Johnny is in Pynchon's office.  Pynchon is at his desk,
          watching the sequence repeat over and over, a bottle of
          Scotch in front of him.

                        She was murdered. 

          Pynchon pulls away from Johnny.  Disturbed.

                                        PYNCHON
                        How did you --
                                (thinking)
                        Oh, right.  Your abilities.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You loved her.  I can see that
                        just by looking at your face.

          Pynchon nods.

                                        JOHNNY
                        But you couldn't save her.  So
                        now you're just giving up?  You're
                        not even willing to try?

                                        PYNCHON
                        You don't understand.  I did try. 
                          I created Eyetrap because of her. 
                        I did it for Amy.

                        She didn't fight, she didn't
                          scream...  She gave him the money
                        but the bastard shot her anyway.

          Gibson touches his arm.  He lets her, then shies away,
            unwilling to be comforted.  Picks up a dart from the table.

                                        PYNCHON
                        I was working on face recognition
                          software for the Defense Department
                        at the time.  I thought if I could
                        link that up with information
                          gathering technology the NSA was
                          testing, I'd have the kind of
                        total information awareness that
                        could find the creep who shot
                        her.  My program became the basis
                        for Eyetrap.

          He FIRES the dart at the photo--


          CLOSE ON THE PHOTO - THE MUGGER

          A shadowed face DOMINATED BY SUNGLASSES AND A HAT.

                        It took Eyetrap less than a day
                        to match this guy to three other
                        crimes.  The same M.O.  Eight
                          different cameras.  Two other
                        victims shot.


          WIDER VIEW

          as Johnny and Gibson listen, moved by his story.

                                        PYNCHON
                        But I could never identify him. 
                          A billion dollars worth of image
                          recognition software, beaten by
                        some low-life in a baseball cap
                        and a pair of drugstore sunglasses. 

          He reaches for the bottle of Scotch, but Gibson, almost
          without thinking, takes it away before he can touch it. 
          He looks at her, pissed at first, but then something about
          the way she is looking at him, the empathy and sadness in
          her eyes, makes him acquiesce.

                                        PYNCHON
                        But it was perfect for spying on
                        your friends and neighbors.

                        Great for amassing information on
                          political rivals.  The crooks
                        know how to beat the system, but
                        your average joe doesn't have a
                        clue.  And Scanlon knows it.  I
                        thought I was part of something
                        good, something that would protect
                        lives.  But instead, Scanlon and
                        the others are using it to ruin
                        lives.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So you're just gonna let them
                        win?  Light out for the woods and
                        crawl into a bottle -- that's
                        your plan?

                                        PYNCHON
                        You got a better one?  Scanlon is 
                          invulnerable.  He has friends in
                        high places, and whatever enemies
                        he has can't touch him.  He knows
                        too much.  He knows everything.
                              (a bitter smile)
                        Thanks to me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's right.
                                (off Pynchon's look)
                        I know how you feel.  Your friends
                        are dead and it all seems
                          impossible, so you want to run. 
                        But there's still someone here
                        who needs your protection.

          Pynchon looks over at Gibson, seeming very vulnerable
          right now beneath her tough girl exterior.

                                        PYNCHON
                        What do you want me to do?

                                        GIBSON
                        We can't give up.  If they win,
                        it won't matter if we get away.

            A moment, as Pynchon weighs his option.  Then Johnny sees--


          A GREEN TARGETING DOT

          Moving quickly along the cabin wall until it FINDS HIM,
            centering on his chest and triggering--          DEAD ZONE: TOTAL AWARENESS - ACT FOUR - 1/9/04 - GREEN  52.


9191A JOHNNY VISION

          Johnny turns off the lantern, plunging the cabin into
            darkness.  WHOOSH!  We follow the beam THROUGH THE WINDOW
          and into the night beyond, where Adams, wearing night
          vision goggles, AIMS a weapon at Johnny, and FIRES--


          RAMP BACK INTO CABIN - NIGHT VISION

          One after another, Johnny is HIT, followed by Gibson,
          then Pynchon.  They fall to the floor--

          Back before he turned down the lantern, realizing this
          was a deadly vision.  And seeing that GREEN TARGETING DOT
          moving up his chest toward his head.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Down!

          Johnny hesitates for a second, thinking about the vision
          and how to change the outcome.  He spots a high powered
          flashlight on the counter and grabs it, then turns off
          the lantern.

          Pynchon GRABS Gibson and DRAGS her out of the line of
          fire, SHELTERING HER behind a couch.

          Coulter is suddenly inside.  Wearing NIGHT VISION GOGGLES,
          he SWEEPS the interior with the green targeting beam of
          his weapon.

          he TURNS THE FLASHLIGHT ON, blinding Coulter's night
          vision.  The whole view WHITES OUT.  Johnny's image
          DISAPPEARS as--

          From outside the cabin, comes a muffled THUMP! THUMP!

          A beat.  Johnny goes to--


          THE CABIN DOOR

          Johnny swings it open, to find Adams and Roth on the
          ground.  Doug, Fitch and Nick stand over them, knee in

                        Yeah, we're just outside of the
                          blackout zone.

                                        GIBSON
                        It was kinda nice, the quiet.

          She scratches her arms compulsively.  Johnny hands the
          tablet computer to Pynchon.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Ready to give it a try?

          Pynchon hesitates before he puts his fingers on the

                          A street in Georgetown, three
                        days ago.  Scanlon and Senator
                          Marshall.

                                        GIBSON
                        Do we know for sure we're going
                        to find something?

                                        PYNCHON
                        Scanlon is so paranoid he records
                          everything.  Guy makes Richard
                        Nixon look like a trusting soul.

          Pynchon fingerwhips his way through some menus.

                                        PYNCHON
                        Okay, that's level one.  Now we'll
                        try the special access code... 
                        We'll just slip in the back way,
                        see what's in his underwear drawer.

          He TYPES IN A STRING OF NUMBERS.  Then freezes.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What is it?  Something wrong?

          Pynchon types the numbers again.  Nothing.

                                        PYNCHON
                        The code.  They changed it.

                                        GIBSON
                        Don't you have some kind of double-
                        secret backdoor code?

      Pynchon looks at her with amusement.

                                        PYNCHON
                        This was a billion-dollar project. 
                        Every keystroke had to be approved. 
                        I'm afraid we're outta luck.

          They are interrupted by the arrival of Coulter (his arm
            bandaged) and Adams and Roth, hands bound, both of them. 
          Nick and Fitch have them under guard.  Doug comes up to
          Johnny, Gibson and Pynchon at the bar.

                                        DOUG
                        What do you want us to do with

                        Get them to a doctor -- but take
                        your time.

          As Pynchon frets over the tablet computer, Gibson heads
          straight for Coulter, picking up the .22. 

                                        GIBSON
                        Or we could do to them what they
                        did to Sylvia and the others.

                        It was nothing personal,

          She points the rifle right at his head.

                                        GIBSON
                        So you won't take it personally
                        when I shoot you?  Good to know.

                                        DOUG
                        I like this girl.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Give me that.

          Johnny takes the rifle from Gibson.

                        That's not how this is going to
                        work.

          Coulter just laughs.

                        Go ahead and kill me.  You think
                        you can stop the future?  Take
                        down Eyetrap and there'll be

  100100B&W SECURITY FOOTAGE - A STREET - DAY - SURVEILLANCE CAM
          POV

          A street in Georgetown, some traffic and a few pedestrians,
            including SENATOR THEODORE MARSHALL -- and SCANLON.  We
          are seeing them from A TRAFFIC SURVEILLANCE CAMERA, UP
          HIGH, panning as it finds the pair, then GOES CLOSER.  We
          hear them on a directional microphone that loses a bit of
          presence every time a head is turned.

                                        SENATOR MARSHALL
                        I know all about the budget
                          authorization, and I can count
                        heads: you're one vote short.

                                        SCANLON
                        Which is why I'm here now, Senator.

                                        SENATOR MARSHALL
                        What is it you've got?  Tax
                          records?  My drug prescriptions? 
                        Maybe your extortion tactics worked
                        on the others, but there's nothing 
                        about me that hasn't come out at
                        some point in six campaigns.

                                        SCANLON
                        We don't need to talk like this. 
                        Not here.

                                        SENATOR MARSHALL
                        We don't need to talk at all, do
                        we?  I should just assume that
                        you know everything.  Thanks to
                          Eyetrap.
                                (jabs a finger in
                                  Scanlon's chest)
                        Do your worst, Scanlon.  I'm voting
                        no.

          Scanlon regards the Senator with a mixture of pity and
            contempt.

                                        SCANLON
                        I'm disappointed, Senator.  Very
                          disappointed.

          He and Senator Marshall start across the street.  But
          Scanlon STOPS.  As Marshall continues across the street,
          A MAN with an umbrella, crossing in the opposite direction,
          bumps into the Senator.  The Senator takes two more steps
          then collapses.

                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: TOTAL AWARENESS - ACT FOUR - 1/15/04 - BLUE-2  58.


    100CONTINUED:100

          A beat.  As Pedestrians RUSH toward the Senator, Scanlon 
          turns and walks away.  Then the man who bumped into the
          Senator looks back over his shoulder at the Senator --
          it's Coulter.  He drops the umbrella into a trash can and
          walks off.


          THE VIEW PULLS BACK TO REVEAL:



          Johnny, a pile of letters in his hands (he's just come in
          from the mailbox), watching this on his big screen TV. 
          The surveillance footage cuts to a news report.

                        As the scandal widens, the FBI
                        also continues to search in vain
                        for the hackers who broke into
                        one of the most secure computer

                        footage...

          Johnny, on the phone with Sarah, smiles at his handiwork
          as he simultaneously opens his mail.

                        talk to you later.

          They hang up as Johnny opens an envelope and finds new
          credit card.  He looks at it with not a little suspicion. 
          Tosses it on the table.

          Then he finds a postcard... one side shows the Live Free
          or Die Beer Bar & Bait Shop, the other side is BLANK except
          for Johnny's name and address.  Touching it triggers--


  101A101AA JOHNNY VISION

          Pynchon and Gibson, together on a sunny, deserted beach. 
          Gibson's bare arms now free of numbers.  They seem very

          and he dives out of the way as...


          J.J. BANNERMAN

          slices past the couch on his new skateboard, helmet on,
          crashing into Johnny, both of them laughing.  Johnny helps
          him up and J.J. skates off, cutting around a corner.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, I'm letting you skateboard
                        in the house, but watch the

          A CRASH from O.S.

                                        J.J.
                        Sorry!

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's okay!
                                (to himself)
                        Yeah, I'm a fun dad...

          Johnny heads for his son, passing a table piled high with
          ripped out security equipment.

                                                                              FADE OUT:
