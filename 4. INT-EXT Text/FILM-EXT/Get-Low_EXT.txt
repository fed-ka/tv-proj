From a distance and through the trees we see a raging hell
fire engulfing a small two story house. It burns and burns.
Out of nowhere a man bursts through a second story window,
lands hard and rolls to smother his burning clothes.
He crawls away and staggers up and for a moment looks as if
he might run back into the flames. But the heat is
unbearable. He runs toward us then past us through black
shadows. We cannot see his face,
Glass in a weathered window glitters with early morning sun.
A rock shatters one of the remaining glass panes!
The rock thrower, TOM ( 10) is hightailing it away from an
isolated Appalachian SHACK as the door bangs open, a shotgun
barrel appears, and a chicken comes SQUAWKING out from under
the porch!
Thinking he's sure to be shot, Tom runs into the old barn!
Looking back over his shoulder, Tom runs for the road. Two of
his BUDDIES are already kicking up dust.
BUSH (72) steps into the sun and watches the boy run off with
a look of muted anger, sadness, and something much deeper.
The loneliness of the empty cemetery is broken by Wiley
Starke's fresh grave. The mounded earth is covered with
beautiful flowers and wreathes, a loving send off from his
family and friends. As we pan past the flowers and cards..
we realize that the cemetery is not quite empty.
Hunkered down nearby, Bush is as still as a gravestone,
staring at the last resting place of his old friend.
As Bush gets up to leave he stops abruptly and stands frozen,
staring at a pot of YELLOW FLOWERS on a distant grave. Now he
turns and walks quickly away in the opposite direction.
4.
Wrapped in his quilt and carrying the oil lamp, Bush moves
slowly toward the barn. But he is so wracked with fever he
has to stop. It stuns him that he can't go on. He never
thought anything could stop him. Stuck in the rain with the
shaking lamp sizzling, he stares into the forever darkness,
the muscles in his jaw rippling in the pale light.
BUSH
Well hell..
PAN across the stillness of the foothills to the barn. The
door is still swung wide open.
Back from the brink of death, Bush emerges into the blinding
sunlight. Mule is dozing in his favorite spot. He swings his
big gray head over at Bush.
BUSH
Ahh, don't look so disappointed.
17 OMITTED 17
Mule watches Bush heave a creaky old wagon out from behind
the barn. Mule climbs up on all fours. Bush gets a set of
reins and walks toward him. Mule starts to take a stroll,
knowing what the reins mean.
BUSH
You better not.
Mule looks back, sees an apple in Bush's hand, and stops.
BUSH
And coffee when we get there.
Old wheels creak and moan. Bush and Mule ease up Main street
with the cart. PEOPLE try to catch a glimpse of the infamous
recluse.
Mule comes to a wearied stop, breathing hard. Bush climbs off
the cart and walks Mule, ignoring the eyes upon him.
Bush heads off down the road on his wagon. Horton, Buddy, and
Kathryn appear at the door and watch him go.
HORTON
That was, uh, different.
KATHRYN
I heard such awful things about him
when I was a kid.
HORTON
My mother probably told you some of
them.
Kathryn goes back into the church with Horton who is cooing
at the baby. Buddy lingers, staring at Bush, thinking..
Bush's wagon loaded with bags of feed and supplies, sits in
front of the Diner.
Bush is holding a big tin cup of coffee for Mule who is
drinking it and loving it.
Tom (the kid who threw the rock) comes from behind the diner
with a full garbage can to empty into the big trash barrels
on the back of an old pick-up truck. He sees Bush and
freezes.
Bush looks up and stares at him.
The diner door snaps open and BONNIE (30's), Tom's mother,
steps out. She sees Tom and Bush staring at each other.
BONNIE
What are you doing, son?
Now Tom is scared to death that Bush is going to tell on him.
Bonnie doesn't like this staring match at all.
10.
BONNIE
Empty those cans in your daddy's
truck and get back in here. Now.
Finally Bush drops his gaze and lets Tom off the hook.
Relieved, Tom heaves the can up into the truck. Bonnie
hesitates then goes back into the diner just as...
.CARL (30s), his sidekick, GARY, and two other MEN come
across the street toward the diner. Gary sees Mule slurping
coffee from the big tin cup.
GARY
Look at that. A mule drinking
coffee!
CARL
Finally found somebody that likes
Bonnie's coffee.
As they move past, they see Bush standing there..
WORKER
Ya'll better hush, that's old Bush.
Carl eyes him. Gary and the others throw curious glances as
they head into the diner. Carl stops.
CARL
Hey..
(NO RESPONSE)
I'm talking to you..
Carl picks up a handful of gravel, tosses some over
nonchalantly in Bush's direction. Bush ignores it.
CARL
We know about you. You stay out of
this diner. There's women and
children here and we don't want you
around them.
Bush stands to mount up, never turning around.
CARL
You better hear me. I see you here
again, I'll.. Hey! Hey!
Hearing the hollering, Tom looks up from the pick-up.
Carl throws a stone, harder this time to get Bush's
attention.
11.
But the rock misses Bush and hits Mule, startling him. Old
instincts kick in and he has a VIOLENT FIT.
CARL
Shit..
Carl moves up to try and calm him..
.as Bush tries to ease Mule down the cart hitch grinds a
GASH in Mule's hind-quarter. Mule whinnies painfully, slowly
surrendering.
As Carl steps up, Bush yanks the BRAKE HANDLE off the cart
and hits Carl in the chest. Air explodes from Carl as he
gasps with pain. Before he can move, Bush hits him again in
the same place. Carl wants to hit back but he has no air.
Lightning quick, Bush steps back and hits Carl again in the
exact same place.
Carl falls like a bag of bones. He looks up and sees Bush
towering over him with a terrible bottled up darkness in him.
It has all happened so fast it feels like an awful dream to
Carl.
TOM
Daddy!
Wild with fear, Bonnie and Tom run toward Bush.
BONNIE
Stop it!! Get away!
Gary, the Worker burst from the diner but see the brake
handle in Bush's hand and slow down.
Bush comes to himself, sees everyone staring, sees Carl in
tears, and now Tom and Bonnie, trying to get him away..
Gary and the others slowly move toward Bush. More patrons
step out from the diner.
Buddy races up, sees Mule bleeding, and eyes Bush as he grabs
the reins and leads Mule down Main street, still holding the
brake handle.
CARL
(GASPING)
I'll kill him!
Bonnie shushes him softly as Carl moans in pain.
Tom stares after Bush, mirroring his father's hatred.

22 OMITTED 22
The Quinn Funeral Home Packard Hearse makes it way down the
road. Frank drives as Buddy searches ahead.
FRANK
How much did he have?
BUDDY
It was all wadded up.
FRANK
Ooo, hermit money. That's good.
Buddy sees Bush's signs.
BUDDY
There it is..
They stop at Bush's sign: 'No Damn Trespassing." Frank
squints up at the old shack and doesn't like what he sees at
all. Buddy opens his door but Frank doesn't.
BUDDY
What are you doing?
FRANK
You've been wanting a shot at
sales..
BUDDY
But..
FRANK
As of right now, you're on
commission.
(off Buddy's look)
Remember; foot in the door,
establish trust, and drop the
hammer.
Buddy hesitates, crawls out, and eyes the shack.
BUDDY
I'd feel better if you'd go too.
15.
FRANK
No doubt but if you don't do this
by yourself, you won't know if
you're any good. And you'll never
be any good if you don't know you
are. Go get him!
As Buddy uneasily approaches the shack, he feels the
beautiful stillness and mystery of the place. He KNOCKS
timidly on the door, pressing an ear to listen.
BUDDY
Hello?
Nothing. He shoots a look back to the hearse - miles away,
and knocks a little louder. Nothing. He inches to the window
and peeks in one of the remaining glass panes then starts to
slide away..
CLICK.
Buddy spins and discovers Bush standing on the ground behind
him, his shotgun barrel pointed between Buddy's eyes.
BUSH
Want to see in my house, do you?
BOOM! Bush blows away several windowpanes and re-aims at
Buddy's head.
BUSH
How's it look?
Buddy closes his eyes, his last words are for his wife..
BUDDY
Oh, Katie..
It makes Bush peek out from behind the barrel.
BUS H
You was at the church with your
wife and baby.
Buddy opens his eyes and can't believe he is still alive.
BUDDY
Yes, sir.
16.
BUSH
What the hell you doing here?
BUDDY
I can't remember.
BUSH
What?
They stand there while Buddy thinks..
BUDDY
Oh yeah, I heard.. you wanted a
funeral.
BUSH
Funeral?
BUSH
Yes sir. I work at uh.. I work at..
(tries to think of it)
.Quinn Funeral Home. I thought I
could help you.
Bush glances at his blown out window: 'Damn'. He lowers his
gun, walks up onto the porch.
BUS H
You like rabbit?
BUDDY
What?
Bush goes inside.
Buddy looks desperately back at the hearse but can't see
Frank. He doesn't know whether to run for it or not.
Buddy heads to the hearse, glancing back over his shoulder.
As he recalls his encounter, he stops, looking back at the
shack. The old legend has gotten deep under his skin.
20.
35 OMITTED 35
The morning sun breaks over the mountains.
Bush is on the porch, straining boiled herbs, grass, and bark
into a jar. There is something not right with him and he
knows it. While the medicine cools he looks out across the
mountain and draws a deep breath.
A well crafted live-in home doubling as a funeral parlor. A
sign, 'QUINN FUNERAL HOME', hangs from the porch.
FRANK (O.S.)
Oh yes Ma'am, I do respect your
wishes but you see..
Buddy swings the door open. Bush is standing there. Buddy
leans back unconsciously, not knowing what to expect.
FRANK (O.S.)
Well just for argument's sake,
Ma'am, how would we get the casket
under the house? No casket?
BUDDY
(TO BUSH)
Would you like to come in, sir?
21.
Bush stares suspiciously into the room then back at Buddy.
FRANK (O.S.)
But you have to have a container of
some kind, Ma'am for decency and
uh, sanitation.
Bush enters the Funeral Home. As Buddy starts to close the
door, Bush catches it.
BUSH
Leave it.
As Bush starts out the open door, he nearly bumps into
Buddy's wife, Kathryn, and MATTIE DARROW. Mattie is carrying
Kathryn and Buddy's baby boy.
Frank sees Mattie and flicks his hair back nervously and
quickly brushes his teeth with his finger as..
.Bush gives Mattie a glance and tries to be invisible.
MATTIE
Felix?!
Feigning deafness, Bush walks on. Sensing something, Kathryn
takes the baby so Mattie can go after him.
MATTIE
Felix! Say hello to me!
Frank, eyes wide with surprise, mouths, "Felix?".
Bush's shoulder hunch then fall as he turns. He looks into
her, taking everything in. When he speaks his eyes and voice
are soft.
BUSH
Hey Mattie.
Buddy comes out, surprised to see Mattie and Bush together.
Frank walks up behind him and scowls. Kathryn steers them
back inside to give Mattie privacy.
BUSH
Heard you moved off.
MATTIE
I've been back a while.
BUSH
(LOOKING AWAY)
Well.
26.
MATTIE
How are you?
BUSH
You look like you always did.
He abruptly rips himself away and is gone.
Kathryn rocks the baby in a carriage. Mattie is beside her.
MATTIE
A thousand years ago he was the
most interesting man I'd ever met.
KATHRYN
Get out of here.
MATTIE
He was. And I don't mean just the
way he looked.
KATHRYN
I hope not.
MATTIE
Oh no, listen, he was beautiful.
KATHRYN
Are you serious?
MATTIE
(SIGHS/THINKS)
Most people are just laid out nice
and simple, you know? You always
know what they're thinking and
where you are with them. But he was
this.. big old cave that went
deeper and deeper. You'd never get
to the end of him.
KATHRYN
Good Lord, you had a crush on him!
MATTIE
All the girls did. I know he's
something wild that crawls out of
the hills once in a while and gets
into trouble now but there's still
nobody like him.
28.
Bush comes out of the barn. Frank and Buddy are there.
FRANK
We have a plan. All we need is a
little bit of your time.
BUSH
What for?
BUDDY
Seeing it is better than hearing
about it.
Bush looks at the hearse, back at Buddy and Frank.
BUSH
How much is it gonna cost?
FRANK
(TO BUDDY)
Did you say anything about money?
(touches his own chest)
I didn't say anything about money.
(TO BUSH)
If we can't get you what you want
you don't owe us anything.
The hearse pulls up on main street. Frank, Buddy, and Bush
get out and head toward Feldman's Clothing Store.
Mattie is standing on the sidewalk at Feldman's store with
her coat collar pulled up against the cold, giving someone we
can't see a bemused affectionate scolding..
MATTIE
Good Lord. Have you completely lost
your mind?
(MORE)
40A.
MATTIE (cont`d)
Straighten up for heaven's sake
before somebody throws a net over
you!
But she smiles in spite of herself, glances around to see if
anyone was watching and moves discretely on. As she does we
see that she was talking to a striking WANTED POSTER of a
wild man sitting in front of a pond, a swan, and a bridge.
The text reads:
41.
MYSTERIOUS HERMIT OF CALEB COUNTY THROWS A FUNERAL PARTY!
EVERYONE IS INVITED. MUSIC! FOOD! STORIES! DANCING!
Bush starts out of the barn, draws back, and peeks through
the wall boards: A FIGURE approaches. He jerks..
REVEAL Mattie walking
BUSH
Mattie?
MATTIE
Felix?
Mattie enters, straining to see into the barn. Her eyes
adjust to find him standing near Mule. She is startled and
pleased by his new do.
MATTIE
Look at you. I wondered if you were
still under that beard.
BUSH
Wasn't nowhere else to go.
MATTIE
I heard you on the radio.
BUSH
Well.
MATTIE
You've gotten downright chatty.
BUSH
I reckon so.
MATTIE
(GLANCING AROUND)
This is nice. I drove by a few
times after I got back but..
BUSH
You want to see it?
46.
MATTIE
Do you want me to?
The first stop on the tour is a small fenced grave site near
the shack. Three grave markers with names carved into them:
KEEPER, CHARLIE, MAUDE.
Bush is squatting down staring at the markers. Mattie stands
close beside him. Since his attention is elsewhere she looks
at him in an unguarded way. Her mind is full of questions,
old and new.
BUSH
You always know where you stand
with a dog. Want to lay here with
them someday if they'll have me.
Mattie and Bush walks side by side through the last of the
glimmering light and shadows beneath the trees. It is a
chilly and Mattie's cheeks are flushed. She is enchanted by
the place. Bush tries to hide how winded he is..
MATTIE
It really is beautiful. Probably
looked like this everywhere a
hundred years ago.
BUSH
You leave things alone, they know
what to do.
MATTIE
Like you?
BUSH
No, Ma'am. I don't know what to do
about anything much.
MATTIE
You've been alone a long time.
BUSH
Some people are more suited to it
than others, I reckon.
46A.
MATTIE
That's funny cause I never thought
that it'd suit you. I knew you
wouldn't be like anybody else but..
no one to talk to, no one to.. be
with.. never.
He looks into her then looks away at something.
BUSH
How you sleeping these days, girl?
MATTIE
How am I what?
47.
BUSH
You sleep good?
MATTIE
No, not lately. How'd you know?
He veers off the path and pulls up a plant and brings it back
to her.
BUSH
Chamomile, it's good when the
nights get long. Helps you nod off.
She takes it and smiles up at him.
BUSH
Want to go on a ways?
MATTIE
Yes.
BUSH
Would you stay for supper?
MATTIE
I don't want to be any trouble.
BUSH
A supper guest every 30-40 years is
not much trouble, Girl.
MATTIE
Alright then.
He holds out his arm.
BUSH
Better stay close, some big old
wild cats been eating my chickens..
She looks around and takes his arm.
BUSH
.or maybe it was me..
She snorts and slaps his arm but doesn't let go..
73 OMITTED 73
48.
The hearse slips around the narrow road that cuts through
miles of farm land lying fallow in the winter.
Frank is at Mattie's door entranced by the troubled but
beautiful piano music coming from inside. It stops abruptly
when he knocks. In seconds, Mattie appears.
FRANK
Hey Mattie.
He looks almost boyish and bashful as he drinks her in.
FRANK
Was that you? It was really..
MATTIE
This is a surprise.
FRANK
Yeah, sorry.
He stands, loving the view, forgetting why he is here.
She waits it out as long as she can, not sure how she feels
about this adoring look.
MATTIE
Was there something you..?
FRANK
Uh, yeah.. Help!
MATTIE
What?
FRANK
I'm up to my ears with this funeral
and I thought, you know, we haven't
had time to talk much lately so
maybe you'd like to come over and
rip open envelopes with me and
MATTIE
I'm sorry, I have lessons all
afternoon. I have to get back in.
FRANK
Oh, okay, I just..
MATTIE
Sorry.
She slips back inside. Frank stares at the door.
58.
The hearse is parked in front of a beautiful white board
church.
The hearse creeps down the road
Under the trees crooked rows of cold ghostly headstones
glisten in the darkness. An old pocket lighter flares to
reveal Bush staring at a pot of yellow flowers. He holds the
lighter to a tombstone and brushes away the debris. It reads:
MARY LEE STROUP B. 1874 D. 1894. THUNDER rolls.
Close on Bush's face as rain begins to fall..
BUSH
They keep talking about
forgiveness.. ask Jesus for
forgiveness.. I never did nothing
to Him..
66.
103 OMIT 103/104/105 103
Mattie pulls the door open. Bush is standing there soaking
wet, breathing hard, holding his shotgun. She draws back
reflexively. He looks into her.
BUSH
Please, Ma'am.
Mattie is on her knees trying to plant bulbs in the hard cold
ground. Her trowel barely gouges the earth. She stabs it
again and again into the ground.
MATTIE
Fool, it's too late for bulbs..
75.
Suddenly she hurls the trowel as far as she can, then a
handful of bulbs.. then her hat.
MATTIE
.too goddamn late..
The hearse sits on the side of the road. Road signs give the
mileage to different destinations.
Frank, Buddy, and Charlie are on the porch, watching the
world come to life. Charlie looks as if he is hoping for some
kind of sign from above.
BUDDY
I'm glad you decided to come, sir.
CHARLIE
Free will is not all that it's
cracked up to be.
BUDDY
(AT FRANK)
Did you take the money out of the
casket?
FRANK
Yeah.
BUDDY
Why didn't you tell me?!
FRANK
I forgot.
BUDDY
You forgot?! Where is it?
FRANK
In the hearse, under the
floorboards.
Charlie remembers that Frank said he wasn't coming back and
gives him a look. Buddy is giving Frank the same look.
FRANK
What? Nobody steals a hearse. Now
all we got to do is take the
Reverend here to Bush and..
BUDDY
I forgot to tell you, Mr. Bush
already said he would do it.
FRANK
You're shittin' me?!
Charlie gets up and starts walking away..

CHARLIE
Where can I catch a train?
FRANK
You can't leave you just got here.
CHARLIE
Watch and learn.
FRANK
Hold on..
CHARLIE
Where's the station?
133 EXT - BUSH'S LAND/ROAD - MORNING 133
A tractor pulling a trailer with a big old honking generator
on it, a truck loaded with equipment and workers for the big
event rumbles down a dirt road. The Quinn Funeral home hearse
completes the unlikely parade.
Horton hold the car door open for Kathryn who is holding the
baby and looking back puzzled at Mattie's house. Finally she
sighs and gets into the car.
At the top of a wide clearing, a truck with a Circus Ad on
the door is being set up to become a stage.
The tractor and truck pull into the clearing and drive to the
circus truck.
The hearse pulls in and parks. Frank, Buddy, and Charlie
climb out of the hearse, look around, and stand frozen.
84.
Trucks and cars are parked everywhere around the big
clearing! Many PEOPLE have been here all night with fires,
tents and lean-tos. Many MORE PEOPLE are arriving now.
CHARLIE
Expecting a crowd?
Frank and Buddy give each other a look.
FRANK
Honestly? We don't have a clue
about what's going to happen here.
SET-UP SEQUENCE:
The big old honking generator is unloaded. Holes are dug. 10
foot poles are slid from the truck and huge speaker horns are
attached. Speaker poles are pulled up and set into holes.
Frank directs a gang of 6 KIDS who are selling raffle tickets
making sure they know that he has his eyes on them.
A BAND arrives on the back of pick-up truck.
The Generator kicks on belching smoke everywhere. Frank is
yelling Whoa Whoa! Disaster in the making.

Carl tucks an old 45 in the back of his pants. Gary and
Theman grab three gas cans off the truck, give one to Carl,
and clamber down a deep gully and start up the other side.
Tom peeks out from behind the big garbage barrels.
The generator is working! And standing on the flat bed truck,
which is now a stage, an ANNOUNCER introduces a hot blue
grass group The crowd is huge now and listens as the group
kicks off a song.
Behind the stage Frank is collecting money from the boys who
are selling the raffle tickets, making them turn their
pockets inside out. The generator makes a strange noise,
Frank eyeballs it, and it labors on.
Buddy walks up, nudges Frank, and nods out at the huge crowd.
Can you believe this?! Charlie walks up and says something
that we cannot hear.
Carl, Gary, and Theman hide and watch Frank, Buddy and
Charlie walk Mule and the wagon away from the barn and down
the road. Carl eyes Bush's shack and starts for it.
GARY
Hey, hey, where you going? He said

The bluegrass fiddle player nods to the others to quickly end
the song. Now we see why. Frank, Buddy, and Charlie have
brought the wagon with the coffin into the field. Everyone
quiets, remembering why they are here. They park the wagon
behind the hearse.
Frank and Charlie walk toward the stage. Buddy peels away.
Frank calls after him to come with them to the stage but
Buddy waves them away. He wants no part of that. He sees
Kathryn and Horton threading their way through the crowd and
moves toward them instead.
Frank and Charlie climb the makeshift stairs up to the stage.
Charlie sits down on a folding chair while Frank goes to the
big microphone and stares with satisfaction at the huge
Depression-era Woodstock crowd.
FRANK
Good afternoon ladies and
gentlemen. I'm Frank Quinn of Quinn
Funeral Home. Welcome to the live
funeral party of Mr. Felix Bush!
People don't know whether to clap or not. Some do and the
rest of them pick it up.
Buddy gets to Kathryn and hugs her and the baby.
BUDDY
Where's Mattie?

Frank finds Buddy in the crowd.
FRANK
The person who made all of this
happen for us doesn't like the
spotlight but Buddy Robinson is the
heart of Quinn Funeral Home and I'm
proud to know him.
Buddy is embarrassed and moved. Kathryn's eyes soften.
Carl is sloshing gasoline onto the back porch while Gary and
Theman keep nervous watch at the farendof porch. Suddenly
Carl feels a shotgun's cold metal on his neck and the 45
being ripped from his belt and thrown to the ground.
BUSH
Sonsabitches.
Carl drops his can. The other men drop their cans but Gary
starts to pull a pistol from his back pocket.
BUSH
Go on, I'll paint the porch with
his head.
CARL
Don't do it!
Gary drops the pistol.
BUSH
Now pick up them cans and keep
pouring.
CARL
What?

BUSH
You heard me.
The men cautiously pick up the cans..
BUSH
Pour it on your head. All of it.
The men look at each other. Bush cocks the other barrel of
his shotgun.
THEMAN
I won't!
BUSH
Pour it or die, I don't care which.
The men hoist the cans and start to pour the gasoline over
them. Burning and spitting they empty the cans. Suddenly
Theman bolts, moaning and running blind with gas in his eyes.
BUSH
I got two barrels, anybody else
wants to rabbit, now's the time.
FRANK
I know many of you have heard
stories about Mr. Bush. But today
I've been told that we're going to
hear another kind of story, his.
A murmuring moves in a wave across the crowd as they see..
.Bush enters the field with his shotgun pointed at Carl and
Gary's backs. They are drenched with gas and it is burning
them through their clothes.
Buddy, Kathryn, and Horton see Bush.
Quinn and Charlie follow the crowd's eyes to Bush.
QUINN
Holy Mother of..
SHERIFF DEPUTIES beside the stage see Bush.
But everyone remains frozen, not knowing what has happened or
what to do now. Is this the crazy Bush of the legends?

Buddy starts toward Bush. Kathryn tries to stop him but he
pulls free and walks slowly toward Bush.
A shot rings out!

Carl and Gary hit the ground like dead men.
The crowd hunkers and scatters.
Horton steps in front of Kathryn and the baby. Buddy freezes.
Charlie rushes up beside Frank at the microphone.
Carl rolls up and turns to Bush and sees blood seeping out
onto his shirt beneath his coat.
Bush whirls and sees..
.Carl's old 45 still smoking.
The gun is in Tom's small shaking hands..
CARL
Don't hurt him! It's my fault.
PLEASE, PLEASE..
Bush cracks his shotgun, walks slowly to the boy, gently
takes the 45, empties the shells, and hands the gun back.
BUSH
A second chance is a precious
thing, son. Don't waste it.
The boy plops down, overwhelmed.
And suddenly everyone is in motion.
The Deputies run toward Bush. Frank and Charlie rush from the
stage. Kathryn and Horton are going.
Buddy arrives at Bush first and sees the blood weeping onto
his shirt.
BUDDY
Are you alright, sir?!
Without turning Bush glances at the Deputies.
BUSH
Tried to burn me out. Let the boy
be, he didn't mean nothing.
As the Deputies get a hold of Carl and Gary, Frank, Charlie,
Kathryn and Horton arrive. Carl looks at Horton with pleading
eyes and nods to Tom.
CARL
Help him, Gus, please..
91.
Horton goes to the trembling boy and picks him up.
Bush suddenly walks into the trees without looking back.
Everyone is standing around in shock.
Kathryn waits anxiously near the porch with the baby.
Horton steps up to the microphone. The shocked crowd turns to
him. He closes his eyes and bows his head.
REVEREND HORTON
Lord, you say you move in
mysterious ways and we believe you
because we don't understand much of
anything. And so we come to you
today not seeking answers to what's
happened here but asking you to
help us open our hearts a little
more to each other and find some
forgiveness and understanding.
The bluegrass band sings a good hymn. The crowd is still
stunned and talking, not knowing what to do.
Charlie, Bush walk through the murmuring parting crowd toward
the stage. Frank and Buddy are close behind. Buddy is looking
for Kathryn. She spots him and moves toward the stage.
Bush and Charlie go up the steps to the stage.
At the last second, Bush stares at the big microphone and
stops, unable to go on.
Charlie gives him a look then goes on up to the microphone
and looks out a the sea of white folks.
CHARLIE
I'm Reverend Charlie Jackson. Felix
wants to continue with his funeral.
And he's asked me to say a few
words.
Just below the stage, Buddy and Frank are joined by Kathryn.
Charlie glances back at Bush, turns inward, searching for the
words. Finally he holds his hands out, wide apart.
CHARLIE
We like to imagine that good and
bad, right and wrong, are miles
apart. But the truth is, very often
they're..
(brings his hand together
and laces his fingers
TIGHTLY)
.all tangled up with each other.
Bush raises his head and looks at Charlie's back.
CHARLIE
Some 40 years ago Felix Bush
dropped into my life and then
dropped out. In between he built
the most beautiful sanctuary that
I've ever seen. A lot of wonderful
things happened in that church.
Suddenly Bush breaks away, moves up beside Charlie, and puts
his hand on his shoulder.
95.
BUSH
Thank you, Charlie. Thank you.
Charlie gives him a long look then steps away from the
microphone and moves back to where Bush was standing.
Bush stares at the microphone, takes a breath, and walks up
to it, and looks out over the huge crowd.
BUSH
Had to go clear to Illinois to find
somebody that had anything good to
say about me. Hell of a thing.
His voice booms out over the crowd, startling him. He looks
down, sees Buddy, Kathryn, Frank and Horton.
He looks closer for someone most important but she is not
there. The crowd murmurs. Finally..
BUSH
I'm not a smart man or a wise one.
I don't know what kind of man I am.
I was always restless, thought I'd
see the world. But I didn't hardly
go nowhere.. on purpose..
(BEAT)
Because.. because I did something
that I was ashamed of. Something I
couldn't ever fix.
(GLANCES AROUND)
Ya'll probably think you know what
you'd do or what you wouldn't. And
I wish you good luck with that. I
really do.
(BEAT)
When I told Charlie what I'd done,
he told me to confess to God and
the law and to.. to someone else..
so I could get forgiveness. But I
didn't want forgiveness.
(BEAT)
I needed to hold on to what I did..
to be sick from it every day of my
life. So I never told nobody else.
He stops, not knowing how to go on. The crowd has quieted
completely.
As as his eyes sweep over the sea of expectant faces, he
suddenly SEES HER coming through the crowd.
96.
Mattie's here. Seeing that Felix appears to alright, her face
changes from conflicted concern to open unbridled hatred.
The look takes Bush's breath away. But he suddenly seems to
accept it as his due and when he talks, it is only to her.
BUSH
I fell in love with a married lady.
And somehow she fell in love with
me. It was the only time that I
have been in love.
(GATHERS HIMSELF)
We made a plan to run off and start
a new life but she didn't show up
at the time that we said we'd meet.
I got a funny feeling and I went to
her house.
Buddy, Kathryn and Frank all see Mattie now, see Bush talking
just to her.
BUSH
Her husband answered the door.
(BEAT)
He had blood on him.
For Mattie all of this is like window into the past being
suddenly thrown open and she is haunted and mesmerized.
BUSH
I hit him pretty hard, knocked him
down. Can't remember going upstairs
but I remember I saw a hammer on
the steps and it had blood and hair
on it.
The crowd gasps. Mattie is trembling.
BUSH
I found her in the bedroom. She was
crawling across the floor.
(BEAT)
But before I could get to her and
help her up.. a kerosene lamp hit
the wall. And then her husband
jumped on my back. Funny what
happens sometimes when things go
wrong. It's like the clock stops
and you have all the time in the
world to think. I could see that
her husband had set the downstairs
on fire before he came up.
(BEAT)
(MORE)
97.
BUSH (CONT'D)
And as I was slamming his head into
the wall, trying to get shed of
him, I could see clear as anything
that it was all my fault. If I'd
just never spoke to her..
(BEAT)
And as I was thinking about that, I
saw that the lamp he threw had set
the room we were in on fire too.
Bush forces himself to keep looking into Mattie.
BUSH
And then I realized that I was on
fire. I tried to put myself out but
I couldn't, everything was..
(BEAT)
I dropped him, turned around and
saw her lying on the floor and
called her name. She looked up at
me..
(BEAT)
.and the next thing I knew, I was
flying..
A loud roar of fire and crushing timbers..
A man on fire bursts through the second story window of a
burning house. He lands hard and rolls across the yard to
smother the flames.
With his clothes still smoking, he unbelievably tries to run
back into the hell. But the fire is too hot and he cannot. He
screams like a mad man and runs into the trees..
The crowd is motionless. Nothing is moving. It is as if the
whole world has stopped. Frank, Buddy, and Kathryn are
frozen.
Bush and Mattie are looking into each other, one anguished
soul to another.
BUSH
I don't know how I got out the
window.
(BEAT)
(MORE)
98.
BUSH (CONT'D)
No matter how many times I play it
in my mind, I can't remember
jumping. I thought I killed him,
but maybe he pushed me, I don't
know...
(lost as ever..)
I swear to you, if I left her in
there.. everything I know about
myself is a lie. But that don't
matter.
(BEAT)
I didn't get her out, Little Bit, I
didn't. I'm sorry.
A MAN chooses a winning raffle ticket from a wire cage.
A poor YOUNG COUPLE with SEVERAL CHILDREN win the raffle! The
promise of a new and better life begins for them.
The big funeral party breaks up people wind their way home.
The big old honking generator coughs off.
Mule is lead back to the barn.
The equipment is disassembled and loaded back on the truck.
The microphone stands alone on the stage. He got it said.
Buddy, Frank, Horton, Charlie, and Kathryn and the baby wait
outside, giving Bush and Mattie time. Buddy takes the baby
and holds it close.
99.
Finally Mattie and Bush come out of the shack and walk down
to the others. No one knows what to say. Finally..
BUDDY
How you doing, sir?
BUSH
Just fair, son.
HORTON
Carl said Ray paid them to set the
fire. Paid them to break into the
funeral home too.
FRANK
Can't stop pulling Aces out of his
ass, can he?
HORTON
Spend his money on lawyers now. You
know how thrifty they are.
Frank motions to Buddy and they go to Bush. Buddy is still
holding the baby, Bush looks tenderly at Buddy and the baby.
BUSH
What's his name?
BUDDY
Larry, Lawrence, after my dad, sir.
BUSH
He ain't gonna throw rocks at me,
is he?
BUDDY
Not if knows what's good for him.
BUSH
You boys did good. Real good.
Let's settle up.
BUDDY
We don't have to do that now. You
get some rest.
FRANK
(a look/ then)
Yeah. We'll come out tomorrow.
BUSH
Bring my shirt back, I just got it
broke in.
100.
Bush pulls Buddy aside. Frank stares over at them but can't
hear what they are saying. He moves over beside Mattie.
FRANK
Are you alright, Mattie?
She looks up at Frank for a long moment, her face softening.
MATTIE
Oh, I don't know. I'm still moving,
I guess..
He doesn't know what that means but she has finally really
looked at him and that's something he'll hold onto.
Kathryn comes and hugs Mattie as.. Bush and Buddy come back.
Bush goes to Charlie.
Frank is staring at Buddy, looking for a clue as to what Bush
said. Buddy gives him nothing,
BUSH
Thanks again for coming, Charlie.
CHARLIE
I'm proud of you.
(MEANING IT)
Thank you for my church.
BUSH
Did you ever get my bill?
HORTON
Can we get a ride our car's about 2
miles down the road.
Everyone piles into the hearse. There is no back seat so they
all have to crawl in the back door and sit along the sides.
It makes everyone smile. Mattie gives Bush one last fleeting
embrace then climbs in. Bush looks in on them all for a long
moment all then closes the door.
As the hearse moves out, he waves to Buddy who is looking out
the back window. Buddy waves back.
BUSH
(TO HIMSELF)
Look at that. My funeral and
everybody's in there but me.
The hearse pulls onto the road and drives away.
101.
The place is suddenly quiet and beautiful. He looks down the
road through the fading dust and sees a WOMAN walking slowly
toward him. He squints, recognizes her, and his face fills
with a timeless love.
It's a cold day beneath the spreading pecan tree. Mule stands
hitched to the wagon. The three dog grave markers are
frosted.
A fourth grave marker just like the others leans against the
tree. It is freshly carved with: Felix Elijah Bush. A pot of
fresh yellow flowers sit beside the marker.
Bush's beautiful handmade casket is inside his grave.
Frank, Mattie, Charlie, Buddy, Kathryn, and Horton stand
beside the grave. Several MEN with shovels wait near the
tree. Charlie's eulogy is more of a one-sided conversation
which Bush would probably love.
CHARLIE
Well, Felix, this one's for real, I
guess. I didn't actually see them
put you in the box so..
Charlie glances over and notices "Charlie" on one of the
dog's grave markers. He snorts and shakes his head.
CHARLIE
Wherever you are, you're probably
giving someone a hard time or
something wonderful and priceless
just to confuse them. Not
everything can be figured out, nor
everybody. I wish you peace from
the burdens of your mind and heart.
I wish it for us all.
Mattie moves toward the edge of the grave. Frank puts a hand
out to catch her should she should stumble. She stares down
at the FB on the coffin, opens her hand, and lets the picture
of her sister drift down onto the coffin.
Everyone moves away as the men fill in the grave. Buddy and
Kathryn move up beside Frank and Mattie and Charlie. Buddy
tosses the ball of hermit money to Frank.
102.
BUDDY
A 50 on the outside, all ones
inside. Less than $100.
FRANK
What?!
CHARLIE
I told you. Nobody listens to the
preacher.
Buddy pulls some papers from his coat.
BUDDY
The day of the party he told me
about the will he had in the secret
drawer of his table. He left the
raffle money to all of us.
Everyone is shocked, touched.
BUDDY
(TO FRANK)
But you have to pay for Mule's
upkeep for the rest of his life.
Charlie grins and Buddy flaps the papers at him.
BUDDY
And he set up a fund for the
upkeep of your church.
CHARLIE
What's the catch?
BUDDY
No catch, sir.
CHARLIE
Still don't get it, do you? With
Felix, there's always a catch.
BUDDY
Maybe he just knew you'd go crazy
wondering what it was.
They all laugh and move down the hillside. As the laughter
fades we see in their faces the impact that Felix Bush has
had upon them. Buddy feels the comfort of this odd but
growing family and stops and looks back at the grave and the
pot of yellow flowers. His curiosity about the fearsome old
man has not abated. Nor will it ever.
