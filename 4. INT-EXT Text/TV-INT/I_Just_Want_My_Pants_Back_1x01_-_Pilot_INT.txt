      JASON STRIDER, good-looking but not in a traditional way, 
      wearing a  Bono Is No Fun  tee, lies on the couch in his 
      profoundly small NYC apartment, watching women s ice skating 
      on TV.  A scantily clad skater lands a jump.

                                  JASON
                    Yes, triple toe loop.

      His cell rings.

                                  JASON (CONT D)
                    Hello?  Where are you, it sounds 
                    like someone s sacrificing a 
                    chicken.  Home, watching basic 
                    cable.  No, I m not  touching it.   
                    I don t answer the phone when I m 
                      masturbating, unless I m at work.  

      The clock on the microwave reads 12:03. 

                                  JASON (CONT D)
                    A drink now?  Nah, I can t; I can t 
                    be late tomorrow. (EYEROLL) Yep, 
                    that s me, huge pussy.   K, bye. 

      He hangs up.  Sits back.  Sighs.  Music kicks in...



      And enters the cool dive.  He bellies up to the bar where a 
      fratty JERK harasses two girls, one BRUNETTE, one BLONDE.  

                                  JERK
                    So, what s the matter with you two?  

                                  BLONDE
                    You re the matter.                                                                                      2


                                  JERK
                    Do you like girls?  Is that it?  Do 
                    you like girls or do you like guys?

      Jason can t help himself.  

                                  JASON
                    Do you like robots?

      The girls laugh.  Brunette flashes him a  thank you  smile.  

                                  BRUNETTE
                    Yes, we re in love with our robots.  
                    So leave us alone. 

      Jerk is pissed.  You know this guy.  Fightin  guy.

                                  JERK
                    You re a fucking wiseass.

                                  JASON
                    Thanks. 

                                  JERK
                    Yeah, well how about making me?!

                                  JASON
                    Um, making you what?  Listen man, I 
                    don t want to fight.

      He tries to turn away, but Jerk shoves him into Blonde.  

                                  BLONDE
                    You okay?

                                  JASON
                    Yeah.  I haven t been in a fight 
                    since 6th grade, but I totally beat 
                    the crap out of that kid.  He was 
                    only in third grade, though.  

      Jerk glares; Jason, with no choice, balls his fists.  Before 
      the bullets fly a hipster GIRL, pretty, titty, pushes forward.

                                  GIRL
                    (TO JERK) Hey!  Next time you use 
                    the bathroom, try not to piss all 
                    over the seat!  Is it too small to 
                    aim, or do you just have the 
                    sprinkler attachment on? 

                                  JERK
                    I wasn t even in the bathroom.                                                                                      3


                                  GIRL
                    Yeah you were; that place looked 
                    like it was hit by acid rain. 

                                  JERK
                    Shut up, slut.

                                  GIRL
                    I am a slut; a huge one.  And yet I 
                    find you totally unappealing.  Bye.

      He exits, broken.  Girl turns to Jason; her tone to friendly.

                                  GIRL (CONT D)
                    What s up, Fatty?

                                  JASON
                    Comments like that are why I vomit 
                    myself to sleep.

                                  GIRL
                    It s not working.  (TO BARTENDER) 
                    Two shots of Jack and two Stellas. 

                                  JASON
                    I was so gonna kick his ass, Teen.

      Girl is TINA: Jason s best friend. 

                                  TINA
                    I know, I didn t want you to get 
                    sent to juvy.  Here -- To freedom. 

      She hands him a shot, and they do the clink and swallow.

                                  JASON
                    Ugh, that tasted like cough syrup 
                    and dirt.

                                  TINA
                    Mine was like intercourse and 
                    tears.

                                  JASON
                      I wouldn t know, I don t remember 
                    what sex tastes like.

                                  TINA
                    Like chicken.  How long s it been?

                                  JASON
                    Six weeks.                                                                                        4


                                  TINA
                    Wow, six whole weeks, you re like a 
                    castrato.  It s just a bad streak, 
                    Jay; you ve always been a streaker.  
                    Remember senior year, that weekend 
                    with whats-her-face from the dorm, 
                    the girl with the thing on her 
                    thing, Magnum P.I....

                                  JASON
                    Who?

                                  TINA
                    That chick with the lil  mustache.  

                                  JASON
                    Debbie Lee.  And being a streaker s 
                    what I m worried about.  Seriously.

                                  TINA
                    (BEAT)  Got any weed?



      They ping-pong a one-hitter in the ironic-grafitti-filled can. 

                                  JASON
                    I m just saying, this lil dry spell 
                    could easily turn into the drought 
                    of the decade.  Something s off.  I 
                    feel a disturbance in The Force.

                                  TINA
                    Maybe if you stop with the Star 
                    Wars references.  Here, I m high. 

                                  JASON
                    Me too;  I could eat a wheel of 
                    cheese  high.  We should start a 
                    band  high.

                                  TINA
                    As long as you re not  I need you 
                    to check my testicles for lumps  
                    high again.  C mon, being in here 
                    makes me have to poop.



      Back at the bar.  Tina s finishing a text.                                                                                       5


                                  TINA
                    That was Brett; I might go let him 
                    give me a foot massage.  By foot 
                    massage I mean have sex, I just 
                    said foot massage so you don t feel 
                    bad about being a born again 
                    virgin. Go talk to those girls you 
                    saved; they owe you.

                                  JASON
                    What s chivalry worth these days?  

                                  TINA
                    They should clean you like cats.  
                    Just be funny.  Funny to girls is 
                    like boobs to boys.  

      Tina starts to leave.  

                                  TINA (CONT D)
                    Oh hey, you want to chip in for a 
                    present for Stacey?  We should get 
                    her something nice, she s pretty 
                    freaked about the big 2-5. 

                                  JASON
                    I was just gonna get her something 
                    goofy, like a lottery ticket.

                                  TINA
                    Yeah, dollar and a dream s not 
                    gonna cut it Shylock; it s a big 
                    deal to her.   K, Smell you later.

      She splits.  He approaches the Brunette, who now sits alone.  
      She s so cute it hurts. 

                                  JASON
                    Hi.  I m Jason.

                                  BRUNETTE
                    Jane.  Thanks for before, I thought 
                    I was gonna have to use my mace.

                                  JASON
                    That would ve been embarrassing for 
                    you, I mean, it s all about Tasers 
                    now -- mace is sooo over.  It s 
                    like toe rings, or fedoras.

                                  JANE
                    Or glaciers, or marine life in the 
                    Gulf.                                                                                      6


                                  JASON
                    Whoa, you re a little dark there.  

                                  JANE
                      (DEEPENING HER VOICE)   I m a 
                    loner, Dottie.  A rebel... 

                                  JASON
                      (IMPRESSED) Pee Wee s Big 
                      Adventure.  Best movie starring a 
                    sex offender, ever.

                                  JANE
                    Arguably.  I mean, Ferris Bueller?  
                    So what do you do when you re not 
                    being a bar hero?  

                                  JASON
                    I work at this, uh... I drive 
                    NASCAR.  Daytona, Talle...dega.... 

                                  JANE
                    Oh my God, are you Danica Patrick? 

                                  JASON
                    No, but... same cheekbones.

                                  JANE
                    Same boobs, too.

      She flashes a beautiful smile.

                                  JASON
                    You re really funny.

                                  JANE
                    So are you.  Shall we continue 
                    being funny over another drink?

                                  JASON
                    Indeed we shall.



      Jason and Jane are in the impossibly cramped kitchen, 
      struggling to make out in the small space.  

                                  JANE
                    Help me get my shirt off and I ll 
                    help you with your jeans.

                                  JASON
                    Deal.                                                                                      7


      He pulls her shirt off.  As she works to tug down his pants:

                                  JASON (CONT D)
                    This is too perfect.  What if 
                    you re scamming me so you can steal 
                    my Discover Card in the middle of 
                    the night?  What if you re really a 
                    sexy transsexual, and later I find, 
                    oops, you have a penis?  That s 
                    always been a secret fear of mine.

                                  JANE
                    (STANDING BACK UP) You re babbling.

      They lip-lock some more, but it s too crowded to consummate.

                                  JASON
                    You know, I do have a bed...

      She rips open the fridge door, and grins, devilishly.  

                                  JANE
                    Fuck me in your fridge. 

      She leans in; the door blocks our view.  Really?

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    (MUFFLED, IN FRIDGE) C mon fuck me!  

      Really.  CLOSE-UP of Jason s face.  Grin = Shit-eating.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Hurry, it smells in here!

                                  JASON
                    (TO SELF)  What a fantastic e-mail 
                    this is going to make tomorrow.

      Old condiments rattle to the floor as they do the deed.



      Jane and Jason lie in bed.  She props herself on her elbow.

                                  JANE
                    So, do you think I m a slut?

                                  JASON
                    Only in the best most positive way.   

      He rolls to face her.  She s so cute it hurts.                                                                                      8


                                  JASON (CONT D)
                    I had, like, a really great time 
                    last night. But I have a confession 
                    to make.  I lied, I don t drive 
                    stock cars.

                                  JANE
                    I lied too; I m not really a woman.

                                  JASON
                      Technically you are; I didn t see 
                    any boy parts and I double-checked.

      They kiss, softly.  Then, she sees the clock.  9:00 AM.

                                  JANE
                    Shit!  I m so late! 

      She hops out of bed and grabs Jason s pants off the floor.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Is it okay if I borrow these?  I 
                    hate when my doorman sees me in the 
                    same clothes from the day before. 

                                  JASON
                    That happens a lot, huh? 

      Jane shrugs, slips on the pants, and wiggles her butt.  

                                  JASON (CONT D)
                    Can I get your number?  Or should I 
                    just stalk you?  I m sorta lazy, a 
                    number would work better.

      She writes it down on a scrap of paper and hands it to him.

                                  JANE
                    See you around, Jason.

      She exits.  He waits until her footsteps fade, then:

                                  JASON
                        Yessssssssssssssssssss!                                                                                        9



                                            ACT 1



      Still buttoning his shirt, Jason enters his local bodega and 
      grabs an OJ.  BOBBY, on a ladder, installs a security camera.  

                                  BOBBY
                    Hey, how are you boss?

                                  JASON
                    I feel like a thousand dollars.  
                    Which is nine hundred more than I 
                    have in my checking account, but 
                    anyway, I feel great.  What s that?

                                  BOBBY
                    New security.  No one will be 
                    robbed or murdered in this store.

                                  JASON
                    You should put that on the door.  
                    How do you know how to do that?

      Bobby climbs down and runs the wires toward a monitor.

                                  BOBBY
                    Back home, I worked at video 
                    business.  I had beautiful 
                      girlfriend there, but we break up 
                    when I move here. (SIGHS) It is 
                    hard for man to be alone, Jason.

                                  JASON
                    Here we say, no man is an island.

      He empties a pocketful of change on the counter for the juice.

                                  BOBBY
                    In my country it s "Bhaj na machaa 
                    na.   An ugly girl blames mirror.

                                  JASON
                    That s not really the same thing.

      Bobby separates lint from Jason s nickels and dimes as the 
      door swings open.  Tina, in last night s outfit, enters in 
      glorious, hungover, post-coital disarray.  A beat.  Then:

                                  TINA
                    I need an egg sandwich and I need 
                    it now.                                                                                    10


                                  JASON
                    You need a gallon of antibacterial 
                    soap and a Silkwood shower.

                                  BOBBY
                    You need pregnancy test.

                                  TINA
                    Don t toy with me.  I m fragile.

                                  BOBBY
                    Sorry, whore friend of Jason.  

      He walks off to make the egg-wich.

                                  TINA
                    He never remembers my name.

                                  JASON
                    So, you had fun with Brett, eh?  

      She grabs the juice from him, opens it, and drinks deeply.

                                  TINA
                    Let s just say I introduced him to 
                    God.  You?  What happened?

                                  JASON
                    IT happened. The dry spell is over!  
                    I had sex with that girl last night 
                    in my fucking refrigerator!

                                  TINA
                    I did that once but the sex was bad 
                    so I ate half a pizza.  Congrats 
                    Jay, you re back.

                                  JASON
                    I am back.  I feel stronger and 
                    more confident, like those guys in 
                    the hair transplant commercials.  
                    You d really like this girl, Teen.  
                    I mean, I really like this girl.  
                    She s cute and funny and... 
                      surprisingly filthy.

                                  TINA
                    These are a few of your favorite 
                    things.  

                                  JASON
                    I know this sounds goofy, but... 
                    she was pretty perfect.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    11

                                  JASON (CONT'D)
                    And I played it totally cool; I was 
                    like a young James Van Der Beek.  

                                  TINA
                    That s your gold standard?  Well, 
                    good for you, Dawson.  Hear hear.

      She takes another long slug of juice.

                                  TINA (CONT D)
                    Hey, let me ask you a question.  So 
                    I was looking through Brett s 
                    wallet this morning...

                                  JASON
                    You fished through his wallet?

                                  TINA
                      (SHRUGGING)  He fished through my 
                      ladypurse. (SHE PULLS OUT A BLUE 
                    CARD) Would you ever carry a frozen 
                    yogurt frequent eater card?

                                  JASON
                    I gotta get to work, psycho.  

      He takes back the juice carton.  It s empty.



      Jason and a BLACK MALE EXEC ride together.  A MUZAK version of 
      Ebony and Ivory plays.  Jason looks at the Exec; they should 
      acknowledge this, right?  Yes?  No.  They ride in silence.



      The elevator opens into a shitty, rundown office; A dozen 
      LITTLE PEOPLE wait, reading magazines, on phones, etc.  JB, 
      late 30s, a multitude of issues, immediately comes up to him. 

                                  JB
                      (GESTURING TO THE CLOCK)  Let me 
                    guess, dentist appointment?

                                  JASON
                    Sorry.  I think I have sleep apnea. 
                    Web MD says I m a prime candidate. 

                                  JB
                    No problem, I m just gonna start 
                    docking your pay when you re late.                                                                                     12


                                  JASON
                    Really?

                                  JB
                    Yeah, really. It s not a democracy, 
                    Jay.  I am Pharaoh, you are Jew.  
                    Now go run the session in the back, 
                      everyone s waiting.

                                  JASON
                    You know, I m actually, Jewish, JB.

                                  JB
                    Great, Happy Chanukah.  Oh, also, 
                    the toilet s clogged.  Someone has 
                    some real psychological issues. 

      He hands him a plunger.

                                  JB (CONT D)
                    Clean it like you mean it. Like you 
                    know we re in a recession and I get 
                    emailed a lot of qualified resumes.



      Jason stands by a camera, eyeing a spec sheet.  A surly 3.5 
      foot Little Person, BRIAN, toes a tape mark on the floor.

                                  JASON
                    OK, you ll be playing, um... a 
                    piece of fruit.  This says they 
                    want to see you dance.

                                  BRIAN
                    How the fuck does fruit dance?

                                  JASON
                    I guess just try a bunch of stuff?  

      Jason hits play on a beat up, old school boombox.  Little 
      Brian sighs, then begins dancing: running man, cabbage patch, 
      robot.  It couldn t get more awkward.  Or could it?

                                  JASON (CONT D)
                    (READING SHEET) Oh, I also need to 
                    shoot close-ups of your limbs.



      Jason stares at Jane s number.  He pulls out his phone.                                                                                    13


                                  JASON
                      (REHEARSING) Hey Janey, it s Jason.  
                    Ugh, fucking nerd.  Hola, Jane.  
                    Como estas?  Jesus! (DEEP BREATHS)  
                    Van Der Beek.  Van Der Beek.

      Steadied, he dials the phone, and paces.  On the third ring...



      A bored THAI MAN answers.  INTERCUT.

                                  THAI MAN
                      Sawdeekrap.  Phukett Thai food.

                                  JASON
                    Is this, uh, 323-2627?

                                  THAI MAN
                    Yes, 323-2627.  

                                  JASON
                    Is... Jane there?  Does someone 
                    named Jane work there?

                                  THAI MAN
                    No Jane.  Thai food.

      Jason hangs up, flabbergasted.  He curses, and runs his 
      fingers through his hair.  Then... he dials again.

                                  THAI MAN (CONT D)
                      Sawdeekrap.  Phukett Thai food.

                                  JASON
                    Can I get delivery to 699 Grand, 
                    3A?  Large Pad Thai, dumplings and 
                    two lemongrass chicken.  Thanks.

      He hangs up and calls Tina.  



      Tina picks up a shirt, sniffs it, recoils, and stuffs it in a 
      laundry basket.  Her phone rings.  INTERCUT. 

                                  TINA
                      Moshi-moshi.

                                  JASON
                    I just ordered a crapload of Thai 
                    food.  Dinner s on me, come over.                                                                                    14


                                  TINA
                    Can t, I m in the middle of an epic 
                    laundry.  What s up? 

                                  JASON
                    Fridge girl stole my pants. 



      STACEY, ERIC and Tina sit at the table, drinking wine.  Jason 
      arrives with two bags of Thai food.

                                  JASON
                    (TO ERIC) Doctor, (TO STACEY) 
                    Lawyer, (EYEING TINA S CLOTHES) My 
                    color blind pal... Here, meet my 
                    new girlfriend. 

      He plops the food down.  Stacey starts to open the bag.

                                  STACEY
                    You ve introduced us to worse.

      Eric hands him a drink with an umbrella in it.

                                  ERIC
                    I made this special for you.  It s 
                    called a nocturnal emission.  

                                  TINA
                    How are you doing?  Do you have 
                      post-pants depression?  

                                  JASON
                    No, it s stupid, I just really 
                    thought she was into me.  I mean 
                    why did she even borrow my pants if 
                    she was just gonna blow me off?

                    No.  Maybe.  In my dream she also

                    It feels like someone else is about

                    Yeah.  Why?

                    Sorry.  Sounds fun, Stace.  So do 
                    you have tickets already?

                    Go there and reserve eight under my

                                  TINA
                    Reserve one for Brett, too.  He 
                    loves Sleigh Bells.

                                  JASON
                    You re bringing him?  I thought you 
                    just slept with the guy because he 
                    had air conditioning.

                    who thinks  irony  means something 
                    that tastes like metal, and who, 
                    after a few appletini s, will let

                     Popping your cherry  isn t an 
                    honor.  It s a bloody mess you have 
                    to hide by pretending your sheets 
                    caught fire when you and Scott 
                      Speilburger were working on a

      Lench s loft is filled with drunk hipsters and gypsters. It s

                    To an evening of loose morals and 
                      questionable choices.

                    made me do shots on the way here.

                    Gotta hand it to Lench, this is 
                    actually cool.                                                                                    22

                    It s a little crunchy.  Reminds me 
                    of Lilith Fair, with more boner 
                    wolves and less Sarah McLachlan.  

                                  TINA
                    You went to Lilith Fair?

                                  JASON
                    It was a dark time for me.  There s 
                    Lench.  Should we go say hi?

                                  TINA
                    Nah, he s busy molesting that 
                    hippie.  

      CUT ACROSS THE ROOM TO Lench, who s clenching a white GIRL 
      with dreadlocks.  He fingers her hair clumps, sensually.

                                  LENCH
                    Mmm... Is everything dreadlocked?  
                    No... let me be surprised. 

      CUT BACK to Jason and Tina.  She finishes her beer; he checks 
      his phone.

                                  JASON
                    Shit, it s almost ten already.  I 
                    should go get those tickets soon.

                    Wait.  Look: cute dorks.

      A MAN and WOMAN, attractive but dressed conservatively, stand 
      near the wine.  Tina waves.  Man returns it.

                    If we can t weather a minor 
                      indiscretion with a handsome dork, 
                    what chance do we have?  OK --  
                    shit s about to get real, esse.

      She turns and puts her arm around Spencer.

      They walk off.  Jason takes a quick look at his cell. 10:04.

                    No, no, there s just something I m 
                    supposed to be doing right now.  I 
                    should really go.

                    really hoping to do tonight, too.  
                    But I can t do it alone.  

      She smiles.  It s a smile that says,  I do bad things.   Jason 
      considers the clock on his phone, and then the dirty smile... 

                                  JASON
                    Yeah, my errand can wait until 
                    tomorrow.                                                                                      24




      A small crowd watches as Stacey and Eric are mid-rally, 
      playing Wii Tennis doubles.  Their nerdy opponents, in 
      matching sweatsuits, look like twins, except the guy s CHUNKY, 
      and the girl s a SIZE ZERO.  Nerd couple win the point.

                                  CHUNKY
                    (DWEEBILY RAISING ROOF)  What-what!

                                  STACEY
                    Where s your head, Eric?!  

                                  ERIC
                    Sorry, this controller sucks!

                                  CHUNKY
                    Game point!

                                  SIZE ZERO
                    (SONG TO HIS SING)  Your serve!

      Stacey grabs Eric by the shirt and pulls him in close.

                                  ERIC
                    Ow.  Hon...

                                  STACEY
                    We are not losing to  before  and 
                     after.   Do you copy?

                                  ERIC
                    Copy.  



      A few empty beer bottles sit on the floor; Jason and Jacoby go 
      at it on the bed.  Jacoby, sloppy drunk, stops, and sits up.

                                  JACOBY
                    I m not going to have sex with you. 
                    I don t just let guys stick their 
                    penises in me all willy nilly. OK?

                                  JASON
                    I d never stick my penis in you all 
                      willy-nilly.  

      She pulls off her top, and starts to tongue his neck.

                                  JASON (CONT D)
                    I respect your boundaries.                                                                                    25




      Meyers is fumbling awkwardly on top of Tina. 

                                  TINA
                    Ow!  Jesus, if you bite me one more 
                    time I m going to clock you.   

                                  MEYERS
                    (MOVES HER HAND) Feel my sword.

                                  TINA
                    Your sword?  Is it sharp?  (PUSHES 
                    HIM OFF) Listen, you seem nice; I 
                    dunno, maybe you plan to skin me to 
                    make a girl-suit, but either way, 
                    I m not going to your place.  I ve 
                    got an undefined thing with a poet 
                    slash chocolatier I don t want to 
                    ruin. But, if you pay for the cab, 
                    you re welcome to some taxi-
                    touching until you drop me off.

                                  MEYERS
                    C mon&

                                  TINA
                    Take the deal: otherwise a hand-
                    job's a man's job and you can get 
                    out at the light and mime a vagina.



      Jacoby's opening Jason s belt.  She looks back at him.

                                  JACOBY
                    Do me a favor.  Stick your finger 
                    in my ass.

                                  JASON
                    Uh, okay.  

      He does so, ever so cautiously, trying not to giggle.

                                  JASON (CONT D)
                    That, uh, working for you?

      She looks up again. 

                                  JACOBY
                    Try your thumb.                                                                                    26


                                  JASON
                    (TO SELF) You just never know how 
                    the day s going to end, do you? 

      He exchanges digits.  She begins to grind.  

                                  JACOBY
                    Mm, yes. 

                                  JASON
                    Wait, I m in a bad position... Ow!  

      Holy fuck this hurts.  He bites his lip in agony.

                                  JACOBY
                      (OBLIVIOUS) Yes!  Yes!  Harder!



      Supercouple are in bed, a TENNIS TROPHY beside them.  Clearly, 
      they just made bacon.  Eric stretches; Stacey s on her phone.

                                  ERIC
                      Championship trophy, multi-position 
                    morning sex - I feel like Roger 
                    Federer.  How many calories do you 
                    think we just burned, hon?

                                  STACEY
                    Shhh.  Hi, I never got an email 
                      confirming my Sleigh Bells tickets?  
                    Stacey Goodman.  No, that can t be.  
                    Really, nothing?  Shoot.  And it s 
                    sold out?  Perfect. (HANGS UP) Ugh, 
                    Jason didn t reserve the tickets.  

                                  ERIC
                    Maybe he put them under his name? 

                                  STACEY
                    Or maybe he was out being a total 
                    poon hound!  Great, now what re we 
                    gonna do, just go to some lame bar 
                    like we do every year?  One time I 
                    wanted to do something special...

                                  ERIC
                    Sorry, Sweetie.

                                  STACEY
                    (CURLING INTO HIM) Godammit.  
                    Godammit!  
                                                                                     27



                                            ACT 3



      Bobby is about to sell a XXX DVD to a TWEEN.

                                  BOBBY
                    You are eighteen?

                                  TWEEN
                    Twenty. I just moisturize and shit.

                                  BOBBY
                    Okay, enjoy.

      Tween exits as Jason bursts in, thumb still elevated.

                                  BOBBY (CONT D)
                    You all right, boss?

                                  JASON
                    To say I feel like dogshit would be 
                    an insult to dogshit.  Do you have 
                    gauze and a splint?

      The door swings open -- Tina enters with a giant hickey.

                                  TINA
                    Meyers is a fucking vampire.  

                                  JASON
                    Whoa.

                                  BOBBY
                    Hello  Tina.   See, I nice today, 
                    because of your ugly neck blood.

                                  TINA
                    Whore friend of Jason is actually 
                    more accurate right now.  What 
                    happened to your thumb?

                                  JASON
                    Jacoby s ass.  Her sphincter had 
                    the grip of a merchant marine.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    28

                                  JASON (CONT'D)
                    That pervy lawyer only made Jane 
                    look better, by the way.  Thanks. 

                                  TINA
                    Well, prepare to up your bummer 
                    level.  Stacey already called me 
                    this morning. Apparently, there are 
                    no tickets reserved under her name, 
                    and the show s totally sold out.  

                                  JASON
                    No.  Shit, I didn t think it d sell 
                    out so fast.  

                                  TINA
                    Well it did, and Stacey s super, 
                    super pissed, Jay.  She was talking 
                    in that high-pitched angry voice 
                    that makes me want to bite down on 
                    the cyanide pill I keep in my 
                    molar.  Y know, Brett and I really 
                    wanted to see that show, too.

                                  JASON
                    Oh, did I upset you and the guy who 
                    didn t give you that hickey?   Give 
                    me a break. Ug, what am I gonna do?

                                  TINA
                    Maybe you can find a scalper?  You 
                    need to do some top quality 
                    weaseling here.  It s serious. 

                                  JASON
                    I ll figure something out.



      Jason, thumb taped up, walks past JB at the copier.  

                                  JB
                    Look at me, doing Jason work.  You 
                    just got docked twenty bucks, Jay.

                                  JASON
                    Sorry, I ll come in early tomorrow 
                    and make it up.

                                  JB
                    Double or nothing you don t. C mon, 
                    grab the video gear, we have more 
                    mini-mes auditioning today.                                                                                    29


      Jason goes to the equipment closet.  He takes out a digicam, 
      and then reaches for the boombox.  Suddenly, he gets an idea.



      Stacey holds up a flashcard, quizzing Eric on rashes.

                                  ERIC
                    Shingles?

                                  STACEY
                    No.  C mon, you know this.

                                  ERIC
                    Shit.  Uhhhh..... Stage 4 melanoma!

                                  STACEY
                    Yes!

      They high five each other.  Faint music is heard.

                                  ERIC
                    Do you hear music?

      They go to the window.  Jason s holding the boombox over his 
      head, Say Anything style.  It s dramatic.  

                                  ERIC (CONT D)
                    (AWE) He s pulling a Cusack.

                                  STACEY
                    (TO JASON)  You ruined my birthday!

                                  JASON
                    I can fix it!  I have a plan!  I-- 

      A car, BLASTING merengue, pulls behind him, completely 
      eclipsing his In Your Eyes moment with bone-rattling bass.

                                  JASON (CONT D)
                    Oh, c mon man!

      It rolls on.  Stacey and Eric look at him, then at each other.

                                  ERIC
                    You re going to forgive him, right?

                                  STACEY
                    Yeah.  He s Jason. (YELLS)  Jay-- 

                                  ERIC
                    (CUTS HER OFF) Wait, wait.  Let s 
                    see how long he ll stand there.                                                                                      30




      A banner hangs across the tiny apartment:  HAPPY BIRTHDAY 
      STACEY!  The space is totally packed with PARTY-GOERS. Tina, 
      neck hidden by the scarf, approaches Jason, who wears a tie.  

                                  TINA
                    Look at you, all dolled up.

                                  JASON
                    Scraped it clean with a bbq brush.  

                                  TINA
                    Nice comeback, spaz.  Sloppy Stacey 
                    seems really happy.

      Stacey, holding her liquor like a 14 year-old, stands on the 
      coffee table, above the wall-to-wall partyers, opening gifts. 

                                  STACEY
                    I don t care if I m old, my man s 
                    gonna be a doctor and give me free 
                    Botox, so eat it!  He cracked some 
                    guy s ribs today!  His ribs.

                                  ERIC
                    Focus on the gift, Stace.

                                  JASON
                    (TO TINA) I convinced her a small 
                    party with friends was better than 
                      a concert.  Plus there s the added 
                    benefit of fewer people to 
                    embarrass herself in front of.   

      Stacey finally gets the gift open.

                                  STACEY
                    A crock pot!  Eric, how d you know?

                                  ERIC
                    I knew, Sweetie.  

      She tongues him, aggressively.

                                  TINA
                    (TO JASON)  Those guys are so in 
                    love.  Boring, slow cooked, but 
                    very tender love.                                                                                     31


                                  JASON
                    Speaking of love, I thought Brett 
                    was coming?  Was it the minor dork 
                      indiscretion?

                                  TINA
                    No. (SHRUGS) I found a Coldplay CD.  

                                  JASON
                    Oof.

      They nod; yeah, that s that.  

                                  JASON (CONT D)
                    So, in all the excitement, I, er, 
                    forgot to buy Stacey a present.

                                  TINA
                    And yet she got a gift from both of 
                    us. I put your name on the card.  
                    That s another one you owe me.

                                  JASON
                    What was the first one?

      Tina, grinning, hands him a plastic bag from her Ashley Olsen 
      sized purse.  Jason takes it and pulls out... a pair of pants.

                                  TINA
                    I figured you might need some fresh 
                    ones.  Have fun getting  em dirty.

                                  JASON
                    (CLEARLY MOVED) Thanks.

      They watch as Stacey unwraps a very Tina-esque blouse.

                                  STACEY
                    Guys - I love it!  And thanks for 
                    this awesome party Jay!  Wooo!

                                  TINA
                    See, so you lost a pair of pants, 
                    but hey, you saved Stacey s big 
                    birthday.  You good?

                                  JASON
                    Totally.  I mean, I d be better if 
                    you had weed.

      She pulls out a J like some kind of pot magician.

                                  TINA
                    Voila.                                                                                    32




      It s less crowded now, but still going.  Stacey s in the fetal 
      position on the couch beside Eric.  Lench shows one of 
      Stacey s NERDY LAW SCHOOL FRIENDs something on his Blackberry 
      that makes her recoil, disgusted. 

      Jason, drunk and sweaty, squeezes past some partyers to the 
      fridge, and grabs a beer.  As he s about to close the door, 
      something catches his eye.  

      He reaches in and pulls out a long brunette hair. Jane s hair.  

      Jostled by dancing guests, he eyes it, wistfully.  

      Tina spots him; she cocks an eyebrow.  It clicks. 

                                  TINA
                    Oh, Jesus Christ.  You re gonna try 
                    to find those pants, aren t you?

      He s still examining the hair.

                                  JASON
                    You know, I do believe I am.

      They laugh, crack beers, and let the night go good and blurry.
