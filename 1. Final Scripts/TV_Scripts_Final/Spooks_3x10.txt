      EXT. STREET - DAY 1. 0730

      A quiet London street with kids kicking a ball about outside. 
      Parked in the street is a van which is obviously our standard 

      MI5 surveillance vehicle.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      And inside the van are a pair of individuals who are 

      listening on headphones.  Except we don t recognise them and 
      they are of Middle-Eastern appearance.  One is a man called 
      Ahmed, somewhere in middle age.  The other is a younger woman 
      called Khatera.  She s elegant and stylish, dressed in 
      Western clothes.

                                  AHMED
                          (in Arabic)
                    She s gone into the kitchen.


                                                                            CUT TO:

      Fiona pouring water from the kettle into a cafetiere.  Opens 

      the fridge with her foot, takes out a carton of milk, sniffs 
      it and pours it away with an irritated gesture.

                                  FIONA
                          (calls)
                    Adam! 

      No answer.


                                  ADAM
                    Adam, it ll have to be black coffee 
                     cos that stupid organic milk you 
                    insist on buying goes off in thirty 
                    seconds.


      No answer again.  She flicks the radio on to the Today 
      programme.

                                  PRESENTER (V.O.)
                    But, Minister, how would you 
                    respond to the charge that the 

                    current government in Iraq is no 
                    more legitimate than its 

                      predecessor.   

                                  GUEST MINISTER (V.O.)
                    Look, the aim of the coalition has 
                    always been to bring peace, 
                    stability and democracy to Iraq...






                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                    We re confident that the new 
                      administration will be able to deal 
                    with the teething problems which 
                    are inevitable in this kind of

                    But without American military might 
                    this government could never 
                      survive... 

      Fiona flicks the radio on to a music channel which obviously 
      makes her much more cheerful.  Sinks the plunger on the 
      cafetiere.  In the doorway, Adam appears with his hair 
      tousled and rubbing his eyes.

                                  FIONA
                    Hey, sleepyhead.

      He walks over to her, kisses her forehead, takes a cup of 
      coffee, sips it, frowns and adds some sugar.

                                  FIONA (CONT D)
                    You ve got odd socks on.

      He glances down and nods.

                    Have you chased the FCO about the

      Toast pops out of the toaster.  Adam starts to spread peanut 
      butter on a slice.  Plays with Fiona, offering it to her and 
      then pulling it away.

      Special Forces are entering a property.  They make their way

      about, fast-food wrappings and some child s toys.  Behind

                    The Moroccan agent you re running,

                    Move quickly.  We re at maximum 
                    security alert.  Ruth, what s the 
                    internet chatter telling us?

                                  RUTH
                    Too much traffic on the airwaves at 
                    the moment.  Not so much chatter as 
                    frenzied babble.

                                  ADAM
                    Threats to bridges, football 
                    stadia, Buckingham Palace garden 
                    parties.  A lot of it obviously 
                    comes from cranks but we can t stay 
                    on top of it all.



                                  HARRY 
                    Show them the CCTV footage.

      Ruth brings up some CCTV footage.  It s a tube station and an 
      Asian man in traditional clothing is being set upon by a 
      group of other passengers and viciously beaten.







                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                    group of passengers became 
                    convinced that he was about to 
                    launch some kind of suicide attack. 
                    They beat him to a pulp.

                    a bag with some birthday presents

                                  FIONA
                    People are very scared.

                                  ADAM
                    And that s what the terrorists 
                    want.  To leave us choking on our

                    the Iraqis and Americans coming to

                    It s more than possible that any 
                    terrorist attack will be timed to 
                    coincide with the visit.

      Adam runs his hands through his hair.  Obviously working flat 
      out.

                                  ADAM
                    Which would certainly be 
                      unfortunate timing. 

                                  HARRY
                    Another bomb in Basra today.  
                    Seventy dead including a bus full 
                    of school-kids.

                                  ADAM
                    You know in the first days after 
                    the fall of Baghdad, I laughed in 
                    the face of a friend who warned 
                    that Iraq would turn into another 
                    Vietnam. 

                                  HARRY
                    Takes more than pulling down the 
                    statue of a dictator to pacify a 
                    country.


                                  ADAM
                    This new guy seems hopeful though.

                                  HARRY
                    Shame that such a large section of 
                    his fellow country-men see him as 
                    our puppet.  

                                  ADAM
                    He is making concessions to 
                    moderate Shi ite opinion.

                    Making him a prime target for the 
                      extremists.  So let s hope that 
                    Special Branch ensure nothing 
                    happens to him while he s a visitor 
                    to our shores.

      They see Fiona and Danny leaving The Grid. 

                                  ADAM
                    They work well together.

                                  HARRY
                    Good.  Hopefully, Butterfly will 
                    give Fiona something useful.

      INT. CALL CENTRE - DAY 2. 1300
1616

      People sitting around using phone booths and internet 
      services - mixture of students and tourists.  The man who 
      allocates the computers is Fiona s agent  Butterfly .  Fiona 
      enters the cafe wearing a rucksack and looking like the type 
      who might want to call friends in Australia.  

      We see her talking to  Butterfly  and he indicates the cabin 
      right at the back of the centre.  She walks across and goes 
      into a phone booth where she picks up a phone, all the while 
      feeling under the counter where the phone is.  Checks nobody 
      watching, removes a false partition and slides out a plastic 
      folder.  Then she quickly puts that into her rucksack.  
      Leaves the booth, pays no attention to  Butterfly  as she 
      exits the call centre - just another punter.

      Ruth and Adam at their stations.  Fiona comes over with a

                                  FIONA
                    Dead drop from Butterfly.  Rumours 
                    of a big London liaison meeting 
                    soon between some North African 
                      characters we might be interested 
                    in.  

                                  ADAM
                    Find out when and where.  Work with 
                    Danny on it.

      She nods and exits.

                                  RUTH
                    So what are you getting Fiona for 
                    her birthday?

      Adam shakes his head.


                                  ADAM
                    Sorry, Ruth.

                                  RUTH
                    What?

                                  ADAM
                    You might be her mole.  And even if 
                    you weren t, telling you would only 
                    put you in danger.  Fiona takes 
                    birthdays very seriously.  I often 
                    have to drug her the night before 
                    to make her sleep.

                                  RUTH
                    I m not a mole!

      INT. A HOUSE - DAY 2. 1600
1919

      An individual we will know as  Butterfly  sits alone in a 
      bedroom.  Suddenly, the door of a stand-alone wardrobe opens 
      and two men enter the room.  The wardrobe has clearly been 
      placed in front of a gap made in the partition wall so that 
      people can enter the house from another property without 
      being observed from the outside.  One of the men who has come 
      in is Ahmed who we saw in the surveillance operation against 
      Adam and Fiona.  The men greet each other and then Ahmed 
      hands him a briefcase. 

                                  AHMED
                    Count it. It s what you deserve for 
                    helping us.

       Butterfly  opens it, it s empty.  He looks up puzzled.

      Into the silencer of a gun barrel.

                                  AHMED (CONT D)
                    MI5 will have to change your agent 
                    name from butterfly to traitor.

      Ahmed shoots him in the head and then once more when he is on 
      the ground.  They look dispassionately at the corpse.

                                  AHMED (CONT D)

      INT. FIONA AND ADAM S HOUSE - DAY 3. 0700
2020

      Early morning and Adam opens the door to the bedroom and 
      looks at his sleeping wife.  He s carrying a tray with a 
      birthday breakfast.  Puts it down carefully and watches her 
      sleeping for a second.  Removes a strand of hair from her 
      face and she stirs.

                                  ADAM
                    Hey.

                                  FIONA
                    I was having such a strange dream.

                    What about?


                                  FIONA
                    I was trying to get across a 
                    bridge.

      She blinks. 

                                  FIONA (CONT D)
                    You were on the other side.

                                  ADAM
                    Well I m here now.  Happy birthday, 
                      sweetheart.

      He kisses her.  She looks pleased.

                                  FIONA
                    Oh yes, it s my birthday isn t it. 

      She inspects the tray, tosses a croissant out of the way, 
      pushes a rose to one side, ignores the birthday card.

                                  FIONA (CONT D)
                    Where s my present?

      Adam laughs good-naturedly picks up the rose and tucks it 
      behind her ear.






                                                                            (CONTINUED)

      A beat.  No more wisecracking Fiona, her eyes betray emotion, 
      almost tearful.

                                  FIONA (CONT D)
                    I really love you.

      He fastens the brooch onto her pyjamas.  She touches it 
      gently with her finger.

      He kisses her.

      Danny and Fiona with clipboards.

                    Butterfly said the meeting is 
                    scheduled for this evening but the 
                    house would be empty until at least 
                    twelve.  Which gives us an hour 
                    max.   

      Danny checks his watch.

                                  DANNY
                    We have to be sure before we go in.

      Fiona indicates a neighbourhood watch sticker on the door of 
      a house.

                                  FIONA
                    You go next door and try the bell.  
                    I ll see if the local vigilante can 
                    help.

      Fiona rings the bell.  Door is answered by an elderly woman.

                                  FIONA (CONT D)
                    Hello, Mrs Edwards?  I m from the 
                    local council. Just wanted to check 
                    that you were still at this address

      We go with Danny to the next house.  Rings bell.  No answer.

                    Harry if this comes off.

      She laughs and takes out a lock-pick from her pocket.  Within 
      seconds the door s open.

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    Bloody hell, that was quick.

      He looks up and down the street.  It s deserted.

      They move stealthily through the house.  Fiona gestures that 
      she s going upstairs.  He nods.  She makes her way cautiously 
      up the stairs.  The floorboards creak.  She makes her way 
      across landing and into ...

                          (into voice comm)
                    I m in the main bedroom.

      She makes her way into the room and it s the same room in 
      which we saw Butterfly receive his  pay-off .  Also in the 
      corner is the wardrobe from which we saw Ahmed emerge 
      previously.  Fiona makes her way over to the desk.  She opens 
      a drawer and there s a pile of pristine credit cards as well 
      as new passports and hundreds of travellers cheques.


                                  FIONA (CONT D)
                    This is definitely a logistical 
                    safe house, Danny.  I m just going 
                    to put a device in the lamp.

                                  DANNY (V.O.)
                    I m in the kitchen.

      Fiona sits down on the bed with her back to the wardrobe and 
      starts to fiddle with a bedside lamp.

      But behind her the wardrobe doors start to slowly open. 

      We want to cry out and warn her.

                                  FIONA
                    Nearly done here Danny, there s a 
                    ton of credit cards and passports.

      A grotesque image behind Fiona of a man framed in the 
      entrance to the wardrobe wearing a ski-mask and carrying a 
      gun.  On Fiona.

                    How s it going in the kitchen?

      Silence.

      She places the lamp carefully on the bedside table.

                                  FIONA (CONT D)
                    Danny?

      Suddenly, violently she is grabbed from behind and dragged 
      back across the bed by her hair.  She tries to struggle and 
      cry out but tape is put over her mouth and she is hauled by 
      the man wearing the ski mask into the cupboard and the door 
      slams behind her.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      In the back of the van are two cuffed and gagged figures. 
      Fiona is staring into Danny s eyes. Seated above them a man 
      with a gun rests his foot with casual sadism on Danny s head.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                    Well, Fiona s a lucky girl.

                                  ADAM
                    I tell her that all the time.

                                  ADAM
                    Embassy reception in Damascus. 
                    Before everything changed and you 
                    could still walk about an Arab 
                    city. I d just arrived. It was 
                    humid. The air conditioning wasn t 
                    working.  Everybody was sweating 
                    but she just looked so cool and 
                    assured.  Anyway, I tried to get 
                    her attention but it was as if she 
                    was looking right through me.  
                    Suddenly though she came up to me 
                    and said  I can t stand this any 
                    more.  Do you want to go for a 
                    walk? 

                                  RUTH
                    How romantic!

                                  ADAM
                    We went walking through the city, 
                    down to the Omayyad mosque.  And as 
                    we passed the ancient temple she 
                    pointed out a little tower and 
                    said:  that s the Minaret of the 
                    Bride . 

      He stops for a moment, lost in the nostalgia of romantic and 
      sexual memory.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    After that, every weekend we walked 
                    round together.  She said the only 
                    way to get to know a city was to 
                    lose yourself in it. The souks with 
                    their silver and spices, the walls 
                    of the old city. But we always met 
                    up at the Minaret of the Bride.

      Ruth stares at him captivated.  Beside her a signal comes up 
      on a monitor.

                                  RUTH
                    And here s the bride herself 
                    calling in a status report ...

      She listens to Fiona s report, smiles and replaces the phone.

                                  AHMED
                    You found out about that?  How?

                                  FIONA
                    Maybe you have an informer in your 
                    ranks.

      Ahmed barks an order at the guard.  Advantage appears to be 
      with Fiona.

                                  FIONA (CONT'D)
                    So don t make matters worse by 
                      interfering with two officers of 
                    the British Security Services.  I 
                    can negotiate safe passage to a 
                    country like Sudan in return for 
                    our release.

                                  AHMED
                    That sounds promising.

      He studies her carefully and then he laughs.  The guard hands 
      him a digital camera.  He goes round and shows Fiona an image 
      of  Butterfly  behind his desk in the call centre.


                                  AHMED (CONT D)
                    You ran an agent called Butterfly I 
                    believe.

      Fiona shakes her head.

                                  FIONA
                    I ve no idea ...

      Another image of Butterfly with his head blown off.  Fiona 
      turns away.

                                  AHMED
                    You want to offer me a new deal?

      Fiona does not register surprise or disappointment.

                                  FIONA
                    So you used him to lure us to that 
                    house.  Why?




                                                                            (CONTINUED)

      Ahmed indicates to a guard who brings digi-cam forward and 
      hands Fiona a sheet of paper.

                                  AHMED
                    Read.

                                  FIONA
                    What is this?

      Looks at it and shakes her head.  He puts his hand on her 
      head but she still does not speak.  Ahmed nods to guard who 
      walks over to Danny, takes out a knife and holds it to his 
      throat.

                                  AHMED
                    This is no time for games.  Read it 
                    or I ll cut his throat.

      Fiona looks up.

                                  FIONA
                    My name is Fiona Carter.  I work as 
                    a British spy and I am being held 
                    by a group of fighters who will 
                    avenge the blood spilled in Iraq by 
                    America and its allies.  Tonight 
                    the Prime Minister will give a 
                    speech outlining his continuing 
                      commitment to the presence of 
                    British troops in Iraq.  Unless he 
                    uses the speech to signal their 
                    immediate withdrawal from the south 
                    of the country, I will be burned 
                    alive together with my spy 
                      colleague.  Let this be a warning 
                    that we can take hostages anywhere 
                    we choose.


      She looks up at him and if she is feeling fear she does not 
      betray it.  The digi-cam is lowered.

                                  AHMED
                    You read those words with no 
                    emotion.

                                  FIONA
                    They re not my words.

                                  AHMED
                    Every single person involved in 
                    this operation has lost somebody.  
                    A family member, a friend, a 
                    husband or wife.  That man over 
                    there ...

      He indicates the guard who stares at them impassively.

                    Maybe because we couldn t cut 
                    anybody s throat very easily.

      Ahmed turns to him.

                                  AHMED
                    No you would just send a laser-
                    guided bomb into a wedding party.

      He prepares to leave the room.

      Sam and Ruth are sitting chatting at Ruth s station.  A 
      young, good-looking Asian guy walks over to them.  We ll know 
      him as ZAFAR.  He stands by them without interrupting.

                                  SAM
                    So then he just jumped out of bed 
                    and said he wanted to drive to

                    I didn t want to interrupt your 
                      conversation.

      He s got a calm and assured smile, oozes self-confidence and 
      charm.  She appraises him very quickly.

                                  SAM
                    That s OK.

                                  ZAFAR

                          (to Fiona)
                    I need you to be able to use the 
                    phone.  You can give him his bread 
                    and water.

      Fiona drinks some water and chews a little bit of bread. 
      Offers the bottle to Danny.  He shakes his head.  She frowns.

                                  FIONA
                          (quietly)
                    Come on, Danny, we need our 
                    strength.

      She feeds him water from the bottle.

                                  AHMED
                    Now you re going to make another 
                    phone call.

                                  FIONA
                    Who to?

                                  AHMED
                    To your husband.

      She stares at him.

                                  FIONA
                    To say what?

                                  AHMED
                    You ll arrange to meet him in a 
                    place that I tell you.

                                  FIONA
                    Lure my husband into a trap?  
                    That s not going to happen.

                                  AHMED
                    I thought you might say that.

      He hands Fiona a photograph.

      She looks at it.  Then looks back at her captor.

      Flashback: Fiona remembers walking Wes from her car to the 
      school gates.  She bends down, kisses him and tousles his 
      hair.  He laughs, turns and runs into school.  She watches

                    if triggered, will mean that I will

                    I receive regular messages from 
                    her.  Should I not hear them I

                    Please don t hurt her.  I ll do 
                      everything you ask.

                                  AHMED
                    Although your bargaining position 
                    is very weak, you still have 
                    choices. You can for example make 
                    the death of the hostages less 
                    agonising than being burned alive.  
                    Do you understand, Mr Carter?

                                  ADAM
                      I understand.

                                  AHMED
                    Good.  We understand each other. 
                    That s a promising start.

      He snaps the mobile shut and looks at Fiona who is struggling 
      up holding her hand to her bleeding face.  Now her expression 
      is one of utter terror.  She crawls towards Danny who tries 
      to move his body so she can curl against him for comfort.

      (End of split screen)

      Adam stares at Khatera.

                                    KHATERA
                    Put your bag on the table.

      Adam puts the bag on the table. 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                    Take out everything in your 
                    pockets.  Keys, cash, wallet, 
                      everything and place them in the 
                    bag.

      Adam does this. 

                                    KHATERA (CONT D)
                    And the mobile.

                                  ADAM
                    I have to call in a status report 
                    or they ll start looking for me.  I 
                    also have a meeting with my boss in 
                    half an hour which again will alert 
                    him to my absence if I miss it with 
                    no call.

      She hesitates.  Then she takes out her mobile and calls. 
      Speaks away from Adam in Arabic obviously receiving 
        instructions from Ahmed.  Clicks mobile shut.

                                    KHATERA
                    OK, call in.  But you know what the 
                    deal is.  Do you have speakerphone 
                    on that?

      He nods.

                                    KHATERA (CONT D)
                    Put it on so I can hear everything.

      Adam dials.

                                  ADAM
                    Ruth it s Adam.

                                  RUTH (V.O.)
                    Go ahead.

                                  ADAM
                      Everything s fine.  Listen, I ve 
                    just been in touch with Fiona and 
                    Danny and we re following a lead at 
                    the call-centre so I need you to 
                    cancel my meeting with Harry.


                                  RUTH (V.O.)
                    OK.  By the way, you never told me 
                    what you got Fiona for her 
                    birthday?

                                  ADAM
                    I got her the Belgian chocolates 
                    just as you suggested.

      Please don t say anything Ruth.

                                  RUTH
                    I m sorry?

                                  ADAM
                    Yes.  It seemed like yours was the 
                    best suggestion in the end.

                                  RUTH
                    You got her chocolates?

                                  ADAM
                    You talked me into it.  Fiona loved 
                    them just like you said she would.

      His tone is very flat, no hint of banter.  A tiny beat.

                                  RUTH
                    Right.  OK, well hope she 
                      appreciates them.  Speak to you 
                    later.

      Phone call ends.

                                    KHATERA
                    What was all that about chocolates?

                                  ADAM
                    It s my wife s birthday.  My 
                    colleague wanted to know what I d 
                    bought her.

      Khatera stares at him.

                                    KHATERA
                    Don t try and play any tricks with 
                    me.

                                  ADAM
                    It wasn t a trick.  Quite the 
                    opposite.

                                    KHATERA
                    It would be very dangerous for you 
                    to try and fool me.

                                  ADAM
                      Especially when you re unarmed.

                    You approve of that do you?  
                    Hitting a woman.  Threatening to 
                    burn her alive?  How would you have

                                  RUTH
                    He said that he d bought Fiona 
                      chocolates for her birthday as I

                                  HARRY
                    I thought that was my suggestion.

                    Harry.  I talked to Adam.  There is 
                    no way in the world that he was 
                    going to buy Fiona chocolates for 
                    her birthday no matter who 
                    suggested it.

                                  HARRY
                    Ask him about it when he comes in.  

      He returns to work and it s obvious he considers the matter 
      closed.  But she doesn t leave.  He looks up quizzically.  
      Still here?

                    But why did you choose us?

                    You re not the only ones who can 
                    gather intelligence.

                                  ADAM
                    You re clearly well-educated.  Are 
                    you originally from Baghdad?

      She doesn t answer.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    Spent a bit of time there myself.

                                    KHATERA
                    Spying on my people!

                                  ADAM
                    No actually, it was after I left 
                      university and I went travelling 
                    all around the Middle East.  

                                    KHATERA
                    How nice for you.
                          (beat)
                    You ll never understand the anger 
                    you cause.

                                  ADAM
                    I ve had a love affair with that 
                    part of the world since I was a 
                    student.  I think I do understand 
                    it a little.

                                    KHATERA
                    Then it s a shame that your rulers 
                    don t, because it will bring you 
                    great suffering in return.  Now 
                    stop talking so much.

      Ruth, Zafar and Harry.  They re looking at footage of Adam 
      sitting with Khatera on the South Bank.  

                                  HARRY
                    Who s the girl?  And where are 
                    Danny and Fiona?

                                  RUTH
                    We have to assume that he s being 
                    held there under duress.  Otherwise 
                    he would have been able to say what 
                    he s doing.

                                  ZAFAR
                    No sign that she s got a weapon of 
                    any type.

                                  HARRY
                    OK, we need to talk to him.  
                    Without her getting wind of it.

                                  RUTH
                    Kind of tricky when she s sitting 
                    right opposite him.

                                  ZAFAR
                    I ve got an idea but we ll need to 
                    act very fast before she moves him. 
                    Where s your logistical team?

      Harry indicates Malcolm and Colin.

                                  ZAFAR (CONT D)
                    I ve been stuck behind a desk for 
                    far too long.

                                  HARRY

      Fiona and Danny are sitting opposite each other Guard is 
      outside.


                                  DANNY
                    They took away your lock-pick.

                                  FIONA
                    Sadly yes.

                                  DANNY
                    It s just that an escape attempt 
                    when we re handcuffed starts us off 
                    at some disadvantage.

                                  FIONA
                    Nigh on impossible I would say.

      She touches the brooch that Adam gave her for her birthday

                                  FIONA (CONT D)
                    But I wasn t exaggerating when I 
                    said that I had a talent for this. 
                    I m going to give you some water 
                    now.

      She lifts the bottle with her cuffed hands and as she does so 
      she releases the brooch.  It falls to the ground in front of 
      them.  Danny glances at it and realises what she s going to 
      try and do.

                                  DANNY
                    The guard!

      The guard is looking in through the window but all he sees is 
      Fiona feeding water to Danny.

      Harry is talking on the phone to Zafar who is in a car 
      heading towards South Bank (Split Screen).


                                  HARRY
                    The house which Danny and Fiona 
                    entered had a partition wall 
                    removed to allow access to the next 
                    house.  There s an open loft space 
                    between the houses so they were 
                    able to enter without being 
                    spotted.

                    Nothing. We don t even know whether 
                    we re dealing with a hostage 
                    situation yet or what their demands

                      Hopefully, we ll be able to talk to 
                    Adam soon.

      Harry puts the phone down and glances at Ruth who is looking 
      very troubled.

                    It will be OK, Ruth, we ll bring

      EXT. SOUTH BANK.  NFT CAFE - DAY 3. 1430

      Khatera is preparing to move Adam.

                                  ADAM
                    Where are we going?

                                    KHATERA
                    You don t ask the questions.

      As they get up, a group of people with bright jackets and 
      promotional material for what appears to be a new brand of 
      sweets come into the cafe outside which they are sitting.  
      They re accosting people, pressing sample sweets on them and 
      asking them to answer a questionnaire.  A pair of them comes 
      across to Khatera and Adam.  One of them is Zafar.  Adam 
      shows absolutely no recognition of him as he approaches.  
      Zafar has the irritatingly perky demeanour of people who 
      pester you on the street.  While his colleague distracts 
      Khatera, Zafar clasps Adam s hand warmly.  Adam glances down 
      to see a tiny voice-comm device.  In a swift and subtle 
      gesture he moves one part to his ear.  It s taken a fraction 
      of a second.


                                  ZAFAR
                    Hello, Sir.  You look like you re 
                    having a good day with your 
                    beautiful wife ...

                                  ADAM
                    Go away we re not interested.

                    Come onnnnnn ... it s just a few 
                    seconds.  Here s a free sample 
                    which should make you a little 
                    sweeter for her.  Don t think your 
                    lovely lady needs it ...

      He hands him a small packet of sweets which is also being 
      done by other members of the group. Adam pockets it.  Behind 
      him, Khatera is trying to fend off the persistent attention 
      of another of the group but in doing so she has to turn away 
      from Adam.  Zafar sits down with Adam and shows him the 
      clipboard.

                                  ZAFAR (CONT D)
                    They re very straight-foward

                    I really haven t got time to talk 
                    to you ...


      (Split Screen between the Cafe and The Grid)

      Monitor bleeping signals to Harry that he s connected to 
      Adam.

                                  HARRY
                    Adam, what s going on?

      Adam is turned away from Khatera.  His body language suggests 
      he is trying to get rid of Zafar.

                                  ADAM
                    Don t know.

                                  HARRY
                    Where are Danny and Fiona?

                                  ADAM
                    I can t answer that question 
                    either.

      He glances around to see that Khatera is still being accosted 
      by two other of the volunteers, one of whom has managed to 
      partially obstruct her view of him.

                                  HARRY
                    You need to bring the girl in, 
                    Adam.

      Adam leans in toward Zafar as if studying the questions he is 
      being asked.

                    for sure.  This isn t what we

      Khatera is trying to fend off her interviewer and keep an eye 
      on Adam.

                    Who s the girl? 

                                  ADAM
                    Iraqi.  Clever, middle class, lived 
                    abroad.

                                  HARRY
                    I m going to get pressure to bring 
                    her in for interrogation.

      Khatera is almost managing to free herself of the attentions 
      of her interrogators.  Adam spots this but needs to get one 
      last message to Harry.

                                  ADAM
                    I d definitely not be receptive to 
                    a  strategy like that.  It could 
                    fatally alienate your market.

                                  HARRY
                    There s a tracking device in the 
                    sweet packet you were given and we 
                    can hear your conversations with 
                    the girl.  Try and get us 
                      information we can use.  But you 
                    haven t got unlimited time, Adam.

                          (loudly to Zafar)
                    Look, I haven t got the time or the 
                    patience for this.  Please go away 
                    and leave us alone.

      Zafar holds his hands up and moves away.  Whole thing has 
      taken a matter of seconds.

                    It s my party trick. 

      Her eyes are screwed up with concentration and then ... click

      She starts to work on the handcuffs with the brooch pin.

                                  DANNY
                    You broke your new brooch.

                                  FIONA
                    I think the person who gave it to 
                    me would approve of the reason.

      Danny s handcuffs click open.

      Fiona and Danny.

                                  DANNY

                    You ready?

      She nods and curls onto the floor.  Puts her fingers down her 
      throat and retches.  Danny starts banging on the door.  Guard 
      enters.

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    Sick.  She s sick.  Get help. 

      Fiona is contorting and spasming as the guard hesitates.

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    The blow to the head!

      At that point Fiona throws up.  Guard takes a step into room, 
      lowers shot gun and reaches for his mobile.  With a swift 
      judo kick Fiona has struck him very hard sending  him 
      reeling.  He drops the gun and Danny then has the guard s 
      feet whipped from under him, bringing him to the ground while 
      pushing the shot-gun out of arms reach.   Fiona pulls back 
      the Guard s head while Danny draws back his hand and gives 
      him a death blow to the trachea.  The guard is still.

      Danny takes the shot-gun and peers cautiously out into the 
      passage.  Fiona hands him the guard s mobile.

      Danny kicks open the door and makes his way into the passage.  
      There are some double doors leading outside and he tries the 
      door but it s locked.  He indicates for Fiona to step back 
      and then blasts the door with the shot-gun.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)

      Makes his way out into the open air and liberty.  Moves away 
      from the door and quickly dials number on mobile he has taken 
      from the guard.  

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    Ruth ... no time to talk ... we re 
                    near some woods.  Leaving mobile on 
                    so you can trace us.

      He kicks the mobile away towards some undergrowth and turns 
      back for Fiona.  

      She is standing in the doorway and Ahmed is holding a pistol 
      to her head.

      Danny drops the shot-gun.  A guard walks over picks it up, 
      smashes him in the knee with it so he is on the ground and 
      crippled. 

                                  AHMED
                          (to another guard in 
                            Arabic)
                    Find the phone.

      Guard goes over to where Danny kicked the phone and calls out 
      in triumph as he picks it up.  

      The attempt to escape has failed.

      Ahmed of Fiona.  

      ON SCREEN: one of those horrible hostage images with which we 
      are growing so familiar.

                                  FIONA
                    My name is Fiona Carter. I work as 
                    a British spy and I am being held 
                    by a group of fighters who will 
                    avenge the blood spilled in Iraq by 
                    America and its allies ...

      They watch in silence. Harry picks up phone.

      Harry waves them out and reaches for the phone which has 
      started to flash.

                    And along comes Pooh and he asks 
                    Eeyore why he s so pissed off and 
                    Eeyore gestures around him with his  
                    hoof and points out that he s got 
                    loads of presents and cake with 
                    pink icing.  When Pooh says he 
                    can t see either presents or cake, 
                    Eeyore says mournfully he can t 
                    either - it was a joke.


      Danny laughs.

                    So Pooh and Piglet get him a jar of 
                    honey and a balloon but Pooh eats 
                    the honey and Piglet falls over and 
                    bursts the balloon.

                                  DANNY
                    Oh no.

                                  FIONA
                    Oh yes.

                                  DANNY
                    Poor old Eeyore. 

                                  FIONA
                    Ah but as we ve just seen broken 
                    presents can come in handy. The 
                    honey pot, being empty, is a 
                    perfect place for storing things 
                    and the balloon, being burst, can 
                    now be stored in it.

                                  DANNY
                    Genius.

                                  FIONA
                    So Eeyore sits taking his burst 
                    balloon out of the empty honey jar 
                    and putting it back in again, as 
                    happy as it s possible for a mildly 
                      depressive donkey to be.

      A beat.

                                  DANNY
                    And you re saying there s a moral

                    You can get a moral from any good 
                    story, Danny.

      They are sitting back to back.  Fiona can just touch his 
      hands with her fingers.

                    This is nobody s fault.  At least 
                    we re together.

      The door flies open and Ahmed walks in with the guards. 

      INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY 3. 1555
5454

      Adam is sitting on the end of a bed.  Khatera is facing him 
      on the chair.  She checks her watch.

                                  ADAM
                    You speak very good English.

                                    KHATERA
                    My father was an English teacher. 
                    My sister wanted to be a singer.  
                    My little brother liked English 
                    football, he had a stammer.  But 
                    Arab lives, they mean nothing to 
                    you unless it s a number to throw 
                    about to win a political argument.

                                  ADAM
                    My brother s got a stammer.  His 
                    name s Robert but we called him Ro-
                    Ro because that s always how he 
                    started saying his name.  Ro-ro-
                    robert.


      A tiny softening of Khatera s expression.

                                    KHATERA
                    You re very calm given the 
                      circumstances.

                                  ADAM
                    They do give us training.  Like 
                    what I did just there with the 
                    story about my brother?  It s true 
                    but I was using it to build some 
                    common ground between us.

      In spite of herself she smiles.

                                    KHATERA
                    You ve just ruined it by telling me 
                    that.

                                  ADAM
                    I guessed you d be clever enough to 
                    realise anyway.

                                    KHATERA
                    And now you try flattery.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                    to work on my technique.

                                    KHATERA

                    You weren t calm when you heard him 
                    hit your wife though. The 
                      expression on your face was as if 
                    he had hit you.

                                  ADAM
                    That s what it feels like isn t it? 
                    When somebody you love gets hurt.

      Her mobile rings.  She moves away from Adam speaking in 
      Arabic.  And as she moves away from him, the terrible strain 
      of what is happening suddenly shows in his face.  Just for a 
      moment though because Khatera closes the mobile.  She looks 
      at him.

                                    KHATERA

                    Your wife and the other hostage 
                    tried to escape.

                                  ADAM
                    Wouldn t you?

                                    KHATERA
                    They killed a guard.

      He stares at her, his face full of fear.

                                  ADAM
                    What s happened? Tell me. Are

                    As a result of that, one of them is 
                    going to be executed.  And you have

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    If I d been born somewhere else it 
                    might have been me holding the gun 
                    now.  If you d been born somewhere 
                    else it might have been you sitting 
                    where I am.  But there it is, for 
                    all your talk about choices we 
                    don t get to choose those things. 
                    And I guess you re just unlucky 
                    because you ve become the inhuman 
                    one with no kindness or pity left 
                    in you.  And I m sitting here with 
                    my leg all smashed up but I still 
                    have those things.  Acts of hatred 
                    also bring acts of love. So you ll 
                    never win.

      The gun moves away from Fiona.  Danny shuts his eyes and 
      mumurs to himself as if praying.


                                  AHMED
                    I m unlucky?

      Danny opens his eyes.

                                  DANNY
                    Hey, look at all the cake and 
                    presents, Fiona.

                                  FIONA

                    You know that if I didn t have my 
                    hands chained behind my back my 
                    finger would be right up in your

                    And you know what my answer would 
                    be?

      A single shot.  Ahmed has shot Danny.

      White out on the screen.  Fiona screams.



      INT. THAMES HOUSE. THE GRID - DAY 3. 1607
6060

      On the Grid everybody is frozen in terror and horror at the 
      sound of the shot.  Harry grabs headphones.  

                                  HARRY
                    Who is it?  Someone s been shot!

      Ahmed takes Fiona s head in his hands and turns it so she has 
      to look at Danny s body which is lying on the floor, blood 
      flowing from the gunshot wound to his head.

                                  FIONA
                    Danny!


      INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY 3. 1608

      The phone falls from Adam s hand.  He stares up at Khatera.

                                  ADAM
                    I m going ... I have to ...

      He runs for the toilet of the hotel room.

      INT. HOTEL ROOM. TOILET - DAY 3. 1609

      Adam is throwing up.  He stands up and wipes his mouth.  He 
      looks in the mirror and his face is streaked with tears.

                                  ADAM
                    I m sorry, I m so sorry.  

      He throws cold water on his face and slaps himself hard.

                    together.  Hold it together, Adam.

      Suddenly a voice in his ear.

                                  RUTH (V.O.)
                    Adam, what s happening.  Adam try

                    Danny.

      Go to Split Screen between Adam and Ruth.

      Ruth distraught.

                                  RUTH
                    It s not true.  Maybe it was a mock-
                      execution. 

                                  ADAM
                    Ruth!  You ve got to help me.  This 
                    is our last chance.  Tell me about 
                    the girl.  I m still in trouble 
                    here and so is Fiona.  Come on,

                    more information on her... I can t 
                    do this ... we have to find Danny.


      Adam is still staring at himself in the mirror.  Then he 
      wipes his eyes, takes the tracking device from his pocket. 
      The door bangs.

                                    KHATERA (O.S.)
                    What are you doing in there?

      Adam takes the tracking device out of his pocket, takes off 
      his watch which has the communications device and puts it in 
      his pocket.

      (End of Split Screen)

      Khatera comes in.  Adam holds out tracking device.

                                  ADAM
                    This is a tracking device.  MI5 
                    know where we are.

                                  ADAM
                    We have to leave it here.  It will 
                    buy us some time if they think 
                    we re still in the room.

      She can see the sense in this.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    They ll have people around the

                    distance and I can get us away from 
                    here.  Do what I say and we can 
                    both get what we want.


      A beat.  A very subtle shift in the balance between them is 
      taking place.  Adam is surrendering but he s also assuming 
      control, growing more authoritative.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    Come on, you know you can trust me 
                    now.  You want us to work together? 
                    It s just me and you.

      Fiona is sitting unable to look at Danny s body which is 
      still in the room.  Ahmed and two guards come in. He 
      indicates to them to take the body away.  Fiona can t control 
      her distress.

                                  FIONA
                    Where are you taking him?  Please. 
                    Treat him with some respect at 
                    least. 

      They ignore her and exit with the body.  She looks at Ahmed 
      with utter hatred.

                                  FIONA (CONT D)

      Tears fall silently down her cheeks.  He regards her 
        impassively.

                    The male officer.

      He s knitting his hands together in anguish.  Just can t bear

                    The war started a long time ago,

                    not seeing it through to the bitter

                    And when future generations look 
                    back at this time what will they 
                    say about us?  That it was our

                    We ve committed excesses.

                                  FACER
                    And been publicly crucified for it. 
                    Where s the liberal outcry when 
                    they drag burned bodies through the 
                    streets, when they issue fatwas 
                    saying captured women can be 
                    treated as slaves?  They bomb buses 
                    in Basra filled with children and 
                    somehow that s OUR fault?  They 
                    scream about their own human rights 
                    while they swing the sword that 
                    beheads their captives.

                                  HARRY
                    You won t get an argument on that 
                    from me, Guy.  But the war that was 
                    supposed to be over has now come to 
                    our shores, one of my officers is 
                    dead and another is about to be 
                    burned alive.  So somebody,

      INT. THAMES HOUSE. THE GRID - DAY 3. 1645
6666

      Harry is talking to Zafar and Ruth.

                                  HARRY
                          (cold and mechanical)
                    I ve just had a meeting with Guy 
                    Facer.  He has totally rejected the 
                    terrorist demand that the Prime 
                    Minister should change his speech 
                    as they have demanded. The dinner 
                    tonight goes ahead exactly as 
                    planned.

                                  RUTH
                    And Adam?

                                  HARRY
                    We re bringing him in.  We ll 
                      interrogate the girl.

                                  RUTH
                    But ...

                                  HARRY
                    No buts, Ruth, there s no 
                      alternative.  Terrorists don t 
                    dictate our foreign policy.  Adam s 
                    still at the hotel?

      She nods.

                                  HARRY (CONT D)
                    We might just have enough time to 
                    get something out of her.  Our one 
                    advantage over them is that we know 
                    where Adam is.  And we ve you to 
                    thank for that.

      Ruth stares at him.

                                  HARRY (CONT D)
                    For God s sake, Ruth, you think I m 
                    happy about this?

                                  RUTH
                    Danny s dead!

                                  HARRY
                    Where s Sam?

                                  RUTH
                    She s been put under sedation.

                    Well we can t be sedated can we? 
                    We re the ones who have got to stay 
                    focused, sort this out, help Adam 
                    and find out where they re holding 
                    the last hostage.  I m relying on 
                    you, Ruth, there ll be a time to 
                    grieve later.

                          (more gently)
                    I promise you.  There will be a 
                    time to grieve.  But not now.  For 
                    now, it s not Danny and Fiona but 
                    two hostages.  We can still save 
                    the second hostage.

      She nods dumbly.

      INT. HOTEL. CORRIDOR - DAY 3. 1648
6767

      Special Forces move cautiously down the corridor.  Then they 
      kick the door of the room down and storm in.  The room is 
      empty.  Adam and Khatera are gone.  On the bedside table a 
      tracking device is flashing.  They start to speak into voice 
      comms.

      EXT. STREET - DAY 3. 1650
6868

      Adam and Khatera are walking through the rush hour crowds, 
      like a bright and attractive couple going shopping.

                                  ADAM
                    Are you going to tell me what you 
                    want from me?

                                    KHATERA
                    Your Prime Minister is entertaining 
                    tonight.  

                                  ADAM

                                    KHATERA
                    Prior to that he is giving out 
                    awards for humanitarian endeavour 
                    overseas.  You may see the irony in 
                    that.  In attendance will be 
                    several traitors from my country 
                    and their American sponsers.  
                    You ll get me in there.

                    What are you going to do?  You re 
                    unarmed.

                                    KHATERA
                    That does not concern you. You just 
                    get me in.

                                  ADAM
                    Call your boss.  Tell him I m 
                      cooperating with you now.  That I 
                    helped you get away from MI5 and

      She opens her mobile and starts to speak in Arabic. He 
      listens closely.

                    Anything from Adam?

      EXT. ENTRANCE TO GREAT HALL - DAY 3. 1705
7070

      People are milling about outside, waiting to go through a 
      cordon.  Security is very tight and everybody going in is 
      being thoroughly checked.  People are even having their heels 
      inspected.  Men with earpieces swivel their gaze from side to 
      side. Beside them, Adam seems small and insignificant.  He 
      whispers to a security man who talks into his radio.  Turns 
      to Khatera.

                                  ADAM
                    He s bringing the Special Branch 
                    Liaison Officer.

      They stand and watch the people going in and presenting their 
        credentials.  Khatera is increasingly nervous.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    Stop fidgeting you ll draw 
                    attention to yourself ... Mike!

      A Special Branch Liaison officer who Adam was going through 
      the list with earlier comes over grinning.  Adam claps him on 
      the back.


                                  MIKE
                    Adam, where s your lovely wife?

                    It s too late. 
                          (to Khatera)
                    I m very sorry.

                                  ADAM
                    Look, we ve got our suspicions 
                    about the background of one of the 
                    Iraqi bodyguards.  Think he might 
                    have been previously involved with 
                    torturing regime opponents. 
                    Khatera s the only one who can give 
                    us a positive ID on him.  Come on, 
                    Mike, give me a break here, this 
                    could be a huge breakthrough for 
                    us.


                                  MIKE
                    Just not possible.  All the 
                      credentials have to be cleared in 
                    advance.

                                  ADAM
                    And who would have cleared them?

                                  MIKE
                    You.

                                  ADAM
                    So ...

      He leans confidentially towards Mike.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    OK, so we miss an opportunity to 
                    identify a man who may turn out to 
                    become a key player in supplying 
                      information to Iraqi terror groups. 
                    This leads to the assassination of 
                    the political leaders who might 
                    bring peace to the country. And all 
                    because you thought that she...

      He indicates Khatera who seems timid and utterly 
      unthreatening.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    Might pose a threat. Especially 
                    when vouched for and accompanied by 
                    an equally dangerous member of the 
                    Security Services who you ve known 
                    for years. Come on, Mike...

      Mike hesitates.  Then he beckons two of the security men to 
      search them.  Khatera holds up her arms as he passes the 
      metal detectors over her and nods her through.

      Adam and Khatera make their way through into the hall.

                                    KHATERA
                    You re very good at deception.

      She checks her watch.

      Malcolm and Colin are working at their desks.  In another 
      part of the Grid Harry, Zafar and Ruth talk.

                    He s buying us some time.  The girl

                    But what do they plan to do?  She s 
                    unarmed.  And what do they need him 
                    for?

                                  RUTH

                                  ZAFAR
                            (thoughtful)
                    Maybe we ve been looking at this 
                    the wrong way round.

                                  HARRY

      Adam and Khatera are milling with the assembled guests.  The 
      place is full of people clutching tightly at their glasses of 
      warm chardonnay, the low murmur of liggers.  Khatera checks

                    He kept control over it so I

                    You can t do this.  It s too

                    You don t want to do this, Khatera.

                    I can t do that.

      More people are coming in.  Were Khatera to send a signal now 
      all of the people in the Great Hall would die.  She takes the 
      signalling device out of her pocket.


                                  ADAM
                    You heard what he did.  He pistol-
                    whipped my wife.  He murdered a 
                    young officer.  He s prepared to

      Khatera looks at Adam.  Her eyes are wild and confused.

      Khatera is still holding the signalling device and staring at 
      Adam. Around them security men start to move in and whisper 
      to the guests. 


      Adam is extremely calm and serene as he speaks. The only 
      thing which belies his tension is that he is turning the ring 
      on his wedding finger around.

      Khatera s holding the device and it s momentarily unclear 
      whether she s going to detonate it or give it to him.  

      Adam holds out his hand and for a moment their fingers touch. 
      Very gently he removes her fingers from around the signalling 
      device.  At that point he sees Zafar enter the room.  Zafar 
      keeps his distance, watching Adam, talking into a voice-com.

      Harry appears, watches them, decides not to intrude.  We stay 
                                                                                              *

      and unzips the bag as Harry arrives.  It s Danny.
                                                                                              *

      EXT. TERRORIST BASE - DAY 3. 1802

      Ruth is weeping over Danny s body his hand clasped in hers. 
      Harry stands looking grimly at the corpse.  



                                  RUTH
                    Oh no.

      Harry looks over to where a member of Special Forces is 
      gesturing to him.

                                  HARRY
                    Ruth, I have to leave you for a 
                    moment.

                                  RUTH
                    I m staying here with Danny.

                                  HARRY
                    Of course.

      She watches him walk towards the officer. 

                                  RUTH
                          (still in deep shock)
                    Harry s had to leave us for a 
                    moment.  But I ll stay here with 
                    you, I m still here with you, 
                    Danny, I m staying right here with 
                    you. 

      She caresses his hand.

      She looks up and sees Adam who is still holding Fiona 
                                                                                              *

      CONTINUED:

      A member of Special Forces comes over to Adam and Fiona. He 
                                                                                              *
      hands her the silver brooch.

                                    SPECIAL FORCES OFFICER
                    Is this yours?

      She takes it in her hand and they both look at it.

                                  ADAM
                    You might not have liked it but 
                    there was no need to just throw it 
                    away.

                                  FIONA
                    I didn t, Adam.

                                  ADAM
                    I know, sweetheart. I know.

      She turns the brooch around. 

                                  FIONA
                    I broke it.  

                                  ADAM
                    Picking locks. You were always good 
                    at that.

                                  FIONA
                    But I broke the brooch you gave me. 
                    Look, it s broken, it s broken, 
                    Adam.

      She starts to weep - obvious displacement grieving for Danny.

                                  ADAM
                    Shhh, darling.  The brooch will 
                    mend.

      And he holds her in his arms.  The helicopter takes off.  
                                                                                              **
      Harry is back with Ruth, we re on his face as he looks at 
      her.  His grief is tangible.  

      Then he puts his arm around her and we close on them 
      embracing while her hand still holds that of her fallen 
      colleague.
