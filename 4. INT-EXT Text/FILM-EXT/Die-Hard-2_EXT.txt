JOHN MCCLANE, long topcoat FLAPPING, comes running out of the
terminal towards an AIRPORT COP in plastic covered uniform who is
supervising a TOW TRUCK DRIVER who in turn is manhandling a
sedate sedan with Virginia plates and a "GRANDMOTHER ON BOARD"
sign on the rear window.
MCCLANE
I'm here, I'm here, false alarm, let's

MCCLANE
You don't understand, I'm just meeting

Sure. Tomorrow 8 to four, you pay

A plane TAKES OFF. We PULL BACK and realize we're in a MOTEL
ROOM. The TV is on and we SEE the TV PICTURE CHANGE to a
TROPICAL AIRFIELD. Khaki-clad heavily armed SOLDIERS form a
cordon as a stiff-backed handsome MAN of 60 in handcuffs and leg
chains is hustled aboard a plane.
2ND NEWSCASTER
Security was tight today at Escalon
airport in the Republic of Val Verde,
where government authorities escorted
General Ramon Esperanza to the
military transport that will bring
him to the United States to stand
trial for narcotics trafficking.
A HAND thrusts in front of the CAMERA - FINGERS clenching and
curling oddly.

A half naked MAN is doing Tai Ch'i EXERCISES. This is COLONEL
WILLIAM STUART, U.S.A. (Ret.) His body is hard, with SCARS from
knives and bullets.
On the TV, the words "FILE TAPE" blink under Esperanza's IMAGE,.
here resplendent in a Latin American uniform, reviewing troops in
the field and then moving to a table under a tarp to sign
documents with American military officers. He hands a COLONEL the
pen just used on the document - a souvenir.

(RAISING KNIFE)
I really liked you -
416 GRANT 416
too late, he realizes he's over the front edge of the wing! He
screams and FALLS -
417 NEW ANGLE 417
RIGHT INTO THE ENGINE INTAKE! There's an awful GRINDING SOUND -A
SCREAM - McClane winces as RED SNOW SPLATTERS HIM -
418 REAR OF ENGINE 418
it could be hamburger pouring out - but before we can dwell on
it, the engine pod BLOWS!
18A MCCLANE - ON THE WING 418A
wipes red snow from his arm.

MCCLANE
I like you better dead.
419 IN THE COCKPIT 419
a "FIRE" indicator goes on. Esperanza hits "EXTINGUISHER",
handles it - increases power to the other engines.
420 STUART 420
trying-to SEE - finally - a GLIMPSE of what has to be McClane
-with a savage grin, Stuart takes off his rifle - discards the
bulky coat - knife in hand, he steps out.
421 MCCLANE 421
moves hand over hand to a trailing section of the wing. Looks
over and down at
422 FUEL PORT - UPSIDE DOWN - HIS POV 422
-423 BACK TO SCENE 423
He reaches for it. Too far. Stretches. Gets it - fucker is
TIGHT. Wincing, he TURNS it a bit - then LOOKS up just in TIME
to SEE STUART, knife whizzing DOWN -
424 NEW ANGLE 424
McClane ROLLS, but the knife CATCHES his SHOULDER. In pain, he
manances to KICK Stuart's KNEE - Stuart FALLS, almost goes over
the wing - McClane goes back to work on the fuel port -it,TURNS
another 1/4 turn -and then he has to abandon it to deal with
another CHARGE from Stuart.
425 ESPERANZA 425
he TURNS the PLANE. Now he's ON THE RUNWAY PROPER.
426 MCCLANE AND STUART 426
FIGHTING for the knife. With.all his strength, McClane JAMS
Stuart's knife hand the aerilon crack! The next WIGGLE of the
metal CRUNCHES both hand and knife! Stuart SCREAMS and loosens
his grip on McClane, who PUNCHES him away, goes back to work
on the fuel port!
But he's hardly at it when Stuart RECOVERS, and, mangled hand
held clawlike, KICKS McClane's INJURED SHOULDER -KICKS AGAIN
-blood on Stuart's shoe - McClane is being worked over the edge
of the wing! He CATCHES at the last moment - now he IGNORES
Stuart's BLOWS, because -
427 UNDER THE WING 427
.McClane feels for the fuel port - turn, turn - it OPENS! Fuel
SPIGOTS DOWN - McClane feels the wetness on his hand -
428 THE RUNWAY 428
a RIBBON of FUEL twists behind the moving plane, slick and light
REFLECTING -
429 BACK TO SCENE 429
Stuart STOMPS on McClane's HANDS on the wing - CRUNCH -STOMPS
again - McClane SMILES -and then Stuart KICKS HIM OFF THE WING!
430 MCCLANE 430
DROPS 20 FEET, SLAMS into the snow at the edge of the runway,
bounces like litter thrown from a moving car - the big REAR TIRE
almost rolls over him -
431 STUART 431
with a victorious SHOUT he YANKS the coat from the aerilon,
throws it away - heads for the door -
112
432 ESPERANZA 432
sees this, smiles -
433 MCCLANE -AT EDGE OF RUNWAY 433
crawls to a painful sitting position. Face impassive, he watches
the jet move away... and - incongrous as it seems - he lights a
cigarette, looks off at - (X)
I
434 THE LINE OF JET FUEL 434
running along the runway for 1/4 mile now -
435 MCCLANE 435
battered like a car wreck victim, now he looks up into the dark
sky trying to find the SOUND OF JET ENGINES. Then he SEES -
436 LIGHTS OF HOLLY'S PLANE - HIS POV 436
careening down in a desperate fight, against gravity -
437 BACK TO SCENE 437
1 McClave takes a LONG PULL on the cigarette until the tip is
RED-HOT.
438 STUART - IN THE OPEN PLANE DOORWAY 438
about to close it, he looks back and for the first time SEES
439 THE JET FUEL - HIS POV 439
winding endlessly down the runway -
440 MCCLANE 440
MCCLANE
Hey, Colonel: Happy Fucking New Year.
And he THROWS THE CIGARETTE INTO THE FUEL.
441 STUART 441
SEES the flame RACING TOWARDS HIM - turns to SHOUT to Esperanza -
STUART
NO! NO! TAKE OFF! TAKE OFF NOW! (X)
442 ESPERANZA - IN COCKPIT 442
RESPONDS to the cry, GUNS IT - (X)
442A THE PLANE 442A
STARTS TO-RISE - the wheels go into the AIR - (X)
113
(X)
j j42B REAR OF PLANE 442B
But as the craft rises, so does the FLAME, climbing the fuel
ribbon RIGHT INTO THE SKY and TO THE NEAREST ENGINE which
EXPLODES!
442C ESPERANZA 442C
TURNS at the EXPLOSION in time for a WALL OF FIRE that SHOOTS UP
THE WING and through the cockpit FLOOR, and then he's ON FIRE
AND THEN
443 STUART 443
is BLOWN TO LITTLE PIECES as a FIREBALL BLOWS RIGHT OUT THE DOOR.,
taking all the remaining soldiers with it and then
444 THE PLANE - LONG SHOT 444
It EXPLODES ITSELF, WINGS and TAIL and BODY going nine different
directions!
445 OMITTED 445
446 MCCLANE 446
DIVES for the ground as the explosion ROLLS TOWARDS HIM.
447 IN THE CAB 4471
they watch the FIREBALL in the distance -
448 MCCLANE 448
Gets to his knees, and LOOKS at the huge conflagration.
MCCLANE
(towards the sky)
Honey... there's your landing lights.
CUT TO:
It descends, a bit erratic, but now it's ALONGSIDE the line of
fire, coming in from the wrong end of the runway, and then the
wheels BOUNCE, once, twice, and then a tire BLOWS but the pilots (X)
HOLD IT as it SWERVES and finally SKIDS TO A HALT, turning onto (X)
the grassy field.
Already we HEAR RESCUE SIRENS.
452 IN THE CAB 452
BARNES
(listening to headset)
One forty is down! They used the
fire to see -
(LAUGHING)
I -they used the fucking fire to see!
AN ENGINEER
They can all do that - let's tell
'EM -
TRUDEAU
They already know. Listen.
And sure enough, there it is - the SOUND of ENGINES -
And now the lights come down from the sky, in a neat and patient
row, the closest-filling the screen, the others dwindling down to
the size of stars.
454 MCCLANE - ON THE RUNWAY 454
Stumbles along, maybe thinking he's dead or dreaming... IGNORING
the giant PLANE LANDING BESIDE HIM, ignoring the FLAMES beyond
that - His concentration is totally on Holly's plane -now
another giant PLANE SKIDS down behind him - it's an assembly
line, like B-29's coming home from war - then he SEES what he's
praying for - breaks into a RUN -
MCCLANE
Holly - HOLLY -HOLLY!
455 HOLLY - IN PLANE DOOR 455
HEARS this just as she goes down the RESCUE CHUTE, ushed by
Stewardess controlling their own tears -
115
(X)
('.. 456 MCCLANE 456
CATCHES her at the bottom like a child - CARRIES HER AWAY.
457 THORNBERG - ON THE GROUND 457
groggy, he raises his hands in supplication to the stewardess.
She steps over him, puts her high heels back on - walks off.
CUT TO:
458 THE NEWS 'CHOPPER 458
It CRUNCHES DOWN on the frozen earth near the runway. Sam and
her cameraman hit the ground running. SEE -
459 MCCLANE AND HOLLY 459
embracing - and then she's nursing his wounds, hearing his story-
460 BACK TO SCENE 460
The cameraman brings up his lens.
CAMERAMAN
God, that's beautiful -
SAM
Yeah. It sure is.
And she yanks out his power cord, watches it dreamily.
461 THE AIRFIELD - NIGHT 461
as rolling stairs are put up to the planes and the passengers
pour down the steps into arms of friends, families, loved ones.
461A MCCLANE 461A
Sets Holly down, kisses her - then both TURN at a HONK.
Marvin is there in an airport cart. He looks at the chaos.
MARVIN
Damned if I'm cleaning up this mess.
McClane and Holly get in the cart. Marvin drives them away,
light BLINKING... and we PULLBACK until McClane and Holly are
just part of the crowd.
