4. MEDIUM SHOT
It is a pleasantly rural scene - with
just a handful of local characters scattered
about. At one end of the platform -
some mail - newspapers - and a few pieces
of freight are being loaded. Cedar,
Cobb and Anderson stand in front of
a welcome sign. The three obviously
are out of their element here - obviously
"City folks."
Over their shoulders. We hear Cobb's
voice as he reads:
COBB'S VOICE
Welcome to Mandrake Falls -
Where the scenery enthralls -
Where no hardship e'er befalls -
Welcome to Mandrake Falls.
5. MEDIUM SHOT
Cobb and Cedar exchange glances.
COBB
That's pretty.
CEDAR
Are you sure this is the town he lives
in?
ANDERSON
Yes sir, Mr. Cedar. This is the town
all right.
CEDAR
Well, I dropped everything at the office
- I hope it's not a wild goose chase.
ANDERSON
No, sir. We checked it thoroughly. He
lives here all right.
COBB
Ah! I spy a native. Let's ask him.
CAMERA MOVES WITH THEM as they cross
to a small, one-story old brick building,
covered with ivy. This is the ticket
and freight office combined. In front
of it is a very old man, a stoop-
? 338 ?
shouldered rail agent with a face of
a million wrinkles - puttering around
some packages.
CEDAR
(as they approach)
Good morning.
AGENT
(glances up)
Morning, neighbors. Morning.
He picks up a package and disappears
into the building. Cedar and Cobb look
at each other.
COBB
That's an excellent start. At least
we've broken the ice.
The old man returns to his pile of packages.
CEDAR
I say, my friend, do you know a fellow
by the name of Longfellow Deeds?
AGENT
Deeds?
CEDAR
Yes.
AGENT
Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows
Deeds.
CEDAR
Yes, I
He again disappears.
COBB
Must be a game he's playing.
The old man shows up again.
CEDAR
We'd like to get in touch with him.
It's very important.
AGENT
Who's that?
CEDAR
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking
about?
AGENT
Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic.
You won't have no trouble at all. Talk
to anybody.
Whereupon the old man carries another
package inside. Cobb is properly exasperated
now.
? 339 ?
CEDAR
I guess we'd better try somebody else.
COBB
No, we won't! The next time that jumping
jack comes out, I'll straddle him while
you ask him your questions.
The old man emerges from the building
and looks up at them as if he's never
seen them before.
AGENT
Morning, neighbors.
6. TWO SHOT - COBB AND AGENT (FEATURING
COBB)
Cobb grabs the old man as he turns to
head back into the building.
COBB
Remember us? We're the fellows who were
here a minute ago.
AGENT
Oh, yes. Yes, indeedy. I never forget
a face.
He turns again - but Cobb holds him
by the arm and sets him down on a small
packing case.
COBB
Listen, Pop, we've come all the way
from New York to look up a fellow by
the name of Deeds. It's important -
very important!
AGENT
(releasing his arm)
You don't have to get rough, neighbor.
All you got to do is ask.
COBB
Then please pretend, for just one fleeting
moment, that I'm asking. Where does
he reside?
AGENT
Who?
Cobb turns away in disgust. Anderson
steps forward.
7. CLOSE SHOT - THE THREE
ANDERSON
Longfellow Deeds - where does he live?
AGENT
Oh, that's what you want! Well, why
didn't you say so in the first place
instead of beating around the bush?
Those other fellows don't know what
they're talking about.
(as he exits scene)
Come on, I'll take you there in my car.
If they'd only explained to me what
they wanted, there would be no trouble.
He leaves Cobb and Cedar staring after
him killingly.
? 340 ?
DISSOLVE TO:
24. LONG SHOT
The whole town is out. The band is playing
"He's a Jolly Good Fellow" - the crowd
sings. It's a festive occasion. A large,
awkwardly painted sign looms over everyone's
head. It reads:
FAREWELL
LONGFELLOW DEEDS
THE PRIDE OF MANDRAKE FALLS
25. MEDIUM SHOT - CEDAR AND ANDERSON
They peer anxiously around, looking
for someone, when Cobb dashes in.
COBB
(breathlessly)
I can't find him.
CEDAR
You can't?
COBB
I looked everywhere. I even went to
his house. It's locked up.
ANDERSON
He probably had a change of heart.
CEDAR
He wasn't very anxious to come in the
first place.
COBB
(looking on)
Here comes the train.
Cedar glances off.
26. LONG SHOT (STOCK)
Of train approaching.
27. CLOSE SHOT - CEDAR AND COBB
The band has already begun and is now
in the midst of "For He's A Jolly Good
Fellow."
At this moment, as he looks off, a startled
expression comes into Cobb's eyes. He
grabs Cedar by the arm - who glances
in the direction he points.
COBB
Look!
CEDAR
What?
COBB
That tuba player!
? 348 ?
28. MEDIUM SHOT - THE BAND
With Longfellow, in his customary position,
blowing on his tuba.
CONTINUATION SCENE 27
Cedar and Cobb stare, wide-eyed, as
the song is finished.
COBB
Well, now I've seen everything.
DISSOLVE TO:
29. LONG SHOT
In the b.g. is the train with Longfellow
standing on the observation platform,
clutching his tuba. On either side of
him is Cedar and Cobb. In the f.g. the
crowd yells its farewell. Several of
them stuff baskets of fruit into his
hands. The band plays "Auld Lang Syne."
30. CLOSE SHOT
Over Longfellow and Cobb's shoulders.
As the train begins pulling out. Longfellow
smiles wanly and waves.
LONGFELLOW
Goodbye, Mrs. Meredith! Goodbye, Jim!
Bye, Buddy! Goodbye, everybody!
(a pause)
Gosh, I've got a lot of friends.
Cobb looks up into Longfellow's face
- affected by the scene.
DISSOLVE TO:
48. LONG SHOT
Of a large, imposing-looking residence.
74. MED. SHOT
Longfellow, exiting his bedroom, wearing
a coat and hat. He comes to the top
of a grand staircase, looks around slyly
and sees that no one is watching. He
slides down the bannister and touches
the statue at the bottom for good luck.
He starts for the door. When he gets
there he finds his way barred by two
husky-looking mugs. He looks up surprised.
FIRST BODYGUARD
Hey, you going out?
LONGFELLOW
Why yes. Isn't that all right?
2ND BODYGUARD
No. Don't ever want to go out without
telling us.
LONGFELLOW
Who are you?
BODYGUARDS
We're your bodyguards.
LONGFELLOW
Oh, yeah.
2ND BODYGUARD
Yeah, Mr. Cobb said stick to your tail
no matter what.
LONGFELLOW
That's very nice of Mr. Cobb - but I
don't want anybody sticking to my tail
no matter what.
FIRST BODYGUARD
Sorry, mister. Orders is orders.
LONGFELLOW
Is that so?
2ND BODYGUARD
Yes, sir. We gotta get you up in the
morning - and we gotta put you to bed
at night.
FIRST BODYGUARD
Only it's all right. No matter what
we see - we don't see nuttin', see?
LONGFELLOW
(smiling)
That's going to be fun.
2ND BODYGUARD
Some people like it.
Longfellow glances around the room thoughtfully,
then continues:
LONGFELLOW
Uh, will you do something for me before
we go out?
? 370 ?
FIRST BODYGUARD
Sure!
The first bodyguard eagerly takes out
a pistol. The second bodyguard slaps
it away.
2ND BODYGUARD
(to first bodyguard)
Put that away, slug!
(to Longfellow)
At your service!
LONGFELLOW
I got a trunk in that room. Will you
get it out for me?
2ND BODYGUARD
Certainly.
FIRST BODYGUARD
With pleasure.
The two bodyguards accommodatingly enter
a closet. The moment they are gone,
Longfellow closes the door calmly and
turns the key.
BODYGUARDS
(ad-lib)
Hey, hey! We're your bodyguards. You
can't do this!
Longfellow whistles as he exits.
DISSOLVE TO:
75. MED. CLOSE SHOT
Longfellow comes out, glances over the
horizon. The air is filled with a slight
drizzle and he sighs happily.
CUT TO:
77. MED. CLOSE SHOT
Longfellow is exiting front gate.
78. MED. SHOT
From his angle. Out of the shadows a
girl comes into view and staggers forward.
She reaches a tree and clutches it weakly.
Then her strength failing, she crumples
to the ground.
79. MED. CLOSE SHOT
Longfellow's eyes widen in apprehension
as he starts forward - CAMERA FOLLOWING
HIM. He reaches the girl and bending
down, lifts her head. We see it is Babe
Bennett. Her eyes are closed, apparently
in a dead faint.
80. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW AND BABE
- LOW ANGLE
Longfellow studies her face for a moment,
then starts to lift her. As he does
so, her eyes open and she looks up at
him, feigning bewilderment.
LONGFELLOW
You fainted.
BABE
(feebly)
Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .
She struggles to get to her feet.
81. WIDER ANGLE
Longfellow tries to assist her.
LONGFELLOW
Can I help you?
BABE
No, thank you. I'll be all right.
LONGFELLOW
Look, this is my house. I'd like to
BABE
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
LONGFELLOW
What happened?
BABE
Well, I guess I walked too much. I've
been looking for a job all day. I found
one, too. I start tomorrow.
? 372 ?
(backing away)
You've been awfully kind. Thank you
very much.
As she leaves him, Longfellow watches
her, full of sympathy. She takes a few
steps and, again feigning weakness,
falls against the iron fence, clutching
it. Longfellow rushes to her assistance.
82. CLOSE TWO SHOT
LONGFELLOW
(looking around)
Hey, taxi!
CUT TO:

121. CLOSE SHOT - BABE AND LONGFELLOW
Longfellow looks around, absorbed. Babe
watches him.
LONGFELLOW
It's awfully nice of you to show me
around like this.
BABE
I enjoy it.
LONGFELLOW
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in
New York, I'd go there every day. I'll
bet you do.
BABE
Well, I'd like to - but I have a job
to think of.
122. MED. CLOSE SHOT - A TAXI
Directly behind the bus. A man's head
is stuck out of taxi window. We recognize
it as one of the photographers, Bob.
BOB
(to driver)
Hey, flap-ears![11] You better keep
following that bus!
DRIVER'S VOICE
Keep your shirt on!
124. CLOSE SHOT - BABE AND LONGFELLOW
BABE
Got any news
(catches herself)
I mean, has anything exciting been happening
lately?
LONGFELLOW
Sure. I met you.
BABE
(laughs)
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
LONGFELLOW
Oh, that - well, we had another meeting.
I told them I'd go on being Chairman
if
(explaining)
I'm Chairman, you know.
BABE
Yes, I know.
LONGFELLOW
I told 'em I'd play along with them
if they lowered their prices - and cut
down expenses - and broadcast.
BABE
What did they say?
LONGFELLOW
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
BABE
What did they say?
LONGFELLOW
Huh? Oh. They said I was crazy. Said
I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
BABE
What are they going to do?
LONGFELLOW
(leans over close to her)
Do you always wear your hair like that?
125. WIDER SHOT
At this point, two girls pass by, chattering.
One girl has a paper open.
FIRST GIRL
Isn't it a scream - "Cinderella Man!"
The dope!
2ND GIRL
I'd like to get my hooks into that guy.
? 390 ?
FIRST GIRL
Don't worry. Somebody's probably taking
him for plenty.
They are gone. Longfellow glares after
them. Babe is afraid to look up.
LONGFELLOW
(quietly)
If they were men, I'd knock their heads
together.
Babe is silent. Longfellow watches her
for a moment.
126. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO
Favoring Longfellow.
LONGFELLOW
Have you seen the papers?
BABE
Uh-huh.
LONGFELLOW
That's what I like about you. You think
about a man's feelings. I'd like to
go down to that newspaper and punch
the fellow in the nose that's writing
that stuff
127. MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO
She looks up, startled.
LONGFELLOW
"Cinderella Man!" I guess pretty soon
everybody will be calling me "Cinderella
Man."
Babe has had an uncomfortable time of
it - and quickly changes the subject.
BABE
Would you like to walk the rest of the
way? It's so nice out.
LONGFELLOW
Yes.
BABE
Yeah, let's.
She jumps up from her seat, and Longfellow
follows.
129. MED. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW AND
BABE
He stands across the street from Grant's
Tomb, looking solemn. His eyes moist.
She is unaware of his emotion.
BABE
Come on, don't you want to see it?
139. MED. SHOT - LONGFELLOW AND BABE
From over their shoulders, looking down
on the lights and teeming activity of
Times Square.
BABE
There's Times Square.
LONGFELLOW
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
BABE
Why don't you try?
He does try. The wind blows it back
on him. She laughs, takes out a handkerchief
and wipes it off his coat.
BABE
(as she wipes)
Oh! It's breezy up here.
He doesn't say anything right away.
BABE
You're worried about those articles
they're writing about you, aren't you?
LONGFELLOW
I'm not worrying any more. I suppose
they'll go on writing them till they
get tired. You don't believe all that
stuff, do you?
A guilty look spreads over Babe's face.
BABE
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers,
you know.
LONGFELLOW
Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is
why people seem to get so much pleasure
out of hurting each other. Why don't
they try liking each other once in a
while?
An awkward pause.
BABE
Shall we go?
? 395 ?
DISSOLVE TO:
140. MED. TRUCKING SHOT

BABE

Here's a nice place.
LONGFELLOW
Yeah. Anyway, there aren't any photographers
around.
141. MEDIUM SHOT
Bob and Frank, sneaking around in the
bushes.
142. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW AND BABE
BABE
You know, you said something to me when
you first met me that I've thought about
a great deal.
LONGFELLOW
What's that?
BABE
You said I was a lady in distress.
LONGFELLOW
Oh, that
BABE
What did you mean by that?
LONGFELLOW
Nothing
There is a pause.
LONGFELLOW
Have you got a - are you - uh - engaged
or anything?
143. CLOSEUP - BABE
The corners of her mouth go up in sympathetic
amusement.
BABE
No. Are you?
LONGFELLOW'S VOICE
No.
BABE
You don't go out with girls very much,
do you?
LONGFELLOW'S VOICE
I haven't.
BABE
Why not?
? 396 ?
144. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO
Favoring Longfellow.
LONGFELLOW
Oh, I don't know.
BABE
You must have met a lot of swell society
girls since you've been here. Don't
you like them?
LONGFELLOW
I haven't met anybody here that I like,
particularly. They all seem to have
the St. Vitus Dance.[12]
(awkwardly)
Except you, of course.
(a pause)
People here are funny. They work so
hard at living - they forget how to
live
(thoughtfully; leans back)
Last night, after I left you, I was
walking along and looking at the tall
buildings and I got to thinking about
what Thoreau said. They created a lot
of grand palaces here - but they forgot
to create the noblemen to put in them.
145. REVERSE ANGLE
Favoring Babe. She stares at him curiously.
LONGFELLOW
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.
BABE
I'm from a small town too, you know.
LONGFELLOW
(interested)
Really?
BABE
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
LONGFELLOW
(finding a kindred soul)
Gosh! What do you know about that!
Babe leans her head back in a reminiscent
mood. We get a feeling that, for the
moment, she has forgotten she is Babe
Bennett, out on a story.
BABE
Ah, it's a beautiful little town, too.
A row of poplar trees right along Main
Street. Always smelled as if it just
had a bath.
146. MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO
Longfellow watches her face intently.
BABE
I've often thought about going back.
? 397 ?
LONGFELLOW
You have?
BABE
Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun
there when I was a little girl. I used
to love to go fishing with my father.
That's funny. He was a lot like you,
my father was. Talked like you, too.
Sometimes he'd let me hold the line
while he smoked - and we'd just sit
there for hours. And after awhile, for
no reason, I'd go over and kiss him
and sit in his lap. He never said very
much but once I remember him saying:
"No matter what happens, honey, don't
complain."
LONGFELLOW
He sounds like a person worth while
knowing.
There is a pause while Longfellow watches
her, and she is lost in thought.
BABE
(continuing)
He played in the town band, too.
LONGFELLOW
He did? I play the tuba
BABE
Yeah, I know.
LONGFELLOW
What did he play?
BABE
The drums. He taught me to play some.
LONGFELLOW
He did?
BABE
Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would
you like to hear me?
LONGFELLOW
(enthusiastically)
Sure!
147. MEDIUM SHOT
She picks up a couple of branches. With
the two sticks she drums on the bench
seat - and sings "Swanee River."
When she is finished, though clearly
delighted, he shows her a long face
of mock-disappointment.
BABE
Oh, I suppose you could do better.
LONGFELLOW
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
? 398 ?
BABE
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even
know how it goes.
LONGFELLOW
Sure. Look! You sing it over again,
and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
BABE
It had better be good.
She starts again, and he sings "Humoresque"
in counterpoint to her drumming.
CUT TO:
148. CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND FRANK
They wait with their camera. When they
hear the singing, they look up, and
then at each other in surprise.
BOB
I wonder if they'd want to make it a
quartet.
FRANK
Shhh!
149. MEDIUM SHOT
Longfellow and Babe. They are having
a grand time with their singing. A policeman
saunters into the scene and stands watching
them for a few seconds, without their
being conscious of his presence. He
smiles, shakes his head and passes on
out of scene. Over the shot we hear
the low moan of a siren in the distance.
150. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO
They reach the climax of their song
- and laugh joyously. At this moment,
the shrieking of the siren is nearer
and louder. Longfellow looks up quickly.
Excited, he jumps up and runs toward
street. Babe looks up, surprised.
LONGFELLOW
(as he runs off)
Fire engine! Fire engine! I want to
see how they do it. Wait for me, will
you?
151. CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND FRANK BEHIND
BUSHES
Frank grabs the camera.
FRANK
Looks like the evening is not going
to be wasted!
152. MEDIUM SHOT
They dash by the policeman, who looks
up, startled.
153. LONG SHOT
As the fire engine slows down - and
people are beginning to gather. We see
Longfellow running toward the truck
and hopping aboard.

As they walk slowly down the front steps.
LONGFELLOW
The reason why I wanted to take a walk,
Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to
you.
BABE
Let's just walk, okay?
LONGFELLOW
All right.
188. CLOSE TRUCKING SHOT
As they walk along a foggy street, on
their faces.
LONGFELLOW
Mary, I'm going home.
BABE
Are you? When?
LONGFELLOW
In a day or so, I think.
BABE
I don't blame you.
189. CLOSE TWO SHOT
Continuing on them, as they slowly walk
around the block.
LONGFELLOW
A man ought to know where he fits in.
I just don't fit in around here. I once
had an idea I could do something with
the money, but they kept me so busy
here, I haven't had time to figure it
out. I guess I'll wait till I get back
home.
There is a long pause. Both lost in
their own thoughts.
LONGFELLOW
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary?
You don't have to pay any attention
to me.
BABE
No, I don't mind.
LONGFELLOW
All my life, I've wanted somebody to
talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always
used to talk to a girl.
BABE
A girl?
LONGFELLOW
Oh, an imaginary one. I used to hike
a lot through the woods and I'd always
take this girl
? 412 ?
with me so I could talk to her. I'd
show her my pet trees and things. Sounds
kind of silly but we had a lot of fun
doing it.
(smiling)
She was beautiful.
(then moodily)
I haven't married 'cause I've been kinda
waiting. You know, my mother and father
were a great couple. I thought I might
have the same kind of luck. I've always
hoped that some day that imaginary girl
would turn out to be real.
They have arrived back at the front
steps of Babe's home.
LONGFELLOW
Well, here we are again.
BABE
Yes, here we are again.
(after a pause)
Good night.
LONGFELLOW
(then, quickly - his voice faltering)
Mary - I - excuse me
190. CLOSE TWO SHOT
Favoring Babe. She cuts him off, her
voice shaking.
BABE
Goodbye, darling. Don't let anybody
hurt you again - ever. They can't anyway.
You're much too real. You go back to
Mandrake Falls. That's where you belong
- goodbye!
191. WIDER ANGLE
She runs up the steps.
LONGFELLOW
Mary
She stops and turns. He walks up close
to her.
192. CLOSER SHOT - THE TWO
LONGFELLOW
You know the poem I told you about?
It's finished.
His hand goes to his breast pocket -
and then slowly is withdrawn - without
bringing out the poem.
LONGFELLOW
Would you like to read it? It's to you.
BABE
(scarcely audible)
Yes, of course.
He now takes the poem out. The paper
is folded. He hands it to her and she
slowly unfolds it. Just as she is about
to read Longfellow lays a hand on her
arm.
? 413 ?
LONGFELLOW
(a little frightened)
You don't have to say anything, Mary.
You can tell me tomorrow what you think.
She looks into his eyes, but does not
respond. Then she holds the paper up
and begins reading. Longfellow watches
her anxiously.
193. CLOSEUP - BABE
Reading softly:
BABE
"I tramped the earth with hopeless beat
- Searching in vain for a glimpse of
you. Then heaven thrust you at my very
feet, A lovely angel - too lovely to
woo."
The last words come with difficulty.
Babe's eyes are slowly welling up.
194. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO
Babe continues reading:
BABE
"My dream has been answered, but my
life's just as bleak,
I'm handcuffed and speechless in your
presence divine -
For my heart longs to cry out, if it
only would speak,
'I love you, my angel - be mine, be
mine.' "
Her voice is choked when she finishes.
She does not look up until she refolds
the paper. He stands close to her, waiting
expectantly. Finally, she glances up.
Her cheeks are moist, and her face clouded.
Impulsively, she throws her arms around
his neck, kissing him.
BABE
Oh, darling!
Longfellow's arms encircle her and for
a few moments they remain in an emotional
embrace.
LONGFELLOW
(huskily)
You don't have to say anything now.
I'll wait till tomorrow - till I hear
from you.
195. CLOSEUP - BABE
Her eyes are beset with fears. She loves
him - but knows how hopeless it all
is. She slowly starts freeing herself
from his embrace.
196. MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO
As Babe, weeping softly, frees herself
from his embrace.
Longfellow gives a yelp of joy and leaps
down the steps. He trips over a garbage
pail and bumps into passersby, making
a racket as he zigzags down the street
and out of scene.
? 414 ?
A VOICE
(shouting)
Hey, what's the big idea?
FADE OUT:
FADE IN
223. CLOSE SHOT
At the table that was all set for Babe.
The man sits, eating. He seriously bends
over his food. Longfellow sits opposite
him - his eyes glued on the man, absorbed
in profound thought.

(tentatively)
Can I take some of this home with me?
Longfellow nods.
