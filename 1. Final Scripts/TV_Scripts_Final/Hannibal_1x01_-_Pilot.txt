                                          TEASER

      CLOSE ON - WILL GRAHAM

      A handsome, haunted man with a naive focus.  REFLECTIVE LIGHT 
      flashes across his face, lighting up his eyes.  All SOUND IS 
      DULLED as if his ears were blocked, the AMBIENT NOISE of 
      Will s circulatory system provides an organic hum.  He stares 
      into middle-distance as CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL we are --

      INT. HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

      Arterial spray splashes a wall near a blood-soaked carpet.  
      Through the windows we see DOZENS OF OFFICERS and as many 
      POLICE CARS.  A CRIME-SCENE PHOTOGRAPHER takes pictures.  A 
      team of CORONERS remove TWO BODIES -- THERESA and THOMAS 
      MARLOW, both 30s/40s.  A tableau of horrible violence.

      Will Graham sits serenely amongst the carnage on a yoga mat.  
      VARIOUS PIECES OF EVIDENCE surround him:  a DIGI-PIC of a 
      woman s neck marred by a bloody boot heel footprint; a SMALL 
      EVIDENCE BAG CONTAINING TERRYCLOTH FIBERS; INCIDENT REPORTS.

      A POLICE OFFICER and SUITED DETECTIVE herd the Crime-Scene 
        Photographer and the remaining team of Coroners out the door.

      Will Graham takes a breath, exhales, then closes his eyes.

      A PENDULUM

      It swings in the darkness of Will Graham s mind, keeping 
      rhythm with his heart beat.  FWUM.  FWUM.  FWUM.  

      ON WILL GRAHAM

      His eyes are closed.  The PENDULUM is now outside his head.  
      It swings behind Will, wiping away in its wake the gush of 
      arterial spray from the wall.  FWUM.  The PENDULUM swings on 
      the other side of the window, wiping away the OFFICERS and 
      POLICE CARS in front of the house.  FWUM.  The PENDULUM 
      swings across the stained carpet lifting the blood.  FWUM.  
      The PENDULUM swings across the blood spattered SECURITY KEY 
      PAD and the rust-colored dried drops vanish.  FWUM.

      (NOTE: The PENDULUM is a stylistic device, our REVERSE 
      METRONOME rewinding Will to a TIME BEFORE THE MURDERS.)

      The crime scene has now been decriminalized in Will s mind.                                                                                      2.


      Will Graham opens his eyes and stands, turns and walks 
      BACKWARDS toward the front door (which shows signs of a 
      violent forced entry), opening it behind him, back-stepping 
      outside before closing it again.  CAMERA REVEALS THE DOOR IS 
      NOW PRISTINE, PRE-FORCED ENTRY.

      EXT. HOME - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS - WILL S P.O.V.

      Will walks backward out the front door, across the lawn, over 
      the sidewalk.  He is alone in the neighborhood in his P.O.V.

      ON WILL S FEET - OMNISCIENT P.O.V.

      He walks backward past the LEGS OF DOZENS OF POLICE OFFICERS 
      and OFFICIALS, between the TIRES OF POLICE CARS.  

      POP WIDE - OMNISCIENT P.O.V.

      The Police Officers, Detectives, Coroners and Crime-Scene 
      Specialists all part or stand by, averting their eyes as they 
      intentionally avoid looking at Will Graham backwards walking 
      through them toward the shadowy yard across the street.

      A Police Officer breaks protocol and sneaks a peek at Will.  
      A SUPERIOR OFFICER snaps and points at the Officer, who 
      quickly fixes his gaze on the ground in front of his feet.

      THE PENDULUM

      It continues to rhythmically FWUM-FWUM-FWUM through the scene 
      giving GLIMPSES between OMNISCIENT P.O.V. and WILL S P.O.V.

      ON WILL - WILL S P.O.V.

      The street is empty.  The PENDULUM STOPS SWINGING, snapping 
      into place as Will snaps into focus.  He watches the quiet 
      house (he just back-walked out of) from across the street.  
      Through the partially curtained windows, he can see the 
      silhouettes of (still living) Theresa and Thomas Marlow.

      Will watches them for a long moment, taking in their 
        domesticity, then walks with purpose for the front door.

      OVERHEAD SHOT- OMNISCIENT P.O.V.

      The crowd of Officers, Detectives, Coroners and Specialists 
      parts to allow Will Graham a direct path.

      ON WILL - WILL S P.O.V.

      He marches to the front door and VIOLENTLY KICKS IT IN.  The 
      HOME SECURITY ALARM BLARES.  Thomas Marlow rushes down the 
      stairs, two steps at a time, moving to intercept Will.                                                                                      3.


      Will raises a TOWEL-WRAPPED ARM.  Thomas realizes too late 
      that it s concealing a GUN.  Will SHOOTS HIM TWICE THROUGH 
      THE NECK.  The FIRED SHOTS, ENTRY WOUNDS, EXIT WOUNDS, and 
      PLUMES OF TERRYCLOTH DEBRIS are all QUICK CUT SLOW MOTION.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    I shoot Mr. Marlow twice, severing 
                    jugulars and cartoids with near 
                    surgical precision.  He will die 
                    watching me take what is his away 
                    from him.  This is my design.

      Theresa Marlow is frantically pushing the panic code into the 
      HOME SECURITY KEY PAD when Will SHOOTS HER expertly THROUGH 
      THE THROAT, missing her jugular, BREAKING HER NECK and 
      peppering the KEY BAD with her blood.  The flow is much less 
      dramatic than it was with her husband.  Regardless, she drops 
      to the floor like a rag doll, instantly paralyzed.

                                  WILL GRAHAM (CONT D)
                    I shoot Mrs. Marlow expertly 
                    through the neck.  This is not a 
                    fatal wound.  The bullet misses 
                    every artery.  She is paralyzed 
                    before it leaves her body.  Which 
                    doesn t mean she can t feel pain.  
                    It just means she can t do anything 
                    about it.  This is my design.

      Will finishes punching in  OFF  on the ALARM CODE and the 
      BLARING HOME SECURITY ALARM is mercifully silenced.  The 
      PHONE IMMEDIATELY RINGS.  Will picks it up.

                                  VOICE ON TELEPHONE
                    This is DDT Security.  Who am I 
                    speaking with?

      Will hangs up the phone, breaking character as he asks:

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    I need the Incident Report from the 
                    Home Security company.

      CAMERA REVEALS Will is now holding the Incident Report.

                                  WILL GRAHAM (CONT D)
                          (perusing the report)
                    This was recorded as a false alarm.  
                    There was a false alarm last week.
                          (then)
                    He tapped their phone.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:                                                                                      4.


      EXT. HOUSE - TELEPHONE POLE - NIGHT - OMNISCIENT P.O.V.

      A PHONE COMPANY REPAIRMAN has climbed to the top of the 
      telephone pole and is examining an open CUSTOMER SERVICE BOX.

                                  PHONE COMPANY REPAIRMAN
                    Yup.

                                                                    SMASH BACK TO:

      INT. HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - WILL S P.O.V.

      As before, Will holds the land line in one hand and his own 
      smart phone in the other.  

                                  VOICE ON TELEPHONE
                    This is DDT Security.  Who am I 
                    speaking with?

      Will holds his SMART PHONE to the phone receiver as he 
      watches Theresa Marlow bleed to death, paralyzed by the shot 
      through her neck, unable to say a word.  He presses a button:

                                  SMART PHONE THERESA
                    Theresa Marlow.

                                  VOICE ON TELEPHONE
                    Can you please confirm your 
                    password for security purposes.

                                  SMART PHONE THERESA
                          (another button)
                    Tea kettle.

                                  VOICE ON TELEPHONE
                    Thank you, Mrs. Marlow.  We 
                    detected a front door alarm.

                                  SMART PHONE THERESA
                          (another button)
                    Yes, that was me.  That was my 
                    fault.  Sorry about that.

                                  VOICE ON TELEPHONE
                    Is there anyone in the house with 
                    you at this time, Mrs. Marlow?

                                  SMART PHONE THERESA
                          (another button)
                    I m just here with my husband.  
                    It s all good.  We re good.                                                                                      5.


                                  VOICE ON TELEPHONE
                    Do you require any further 
                      assistance at this time?

                                  SMART PHONE THERESA
                          (another button)
                    No.  Thank you so much for calling.  
                    Sorry about the false alarm.

      Will hangs up and looks sympathetically at Theresa Marlow.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    And this is where it gets truly 
                      horrifying for Mrs. Marlow.

      INT. F.B.I. ACADEMY - LECTURE HALL - DAY

      Will Graham lectures a CLASSROOM OF F.B.I. TRAINEES.  A 
      CHRYON tells us we are --

      F.B.I. ACADEMY, QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

                                  WILL GRAHAM 
                    Everyone has thought about killing 
                    someone one way or another.  Be it 
                    your own hands or the hand of God. 
                    Now think about killing Mrs. Marlow. 

      WILL S P.O.V. - THE TRAINEES

      He surveys the lecture hall for social appearances.  The 
      Trainee s eyes are always OUT OF FRAME, at most we glimpse 
      brows, lids, the occasional lash -- but never eye contact.

                                  WILL GRAHAM (CONT D)
                    Why did she deserve this?  Tell me 
                    your design.  Tell me who you are.

      INT. F.B.I. ACADEMY - HALLWAY - ON JACK CRAWFORD S BACK

      He walks down the corridor toward Will Graham s lecture hall.

      INT. F.B.I. ACADEMY - LECTURE HALL - DAY

      JACK CRAWFORD (weathered, austere, strongly built late 40s) 
      ENTERS as the TRAINEES file out of the classroom.  There are 
      scattered SMITTEN GLANCES tossed Will Graham s direction, who 
      is naturally oblivious because he is actively avoiding eye-
      contact with everyone, even as he warns his exiting students:                                                                                      6.


                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    The sad, dull truth of these crimes 
                    is they can usually be reduced to a 
                    male penetrative control issue.  I am 
                    expecting a higher level of scrutiny.

      The last of the TRAINEES EXITS and Will notices he s alone in 
      his lecture hall with the weathered, austere man.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Mr. Graham.

      Will quickly puts on a pair of glasses as Jack approaches.

      INCLUDE: WILL S P.O.V. - JACK CRAWFORD

      The TOP RIM OF WILL S GLASSES are strategically positioned to 
      BLOCK JACK S EYES and prevent direct eye-contact.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD (CONT D)
                    I m Special Agent Jack Crawford.  I 
                    lead the Behavioral Science Unit.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    We ve met.

      Jack knows full well they ve met but didn t intend to broach.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Yes, we had a disagreement about 
                    the museum when we opened it.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                      I disagreed with what you named it.  

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    The Evil Minds Research Museum?  

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    It s a little hammy, Jack.

      Jack likes Will s directness and returns the favor:

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    You ve hitched your horse to a 
                    teaching post.  I understand it s 
                    not easy for you to be sociable.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    I m just talking at them.  I m not 
                    listening to them.  It s not social.  

      Jack gently pushes Will s glasses up the bridge of his nose 
      so he s forced to make fleeting eye contact.                                                                                      7.


                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Where do you fall on the spectrum?

      Will picks up the rhythm and syntax of Jack s voice:

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    My horse is hitched to a post 
                    closer to Aspergers and Autistics 
                    than narcissists and sociopaths.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    But you can empathize with 
                      narcissists and sociopaths.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    I can empathize with anybody.  Less 
                    to do with personality disorders 
                    than an active imagination.

      Jack smiles at that, leans in, then:

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Can I borrow your imagination?

      EXT. F.B.I. ACADEMY GROUNDS - QUANTICO, VIRGINIA - DAY

      CAMERA FOLLOWS Jack Crawford leading Will Graham across a 
      field of TRAINEES on a FIRING RANGE as another GROUP OF 
      TRAINEES in matching sweats jogs by.  A ROW OF SIGNS mounted 
      on a post read:  Hurt,   Agony,   Pain,   Love it,   Pride. 

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Eight girls from eight different 
                    Minnesota campuses abducted in the 
                    last eight months. 

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    I thought there were seven.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    There were.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    When did you tag the eighth?

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    About three minutes before I walked 
                    into your lecture hall.  

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    You re calling them  abductions  
                    because you have no bodies?                                                                                      8.


                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    We have nothing.  No bodies.  No 
                    parts of bodies.  Nothing that 
                    comes out of a body.  We have 
                    lonely swabs in used evidence kits.

                    Then those girls weren t taken from 
                    where you think they were taken.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Where were they taken from?

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    I don t know.  Someplace else.

      The FIRING RANGE ERUPTS into a BARRAGE OF GUN SHOTS.

      INT. F.B.I. ACADEMY - DAY

      Jack and Will move through a maze of TRAINEES in matching 
      khakis and polos assembling and disassembling their firearms.  
      They continue into a CORRIDOR, where Jack calls call an 
      ELEVATOR by tapping the DOWN ARROW BUTTON, which illuminates.

      INT. F.B.I. ACADEMY - BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE SERVICES - DAY

      The ELEVATOR OPENS and as Will follows Jack through the 
      corridor, he notices the entire demographic of the Academy 
      has changed.  Gone are the matching khakis, polos, and sweats 
      of the TRAINEES.  Everyone down here is wearing a suit.

      INT. F.B.I. ACADEMY - JACK CRAWFORD S OFFICE - DAY

      Jack TACKS an EIGHTH BLUE SQUARE to the map and hands a 
      SENIOR PROM PORTRAIT of Emily Nichols to Will.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    Number eight?                                                                                      9.


                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Emily Nichols.  St. Cloud State 
                      University on the Mississippi.  

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    One through seven are dead, don t 
                    you think?  He s not keeping them 
                    around.  Got himself a new one.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                          (agreeing)
                    We re focusing on Emily Nichols.

      Will takes in the smiling hopeful faces next to BLUE SQUARES.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    They all look like Mall of America.  
                    That s a lot of wind-chaffed skin.  

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Same hair color.  Same eye color.  
                    Roughly same age, height, weight.  
                    What is it about all these girls?

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    It s not about all of these girls.  
                    It s about one of them.  

      He pins Emily Nichols  photo next to the EIGHTH BLUE SQUARE.

                                  WILL GRAHAM (CONT D)
                    Or none of them.  And it s about a 
                    girl who hasn t been taken yet.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    He s warming up for his special gal 
                    or reliving whatever he did to her.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    Special gal wouldn t be the first 
                    taken and she wouldn t be the last.  
                    He would hide how special she is.  
                    I mean, I would.  Wouldn t you?

      Jack eyes him for a moment, then:

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    I d like you to get closer to this.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    You have Heimlich at Harvard and 
                    Bloom at University of Chicago.  
                    They do the same thing I do.                                                                                    10.


                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    That s not really true, is it?  You 
                    have a specific way of thinking.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    Has there been a lot of discussion 
                    about the specific way I think?

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    You make jumps you don t explain.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    The evidence explains.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Then help me find some evidence.

      Will studies the beautiful milquetoast faces on the map.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    That may require me to be sociable.

      INT. ST. CLOUD STATE UNIVERSITY - DORM COMMON ROOM - NIGHT 

      Will Graham and Jack Crawford address a DOZEN MINNESOTA 
      GIRLS.  The pleasant, wind-chaffed milquetoast young ladies 
      are gathered around a sectional couch, sitting and standing.  
      Among the most vocal are DIEDRE, MARLA, STEPH, and BECKY.

      A CHRYON tells us we are:

      ST. CLOUD STATE UNIVERSITY, ST. CLOUD, MINNESOTA

                                  STEPH
                    They said she didn t leave campus.  
                    Not alive anyway.  Or on her own 
                    violation or whatever you call it.

                                  MARLA
                    I was here when she left the floor.  
                    I saw her get in the elevator.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    Volition.

                                  BECKY
                    Her car s still in the parking lot.  
                    It was here all weekend.

                                  DIEDRE
                    She was supposed to leave Friday 
                    night.  She was going to house-sit 
                    for her parents.  Feed their cat.                                                                                    11.


      Will has a subtle reaction to that.  

                                  BECKY
                    This is making my throat close up.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    I know, right? 

      Jack clocks Will speaking in a striking, yet subtle mirroring 
      of the girl s youthful cadence that he quickly suppresses.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Emily Nichols didn t just disappear 
                    into thin air somewhere between 
                    this elevator and the parking lot.  
                    It was orchestrated.  It was 
                    planned and probably rehearsed.  

      That seems to focus the Minnesota girls for the moment.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD (CONT D)
                    Did Emily ever mention meeting 
                    someone or being approached?  Did 
                    you see her with anybody unusual?

                                  DIEDRE
                    I m her suite mate.  I ve only ever 
                    seen her studying and frying Spam.  
                    I know she didn t have a boyfriend.

                                  MARLA
                    Do you know what he s doing with 
                    them?  The girls he s taking?

                                  STEPH
                          ( duh )
                    He s raping and murdering them.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    We have no evidence of that.

                                  MARLA
                    It could be a sex slave ring.

                                  STEPH
                    That s still rape and murder.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    We believe this is an individual.

                                  BECKY
                    Like Ted Bundy?                                                                                      12.


                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    Like Willy Wonka.  Every young 
                    woman he takes is a candy bar.  But 
                    hidden amongst all those candy bars 
                    is the one, true intended victim, 
                    which if we follow through on the 
                    metaphor, would be our Golden 
                    Ticket.  We identify the Golden 
                    Ticket, we can identify Willy.  

      Jack stares at Will then clarifies to the young women:

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    This man is very good at what he 
                    does.  He will do it again.

                                  BECKY
                    He already took a girl from St. 
                    Cloud s so the rest of us are safe.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    Not if you re the Golden Ticket.

      The young woman stares a perplexed moment before her face 
      crumples like an old apple doll, emotionally confused.

      EXT. MR. AND MRS. NICHOLS  HOME - NIGHT

      Establishing.  A CHYRON tells us we are --

      DULUTH, MINNESOTA

      ON MR. AND MRS. NICHOLS

      Emily s PARENTS.  They are sick with worry.  Mr. Nichols is 
      rationalizing while Mrs. Nichols seems almost resigned.

                                  MR.  NICHOLS
                    She could have gone off by herself.  
                    She was a very interior young 
                    woman.  She didn t like living in a 
                    dorm.  I could see how the pressure 
                    of school might have gotten to her.  
                    She likes trains.  Maybe she just 
                    got on a train and...

      We are --

      INT. MR. AND MRS. NICHOLS  HOME - NIGHT

      Will Graham and Jack Crawford sit opposite Mr. and Mrs. 
      Nichols as he trails off.  Hard to convince even himself.  
      Will continues to avoid eye contact with the Nichols.                                                                                    13.


                                  MRS. NICHOLS
                    She looks like the other girls.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    She fits the profile.

                                  MR.  NICHOLS
                    Could Emily still be alive?

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    We simply have no way of knowing.

        A previously silent Will Graham offers an odd question:

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    How s the cat?

                                  MRS. NICHOLS
                    What?

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    How s your cat?  Emily was supposed 
                    to feed it.  Was the cat weird when 
                    you came home?  It didn t eat all 
                    weekend.  Must have been hungry.

      The Nichols are initially unsure how to respond, then:

                                  MR.  NICHOLS
                    I didn t notice.

      Will mulls that a moment.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    He took her from here.
                          (off Jack s look)
                    She got on a train.  She came home.  
                    She fed the cat.  And he took her.

      Jack doesn t hesitate to pull out his phone and dial.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                          (to phone)
                    The Nichols house is a crime scene.  
                    I need ERT immediately.  Zeller, 
                    Katz, Jimmy Price, a photographer.  

      The Nichols are trying to wrap their minds around the quick 
      flurry of action and what it means to their little girl.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    Can I see your daughter s room?                                                                                    14.


                                  MRS. NICHOLS
                    Police were up there this morning.

      EMILY NICHOLS  CLOSED BEDROOM DOOR

      Mr. Nichols leads Will, who pulls on gloves as they approach.  
      Will warily eyes the CAT pawing at the door eager to go 
      inside.  Will stops Mr. Nichols from reaching the door knob.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    I ll get that.  Mr. Nichols, would 
                    you put your hands in your pockets 
                    and avoid touching anything please?

                                  MR.  NICHOLS
                    We been in and out of here all day.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    You can hold the cat if it s easier.

      Mr. Nichols picks up the cat as instructed.  Will wraps a 
      gloved hand around the knob and opens the door.

      EMILY NICHOLS  BEDROOM

      The light from the hallway streaks across the floor and up 
      the wall as Will ENTERS.  He stands just inside the door, 
      immediately noticing the OPEN WINDOW.  He flicks on the light 
      switch, illuminating the room.  He stares.

      EMILY NICHOLS

      She lays coffin-style in her bed, dressed in pajamas as if 
      she had JUST gone to sleep.  The gray pallor of her skin, the 
      clean PUNCTURE WOUNDS visible under her pajamas, and her un-
      breathing bosom are immediately evident to Will.  Sadly, Mr. 
      Nichols fails to notice.  Blinded by hope, he steps forward.

                                  MR.  NICHOLS
                    Emily?

      Will raises a gloved hand, stopping Mr. Nichols.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    I need you to leave the room.

      Realizing the worst, Mr. Nichols abruptly drops the cat.

                                        ACT TWO

      ON WILL GRAHAM

      Jack Crawford steps INTO FRAME, speaking quietly:

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    You re all wired.  You talk it out 
                    to us when you feel like it, don t 
                    say anything when you don t feel 
                    like it.  Take as long as you want.  
                    We will come in when you tell us.

      Will nods.  Jack stands and EXITS FRAME.  

      REFLECTIVE LIGHT flashes across Will s face, lighting up his 
      eyes.  All SOUND IS DULLED as if his ears were blocked, the 
      AMBIENT NOISE of Will s circulatory system provides an 
      organic hum.  CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL we are --

      INT. EMILY NICHOLS  BEDROOM - NIGHT

      The CRIME-SCENE PHOTOGRAPHER takes pictures.  JIMMY PRICE 
      (50s, frail, focused) dusts the window for fingerprints.  
      BEVERLY KATZ (30s, bright-eyed yet weary) combs for hairs and 
      fibers.  BRIAN ZELLER (late 20s, hair thinning) shines a 
      light under Emily s box spring, exposing a cracked bed board.  
      Jack Crawford herds Price, Katz and Zeller out the door.

      INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

      Will scoops up water in his hands from the faucet in the sink 
      to wash down the last two Bufferin from his now empty bottle.  
      He splashes water on his face, dries it with his shirttail. 

      EXT. EMILY NICHOLS  BEDROOM - SECOND FLOOR WINDOW

      Will Graham has climbed out the window onto the porch roof.  
      He sits on the gritty shingles.  He hugs his knees, his damp 
      shirt pressed cold across his back.  He snorts the night air 
      to cleanse the smell of Emily Nichols death from his nose.

      From his vantage point, he can see POLICE OFFICERS, POLICE 
      CARS and other CRIME SCENE SPECIALISTS assembled on the lawn.  
      Mr. and Mrs. Nichols are treated in the back of an Ambulance.

      Will Graham takes a breath, exhales, then closes his eyes.

      A PENDULUM

      It swings in the darkness of Will Graham s mind, keeping 
      rhythm with his heart beat.  FWUM.  FWUM.  FWUM.                                                                                      16.


      ON WILL GRAHAM - WILL S P.O.V.

      He OPENS HIS EYES and he is standing outside Emily Nichols  
      Bedroom Window.  The neighborhood is quiet and empty.  No 
      Police.  No Police Cars.  No Ambulance.

      He looks through the face-less reflection of himself in the 
      window glass to Emily Nichols sleeping soundly in her bed.  
      Will quietly opens the window and climbs inside.

      INT. EMILY NICHOLS  BEDROOM - NIGHT - WILL S P.O.V.

      Will stands over Emily Nichols, very much alive.  He watches 
      her for a quiet moment.  Tears well in Will s eyes, then...

      Will bears down on Emily s chest with his knee, cracking ribs 
      as he simultaneously squeezes her throat shut with his hands.  
      It s sudden and horrible and violent.  Emily is immediately 
      startled out of a deep sleep into terror.

      Emily struggles, her face swelling with pressure, capillaries 
      in her skin and the whites of her eye WRINKLE and BURST.  
      Tears stream down her cheeks as she tries to scream but 
      cannot.  The bed board finally SNAPS and with it, Emily dies.

      OMNISCIENT P.O.V. as CAMERA REVEALS Beverly Katz has not left 
      the room, as instructed.  She s standing over Emily Nichols  
      dead body, which she exposed by peeling back sheets.  

                                    BEVERLY KATZ
                    You re Will Graham. 

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    You re not supposed to be in here.

                                    BEVERLY KATZ
                    You wrote the standard monograph on 
                    time of death by insect activity. 

      She indicates her tweezers and what s between them.

                    Found velvet in two of the wounds.
                          (then)
                    You re not real F.B.I.?

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    I m a special investigator.

                                    BEVERLY KATZ
                    Never been an F.B.I. Agent?

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    Strict screening procedures.                                                                                    17.


                                    BEVERLY KATZ
                    Detects instability.  You unstable?  
                    Too unstable to carry a gun?

      Will shows her his shoulder holster with gun tucked inside.  
      Jack Crawford hurries in, as annoyed with Beverly as Will.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    You re not supposed to be in here.

                                    BEVERLY KATZ
                    Found antler velvet in two of the 
                    wounds.  Like she was gored.  Was 
                    looking for velvet in the other 
                    wounds but I was interrupted.

      CAMERA REVEALS Brian Zeller is now standing next to Will.

                                  BRIAN ZELLER
                    Deer and elk pin their prey, put 
                    all their weight on the antlers and 
                    try to suffocate them.  That s how 
                    they would kill a fox or a coyote.

      Will very subtilely retreats from the conversation.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Emily Nichols was strangled and 
                      suffocated.  Ribs were broken.

                                  BRIAN ZELLER
                    It s not rutting season.  Male deer 
                    aren t competing for female deer 
                    this time of year.  

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    Antler velvet is rich in nutrients.  
                    It actually promotes healing.  He 
                    may have put it there on purpose.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    You think he wanted to heal her?

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    He was trying to undo as much as he 
                    could, given he already killed her. 

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    He put her back where he found her.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    Whatever he did to the others, he 
                    couldn t do it to her.                                                                                     18.


                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Is this his special gal?

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    No.  This is an apology.

      The  apology  catches in Will s throat and hangs in the air.  
      He runs his hand over his forehead and takes a deep breath.

                                  WILL GRAHAM (CONT D)
                    Does anyone have any Bufferin?

      INT. AIRPORT CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT

      Will slaps several Bufferin packs and cash on the counter.

      INT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

      Will Graham stands at a GATE COUNTER.  The AIRLINE ATTENDANT 
      winces reading her monitor, smiling as she breaks the news:

                                    AIRLINE ATTENDANT
                    I m sorry your flight is delayed.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    How delayed?

                                    AIRLINE ATTENDANT
                      Significantly delayed.

      He PLOPS into an uncomfortable stainless steel lounge chair, 
      cracks open his Bufferin sample package and swallows them.

                                                                    MATCH CUT TO:

      Will PLOPS into an uncomfortable Coach Class Seat, cracks 
      open another Bufferin sample pack and swallows them.

      INT. AIRPORT TRAM - NIGHT

      Will PLOPS into an uncomfortable plastic bus bench seat, 
      opens another Bufferin package and tosses them back.

                                                                    MATCH CUT TO:                                                                                    19.


      INT. WILL GRAHAM S CAR - AIRPORT PARKING LOT - NIGHT

      Will PLOPS into his luxurious by comparison car seat as the 
      AIRPORT TRAM pulls away in the BACKGROUND.  He reaches into 
      his pocket and pulls out several empty Bufferin packs.

                                                                      TIME CUT TO:

      INT. WILL GRAHAM S CAR - CITY ROAD - NIGHT

      Will stares into middle distance as he drives, hypnotized by 
      the pavement unfurling ahead of him.  HEADLIGHTS reflect off 
      of SOMETHING in the distance moving down the empty road.

      Will squints over the steering wheel as he approaches the 
      certain SOMETHING and finally realizes what it is...

      EXT. WILL GRAHAM S CAR - CITY ROAD - NIGHT

      Will slows considerably as he pulls along side A DOG.  A rope 
      around its neck suggests it was once tied to something.  No 
      collar, matted fur, nevertheless it trots with determination, 
      barely acknowledging Will as he rolls down his window.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    Hello.

      The stray Dog stops and allows Will to drive past.  Will 
      slows to a stop and gets out of his car, at which point the 
      dog abruptly turns around and heads the opposite direction.

      Despite being absolutely exhausted emotionally and 
      physically, Will gets back in his car and u-turns on the road 
      to pursue the dog who is keeping a steady pace trotting away.

      Will goes around the Dog, blocking both lanes of the road 
      ahead of it Police Car style.  The Dog trots around his car 
      in a half-circle, continuing down the road on the other side.

      INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT

      Under the horrible glare of cost-effective neon light, Will 
      Graham slaps A BAG OF HOTDOGS and some CASH on the counter.

      EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

      The Dog with the rope around its neck continues its sojourn 
      into the night, undeterred by anything up until this point.

      Then CAMERA REVEALS the Dog is trotting past Will sitting on 
      the bumper of his car, unwrapping a BAG OF HOTDOGS.

      The Dog stops.                                                                                    20.


      INT. WILL GRAHAM S CAR - NIGHT - DRIVING

      Will already seems lighter in spirit.  He glances at the 
      mangy Dog securely fastened into the passenger seat and asks:

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    What do you want from me?

      The Dog stares.

      INT. WILL GRAHAM S BATHROOM - NIGHT

      The Dog stands patiently as Will SHAVES off clumps of matted 
      hair with an ELECTRIC TRIMMER, tossing them in a woolly pile.

                                                                      TIME CUT TO:

      The Dog stands patiently in the tub as Will massages a SOAPY 
      LATHER through his furry coat and around the bald patches.  
      Dead fleas float in the soapy water while others hop and die.

                                                                      TIME CUT TO:

      The Dog stands patiently as Will gently towel-dries and 
      simultaneously blow-dries him next to a SPACE HEATER.

      INT. WILL GRAHAM S HOUSE - ENCLOSED PATIO - NIGHT

      The Dog stands patiently in his kennel looking up at Will.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    Winston.  This is everybody.  
                      Everybody.  This is Winston.

      CAMERA REVEALS A DOZEN FORMALLY STRAY DOGS staring at Winston 
      in the safety of his new dog kennel.  Winston is not an 
      isolated incident.  Will Graham is a dog collector.  

      An ALPHA DOG steps forward and growls at Winston.  Will 
      quickly corrects the aggressive mutt with a sharp look and a:

                                  WILL GRAHAM (CONT D)
                    Tsssst.

      Alpha steps back into line, sits, then lays down obediently.  

                                  WILL GRAHAM (CONT D)
                    That s right.                                                                                    21.


      INT. WILL GRAHAM S BATHROOM - SHOWER - NIGHT

      Will lets the hot water wash over him, surrounded by steam.  
      The steam GROWS MORE DENSE and then slowly and only slightly, 
      THINS REVEALING Will is now STANDING IN THE MISTY FOREST OF 
      THIS MIND.  He is deep in thought, barely noticing the STAG 
      walking through the misty forest fog only 20 feet away.

      SNAPPING BACK TO THE SHOWER, Will shuts off the water.

      INT. WILL GRAHAM S HOUSE - ENCLOSED PATIO - NIGHT

      The entire pack is huddled together sleigh-dog style 
      surrounding Winston s dog kennel.  Inside the kennel, Winston 
      twitches as he dozes through fitful doggy dreams.

      INT. WILL GRAHAM S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Will s breathing is the only sound in the room.  Moonlight-
      cast tree branch shadows stretch along the walls and across 
      the ceiling.  Then there s a second breathing in the room.

      Will calmly opens his eyes, holding his own breath as he 
      listens for the second breather.  The mysterious breathing 
      continues as Will turns to see laying in bed next to him:

      EMILY NICHOLS

      She s wearing the nightie Will found her in, appearing 
      exactly as she did in her own bed, but now she s in his.

      As Will reaches out to touch her, in an effort to confirm or 
      deny her reality, the ANTLER-LIKE TREE BRANCH SHADOWS shift 
      and stretch, piercing Emily through her wounds, re-impaling 
      her and pulling her into the DARKNESS.  

      Emily slowly recedes into the SHADOWS and disappears.

      ON WILL GRAHAM

      He jolts awake in his bed, soaking wet with perspiration.  
      Emily Nichols was lying next to him only in a dream.  His 
      shirt and underwear cling indiscriminately as he throws back 
      the sheets and climbs out of damp bed.  He EXITS peeling off 
      clothes like a wet bathing suit that then slaps to the floor.

      Will ENTERS, pulling on a dry t-shirt and underwear, lays a 
      beach towel down on the wet bed, then crawls inside.  He 
      pulls the sheets back over himself, heaving a deep sigh.

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.

      SPLOOSH.  A BODY breaks the surface in a FLURRY OF BUBBLES.  
      The body sinks TOWARD CAMERA, filling THE FRAME.  It s Will.

      INT. F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS - BATHROOM

      Will pats his face dry with paper towels as Jack ENTERS, 
      impatient, having been looking for Will for some time.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    What are you doing in here?

                    I enjoy the smell of urinal cake.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Me, too.  Lets talk.

      An AGENT ENTERS to use the facilities.  Jack holds the door.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD (CONT D)
                    Use the ladies room.

      The Agent abruptly turns and EXITS.  Will eyes Jack closing 
      the door, realizing he s not getting by without conversation.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    I m fine.  Just an unfortunate head 
                    space.  Never fun but you get so 
                    you can function.  Shaking it off.  

      He washes down a pair of Bufferin tablets with a wince.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Do you respect my judgement, Will?

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                          (cautious)
                    Yes.                                                                                    23.


                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    We have a better chance of catching 
                    this guy if you re in the saddle.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    I m in the saddle.  Just confused 
                    which direction I m pointing.  I 
                    don t know this kind of psychopath.  
                    Never read about him.  I don t even 
                    know if he s a psychopath.  He s 
                    not insensitive.  He s not shallow.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    You could tell something about him 
                    or you wouldn t ve said this was an 
                    apology. What s he apologizing for?

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    He couldn t honor her.  He has 
                    guilt and remorse.  He feels bad.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Feeling bad defeats the purpose of 
                    being a psychopath, doesn t it?  

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    Yes.  It does.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Then what kind of crazy is he?

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    He couldn t show her he loved her 
                    so he put her corpse back where he 
                    killed it.  Whatever crazy that is.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    You think he loves these girls?

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    He loves one of them, and I think 
                    by association, he has some form of 
                    love for the others.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    There was no semen or saliva.  
                    Emily Nichols died a virgin and 
                    that corpse kept her promise.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    That s not how he s loving them.  
                    He wouldn t disrespect them that 
                    way.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    24.

                                  WILL GRAHAM (CONT'D)
                    He doesn t want these girls to 
                    suffer.  He kills them quickly and, 
                    to his thinking, with mercy.  

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    The sensitive psychopath.  He 
                    risked getting caught to tuck Emily 
                    Nichols back into bed.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    I think he knows that.  

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    What else does he know?

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    He has to take the next girl soon.  
                    He knows he s going to get caught.  
                    One way or the other.  

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Tell me one way.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    If he was more worried about Emily 
                    Nichols than being careful.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      ON BEVERLY KATZ

      She has Emily Nichols  NIGHTIE suspended from a hanger over a 
      table covered with white paper.  Working under bright lights 
      in the draft-free room, she brushes the nightie with a metal 
      spatula, working with the wale and across it, with the nap 
      and against it.  Something falls through the still air:

      A TINY CURL OF METAL

      It falls to the paper.  Beverly studies it with bright eyes:

                                    BEVERLY KATZ
                    I got you.

      A METAL PIPE

      It s secured in a vise positioned against the PIPE CUTTER S 
      JAWS.  The cutter s knurled handle turns as a small amount of 
      CUTTING OIL is applied to the blade, seeping over it.

      EXTREME CLOSE UP

      The cutter is rotated and the blade is tightened, cutting 
      into the pipe, shaving curls of metal as THREADS are carved.

      A TINY CURL OF METAL

      It falls in similar fashion as it did in the crime lab.  
      Instead of white paper, it lands on a pile of metal shavings.

      A REAMER

      It turns around the metal shaft, removing burrs from the cut 
      pipe as more OIL drips and lubricates the threads.

      EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

      CAMERA FINDS the car, from which we can see a Minnesota girl 
      getting out, milquetoasted and wind-chaffed.  She is of the 
      same hair color, eye color, weight and height as Emily 
      Nichols and the seven young women before her.  

      Her name is ABIGAIL HOBBS.

      DIRTY HANDS

      They wipe away oil and shavings from the newly threaded pipe.

      ON ABIGAIL HOBBS

      She offers a small wave to the PIPE THREADER.  One dirty hand 
      offers a small wave in return.  She knows her killer.

      UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

      CAMERA FINDS Jack Crawford walking with DR. ALANA BLOOM, a 
      beautiful Psychology Professor at the University in her 30s.                                                                                    26.


                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Graham likes you.  He doesn t think 
                    you run any mind games on him.

                                  ALANA BLOOM
                    I don t.  I m as honest with him as 
                    I d be with a patient.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Been observing him during your 
                    guest lectures at the academy?

                                  ALANA BLOOM
                    I ve never been in a room alone 
                    with Will. I want to be his friend.  
                    And I am.  You already asked me to 
                    do a study on him.  I said no.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Petersen upstairs wanted the study.

                                  ALANA BLOOM
                    You re the one who asked for it.  

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Seemed a shame not to take 
                      advantage, academically speaking.

                                  ALANA BLOOM
                    Anything scholarly on Will Graham 
                    would be published posthumously.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    After you or after Graham?

                                  ALANA BLOOM
                          (ignoring his question)
                    Will wants to think of this as a 
                    purely intellectual exercise, and 
                    in the narrow definition of 
                      forensics, that s what it is.  

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Why aren t you ever alone with him?

                                  ALANA BLOOM
                    Because I have a professional 
                    curiosity about him.  

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    If he caught you peeking, he d 
                    snatch down the shades?                                                                                    27.


                                  ALANA BLOOM
                    Normally I wouldn t even broach 
                    this, but what do you think one of 
                    Will s strongest drives is?

      Jack knows exactly what she s getting at.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Fear.  He deals with huge amounts 
                    of fear.  Comes with imagination.  

                                  ALANA BLOOM
                    It s the price of imagination.  
                    What you don t mention on the big 
                    boys side of the playground. 

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Don t worry about telling me he s 
                    afraid.  I won t think he s not a 
                    stand up guy.  I m not an asshole.

                                  ALANA BLOOM
                    You re not a total asshole.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                      I wouldn t put him out there if I 
                    couldn t cover him -- if I couldn t 
                    cover him eighty percent. 

                                  ALANA BLOOM
                      I wouldn t put him out there.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    He s out there.  And I need him out 
                    there.  And I need you to make sure 
                    he s not left out there.  Come back 
                    to Quantico with me.

                                  ALANA BLOOM
                    No.  Jack, you really don t want me 
                      commenting on this in any official 
                    capacity.  It wouldn t reflect well 
                    on you.  Sorry you wasted the trip.

      Jack heaves a frustrated breath and exhales:

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    So am I.

                                  ALANA BLOOM
                    Promise me something, Jack.  Don t 
                    let him get too close.  I think it 
                    would kill him to have to fight.                                                                                    28.


                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    He won t have to fight.  I can 
                    promise you that.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                    Tried her skin for prints.  Of

                    Her fingernails were smudged when 
                    we took scrapings.  The scrapings 
                    were where she cut her palms with 
                    them.  She never scratched him.

      Will is also outfitted in gloves, an apron and a splash visor 
      (perched on top of his head).  He flips the visor down and 
      his breathing is amplified in his ears as it fogs his vision. 

      He takes a breath and forces himself to look in the bag.

      CAMERA MOVES INTO THE BODY BAG

      There is no body, only darkness.  And the SOUND of WILL S 
      BREATH bouncing off the splash visor.

      A PENDULUM

      It swings in the darkness.  FWUM.  FWUM.                                                                                    29.

      FWUM.

      Will SNAPS BACK TO:

                    Other injuries were probably but 
                    not conclusively postmortem.

                    She has lots of piercings that look 
                    like they were caused by deer 
                    antlers.  I didn t say the deer was 
                      responsible for putting them there.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    She was mounted on them.  Like 
                    hooks.  She may have been bled.

      Beverly and Jimmy glance at Will.   Brian Zeller is too 
      distracted by his investigation of the abdominal wound.

                    Her liver was removed.  He took it 
                    out and put it back in.  See.

      He removes the liver and examines the organ more closely.

                                  JIMMY PRICE
                    Why cut out her liver if he was 
                    just going to sew it back in again?

      All muscle tone in Will s face goes slack.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    Something was wrong with the meat.

      Zeller looks up from the liver -- how did Graham know?

                                  BRIAN ZELLER
                    She has liver cancer.

      The facts briefly ricochet around Will s mind, then:                                                                                    30.

      BLACK

      The sound of a grown man s quiet sobbing.

      ON HANNIBAL

      He watches the OFF-SCREEN SOBBING MAN inscrutably for an 
      uncomfortably long moment, studying him.

      THE SOBBING MAN

      A handsome, well-groomed gent in his 30s named BENJAMIN.  He 
      tries to find dignity in his tears as he reaches out...

                                  BENJAMIN
                    Please...

      Hannibal hands him the box of tissues he is reaching for.

                                  BENJAMIN (CONT D)
                    I hate being this neurotic.

      Benjamin wipes his eyes and nose.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    If you weren t neurotic, Benjamin, 
                    you would be something much worse.

      Immaculate, filled with antiques and artifacts and a gallery 
      of books in the fashion of Sir John Soane.  Hannibal sits in 
      an arm chair across from Benjamin, who gathers his emotions.

      A CHRYON tells us we are --

      BALTIMORE, MARYLAND

                                  HANNIBAL
                    Our brain is designed to experience 
                    anxiety in short bursts, not the 
                    prolonged foamy lathers of duress 
                    your neuroses seems to enjoy.  It s 
                    why you feel as though a lion were 
                    on the verge of devouring you.

      He eyes the tissue Benjamin tosses on the side table.                                                                                    32.


                                  HANNIBAL (CONT D)
                    You have to convince yourself the 
                    lion is not in the room.  When it 
                    is, I assure you, you will know it.

      THE DOOR

      Hannibal opens it to usher Benjamin out and finds JACK 
      CRAWFORD waiting patiently on his doorstep.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Doctor Lecter?

                                  HANNIBAL
                    I hate to be discourteous, but this 
                    is a private exit for my patients.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    I m Special Agent Jack Crawford 
                    with the F.B.I.  May I come in?

                                  HANNIBAL
                    You may wait in the waiting room.

      Hannibal eyes his credentials, then dismisses Benjamin.

                                  HANNIBAL (CONT D)
                    I ll see you next week, Benjamin. 
                          (to Jack Crawford)
                    Unless of course this is about him.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Oh, no, this is all about you.

      Hannibal blinks and forces a flat smile.

      INT. HANNIBAL LECTER S OFFICE - WAITING ROOM - DAY

      Jack Creawford cools his heels, idly picks up a magazine.  
      The door opens and Hannibal steps into the doorway.

                                  HANNIBAL

                    May I ask how this is all about me?                                                                                    33.


                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    You can ask.  But I do need to ask 
                    you a few questions first.
                          (then)
                    Are you expecting another patient?

                                  HANNIBAL

                    No secretary?

                                  HANNIBAL
                    Was pre-dispositioned to romantic 
                    whims.  Followed her heart to the 
                    United Kingdom.  Sad to see her go.

      INT. HANNIBAL LECTER S OFFICE - DAY

      Hannibal dangerously alone with Jack Crawford, who studies 
      framed meticulous pencil drawings of Parisian landscapes.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Are these your s, Doctor?  

      Hannibal indicates an immaculate rendering of a school.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    Among the firsts.  My boarding 
                    school in Paris when I was a boy.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                      Incredible amount of detail.

      Hannibal picks up a pencil and cuts a point with a scalpel, 
      blowing the shavings off the tip to reveal its sharpness.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    Learned very early a scalpel cuts 
                    better points than a pencil sharpener.  

      Hannibal sits down the pencil, but not the scalpel.  He 
      listens to Jack, eyes drifting to the F.B.I. Agent s jugular.                                                                                    34.


                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                      I understand your drawing got you 
                    an internship at Johns Hopkins.

      As we become aware of the steady rhythm of Hannibal s 
      heartbeat, his nostrils flair and his eyes dilate, as he 
      exhales a very calm observation.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    I am beginning to suspect you are 
                      investigating me, Agent Crawford.

      An eerie stillness as if lighting were about to strike.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    You were referred to me by Alana 
                    Bloom in the psychology department 
                    at the University of Chicago.

      Hannibal s demeanor changes ever so slightly.  

                                  HANNIBAL
                    Most psychology departments are 
                    filled with ham radio enthusiasts 
                    and other personality-deficients.  
                    Dr. Bloom would be the exception.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Showed me your paper in The Journal 
                    of Clinical Psychiatry.  Evolutionary 
                    Origins of Social Exclusion.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    And?

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Very interesting, even to a layman.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    A layman?  So many learned fellows 
                    going about in the halls of 
                      Behavioral Science at the F.B.I. 
                    and you consider yourself a layman? 

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    I do when I m in your company, 
                    Doctor.  I d like you to help me 
                    with a psychological profile.

      OFF Hannibal s piqued interest...                                                                                    35.


      CLOSE ON - WILL

      The FRAMES OF HIS GLASSES strategically positioned to block 
      eye contact, yet giving the impression of looking at someone.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    I think of him as one of those 
                    pitiful things that are sometimes 
                    born in hospitals.  They feed it, 
                    and keep it warm, but they don t 
                    put it on the machines and they let 
                    it die.  This cannibal is the same 
                    way in his head, but he looks 
                    normal, nobody can tell what he is.

      Quantico, Virginia

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    I can t tell what he is.  Or who he 
                    is.  He s got no face for me.  

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    We could spend a lot of time 
                    looking for people we ve invented 
                    while he takes the next girl.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    Tell me then, how many confessions?

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Twelve dozen last time I checked.  
                    None of them knew details.  Until 
                    this morning.  Then everyone knew 
                    details.  Some genius in Duluth PD 
                    took a picture of Emily Nichols  
                    body with their phone and shared it 
                    with a few close friends.  Freddy 
                    Lounds ran it on Tattler.com.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                      Tasteless.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    Do you have trouble with taste?                                                                                    36.


                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    My thoughts are often not tasty.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    Nor mine.  No effective barriers.  

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    I make forts.

                                  HANNIBAL
                      Associations come quickly.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    So do forts.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    You must prefer the company of 
                    animals.  I suspect a dog lover?

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    They re okay.

      Will is momentarily distracted by TWO WOMEN, apparently 
      mother and daughter, arguing at a table near the door.  They 
      speak in low voices, anger red in their faces.  Hannibal 
      notices Will looking flushed on his face and neck.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    Not fond of eye contact, are you?

      Will unapologetically continues to avoid eye contact.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    Eyes are distracting.  You see too 
                    much.  You don t see enough.  And 
                    it s hard to focus when you re 
                    thinking those whites are really 
                    white or they must have hepatitis, 
                    or is that a burst vein?  So I try 
                    to avoid eyes whenever possible.

      Hannibal isn t deflected from making his observations.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    I imagine what you see and learn 
                    touches everything else in your 
                    mind.  Your values and decency are 
                    present yet shocked at your 
                      associations, appalled at your 
                    dreams.  No forts in the bone arena 
                    of your skull for things you love.

      Hannibal has just described Will Graham to a letter, but he 
      is not about to give him the satisfaction of knowing it.                                                                                    37.


                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    Whose profile are you working on?
                          (to Jack)
                    Whose profile is he working on?

                                  HANNIBAL
                    I m sorry, Will.  Observing is what 
                    we do.  I can t shut mine off any 
                    more than you can shut yours off.

      Will doesn t appreciate the intrusion into his psyche.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                          (to Jack)
                    Please don t psychoanalyze me.  You 
                    won t like me when I m psychoanalyzed.  
                          (then)
                    I m going to get some air.

      He scoots out of the booth and crosses to the door steering a 
      wide berth around the angry mother and daughter.  

      AT THE CASH REGISTER

      Hannibal stands near Crawford as he pays the CASHIER.  Will 
      Graham can be seen outside through the plate glass windows.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Keep poking him like that and those 
                    Get Smart doors are going to come 
                    down faster than you can say  Boo. 

                                  HANNIBAL
                    During intense conversations, does 
                    he adopt your cadence of speech? 

      He does and Crawford has definitely noticed it before.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    I thought it was a gimmick to get 
                    the back-and-forth going.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    It s involuntary.  He couldn t stop 
                    himself if he tried.  
                          (then)
                    What he has is pure empathy.  And 
                      projection.  He can assume your 
                    point of view, or mine -- and maybe 
                    some other points of view that 
                    scare him.  It s an uncomfortable 
                    gift, Jack.  Perception s a tool 
                    that s pointed on both ends.                                                                                      38.


                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    If that tool can save somebody s 
                    life, I m going to use it.

      Hannibal reads Jack Crawford in one slow blink.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    This cannibal you have him getting 
                    to know... I think I can help good 
                    Will see his face.

      CLOSE ON - HANNIBAL S NOSE

      A larger PROSTHETIC NOSE is placed over it.

      CLOSE ON - FACIAL HAIR APPLIANCE

      The hair affixed to a net is secured to Hannibal s jaw.

      CLOSE ON - A WIG

      The expensive wig is pulled down and fastened like a cap.

      POP WIDE TO REVEAL

      Hannibal is completely transformed into a MAN with a beard 
      and thick shock of hair whose frame is slightly different 
      than his own.  He puts on glasses.

      A COVERED CAR

      The blanket is whipped off the vehicle in one move.  We are --

      INT. YOURSELF STORAGE - STORAGE UNIT - NIGHT

      The car is indistinct in every way, as common as a Toyota 
      Camry.  DISGUISED HANNIBAL at the rear bumper, removes the 
      Maryland license and affixes a false Pennsylvania plate.

      EXT. YOURSELF STORAGE - STORAGE UNIT - NIGHT

      The garage door rolls up unceremoniously and the indistinct 
      in every way automobile slowly emerges.  Disguised Hannibal 
      steps out of the car and pulls the storage unit door closed.

      EXT. MINNESOTA STATE LINES - NIGHT

        A monumental STATE SIGN reads  MINNESOTA WELCOMES YOU.   The 
      INDISTINCT CAR with the PENNSYLVANIA PLATES drives past.

      EXT. UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA - FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

      The UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA MARCHING BAND is performing its 
      half-time rendition of Fleetwood Mac s TUSK.  

      CONCESSION STANDS AND RESTROOMS

      Bustling with HUNDREDS OF FACULTY, STUDENTS, PARENTS and 
      VISITORS.  The Marching Band can be heard in the background.

      CAMERA FINDS CASSIE and ALICE, two attractive young MINNESOTA 
      GIRLS.  They move through the crowd heading toward...

      DISGUISED HANNIBAL

      He stands politely away from the crowd, a smoking cigarette 
      dangling from his gloved fingertips.  As the girls approach:

                                  CASSIE
                    Doesn t use them.  Rolls up toilet 
                    paper in tight little wads.  Her 
                    family is really poor.  It s gross.

                                  ALICE
                    Too poor to buy tampons?

                                  CASSIE
                    Maybe it s an OCD thing.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    OCD is something else altogether.

      She shoots him a look, but sees his cigarette and wants one.

                                  CASSIE
                    You got another cigarette?

      Hannibal fishes through pockets for the box of cigarettes.

                                  HANNIBAL
                          (playful)
                    I have to ask you to start over.  I 
                    simply cannot reward rude behavior.  
                    It s unspeakably ugly to me.

                                  CASSIE
                    Yawn.  Just give me the cigarette 
                    or I have to make you hate me.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    Don t do that.

                                  CASSIE
                    I have qualities.                                                                                    40.


                                  HANNIBAL
                    That make people hate you?

      Hannibal shakes a cigarette out of the box and offers it.

                                  CASSIE
                    I can be very judgemental.  There s 
                    a fat girl on my floor and she s a 
                      vegetarian and that pisses me off.

      She takes the cigarette and he lights it.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    The fat or the vegetarian?

                                  CASSIE
                    Both.  Existing in one entity.  I 
                    guess there s no meat in a Twinkie.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    No.  None at all.

                                  CASSIE
                    Aren t you gonna watch the game?

                                  HANNIBAL
                    I know very little about the sport.

                                  CASSIE
                    Then why are you here?  Piss off.

      Cassie heaves an exhausted, annoyed sigh as she casually 
      blows smoke in Hannibal s face before turning away.

      Hannibal smiles.  Then coughs.

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.

      CASSIE S DEAD BODY

      She has similar WOUNDS across her torso to the ones seen on 
      Emily Nichols, as well as TWO LARGE PUNCTURES on her chest.  
      The ANTLERS she is impaled on tastefully mask her nudity, 
      along with the small MURDER OF CROWS gathered around her.

      CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL...

      A HORRIFIC TABLEAU

      Cassie s body is mounted like a TABLE TOP on ANTLER TABLE 
      LEGS belonging to the SEVERED HEAD of a TROPHY STAG.  The 
      CROWS give the impression of guests at a dinner table.

      We are --

                      Minneapolis homicide has already 
                    made a statement.  They re calling 
                    him the  Minnesota Shrike. 

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    Like the bird?

      Jimmy Price stands out of the tall grass nearby.

                                  JIMMY PRICE
                    Shrike s a perching bird.  Impales 
                    mice and lizards on thorny branches 
                    and barbed wire.  Rips their organs 
                    right out of their bodies.  Puts 
                    them in a little birdie pantry and 
                    eats them later.  At its leisure.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    Sounds about right.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Is he self-destructing?

                    He wanted her to be found this way.  
                    It s the homicidal equivalent of 
                    fecal smearing.  It s petulant.   I 
                    almost feel like he s mocking her.
                          (then)
                    Or he s mocking us.

                    catch.  There s no traceable 
                    motive.  There ll be no patterns.  
                    He may never kill like this again.

      Will turns and crosses under the POLICE TAPE, tossing back:

                                  WILL GRAHAM (CONT D)
                    Have Dr. Lecter work up a 
                      psychological profile.  You seem to 
                    be impressed with his opinion.

      THE MISSING LUNGS - HANNIBAL LECTER S DINING ROOM

      Hannibal takes a bite and washes it down with a sip of wine.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      EXT. HIGHWAY ROAD - EARLY MORNING

      A syrupy MORNING FOG blankets the road.  Will Graham, 
      completely naked, stumbles INTO FRAME, dazed.  He glances up 
      just as HEADLIGHTS cut through the mist, blinding him.

      Then... 

      Will is suddenly, brutally TRAMPLED/GORED by a LARGE STAG 
      COVERED WITH BLACK CROW FEATHERS.  OFF the IMPACT of the 
      FEATHERED DEER KNOCKING Will OUT OF FRAME...

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    45.


      A CLOSED DOOR

      A distorted image of SOMEONE KNOCKING rolls across the fish-
      eye lens of the PEEP HOLE.  KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK.  We are --

      INT. MINNEAPOLIS MOTEL ROOM - MORNING

      Will wraps a robe around himself as he shuffles to the door 
      wiping the fresh sleep out of his eyes.  He opens the door 
      REVEALING Hannibal Lecter standing outside holding two cups, 
      a thermos and a small thermal food storage bag.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    Good morning, Will.  May I come in?

      Will stares at him, blinking away the last images of the 
      Feathered Deer haunting his half-asleep mind.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    Where s Crawford?

                                  HANNIBAL
                    Deposed in court.  The adventure 
                    will be yours and mine today.
                          (then)
                    May I come in?

      CLOSE ON SMALL TABLE

      A beautifully presented breakfast for two served on 
      tupperware containers on top of place settings.  Freshly 
      brewed coffee is poured into the two cups Hannibal carried.

      POP WIDE as Hannibal peels lids off the tupperware dishes. 

                                  HANNIBAL (CONT D)
                    I m very careful about what I put 
                    into my body.  Which means I end up 
                    preparing most meals myself.   A 
                    little protein scramble to start 
                    the day.  Some eggs, some sausage.

      Hannibal watches Will take a bite of his breakfast scramble.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    It s delicious.  Thank you.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    My pleasure.

      He is genuinely amused and successfully hides it.                                                                                    46.


                                  HANNIBAL (CONT D)
                    I would apologize for my analytical 
                    ambush but I know I will soon be 
                      apologizing again and you ll tire 
                    of that eventually so I have to 
                    consider using apologies sparingly.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    Just keep it professional.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    Or we could socialize like adults, 
                    god forbid we become friendly.  

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    I don t find you that interesting.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    You will.  
                          ( changing the subject )
                    Agent Crawford tells me you have a 
                    knack for the monsters.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    That s a superstition.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    It s no secret he has an agenda for 
                    you.  This morning s last minute 
                      deposition reeked of convenience.  

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                          ( sure did )
                    You have all day to gain my trust.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    I called your good friend Dr. Bloom 
                    about you.  She wouldn t gossip, 
                    not a word.  She s very protective 
                    of you.  Smitten, I would say.  She 
                    asked me to keep an eye on you.

      Will studies Hannibal, then decides to keep it to business.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    I think we re going to catch him.  
                    The original Shrike.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    The devil is in the details.  What 
                    didn t your Copy Cat do to the girl 
                    in the field?  What gave it away?                                                                                      47.


                                  WILL GRAHAM
                      Everything.  It s like he had to 
                    show me a negative so I could see 
                    the positive.  That crime scene  
                    was practically gift-wrapped.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    The mathematics of human behavior.  
                    All those ugly variables.  Some bad 
                    math with this shrike fellow.  Are 
                    you reconstructing his fantasies?  
                    What kind of problems does he have?

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    He has a few.

      Almost with a wink:

                                  HANNIBAL
                    Ever have any problems, Will?

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    No.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    Of course you don t.  You and I are 
                    just alike.  Problem free.  Nothing 
                    about us to feel horrible about.  
                          (then)
                    I think Uncle Jack sees you as a 
                    fragile little tea-cup, the finest 
                    china used for only special guests.  

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    How do you see me?

                                  HANNIBAL
                    The mongoose I want under the house 
                    when the snakes slither by.
                          (then)
                    Finish your breakfast.

      EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

      Will Graham and Hannibal Lecter step out of their rental car 
      and cross toward a CAMPER TRAILER OFFICE.

      INT. CAMPER TRAILER OFFICE - DAY

        A flustered, mildly suspicious secretary named DIXIE stares 
      at Will and Hannibal trying to understand their visit.                                                                                    48.


                                  DIXIE
                    We have a strict policy of not 
                    hiring drifters or anyone who has a 
                    history of trouble with the law.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    We re not looking for anyone like 
                    that, ma am.  Just general 
                      demographic information on hires.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    Any employee correspondence you 
                    might have?  Recommendations, 
                      complaints, anything in writing?

                                  DIXIE
                    I got a whole stack of resignation 
                    letters.  Plumbers union requires 
                    them whenever members finish a job.

      STACK OF RESIGNATION LETTERS

      Will and Hannibal are leafing through pages as Dixie talks on 
      the phone in an ineffective hushed tone.

                                  DIXIE (CONT D)
                          (to phone)
                    Two fellas from the F.B.I.  They re 
                    going through drawers now.  Putting 
                    papers in file boxes.  Yes.  
                    They re taking things.  No.  They 
                    didn t say whe --  Yes, they can.
                          (to Will and Hannibal)
                    What did you say your names were?

      Just then, Will finds a resignation letter of note.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    Garret Jacob Hobbs.

                                  DIXIE
                    He s one of our pipe threaders.
                          (to phone)
                    I ll call you back.

      Dixie hangs up the phone and scoots out from around her desk.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    Phone number.  No address.  
                          (then)
                    Did Mr. Hobbs have a daughter?

                                  DIXIE
                    Might have.                                                                                    49.


                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    Eighteen or nineteen, wind-chaffed?  
                    Plain but pretty?  She would have 
                    auburn hair.  About this tall.

                                  DIXIE
                    Maybe.  I don t know.  I don t keep 
                    company with these people.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    You have an address for Mr. Hobbs?  

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. CAMPER TRAILER OFFICE - DAY

      Will, Hannibal and Dixie haul file boxes from the make-shift 
      office building to the trunk of their rental car.

      Hannibal allows himself to knock a box out of the trunk, 
      scattering papers.  Will and Dixie stoop to pick them up.

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    I got it.

      As Will and Dixie pick up the pages, Hannibal returns to:

      INT. CAMPER TRAILER OFFICE - DAY

      Hannibal waits as the door hinges closed and latches with a 
      CLICK, watching Dixie and Will clean up the mess he made.  
      Satisfied, Hannibal picks up the phone with his sleeve.

      INT. HOBBS RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - MORNING

      A bright, intelligent young woman, ABIGAIL HOBBS (seen 
      earlier), answers the PHONE her mother LOUISE (40s) and 
      father JACOB (40s) are preparing breakfast in the background.  
      Abigail is a Minnesota girl like Emily Nichols and the rest.

      A CHYRON tells us we are --

      ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA

                                    ABIGAIL
                    Hello?  Just a second.
                          (to her father)
                    Dad.  It s for you.

                                  JACOB
                    Who is it?

                                    ABIGAIL
                    Caller i.d. said it was work.                                                                                    50.


      She hands Jacob the phone and he presses it to his ear.

                                  JACOB
                    Hello.

      INT. HANNIBAL S OFFICE - MORNING

      Hannibal speaks simply and clearly into the disposable phone:

                    Mister Garrett Jacob Hobbs?

                    Yes.

                    You don t know me and I suspect 
                    we ll never meet.  This is a 
                    courtesy call.  Listen very 
                      carefully.  Are you listening?

                                  JACOB
                    Yes.

                                  HANNIBAL
                    They know.

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.

      CLOSE ON - WILL GRAHAM

      REFLECTIVE LIGHT flashes across his BLOOD-SPATTERED face, 
        illuminating his eyes.  His clothes are also BLOOD-STAINED.  
      Something horrible happened since the last time we saw Will.

      ALL SOUND IS DULLED and the AMBIENT NOISE of Will s 
      circulatory system provides an organic hum.  He stares into-
        middle-distance as CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL we are --

      EXT. HOBBS S HOUSE - DAY -- ESTABLISHING

      A cozy, well-kept tract home stands unobtrusively amongst 
      aesthetically similar homes.  BLOOD-SPATTERED Will leans 
      against his rental car idling across the street. 

      A circus of AMBULANCES, PARAMEDICS, POLICE CARS and OFFICERS.  

      ON WILL GRAHAM

      He takes a breath, exhales, then closes his eyes.

      A PENDULUM

      It swings in the darkness of Will s mind.  FWUM.  FWUM. FWUM.

      ON WILL GRAHAM

      His eyes are still closed.  The PENDULUM is now outside his 
      head.  It swings in front of his eyes, wiping away the POLICE 
      CARS and OFFICERS.  FWUM.  The PENDULUM swings across his 
      bloodied face and the horrible streaks of madness vanish.

      Will opens his eyes.  We are --

      EXT. HOBB S HOUSE - CAR - DAY

      The crime scene has now been decriminalized in Will s mind.  

      Will pops a Bufferin behind the wheel of the rental car.  
      Lector unbuckles his seatbelt on the passenger side.  Will 
      thinks a moment before getting out.

      Hannibal smiles, a hint of excitement. 

      EXT. HOBBS S HOUSE - DAY - SLOWER MOTION

      Will walks purposefully to the front door, trying his best 
      not to look uncomfortable.  Hannibal purposefully lags 
      behind.  Will is halfway to the door when it suddenly opens:                                                                                    52.


      LOUISE HOBBS

      Bleeding and wheezing, she is shoved down the porch steps in 
      a heap, the door slamming shut behind her.

      ON WILL GRAHAM

      He rushes to DYING LOUISE HOBBS.  Her alabaster skin in sharp 
      contrast to the crimson pouring out of it.  Multiple wounds 
      puncture her torso and arms.  She grasps haltingly for Will, 
      streaking him with her blood. 

      Her cold hand clutches his wrist as her body spasms. She s 
      already gone and Will knows this. 

      He pries her slick, red fingers from his wrist, trying not to 
      see the last flickers of pain and fear exciting her face. 

      THE DOOR

      Will smashes into it with everything he s got. It s hard to 
      say whether the sickening crack was from his shoulder or the 
      its wood frame. He gives it a well-placed kick, and another, 
      splintering it little-by-little until he can stumble INSIDE. 

      ON HANNIBAL LECTOR

      He strolls casually up the walk, barely glancing at the 
      lifeless body of Louise Hobbs stepping deliberately over it. 

      He pauses in the broken doorway, listening closely.

                                                                      HARD CUT TO:

      INT. HOBBS S HOUSE - MAIN FLOOR - DAY

      The wild-eyed contrast to Dr. Lector, WILL GRAHAM works his 
      way from room to room, gun first. Adrenaline allows him to 
      ignore the splatters of blood defacing the walls and floors. 

                                  WILL GRAHAM
                    Garret Jacob Hobbs?  F.B.I.

      Will stops cold at the sight before him as he moves into:

      INT. HOBBS S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

      Garrett Jacob Hobbs behind his DAUGHTER, ABIGAIL, slashing at 
      her throat. The wide-eyed girl has her weight against him, 
      chin tucked down, gasping for air. 

      TIME SLOWS TO A CRAWL as the SOUND YIELDS to the AMBIENT 
      NOISE of Will s circulatory system.                                                                                     53.


      Will raises his pistol.  BLAM.  BLAM.  BLAM.  He fires into  
      Hobbs s exposed upper chest, one after another.  Hobbs 
      doesn t go down.  He keeps slashing.  Will keeps shooting. 

      BLAM.  BLAM. 

      With one last deep cut, Hobbs finally falls.  Hannibal steps 
      into the kitchen, his inscrutable expression suddenly 
      registering genuine pity and regret as he sees:

      ABIGAIL HOBBS

      Her struggle to breath underscored by the WHEEZE of air 
      through her slashed wind-pipe.  Will applies pressure to the 
      wounds, scooping Abigail onto his lap.  He looks up to see:

      GARRET JACOB HOBBS

      He hisses at Will Graham through dying, jagged breath.

                                    GARRETT HOBBS
                    See? See?

      Will s are eyes glazed. He s shutting down. Behind him:

      ON HANNIBAL

      He moves swiftly to Abigail, addressing her wounds as she 
      stares at her dying father even as her own life ebbs.  Will 
      gently raises her glassy eyes to his own as Hannibal works.  

      Will doesn t look away. 

                                                                    MATCH CUT TO:

      BLOOD SPATTERED WILL GRAHAM

      He leans against the rental car staring at the CRIME SCENE 
      CIRCUS.  He watches as PARAMEDICS haul Abigail into the back 
      of their AMBULANCE.  Hannibal continues to hold her hand, 
      crawling in beside her as a PARAMEDIC pulls the doors shut.

      EXT. MINNESOTA WILDERNESS - RUSTIC HUNTING CABIN - DAY

      A CHYRON tells us we are --

      CHIPPEWA NATIONAL FOREST, MINNESOTA

      Jack Crawford is the first in a bevy of FBI AGENTS moving 
      toward the Cabin door.  He nods to the BIG AGENT beside him. 

      SMASH! One kick sends the door off its hinges.                                                                                    54.


      INT. RUSTIC HUNTING CABIN - DAY

      Jack takes in the morbid sight with measured composure. The 
      faces on the Agents around him are decidedly less composed.

      ANTLERS cover LITERALLY EVERY INCH OF THE ENTIRE ROOM.  

      Brittle horns CRACK beneath their feet and dangle like 
      skeletal stalactites from above. The most impressive 
      specimens, on the walls, protrude from the tangle of bony 
      knobs behind them, obfuscating any hint of the wood behind. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. F.B.I. ACADEMY - HALLWAY - MORNING

      CAMERA FOLLOWS JACK CRAWFORD down the corridor toward Will 
      Graham s lecture hall.  But when he gets to the door he 
      notices instead of Will Graham at the front of the class, 
      it s Dr. Alana Bloom mid-lecture.  Crawford knocks to get her 
      attention.  She crosses to the door and opens it a crack.

                                  JACK CRAWFORD
                    Where s Graham?

      She considers Crawford and how to answer him best, then:

                                  ALANA BLOOM
                    You said he wouldn t have to fight.

      Before Jack can respond, she as respectfully as possible 
      closes the door in his face and returns to her lecture.

      INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - MORNING

      Will walks under the horrible glare of hospital fluorescents, 
      passing HOSPITAL SECURITY as he rounds a corner turning into:

      INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT ROOM - MORNING

      Will ENTERS to find Abigail Hobbs integrated into an 
      elaborate weave of life-saving technology.  CAMERA REVEALS 
      sleeping in a chair next to her bed is HANNIBAL LECTER.

      He s holding her hand, offering a tiny comfort.

      Will Graham quietly sits in the empty chair next to Lecter 
      watching his unconscious care for the girl they both saved.

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.


                                        THE END
