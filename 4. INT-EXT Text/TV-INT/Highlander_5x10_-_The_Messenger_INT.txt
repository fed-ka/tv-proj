      Culbraith is at his writing desk, looking at a picture. 
      CLOSE ON a black and white tintype of a pretty Southern woman
      and her two daughters.  Then

      PULL BACK

      to find the windows overlooking the stockade and the
      prisoners, as MacLeod is brought in by Hickson and two Guards.

      Culbraith continues writing.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Thank you, Sergeant.

      Hickson salutes and leaves.  Culbraith puts his quill aside
      and regards MacLeod.

                                      CULBRAITH (CONT'D)
                    Colonel William Everett Culbraith.
                          (beat)
                    Have a seat, sir.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Duncan MacLeod.
                          (beat)
                    And I'll stand.

      Culbraith stands and examines MacLeod.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    I hear you're an abolitionist,
                    MacLeod.
                          (beat)
                    It may surprise you that I, too,
                    share certain ill feelings about the
                      institution of slavery.  In fact, on
                    my farm outside Atlanta, my wife and
                    I have no slaves of our own.

                                      MACLEOD
                    No, but you have Andersonville.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    I take it you don't approve of my
                    prison.

                                      MACLEOD
                    This is no prison, Culbraith.  It's
                      a slaughterhouse.

                                      CULBRAITH
                          (with great distaste)
                    It's all slaughter, isn't it?  What
                    we do.  What they do.
                          (beat)
                    I've seen more death in this war
                    than I have in a dozen lifetimes.
                          (beat)
                    I grow sick of the war.  Ours and
                    theirs.
                          (beat)
                    But I am a soldier, sir, and I have
                    my orders.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Orders.  Do your orders tell you to
                    treat those men like animals?

                                      CULBRAITH
                    If they are animals, it is because
                    of the way they treat each other. 
                    No discipline, no honor.  They kill
                    one another for a crust of bread.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (with passion)
                    Because they're starving.
                          (with reason)
                    Those men are soldiers.  They deserve
                    respect.

                                      CULBRAITH
                          (with passion)
                    These soldiers are destroying the
                    South.  My South.
                          (resigned)
                    The truth is, I have no food to give
                    them.  These are hard times.  My own
                    guards are on half rations.  What
                    would you have me do?

                                      MACLEOD
                    For a start, I'd show mercy to the
                    men you're about to have killed.

                                      CULBRAITH
                          (beat)
                    I can't afford mercy.

      Culbraith goes to the window, his face full of regret.

                                      CULBRAITH (CONT'D)
                    When one escape goes unpunished,
                      discipline breaks down.  Without
                      discipline, we descend into chaos.
                          (hard)
                    And I will not suffer chaos under my
                    command.

      He raises his hand, his white handkerchief in it, prepares
      to signal the firing squad.

      MACLEOD S POV - THROUGH WINDOW - THE FIRING SQUAD

      The firing squad takes aim at the prisoners.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Killing them won't stop them from
                    trying to escape!

      Culbraith lowers his hand.

      THE FIRING SQUAD

      SHOOTS -- and the prisoners crumple like rag dolls.

      Silence follows the blast of the rifles.

      RESUME - MACLEOD AND CULBRAITH

      MacLeod takes a step towards him.  Instantly Culbraith's
      sword is out, at MacLeod's neck.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    I don't enjoy killing, MacLeod, but
                    I will if you make me.

      And OFF this, Guards enter and take MacLeod's arms.  They
      drag him out, still holding Culbraith's eyes.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:


      MacLeod and Culbraith are in mid-battle, fighting around the
      boathouse, neither asking or giving quarter.  Then Culbraith
      slips on the decking, goes down MacLeod wounds him in the
      side.  Culbraith goes to his knees.  MacLeod raises his sword
      for the final blow.  He's about to swing -- and they both
      get the BUZZ.  MacLeod hesitates but only for a moment.  He
      starts to bring the sword down

                                      RICHIE
                    MAC!  NO!

      MACLEOD

      is thrown, half-turns to Richie --

      Culbraith sees his chance.  He rolls aside -- grabs his sword --
      and keeps rolling OFF the walkway into the water.  MacLeod
      scrambles to the edge to look after him:

      Nothing.  Bubbles, a ripple -- he's gone.  MacLeod looks at
      Richie in fury, then storms out.


      Culbraith stands by his desk.  MacLeod stands before him,
      Hickson and a Guard eyeing him, weapons at the ready.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Gangrene.

                    Your friend should have stayed on
                    the plantation.

                                      MACLEOD
                    If the leg comes off now, he'll live.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    I'm afraid my surgeon is occupied. 
                    We have wounded of our own.

                    He'll have to wait.

                                      MACLEOD
                    If he waits, he'll die.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    I didn't put him in harm's way, you
                    did.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (beat)
                    Colonel, he's only a boy, a scared
                    boy.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    They're all scared boys.
                          (beat)
                    I'll do what I can.  If my surgeon's
                      available, I'll send him in the
                    morning.

      He returns to his desk and starts writing.  And OFF MacLeod's
      reaction --


      Culbraith is getting dressed as Hickson enters and stands at
      attention at the door.  He has a dispatch.

                                      HICKSON
                    I beg your pardon, sir, but the
                    courier said it was urgent.  It's
                    from your brother-in-law.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Very well, Sergeant, come in.

      Culbraith reads the dispatch silently to himself.  As he
      reads, his face is covered with despair.

                                    SAD SOUTHERN VOICE (V.0.)
                    Dear Colonel, Georgia is burning
                    from Atlanta to the sea.  Thousands
                    have died.  It grieves me to tell
                    you this, but your wife...  my
                    sister...  and the children...

      A voice interrupts.

                                      MACLEOD (O.S.)
                    Colonel Culbraith.

      Culbraith says nothing.  His face hardens into a mask that
      is beyond pain, beyond hate.

      MACLEOD

      stands in the doorway under the watchful eye of a couple of
      Confederate soldiers.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    I've come about the surgeon.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Your request is denied.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Dammit, the man is dying in agony.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Agony is what war is about, Mr.
                    MacLeod.

      He starts to turn away.  MacLeod gets in his face.

                                      MACLEOD
                    At least give me a knife!  Let me
                    try to save him!

      He puts out his hand, desperate, pleading.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Please.

      Culbraith looks at the hand a BEAT.  But the letter has turned
      his heart to stone.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    You've had your answer.

      Culbraith nods to the guards.  They level their rifles, back
      MacLeod out of the hut.


      MacLeod and Richie are entering, Richie still trying to make
      his argument.

                                      RICHIE
                    Maybe Culbraith thought he had to do
                    it.  You don't know what made him
                    like that.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You're right.
                          (beat)
                    And I don't care.

                                      RICHIE
                    Maybe if you talked to him, you'd
                      understand each other.  You'd find a
                    reason not to fight!

                                      MACLEOD
                    I don't need to talk to him.
                          (beat)
                    Some people are evil, Richie.  Not
                    bad, not misunderstood...  just evil.
                          (tight)
                    You don't reason with evil.  You
                    kill it.

                                      RICHIE
                    But evil only exists because of fear. 
                    That's what Methos is talking about!

      MacLeod stops, turns and stares at him.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Methos?
                          (beat)
                    You've been talking to Methos?

                                      RICHIE
                    I thought he was just a legend.  The
                    oldest Immortal alive...  Then he
                    shows up out of nowhere.

                                      MACLEOD

                    all night.  The guy's got this wisdom,

                    It was like listening to some kind
                    of saint.

                    He's no saint.  And I don't care how
                    old he is, he's wrong.

                    is a chance to change our lives!  To
                    live without being afraid!

                                      MACLEOD
                    Without a head.

      Richie sees he's getting nowhere, flares in frustration.

                                      RICHIE
                    Sometimes I don't get you, Mac.
                          (beat)
                    I don't get you at all.

      He turns and walks out.  MacLeod starts for the elevator,
      angrily slams the door down and slaps the button.


      The elevator stops.  MacLeod lifts the door -- and stops. 
      He's getting the BUZZ.  He quietly pulls his sword, enters
      the loft to find

      METHOS

      the real one, flopped on the couch with his stocking feet
      propped on the table, revealing TOES wiggling through rips
      in his socks, beer in hand.  On the floor beside him, a well-
      worn internal-frame pack, and badly worn hiking boots.  (NOTE:
      Methos no longer wears the Watcher tattoo.)

      MacLeod lowers his sword, not smiling.

                                      METHOS
                    Thought I'd make myself at home.
                          (taking a sip)
                    There's some cold ones in the fridge.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I know.  It's my fridge.

                          (beat)
                    I thought you were out wandering the
                    world.

                                      METHOS
                    Tibet.
                          (shrugs)
                      Yak-butter was hell on the digestion.

      Methos takes a sip of beer, and wiggles his toes.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    Besides, I had all the enlightenment
                    I could use.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Too bad you didn't keep it to
                    yourself.

      Methos sees he's pissed, does a doubletake.

                                      METHOS
                    Guess I dozed off somewhere along
                    the line.  What are we talking about?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm talking about the crap you've
                    been handing Richie.

                                      METHOS
                    Ah.
                          (beat)
                    Which crap was that, exactly?

                                      MACLEOD
                    You know damn well.  Stopping
                    fighting, laying down your sword... 
                    "give peace a chance." Sound familiar?

      Methos stares a BEAT, puts the beer down.

                                      METHOS
                    So.  He's here.

      MacLeod stares.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Who's here?

                                      METHOS
                    Me.
                          (beat)
                    The other Methos.

                                          ACT TWO

      FADE IN:


      Methos is at the counter, a leather awl in his hand, fixing
      a tear in his boots as MacLeod looks on.

                                      METHOS
                    I never actually met the guy.  I
                    just heard rumors about him.  He's
                    been going around, spreading his
                    message to other Immortals.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (pointed)
                    Using your name.

                                      METHOS
                    It's not like I took out a patent or
                    anything.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Sounds like this guy's started a
                      franchise.
                          (beat)
                    This line about peace and love... 
                    what's he after?

                                      METHOS
                    Maybe exactly what he says.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Come on.  Turning the other cheek
                    only gets you slapped twice.

                                      METHOS
                    Still, it has a nice ring.  No
                    fighting, no killing, peace and
                      harmony...  Tell me you haven't
                      fantasized about it yourself.
                          (beat)
                    Some young suckers are sure to fall
                    for it.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Richie's seen the light.

                                      METHOS
                    Voila.

                                      MACLEOD
                    He won't listen to me.  He thinks
                    the guy is some kind of prophet.

                                      METHOS
                    Who's to say he's wrong?

                                      MACLEOD
                    You are.  The man is a fraud!

                                      METHOS
                    Look, enough people want my head
                    because of who I am.  If he wants to
                    play "Methos," I say let him.

                                      MACLEOD
                    And if he gets killed doing it?

                                      METHOS
                    Then nobody's going to be looking
                    for me.
                          (beat)
                    They say imitation is the sincerest
                    form of flattery.

      He holds up the boots.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    What happened to honest craftsmanship? 
                    I only put a thousand miles on these
                    babies.

      MacLeod pushes the boots aside.

                                      MACLEOD
                    At least talk to Richie.  Convince
                    him the guy's a fake.

                                      METHOS
                    What makes you think he'll listen to
                    me?

                                      MACLEOD
                      Because...
                          (beat)
                    You'll be so damn sincere.

      His smile says he won't take no for an answer.  Methos sighs.

                                      METHOS
                    I left Katmandu for this.

      And OFF this --


      Richie faces Methos, as MacLeod and Dawson look on.  Methos
      tries to look uninvested in the outcome.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm afraid not.

      Richie looks from Methos, to MacLeod and Dawson.

                                      RICHIE
                    This guy isn't Methos.  He's Adam
                    Pierson.

                                      METHOS
                    I was for a while.
                          (beat)
                    I gave it up.

                                      RICHIE
                    I mean, look at him.  He's way too...

                                      METHOS
                    Yes... ?

                                      RICHIE
                    Ordinary.

      Methos looks at MacLeod.

                                      METHOS
                          (shrugs)
                    Maybe I should grow a beard.

      He starts away.  MacLeod pulls him back.  Richie looks to
      Dawson for help.

                                      RICHIE
                    Help me out, Joe.  I mean, five-
                    thousand years of wisdom?  Him?

                                      DAWSON
                    I dunno about the wisdom part...
                          (beat)
                    But five-thousand's about right.

      Richie stares.  He's starting to feel on shaky ground.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I know how you feel, Richie, but
                    what you see is what you get.
                          (beat)
                    This is the real Methos.

                    Are you sure?
                          (beat)
                    I mean, that's what HE said.  How do
                    you know it's true?

      BEAT.  MacLeod and Dawson trade looks.

                                      DAWSON
                    He's got a point, Mac.

      MacLeod looks to Methos, expecting him to launch into a
      convincing speech.  Instead, Methos shrugs.

                                      METHOS
                    I did my part.
                          (to MacLeod)
                    You did yours.
                          (re Richie)
                    And he's gonna believe what he wants
                    to.

                                      RICHIE
                    Don't you get it?  It doesn't matter.
                          (beat)
                    This Methos, that Methos...
                          (beat)
                    It's not the name I care about, Mac... 
                    it's the message I believe in.

      MacLeod flares in frustration.

                                      MACLEOD
                    The message is wrong and it's going
                    to get you killed.
                          (beat)
                    Richie, you just met him.  What he's
                    saying goes against everything we
                    know.  Why would you believe him?

                                      RICHIE
                    Because he offered me his life.  Why
                    would he do that?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Maybe he's afraid to fight.

                                      METHOS
                    Or maybe he knew you wouldn't take
                    it.

                                      RICHIE
                          (with sarcasm)
                    Right.

                                      METHOS
                    It worked.

                                      RICHIE
                    He didn't know it would.

                                      METHOS
                          (to MacLeod)
                    There's one born every minute.

      Richie shakes his head, almost pitying the others.

                                      RICHIE
                    I don't get this.  I mean, this is a
                    chance for peace...  a chance to end
                    the killing forever.

      He looks directly at MacLeod.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    Of all the people in the world, I
                    thought you'd understand.

      He turns and leaves.  There's an awkward silence.

                                      DAWSON
                    He's young, Mac.  Young people make

                    Maybe something will turn up.

      Dawson heads to the back room.  Methos stands there alone.

      Wasn't all this about him?

      Culbraith is on the deck, looking out to sea.  He gets a
      BUZZ, he turns.

      It's the "other Methos."  He approaches slowly, hands raised.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Who the hell are you?

                                      MESSENGER
                    My name is Methos.

      Culbraith reacts to the name.  A myth has come to life.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    You're not real.

                                      MESSENGER
                    I think I am.

      Culbraith reaches for his sword.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    And now you're looking for me?

      Messenger smiles.

                                      MESSENGER
                    Yes...  but not for the reason you
                    think.

      He opens his coat to show he is unarmed.

                                      MESSENGER (CONT'D)
                    I carry no sword.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Then you're a fool.

      He steps closer.  Messenger doesn't move to defend himself.

                                      MESSENGER

                    If you kill me, we won't be able to
                    talk.

      Culbraith pauses, eyes him suspiciously.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    There's nothing to talk about.

                    They say you lost your loved ones.

      Culbraith is thrown by this.

                                      CULBRAITH
                          (an edge)

                                      MESSENGER
                    Does it make it less painful?  Make

      Culbraith stares at him, lowers his sword.

                    They were hiding in a church when

                    They burned the church with them in

                    You wanted to weep, but you couldn't. 
                    You wanted to raise them up, hear

                    So you went out to kill.

                    But it didn't stop the pain.

      Culbraith shakes his head, numb.

                                      MESSENGER (CONT'D)
                    So you kept killing...  until you
                    couldn't remember their faces.  Your
                    wife, the children...  they were
                    gone.

                    I know your pain, William.  And I
                    know how to end it.

      He places a hand on Culbraith's shoulder.  Culbraith closes
      his eyes in pain.  Then --

      THE BUZZ.  Culbraith tries to recover, picking up his sword
      as

      The door BURSTS open -- MacLeod stands there, sword out,
      ready to fight.

                    MacLeod.

      Messenger raises his arms.

                                      MESSENGER
                    This doesn't have to be.

                    Please, put up your sword.

      MacLeod takes in Messenger.

                                      MACLEOD
                    So you're the new prophet.

      He moves in, but Messenger steps before him.

                    Whatever he did to you, he did out

      MacLeod stares at him, thunderstruck.

                    Yes, I knew Darius.  I know what he

      MacLeod leaves for the new world, telling Darius that he
      can't be like him.

                    When Darius asked you to consider
                    peace, you listened to him.  You
                    tried.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You're not Darius.

                                      MESSENGER
                    I carry the same message.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Why do you think Darius lived on
                    Holy Ground?  You don't make peace
                    by throwing away your sword.

                    one who wouldn't consider peace?

      MacLeod looks at Culbraith, sees the anguish in the man's
      eyes.  He hesitates.

      THE MESSENGER

      steps in front of Culbraith.

      Torn, MacLeod turns without a word, and leaves.

      It's late, the place empty.  MacLeod is leaning on a post,
      arms crossed, brooding.  Methos paces as Dawson looks on.

                    Meanwhile our gentle friend moves
                    on, spreading the good word.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm not a convert.
                          (beat)
                    And I don't intend to be.

                                      DAWSON
                    And what about Richie?

      And OFF this --


      A small church.  Richie is in a front pew, deep in thought. 
      He gets the BUZZ as MacLeod enters, walks up to sit beside
      him.  They stay that way a BEAT, then --

                                      MACLEOD
                    I thought I might find you here.

      Richie doesn't answer.  MacLeod senses his turmoil.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    It's a lot to think about.  Life,
                    death...  what it means.
                          (beat)
                    If it means anything.

      Richie nods, staring up at the stained glass windows.

                                      RICHIE
                    I want him to be right, Mac.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I know.

                                      RICHIE
                          (firm)
                    I don't like killing.

                                      MACLEOD
                    We've talked about this before,
                    Richie.  You're not supposed to.

      Richie looks at him.

                                      RICHIE
                    Change has to start somewhere.
                          (beat)
                    Wouldn't you like to live your life
                    without looking over your shoulder?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Yes, but it's not possible.  Not in
                    this life.  There's evil in the world. 
                    Real evil.  And it's up to good men
                    to stop it.
                          (beat)
                    If we don't, if we do nothing...
                          (beat)
                    Evil wins.

924CONTINUED:924

                                      RICHIE
                    So that's it?  It's just that simple?

                                      MACLEOD
                    If it's anything, Richie, it's not
                    simple.

                                      RICHIE
                    Mac...  I respect you more than anyone
                    I've ever known.  But I've got to
                    make my own decision about this.

      MacLeod places a hand on Richie's shoulder.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I know you do.

      MacLeod rises and leaves Richie to ponder.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


      MacLeod comes out from the kitchen area as Richie steps in
      from the elevator.  Richie's manner is tentative -- he's
      made a decision, but isn't sure how to announce it.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (beat)
                    You hungry?

      Richie shakes his head.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Don't suppose you came for a workout
                    either.
                          (beat)
                    So.  What happens now?

      A BEAT -- and Richie takes out his sword.  He holds it a
      BEAT, finding this difficult.  This is the blade MacLeod
      gave him.  He holds it out to MacLeod, like an offering. 
      MacLeod doesn't reach for it.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Richie, think about this.

                                      RICHIE
                    I have thought about it, Mac.  As
                    much as anything else in my life.

      MacLeod still doesn't take the sword.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You realize what you're doing?
                          (beat)
                    These aren't just weapons, Richie. 
                    They're part of us... of what we
                    are.

                                      RICHIE
                    Not me, Mac.  It's not what I am.
                          (beat)
                    Not any more.

      MacLeod sees he's made up his mind.  Slowly, reluctantly, he
      takes the sword.  There's a ceremonial feel about this -- a
      sense of finality and sadness.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96509     "The Messenger"     46.     Final Shooting Script 9/16/96

927CONTINUED:927

      MacLeod just looks at him a BEAT, letting it all play on his
      face.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    We don't have to agree on this.
                          (beat)
                    I'm sorry.

      He clasps MacLeod's shoulder, then turns and heads out.

      MacLeod looks at the sword in his arms.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Me, too.

      And OFF his look --


      MacLeod, Dawson and Methos are gathered, drinks all around. 
      MacLeod prods his hardly touched scotch.  Methos, sitting on
      the desk near MacLeod, shrugs at what MacLeod has just told
      him.

                                      METHOS
                    So.  The Pied Piper gets another
                    one.

      Dawson gives him a look.

                                      DAWSON
                    I suppose you'd know what to do.

                                      METHOS
                    You bet.  Standard response to
                      unforeseen dilemma, developed over
                    many centuries...
                          (beat)
                    Nothing.

                                      DAWSON
                    I think I like the other Methos
                    better.

                                      METHOS
                    You asked.
                          (beat)
                    Think I'll visit the men's room. 
                    Check out the latest graffiti.

      He slides off the desk and heads up the stairs toward the
      dojo locker room.  Dawson looks after him.

                                      DAWSON
                    Is it just me, or is he really a
                    jerk sometimes?

                                      MACLEOD
                    He's right, Joe.  There's nothing to
                    do.
                          (beat)
                    It's Richie's decision.  I have to
                    respect it.

                                      DAWSON
                    Even if it gets him killed?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I taught him how to survive.  What
                    he does with that has to be up to
                    him.

      He's trying to convince himself as much as anyone else. 
      Dawson shakes his head.

                                      DAWSON
                    Some guy comes along, says
                      everything's rosy.  No more death,
                    no more fear... hell, of course Richie
                    went for it.
                          (beat)
                    But this mistake's gonna cost him,
                    Mac.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's his to make.  It's a question
                    of integrity.

      As he says this, Methos returns.

                                      METHOS
                    There was this Spanish guy. 
                      Allejandro Diego Spinoza.
                          (beat)
                    One day the Inquisition pulls him in
                    for questioning.  Red-hot pincers,
                    tongs... the usual drill.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You got all that from the locker
                    room walls?

                                      METHOS

                    All he had to tell them was "no."

                    his money, his lands...

                          (beat)
                    But he would not give in.

      Dawson looks at him suspiciously.

                                      DAWSON
                    So what happened?

                                      METHOS
                      Allejandro?  Died in screaming agony,
                    of course.
                          (pointed, to MacLeod)
                    But he kept his integrity.

      MacLeod puts his drink down with a sigh.  He throws Methos a
      look.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Let yourselves out.

      He rises and leaves.  Dawson turns and looks at Methos.

                                      DAWSON
                    You are on calculating sonofabitch.

                                      METHOS
                    Thank you.  It's all a matter of
                      anticipation.

                                      DAWSON
                    Really.  Here, have one on me.

      He lifts a brimming glass -- and TIPS it onto Methos' lap. 
      Methos jumps up, drenched.

                                      METHOS
                    What the hell was that?!

                                      DAWSON
                    Just one of those unforeseen dilemmas.
                          (beat)
                    Surprised you didn't anticipate it.

      And OFF this --


      MacLeod and Methos are there.  Richie leans against the
      counter, looking somber and drained.  He's been through an
      emotional wringer.

                                      RICHIE
                    I don't even know what his real name
                    was.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Does it matter?

      Richie shakes his head.

                                      RICHIE
                    I'm sorry he's gone.  Maybe he wasn't
                    Methos.  Maybe he wasn't right...
                          (beat)
                    But he was good.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Yes, he was.
                          (in earnest)
                    And for a moment you thought...  you
                    hoped real peace for us was possible.
                          (off Richie's nod)
                    Me too.

      Methos stands with a self-deprecating shrug.

                                      METHOS
                    Sorry, I'm not what you imagined,
                    kid.

                                      RICHIE
                    It's okay.

                                      METHOS
                    Later.

      Methos starts to leave.

                                      RICHIE
                    Got any words of wisdom for me, old
                    timer?

      As Methos leaves, he turns back.

                                      METHOS
                    Nope.

      He's gone.

      Richie turns to MacLeod, extends his hand.

                                      RICHIE
                    Well, thanks for saving my life.
                          (with a smile)
                    Again.

      MacLeod takes it.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You won the fight.  I just leveled
                    the playing field.

      Richie moves to the door.

                                      RICHIE
                    I'm gonna get on the bike and head
                    out for a while.  Try to figure out
                    some things.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Those big questions.
                          (off Richie s nod)
                    Even if you don't find the answers,
                    keep looking.

      Richie nods and starts to leave.  MacLeod calls after him.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Richie.
                          (Richie turns)
                    Take care.

      As Richie smiles and nods --

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                            THE END
