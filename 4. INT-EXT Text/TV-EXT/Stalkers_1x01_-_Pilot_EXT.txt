HARPER (36), an LAPD detective.  Diane is tall and lean, her 
jet-black hair pulled into a tight bun that reflects her 
constant state of being -- vigilant, taut, tense.  This woman 
is the straining spring before the trap is sprung.  

Diane removes her sun-glasses.  THE FRAME EXPANDS as her eyes 
follow the trail of debris up the highway-- odd household 
items scattered amid broken glass, skid marks, oil, smoke. 

Several paces from Abigail s body, Diane kneels in the road.  
Her fingers trail across a constellation of paint chips and 
brake light fragments.  As if communicating with this 
evidence, Diane closes her eyes.  We witness the curious way 
her mind works, as we violently--

Diane follows a slick of oil up the highway.  

She glances to the median where her partner, CLIFF PARSONS 
(40) interviews the Husband from the SUV.  Affable but tough, 
Cliff left the Marines after Desert Storm.  He kept the hair

Dejected, Diane leaves Jane s house.  She checks her phone--

Diane looks in the exhibit.  An OPOSSUM blinks back at her.

NATURALIST (CONT D)
Opossums have adapted to urban 
environments.  They make their 
homes in burrows, in structures...

The opossum hisses and bears its teeth.  The kids love it.

NATURALIST (CONT D)
Whoa.  Her bark is worse than her 
bite.  She s fierce if cornered but 
her best defense is, of course-- 

The Naturalist raps the cage.  The Opossum falls over, dead.

NATURALIST (CONT D)
Playing possum.  Or I should say, 
 possums  since  playing  opossum 
are indigenous to Australia-- 

Cold realization spreads across Diane s face.  The ice cream 
cone falls from her hand.  Splat.

I have to go.

HENRY
What?  Why?  Mom!

Henry watches Diane frantically speak with his TEACHER then 
dash out of sight.84.


IN DARKNESS

WE HEAR the sound of MEN WORKING-- grunting as they pry 
boards from their studs.  Light filters through the cracks, 
partially illuminating the interior of this space-- PHOTOS, 
TWISTED DRAWINGS, MANIACAL SCREEDS.  A large section falls 
away.  BLINDING SUN LIGHT STREAMS in.  As it fades, we see 
Cox, training his gun on the opening.  He pokes his head in, 
gags, turns away and pukes. 

COX

 Romero uses a crowbar to widen the opening of the  Burrow 
 house.  Cliff, Julia and Diane step forward beneath Jane s
