Framed in the large picture window stands JACK CARTER,
alone, looking out at the night. He turns away as the heavy
satin curtains close, wiping him from view.
Express train plunges into a tunnel Blackness.
BEGIN TITLES:
The train speeds northwards. In the distance the stacks of
a lonely power station belch a continuous stream of brown
smoke.
A massive iron bridge crossing a river whips past. Its
mesh sides create an almost hypnotic effect.
The train breaks from another tunnel. Evening light cuts
across the track as the train hurtles on.
A chemical factory, brightly lit, passes by and the
outskirts of the city appear.
The street is fairly deserted.
Carter exits with other passengers from the train. He pauses
and looks about before crossing to the pub opposite.
The undertakers struggle with the coffin down the narrow
staircase into the street. Outside Carter and Doreen wait
with two men. EDDIE APPLEYARD, a middle-aged man, is wearing
a shabby tweed suit, cap and black tie. KEITH LACEY is a
young barman who worked with Frank.
EDDIE
We weren't sure where it was taking
place, like.
CARTER
Nice of you to come.
EDDIE
No. Frank was a good bloke.
KEITH
He was that.
EDDIE
One of the best.
As the cortege drives into the crematorium, it passes the
Land Rover parked outside. The same two men who passed
Frank's house are in it. A long and expensive-looking
funeral cortege passes out as they move up the driveway.
MARGARET is thirtyish, blonde, attractive in a tarty kind
of way.
Her heels are too high and she is wearing a cheap
pair of sunglasses. She walks quickly away, down the
cloisters, past the memorial tablets and urns.
Carter comes out of the chapel and sees her.
CARTER
Margaret.
Margaret stops and looks round. Carter joins her.
I thought
you weren't coming.
MARGARET
Changed me mind.
They face each other in silence. Margaret looks past Carter
and sees Doreen watching them at the end of the cloisters.
She turns away and starts walking slowly. Carter moves
with her.
Margaret continues nervously.
MARGARET
Everyhing go off all right?
CARTER
Fine...
(pause)
I want to talk to you.
MARGARET
What about?
CARTER
Doreen.
Margaret stops in her tracks and looks back at Doreen.
She's still watching them.
MARGARET
(adamantly)
She's nothing to do with me.
CARTER
(puzzled)
What do you mean? You've been
Frank's bird ever since her mother
cleared off. You're closer to her
than anyone.
MARGARET
(shaking her head)
No. No. It's not like that. I've
got a husband, you know.
Margaret starts walking again, fast.
Carter catches hold of her arm and stops her.
CARTER
Hold it!
Hold it!
(looking her in the
eye)
Who killed Frank, Margaret?
MARGARET
(nervously)
Killed?
I don't know anything
about it.
She moves off rapidly. Carter catches up with her.
CARTER
Really.
MARGARET
I must go. I'm in a hurry.
CARTER
I want to talk to you later.
MARGARET
I can't.
CARTER
Tomorrow morning, then?
Margaret dithers.
MARGARET
Well, all right then. Twelve o'clock
on the Iron Bridge.
Margaret walks off as calmly as she can, her high heels
clicking as she goes. Carter watches her disappear. Doreen
watches too.
The rain has just stopped. Bookies and punters lower their
umbrellas. Horses thunder towards the finishing post. Turf
flies in all directions as the jockeys whip their mounts
in a last desperate effort and the crowd roars.
Albert Swift is standing by a bookmaker's marking bis race
card with a biro. A hot dog is sticking out of his mouth,
like a cigar. A man of about thirty-five, be appears much
older, probably from an excess of booze and women. He looks
up, and his mouth drops open, the hot dog falling to the
ground. He has seen Carter.
Carter is pushing his way along the line of bookies, all
the time looking about him. The track loudspeaker announces
the winner of the last race.
Albert pales. He holds his race card in front of his face
and disappears into the crowd. As he moves off, his foot
steps on the hot dog and tomato ketchup oozes out.
Carter stands alone, casting an eye over the punters. His
eyes rest on someone the other side of the saddling ring
ERIC PAICE.
Dressed in a grey chauffeur's uniform, cap,
dark glasses and gloves, he is standing close to three
well-heeled-looking men with binoculars and shooting sticks.
Horses for the next race are being led around the enclosure.
Carter approaches from behind. He looks at Eric closely
before speaking.
CARTER
Grey suits you, Eric.
Eric swings round, startled.
ERIC
Good God!
Carter smiles.
CARTER
Is he?
ERIC
Jack Carter.
CARTER
(amused)
Eric. Eric Paice.
ERIC
What you doing around here then?
CARTER
Didn't you know this is my home
town?
ERIC
No, I didn't know that.
CARTER
Funny, that.
Carter takes out his cigarettes. Eric takes one.
ERIC
Thanks. So what're you doing? On
your holidays?
CARTER
No. I'm visiting relatives.
ERIC
Oh, that's nice.
CARTER
It would be. If they were still
living.
ERIC
Meaning what?
CARTER
A bereavement. A death in the
family.
ERIC
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
CARTER
That's all right, Eric.
Carter flicks bis lighter and gives Eric a, light.
ERIC
Well, well. Small world, isn't it?
CARTER
Very...
(pause)
So, who you working for these days
Eric?
ERIC
Oh, I'm straight.
(indicating uniform)
Respectable.
CARTER
(smiling)
What are you doing? Advertising
Martini?
ERIC
Oh, you've been watching television.
CARTER
Yeah,
(pause)
Come off it, Eric. Who is it?
Eric smiles back.
CARTER
Brumby?
Eric shakes his head.
CARTER
Kinnear?
Eric shakes his head
ERIC
What's it to you anyway?
CARTER
I've always ad your welfare at
heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm
nosy.
ERIC
That's not always a healthy way to
be...
CARTER
And you should know, if I remember
rightly.
A track announcement interrupts them.
CARTER
So you're doing all right then,
Eric. You're making good.
ERIC
Making a living.
CARTER
Good prospects for advancement, is
there? A pension?
(He can't resist it
any longer. He
lifts the sunglasses
off Eric's nose
and looks into his
eyes.)
Do you know, I'd almost forgotten
what your eyes looked like.
Eric stares back.
CARTER
They're still the same. Piss holes
in the snow.
ERIC
Still got a sense of humour?
CARTER
Yes, I retained that, Eric.
(He moves towards
the saddling ring
and turns to Eric.)
Do you know a man called Albert
Swift, Eric?
ERIC
Can't say I do.
Carter looks across at the track.
CARTER
Don't miss the start on my account.
Starting gates slam open and the horses leap out.
Carter comes through a wooded area. He pauses by a lake,
now overgrown with weeds. A big man stands tossing stones
into the water. Carter silently picks up a dead branch
then runs at the man. Carter whacks him on the head and he
collapses unconscious into the lake. Carter moves on towards
the house. MARTY and RAY the two men previously seen in
the Land Rover, are playing with an Alsatian on the spacious
lawn fronting the house. It's a Victorian building
surrounded by acres of woodland.
Carter breaks from the trees and darts for the side door.
One of the men notices and shouts after him.
Huge metal claw catches hold of an old car and lifts it
like it was a toy. The yard is beside the River Tyne. In
the distance a train crosses the Iron Bridge.
Carter is examining a beaten-up Hillman when the yard owner,
BILLY LAWS, approaches.
BILLY
(suspicious)
What do you want?
CARTER
What happened to this car?
BILLY
What's it got to do with you?
CARTER
This is my brother's car.
BILLY
Oh ay?
CARTER
Yeah.
BILLY
Well, he drove it into the river.
CARTER
Was the steering faulty?
Billy shakes his head.
CARTER
What about the brakes?
BILLY
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
CARTER
How'd it happen, then?
BILLY
He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
CARTER
Was he?
On the corner is a neon-lit snack bar. Doreen and another
young girl are sitting inside sucking milk shakes. Somewhere
a drunk is singing. His voice echoes up the alley.
Carter draws alongside and notices Doreen. He stops and
watches her. She hasn't seen him so he goes to the window
and knocks on it. She looks up and he beckons her outside.
Reluctantly, she comes.
CARTER
(gently)
You all right now?
DOREEN
Yeah.
CARTER
You coming to South America?
DOREEN
No.
Carter's hurt and slightly irritated by this rejection.
CARTER
Where you going to live, then?
DOREEN
At me friend's house.
CARTER
Where's that?
DOREEN
Wilton Estate.
CARTER
Nice family, are they? Church-goers
and all that?
Doreen nods.
CARTER
Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't
suppose I'll see you again.
(He pulls out a wad
of money, and peels
off some notes.)
There. Go and get your hair done.
DOREEN
(Can't believe it)
Thanks.
He lifts her chin with his finger and looks at her.
CARTER
Be good. And don't trust boys.
Doreen blushes and turns away. She rushes back to the snack
bar with the money to show her friend.
Keith kicks broken glass into the gutter while he waits.
Edna's next-door neighbour, an OLD WOMAN, watches. Carter
and Thorpe come down the street.
CARTER
Hello, Keith,
(pause)
Stay there, Thorpey.
He knocks on Edna's door. It flies open. Edna is furious.
EDNA
What the bloody hell do you think
you're at?
CARTER
(smiles)
I'm sorry.
EDNA
You don't look it.
CARTER
No. Really, I am.
EDNA
Don't come that bloody flannel
with me. If you're a traveller,
I'm bloody Twiggy.
(She points at
Thorpe.)
And who's he?
OLD WOMAN
What's going on? Have you no thought
for others?
CARTER
We're going inside.
EDNA
Inside? Why should I give house-
room to your sort?
CARTER
Up the stairs, Keith. The door on
the right.
OLD WOMAN
Everybody knows you, Edna Garfoot.
Everybody knew there'd be trouble
when you moved in.
Carter, Keith and Thorpe enter the house.
EDNA
You keep your trap shut, Ma.
OLD WOMAN
I'll send my old man to see you!
EDNA
And wouldn't he love it!
It's a large, new, ranch-style house, set back from the
road. The front garden is a landscape gardener's nightmare,
with its phoney brick and wrought-iron wishing well,
porcelain dwarfs, lily pond, the lot. Fairy lights hang
over everything.
There's a party going on. Lights are on in every room and
the rock music is loud. The drive is lined with sports
cars.
Carter parks and gets out.
Out of a side door a young man stumbles towards the lily
pond.
There, he promptly throws up.
Carter watches from behind a tree.
His attention shifts to the white Bentley turning into the
drive. It brakes sharply and the driver jumps out.
CLIFF BRUMBY has been to a police ball. He is impeccably
dressed in tuxedo and white scarf. Now he's hopping mad.
BRUMBY
Jesus wept!
MRS BRUMBY cowers in the passenger seat.
MRS BRUMBY
Now, Cliff, don't get mad.
BRUMBY
I'll murder the little bitch!
MRS BRUMBY
Cliff ...
Brumby roars up to the front door, banging it furiously. A
young woman in a party dress, expecting to greet a
latecomer, is stunned to see who it is.
SANDRA
Daddy!
BRUMBY
That's right, bloody Daddy.
SANDRA
I wasn't expecting you until three
o'clock.
BRUMBY
And this is what you call having a
few friends back for coffee, is
it?
Brumby pushes past her into the house.
BRUMBY
Running bloody riot over my bloody
furniture, drinking my bloody
booze...
The rest is lost as he disappears inside. He then powers
out through the side door
BRUMBY
... spewing over my fucking
goldfish.
He aims a kick at the young man's backside, sending him
face-down into the lily pond.
Mrs Brumby gets out of the car and hovers for a moment. As
she approaches the house, people pour out. Brumby appears
at the door with a boy pulling up his trousers.
MRS BRUMBY
Cliff ...
Brumby throws the boy out.
BRUMBY
Shut up, Phyllis.
(He walks back into
the house.)
Sandra!
Mrs Brumby goes into the house and closes the door. Brumby
passes an upstairs window as Sandra locks herself in a
bedroom.
BRUMBY
Sandra! Unlock the door, you bitch.
Carter pauses outside the front door and listens to the
row going on upstairs. He opens the door and goes in.
Carter walks up the deserted street to Edna's place. He
finds the front door unlocked.
It's Sunday morning. A girls' marching band rehearses on
the wasteground in front of the terraced houses. The Pelaw
Hussars march back and forth carrying their proud banner,
led by the drum majorette.
The Pelaw Hussars keep on marching. The back of their banner
a stirring motto For Youth and Valour.
As the band executes another movement, a red Jaguar slides
to a halt outside Edna's house. Two men get out. PETER the
Dutchman and CON MCCARTY are definitely not local lads.
They look, and are, lethal. They try Edna's front door. It
opens.
Con is the first to emerge from the front door.
CON
Mind you don't catch cold.
Peter follows.
PETER
I hope she's got understanding
neighbours.
Then Carter comes out, shotgun held across his chest.
CON
See you when you've got your drawers
on.
The old woman next door chooses that moment to come out
for her milk. As she straightens up, she sees Carter. The
bottle flies from her hand and smashes on her doorstep.
Carter, never taking his eyes off Peter and Con, slowly
backs into the house.
Washing hangs behind each house as far as the eye can see.
Carter drives full tilt through it, collecting towels and
sheets on the windscreen.
The coalhouse door is getting a terrible battering. It
finally gives and Con bursts out. He runs into the alley,
following after Carter.
Carter's car screeches as it corners from the alley on to
the road. Peter is leaning against the open door of the
Jaguar. When he sees Carter coming straight at him, he
scarpers for the pavement.
Carter hits the Jaguar's door
at speed, tearing it off. It flies up and crashes on to
the tarmac as Carter careers over the wasteground. Soon he
is out of sight.
Con comes running. Peter is looking at the damage.
PETER
Where were you, then?
Con sees what's happened to the car and is not pleased.
CON
Bollocks.
Carter pulls up outside a house and gets out. He takes the
washing off the car's bonnet, and throws it into a neglected
garden.
Carter presses the bell. The door's opened by a young man,
SHAMIR.
CARTER
Keith in?
SHAMIR
(shouts)
Keith.
No answer. Shamir watches Carter as he walks into the hall.
CARTER (O.S.)
Which is his room?
A wide road runs alongside the Tyne. It passes below the
vast steel bridges that link the two parts of the city. A
carpark lies at the foot of the 'Iron Bridge'. Carter pulls
up and parks. He gets out and moves quickly.
The bridge is a, massive structure. The traffic lanes are
flanked each side by pedestrian walkways. It is here that
Carter and Margaret have arranged to meet.
CARTER
How were things between you and
Frank?
MARGARET
He was all right to me.
CARTER
Nothing more? Just another feller?
MARGARET
Nicer than most.
CARTER
But he was just another feller,
wasn't he?
MARGARET
Yes.
CARTER
Though nicer than most?
MARGARET
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
CARTER
(ignoring the
statement)
Why'd you see him so regular?
MARGARET
Once a week?
CARTER
I call that regular.
MARGARET
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
CARTER
Once a week you like a gentleman?
MARGARET
(angrily)
Look, I'm me, right. You're not.
We are what we are, like it or
not.
(She turns and walks
slowly along the
bridge.)
Why all the bloody needle?
CARTER
What was bugging Frank?
MARGARET
He wanted me to leave Dave and
marry him. Last Friday I told him
it wouldn't work. Dave would have
killed us both!
(pause)
He followed me home and kicked up
a stink in the street,
(pause)
I had to tell Frank I couldn't see
him any more. It was getting too
dodgy. That was on Sunday.
(She stops and looks
over the bridge.)
He said he'd kill himself. I was
frightened what you might do.
They look at each other for a moment. Carter shakes his
head. He gently takes the sunglasses from Margaret's face
and folds them up.
CARTER
I don't believe you, Margaret.
Frank wasn't like that.
(pause)
I'm the villain in the family,
remember?
MARGARET
It's the truth.
Carter snaps her glasses in two and throws them away.
MARGARET
It is. Honestly.
CARTER
(shouting)
You bloody whore. Frank was too
careful to die like that. Who killed
him?
MARGARET
I don't know nothing.
Carter holds her arm. She winces like she's been hit before.
CARTER
Listen, the only reason I came
back to this craphole was to find
out who did it. And I won't leave
until I do. You understand?
Behind Carter Peter's Jaguar comes slowly along the bridge.
It stops. The passenger side is a gaping hole.
CON
Hello, Jack.
Carter swings round to see them, then swings angrily back
to Margaret.
CARTER
You bitch! It was you who told
them I was here, wasn't it?
He smacks her hard across the face. Margaret cries out.
The car draws alongside. A steel mesh separates the
pedestrian way from the traffic, so the two men can't get
to Carter until he reaches the end of the bridge. Con leans
out, his usual cheery self.
CON
Peter's very upset about his car.
He's going to shit all over you.
CARTER
I'll catch up with you later,
Margaret.
And with that he vaults over the handrail on to a corrugated
roof. Con jumps out of the Jaguar.
PETER
(shouts above the
revs)
Come on, get in.
Con does and they race off.
Carter arrives at the top of some narrow, steep, overgrown
steps leading down to the river road, where his car is
parked. He leaps down the steps as the Jaguar screeches to
a halt at the top. Con leaps out of the Jaguar and gives
chase. Peter backs the Jaguar and roars off.
Carter comes running down the steps with Con not far behind.
He arrives at the river road. In the distance, he can see
his parked car.
As he nears the car park, Peter's Jaguar comes down the
hill. It's going to cut Carter off from his car.
A Sunbeam Alpine sports car waits there. Its engine roars
into life and it races out of the car park. It reaches him
just before the Jaguar and slows down.
GLENDA
Over here, Jack.
Carter sees that the driver is GLENDA. The hood is down,
so he vaults into the car as it accelerates off.
The Sunbeam swings round, narrowly missing the oncoming
Jaguar, and roars away. Peter hasn't a chance. He's facing
the wrong way and has little room to manoeuvre.
Glenda laughs as the car swings wildly around a corner at
the top of the hill.
Carter steps out of the elevator as Glenda's Sunbeam comes
down the bottom ramp fast. The car brakes hard and stops.
Carter opens the door and gets in. Not a word is said.
Carter manhandles Glenda towards her Sunbeam. He opens the
boot.
CARTER
Get in.
Glenda climbs in and he slams the boot shut. The car
scorches away.
Carter parks the sports car as the ferry docks. He moves
down the gangway towards it.
Carter walks fast. There's the sound of a phone being
dialled. It's the GIRL in the cafe.
GIRL (V.O.)
Eric, he's come for Albert,
(pause)
I don't know, (pause) On the ferry,
I reckon.
Carter reaches the front of a betting shop. He walks in.
Carter turns to close the door. Albert runs for it. He
reaches the high double-gate at the end. It's locked and
he tries to climb it. No luck. Carter easily pulls him
down. Albert faces him.
CARTER
You can't get away from me, Albert.
ALBERT
I know.
He feels for his cigarettes but can't find them.
ALBERT
For Christ's sake, give us a fag.
Carter takes out his cigarettes. Albert takes one.
ALBERT
I didn't know who Doreen was.
Thought she was just another bird.
CARTER
Did Eric Pake pull her?
ALBERT
Yes.
CARTER
How?
ALBERT
I dunno. He's got his ways. He
knows Margaret.
CARTER
When did you find out?
ALBERT
A couple of weeks back.
CARTER
How?
ALBERT
No choice. I had a visit from
somebody.
CARTER
Who?
ALBERT
Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film.
He wanted to meet Doreen.
CARTER
And you told Brumby?
Albert nods.
CARTER
Who killed Frank?
Albert doesn 't answer.
CARTER
Do you want to be dead, Albert?
ALBERT
Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and
two of his boys arrive with Frank
and tell me that he's rumbled.
Somehow, he's seen the film and
was about to shoot his mouth off.
They ask me for some whisky and
start forcing it down his throat.
(pause)
I thought they'd just duff him up
a bit. Honest.
CARTER
What did you do?
Albert?
ALBERT
Nothing. What could I do?
CARTER
Did Eric know that Frank was my
brother?
ALBERT
Yes. I told him.
CARTER
What did he say?
ALBERT
'Good.'
Albert draws deeply on his cigarette.
They drove Frank away in a car.
CARTER
Is that all there is?
Albert nods.
CARTER
Then that's it, Albert.
Carter takes something from his pocket. There's a loud
click.
It's a. knife.
ALBERT
Jack, for Christ's sake ...
He falls to his knees.
CARTER
You knew what I'd do.
ALBERT
(crying)
Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't
kill him.
Carter drives the knife into him with all his might.
CARTER
I know you didn't kill him.
(and again.)
I know you didn't.
A ship's horn calls mournfully from the harbour. Albert
leans back. Blood seeps from his chest. He pitches forward,
twitches, and is dead.
The Sunbeam waits in the car park. Eric, Con and Peter
arrive in the Land Rover and park behind it. They go down
the gangplank to the floating jetty. A ferry is chugging
across the water.
As the ferry comes alongside, Eric, Con and Peter move up
to the rail. The passengers disembark, leaving Carter
standing alone.
He's holding Con's handgun.
Eric, Con and Peter hack slowly away to the steel shelters.
Peter, impatient as ever, pulls a sawn-off automatic shooter
from under his coat, cocks it and fires. Too late. Carter
is already safely behind the ferry's superstructure. Eric
shouts.
ERIC
No shooters. Cyril said no shooters,
you stupid bastard.
PETER
Get stuffed.
He's reloading.
CON
Gerald wants to see him first.
PETER
Shut up.
Carter is listening to all this.
CARTER
(shouting)
Are you coming in? Or do we piss
about all day?
Eric laughs.
ERIC
You're finished, Jack. You know
that, don't you? I've bloody
finished you.
CARTER
Not till I'm dead, Eric.
Eric laughs.
ERIC
Oh, you've still got your sense of
humour?
Tell him how I've fixed
him, Con.
CON
He's told Gerald about you and
Anna.
ERIC
Didn't believe us at first, did
he, Con? Then Peter talked to him.
PETER
Didn't even say goodbye. Just asked
us to take you back - alive.
ERIC
He's probably talking to her right
now. Are you still going to fancy
her when Gerald's finished with
her face?
Carter shows no emotion. Or are his eyes just that bit
sadder?
Peter lets rip again. Another window is shattered.
Carter ducks back, allowing Peter time to board the ferry.
Carter catches a glimpse of Peter as he climbs up the
ferry's superstructure to the roof. By the time he heaves
himself into position, Carter is waiting.
CARTER
Stay where you are, Peter.
Peter is helpless, clinging to the roof, unable to even
raise his shooter.
PETER
(screaming)
Don't.
There's a long pause while Carter looks at him, then he
cold-bloodedly shoots. Peter is blown away. By the time he
hits the deck, he's dead.
Con and Eric panic. They run up the gangplank, safely out
of range.
ERIC
Carter, your car needs a wash.
Eric signals to the driver in the Land Rover to bump the
Sunbeam into the water. Two hits and the task is done.
Glenda's screams are lost as the river wraps itself around
the sinking car.
Carter watches impassively.
Carter's hire car corners at speed into the high-rise
carpark.
Brumby comes out to the top tier. On the floor below,
Carter, unseen by Brumby, has parked and is now making for
the concrete spiral staircase.
Brumby pounds down to the first level. Carter comes around
the corner.
BRUMBY
Jack!
Carter slams his fist hard into his gut.
CARTER
You shouldn't have shown the film
to Frank.
BRUMBY
I had to. It was the only way I
could get at them.
The huge steel superstructure pivots on a large man-made
island in the middle of the river.
On top is a structure not unlike a small lighthouse, from
which a man operates the bridge. Carter climbs the outside
ladder. A man waits for him at the top.
The man hands him a small cloth package. Carter opens it.
Inside is heroin and a hypodermic. He wraps it up again
and hands over an envelope. The man checks the money as
Carter disappears down the outside ladder.
Crowds of people come pouring out. It's the end of the
evening's entertainment. Margaret walks out with her friend.
Carter follows them and turns up a side street.
The place is deserted. Margaret and her friend descend the
steps. The clop of their high heels is the only sound.
Carter follows discreetly. At the bottom, Margaret and her
friend chat for a moment and part.
Carter follows Margaret.
The clop of Margaret's shoes is heard in the distance. She
appears. Carter is following behind. He slips into another
dark alley to get ahead of her. As she reaches her home
Carter's arm shoots out from behind a pillar. It's holding
Con's handgun.
CARTER
I've come for you, Margaret.
Carter stands in the dimly lit kiosk with Margaret. The
hire car is parked alongside.
CARTER
It's Carter. Listen carefully, you
hairy-faced git. I've got the film
and enough evidence to put you
away for a long time. All it takes
is one call to the police.
Carter into phone.
CARTER
I'll do a simple deal with you.
All I want is ...
Headlights, through the thick trees, as Carter's car comes
bouncing over rough ground.
Carter and Margaret stop.
CARTER
Take your clothes off.
Margaret is confused.
Take your clothes off.
Margaret
does just that: coat, blouse, skin. She goes to remove her
knickers.
CARTER
Keep your pants on.
(pause)
Lie down.
Again she obeys.
He kneels on her, pinning her arms with his knees, then
stuffs a gag in her mouth.
He takes out the hypodermic, places it against her arm,
and injects the heroin into her. She struggles, her eyes
moving frantically about. She screams, but its muffled by
the gag.
Carter holds her down and she quickly goes under.
Carter removes the gag. He stands, picks her up and walks
into the darkness with Margaret in his arms.
Eric comes out of the front door. Inside the party is still
in progress. He gets into a Cadillac and drives off.
Carter is parked where he can see the drive up to Kinnear's
house.
The Cadillac appears and swings on to the road.
There's the sound of a phone being dialled.
CARTER (V.O.)
Police.
A long line of police cars move slowly up the drive,
followed by a police bus. They park by the front door and
around fifty policemen pour out. They move silently around
the building. A chief constable opens the front door and
walks in.
The house is surrounded by police measuring and
photographing, and outside the house are police cars and
ambulances.
The lawn is crowded with the party crowd. In
the early-morning light, they look like dolls.
Kinnear comes out of the front door with two plain-clothes
officers and gets in a police car. Sirens going, it comes
down the short drive to the gate.
Carter parks his car and picks up the shotgun and a bottle
of Scotch off the back seat. He get out and walks over to
the jetty and along a lower gangway. At the far end, a man
is standing. It's Eric Paice. Eric turns around abruptly.
He sees Carter and disappears up the nearest stairway.
Carter follows.
At the top he stops to listen, but can see and hear only
the harbour waters lapping below.
Carter looks back to the coal jetty, just in time to see
Eric scamper down to the level below. Eric sprints for the
roadway. Carter waits and then starts running directly
above him.
Eric keeps running. Carter stays always overhead. He's
playing cat and mouse with Eric.
CARTER
(calling out)
You couldn't win an egg and spoon
race, Eric.
ERIC
(wheezing)
Sod off.
Paice darts down another staircase to ground level and
makes for the roadway. Carter stops above the roadway.
Below, Paice makes for the parked car. Carter holds the
gun up. Eric stops and looks up.
CARTER
Stay away from the car or I'll
blow you apart.
Eric darts under the jetty. Carter runs on down the steps.
He can see Eric scampering along the row of cottages towards
the beach. Carter starts after him.
Eric runs out on to the beach. The only sounds are his
feet pounding the pebbles and his hurtful panting.
In the distance, factory chimneys belch out smoke.
Carter
appears. For a moment he watches Eric stumbling along at
the far end of the beach. He climbs down to the beach and
starts running.
Carter is gaining on Eric rapidly. Eric looks round and
panics. He stumbles and falls over.
He gets to his feet quickly and disappears round the
headland. Carter follows.
On the other side of the headland, the scene is
extraordinary. The deserted beach is like the edge of the
world. The sand is black as far as the eye can see. It's
littered with rubbish. Several old lorries are sunk deep
in the sand. High, grass-covered cliffs flank it on the
left. It's deserted.
In the distance, a continuous line of giant black buckets
move, like cable-cars, out to sea, before they deposit
their load of coal slag and move inland again. The coal
mine itself is inland, hidden away behind the cliffs. The
sea, like the sand, is black as it crashes on to the shore.
Eric is half-way along the beach, struggling in the mud.
Carter closes on him.
Eric nears the line of buckets and cuts inland towards the
mine.
Carter has nearly caught up. The buckets grind and
crash as they move along the cable.
Eric scrambles up the narrow valley down which the coal
slag travels. He is panting horribly. Carter is close on
his heels.
Near the top, where the buckets are practically
at ground level, Eric stumbles and falls. He is too
exhausted to get up.
Carter stands over him.
CARTER
(panting slightly)
Stand up, Eric. Stand up.
Eric just manages it. Carter pulls the bottle of Scotch
out of his pocket.
CARTER
I bet you could use a drink, could
you, Eric?
He throws the bottle to Eric.
CARTER
Eh? Have a drink.
ERIC
Still got your sense of humour.
Eric takes the cap off and looks at Carter. He's in a
terrible state.
CARTER
Drink up, Eric. Drink up. I want
you to drink all of that. Do you
understand? Drink up. Just like it
was with my brother, Frank. Go on,
son. Drink up.
Eric pours the whisky into his month. It spills over and
runs down his face.
CARTER
Drink up, Eric.
Eric begins to stagger about.
CARTER
It was you who poured it down him.
Eh, Eric?
Eric takes a breather and looks pathetically at Carter. No
mercy there.
CARTER
Did you all have a good laugh, eh?
Did you have a good laugh when he
was spewing it up? The whisky is
pouring all over Eric's face and
suit.
It's disgusting to watch. Suddenly, he retches, but nothing
comes up.
CARTER
Drink it! Drink it! Did you all
pass the bottle round after the
car went over the top?
Eric is choking.
CARTER
Don't stop, Eric.
Carter leans forward and with his free hand lifts the bottle
up to Eric's mouth again. In the other, he holds the
shotgun.
Eric chokes and retches. Carter has seen enough.
CARTER
Goodbye, Eric.
Carter raises the butt of the gun and brings it down on
Eric's head.
Eric's body, loaded on to a a coal bucket, moves off on
it's final journey. Carter, laughing, walks beside it, gun
riding on his shoulder. The bucket shudders and grinds as
it moves along the cable. Eric's body moves of on its final
journey. It reaches the end of the line, where an automatic
catch tilts it. Eric's body drops into the sea. The coal
slag follows in a cloud of black dust. The waves pass over
and everything is gone.
Carter stands for a moment, turns and walks back along the
beach. He stops, looks at the shotgun, and decides to get
rid of it.
Below, Carter moves slowly by the edge of the sea. He raises
the shotgun to throw it away. High on the clifftop a rifle
and telescopic lens line up on Carter. A finger curls around
the trigger. On the middle finger of the same hand is a
large gold ring with the letter 'J' engraved upon it. It
is the man Kinnear contacted after sending Eric to his
death.
The finger tightens on the trigger and pulls it. There's a
quiet, whooshing sound. Carter drops to the ground.
Carter lies on the beach. The waves lap around his head. A
small trickle of blood pours out of a hole in his temple.
He's dead.
Kinnear's hit man coolly dismantles his rifle. He carefully
wraps it in a cloth fishing-rod carrier. He walks off and
is soon lost as he drops out of sight.
