      STUDENTS hurry across sun-dappled green lawns beneath stately 
      old-growth trees on the way to classes in sleek modern  
      buildings.  

      OVER WE HEAR:

                    The human mind is a vast universe.  
                    An inner cosmos that we are only 
                    now beginning to explore.


        ESTABLISHING SHOT of a sleek modern building with a SIGN 
      telling us it s THE STUTZER INSTITUTE. 


      Jane and Lisbon exit the building.

                                  JANE
                    If his machine really works, he s 
                    going to put us out of a job.  We 
                    should firebomb the place.

                                  LISBON
                    I can t see it.  Humans are more 
                    than just electrical appliances.

      Sophie Miller approaches, on her way into the building.

      Beat.  Jane s actually awkward.

                    Uh, this is Agent Lisbon.

                                  SOPHIE
                    Hello.

                                  LISBON
                    Hi.  
                          (to Jane)
                    I ll wait at the car.

      Lisbon ambles away.

                                  SOPHIE
                    Thank you for getting me out. 

                                  JANE
                    Wasn t me. It was the Animal 
                    Equality League that sprung you.

                                  SOPHIE
                    It s the thought that counts.  
                    You re looking very well.  How have 
                    you been doing?

                                  JANE
                    Good.  And you?

                                  SOPHIE
                    I ve had my issues. 

                                  JANE
                    I don t know why that should 
                    surprise me.  I suppose all 
                    patients assume their doctors have 
                    no problems themselves.

                                  SOPHIE
                    Who d consult a sick doctor?  It s 
                    one of the reasons I left clinical 
                    practice and switched to pure 
                    research.

      Jane changes tone, asking for a serious answer.

                                  JANE 
                    What are they exactly?  Your 
                    issues?  I mean, what s the story 
                    with you and Alex Nelson?  Assault?  
                      Restraining orders?

                      controlling but damaged and 
                      emotionally unavailable men.

      They smile. 

                                  JANE 
                    But you and Alex had made a truce. 

                                  SOPHIE
                    Yes.

                                  JANE
                    But you were arguing with him just 
                    before he died.

                                  SOPHIE
                    About work.  Is this an 
                      interrogation?  Because I d like a 
                    lawyer present if it is.

                                  JANE
                    Sorry.  I just started wondering  
                    about the logic of it all.

                                  SOPHIE
                    What logic?

                                  JANE
                    You saved my life.  I owe you.    I 
                    would do anything to repay that 
                    debt.  You know that, right?

      She nods.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    But you re innocent, so, why do you 
                    need my help?  Why am I here?

      Beat.  She frowns at him, struggling with emotions she wants 
      to hide.

                                  SOPHIE
                    Maybe I just wanted to see you 
                    again.   Now I have.  Good-bye, 
                    Patrick.

      She walks away, into the building.  On Jane, watching her go, 
      conflicted...

      FLASHBACK


      Jane takes a beat, walks away toward the car, where Lisbon is 
      waiting.  


      Cho, Van Pelt and Rigsby are suiting up, checking equipment 
      as the local SWAT TEAM gets into position.

      Rigsby shakes his head. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    This could get nasty.

      Cho stares at him, contemplates saying something, shakes his 
      head and gets back to getting ready.  


      Lisbon on the phone as she walks, Jane in deep thought, 
      keeping pace beside her.

                                  LISBON
                          (disappointed)

      She puts away the phone.
