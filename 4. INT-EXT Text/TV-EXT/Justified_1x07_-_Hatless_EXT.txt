      Raylan and the Drunks emerge from the BACK DOOR.  It s all 
      dust and dumpsters.  Raylan removes his coat and hat.

                                  DRUNK #1
                    You better not call the law after 
                    we tune you up.

                                  RAYLAN
                    That s not what I d be worried 
                    about right now if I were you.

      Drunk #1 comes at Raylan first.  Swings and connects, Raylan 
      almost relishing taking the shot.  Drunk #1, now thinking 
      this is gonna be easy, goes to swing again but Raylan HITS 
      HIM FIRST LIGHTNING QUICK, staggering him back --

      As Drunk #2 quickly pounces from behind.  Raylan, with some 
      difficulty, fights him off --

      As Drunk #1 comes back at Raylan, connecting again --

      And we continue like this.  Brutal.  Old school.  Despite 
      being hammered and outnumbered Raylan s holding his own, 
      giving as good as he s getting, seemingly enjoying every 
      second of it until Drunk #1 grabs a 2x4 and HITS RAYLAN from 
      behind, sending him to the ground.  The Drunks proceed to 
      work Raylan over, kicking him, punching him, about to inflict 
      serious damage when we HEAR --

      A LOAD being RACKED into a SHOTGUN.  Everything stops.  
      REVEAL the BARTENDER, holding the shotgun.  It s not pointed 
      at anyone, he s just holding it.

                                  BARTENDER
                    Think that ll about do it.
                          (beat, then)
                    I don t want no hard feelings;

                    you boys are good customers in hard 
                    times, why I m not pointing this at 
                    anyone in particular.  But I can t 
                    let you beat a man to death out 
                    back of my place.

                                  DRUNK #1
                    We wasn t gonna kill him.  Just 
                    give him what s coming.

                                  BARTENDER
                    Looks like he s had that and more.

      The Drunks nod.  Okay.  They dust themselves off, leaving 
      Raylan on the ground, in the kind of pain that no amount of 
      whiskey can numb.

                                  DRUNK #1
                          (to Raylan)
                    You don t come back here again.  
                    You hear me, faggot?

      Raylan lifts his head, watches as Drunk #1 takes Raylan s 
      HAT, places it on his head.  The three of them walk off.

      Raylan lays for a moment, seriously banged up, considering 
      what to do next.

      Then O.S. we hear the BACK DOOR OPEN and then CLOSE.  Watch 
      FEMALE LEGS come towards Raylan.  Slowly at first, trying to 
      discern if it s him.  Then, realizing it is she hustles to 
      him, kneeling down as we reveal --

      WINONA, mix of pity and incredulity on her face.

                                  WINONA
                    Raylan?  What in God s name did you 
                    do?

                                  RAYLAN
                          (hurting, woozy)
                    You re late.

      Off Winona, tending to Raylan, who s on the verge of blacking 
      out...

      FADE IN:


      Raylan, with Winona s help, reaches his front door.  He looks 
      awful, still isn t cleaned up from the fight.  He slumps 
      against the wall as he fumbles with his keys.  Everything 
      hurts.  Winona is half sympathetic, half pissed off.

                                  WINONA
                    You couldn t keep your mouth shut 
                    for two more minutes?

                                  RAYLAN
                    They were insulting the honor of a 
                    young lady.  I felt compelled to 
                      intervene.

                                  WINONA
                    You are so full of it.

      As Raylan unlocks the door and they move into --


      A perfectly nice home on a perfectly nice street.  Middle 
      class.  Quiet.  A lawn.  Probably something like what you 
      grew up in.  MOVE OFF THE HOUSE TO FIND --

      GARY HAWKINS, sitting in his car, staring at the house.  He 
      looks conflicted, uneasy... but beyond that, he looks like 
      shit.  Hair mussed.  Clothes wrinkled.  Tired.  He s a man 
      backed into a corner, and it shows.  Steeling himself he gets 
      out of the car, starts towards the house.


      Find TOBY GRIFFIN, Black, early 40s, watching TWO YOUNG GIRLS 
      play on a jungle gym.  Meanwhile, from the BACK DOOR of the 
      house, watch AMANDA GRIFFIN, 30s, black, pretty and put 
      together, exit, followed closely by Gary.

      Toby sees Gary, smiles, moves to greet him.

                                  TOBY
                    Gary the Hawk.

                    How are you, Toby?

      The two embrace like the old friends they are.

                                  TOBY
                    Can t complain.
                          (then, to his daugters)
                    Girls, say hi to Gary...

      The girls smile, wave.  Gary smiles back, waves.

                                  GARY
                    Hi girls.

                    some pads on  em, get them out on

                    No.  Our daughters are not playing

                    Why don t you guys go inside, catch 
                    up.  There s wine and cheese in the

                          (as the boys head off)
                    Good to see you, Gary.

                                  GARY
                    And you, Amanda.

      Off Amanda, a touch skeptical of Gary as he and Toby head 
      towards the back door, and we CUT TO --           EPISODE 107 - "HATLESS" - 2ND GOLD REVISIONS - 1/17/10    11.



      Raylan s towncar pulls into the parking lot of a shabby 
      office space... maybe a strip mall.  Hatless Raylan steps 
      out.  Compares the ADDRESS on the building in front of him to 
      the ADDRESS on the CARD that Wynn Duffy gave Winona.


      Raylan exits the bar.  Walking towards his car, he looks to 
      where Billy Mac was parked.  But much to his surprise, 
      Billy s CAR IS GONE.  Raylan stops, looks around: nothing.  
      Raylan s wondering what would make Billy leave like that, 
      when his PHONE RINGS.  He answers it:

                                  RAYLAN
                    That was quick, Tim --
                          (then)
                    Sorry Pinter, was expecting another 
                    call.  No, no, thanks for getting 
                    back to me, whatta you have?

      Off Raylan, heading towards the Towncar.


      Gary, exiting his offices.  He locks the door behind him.  
      The parking lot is quiet and mostly empty.  We hear CAR DOORS 
      SLAM.  Gary turns.  There are Duffy and Billy Mac, 
      approaching him.  Gary tries to play it cool, but the truth 
      is he s scared shitless, and with good reason.

                                  DUFFY
                    Working late?

                                  GARY
                    That s right.  You talk to Arnett?

                                  DUFFY
                    I did.

                                  GARY
                    And?

      Billy Mac walks up, PISTOL WHIPS GARY.  Gary goes down hard, 
      on the verge of literally crapping his pants.

                                  DUFFY
                    I would describe his attitude 
                    towards your suggestions as... 
                      unreceptive.

      Gary, cowering, tries to get away from Billy Mac, who grabs 
      him, pushes him up against the office doors.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)          EPISODE 107 - "HATLESS" - 2ND GOLD REVISIONS - 1/17/10    31.

                                  DUFFY (CONT D)
                    For a supposedly smart guy you re 
                    making bad decisions here, Gary.  
                    Bringing Toby into all this, for 
                    example.

      Gary doesn t miss that Duffy just addressed Toby by name.

                                  GARY
                    Toby...

                                  DUFFY
                    Took me a minute, but I remembered 
                    where I d seen him.  Hell of a 
                    player.  Shame about the knee.

      Billy Mac extracts Toby s SUPER BOWL RING, drops it in Gary s 
      lap.  Gary holds it in his trembling hands.

                                  DUFFY (CONT D)
                    Did you honestly think Arnett would 
                    just lay down?

      Duffy now gets right in Gary s face.

                                  DUFFY (CONT D)
                    You have until nine tomorrow 
                    morning to get the money, including 
                    interest.

      Billy Mac, without a word, HITS GARY again.  Gary basically 
      whimpers, blood running from his mouth.

                                  DUFFY (CONT D)
                    Find a way.  Or the next ring will 
                    be your wife s... and we might just 
                    take her finger along with it.

      Off Duffy and Billy Mac, walking away, leaving Gary bloody 
      and terrified, no way out...

                                                                              BLACK.

      Watch Billy Mac exit his car, keys in hand.  He approaches 
      his front door.  Unlocks it.  Is just opening it and stepping 
      inside when he s --


      Gary, HUGE KNOT SWELLING on the side of his head, CUT on his 
      cheek, KNOCKS on the front door.  A moment later, it s opened 
      by Amanda.  Fire in her eyes.

                                  AMANDA
                    You got a lot of nerve coming back

                    No, Gary.  I am not o-kay.  My 
                    daughters and I came home to find 
                    two men beating Toby half to death!  
                    And Toby s telling me not to call 
                    the cops, because of something you 
                    and he went and did!

                                  GARY
                    I am so sorry --

                                  AMANDA
                    You re damn right you are.  Now I 
                    want you to turn your sorry ass 
                    around, and do whatever it is you 
                    have to do to make this right, you 
                      understand?

      Then, behind her, Toby approaches, using CRUTCHES because of 
      his knee.  He got it much worse than Gary, looks awful.

                                  GARY
                    Jesus, Toby...

      Amanda turns, about to tell her husband to lay back down.

                                  TOBY
                    Cool out baby, it s okay.
                          (Amanda hesitates)
                    Just give me a minute.

      Amanda glares at Gary, but leaves he and Toby alone.

                                  GARY
                    I m so sorry.  Are the girls --

                    too much to risk.

      Gary takes this in.  He s in real trouble.

                                  TOBY (CONT D)
                    See they came at you too.  You know

      Gary shakes his head, his eyes welling up with tears, anger.

                          (incredulous)
                    Don t do anything stupid...  Think 
                    the ship s sailed on that one.

      Gary reaches into his pocket, pulls out TOBY S RING.  Hands 
      it back to him.

                                  GARY (CONT D)
                    I m sorry I got you involved in 
                    this.

      Toby takes his ring, watches as Gary turns, walks away from 
      the house, face hard as stone, eyes that no longer have any 
      fear in them, just the resignation of what he s about to do.


      Raylan s car pulls up next to GARY S CAR, headlights on.  
      Raylan steps out.  








































                                                                              (CONTINUED)          EPISODE 107 - "HATLESS" - 2ND GOLD REVISIONS - 1/17/10    42.

      Alone, illuminated by the headlights is GARY.  He s standing, 
      facing Raylan s car, but because of the HEADLIGHTS can t see 
      anything.  He s holding the GUN.

                                  GARY
                    Who s there!?

                                  RAYLAN
                    It s Raylan, Gary.

      It takes Gary a moment to process this.

                                  GARY
                      Raylan....
                          (squinting, staring)
                    But, you re not wearing your hat.

                                  RAYLAN
                          (seriously, the hat?)
                    Look, you mind putting the gun 
                    down?

                                  GARY
                    You re the last person I expected 
                    to see.  Winona tell you I d be out 
                    here?

                                  RAYLAN
                    She mentioned it was a possibility.  
                    Tried a few other spots first.  
                    Including Duffy s office.

                                  GARY
                          (takes this in, then)
                    So you know what I did?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Gary, need you to put that gun 
                    away.

                                  GARY
                          (looks at it, then)
                    I can t do that, Marshal.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I don t think shooting me is gonna 
                    help you, and I m the only person 
                    here.

                                  GARY
                    No, you re not.

      And with that, Gary raises the GUN TO HIS OWN TEMPLE, and off 
      the shock on Raylan s face --

                                                                              BLACK.

                                        ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:


      Where we left off.  Gary, in the headlights, GUN to his head.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You really gonna do that?

                                  GARY
                    Thought you knew, Marshal Givens.  
                    I m worth more dead than alive.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Gary, I swear, you re lucky I m on 
                    vacation because if I had my gun on 
                    me right now I d shoot you myself.  
                    Only way you could make all this 
                    worse is by leaving Winona out to 
                    dry, which is what you re about to 
                    do you pull that trigger.

      Gary considers it.  Lowers the gun.  Raylan begins to 
      approach him.

                                  GARY
                    Hey, you keep your distance --

                                  RAYLAN
                    Come on, Gary.  I just want to talk 
                    to you, damned if I m gonna yell to 
                    do it.

      Gary seems to accept this.  Calms down.  Raylan saddles up 
      next to him.  A beat.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                          (then, re: the field)
                    Nice piece of land.

                                  GARY
                    That s what I thought.  Near two 
                    major highways.  Ten minutes from 
                      Lexington s wealthiest suburbs.  
                    This was my shot.

      Raylan kind of smiles to himself.  Gary notices it.

                                  GARY (CONT D)
                    What, that s funny?




                                                                              (CONTINUED)          EPISODE 107 - "HATLESS" - 2ND GOLD REVISIONS - 1/17/10    45.

      CONTINUED:2929

                                  RAYLAN
                    No, it s just... You ever hear much 
                    about my father?

      Gary shakes his head.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    I thought Winona might ve mentioned 
                    him at some point.  Doesn t matter.  
                    Point is, the man was scheming 
                      constantly.  Usually something 
                    illegal, but just the same, always 
                    some big plan or other in his head.  
                    Talked an awful lot about all the 
                    things he was gonna do.  But all he 
                    ever actually did was pick the low 
                    hanging fruit from another man s 
                    tree.  My father was full of some 
                    righteous bullshit.

                                  GARY
                    He passed on?
                          (Raylan looks at him)
                    You kept saying  was .  Past tense.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Huh.  Guess I did.  Wishful 
                    thinking, I suppose.
                          (Gary just stares)
                    Plenty of men talk a lot about what 
                    they re gonna do.  Not many have 
                    the stones to actually do it.

                                  GARY
                    Oh, I did it all right.  Dug myself 
                    a hole I won t ever get out of.

                                  RAYLAN
                    It was gonna be a mall, right?

                                  GARY
                      A capitalist destination.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Tell me about it.

                                  GARY
                    What?  Now?

                                  RAYLAN
                    We re here, aren t we?




                                                                              (CONTINUED)          EPISODE 107 - "HATLESS" - 2ND GOLD REVISIONS - 1/17/10    46.

      CONTINUED: (2)2929

                                  GARY
                    You ve gotta be kidding...

                                  RAYLAN
                    Humor me.  Pitch me before you off 
                    yourself.

      Gary considers it.  Fine, why not?  He leads Raylan away from 
      the cars, to the other side of what we now see is a MASSIVE 
      BILLBOARD, on it an AMAZING SHOPPING CENTER.  Outdoors.  
      Glass storefronts.  Wonderfully landscaped, trees in the 
      middle.  Think  The Grove .  It s impressive, a place you d 
      want to be.

                                  GARY
                    Shopping, restaurants, 10 screen 
                    movie theater.  A horse stable for 
                    the kids; true Kentucky through and 
                    through.  Nothing like it anywhere.  
                    Whole layout is Feng Shui, designed 
                    to increase spending.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Looks like it s all outdoors... 
                    What do you in the winter?

      Gary smiles, enthusiastic, now really hitting his stride:

                                  GARY
                    That s gonna be the best part.  
                    We ll tent the walkways, use 
                    hanging space heaters.  String 
                    lights in all those trees, have 
                      horse-drawn carriage rides along 
                    the main drag, Santa s workshop set 
                    up there at the north end.

      And as Gary describes it the weight seems to drop from his 
      shoulders.  He really believes in this, and we kind of do, 
      too.  For the first time we see what Winona sees in him, his 
      vision and passion, a rare thing in this world.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Gary, I have to admit, I m 
                      impressed.

                                  GARY
                    Thank you, Raylan.  I do appreciate 
                    that.

                                  RAYLAN
                    But you know, nice as it is, 
                    doesn t seem worth dying over.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)          EPISODE 107 - "HATLESS" - 2ND GOLD REVISIONS - 1/17/10    47.

      Gary s shoulders visibly slump a bit.  Back to reality.

                                  GARY
                    Figure if I kill myself, least 
                    Winona gets the life insurance.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Come on, Gary.  You know well as 
                    anybody you kill yourself it ll 
                    negate your coverage. 

      Gary takes this in.  Yeah, down deep he knew it, but he s 
      having trouble confronting the reality right about now.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    Gotta man up, Gary.  You know what 
                    has to happen.

      Gary considers this.  Heartbreaking.

                                  GARY
                    I do that, I ve given up.  All of 
                    this will have been for nothing.  
                    I ll be starting at zero.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Maybe.  But that s the only play 
                    you have left.

      And in this moment, Gary knows that it s over.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    Gonna be daylight soon.  They give 
                    you a time?

                    Nine.

                          (checks his watch, then)
                    I ll go with you, if you like.  But 
                    I wasn t lying when I said I was on 
                    vacation.

                                  GARY
                    This what you do on your vacation?

                                  RAYLAN
                      Apparently it is.

      Begin to pull up and away from these two men, standing 
      together, illuminated by headlights, out in the middle of 
      nothing, darkness all around them.


      Aftermath.  Police cars.  Ambulances.  The Thug on a 
      stretcher.  Arnett being interviewed.  A zoo.
