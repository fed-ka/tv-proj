page breaks in hard copy indicated by ---page break---

regular tabs, hard returns and right flushes are used 
to position things to look as much like original as possible

sometimes the formatting changes slightly (as in the numbers at
the end of the lines), but I'm going to keep consistent because
it's easier

logo on front page will be noted when used but not included here

as this may be sent in .txt, originally underlined words will 
look like   _this_

I don't know what the (X) designates.

 2  INT./EXT. LOIS' APARTMENT WINDOW - VIRTUAL REALITY - NIGHT2(X)

    Lois is standing alone... in a low-cut evening gown,
    superbly sexy. She's watching something on the ground below
    with bemused interest. CRASH!


 3  EXT. METROPOLIS STREET - VIRTUAL REALITY - NIGHT              3   

    It looks like a battlefield... the orange glow of FIRES,
    destroyed CARS.  In the middle of it all -- a fatigued
    SUPERMAN is fighting a super-battle with a HUGE MAN, who's
    dressed in street fighting gear: work boots, long baggy
    shorts, a shirt with ripped sleeves.  This huge fellow is
    called... KOMBAT.  Muscles bulging, Kombat is a specimen --
    a comic book artist couldn't draw a more powerful and
    statuesque figure.


 4  A CROWD OF ONLOOKERS                                          4   

    roped off like spectators, is gathered on the street corner,
    next to a RED CAPUCCINO CART, watching the two gladiators      (X)
    with amazement. Some eat popcorn, others sip sodas, coffee.


 5  SUPERMAN                                                      5   

    bravely sets his jaw, and FLIES right at Kombat -- a BLUE
    BLUR, which RICOCHETS off Kombat's chest like a pinball,
    then CRASHES through the window of a building across the
    street.

    Kombat pulls Superman from the window and THROWS him across
    the street -- destroying a car.


 6  A MAN                                                         6   

    watching with the other onlookers, stares with awe, munching
    caramel corn.

                  Superman?  I don't think so.  Meet
                  your replacement.

    Kombat rips open his shirt to reveal an "X" on his chest.
    It's very similar to Superman's "S".

    Superman steps weakly from the wreckage, almost collapses.
    He leans on the car for support.

                                   SUPERMAN
                  Enough.  You win.  You're the
                  better man.

    Superman looks sadly to Lois at her veranda, then flies off.

    They come together in an embrace.

                  I was getting so sick of him.

10  INT. VIRTUAL CENTER CHAMBER - REALITY - DAY #1               10   

    We're watching this on a Virtual Screen (a large monitor).
    In front of the screen, WE FIND JAXON XAVIER, known more
    simply as "X", a strange-looking, freakish fellow with a big
    grin.  He wears a VIRTUAL HELMET and a SLEEK BLACK SUIT.
    WIRES from the chair are attached to helmet and gloves.  On
    his LEFT WRIST is a very distinct WATCH.  On its face are
    the initials "L.L." and a small lever.

    The screen in front of him projects what he/we were
    seeing -- Kombat kissing Lois Lane, and Jaxon is living the
    role of Kombat!

                                   JAXON
                  I'm not playing, I'm rehearsing!

    Kombat breaks away from the kiss, flashes Lois a killer
    smile, then "clicks" the lever on his watch (the escape
    window) and DISAPPEARS.


12  INT. VIRTUAL CENTER CHAMBER - DAY                               12

    Jaxon takes off his virtual helmet.  The screen in front of
    him is FROZEN with the image of Lois Lane.

                                   JAXON
                  I need to get used to the idea that
                  in this world I may be just another
                  geek with a lotta RAM... but in
                  that world, I'm a god.  Being a

                  Owww!  Chief, you can't just pull 
                  virtual goggles off somebody.  It's 
                  dangerous.  If I was in a virtual 
                  program, you could mess with my 
                  mind.

                                   PERRY
                  If they're that dangerous, then you 
                  shouldn't be putting them on.  Now, 
                  what in Sam Hill are those things,

    Lois and Clark have each slipped on a pair of VIRTUAL 
    GOGGLES, and a pair of VIRTUAL GLOVES.  The goggles are not 
    yet over their eyes.  Their VITAL SIGNS are displayed on a 
    monitor next to them.  Jaxon checks to make sure all the 
    wire connections are secure.

    He does a double-take at Clark's vital signs, which are 
    _way_ different than Lois'.  Jaxon bangs the side of the 
    machine.  Clark sees this, checks Lois' display -- closes 
    his eyes, and his display suddenly reads the same as Lois'.

    empty plates in front of her.  Clark nurses a soda.  Lois
    polishes off her sandwich.

                                   LOIS
                  And it puts a little more pressure               (X)

                  I can't fly! Run!

    They start running, the car gaining and gaining, closer and
    closer, Lois trips and rolls out of the way.  The car          (X)
    shoots past her, staying on Clark.                             (X)

    hops up on the sidewalk -- the car jumps up on the sidewalk    (X)
    behind him -- smashing everything in its path, including a
    fire hydrant, which SPEWS WATER.

    watches Clark run, starts to her feet.  A HAND helps her       (X)
    up.  It's SUPERMAN.                                            (X)

    is still running -- the car almost on top of him!  At the
    last possible second, Clark LEAPS in the air -- catches hold
    of a flagpole sticking out from the side of a building -
    hoisting himself up, and out of the car's path!

    The car CAREENS out of control, and comes to a SMASHING HALT
    as it SLAMS into a bus stop!

    Lois looks at Superman, then backs up in fear and runs to      (X)

    Jaxon is still working on Clark's vital sign monitor.  He
    has a control panel open, and tools strewn about the floor.

                  Jaxon, they've arrived at Lois'
                  apartment.  How are we coming?

                                   JAXON
                  Just a few more minutes.  It seems
                  Mr. GQ here has shorted out some
                  circuits.

    He hits Clark in the shoulder, but hurts his hand.

                                   JAXON (CONT'D)
                  Ouch! He's thicker than he looks.

    They enter, and the place looks the same.  Everything
    appears normal.

                  What do we do now?

                  Act normal.

    She takes a deep breath.

                                   LOIS

                  You know, on the beach he showed
                  up when you and I were kissing.
                  And that car chased us when we were

    He does.  They separate.  Look around.

                  Still nothing...

    They kiss again, really deep, and passion starts to take 
    over.  They are barely able to pull apart.

                                   CLARK
                  Anything?

    They fall onto the bed.  She takes off his glasses, loosens
    his tie, while he unbuttons her jacket and peels it off her

    Jaxon still has his head inside the console.  He reaches for
    another tool.  Lois and Clark are going crazy on the
    monitor, but Jaxon is unaware.

    Clark's vital signs suddenly go haywire -- and everything
    shorts out!  There is smoke, sparks, and Jaxon runs for his
    Master Chamber.

    Jaxon looks up at the monitor.  His eyes go wide -- Lois and
    Clark locked in their embrace.

                                   JAXON
                  I have an idea.  If she's so hot

                  That's right.  She's trapped in my
                  virtual world, and only I can let
                  her out.  I control the escape

                  Superman learns pretty fast.  He
                  jumped us out of VR into a section
                  of the computer's unused memory.
                       (looks around)
                  I don't know how long we can hide

                  Whoa. Lex. My man.
                       (off Lois' look)
                  Sorry.

                                   LOIS
                  I'm not sure what he wants.  Except
                  that he's obsessed with what Lex
                  wanted to name our children.

                                   JIMMY

                  Access to what?

                                   JIMMY
                  Well, I think this is Luthor's                   (X)

                  Yeah.

                  He kept you around so he wouldn't 
                  feel too guilty but he never told 
                  anyone you were his son, did he?  
                  Never said he was proud of all the 
                  work you did for his company?  
                  Never gave you his name?  In fact, 
                  he told people you were dead!

    ... Kombat getting smaller, thinner...

                                   SUPERMAN
                  No wonder you like it in here.  You 
                  can shut all that out, pretend it 
                  never happened.

                                   LOIS
                  It _did_ happen and no matter where 
                  you run, you can't hide what you 
                  really are.

    ... finally revealing himself to be... Jaxon.  A very sad, 
    very angry boy in a big man's Kombat clothes.

    At that moment, Jimmy jumps on Jaxon's back.  Superman grabs 
    the watch off him.

    Lois clicks it.  Lois Jimmy, and Superman DISAPPEAR in a 
    FLASH.

                                   JAXON (CONT'D)
                  No... no...
                       (looks at his wrist)
                  NOOOOO!

68  INT. VIRTUAL CHAMBER - REALITY - DAY                         68   

    Lois removes her goggles. Sees Jaxon flailing violently at
    the control center, shouting --

                                   JAXON
                  NOOOOOOOOOOO!

    He kicks so hard he disconnects his goggles and monitors.
    We hear a sizzle, as if something in the computer is
    shorting out.

    An O.S. WHOOSH and Superman and Jimmy enter with several
    COPS.  Superman moves to Jaxon.  He is slumped, lifeless.      (X)

                                   LOIS
                  What happened?

                                   SUPERMAN
                  He disconnected.

                                   JIMMY
                  Is he dead?

                                   SUPERMAN
                  He's breathing but...                            (X)

    Lois glances at the VR monitor, which is now just electronic
    garble.                                                        (X)

                                   SUPERMAN
                  Jimmy?

    Jimmy goes to the keyboard.

                                   JIMMY
                  It crashed.                                      (X)

                                   LOIS
                  How?

                                   JIMMY
                  I'd have to run a diagnostic but it
                  seems like... he did it.  On
                  purpose.

                                   LOIS
                  So he could still be in there?

                                   JIMMY
                  His mind, anyway.  And if it is,                 (X)
                  it's not a place you'd want to be.

    They all look at the info-jumbled screen, the comatose         (X)
    Jaxon.

69  INT. PLANET - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY #2                       69   

    Amid the computer network assembled by Jimmy.  Perry shakes
    his head at Lois, Jimmy and Clark.

                                   JIMMY
                  Ten computer experts have been in
                  and out of Jaxon's system for a                  (X)
                  week.  No sign of the VR world,
                  Luthor's programs, or X.

                                   PERRY
                  I tell ya, I never trusted those
                  machines and now I know why.  You
                  try and separate mind from body,
                  you're asking for a world of
                  trouble.

                                   CLARK
                  Chief, you're preaching to the
                  converted.

                                   LOIS
                  Amen.

    Lois takes Clark's arm, and they move off..

                                   JIMMY
                  Speaking of conversions, I can't
                  change your mind about picking up
                  the board and surfing the love net?

                                   PERRY
                  Jimmy, I'm too old to surf and too
                  smart to think you can catch love
                  in a net.

    He exits.  Jimmy shrugs and slips on virtual goggles.


70  AT CLARK'S DESK                                              70   

    He prints out the story.

                                   LOIS
                  Clark? I've been thinking...
                  about... that thing?

                                   CLARK
                  Mm hm.

                                   LOIS
                  I just want you to know how glad I               (X)

                  new.

                                   CLARK
                  Good.  Because that's what happens               (X)
                  to me everytime I see you.                       (X)

                  honeymoon.                                       (X)
                       (kiss)
                  But, in the mean time, what do you
                  say we go get some pastrami?

                                   CLARK
                       (moving off)
                  Russian dressing.

                  Sliced pickles.

                  Side of slaw.

                                   LOIS
                  And a crrrream soda...

    As they walk off, CAMERA HOLDS on CLARK'S COMPUTER MONITOR.
    It displays the Daily Planet Menu.  A small, "glitch" and we
    suddenly see JAXON'S FACE fill the screen, looking for a way
    out.  Another "glitch" and Jaxon disappears.
