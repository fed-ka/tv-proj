      IKE EVANS bolts upright from his nightmare. He wipes his 
      sweaty forehead, getting his bearings in the dark. Ike looks 
      around his familiar Miramar Hotel owner s suite, down at his 
      ex-showgirl wife, VERA, sleeping nude beside him. Something 
      glitters beneath Vera s arm. Ike slips a sequinned dog collar 
      from beneath her. Vera rustles in her dream.

      Ike quietly gets up and, holding the dog collar, peers under 
      their bed. Nothing. He puts on his monogrammed Miramar Hotel 
      robe and walks into the dark living-room, glancing around for 
      the dog. He steps through the curtains and out onto the 
      penthouse balcony.


      Ike crosses the vast marble hotel lobby cradling Vera s dead, 
      wet, POODLE.  [A glittery banner, stretched across the lobby, 
      reads: SWING WITH SINATRA - MIRAMAR NEW YEAR S EVE!]  

      VICTOR VALIENTE, Miramar General Manager, runs from behind 
      the front desk, chasing after his boss.

                                  VICTOR
                          (over his shoulder to 
                            FLORENCE, the night 
                            manager)
                    Call Danny! Now!... Mister Ike! 
                    Wait!

      Victor sprints after Ike. Florence grabs the phone.


      DANNY EVANS, 21 and Ike s youngest son, sleeps soundly on a 
      bed littered with scribbled legal pads and law school books. 
      The phone startles him awake.

                                  DANNY
                          (listening)
                    ...Be right down.

      Danny rolls out of bed, throwing on his clothes.


      Ike strides into his building. He stops, turns and walks back 
      to the front entrance. Ike kneels beside a stainless steel 
      nozzle protruding from the pink marble wall.

                                  IKE
                          (to Bellhop)
                    You. New guy. 

      The young BELLHOP rushes over.

                                  IKE (CONT D)
                    What s your name?

                                    BELLHOP
                    Ray. Ray. Marcus.                                                                                      4.


                                  IKE
                    Ray-Ray, put your hand here. Right 
                    here.

      Ray puts his palm in front of the hole.

                                  IKE (CONT D)
                    What do you feel?

                                  RAY
                    Feel?... Nothing.

                                  IKE
                    Exactly. 
                          (standing)
                    Perfumed air is supposed to blow 
                    out of this nozzle 24 hours a day. 

                                  RAY
                    Perfumed? What s it smell like?

                                  IKE
                    Like... the ocean... and new money. 
                    Get Cecil the engineer. Okay?

                                  RAY
                      Absolutely.

                                  IKE
                    You ever wonder why we keep it so 
                    cold in here?

                                  RAY
                    No sir.

                                  IKE
                    It s a goddamn meat locker, right?
                          (leaning closer to Ray)
                    So the ladies can wear their furs. 
                    That s our job, Ray-Ray, we sell 
                    the dream.

                                  RAY
                    Yes sir... Sir? It s, it s just 
                    Ray.

      Ike turns, heads across the lobby.

                                  IKE
                          (over his shoulder)
                    Not any more.                                                                                      5.



      MOVE through the locals, tourists and all-nighters who fill 
      the deli to a rear booth. MIKE STRAUSS a short, stocky Hotel 
      Workers Union lawyer and Ike share the red leather banquette.

      Mike wolfs down his pickled herring.

                                  IKE
                    ...You re nuts. Never happened.

                                  MIKE
                          (shaking his head)
                    We stood on the seawall behind Al 
                    Capone s house on Palm Island with 
                    a case of his champagne--

                                  IKE
                          (waving him off)
                    Crazy.

                                  MIKE
                    --And you got the bright idea to 
                    throw every single bottle against 
                    the rocks.

                                  IKE
                    Why? Why would I do that?

                                  MIKE
                    To see  em explode. You blew up a 
                    case of 1929 Dom Perignon!                                                                                    10.


                                  IKE
                    Yeah. Well. They went off like 
                    bombs... Hey. I was ten.

                                  MIKE
                    You always loved trouble.

                                  IKE 
                    No more. Too expensive....  
                          (sipping his coffee)
                    Mikey, you gotta pull your guys.

                                  MIKE 
                    First of all, they re not  my 
                    guys , I m just an underpaid Union 
                    lawyer, and two, do the right thing 
                    Ike -- benefits, minimum wage... 
                    unionize. Come on. It s almost 
                    1959. The future s with us.

                                  IKE
                    My people are happy. You know that. 
                    They don t want it. I pay  em 
                    better than any hotel on the Beach. 
                    I m not the problem.

                                  MIKE
                    You re the biggest. You go. The 
                    whole strip ll go.

                                  IKE
                    Hey. I will go. We had two goddamn 
                      hurricanes this fall which cost me 
                    the High Holidays. I blew Christmas 
                    thanks to you. I have to make good 
                    on Frank s New year s run or it s 
                    over.... You shut me down and then 
                    what? 

                                  MIKE
                    Maybe the next guy runs an open 
                    shop. I m sorry Ike. I am.


      Mike shoves away his plate and slaps a five dollar bill on 
      the table.

                                  MIKE (CONT D)
                    Who you like in the Orange Bowl?

                                  IKE
                    Syracuse.                                                                                    11.


                                  MIKE
                    Two TD underdog? Oklahoma s a 
                    machine.

                                  IKE
                          (shrugs)
                    Syracuse has the Zimmerman kid at 
                      quarterback. Gotta back the Yid.

                                  MIKE
                    No chance.

                                  IKE 
                    Tell it to Goliath.

      Ike grabs Mike s arm.

                                  IKE (CONT D)
                    Mike, this could get ugly. This 
                    will get ugly.

      Mike smiles, stands.

                                  MIKE 
                    Not from me, pal. We strike. We 
                    picket. We negotiate. We don t 
                    drown dogs.

      Mike slaps Ike affectionately on the shoulder...

                                  MIKE (CONT D)
                    Give Vera a squeeze for me.

       ...and leaves.

      Ike sits in the booth and sips his coffee, watches his old 
      friend walk onto Collins Aveneue.


      Stevie, smoking a Kool, knocks at Ike s front door. Nothing. 
      He rings the bell.

                                  VERA (O.S.)
                          (from inside)
                    Yes?

                                  STEVIE
                    It s me. My dad there?

                                  VERA (O.S.)
                    Come on in.                                                                                    12.


      Stevie enters the suite. Vera stands in a floor-length, 
      beaded, skin-tight gown. At forty-two, still a total 
      heartbreaker. A SEAMSTRESS kneels, pinning one side of her 
      gown tighter.

                                  VERA (CONT D)
                      Unfortunately, this is supposed to 
                    fit like second skin. Killing me.

      Stevie nods.

                                  VERA (CONT D)
                    What do you think?

                                  STEVIE
                    Fine. Looks good.

                                  VERA
                    You think he ll like it?

                                  STEVIE
                    Safe bet. He here?

      Vera stares at herself in the marble-ized wall mirror.

                                  VERA
                    At Wolfie s. Some breakfast 
                    meeting.

                                  STEVIE
                          (heading for the door)
                    He calls let him know I m down in 
                    the Atlantis.

                                  VERA
                          (turning to Stevie)
                    Stevie?

      He stops.

                                  VERA (CONT D)
                    Is everything all right? You know 
                    with the strike. And tonight?

                                  STEVIE
                    What s he say?

                                  VERA
                    He says yes.

                                  STEVIE
                    Then it is.

      Stevie leaves. Vera stares after him.                                                                                    13.


                                  SEAMSTRESS
                    Now, take a deep breath.

      Vera does.


      Stevie shuts the door behind him. He jabs the elevator button 
      and, watching the floor lights ascend, lights up another 
      Kool.



      MERCEDES VALIENTE, Victor Valiente s pretty, 17 year-old 
      Jewban (Jewish-Cuban) daughter and a part-time Miramar 
        housekeeper, wheels her cleaning cart down the hallway. The 
      elevator doors open. Danny Evans looks up and seeing 
      Mercedes, jams his hand between the closing elevator doors. 
      He steps out into the hallway. Mercedes turns, sees Danny but 
      continues pushing the cart to the next room.

                                  MERCEDES
                          (knocking on the door)
                      Housekeeping?

      No answer. She uses her pass key and enters. Danny follows 
      her into the hotel room.

                                  DANNY
                    Hey.

                                  MERCEDES
                          (stripping the bed)
                    Hey.

      Danny helps her strip the sheets.

                                  DANNY
                    You re in a great mood.

                                  MERCEDES
                    I have to work tonight.

                                  DANNY
                    On New Years? Sinatra s playing 
                    down--

                                  MERCEDES
                          (shoving the dirty sheets 
                            into her cart)
                    Hey! One of us owns this place. And 
                    one of us is a maid.                                                                                    14.


                                  DANNY
                    You re a maid like I m a cabana 
                    boy. Your Dad-

      Mercedes tosses Danny the toilet brush

                                  MERCEDES
                    Works for your Dad.

      Danny drops the brush onto the bed.

                                  DANNY
                    I ll see you later.

      He leaves. Mercedes sighs, sits on the bed, chin in her 
      hands. The door flings open. Mercedes leaps to her feet. 
      Danny blows back in.

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    Be my date tonight?

                                  MERCEDES 
                    Your date? Like date, date?

                                  DANNY
                    Yeah. No. I don t know. Come with 
                    me. Whatever you wanna call that. 
                    What s the big deal? We re friends. 
                    Friends go do things.

                                  MERCEDES
                    Right.

                                  DANNY
                    Right?

                                  MERCEDES 
                    Yeah. Absolutely.
                          (waving the toilet brush)
                    I can t go anyhow. I told you--

                                  DANNY
                    I ll get Stevie to change your 
                    shift.

      Mercedes blinks at him.

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    What?

                                  MERCEDES
                    I don t have anything to wear.                                                                                    15.


                                  DANNY
                    See you at eight.

      Danny leaves. 


      Danny stands outside her room. He hears Mercedes loose a 
      delighted squeal and, lovesick, leans his forehead against 
      the door. Danny smiles and heads down the hallway towards the 
      elevators.


      A few HOTEL GUESTS nervously eye the chaos outside. Ike 
      motions to Victor behind the front desk.

                                  IKE
                          (quietly to Victor)
                    Get Bonnie. Have her do something 
                    at the cabanas. Bikini contest. 
                    Fashion show. Some damn thing. Give 
                     em free champagne and 
                      screwdrivers. I don t want anyone 
                    in the lobby. Nobody sees this.

                                  VICTOR
                    You got it.

                                  IKE
                    Stevie?

      Victor nods towards the Atlantis Lounge.                                                                                    16.



      Shifting blue from the pool window behind the bar bathes 
      Stevie and the lounge. Stevie stands behind the bar, sipping 
      what appears to be grapefruit juice, lost in thought.

                                  IKE
                    You look like hell.

      Stevie watches his father cross the empty lounge.

                                  STEVIE
                    You know what Lenny Bruce always 
                    says,  You only live once and 
                    sometimes not even then. 

      Ike leans over the bar and takes the drink from Stevie, 
      wincing at the vodka.

                                  IKE
                    Who the hell is Lenny Bruce?
                          (handing Stevie the glass)
                    Starting New Years a little early?

                                  STEVIE
                    How d it go with Mike Strauss?

                                  IKE
                    We re on our own.

                                  STEVIE
                    Son of a bitch.

      Ike sits on a bar stool facing Stevie and the glowing blue 
      pool windows.

                                  IKE
                    I always hated New Years. Even as a 
                    kid. Always seemed like the 
                    tourists were having the only good 
                    time. Couldn t compete with that. 

      Stevie nods. 

                                  IKE (CONT D)
                    I had my nose to the glass.

      Ike stares into the shifting blue, remembering, snaps back, 
      focusing again on his son.

                                  IKE (CONT D)
                    No more. Not tonight. Not in my 
                    joint. You know who s upstairs in 
                    my goddamn hotel?                                                                                    17.


                                  STEVIE
                    Mr. Frank Sinatra.

                                  IKE
                    Damn right. Francis Albert Sinatra. 
                    In my presidential suite. And 
                    tonight he s gonna step out onto my 
                    stage in my hotel and ring in my 
                    goddamn New Year.

                                  STEVIE
                    That sounds like fun.

      Ike grabs Stevie s drink and tosses it back.

                                  IKE 
                    Sounds like a helluva lot of fun.

      Ike hops off the stool, Stevie right behind him.


      Stevie and Ike stride down the Miramar arcade row past gift 
      shops, the ice-skating rink, bowling alley.

                                  STEVIE
                    ...So basically you got a warehouse 
                    full of booze sitting in Ft. 
                      Lauderdale and no way to get it in 
                    here.

                                  IKE
                    Not until now.

                                  STEVIE
                    Where you gonna find guys that 
                    crazy?

      They reach GRADY  CADILLAC  JAMES  shoe shine stand. Grady, a 
      former light-heavy weight champ, reads the paper on his 
      stool. The celebrity wall behind him is covered with photos 
      of movie stars, athletes, world leaders -- all inscribed to 
      Grady.

                                  IKE 
                    Not crazy. Hungry... Champ!

                                  GRADY
                    Thunder and Lightnin .

                                  IKE
                    Grady, tell junior here what you 
                    told me.                                                                                    18.


                                  GRADY
                    Some of my boys, you know, boxers 
                    at the Sir John -- if I ask  em, 
                    they ll drive for y all.

                                  STEVIE
                    It could get messy.

                                  GRADY
                    You pay cash, these fellas ll park 
                    your whiskey in the lobby.

      Ike turns to Stevie.

                                  IKE
                    What you waiting for?

      Stevie smiles. 

                                  STEVIE
                    Let s go Champ.

      Grady climbs down from his shoeshine stand and hangs a 
       closed  sign on his  Wall Of Fame . He and Stevie head back 
      down the arcade towards the elevators.

                                  IKE
                    Hey! The Miramar doesn t hire 
                    dopers or felons.

                                  STEVIE
                    Do my best.


      Ike starts after them, stops and heads down the arcade to a 
      shop called  Sea Breeze Fine Lingerie . The shop window is 
      filled with silk, satin, frilly things. Ike enters the shop.


      No customers. Ike walks up to the glass display case. A MAN 
      growls on the phone in the back room.

                                  MAN (OS)
                          (on phone)
                    ...Your call, kid. The card room? 
                    Yeah, right off the lobby but we 
                    got a thousand dollah limit on dat 
                    game...

                                  IKE
                    Mel? It s Ike.                                                                                    19.


                                  MEL (OS)
                    Back here.

      Ike steps through the display cases filled with corsets and 
      slips into the back room.

      MEL JAFFE

      sits in the cramped storeroom, Racing Form in his lap and 
      cigar jammed in his mouth, phone to his ear. Mel is a solid 
      block, a torpedo with a face like a fist. Mel Jaffee is the 
      last man on earth to sell lingerie.

      A bulletin board covered with the scrawled names of today s 
      Gulfstream Race Track horses and Flagler greyhounds hangs 
      behind Mel. Three fuzzy TV screens play three different 
      football bowl games. Several telephones sit silently on a 
      desk next to empty legal pads. A typical bookie spread.

                                  MEL (CONT D)
                          (on phone)
                    ...But if you got the juice you 
                    say, there s the cabana game 
                      tonight... Cabana One, next to the 
                    ice machine... All night. That 
                    game s no limit... Fine. You let me 
                    know.

      Mel hangs up.

                                  MEL (CONT D)
                    If dat momser s got two nickels to 
                    rub together, I m a Rockette. Hey. 
                    Ike. I m dyin  here. It s like a 
                    morgue. I had to let Iggy go. Dead. 
                    No action. And it s the season for 
                      christsake! I got ponies, dogs, jai-
                    lai -- I got bubkas!

                                  IKE
                    What do you want me to do, Melvin?

                                  MEL
                          (rolls his eyes)
                    You know what you gotta do. Talk to 
                    our friend. Hey. You gotta cut the 
                    head off this thing. You can t ax 
                    Francis Albert to walk tru dat 
                    circus tonight. Somebody s gonna 
                    get hurt... I heard dey killed 
                    Vera s pup.  Come on now, that s 
                    just wrong.

      Ike nods, studying the thug.                                                                                    20.


                                  IKE
                    Yeah. They did.

      Ike stands.

                                  IKE (CONT D)
                    So where is he?

                                  MEL
                    Now you re thinkin . He just got 
                    home from his honeymoon.

                                  IKE
                      Honeymoon? Ben divorced Doris?

                                  MEL
                    Kind of. She died in childbirth.

                                  IKE
                    I didn t even know she was 
                    pregnant. Jesus. Didn t Ben s first 
                    wife die in childbirth too?

                                  MEL
                    Yeah, what re the odds? This new 
                    kid s a real beauty. Legs to here. 
                    Like Cyd Charisse. Benny s smilin . 
                    Now s the time to get him. Good 
                    luck, Kid.

                                  IKE
                    Thanks.

      Ike leaves the back room. The phone rings.

                                  MEL (O.S.)
                    Sea Breeze Linger-- Hey, Fat Tony! 
                    Fatboy, you in or you out?...

      Ike leaves the empty lingerie store.


      Ike crosses the lobby to the hotel s Trevi dining room. An 
      angry COUPLE storms out.

                                  MAN
                    ...And they charge more than the 
                      Fontainebleau!

                                  WOMAN
                    Get me out of here, now!

      Ike steps into the enormous dining room.                                                                                    21.



      Dozens of angry GUESTS stand at their tables complaining 
      loudly. Vera carries a plate of eggs to a furious diner with 
      one hand, while cradling  Fluffy  in the other. Danny pours 
      water for guests. There are no busboys or wait staff 
      anywhere.

                                  IKE
                          (to himself)
                    And what fresh hell is this?

      Ike weaves through the tables to Vera.

                                  GUEST 1
                          (to Vera)
                    These eggs are ice cold!

                                  GUEST 2
                          (to Vera)
                    It s a goddamn fruit salad! How 
                    could it take 40 minutes?

                                  VERA
                          (to Ike)
                    Do something!

      Ike rushes towards the kitchen, blows through the double 
      doors.


      Twenty-five WAITERS, WAITRESSES, COOKS and BUS BOYS huddle 
      around a transistor radio. A SPANISH ANNOUNCER s VOICE fills 
      the room.

                                  IKE
                    Oye! People! What the hell?

      Victor, the hotel GM, turns, ashen from the radio.

                                  VICTOR
                    Batista has run away.

      Ike absorbs the news.

                                  VICTOR (CONT D)
                    Tonight Che will be in Havana.

                                  IKE
                          (quietly)
                    We, we could use some help out 
                    there.                                                                                    22.


                                  VICTOR
                    You understand, Mister Ike?  You 
                      understand? Cuba is Castro s now.

      Ike nods and turns back towards the dining room. Victor 
      watches him leave, returns to the radio, still blaring the 
      news.


                   






                         END OF ACT 1

                       

















                                                                                                          23.


                               ACT TWO




      Stevie and Grady James walk through the dimly-lit lobby. 
      FANS, GUESTS stop Grady every few steps for an autograph or a 
      word. Stevie follows the champ into the back room. 


      Two huge Black BOXERS pound each other in a make-shift ring.  
      A crowd of MEN shout, wager, arms draped over the ropes. 
      SEVERAL YOUNG BLACK BOXERS in street clothes drift over to 
      greet Grady. 

                                  GRADY 
                          (to Stevie)
                    Go look around Junior. Gimme five 
                    minutes with the fellas.

      Stevie nods and heads back to the lobby.


      Stevie sits in a worn velvet chair, takes out a Kool and 
      lights up. A woman s voice, singing the ballad  Tenderly , 
      curls into the lobby. Stevie gets up and follows the music 
      through the doors marked  Knight Beat Club  down a dark stair 
      and into the small, empty club.


      Stevie lets his eyes adjust to the darkness. ELLA FITZGERALD, 
      the Queen herself, sits on a stool rehearsing  Tenderly  with 
      her pianist. Stevie moves to the bar and grabs a stool, 
      watching perfection at work. Ella sings.

      CLOSE - A WOMAN S MANICURED HAND

      wraps around Stevie s, cupping his cigarette.



      WIDER - STEVIE                                                                                    24.


      turns. 

        A raven-haired, Ava Gardner, BEAUTY stands behind the bar. 
      She slowly lifts Stevie s hand, her eyes fixed on Ella, and 
      using his cigarette, lights the one between her red lips.

      She gently sets Stevie s hand back on the counter and pats 
      it, never taking her eyes off Ella.

      Stevie somehow pulls his eyes from her and turns, watching 
      the music. The Beauty leans across the bar, onto her elbows, 
      her bare shoulders grazing Stevie s. Stevie, for the first 
      time in his life, has been hit by the lightning bolt.

      Ella finishes the gorgeous ballad. The Beauty applauds. 
      Stevie follows suit. Ella squints towards the bar and 
      curtsies to the applause.

                                  ELLA
                    That work for you, doll?

                                  BEAUTY
                    Not bad, Miss Ella. For a first 
                    pass.

      Ella laughs, waves her off, turns to her pianist, huddling 
      over his notes.

      Stevie spins on his stool to face the beauty. 

                                  STEVIE
                    I m Stevie. Stevie Evans.

                                  BEAUTY
                          (after a beat)
                    Lily.

      Lily takes a drag off her cigarette, exhales.

                                  LILY
                    So, what s a rich white boy doing 
                    in Overtown on New Years Eve day?

                                  STEVIE
                    Waiting for the ball to drop.

                                  LILY
                    And has it?

      Stevie can only stare at her. She holds his gaze. He gulps. 
      She slowly leans towards him.

                                  LILY (CONT D)
                    Four, three, two, one.                                                                                    25.


      Lily kisses him deeply on the mouth.

                                  LILY (CONT D)
                          (whispering against his 
                            lips)
                    Happy new year.

      Lily sweeps from the club, disappearing up the stairs. Stevie 
      stays frozen, suddenly snaps to and chases after her.


      Stevie bounds right into Grady and a half a dozen hulking 
      BOXERS.

                                  STEVIE
                          (looking around for Lily)
                    You see a really, really pretty 
                    white girl come through here?

                                  GRADY
                    Not since Elizabeth Taylor was 
                    doggin  Nat King Cole.

      The guys crack up. Grady throws an arm around Stevie.

                                  GRADY (CONT D)
                    Forget the girl, Junior. You just 
                    tell us where and when. The cavalry 
                    has arrived!

      Stevie smiles at the good news, craning around for a glimpse 
      of Lily.


      Ike stands at the picture window staring down at the madness. 
      LAUREN, Ike and Vera s 12 year old daughter, rushes up from 
      behind, grabbing Ike s arm.

                                  LAUREN
                    Daddy. I want Frankie Avalon!

                                  IKE
                    Hey, who doesn t?

      Lauren yanks Ike around to face her.

                                  LAUREN
                    Jodi Segal had Frankie Avalon for 
                    her Bat Mitzvah!

      Vera comes to the window, glances down at the strikers.

                                  VERA
                    Lauren honey, let s leave Daddy 
                    alone. He s thinking.

                                  LAUREN
                    Forget it! Just forget the whole 
                    thing! I hate you!! I don t even 
                    want a damn Bat Mitzvah!

      Lauren runs in tears from the room.

                                  IKE
                    What did you just say?!
                          (to Vera)
                    She just curse?
                          (screaming after Lauren)
                    You ll be lucky if you get Pupi 
                    Campo, you brat!

                                  VERA
                    Come on honey. She s just anxious.

                                  IKE
                    She s anxious?

                                  VERA
                    They pick up on our stress.

      Ike returns his gaze down to the angry mob blocking his 
      hotel. Vera hugs him from behind. She rests her cheek against 
      his.

                                  VERA (CONT D)
                    We re gonna be okay.                                                                                    27.


                                  IKE
                    You might have to go back to the 
                    Aqua Follies.

      Vera smiles.

                                  VERA
                    Anything to get me back into that 
                    bikini... Ike. Listen. Maybe it s 
                    time, maybe Ben could--

                                  IKE
                          (turns to face Vera)
                    Doris is dead. 

                                  VERA
                    What?! When? What happened?!

                                  IKE
                    I ve heard things for years. Crazy 
                    stories. Rumors. Guys talk.

                                  VERA
                    Ike?

      Ike pauses, deciding how or even whether to continue. 
      Finally...

      FLASHBACK BEGINS:


      DORIS DIAMOND, Ben s blonde, beautiful wife, thrashes, tied 
      by restraints to her bed. Her white sheets are blood-
      splattered.

                                  IKE (V.O.)
                    Killed his wife.

      A DOCTOR and NURSE hover over Doris. BEN DIAMOND, a deeply-
      tanned, tight little mob boss, stands in the doorway calmly 
      sipping his Cutty Sark.                                                                                     28.


                                  IKE (V.O.)
                    ...They get pregnant, these girls. 
                    Ben gets them pregnant, and he 
                    forces them to have abortions... 
                    And then... he watches. 

      DORIS arches her back in pain, wailing. Her hands clench into 
      white fists.

      BEN S eyes shine as he watches his wife s agony.

                                  IKE  (V.O.)
                    He stays in the bedroom and watches 
                    the Doctor operate on them. Ben 
                    likes to see the girls hurt. He 
                    gets off on it. 

      PUSH IN - BEN

      sucks on an ice cube from his drink, riveted by the horrible 
      tableaux.

                                  IKE (V.O.)
                    Sometimes they die there.

      END OF FLASHBACK


      Vera stands, hands to her mouth. Ike takes her in his arms.

                                  VERA
                    My God.

                                  IKE 
                    I ll get us through this. I will. I 
                    always have, right? Hey, six years 
                    ago this was all just sand and 
                      mosquitoes. Now it s the Miramar. I 
                    did that. You believe in me, Vee?

      Vera nods. Ike hugs her tight.

                                  VERA
                    Til the end.

                                  IKE
                    We ll survive. But we stay away 
                    from Ben Diamond.

      Ike kisses his wife, looks her in the eye.

                                  IKE (CONT D)
                    You okay?                                                                                    29.


      Vera nods, looks away.

                                  IKE (CONT D)
                    What? Honey. I promise,

      Ike grabs his blazer.

                                  IKE
                    You got Georgie Jessel.

                    Asshole.                                                                                    31.


                                  IKE
                    Beauty.
                          (kissing the tip of her 
                            nose)
                    I love you.

      Ike heads for the door.  Fluffy  blocks the door, snarling up 
      at him with bared teeth.

                                  VERA
                    She s acting so weird. Hiding under 
                    the bed. Won t come when I call 
                    her.

                                  IKE
                    They pick up on our stress.

      Ike carefully steps over the dog and exits. Vera walks over 
      to the window, gazing down at the street-chaos below. She 
      sighs.


      Ike stands in his stockinged feet staring down at a large 
      seating chart spread across his office carpet. His secretary, 
      FAYE, kneels over the chart, magic marker in hand.

                                  FAYE
                    You can t have the McGuire sisters 
                    sitting all together.

                                  IKE
                    Fine. Split  em up. Here. Put 
                    Phyllis between Danny Kaye and Jack 
                    Carter.

      Florence, the front office clerk walks in and hands Ike a 
      note. Ike reads it.

                                  IKE (CONT D)
                    Lose Jack Kennedy and the Lawfords.

                                  FAYE
                    Why? They ll love sitting with Kim 
                    Novack.

                                  IKE
                    And lose Kim Novack too.

                                  FAYE 
                    What? That s a great table--

                                  IKE
                    They cancelled. We re bleeding 
                    here. The strike s on all the news. 
                    They re killing me.

      A knock at the door. Ike looks up to see big JILLY RIZZO, 
      Frank Sinatra s right hand man, looming in the doorway. Ike 
      slips on his loafers and hustles over.

                                  IKE (CONT D)
                    Jilly! How s everything going 
                    upstairs. Frank s suite okay?                                                                                     36.

                    This town during the season.

                    It was those goddamned pickets 
                    outside. Goin  at it all night

                                  IKE
                    That, I m sorry, I m taking care of 
                    that. No problem. That ll be gone.

      Jilly steps over to the seating chart.

                                  JILLY
                    Here s the drill. Onstage? No 
                    flowers, no perfume, a Jack and 
                    water on the piano. Shecky does a 
                    tight fifteen to open and not a 
                    second more. Stick all the blondes 
                    up front and keep the air on high. 
                    He likes it cold.

                                  IKE
                    Done.

                    Spaghetti marinara no meat. Like 
                    six o clock. I ll have somebody 
                    drop off our list in an hour.

      Jilly looks up from the seating chart to Ike.

                                  JILLY (CONT D)
                    We okay tonight?

                                  IKE
                    Okay? We are magic. Pure--

                                  JILLY
                    He sees any empties, one empty 
                    seat, he walks . Square business, 
                    Ike. The man is gone. And you are 
                    done.                                                                                    37.


                                  IKE
                    Empties? I just turned away Gene 
                    Barry and Tony Quinn. No room. Tell 
                    him we are SRO.

                                  JILLY
                    That I will.

      Jilly leaves. Ike takes a deep breath. He throws on his 
      blazer and heads out the door.

                                  IKE
                    I ll be back in an hour.

      Faye looks down at the half-empty seating chart.


      Stevie steps into a harem of a dozen SOUTHERN BEAUTIES in 
      various stages of undress -- a hooker locker room. Perfume 
      and hairspray hangs in the air. Girls preen in front of make-
      up mirrors, slip on silk stockings, lounge on the chaise, 
      slow dance with each other to the Everlys.

                                  STEVIE
                    Ladies. Welcome to the Miramar.

                                  GIRLS 
                          (wild lines)
                    Hey lover... Mister Man... Thank 
                    y all...

                                  STEVIE
                    You ready to meet the richest, best 
                    looking and most famous guys in the 
                    world?! You ready for millionaires 
                    and movie stars?! 

      The girls scream.

                                  STEVIE (CONT D)
                    You ladies are beauty. You are sex. 
                    You are every man s dream. You are 
                    the Miramar Hotel s gift to 1959! 
                    Make me proud, girls. Make me rich!

      The girls scream as Stevie exits.


      No music. No conversation. The click of cards and chips. 
      Muttered poker commands and curses. Thick cigarette smoke 
      clouds the cabana. A shaded overhead light shines down on the 
      green felt poker table. A FEW PLAYERS focus on their cards 
      mid-game. A cash pot pyramids in the middle. The players 
      barely glance up at Stevie from their hands. Mel Jaffee 
      strolls over.                                                                                    39.

                    Kid.

                                  STEVIE
                    You got everything?

                                  MEL 
                      Everything but players. Your Pop 
                    handle that tsuris out front?

                                  STEVIE
                    He s workin  on it.

                                  MEL
                    Better work harder. And faster. 
                    This? Right here? Not good.

                                  STEVIE
                    He ll get it done.

      Stevie leaves with Cuda.


      A blousy, aging pro, MYRNNA, sits on a bar stool nursing a 
      kir royale. Stevie and  Cuda   enter, walking to the far end 
      of the bar.

                                  STEVIE
                    ...How  bout weed?

                                  CUDA
                    Raul and Heppy brought in a few 
                    lids. I can get more. 

                                  STEVIE
                    The Cops cool?

                                  CUDA
                      Everybody s paid or afraid. I hired 
                    the usual off-duty motor cycle guys 
                    for show. You still expectin  a 
                    crowd? Even with the crazies out 
                    there?

                                  STEVIE
                    Ike says we re good. We re good.

      A Joey Heatherton-sexy, platinum blonde, JUDI SILVER, sighs 
      into the bar. Myrnna looks over with a sneer.

                                  MYRNNA
                    Look what the cash dragged in.

                                  JUDI
                    Granny.

                                  STEVIE
                    Judi. Babe.

                                  MYRNNA
                          (imitating)
                     Judi. Babe. 

                                  STEVIE
                          (walking to Judi)
                    I don t care what you pay Cuda for 
                    that stool, Myrnna. Behave or your 
                    workin  at Fun Fair.                                                                                    48.


      Myrnna grumbles into her kir.

      Stevie greets the ice-beautiful Judi with a long embrace.

                                  STEVIE (CONT D)
                          (admiring her)
                    Miss Silver, you kill me.

                                  JUDI
                    Prove it lover.

                                  STEVIE
                     Never ride the working stock , Ike 
                    Evans. Cuda get Miss Silver a very 
                    dry, very cold gin martini with two 
                    pearl onions.

                                  JUDI
                    He remembers.

      Stevie helps Judi onto a bar stool, sits beside her. He leans 
      close, nearly whispering to her.

                                  STEVIE
                    I ll need you for the night.

                                  JUDI
                    I ve been waiting my whole life to 
                    hear that from you.

      Cuda slides the frosty drink to Judi. She takes a sip.

                                  JUDI (CONT D)
                    Hi, ho Silver and away!

      Stevie laughs, leans over and kisses her cheek. He palms a 
      roll of twenties into Judi s hand.


      Ike s father Arthur lies propped up in bed. Inez, the 
      bombshell nurse, sits at the foot of the bed facing him. The 
      Dorsey Brothers   Cheek To Cheek  plays on the victrola. A 
      few shafts of light slice through the drawn Venetian blinds. 

                                  ARTHUR
                    Go. Go on.

      Inez starts unbuttoning her top. Arthur watches her. She 
      begins to take off her uniform blouse.

                                  ARTHUR (CONT D)
                    Slower.                                                                                    49.


      Inez slowly peels off her blouse, sits in her white bra. 
      Arthur nods, watching her.

                                  INEZ
                    Now?

                                  ARTHUR
                    Now.

      FROM BEHIND - INEZ

      reaches back and unsnaps her bra. She takes the bra off, 
      setting it atop Arthur s head. Arthur gazes at her as if 
      looking at a holy shrine. He slowly reaches both hands 
      towards her breasts. She leans closer. He reaches forward, 
      coughs once, grabs his chest and pitches onto the floor with 
      a thunk. Inez leaps from the bed, topless.

                                  INEZ
                    Mr. Arthur!!!


      Ike steps out of the elevator and sees Inez in the waiting 
      room. She jumps up, tear-stained, to greet him

                                  INEZ
                    I m so sorry. I didn t know what to 
                    do. I m not a nurse. Ju know, I 
                    just wear the outfit. I n a 
                    waitress down at Sebastien s. Your 
                    father make me wear this--

                                  IKE
                    Inez. It s okay. It s fine. How is 
                    he?

                                  INEZ
                          (wiping her eyes)
                    He have a heart attack. But the 
                    Doctor say, he no die. I n so 
                    sorry!

                                  IKE
                    Pull yourself together. I ll be 
                    right back.


      Arthur lies in bed. A Nurse takes his vital signs.                                                                                    50.


                                  IKE
                    Pop?

      Arthur turns.

                                  ARTHUR
                          (to Nurse)
                    My son. Honey, see this handsome 
                    fella? That s my boy.

                                  NURSE
                    He s got to rest. I ll give you two 
                    a couple of minutes.

                                  IKE
                    He s gonna be okay, right?

                                  ARTHUR
                    If they stop poking me like a 
                    turkey.

                                  NURSE
                    He s going to be just fine.

      She leaves. Ike steps closer to his father.

                                  IKE
                    What the hell, Pop.

                                  ARTHUR
                    You see my hat? My skipper hat?

      Ike looks around and finds the soiled hat atop a chair of 
      folded clothes. Ike picks it up.

                                  ARTHUR (CONT D)
                    Put it on me.

      Ike sets it atop the old man s head. Arthur reaches up and 
      straightens it.

                                  ARTHUR (CONT D)
                    Covers my bald spot.

                                  IKE
                    How re ya feeling?

                                  ARTHUR
                    Other than I m a hundred years old 
                    and have a goddamn heart attack 
                    when I see a naked girl? I m great.
                          (eyeing Ike)
                    Better than you.                                                                                    51.


                                  IKE
                    I m fine.

      Ike sits down in a chair, pulls it closer to his father s 
      bed. The old man reaches out. Ike takes his hand.

                                  ARTHUR
                    I miss your mother.

                                  IKE
                    I know. Me too Pop.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Fifty two years. I never went to 
                    bed without telling her I loved 
                    her. So. Another new year alone.
                          (wiping a tear away from 
                          his eye)
                    Ah. What the hell. This too shall 
                    pass. Huh?

                                  IKE
                    That s what you always say.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Yeah but what do I know?... I know 
                    I m proud of you kid. Look what you 
                    did. What you built. The biggest. 
                    The best. Fontainbleau? Eden Roc? 
                    Pishers.

                                  IKE
                    Pop.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Hey. I m not embarrassed. I did 
                    okay. I had a good thing. Sundries. 
                    A little sports book. But small 
                    potatoes. You, you son of a bitch, 
                    you dreamed big.

      Ike averts his eyes, looks down.

                                  ARTHUR (CONT D)
                    Listen to me, Isaac. Okay? They re 
                    inside already. Don t deny it. I 
                    know what I know. They re a cancer. 
                    Very hard to cut them out. The 
                    surgery could kill you. You got one 
                    chance. Stay strong. Stay healthy. 
                    Stay alive. You can live with the 
                    cancer. Cost you a few bucks. A few 
                    sleepless nights. Your pride. But 
                    you stick around. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    52.

                                  ARTHUR (CONT D)
                    You hang in there. You survive. And 
                    then. Then who knows? 

      Arthur pats Ike s hand, smiles.

                                  ARTHUR (CONT D)
                    It s a long ball game. My money s 
                    on you kid.

      Ike stands.

                                  IKE
                    I gotta go, Pop. I ll come by first 
                    thing tomorrow.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Go. Go. I m fine.

      Ike leans over and kisses his father s forehead.

                                  IKE
                    I love you Pop.

                                  ARTHUR
                    I love you too, Isaac.

      Ike walks to the door.

                                  ARTHUR (CONT D)
                    Ike. Send Inez in.

                                  IKE
                    You sure?

                                  ARTHUR
                    Hey, you only live once.

                                  IKE
                    And sometimes not even then.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Ha! I like that!

                                  IKE
                    See you tomorrow.

      Ike leaves his father.


      Stevie stands behind the bar. The pool window glows blue 
      behind him. Danny sits at the bar facing Stevie. Danny 
      inhales a Cuban sandwich. Stevie slides a coke in front of 
      him.                                                                                    53.


                                  STEVIE
                    ...Well I m not gonna ask Victor 
                    for you. She s your date. Be a man. 
                    What s the worst he can do?

                                  DANNY
                    Say no and punch me in the face. 
                    She s his little girl. He s crazy 
                    about her.

      Lily suddenly swims down to the window behind Stevie. Danny 
      sees her. She hangs there, waving her arms to keep herself 
      suspended in the window. Danny blinks at the mermaid.

                                  STEVIE 
                    What?

      Lily hangs underwater, fluttering her beautiful legs. She 
      points to Stevie s back, blows him a kiss.

      Stevie turns around. Lily hovers in the window, smiles, leans 
      close and kisses the glass. 

                                  STEVIE (CONT D)
                          (shouting to her)
                    Wait! Stay!
                          (to Danny)
                    I ll... Handle... I ll be--

      Stevie bolts from the bar.


      Stevie and Lily lay entwined, asleep in the dark cabana. A 
      Miramar beach towel covers their nude bodies.

      BANG! BANG! Lily bolts up terrified.

                                  STEVIE
                    What?

                                  DANNY (OS)
                    Cadillac called. He s up in 
                      Lauderdale waiting for you.

      Lily throws on clothes from her bag.                                                                                    55.


                                  STEVIE
                    Jesus. Ok. Call him. Be there in 
                      twenty-five.

      Danny s silhouette peers through the slats. Stevie bangs it 
      with his fist.

                                  DANNY (O.S.)
                    Ow!

                                  STEVIE
                    Beat it.

      Stevie stands, tries to hold Lily as she hurriedly dresses.

                                  STEVIE (CONT D)
                    Can I see you again?

                                  LILY
                          (buttoning her blouse)
                    Yes. No. I don t know.

                                  STEVIE
                    Where do you live? I don t even 
                    know your last--

                                  LILY
                          (kissing him quiet)
                    Shut up. You know enough.

      She slips out the cabana door and is gone. Stevie touches his 
      finger to where Lily kissed his lip.


      Ike ties and re-ties his bow-tie. Vera glides over in her 
      skin-tight gown and presents her back to be zipped.

                                  VERA
                    But they say he s gonna be okay?

                                  IKE
                          (zipping her)
                    This won t kill Arthur. He just has 
                    to change a few things. His diet. 
                    His nurse.

                                  VERA
                          (heading back to her 
                            bathroom)
                    That should be interesting.

      Ike follows her in, staring at her in the lit mirror.                                                                                    56.


                                  IKE
                    Big Red, you are something.

      Vera smiles.

                                  VERA
                    You know I hate that name.

      Ike leans over and kisses her neck.

      Lauren runs in.

                                  LAUREN
                    Ugh. Can somebody get Fluffy off my 
                    sweater she s getting it all--

                                  IKE
                    Fluffy?

                                  LAUREN
                    I m not kidding! She keeps growling 
                    at me.

                                  VERA
                          (ushering her out)
                    She s really acting weird, honey.

                                  IKE
                          (calling after them)
                    Lauren. If you re gonna wear skirts 
                    that short, you d better start 
                    shaving those legs!

                                  LAUREN (O.S.)
                    Dad!!!

      Ike smiles and steps outside, onto the balcony. He fires up a 
      Cohiba, gazing out at the grey ocean. Storm clouds gather 
      over the Gulfstream. Ike s smile fades.


      Ike, handsome in his tux, stands in the back of the jammed, 
      festive, elegant ballroom simply enjoying the moment. Success 
      snatched from the jaws... this time. 

                                  BEN (O.S.)
                    Big night.

      Ike turns to the sleek, nut-brown mob boss.

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    Don t mention it.

      Ben pats Ike s arm.

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    Enjoy.

      Ben and his entourage (Dandy Phil, other THUGS and their 
      BROADS file past into the ballroom.

                                  IKE
                    Where s Lily?

                                  BEN
                          (shrugs)
                    Powderin  her nose.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Stevie and Lily bang like crazy.


      Ike moves through the glamorous crowd, shaking hands, kissing 
      dames til he reaches his owner s booth. Vera, Lauren, Danny 
      and his lovely date, Mercedes, sit around the silk brocade 
      banquette.

                                  DANNY
                    Dad, you know Mercedes.                                                                                    59.


                                  IKE
                    Of course. You look beautiful 
                    honey.

                                  MERCEDES
                    Thank you.

                                  IKE
                          (nodding to Danny)
                    So what re you doin  with this 
                    yutz?

      Ike yanks Danny close, kissing his head. Danny pulls away, 
      smiling and blushing.

      Ike sits beside Vera on the outside banquette seat, throwing 
      his arm around her.

                                  IKE (CONT D)
                    Where s Stevie?

                                  VERA
                    He ll be here.

      Ike turns to the STAGE MANAGER and nods. The house lights 
      dim.

                                  VERA (CONT D)
                          (kisses his cheek)
                    Relax. You did it.

      the stage. The room goes insane.

                                    SINATRA
                          (singing)
                     I ve got the world on a string, 
                    sitting on a rainbow....                           

      SINATRA S SONG PLAYS OVER SCENES:                                                                                    60.


      Lily joins Ben s table of killers. Ben stands as she slides 
      into the banquette. 


                                    SINATRA (CONT D)
                          (singing)
                     Got the string around my finger...
                     What a world, what a life
                     Oohh I m in love... 


      Ben sees beach-sand clinging to the hem of Lily s gown. He 
      leans forward and brushes it off. Lily glances back, sees the 
      sand fall. She looks up at Ben, who smiles warmly at her. 
      Lily takes her seat.

      STEVIE enters the rear of the dark ballroom. His eyes scour 
      the audience, finally landing on Lily and Ben. Lily sips her 
      champagne, laughs at a joke. Ben s arm stays clamped around 
      Lily s bare shoulder as he cranes around, searching for 
      someone. Stevie watches from the dark.

                                    SINATRA (CONT D)
                          (singing)
                     I ve got this song that I sing,       
                    I can make the rain go             
                    anytime I move my finger... 

      Stevie joins his family at the owner s booth. He hugs his 
      father, winks at Danny and Mercedes. 

      Stevie leans over and kisses a stunned Vera on the cheek.

      Vera beams, throws a surprised look at Ike who shrugs and 
      smiles. Stevie sits on Vera s other side, lifts his waiting 
      martini to his lips and enjoys Sinatra.


      Arthur sleeps, mouth open, in his bedroom. The TV plays Guy 
      Lombardo s New Year s Eve. THROUGH his open bedroom door WE 
      SEE Inez rifling through the drawers of Arthur s livingroom 
      desk.

                                    SINATRA
                          (singing)
                     Lucky me, can t you see - I m in 
                    love... 


      Mike Strauss sits between the two thugs in the back seat of 
      the car, his battered, pulpy face strobed by passing car 
      headlights.                                                                                    61.


                         SINATRA
                          (singing)
                     Life is a beautiful thing... 

      The car fades down the dark and lonely two-lane.

                                    SINATRA 
                          (singing)
                     As long as I hold the string... 


      Ike lies beside Vera. Vera wears her sleep-mask.

                                    SINATRA 
                             (singing)  
                     I d be a silly so and so             
                    If I should ever let it go.... 

      [Sinatra s singing fades.]

      Ike stares at the ceiling. Vera lifts her sleep-mask and 
      kisses Ike on the lips.

                                  IKE
                    What s that for?

                                  VERA
                    Thanks.

                                  IKE
                    For what?

      Vera slides down her sleep-mask and rolls over.

                                  VERA 
                    Fluffy had pink toe-nails.

      Ike gulps.

                                  VERA (CONT D)
                    We get rid of that monster in the 
                    morning.

      Vera rolls over to sleep. Ike sighs, eyes wide open.


      Stevie stands behind the closed bar, bathed in the underwater 
      blues. Ike walks in.

                                  STEVIE
                    What re you doin  up?                                                                                    62.


                                  IKE
                    Couldn t sleep.

      Ike slips onto the bar stool. Stevie pours two brandies.

                                  STEVIE
                    Me neither.

      Stevie lifts his brandy in a toast.

                                  STEVIE (CONT D)
                    We made it.

                                  IKE
                    We certainly did.

      They drink. Ike looks at his oldest son, reaches over and 
      tenderly rests his palm against Stevie s cheek.

                                  IKE (CONT D)
                    Your father loves you.

      Stevie smiles and takes another sip of brandy. Ike s gaze 
      drifts to the lapis swimming pool.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

      Underwater. Shifting shades of blue. Move through an 
      underwater forest of swaying bodies to MIKE STRAUSS -- dead, 
      wide-eyed -- floating above a big-finned Caddy.

      IKE 

      tosses back his brandy and stands.

                                  IKE (CONT D)
                    Happy New Year.

      Ike strides from the lounge and into 1959 in the magic city.

                        



                             THE END
