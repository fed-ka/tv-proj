      Elements of man's presence give way to a lush rainforest. 
      The spirit crow waits on a tree branch for Draven before
      taking off again.  Draven plunges ahead until he emerges
      from the dense canopy.  Draven is floored by what he sees:

                                      DRAVEN
                    Shelly?



      She's Draven's girlfriend, a beautiful woman in her early
      twenties.  She's standing about half-way across a suspension
      bridge, spanning a gorge, high above turbulent waters.  

      As Draven runs toward her, past the spirit crow, the bridge
      sways under his weight.

                                      DRAVEN
                    Shelly?

      Draven arrives, and the two look at each other, almost afraid
      to believe.  They pull each other into a crushing embrace.

                                      DRAVEN (CONT'D)
                    It's you.  It's really you.

                                      SHELLY
                    Yes, yes.  I've been waiting.  It
                    seems like forever.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                   2.

                                      DRAVEN
                    I can't remember anything.  It's
                    like I just woke up here.

                                      SHELLY
                    Time isn't the same here.

                                      DRAVEN
                    Where are we?  Everything looks
                    familiar but I don't recognize
                    anything.

                                      SHELLY
                    It's a Land of the Dead.  It has to
                    be.

                                      DRAVEN
                    I thought it was a nightmare.  It
                    really happened, didn't it?

      Shelly nods.  Draven is overwhelmed by his guilt, holds her
      out at arm's length so he can look at her.

                                      DRAVEN (CONT'D)
                    God, Shelly, I am so sorry...

                                      SHELLY
                    We're together.  That's all that
                    matters.

      The spirit crow appears before Draven and Shelly, perching
      on the handrail.  Draven nods in its direction.

                                      DRAVEN
                    He led me to you.

                                      SHELLY
                    A crow?

      Shelly's face falls.  Draven reads her worry.

                                      DRAVEN
                    Why?  What's it mean?

                                      SHELLY
                    It's a legend.  Something about a
                    second chance.

      While reaching out to Draven, Shelly is seemingly drawn
      farther away, as if pulled by some kind of supernatural force. 
      From Shelly's POV, however, it is Draven who's distant.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                   3.

                                      SHELLY (CONT'D)
                    Set things right, Eric.  I'll wait
                    for you...

      But Shelly is gone.  Draven lets out a PLAINTIVE WAIL as the
      CAMERA PULLS OUT revealing, ultimately, the immensity of
      where Draven is, and what a small piece of it he is.  Alone. 
      So very alone. 

      Back close, the spirit crow simply cocks its head to the
      side, then takes off in soaring flight, diving from the
      bridge.  Draven, in terrible pain and confusion, watches.


      DRAVEN'S POV - THE CROW

      Plummeting toward the rushing waters below.  Disappearing in
      a COSMIC RIPPLE, leaving nothing but rocks and water, two
      hundred feet down.


      RESUME BRIDGE BETWEEN THE WORLDS

      Stunned, Draven hops up onto the thick steel cable from which
      the bridge is suspended, balancing on it like a tight rope. 
      Arms extended for balance, feet together, looking very much
      like a crow himself, he stares down, trying to fathom what
      he has seen.  Everything, it seems, disappears into nothing. 
      Beyond comprehension, he closes his eyes, balancing, until...


      DRAVEN DIVES OFF THE BRIDGE!

      Free-falling, arms outstretched like a bird in flight. 
      Draven, too, disappears into the COSMIC RIPPLE rather than
      crash into the water below. 



      A girl, SARAH MOHR, a young 14, the picture of thrift store
      cast-off street-chic and all attitude, grinds through the
      pavement on her skateboard.  Finally, she flips the board
      up, and begins to walk across the grass, stopping at two
      headstones.  Based on their inscriptions, they belong to Eric
      Draven and Shelly Webster.  She pulls off a weathered back-
      pack, pulls a small bouquet of flowers from it.

                                      SARAH
                    Big Mikey paid for them, but I picked
                    'em.

      Sarah places the flowers at the foot of the graves. 

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Happy anniversary...  I guess...

      Sarah stands there in silent contemplation.  Finally, she
      puts to words her thoughts.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    I hate the people that did this to
                    you.  I hate them so much I hate
                    even thinking about hating them.
                          (self-aware)
                    And what I really hate is I'm talking
                    to a couple of stupid graves.

                                      ALBRECHT (O.S.)
                    If only they'd talk back, huh?

      It's DETECTIVE DARYL ALBRECHT, an African-American cop.

                                      SARAH
                          (angry)
                    Hey, Daryl, quit following me, okay?

                                      ALBRECHT
                    You're supposed to be in school.

                                      SARAH
                    There's no classes today.  It's a
                    national holiday.

                                      ALBRECHT
                      Halloween?  Maybe when you get to be
                    Mayor.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                   6.

                                      SARAH
                    Got that right.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    C'mon.  I'll give you a ride.

                                      SARAH
                          (shakes head)
                    I want to stay here and feel sorry
                    for myself, okay?

                                      ALBRECHT
                    No, Sarah.  It's not okay.

                                      SARAH
                    Look.  These were my friends, not
                    yours. 

      Albrecht nods his agreement.  Still, he's made a commitment
      to himself to care about this kid.  He awkwardly pats the
      top of Draven's headstone.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    You get five minutes.  I'll wait in
                    the car.

      Albrecht turns and leaves. 



      Draven is on the move now, in an urban environment.  He hears
      the sound of DISTANT THUNDER.  Taken away from his thoughts
      by the sounds of a domestic quarrel in progress.

      A sports utility vehicle has stopped at an intersection. 
      The driver, MITCH, has the passenger window down and is
      screaming toward the street.

                                      MITCH
                    Get in the car!

      But the young woman on the street keeps walking.  This is
      CYNTHIA and she's scared, her eyes still wet from crying.

                                      CYNTHIA
                    Just leave me alone.

      Mitch jumps out of the car and moves to confront her.

                                      MITCH
                    This is the last time I'm gonna say
                    this.  Get in the damn car!      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                   7.

      Mitch grabs Cynthia by the arm and begins to pull her toward
      the vehicle.  She struggles but is no match for his strength.


      DRAVEN'S POV - CYNTHIA / SHELLY

      As the altercation continues, Draven -- in quick FLASHCUTS
      alternating between seeing Cynthia as herself and as Shelly
      struggling against Mitch.


      BACK TO SCENE

      Draven -- still amnesic -- is unable to process the meaning
      of this profoundly disturbing sequence, yet still feeling
      the anger and rage welling up inside him.  It is at that
      exact moment that Mitch, in a masterstroke of bad timing,
      sees Draven looking at him and decides to look for a
      scapegoat.

                                      MITCH
                    What are you lookin' at?

                                      DRAVEN
                    You.  She's afraid of you.

      Mitch pushes Cynthia away, turns his attention on Draven,
      grabbing him and throwing him against a nearby vehicle.  He
      closes, pushing Draven hard in the chest.

                                      MITCH
                    You're the one who oughta be afraid.

      Draven starts to look down but then just racks the guy in a
      quick succession of blows, battering him to the ground,
      surprising himself by his aggressive fearlessness. 

                                      DRAVEN
                    Not anymore.
                          (to Cynthia)
                    He doesn't love you... 

      Mitch has gotten to his feet.  He reaches through the window
      of his SUV and pulls out the anti-theft "Club" and raises it
      behind Draven.  He pounds him on the back, dropping Draven
      to his knees.  Cynthia shrieks:

                                      CYNTHIA
                    You're going to kill him!

      Draven, however, has the hint of a smile as he rises from
      his knees and turns to face Mitch.  Mitch takes another swing,
      but Draven catches the club in mid-swing.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                   8.

                                      MITCH
                    Who are you, man?

      Draven considers this.  He's not sure.  Then:

                                      DRAVEN
                    I'm nobody.  Just like you.

      Draven pitches Mitch backward, spins and kicks him on the
      way down.  During the brief fight, Cynthia jumps in the SUV
      and takes off down the street.  Draven watches then turns
      back to Mitch who scrambles away from Draven, scared for his
      life, running in the opposite direction.

      Again, the spirit crow flutters past camera.  A beat of
      hesitation, then Draven follows, eyeing a bead on it, his
      only link to what's happening.



      Albrecht drives his unmarked car, Sarah looks out the window.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    So how's your mom?

                                      SARAH
                    Darla's sleeping in late, as usual.
                          (dry)
                    Up all night baking cookies.

      Albrecht sees something on the street, pulls the car sharply
      to the side.  Sarah reaches reflexively for the door handle.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    No.  You stay.

                                      SARAH
                    I'm not your dog. 

      Albrecht ignores this as he pulls over to cut off TIN-TIN
      who, literally in mid-step, spins around and begins walking
      in the other direction.  Albrecht jumps out and intercepts
      Tin-Tin.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Hey, Tin-Tin.  Tell me all about
                    your Halloween plans. 
                          (pointedly)
                    Since last year was so much fun.

                                      TIN-TIN
                    I don't have to say nothin' to you.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                   9.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    You got lots to say.  You're a smart
                    guy --

                                      TIN-TIN
                    -- I'm not smart at all.  Ask anybody.

      Albrecht grabs Tin-Tin by the shoulder.  Spins him to the
      car, pats him down for a weapon.

                                      TIN-TIN (CONT'D)
                    I'm not carryin'.

      Albrecht indicates a mean chain, wrapped around his mid-
      section.

                                      TIN-TIN (CONT'D)
                    That's fashion, man.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    And I'm Tommy-damn-Hilfiger.  Now,
                    about the reason you're not carrying --
                    that new B-and-E you're up on. 

                                      TIN-TIN
                    What about it?

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Three strikes, that's what.  Give up
                    the others, we'll cut a deal with
                    the DA.

                                      TIN-TIN
                    I got a public defender says not to
                    talk to you.

                    Those two kids -- Webster and Draven --
                    did not deserve to die.  I got you
                    casing the same building twenty-four
                    hours earlier. 

                                      TIN-TIN
                    You had that a year ago.  I'm walkin',
                    man.  You got no right to harass me. 
                    I'm walkin'...

      Tin-Tin pulls free of Albrecht's grip.  Albrecht, knowing
      he's got nothing to hold him with, has to let him go but
      still gets in his parting shot.       THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 10.

                    Okay, you think about it, Tin, because
                    when I nail this -- and I will --
                    you'll want to be helping the good
                    guys...

      From Albrecht's look, he may not believe his own threat.



      Where Draven moves through the landscape, alone among a throng
      of strangers.  Draven stops as the spirit crow lands in front
      of a store.  "Gideon's Pawn Shop."  He looks in the window. 
      Among the items on display: an electric guitar.  The store
      owner, a pear-shaped man with food on his shirt, GIDEON,
      observes.

                                      GIDEON
                    You can't afford that one.  Got
                    another one inside though...

      Draven shakes his head, not interested.  The spirit crow
      takes off, destination across the street, down the block, an
      abandoned building, just another piece of urban decay.



      The spirit crow lands on the window sill of the huge circular
      window.  Looks in.  As this happens:


      CROWVISION - INSIDE THE LOFT

      Showing us a view of an abandoned loft, through the
      distortion. 



      Reacts to the vision, matched in his own view to a high shard
      of broken glass which becomes:



      Featuring the loft's distinctive circular window.  In its
      life, it was downscale.  Now it only remembers death -- two
      of them -- from a year ago.



      The Crow is seen moving through a building above the alley
      we saw Funboy hurrying down earlier in Crowvision.



      Tin-Tin stands behind a burning trash can, which keeps him
      warm while throwing a flickering light against the bricks. 
      A beat, then Funboy rounds the corner, races up.

                                      TIN-TIN
                    You take care of it?

      Funboy gasps for breath after running the whole way.  Tin-
      Tin inspects Funboy's fingernail scarred face.

                                      TIN-TIN (CONT'D)
                    What happened to you?

                                      FUNBOY
                    Gideon's right about this guy... 
                    He's... I don't know... he's just
                    weird, man.  Scary weird... called
                    himself a crow or something.

                                      TIN-TIN
                    Oooh, poor-baby-Funboy, got himself
                    scared by a widdle-birdie!

                                      FUNBOY
                    Where's Tin-Tin?

      Tin-Tin indicates the shadows where T-Bird waits in ambush. 
      Frowns to Funboy.


      THE CROW

      On top of the building above them, looks down on this scene. 
      There is an inner rage building inside this man.  He dive-
      bombs from the window into the alley below.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 26.

      Coming up from a tuck-and-roll, he kicks over a burning
      garbage barrel, sending embers flying.


      THE ALLEY

      Funboy points to the end of the alley where the Crow has
      fallen.

                                      FUNBOY
                    It's him, man!

      Tin-Tin starts toward the area.  Funboy tries to hold him
      back.

                                      FUNBOY (CONT'D)
                    Be careful, what you gonna do?

                                      TIN-TIN
                    We're gonna take out the trash, that's
                    what.  Get some huevos.  You're making
                    me wanna hurl.


      THE CROW MOVES TOWARD THEM!

      Reflected menacingly in the throw-glow of another barrel
      fire.

                                    THE CROW
                    The tides of sin draw tighter and
                      brighter... The hours become heavier
                    and weighted... And the shadows smile,
                    dark and wild.

      The Crow smiles at Tin-Tin and Funboy.

                                      FUNBOY
                    I told you, man, he ain't normal.

      Tin-Tin holds up a hand.

                                      TIN-TIN
                    This bird-boy's mine.

      Tin-Tin advances toward the Crow, swinging his chain.

      The two face off, Tin-Tin swings and connects, lashing the
      Crow across the chest and face.  The Crow goes down, cut and
      hurt.

      Tin-Tin turns back to Funboy, looking for approval.  Instead,
      Funboy is already trying to get away.

      Suddenly, the Crow is in front of him.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 27.

      The gash on his face heals before our eyes.  The Crow throws
      him toward Tin-Tin, and he collapses against the wall.

      This time when Tin-Tin swings his chain, the Crow grabs the
      end of the chain link, and uses it to pull Tin-Tin toward
      him.  Up close, he hisses:

                                    THE CROW
                    One year ago, you killed two people. 
                    Tell me the story.

                                      TIN-TIN
                    Once upon a time, there was a freak. 
                    He died.  The end.

      Tin-Tin pushes away from the Crow.  As he does, he produces
      a long knife.

                                    THE CROW
                    Make the first one count.  One to a
                    customer.

      Tin-Tin lunges toward the Crow with the knife.  The Crow
      blocks the attack and, putting Tin-Tin's arm in his vice
      grip, snaps the bone.

                                      TIN-TIN
                    Ahh!!  Damn...

      The Crow throws Tin-Tin to the ground, then kicks him over.

                                    THE CROW
                    You killed a woman who never did
                    anything to you.  Why?

                                      TIN-TIN
                    We were bored.

      The Crow leans down to Tin-Tin, grabs him by the hair and
      the pants.

                                    THE CROW
                    'Time to beg for it, boy.'  Remember?


      FLASHCUT - DRAVEN IN THE LOFT

      The Crow remembers the moment when Tin-Tin helped throw him
      through the window.


      RETURN TO SCENE

      WE HEAR the SHIFT-CLICKS ON MULTIPLE WEAPONS as T-Bird and
      Funboy step out of the shadows.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 28.

      Tin-Tin scoots behind their protection, taking a weapon.

                                      T-BIRD
                    Say your prayers.

                                    THE CROW
                    What are you going to do?  Kill me?

      The crew begins to unload their weapons into the Crow's body. 
        A malevolent ambush of evil seen clearly in their faces. 
      Played off the Crow only long enough to establish that under
      this much firepower his re-animated body is not invulnerable. 
      He's going down and he's staying down.

      Even as they lay down another line of fire, T-Bird and his
      crew flee the scene of the shooting.


      NEARBY - ALBRECHT

      Albrecht creeps through the alley across the street in his
      car, headlights off.  He hears the firing, and keys his
      microphone.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    This is Unit KJ-62.  I have shots
                    fired.  Old Hoover shipyard.  Can't
                    get a good view from here.  Requesting
                    immediate back-up and an ambulance.


      THE CROW - WITH SHELLY'S SPIRIT

      WE SEE his bullet-riddled body, trying to crawl to his knees. 
      WE SEE Shelly, placing her arms around him, trying to soothe
      him in some kind of mystical healing of body and spirit.


      ALBRECHT'S POV - THE CROW

      The Crow is alone.  There is no Shelly.  At least, not in
      this reality.  It's very hard to make out anything. 
      Especially the Crow as he stumbles off into the darkness
      while Albrecht's RADIO SQUAWKS.

                                      RADIO (V.O.)
                    Roger KJ-62.  Stay put.  Another
                    unit's on the way.  Do not engage.



      Now a crime scene, complete with uniformed cops, detectives
      and Albrecht.  The senior man is Albrecht's boss, LIEUTENANT
      DAVID VINCENNES.  He's not an easy man to like, high standards
      and little patience.  Albrecht approaches.

                                      VINCENNES
                    What are we up to?

                                      ALBRECHT
                      Thirty-four shell casings.  We're
                    still looking. 

                                      VINCENNES
                    But no body?  No weapon?

      Albrecht holds Tin-Tin's chain, left behind.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Just this.  Belonged to Tin-Tin.

                                      VINCENNES
                          (weary)
                    Why don't any of these gangsters
                    have real names?

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Mark Tremaine, a.k.a. Tin-Tin.

      Albrecht's cell phone RINGS.  He mumbles an excuse to
      Vincennes, picks up.

                                      ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
                      Albrecht... You're sure?... No, her
                    mother's not going to be much help. 
                    I have an idea where to find her... 
                    Look, this isn't a great time.  I'll
                    have her there by third period...
                    Alright, bye.

      Albrecht hangs up.  Vincennes has a low tolerance for this
      kind of interruption.

                                      VINCENNES
                    Trouble at home?

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Got it handled.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 31.

                                      VINCENNES
                    Now, exactly what led you to believe
                    this was any more than target
                    practice? 

                                      ALBRECHT
                    I saw somebody move but I thought it
                    was one of the shooters. 
                          (bottom line)
                    I don't know. 

                                      VINCENNES
                    Let's not let this become one of
                    your epic open cases, okay?
                          (indicates scene)
                    Where's the blood?

      Albrecht produces a plastic baggy.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    We found about sixty grams of this. 
                    Some kind of ashes, like charcoal. 
                    Lab's running it.

                                      VINCENNES
                    Is this a barbeque or a homicide?

                                      ALBRECHT
                    I don't have a theory yet, Lieutenant.

                                      VINCENNES
                    Get one.

      Vincennes takes off.



      Sarah skateboards down the street.  A Thunderbird pulls up
      in front of her, blocking her path.  T-Bird rolls down the
      window.

                                      T-BIRD
                    Hey, kid.  I gotta talk to you.

      Sarah stops.  Stands there holding her skateboard, defiantly.

                                      SARAH
                    Yeah?  What do you want?

                                      T-BIRD
                    Just that you understand how we were
                    never at your place last night.  How
                    it'd be bad for your mom if you
                      remembered anything different.

      Sarah gets the drift of this threat.

                                      SARAH
                    You guys got a lot bigger problem
                    than me talking to the cops...

                                      T-BIRD
                    Yeah?  Like what?

                                      SARAH
                    Like the guy you thought you killed
                    last night?
                          (beat)
                    He's not dead.



      The Crow crawls out a window, lands on a van, uses it to
      launch himself over a fence, landing safely in a lot marked,
      "Police Impound:  Stolen Property".  The Crow surveys the
      area.  A couple of cars and a few motorcycles.



      To ESTABLISH our transition to evening.



      Albrecht stands next to a pile of fresh dirt watching as a
      couple of gravediggers help pull a coffin out of the ground.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Let's have a look.

      A crow lands on the top of Shelly Webster's gravestone.

                                      GRAVEDIGGER
                    Procedure says we take this down to
                    one of the city approved mortuaries
                    before we open it.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    Just open it, Greely.  Heat's on me.

      The gravedigger considers this, indicates to his counterpart
      that they should go ahead.  They both put protective masks
      on.  Albrecht covers his mouth and nose with his handkerchief.

      The casket is popped open.  Surprise registers on all faces.

                                      GRAVEDIGGER
                    This some kind of joke, Albrecht?

      Albrecht slowly lets his handkerchief fall from his face.

                                      ALBRECHT
                    If it is, I'm not in on it.      THE CROW                                        Zabel                            Writers Draft                                 53.

      THE CASKET

      Seemingly completely empty, as if it's never been used. 
      Upon closer inspection, however, WE SEE traces of some kind
      of black ash-like powder.  WE HEAR the opening strains of an
      ELECTRIC GUITAR.
