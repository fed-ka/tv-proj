  BATIATUS and SOLONIUS move through the sparsely populated 
  streets. The ROAR OF A CROWD audible in the b.g.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  hissed)(
                        Tullius spills blood in our own 
                        fucking house, yet my father 
                        condemns innocent son!

  A FLASH of guilt seizes Solonius. Unbeknownst to Batiatus, 
  he was the one that informed Tullius of Petronius  party at 
  the villa (in Ep. HB4).

                                        SOLONIUS
                        The blame is mine.
                                  quickly, covering)(
                      If I had only stayed a while 
                        longer...

                                        BATIATUS
                        You might have joined Gaia in 
                        untimely end. No. The fault rests 
                        with Tullius alone.

  The crowd ROARS in the distance. Batiatus tightens.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Listen to them. Cheering the final 
                        games of the old arena. Yet here we 
                        stand. As removed from them as Gaia 
                        from this world. Courtesy again of 
                        fucking Tullius.

  Solonius squirms, needing to broach uncomfortable subject.

                                        SOLONIUS
                      It appears I will be making 
                        appearance after all.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You gain invitation to the games?

                                        SOLONIUS

                        A minor position, the effort far 
                        exceeding the reward.

  A tense beat. Batiatus smiles, warmly grasping his friend s 
  shoulder.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    5.

                      It stirs heart, to know you 
                        unscathed from association with me.

                                  subject)
                        Petronius seemed quite pleased with 
                        your offerings. Perhaps there is 
                        still opportunity for you to gain 
                        placement in the opening games of 
                        the new arena.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Fuck the new arena. Fuck Tullius, 
                        fuck the fucking gods! None of it 
                        fucking matters now.

                                        SOLONIUS
                                  shocked)(

                                        BATIATUS
                        That would be a kindness. He 
                        demands I dissolve it. Or find 
                        myself put to street with her.

  Solonius takes that in, his own blossoming interest in 
  Lucretia getting the better of him.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Then perhaps it best... if she were 
                      to find another husband.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I would fucking sever cock from 
                        body, than see her from my arms.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        I would hold the same at first, in 
                        your position. Yet it would crumble 
                      to simple reason: If you still 
                        intend to run the ludus, what other 
                        choice remains?

  OFF BATIATUS, feeling the sting of truth in Solonius  
  words...                                                                                    6.



  GLADIATORS train in the early day s sun. GNAEUS snares a 
  palus with his net, gaining in skill.

  CRIXUS AND BARCA

  spar. Crixus manages to topple Barca. Barca laughs in 
  surprise. Crixus extends a hand to help him up. Barca takes 
  it with a grin, their friendship growing.

  ASHUR AND DAGAN

  pass by, trading blows. Dagan is on the offensive, angrily 
  pummeling Ashur. Driving him back before finally KNOCKING 
  Ashur off his feet. Ashur lands hard near RHASKOS and 
  DURATIUS as they spar.

                        presented your ass to a Roman for 
                        rough pleasure.

  Ashur glares at the reference to what he did to Dagan at 
  Petronius  affair. Spits in contempt as he rises.

                                        ASHUR
                        You speak of piss.

  The Gladiators chuckle. Including Dagan.

  Ashur SWALLOWS hard at this new development as we REVERSE TO

  OENOMAUS WALKING WITH TITUS

  across the square. Titus eyes the men critically.

                                        TITUS
                        What do you make of Dagan?

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Size and skill an advantage. If 
                        dull wit can be honed, he will 
                        prove asset.

  Oenomaus  attention is pulled away by Gannicus appearing 
  from the Infirmary. Wounds still fresh from his fight with 
  Tullius (in Ep. HB4).

                                          OENOMAUS(cont'd)
                        Gannicus. Work the palus, if you 
                        are able.

  Gannicus nods, heads for the palus. The guilt of his illicit 
  kiss with Melitta (HB4) hangs heavy as he passes Oenomaus. 
  Titus fumes at the sight of Gannicus  condition.

                                        TITUS

  Titus nods, grasping Oenomaus  shoulder warmly as he moves 
  off. Oenomaus CRACKS his whip, gaining the men s attention.

  The men pause in their training. OFF OENOMAUS, his eyes 
  hardening to the task he has been given...                                                                                    9.



  MUSIC SWELLS as we MONTAGE through several fights of the 
  gladiator ranking competition. Oenomaus circles with whip in 
  hand. Titus watches from the balcony as:

  BARCA

  battles Ashur. Ashur presses an assault. Barca counters, 
  cracking Ashur in the face with his practice spear. Ashur s 
  BLOOD FLIES and CAMERA REVERSES TO

  GANNICUS

  as blood SPLATTERS his cheek. He battles Rhaskos, who is on 
  the defensive. Gannicus SWINGS his practice swords, sending 
  Rhaskos crashing back. As he hits the ground we see it is 
  now

  AMBIORIX,

  a burly gladiator being attacked by Dagan. Ambiorix rolls to 
  his feet. Dagan brutally dismantles him, sending him back to 
  the ground in an

  EXPLOSION OF SAND

  that TRANSITIONS us to Crixus battling NICOMEDES, a lean 
  Greek who fights with a long shield and wooden gladius. 
  Crixus seems at ease, his confidence growing as he deflects 
  Nicomedes  assault with a grin. The men CHEER them on.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    11.

  ANGLE ON THE PANTRY

  as Melitta retrieves an amphora of wine. She glances at 
  Oenomaus across the square, who is unaware of her presence. 
  Her eyes drift to Gannicus, watching the fight from the back 
  of the throng. Her gaze lingers, her dream still fresh.

  GANNICUS

  senses her gaze, turning to lock eyes. He offers a hesitant 
  smile. Melitta STARTLES, quickly turning away to move back 
  upstairs. Gannicus longingly watches her go.

  THE ROAR OF THE MEN

  pull his attention back to the fight as Crixus hammers 
  Nicomedes to the ground. Nicomedes throws up the missio, 
  bloodied and beaten. The men BELLOW. Oenomaus CRACKS his 
  whip.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Gnaeus! Pollux! Take position!

  THE BALCONY

  Batiatus steps from the villa, surprised by the activity.

                        A word that should lift a man, 
                        filling his life with ease and 
                        children. She gives you neither.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You seek to tear heart from chest, 
                        and expect gratitude it no longer 
                        beats.

                                        TITUS
                        I seek only to call you son, absent 
                        shame in the title.

  Batiatus is stung by this remark. Hurt by the truth of it.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  soft)(
                        And I only ever wished to make you 
                        proud, father.

  And it s out there. Batiatus laid bare. Titus  own anger 
  gives way to painful regret, the gulf between them ever 
  widening. He turns back to the contest, unable to find words 
  to bridge the gap.

                                        TITUS
                        The rankings will be decided at 
                        contest s end, two days hence. I 
                        will grant you equal time to prove 
                        you have moved beyond past 
                        transgressions. Dissolve your 
                        marriage... or call me father no 
                        more.

  OFF the ultimatum...



  -- THE BLAZING SUN scorches the CHEERING MEN as Gnaeus 
  battles Ashur.  Gnaeus SLINGS HIS NET, entangling Ashur.  
  KICKS him to the ground, trident at his throat.  Ashur gives 
  the missio.  The men CHEER.

                                        GNAEUS
                        Perhaps I should throw the tadpole 
                        back.

  The Gladiators ERUPT in laughter.  Ashur glares, but there s 
  a good bit of humiliation and worry behind his anger as he 
  untangles himself.  The contest is not going well for him.

  THE BALCONY

  Titus and Batiatus gaze down at the men.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Gnaeus continues to gain in skill 
                      as Retiarius.  Soon he will ignite 
                        the crowd, as I promised.

  Titus GRUNTS, barely acknowledging the comment.  Batiatus 
  tightens, starts to reply.  Lucretia appears with Melitta, 


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    16.

    interrupting the thought.  Melitta carries a simple amphora 
  of honeyed wine.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Apologies for the hour of my 
                        rising.  Sleep came with difficulty 
                        last night.

  She casts a cool look at Batiatus.  Batiatus tenses, unsure 
  of what she will say in front of his father.  Titus ignores 
  them both, his eyes instead on Crixus and Duratius as they 
  finish gearing up to face each other.

                                        TITUS
                        Your absence was not noticed.

  Lucretia forces a smile.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Yet the apology stands.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  quickly)(
                        A noble gesture, well appreciated.

  Titus glances at her, cool to the sentiment.  His eyes fall 
  on the amphora of wine.

                                        TITUS
                        The mulsum more so.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Let me fill your cup.

  Lucretia takes the amphora and pours.  Batiatus relaxes.  
  She s taking his advice in plying Titus with kindness.  
  Oenomaus announces the next pairing in the square below.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Duratius!  Crixus!  Take position!

  Duratius and Crixus move to comply.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Crixus appears of a form, does he 
                        not?

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Begin!

  Crixus attacks.  A deadly show of grace and speed.  Lucretia 
  hands Titus his cup.  Titus nods, drinks.  Lucretia eyes 
  Crixus as he fights.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    17.

                        One that Gaia favored from first 
                        sight.

  Titus darkens upon mention of Gaia.  Naevia appears before 
  he can reply.

                                        NAEVIA
                        Apologies.  Tullius arrives.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  shocked)(

                        See him to my office.

  Naevia exits.  Lucretia barely contains her outrage.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        What is that man doing in our 
                        house?

                                        TITUS
                      My house.  And he comes in response 
                      to invitation.

  Titus exits, giving no further explanation.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Tullius should be hurled from 
                        fucking cliff.  Yet instead my 
                        father takes knee to swallow cock.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        And you do nothing to stop him.  
                        Save lay blame where none should 
                        rest.

  Batiatus  anger turns to guilt over his words last night.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I am a fool in such regard.  
                        Allowing frustration to strip 
                        tongue of sense.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        And spilling truth as consequence.

                        Everything spins from fucking 
                        control.

  The pressure of Batiatus  impossible situation crushes down 
  on him.  He stares out at Crixus battling Duratius.  Lost.  
  Lucretia sees this, softens.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        You desire a son of your own.  To 
                        carry your name and make you proud.

                        I would do anything to give you 
                        such a treasure.

  Batiatus looks at his wife.  Loves her so fucking much in 
  this moment.  Which makes what he has to say all the more 
  painful.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I must give him my decision 
                        tomorrow.  It is too late for such 
                        dreams.

  Crixus lays out Duratius down below.  The men ROAR.  Crixus 
  throws his arms up, his confidence rising quickly to the 
  levels of season 1.  Lucretia smiles at the victory.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      It is never too late.  When will is 
                        set to purpose.

  Lucretia s meaning is clear: we must do what it takes to rid 
  ourselves of Titus.  OFF BATIATUS, the pressure 
    increasing...



  TIME SLOWS as a SPEAR stabs towards camera.  REVERSE TO FIND 
  Gannicus, bending out of the way, the tip narrowly missing 
  his face.  RAMP TO REAL SPEED as Gannicus straightens and 
  attacks Barca, his twin practice swords slicing the air.

  ANGLE ON ASHUR

  as he cautiously sidles up to Dagan, who stands watching the 
  match with Rhaskos and Ambiorix.

                                        ASHUR

  Dagan ignores him.  Ashur licks his lips, clearly worried as 
  he whispers to Dagan.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)

  Dagan spits, his eyes never leaving the match.  Ashur s 
  worry increases.  The men CHEER as

  GANNICUS AND BARCA

  trade thunderous blows.  Gannicus  focus is momentarily 
  pulled away by

  attending Batiatus and Lucretia on the balcony.  She locks 
  eyes with Gannicus for a frozen moment.  Filled with longing 
  and pain.

  WHAM!

  Barca cracks Gannicus in the face with his shield.  Gannicus 
  spits blood, eyes flashing murder.

                                        GANNICUS
                        You lumbering shit!

  Gannicus attacks, his swords hammering Barca.  Gannicus 
  dismantles the big man, sends him crashing to the sand.  
  Gannicus raises one of his swords to bash his skull in.

  Dagan says nothing as he takes position.  Ashur grips his

  Ashur presses, hope swelling.  It is quickly dashed as Dagan 
  counters.  He pounds Ashur, delivering a brutal beating.

  THE BALCONY

  Titus enters from the villa.  Batiatus greets him with 
  barely concealed hostility over Tullius  visit.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Good Tullius has taken leave?

                        house this time?

  Titus greets that with a frown, Tullius  offer weighing 
  heavy on his thoughts.  The CHEERS of the men grant him 
    distraction, pulling his eyes to

  DAGAN

  as he dismantles Ashur.  A devastating blow sends Ashur to 
  his knees, blood dripping from his battered face.  Dagan 
  moves in to finish him off.  Ashur looks up, eyes pleading.

  Dagan looks at his helpless companion before him... and 
  softens.  With a subtle NOD, he gives Ashur the go-ahead.  
  Ashur suddenly surges up, catching Dagan in the face with 
  his shield.  Dagan staggers.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    25.

  ASHUR SWINGS HIS PRACTICE SWORD

  with all his might.  It slams into Dagan s face, RIPPING 
  OPEN HIS EYE in a spray of blood and gore.

  DAGAN SCREAMS

  in agony, collapsing to the sand, clutching his ruined 
  socket.  Ashur throws his arms up in triumph, shouting to 
  the stunned spectators.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)
                        Ashur, the fucking victor!

  THE BALCONY

  Titus calls down to Oenomaus and the men.

                                        TITUS
                        Rest, and tend wounds.  Tomorrow 
                        bring send of contest.  And 
                        appropriate reckoning.

  Titus turns, heading back into --



  CAMERA slowly sweeps the empty stands.  Sections of wood and 
  railing have been torn away by rowdy fans seeking souvenirs 
  before the arena is torn down.  Debris litters the sand.

                                        TITUS (O.S.)
                      My very first memories were formed 
                        within this arena.

  SWING AROUND to REVEAL Titus taking in this relic of glories 
  past.  Batiatus follows a few paces behind.

                                        TITUS
                        Attending the games as a child, 
                        upon my father s knee.  Too young 
                      to yet form words.

  Titus takes a handful of sand.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                        Yet I knew even then.  That I would 
                        give my life to this place.

  He lets the sand drift through his fingers.  Feeling how 
  easily it is lost.

                                        BATIATUS
                        A noble calling.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    30.

                        One I had dreamed you would share 
                        in.

  Batiatus processes that.  Picks up a scrap of wood the rough 
  size of a club.  Considers it.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  soft)(
                        Was I not raised here as well?

                                        TITUS
                        You were.

  Titus smiles at the memory.  It is short lived.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                        I fear it is the only thing we hold 
                        common now.

                                        BATIATUS
                        And you stand me at fault.  As you 
                        always have.

  Batiatus  grip tightens on the scrap of wood.  Just the 
  right heft to bash a man s skull in....

                                        TITUS
                                  flaring)(
                        I stand you accountable for your 
                        actions.

  Titus is racked by a fit of coughing, gets control of it.  A 
  beat as his anger gives way to weary sadness.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                        You have caused me much heartache.  
                        Never heeding my words. Fighting me 
                      at every turn, your ambition the 
                        bolt hurled against my wishes.  And 
                        here is where it has led.

  He turns away, tears welling in his eyes.  Unable to face 
  his son.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                        Two men at constant odds.  Mired in 
                        the ruins of what might have been.

  Batiatus darkens, steeling his courage to what must be done.  
  For Lucretia.  For himself.  He slowly advances on Titus  


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    31.

                                  a beat, soft)(

                        wanted you to join me here, to see 
                        them buried.

  Titus turns back to face him.  Batiatus tenses, well within 
  striking distance.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                        You are my son, Quintus.  And I 
                        will always love you.  No matter 
                        the path you take.

  Batiatus wavers.  This is not what he was expecting.

                                        BATIATUS
                        What moves such downpour, after 
                        eternal drought?

                                        TITUS

                        the opening games.

                                        BATIATUS
                      At what price?

                                        TITUS

                        Gannicus.

  Batiatus  absorbs that, his hand again tightening around his 
  ersatz weapon.

                                        BATIATUS
                        And your response?

                                        TITUS
                        Without meaning, if you are not by 
                      my side upon the day s arrival.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You give me until tomorrow, yet now 
                        press for answer?

                                        TITUS
                        A day, a year... A man either knows 
                        his heart or he does not.  Stand 
                        with me.  And we shall rise 
                        together.

  Titus looks at Batiatus, eyes almost pleading.  A tense 
  beat.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  soft)(
                        I will not turn from my wife.

  Titus nods.  Devastated by his choice.  But a true 
    understanding finally blossoming.

                                        TITUS
                        You really never did want this 
                        life, did you?

                        world, I pray it brings you peace.

  Titus turns to go.  Batiatus wrestles with himself, comes to 
  a decision.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Father.

  Titus pauses.  Batiatus advances with the wood scrap -- and 
  hands it to him.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        A memento.  Of days past.

  Batiatus walks out.  OFF TITUS, small and alone...



  The sun hangs low.  Storm clouds have marshaled in the 
  distance.  The men have gathered for the final contest of 
  the day.  Oenomaus consults with Gannicus before it begins.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    37.

                        Only if you fall.  Clear mind.  And 
                        prove yourself the man I know you 
                      to be.

                        Doctore.

  Oenomaus looks to the balcony where Titus stands.  Naevia 
  attends in the background.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                        Let us begin.  And know who truly 
                        stands champion of this house.

  His eyes fall on Gannicus with a frown.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Crixus.  Gannicus.  Take position.

  Gannicus moves to comply, meeting Crixus in the center of 
  the square.  Crixus  eyes blaze with determination.

                                        CRIXUS
                        A second chance to prove myself 
                        against you.  The gods have heard 
                      my prayers.

                                        GANNICUS
                        And curse you in the answering.

  Gannicus  eyes go hard and cold, knowing his fate hangs in 
  the balance of this match.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Begin!

  Gannicus and Crixus clash together.  Gannicus is surprised 
  to find Crixus much improved since their match before Varus 
  (Ep. 2).  They battle it out, each landing blows.

  BATIATUS

  steps out onto the balcony with Lucretia.  Lucretia wears 
  Gaia s red wig for the first time.  A final act of defiance.  
  Melitta and Naevia attend.  Titus does not notice them, his 
  attention fixed on the fight.  Batiatus eyes him, 
  conflicting emotions roiling.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    38.

                        Father.  We near ready to leave.

  Titus does not turn around, yet his heart is clearly 
  troubled.

                                        TITUS
                        Pause a moment.  And see contest 
                        ended.

  A small spasm of COUGHING seizes him.  Batiatus hesitates, 
  looking to Lucretia.  She nods in acceptance.

                                        LUCRETIA
                                to Naevia)(

                        Domina.

  Naevia exits.  Batiatus joins his father at the railing, 
  looking down at the fight.  A beat.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Crixus again shows form.

                      As does Gannicus.  Both men you

                        Perhaps you have learned something 
                        after all these years.

  Batiatus smiles sadly at that.

                        Perhaps.

  Crixus unleashes a furious volley down below.  Melitta 
  wincesas Gannicus gets hammered.  Lucretia eyes Crixus with 
  mixed feelings of revulsion and fascination.

  GANNICUS COUNTERS,

  assaulting Crixus with lightning fast blows.  Crixus takes a 
  blow to the face, sending BLOOD flying.  Crixus staggers 
  back -- and grins.  Is that the best you got?  The men CHEER 
  as he attacks, WIPING US TO --                                                                                    39.



  Crixus CHARGES Gannicus.  TIME SLOWS as Gannicus SWINGS his 
  practice swords to meet the attack.  Crixus SLIDES beneath 
  the arcing blades, SHOWERING the camera in a SPRAY of SAND.

  RAMP BACK TO NORMAL SPEED,

  as Crixus slams Gannicus in the back of the knees with his 
  practice sword, collapsing him to the ground.

  OENOMAUS TENSES,

  aware of the fight s stakes and sensing that Gannicus has 
  his hands full.

  CRIXUS RISES

  and attacks, narrowly missing Gannicus who ROLLS AWAY just 
  in time.  Gannicus surges to his feet.  The two trade bone-
  jarring blows.

  THE BALCONY

  Batiatus can t help but be taken by the display, despite his 
  current situation.

                        I shall miss this.

  Titus smiles sadly, a COUGH building.

  Melitta pours a cup, hands it to Titus.

  THE TRAINING SQUARE

  Gannicus catches sight of Melitta on the balcony.  They lock 
  eyes, both filled with pain and regret.  And once again she 
  turns away.

  CRIXUS SEIZES THE MOMENT

  and attacks.  Gannicus narrowly counters.  But there s 
  something different about him.  A spark that has been 
  dimmed, threatening to fade altogether.  As Crixus presses, 
  Gannicus FLASHES TO --



  Crixus hammers Gannicus.  Gannicus is driven back under the 
  assault as he FLASHES TO --



  Gannicus counters Crixus  attack, but it is halfhearted.  
  Oenomaus tenses, not liking where this is going.

  THE BALCONY

  Melitta s eyes are pulled to Gannicus, concern blooming in 
  her eyes.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    42.

  TRAINING SQUARE

  Crixus continues to press.  Gannicus counters, FLASHING BACK 
  TO --



  TIGHT ON GANNICUS, his eyes filling with pain and loss as he 
  defends against Crixus  onslaught.  He comes to a decision 
  -- he is going to lose.  Gannicus subtly lowers his defenses 
  just enough to give Crixus an opening.

  RAMP TO SLOW-MO

  as Crixus swings around, his shield slamming into Gannicus  
  face.  Blood flies as Gannicus is lifted from his feet and 
  slams to the ground.  RESUME NORMAL SPEED as Crixus pounces, 
  positioning his sword to Gannicus  throat.  A tense beat.  
  Broken by Gannicus raising the missio.

  THE GLADIATORS

  erupt, stunned by the display.  Melitta s heart sinks.  As 
  does Oenomaus  as he s forced to announce --

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Crixus, victor.

  The men CHEER for Crixus as he offers hand to Gannicus.  
  Crixus hisses as he helps him up, eyes narrowing in 
  suspicion.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Why did you drop guard?

                                        GANNICUS
                        You are champion now.  That is all 
                        that matters.

  Gannicus turns and heads towards his cell.  Crixus watches 
  him go, his victory ringing hollow.

  THE BALCONY

  Batiatus is absolutely stunned that Gannicus has lost.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    43.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I would not thought it possible.

                                        TITUS
                      To be said of many things this day.

  There s so much more Titus wants to say to his son.  So much 
  more to get him to stay.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                        Quintus, it is not too late --

  A FIT OF COUGHING overtakes him.  Only this one doesn t 
  stop.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Father?

  Batiatus just manages to catch Titus as he collapses.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                                to Melitta)(
                        Fetch the medicus!  Quickly!

  Melitta hustles out.  Batiatus holds his father, not knowing 
  what to do.  Lucretia stands in the background, her face 
    unreadable...



  Oenomaus carries Melitta s body down from the villa.  
  Consumed with grief, he does not see

  GANNICUS

  standing by the cliff in the training square.  Gannicus 
  watches Oenomaus carry Melitta into the ludus.  SLOW PUSH IN 
  on Gannicus.  Melitta s blood still fresh on his skin.  Hot 
  tears of loss and guilt stinging his cheeks.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    51.

  LIGHTNING FLASHES,

  followed by the crack of THUNDER.  The skies open, weeping 
  in sympathy.
