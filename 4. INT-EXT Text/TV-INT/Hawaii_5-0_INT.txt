      In BLACK -- sound of LOCKS sliding back -- KEYS turning -- a 
      door OPENS and LIGHT floods in on a MAN.  Squinting, 
      unshaven.  In black jumpsuit, sitting on the floor.  ANTON 
      HESSE, 30 s, dark, short-cropped hair, olive skin Euro:

                                    A MAN S VOICE
                    Our prisoner s name is Anton   
                    Hesse --

      As Hesse is pulled to his feet by THREE MP S -- 


      We re TIGHT on another face -- the face of a hero: LIEUTENANT 
      COMMANDER STEVE McGARRETT.  More on him in a minute.  He s 
      giving a mission brief to ROK and US Military Personnel -- 
      this is all shot LONG LENS, HANDHELD -- 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    He and his brother Victor are 
                      responsible for more than two 
                    hundred civilian deaths -- 

      McGarrett turns in profile and we RACK TO THE PLASMA behind 
      him -- a file photo of VICTOR HESSE.  We ll meet him soon.

                    They provided intel and explosives 
                    used to bomb the American embassy

      Anton is being fully searched by one of the MP s as the other 
      two over-watch.  Checking mouth down to the feet --

                    The majority of their funding comes 
                    from the arms trade, and more 
                    recently, coordinating logistics 
                    for Human Trafficking organizations 
                    --  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 2.




      PLASMA NEWS CLIP -- Human trafficking.  Horrific sight, 
      deplorable conditions, young children:

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)
                    -- moving women and children for 
                      commercial, sexual and forced labor 
                    around the world.  Anton handled 
                    the numbers side of it, Victor s 
                    the enforcer... and still 
                      operating.


      LONG LENS: Anton shackled, hands and feet, the MPs escorting 
      him down a large corridor to a set of double doors -- 

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)
                    We re transporting our package to 
                    Osan Air Base, then onto Diego 
                    Garcia -- I want him secured and in 
                    the air in two hours -- 


      MUSIC -- MOMENTUM -- soldiers break to their vehicles and 
      mount up -- two armored HMMWV s and a US ARMY M1126 ICV 
      (Infantry Carrier Vehicle) STRYKER: an eight-wheeled, nine-
      passenger badass combat vehicle -- 

                                  MCGARRETT (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    -- the rest of the team will head 
                    to Naples, Victor s last known 
                    location.  Let s move -- 

      When Anton s led out, he and McGarrett lock eyes: mutual 
      hatred.  Anton s placed into the Stryker.  McGarrett climbs 
      in behind him -- rear ramp CLOSES -- the caravan pulls away --


      McGarrett sits across from Hesse and two MP s. 

      And now, a word about our hero: If you d ask McGarrett s 
      Naval Instructors at Annapolis for a recommendation, they d 
      say he s the best man for the job, only sometimes you don't 
      want the best man if he won't listen to a word you say.  

      Anton just STARES at him with a strange expression:

                                  ANTON
                    You don't look Hawaiian.  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 3.

      For all his cool, that catches McGarrett off guard: how does 
      Anton know he s Hawaiian?  As he leans in, dark, quiet: 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    You re gonna tell us everything.

                                  ANTON
                    You were born there, right?

                      MCGARRETTANTON 
      -- every buyer you ve worked -- five years chasing me and *
      with, your trafficking my brother around the world, *
      associates --you think we didn t do our 
                                                    homework on you?

      And then McGarrett s cell RINGS -- HARSH -- SUDDEN.  He 
      checks caller ID:  DAD .  

                                  ANTON (CONT D)
                    You should really answer that... 
                    you don t talk to your father often 
                    enough.

      Fear grips McGarrett s heart.  What the hell is this?  Anton 
      gestures, almost casual:  Answer.   Finally, he does -- 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Dad...

                                  JAMES (O.S.)
                    Champ --

                                  MCGARRETT
                          (thrown:  Champ? )
                    You all right?


      We re TIGHT on the bruised and bloody face of JAMES McGARRETT 
      (sixties, ex Honolulu PD), phone pressed to his ear -- along 
      with the BARREL of a CZECH-MADE CZ-TT .45 PISTOL:

                                  JAMES
                    I don t know what s-- who re these 
                    people, Ste--?

      -- now the phone s pulled away by VICTOR HESSE (mid-
      thirties), the man we saw in the briefing -- Anton's even 
      deadlier brother -- and we WIDEN to reveal James bound to a 
      chair in the kitchen:

                                  HESSE
                    Now I know where you get it from -- 
                    you ve got a tough old man here.


      PUSH IN on McGarrett's face -- frozen:  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 4.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    If you hurt him I will f--

                                  HESSE
                    That s not the way to go, Steve.  
                    Can I call you  Steve ?  Steve: I m 
                    offering you a trade.  Your father 
                    for my brother.   

      Steve s eyes SNAP UP to meet Anton s across from him -- maybe 
      three feet away -- just grinning a big, fat  eat shit  grin.  

                                  HESSE (CONT D)
                    All things considered, I d say it s 
                    more than generous, wouldn t you?

      McGarrett -- MOTION -- grabs a PAD from his cargo pocket and 
      scribbles a NOTE: 

      "CONTACT THE TOC, SEND HONOLULU PD TO MY FATHER S HOUSE NOW  

      -- TEARS it off, hands it to an MP, who hands it to the 
      VEHICLE COMMANDER -- the Commander looks at the note, 
      confused -- McGARRETT SNAPS HIS FINGERS URGENTLY:  Fucking do 
      it!!  -- the Commander accesses the FBCB2 digital comm 
      system, quickly sending the message via text -- 

                                  MCGARRETT (INTO PHONE)
                    You re smart enough to know that s 
                    never gonna happen -- 

                                  HESSE
                    Well I appreciate the compliment -- 
                    are you?  Smart enough?

                                  MCGARRETT
                    You know how this works: even if I 
                    wanted to let him go, we don t 
                    negotiate with terrori -- 


                                  HESSE
                    -- make an exception.  Family s... 
                      everything.

      Behind Hesse, a tech weasel works a ruggedized military 
      laptop on the kitchen table: JOVAN ELTSIN, late 20 s, makes a 
       keep talking  gesture by swinging a finger -- 

      ON THE LAPTOP SCREEN: A MAP -- SOUTH KOREAN TOPOGRAPHY -- a 
      GREEN TRIANGLE keeps getting SMALLER as it locks onto the 
      cell signal, triangulating the motorcade s location.  


      -- up front, the Vehicle Commander finishes a CALL and 
      scribbles something on the other side of the paper McGarrett 
      gave him: "PD ON THE WAY... 10 MINUTES OR LESS."    H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 5.

      Little relief -- McGarrett -- mind racing -- knows he s gotta 
      try something else -- anything -- switches gears:

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Alright, look... look... don t do 
                    this.  We can figure something out.  
                    But I m not gonna negotiate like 
                    this -- 


      BEEP BEEP BEEP: the laptop LOCKS ON to McGarrett s phone --  
      and a SATELLITE THERMAL IMAGE APPEARS -- we see the moving 
      convoy in GRAYTONE and WHITE HOT SPOTS. Eltsin grabs a 
      WALKIE, MURMURS to someone on the other line as McGarrett 
      keeps talking to Hesse: 

                        HESSEELTSIN (INTO RADIO)
      Oh, are we negotiating now?One to Ghost: I have them 
                                                    heading South along Highway 3 
                                                  toward Uijeongbu -- 


      McGARRETT.  Controlled fury -- but VULNERABLE.  Scared.  New 
      territory for him:

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)
                    Kill him and you get nothing.  

                                  JAMES 
                    Give me the phone.  

      Hesse looks over at JAMES in the chair, pleading:

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                    Please.  I can get him to help you.   
                          (beat, emotional)
                    He ll listen to me... he s my son.

      Hesse considers -- his eyes shoot to Eltsin, who mouths:  30 
      SECONDS...  Hesse Puts the gun and phone next to James' face 
      again -- the old man wracked with fear, yeah, but something 
      MORE: an insane GUILT he's been shouldering for a lifetime:

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                    Listen to me, Champ --  

                                  MCGARRETT
                    -- I m gonna get you out of there, 
                    okay, Dad?  Don t worr--

                                  JAMES
                    I m sorry... I'm sorry I lied to 
                    you.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    What re you talking about?  Lied to 
                    me about what?  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 6.

      And now TEARS come to James  eyes -- trying not to break --

                                  JAMES
                    I love you, Son. 

      McGarrett is STRUCK.  Words he has rarely, if ever, heard 
      from this man:

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                    I didn t say it enough -- that s my 
                    fault, nor yours -- not Mary s -- 
                    tell her that -- 
                          (looks up at Hesse)
                    And whatever these people want... 

      Eltsin signals:  10 SECONDS...   James stares right down the 
      barrel of Hesse s gun -- heartbroken, scared, but STRONG: 

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                    Don t give it to them.  Don t you 
                    give it to them, you hear m--

      -- WHACK!  Hesse SKULL-CRACKS James, TOPPLING his chair 
      sideways -- he lands HARD on the floor -- dazed, MOANING -- 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Dad?!!! Dad?!!!

          (into phone)I SWEAR TO GOD I WILL HUNT 
      NO MORE GAMES!!!  I TOLD YOU YOU DOWN AND KILL YOU, YOU 
      WHAT I WANT!!!  SONOFABITCH!

      But the line is DEAD.  McGARRETT SHAKING -- FURY -- THEN: 
      Sound of ROTORS THUMPING.  McGarrett looks up at Anton, who 
      says -- simply:

                                  ANTON
                    Boom.


      SATELLITE COVERAGE OF THE ATTACK ON ELTSIN S LAPTOP SCREEN: 
      Hesse watches the STRYKER swerve, barely skis under a SECOND 
      MISSILE which -- BOOM! -- KILLS everyone in the follow 
      vehicle.  WE SEE their WHITE HOT IMAGES strewn across the 
      blast area, deathly still,  cooling off.   


      The Driver speeds up, using evasive wheelman techniques.    H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 7.

      Vehicle Commander barks into a radio, calling in the attack. 
      McGarrett grabs a bullet proof vest -- straps it on Anton.  
      The two lock eyes.  Anton just fucking GRINNING -- loving 
      every second of this. 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    We need cover!  Head for that draw! 

      The driver throws the wheel left and OFF THE ROAD -- 


      The KOREAN PILOT engages the RMS (Rocket Management System) --  

      PILOT S POV -- THE HEADS UP DISPLAY: Brackets the Stryker 
      heading off the road.  Fires four HIGH ENERGY MAGNETIC 
      ROCKETS.  WHOOSH! WHOOSH! -- WHOOSH! WHOOSH! 


      The Driver jerks the wheel to the left -- then right -- 
      trying to avoid the next volley -- 


      The world is THROWN SIDEWAYS as everyone in the vehicle SLAMS 
      into walls -- TUMBLING -- until it finally STOPS.


      INTENSELY CLOSE ON HESSE -- eyes on the laptop.  Only one 
      VIBRANT HEAT SIGNATURE remains.  Hesse knows what it means --   

                                  HESSE
                    My brother s dead, isn t he?
                         (rage + grief)
                    ISN T HE? 

      INTENSELY CLOSE ON McGARRETT -- going insane -- tears 
      flooding his eyes -- his silence confirms it --

                    So is your father.  

      BLAM!  AS MCGARRETT FLINCHES AT THE GUNSHOT -- WE SLAM TO THE 
      MOMENT WE VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR:

      BREAKING WAVE -- mind-blowing, rapid fire IMAGES from the

      FADE IN:


      -- BLASTING from a boombox.  A vintage DASHBOARD HULA GIRL 
      dances atop the instrument panel.  As the crew prepares for 
      final approach, McGarrett, in uniform, ducks in unannounced: 
      CAPTAIN DEMARCO kills the music, stows the topless hula girl, 
      as the rest of the crew lose their smiles --

                                  MCGARRETT
                    At ease, Fellas.  

                                  MAJOR KNOWLES
                    Excuse us, Sir --  little ritual we 
                    do when we approach the islands.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Mind if I sit up here for landing?

                                  MAJOR KNOWLES
                    Go right ahead. 

      McGarrett takes the jumpseat.  As the plane breaks through 
      clouds... THE ISLAND OF O AHU IS REVEALED.  McGarrett stares  
      -- haunted.  Old ghosts.  The crew can sense this.

                                  CPT. DEMARCO
                    Sir, how long since you've been 
                    home?

                    I don't remember.


      The man they're talking about, DET. DANNY WILLIAMS, is parked 
      outside a palatial ocean view gated estate in Diamond Head.  
      Danny s ex-Baltimore PD, real working man in paradise.  Only 
      guy on the island without a tan and always looks like he 
      slept in his clothes.  Next to him, in the passenger seat, 
      sits a brand new stuffed animal -- a PINK BUNNY RABBIT.  He 
      skims the McGARRETT CASE FILE as he talks on a cell:

                    murder.  Suspect name is Frank

      He hangs up and gets out, greets the 7-YEAR OLD GIRL walking 
      down the driveway, wearing a backpack and carrying a small 
      cage with a REAL PET RABBIT inside.  This is Danny's daughter 
      GRACE WILLIAMS.  The only reason he smiles occasionally.

                    'Morning, sunshine.

                                  GRACE
                    Hi daddy.

                                  DANNY
                    Who's this?

                                  GRACE
                    Mr. Hoppy.  Stan bought him for me 
                    for animal show and tell.

      Danny keeps his emotions in check, but we see the hitch, 
      feeling like he's always coming up short.

                                  DANNY
                    That's great... we better go.  We 
                    don't want Mr. Hoppy to be late for 
                    his first day of school.  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 16.

      As they get to the car, Danny manages to toss his Pink Bunny 
      into the back seat before Grace can see it.  They drive off -- 
      BAGPIPES FADING IN OVER --


      -- McGarrett uses it to let himself in. Turns on the lights -- 
      and there she is -- his father's pride and joy, a 1968 
      MERCURY BROUGHAM.  Tarp partially rolled back, a restoration 
      project forever.  Suddenly, we FLASH CUT TO:


      SIX-YEAR OLD STEVE MCGARRETT by his proud FATHER'S side -- as 
      they circle the old beater --

                                  JAMES
                    Feast your eyes -- The Park Lane 
                    Brougham.  Mercury's flagship 
                    vehicle.  Steve, we re going to 
                    make her cherry and when the time 
                    comes, she's yours.

      RESUME MCGARRETT.  His face.  He's just fed the fire. 



      Light pops on: BLOOD STAINS SCREAM AT US from the already- 
      processed crime scene.  McGarrett just stands there a beat.  
      Sick.  Then: 

      JUMP CUTS: McGarrett conducts his own investigation.  Using 
      directionality of the blood spatter, he stands where Hesse 
      shot his father.  Looks to the wall.  Sees more spatter.   H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 19.

      measures it against his own shoe.  Smaller.  Cause for 
      concern.  Uses his iPhone to SNAP A PHOTO -- then notices 
      something odd about the cluttered kitchen table across the 
      room -- one area looks like someone made room for something -- 
      and the chair is slightly backed away.  This space is away 
      from all the blood, not processed by crime scene.   

      McGarrett considers, opens his duffel for his laptop -- holds 
      it over the small, empty space on the counter: perfect fit. 

      McGarrett mimics the same position -- gets an idea -- on a 
      shelf, lined up, are PINEWOOD DERBY CARS.  Pristine.  His 
      father s hobby.  Grabs a tube of  Hob-e-Lube  dry graphite 
      lubricant powder -- SQUEEZES the tube coating the table and 
      BLOWS lightly:  

      The dust causes two PALM PRINTS to materialize at the edge of 
      the table!  McGarrett snaps photos.  Speed dials a NUMBER:  



      TRACK FAST through the NAVCENT OPERATIONS CENTER teeming with 
      Intel and Tactical Officers manning various workstation -- NO 
      REVEAL OF WHERE WE ARE YET --  as we STOP ON LT. CATHERINE 
      ROLLINS (30), smart and beautiful, manning an INTEL 
      PROCESSING NODE.  BING:  she receives and EMAIL on her 
      console, non-navy.  Email ID shows a photo of McGARRETT, 
      smiling against a tropical backdrop -- a picture surely taken 
      during off-hours.  She reads:  NEED YOUR HELP.  CAN YOU 
      TALK?  Turns to her enlisted COUNTERPART next to her:

                                  CATHERINE
                    Cover for me?  Head call.



      An INTIMACY between these two we ll come to understand as our 
      show progresses -- for now:

                                  MCGARRETT
                    I m e-mailing you two palm prints, 
                    can you run them against the CIA 
                    database and see what turns up?

                    Try.  You get my flowers?

                    Persian Gulf s a little outside the 
                    Conroy s delivery zone--

      PING!  A PHOTO OF ROSES appears on her phone.  She SMILES:

                                  CATHERINE (CONT D)
                    You re like the good-looking guy in 
                    high school who knows how cute he 
                    is, and won t take no for an 
                    answer.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Next time I ll give  em to you in 
                    person.  Promise.

                                  CATHERINE
                    Gimme a few hours.
                          (then, soft concern)
                    Steve... I know what you re 
                    doing... please be careful.

      The moment lingers -- then he hangs up.  Leaves -- 



      -- same way he came in -- through the garage -- Taking it all 
      in one last time: the tools, the clutter, a man's workplace.  
      And then he stops.  Suddenly.  Because he sees something on 
      the shelf that he was totally unprepared for... an old 
      toolbox with a faded CHAMPION SPARK PLUG logo -- but "CHAMP" 
      is the only thing legible after years of use. 

      McGarrett pulls the box off the shelf. Opens it. Inside is AN 
      OLD KEY and a stack of crime scene photos: the aftermath of a 
      car bomb.  All of them are marked with a date that means 
      something to McGarrett. His mind spins -- what is all this?   H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 21.

      Then -- a FLOORBOARD CREAKS.  Someone s in the house.  
      McGarrett quick-draws his automatic, pins himself to the wall 
      -- finger on the trigger -- ready to kill the intruder as he 
      comes around the corner -- TENSION -- and when he does, it s:

      DANNY!  GLOCK OUT.  FRANTIC, OVERLAPPING: 

                        DANNYMCGARRETT
      Don't move -- ! -- who are you?!
      -- who the hell re you?-- Commander Steve McGarrett, 
                                                  this is my father's house --
      -- Detective Danny Williams, 
      Honolulu PD, put your gun 
      away ---- no, you put your gun away 
                                                  and let me see your ID -- 
      -- you show me yours ---- I m not putting my gun 
                                                  down -- 
      -- well I m not either -- 

      Pause -- eye lock -- neither gun lowering -- 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Fine: don t put your gun down, just  
                    use your free hand to pull out your 
                    ID --

                                  DANNY
                    After you -- 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    At the same time -- 

                                  DANNY
                    On three: one... two... three... 

      And they MOVE in tandem -- slowly -- drawing wallets -- now 
      both aiming guns and ID s at each other.  The truth verified, 
      each holsters their weapon... 

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    Look, I m sorry about your father, 
                    but you can t be here -- it s still 
                    an active crime scene -- 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Doesn t seem that active. 

                                  DANNY
                    I can t share information with you.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Then I ll share some with you: 
                    Hesse wasn t here alone -- someone 
                    was sitting at the kitchen table 
                    working on a laptop when my father 
                    was murdered.

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT'D)
                    There was space cleared on the 
                    counter, size of a 13 inch Macbook 
                    pro, and my father hated computers.

                                  DANNY
                    Look, you need to leave now -- 

      McGarrett nods, picks up the CHAMP box and heads out --

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    You can't take that, you know 
                      everything s evidence -- 

                                  MCGARRETT
                          (bold lie)
                    I came with this.

                                  DANNY
                    No you didn t, I can see the dust 
                    void it left on the shelf.  What re 
                    you hiding in there -- ?  

                                  MCGARRETT
                        (dodging)
                    How long have you been with 
                    Honolulu PD?

                                  DANNY
                    None of your damn business, Barbara 
                    Walters -- 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    It is if you re investigating my 
                    father s death -- 

                                  DANNY
                    I d really like to get back to 
                    that, so the sooner you leave, the 
                    sooner I can get on with it -- 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Anything you say.

      Again, McGarrett starts to walk out with the box:

                                  DANNY
                    Leave the box, or get arrested.  

                                  MCGARRETT
                    You gonna call for backup?

                                  DANNY
                    An ambulance.

      Stare off.  Finally, McGarrett puts the box down.

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    Thank you.  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 23.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Don t thank me yet -- 

      -- as he s pulling the Governor s card from his pocket, 
      dialing his cell -- punches in the number -- waits -- 

                                  MCGARRETT (INTO PHONE) (CONT D)
                    Governor Jameson, please... 

                      MCGARRETTDANNY
      Tell her it s Steve (a chuckle)
        McGarrett...Yeah, right.

      McGarrett just grins to Danny:  Be with you in a sec  -- 

                                  MCGARRETT (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    I'll take the job...              
                          (with a look to 
                           the Champ box)
                    Let s just say I found something 
                    that changed my mind.
                          (listens, then)
                      Immediately.  But on one condition  
                    -- when the time comes, I don't 
                    want to hear the words "red tape  
                    or  I'll get back to you."  That 
                      bureaucratic bullshit does not work 
                    with me.  
                          (long beat)
                    Are you serious?  Right now?

      Danny staring.  The hell s happening?  A little sheepishly, 
      McGarrett raises his right hand.  Takes the Oath of Honor: 

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)
                    I, Stephen J.  McGarrett, do 
                    solemnly declare upon my honor and 
                      conscience that I will act at all 
                    times to the best of my ability and 
                    knowledge in a manner befitting an 
                    officer of the law. I will 
                      faithfully obey the orders of my 
                    superiors and will be ready to 
                    confront danger in the line of 
                    duty.  
                          (for Danny; ultra-cheery)
                    Thank you, Governor.
                          (hangs up)
                    Now it s my crime scene.  

      And with a flourish, he sweeps up the CHAMP BOX and heads 
      OUT, leaving a stunned and furious Danny -- 

                                                                  SLAM TO BLACK.

                                            ACT TWO

      FADE IN:


      SEE DANNY behind closed doors with his boss, CAPTAIN HOOKANO  
      -- Danny argues to keep his case, LOUD and ANGRY:

                                  DANNY (O.S.)
                    -- I don t care who he is, I m   
                    working a solid lead here, making 
                    progress -- and I don t like being 
                    benched for some gung-ho Jarhead --

      FIND McGARRETT outside, listening.  Finally, Danny storms 
      out, looks surprised to see McGarrett -- who GRINS:

                                  MCGARRETT
                       Jarhead s  slang for Marine.  I m 
                    Navy.  You wanna insult me, call me 
                    a  Squid. 

      Danny throws him the case file --

                                  DANNY
                    Knock yourself out, Squid.

      Off he goes, to his desk.  Finds a gift waiting for him: a 
      tube of INSTANT TAN wrapped in a bow.  Looks over to 
      DETECTIVE BEN KOKUA and the cluster of fellow Det s nearby, 
      chuckling --

                                  DETECTIVE KOKUA
                    In case you need to go undercover, 
                    brah.

                                  DANNY
                    Wow.  That is funny.  Sun tan 
                    lotion, how d you think of that?

                                  DETECTIVE KOKUA
                    You got some time on your hands 
                    now, solve it.

      Danny watches as the Detectives drift off together, a 
      camaraderie Danny s not a part of... and never will be.  He 
      chucks the tube in the garbage and leaves the precinct, 
      hating his job right now -- KICKS a trash can on the way out. 

      RACK FOCUS to McGarrett, having witnessed this.  Behind him, 
      Hookano has appeared in the doorway, beckoning...

                                  MCGARRETT
                    What do you think of him?

      As they enter...  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 25.


                                    CAPTAIN HOOKANO
                    Bad temper, good cop.  Probably 
                    best they had in Baltimore: Medal 
                    of Honor, bravery in the line of 
                    duty -- but that don t make his job 
                    easier here.  

                                  MCGARRETT
                    You don t seem bothered by that.

      Hookano sits at his desk, leans the chair back:

                                    CAPTAIN HOOKANO
                    He s got an attitude that doesn t 
                    wear well.  Things run a little 
                    different here.  Some of the guys 
                    work in their own time zone -- they 
                    call it  Island Time.   You either 
                    adjust to it or you don t. 
                          (offhanded shrug)
                    I give him a year before he quits.

      There s a  prejudiced  quality that McGarrett  -- despite not 
      knowing Danny, despite not even really liking Danny -- finds 
      himself reacting to on Danny s behalf:   

                                  MCGARRETT
                    And would that year be in  island 
                    time ?

      Hookano looks at McGarrett -- now not liking him either.  
      McGarrett holds the look, steely:

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)
                    He said he was working a solid 
                    lead... what was it?


      A lonely little pit: king bed and a neatly-made kid-size cot.  
      Clothes still in the suitcase.  Empty six packs.  Old take-
      out.  McGarrett picks up a framed photo of Danny's daughter:

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)
                    Your kid?

                                  DANNY
                    Stunning detective work.  

                                  MCGARRETT
                    You don't really let her stay with 
                    you here, do you?

                                  DANNY
                    What are you, Nanny 911?

      He snatches back the photo.  Sets it down.  McGarrett opens 
      the case file, pulls a mugshot: FRANK DORAN.  Real lowlife.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    So who s this guy Doran?  

                                  DANNY
                    Suspected arms dealer: two years in 
                    Maui Correctional for weapons 
                      possession.  Currently a person of 
                    interest in an unrelated homicide, 
                    but the weapon was never found.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    What s he have to do with my 
                    father's case?

                                  DANNY
                    When I ran a ballistics comparison 
                    on the bullet that killed your dad, 
                    I got a hit to the Doran 
                      investigation.  I think the first 
                    thing Hesse did when he got to the 
                    island was get his hands on a gun.        
                    Only I couldn t figure out why he d 
                    hook up with a small fish like 
                    Doran... then I realized: small 
                    fish are harder to trace.  

                                  MCGARRETT
                    That s Hesse s M.O. -- less 
                    linkage.  But since it hasn t even 
                    been 48 hours, maybe Doran still 
                    knows where he is -- let s go talk 
                    to him.   H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 27.

                    like a pain in the ass, thinks 
                    you re good.  That s what I m 
                    looking for. 

                                  DANNY
                    Except guys like you think they 
                    know how to do everything better.  
                    And that just makes my job harder.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    You got no choice, Detective.  The 
                    Governor gave me jurisdiction and 
                    I'm making you my partner.

                    We re gonna get along great.  

      And out he goes, leaving Danny to stew.  BING goes the

                                  DANNY
                    Doran's a shooter and I don't like 
                    this place.  We shouldn't be doing 
                    this without back-up.

                    You're my back-up...

      Before Danny can respond -- McGarrett is out the door.  Shit.  


      -- FRANK DORAN, who comes storming out of the bedroom:

                                  DORAN
                    Where do you think you're going, 
                    Jaycee?  Get your ass back in here!  
                    You hear me?

      He looks to the half-open door.  It's quiet out there.  Maybe 
      too quiet.  Paranoia takes over.  Something's not right.

                                  DORAN (CONT D)
                    Jaycee -- ?

      No response.  Doran sees shadows out there.  Oh shit.  
      Quickly moves across the room, pulls a CAR-15 ASSAULT RIFLE 
      from under a couch.  Flips the safety selector to  Auto  --


      Doran SQUEEZES A WILD BURST at the first thing that comes 
      through the door -- and it s JAYCEE.  She s cut down.  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 30.


      -- Comes in full stride.  Place is empty.  Under renovation. 
      TRACK McGarrett and Doran as they duck and move through a 
      maze of tools and supplies -- trading fire.  McGarrett dodges 
      a barrage as he RUNS OUT OF BULLETS.  Gun CLICKING crazily on 
      empty.  Shit.  He scrambles -- loses Doran -- takes cover in 
      a side room.  Trapped now.  Trying not to breathe -- face 
      streaked with sweat -- eyes constantly moving -- searching.  

      Doran stalks McGarrett.  Dumps an empty clip.  Quietly 
      reloads.  Getting warmer.  McGarrett needs a weapon -- 
      something -- anything.  He lands on tools and supplies left 
      behind.  A plan is forming: he unscrews a LIGHT BULB -- fast -
      - quietly CRUSHES IT -- sprinkles the glass around the 
      perimeter.  Next, he grabs a box of NAIL GUN LOADS.  Removes 
      one.  Moves to a dolly.  Pulls off a wheel, empties the ball 
      bearings into his hand.  

      Now he hears -- CRUNCH!  CRUNCH!  It's Doran approaching.  
      McGarrett QUICKLY affixes the bearing to the tip of the load 
      with electrical tape -- JAMS the make-shift round into the 
      chamber of his gun: HE'S JUST QUICK-BUILT A BULLET OUT OF 
      NAIL GUN CHARGE AND BALL BEARING. 

      And JUST IN TIME as Doran WHEELS around the corner and 
      McGarrett FIRES!  BLAM!  Doran SLAMS into the wall -- belly 
      leaking blood -- still doesn t stop him from moving -- 


      WHIP PAN TO McGARRETT, alone, searching for clues, connecting 
      Doran to Hesse.  He HEARS a noise coming from the bedroom 
      closet.  Two deadbolts on the door. McGarrett draws his Sig, 
      cautiously unlocks the door -- finds a terrified 14-YEAR-OLD 
      GIRL crouched in the dark.  Chinese refugee turned sex slave.   
      She flinches, recoiling, a wounded animal protecting itself -- 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    It's okay...  I'm not gonna hurt 
                    you...

      He kneels.  Regards her tenderly.  The fresh track marks on 
      her arms, soiled clothes hanging off her starved frame.

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)
                    What's your name?

                            head, he tries MANDARIN)
                    What's your name?

      She finally speaks, her mouth dry, words barely a whisper:

                                  GIRL
                    ... Chen-chi...

                                  MCGARRETT
                    I said I m sorry.  Sincerely.  
                          (Danny looks at him)
                    That s what I wanted to tell you.  
                    Last year.  When this conversation 
                    first started.    H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 34.

      There s a pause.  Danny straightens his tie:

                                  DANNY
                    Your apology is noted.  Acceptance 
                    is pending.  

      He says this with a straight face -- but there s a little 
      glint in his eye.  

                                  MCGARRETT
                    You ll let me know.

      And finally, despite himself, Danny sort of SMIRKS.  The ice 
      is breaking...

                                  DANNY
                    That girl you found... how old was 
                    she?

                                  MCGARRETT
                      Thirteen... fourteen... 

      DANNY -- ANGRY as this hits home, regains a sense of purpose.     

                                  DANNY
                    How s she connect to Hesse? 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    He made a lot of money in the human 
                      trafficking business, so he s got 
                    ties to the world.  Which means he 
                    could ve used those connections to 
                    smuggle himself into Hawaii.  

                                  DANNY 
                    You re talking organized crime on a 
                    federal level -- 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Governor gave us her umbrella -- if 
                    this thing goes Federal, it s still 
                    our case.                       

                                  DANNY
                    Even if we do find out who let 
                    Hesse in through the back door, if 
                    they re local, no one in that 
                    world s going to help two guys that 
                    look like you and me. 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    I think I know someone they might 
                    talk to...


      ON CHIN HO KELLY, in full blown interrogation mode:

                                  CHIN
                    Let's cut to the chase: you and I 
                    both know what went down here --  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 35.

      REVERSE TO REVEAL a very scared 8-year old BOY.  A souvenir 
      USS ARIZONA snow globe on the table between them:

                                  CHIN (CONT D)
                    You saw that snow globe and had to 
                    have it, so you went for the five 
                    finger discount.  I want the truth.

      He waits for a response.  And the kid bursts out in TEARS:

                                  CHIN (CONT D)
                    Kid, just-- stop crying -- hey -- 
                    take the globe -- just-- 

      A KNOCK on the door.  He answers: surprised to see McGarrett 
      and Danny, who see the kid crying:

                                  MCGARRETT
                    We interrupting?


      The three of them at a table.  Chin looks up from a photo of 
      Chen-Chi on McGarrett's cell phone, troubled. 

                                  CHIN
                    -- where d you find her? 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Locked in a house.               
                         (then, affected)             
                    She came here to start a new life.  
                    They drugged her and turned her 
                    into a prostitute...  

      Chin turns to McGarrett -- sees something unexpected.  Grins. 

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)
                    What -- ?

                                  CHIN
                    You sound just like your father.  

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Then help me.  You said you wanted 
                    to.  Here s your chance.                 
                          (shows photo of Hesse)                     
                    Guy I'm looking for s high profile: 
                    Victor Hesse.  FBI.  CIA.  
                    Interpol.  He's on everyone's 
                    radar, which means he 
                    didn't just land here and get his 
                    passport stamped.  He was back- 
                    channeled in.   H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 36.

                                  CHIN
                    And you think the same network that 
                    brought this girl to the island, 
                    smuggled Hesse in? 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    He made a fortune trafficking kids 
                    out of Malaysia -- 

                                  CHIN
                    Then you're looking for a 
                      Snakehead.  Local Chinese gangs 
                    that specialize in human smuggling. 

                                  DANNY 
                    We need a name. 

                                  CHIN
                    Are you kidding?  Look at me.  I'm 
                    a rubber gun now.

                                  DANNY
                    You were a cop here for twenty 
                    years. 

      Chin exhales a heavy SIGH, thinking...

                                  CHIN
                    I do know a guy who's got ties to 
                    that world, but--

                                  MCGARRETT
                    -- get us an introduction --

                                  CHIN
                    -- forget it.  He's a former 
                      Confidential Informant.  Trusts no 
                    one.  Especially Haoles.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Then you talk to him.

      Chin saw this coming.  We sense deep wounds somehow opening -- 

                                  CHIN
                    I'm busy.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    You expecting a crime wave in the 
                    gift shop this afternoon?

                                  CHIN
                    Forget it.  I can t be a cop 
                    anymore. 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Why not?

      Chin turns -- HARD -- and a little too LOUD:  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 37.

                                  CHIN
                    Because I can t be, you understand?  
                    HPD accused me of taking payoffs -- 
                    I m the last person the department 
                    wants to see wearing a badge.
                          (then, sees a few people 
                            staring)
                    I have to go.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Did you take the money?

                                  CHIN
                    What?

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Did you.  Take.  The money.

                                  CHIN
                    No.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Then come with us, and we don't 
                    need to talk about this again.  
                    Ever.  This is your ticket back in 
                    the game.  Call it payback.  Call 
                    it whatever.  But I need you.

      McGarrett won t let this go.  And Chin knows it.  

                                  CHIN
                    How do you know you can trust me?

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Because my father did.

      This lands.  For Chin, it's a prayer answered -- the second 
      chance he never thought would come.  Off Chin, GALVANIZED: 


      Chin greets KAMEKONA, Ex-con turned Shaved Ice King, wearing 
      an XXL Pro Bowl t-shirt.  They grip hands and hug as 
      McGarrett and Danny watch -- 

                                  CHIN
                    What flavor s good today?

                                  KAMEKONA
                    Lilikoi, Lychee, Cotton Candy -- 

                                  CHIN 
                    How bout a name?

                                  KAMEKONA
                          (wary glance at the guys)
                    They wait outside.  After they pay.

      Chin looks at his  partners :  Pony up.   They do --   H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 38.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    I ll take Cotton Candy.

                                  DANNY
                    Plain.

                                  KAMEKONA
                    Two cones and two t-shirts to go.

      Kamekona holds up a t-shirt with HIS OWN SMILING MUG on it.  
      Chin's look says: "buy it now."

                                  MCGARRETT
                    ... okay.  Medium.  

                                  KAMEKONA
                    Only comes in XL, Brah.  My face 
                    don't fit on anything smaller. 

      McGarrett shells out a fifty.  Kamekona shakes his head: 
       more.   McGarrett looks to Chin, who holds out 5 FINGERS. 
      Jesus.  McGarrett pulls out 4 hundred dollar bills, hands 
      them over.  Kamekona pockets them, hands over the shirts:

                                  KAMEKONA (CONT D)
                    Cool.  One more thing I need you 
                    two fine gentlemen to do... 


      CLOSE on a computer screen -- surveillance photo of island 
      crime lord SANG MIN (42):

                                  CHIN
                    Sang Min.  Came here from China 
                    about eight years ago.  Wife s 
                      originally from Rwanda.  Also here 
                    illegally --  

      And we POP WIDE to reveal McGarrett, Danny and Chin in Task 
      Force HQ.  Raw space in a palatial suite.  A couple desks.  A 
      computer.  Phone.  Hang tight folks, it'll get there.

                                  CHIN (CONT D)
                    -- they have one child.  A 7-year-
                    old boy.  And according to my man 
                    Kamekona, Sang Min runs the 
                    island's human import export 
                    business.

                                  DANNY
                    Even if Sang Min's for real, he's 
                    got no reason to tell us where 
                    Hesse is.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Then we motivate him.  

                                  DANNY
                    Forget it.  Coercion won t hold up 
                    in court. 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    I m saying we find some leverage, 
                    use it to twist his arm.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Simple bait and trap with an 
                      undercover we wire up.

                                  CHIN
                    Only one problem, keiki.  That 
                    might work well on the mainland, 
                    but we're on an island with less 
                    than a million people.  Which means 
                    the bad guys know the good guys, so 
                    we need to look for our bait 
                    outside the box.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    I take it you have the perfect guy 
                    in mind.

                                  CHIN
                          (a grin)
                    Oh yeah.


      CLOSE ON THE  CHAMP  BOX, as McGarrett OPENS it.  Removes the 
      KEY.  JUMP CUTS: McGarrett tries the key on EVERY LOCK IN THE 
      HOUSE -- doors -- boxes -- NOTHING.  Our cuts end on 
      McGarrett in his father s STUDY, at a loss...

      Then.  He notices a LOCK on his father s DESK DRAWER.  Slips 
      the key in: BINGO.  It OPENS and he starts sifting through 
      the contents -- nothing of significance in here.  But 
      McGarrett knows his father -- feels around for a hidden 
      compartment -- finds it -- removes a large MANILA ENVELOPE. 

      Dumps the contents onto the desk: A USED OPERA TICKET with a 
      YAKUZA MON CREST sketched on the back, a dusty old FLOPPY 
      DISK, POSTCARDS marked  Osaka, Japan  with a series of hand 
      drawn STICK FIGURE DANCING MEN (ciphers for letters).  

      ON McGARRETT.  Reeling.  What is all this?  

      Then, an EMAIL PING from his laptop.  He checks the sender: 
             rollinsc@navcentcom.navy.mil   Clicks it.  The email reads: 

      Clicks the ATTACHMENT: A CIA FILE WITH A PHOTO OF JOVAN 
      ELTSIN, matching McGarrett s print to the same one on the CIA 
      database.  McGarrett scans -- processing DETAILS on the file  
      -- then, a KNOCK at the door.  McGarrett looks through... 
      DANNY.  Opens it:

                                  DANNY
                    -- got the surveillance equipment 
                    you asked for.  You hear from Chin?

                    Not yet.  
                          (the laptop photo)
                    Recognize this guy?   

                                  DANNY
                    No.  Who is he?

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Jovan Elstin.  File says he used to 
                    work for the Russians as a computer 
                      programmer in SVR, the equivalent 
                    of our CIA.  He was here when my 
                    father was murdered. I found his 
                    palm prints and partial boot print 
                    in the kitchen.   H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 43.

                    How d you know they didn t belong 
                    to the guy who killed your father? 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Hesse wears size eleven, like me, 
                    except double E.  The one I found 
                    was smaller, and Hesse gets his 
                    footwear custom made.  Direct 
                    injected polyurethane midsole with 
                    a nitrile rubber outsole.  This 
                    print was made from a Terra Steel 
                    Toe EH GoreTex boot, footwear of 
                    choice for a lot of mercenaries in 
                    Eastern Europe.

      Jesus.  Danny can t help but be impressed: this guy is good. 

                                  DANNY
                    ... well I could ve told you that.
                          (then; opens the fridge)
                    Need a beer.  

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Don t touch that, it s evidence -- 
                    this is still a crime scene. 

      He says that MOCKINGLY.  The ice is thawing between these 
      two.  Danny tosses him a beer -- McGarrett heads outside to:


      After hours.  Chin and Kamekona.

                                  CHIN
                    Sang Min bought the pitch.  Kono 
                    sees him 9:00am.  Tomorrow.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Good work.


      FIND McGarrett, Danny and Chin looking over a map of Sang 
      Min's trucking facility.  Kono exits the next room, wearing a 
      well-worn dress.  Hair tied back.  Playing the role of poor 
      immigrant.  She s AMPED, feeling the adrenaline rush of her 
      first real job:

                                  KONO
                    How do I look?

                                  DANNY
                    ... great.

      Chin throws him a look.  Danny feigns innocent:  What?  

                                  MCGARRETT
                          (approaches Kono)
                    This crew s our only link to Victor 
                    Hesse.  Sang Min, the producer, you 
                    get him to talk, illuminate the 
                    network, we ll indict and use him 
                    to catch our fish.

                          (big grin)
                    Let s do this.

      Now Chin moves CLOSER -- right up in her grill --

                                  CHIN
                    Stop smiling.  

      Instantly, she DOES.  Caught off guard -- 

                                  CHIN (CONT D)
                    This isn t an academy training 
                    exercise, these guys aren t 
                    tourists you can punch in the nose  
                    -- they kill for recreation.  One 
                    more body on the pile means 
                    nothing.  If you move wrong in 
                    there, and I mean one inch, your 
                    ass is smoked.  So this is all on 
                    you, girl.

                                  KONO
                          (chastened, quietly)
                    ... I got it.

      Chin stares...   H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 46.

                    You ll do good.  

      Uncle and Niece lock eyes: she s a tough girl, and 
      appreciates what he s doing here -- getting her ready.


      Two large SAMOAN MEN stop and frisk her at the door.

                                  KONO
                    I'm here to see Sang Min.


      McGarrett, Danny and Chin crammed in.  Quiet, intense 
      activity.  They use a military grade Audio Surveillance 
      System to monitor the room.  Sound wave vibrations are 
      transmitted and played over a speaker system.  A THERMAL 
      IMAGE of the office appears on a monitor.  Players appear as 
      four WHITE HOT SPOTS.  


      The Samoans escort Kono into the room.  Behind his desk is 
      SANG MIN, fat and deeply-tanned.  He takes his time looking 
      up from paperwork, and when he does, he likes what he sees.

                                  SANG MIN
                    My friend says you need my help.

                                  KONO
                    I have an aunt and uncle in 
                      Nanjing... they would very much 
                    like to live here.  

                                  SANG MIN
                    I can have your family here within 
                    a week.  Getting them out of China 
                    is easy.  Paying for it is the hard 
                    part.

                                  KONO
                    I have money.

      Sang Min smiles.  Rises.  Approaches Kono.  


      They see this on the thermal.  Danny tenses.

                                  SANG MIN S VOICE
                    What I require is a significant 
                    amount of money. Do you mind if I 
                    ask what you do?  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 47.




                                  KONO
                    I work at the cannery on Pacific.  
                    And weekends as a housekeeper at 
                    the Royal Hawaiian.

                                  SANG MIN
                    Two jobs.  Very commendable.  Only 
                    I'm afraid the kind of money we're 
                    talking about might be out of your 
                    reach.

      He leans forward.  Runs his hand through her hair.

                                  SANG MIN (CONT D)
                    Unless of course we find some other 
                    form of payment --

      He suddenly reacts to something.  Removes his hand from her 
      hair.  Feels something between his fingers...

                                  SANG MIN (CONT D)
                    Sand.  What kind of person working 
                    two jobs has time to go to the 
                    beach?

      It gets tense real fast. 


                                  DANNY
                    Pull the plug. 

                                  CHIN
                    Relax.  The kid can handle herself.


                                  KONO
                    The Royal Hawaiian is on the beach. 
                    And I surf during my lunch hour.

      Sang Min holds her look:  

                                  SANG MIN
                    Or maybe you re a cop.  Did anyone 
                    check her for a wire?

                    When she came in.

                                  SANG MIN
                    Maybe you missed it.
                          (dark, to Kono)
                    Get up.  Take off your dress so I 
                    know you re not wearing a wire.    
                    Prove to me you're not a cop.  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 48.


      Frozen moment.  Everyone waiting.  How's Kono going to play 
      it?  FAVOR CHIN, now visibly unnerved.  On the thermal we see 
      her lift her hands over her head.


      Kono's dress hits the floor.  And she's now standing before 
      them in only her bra and panties.  Sang Min rises.

                                  SANG MIN (CONT D)
                    Turn around.
                          (Kono hesitates)
                    I said turn around...

      She does.  Nothing but bronzed skin and cotton.  Sang Min 
      circles her.  No wires.  She can feel him behind her.  His 
      breath on her neck.  His eyes narrow on a nasty reef scar.  
      He says something in Mandarin.


                                  DANNY
                    What did he say?

                                  MCGARRETT
                    He asked how long she's been 
                    surfing.


                                  KONO
                          (in Mandarin, SUBTITLED)
                    Fifteen years.  Ever since I came 
                    to the United States.

                                  SANG MIN
                    You need to do a better job 
                    avoiding the reefs.  A person can 
                    lose their life playing in 
                    dangerous waters.

      He lets the threat hang there.  Kono holds his stare.

                                  KONO
                    I'd like to put my dress back on 
                    now.

      Sang Min gestures; do it.  Returns to his desk.  As Kono 
      dresses -- Sang Min brings up his iPhone and SNAPS a photo:

                                  KONO (CONT D)
                    What are you doing?

                                  SANG MIN
                    I'm going to send this photo to a 
                    friend of mine.  And he's going to 
                    show it to his friends.  If anyone 
                      recognizes you, you're dead.

      He hits SEND.   And the mood goes from tense to lethal.   H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 49.

                    Take a seat.  You're not going 
                    anywhere until I hear back.

      He stabs a button on his desk -- triggering the front gate to 
      CLOSE -- unfortunately our heroes are on the other side --




      The audio surveillance starts to go STATIC -- in and out --

                    We got wires on his phone. Trace 
                    the call.

      Danny works a laptop.  Triangulates the call.  Reads screen:

                                  DANNY
                    It's a mobile number.  Unlisted...

                                  MCGARRETT

      -- And Sang Min ANSWERS ---

                                  SANG MIN
                    Hello -- 

      But before the conversation can happen -- THE SURVEILLANCE 
      VAN EXPLODES THROUGH THE FRONT GATE!  Shit goes flying -- 
      McGarrett stomps on the brakes -- the three exit and crash 
      through the front door, where they find the Samoans on their 
      asses, Sang Min with his hands in the air -- and Kono with 
      one of their guns in her hand.  Holy shit.  This girl is 
      good.  Only... what she doesn't know is that Sang Min has his 
      eyes on a .45 he has stashed under his desk  -- Kono looks 
      back to our heroes, breathless -- 

                                  KONO
                    Did you get it?

                                  MCGARRETT
                    We got it.

      DING!  Sang Min's iPhone CHIRPS.  Kono picks it up.  Reacts.  
      Hands it to McGarrett.  It reads: "SHE'S A COP."

      -- That's when Sang Min pulls the .45 from under his desk --

      -- Sang Min OPENS FIRE.  Chin throws Danny to the ground, 
      saves his life -- McGarrett and Kono duck for cover -- Sang 
      Min empties the clip and escapes through a back door.  
      McGarrett is first after him.  As Chin gets to his feet --

                    This is the part of the job I did 
                    not miss.


      Sang Min, wearing flex-cuffs, sits across from Chin.  Photos 
      of Hesse and Elstin between them.  A laptop plays back a 
      recording of Sang Min and Kono's meeting:

                      collecting, I'm going to find that 
                    little hottie you sent in here and 
                    this time, I'm going to be less of 
                      a gentleman.

      Chin takes a heavy ashtray off the table and SLAM! -- HITS 
      Sang Min with it.  Draws blood.  McGarrett enters.

                                  CHIN
                    Sorry, boss.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    I didn't see anything.

                                  SANG MIN
                      Sonofabitch hit me!!

                                  MCGARRETT
                    If you want to file a report, 
                    you're going to need a witness.  Do 
                    you want to file a report?

                                  SANG MIN
                    Yes!

      Chin HITS Sang Min with the ashtray again.  Fuck, it hurts.

                                  MCGARRETT
                          ( oblivious )
                    My eyesight must be going -- 

                                  SANG MIN
                    I wanna go to jail now.  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 52.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    We're not done yet.

      He rises.  Chin pushes him back into the chair.  McGarrett 
      holds up the photo of Hesse.

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)
                    Where is he?

      Sang Min stares back, defiant, bloody.  McGarrett places two 
      photos on the table: Sang Min's wife and son.

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)
                    How about these two?  Do you know 
                    where they are?

      Sang Min is silent.   Fuck you. 

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)
                    Listen to me very carefully.  Right 
                    now, your wife s getting her nails 
                    done on Kalakaua avenue; your boy s 
                    at his private school in Diamond 
                    Head.  I wonder what he ll think 
                    when he finds out his father takes 
                    children just like him and puts 
                    them on the streets to be pumped
                    full of black tar heroin, then sold 
                    to strangers like animals.  

      Still, Sang Min is stone.  Cold stare.

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)
                    You re going to jail, that s not up 
                    for negotiation.  Your family s 
                    about to lose a husband and father  
                    -- in my eyes, now they re your 
                    victims too.  Trouble is, the law 
                    doesn t see it that way since you 
                    all came here illegally.  Your 
                    wife s from Rwanda, she ll be sent 
                    back -- they both will.  If they're 
                    lucky, they'll make it to a refugee 
                    camp.  And your son -- seven s old 
                    enough to carry a gun for the Hutu 
                    Militia.  I can prevent all that... 
                    but I don t help people who don t 
                    help me.

      Sang Min looks to Chin, then back to McGarrett -- and we see 
      it now: he s SCARED.  

                                  SANG MIN
                    What kind of cops are you?

                                  MCGARRETT
                    The new kind. 


      McGarrett and Danny -- totally on it -- pedal down -- blowing 
      past light traffic.  Up ahead -- the Nimitz Highway -- 

                                  GOVERNOR JAMESON (OVER PHONE)
                    You want a helicopter to do what? 



      Governor Jameson, on the phone --

                                  MCGARRETT
                    -- you promised me  immunity and 
                    means  -- 

                                  GOVERNOR JAMESON
                    -- not to provoke a diplomatic 
                    incident by boarding a Chinese 
                    freighter in international waters --
                    even if I get support from the 
                    State department, I don t have a 
                    lot of pull with the People s 
                    Republic of China --

                                  MCGARRETT
                    -- if they re caught smuggling a 
                      terrorist, trust me, the People s 
                    Republic won t say a word.  I did 
                    my job, Governor, I found Hesse, 
                    now do yours: get me in the air!

      He hangs up, accelerates forward as we SMASH CUT TO: 


      HESSE -- urgent -- on a wall phone.  ELTSIN behind him.

                                  HESSE
                    They ll try and board us. 


      TIGHT: The CAPTAIN. On the phone -- 

                                  HESSE  (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Whatever happens, do not stop this 
                    ship.  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 57.


      The Captain, watching from the Pilothouse window, suddenly 
      feels cold steel pressed against the side of his head.  It s:

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    Stop the ship now.


      Outside a MAMMOTH WINDOW is a stunning view of the ocean. 
      DOLLY PAST WORKERS filling the space with equipment.  INTO 
      FRAME comes McGarrett, on crutches.  Slowly, we TRACK AROUND 
      to face him in CLOSE UP: his eyes.  New beginnings.  He sees 
      Danny unloading boxes at a desk... hobbles over...

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)
                    We get a trace on the call Sang Min 
                    made to the precinct?

                                  DANNY
                    No.  Whoever it is is using a VOIP 
                    number.  The trace ends at the 
                    server.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    We got us a mole to find.  

    A beat.  McGarrett drops a HOTEL KEY HOLDER on Danny s desk:

                                  DANNY
                    What s that?

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Three nights at the Kahala Hotel. 
                          (Danny stares: surprised)
                    Look, I know you re gonna say no -- 

                                  DANNY
                    Yes.  I m gonna say no.  What is it 
                    with you and my living 
                      arrangements? 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Grace is coming over this weekend, 
                    right?  I hear this place has a 
                    pool and you can swim with the 
                    dolphins. 
                          (then)
                    Just take it. 

      Long beat.  Finally, Danny does.  Genuinely touched:

                                  DANNY
                    ... thank you.  

      McGarrett GRINS.  No way around it: they dig each other.  

                                  KONO (V.O.)
                      Seriously, guys, this group needs a 
                    name.  Something cool --   H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 62.


      It s LATER, a glorious red SUNSET -- the place is empty now, 
      only McGARRETT, DANNY, CHIN and KONO -- sitting around a 
      table sharing celebratory BEERS -- and slowly, we DOLLY 
      AROUND THEM -- LAUGHING -- a sense of improv, of fun -- a 
      sense, above all, they ll make one helluva team:

                                  CHIN
                    How about: A'ohe hana nui ka  
                    alu'ia -- it means:  No task is too 
                    big when done together.  

                                  KONO
                    I was thinking more like "Strike 
                    Force."  Or "Hawaii Special 
                    Police." 
                          (their looks: no)
                    "Hawaii Vice?" 

                                  DANNY
                    Slow down, girl, you ain t even 
                    graduated yet -- 

                                  KONO
                    -- next week -- 

                                  MCGARRETT
                    Then it s off to Turtle Bay: drunk 
                    tourists, golf cart accidents -- 

                                  CHIN
                    -- how about "IIU." 
                          (Kono s face: huh?)
                     Island Investigation Unit." 
                          (Kono waves it off)
                    C mon, you got something better?  

      McGarrett has NOTICED something on the wall: a map of the 
      Hawaiian islands with every state numbered.  He stands, 
      ambles over... remembering something... they all watch him 
      looking at the wall... 

                                  CHIN (CONT D)
                    ... Boss?

                                  MCGARRETT
                          (beat; very quietly)
                    Five-0.  

                                  DANNY
                    What d he say?

                                  KONO
                    Five-O?  H5-0 - Revised Network Draft 1-12-10 63.

                                  MCGARRETT
                    It s what my father used to call 
                    our family because we weren t 
                    native Hawaiians. It was his way of 
                    making us feel like we belonged 
                      someplace.  

      That LANDS on everyone.  They feel it too: a sense of 
        belonging... together.  McGarrett steps closer to the map...

                                  MCGARRETT (CONT D)
                    See?  That s us.  Hawaii.  Five-0. 

      We PUSH INTO THE MAP, the promise of more adventures to come: 


      McGarrett closes the old "Champ" toolbox.  Sets it down.  
      Pulls the tarp off the Mercury Broughman.  Cracks the hood.  
      Assesses the work.  Grabs a wrench.  MATCH TO:    

      The same tool in the hands of six-year old STEVE McGARRETT -- 
      as it's handed off to his father --  

      RESUME McGARRETT.  He gets to work -- under the hood -- his 
      way of honoring dad.  Our first real moment of peace... IS 
      ABRUPTLY INTERRUPTED BY THE PRELAP OF SCREAMING SIRENS:


      -- Marches through the lobby -- attracting stares -- this 
      waterlogged monster -- leaving puddles in his wake --
