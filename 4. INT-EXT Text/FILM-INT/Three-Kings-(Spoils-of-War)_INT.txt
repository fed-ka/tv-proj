It's filled with young soldiers messing around, playing
cards, listening to music, whatever.
Jaeger lays on a bunk
holding the puzzle box, probing it with his fingers, trying
to find a way to make it open.
Wes crosses over.
WES
You get it yet?
JAEGER
Naw, nothing.
WES
You will.
You'll get it.
JAEGER
I'll show Epps.
He'll be sorry when I
get this thing open.
WES
You really think there's a treasure
inside?
JAEGER
I don't care if there's a lump of coal in
here.
I just want to be able to rub
Epps' face in it when I crack this thing.
Wes watches Jaeger work the box for a beat.
WES
Jaeger?
JAEGER
What?
WES
You know the fifteenth is the deadline
for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
JAEGER
Yeah.
So?
WES
That's in two days.
JAEGER
Like I said; so?
WES
They're cancelling all leaves, all
passes.
No more drills.
We stand at
full ready starting--
JAEGER
What's your point, Wes?
You have a
point?
WES
We're going to war, aren't we.
If
they're doing all that it must mean we're
going to war.
JAEGER
It doesn't mean anything.
WES
Why would they do all that if we weren't?
Jaeger, frustrated, finally looks up from his box.
JAEGER
Okay, so we're going to war.
We're
supposed to go to war.
We're soldiers,
that's what we do.
The guns, the tanks,
the planes; you're just now getting the
hint we're in the war business?
Jaeger goes back to his box.
Wes stands over him for a beat
longer, then:
WES
Jaeger?
JAEGER
(For sure aggravated)
What!?
WES
You ever think about dying?
JAEGER
Come on, man.
I almost had this thing open.
WES
You ever think about it?
You ever worry?
JAEGER
The only thing I worry about is how much
Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick
before this whole thing is over.
The
only people who I've got anything to worry
about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys
who don't know enough to get out of the
way when I come rolling at them; an M-16
in each hand, and a grenade between my
teeth.
Now if you'll excuse me, soldier,
I'd like to get back to my box.
I've got
a treasure to find.
Wes lingers over Jaeger for a few more beats, then walks off as we:

FADE TO:

FADE TO:
The room is filled with maps, recon photos, HUMINT reports.
They're posted on the walls with various levels of troop
strength - allied and Iraqi - indicated.
More data is
constantly flowing in, analyzed and processed.
Jaeger enters, spots WOODS - a young soldier on intel detail
- and crosses over to him.
JAEGER
Woods.
WOODS
Hey, Jaeger.
What's up.
JAEGER
I'm looking for a favor.
I need a map of
Iraqi.
WOODS
A map?
All I got is maps.
I'm gonna
have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally
get out of here.
What kind of map you
need?
Topographical, geographical,
thermal?
JAGER
I don't know.
A map map.
WOODS
A map map.
Woods pulls out a map and hands it to Jaeger.
WOODS(CONT)
That shouldn't be too hard to read.
Iraq
is the pink thing.
JAEGER
I could use some recon photos too.
Woods gives Jaeger a sideways glance.
WOODS
Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
JAEGER
Just...want to be ready when we do.
WOODS
Ready for what?
Sight-seeing?
JAEGER
The photos.
Woods starts to dig for photos.
JAEGER(CONT)
Some good ones.
WOODS
They're all good ones.
Satellites we've
got can snap a shot of the boil on
Saddam's ass.
JAEGER
Saddam's got a boil on his ass?
Woods looks up at Jaeger with an expression that says:
"What?"
JAEGER(CONT)
I don't know.
Woods goes back to looking, pulls some photos and hands them
to Jaeger.
JAEGER(CONT)
Thanks, man.
Appreciate it.
Staring at the pictures like they held the secrets of the
ages Jaeger starts to exit.
Woods mumbles after him:
WOODS
Yeah.
You figure out how to win the war
be sure to let us know.
CUT TO:
Maps and photos cover Jaeger's bunk the way autumn leaves
cover the ground.
He swings between studying the maps, and
reading from a book titled A History Of The Ottoman Empire.
Jaeger puts the book down, then slides the drawing from the
puzzle box up next to one of the recon photos.
He looks at
the mosaic he's put together, looks at it like it was having
a dialogue with him.
Dig it:
It is talking.
A voice only
Jaeger can hear.
Right now it's just a little whisper, but
the voice is getting louder.
A crossing SOLDIER, carrying a football, calls to Jaeger.
SOLDIER
Come on, Jaeger.
We're playing ball.
Jaeger fairly jumps as he comes out of his trance.
JAEGER
No that's okay.
I'm gonna...I'm doing some...
The soldier crosses off.
Jaeger goes back to staring at his
maps, and photos and drawings and books.
"What were you
saying?"
As it all keeps talking to him we:

FADE TO:
BLACK
FADE TO:
The lantern punches a hole through the darkness as Epps uses
it like a machete to blaze a trial.
He sinks down...down
until finally they touch bottom.
He unclips himself from the
rope and Jaeger starts down.
The space isn't that big, like a small cave really.
It's
tight enough that the lantern pretty well lights up the whole
of it.
But it's big enough that one wouldn't have any idea
where to start digging.
Jaeger makes it to the bottom.
Wes yells down.
WES
You down?
JAEGER
Yeah, we're down.
WES
What do you see?
EPPS
Nothing.
More to himself:
EPPS(CONT)
A whole lot of nothing.
JAEGER
So where do we start?
Epps takes a look around, then shrugs.
EPPS
Wherever you want.
Epps breaks out his utility shovel from his pack.
Jaeger
follows suit.
He looks around, picks a spot and starts
digging.
FADE TO:
WES - LATER
He sits up top, weapon in hand, standing guard.
FADE TO:
EPPS AND JAEGER - LATER
They dig furiously at sperate ends of the cave.
They dig
with a determination to find something.
FADE TO:
WES - LATER
Still up top, he's given up on standing guard.
Now he
stretches out on the ground sunning himself.
FADE TO:
EPPS AND JAEGER
Their shirts are off, and they're caked with sweat and dirt.
They look like they've been digging for quite some time.
They certainly don't have the same enthusiasm they displayed
previously.
Now they just seem to dig by rote.
FADE TO:
WES - LATER
The sun has begun to sink noticeably.
Wes leans over the
crevice.
WES
Hey...Hey!
Sun's going down.
Epps!
Jaeger!
It's getting dark up here.
CUT TO:
EPPS AND JAEGER - SIMULTANEOUS
It's obvious these guys have been digging for hours and come
up with nothing.
Epps keeps digging, but just barely.
Jaeger doesn't even bother anymore.
He just sits on the
ground sulking.
WES(O.C.)
Epps!
EPPS
I heard!
CUT TO:
WES
He rolls over and scoffs.
WES
There's nothing down there.
CUT TO:
EPPS AND JAEGER
Epps notices Jaeger just sitting there.
EPPS
What are you doing?
JAEGER
What does it look like I'm doing?
EPPS
It looks like you're not doing anything.
JAEGER
I'm not.
And I'm not doing anything,
because there's nothing down here.
EPPS
Get up and dig.
JAEGER
We've been digging.
We've been digging
for hours.
If there was anything here to
find we would have found it.
EPPS
Get up off your ass and dig!
Sounding defeated as all hell, and very whiney:
JAEGER
What's the point?
There's nothing here.
The map's a fake.
Christ, even I see
that now.
We're just wasting our time.
We might as well give up and--
Epps spins.
Like a bolt of lightning he's on Jaeger,
grabbing him up and pulling him close.
EPPS
You listen to me.
The whole reason we're
here is because of you and that map of
yours.
I didn't do all this for nothing,
and I'm not leaving with nothing.
If you
think for a second I'm giving up just
'cause you're too tired to turn over some
dirt, then you don't know John Epps too
well, do you?
So you dig, and you keep
on digging 'til I say you don't have to
dig anymore.
Epps pushes Jaeger back and he goes down to the ground hard.
A fire burns inside him.
A fire that burns out of control.
Before he even knows what he's doing Jaeger springs to his
feet, shovel in hand, bringing it down in a long arc for
Epps' head.
Epps bears him coming.
He deftly side steps the blow, grabs
hold of Jaeger and forces him down.
They roll around
violently like wild dogs trading blows and trying to work the
other into a choke hold.
CUT TO:
WES
He can hear the sounds of the struggle and yells down.
WES
What are you doing...?
What the hell are
you doing down there?
CUT TO:
EPPS AND JAEGER
They fight on; down and dirty.
Locked together they roll
around the ground, each trying to get the upper hand.
They
smash into the lantern, sending the cave into near darkness.
At the same time Epps works himself on top of Jaeger.
He
lands a couple of solid punches, takes a rock from the ground
and lifts it high ready to send it crashing into Jaeger's
skull.
All Jaeger can do is steel himself for the deathblow.
Something catches Epps' eye:
A glint of light flashes across
his faces.
He stares at it; at an opening, a bare seem
really, in the side of the cave wall where light seeps
through.
The rock slips from his hand.
Forgetting all about
Jaeger Epps goes to the opening.
Jaeger himself, as if what
just happened hadn't really happened, comes up along side
Epps.
JAEGER
Must be a compartment.
EPPS
I feel air.
Probably opens up outside
somewhere.
That's where the light comes
from.
Couldn't see it with the lanternon.
Jaeger says what they both must have guessed by now.
JAEGER
The white dot; light in the dark.
That's all Epps needs to hear.
He starts clawing at the
opening with his bare hands.
That gets him nothing.
Grabbing up a shovel he starts to whack at it.
Jaeger gets
the lantern working again, then picks up his shovel and joins
in.
They keep hitting and hitting, picking up a rhythm like
a southern chain gang.
JAEGER (CONT)
Maybe we should blast it loose with the
claymore.
EPPS
It's giving.
The rock gives way enough for Epps to pry it free.
There's
just enough space for a man to reach his arm through.
For a
beat Epps and Jaeger just stare at the opening almost afraid
of what mayor may not be in there.
With some trepidation Epps begins to move his hand towards
the opening.
Slowly it extends closer...closer...
Just as
it moves beyond the opening. vThere is a wild, screeching
hiss as some small, hairy thing leaps for Epps.
Both Epps and Jaeger recoil, Jaeger going nuts with fear.
JAEGER
Jesus Christ!
Jaeger grabs up his M-16 and takes aim at...whatever it is.
EPPS
No, don't shoot!
Too late. Jaeger squeezes off a few rounds.
A couple of
bullets hit the thing, but the rest ricochet wildly about the
cave and around Epps and Jaeger.
All the two men can do is
duck and cover - squeezing themselves into tight, fetal balls
- as the bullets scream back and forth like little chunks of
random death.
Eventually the bullets lose speed and die off.
Jaeger and
Epps raise up off the ground.
They walk to the dead thing
that jumped from the opening.
EPPS
It's just a mongoose.
JAEGER
Is it dead?
EPPS
Yeah, Bwana, you got it.
CUT TO:
WES
Yelling down
WES
What the hell are you doing!?
CUT TO:
EPPS AND JAEGER
JAEGER
I think we found something.
They go back to the opening.
Epps shines a light inside to
make sure there are no more surprises, then reaches an arm
in.
Jaeger looks on with great anticipation, licking his
lips like a hungry jackal, as Epps twists his arm in the
opening.
Searching...searching...
Epps' face freezes.
He goes perfectly still for a beat, then
slowly draws his hand from the opening.
It clutches a wooden
box.
It is similar to Jaeger's puzzle box, but slightly
bigger.
The instant Epps sets the box on the ground Jaeger
smashes his shovel into it shattering the ancient wood.
From
the splinters pours a river of gold coins.
Jaeger and Epps
are too stunned to do anything but look at it.
CUT TO:
WES
He leans over the crevice.
WES
What is it?
What'd you find?
CUT TO:
EPPS AND JAEGER
Incredulous himself:
EPPS
Gold.
It's gold.
Jaeger yells it at the top of his lungs:
JAEGER
IT'S GOLD!
CUT TO:
WES
His lips flutter a bit before they land on the word
WES
Gold...
CUT TO:
EPPS AND JAEGER
They scoop up handfuls of the coins and let them run through
their fingers.
JAEGER
It's not like I figured.
It's cold.
And
it's heavier than I imagined.
EPPS
I wouldn't know.
I never imagined this.
Not in my whole life did I ever imagine
this.
JAEGER
You don't have to imagine it.
Not
anymore.
Now all you've got to think up
is what it's going to buy you.
Epps grabs up one coin and stands.
EPPS
Wes!
With all his strength Epps gives the coin an underhanded toss
straight up.
CUT TO:
WES
Wes catches the coin.
He turns it over in his fingers.
He
smiles, and there's nothing pleasant about it.
CUT TO:
JAEGER AND EPPS
Epps yells up.
EPPS
Wes, thrown down a pack.
A beat later an empty pack comes falling down.
Epps picks it
up and takes it over to Jaeger.
The two of them start
loading the coins into it.
EPPS(CONT)
I don't think the line will take the
weight of a man and the coins.
(Yelling up.)
Wes!?
We'll send the gold up, then me
and Jaeger'll climb back.
WES(O.C.)
Ready when you are.
Epps is just about to attach the pack of gold to the line
when Jaeger grabs his arm.
JAEGER
Wait.
EPPS
What?
Jaeger isn't sure how to say what he's thinking.
EPPS(CONT)
What?
JAEGER
We send the gold up what's to stop him
from taking off and leaving us down here?
EPPS
He's not going to leave us.
JAEGER
What's to stop him if he wanted to?
All
he has to do is cut the line...
Good point.
What is to stop him?
WES
You ready?
EPPS
(To Jaeger)
All right.
I'll go up, then you send up
the gold and--
JAEGER
Why do I have to stay down here?
EPPS
Jesus, Jaeger.
JAEGER
I don't see how that plan's any better.
EPPS
Someone's got to send the gold up.
It
can't get on the line by itself.
JAGER
Why's it got to be me?
A tense moment passes.
WES
What are you doing?
You ready?
Another moment, then:
EPPS
All right.
You go up, I'll send up the
gold, then follow.
JAEGER
Yeah.
Yeah, that'll work.
Jaeger goes over to the line and hooks himself on.
He's just
about ready to climb up when Epps stops him.
Serious as a
heart attack he says:
EPPS
If you're even thinking about leaving me
down here, you better think again.
Jaeger stares at Epps for a beat, then laughs himself a
little laugh.
He yells up:
JAEGER
Wes, I'm coming up.
Jaeger starts to climb as Wes helps out by pulling on the
rope.
Epps watches him for a bit, then looks at the pack of gold
and the rest of the equipment.
Suddenly he scurries about
gathering up all the things they've brought down.
Jaeger continues his climb, disappearing up into the crevice.
A few beats later the rope comes snaking back down from,
above.
Epps brings over the pack of gold and attaches it to
the rope.
Yelling up:
EPPS
Okay!
The rope goes taught, slowly drawing the pack up, up into the
crevice finally to be swallowed from view.
Epps waits for the rope to come back down.
He waits.
He
waits a beat more.
No rope.
EPPS(CONT)
Wes?
Jaeger?
He tries to keep the apprehension from his voice, but it
creeps in anyway.
He tries it again.
EPPS(CONT)
Jaeger?
Still more nothing.
What's that sound?
It's Epps' breath
getting heavier and faster.
EPPS(CONT)
Jaeger!?
Nothing.
Then something.
The rope snakes its way back down.
Epps can't help but let go of a little laugh, like a guy
who's just been given a scare by his own shadow.
Taking up
his own pack Epps hooks up, then starts the climb to the top.
CUT TO:
JAEGER AND WES
They work the rope, helping Epps up.
He gets to the lip of
the crevice, and pulls himself over.
He's breathing hard,
and lets his pack slide to the ground.
Trying not to sound
too rattled.
EPPS
What the hell took so long.
JAEGER
Just had to get the pack unhooked from
the line.
It didn't seem that long.
EPPS
Not when you're up here with the gold, I
guess not.
Throwing Epps' own words back at him:
WES
Not losing trust, are you?
Epps lets this go.
EPPS
It'll be too dark to make our way back
now.
Let's bed down for the night and
head out at first light.
WES
What about the gold?
EPPS
What about it?
WES
Maybe we should split it up now.
EPPS
We started this together, and we're
staying together, so there's no point in
splitting things up now.
WES
What if we get separated?
Way I see it
if something happens I want to be
carrying my share.
JAEGER
Wes might be right about that.
EPPS
It stays as it is.
We're halfway home
now.
Let's not blow it by people getting
ideas.
WES
You're the one with all the ideas.
EPPS
You've had your say, Wes.
Now leave it.
WES
Maybe you've got ideas of your own for
the gold.
Maybe you've already got
things worked out.
EPPS
Maybe I do.
WES
Maybe I don't need your ideas.
Maybe I
can do better on my own.
Epps sees trouble coming, and deals with it the only way he
knows how.
Casually he turns from Wes as if he's about to
let things go.
Suddenly he spins back around throwing a
punch to Wes' jaw that sends him to the ground.
Wes puts a hand to his mouth.
It comes back stained red.
Wes goes on the boil.
WES(CONT)
You got no reason to do that!
EPPS
I told you:
When I straighten someone
out they stay straightened.
This is how
it works:
Nobody touches the gold.
Except when we're on the move and
someone's carrying it, nobody so much as
opens the pack to get an eyeful of it.
Agreed?
Jaeger wastes no time jumping in.
JAEGER
Yeah.
Sure.
That sounds like a plan to
me.
Wes, still on the ground, fumes.
WES
You got no reason to hit me.
I'm getting
tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.
EPPS
Then get up and do something about it.
Wes thinks about it, but that's all he does.
He's not ready
to cross that line yet.
EPPS(CONT)
Then just lay there and bleed.
Epps takes up his pack and moves off to bed down.
Jaeger
does the same.
Wes just lays on the ground...and bleeds.
FADE TO:
BLACK
FADE TO:
The sun has just pushed itself well above the horizon as
Jaeger comes awake.
The second he does he sees a MAN - Arab,
wearing white robes - peering through the window.
Jaeger
gives a start, and the man disappears.
Jaeger quickly shakes
Epps awake.
JAEGER
Epp...Epps!
There's someone at the
window!
This wakes Epps up quick.
EPPS
An Iraqi?
JAEGER
I don't know.
He didn't have a uniform
on.
He...he had on white robes, like the
guys who killed Wes.
Epps does some quick figuring, then staying low, scrambles
across the floor to one of the dead Iraqis and grabs up his
weapon.
He grabs another one tosses it to Jaeger.
Carefully, still low, Epps creeps over to the window.
Slowly
he raises up and looks out.
JAGER(CONT)
See anything?
EPPS
Nothing.
Epps lowers himself back down and does some thinking.
JAEGER
What do we do?
EPPS
We can't stay here.
Even if that wasn't
an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of
time before some show up.
Get all the
water you can carry, and we'll head out
on foot.
JAEGER
To where?
EPPS
Sun rises in the East.
We go the
opposite direction.
May not find
anything, but at least we'll know we're
heading towards Saudi Arabia.
As Jaeger gathers up what water he can find, creeps for
the door.
With the muzzle of his gun he pulls it open a
crack and peers out.
Still nothing.
It's like the man
vanished into thin air.
Jaeger, stocked up on water, comes over with the gold and
Epps' pack which Epps shoulders.
EPPS(CONT)
Ready?
Jaeger nods.
Epps opens the door, and the two men carefully
snake their way out weapons at the ready.
It seems, though,
there is nothing to be ready for.
There is no one around.
Suddenly the man appears from around the shack.
Epps and
Jaeger turn on him targeting with their assault weapons, but
they do not fire.
The man just stands.
He doesn't say
anything, he makes no threatening moves.
The three stay
still as statues for several beats until Epps jerks his head
indicating to Jaeger they should move on.
That they do,
weapons still on the man, until they are beyond his range.
They walk on a little ways.
Jaeger spots something, and
thrusts a finger in its direction.
JAEGER
Look!
Mounted on a horse, riding on a dune that runs parallel to
them, is ANOTHER ARAB MAN.
He makes no effort to draw nearer
to Epps and Jaeger, but nor does he lose them.
JAEGER(CONT)
What do we do?
EPPS
We keep going, that's what we do.
We
ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
As if to be contrary to Epps' statement ANOTHER TWO ARABS ON
HORSE BACK appear up over a dune before them.
JAEGER
Jesus!
How many of them are there?
Epps doesn't know, and he doesn't want to find out.
They
change direction heading away from the Arabs.
But again MORE
ARABS ride up over a dune.
Epps gets the feeling he and
Jaeger are about to be boxed in.
EPPS
I don't like this.
Let's go.
Epps breaks into a run.
Jaeger is only steps behind him.
Like something out of an old John Ford western dozens of
mounted Arabs suddenly appear over a dune.
They ride fast
and hard for Epps and Jaeger like Apaches heading for a wagon
train.
They easily overtake our two, momentarily swallowing
them amongst the thundering hoofs, and ride on a bit as if
playing with them.
Epps and Jaeger stop, then bolt in the other direction.
The
Arabs ride back, again past Epps and Jaeger swiping them to
the ground; the horses kicking up a spray of lose sand over
them.
It looks like a cattle round up, and our two are the
cattle.
Epps and Jaeger get up to make another run of it, and again
the Arabs bear down on them.
This time they mean business.
They completely surround them, cutting off all means of
escape.
The Arabs start screaming something back and forth
in Arabic.
We don't know what, but it sounds unpleasant.
Epps and Jaeger come skidding to a halt.
They turn in their
tracks digging in the scene.
It goes like this:
They are
completely outnumbered and out gunned by a mounted force.
Doesn't get any simpler.
Epps and Jaeger drop their weapons.
Their hands go in the
air.
CUT TO:
Jaeger is cleaned up, in dress uniform, and sitting at a
table before a MILITARY TRIBUNAL.
He looks very sullen, as
if this whole adventure has robbed him of his soul.
The members of the tribunal just look pissed.
CHIEF JUSTICE
The members of this tribunal have reached
a verdict.
Based on the evidence
presented we find the defended guilty as
charged of desertion, insurrection,
insubordination, and conduct unbecoming.
Further the tribunal will recommend that
the defendant be sentenced to life
imprisonment, and that from this day
forward he shall no longer walk as a free
man.
You should consider yourself quite
fortunate, son.
There was a time when
lesser crimes would have found you before
a firing squad.
I don't know that a
person like you has much to say for
himself, but it is your right say
something.
Jager doesn't stand.
He doesn't look at the tribunal.
He
just begins to talk.
JAEGER
I'm sorry, I guess.
Not for looking for
the gold, or leaving my post.
You know
what it's like to have gold raining out
of your hands?
That'll give me enough to
think about the rest of my days in the
brig.
I'm just sorry about Wes.
He was
all right.
It was the gold that made him
what he became.
If I hadn't found that
map, if I hadn't talked them into going
searching...Wes just might have made it
home after all.
I guess I feel
responsible for him.
CHIEF JUSTICE
The way I view things you're responsible
for the lives of two men:
Private First
Class Wes Hanmond, and Second Lieutenant
John Epps.
JAEGER
Yeah, well, I've been thinking about
that.
See, there was an explosion and
everything, but I never really aaw Epps
get killed.
And nobody ever found the
gold.
I guess they both could have been
burned to slag.
I guess.
But there were
a lot of bodies out on that road.
A
smart man could have found some
identification to use.
A smart man could
have made his way up to Syria or Turkey.
A smart man could have gotten himself
right out of the Middle East.
A smart
man with enough gold.
