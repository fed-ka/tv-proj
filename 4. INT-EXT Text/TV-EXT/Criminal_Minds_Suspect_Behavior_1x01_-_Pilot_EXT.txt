  Police helicopters hover above the city at night. They shine 
  their floodlights down on --


  A crime scene, deep in the park. Police lights glow. Uniform 
  cops tape off the area. Detectives COTTON and GILMORE step from 
  their car, taking in the chaos. They walk toward a body. 

  Gilmore kneels over the dead man who has been badly beaten. He 
  checks the back of his head. Cotton watches.

                                COTTON
                Well?

                              GILMORE
                We need to call the FBI. It s 
                starting again. 

  As a spotlight washes over them, illuminating the lonely scene 
  and we --

                                                                              CUT TO:


  BEN MARKS, 40, and his daughter JANE, 14, exit a building. The 
  sound of the police helicopters fills the air. They look up to 
  see the spotlights in the distance. They walk and talk. 

                              BEN
                Are you hungry? Do you want to grab 
                  something?

                              JANE
                Don t try and act like you care.

                              BEN
                I just want to know if you re 
                hungry. 

                              JANE
                No. I m not hungry. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  2.

  Ben pauses, exasperated, then continues. Behind them, we see a 
  MAN walking. He slows his pace and falls in behind them. 

                              BEN
                I m not the enemy, Jane. 

                              JANE
                Of course not. My friends are, 
                right? And David. 

                              BEN
                You re fourteen. It s too young to 
                go on dates, especially with a boy 
                who s already driving. 

                              JANE
                Mom thinks you work too much. 

                              BEN
                What does that have to do with 
                  anything?

                              JANE
                It s not my fault if you two aren t 
                getting along. 

                              BEN
                I m not saying it is.

                              JANE
                No, you re just trying to ship me 
                off. 

                              BEN
                Your mom and I love you. 

                              JANE
                Don t even. 

  On Ben. The noise and spotlights of the helicopters seem to add 
  to the father-daughter stress. A beat. 

                              BEN
                Okay. You want to be treated like 
                an adult, fine. Let s have an adult 
                  conversation... 

  When Ben notices that the man following has stopped too. 

                              BEN (CONT D) (cont d)
                Can I help you?

  The man, our UNSUB, stares at Jane. We don t see his face.

                it hurts, there can be no more 
                hurt, only more love. 


  We see the skyline, set against the water as we --

  A busy street. We move quickly until we arrive at --


  A store front. Push in, through the doors to --


  A field of green marked with a small yellow triangle of police 
  tape. Hotch and Prentiss walk with Detective Cotton.

                              HOTCH
                Who found the body?

                                COTTON
                Husband and wife. Their dog got off 
                the leash and they came this way 
                looking for him.

                              PRENTISS
                Are there usually people in the 
                park at night?

                Not after dark. Definitely not off 
                the paths. 

  They scan the area. The spot is very secluded.

                              HOTCH
                Have all the dump sites been this 
                  isolated?

                He keeps away from the jogging 
                paths. Never dumps them in lighted 
                areas.

                He d have to study the terrain 
                  beforehand. He s organized. 

                              HOTCH
                And physical enough to haul a body 
                a long way on his own. The closest 
                parking area is a good half mile 
                away. 

                              PRENTISS
                What can you tell us about the 
                victims?

                                COTTON
                Not much. They were all living on 
                the street. No witnesses. Our guess 
                is he s managed to lure them by 
                  promising food or drugs. 

                              HOTCH
                Were any reported missing?

                                COTTON
                No. But, honestly, once you re 
                living in the Tenderloin, you re as 
                good as gone already. 

                                                                              CUT TO:


  Hotch and Cooper step out of an SUV and walk to the front door. 
  They knock. LESLIE MARKS, 40, opens the door. 

                              HOTCH
                Mrs. Marks? I m Agent Hotchner. 
                This is Agent Cooper. We re with 
                the FBI. 

  As Hotch speaks, Cooper takes out his credentials. As he raises 
  them, Leslie quickly reaches to stop him.

  They step in. She nervously scans the street as --


  Prentiss and Mick exit an SUV. In the distance, we see a crime 
  scene. They walk and talk toward it. 

                              PRENTISS
                So, how does a Brit --

                              MICK
                  A handsome Brit?

                              PRENTISS
                How does a Brit end up in the FBI?

                              MICK
                I was in Her Majesty s Special 
                Forces. Cooper and I bumped into 
                each other a few times. Ten months 
                ago, they told him he could hand-
                pick a new team. He called, I came. 
                Passport didn t matter.

                              PRENTISS
                You know, there s a lot of rumors 
                about your boss. 

                              MICK
                Yeah?

                              PRENTISS
                One I heard, when he first left the 
                BAU, he was running psychological 
                ops overseas. 

                              MICK
                I ve never been big on rumors. 

                              PRENTISS
                So, I suppose you won t say just 
                where you two  bumped into each 
                other? 

  He stops. 

                              MICK
                I ll tell you I trust him with my 
                life. I ll tell you I d die for the 
                man. 

  A beat and he keeps walking. Prentiss watches him a moment then 
  catches up at the crime scene. Mick walks to the dead body. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)    CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  28.

  He pulls a photo out of his pocket. Tilts the victim s head to

  Quiet. Prentiss and Mick examine the victim. Finally --

                              MICK
                So, let s start with what s really 
                weird. The Tenderloin is full of 
                junkies who d be easy to control 
                but the first victim had no drugs 
                in his system and this geezer looks 
                pretty healthy too. You know, 
                except for the whole dead thing.

  Prentiss nods. True. Mick checks the victim s fingernails.

                              MICK (CONT D) (cont d)
                He s got skin under his nails. 
                Didn t the first victim have 
                scratch marks on his chest?




                                                                              (CONTINUED)    CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  31.

                We assumed he fought back against 
                the Unsub but the victims might 
                actually be fighting each other.

                              MICK
                Exactly. 

                              PRENTISS
                I take it you re about to wow me 
                with a theory. 

                              MICK
                The first victim is dumped before 
                the fathers and daughters are 
                taken. Why?

                              PRENTISS
                He needs to prove to the wife that 
                he means business. He has to make 
                sure she doesn t call the police. 

                              MICK
                And it also sends a message to the 
                  prisoners he already has. You lose 
                a fight, you die. It s easier to 
                control them if their aggression is 
                focused on each other...  What do 
                these welts look like to you?

                              PRENTISS
                My guess, they re wounds from 
                rubber bullets. 

                              MICK
                Like they use to control rioters or 
                prison inmates. 

                              PRENTISS
                Okay. 

                              MICK
                Go with me here... I think the 
                Unsub s been locked up. It s where 
                he learned to control his own 
                  prisoners. 

                              PRENTISS
                So, why are they fighting?

                They were special events. Certain

  A view of the Tenderloin District. Mick hunches above it all,

  A sketchy street in the Tenderloin. Two SUVs and a SWAT truck

  Hotch, Prentiss, Reid and JJ exit one SUV. Cooper and Mick hop

  Keel drags Jane down the street. He has a gun pressed closely to 
  her side, hidden from view. No one on the street gives them a 
  second thought. They turn down --    CRIMINAL MINDS         "Ep. Title"       DRAFT   12/8/09  57.



  A second street. Keel freezes. His POV --

  COPS surround a beat-up car, examining the license plate. Keel 
  immediately spins and pulls Jane back in the opposite direction.

  Keel hurries Jane through the streets. She tries to meet eyes 
  with people but there s a gun to her. She s too scared to yell.

    A floodlight passes over him. He looks up to see a helicopter.

  Keel and Jane. He nervously looks up, toward the helicopter, 
  then his eyes dart around the streets. He knows the cops are 
  everywhere. He leaps for a fire escape ladder.

                              PRENTISS
                Drop the gun. 

  The helicopter shines its light on him. He backs up toward the 
  edge of the building. The agents keep moving toward them.

                You got nowhere to go. Drop it.

  And Keel SHOVES Jane forward, toward the agents. As he does, he 
  turns and jumps. Prentiss races to the edge of the building.

  What she sees. Keel didn t fall to the street below. He s on a 
  fire escape, ten feet down, and his gun is pointed straight at 
  Prentiss. In that instant, she knows she s a dead woman and --

  BAM. Keel falls. A perfect head shot. Prentiss follows the path 
  of the bullet to see --

  Mick, on a nearby rooftop. He lowers his rifle. He and Prentiss 
  meet eyes. The helicopter hovers above as --

  Gina holds Jane. Morgan watches. Off the scene.

  Lights. Cop cars. Two ambulances. Paramedics treat the other 
  abducted man in one. Ben is loaded into the second. Reid and JJ 
  are here, as --

  Prentiss, Morgan and Gina approach with Jane. JJ walks to them. 

                              JENNIFER
                They have to take him to the 
                hospital but the paramedics say

                Can I talk to him?

                              JENNIFER
                Of course. 

  Gina steps away, allowing Jane to walk to Ben. He holds up a 
  hand for the medics to wait. Jane hurries to him. She hugs him. 
  The medics seem concerned. She eases off.

  Watches with Prentiss and Morgan. Hotch approaches. Their POV --

  A squad car arrives. Leslie gets out. She meets eyes with Gina. 
  A beat. Leslie mouths: Thank you. 

  Gina directs her with her eyes to Ben and Jane. Leslie hurries 
  to them. As her daughter sees her and throws her arms around 
  her, go back to the agents, watching. And up the block, at a 
  distance, they notice --

  Cooper. He watches the family reunion. As Gina says to Hotch --

                It was  98, I think -- a series of 
                child murders in Dallas. Cooper got 
                the guy but told the police he 
                thought they had a second killer. 
                The victim preferences were too

                FBI brass told him to get his butt 
                home. He did as he was told. 

  A beat.

                The boy in the photo s name was
