      Turbulence and driving rain.  Neither fun.  The attractive 
      and nervous POWELL FAMILY -- JIM, his wife STEPHANIE and 
      kids, DAPHNE, 16, and JJ, 13 -- try to remain calm.

                    That storm really came out of 
                    nowhere.

      BUMP.  Plane and passengers are tossed.  MITCH McCUTCHEON -- 
      the rugged pilot -- does his best to reassure the family.

                                  MITCH
                    Don t worry.  I ve flown through a 
                    lot worse.

                                  JIM
                    Oh... yeah.  When?

                                  MITCH
                    Actually, I m just trying to make 
                    you feel better.  This is about the 
                    worst shit I ve ever been up in.

      Stephanie sees that Daphne s texting.

                                  STEPHANIE
                          (disbelief)
                    Who are you texting now?

                                  DAPHNE
                    God.

      Stephanie shakes her head.  As Jim takes in his family...

                                  JIM (V.O.)
                    It was the moment that changed 
                      everything.  But it wasn t the 
                      beginning.

      BANG!  The PLANE is JOLTED.  Tossed to and fro, until it 
      DROPS!  Out of frame.  Falling.  The SUDDEN DIVE brings us 
      BACK TO --

      Jim talks on the phone, then smiles.

                                  JIM (V.O.)
                    ...I convinced her to go out with 
                    me.


      She hangs up the phone, turns to her studious ROOMMATE.

      Jim animatedly tells a story to Stephanie, drinking amidst 
        gesticulations.

                    As I found out later, I didn t 
                    either. 


      Post-date, Stephanie enters.  Her roommate looks up at her.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    He thought he was really charming. 
                    I just think he was drunk.


      A dejected Jim sits with his roommate GEORGE ST.CLOUD, African-
      American, who points to a STUNNING PHOTO of Stephanie in the 
      campus paper.  Under the headline  Student Wins Gentry Grant. 

                                  JIM (V.O.)
                      Well-meaning friends tried to 
                    convince me my feelings were 
                    misguided --

                                  GEORGE
                    She s not that cute.  Look at that 
                    extra space between her nose and 
                    upper lip.  Disgusting.  Plus... 
                    you really want to be married to a

      Jim talks on the phone.

                                  JIM (V.O.)
                    Unmoved by such reason, I talked my 
                    way into a second date.

                    It was easier than admitting the 
                    truth -- that nothing had changed.

                                  JIM (CONT D)
                    Sorry.  I used up all my vacation

                    Then maybe we could just drive up

                    feel guilty for not being somewhere

                    I m not making any decisions.  I 
                    just want to talk to him...

                                  GEORGE
                    You want to hear about divorce?  I ve 
                    been thru two.  The second one was 
                    like an interrogation at Gitmo.  And 
                    the first one -- that was the bad one.

                                  JIM
                    I don t make her happy anymore.  It s 
                    actually the humane thing to do.

                                  GEORGE
                    Look.  No one says marriage is 
                    easy.  But before you give up the 
                    fight, talk to this guy first.  Not 
                    that he helped me... but he came 
                    close.

      George reaches into his wallet.  Pulls out a BUSINESS CARD. 
      Slides it to Jim.  It s for a MARRIAGE COUNSELOR.

                    knows what tomorrow brings?


      Stephanie lies in bed, asleep.  Jim gets in... slowly closes 
      his eyes and drifts off to sleep.          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  9.

                    So I went to bed and hoped tomorrow 
                    brought something new.

                    I already told the detectives -- I 
                    couldn t see his face.  He was

                    I know this is hard.  But if you 
                    can remember anything -- hair 
                    color, eye color, height -- I can 
                    create a composite of this man.  It

                                  YVONNE
                    Powell.

                                  JIM
                    Cho.
                          (on second thought)
                    Officer Cho.          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  10.

      Yvonne looks sympathetically at Iris Mitchell.

                                  YVONNE
                    Third jewelry store invasion in 
                    three days.  How s it going with 
                    the vic s wife?

                                  JIM
                    Can I ask you a question?  How do 
                    you do it?  Day after day facing 
                    people you just can t help...

                                  YVONNE
                    By not asking myself that question.

      NEARBY... A METH-HEAD CRIMINAL in handcuffs is tossed into a 
      chair at a DETECTIVE S desk.  The Criminal is tweaking hard --

                                  COP
                    Sir.  Tell me what you re on, sir.  
                    What drugs you have taken...

      No use.  The Criminal thrashes.  Spits in the cop s face.  

      BACK WITH JIM AND YVONNE --

                                  YVONNE
                    Truth is, I feel helpless most of 
                    the time, too.  Crime s up.  As bad 
                    as I ve seen it.  I wish more people 
                    around here cared as much as you do. 

                                  JIM
                    Caring deeply about things I can t 
                    control is a hobby of mine.  My 
                    work... my marriage.
                          (he s said too much)
                    Anyway, I should get back to Mrs. 
                    Mitchell.  But if you ever need big 
                    eyes or smart lips --

                                  YVONNE
                    You ll be my first call.

      As Yvonne smiles at Jim, ACROSS THE ROOM... THE CRIMINAL 
      wrests free.  He lunges and GRABS the GUN of an unsuspecting 
      cop.  Yvonne sees this.

                                  YVONNE (CONT D)
                          (yelling)
                    Gun!

      Chaos.  The Meth-head pistol-whips an oncoming uniform, 
      knocking him down.  Then points his gun wildly -- firing in 
      the direction of -- YVONNE.  BANG!          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  11.

      In a flash, Jim reacts without thinking -- LEAPS and PUSHES 
      Yvonne out of the path of the oncoming bullet.  

      COPS fire on the Criminal, hitting him.  He crumples into a 
      heap.  The melee settles.  Jim looks to Yvonne, out of breath.

                                  JIM
                    You okay?!

                                  YVONNE
                    Yeah.  I think so.  You?

      Jim nods, as the wounded Criminal is pulled to his feet and 
      led past them.  Yvonne rises, looks around quizzically. 

                                  JIM
                    What are you looking for?

                                  YVONNE
                    The bullet... it missed me, but I 
                    can t seem to find where it --

                                  JIM
                    Just be glad you re okay.

                                  YVONNE
                          (nods, then)
                    Hey.  You re sure you re alright?

                                  JIM
                    Maybe I just need some air.

      Jim, seemingly shaken, makes a beeline for the HALLWAY.  

                                  JIM (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    But it wasn t post-traumatic stress 
                    that drove me from that room.

      Looks around -- he s alone.  He opens his hand to REVEAL --

                                  JIM (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    It was the unmistakable, irrefutable 
                    sense that life had finally turned.

      THE BULLET, rests in his hand.  Jim caught the bullet.  Off 
      Jim, stunned, we... SMASH TO BLACK.


                                  END OF ACT ONE          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  12.

                                        ACT TWO


      On Stephanie, asleep in her bed...

                                  STEPHANIE (V.O.)
                    There s that split second just 
                    after you wake up when the world 
                    hasn t yet pressed itself on your 
                    chest.

      She opens her eyes.  Smiles blissfully to herself.

                                  STEPHANIE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Before you remember your work.  Or 
                    your troubled marriage.  Or the 
                    people you fear you ll disappoint.

      She REACTS to the SOUND OF CAREFREE WHISTLING.

                                  STEPHANIE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    But what I woke up to that morning 
                    was something very different.


      Jim flexes in the bathroom mirror.  The love handles don t 
      bother him today.  Stephanie slowly enters, smiles.

                                  STEPHANIE (V.O.)
                    What I woke up to was a man I 
                    hadn t seen in years.

                                  JIM
                          (wide smile)
                    Beautiful day, isn t it?

      Stephanie smiles.  Unsure, but not questioning it.  Moves 
      closer.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    You know, I can try to push back my 
                      presentation til this afternoon.  
                    If you wanna... you know...

                                  JIM
                    Sorry.  Can t.  Big day.  Very big 
                    day.

    A QUICK KISS and he s gone.  Stephanie watches him, puzzled.

                                  STEPHANIE (V.O.)
                    Though Jim seemed different today, 
                    I barely had time to wonder why...          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  13.

      PUSH IN ON STEPHANIE S REFLECTION, as she studies herself in 
      the BATHROOM MIRROR.

                                  STEPHANIE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Because lately, my life had become 
                    a race.

      WIDEN as she rushes to put on eye-liner -- badly.

                                  STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                    Racing to get ready in the morning.


      Stephanie and her energetic lab assistant, KATIE ANDREWS, 
      late 20s and perky cute, hustle down the hall.

                                  KATIE
                    The Board s waiting for you -- in 
                    the conference room.  
                          (then)
                    And Steph?  Shoes.

      Katie indicates the Stephanie still has her SNEAKERS on. 
      Stephanie quickly switches into her SHOES.  

                                  STEPHANIE (V.O.)
                    Racing through my day... unsure if 
                    this was a race that could ever be 
                    won.

      As she RUNS down the HALLWAY into --          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  14.


      Stephanie makes her presentation to the BOARD.  Observing is 
      Stephanie s boss, DR. DAYTON KING, 50s, kindly.  High-tech 
      video graphics fill a bank of OVERSIZED SCREENS. 

                                  STEPHANIE
                    -- but amidst the untold natural 
                    resources of the Amazon basin, we 
                    uncovered perhaps the crown jewel -- 
                    the trilsettum coronis.

        CUTTING-EDGE GRAPHICS of the PLANT fill the screen, visually 
      breaking it down on a cellular level.

                                  STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                    The trilsettum coronis has adapted 
                    and thrived for nearly 50,000 years --

      DR. FRANCIS CHILES, 30s, slick, unctuous, INTERJECTS.

                                    FRANCIS
                    A plant, Dr. Powell?  You re 
                    wasting the Board s time... on a 
                    plant?

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Not just any plant, Dr. Chiles. 
                    Carbon-14 dating traces the 
                      trilsettum cornonis back to the 
                      Pleistocene Epoch --

                                    FRANCIS
                    I stand corrected.  You re wasting 
                    the Board s time on a really old 
                    plant?

      Dr. King gives Francis a disapproving look.

                                  KING
                    Dr. Chiles.  You ll get your turn 
                    to waste the Board s time. 
                          (turning back to her)
                    This is fascinating, Dr. Powell.  
                    Tell us more about this plant...

      Stephanie glances at her watch.  Never enough time.  Then she 
      smiles at King...

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Our facility in Bel m is already 
                      experimenting with practical 
                      applications across our divisions -- 
                      pharmaceuticals, paper, green 
                    fuels.  
                          (then)
                                  (MORE)          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  15.

                                  STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
                    To be honest, sir, I d bet money 
                    there s nothing this plant can t 
                    do...

      A HUNDRED DOLLAR bill slammed flat on a counter.  WIDEN TO --


      Jim stands across the counter from the teenage CLERK.

                                  CLERK
                    I don t have change.

                                  JIM
                    I don t want change.  I want to buy 
                    out the whole place.  One hour.

                                  CLERK
                    Alright.  Cool.  All yours.

                                  JIM
                    And I want you to take a break.  

                                  CLERK
                    Sorry.  I m not allowed to leave 
                    you alone here --

      Jim slams ANOTHER HUNDRED down 

                                  CLERK (CONT D)
                    -- for more than an hour.


      Jim puts a token into the slot, presses the 80 mph Button.  
      He stands at home plate.  No bat, no helmet.  He waits

      A BALL fires out of the machine.  Effortlessly, he reaches 
      out and catches it.  Smiles.

      MOMENTS LATER -- Jim presses the 90 mph Button.  Again, he 
      waits.  Again, a ball fires.  Again, he catches it.

      MOMENTS LATER -- Jim kneels down, examining the PITCHING 
      MACHINE s inner workings.  At 100 mph, the SPEED DIAL warns: 
       DO NOT TURN PAST.   Jim turns past, all the way to 140 mph.

      BACK IN THE CAGE -- Jim waits.  A ball fires out.  Blazing 
      speed.  He reaches out to catch it, but before it arrives...

                                  STEPHANIE (V.O.)
                    As life came at me faster...


      Stephanie and Katie HUSTLE back down the hallway.           No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  16.

                                  STEPHANIE (V.O.)
                    ...I raced to keep up.

                                  STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                    That took much longer than it was 
                    supposed to.  Remember, if anyone 
                    needs me, I ll be at JJ s school --
                    Did I mention he may be flunking 
                    out? -- Then Daphne s game.  And -- 
                    crap --

                                  KATIE
                    What?

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Date night with Jim!  I forgot to 
                    make reservations.  Can you --?
                          (off Katie s nod)
                    Someplace romantic.  That won t 
                    give the table away if I m late!

                                  KATIE
                    Oh... Stephanie.  Shoes.

      They REVERSE the process -- Stephanie slips OFF the shoes, 
      slips ON her sneakers.  PUSHES out the DOOR.  We MATCH ON --


      A DOOR, opening, as George enters.  Takes in Jim ALONE amidst 
      the empty cages.

                                  GEORGE
                    If this is an intervention, I don t 
                    drink.  And if it s a surprise 
                    party, the turnout s a little 
                      depressing.

                                  JIM
                    It s neither.  There s something I 
                    need to show you...

      Jim presses the button.  Stands at home plate.  Waiting.

                                  GEORGE
                    I m no Hideki Matsui, but don t you 
                    generally want a bat when you re 
                    standing up there?

      CLOSE ON THE MACHINE -- as a BALL is fed down the tube and 
      into the chute.  It FIRES!  Blazing speed.  

      Jim waits confidently.  George squints nervously.  The 140 
      mph fast ball speeds towards home plate.  And then --          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  17.

      Jim reaches out and catches it.  Opens his hand to REVEAL 
      only DUST AND A COWHIDE COVERING

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                          (unsure)
                    O-kay.  You ve been taking magic 
                    classes at the Learning Annex?

                                  JIM
                    It s not magic.  

      Jim UNZIPS a gym bag, pulls out a .32 Glock. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Uh, I think we re starting to cross 
                    lines here.  Where the hell did you 
                    get that?

                                  JIM
                    Supply closet.  Surprisingly poor 
                    lock.

                                  GEORGE
                    And what do you need that for?

                                  JIM
                    I don t.  You do.
                          (beat)
                    I need you to shoot me.

      As George looks back in disbelief, we re --


      Stephanie faces PRINCIPAL YEAGER.  JJ sits silently nearby.

                                  PRINCIPAL
                    Not what a parent wants to hear. 
                    But if JJ s grades don t improve... 
                    repeating the ninth grade may be 
                    our only option.

                                  STEPHANIE
                          (shaking her head)
                    It s my fault.  I work with him 
                    every night.  And if I had more 
                    time, I know JJ could excel.

      The BELL RINGS.  JJ stands, touches his mother s shoulder.  

                                  JJ
                    Sometimes there s just not enough 
                    time.

      He exits. She watches him go, concerned.          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  18.


      Stephanie stares at a framed PHOTO of HER and JIM, as she 
      picks up the phone, dials.

                                  STEPHANIE
                          (into phone)
                    Hi.  It s me.  Bad news... date 
                    night not looking promising.          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  20.

      INTERCUT Jim, on his cell, in the BATTING CAGE.  Listening.

                                  STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                          (into phone)
                    And I m sorry.  There s no one I d 
                    rather be with than you, but the 
                      Chairman s in town and suddenly 
                    it s like an episode of  Survivor  
                    around here --

                                  JIM
                    No, it s fine.

                                  STEPHANIE
                          (a beat, then)
                    It is?  You re sure?

                                  JIM
                    Sure.  How can we predict 
                      everything that s gonna happen to 
                    us?

                                  STEPHANIE (V.O.)
                    And suddenly I couldn t tell -- did 
                    I have an understanding husband?  
                    Or one who just no longer cared?

                                  STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                    Well... okay.  I ll see you at home 
                    then.

      We STAY WITH JIM, as he hangs up his cell.

                                  JIM
                    Alright.  Let s do this.

      WIDEN to REVEAL George aiming a gun at him from across the room.

                                  GEORGE
                          (terrified)
                    I can t believe I m gonna kill you--

                                  JIM
                    You re not gonna kill me, George.  
                    You re just gonna shoot me.

                                  GEORGE
                    I m a black and white-kinda guy.  
                    To me... sorta the same thing.

                                  JIM
                          (sincerely)
                    Look.  You saw it.  Something s 
                    happening to me.  Something... 
                      impossible.  
                                  (MORE)          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  21.

                                  JIM (CONT'D)
                    I need to know what I can do.  And 
                    I need your help.  Please.

      As George considers this, we re --

                                  JIM (CONT D)
                      I promise.  It ll be over in a 
                    second.

                                  GEORGE
                    That s what I m afraid of.

      George relents.  Shakily aims the gun.  Sweat beads on his 
      face.  Finger tickles the trigger.  More sweat.  But AS HE 
      FIRES, he loses his nerve and jerks the gun away.  The bullet 
      flies off-course. 

      Jim reacts, sprints towards the bullet like a center fielder, 
      Leaps in the air and flies into the wall.  But unlike a 
      center fielder... he goes RIGHT THROUGH.

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                          (stunned)
                    Jesus.

      George runs to the HOLE IN THE WALL.  Amidst pieces of 
      plaster and drywall, Jim looks up at him from the floor  
      REVEALS... the BULLET.  Caught.  Smiles.

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                          (at a loss)
                    Well there goes your deposit.


      Stephanie steps off the ELEVATOR into the LOBBY.

                                  STEPHANIE (V.O.)
                    And so instead of  Date Night,  I 
                    headed off to dinner...

                                  SECURITY GUARD
                    Oh... Dr. Powell?  They just left. 
                    Dr. King said to meet them at the 
                      restaurant.

      Stephanie exhales as we SMASH TO --


      He turns the key.  Dead.

                                  STEPHANIE (V.O.)
                    And once again...          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  22.


      Family breakfast.  Jim hums to himself as he eats.

                                  JIM (V.O.)
                    For the next few weeks I did my 
                    best to act as if nothing had 
                    changed.  

                                  JIM (CONT D)
                          (mmmm...)
                    This is great.  Really great.  What 
                    do you call this?

                                  DAPHNE
                    Uh... Raisin Bran?

                                  JIM (V.O.)
                    But the days following the onset of my 
                    abilities stuck to a similar script.

      LATER -- Jim gives quick kisses to the kids.

                                  JIM (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    I d kiss my family goodbye.

      And he s gone.  Daphne turns knowingly to JJ --

                                  DAPHNE
                          (re: Jim)
                    Mid-life crisis.


      Jim sits with HECTOR, 20s, a witness.

                                  JIM (V.O.)
                    Do my job...

                                  HECTOR
                          (emotionally)
                    Mrs. Epstein hired me.  When no one 
                    else would.  She said I had 
                      potential.  First person who ever 
                    believed in me.  Now the last, too.

                                  JIM
                    He was... wearing a mask?

                                  HECTOR
                    President Obama, yeah.  

      Jim nods earnestly, then glances up at the WALL CLOCK.          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  25.

                                  JIM (V.O.)
                    Counting the minutes  til lunch.  
                    When I d meet George.  To write the 
                    Owner s Manual for my new ride.


      Stephanie -- buoyant -- kisses Daphne and JJ goodbye.

                                  STEPHANIE (V.O.)
                    Namely, me.

      As she bounces off, Daphne turns knowingly to JJ --

                                  DAPHNE
                          (re: Stephanie)
                      Menopause.


      Stephanie sits across from Katie.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Can I talk to you?  In confidence?

                                  KATIE
                    Ohmygod -- you re firing me...

                                  STEPHANIE
                    No.  I m not firing you.  This is 
                    about me.

                                  KATIE
                          (excited)
                    Are you gonna tell me something 
                    really personal like we re best 
                    friends even though I m only your 
                    lab tech because that would totally 
                    validate everything I ve been 
                    working on in therapy?

                                  STEPHANIE
                    I m fast.

      Katie looks at her.  That s it?

                                  KATIE
                          (unsure)
                    Um.  That s the big... secret?

                                  STEPHANIE
                    No.  Really fast.
                          (off her look)
                    I m not making my point.  Uh... you 
                    know that weird little leprechaun 
                    you keep downstairs in your cubicle?          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  27.

                                  KATIE
                    Yeah? 

      Suddenly, Stephanie s GONE.  But her exit is like a BLAST 
      from a JET ENGINE firing to life.  She moves THAT fast.  
      Papers FLY about, Katie s HAIR is BLOWN back.  Then --

      The GUST returns with Stephanie, as she sets the LEPRECHAUN 
      down in front of a stunned Katie.

                                  STEPHANIE
                          (smiles)
                    I told you -- I m fast.

      As -- IN THE HALLWAY, CO-WORKERS scurry to retrieve their 
      papers strewn about the hall, unsure what just happened -- 
      Katie looks up at Stephanie...

                                  KATIE
                          (nervously)
                    Dr. Powell.  I consider you a role 
                    model, so don t take this the wrong 
                    way, but... you re frightening me.

      As Stephanie smiles reassuringly back at her, we re --

                                  JIM (V.O.)
                    Each day brought new tests...


      Jim takes a WITNESS statement, types on his KEYBOARD.  But 
      his newfound strength causes him to CRUSH a few keys.  He 
      smiles sheepishly at the witness.

      MOMENTS LATER -- at the SUPPLY WINDOW, Jim hands over the 
      broken keyboard.

                                  SUPPLY CLERK
                          (re the keyboard)
                    Fourth one this week.

                                  JIM
                          (shrugs)
                    NAFTA.

      Supply Clerk exits, revealing a ROW OF POLICE SCANNERS on the 
      shelf behind him.  Jim looks at them as YVONNE steps in.          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  30.

                                  YVONNE
                    How s it going?  On the jewelry 
                    heist perp?

                                  JIM
                    You can t catch him, I can t draw 
                    him.

                                  YVONNE
                    Maybe we should switch jobs.

      Yvonne turns, goes.  Jim smiles as he watches her, then looks 
      back at the SCANNERS and thinks.  We END MONTAGE as we re --


      Post-sex.  Jim and Stephanie, in bed.  Blissful.  She notes 
      his wide smile.

                                  STEPHANIE
                          (off his smile)
                    What?

                                  JIM
                    So many things.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Like...?

                                  JIM
                    Like... you called.  Like we re 
                    here.  Like we did that.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    It s nice to remember that we re 
                    good at that.  

                                  JIM
                    Yeah.  That s a nice thing to be 
                    good at.

      He looks at her.  For a long moment.  

                                  STEPHANIE
                    But...?

                                  JIM
                    Nothing, just -- can I say it?  You 
                    seem... different to me.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Me?  Because I ve been feeling the 
                    same way about you lately --

                                  JIM
                    You have?          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  34.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Jim, how could I not notice?  
                    You ve been... happy.

                                  JIM
                    You haven t been stressed.

      She smiles at him.  Moves in for a kiss.  But he pulls away. 
      As if he HAS to say it...

                                  JIM (CONT D)
                    You know, I didn t choose to be 
                      depressed.  My life wasn t working 
                    out like I d hoped.  Meanwhile, 
                    you re running off living your 
                    dream every day...

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Yes, I wanted to have it all.  But 
                    I was running so fast, I was 
                    falling short at everything --

                                  JIM
                     Falling short?   Are you kidding?  
                    Who could keep up?

                                  STEPHANIE
                    You couldn t keep up because...
                    you stopped trying.  

      He s stung, but he knows she s right.  They look at each 
      other.  Whatever connection they d forged... fading.  The 
      beautiful afternoon nearly a memory.

                                  STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                    We were doing so well there for a 
                    second...

      He smiles ruefully at her. 

                                  STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                    I should get home.  Help JJ study 
                    for his Math test. 
                          (deflated)
                    But... thanks for a nice afternoon. 
                    It s nice to see your smile again.

      Stephanie gives him a smile, exits.  Jim exhales, regretful.  
      Then... his CELL RINGS. 

                                  JIM
                          (into phone)
                    Hello?          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  35.


      George stands over Jim, in bed.  Jim immediately reaches for 
      the WOUND at the base of his skull.  It s bandaged.

                                  GEORGE
                    You had some blood loss, but the 
                    bullet didn t penetrate too far.  
                    We pulled it out, sewed you up.  
                    Good as new.

                                  JIM
                     We? 
                          (realizing)
                    Wait.  My bedroom.  George.  Please 
                    don t tell me --

                                  GEORGE
                    She s a doctor.

                                  JIM
                    George!

                                  GEORGE
                    Where was I supposed to take you, a 
                    hospital?  So I could explain to 
                    the attending how a bullet from a 
                    heavy artillery gun only penetrated 
                    a 1/4  into your scalp?

                                  JIM
                    But Stephanie.  Of all people. 
                    She ll never understand what s 
                    happened to me.

      Then... REVEAL Stephanie, having been listening off-camera.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Actually, I think she will.

      Jim looks at her.

                                  STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                    You know that sketch of me out in 
                    the guest house?  The one you drew 
                    on our second date?          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  38.



      Jim nods and SUDDENLY... she s GONE with a BLUR and a GUST OF 
      AIR... Jim and George squint from its jet-like force.  Then... 
      she s BACK.  Hands the FRAMED SKETCH to a stunned Jim.

                                  GEORGE
                    You two are freaky.


      Jim, in his bed, and Stephanie on it.  Relaxed. 

                                  STEPHANIE
                    In his defense, George didn t want 
                    to tell me...

                                  JIM
                    He s been dying to tell someone.

      Stephanie takes in Jim.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    He said -- you have... some kind of 
                    super strength. 

                                  JIM
                          (nods, then)
                    And you...

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Speed, for lack of a better term.

                                  JIM
                    And you really think... the plane 
                    crash?  That s when we -- ?

                                  STEPHANIE
                          (nods)
                    It s the only explanation.  I ve 
                    been over this.  In my head.


      Mitch s plane has just crashed into a jungle STREAM.  The 
      FAMILY fights to push their way out of the wreckage.

                                  STEPHANIE (V.O.)
                    When our plane went down... the 
                    water... it had a phosphorescence.

      Stephanie struggles to get her head above water.  Notices a 
      GLOW to it.          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  39.

                                  STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                    At the time I thought it was 
                    gasoline.  From the plane.  But gas 
                    floats on water.  This didn t.

      CLOSE on GLOWING AMORPHOUS PATCHES beneath the surface.

                                  STEPHANIE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    You probably didn t notice.  You 
                    had other things on your mind.

      Jim emerges from the wreckage.  Last man out.

                                  JIM
                          (urgently, to Stephanie)
                    You okay?
                          (she nods, then)
                    Daphne?  JJ?

                      DAPHNEJJ
      Yeah.We re okay.

                                  JIM (CONT D)
                          (realizing)
                    Mitch.  Where s Mitch?

      Jim s head is on a swivel, searching.  Then he re-submerges, 
      finds an UNCONSCIOUS MITCH trapped beneath the wreckage. 

      UNDER THE WATER -- He struggles mightily to free him.  But he 
      can t.  And when he looks back at Mitch s face... he s dead.  
      The PLANE VANISHES as it SINKS to the BOTTOM.

      Jim is pained.  Another moment in a long line of weak 
      moments.  He resurfaces, gasps for air.  Then he looks at 
      Stephanie.  Shakes his head.

                                  STEPHANIE
                            (reassuring)
                    It s okay.  It s --
                          (pulls him close)
                    C mere.  We re okay.  C mere.

      Jim nods, pulls his family close.  Holds them all.

      BACK TO PRESENT -- Jim and Stephanie in their bedroom.

                                  JIM
                    So... that s what did this to us?  
                    The crash?

                                  STEPHANIE
                    I don t know.  But it s the only 
                    thing that makes sense.  If 
                    anything about this makes sense...          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  40.

                                  JIM
                    All of us were in that water.

                                  STEPHANIE
                          (concerned)
                    I know.

      Just then, Stephanie s cell rings.

                                  STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                          (into phone)
                    Hello?
                          (then, concerned)
                    Daphne.  What s wrong?


      Stephanie on the drivers  side, an obviously shaken Daphne in 
      her soccer uniform on the passengers  side. 

                                  DAPHNE
                          (a beat, then)
                    I didn t know who else to call.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Daphne, can you talk to me?  Tell 
                    me what happened.

                                  DAPHNE
                    You won t believe me.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    I always believe you.
                          (off Daphne s look)
                    Usually.

                                  DAPHNE
                    I had another game today. 

                                  STEPHANIE
                    I m sorry I couldn t get there.  
                    But your father --

                                  DAPHNE
                    Mom.  

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Sorry.  Not about me.

                                  DAPHNE
                    It started off normally enough.


      A family meeting in progress. 

                                  JJ
                    So you guys have... like... 
                      superpowers?

                                  STEPHANIE
                    I m not sure I d put it like that.  
                    But... yes, we ve gained new 
                      abilities.  Extraordinary 
                      abilities.
                          (then)
                    And JJ... maybe you ve been 
                      experiencing things, too.  That you 
                    might not understand entirely...

      JJ says nothing.

                                  JIM
                          (hopefully)
                    JJ...?

                                  JJ
                      Unbelievable.  My whole family gets 
                    dipped in some super water and all 
                    I get is... wet.

                                  JIM
                    So... you haven t -- ?          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  43.

                                  JJ
                    No.  I m still plain old JJ.  You 
                    know, the dumb one.

                        DAPHNESTEPHANIE
      No one says dumb anymore.  What?  No... 
      It s  non-academically 
      minded. 

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Daphne!  
                          (then)
                    JJ, do you think that s how we see 
                    you?

                                  JJ
                    Uh... no.  I know it.  The way you 
                    talk to me.  The way you look at 
                    me.  

                                  DAPHNE
                    He s right.  We all have roles in 
                    this family.  Dad s the dreamer, 
                    Mom s the worrier.  You re the dumb 
                    ass.  And I m the selfish one.  Who 
                    cares only about herself.

      Jim and Stephanie exchange a look.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Daphne.  That s not how --

                                  DAPHNE
                    And what s the point of this 
                    meeting anyway?  For you two to 
                    convince yourselves that you re 
                    special?  Because you can lift 
                    cars.  And you can change your 
                    face.  That you re not just some 
                    suburban couple who checked out on 
                    each other years ago?

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Is that... is that how you see us?

                                  DAPHNE
                          (head of steam)
                    Well, here s the good news.  For 
                    me, anyway.  What happened to me 
                    happened once.  And I m not 
                    planning on it happening again.  So 
                    as far as I m concerned, I m in the 
                    same boat with JJ here.  Just as 
                    boring as I was last week.          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  44.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    We can t make any assumptions.  As 
                      a scientist, I ve barely scratched 
                    the surface in my testing.  And as 
                    your mother, I m just plain worried 
                    about you.

                                  DAPHNE
                    Then how about this?  Quit your 
                      researching and your worrying.  
                    Just go back to thinking about me 
                    as the selfish girl.  At least that 
                    you understood.  

                                  JIM
                    Daphne...

      But she s gone, out the door, letting it slam behind her.  
      When Jim and Stephanie look back, they see JJ s gone, too.  
      SLAM!  His bedroom door.  They exchange a look of failure.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Guess these abilities don t change 
                      everything.


      CLOSE on a perfect sketch of the CRIMINAL who shot Jim.

                    What s this?

                                  JIM

                    fleeing police pursuit yesterday.

                          (studying the sketch)
                    Hmmm.  I hadn t heard.  I ll run it 
                    through the database.  

      Yvonne SCANS in the sketch.  Jim s SKETCH appears ON SCREEN.  
      She initiates a MATCH PROGRAM.  As it runs...

                                  YVONNE (CONT D)
                    Lemme ask you -- witness seemed 
                    credible?

                                  JIM
                    Looked as honest as I do.

      ON SCREEN -- a PHOTO MATCHES the sketch.  We see the INFO: 
      ERIK KOBLENZ.  And the RAP SHEET that comes with him.          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  45.

                    Jump bail last month in Michigan.  
                    Thanks, Powell.  Good work.

                                  JIM
                    Any known address?

                                  YVONNE
                          (smiles)
                    You bucking for my job?
                          (he shrugs)
                    No local address.  But look at this 
                    -- someone named Sally Downs posted 
                    his bond last month.  And she s got 
                    a place right downtown.


      Party.  Kids, music, beer.  Daphne enters, makes a beeline for 
      LUCAS, who s again talking to LINDSAY.  Ignoring her, Daphne 
      gives Lucas a LONG KISS.  Then pulls away.

                                  DAPHNE
                          (to Lucas)
                    This party is way too crowded.

                                  LUCAS
                            (good-naturedly)
                    Hey.  Easy.  What s up with you?

                                  DAPHNE
                    I ve had a really weird day.  One 
                    that I d just as soon forget.  And 
                    I know one thing we could do to 
                    help me forget it...

      He looks at her, she nods.  He grasps the inference.

                                  LUCAS
                    Tonight?  But I thought you wanted 
                    to wait...

                                  DAPHNE
                    For what?  Who knows if we re even 
                    gonna be alive tomorrow?

                                  LUCAS
                    I m pretty sure we re gonna be 
                    alive tomorrow.

                                  DAPHNE
                    Well I know a way we can be more 
                    alive.          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  46.

      She smiles, pulls him off.  As Lindsay watches them disappear 
      up the stairs, we re --


      SALLY DOWNS, 30s and attractive, stands in the foyer of her 
      tenth-floor apartment.  REVERSE onto Cho and Hixon.

                                  YVONNE
                    Ms. Downs?  I m Officer Cho and 
                    this is Officer Hixon.  If it s not 
                    too much trouble, we d like to ask 
                    you a few questions.

                                  SALLY
                    About?

                                  YVONNE
                    Your former boyfriend, Erik 
                    Koblenz.  He s a suspect in a 
                    series of robberies that I m sure 
                    you ve heard about.

                                  SALLY
                    Erik?  I haven t seen him since I 
                    posted his bail.  If you find him, 
                    tell him he owes me two grand.

                                  YVONNE
                    Okay.  Well if he attempts to make 
                    contact, please let us know.

      As they turn to go, the OFFICERS turn to face Koblenz, 
      stepping off the elevator.  Yvonne sizes him up.

                                  YVONNE (CONT D)
                    Koblenz?

      Suddenly, Koblenz lifts his GUN, blows a hole through Hixon.  
      Then he TRAINS it on Yvonne, barks at Sally --

                                    KOBLENZ
                          (to Sally)
                    Pack everything up, then disappear.  
                          (looks at Yvonne)
                    This one ll stay with me.

      And with that, he promptly cracks Yvonne with his gun.  As 
      she falls unconscious to the floor, we... SMASH TO BLACK.

      Jim sits at the desk, fiddling with his SCANNER.  Can t get 
      it to work.  Then Stephanie enters.  Preoccupied.

                                  JIM
                    You okay?

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Just got off the phone with my 
                    mother.  Somehow... not sharing the 
                    details of my life with her never 
                    felt like lying.  Until now.

                                  JIM
                    For the best.  If anyone can make 
                    you feel like moving at the speed of 
                    sound isn t fast enough, it s her.

      Stephanie smiles.  Then as her smile fades, she looks at him.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    And there s one other thing...

      She silently sets down the MARRIAGE COUNSELOR s card that 
      George had earlier given him.

                                  STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                    Do you really think we need to see 
                    him?

                                  JIM
                      Honestly... don t you?  I mean, half 
                    the couples I know are in 
                      counseling.  And the other half... 
                    figuring out who keeps the flatware.

      She nods.  Then looks at him --

                                  STEPHANIE
                    How did I lose you, Jim?  Did I 
                      disappoint you?  Was I not who you 
                    expected I would be?

                                  JIM
                    No.  It wasn t you.  I lost myself.  
                    And maybe it was just easier to 
                    blame you than to take 
                      responsibility.  But that s over 
                    now.  Because these abilities -- 
                    whatever they are -- make me feel 
                    alive.  In a way that I haven t 
                    felt since... I met you.          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  48.

      She looks at him.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    That s sweet, but Jim... I m not so 
                    sure -- scientifically-speaking -- 
                    that these powers are a good thing.  
                      Unexplained phenomena usually aren t --

      Just then, the SCANNER blares.  Code Zero.  Repeat, Code 
      Zero.  Officer-involved shooting reported at 5700 block of 
      Walling Avenue.  All cars in vicinity.  Proceed with caution.  

                                  STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                          (re:  the scanner)
                    Jim... what s that?  Why do you 
                    have that?

      Jim motions for her to shhh.  Listens as we HEAR the faltering 
      voice of Officer Hixon:  This is Hixon... I ve been shot... 
      Koblenz has her...  He has Cho...  His voice trails off. 

                                  JIM
                          (eyes widening)
                    It s him.  

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Who?  Who are these people?

      Jim hurriedly puts on his shoes, jacket.

                                  STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                    Where are you going?  Jim.
                          (he stops)
                    We don t know enough about 
                    ourselves yet.  Your limitations.  
                      Yesterday s bullet went thru skin.  
                    Which one penetrates muscle... or 
                    bone... or your heart?

                                  JIM
                    Don t you see -- I can finally make 
                      a difference.  Just like you did... 
                    everyday.

      He looks at her... then he s gone.  As we hear the FRONT DOOR 
      slam, Stephanie thinks.  And we re...


      We hear the PARTY MUSIC bleeding in from downstairs.  Daphne 
      kisses Lucas, who s not quite sure what to make of her 
      eagerness.  Feeling his reluctance, she pulls away.

                                  DAPHNE
                    What s wrong?  You don t think I m 
                    pretty any more...?          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  49.

                                  LUCAS
                    I think you re gorgeous.  It s not 
                    that --

                                  DAPHNE
                    Then what?   Cause you re starting 
                    to make me question my high self-
                    esteem.

      She locks on his eyes.  Hears his thoughts. 

                                  LUCAS (V.O.)
                    Lindsay s right downstairs.

                                  DAPHNE
                    Lucas...?

                                  LUCAS (V.O.)
                    I can t do it with you upstairs 
                    with Lindsay downstairs.

                                  DAPHNE
                          (haltingly)
                    Lucas, are you... are you sleeping 
                    with Lindsay?

                                  LUCAS
                    No.  Of course not.

      But his thoughts say otherwise...

                                  LUCAS (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    How did she know that?

                                  DAPHNE
                          (realizing)
                    Ohmygod.  You re sleeping with that 
                    slut-bag!

                                  LUCAS
                    No.  I m not.  I --

      Again, his thoughts belie his response.

                                  LUCAS (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Who told her about this afternoon?

                                  DAPHNE
                          (hurt, livid)
                    This afternoon?  You did it with 
                    her this afternoon -- ?  You said 
                    you loved me -- That you were okay 
                    to wait...

      Daphne turns, exits.  Upset.  Leaving Lucas alone.          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  50.

                                  LUCAS
                          (to himself, incredulous)
                    How the hell did she know that?

      DOWNSTAIRS -- Daphne zeroes in on Lindsay.  Faces her.

                                  DAPHNE
                    He s yours.  Enjoy your 
                      relationship based on trust.

      Daphne turns, tears filling her eyes.  Strides out the door.


      Jim tentatively enters, crouches beneath the stairwell as 
      UNIFORMS fly up the stairs.

                                    UNIFORM

                    No sign of him.  Special Response 
                    is on the way.

      Jim tries to decide what to do when he HEARS a muffled WOMAN S 
      SCREAM.  Looks around -- nothing.  Then ANOTHER SCREAM.  

      Two questions swim in Jim s brain --

      Is it Yvonne?  And do I have super hearing?  ANOTHER SCREAM.  
      And the answer is  yes  to both.  Cops fly up the stairs and 
      Jim -- following the screams only he can hear -- goes down.          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  51.


      ON A TV -- carrying LIVE COVERAGE of the hostage situation-in-
      progress.  Stephanie watching, concerned, as Daphne enters.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Honey... are you okay?

                                  DAPHNE
                    Fine.  I just wanna be alone.

                                  STEPHANIE
                      Daphne...?

                                  DAPHNE
                          (giving in, emotional)
                    I don t like this.  I don t want to 
                    be a freak --

                                  STEPHANIE
                    That s not what you are.  Did it -- 
                    did it happen again?

                                  DAPHNE
                          (nods, then)
                    I was with Lucas -- and after 
                      everything, I just wanted to lose 
                    myself, you know.  We were totally 
                    amped to do it.  I mean I was --

      Stephanie swallows her horror.

                                  DAPHNE (CONT D)
                    And when I looked in his eyes... I 
                    could hear him thinking about how 
                    he d already done it with that 
                    skank Lindsay Miller.  He said he 
                    loved me.  Why would he say that if 
                    he didn t mean it?

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Because when it comes to love, most 
                    people are... reckless.  Sometimes 
                    like Lucas was tonight.  Sometimes 
                    slowly, over years.  Without even 
                    knowing it.

      Daphne nods.  Then...

                                  STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                    And Daphne?  About our family fight 
                    today -- I don t think you re selfish.  
                    I just think you re sixteen.  
                          (a final thought)
                    And it s hard enough to be sixteen 
                    without any added burdens.

                                  STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                    So maybe for now -- try not to 
                    eavesdrop on people s thoughts

                                  DAPHNE
                    It s not like I can control it, 
                    Mom.  God.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Then we ll work together.  Figure 
                    out how you can.  Promise.

      Daphne nods appreciatively, as JJ enters.

                                  JJ
                    What s going on -- ?
                          (off their looks)
                    Never mind.  Why is that on?
                          (gets it)
                    Hey, is Dad there?

      JJ indicates the CRIME COVERAGE on the television.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    I think so.  
                          (to Daphne)
                    Daphne, if you want to be alone, I 
                      understand.

                                  DAPHNE
                    That s okay.  I d rather wait here 
                    with you...

                                  JJ
                    Me, too.

      As Jim s family sits, waiting anxiously... but together.


      Jim moves through the dimly-lit garage.  He peers around a 
      corner -- where he sees Koblenz throwing Yvonne into the 
      trunk of the car.

                                  JIM
                    Let her go!

      Koblenz looks up to see Jim approaching.

                                    KOBLENZ
                    Sorry.  She s my insurance policy 
                    for getting out of here.

                                  JIM
                    I m warning you!  You don t have a 
                    partner to stop me this time --          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  53.

                                    KOBLENZ
                    Who says I ever did?

      Koblenz smiles.  Suddenly, he DISAPPEARS and MATERIALIZES 
      behind Jim.  Jim turns -- ANOTHER KOBLENZ, as the previous 
      one VAPORIZES.  Jim is stunned.

      Koblenz has the POWER of TELEPORTATION -- instantaneously and 
      seamlessly, he can MOVE HIS BODY ANYWHERE (like hitting 
         Hyperspace  in a game of Asteroids).  Jim REALIZES there 
      only was ONE KOBLENZ back in the alley.  But he s special.  

      Koblenz FIRES HIS GUN -- BANG!  But Jim DEFLECTS the bullet.  
      Then... another Koblenz APPEARS... FIRES; again Jim SWATS it 
      away.  The CYCLE continues -- as Koblenz TELEPORTS around, in 
      front of, behind, and above Jim.  SHOOTING... Jim deflecting.

                                    KOBLENZ (CONT D)
                    What?  You thought you were the 
                    only one?

      KOBLENZ FINALLY APPEARS directly behind JIM.  The GUN pressed 
      directly to JIM S HEAD --  Before Jim can respond, Koblenz 
      COCKS the GUN.

                                    KOBLENZ (CONT D)
                    Last time we met, I didn t kill 
                    you, but then again, I shot you 
                    from four feet away.  I m guessing 
                    this bullet goes a little deeper. 

                                  JIM
                    Why are you like this?

                                    KOBLENZ
                    Don t you know?  You and me, we re 
                    not --

      But before Koblenz can say another word -- BANG!  Jim 
      flinches, but --

      KOBLENZ DROPS to the ground, DEAD.  Jim, STUNNED, looks up to 
      see YVONNE -- fresh from the jimmied trunk -- holding a GUN.  

                                  JIM
                    Thanks.
                          (then, tentatively)
                    Um.  How much did you see?  

                                  YVONNE
                    What are you talking about?  I see 
                    a sketch artist trying to be a 
                    hero.  Go.  Or you ll be explaining 
                    yourself to the Police Board.

      Jim, appreciative, takes off.  As Yvonne thinks, we re...          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  54.


      ON THE TV -- LIVE COVERAGE continues with VIDEO of YVONNE 
      being led out of the building, freed.

      REVERSE onto Stephanie, now with Daphne and JJ, watching.  
      Then the FRONT DOOR HANDLE turns.  They turn to see -- Jim.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Thank God.

      Stephanie moves to him, hugs him.  As do the kids.  Jim holds 
      them close.  Then...

                                  STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                          (to Daphne and JJ)
                    Guys.  If your father and I could 
                    have a minute.

      They nod, exit.  Stephanie and Jim remain.  A beat, then...

                                  STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                    Jim.  You were enough for me from 
                    the first moment we met.  Okay... 
                    the second moment.  But if this is 
                    what you need to feel special, I 
                    can t ask you to give that up.

                                  JIM
                    I keep thinking about when we met. 
                    About that couple on the beach. 
                    We re different now.  In all sorts 
                    of ways.  But we can be them again. 
                    If you want to... 

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Do you want to?
                          (he smiles, nods)
                    Me, too.

      He reaches out and gently strokes her face.

                                  JIM (V.O.)
                    And so, after the onset of the 
                      extraordinary, we were left with 
                    questions that any family might 
                    face.


      As they lie in bed, side-by-side.  Awake.

                                  JIM (V.O.)
                    Can we start over together?          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  55.


      IN THE HALLWAY -- Daphne watches Lucas walk down the hall 
      with Lindsay.  But his eyes WANDER back to Daphne... she 
      averts her gaze, not wanting to hear anything.

                                  STEPHANIE (V.O.)
                    Why am I this way?


      JJ, sitting at his desk, awaiting the start of the exam.

                                  JIM (V.O.)
                    Am I special enough to be loved?

                                  CLASSMATE
                          (to JJ)
                    Dude.  You study for this?

                                  JJ
                          (lost cause)
                    Why bother?

      JJ opens the test, begins.  Algebraic equations. He starts to 
      scrawl his answers when... almost by divine intervention...

                                  STEPHANIE (V.O.)
                    Questions with answers we might not 
                    expect.

      ...WHEN JJ SUDDENLY WRITES A FLUENT, COMPLEX EQUATION.  He s 
      stunned.  As are we.  What The Fu--???  

                                  STEPHANIE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    But answers we ll continue to 
                    search for.


      As a GUST of WIND blows through the lab... ultimately 
      REVEALING Stephanie, hard at work.  Katie points to her 
      BULLETIN BOARD, where her papers remain undisturbed.

                                  KATIE
                          (her solution!)
                      Push-pins.

      Then... Stephanie looks up from her MICROSCOPE.  

                                  STEPHANIE
                            (significantly)
                    My blood.  I m not sure why it 
                    didn t appear sooner, but it s the 
                    most extreme case of translocation 
                    I ve ever seen.          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  56.

                                  KATIE
                          (peering into the scope)
                    I ve never seen anything like that 
                    before...

                                  STEPHANIE
                    I have.

      As Katie looks back at her...

                                  JIM (V.O.)
                    With faithful friends by our side.


      Stephanie sits on a couch.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    But you asked us how we got here, 
                    so... did I leave anything out?

      WIDEN TO REVEAL Jim sitting next to her.

                                  JIM
                    No, I think you hit all the 
                      highlights.

      WIDEN AGAIN to REVEAL Daphne and JJ, alongside.

                                  DAPHNE
                    You didn t have to tell him the 
                    part about Lucas.

                                  JJ
                    Or make me seem retarded.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    I m sorry.  But we were just trying 
                    to be accurate --          No Ordinary Family - Fourth Network Draft - 1/20/10  57.

      REVERSE onto DR. ALLEN, the stunned family therapist.

                                  JIM
                    We brought along the whole fam -- 
                    given everything that s happened... 
                    figured it couldn t hurt.  But this 
                    is all confidential, right?  Doctor-
                    patient thing?

                                  DR. ALLEN
                    Yes.  Of course...  Although I m a 
                    little curious why you re here.  
                    Because if it s to understand these 
                    so-called abilities of yours, I 
                    can t be of much help.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    No.  We re here because we want to 
                    work.  Not just as a couple.  But 
                    as a family.

      Jim nods in agreement.  Then...

                                  DR. ALLEN
                    We ve got our work cut out for us.  
                    Might I recommend we start with 
                    twice a week?

      And as Dr. Allen dives into the task of helping our family 
      navigate their lives, both extraordinary and unfailingly 
      human, we DISSOLVE TO --
