          The candy aisle.  Seven year old TOBEY (carrying a small*
          plastic football) scans the awesome array before him. *
          Until a spit-covered finger comes into frame and pokes*
          into his ear.*

                                        TOBEY*
                        Stop it!*

          He swats away the hand of smiling MICKEY, ten... scooting*
          away down the aisle...

                                        TOBEY*
                          Mom...!*

          But he stops face to face with a  wire magazine rack filled*
          with tabloids.  The one before him bears the headline*
          (among others) "Psychic Smith: Savior or False Prophet?!" 
            Accompanying, an unflattering photo of Johnny with an
          angry red pentagram drawn on his forehead.  Jennifer Lopez
          is also on the cover.  Tilting up in a POV shot to see
          JOHNNY grabbing a large bottle of soda from the
            refrigerator...

          Tobey turns to his brother, eyes wide: it's him!  The guy*
          on the magazine cover.  Mickey grabs the front copy of*
          the rag and looks up at Johnny and down at the pic to
          confirm this sighting.


          ANGLE WITH JOHNNY

          Johnny is immediately aware of the four eyes staring at*
          him (Tobey is scared, Mickey intrigued)... and it's not
          like you ever get used to this but this isn't new to Johnny
          any more... he smiles and nods an acknowledgement hoping
          that'll be enough... but as he moves away around a corner
          and out of view of the kids, leans down to grab a bag of
          potato chips from the bottom shelf, the two boys appear*
          around the aisle at his face level... Mickey is still*
          holding the tabloid...

                                        JOHNNY
                        How ya doing?

                        Cool.

                        Shut up...

          Johnny moves away toward the checkout stand... Mickey
          pursues...

                                        MICKEY
                        Hey, Johnny, did you really predict*
                        'J-Lo's failed romance' like it
                        says?

                                        WOMAN'S VOICE
                        Hey!

          The clerk begins to ring up Johnny who would just like to
          get out of here... the kids jump a mile.  They turn to
          see their MOTHER behind them, glaring.

                                        MOTHER
                        How many times have I told you
                        not to talk to...

          But as she glances at Johnny, she immediately recognizes
          him... her face turns fearful for a second before she can
          regain her social mask...

                                        MOTHER
                                (beat)

                        out in a minute.

          She nods uncomfortably to Johnny and disappears around an*
          aisle to quickly finish her shopping...*

                                        MICKEY

                        I bet he doesn't even know Jennifer

                                (beat)
                        Lo.

          The clerk doesn't get the joke... gives Johnny his change. *
          Johnny looks at the bizarre picture of himself on the
          tabloid cover, decides to turn the magazine over, and as*
          he does we RAMP to his face...*



          Reacting.*



          already running out the door...*



          CRASH!  The ER doors explode inward as Johnny, conscious
          but sedated, is wheeled in on a gurney, a cervical collar
          round his neck.  The EMTs hand Johnny off to an E-R DOCTOR 
          who immediately checks the EMTs' clipboard as a nurse
          puts an IV in Johnny's arm.  The doc shouts out orders:

                                        E-R DOCTOR
                        Get a CBC, Chem 20, Pt, Ptt and
                        type and cross him for six units. 
                        Get D-dimers and fibrinogen, too.
                                (checks blood pressure)
                        Oh, boy.  BP is 80 palp.  Heart
                        rate 130 and very thready.  I
                        think he's going into DIC.  I
                        need six units of Cryo, stat!

          A nurse pulls away from the moving medical center, rushes
          towards a door in the ER.  WE follow her.  Sign on the
          door reads BLOOD BANK.



          She arrives back at Johnny's gurney as the team shifts
          him over to a table.

                                        E-R DOCTOR
                        Okay, hang the saline and Cryo
                        and infuse wide open.  Repeat the
                        CBC.  Repeat all the labs...

          The nurse piggybacks a large bag of saline and a smaller
          100cc bag of a cloudy, yellow-white liquid onto the IV.


          CLOSE - THE CLOUDY LIQUID

          flows into the clear IV.  It streams down the IV, heading
          for Johnny's arm.  And as it hits...

                                                                              FADE OUT:

          The world is blurry, slowly focusing.  A circular mass in
          the center slowly reveals itself to be Bruce's face, as
          the focus sharpens.  He's looking right at us.  Smiling.

          JOHNNY lies in a hospital bed, slowly waking, looking up
          at Bruce.  His face is slightly bruised, arms bandaged. 
          Other than that, he doesn't look so bad.  But his
          expression is pained...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I will be sued for it.   

          Johnny suddenly feels odd, not a headache exactly but
          sort of like a vertigo feeling... nothing too radical but
          it makes him catch his breath as we RAMP to his face and
          he sees a vision of the recent past...  



          Johnny is lying on a cot wearing out-of-fashion clothes
          in a large, clean canvas tent.  He glances down at the
          needle and tube in his arm, and the stream of red flowing
          through it.  He's donating blood.  In the background, a
          desk calendar indicates the date is November 14th.

          He looks to the person giving blood in the cot next to
          him.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL that one cot over... is Johnny. 
          Johnny #2, wearing khaki pants and a bright yellow polo
          shirt, smiles back at Johnny #1.

          DOLLY OVER TO REVEAL another cot, with another Johnny! 
          This one wears torn black jeans and a black T-shirt.  He
          grimaces as a NEEDLE in stuck into his arm.

          In fact, the whole place is filled with Johnnies!  Six of
          them, to be precise, along with two nurses (who are not
          Johnny).  One Johnny (in a fancy suit) sits on a cot
          filling out forms, while two more Johnnies, one in ragged
            clothing, and one in women's clothing, lie on their cots. 

          (Note: Johnny, in the vision, is not self-aware.  In other
          words, his actions or expressions cannot comment on the
          scene.  Also, a reminder: Johnny never uses his cane in a
          vision.)  The vision ends.



          Johnny is utterly stunned.  Never seen anything like it.

                                        BRUCE
                        Let me guess: you saw a six figure
                          out-of-court settlement...

          Bruce reacts and starts to leave...

          attractive DR. JANET GIBSON, 33.  This is Johnny's new
            neurologist, a specialist with a dry sense of humor and a
          good heart.  She sees a lot of people with grim prognoses
          so someone like Johnny, a miracle kid, is a welcome change
          for her.  She enjoys exploring the mysteries of his mind. 
          She can't wait for him to come back with some new problem.

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        Why does every doctor insist on
                        shining a light in my eyes?  I
                        don't see these things with my
                        eyes...

          She finishes... moving back to see Bruce observing...

                                        DR. GIBSON
                        Your eyes don't know that.  I can
                        always detect pupillary fluctuation
                        after you've had a vision...

          She looks at the chart... smiles, chuckles... Johnny looks
          at Bruce curiously... (and they're saying this with her
          in earshot so she's in on the conversation...)

                                        JOHNNY
                        She's laughing at my chart, Bruce. 
                        Why is she laughing?

                                        BRUCE
                                (for her benefit,
                                  ribbing her)
                        Dr. Gibson is famous around the
                          hospital for her twisted sense of
                        humor.        

          She continues to chuckle, shakes her head with amusement...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Now she's shaking her head and
                          laughing.  This is not good.

                                        DR. GIBSON
                        Good?  You're a walking laboratory
                        of the mind, Johnny Smith.

                        I think you're about to have the
                        most interesting month of your 
                        life.

                        That sounds a lot like a Chinese
                        curse I heard once. 

                                        DR. GIBSON
                        When your insides were battered
                        around in the accident, you
                          developed DIC -- Disseminated
                          Intravascular Coagulation, it
                        just means that, temporarily,
                        your blood wasn't clotting like
                        it should.  So you were given
                          Cryoprecipitate which gets your
                          clotting back on track.  Cryo is
                          a pooled blood product made from
                        plasma.  The amount you received
                        would have come from six or so
                          different people.

                        Truly amazing.

          Maybe for her... but Johnny doesn't like the sound of it
          at all... and as we push in on his face...

                                        DR. GIBSON (O.S.)
                        Now, I want you to keep a
                        journal... every time you have a
                        vision, make an entry with time
                        and date... don't even think about

          It's the alarm clock.  Johnny's hand slaps down on it,
          turning it off.  He opens his eyes.  Kicks his feet over
          the side of the bed... (Note: Johnny is about 90% recovered
          by now.)

                                        JOHNNY
                          Morning, everyone.

          He yawns, stretches... and as he does he feels a vision
          coming on... as we begin a sequence that will introduce
          us to the players in our scenario.  In each vision, Johnny
          finds himself in the role of the person who gave blood...



          stands there with a notebook and pen.  He is being berated
          by his boss.  We will learn that JONAH is an aspiring
          writer who has dreams of being the next Stephen King. 
          But for now, he is a miserable clerk in a bookstore. (It's
            important to note that Johnny doesn't know Jonah or anyone
          else by name; the names are included here for clarity and
          tracking.)  Johnny/Jonah is dressed in a bright yellow
          polo shirt and khakis.  The MANAGER of the store has a
          jacket and tie.

                                        MANAGER
                        What, you don't like this job?
                        You don't want to work here...?

          The vision ends (that is, this shouldn't suggest the
          scenario is continuing in Johnny's mind concurrently.)           DEAD ZONE: PRECIPITATE - ACT ONE - REV. 9/25/02 WHT2  12.



          sighs... stands... as he puts on his slippers... walks

          But he feels the vision starting again... pulling him
          back to --

                        right about now.  Don't let me

          Johnny realizes he's out of the vision... shakes his head,
          moves toward the bathroom...



          Johnny is dressed, sitting and eating a prune Danish,
          sipping a cup of coffee and reading the morning paper
          when the next vision interrupts and he's --



            Johnny/FATTY is sitting in a snazzy pinstripe suit, an
          even snazzier tie (one of those multi-colored Versace
          ties that somehow screams tacky and money at the same
          time) that is slung over his shoulder to avoid drips.  He
          scarfs an oyster, slurping it down... the vision ends.

          is standing in her bathroom... wearing a floral-print

          right hand -- a Precise Home Pregnancy Test.  In the
          results window is a dark blue check mark.  Johnny/Shari's
          head falls forward in despair.

          Gong!  The clock strikes a second time. 



                                        JOHNNY
                        Who...?


  4242VISION

          Knees now, hands, too, as people lean in to help...

          The clock rings a third time: GONG.

                                        FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Someone call 9-1-1.

                                        MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        It's too late for that.



          Johnny reacts, rushes to the phone.  Dials.

                                (into phone)
                        Bruce, get over here.  I need
                        your car...  
                                (beat)
                        ...Because at three o'clock today,
                        one of me is going to die.

                                              ACT TWO

          FADE IN:


          Johnny and Bruce are with NURSE PARK, a feisty, dedicated
          red cross nurse filing forms and doing other pressing
            business.  They follow her...

                                        NURSE PARK
                        I can't give you that information,
                        Mr. Smith.  The Red Cross has
                        strict confidentiality rules. 
                        Anyone who gives blood is
                        guaranteed privacy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You don't understand, I've been
                        living with these people for weeks,
                        they're a part of me... I can't
                        let one of them die...

          That's a strange speech and she gives him a strange
          reaction...

                                        BRUCE
                        Can we deal here... you need blood,
                        we need names...

          He holds his arm out ready to donate.  Nurse Park glares
          at him...

                                        BRUCE
                        That... probably... was a bad
                          suggestion, wasn't it.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        Look, I know they all gave blood
                        the same day - November 14th - at
                        the same bloodmobile...

                                        NURSE PARK
                        Now how would you know that?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I just do...   

                                        NURSE PARK
                                (shaking her head in
                                  disbelief)
                        I don't even have access to those
                          records.

          Johnny reacts as a quick vision engulfs him...          DEAD ZONE: PRECIPITATE - ACT TWO - REV. 9/20/02 GREEN  20.


    4545JOHNNY/FATTY - CLOSE-UP

          scarfs down an oyster... 


  4646RESUME JOHNNY

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to Bruce)
                        Oyster.  What if he ate a bad
                        oyster?  People die from food
                          poisoning sometimes, don't they?

          The nurse reacts to this non-sequitur display with
          controlled alarm...

                                        NURSE PARK
                          You'll... have to contact senior
                        management with this.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        We don't have time for that...
                                (beat)
                        Someone who helped save my life
                        is going to die today if I don't
                        do something...

          She looks at him, looks at Bruce - is he for real?

                                        BRUCE
                        This is where I usually say: listen
                        to the man...

          If only to end this --

                                        NURSE PARK
                          November 14th...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (hopeful)
                        Yes.

                                        NURSE PARK
                                (sighs)
                        I can tell you where the
                          bloodmobile was on the day your
                        donors gave blood but that's the
                        best I can do.  

          As she moves to the files and flips through papers...

                                        NURSE PARK (CONT'D)

                        County, Guilford Town Square.

          As they start to leave...

                        The appointment sheet is on the
                        desk.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Appointment sheet?

                                        NURSE PARK
                                (she gives Bruce a
                                sharp look)
                          I believe you were inquiring about
                          donating...? 

                                        BRUCE
                        Right.  Right.

          He moves to sign up... she looks at Johnny...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'd donate but... I'm pregnant.



          is working when he hears a woman softly crying... he looks
          over the divider to see Johnny/Shari sitting there, she
          wears a blouse with a giraffe pattern...

                                        JOHNNY/BOB
                        Are you... can I... do anything?



          Johnny finds MORT, the biggest homeless man ever -- the
          Grizzly Adams of the street set.  This is not a well man...
          he sits exhausted leaning against a building... his
            'veteran' sign is set down beside him...

                                        MORT
                        Spare some change, sir?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I heard you coughing.

          And like a man who's used to being chased, he just assumes
          the worst...

                                        MORT
                        What?  Hey, I'll just move along. 
                        No bother.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, wait.

          Mort looks at this guy - what's your problem, man?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Here, here's some money.

          Mort watches as he takes out his wallet... and several
          twenties...

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's all yours.  Under one
                          condition...

                                        MORT
                                (is this about sex?)
                        Look, I don't want no trouble... 

                                        JOHNNY
                        ...That you let me take you to a
                        doctor.

    54CONTINUED:54

                                        MORT
                        I'm fine... if I could just have
                        enough for a bowl of soup...

                                        JOHNNY
                              (a beat)
                        I'm worried about you.

          And if it seems to us and to Mort that there's a strange
          intimacy in this scene, good, because for Johnny there
          is... Mort doesn't trust him for a second... he studies
          him for a beat then...

                                        MORT
                        Why would someone like you be
                        worried about someone like me?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (glancing at his sign)
                        You fought for your country, didn't
                        you?  Isn't that reason enough to
                        care?

                                        MORT
                        I can name you a couple of
                        Presidents who didn't care.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's your name?

                                        MORT
                                  (suspicious)
                        Mort.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Did you sell some blood to the
                        red cross a few weeks ago, Mort?

                                        MORT
                                  (defensive)
                        There's nothing wrong with my
                        blood.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know.

                                        MORT
                          I wasn't sick then... And I didn't
                        sell it!  I donated it because
                        the country's in a war, you know? 
                        We need blood.

                          Sixty-something bucks and some

                        There's a clinic I go to sometimes
                        down the block.

                        Come on.

          As Johnny leads the way...



          On the door as Johnny enters... and his face falls as he
          sees a half dozen clerks and workers... all of them wearing
          bright yellow polo shirts and khakis.  It's the store
          uniform.  Off his reaction...



          He moves around the tables... it's well attended by
          businessmen wearing ties... who glance up as Bruce
            passes... a lot of oysters being served...

                                        BRUCE
                        Oh man... define bad tie... they
                        all look bad... whole lot of bad
                        ties here...

          Sees one that is awful enough to be right... the
          businessman catching Bruce staring...

                                        BRUCE
                        ...just admiring your tie...

          A waitress puts down salmon in front of the man... that
          rules him out...

                        Say, the salmon looks good today...
                        I might have to give that a...

            Suddenly, the bike races by in front...

                                        BRUCE
                          Hey...!!

          He takes off after the messenger... but then pauses turns
          back and yells to the whole restaurant...

                                        BRUCE
                          Whatever you do: Don't eat the
                          oysters!!

          And he tears off after the messenger, gone.  In his wake,
          all the customers look at their oysters with new eyes and
          slowly begin to push plates away...  The waiters react...

          WITH BRUCE

          as he runs past a fat man wearing a tie we've seen before
          in Johnny's visions and as we stay with Fatty, he walks
          into the seafood restaurant...



          Johnny is moving deeper into the store, trying to guess
          which one of the yellow-shirted clerks is his guy... when
          he hears a voice he recognizes and a conversation he's
          heard before in a vision --

                                        MANAGER (O.S.)
                          ...yeah, yeah, you want to write
                        books, not sell them.  Sure, Mr.
                        Stephen King should be very worried
                        right about now.  Don't let me
                        catch you again in the stockroom
                        writing your dumb stories,
                          understand?  Go help our customers
                        find some real books.

          A moment later, JONAH the book clerk, 22, over-skinny and
          over-tired, the portrait of a stressed out struggling
          novelist emerges from the book stacks... followed a beat
          later by the manager who moves away... Johnny pretends to
          be browsing with some books for a moment... as he studies
          Jonah a beat then...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Scuse me...

                                        JONAH
                        Can I help you find what you're
                        looking for, sir?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (glances at Jonah's
                                  nameplate)
                        I'm looking for you... Jonah.

          Jonah reacts.  Me?  What can he be talking about?  Johnny
          tries to ease into his explanation...

                                        JOHNNY
                        My name is Johnny Smith.  I'm
                        a...

                                        JONAH
                          Psychic!  No way!  I totally know
                        who you are!  I've read all about
                        you.  Your visions.  Very cool.

          Fatty sitting at his table as we saw in act three.  A
          waiter places a plate of oysters on the halfshell in front
          of him.  As he's about to eat, a passing hand reaches out
          and grabs the plate and carries it away... Fatty looks up
          to see a man with a cane quickly walking away with his
          oysters... in a moment, he is gone...



          Johnny enters, scans for Jonah.  Not finding him, he
          approaches the Manager.

                                        MANAGER
                        I have those books wrapped and
                        ready for you, sir.

                        Where's Jonah?

                        Jonah doesn't work here anymore.

                        You fired him?!

                                        BOOKSTORE MANAGER
                        He quit.  The kid's a wannabe
                        writer - he got another rejection
                        letter just after you left and
                        that was that...

          Johnny is gone before the Manager has a chance to finish.          DEAD ZONE: PRECIPITATE - ACT FOUR - REV. 9/27/02 YEL2  47.
