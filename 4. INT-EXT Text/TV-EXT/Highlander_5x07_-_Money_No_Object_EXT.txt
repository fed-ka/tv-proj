      GRAFFITI screams from the walls.  HOMELESS push shopping
      carts overflowing with the debris of other people's lives. 
      Hope, like Elvis, has definitely left the building.

      VRRROOOM!

      -- a motorcycle screams by with two riders.  A WOMAN'S LAUGH
      drifts back, on a trail of exhaust.


      A shining bastion of international commerce.  Garish red and
      yellow signs proclaim "CHECKS CASHED" in more languages than
      Saturday afternoon cable access.

      The bike ROARS up to the curb and stops.  It's Richie.

                                      RICHIE
                    You gotta be joking.

                                      AMANDA (O.S.)
                    I never joke about money.  Especially
                    when it's mine.

      Amanda pops her head up from behind Richie's shoulder.  She
      looks over at the store.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    Besides, the place has atmosphere.

      Richie sniffs the air, wrinkles his nose.

                                      RICHIE
                    Yeah.  I can smell it from here. 
                    What's wrong with a regular bank?

      Amanda swings herself off the bike.

                                      AMANDA
                      Unfortunately, dear boy, regular
                    banks are full of sad little men who
                    would insist on knowing all the dreary
                    little details of my overseas money
                    transfer.

                                      RICHIE
                    So?

      Amanda gestures toward the store.

                                      AMANDA
                    Behold the "Temple of No Questions
                    Asked."

                                      RICHIE
                    Amanda, that's called fraud.

                                      AMANDA
                    It's called C.Y.A.
                          (off his look)
                    Cover your assets.

      She heads for the front door.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    Coming?

      Richie casts a wary glance up and down the street.

                                      RICHIE
                    I'd better stay with my bike.


      At a corner food stand, Richie trades SOUVLAKI SAM two bucks
      for Indigestion on a Stick.  He's about to take a tentative
      bite when Cory explodes out the front door of the check
      cashing place pulling Amanda behind him.  She's yelling with
      excitement.

                                      AMANDA
                    Yeeeee!

      From down the street Richie sees the masked man, the gun,
      Amanda screaming -- puts two and two together.  He drops his
      lunch and rushes to her rescue.

                                      RICHIE
                    Hey!!!

      Cory swivels toward the noise, his Tommy Gun BARKING BULLETS
      into the air.

                                    CORY
                    Stay back!  Everybody!

      Souvlaki Sam SCREAMS.  Richie hits the dirt.  So do the rest
      of the PASSERSBY, obviously familiar with the duck and cover
      two-step.

      Cory and Amanda dash up to a VAN.  He pulls open the side
      door, shoves Amanda in and jumps in after her.

      Richie's on his feet again and pounding the pavement --

                                      RICHIE
                    Amanda!!!

      As the van BURNS RUBBER and disappears down a side street.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    Amanda!!!

                                          ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      The van speeds down the road, quickly leaving the city behind.

                                      AMANDA & CORY (O.S.)
                      Yeeeehaaaaw!


      Cory takes a side road on two wheels and pulls up into a
      clearing.


      Cory wipes down the van for fingerprints.

                                      AMANDA
                    Since when were you so careful?

                                    CORY
                    Since forensics got better.  Gettin'
                    hard for an honest man to make a
                    dishonest living these days.

      He glances at his watch, looks over to Amanda.

                                    CORY (CONT'D)
                    Don't just stand there, we're two
                    minutes behind schedule already.

                                      AMANDA
                    We?  I'm just an innocent bystander.

                                    CORY
                    Don't kid yourself, sister.  Minute
                    you jumped in the van, you became an
                      accomplice.

      Cory walks up to her, feels the heat of her excitement.

                                    CORY (CONT'D)
                    You and me, together again. Look at
                    you.  Your cheeks are flushed.  You
                    love it.

                                      AMANDA
                          (tries to play it
                            cool)
                    Merely a metabolic surge in reaction
                    to external stimuli.

      Cory crosses to a large TARP under a tree.  With a magician's
      flourish, he whips off the tarp revealing a glittering 1924
      PACKARD.  Mint condition.

      Amanda loses her cool.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    The twenty-four Packard! I don't
                    believe it.

      Cory glances suggestively from the car to Amanda.

                          (eyeing Amanda)
                    I've always appreciated the
                      distinctive allure of a classy
                    chassis.

                                      AMANDA
                    You silver-tongued devil.

      Opening the passenger door, he puts out a gallant hand.

                                    CORY
                    Your chariot awaits, my queen.


      Sopping wet and coveted with mud, Richie drags his crippled
      bike up the embankment.  He stands in the road, surveying
      the damage.

                                      RICHIE
                          (pissed)
                    Someone's gonna pay.

      He hears a car approaching.  He steps into the road, tries
      to wave it down.

      RICHIE'S POV

      A 1924 Packard GRILLE roaring towards him at warp speed. 
      It's speeding up.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                          (resigned)
                    Damn.

      THWACK!

      He bounces off the hood, up into the air and back flips down
      into the muddy stream.  Again.


                                      RICHIE (O.S.)
                            (frustrated)
                    There's got to be something else we
                    can do.


      MacLeod and Richie creep stealthily around a bush, working
      their way towards a large log cabin.  Rustic but ritzy, cedar
      deck, hot tub, and a 1924 Packard in the lane.

                                      RICHIE
                    This is it.

      They slink along a row of bushes and up alongside the Packard. 
      MacLeod fingers a fresh DENT in the hood.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I see you made a good impression.

                                      RICHIE
                    Very funny.

      MacLeod and Richie share a look, move off toward the cabin.


      Summer air shimmers in the heat.  Sun-scorched wheat fields
      stretch to the horizon. The only crop this year -- dust.

      ZOOM!

      Bisecting this beige wasteland, a cherry red ROADSTER blazes
      through FRAME.


      Amanda and MacLeod are driving along.

                                      AMANDA
                    How much you think he made?

                                      MACLEOD
                    He didn't make it, he stole it.

                                      AMANDA:
                    Picky, picky.

      They react to the BUZZ and turn and see

      THEIR POV

        A ramshackle single story farmhouse.  A tractor skeleton
      lies rusting nearby.  An ancient truck stands out front
      overflowing with the family s possessions, next to Cory s
      roadster.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Why?

      On the front porch, Cory is handing out some of the stolen
      money to a poor young FARMER and his WIFE while their three
        malnourished CHILDREN look on.  Dressed in rags, they have
      the gaunt, bleak faces of people who gave up hope a long
      time ago.

                                      FARMER
                    We'll never forget you for this, Mr.
                    Cory.

      Cory finishes handing out the money and receives a grateful
      handshake from the Farmer and a big hug from his Wife.

      As Amanda's roadster pulls up, Cory turns to it.

                    again.  A new life.

      Cory plays it up.  He puts a hand on his heart.  MacLeod's
      not buying.

                                      MACLEOD

                    took all the bank's money.  They've
                    got lots left.

      MacLeod points out the remaining money in Cory's bag.

                                      MACLEOD
                    And so do you.

                    Try thinking of me as the Robin Hood
                    of the Roaring Twenties.

      MacLeod can't help but like Cory, but he knows he's an
      accident waiting to happen.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Well, I got news for you, Robin. 
                    This isn't Sherwood Forest.  And
                    you're not robbing the rich.  You're
                    stealing from banks.  Banks that

      While MacLeod and Cory talk, the Farmer tries to start the
      vehicle.  He fails.

      The Farmer's Wife sags against the truck, their new-found
      hope snatched away again.

      Cory sighs.  Looks at the truck, looks at his roadster.  He
      makes a decision.

                    Take care of her and she'll take
                    care of you.

      The Farmer can't believe his good luck.

                                      FARMER
                    Thank you.  Thank you.

                                      AMANDA
                    Cory, that was the most unselfish
                    thing I've ever seen.

                                    CORY
                    Thanks, Amanda.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (with a half smile)
                    Now I suppose you'll be wanting a
                    lift?

      Cory slaps MacLeod jovially on the back.

                                    CORY
                    I knew you'd come around!

                          (resigned)
                    C'mon, Robin... get in.
                          (to the Farmer)
                    If I were you, I'd switch the plates
                    before you hit the main road.  She's
                    probably a little hot.

                                    CORY
                    A minor detail, Mackie-boy.  A minor
                    detail.

      And as MacLeod gives Amanda an "I told you so" look, they
      head off down the lane.


      Just your typical pastoral scene -- sun shining, birds
      chirping, three Immortals speeding through the countryside
      in a red roadster.

      Amanda points up ahead.

                                      AMANDA
                    Uh-oh.

      MacLeod strains to see.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Uh-oh.

      Cory peeks around.

                                    CORY
                    Oh brother.

      There's a ROADBLOCK dead ahead.  Three police cars block the
      way through.  MacLeod starts a U-turn.  Too late.

      POLICE swarm out of the trees on either side of the road,
      effectively blocking any escape.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Look's like this is the end of the
                    party.

      Amanda glances in the back seat.

                                      AMANDA
                    This definitely doesn't look good.

      Cory's not fazed at all.  If anything, he's a little
        disappointed in his new playmates.

                                    CORY
                    Oh, please.  Where's your sense of
                      adventure?

      The CORDON of Police closes in.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Right now, I'd say it's looking at
                    ten to twenty years behind bars.

                                    CORY
                    Don't worry.  I always got a plan.

      Silence.  MacLeod and Amanda are waiting.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Now would be a good time.

                                    CORY
                    Okay.  I got it.  You're my hostages,
                    see?

                    You didn't have anything to do with
                    the robbery.
                          (warms to it)
                    Yeah, that's it!  And you two get
                    off scott free.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What about you?

                                    CORY
                    I'll be waiting for you guys to dig
                    me up.

      MacLeod and Amanda exchange looks... "Dig him up...?"

      In a flash, Cory's out of the car, wielding his Tommy Gun. 
      He sprays the air with hot lead, then he points his gun at
      the car.

                                    CORY (CONT'D)
                    Freeze or I blast these hostages
                    into swiss cheese!

      Everybody freezes.  MacLeod and Amanda raise their hands. 
      Cory points the gun at the cops.  He moves toward them
      threateningly.

                                    CORY (CONT'D)
                    You'll never take me alive, coppers!

      Like shooting a well-dressed fish in a barrel, the Police
      open fire and Cory goes down in a hail of bullets.

      As several Cops crowd around his lifeless body.  Amanda and
      MacLeod get out of the car.

                                      AMANDA
                    Thank God you shot that horrible
                    man!  He threatened to kill us!

      As an OFFICER approaches, MacLeod pulls her head down onto
      his shoulder, comforts her.

                                      MACLEOD
                    There, there, dear.  It's all over.


      MacLeod and Amanda are digging up a pauper's grave.  MacLeod's
      working, Amanda leans on her shovel.

                                      AMANDA
                    Can't we dig any faster?

                    "We?"

      MacLeod's shovel strikes wood.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    About time.

      He starts to work on the coffin lid.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    You know, it'd serve him right...

                                      AMANDA
                    MacLeod!  Don't even think about it.

      OFF her look he pries open the lid, revealing Cory inside. 
      A shaft of sunlight strikes his face and his eyes pop open.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    Cory?

      MacLeod bends over to lend a hand, but Cory's up and out of
      the grave like a jack-in-the-box.

                                    CORY
                    For a minute there I thought you
                    guys weren't coming.

      He dusts himself off.

                                      AMANDA
                          (eyeing MacLeod)

                    Speak for yourself.

      Cory thinks he must be joking, slaps him on the back.

                                    CORY
                    Guy's a riot.  Listen, I got an idea. 
                    What do you say we run this same
                    racket all over the country!

      Amanda starts to catch on.

                                      AMANDA
                    That's brilliant.

                    It's stupid.

                                    CORY
                    We'd make a fortune.

                    Of course we will.  Then we just die
                    and start over.

                    You want me to go without you?

                    fun.

      MacLeod watches as Amanda and Cory pull out of the graveyard.

      Amanda turns to look back, something in her eyes pleading
      with MacLeod to stop her.  But he stays strong.  Hat pushed
      back, jacket slung over his shoulder, MacLeod just watches
      them drive away -- finally, the roadster becomes a dot on
      the horizon.

      With a last look down at the now-empty grave, MacLeod turns
      and heads down the road the other way.

      WIDEN TO REVEAL

      Cory hunched under the hood of a SAAB.  He sucks on his burned
      fingers.

                                    CORY (CONT'D)

      BACK TO SCENE

      as CORY watches from behind cover.  He scans up and down the
      intersection.  The BUZZ.  He half-turns, calls softly --

                                    CORY
                    Doll face... ?

      BAM!!!  His answer is a FIST in the mouth.  Reeling back,
      Cory comes face to face with MacLeod.

                                    CORY (CONT'D)
                    MacLeod, what was that for?
                          (beat)
                    Where's Amanda?

      BAM!!!  MacLeod lets loose again.  He's pissed.

                                      MACLEOD
                    She's been arrested.  Thanks to you.

      Sensing another impending blow, Cory puts up his hands in
      surrender.

                                    CORY
                    Let's talk this thing out, okay? 
                    What do you mean arrested?  Where?

                                      MACLEOD

                    Damn!

      He glances toward the ticking Saab.

                                    CORY (CONT'D)
                    This does put a kink in things.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm gonna put a kink in your ass!

      He grabs him by the scruff of the neck.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Right after you help me get her out.

                                    CORY
                    Well, listen, I'd really love to,
                    but we've got us a little situation
                    here.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What situation?

                                    CORY
                    At 8:29 an armored car comes by.

      Cory indicates the Saab.

                                    CORY (CONT'D)
                    And I set the Saab to blow at 8:28.

      At this precise moment, the air is blasted by the strident
      strains of John Philip Souza.

      A HIGH SCHOOL MARCHING BAND swings around the corner. 
      Trombones booming, trumpets blaring, cymbals crashing...
      it's a nightmare of off-key ADOLESCENTS.  A BAND LEADER
      backpedals frantically in front of the band.

      MacLeod looks at Cory.

                                    CORY (CONT'D)
                    Oops.

      BACK TO SCENE

      MacLeod calculates the trajectory of the band.  It's going
      to get to the Saab at exactly the wrong time.

                                      MACLEOD
                    How do you disarm the car?

                                    CORY
                    There's no time.
                            (sheepishly)
                    Disarming the car wasn't in the plan.

      MacLeod snorts his disgust.

                                      MACLEOD
                    The plan.  Give me the keys!

      He grabs the keys and runs to the Saab.  Starts it and peels
      off down the road... in the opposite direction of the marching
      band.

      Cory jumps in MacLeod's car.  No keys -- no problem.  He
      pops the column, hot wires it, roars off after MacLeod.

      The band marches through the intersection, the sound blaring.

      INSERT EXPLOSIVE TIMER

      8:27:09... 8:27:10...


      The Saab slices through the countryside.  MacLeod gives it
      all he's got.  Pedal to the metal.  Detonator on the seat
      beside him counting the seconds... 8:27:15...

                                      MACLEOD
                    C'mon...

      He races against the clock, trying to get as far away from
        civilization as possible... 8:27:30... Thirty seconds left...
      he spots a secluded pullout... screeches in... 8:27:45 ...

      Skidding to a stop, MacLeod reaches for the door handle. It
      comes off in his hand.  He looks at the door handle.  Looks
      at the timer... 8:27:55 ...

      MACLEOD

      gnashes his teeth --

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    I hate him.

      FOOM!!!  The Saab explodes.

      CORY

      sits a hundred yards away in MacLeod's car.  Chunks of singed
      Saab rain down all around him.

                                    CORY (CONT'D)
                    Yowza.

      A particularly large piece of wreckage plummets earthward.

      WHOOOMPH!

      Slams into the dirt right in front of the car.  He peers
      over the windshield.  It's MacLeod.  With half his clothes
      blown off.  Scorched and dead.

      CORY

      winces.

      FADE IN:


      Still prostrate on the ground, an ashen MacLeod slowly wakes
      up.  Cory extends a hand, but gets brushed aside.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Get away from me.

      MacLeod gingerly stands up.

                                      MACLEOD
                    And don't call me Mackie-boy.

      Cory instinctively backs away.

                    Yeah, sure.  No hard feelings, eh?

      MacLeod advances on Cory.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (hisses)
                    You mean, why let a little thing
                    like being blown to bits come between
                    us?

                    think now.  You can't kill me.  You
                    need me to get Amanda out...

      Cory smiles ingratiatingly.  MacLeod knows he's right.  And
      he hates him for it.


      The forlorn BLEAT of a tugboat pierces the eerie stillness. 
      In one end of the yard, a battered aluminum CONSTRUCTION
      TRAILER perches precariously on cement blocks.

                                      AMANDA (O.S.)
                      Peee-yuuu!  What's that horrible
                    stench?  Oh, of course.  It's a rotten
                    cop.


      Close on a VEST wired with EXPLOSIVES and a PLUNGER DETONATOR.

                                    CORY (O.S.)
                    There's got to be another way.

      PULL BACK

      to find MacLeod with Cory.  The vest is on him.

                                    CORY
                    Let's be creative!  Work with me
                    here.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Shut up.
                          (hands him detonator)
                    Here's the plunger.

                                    CORY
                    But it's a fake one, right?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Trust me.  I got a plan.

      He tightens the cinches on the vest, Cory's lungs collapse.

      Richie rounds a corner carrying a briefcase filled with
      "money." He opens the case for MacLeod's inspection.

                                      RICHIE
                    How'd I do?

      MacLeod reaches in, pulls out a stack of "bills" -- actually
      a few real bills on top, pieces of newspaper on the bottom.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    They better not look too close.

                                      MACLEOD
                    They won't have time to.

      He smiles at Cory.

      MacLeod, Amanda and Richie watch the trailer from a distance.

                    Looks like it worked, MacLeod.

      Suddenly Tynan and Gringkov come tearing out of the trailer,
      running for their lives.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Now for the grand finale.

      He reaches into his breast pocket and pulls out a device. 
      It's a wireless ELECTRONIC TRIGGER.

                                      RICHIE
                    You didn't.

      Amanda is shocked --

                                      AMANDA
                    You wouldn't!?

      and a little turned on --

                    Let me.

      He grabs for the detonator.  MacLeod snatches it away.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Uh uh.  This one's all mine.

      He presses the switch and -- BLAAAMM!!

      The construction trailer is airborne.  Like a giant aluminum
      can, it's up, up and away.  And then a shattering CRASH. 
      Flat as a pancake.  Scraps of money and newspaper drift
      through the air.  Nothing left standing.  Well, almost
      nothing.

      Through the smoke and fire, one lone, slightly scorched figure
      staggers out of the wreckage.  It lurches over toward MacLeod.

                                    CORY
                    What the hell was that for?

      Again that frightening smile.
