      1972. Foxworth Hall has been restored to its full glory.  
      Formal gardens boast gleaming statuary.  Ivy creeps up the *
      polished brick walls all the way up to the attic.   

      A WOMAN speaks.  This is CATHY, now an adult, her teenage *
      bitterness since tinged with strength, wisdom.  *

                                  CATHY (V.O.)
                    We were just children when we lost *
                      everything.  Our parents, our *
                    home... our innocence and our hope.  *
                    Once the envy of all our neighbors, *
                    now we were stranded at a bus *
                    depot, thirty dollars in our *
                    pockets and not a prayer in sight.   *

      We see A PLUME OF SMOKE streaming from the dormer windows. 
      Suddenly, the GLASS SHATTERS. ANGRY FLAMES lick at windows 
      and doors, spreading rapidly across the attic and down the 
      stairs.  

                                  CATHY
                    But God was looking out for us.  
                    And we learned to trust again, 
                    believe in second chances-- even 
                    me.  Like a fairy tale princess, 
                    finding her happy ending.  

      The entire estate is engulfed in an UNCONTROLLABLE BLAZE.  
      Soon BLACKENING, COLLAPSING into a charred, unrecognizable 
      heap.

                                  CATHY (V.O.)
                    Or the Phoenix, rising from the 
                    ashes...

      Her V.O. dissolves back to...



        Greenglenna, 1971.  CATHY, 24 and beautiful, is delivering a 
      eulogy for DR. PAUL SHEFFIELD (late 40s), whose kind portrait 
      sits above his closed casket, adorned in yellow flowers.  





                                                                              (CONTINUED)        CONTINUED:22

                                  CATHY
                          (continued from V.O.)
                    ...That s how Dr. Sheffield found 
                    us ten years ago.  Or as Paul liked 
                    to say, when we found each other.  
                    He took us into his home, adopted 
                    us, sent us to the best schools-- 
                    he became the loving father we d 
                    lost.  And well, I only hope we 
                    were the devoted children he d so 
                      desperately wanted.

      She glances at the front row where we see CHRISTOPHER (26) 
      and CARRIE (17).  Christopher s handsome and composed in a 
      well-tailored suit.  Carrie s pretty but remarkably small for 
      her age-- and emotionally fragile, clutching her brother s 
      arm for strength.  Christopher gives a nod of support to 
      Cathy, who continues.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    Paul s gone to a better place now. 
                    I m sure of that.  But we ll never 
                    forget him...     

      Her voice trails off in grief.  A beat as she collects 
      herself, then looks up with a renewed, almost steely 
      determination.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    We will never forget our past.

      TITLE CARD:  PETALS ON THE WIND. 33



      A traditional Southern brick house with overstuffed sofas, 
      eclectic knick-knacks and welcoming veranda-- a far cry from 
      the cold grandeur of Foxworth Hall.  

      Post-funeral, various MOURNERS offer their condolences and 
      casseroles.  A KIND SOUTHERN WOMAN (60s) hands Cathy a *
      covered dish.

                                  WOMAN*
                          (re: casserole)
                    ...Heat this at 350 for 45 minutes, 
                    then at 425 to brown the crust.  *
                    And I like to add an egg wash for 
                    extra sheen...



                                                                              (CONTINUED)        CONTINUED:44

      Cathy looks a bit lost.  Christopher swoops in with Carrie, 
      takes the casserole.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                          (gently teasing)
                    I m afraid Cathy s talents don t 
                    lie in the kitchen.

                                  CATHY
                            (explaining)
                    I m a dancer.  Well, I m trying to 
                    be.   

                                  WOMAN*
                    Oh yes.  Dr. Sheffield used to brag 
                    to all his patients about your 
                    ballet.  
                          (to Christopher and 
                            Carrie)
                    About all of your accomplishments.*
                          (nods, to Christopher)
                    Guess I ll be calling you now every 
                    time my bad knee acts up.  *

                                  CATHY
                    Oh, my brother s not a doctor yet.

                    One more year  til I finish my 
                    training.  

      The woman finally leans down to Carrie.*

                                  WOMAN*
                    And you must the star pupil at Miss 
                    Calhoun s School for Girls.  What 
                    grade are you in, honey-- sixth?  

                                  CARRIE
                    Eleventh.

      Upset, Carrie skulks off.  Christopher and Cathy quickly try 
      to make light of the gaffe. 

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Don t let Carrie s size fool you.  
                    She s got a heart the size of 
                      Charleston.   

                                  CATHY
                          (lightly)
                    And a temper to match.

      They all chuckle politely.   The woman turns serious.*


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED: (2)44

                                  WOMAN*
                    It s a blessing to see how well *
                    you ve all turned out.*

                    Most siblings aren t nearly so 
                    close.



      Cathy enters with a wrapped casserole while Paul s kind, 
        African-American housekeeper HENNY (50s) cleans up.  

                                  CATHY
                    Last guest just left, Henny.  We re 
                    finally on our own.

      As Cathy tries to make room in the crowded refrigerator;

                                  HENNY
                    You sure you re gonna be okay, Miss 
                    Cathy? 

                                  CATHY
                          (nods)
                    I think we ve got enough chicken 
                    and dumplings to last a lifetime. 

      Henny stops cleaning, puts her hand gently on Cathy s arm.

                                  HENNY
                    I mean it.  Who s gonna look after 
                    you all now?  You re barely a grown-
                    up yourself, and Christopher s 
                    always buried in his medical books.  
                    And Carrie...
                          (gingerly)
                    being sensitive like she is.    

      Cathy tightens.  Henny s not wrong.   

                                  HENNY (CONT D)
                    Surely you must have family 
                      somewhere.  Distant cousins or a 
                    long-lost aunt--

                                  CATHY
                          (cutting her off)
                    No.  There s nobody.  
                          (then)
                    Don t worry about us, Henny.  We re 

      Cathy gets ready for bed.  As she brushes her hair, she looks 
      at some FRAMED PHOTOS of Paul over the past ten years (ballet 
      recitals, high school graduation, Christmas, etc...)  
      Clearly, Dr. Sheffield took good care of them.  

      Upset, Cathy SWEEPS the photos off her dressing table.  Then 
      stares at the telephone.



      Bart and Corrine s upscale home.  Bart (early 40s) and 
      Corrine (early 50s), still married and aging well, are 
      heading out in cocktail attire.  Bart fiddles with his 
      cufflinks while Corrine waits impatiently by the front door.

                                    CORRINE
                      Bart-darling, everyone s waiting 
                    for us.  We ll miss the silent 
                    auction.   

                                  BART
                    You and your charity parties.  
                    What s the cause this time--?

      SFX: The phone rings.  Corrine reaches for it, but Bart 
      answers it first. 

                                  BART (CONT D)
                          (into phone)
                    Hello?  Uh, yes, she s right here.

      Bart hands her the phone.  Corrine looks confused, a little 
      irritated.  Who could be calling right now?   

                                    CORRINE
                          (into phone)
                    This is Corrine Winslow. 
                          (no answer)
                    Hello?  Hello...?
                            (frustrated)
                    Who is this?  What do you want--?! 

      A beat then she hangs up.  Tries to compose herself.  But 
      Bart sees she s shaken.  

                                  BART
                    Another prank call? 
                          (she nods reluctantly)
                    That s it.  I m calling the police 
                    and having them trace the number. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)        CONTINUED:77

      He reaches for the phone but Corrine stops him.  Firmly.

                                    CORRINE
                    No.  Don t.
                          (blithely)
                    It-- it s probably just some kids  
                    idea of a joke. 

      She quickly fixes his cufflink and ushers him out the door.  *
      Then surreptitiously reaches into her purse and takes out a *
      bottle of prescription pills.  Pops one or two.*



      Cathy holds the phone.  There s only a dial tone.   

                                    CHRISTOPHER (O.S.)
                    You re calling her again, aren t 
                    you?

      She whips around to find Christopher in the doorway.  He s 
      witnessed the entire thing.  She quickly drops the phone into 
      its cradle.  Tries to play it off.

                                  CATHY*
                          (lightly)*
                    What, are you spying on me? 

      She gets up and brushes past him, but he blocks her.

                    I m serious, Cath.  You agreed to *
                    stop.  It s not healthy.*

      Cathy stops, looks ashamed.*

                                  CATHY*
                    I know.  Just-- don t you ever *
                    think about her?  About what she 
                    did to us... to Cory? *

                                  CHRISTOPHER*
                    Of course I do.  But what s done is *
                    done.  You have to forget about *
                    mom.  Move on.    *

                    I m trying, Christopher, I am.  But *
                    then I think: she s out there, *
                    married and rich... pretending like *
                    we never even existed.   *

                    Look, I m trying to get on with my *
                    life.  Make something of myself.

                          (then)
                    It s what Paul would ve wanted.  
                    And dad, too.  

      Cathy looks at her garnet ring -- the one her dad gave her 
      years ago in FITA -- and fights back tears.  He gently *
      squeezes her shoulder.*

      A local ballet company.  Cathy and OTHER DANCERS train under 
      the unforgiving scrutiny of the FEMALE BALLET TEACHER, 50s, 
      with a severe bun and even more severe expression. 

                                    TEACHER
                    ...To the front and jete, and back,

                          (snapping fingers)
                    One and two, and one and two, and-- 
                    pick it up, Natalie.  Jane, watch 
                    your timing.  Push yourself, 
                    Richard-- this isn t a grade school 
                    recital.   

      The dancers are sweating, nervous as the Teacher picks them 
      apart.  Only Cathy remains laser-focused on her movements.  *

                      Perfection is not something you re 
                    born with.  It takes practice, 
                      devotion... pain. *

      A MALE DANCER (20s) appears in the doorway.  This is Julian *
      Marquet, as arrogant as he is handsome.   The other dancers *
      take notice but his eyes-- and smug grin-- are aimed directly *
      at Cathy.  *

                                    JULIAN*
                    The trick is to not look like 
                    you re in pain.

      He sweeps past Cathy, who looks annoyed, and kisses the *
      Teacher. *

                    My son, Julian.  Back from New *
                    York.*

      She nods at him.  Julian does a staggering Cabriole leap.  *
      He s the best dancer by far, and knows it.

                                    TEACHER (CONT D)
                      Excellent.  *

      Next up is Cathy.  She does a grand pirouette.  The teacher 
      shakes her head, dismissive.   

                                    TEACHER (CONT D)
                    Weak.

      But Cathy steps back to the floor.  Anxious to get it right.  *
      A hint of defiance, even.*

                                    TEACHER (CONT D)
                    Try again?

      Cathy nods.  The music resumes.  She spins again.  

                                    TEACHER (CONT D)
                    Again.  Again.  Again!  

      Now she s testing her, trying to break Cathy.   But Cathy 
      keeps going.  Faster, stronger and more focused with each 
      spin-- astonishingly so.  The other dancers watch-- 
      impressed, scared.  Even Julian s surprised by her 
      determination.  

      Finally, the music stops.  A tense beat as Cathy struggles to 
      catch her breath.  But refusing to bow down.  Julian is *
      impressed.  But the teacher merely nods. *

                                    TEACHER (CONT D)
                    Better.



      After rehearsal.  The dancers are getting changed, icing 
      muscles, etc....  Cathy peels off her ballet slippers and 
      winces-- the back of the slipper has dug a GASH into her 
      ankle.  Julian approaches.   

                                  JULIAN
                    You re bleeding.

                                  CATHY
                          (turning away)
                    It doesn t bother me.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:1010

                                  JULIAN
                      I noticed.

      He pulls out a bandage and starts to wrap her ankle.  She 
      tries to stop him, pull out of his grip. 

                                  CATHY
                    I can take care of myself--

      But he s stronger, in control-- and ignores her protests.  
      When he s finished, she nods reluctantly.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    Thanks.

      The teacher calls out from the studio.

                                    TEACHER
                      Julian-darling, I want you to run *
                    the  Sleeping Beauty  auditions 
                    with me next week.  *

      He gets up, slowly brushing his hand up Cathy s leg.

                                  JULIAN
                    Play nice and I can help you a lot 
                    more around here.

      He exits.  Several FEMALE DANCERS glance enviously at Cathy.

      Suddenly, a NOTE gets thrown on her desk.  She opens it up.  *

      Carrie turns back around, sinks lower in her seat.*



      Christopher and other MALE MEDICAL STUDENTS are doing their 
      rounds, led by DR. REEVES (50s), the chief of staff.  

                                  DR. REEVES
                          (reading medical chart)
                    ... The patient was admitted this 
                    morning with vague epigastric pain, 
                    that progressed to her lower right 
                    quadrant.    

                                    MEDICAL STUDENT #1
                    Could be appendicitis?  

                                  DR. REEVES
                          (re: chart)
                    Her appendix was removed last year. 

      The other students are stumped, then Christopher pipes in.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    What about an ectopic pregnancy?  
                    It can cause severe abdominal 
                    cramps, even if the fallopian tube 
                    hasn t ruptured.    

      Dr. Reeves nods at Christopher, glares at the other students.

                                  DR. REEVES
                    Glad to see somebody s cracked open 
                    their Gray s Anatomy.  

      Just then, a PRETTY GIRL (20s) in a sweater-set and pearls, 
      approaches.  She taps her watch sternly.

                                  PRETTY GIRL
                    Dr. Reeves, I hope you haven t 
                    forgotten about our dinner date. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:1212

                                  DR. REEVES
                    Be right there.  
                          (to guys)
                    Don t let the pearls fool you.  She 
                    can throw a real fit if I m late.  

                                  PRETTY GIRL
                          (laughing)
                    Daddy! 

      She gives Dr. Reeves a peck on the cheek.  Then notices the 
      medical students.  

                                  PRETTY GIRL (CONT D)
                    Aren t you going to introduce me?

                                  DR. REEVES
                    Oh, my daughter, Sarah.  These are 
                    my third-years-- Jack, Ed ... 
                      Christopher.   

      She looks at Christopher, a little taken aback.   

                                  SARAH (PRETTY GIRL)
                    You re the Christopher Sheffield my 
                    father s always talking about?   

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Nothing bad, I hope.

                                  SARAH
                    No, just-- I thought you d look 
                    more... studious. 

      Christopher grins sheepishly. The other students exchange 
      looks.  

                                  DR. REEVES
                    We better get going, Sarah.  
                          (to students)
                    See you gentlemen first thing 
                    Monday in the surgical ward.  So 
                    easy on the martinis this weekend.

                          (catching herself)
                    All of you.

      Dr. Reeves and Sarah head out.  The other students 
      immediately start teasing Christopher.

                     You re Christopher--?  I thought *
                    you d look more studious.  

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Knock it off.  She seemed like a 
                    perfectly nice girl. 

                                    MEDICAL STUDENT #1
                    And don t you forget it.  Dr. 
                    Reeves would keep her chained in a 
                    tower if he could.  
                          (then)*
                    Hey, you coming out with us 
                    tonight?  We re going dancing with 
                    some of the ER nurses.   

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Ah, I dunno.

                                    MEDICAL STUDENT #1
                    Come on.  All work and no play... *
                    Besides, the only reason they 
                    agreed to go out with us is  cuz we 
                    said you were coming.

      The guys laugh.  Christopher looks down the hall at the CUTE 
      NURSES, giggling by the entrance.  But he looks 
      uncomfortable.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    I can t.  I have to study.



        A back-alley dive with live music and cheap drinks.  Cathy 
      sits with Julian at a corner table.  A WAITRESS approaches 
      with two drinks, sizes up Cathy.

                                  WAITRESS
                    Your usual, Julian? 

      Cathy s not sure if she means his drink or his date.  

                                  JULIAN
                    Thanks, Eunetta.

      Julian hands her a tip, then takes a long swig.  Cathy takes 
      a sip and makes a face.  Julian looks amused.

                                  JULIAN (CONT D)
                    Never had moonshine?    


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:1313

                                  CATHY
                          (shakes her head)
                    Isn t it illegal?  

                                  JULIAN
                    That s what makes it taste so good.

                                  CATHY
                      I wouldn t know.

      A beat as Cathy takes in the atmosphere.  She s a little 
        uncomfortable-- this seedy club s a far cry from the  pretty  
      ballet studio.  Julian lights up a cigarette, looks at Cathy.

                                  JULIAN
                    So what s your story, anyway?

                                  CATHY
                    My story?

                                  JULIAN
                    Sure, you come across as  Little 
                    Miss Perfect.   Come in early, stay 
                    late.  Don t get in anyone s 
                    business.  You ve got some natural 
                    talent, I ll give you that... but 
                    your training s crap.  
                          (a little suspicious)
                    Where d you say you studied again?

      Cathy tightens, starts to get up. 

                                  CATHY
                    Maybe this wasn t such a good 
                    idea...?

      But Julian pulls her back down.  A little roughly.    

                                  JULIAN
                    I didn t say I didn t like you.

      He waves to Eunetta for another round then looks Cathy 
      squarely in the eyes.

                                  JULIAN (CONT D)

                    I know you re ambitious. 
                      Passionate.  You ve got bigger

                    company before trading in your tutu 
                    for a white picket fence and a

      Cathy takes a long sip from her glass-- he s stirred 
      something in her.  That and the moonshine are slightly 
      intoxicating.  

                                  JULIAN (CONT D)
                    You thought about going to New

                    the orchestra... it s like nothing *
                    you ve ever experienced before.*

      Cathy s intrigued, the wheels are turning.  He notices. *

                                  JULIAN (CONT D)*
                    Why don t you come back with me? 

                                  CATHY
                    I don t know...*

                                  JULIAN
                    I m in one of the top companies.  
                    I ll introduce you to the director.   *
                    He s always looking for new talent. *
                    And with our chemistry, it s only a *
                    matter of time before the whole 
                    world knows who we are.*


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED: (3)1313

                                  CATHY
                    Really-- you d do that for me?

      Julian puts his hand on the back of her neck, tips up her 
      chin.  Close enough to kiss her.  Cathy bites her lip, 
      excited.  Instead, he just whispers seductively;

                                  JULIAN
                    I d do anything for you.



      Cathy heads to her room.  Christopher follows closely behind.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Who was that?

                                  CATHY
                    Nobody.  A friend. 

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                          (notices)
                    And you ve been drinking, haven t 
                    you? 

      He holds her face, tries to take a closer look.

                                  CATHY
                    I m fine, really--*

      Cathy tries to squirm away.  Henny steps out from the maid s *
      quarters in her nightgown.  Sees the siblings locked 
      together.  


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:1515

                                  HENNY
                    Everyone okay?  I got such a 
                    fright.   

      Christopher and Cathy immediately separate.

                                  CATHY*
                          (laughing it off)*
                    Sorry, Henny.  Just-- Christopher 
                    still thinks I m fourteen.

      Cathy shakes them off, runs up to bed.  Christopher stares 
      after her, uneasy.



      Cathy gets ready for bed (taking off jewelry, etc...).  
      Christopher appears in the doorway.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    You deserve better than Julian.

                                  CATHY
                    So you did know who I was with?

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    I m only telling you this for your 
                    own good. 

                                  CATHY  
                    Then you should be happy.  You re 
                    the one who said I should make 
                    something of myself.  Be 
                      successful.  And Julian can help my 
                    career.  We want the same things, *
                    we have the same goals...  *

                                  CHRISTOPHER*
                    Look, I ve heard things about him.  
                    He s dangerous.  His drinking, his 
                    temper... The way he uses women.  
                    You really think you re the only 
                    one--?

      It dawns on Cathy what s really bothering Christopher.  *

                                  CATHY
                    This isn t about Julian.  *

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Of course it is.*




                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:1616

                                  CATHY*
                    You-- you re jealous.  That I was *
                    with another man.

      His eyes flash with anger for a moment then he backs off. 

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Cathy, don t.  We agreed never to 
                    talk about that.

      But she ignores him.  She has to get it off her chest.*

                                  CATHY
                    I see the way you look at me.  Ten 
                    years and you re still thinking 
                    about the attic.  What we did 
                    together, how we felt...

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Stop it--!

                                  CATHY
                          (pointedly)
                    How you ve never felt that way 
                    about anyone else.  

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    That s not true. 

                                  CATHY
                    You re still in love with me... 
                    aren t you?     

      It s not a question-- more like a statement.  A long beat as *
      he stares at Cathy.  Unsure, filled with anguish.   It s *
      clear from his pained expression that Cathy s hit the nail on *
      the head. *

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                          (softly)
                    You keep telling me to move on, 
                    but... you can t either.

      He chokes back a sob.  She reaches out to comfort him, hugs *
      her tightly.  But their comfort soon gives way to passion and 
      they KISS.

      Soon they FALL BACK ONTO THE BED.  The past ten years  apart  
      has only made them hungrier, desperate.  And more forbidden 

      Cathy stares at herself in the mirror, still groggy from the *
      previous night.  Incredulous of what she did.  Then, behind *
      her, she notices Christopher admiring her-- just like he did *
      in the attic ten years earlier. 

      Only this time, Cathy s not flattered... or surprised.  
      Instead, she looks regretful, ashamed.  So does he.*

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                            (consoling)*
                    I wanted it as much as you did.*

                                  CATHY
                    It doesn t matter. *
                          (then)*
                    After all these years, I ve tried *
                    so hard to forget these feelings...*

                                  CHRISTOPHER*
                    We both have.  *
                          (then)*
                    It s just hard because it feels so *
                    right.*

      He moves closer, kisses her shoulder.  She closes her eyes, *
      sighs.  In another context, it s almost romantic.  But here, *
      she quickly shakes it off with a shudder.*

                                  CATHY*
                    But it s not.   We can t do this *
                    again-- we can t be together.   If *
                    anyone found out...*

                                  CHRISTOPHER*
                    Nobody ever will.*

      Christopher nods and pulls back.  Unhappy-- but he s knows *
      she s right.   *

      FROM THE DOORWAY -- we see CARRIE, who s standing behind the *
      door, which is slightly ajar.  She s overheard the entire *
      conversation.*



      Christopher finishes up with A MOM and HER SON (11) in a *
      fresh arm cast.  He s kind but a little distracted.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:1818

                    Baseball season s around the 
                    corner.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Oh, yeah.  Few more weeks he ll be 
                    good as new.  
                          (to boy)
                    Just promise you won t fly off any 
                    more roofs.   

        A CANDY-STRIPER approaches with a cart.  It s Sarah.

                                  SARAH
                    Hi, Christopher-- Dr. Sheffield.  
                    Would you like some sweet tea?
                          (off his confused look)
                    Sarah, Dr. Reeves  daughter.  We 
                    met a few weeks ago.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Oh, right.  Sorry, the uniform 
                    threw me.

                                  SARAH
                    I just started volunteering  I love 
                    kids, and well, I was hoping to run 
                    into certain medical students.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                          (not getting it)
                    Oh yeah-- anyone I know? 

      She tips her head-- he s cute but odd.  She hands him the 
      tea. 

                                  SARAH
                    Well, I should let you go.  You ve 
                    got lives to save--

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    That s okay.  I could use a break.    

      Sarah smiles.  A RECEPTIONIST approaches with a message.

                                  RECEPTIONIST
                    Dr. Sheffield, Henny just called.  
                    Something with your sister. 

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    I hope Carrie s not in trouble in 
                    school again.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED: (2)1818

                                  RECEPTIONIST
                    She said it s about Cathy.

      Now Christopher looks worried.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    I gotta go.

      He races off, barely looking at Sarah as he exits.



      A MASSIVE STUDIO filled with BALLET DANCERS, including Cathy 
      and Julian.  The place is bigger, more impersonal than the 
      studio in South Carolina-- and far more competitive.  The 
      company s run by a tough-as-nails MALE BALLET DIRECTOR-- 
      GEORGE KOROV (50s), who continues his lecture, weaving 
      through the sea of well-trained DANCERS. 

                                  GEORGE (BALLET DIRECTOR)
                          (continued from O.S.)
                    ...And for each one of you, there 
                    are a thousand more.  Younger, 
                    stronger, more determined.  Just 
                    waiting to take your place.   

      Next to Cathy is a beautiful dancer, YOLANDA LANGE, (early 
      20s), with dark, exotic looks and sexual confidence.  She 
       accidentally  JOSTLES Cathy, who stumbles in front of 
      George.  Mad, Cathy hisses at Yolanda.  

                                  CATHY
                    Hey, watch it--!

      But Yolanda s not paying attention-- her eyes are on Julian.  
      And she likes what she sees.



      A shabby walk-up with mismatched furniture.  Still, it s 
      cozy, intimate.  Julian and Cathy are having passionate, *
      slightly rough sex-- far less  romantic  than with her and *
        Christopher.  Afterwards, Julian rolls over.  Grins at Cathy.*



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:2222

                                  JULIAN
                            (complimentary)
                    You more intense than usual.

                                  CATHY
                    I m just excited to be in New York.

      He starts kissing her neck but Cathy s thinking.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    You think George even noticed me?  
                    There were so many other dancers. 

                                  JULIAN
                    Yeah, sure.  

      He looks at her a moment, then;

                                  JULIAN (CONT D)
                    But your hair.

                                  CATHY
                    What s wrong with my hair?  

                                  JULIAN
                    It s so provincial... like a doll.  
                    You should dye it dark.  Or cut it.

      But Julian s hit a raw nerve.  Cathy pulls away, angry.   
      Defiant.  

                                  CATHY
                    I like my hair as is.



      George scrutinizes the dancers, who work in partners, 
      practicing lifts.  As he lectures, he taps several PAIRS, who 
      leave the floor discouraged. 

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    ...The  pas de deux  in  Sleeping 
                    Beauty  is designed for two 
                      dancers... with the idea they 
                    become one.  They must be totally 
                      connected-- physically, creatively, 
                    and symbolically.  To symbolise the 
                    powerful, all-encompassing 
                      connection between the prince and 
                    the princess.

      He stops to watch Julian and Cathy, who go through their 
      steps.  Finally, Julian lifts Cathy, but they STUMBLE.  


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:2323

      A tense beat as George considers them.  He nods approvingly 
      at Julian... then TAPS Cathy.  She s mortified.    

                                  CATHY
                    I- I know I can do it.  If we could 
                    just try again--

                                  GEORGE
                          (ignoring her)
                    Julian, I want you to partner 
                    with... Yolanda.

      Cathy steps aside as Yolanda steps into Julian s arms.  She 
      watches in dismay as they dance in perfect, sensual harmony.  
      Even George is impressed.

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    Great dancers don t perform the 
                     pas de deux.   They become it.

      Yolanda remains in Julian s arms a beat too long.  Then 
      brushes past Cathy with a victorious smirk.

                                    YOLANDA
                    Don t feel bad, bonita.  Someday 
                    you ll find your own prince.   



      Cathy and Julian unwind after their grueling day.  Julian 
      wraps his foot as Cathy makes herself a sandwich.  As she s 
      about to take a bite, Julian shoots her a look.

                                  JULIAN
                    That such a good idea?

                                  CATHY
                    I m hungry.

                                  JULIAN
                          (shrugs)
                    I guess you don t have to worry 
                    about lifts.  None of the  corps  
                    dancers do.

      Cathy puts down the sandwich, nibbles on just the lettuce and 
      tomato.  Then, simmering;  

                                  CATHY
                    It wasn t me, you know.  Your hand 
                    slipped.  

      That gets his attention.  


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:2424

                                  JULIAN
                     Scuse me?

                                  CATHY
                    Your hand slipped.  That s why I 
                    fell.

                                  JULIAN
                    Your mistake is my fault?  Because 
                    I didn t hear Yolanda complaining.  

                                  CATHY
                    You were too busy running your 
                    hands all over her to hear much of 
                    anything.

      That does it.  Julian gets up, grabs Cathy s arm.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    You re hurting me!

                                  JULIAN
                    You begged me to take you to New 
                    York.  You said you wanted to get 
                    as far away from South Carolina as 
                    possible.  And this is what I get?

                                  CATHY
                    Julian, stop it, calm down--

                                  JULIAN
                    You would have nothing without me!  

      Angry, he SHOVES the table.  The sandwich flies off the 
      table, the plate SHATTERS.  Now Cathy s frightened.  

                                  CATHY
                    Look, I- I didn t mean it like 
                    that, I swear.  

                                  JULIAN
                    You re mad that you can t hack it 
                    here and I can.  Because not all 
                    eyes are on little Miss Perfect 
                    anymore!  Well, this is my career.  
                    My life.  My dream!
                    And I don t need you messing it up!   
                    I don t need you at all! 

      He grabs her, presses her against the wall.  She trembles.

                                  CATHY
                    Stop.  Please.  I just--
                          (deep breath)
                                  (MORE)

                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED: (2)2424
                                  CATHY (CONT'D)
                    I- I want success.  And happiness.  
                    For both of us.

      Suddenly, he lets go of her, then CRUMPLES with remorse.  

                                  JULIAN
                    Oh God.  I m so sorry.  I- I don t 
                    know what got into me...

      Cathy feels bad, gives his shoulder a reassuring squeeze.

                                  CATHY
                    It s okay.  I shouldn t have said 
                    those things-- 

                                  JULIAN
                    This was a mistake.

                                  CATHY
                    What?

                                    JULIAN*
                    You should leave.  Nobody s 
                    stopping you.  Go home... 
                          (pointedly)
                    Back to your loving brother.

      Cathy tightens.  Then shakes her head.  *

                                  CATHY
                    I want to stay.

      Julian shoots her a knowing grimace, then;

                                  JULIAN
                    That s what I thought.  
                          (grabs his jacket)
                    I m going out.  *

      He exits.  She chokes back tears and starts carefully picking 
      up the shards of broken ceramic off the floor.  



      Morning service.  The FEMALE STUDENTS, including Carrie, sing 
      their daily hymn.  When they finish, they sit for the 
      headmistress, MISS CALHOUN (50s, proper) to deliver the day s 
      announcements. 

                                  MISS CALHOUN
                    Good morning, girls.  




                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:2525

                                  GIRLS
                          (in unison)
                    Good morning, Miss Calhoun.

                                  MISS CALHOUN
                    In today s announcements, the 
                    Madrigals society will meet in the 
                    south courtyard.  Sign up with Miss 
                    Pritchett for garden club.  And 
                    next month is the junior cotillion 
                    with the St. Ambrose School for 
                    boys...  

      The girls buzz with excitement.  Miss Calhoun shushes them 
      with a warning.

                                  HEADMISTRESS
                    I do not need to remind you that 
                    you re young ladies now-- and as 
                    such, we require white gloves and 
                    proper lady-like behavior.  



      Over lunch, the girls chat eagerly about the dance.*

                                  GIRL #1
                    ...I can t decide between my coral *
                    chiffon or my yellow silk.   

                                  LACY *
                    Well, St. Ambrose colors are green *
                    and white.  And my mother found me *
                    the most divine emerald dress at 
                      Dillard s.

      The girls look over at Carrie, nearby, buried in a book.

                                  LACY (CONT D)
                    What re you gonna wear to the 
                      cotillion, Carrie?*

                                  CARRIE
                          (mumbles)
                    I don t know.

                                  LACY *
                    Well, I m sure you ll look like a *
                    real doll... since you ll have to *
                    shop in the toy section.  *

      The girls snicker.  Carrie reddens, keeps reading.*



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:2626

                                  LACY (CONT D)*
                      Seriously, Carrie, why haven t you *
                    grown?  You heard what that film in *
                    biology class said-- it s not *
                    natural.*
                          (no response)*
                    ...Or were your parents freaks, *
                    too?*

      At the mention of her parents, Carrie looks up.  Furious.  *

                                    CARRIE*
                    Don t talk about my parents!   *

      She LUNGES at Lacy like an angry child, KICKING and CHOKING *
      HER.  A SCHOOL TEACHER quickly runs over. *

                                  SCHOOL TEACHER*
                    Girls, stop it this instant!  What *
                    is going on?*

      She pries the girls apart.  Carrie is bright red, too angry *
      to cry or speak.  Lacy tries to catch her breath.*

                                  LACY*
                    We were just talking about the *
                    dance and Carrie went... crazy.  *

      The teacher knows Lacy s full of it, shakes her head *
        sympathetically at Carrie.  But she has no choice.*

                                  SCHOOL TEACHER*
                    Alright, you re to go straight to *
                    the headmistress  office.  *
                          (then, off Lacy s smirk)*
                    Both of you.*

      Heading off, Carrie grins to herself.  Lacy looks outraged.*



      The maternity ward.  Christopher finds Sarah, in a candy-
      striper uniform, gazing at the NEWBORN BABIES displayed 
      behind the glass wall.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Come here often?

      Sarah jumps, a little startled.

                                    CHRISTOPHER (CONT D)
                    Oh, sorry.  



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:2727

                                  SARAH
                    No, it s fine.  I was just...
                          (confesses)
                    I like looking at the babies. 

      She turns red, a little embarrassed.  

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    I do, too.  With all the sick 
                    people around here, it cheers me up 
                      sometimes. 

                                  SARAH
                    Yes, exactly.  They re so young and 
                      innocent... perfect.  Hard to 
                    believe they ll all grow up 
                    someday.  

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                          (quietly)
                    Not all of them.

      She gives him a funny look-- what a morbid thing to say.  She 
      shakes it off with a smile.

                                  SARAH
                    Well, the gift shop s probably 
                    wondering where I ve wandered off 
                    to.  And you ve got real work to 
                    do...

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Actually, the receptionist told me 
                    I might find you here.  
                          (then)
                    I was hoping we could have dinner.  

                                  SARAH
                          (surprised)
                    What?

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    I mean, together.  On Saturday 
                    night.  Like a date.

                                  SARAH
                          (laughing)
                    I know what you meant.  And yes, 
                    I d love to.

      Happy, Sarah crosses away.  Christopher looks back at the row 
      of newborn babies-- at a SET OF TWINS.  His face darkens then 

      Saturday night.  Christopher and Sarah are on their date.  
      Sarah chats breezily but Christopher seems a bit stiff.

                                  SARAH
                    ...I m getting ready for my first 
                      cotillion, and my brassiere flat-
                    out busted.  So I had no choice but 
                    to send my poor widowed father to 
                    the intimates store.  I swear, he 
                    was cursing my dear, departed 
                    mother s name up and back.

      She chuckles, then notices Christopher s almost done with his 
      food-- she s been talking way too much.

                                  SARAH (CONT D)
                    Look at me, going on and on.  And 
                    you ve barely said a word.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    It s okay.  I like it.

                                  SARAH
                    C mon.  Tell me about you.  

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Like what?

                                  SARAH
                    What do you like to do?  Fishing... 
                    hunting?  I know how you Southern 
                    men like your rifles.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    I mostly just work.  

      An awkward beat, then she tries again;

                                  SARAH
                    Well... how s your sister?

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Oh, Carrie s doing just fine at 
                    school.  In fact, she has her own 
                    first cotillion coming up. 

                                  SARAH
                    I meant, your other one.  The 
                    dancer?

      Christopher visibly tightens.  Drops his fork.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:2828

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    We haven t spoken in a few months.

      The WAITER comes by. 

                                  WAITER
                    Any more drinks... coffee or tea?

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                          (quickly)
                    Just the check, please.



      The Junior Cotillion.  GIRLS in elegant dresses and white 
      gloves slow-dance with handsomely suited BOYS.  Only Carrie 
      sits alone on the side, shy and out-of-place in her frilly 
      dress-- clearly from the Junior Department. 

      Finally, a SWEET-LOOKING BOY approaches her. 

                                  BOY
                    May I have this dance?

      Carrie looks around-- is he talking to her?  He is.  

                                  CARRIE
                    I-- um... are you sure?     

                                  BOY
                    Took me ten minutes to work up the 
                    nerve to even ask, so... yeah.

      Carrie smiles, takes his hand.

      A LITTLE LATER - Carrie dances awkwardly with the boy.  She s 
        self-conscious, because she s so much shorter than him.   

                                  CARRIE
                    Sorry, I have two left feet...?

                                  BOY
                    Thomas.  But people call me Tucker.  

                                  CARRIE
                    Tucker-- that s nice.  I m Tucker, 
                    Carrie.  I mean Carrie, Tucker...  



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:3030

                                  TUCKER
                    Nice to meet you, Carrie Tucker.

      She laughs a little.  A beat, then;

                                  CARRIE
                    You weren t really nervous about 
                    asking me to dance, were you?

                                  TUCKER
                    It s not every day I meet a girl 
                    with such pretty blue eyes.  Your 
                    parents must ve made a deal with 
                    the devil for those.

                                  CARRIE
                    Yeah, I guess.

      They continue to dance.  He pulls her closer.  Carrie s 
      positively beaming.  After a beat, he leans in closer.  *

                                  TUCKER
                    Let s get outta here... Up to the 
                    roof.  You have to see the view.  

                                  CARRIE
                    I dunno, I don t really like--

                                  BOY
                    We ll leave separately.  Nobody 
                    will find out.  C mon, Carrie 
                    Tucker-- just you and me.   

                                  CARRIE
                    Okay.

      Tucker slips out a side door.  After a beat, Carrie follows.



      End of rehearsal.  Cathy s stretching.  There s a COMMOTION 
      outside.  DANCERS are squealing, laughing, even crying.  A 
      DANCER pokes her head in.

                                  DANCER 
                    It s up.

                                  CATHY
                    What?


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:3232

                                  DANCER
                    The casting list for  Sleeping 
                    Beauty!   

      Cathy rushes out to find... 



      Dawn.  Julian stumbles in, drunk.  Cathy s waiting on the 
      sofa, her bags packed.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:3434

                                  CATHY
                    Fun night?

      He doesn t answer.  Goes straight to the sink.  Splashes his 
      face with cold water.   

                                  JULIAN 
                    Make me some coffee, will you?

                                  CATHY
                    I m going home.  The train leaves 
                    in an hour.

      Now he looks up, notices the suitcase.  Gets angry.

                                  JULIAN
                    What?!  

                                  CATHY
                    Just for a week.  Christopher s 
                      graduating from medical school.  
                    I m his only family--  

                                  JULIAN
                    What about rehearsal?  Or is my 
                    debut not important enough for you?*

                                  CATHY
                    I m just background.  I ll explain 
                    it to George--

                                  JULIAN
                    You are NOT going anywhere... 
                    unless I say so!  

      He stumbles towards the bedroom.  A beat, then she picks up *
      her suitcase and slips out.



      Cathy arrives home to find the apartment is a mess.  Empty 
      bottles, dirty dishes.  And TWO WINE GLASSES on the coffee 
      table-- one with BRIGHT RED LIPSTICK (note: same shade 
      Yolanda wears).  

      Just then, Julian stumbles in from the bedroom.  She holds up 
      the stained wine glass, accusingly;

                                  CATHY
                    Whose is this?
                          (no reply)
                    Who have you been with--?

      Suddenly, Julian WHACKS HER.  Hard.  She stumbles backwards.

                                  JULIAN
                    Don t you ever leave me!

      Cathy crumples to the floor as Julian s angry fists rain down 
      on her.  She s a prisoner of abuse... again! 

                                  END OF ACT TWO                                      ACT THREE



      Cathy wakes up, alone, on the floor-- a little disoriented.  
      It s painful but she gets up and heads to the bathroom to 
      look in the mirror...



      Cathy s face is SWOLLEN, her hair tangled, eyes red.  She 
      tries to move her arm and WINCES.  Then unbuttons her shirt-- 
      her shoulder is BLACK AND BLUE.   

      Just then, Julian enters with freshly bought YELLOW FLOWERS.  
      He s soft-spoken, contrite.

                                  JULIAN
                          (re: her shoulder)
                    Some ice and it ll be fine in a 
                    couple of days.

      Cathy doesn t respond.  Ignores the flowers, brushes past him 
      to get to the freezer.  But he gets there first.  Pulls out 
      an ice pack.

                                  JULIAN (CONT D)
                    Let me.

                                  CATHY
                          (recoils)
                    Don t--

      But he s firm.  Presses it against her shoulder.  She grits 
      her teeth, tries not to react but it HURTS.  Her eyes well 
      up, despite herself.   

                                  JULIAN
                    I didn t mean it.  Any of it.  *

                                  CATHY
                    What about Yolanda?

                                  JULIAN
                    She s nothing.  I was just trying 
                    to get back at you for leaving.  *
                    You know how important this show is *
                    for me.   Dammit, Cathy, you know *
                    how much I need you right now.*
                          (then, softer)
                    Please.  What do I have to do to 
                    make this up to you.  Just tell me.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:3838

      Cathy dumps the flowers in the trash, shoots him a cunning 
      look.  



      CLOSE ON: A newspaper clipping announcing the New York City 
      Ballet s upcoming debut of  SLEEPING BEAUTY  -- with Cathy in 
      the title role.

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Corrine reads this, stony-faced.  She s 
      just received the article  anonymously  in the mail.  She *
      quickly pulls out one of her pills.  Bart comes up behind *
      her, notices.  *

                          (lightly)*
                    Why aren t you relaxed?  You spend *
                    all day shopping and having lunch.  *

                                  CORRINE*
                    Not funny.*

                                  BART*
                    I m sorry.  I didn t mean it like *
                    that.  *
                          (then)*
                    How about we take a trip?  *

                                  CORRINE*
                    You know my mother s not doing *

                          (notices article)*
                    We could go to New York for the *
                    weekend, soak up some culture...    *

                                    CORRINE
                          (draws him closer)*
                    I d rather stay home and make our *
                    own fun.  Besides, I ve never been *
                    a fan of ballet.*


      Julian and Cathy rehearse a complicated LIFT from  Sleeping 
      Beauty  under George s direction.  This time, they re perfect 
      together.  

                                  GEORGE
                    Very nice, you two.  Excellent, 
                    Cathy.  
                          (pointedly)
                    We can t have Sleeping Beauty keep 
                    falling out the Prince s arms. 

      He shoots a look to Yolanda, who watches on the side, 
      furious.

                                    YOLANDA
                          (to George, re: Julian)
                    I m telling you, it was his fault.  
                    He was leaning back too far... He 
                    kept dropping me on purpose.  It s 
                    not fair--!  

      But George ignores her.  Cathy brushes past Yolanda with a 
      smug grimace.

                                  CATHY
                    Life isn t always fair. 

      She grabs a towel, water then SPOTS SOMEONE through the 
      studio window.  Her smile turns to worry.  It s Carrie. 



      Cathy speaks privately with Carrie.  Cathy looks upset.

                                  CATHY
                    ...What do you mean you ve dropped 
                    out of school?  You were getting 
                    straight A s... 

                                  CARRIE
                    It s complicated.

                                  CATHY
                          (realizing)
                    It was the other girls, wasn t it?  
                    You said it was getting better.  Oh 
                    God, Carrie, if they hurt you in 
                    any way--





                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:4141

                                  CARRIE
                    No.  They didn t.  
                          (then)
                    Just-- with Paul gone, I want to be 
                    closer to my family.  To you.  

                                  CATHY
                    Carrie.

                                  CARRIE
                    I can finish school in New York.  
                    I ll stay on your couch, and help 
                    cook and clean up for you-- and 
                    Julian.

      At Julian s name, Cathy tightens. 

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                      Everything s okay with him, isn t 
                    it?  I know Christopher said--

                                  CATHY
                      Everything s great with us.  But 
                    with our show coming up, he s under 
                    a lot of pressure... 

      Just then, Julian enters.  

                                  JULIAN
                    Cathy, we re rehearsing act two-- 

      He sees Carrie.  Looks confused.  Cathy smiles tentatively. 

                                  CATHY
                    Julian, I don t think you ve met my 
                    sister, Carrie.

                                  CARRIE
                    Nice to meet you.

                                  JULIAN
                    I thought you were in school.  And 
                    the show s not for a few more 
                    weeks...

      Cathy and Carrie exchange looks, then;

                                  CATHY
                    Actually, she was hoping to stay 
                    with us... for a while.  

                                  CARRIE
                    I won t be any trouble, I promise.  
                    I ll do anything you want...


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED: (2)4141

      A tense beat as Julian considers this.  Sizes Carrie up.  
      Then gives her a warm smile, squeezes her on the shoulder.  *

                                  JULIAN
                    If it makes Cathy happy, then I am, 
                    too.

      Carrie lights up.  Cathy smiles with relief.  Things are 
      looking up!  



      Sarah and Christopher are finishing dinner.  Henny clears the 
      plates.

                                  SARAH
                    Henny, your peach cobbler is divine 
                    as usual.  I can never get my crust 
                    this flaky.  

                                  HENNY
                    You come over anytime and I ll show 
                    you how.   
                          (hinting)
                      Somebody s gonna have to make it 
                    for Mr. Christopher when I ve gone.

      Sarah blushes, (not so) secretly delighted by the 
        implication.  Christopher just grimaces.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Come on now, Henny.  You ll outlive 
                    us all.

                                  HENNY
                          (ignoring him)
                    How  bout next Saturday, Miss 
                    Sarah?

                                  SARAH
                    I d love to... but Christopher and 
                    I are going to Charleston.  

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    What re you talking about?

      Sensing trouble, Henny quickly crosses to the kitchen.  Sarah 
      turns to Christopher, nearly bursting with excitement. 

                                  SARAH
                    Honey, I told you about the charity 
                    garden party.  Thrown by the 
                    Southern Junior League.
                                  (MORE)

                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:4242
                                  SARAH (CONT'D)
                          (doesn t ring a bell)
                    It s only the most exclusive event, 
                    with the who s who of Southern 
                    Society.  I ve been trying to get 
                    an invite for months.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                      I guess... 

                                  SARAH
                          (lightly)
                    What goes on in that head of yours, 
                      Christopher?

      He looks a little uncomfortable, then;

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Look, I m sorry but... I can t make 
                    it.

      Sarah s mild exasperation turns to genuine upset.

                                  SARAH
                    What?

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    My sister Cathy has her debut in 
                     Sleeping Beauty.   Up in New York.  

                                  SARAH
                    Can t you go the next weekend?  
                    This party s important to me.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    And this is important to Cathy.  
                    She s been dreaming of this her 
                    whole life.  I can t miss opening 
                    night...  I m the only family she 
                    has.

      Sarah instantly feels bad.  She squeezes Christopher s hand.  

                                  SARAH
                    I m sorry-- I m being silly.  Of 
                    course you should go. 
                          (kisses him)
                    Besides, I think it s sweet how 

      Dress Rehearsal.  The place is buzzing with DANCERS and TECH 
      PEOPLE, all frantically dealing with last-minute changes, 
      costume fittings, etc....  

      Christopher slips in unnoticed.  From backstage, he watches 
      Cathy dance in full costume and makeup.  It s the scene in 
      Act One where Sleeping Beauty meets her various SUITORS.  
      She s more breath-taking than ever.  Finally, she receives 
      the cursed spindle and PRICKS HER FINGER... tragically 
      collapsing onto the floor.   Christopher sucks in his breath.  
      A woman approaches behind him.

                                  WOMAN (O.S.)
                    She s not really dead, you know.

      It s Yolanda, costumed as a background role.  She s been 
      watching Christopher stare longingly Cathy.  

                                    YOLANDA
                          (explains)
                    Just asleep, until the right man 
                    comes along.  Maybe you?

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    No.  I- I m her brother.

                                    YOLANDA
                          (smiles knowingly)
                    I see the resemblance.  
                          (then)
                    And I just saw your other sister.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Carrie s here?

                                    YOLANDA
                    By the dressing rooms.  She likes 
                    to... help out.



      The rehearsal continues.  Christopher looks frantically 
      around for Cathy.

                                  STAGE MANAGER
                          (calling out)
                    Ten minutes to act three!  Ten 
                    minutes!   

      Christopher finally spots her having her costume adjusted by 
      a WARDROBE ASSISTANT. 

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Cathy--?!  I ve been looking for 
                    you. 

                                  CATHY
                      Christopher, hi, sorry.  Dress 
                      rehearsal s always a little 
                    frantic. *

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    We need to talk.

                                  CATHY
                    I ll meet you back at the apartment 
                    after.  Carrie s here, she can let 
                    you in.  I think she s with Julian--

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    That s what we need to talk about. 

      Cathy sees he s serious.  Pulls Christopher aside.  *

                                  CATHY
                    What re you talking about?  I *
                    really don t have time for one of *
                    your tirades against Julian--   *

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Cathy, I saw them together.  He was *
                    touching her.  

      Suddenly, Cathy turns ashen.  *

                                  CATHY*
                    What?  Are- are you sure? *

                                  CHRISTOPHER*
                    I caught them in the dressing room.      *
                    The way he looked-- both of them.*




                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:4646

                                  CARRIE (O.S.)
                    It s not true.

      They spin around to find Carrie nearby, looking angry.  She s 
      overheard their exchange. 

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                      Christopher s wrong. 

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    But Carrie, I saw you--

                                  CARRIE
                    Nothing happened.   

                                  CATHY
                    Please, Carrie.  We re not mad at *
                    you.  But if he did something--*

                                  CARRIE
                    You re always treating me like a *
                    child just because I m small!  *
                    Well, I m not-- so leave me alone!  *

      Carrie runs off.  Julian approaches, impatient.  *

                                  JULIAN
                    Cathy, everyone s waiting.   
                          (notices the tension)
                    What the hell s going on here?

                                  CATHY*
                    Is it true about Carrie?  Were *
                    you... touching her?*

      He hesitates for just a brief second, then;*

                                    JULIAN*
                    What?*

                                  CATHY*
                      Christopher said he saw you.*

      Julian turns and glares at Christopher.  Shakes his head.*

                                    JULIAN*
                    What are you  protecting  you *
                    sisters?  Or maybe you re just *
                      jealous--?*

      Furious, Christopher SLAMS him against the wall.  Practically *
      choking him.  Julian has no idea what s he s unleashed.*




                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED: (2)4646

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    You goddamned snake--!*

                                  JULIAN
                            (struggling)
                    Get... off... me! 

                                  CATHY
                          (overlapping)
                      Christopher, stop-- don t!  

      Cathy tries to stop him, but Christopher s temper s too hot, 
      his grip too tight.  Julian starts turning red... then white.  
      A GROUP OF MALE DANCERS, TECH GUYS finally pry Christopher 
      off, hold him back.  Julian struggles to catch his breath.  
      George runs over.

                                  GEORGE
                    Julian, are you alright?  Can you 
                    still perform--?

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    No, he s not alright!  I saw him *
                    messing with my sister--!  *

      All eyes turn to Julian.  He s humiliated... and furious.  He 
      walks over to Christopher, SPITS in his face then STORMS 
      OUTSIDE.  Cathy looks upset.*

                                  CATHY
                    This is supposed to be my big day, *
                      Christopher.  I know you never *
                    liked Julian, but Carrie said *
                    nothing happened--*

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Or maybe you re too obsessed with 
                    your own success to care about your 
                    family.   
                          (pointedly)
                    Just like our mother.  

      This makes Cathy lose her temper.  Without thinking, she HITS *
      Christopher across the face.  

                                  CATHY
                    I m nothing like Corrine.*

      Then she runs after Julian.  



      CLOSE ON: A ballet barre.  A graceful line of DANCERS move to 
      the opening strains of Tchaikovsky s  Sleeping Beauty.   

      We PULL BACK TO REVEAL: It s a class of YOUNG GIRLS and Cathy 
      is now their teacher.  She watches the students, gently 
      correcting them when necessary.

                                  CATHY
                    Good extension, Elizabeth.  Relax 
                    your arms, Julia.  Let s finish 
                    with our pirouettes.   
                          (as the girls spin)
                    One and two, and one and two, 
                    stay with the music... Very nice.  

      The music stops, the girls run to collect their things. 

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                          (over the din)
                    Girls, please remember to stretch 
                    at home.  And bring your pointe 
                    shoes next week...   

      Suddenly, Cathy spots a BLONDE GIRL (12) run over to her 
      mother... it s CORRINE!  As they exit, Cathy follows after 
      them and GRABS Corrine s arm.  

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    Corrine, stop--!

      Corrine whips around... but it s NOT Corrine.  Just a random 
      mother with a similar hairstyle.  Cathy looks shaken. 

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    I- I m sorry.  I thought you were 
                    someone else.  
                          (then)
                    Since the accident, I-- I get 
                    confused sometimes.

      The woman smiles sympathetically. 

                                  BALLET MOTHER
                    That s alright.  I m sure it can t 
                    be easy, losing your boyfriend like 
                    that.  I heard it was a miracle you 
                    even survived.

      Cathy smiles gamely, trying to hide her pain.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:4949

                                  CATHY
                    I guess I m just lucky.

                                  BALLET MOTHER
                    Actually, I ve been meaning to tell 
                    you, my husband knows a knee 
                    surgeon in Charlotte--

                    Believe me, I ve been to every 
                      specialist on the Eastern Seaboard.  
                    I m never going to dance again.

                    I do love all the girls.

      Carrie sings with a CHURCH CHOIR led by a kind-looking, young 
      minister ALEX CONROY, (early 20s).  They re singing a 
      traditional hymnal  At Home, Let There Be Love.   

                                  CARRIE/CHOIR
                          (singing)
                    ...May we be slow to an-ger and 
                    fast to for-give/may joy and pa-
                    tience abound where we live...

      Carrie s voice is sweet and clear, and surprisingly powerful 
      for her size.  Alex nods admiringly.  



      The various CHOIR MEMBERS mingle over tea and baked goods.  
      Only Carrie, a bit shy, sticks to herself.  Alex approaches, 
      polishing off a pastry.   

                                  ALEX
                    I noticed you haven t touched any 
                    of the desserts.  I wish I had your 
                      self-restraint.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:5151

                                  CARRIE
                    I haven t got much of a sweet 
                    tooth. 

                                  ALEX
                    I suppose it s because you re sweet 
                    enough as is. 

                                  CARRIE
                    Oh, I don t know about that. 

                                  ALEX
                    Well, your voice certainly is.  
                    Everyone thinks so.  Especially me.

      Carrie reddens.  Alex gathers his courage, then;

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    Listen, there s an outdoor choral 
                    concert at the park this weekend, 
                    if you re interested.  We could 
                    have a picnic afterwards... 

                                  CARRIE
                          (a little suspicious)
                    You want to go on a date with me?

      Alex turns ashen.  Quickly stammers out an apology.

                                  ALEX
                    I- I m so sorry.  Of course, you 
                    must have a boyfriend.  I should 
                    have figured...

                                  CARRIE
                    No, I don t.  I m just not used--
                          (then)
                    I d be happy to go.  



      Christopher s finishing up his shift (putting away his 
      scrubs, etc...) when Sarah approaches.  She s all dressed up.

                                  SARAH
                    Ready for our big celebration 
                    dinner, honey? 

      Suddenly, Christopher gets a worried look on his face.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Did I forget something?  It s your 
                      birthday...?  


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:5252

                                  SARAH
                    For you, silly.  Getting picked to 
                    be  Chief Resident. 

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                          (shocked)
                    What?

      Just then, Dr. Reeves walks over.  Gives Christopher a proud 
      pat on the shoulder.

                                  DR. REEVES
                      Congratulations, Dr. Sheffield.   

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                          (thrilled)
                    Thank you so much, Dr. Reeves.  I m 
                    so honored... I can t believe it.

                                  DR. REEVES
                    Just so you know, this has nothing 
                    to do with the fact that you re 
                    dating my daughter.
                          (half-joking)
                    But if you ever hurt Sarah in any 
                    way...

      Sarah gives her dad a playful whack.

                                  SARAH
                    Daddy!  Nobody s as much of a 
                    gentleman as Christopher. 
                          (then)
                    Now let s get going before the club 
                    gives away our table.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                          (realizing)
                    I- I don t have a tie.

                                  SARAH
                    Don t worry, I brought one for you--

      Sarah reaches into her purse when the contents accidentally 
      SPILL onto the floor-- lipstick, compact, keys... and 
      CORRINE S CALLING CARD Sarah got at the Garden Party. 

      Christopher starts to help pick up her things-- and almost 
      sees his mother s card!  But Sarah, oblivious, grabs it 

      Carrie, anxious, speaks with Cathy.

                                  CATHY
                    What do you mean, you re not sure?  
                    Alex is kind and generous.... And 
                    he clearly thinks you hung the 
                    moon.   

                                  CARRIE
                    I know all that.
                          (then; softly)
                    What if I m not good enough for 
                    him?

                                  CATHY
                    Carrie.  How can you say that?

      A long beat as Carrie gathers her courage.

                                  CARRIE
                      Christopher was right about Julian.  
                    He did touch me.
                          (then)
                    And... I liked it.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:5454

      A silent beat as Cathy takes this in.  Upset.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    I knew it was wrong but I wanted it 
                    to happen.  I liked the way he 
                    looked at me... how he made me 
                    feel.  How can I be a minister s 
                    wife, Cathy?
                          (pause)
                    Maybe I really am the  devil s 
                    spawn -- just like our grandmother 
                    said.  

      At their grandmother s mention, Cathy jumps up.

                                  CATHY
                    No!  Don t say that.  That s not 
                    true.

                                  CARRIE
                    And what if it is?  I m not six 
                    anymore.  I ve heard you and 
                      Christopher talk about mom and dad.  
                    How they weren t supposed to be 
                    together.  What does that make us, *
                    Cathy?  
                          (then)
                    Maybe that s why I m so small?  Not 
                    from the attic.  But because of 
                    what our parents did.

      Cathy s upset but swallows her pain.  She wants to reassure 
      Carrie as much as herself.

                                  CATHY
                    We are not the sins of our parents.  
                    The best thing you can do is move 
                    on.  Forget about mom, and the 
                    past.  Never look back.

                                  CARRIE
                    And what about Cory?  Am I supposed 
                    to forget about him, too? 

      But Cathy doesn t have an answer for that.  

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    Truth is, I can hardly remember 
                    what he looks like anymore... but I 
                    don t want to let him go. 

      Cathy hugs Carrie hard.  Trying to fight back tears.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED: (2)5454

                                  CATHY
                    You have to, Carrie.  Promise me 
                    you will....

      But Carrie isn t so sure.



      Late night.  Carrie s deep in thought, staring at her 
      engagement ring, still in its velvet box.  Then picks up the 
      telephone and dials. 

                                  CARRIE
                          (into phone; timidly)
                    Hello...?  Hi, um, it-- it s 
                    Carrie... your daughter.



      Corrine speaks on the phone.  Furious.

                                    CORRINE
                    I don t have a daughter.  Never 
                    call here again!  

      She SLAMS down the phone, practically ripping it from the 
      wall.  She quickly reaches into her purse for her *
        prescription bottle-- but it s EMPTY.  Bart enters from the *
      other room.  Corrine looks enraged, not even trying to hide *
      it this time.*

                                    CORRINE (CONT D)
                    I want our number changed.  First 
                    thing tomorrow!*

                                  HENNY (O.C.)
                          (overlapping)
                    Aaagh...! 



      Christopher runs in to find Henny, perched on a stool.  She s 
      scared out of her wits. 

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Henny, what s wrong?!

      She points to a TINY MOUSE huddled in the corner.  
      Christopher shakes his head, scoops up the scared mouse.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:5757

                                    CHRISTOPHER (CONT D)
                    It s harmless.  See-- it s more 
                    scared of you.

      He holds the mouse closer to her but Henny freaks out.

                                  HENNY
                    Get it away from me!  Sweet Jesus, *
                    I was gonna poison it but... OOH!

      She gestures to a BOX OF MICE POISON on the counter.  Upset, 
      Christopher grabs it.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Where d you get that?!  We don t 
                    poison mice in this house. 

      He grabs the box, heads outside with the mouse.



      Cathy practices a simple dance move in front of her mirror-- 
      but WINCES, grabbing her knee in pain.  Suddenly, Christopher 
      bursts in.

                                  CATHY*
                    Hey, try knocking--*

                                  CHRISTOPHER*
                    You re doing it again.  You re 
                    obsessing over mom.  

                                  CATHY
                    What?  No, that s not true. *

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Then what are these? 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:5959

      He shows her the clippings.*

                                  CATHY
                    I- I don t know.  They re not mine.   
                    I swear.

      He looks at her, can tell she s being honest.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Then whose are they...?

      Suddenly, it starts to dawn on Cathy... on both of them.



      Cathy and Christopher enter the kitchen where Henny s 
      cleaning up.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Henny, have you seen Carrie? 

                                  HENNY
                    Not since this morning.  She was up 
                    real early, baking.  Pastries or 
                    donuts?  

                                  CATHY
                    What--?

                                  HENNY
                    I assumed it was for choir 
                      practice...   

      Christopher and Cathy exchange worried looks.  Then RUN 
      upstairs... 



      Christopher and Cathy burst into the room to find... Carrie s 
      dead.  She lies peacefully on her bed, more doll-like than 
      ever in her Sunday finest, a light sprinkling of powdered 
      sugar-- mice poison-- covering her pale, slender fingers.  
      Next to her is a half-eaten plate of donuts. 

      Christopher falls to his knees.  Cathy stands frozen in 
      shock.  

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Carrie, no...  God, no!
                          (to Cathy)
                    How could she do this?  How could 
                    she hurt herself like this?   


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:6161

      But Cathy just shakes her head.  She stares over at Corrine s *
      photo from the society pages, laughing and enjoying herself *
      with Bart.  Cathy s eyes blaze with hurt... and rage.  .*

                    It wasn t Carrie... She didn t do *
                    it.
                          (then)
                    Mom did.

                                  END OF ACT FOUR                                        ACT FIVE



      Cathy packs her bags with Henny s help.  

                                  HENNY
                    I sure wish you d change your mind, 
                    Miss Cathy.

                                  CATHY
                    I need to make a fresh start.  This 
                    house is too sad with Carrie gone.  

                                  HENNY 
                    It s not the house that s sad.
                          (lightly)
                    I better go check on those biscuits 
                    I m making you.  That s one thing 
                    you can t get up in Virginia. 

      Henny crosses off just as Christopher enters.  He watches 
      silently as Cathy packs her last suitcase.  

                                  CATHY
                    Almost ready.  Can you give me a 
                    hand with the zipper?  

      He helps her shut the overstuffed suitcase, then, imploring;

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Don t go.

                                  CATHY
                    We ve been through this. 

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    It won t change anything.  What s 
                    past is past...  

                                  CATHY
                    Maybe for you.  You still have your 
                    dreams.  You get to be a doctor.  
                    And I... 

      She trails off, glancing at her old ballet toe-shoes, 
      abandoned on the dresser.  Christopher looks anguished.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    The car accident, it was my fault. 
                      I shouldn t have pushed Julian...  
                    Cathy, I m sorry-- 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:6262

                                  CATHY
                    Don t you get it?!  It s Corrine s 
                    fault.  Cory s death-- now 
                    Carrie s.  All of it.  She s the 
                    reason all of this happened!  
                          (then)
                    And now she s going to pay.

      She grabs her bag, heads to the door.  But he stops her.  
      Takes her by the shoulders.  

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Don t stoop to her level, Cathy, 
                    we re better than that.  *

                                  CATHY
                    Are we?   *

      She KISSES him on the lips.  This time, Christopher pulls *
      away, upset.  Cathy shakes her head knowingly.*

                                  CATHY (CONT D)*
                    I m tired of pretending *
                      everything s normal.  I can t *
                    forgive mom for what she did to us.  *
                    I won t.   *

      She pushes him away then exits.  He calls after her.  Pained.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    If you do this... don t bother 
                    coming back.

                                  CATHY
                    Believe me.  There s no going back 
                    now.



      An upscale law office.  Cathy waits patiently, flipping 
      through a magazine.  She wears a smart, form-fitting dress 
      and heels, her makeup a shade heavier than usual.  Finally, a 
      SECRETARY approaches. 

                                  SECRETARY
                    Ms. Sheffield?  We re ready for you 
                    now.

      Cathy checks her hair, lipstick, then sweeps into the inner 

      Bart Winslow, in business attire.  He gets up from his desk, 
      puts out his hand. 

                                  BART
                      A pleasure to meet you, Ms. 
                      Sheffield.

                                  CATHY
                          (gently correcting him)
                    Cathy.  And the pleasure s all 
                    mine. 

      She smiles warmly, holding his hand a beat too long.  Bart 
      can t help but notice.



      Dr. Reeves works on a file.  Christopher pokes his head in. 

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Dr. Reeves, you wanted to see me? 

                                  DR. REEVES
                    Please, sit down.

      Christopher sits down, a bit wary.

                                  DR. REEVES (CONT D)
                      Christopher, I realize it s hard to *
                    focus on your work since your *
                    sister died.   *

                                  CHRISTOPHER*
                          (a little defensive)*
                    About the Thompson case, he didn t *
                    exhibit any signs of a previous *
                    stroke--  *

                                  DR. REEVES
                          (stopping him)
                    Nobody s perfect-- even doctors.  
                    Luckily, we caught it in time.*

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Well, it won t happen again.  I can 
                    promise you that.

      Dr. Reeves takes a beat, then, more personally;





                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:6565

                                  DR. REEVES
                    Look, being a doctor is a 
                      tremendous privilege.  People treat 
                    you like a God.  But with that, 
                    comes a great deal of 
                      responsibility... pressure.  
                          (then, meaningfully)
                    What keeps you grounded-- what 
                    really matters-- is having a family 
                    to come home to. 

      Christopher takes this in, nods.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Of course, you re right.  Just-- I 
                    don t think Cathy s coming back.  

      Dr. Reeves gives Christopher a funny look, then; 

                                  DR. REEVES
                    I was talking about Sarah.   



      Corrine and Bart eat dinner.  The conversation is a little 
      forced-- like any old, married couple.

                                  BART
                    I met a new client this week.  From 
                    South Carolina, near where I grew 
                    up.

                                    CORRINE
                          (barely listening)
                    That s nice, dear.

                                  BART
                    Made me think-- I d love for us to 
                    go back and visit one weekend.  See 
                    my brother and his kids?

                                    CORRINE
                    I really don t have time right now. 

                                  BART
                          (rolls his eyes)
                    With what-- another one of your 
                    luncheons or shopping sprees?  Or *
                    does your dear, sweet mother need *
                    you to comb out her wig again?*

                                    CORRINE
                    Actually, it does sort of involve *
                    her.  All these years, she s *
                    refused to move out of Foxworth *
                    Hall, and it s just gone to seed.  *
                    Well, I ve finally had enough.  I m *
                    finally going ahead and restoring *
                    it.*

      This gets Bart s attention.  And he doesn t sound happy.

                                  BART
                    Are you serious?*

                                  CORRINE*
                    Why not?  My mother s not going to *
                    live forever.  Her mind s a *
                    fraction of what it used to be so *
                    we can just work around her.*

                                  BART*
                    Corrine, this is an expensive *
                      proposition.  *
                            (pointedly)*
                    And stressful.  *


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:6767

                                  CORRINE*
                    What s that supposed to mean? *

                                  BART*
                    You know exactly what I mean.  *
                          (then, softer)*
                    Look, honey, I just don t want you *
                    getting in over your head.*

                                    CORRINE
                    Foxworth Hall used to be of the *
                    finest houses in Virginia.  With *
                    some money, and proper guidance, I 
                    can finally live in a suitable 
                    estate.  

                                  BART
                          (stung)
                    I didn t realize I was holding you 
                    back here.

      Corrine puts on a sugary voice, smile.  Rubs Bart s shoulder.

                                    CORRINE
                    Oh, honey, I didn t mean it like 
                    that.
                          (then)
                    Just-- I have a responsibility to 
                    my family.  If I don t carry on the 
                    Foxworth name, who will?  There s 
                    nobody else.



      Cathy waits in Bart s office.  She looks at various framed 
      photos of him and Corrine-- posing happily, on various trips.  
      She picks up one photograph-- it s from the Christmas party 
      ten years earlier, where she and Christopher were hiding.  
      Bart enters.  He looks distracted.  Cathy s startled, quickly *
      puts on a smile.  

                                  BART 
                    Hope I haven t kept you waiting.  *
                    Just dealing with my mother-in-law.  *
                    Another one of her nurses quit.  *

      Cathy ears perk up, but she tries to sound casually *
      sympathetic.*

                                  CATHY*
                    Oh?  I hope she s not too sick.*




                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:6868

                                  BART*
                    Believe me, she ll outlive us all.  *
                    Running my wife in circles seems to *
                    keep her going.*

                                  CATHY*
                          (re: Christmas photo)*
                    Is this her--your wife?  She s *
                    pretty.  

                                  BART
                    Yes, very.  But that was taken a 
                    while ago.

                                  CATHY
                          (re: other photos)
                    I don t see any children...?   

                                  BART
                    No.  She, uh-- Corrine couldn t 
                    have any.

      Cathy senses something in Bart-- ambivalence... regret?  She 
      goes with it.

                                  CATHY
                    Well, kids can be a real handful.  
                    Making noise, destroying your 
                      furniture... Getting in your way.

                                  BART
                    Now you re starting to sound like 
                    her.

      Cathy bites her lip.  Busted.  

                                  CATHY
                    Actually, I was just saying that... 
                          (then)
                    I really love children.  I m hoping 
                    to have a boy and a girl, no more 
                    than two years apart, maybe even 
                    twins--  
                          (stops herself)
                    Uch, listen to me-- I don t even 
                    have a boyfriend yet.  You must 
                    think I m an awful kook.

                                  BART
                    No.  I- I think you seem great.

      He smiles at her.  Sincere, vulnerable, with a hint of 
      longing.  Cathy smiles back-- she can t help but like him.  
      Then, back to business.  Bart grabs her file.   


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED: (2)6868

                    So I ve looked over the additional 
                    insurance claim for your car 
                    accident.  I can probably get it

                    your expenses down. 

                                  CATHY
                    No.  Take all the time you need.

                    You come into a little money,

      Thanksgiving.  Christopher celebrates with Sarah, Dr. Reeves 
      and their EXTENDED FAMILY.  

                                  DR. REEVES
                    ...I ll tell you what I m most 
                    thankful for this year. 

                                  SARAH
                          (guessing)
                    Your family, friends... health? 

                                  DR. REEVES
                    Your pecan pie.  

      Everyone chuckles, including Sarah. 

                                  SARAH
                    Well, you can thank Henny for that.  
                    It s her recipe.  
                          (turns to Christopher)
                    What do you think, honey?  Is it as 
                    good as hers?

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                            (distracted)
                    Yeah, sure.  

      Concerned, Sarah pulls Christopher aside. 

                                  SARAH
                          (sweetly)
                    You re thinking about Carrie, *
                    aren t you?  I know how rough it is *
                    during the holidays... *
                          (gingerly)*

                                  SARAH (CONT'D)
                    If you and Cathy would just talk-- *
                    you two need each other at times *
                    like this.*

                                  CHRISTOPHER*
                    What?  No.  I m fine.*
                          (pulling back)
                    Just-- I ate too much, that s all.  

      He gives her a quick kiss.  But Sarah looks at his plate, 
      worried-- he s barely touched his food.  



      Cathy s getting dressed up-- slinky cocktail dress, makeup.  
      She dabs some perfume behind her ears, then knees.  Suddenly, 
      there s a KNOCK on the door.  That s odd.  She opens it to 
      find...   

                                  CATHY
                    Sarah?  What-- what re you doing 
                    here?  Sorry, come in...

      Sarah smiles wanly, hands Cathy a Christmas gift. 

                                  SARAH
                    I m up visiting a friend and I 
                    thought I d drop off Christopher s 
                    Christmas present.

      Cathy opens the gift.  It s a SILK SCARF-- the kind Sarah 
      often wears.

                                  CATHY
                            (suspicious)
                      Christopher got this for me?

      Sarah bites her lip, a bit guilty.  Then confesses.

                                  SARAH
                    He doesn t know I m here.  Seeing 
                    you.

      They both take a seat.

                                  SARAH (CONT D)
                    Look, I know this isn t my place, 
                    but I was hoping you two could 
                    patch things up.  I know he misses 
                    you-- I can tell.  

                                  CATHY
                    It s complicated...


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:7070

                                  SARAH
                    How?  You re family.  Isn t that 
                    the most important thing-- how much 
                    you need each other?  Especially 
                    since Carrie died.  

                                  CATHY
                          (tightens)
                    You wouldn t understand.

                                  SARAH
                          (firmly)
                    You don t know me.    

      Cathy looks at Sarah, surprised at her tone.  Sarah 
      continues.

                                  SARAH (CONT D)
                    It was right before Christmas.  I 
                    was twelve, and my mother got us 
                    tickets to the Nutcracker in 
                      Charleston-- we used to go every 
                    year.  But I was too old by then, 
                    wanted to go to a party with my 
                      friends... see some boy I had a 
                    crush on.  She was upset, but I 
                    didn t care.  I told her I d rather 
                    die than go to some stupid 
                      children s show with her.  So she 
                    went without me.
                          (voice cracks)
                    The next morning, there was an ice 
                    storm... the train derailed...
                          (looks in Cathy s eyes)
                      I wouldn t want anyone to live with 
                    that kind of regret.  Not you, and 
                      especially not Christopher.  

                                  CATHY
                    I-- I ll think about it.  

                                  SARAH
                    Please, Cathy.  Before our wedding--

                                  CATHY
                    What?

      Sarah breaks into a smile, flashes her ring finger-- there s 
      a DIAMOND RING on it.  

                                  SARAH
                    We re getting married in a few 
                    months.  And I was hoping you d be 
                    my maid of honor.   


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED: (2)7070

      Cathy nods, a little choked up.  Sarah hugs her, then checks 
      her watch.  

                                  SARAH (CONT D)
                    I wish I had more time but I m 
                    meeting my friend-- unless you want 
                    to join us?!

                                  CATHY
                    I can t.  I have plans.

      Now Sarah notices Cathy s cocktail dress, the perfume.  Puts 
      two and two together. 

                                  SARAH
                    I m glad.  You deserve someone who 
                    thinks you re special.  Like your 
                      brother... the way he is with me.



      An upscale restaurant.  Sarah, a little nervous, approaches 
      the MAITRE D .

                                  MAITRE D 
                    Good evening.  Do you have a 
                      reservation?

                                  SARAH
                    I m meeting a friend--
                          (spots someone across 
                            room)
                    Oh, I see her. 

      Sarah eagerly walks over to greet... Corrine. 

                                  SARAH (CONT D)
                    This place is beautiful.  Thank you 
                    so much for inviting me.
                          (notices)
                    Your husband couldn t make it?

                                    CORRINE
                    Bart had to work late.  So it ll 
                    just be us girls.



      Cathy and Bart, in a closed-door  meeting.   *





                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:7272

                                  CATHY
                    You sure your wife s not going to 
                    miss you tonight?

                                  BART
                    The only thing my wife s concerned 
                    about these days is Foxworth Hall.

                                  CATHY
                    What?

                                  BART
                    Her family estate.  She s got all 
                    kinds of plans to fix it up.  From *
                    the ground up.*

                                  CATHY*
                    Isn t... her mother still living *
                    there?  *

                                  BART*
                          (nods)*
                    I think Corrine s doing it to spite *
                    her.  Show her mother who s really *
                    in control.  All these years, those *
                    two can t stand each other... and *
                    yet, something s keeping them *
                    together. *

                                  CATHY*

                    The ties that bind.*
                          (dawns on her)*
                    Wait, surely you re not going to *
                    move in there--?*

                                  BART*
                    That s what Corrine s hoping.  *
                      Apparently being a lawyer s wife *
                    isn t  grand  enough for her. *
                          (then)
                    Funny, but I was the one who 
                    planned out her father s legacy.  
                    Now I have to live up to it.

      Cathy takes this in a moment, then;

                                  CATHY
                    It s sad.  Some women don t 
                      appreciate what they have... even 
                    when it s right in front of them.

                                  BART
                    But not you?


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED: (2)7272

                                  CATHY
                    No.  
                          (sly smile)
                    I know exactly what I want.

      She and Bart KISS... then fall back onto his couch!  

                                  END OF ACT FIVE                                        ACT SIX



      Henny helps Sarah carry in several boxes of wedding-related 
      items (charts, menus, tulle, etc....) 

                                  SARAH
                    ... I swear, Henny, this wedding is 
                    taking over my life.  And we still 
                    have to decide on the menu, choose 
                    the flower arrangements... 
                          (looking around)
                    Where is Christopher, anyway?

                                  HENNY
                    Upstairs, taking a rest.  He had a 
                    late night at the hospital, bless *
                    his soul.*

                                  SARAH
                    Just as well-- I can get a head-
                    start on the seating chart.  Lord 
                    knows half my family s in a snit 
                    with the other half.

      They both chuckle, then; 

                                  HENNY
                    Did Miss Cathy ever get back to 
                    you?   

      Sarah s grin fades.   

                                  SARAH
                    Not yet.  

                                  HENNY
                    It s still a few weeks away.  And *
                    I ve been praying extra hard that *
                    she ll make it.   *

                                  SARAH
                    I hope so.  It s the most important 
                    day of our lives.  It wouldn t seem 
                    right not having his sister there. 

      Henny smiles sympathetically, then crosses off.   Sarah 
      settles down to work.  After a beat, she hears Christopher 

      Christopher s asleep in bed.  He s having a nightmare, 
      calling out in his sleep. 

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                          (upset)
                    Cory... Cory, you re gonna be okay!  
                    Oh God, Cory, no--! 

      Sarah shakes Christopher awake.

                                  SARAH
                      Christopher, honey... wake up! 

      He startles awake.  Looks shaken, out of breath.

                                  SARAH (CONT D)
                    It s okay.  You were just having a 
                    bad dream.  

      She hands him a glass of water, wipes his brow. 

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Thanks.  I guess I m just under a 
                    lot of stress.  With work, and 
                      everything.

                                   SARAH
                    Of course, honey.  I totally

                          (then)
                    Who s Cory?  
                          (off his look)
                    You were calling out his name.

      Christopher takes a breath, unsure-- or unwilling to explain.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    He was my brother.  Carrie s twin.

                                  SARAH
                          (hurt)
                    You never mentioned him.  

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    He died eleven years ago.  I m 
                    sorry, I should ve told you, but I- 
                    I don t like to talk about it...

      Christopher looks pained.  Sarah pulls him into a warm 
      embrace, soothing him. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:7474

                                  SARAH
                    It s okay, sweetie.  Now that we re 
                    going to be married, we don t have 
                    to have any more secrets. 



      Cathy and Bart lie in bed together, post- Afternoon Delight.   
      Bart gazes admiringly at Cathy, running his fingers down her 
      cheek, then neck...

                                  BART*
                    Do you ever miss it-- dancing, I *
                    mean.*

      She looks taken aback.  Bart feels bad.*

                                  BART (CONT D)*
                    I m sorry, I didn t mean--*

                                  CATHY*
                    No, it s okay.  Nobody ever asks me *
                    that.  *
                          (then)*
                    But yes, a lot.  Sometimes I dream *
                    I can still dance.  I m on a big *
                    stage, the orchestra s playing and *
                    I m Sleeping Beauty, or the White *
                    Swan... or Giselle.  That s the *
                    hardest part-- waking up and *
                    realizing I ll never be anybody.*

      Bart takes this in a moment, then; *

                                  BART*
                    You ll always be somebody, Cathy. *
                    Don t let anyone tell you *
                      otherwise.*

      She looks into his eyes, kisses him tenderly.  She s really *
      falling for him.   Their kiss heats up when Bart suddenly 
      notices the time.  He jumps out of bed, starts getting 
      dressed.

                                  BART (CONT D)
                    Uch, I have to go.

                                  CATHY
                    Can t you stay a little longer?

                                  BART
                    I wish I could but I have to go to 
                    some  society  party.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:7575

                                  CATHY
                          (tugging at his belt)
                    Just say you have to work late. 

                                  BART
                    I ve done that the last three 
                    times.  I promised Corrine I 
                    wouldn t miss this one.  

      Frustrated, Cathy lies back in bed.  Stews.  

                                  CATHY
                    She doesn t even care about you.  
                    She just wants someone to show off.  
                    Make her look good.

      Bart looks at her.  Puzzled.*

                                  BART
                    How would you know?

      Cathy s flustered, quickly tries to cover. 

                                  CATHY
                    From-- from what you ve told me.    
                          (then)
                    I just think you deserve better.  
                    Someone who wants what you want... 
                    who can give you a family.

      Bart tightens, gets a bit defensive.   *

                                  BART*
                    She s not so bad.  *

                                  CATHY*
                          (pushing him)*
                    Then why are you with me?  Or am I *
                    just another  important client ? *

                                  BART*
                    No.  Of course not.  I ve never *
                    done anything like this before.*
                          (then)*
                    Truth is, Corrine and I have been *
                    together for years but sometimes, I *
                    feel like I don t really know her *
                    at all.  *
                          (pulls back)*
                    Look, Corrine has her issues, God *
                    knows... but none of us is perfect.  *
                    Yet, there s something about her *
                    that draws me in.  *

                    time, so vulnerable... like a child *

                    In some ways, you remind me of her. 



      A gracious home.  Well-heeled SOCIETY-TYPES enter the festive 
      cocktail party.  Cathy approaches, somewhat (but not 
      comically) concealed in a long coat and scarf.  A UNIFORMED 
      COAT CHECK greets her at the front door.

                                  COAT CHECK 
                    Welcome to the Hollingers.  May I 
                    take your coat? 

                                  CATHY
                    Oh, that s alright.  I m only 
                    stopping by for a minute.  

      Cathy peers in, gazing at the BEAUTIFUL PARTY-GOERS, 
      UNIFORMED WAITERS, free-flowing CHAMPAGNE.  She s in awe-- 
      much like she was at the Christmas party at Foxworth Hall a 
      decade earlier.  She almost gets lost in the grandeur when 
      suddenly... 

      Corrine and Bart approach.  Cathy DUCKS behind a doorway, 
      eavesdrops.

                                    CORRINE
                    ... And the architect says he can 
                    restore all the original woodwork 
                    in the library--

                                  BART
                    Can we please spend one evening not 
                    talking about Foxworth Hall?

      Corrine freezes, stares at him.  Then softens.

                                    CORRINE
                    You re right.  I ve been so caught 
                    up in my own project... I ve been 
                      completely neglecting you.

                                  BART
                          (taken aback)
                    It s okay, Corrine-- 

                                    CORRINE
                          (laying it on thick)
                    No, it s not.

                    I want to hear about you.  Tell me 
                    about your work... that client 
                    you ve been working with so much... 
                    from South Carolina?

                                  BART
                            (uncomfortable)
                    You know I can t talk about my 
                    clients.

      Sensing his distance, Corrine goes in for the kill.  She 
      presses him against the doorway, within a few feet of Cathy 
      on the other side.

                                    CORRINE
                    Darling, don t you know how much I 
                    love you?  I d be lost without you.  *
                    Please say you ll forgive me... 
                    that you love me, too. 

                                  BART
                    Of course I love you.

      Corrine leans in closer.  Runs her fingers through the back 
      of his hair, her lips brushing lightly against his ear.  Bart 
      starts to melt.

                                    CORRINE
                    Promise that you ll never leave me.

                                  BART
                    I never will.

      They kiss.  On the other side of the doorway, Cathy chokes *
      back a sob.  She knows Bart really means it.



      Christopher and Sarah s rehearsal dinner.  Various GUESTS 
      mingle over drinks, appetizers.  A MARRIED COUPLE (50s) chat 
      with the almost-newlyweds.

                    Sarah s done all of the real 
                    planning.

                                  SARAH
                    Only because you re working so 
                    hard, honey. 
                          (to guests)
                    Now if only his mean boss would 
                    give him a week off for the 
                      honeymoon. 

      Just then, Dr. Reeves approaches.

                                  DR. REEVES
                          (joking)
                    My ears are burning. 

      He looks relaxed, proud-- gives Sarah a kiss.

                                  SARAH
                    Daddy, can t you spare your star 
                    resident for a few measly days--?

                          (cutting her off)
                    Alright, I was going to surprise 
                    you later tonight but... I booked 
                    you two a week in Bermuda.  You 
                    leave right after the reception. 

      He pulls two airline tickets out of his jacket.  Sarah 
      squeals with delight, hugs her dad.  Christopher s surprised.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Dr. Reeves, you shouldn t have--

                    I m just glad my daughter finally 
                    made an honest man out of you. 

      He throws his arms around Christopher.  Suddenly, Sarah 
      notices someone across the room.

                                  SARAH
                    Cathy?




                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED: (2)7777

      Christopher whips around.  Cathy s standing there with her 
      suitcase.  Grimaces at Christopher.

                                  CATHY
                    You didn t think I d miss my 
                    brother s wedding?



      Late night, the house is silent.  Cathy pads down the stairs 
      in her nightgown.  Heads to the kitchen where she finds... 



        Christopher, awake, looking anxious.  Nursing a glass of 
      something that s clearly not warm milk.  

                                  CATHY
                    Guess I m not the only one who 
                    couldn t sleep.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    I m fine.  Just I have a lot on my 
                    mind, with work.

                                  CATHY
                    Sarah s asleep?

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                          (shakes his head)
                    At her dad s house.  Bad luck to 
                    see the bride the night before the 
                    wedding. 

      Cathy sits down beside him.  Christopher takes another swig 
      of his drink.  She notices, just shy of amused.

                                  CATHY
                    Since when do you drink whiskey?

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    You don t know everything about me.

      A tense beat, then, she tries to console him;*

                                  CATHY*
                    Sarah s great, you know.  She s *

                    Yes, definitely.  She just wants me *
                    to be happy.  Just-- I d be happier *
                    if I knew you were okay.   *

                                  CATHY
                    I am.  *

                                  CHRISTOPHER*
                    Cath, you don t have to say that *
                    for me--*

                                  CATHY*
                    I m not.*
                          (gingerly)*
                    Actually, I m in love.  For real, *
                    this time. *

      That gets Christopher s attention.  He stares at her, 
        incredulous.  Not wanting to believe it.  She continues. *

                                  CATHY (CONT D)*
                    It started out as a way to get back *
                    at our mother, but then, we grew *
                    closer... I m sure if you just got *
                    to know Bart--*

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    What--?!  *

      Upset, he gets up from the table.  Pounds his fist into the 
      wall.  Cathy jumps up to comfort him.  

                                  CATHY
                    Please, you have to understand... 
                    this is the best thing for both of *
                    us--*

      But Christopher s overcome with jealousy.  Coming apart after *
      holding it together for so long.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    You can t love him.  He doesn t 
                      understand you.  Not like I do.*

      He grabs Cathy by the shoulders.  Pained, almost irrational.

                                    CHRISTOPHER (CONT D)
                    When we were locked up together, 
                    you said you would always love me.  
                    Nobody would ever come between us.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED: (2)7979

                                  CATHY
                    I know.  And I do love you, but *
                    it s wrong.  You know that.*

      Distraught, Christopher falls into her arms.  Cathy tries to 
      comfort him, holding him in her arms.  But their embrace 
      quickly heats up again.  They start to KISS, hands going *
      everywhere, clothes being ripped off.  Even Cathy gets caught *
      up in the moment.  Too caught up to notice when Sarah walks *
      in.  

                                  SARAH (O.S.)
                    ... Christopher, I m sorry to *
                    bother you, I just needed to grab *
                    some things for the honeymoon--

      Sarah stares at Cathy and Christopher for a moment, not quite 
      understanding what she s seeing-- or not wanting to.  Cathy 
      and Christopher freeze, immediately drop what they were 
      doing.  But it s too late.  Sarah s innocent but she s not 
      dumb.  And she s devastated! 

                                  END OF ACT SIX                                      ACT SEVEN



        Christopher, more solemn than ever, packs up his black 
      doctor s bag-- it s new with shiny leather, silver hardware 
      and freshly stitched monogram.  Henny enters.

                                  HENNY
                    The people from the church are 
                    here.  For the furniture.   

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    They can go ahead and take it.  
                    Even this-- 
                          (hands her the kit)
                    I won t have much use for it 
                    anymore.

      Henny hesitates, then lays a gentle hand on Christopher.

                                  HENNY
                    Sarah was wrong.  What folks are *
                    saying about you and Cathy-- I know 
                    it s not true.   You re good and 
                    kind and Godly, the way Dr. *
                    Sheffield raised you-- 

      But Christopher stops her, anguished.  Ashamed.*

                                  CHRISTOPHER*
                    It s true, Henny.  All of it.  *

      A tense beat as Christopher waits for her horror, her *
      disgust.  But surprisingly, Henny pulls him into a tight *
      embrace.  Consoling him with affection, kindness.  *

                                  HENNY*
                    I don t care what anyone s told *
                    you, Christopher.  The Lord is *
                    merciful to all his children.  He *
                    will forgive you.   *

      Cathy enters.  Henny pulls her in, too.*

                                  HENNY (CONT D)*
                    Both of you.*

      Henny hugs them both.  She loves them, no matter what.  When *
      she leaves, Cathy and Christopher lock eyes.  Both too *
      overcome to speak.  Finally, Cathy picks up his doctor s bag.  *
      Hopeful.*



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:8080

                                  CATHY
                    You could still practice at a 
                    different hospital.  Out of the 
                    county... or state.  What we did 
                    shouldn t take away from all your 
                    years of hard work--  

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                          (firmly)*
                    It s over, Cathy.  Don t you get 
                    it?  I m finished.  We both are.  

                                  CATHY
                    Don t say that--*

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    It s the truth.  
                          (then, calmer)
                    Look, I ve been thinking about it 
                    all week.  We ll go to California, 
                    start a new life together... where 
                    nobody will know we re brother and 
                    sister...  

                                  CATHY
                      Christopher, you know what you re *
                    asking-- you want us to live a lie? *

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    It s not a lie.  You re the only *
                    person I could ever love or trust.  
                    And I don t want to hurt anyone 
                    else.

      She considers this but then; *

                                  CATHY*
                    I can t.*

                                  CHRISTOPHER*
                    Please, Cathy.  What else is out 
                    there?  

      Cathy looks hard at Christopher.  She wants to tell him 
        something... but can t.  Instead, she just shakes her head.

                                  CATHY
                    I m sorry but I m done running from *

      The furniture is covered in sheets, tools and building 
      materials litter the floor.  It doesn t look abandoned-- more 
      like a construction site.  Cathy quickly heads upstairs to... 



      The kids  old  stomping ground  which hasn t changed much.  
      Their  fake garden  is still intact, as is their homemade 
      swing, now covered in dust and cobwebs.  She even finds the 
      wall with her homemade calendar, lightly running her fingers 
      over the faded X s and her child-like inscription.  It seems 
      so familiar and at the same time, from another lifetime.

      Suddenly, she finds Cory s SNAIL CUT-OUT, the same one he 
      showed off in FITA -- and a rush of memories come flooding 
      back.

      INSERT AUDIO: A random sampling of moments from FITA -- the 
      kids playing, Cory finding the mouse, their grandmother 
      screaming for help. 

      It s too overwhelming and Cathy quickly runs downstairs.



      Cathy s heading out when she hears someone calling from a 
      nearby bedroom.  

                                  WOMAN (O.S.)
                    Martha, is that you--?! 

      Cathy freezes.  It s her grandmother!  

                                    GRANDMOTHER (WOMAN) (O.S.)
                    Martha, hurry up and fasten my 
                    gown!  Mr. Foxworth and I are 
                    expecting guests! 


      Her grandmother lying in bed.  She s ten years older-- frail, 
      a scarf covering her thinning scalp, in a yellowed nightgown 
      and confused expression.  A tense beat as Cathy takes this 
      in, then; 

                                  CATHY
                    I- I m not Martha.

      Olivia instantly snaps into focus, narrows her eyes at Cathy.  
      She hasn t lost her wits entirely... nor her mean streak.

                                  OLIVIA 
                    I know exactly who you are.  
                          (grimaces)
                    What s taken you so long?

                                  CATHY
                    I ve been living, making up for 
                    what you stole from me.  From all 
                    of us.  You talk about being Godly.  
                    But you made our lives a living 
                    hell for two years--

      But the grandmother cuts her off.  Lashes back.

                                    GRANDMOTHER
                    Two years?  Try sixty trapped in 
                    this godforsaken house.  My husband 
                    turned against me, then my 
                      daughter... Only I didn t leave-- I 
                    wouldn t.  I held the keys, and the 
                    power.  And now...?  I m the 
                    prisoner.  I always have been.  
                          (then)
                    You have no idea how easy you had 
                    it.

      Cathy softens, has a flicker of sympathy.  Then remembers 
      something. 

                                  CATHY
                    What about Cory?  He was only 
                    six...

                                    GRANDMOTHER
                    Then I d consider him lucky. 

      Angry, Cathy grabs a poker from the fireplace, raises it over 
      her head-- but the Grandmother doesn t flinch. 





                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:8585

                                    GRANDMOTHER (CONT D)
                    Go ahead.  Do what you want.  I m 
                    dying anyway. 

      Cathy gathers her courage, raises the poker higher... The 
      grandmother just sneers.

                                    GRANDMOTHER (CONT D)
                    But my blood will still be running 
                    through your veins.  And Corrine 
                    will still be your mother.  You are 
                    who you are.  Who you will always 
                    be... the devil s spawn.

                                  CATHY
                    I m not like my mother!  Like any 
                    of you.  Blood or not, you re 
                    nothing to me.  Nothing.

      Angry, she throws down the poker and turns to leave.  But the 
      grandmother grabs Cathy s sleeve, hoists herself close to 
      tell her one last thing.  Calmly... knowingly.

                                    GRANDMOTHER
                    You can leave Foxworth Hall.  But *
                    you will never escape this family. *



      Christopher makes a call from the payphone.  *

                                  CHRISTOPHER*
                          (on phone)*
                    ... You re sure there are no *
                    records?  And you checked under all *
                    the different names, spellings...?   *
                    Yeah, alright, thanks. *

      He hangs up, despondent.  Stares at the yellow pages, opened *
      to  HOSPITALS. *

                                  MOTEL CLERK*
                    Hey, you ve been on all day.  Other *
                    guests gotta use the phone.*

                                  CHRISTOPHER*

      Cathy reads a a newspaper article announcing the Christmas *
      party celebrating Foxworth Hall s restoration, including a *
      photograph of Corrine and Bart together.  *

      Upset, she tosses away the newspaper, along with all her *
      family mementos-- photographs, souvenirs, clippings.  Even *
      the ring her father gave her. *

      Suddenly, Cathy clutches her stomach... and runs to the *
      bathroom.  Vomits.*



      The grandmother lies in bed, half-asleep, a pile of *
      newspapers at her bedside.  Corrine slips in, now wearing an *
      elegant gown, her hair and makeup done to perfection.  She *
      holds up a garment bag.   *

                                  CORRINE*
                    I ve brought you a new dress for *
                    the party, mother.  *

                                  GRANDMOTHER*
                          (sizing her up)*
                    If it s anything like yours, I d be *
                    better off in my dressing gown.*

                                  CORRINE*
                          (tightens)*
                    Now, now.  We all have to put on *
                    our best face tonight.  Even you.*

                                  GRANDMOTHER*
                    Your father s not going to approve *
                    of all this, Corrine.  Not after I *
                    speak to him.*

                                  CORRINE*
                    Father s not here, remember?  And *
                    besides, I m the lady of the house *
                    now.  I don t need his approval.  *
                    Or yours. *



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:8989

      Corrine takes the wig from the wig-stand, tries to hand it to *
      her mother.  But she swipes it away. *

                                  GRANDMOTHER*
                    You re nothing in this house.   *

      This makes Corrine mad.  She lashes back.*

                                  CORRINE*
                    I am everything.  Father left it *
                    all to me-- the house, the money *
                    and the name-- to do as I please.  *
                            (pointedly)*
                    And in case you ve forgotten, to *
                    pay for your care... or not.*

      Corrine glares at her mother, who just smirks back.*

                                  GRANDMOTHER*
                    It s true, Corrine.  My memory *
                    isn t what it used to be, but I *
                    haven t forgotten everything.   I *
                    remember certain things quite well.    *
                    The sweet smell of the wisteria in *
                    the spring... the acrid taste of *
                    your father s favorite bourbon. And *
                    the sound of children above.  *
                    Laughing, playing... crying-- *

      Corrine s face crumples.  Upset, she throws the dress aside.*

                                  CORRINE*
                    Enough!  Stay in your room for all *
                    I care.  Tonight is my night.*
                          (dismissive)*
                    Besides, nobody s interested in an *
                    old lady who spends her days *
                    screaming at nurses and poring *
                    through the obituaries.   *

      Corrine heads out when her mother calls after her, pleading.  *

                                  GRANDMOTHER*
                    Corrine, please, wait--! *

      She turns to look at her frail mother, who seems scared, *
      vulnerable even.   *

                                    GRANDMOTHER (CONT D)*
                    You re right, Corrine, it s true.  *
                    I- I m not good for much anymore...  *
                    But I did find one you might find *
                      interesting.*



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED: (2)8989

      She reaches her shaky hand to Corrine, passing her one *
      obituary from her nightstand-- it s Carrie s.*



      The party s in full swing.  Free-flowing champagne, live 
      music and admiring GUESTS.  At center is Corrine, soaking up 
      the attention and champagne in equal amounts.  But she seems *
      distracted, unnerved.  Still, Bart proudly stands by her *
      side, makes up for her (pharmaceutical) jitters.*

                                  BART*
                      ...Corrine and I fell in love at *
                    this same party eleven years ago.   *
                    Didn t we, honey?*

                                  CORRINE*
                    What?  Yes, of course.  I can *
                    hardly remember...*

                                  MALE GUEST*
                    Well, it looks even more *
                      spectacular.  
                          (lightly)*
                    And I wasn t talking about the *
                    house.

      They all laugh.  Then Corrine notices something. *

                                    CORRINE
                    Oh, dinner s almost ready.  I have 
                    to cue the band and pass out the *
                      sparklers-- and where is all the *
                      champagne?   *

      Bart follows Corrine, who s already emptied her glass.  Now *
      he follows her to a corner, surreptitiously rifling through *
      her purse (or a drawer) for some pills.*

                                  BART*
                    Honey, I ll take care of *
                      everything.  Try to relax and enjoy *
                      yourself...  *
                          (re: pills, quietly)*
                    Without these. *

                                  CORRINE*
                          (snaps)*
                    Not tonight, Bart.  Please.*

      Corrine grabs a handful, walks back into the party.  Bart *
      looks unsure but backs off-- there are too many people *

      By the band, Bart speaks with the band leader, who starts *
      winding down the music.  Behind him, a woman approaches.

                                  CATHY (O.S.)
                    Do they take requests?  I m in the 
                    mood for Auld Lang Syne.  

      Bart spins around... and turns ASHEN.  It s CATHY-- in the 
      same gold dress that Corrine wore ten years previous.  But 
      Bart s so panicked, he doesn t quite put it together.

                                  BART
                    Cathy?!  What re you doing here?  
                    You have to leave...*

                                  CATHY
                    And miss the Foxworth Christmas 
                    party?  It s a family tradition.  *
                    So is the dress.  Don t you *
                    recognize it?*

                                  BART
                    I don t understand...  *

                                  CATHY  
                    Ask her. 

      Cathy gestures to Corrine, a few yards behind him.  Corrine s 
      frozen in shock, staring daggers at Cathy.  By now, the 
      band s stopped playing, and the entire room has gone silent.  
      If Bart hasn t recognized the resemblance (and dress), 
      everyone else has.   Everyone watches as Corrine manages to 
      spew out a weak-if-venomous greeting. 

                                    CORRINE
                    You.*

                                  BART
                          (perplexed)
                    You two know each other?*

      Cathy nods, then grimaces at Corrine.

                                  CATHY
                    Merry Christmas, mother.   

      There s a collective gasp as Bart quickly whisks both women 

      Bart frantically negotiates between the two women.  Tries to *
      reason with Cathy, hold his temper.*

                                  BART
                    ...Look, maybe I led you on, Cathy, *
                    but I never told you I d leave my *
                    wife.  You have no right to try to *
                    come into my home... destroy my *
                    family.   *

                                  CATHY
                    You mean, the way she destroyed her 
                    own family?  

                                    CORRINE
                    Don t listen to her, Bart.  She s 
                    lying.  She s just trying to get *
                    between us.

                                  BART*
                    How do you know her, Corrine?  How *
                    does she know you?*

                                  CORRINE*
                    She-- she s just some wannabe who *
                    reads the society pages.  You know *
                    how girls become obsessed with *
                    women they aspire to be... who have *
                    what they want.*

      Bart doesn t know who-- or what to believe.  But Cathy *
      continues.*

                                  CATHY
                    I saw you together ten years ago.  
                    At this same party. She was wearing 
                    this same dress when you met her *
                      upstairs... and asked to see her *
                     famous  swan bed. 

      A flicker of disbelief, horror as Bart realizes Cathy might 
      be telling the truth.   Cathy continues, dead-calm.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    Tell him, mother.  How you locked 
                    up your own children-- four of us-- 
                    so you wouldn t lose your 
                      inheritance. 

                                    CORRINE
                    It s not true...



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:9292

                                  CATHY
                    Tell him how we spent two years in 
                    that attic.  How you traveled all 
                    over the world while we were beaten 
                    and starved...  *

      Bart stares at Corrine, who begins to falter.

                                  BART
                      Corrine...?  *

                                    CORRINE
                          (weakly)
                    I-- I had no choice.  You drew up 
                    my father s will-- if I told him I 
                    had children, I would ve been left 
                    with nothing.  

                                  BART
                    How could you not tell me you had *
                      children?!  I could ve helped...*

      Desperate, Corrine tries harder to spin it her way.

                                    CORRINE
                    I wanted to, I did... but I was 
                    afraid of what you d say.  *
                          (then)
                    I was doing it for them-- for all 
                    of us!  I had a plan to get them *
                    out of the house, but they ran away 
                    first.  Bart, you know how hard my 
                    father was.  If he ever suspected, 
                    we would ve gotten nothing.  This 
                    was the only way, you have to 
                    believe me--! *

      Just then, the door swings open.  Behind Corrine, a man 
      speaks.  It s Christopher.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    What about Cory?

      Corrine turns ashen.  Cathy runs to her brother s side.

                                    CHRISTOPHER (CONT D)
                    You poisoned him.  Just like you 
                    were trying to poison us.  Only he *
                    died.   *

                                    CORRINE
                    That s not true.  He had pneumonia, *
                    the doctor said--



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED: (2)9292

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    There was no doctor, no hospital 
                    records either.  I called every *
                    hospital and clinic in three *
                    states.  There wasn t even a death *
                      certificate.

      Cathy lets out a sob-- it s the first she s heard this, too. 

                                    CHRISTOPHER (CONT D)*
                          (to Cathy)*
                    I just found out myself.  I came up *
                    to Virginia to tell you... I m *
                    sorry, Cathy.  This isn t how I *
                    wanted you to hear.*

      Cathy turns angrily to Corrine.*

                                  CATHY
                    You killed Cory.  You didn t even 
                    try to help him.  And then Carrie 
                    killed herself because of you.  
                    Because she d rather be dead than 
                    be your daughter.

      Christopher holds her tight.  Corrine looks over at Bart, who 
      backs away from her, horrified. 

                                    CORRINE
                    She s lying, Bart! You have to 
                    believe me.  I m your wife.  She s 
                    nobody, she s nothing to you.

      Now Cathy hits Corrine with the final blow.   

                                  CATHY
                    That s not true.  I- I m the mother 
                    of his children.

                                  BART
                    What?

                                  CATHY
                    I m pregnant... with your twins.

      Bart looks stunned... as does Christopher.  And Corrine is 
      utterly destroyed.  

                                  END OF ACT SEVEN                                      ACT EIGHT



      The party s cleared out, as if by a sudden cataclysm-- with 
      half-drunk glasses of champagne, ice sculptures melting onto 
      abandoned trays of appetizers.  Bart sits on the sofa, alone.  
      He looks bereft.  Cathy approaches tentatively.

                                  CATHY
                    Bart, I-- I m sorry.

                                  BART
                    Sorry for what?  Lying to me? 
                    Seducing me to get even with your 
                    mother... my wife?  For making me 
                    fall in love with you?  God, I 
                    don t even know what to believe 
                    anymore.  

      She sits beside him.

                                  CATHY
                    Look, it s true I sought you out 
                    just to get back at Corrine but... 
                    that s not how I feel now.  I do 
                    love you... More than you can 
                    imagine.  
                          (then)
                    And I understand if you don t feel 
                    the same way.  If I were you, I 
                    wouldn t either. 

      Bart looks anguished, turns to Cathy. 

                                  BART
                    Just tell me-- are you really 
                    having my children?

      Cathy nods.  Overwhelmed, Bart chokes back a sob. 



      Christopher s alone in attic, upset by Cathy s news.  He 
      looks around the familiar scene then LOSES his temper.  He 
      YANKS DOWN a few flowers, BREAKS the swing, tries to SCRUB 
      OUT Cathy s calendar with his bare fists, etc...  Finally, he 
      crumples onto the floor, head in his hands, too agonized to 
      keep going.  

      Just then, Corrine enters from the stairwell.  She approaches 
      gingerly, touches his shoulder.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:9494

                                    CORRINE
                    Darling, I- I ve been looking for 
                    you.

      He looks up at her, upset, his eyes red.  What does she want?  

                                    CORRINE (CONT D)*
                    I m so sorry.  This is all my *

                                  CORRINE*
                    I was selfish.  You warned me but I *
                    I was too caught up in my own *
                    feelings to listen.  If you d just *
                    forgive me.  You know how much I *
                    love you.*

      He softens a little-- he s been waiting a decade to hear *
      this.  But he shakes his head.*

                                  CHRISTOPHER*
                    It s too late...*

      Still, she smiles encouragingly. *

                                    CORRINE
                    You re going to be okay.  We both 
                    are.  Don t listen to what the 
                    others are saying.  We re going to 
                    start over.  

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    How?   *

                                    CORRINE
                    We ll move north-- to Pennsylvania 
                    or Connecticut.  Where nobody will 
                    know we re half-niece, half-uncle.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Mom--?

      Corrine smiles and clutches her stomach like she s pregnant.

                                    CORRINE
                    I think it s going to be a boy.  
                    We ll name him Christopher-- after 
                    you. 





                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED: (2)9494

      She tries to put his hand on her stomach but Christopher *
      flinches.  Suddenily, it dawns on him-- Corrine s having a *
      full-blown break with reality.   *



      Cathy tries to plead with Bart, who s unresponsive.  Still 
      trying to process all this.

                                  CATHY
                    I m sorry you had to hear this way.  
                    All these years, I ve carried so 
                    much anger... shame.   
                          (pained)
                    There s still so much you don t 
                    know about me.  Things I ve been 
                    through, and done.  You deserve 
                    better, Bart.  You always have.

      She starts to walk away when he finally looks up.

                                  BART
                          (softly) 
                    I don t care.

                                  CATHY
                    What?

                                  BART
                    I just-- I wish I d known what you *
                    went through.  If only she d told 
                    me back then... or if you d found *
                    me--!  How could I not know?

                                  CATHY
                    It s not your fault.  We were so 
                    young, and scared.  And we wanted *
                    to believe our mother.  We wanted *
                    her to love us.   *
                          (pained)*
                    Who could imagine anyone doing that 
                    to her own children? I could 
                    never...

      She touches her stomach, protectively... instinctively.  Bart 
      hushes Cathy, wraps his arms around her.

                                  BART
                    Cathy, I m here for you.  And our 
                    children.  That s all that matters 
                    now.  Just--*
                          (darkens)*

                                  BART (CONT'D)
                    I- I m sorry for having loved your *
                    mother.  At least the idea of her.  *
                    The truth is, it never felt right.  *
                    Like something was missing all 
                    along.

                                  CATHY
                    ...a family. 

                                  BART
                          (shakes his head)
                    You.

      He gazes into her eyes.  Cathy chokes back a sob-- she knows *
      he means it.  Despite everything, Bart takes her in his arms *
      and they KISS. *



      Christopher staggers back from Corrine. 

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Please.  You-- you don t know what 
                    you re saying.  

      But Corrine just gives him a sympathetic look.  

                                    CORRINE
                    Darling, I know we re giving up so 
                    much.  But we can finally be 
                    together.  Raise a family.  Just 
                    like we always dreamed about. 

      Determined, she winds up the old Victrola, lights some 
      candles.  Shakes back her hair and smiles seductively.  

                                    CORRINE (CONT D)
                    Just think-- we won t have to hide 
                    our love from the world anymore...

      She tries to kiss him but this only angers Christopher.  He 
      finally shoves her away. 

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Stop it!  Get away from me! 

      Corrine blinks-- a moment of realization.  And horror.  

                                    CORRINE
                    Don t you love me anymore? 

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    No.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:9696

      Upset, Corrine swings the candle around, LIGHTING up one of 
      the old, dry paper flowers.  It catches fire.  There s a 
      chain reaction as the flowers start to ignite, one by one.  

      Corrine watches, intrigued but not quite understanding, as 
      the flames take over the giant attic.  But Christopher 
      quickly pulls her down the stairs.



      Bart and Cathy embrace when they sense something-- a loud 
      CRACK or the smell of smoke.

                                  CATHY
                    What is that?

                                  BART
                    I ll check upstairs.

      But before he can go, Christopher runs down, dragging Corrine 
      with him.

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    The attic-- it s on fire.   You 
                    have to get out.  

      Cathy runs to the door with Bart, but he pulls away.  Starts 
      heading upstairs. 

                                  CATHY
                    Bart--?

                                  BART
                    Your grandmother s upstairs.  I 
                    have to get her! 

                                  CATHY
                    Bart, no--!  

      But he s too fast, quickly flies up to the second floor.  She 
      tries to run after him but Christopher stops her. 

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    He can t leave me.  Don t let him 
                    leave me!  

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    Cathy, don t!  It s too dangerous. 

      She pounds her fists into his chest, but Christopher s too 
      strong. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)      CONTINUED:9797

                                  CATHY
                    Please, no... I love him.  Let me 
                    go, Christopher!  You have to let 
                    me go!   

                                    CHRISTOPHER
                    No, Cathy.  It s too late.

      Against her will, Christopher drags Cathy outside. 



      A NURSE fetches a DOCTOR, who s looking over a case-file. 

                                  NURSE
                    Dr. Hatcher, come quick.

                    We ve tried everything but she 
                    won t calm down.

      The doctor grabs his medical bag and heads quickly over to... 



      The hysterical mental patient, being strapped down by two 
      ORDERLIES-- it s CORRINE.  She s yelling and screaming, 
      trying to claw her way out.

                    She keeps calling for her children.

      The doctor shakes his head as he INJECTS Corrine with a

                    That s strange.  She never had any
