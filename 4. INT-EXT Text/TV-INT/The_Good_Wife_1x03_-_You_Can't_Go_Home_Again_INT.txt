    The SOUNDS of MORNING CHAOS; shouting, showers and loud music 
      over:  FEMININE HANDS as they apply lotion, check a nail, 
      strap on a watch... pick up a wedding band.  A moment s 
      hesitation before it s slipped on.  ALICIA is late.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Let s go, guys -- fifteen minutes!

    She launches out into --


      Calling out as she goes.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Grace, you need to eat, and soccer 
                    tryouts are today.  

    She heads for the coffee pot, turns off the oatmeal, as GRACE 
      enters, dressed, but not a morning person, and not hungry.  

                                  GRACE
                    I hate this school, why would I 
                    want to play for it?

                                  ALICIA
                    And you re just now telling me?
                          (off her shrug)
                    Probably still packed -- at least 
                    tryto like it here.  

    The RINGING PHONE lets Grace off the hook.  Alicia grabs it, 
      exasperated and on the move again.  We FOLLOW HER into -- 


      Picking up after everyone as she goes.

                    Hi, Peter.

      INTERCUT WITH:


      PETER sits at a table, phone at his ear, brightening at her 
      voice.  Behind him a line of prisoners wait their turn.  

                                  PETER
                    This a good time?

                                  ALICIA
                    ... Sure.  You alright?

                                  PETER
                    Hanging in there. 
                          (awkward beat; then)
                    Kids around?  Can I talk to them?

                                  ALICIA
                    Actually, Zach s still in the shower 
                    and Grace just sat down to eat.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #102 "You Can't Go Home Again" YELLOW COLL. 8/24/09   3.

                    Oh.  Tried to call earlier but the 
                    line was long...

      Alicia s distracted, checks her watch while still rooting 
      around boxes.  Or maybe there s not much left to say.  

                                  ALICIA
                    So...

                                  PETER
                          (awkward beat; then)

                    each other s silences, didn t we?

    And they did.  Alicia tries to stay focused on the search. 

                                  ALICIA
                    I m sorry, we re just really 
                    running late.  Do you think you 
                    could try back later?

                                  PETER
                    Yeah.  Just tell them I called.

                                  ALICIA

                                  PETER
                    Bye.

    He hangs up.  Misses her.  END INTERCUT.  Then, eureka --

                    Found  em!  

    And she also finds a trophy... along with a photo of a 
      beaming Grace and a proud Peter, holding the same trophy in 
      front of their elegant Highland Park home.  

                                  GRACE (O.S.)
                    We should never have had to move.  

      Alicia turns to see Grace in the doorway, witness to her 
      mother s nostalgia.  The girl takes her cleats, pads off.  On 
      Alicia, left with the sentiment...  THE GOOD WIFE #102 "You Can't Go Home Again" YELLOW COLL. 8/24/09   4.




    Ten seconds into a new associates staff meeting.   WILL, 
      DIANE, CARY and 20 other fresh-scrubbed types as a harried 
      Alicia slips in, discreetly takes a seat at the table.  It s 
    not commented upon, but not unnoticed either.  

                                  WILL
                    A first year associate s primary 
                    job is to clock billable hours.  
                    And with those numbers down in each 
                    of your departments, clearly, some 
                    of you aren t doing yours.

                                  DIANE
                    Now, that s not to say you re all
                      under-performing -- one of our 
                    newest associates clocked 225 hours 
                    last month alone.  

      Everyone in the room knows she means Cary -- including Cary.

                                  WILL
                    But most of you can do better.  So 
                    while this meeting isn t about 
                    naming names, it is about asking 
                    you to step up.  

      Alicia squirms a bit, not in the high billable hours club.  

                                  DIANE
                    And if you can t do that, at least 
                    sign a few new clients.

      Obligatory chuckles.  But not from Alicia, who s not in the 
       signed clients  club either.

                                  SECRETARY 
                          (at door)
                    Pardon the interruption, but 
                    someone s here to see Mrs. 
                    Florrick.  I believe it s your son.

      Instant red flags for Alicia -- did something happen to Zach?  
      Diane subtly shoots Will a look as Alicia gathers her things.

                                  ALICIA
                    I m so sorry -- please excuse me.  

    We follow her out into --THE GOOD WIFE #102 "You Can't Go Home Again" YELLOW COLL. 8/24/09   5.




      Where she quickly maneuvers past co-workers with increasing 
      anxiety until she reaches --  


      Alicia scans for her son, but instead spots KENNY CHATHAM -- 
      who s a few years older than Zach, a lot rougher, and not at 
    all how Alicia remembered him.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Kenny?  Is that you?

                                  KENNY
                    Mrs. Florrick -- been awhile, huh?

    He gives her a familial hug.  She s startled by his presence 
      here, and perhaps more by his delinquent-like appearance.  

                                  ALICIA
                          (covering)
                    Wow, you ve... grown.
                          (looks around)
                    Are your parents with you?
                          (realizes they aren t)
                    What are you doing here?  

                                  KENNY
                    Um... I think I need a lawyer.  


      Alicia has pulled Kenny into a side room for privacy.  But 
      that doesn t exist when you re surrounded by glass.  

                                  KENNY
                    Last night, me and this guy Brian  
                    went to my buddy s house to get... 
                    we were lookin  to party, you know?

                                  ALICIA
                    To get what?

                                  KENNY
                    ... Some dank.  Weed or whatever.  

      Alicia s amazed and disappointed by the changes in this kid.

                                  KENNY
                          (shrugs; then)
                    Anyway, right after we got there, 
                    this security guard rolls up and...  

                                  ALICIA
                    And...?

      This is the hard part.  Out of shame, embarrassment, or both.  

                                  KENNY
                    I kinda freaked... so I ran.    
                          (then)
                    This morning, when I went by Bri s 
                    house, there were cops there.  
                    Heard he got arrested.  

      Kenny deposits a baggie of pot on her desk; she s mortified.  

                                  ALICIA
                    What are you doing?  What is this?

                                  KENNY
                    Figure they re after me next.  

      Alicia becomes aware of Diane and Will crossing past and 
      glancing in.  Great.  Quickly covers the baggie with papers. 

                                  ALICIA
                    Look... I m not sure I understand 
                    what happened but if you were 
                    buying pot --

                                  KENNY
                    We weren t.  Spencer was giving it 
                    to us.

                                  ALICIA
                          (dubious)
                    The bottom line is, if you and your 
                    friends broke the law, you need to 
                    go to the police.   

                                  KENNY
                    Yeah, but... I d still need a 
                    lawyer, right?

    She can t argue that.  Sees more rubberneckers looking in.

                                  ALICIA
                    Have you told your parents this?

                    You know how they are.  

    He wears their disapproval on his sleeve.  She feels for him.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Is there anything else to this 
                    story?  Anything at all?  

    He shakes his head.  Alicia makes a decision, though 
      reluctantly so.  Glimpses KALINDA in the bullpen.  

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Don t move.  
                          (re: pot)
                    And get rid of that.

                                  ALICIA
                    He s not mine.  Listen, can you do 
                    me a favor?  Find out about any 
                    police activity in Highland Park 
                    last night? See if Kenny Chatham is 
                    a person of interest or if there 
                    are any warrants out on him.

                                  KALINDA
                    For...?

                                  ALICIA
                    Pot.  Possession, possibly buying.

                    So if he s not a relative, who is he?

                                  ALICIA
                    I knew his mother.


      Alicia raps at the open door, finds Will inside.

                    So... did you not go to school 
                    today because of this?

                                  KENNY
                    Haven t been going.  Probably do a 
                    GED thing later.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Wait, you dropped out?  

                                  KENNY
                     Bout six months ago.  You guys had 
                    already moved by then.

      Wow, a lot has happened since she left.  Kenny sees her 
      processing this, reads it as judgmental.

                                  KENNY (CONT D)
                    I remember your being way cooler 
                    than this.

                                  ALICIA
                    Sorry to disappoint you.

                                  KENNY
                    And I don t get why you can t help me 
                    without getting them involved.

                                  ALICIA
                    Out of respect, Kenny.  You still 
                    live at home.  You and I both owe 
                    your parents that much.

                                  KENNY
                    Youdon t owe  em anything.  They 
                    blew you off.  That s who they are.

    She considers this, doesn t argue the point.  A beat as they 
      draw nearer...

                                  ALICIA
                    So... you ready to do this?

                                  KENNY
                    I was kinda hoping you d go in 
                    first.  

                                  ALICIA
                          (considers him; then)
                    Lucky I remember how cute a kid you 
                    were.


      Well-appointed.  Alicia faces a tense Lauren.

                                  ALICIA
                    My guess is you can probably clear 
                    all this up at the station.

                                  LAUREN
                          (by way of explanation)
                    They change, kids.  Get influenced 
                    by other people... 
                          (then)
                    Where is he now?

                                  ALICIA
                    In the car.  Asked me to smooth the 
                    waters.  

    The irony.  Lauren is embarrassed and paranoid.

                                  LAUREN
                    You didn t have to drive all the way 
                    out here.  You could ve just called. 

                                  ALICIA
                    I could have.  But a boy I saw grow up 
                    asked me for help.  And his mother used 
                    to be a friend.

    Of the fair-weather variety, it turns out.  They lock eyes 
    but are interrupted by a frantic PARTY-GOER --

                                  PARTY-GOER
                    You need to come outside.

      Lauren rushes out as Alicia s CELL RINGS.  She follows, still 
      stung as she answers her phone--

                                  ALICIA
                    Hello?


      Kalinda s on the other end --

                    Kenny.  But not for buying pot --

      Alicia doesn t hear the rest, because she s out into --


    On the move, as Kalinda debriefs Alicia.

                                  KALINDA
                    Police are alleging that Kenny 
                    Chatham and Brian Keller broke into a 
                    guest apartment on property owned by 
                    Carl and Wendy Rankin.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Wait a minute, they broke in?

                                  KALINDA
                    Nothing was reported stolen but --

                                  ALICIA
                    Kenny said they were at a friend s.

                                  KALINDA
                    The Rankin s 17 year old son, 
                    Spencer, lives above the garage, 
                    but wasn t home at the time.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Is that why the police think it was 
                      a burglary?

                                  KALINDA
                    That, and they have Kenny and 
                    Brian s fingerprints on a window 
                    that was jammed open.

      Great.  The debrief continues as we cut to:


      Alicia and Kalinda, climbing out of Alicia s car.  They head 
    for the station. 

                                  KALINDA
                    Theory is the boys encountered a 
                    security guard as they were 
                    leaving, struggled with him, then 
                    shoved him down the stairs.  M.E. 
                    says the guard died of blunt 
                    trauma, likely from hitting his 
                    head on concrete, at approximately 
                    11:20 p.m.

                    -- five minutes after the guard 
                    called in a perimeter check.  

                                  ALICIA
                    And because he died during the 
                    commission of an alleged burglary, 
                    Kenny s looking at felony murder.

                                  KALINDA
                    20 year minimum in prison.  Want me 
                    to go with?

                          (no)
                    It s not exactly my first time.

      Kalinda smiles wryly as Alicia heads into --


      Alicia steps in -- this isn t Tamms and the offenders aren t 
    in uniforms.  They re drunk, homeless or just plain criminal.  
      Kenny s among them, rushing forward with words spilling out.    

                                  KENNY
                    Are you getting me out? 

                                  ALICIA
                    Not yet.  I just came to make sure 
                    you were -- 

                                  KENNY
                    I didn t know anybody died, I don t 
                    know how anybody could have.  

                                  ALICIA
                    We probably shouldn t talk here --

                                  KENNY
                    Like I told you, I ran home.  I yelled 
                    up at Brian to get out, but he 
                    couldn t hear me, he was still inside.

                                  ALICIA

                    I never even saw the guard, just 
                    his car!  

      He s scared, pleading.  Alicia wants to believe him but --

                    Then why did you lie to me, Kenny?

                    Okay, look, there ll be a bail 
                    hearing, and a judge will decide if 
                    you can be released pending trial --

                    Talk to Spencer -- he knew we were 
                    coming.  He said to take what we 
                    needed, he even told us where the 
                    spare key was -- we just couldn t 
                    find it so we pushed a window open.  

    His eyes start to fill.  He wipes at them, shaking.

                    Mrs. Florrick, I swear... I ran 
                    home.  

      Alicia studies him, stripped of all his teen bravado, and 
      glimpses the boy she once knew.  


      Alicia makes her pitch to Will and Diane.  

                                  WILL
                    Not the strongest case. 

                                  DIANE
                    But she s signing a client.  And if 
                    his parents live in Highland Park, 
                    payment won t be an issue.

                                  WILL
                    I don t know.  When the connections 
                    are personal, it can get tricky.

                    parents anymore, which is why I d

                                  ALICIA
                    Because my relationship with them

                          (to Alicia)
                    So you sign your first client, but 
                    you want a secondassociate to be 
                    the face of the case.

                    I don t know.  But we ll work 
                    something out.  And while I m not 
                    as seasoned as Mr. Streiger, I 
                    guarantee you I care more about

    She steps away, past a powerless Lauren and into --


      Where Alicia is stunned to see Cary at the defense table, 
      chatting up sexy ASA DANIELLE RAINES.  Alicia beelines for 
      him.

                          (to Raines)
                    Excuse me.
                          (to Alicia)
                    Diane said you needed a first 
                    chair.

    But before she can say more, the door to a holding area is 
      opened, revealing Kenny.  The BAILIFF closes the door, ushers 
      Kenny to the defense table.  

      Seated in the gallery now are Richard, Lauren, and Terry.  
      Kenny meets their gaze, scared and ashamed.  Arrives.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Kenny, this is my associate, Cary 
                    Agos.  He s... one of the best 
                    attorneys at the firm.  He ll be 
                    helping me with your defense.

                                  CARY
                          (shakes his hand)
                    Good to meet you.  This should be 
                    pretty simple -- get you out on 
                    bail and get you home. 

      Kenny s grateful for the reassurance as JUDGE HOVICK enters.

                                  BAILIFF
                    Court is now in session.  The 
                    Honorable Earl Hovick presiding. 

                                  JUDGE HOVICK
                    Ms. Raines.

                                  RAINES
                    Your Honor, due to the seriousness 
                    of the charges, the state opposes 
                    bail at this time.  We believe the 
                    defendant not only poses a flight 
                    risk but a danger to the community--

      Alicia looks at Cary, who s waiting for the prosecution to 
      finish.  Alicia knows you ve got to be aggressive, stands.

                                  ALICIA
                    Excuse me, Your Honor, but based on

                    Mr. Chatham has no criminal history 
                    and strong ties to the community.  
                    In fact, his parents are seated 
                    here in the gallery...
                          (points them out)
                    ... to assure the court their son 
                    will appear for trial.

    In the b.g., another ASA has entered the courtroom, hustles 
      over to Raines, hands her a note.  

                                  RAINES
                    Begging your pardon, Your Honor, 
                    but the State has just secured a 
                      cooperating witness who s placed 
                    Mr. Chatham at the crime scene and 
                    identified him as the attacker.

                                  JUDGE HOVICK
                          (without a second thought)
                    Then bail s denied.  Defendant is 
                    remanded to custody.  Next case.

      Everyone s stunned.  Alicia, Kenny, his parents.  

                                  KENNY
                    You said it was gonna be simple.

                                  ALICIA
                    Your friend Brian must have cut a 
                    deal with the State s Attorney.  

      Kenny is led away by the Bailiff.  Cary looks at Alicia --

                    Not really.  Been hearing about it

                    I m sure, and it has to be pretty 
                    upsetting to you guys, too.

      Both shrug -- no.  Alicia s confused by the lack of impact.

    The kids swap looks, yes it is.  But why push it?

      Alicia hustles in, nods hello to a vacuuming janitor.  Passes 
      Cary s office and, of course, he s already there, offering a 
      wave.  Alicia heads into her office, settling in when --

                          (re: Cary)
                    But I m not the first. 

                                  WILL
                    That s what happens when you re 
                    single and childless.
                          (then)
                    I was going to leave you a note.  
                    Wanted to see how things were going 
                    with him as first chair. 

                                  ALICIA
                    Well, he s certainly confident.

                                  WILL
                    Look, it s yourcase.  Diane 
                    assumed, rightly so, that you were 
                    just looking for a front man to 
                    provide a little cushion since 
                    you re dealing with friends.

                    We couldn t get bail because Brian 
                    cut a deal with the S.A.  He got 
                    immunity on felony murder by taking 
                    the lesser charge of burglary and 
                    agreeing to testify against Kenny.   

                                  WILL 
                    So then what you have to do is --

      Alicia looks at a smiling Cary, who s clearly insinuated 
      himself into this conversation for Will s benefit.


      Alicia herds the kids out toward the front door.

                                  ALICIA

                    his position...  

      Laughter.  Alicia glances at Lauren and Richard. Together, 
    but apart -- their body language telling the story. 

      A sob snaps Alicia out of her memory.  It s Lauren.

                                  JUDGE JAMES
                    Which is another way of saying both 
                    sides should come to an agreement 
                    before we go any farther.

                        KENNYJUDGE JAMES

                    whether or not there s enough 
                    probable cause to hold this defendant

                                  JUDGE JAMES (CONT D)
                    It's not a fishing expedition, Counsel.  
                    And I won't allow you to use this 
                      opportunity as means for discovery.     
                          (then)
                    Ms. Raines, you re up.THE GOOD WIFE #102 "You Can't Go Home Again" YELLOW COLL. 8/24/09   39.




      Officer Diaz (seen in teaser), is on the stand; Diaz is 
      tough, buff and dead serious.  A confident Raines grills him.

                                  DIAZ
                    At 11:24 p.m., he was pulled over 
                    for speeding, approximately four 
                    blocks from the Rankin house.

                                  RAINES
                    And Officer Diaz, did Brian give 
                    any statement at that time?

                                  DIAZ
                    Yes, he did.  He immediately 
                    confessed to having fled the scene 
                    of a burglary on Belson Street.

                                  RAINES
                    So, in effect, he placed himself at 
                    the crime scene.  

                                  DIAZ
                    Yes, and was arrested at that time.

                                  JUDGE JAMES
                    In your experience, do spontaneous 
                      confessions such as this tend to be 
                    accurate?

      Cary considers objecting, but how do you object to the judge?

                                  DIAZ
                    Typically, the perpetrator won t 
                    have had enough time to concoct a 
                    story, so yes.  They usually are.  

                                  RAINES
                    Nothing further.

                                  JUDGE JAMES
                    Mr. Uh-goes...

                     A-goes,  Your Honor.

                                  JUDGE JAMES
                    Whatever.

      Cary rises, approaches Diaz, who looks much bigger up close.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #102 "You Can't Go Home Again" YELLOW COLL. 8/24/09   40.

                    Officer Diaz.
                          (his mind goes blank)
                    Sorry, I need to refer to my 
                    notes...

      James raises an eyebrow at this.  Cary returns to the table, 
      finds what he s looking for as a concerned Alicia quickly 
      slides him a note: no mention of killing when arrested.  

                                  CARY (CONT D)
                          (sotto to Alicia)
                    I know.

    He pointedly shows her his own note to that effect.  

                                  JUDGE JAMES
                    Sometime before I go gray, Counsel.

                                  CARY
                            (re-approaches)
                    Officer Diaz, when Mr. Keller had 
                    this  spontaneous utterance , did he 
                    mention that anyone had been killed?

                                  DIAZ
                    Not until after we got to the 
                    station, no.

                                  CARY
                    So when Brian told you Kenny 
                    Chatham was responsible for the 
                    victim s death, he hadhad time to 
                    concoct a story.

                                  RAINES
                    Objection.

                                  JUDGE JAMES
                    Sustained.  If for no other reason 
                    than the use of pluperfect tense.

                    Nothing further.

      Cary sits down.  Alicia leans over, whispers --  

                                  ALICIA
                    It gets easier as you go.

                                  CARY
                          (ignores the implication)
                    My interests have never been in 
                      litigation.

                                  RAINES
                      Prosecution calls Brian Keller.

      BRIAN KELLER (a bigger, badder version of Kenny) is in a suit 
    and tie, rises from the gallery, approaches the stand.  


    ASA Raines with Brian, who is now the picture of innocence.  
    On a nearby table, an architectural model of the crime scene.  

                                  BRIAN
                    Kenny wanted to get high and said 
                    he knew where he could get some 
                    weed.  He never said anything about 
                    breaking in, so I was surprised 
                    when he asked me to help jam the 
                    window open.  I mean, I did it 
                    but... I was kinda freaked out 
                    after.  So I went downstairs.

                                  RAINES
                    And did what?

                                  BRIAN
                    Waited for him so we could get the 
                    heck out of there.  But then I saw 
                    the security guard.

                                  RAINES
                    Did he see you?

                                  BRIAN
                    No, I hid behind a tree. 
                          (pointing to model)
                    Right in there.

                                  RAINES
                    I know it s difficult, but could 
                    you tell the judge what you saw?

      Brian glances at Kenny, who then turns to Alicia --

                                  KENNY
                          (sotto to Alicia)
                    I can t believe he can lie like this.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #102 "You Can't Go Home Again" YELLOW COLL. 8/24/09   42.

                                  ALICIA
                          (sotto to Kenny)
                    People do it all the time.

                                  BRIAN
                    Um... the guard started going up 
                    the stairs.

                                  RAINES
                          (pointing to model)
                    Here?

                                  BRIAN
                    Yeah and I guess he kinda surprised 
                    Kenny because they got into it and 
                    then... Kenny sorta shoved him and 
                    the guard fell backwards.  And 
                    then... he just stopped moving.

      Alicia studies the model.  All lawn, only the one bush.  Cary 
      follows Alicia s gaze, curious.  What s she seeing?

                                  CARY
                          (sotto)
                    What s the matter?

                                  ALICIA
                          (sotto)
                    Nothing, just manicured lawns...

                                  RAINES
                    So from where you were standing, 
                    there was a clear view of the crime.

                                  BRIAN
                    Yes.

      It s damning testimony and Raines knows it, nods to the Judge 
    -- finished with Brian.  Cary rises to cross but --

                                  JUDGE JAMES
                    That s plenty for today.  Court s 
                    adjourned til 9 tomorrow.  

      Kenny looks between Cary and Alicia, not sure how to feel.  
      Alicia turns back to the gallery.  Still no parents.

    The kids brighten at the prospect.


      Cary s burning the midnight oil, law books and files spread 
    out before him.  After a beat, Will steps past, peeks in.

                                  WILL

    But something about the way Cary has brought this up doesn t 
      quite sit well with Will.

                    Yeah, know what s great about someone 
                    like Alicia?  She s a natural, 
                    doesn t have to try so hard.  

      With that, Will goes.  Off Cary, not as smart as he thought 
    he was...

                    and someone who ll testify hepushed 
                    the guard.  

      Richard considers this a beat, then --

                    You think he s guilty?

                    No.  Do you?

    All this weighs heavily on Richard.

                    remember, don t you?  We always had 
                    the perfect family.    

    Off Alicia, all too familiar with the feeling.


      A sopping wet Alicia drops back into the driver s seat.

      Alicia enters the courtroom, hands documentation to the court

      FADE IN:


    The room has been cleared.  Only Raines, Alicia and Cary 
      remain, still seated at their respective tables.  Judge James 
      stands before them, hands resting on the prosecution s table. 

                                  JUDGE JAMES
                    That you would pursue a charge of 
                    this magnitude without a thorough 
                      investigation is unconscionable.

                    evidence linking the defendant to 
                    the murder, no eyewitness testimony 
                    other than that of a co-defendant 
                    with a vested interest in the

                    counsel to find a more equitable

    But Alicia s not so sure she believes this.  She studies the

    has done nothing to bring them closer.  Awkward beat.

                    Thanks, but tonight?  Think I just 
                    wanna go home.

    And she does.


      Alicia sits in the chair, buried in briefs.  TV on in the 
      b.g.  She takes a sip of tea, glances over at the king size 
      sleigh bed.  Her eye catching sight of something -- a mark on 
    the headboard.  She gets up, goes over to it, touches the 
      scratch with her finger, remembering how it got there... 

      PRE-LAP the sounds of love-making as we --

      Alicia s hand slaps back against the headboard, diamond 
      engagement ring scratching into the wood as she climaxes.  
      REVEAL that she s with Peter, both breathless, sated.  Alicia 
      notes the scratch she s just made.

                                  ALICIA
                    Oops.  

      Peter follows her gaze, sees the damage. 

                                  PETER
                    That your idea of a notch?

                                  ALICIA
                          (grins; then)
                    You think they heard us?

                                  PETER
                    The kids?  Maybe you.  

    He kisses her.  

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    Not bad for an old married couple, 
                    huh?  
                          (then)
                    I love you.

      Alicia looks at him, holds his gaze.

                                  ALICIA
                    I love you, too.

    And she does.  Caresses his cheek. But his cell phone rings.  

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Don t.

    But it s so hard not to... 

                                  PETER
                    It could be work.

    He reaches for it, to her sadness.  Answers --

                    Peter Florrick.

    His face has just the slightest of shifts.  He cups the 
      phone, says to Alicia --

                    Office emergency.  Just be a 
                    minute.

    He gets out of bed, heads for the bathroom.  Turns on the 
      light, closes the door on her.  Alicia listens to his muted 
      voice as he talks to someone... 

      She s jolted from her memory by the NEWS ANCHOR on TV --

      Alicia pulls her hand away from the headboard, sees it all 
      much more clearly now: Highland Park, Peter... herself.


       War room  might be a better description.  Diane sits at the 
    far end of a long table.  Piled on the table, the whole of 
    the Sheffrin-Marks case: briefs, boxes, files -- stacks and 
      stacks of them.  Cary stops by, heading out for the night.

    She looks up, surprised to see him there.

      Grace sits at her window, looking out as Alicia enters.

                    Hey.  It s after ten.  What are you 
                    doing up so late on a school night?  

                                  GRACE
                    Just looking out at the view.  

                                  ALICIA
                    It s nice, isn t it.

      A beat as they stare out.  Sit close.  Grace looks at her 
      mom.  Maybe she s been too hard on her.  Offers --

                    It s a cool room.  Smaller than my

      Alicia smiles, kisses Grace s head.

                    Know what I was thinking earlier?  
                    You hated your old school when you 
                    first started going there.

                    Yeah.  I kinda did.

      They look out the window together.  Not unhappy.  Grace 
      considers the view, makes a decision to reveal --

                    Today... I m sorta glad we moved.

      This is a surprise for Alicia.  But one that makes her feel 
      better about everything.
