      CAMPERS in bathing suits, lined up: boys in one line, girls 
    in another. Kids self consciously adjust themselves-- 
      covertly tug at their waist bands, hold in their stomachs-- 
    in general try to pretend they re not dying of embarrassment. 

    One by one, A MALE AND A FEMALE COUNSELOR stands each camper 
    in front of a backdrop, snaps their photos, mug-shot style. 

    ON: WILL. The only camper not in a bathing suit. She wears 
    her usual uniform: baggy boys  shorts, and a punked-outtee. 
    She regards the scene around her with disbelief.

                                  WILL
                    Can we like take a moment and just 
                    ponder how sick this is? Just get a 
                    bunch of fat kids, stick  em in 
                    bathing suits, and-- add cameras! 
                    Wasn t this like outlawedby the 
                    Geneva Convention?

    The girl next to her in line, BECCA, painfully shy, looks up 
      from reading ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE...                                                                                    3.



                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    But I get it, I do-- cause maybe we 
                    don t feel badenough about 
                    ourselves. What if we ve thus far 
                    retained some shred of dignity?
                            (beforeBecca can speak)
                    I said  thus far.  That s how upset 
                    I am. 

                                  BECCA
                    They just-- can I say something?
                          (offWill s look)
                    They do this so you can compare the 
                    pictures at the end and see how 
                    much weight you lost.

                                  WILL
                    Whatever. They can t make me lose 
                    weight. 

      FIND: ON THE OTHER SIDE OF BECCA-- CAITLIN AND CHLOE. Two of 
    the thinnest girls at camp. Both look up, overhearing this. 

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    I won t do it. In fact--
                          (mocks Rand s delivery)
                    --that is my promise! To you.

      Caitlin leans over to Will.

                                  CAITLIN
                    Um, they don t let you do the 
                    picture with clothes on.

                                  WILL
                    Oh my God, I would never have 
                    guessed that, thank you. 

      Caitlin turns back to Chloe--  do you believe her? 

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                          (for Caitlin to hear)
                    In fact, this could be my summer to 
                    gain weight! I feel like-- inside 
                    me? There s an even fatter person 
                    trying to get out. 

      Becca pushes herself to say... something.

                                  BECCA
                    It s not that bad here once you get 
                    used to it. This is my second time. 
                    I lost twenty six and a half 
                    pounds. Then I gained some of it 
                    back. Basically all of it.                                                                                     4.



    For some reason, Becca now can t stop talking.

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    But you meet people. People hook up 
                    a lot. Not everyone,but-- it s 
                    kind of like BizarroWorld. Cause 
                    everyone s overweight. So the 
                    playing field is more-- like, there 
                    is one.  

                                  WILL
                          (has to admit)
                    That s somewhat cool.

      WILL S POV:  THE BOYS LINE. Specifically, TRENT (a chunky yet 
      hunkyjock type) who stands with his TWO HEAVY SET JOCK PALS. 

      TRENT seems to look back at her with interest. Then she 
      realizes he s looking past her. She follows his gaze to 

      AMBER. The thinnest girl present. Will turns back to Becca, 
    who has witnessed this.

                                  BECCA
                    Okay, it s not that different from 
                    the real world. 

      Will s still staring at Amber--

                                  WILL
                    What is she even doing here?

    ON: AMBER, watching Caitlin and Chloe gab. Focused on the 
      DIAMOND BRACELET sparkling on Caitlin s wrist. Then she looks 
        self-consciously at her frayed friendship bracelet. She slips 
    it off, lets it fall. She glances around, suddenly sees

      TRENT, checking her out. Amber immediately sucks in her 
      stomach, both uncomfortable and pleased with this attention. 

      CAITLIN AND CHLOE approach her. 

                                  CAITLIN
                    Hi, we hate you. Just kidding. 

                                  AMBER
                    Oh. Okay.

                                  CAITLIN
                    Cute suit. 

                                  CHLOE
                    I tried that one but it gave me 
                    back rolls.                                                                                    5.



                                  AMBER
                    Oh, I totally feel you.

    She twists around to show them her back.

    IN THE BOYS LINE, ALISTAIR (sweet, odd, very heavy, wearing 
      sandals and socks) studies various people s feet. Flustered, 
    he spots  

      CHLOE, across from him in the girls line. He tries subtly to 
    get her attention--

                                  ALISTAIR
                    Hey-- umm--

      Chloe pretends not to notice him, focuses on Amber...

                                  CHLOE
                    Are you kidding? You are so thin. 

                                  CAITLIN
                    Yeah, look around! You re totally 
                    the thinnest girl here!

                                  AMBER
                    That can t be true.

    But she s realizing: It could be true. 

                                  ALISTAIR
                          (sotto voce, to Chloe)
                    Are we supposed to take our shoes 
                    off? 

      Chloe glances at him; blatantly ignores him.  

                                  AMBER
                    I mean, look at me.

                                  CHLOE
                    Look at me!

                                  CAITLIN
                    Okay, by the end of the summer, 
                    we re all gonnabe so hot it hurts.

      Caitlin notices Amber s ex-bracelet. Picks it up.

                                  CAITLIN (CONT D)
                    Is this yours?

                                  AMBER
                    No.

      Caitlin slides it on next to her diamond bracelet.                                                                                    6.



                                  CHLOE
                    Ew, it s dirty.

                                  CAITLIN
                    It s good luck. 

      Amber and Caitlin share a smile. A friendship is born. 

                                  CAITLIN (CONT D)
                    I m Caitlin, she s Chloe.

                                  AMBER
                    Amber.

      Chloe, not listening, is staring at the boys  line.

                                  CHLOE
                    Check out the blue shorts.

    She points subtly. Amber and Chloe look; burst into GIGGLES--

                                  AMBER
                    Oh no!

    ON: IAN. In blue shorts. He notices the group of girls 
      looking at him, giggling. Are they interested in him? 
      Flustered, he pretends to clean his glasses. 

      BACK ON AMBER AND COMPANY:

                                  AMBER (CONT D)
                    I would die. Someone should tell 
                    him.
                          (theylook at her)
                    No. No! 

      They all GIGGLE more.

    ON IAN: Aware of Amber approaching. He struggles for cool.

                                  AMBER (CONT D)
                    Um, hi...

                                  IAN
                    Hey.

                                  AMBER
                    I just thought you should know you 
                    have a hole in your bathing suit.

    Ian turns red, looks down for the hole--

                                  IAN
                    Oh, crap.Uh--                                                                                    7.



                                  AMBER
                    In back.

    Ian covers his ass with his hands. AWKWARD.

                                  IAN
                    Thanks. 

                                  AMBER
                    You re welcome.

      Amber walks back to her amused new friends. As Ian watches 
    her go, wanting to die...

    DR. RAND appears, moves through the crowd, greets campers...

                                  DR. RAND
                    Hey there-- good to see you. Hello--

      Rand comes to a stop in front of Becca and Will.

                                  DR. RAND (CONT D)
                    Becca, good to see you again! 

                                  BECCA
                          (blurts out)
                    I gained back the weight.

                                  DR. RAND
                    Well, I m proud of you for coming 
                    back. And welcome--
                          (reads Will s name tag)
                      Willamina.I m Dr. Rand.

                                  WILL
                    I prefer Will. 

                                  DR. RAND
                    Noted. I just wanted to say 
                    welcome, and remind you that all 
                    campers need to be in their bathing 
                    suits for the Before Picture. No 
                    street clothes. No exceptions.

                                  WILL
                    Why?

                                  DR. RAND
                    Because, Will, this is the 
                    beginning of an important journey.  

    The campers nearest Will are following this with interest.                                                                                    8.



                                  DR. RAND (CONT D)
                    And we ask you to begin this 
                    journey by taking an honest look at 
                    yourself. 

                                  WILL
                    That sounds so great, but-- I lost 
                    my bathing suit.

                                  DR. RAND
                    I see. No problem. You can use the 
                    community suit. 

    At the words  community suit  the campers within earshot 
      react with dread. Becca signals a vigorous  no  to Will. 

                                  DR. RAND (CONT D)
                    Just be sure to leave your 
                    underwear on. 

      Cornered, Will pulls at the neckline of her t-shirt--

                                  WILL
                    Oh! You know what? I found my suit! 
                    This is weird. It was on my body! 

                                  DR. RAND
                    Good. 

      Rand remains there, waits for Will to disrobe. 

                                  DR. RAND (CONT D)
                    Well--?

      Everyone s now staring at Will. The pressure s on, and Will, 
      desperate to hide her discomfort, shrugs her t-shirtoff one 
      shoulder in a parody of sexiness. There are A FEW GIGGLES. 
      Encouraged, she starts to hum  Big Spender  as she swings her 
      hips, performing a cheesy striptease. Now people are riveted. 
      HOOTS AND WOLF WHISTLES. Becca is entranced-- by Will s 
      boldness. Amber, Caitlin and Chloe are also riveted.

                                  CAITLIN
                          (sotto to the other two)
                    Okay, nobody wants to see that.

                                  CHLOE
                    Seriously.

                                  AMBER
                    We re lucky. It could be so much 
                    worse. 

      AMBER watches Will with a mixture of disgust and fascination.                                                                                    9.



    ON WILL: Deep into it now. Kids start to CLAP ALONG as she 
      whirls her shirt over her head and tosses it to the crowd, 
      then drops her shorts and slaps her own butt. People CHEER 
      WILDLY. Rand watches, impenetrable. Will stops dancing, looks 
    at Rand: a challenge. Rand stares back for a suspenseful 
      beat. Then, as if nothing happened--

                                  DR. RAND
                    Chloe-- good to see you again!

      Rand moves on. Some KIDS CLAP. Will bows, goes back to Becca--

                                  WILL
                          (sotto voce)
                    Oh my God, why did I just do that?!  

      Will LAUGHS at herself. Becca s blown away. 

    IN A SERIES OF QUICK POPS, the  before  pictures are snapped: 
      Alistair gives two thumbs up; Becca blinks; Ian is caught in 
    mid glasses-push; Will points a finger-gun at her head; Amber 
      strikes a would-be sexy model pose, then, after the flash:

                                  AMBER
                    Wait-- can we do one more?



      Campers line up, in sweat clothes as Dr. Rand addresses them:

                                  DR. RAND
                    You ll be getting at least three 
                    hours of exercise every day, 
                    whether it s through team sports, 
                    games, or working out at the gym.

    ON WILL AND BECCA: Whispering to each other.

                                  WILL
                    So what s Dr. Rand allegedly a  
                    doctor of?

                                  BECCA
                    I guess-- nutrition?

    ON DR. RAND:

                                  DR. RAND
                    Now let s meet your fitness 
                    coaches.

      SHAY, a late 20sJillian Michaels type, steps forward--                                                                                    14.



                                  SHAY
                    Hi, I m Shay, your worst nightmare.  
                    I ll be whipping you into shape 
                    this summer! 
                          (thereturning kids CHEER)
                    You will beg for my mercy!!

    The kids CHEER louder. ON WILL: totally freaked out by this.

      FIND: AMBER, CAITLIN, AND CHLOE-- Amber chews a toothpick. 
      Caitlin holds her hand out. Amber automatically puts another 
      toothpick into Caitlinshand, as--

                                  CHLOE
                    She livesto make people cry; I 
                    loveher. 

      Suddenly Amber s mouth drops open, her TOOTHPICK FALLS OUT-- 
    WE FOLLOW HER STUNNED GAZE TO:

      GEORGE, 20. An adonis. Dr. Rand moves over to him--

                                  DR. RAND
                    And I m pleased to introduce our 
                    new assistant fitness coach-- 

                                  GEORGE
                    Hey, I m George. 

    ON AMBER: Struck dumb. Totally smitten.

      George THROUGH AMBER S POV: Close on his sweaty BICEPS and 
      full LIPS, his HAND, pushing back his hair. 

      Amber exchanges a  OMFG  look with Caitlin and Chloe. 



      George leads the campers in a run. The kids PANT, MOAN...

                                  GEORGE
                    Just a few more laps, guys! You can 
                    do it!

    A determined Amber pushes through the crowd until she gets to 
    the front next to George. As she runs she tries to wipe her 
      sweat and fix her hair a little--

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    Hey, check you out! What s your 
                    name?

                                  AMBER 
                          (winded, can barely speak)
                    Amber.                                                                                    15.



                                  GEORGE
                    Keep it up, Tara! You re doing 
                    great!

      Amber tries to be thrilled. 

      FIND WILL, struggling. She sees BECCA, NEARBY, IN TEARS--

                                  BECCA
                    I can t do any more!

      Shay bears down on Becca, roars like a jungle beast--

                                  SHAY
                    THERE. IS. NO.  I CAN T  Do you 
                    hear me?! 
                          (Becca can t talk)
                    DO YOU HEAR ME?!!?

      Will, seeing Shay busy with Becca, takes this moment to bolt--

                                  BECCA
                          (upset, to Shay)
                    Yes! 

                                  SHAY
                    Don t let me EVER hear you say that 
                    again! UNDERSTAND?! 

                                  BECCA
                    Yes!

                                  SHAY
                    Now GIVE ME TWENTY JUMPING JACKS!

      Becca starts jumping. We move past this spectacle to 

    THE BACK OF THE LINE, WHERE THE STRAGGLERS, including Ian and 
      Alistair, stumble forward, drenched in sweat. 

                                  IAN
                    Oh God, my lungs are trying to 
                    escape my body--

      Alistair struggles to keep his game face on:

                                  IAN (CONT D)
                      I should ve just gotten that lap 
                    band thing.

                                  ALISTAIR
                          (breathing raggedly)
                    I know a guy who got that. His Dad 
                    had to get a second mortgage, to 
                    pay for it. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    16.

                                  ALISTAIR (CONT'D)
                    His stomach was the size of a 
                    walnut but he kept eating and he 
                    stretched it back out. And put back 
                    all the weight. And they lost their 
                    house. 

                                  IAN
                    Great story. Tell it again.


      Alistair suddenly stops, doubles over. Ian stops short. 

                                  IAN (CONT D)
                    You okay man?

      Alistair plops down on the ground, pulls out an inhaler and 
      starts breathing into it. Ian stands there, concerned.

    UP AHEAD the group disappears around a bend. 

                                  IAN (CONT D)
                    Don t die, okay? They ll think I 
                    did it. 

      Alistair s BREATHING normalizes, he removes his inhaler--

                                  ALISTAIR
                          (weak)
                    I smell-- chocolate--

                                  IAN
                    Isn t that the first sign of a 
                    stroke? 

      WILL POPS out of a nearby bush. She s eating a candy bar. 

                                  IAN (CONT D)
                    Uh-- Hi. 

    The boys stare dumbstruck at Will s candy bar. Until--

                                  WILL
                    Um.I have another one. 

                                  IAN
                    Is this a trick? Are you like a 
                    plant that the camp set up to see 
                    how we react?

                                  WILL
                    Yes. I m actually a robot, built by 
                    Dr. Rand. 
                            (they restaring at her 
                            chocolate)
                    Sorry-- nevermind.                                                                                    17.



                                  IAN
                    No, wait-- 
                          (to Alistair)
                    You wanna split it?

      Alistair hesitates, then shakes his head no. Ian looks back 
    to Will. She produces a second bar. He takes it, digs in.

                                  IAN (CONT D)
                    My last chocolate for eight weeks.
                          (then)
                    What s your name, mysterious 
                    stranger?

                                  WILL
                    Will.

                                  IAN
                    I m Ian.

                                  ALISTAIR
                    Alistair.

      Alistair wipes off his sweaty hand, holds it out to shake.

                                  WILL
                    Cool name.

                                  ALISTAIR
                    Thanks, I hate it.

                                  IAN
                    So are you trying to get kicked out 
                    of camp, or what?

                                  WILL
                    My parents said if I get in trouble 
                    here they d send me to one of those 
                    boot camps you see on Jerry 
                    Springer. Trust me, I do not intend 
                    to get kicked out. Nor do I intend 
                    to lose weight. I said nor, 
                      something s wrong with me.  

      Alistair suddenly sees something terrifying in the distance:

                                  ALISTAIR
                    She s coming back!!

      REVEAL: Shay. Coming towards them. All three of them leap up 
    in fear, start desperately jogging again AS WE HEAR:

                                  SHAY (O.S.)
                    Slackers will suffer! That means 
                    YOU!                                                                                    18.





    The campers play volleyball on the sand. George has his arm 
      around Amber showing her how to serve. He s professional, but 
      she s into it on a whole other level. 

    ON WILL, away from the game, building a sand castle.



      Another candy transaction, with THREE CAMPERS this time (one 
    of them is Caitlin.) Will flips through a huge wad of cash, 
      looking like a total drug dealer with sunglasses and a 
      lollipop sticking out of her mouth like a cigarette.


      A co-edgroup of campers sit in a circle, sharing feelings. 
    Ian is mid-share. 

                                  IAN
                    You know that Doors song  People 
                    Are Strange?  I feel like that all 
                    the time. Like I m looking at the 
                    world through this like-- haze. Of-- 
                    ugliness. I mean, for a long time I 
                    didn t see myself clearly. I knew I 
                    was big, but--

      Will stares at the ground with intensity, riveted to Ian s 
      every word but so uncomfortable that she can t look at him. 
      Alistair nods, empathic.                                                                                    22.



                                  IAN (CONT D)
                    There was this kid-- Kyle 
                    Biederman.He was like-- the fat 
                    guy. In our school. And I like 
                    clung to that. I would always look 
                    at him, and think-- at least I m 
                    not him. And then one day, after 
                    P.E., we were at the sinks at the 
                    same time. 

      TRENT and his buddy are focussed, grinning, on something in 
    the grass-- they LAUGH and nudge each other.  

    IAN swallows, nervous, glances over to 

      AMBER, who is distracted by Trent. 

                                  IAN (CONT D)
                    I could see us both in the mirror. 
                    And I was as fat as him. Maybe 
                    fatter. It kind of shocked me.  

      TRENT LAUGHS OUT LOUD. Ian stops himself from saying more.  

                                  DR. RAND
                    Trent, is there a problem?

                                  TRENT
                    Sorry. We found a caterpillar!

      Amber, Caitlin, Chloe and a few others GIGGLE. Rand glares.

                                  TRENT (CONT D)
                          (abashed)
                    Sorry.

                                  DR. RAND
                    Thank you for sharing, Ian.

      Rand looks over at Will. 

                                  DR. RAND (CONT D)
                    Who s next. Will? 

                                  WILL
                    Pass. 

                                  DR. RAND
                    You don t have to say much, just 
                    tell us a little about what brought 
                    you to camp.

                                  WILL
                    My parents.                                                                                      23.



                                  DR. RAND
                    And how do you feel about that?

                                  WILL
                    Whatever. I m used to them being 
                    jerks. 
                          (beat)
                    Look, I m down with my fat. Me and 
                    my fat are like-- BFF. 

      Amber s look says  Bullshit. 

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    Who says fat has to be this 
                    horrible thing? A few hundred years 
                    ago, this was the hottest look on 
                    the block. In some parts of the 
                    world, it still is. It s our 
                    culture that s screwed up, not us.  

      Amber whispers something to Caitlin that we don t hear. 

                                  DR. RAND
                    I agree, it s hurtful to put 
                    pressure on people, to conform to a 
                    certain look. But there s also the 
                    question of health.

                                  WILL
                    Oh right, health. You want to tell 
                    me she s here for her health?
                          (pointsat Amber)

                                  AMBER
                    Don t say what I m here for, you 
                    don t know me! 

                                  DR. RAND
                    Girls! Okay. There s obviously a 
                    lot of emotion here. Which is why--

      Rand passes around small notebooks, they each take one, as...

                                  DR. RAND (CONT D)
                    --I want you all to start keeping a 
                    journal. Every day. It s important 
                    to get your thoughts and feelings 
                    out. So you can face them. 

                                  WILL
                    Will you be checking these?

                                  DR. RAND
                    No. They re just for you.                                                                                    24.



                                  WILL
                    So really, we could not write in 
                    them and you wouldn t know.

                                  DR. RAND
                    The choice is yours.
                          (beat)
                    Like all the choices you make.

      Will frowns. Rand looks around, addresses the group.

                                  DR. RAND (CONT D)
                    So-- nobody s mentioned what it s 
                    like to go without your favorite 
                    foods. How s it feel?  

      Silence. Then... Caitlin raises her hand.

                                  CAITLIN
                    It feels really good. 



      Sharing s over, kids disperse in twos and threes-- Chloe 
      chats up Trent and his friends, then looks up to see: 

      CAITLIN AND AMBER head off together. Chloe turns back to the 
      boys, struggling to shake off the rejection. 


      Amber and Caitlin walk back to the cabin... 

                                  AMBER
                    How can they expect us to get that 
                    personal, in front of everyone? I m 
                    just gonnamake stuff up.  

                                  CAITLIN
                    No, you should be honest. People 
                    are really supportive here. I mean, 
                    this is like-- the only place where 
                    I feel like people actually care. 
                    At home my mom just rides me about  
                    how fat I m getting.  

      Amber looks at her-- empathic. Caitlin lightens the moment. 

                                  CAITLIN (CONT D)
                    So next time we share, you have to 
                    say how you re in love with George. 

                                  AMBER
                    Oh, like you re not!                                                                                    25.



                                  CAITLIN
                    Hey, if you like  em older, you can 
                    have Salty! 

      Amber swats Caitlin, who LAUGHS, runs away, Amber follows.



      Will wanders out onto the dock, studying her cell phone, 
      trying in vain to find reception... 

                                  WILL
                          (under her breath)
                    Come on... gimmeone bar!

      Frustrated, she snaps it shut, shoves it in her pocket. All 
    at once, she realizes she s hearing FAINT MUSIC-- A simple 
      acoustic melody. She looks around, confused, then kneels 
      down, leans over the edge of the dock-- 

      REVERSE: WILL S UPSIDE DOWN FACE peeks under the dock--

    HER POV: IAN, strumming his guitar, in his own world. 

      Will watches him: Curious, awed, scared to interrupt. He 
      looks up-- stops playing. 

                                  IAN
                    Hey.

                                  WILL
                    Sorry. I didn t mean to--

                                  IAN
                    No worries.  

    She jumps down off the dock, approaches him--

                                  WILL
                    How long you been playing?

                                  IAN
                    Just like twenty minutes.

                                  WILL
                    I mean how long--

                                  IAN
                    I know. Three years.

                                  WILL
                    You re good.                                                                                    26.



                                  IAN
                    No I m not. This isn t even my good 
                    guitar.

                                  WILL
                    It looks like the one Frank Black 
                    plays.

    Ian lights up.

                                  IAN
                    I can t believe-- I m so happy you 
                    know that.

                                  WILL
                    I m obsessed. I saw them play in 
                    London last year--

                                  IAN
                    What?!! What?! Ohh, I hate you!! I 
                    don t hate you. That must have been-

                                  WILL
                    It was, Frank s sweat was literally 
                    dripping on me.

                                  IAN
                    Wow.

                                  WILL
                    I know. Stiff Little Fingers 
                    opened. I really like them too.

                                  IAN
                    I only know that one song--
                          (SINGS)
                       Something, something-- barbed wire 
                    love-- 

                                  WILL
                          (SINGS)
                     All you give me is barbed wire 
                    love-- 

                                  IAN
                    For so long I thought they were 
                    saying  barber love.  Like the love 
                    you have for your barber. 

      They LAUGH a little. Beat. He looks at her.

                                  IAN (CONT D)
                    You ve been to London?                                                                                    27.





      Will and Ian walk back to the cabins, deep in conversation--

                                  IAN
                    I can t believe I was scared to 
                    talk to you. 

                                  WILL
                          (LAUGHS)
                    What?!

                                  IAN
                    No, I just thought-- you were too 
                    cool, or whatever. 

                                  WILL
                    Why would you ever think that?

                                  IAN
                            (overlapped)
                    Well you did that-- dance thing. 
                    The first day. That was like-- 
                    balls. 

                                  WILL
                    What can I say. I am too cool. 
                    Maybe you should walk a few paces 
                    behind me. 

    But Ian is distracted by-- AMBER. Coming towards them.

                                  IAN
                    Do you know that girl?

      Will notices the way Ian is looking at Amber.

                                  WILL
                    Sort of. Why?

                                  IAN
                    Just wondering.

    His interest is obvious. ON WILL, swallowing disappointment. 

      Amber comes right up to them. Ignores Ian and glares at Will.

                                  AMBER
                    Dr. Rand s looking for you. She 
                    wants you in her office. 

    END OF ACT TWO.

    ACT THREE:                                                                                     28.





      Amber, Caitlin and Chloe walk back to their cabin. Amber is 
      beyond hyped--

                                  AMBER
                    You guys-- oh God, I m shaking-- 

                                  CAITLIN
                    Your teeth are chattering-- come 
                    here-- 

      Caitlin offers half of her hoodie.Now they re walking like 
      Siamese twins. Chloe tries to appear not left out. 

                                  AMBER
                    Thanks. 

                                  CHLOE
                    When Coco passed out in the hot 
                    tub... do you think that was fake?

                                  AMBER
                    You don t understand-- I was on his 
                    actual lap!I just-- have never 
                    done that before! Ever! 

                                  CHLOE
                          (to Caitlin)
                    Remember last summer when you sat 
                    on Mike Duffy s lap at movie night? 

                                  CAITLIN
                    Mike Duffy was so gay!

                                  AMBER
                    And he smelled amazing. I ve never 
                    smelled a guy like close up before.  
                          (beat)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    33.

                                  AMBER (CONT'D)
                    So-- was I okay? Did I seem like a 
                    normal person? 

                                  CHLOE
                    Sort of. 

                                  AMBER
                    Why, should I have flirted more?

                                  CAITLIN
                    You were great! Just-- don t get 
                    tied down the first week. Remember, 
                    this isn t like the real world. You 
                    could seriously have any guy here.

                                  AMBER
                          (it s hitting her)
                    Oh my God. This is so huge.



      Caitlin follows Will-- 

                                  CAITLIN
                    How much further?

                                  WILL
                    Look for two big branches, next to 
                    a rock-- oh, here we go--

      CAITLIN FOLLOWS HER GAZE: Two branches and a rock on the 
      ground. Will moves them aside, digs with a serving spoon.  
      Caitlin waits awkwardly as Will unearths a plastic bag, 
      brushes off the dirt, and pulls out a shampoo bottle. 

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    How much you want?                                                                                    36.



                                  CAITLIN
                    I ll take the bottle.

      Caitlin puts it in her backpack, and hands Will the cash. 

                                  WILL
                    So does Amber know that youpartake 
                    in the black market?

                                  CAITLIN
                    Yeah. She does. I know her, she s 
                    not a snitch.

                                  WILL
                    Come on.

                                  CAITLIN
                    Whatever, you just don t like her.
                          (then)
                    I mean, I get it. Her whole  I m so 
                    fat  thing can be kind of annoying. 
                    It s like, if you think you re fat, 
                    what am I?

    The irony that she s saying this to the much-heavier-than-her 
      Will is lost on Caitlin, but not on Will.

                                  WILL
                    Right.

                                  CAITLIN
                    But she s a good person. She 
                    wouldn t do that. Even to you.

    She exits the clearing, leaving Will alone.



      George is leading today. An obstacle course has been set up.

                                  GEORGE
                    Okay, listen up guys! This is one 
                    of the races you re gonnabe doing 
                    for the color war at the end of the 
                    summer. So form a line-- I ll be 
                    timing you-- you re gonnarun 
                    through those tires and over the 
                    climbing wall.                                                                                    37.



    ON WILL, zoned out, iPodearbuds in her ears. 

      WILL S POV: George s mouth moves, but all we hear is Riot 
      Grrlmusic. Suddenly Ian pops up in front of her. She takes 
    her earbuds out.

                                  IAN
                    Dude. That mix is amazing.

                                  WILL
                    Oh, good. I tried to pick stuff you 
                    wouldn t already have--

    As they start to get into line with the other campers--

                                  IAN
                    The last song?  All My Friends Have  
                    Been Replaced By Cities ?

                                  WILL
                    Right?

                                  IAN
                    So good. Now I have to make you 
                    one, pressure s on.

                                  WILL
                    It better be perfect. None of your 
                    Taylor Swift nonsense--

                                  IAN
                          (over her, laughing)
                    Shut up, you cannot make fun of me 
                    for that!

    ON GEORGE:

                                  GEORGE
                    Don t worry, I ll be right there to 
                    make sure you don t fall. Okay, on 
                    your mark, get set-- Go!

    The first KID takes off through the course, his FRIENDS 
      cheering him on. Amber is the next in line: tugging 
      surreptitiously at her too-tight shorts.

                                  AMBER
                    I m having some serious muffin top 
                    issues right now.

                                  CHLOE
                    Please don t mention muffins.

                                  AMBER
                    I can t be gaining, that s not 
                    possible, right? Where s Caitlin?                                                                                    38.



                                  CHLOE
                    Probably playing sick. 
                          (tryingto be a friend)
                    Maybe it s a metabolism thing. 
                    Cause-- if you re suddenly burning 
                    so much more calories, maybe your 
                    metabolism like, got confused. 

                                  AMBER
                    Is that a real thing?

                                  CHLOE
                    I don t know, I m not a scientist!

    The kid tags Amber s hand and Amber takes off. When she gets 
    to the climbing wall, she s a little daunted, but George is 
      right there to guide her--

                                  GEORGE
                    Make sure you grip the handholds--
                    that s it; you re doing great.

                                  AMBER
                    I have a thing about heights--

                                  GEORGE
                    Don t worry. I ve got you.

    He smiles at her and she melts a little... But her pleasure 
      turns to panic when he puts his hands lightly around her 
      waist. She keeps climbing. 

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    There you go, one step at a time--

      Suddenly Amber s shorts RIP, revealing embarrassing granny 
      panties that say  Tuesday  on the butt. The campers react-- 
      some laugh, some (like Ian) wince. 

    ON WILL AND BECCA: Becca can t help herself-- SNORTS with 
      laughter. But suddenly it s not so funny to Will. 

    ON AMBER: Freaking out. Dying of embarrassment.

                                  AMBER
                    Let me down--

                                  GEORGE
                    Uh, okay, just lower your foot--

                                  AMBER
                    Let go!

      George lets go of her waist and Amber scrambles down, taking 
    a little tumble to the ground.                                                                                    39.



                                  GEORGE
                    Oh my God, are you okay?

    But she s already getting up, unable to face him or anyone--

                                  AMBER
                    I m fine!

    She runs away. George is unsure of what to do--

                                  GEORGE
                    Okay guys, just-- uh--
                          (checks his watch)
                    --head back to your cabins, and 
                    I ll see you tomorrow.

    He takes off after Amber.

    ON WILL: racked with guilt.



      Amber leans against a building-- she sees

      GEORGE, winded, obviously looking for her. Amber tries to 
      walk in such a way that the split in her pants is concealed, 
      which isn t easy. Or possible. George sees her, calls out-- 

                                  GEORGE
                    Tara! Wait! 

    ON AMBER-- caught. Humiliated, she reluctantly stops. George 
      catches up to her. She can t look at him. 

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    Tara, I m so sorry.

      He s so sweet, she can t bring herself to correct him.

                                  AMBER
                    It wasn t your fault.

                                  GEORGE
                    Well, let s face it, I ve still got 
                    a lot to learn.

      Despite everything, Amber starts to relax slightly-- 

                                  AMBER
                    You do?

                                  GEORGE
                    Yeah! This is my first time 
                    actually working at a camp.                                                                                      40.



      Neither knows what to say. Amber self consciously adjusts her 
      shorts. George takes off his hoodie, holds it out.

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    Here-- maybe tie it around your 
                    waist.

      Amber, blown away by his chivalry, takes the hoodie, ties it 
      around herself...

                                  AMBER
                    Thanks. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Listen, don t be embarrassed, okay?  

                                  AMBER
                    How can I not be? 

                                  GEORGE
                    I swear to you, every person here 
                    has had embarrassing stuff happen. 
                    Probably this week! If I told you 
                    some of the stuff that s happened 
                    to me--

                                  AMBER
                    Like what? 

                                  GEORGE
                    Well-- okay. I m deaf in one ear. 

                                  AMBER
                    Oh.

                                  GEORGE
                    So there s stuff I miss. Like 
                    senior year-- I was at this party, 
                    and this girl kept turning around 
                    and looking at me. And finally she 
                    said:  Wanna make out.  And I was 
                    like:  Whoa, I mean-- sure!  And 
                    she gave me this weird look. And it 
                    turned out she was saying:  You re 
                    on my coat.  

                                  AMBER
                    Wow. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Yeah. So-- you re not the only one.
                          (heleans in, solicitous)
                    Just remember, you re a really cool 
                    girl, Tara.                                                                                    41.



                                  AMBER
                          (can hardly talk)
                    Thanks.

    He smiles down at her for a beat too long. She finds herself 
      leaning closer, to be kissed. Then George gets a grip--

                                  GEORGE
                    I better-- 

                                  AMBER
                    Yeah--

      Both get up, uncomfortable.

                                  GEORGE
                    Shay s gonnafreak when she finds 
                    out I sent those guys home early.
                          (beat)
                    I ll see you later.

    He lopes off, leaving Amber to process what just happened.



                                  IAN
                    Wow. That was epic humiliation. And 
                    I could not stop staring at her 
                    ass. I can still see it! I m a 
                    horrible person.  

    Ian realizes that Alistair has stopped walking. He stops too.

                                  ALISTAIR
                    You have to help me.
                          (beat)
                    I bought all this crapfrom Will. 
                    Chips and jerky and-- snack cakes. 
                    And I know I m gonnaeat it. You 
                    have to take it from me. Okay? 

                                  IAN
                    No! Then I ll eat it!

      They look at each other. Now what?



      Will sneaks through the bushes lugging her duffle bag, 
      followed by a paranoid Becca.

                                  BECCA
                    You can t just bolt like this. 
                          (beat)
                    At least stay til the morning, then 
                    you can ask to leave.

                                  WILL
                    I can t deal with Rand-- I m gonna
                    hitch a ride to my uncle s place. 

                                  BECCA
                    Hitch?! You can t! I won t let you. 
                    I ve watched too many specials 
                    about serial killers! 

                                  WILL
                    Becca, I ve done it a million 
                    times.
                          (then)
                    I m not staying here another night. 

    She plows ahead. Becca stops walking. Stands there, upset.                                                                                     46.



                                  BECCA
                    I m really gonnamiss you.

      This gets to Will, even if she doesn t know quite what to say 
    in return. She turns around.

                                  WILL
                    Come on, this isn t the end. We ll 
                    talk on Facebook.

    She awkwardly hugs Becca. Suddenly the SOUND OF SOMETHING-- 

                                  BECCA
                    What was that?

    The sound gets closer. Both girls are terrified-- until Ian 
      emerges from the woods.

                                  IAN
                    Thereyou are! 

                                  BECCA
                    Shh!

                                  WILL
                    What are you doing here?

                                  IAN
                    Alistair said Becca said you were 
                    leaving. I can t believe you 
                    weren t even gonnasay goodbye, 
                    jerk!

                                  WILL
                    I m not that good at goodbyes.

                                  IAN
                    Well, I wanted to give you this 
                    before you go.

    He hands her a mix CD decorated in sharpie. Will is touched.

                                  WILL
                    Thanks. This is-- thanks.

                                  IAN
                    I wrote my emailon there too. You 
                    better write me.

      This goodbye is getting harder for Will.

                                  WILL
                    I m gonnawrite! To both of you. I 
                    promise. 
                          (afraidto linger)
                    I gotta go.                                                                                    47.



                                  IAN
                    Good luck.

    Ian and Will move in for a hug and a handshake respectively, 
    and end up in an awkward half-hug. 

                                  WILL
                    Bye.

                                  BECCA
                    Bye.

      Will waves one last time, then turns and walks out of the 
      woods onto the main road.



      Will walks down the side of the road with her thumb out. A 
    car slows and then stops. She hops in. 



    Dr. Rand walks Will to the cabin steps.

                                  DR. RAND
                    Get some sleep. We ll call your 
                    uncle in the morning. If he can t 
                    come and get you I ll speak with 
                    your parents and arrange something.  

      Will isn t listening. She s staring at:

      INITIALS, NAMES, AND DATES, CARVED INTO THE WOOD RAILING OF 
    THE PORCH. The dates go back to the nineteen sixties. Will 
      touches one of them. Then, without looking at Rand...

                                  WILL
                    I want to stay. 
                          (turns)
                    I mean as long as I started this 
                    thing I should finish it. Right?
                          (beat)
                    So can I? Stay?                                                                                     52.



      Silence. Will realizes there s something she needs to say. 

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    It was messed up for me to sell 
                    food. But I vow. That I will never 
                    do it again. Ever. I said vow, 
                    that s how serious I am.

      Rand looks back at her, impassive. 



    In the dim light, WE SEE A RIBBON OF SMOKE. FIND:

    IAN AND ALISTAIR standing at a small contained fire at the 
      waters edge. Alistair empties a bag of chips into the flames, 
    WE WATCH THEM BLACKEN... 



    As the other cabin girls CHATTER and finish breakfast, Will 
      captivates Becca with her story:

                                  WILL
                    So she refusesto call my uncle--
                    andshe s all like: What are you so 
                    afraid of, Willamina?Then she 
                    drags me back here, in this really 
                    gross truck. 

    ON AMBER: Listening in. Knowing the truth.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    I gotta give the woman credit for 
                    how committed she is to ruining my 
                    summer.

                                  BECCA
                    Well, to be selfish, I m glad 
                    you re back.

      Chloe glances across the table at Amber, who avoids her gaze. 
      Chloe offers an olive branch.                                                                                    53.



                                  CHLOE
                    Wow. Amber. 
                          (Amber turns to her, 
                            distrustful)
                    Your face really looks thinner. 

                                  AMBER
                          (lights up)
                    Really?

                                  CHLOE
                    Totally. 

      Amber and Chloe share a tentative smile. Will observes this.

                                  WILL
                    How about me? Do I look any fatter?

      Before they can respond, George appears at their table. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Uh, hi. 

    It takes Amber a few seconds to realize he s addressing her. 

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    You wanna walk with me to the Life 
                    Saving Demonstration?

    The girls at the table: OMG!(Even Will, though she covers 
      it.) Amber can t speak. Chloe nudges her into saying:

                                  AMBER
                    Sure.

      Amber stands, exits with George. Becca stands, turns to Will.

                                  BECCA
                    Let s go. I wanna change my shoes 
                    before the Life Saving thing. 

                                  WILL
                    I ll meet you. There s some stuff I 
                    gotta do first.



      Amber and George walk. Amber s hyper aware of him near her. 

                                  GEORGE
                    So-- look. I feel really stupid--

                                  AMBER
                    Oh my God, me too!                                                                                    54.



      George stops walking.

                                  GEORGE
                    Wait, why do you?

                                  AMBER
                          (panics)
                    Uh... why do you?

                                  GEORGE
                    Cause I just found out I ve been 
                    calling you the wrong name all this 
                    time.

                                  AMBER
                          (relieved)
                    Oh, that s okay--

                                  GEORGE
                    No it s not-- your name s Amber!
                          (insecure)
                    Right? 
                          (shenods, transfixed)
                    Anyway. I will never call you Tara 
                    again. So-- wait, why did you feel 
                    stupid?

                                  AMBER
                    I don t. 
                          (then)
                    Just cause-- I should ve said 
                    something. 

                                  GEORGE
                    No, it was my responsibility. I m 
                    the counselor here. 

      Amber had almost forgotten.

                                  AMBER
                    Right.

                                  GEORGE
                    If I ever get something wrong like 
                    that again, just yell into my good 
                    ear. Which is this one--
                          (points)
                    Okay?

      Amber nods, crushing hard. As they both turn, start walking-- 

      GEORGE S POV: DR. RAND, at the lake shore, observing George 
    and Amber together as CAMPERS GATHER NEARBY.

      Self conscious, George breaks into a run toward the assembly. 
      This pops Amber out of her love-fog. She runs after him--                                                                                     55.





      Will stares down at: 

    THE MOUND OF DIRT WHERE SHE BURIED HER CONTRABAND. THE TWO 
      CROSSED BRANCHES; THE ROCK NEXT TO THEM. 

      Will hesitates, then-- grabs the branches, hurls them along 
      with the rock into the woods, kicks at the dirt mound until 
    it blends into the ground. Then she breaks into a run, as-- 

      PRE-LAP: CAMPERS VOICES, SINGING THE CAMP SONG 

                                  CAMPERS
                    All hail to Thee, 
                    Camp Victory, 
                    Sing praises loud and clear



      Campers stand in a circle holding hands along with counselors 
    and Dr. Rand. All sing-- 

                                  CAMPERS, COUNSELORS AND RAND
                    For though the summer sun may set, 
                    We promise we ll not soon forget 
                    The courage and the friendship we 
                    found here. 

      WILL ARRIVES, breathless, tries to slip unobtrusively into 
    the circle next to Becca, she sees 

      RAND, looking at her. Will avoids her gaze, starts singing...

                                  CAMPERS, COUNSELORS AND RAND (CONT D)  
                    So here s to thee
                    Camp Victory
                    Where hope shines like a star
                    And when our summer days are gone
                    Within our hearts you will live on
                    Camp Victory
                    How wonderful you are.                                                                                     56.
