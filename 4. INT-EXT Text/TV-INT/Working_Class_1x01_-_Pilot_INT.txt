                a new school.  But once everybody   Working Class  4/7/10 12.


                                  CARLI (CONT'D)

                realizes how great you are, they ll 

                have to get in line to sit with you. 

                                  PAM

                You have to say that.  You re my mom.

                                  CARLI

                No, because it s true.  Look, we re 

                all in a new place.  I m scared, too.  

                I don t have friends here, and I ve 

                got to find a good job.  It s not 

                easy, but you just have to put 

                yourself out there.  That s how I got 

                an interview today to manage a fancy, 

                new French cafe.

                                  PAM

                Really?  Mom, that s great.

                                  CARLI

                I know!  The owner is meeting me, 

                  personally, over cappuccino at 

                Diamonds.  So you keep that chin up!  

                Somebody s going to notice you.

                                  PAM

                (INSPIRED)  Okay!

                                  CARLI

                Alright, get going so I can put on 

                make-up.  I want to look really nice 

                for my interview.

                                  WILL

                But you always look pretty, Mommy!

  THIS STOPS CARLI IN HER TRACKS, MELTING HER HEART.  SHE PULLS 
  WILL INTO A BIG SLOPPY HUG.

                                  CARLI

                Oh, come here, you.  (TO HEAVENS)  Why 

                can t all men be six years old?

  AND WE...

                                                                              CUT TO:  Working Class  4/7/10 14.

                                        SCENE B



  THE CAPPUCCINO CART IS SET UP WITH A FEW TABLES AND CHAIRS.

  CARLI ENTERS FROM THE GROCERY AREA, WEARING A TOO-SLINKY 
  DRESS.  SHE SHAKES OFF A CHILL, SMILING AT A MANICURED, 
  HIGHLIGHTED WOMAN CLEARLY IN HER MID-FORTIES DRINKING COFFEE.

                                  CARLI

                Watch out.  That butcher section ll 

                freeze your rump roast!

  THE WOMAN SMILES POLITELY THEN GOES BACK TO HER MAGAZINE.  
  CARLI PEAKS IN THE DOUBLE STROLLER NEXT TO HER.

                                  CARLI (CONT D)

                Ooh.  Cute twins!  And just in the 

                nick of time, huh?  (QUICKLY)  Hey, no 

                  judgement here!  If my prom date 

                hadn t taken me to Lorenzo s Oil at 

                the drive-in, I would ve waited, too.  

                (OFF LOOK)  Really slow movie.

  THE WOMAN TURNS HER BACK, SHIFTING AWAY.

                                  MAN (O.S.)

                Carli?

    A DISTINGUISHED SIXTY-SOMETHING MAN, STUART DIAMOND, 
  ADDRESSES CARLI.  SHE STANDS, MAKING SURE HER SKIRT STAYS IN 
  PLACE ABOVE HER THIGH.

                                  CARLI

                In the flesh!  And you must be, Stuart.

  CARLI SHAKES HIS HAND, CHECKING HIS RING FINGER.  TOO BAD, 
  HE S TAKEN!  Working Class  4/7/10 15.




                                  STUART

                Please, sit down.

  THEY SIT.  STUART TAKES SOME PAPERWORK FROM A BRIEFCASE.

                                  STUART (CONT'D)

                I m hoping to fill this position 

                today, so maybe we could just go over 

                the application in the interview?

                                  CARLI

                  Multi-tasking, great!

                                  STUART

                Okay.  (OFF APPLICATION)  So do you 

                have experience with upscale cuisine?

                                  CARLI 

                Oh, sure.  Not so much in terms of 

                eating it or able to afford it, but I 

                have been known to jazz up a Rice-A-

                Roni when the occasion calls for it.

  STUART SMILES, JOTTING ANOTHER NOTE. 

                                  STUART

                And how are you under pressure?

                                  CARLI

                Rock solid.  I ve had three kids with 

                the flu and a backed-up toilet.  I m 

                like a Navy SEAL with a plunger!  

                (THEN)  See?

  SHE LIFTS UP HER ARMS AND INDICATES HER ARMPITS.  Working Class  4/7/10 16.




                                  CARLI (CONT'D)

                Dry as a bone!

  NOW STUART LAUGHS.  CARLI SMILES FEELING THIS IS GOING WELL.

                                  STUART

                And how about education?

                                  CARLI

                I m in favor of it.

                                  STUART

                I mean, what s your level of education?

  CARLI S SMILE FADES.  SHE S BEEN BEEN DREADING THIS QUESTION.

                                  CARLI 

                I have a degree in Child Development.

                                  STUART

                Where d you get your degree?

                                  CARLI

                Um... Illinois.

                                  STUART

                Where in Illinois?

                                  CARLI

                All over it, really.  (OFF LOOK, 

                  CONCEDING)  Okay, look, Stuart.  I 

                don t have a degree in Child 

                  Development because I, much too early, 

                started developing my own child, if 

                you know what I mean.  Working Class  4/7/10 17.




                                  STUART

                  I believe I do.  (THEN)  So no degree?

  CARLI SHAKES HER HEAD.  STUART STARTS PUTTING AWAY THE 
    APPLICATION.

                                  STUART (CONT'D)

                Well, thank you, Carli.  We ve got a 

                few other applicants to see, so --

                                  CARLI 

                Stuart, wait...

  SHE PUTS HER HAND ON THE APPLICATION.

                                  CARLI (CONT'D)

                This is the 15th interview I ve been 

                on where somebody writes me off 

                because I didn t go to college.  But I 

                can guarantee that you re not going to 

                find anyone who s going to work harder 

                than me just because they have a 

                diploma.  Because while they were at 

                frat parties drinking beer out of 

                funnels and garden hoses, I was 

                already working to support a family, 

                so I ve got four years experience on 

                anyone else out there.

  STUART CONSIDERS, STILL NOT CONVINCED.

                                  CARLI (CONT'D)

                Okay, so my life got a little off 

                track when I was eighteen.  That s   Working Class  4/7/10 18.


                                  CARLI (CONT'D)

                what lives do, right?  They make turns 

                into dead ends and alleys and cul de 

                sacs -- which is a really pretentious 

                way of saying  circle , by the way -- 

                but then they get back on the right 

                path.  Or a better one.  (THEN)  I 

                mean, your life must gotten even 

                slightly derailed at some point before 

                all this, didn t it, Stuart?

  STUART TAKES THIS IN FOR A MOMENT, THEN NODS:

                                  STUART

                  I thought I was going to get into 

                  Princeton, but they didn t accept me 

                and I had to go to Duke.

  CARLI IS ABOUT TO GIVE HIM A BIG OLD  BOO-HOO  BUT STOPS 
  HERSELF.

                                  CARLI

                Then you get it!  See, it s like we re 

                living the same lives practically.  

                (THEN)  Everybody s path takes an 

                  unexpected turn some time.  

                And Duke saw something in you when 

                  Princeton didn t.  I need you to be my 

                Duke here, Stuart.

  STUART CAN T HELP BUT SMILE.  SHE S GOT HIM.

                                  STUART 

                Could you start at nine-fifty?  Working Class  4/7/10 19.




                                  CARLI 

                  Nine-fifty a week?!  Looks like my 

                kid s gonna get his jacuzzi after all!

                                  STUART

                I m sorry.  Not nine-fifty a week.  Nine-

                fifty an hour.

                                  CARLI

                Oh.  (THEN)  But that doesn t seem 

                like much to manage a restaurant.

                                  STUART

                It s a dollar more than the check-out 

                girls make.  And it s more like a take-

                out counter.

  HE INDICATES A CHEESY  PARISIAN  AWNING BEING ERECTED NEARBY.

                                  CARLI

                Ah.  So we re not just meeting here?  

                This is the place.  Basically this is 

                just a fancy deli job?

                                  STUART

                We d like to consider it  upscale in-

                store dining .  Diamond s is a family 

                business and my son s making changes 

                to compete with the new Whole Foods.

                                  CARLI

                Look, not that I can afford to be 

                choosy, but I m hoping for a job where   Working Class  4/7/10 20.


                                  CARLI (CONT'D)

                I can move up.  Or at least that 

                doesn t involve a polyester uniform.

                                  STUART

                We have seven stores and we re always 

                looking for employees to promote to 

                our Manager Training Program.  (THEN)  

                And if it makes any difference, the 

                  uniform s a cotton-poly blend.

                                  CARLI

                  Fifty-fifty?

                                  STUART

                  Sixty-forty.

                                  CARLI

                  (CONSIDERS, THEN)  Don t have to iron it, 

                but it still breathes!  I ll take it.

  CARLI THRUSTS OUT HER HAND.  STUART LAUGHS AND SHAKES IT.

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:  Working Class  4/7/10 21.

  CARLI, WEARING A UNIFORM: AN ILL-FITTING CHEF S COAT AND 
  FLOPPY BERET... STANDS IN FRONT OF THE COMPUTERIZED REGISTER 
  BEHIND THE  CAFE  DISPLAY-CASE.  A SHORT, SKINNY, AND PIMPLE-
  FACED TWENTY-THREE YEAR OLD, JEREMY STANDS WITH CARLI, 
    DEMONSTRATING.

                                  JEREMY

                Let s go over it again: if the 

                scanner s down, you enter the item s 

                PLU here on the touch screen --

                                  CARLI

                Whoa.  Slow down, Spock.  I m not used 

                to all this new technology.

                                  JEREMY

                It s basically the same as your home 

                computer.

                                  CARLI

                I don t have a home computer.  I use 

                the one at the library after the 

                homeless guys are done with it, and 

                let me tell you, you need to wear 

                gloves half the time just to look up 

                the movie schedule.

                                  JEREMY

                                  JEREMY  (CONT'D)

                  a private tutorial is in order after 

                work, at my bachelor pad.

                                  JEREMY

                No, I don t!  (THEN)  I live with my 

                grandma.  (RE: REGISTER)  Anyway, it s 

                all here if you get stuck.

  HE HANDS CARLI A HUGE MANUAL AND HEADS OFF WITH A WINK.  
  CARLI LEAFS THROUGH IT, DAUNTED.

                                  CARLI

                Isn t there an Old Testament to go 

                along with this?

  CARLI FLIPS THROUGH A FEW MORE PAGES.

                                  MAN (O.S.)

                Excuse me.  Are you free?

  CARLI LOOKS UP TO FIND A CUSTOMER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE 
  CASE: AN EXTREMELY HANDSOME MAN AROUND CARLI S AGE.  CARLI IS 
  IMMEDIATELY DUMBSTRUCK BY HIM.  IT S A  WOW  MOMENT.

                                  CARLI

                 Free ?  No.  (BIG SMILE)  But a 

                halfway decent dinner and a bubble 

                bath has been known to do the trick. 

  SHE TRIES IN VAIN TO SMOOTH HER UNIFORM AROUND HER CURVES.

                                  HANDSOME MAN

                I meant  free  to get me a sandwich.  Working Class  4/7/10 23.




  THE HANDSOME MAN... I MEAN, THIS DUDE IS GORGEOUS... SMILES 
  BACK AT CARLI.

                                  CARLI

                Whoa, your teeth are whiter than my 

                sheets!

  THE HANDSOME MAN CHUCKLES.  CARLI BLUSHES, 
    UNCHARACTERISTICALLY SELF-CONSCIOUS.  THERE IS A SLIGHTLY 
  AWKWARD BEAT, AS SHE GRINS AT HIM LIKE A SMITTEN TEENAGER.

                Right.  No problem!  Just let me grab 

                my crib sheet here, Mister, uh...

                                  HANDSOME MAN

                Robert.  (THEN)  Rob.

  CARLI PUTS HER HANDS UP.

                                  CARLI

                Ooh, don t  rob  me!  (GOOFY)  I ve 

                been  robbed , and I like it!

  CARLI LAUGHS AWKWARDLY, WINCING A LITTLE AT HER OWN BAD PUNS.  
  SHE LOOKS DOWN AT HER  CRIB SHEET  AND READS:

                                  CARLI (CONT'D)

                  (MANGLED)   Bon-jower.  Vooz.  Ah-vez.  

                  Choy-see?   (THEN)  That s French for 

                 What do you want?   Not to mention 

                the way I sound after a pitcher of 

                  margaritas. 

  ROB LAUGHS.  CARLI STARTS TO RELAX A LITTLE.  Working Class  4/7/10 24.




                                  CARLI (CONT'D)

                I m Carli, by the way.  (FLIRTY)  So, 

                what can I get you?

                                  ROB

                What do you recommend?

  HE BENDS DOWN TO LOOK IN THE DISPLAY CASE.

                                  CARLI

                (TO HERSELF)  So many things...

  ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLASS, CARLI BENDS OVER TO LOOK IN, 
    SUGGESTIVELY...  THEN REALIZES HER TOO-LARGE UNIFORM IS 
  COVERING UP HER CLEAVAGE.

                                  CARLI (CONT'D)

                Well, I m just getting familiar with 

                all this.  (POINTING)  The turkey s 

                pretty good, but this blue cheese here 

                frankly smells like feet...

  ROB SMILES AT CARLI, NOT SURE WHAT TO MAKE OF HER.

                                  ROB

                I ll try the prosciutto.

  HE TAPS ON THE GLASS.

                                  CARLI

                Sorry.  Didn t quite see that.  Would 

                you mind pointing again?  Maybe with 

                the other hand...

  ROB DOES AND CARLI CHECKS OUT HIS LEFT HAND.  NO RING!  ON 
  HER SIDE OF THE DISPLAY, CARLI CELEBRATES WITH A SILENT: 
   YES!   SHE GRABS THE SANDWICH WITH A SMILE AND SLAPS IT ON 
  THE COUNTER.  Working Class  4/7/10 25.




                                  CARLI (CONT'D)

                That ll set you back ten-fifty... 

                which, between you and me, seems a 

                little high.

                                  ROB

                You think?

                                  CARLI

                Well, considering it s just dried meat 

                and you can get beef jerky at any 

                truck stop for about thirty-nine cents 

                a stick.  Not that I hang out at truck 

                stops.  Anymore.

  CARLI WINKS AND SASHAYS OVER TO THE REGISTER, TAPPING THE 
  SCREEN HAPPILY.

                                  CARLI (CONT'D)

                I ll just ring you up here...

                Hang on.  Don t want to accidently 

                launch a missile or something.

  CARLI SMILES, THEN TRIES AGAIN.

                (SMILE FADING)  Oops.  That doesn t 

                sound right.  (AWKWARD)  But I m sure 

                it s right here somewhere...  Working Class  4/7/10 26.




  CARLI PICKS UP THE MANUAL, FLUSTERED, AND STARTS LEAFING 
  THROUGH IT.  CARLI PUSHES A FEW MORE BUTTONS.

                                  CARLI (CONT'D)

                (OFF REGISTER)  Okay, I m sorry.  I m 

                pretty sure you don t owe me nine 

                million dollars -- unless you ve got 

                it -- so let me get some help here.

  CARLI LOOKS AROUND FOR JEREMY, BUT STOPS SHORT SEEING TWO 
  TEENAGERS MAKING-OUT ACROSS THE GROCERY, THE BOY S HANDS ON  
  THE GIRL S BUTT, OBLIVIOUS TO HIS SURROUNDINGS.

                                  CARLI (CONT'D)

                  (MOMENTARILY DISTRACTED)  Now that is 

                just inappropriate.  Who raised that 

                kid?!

  THE COUPLE COMES UP FOR AIR MOMENTARILY AND CARLI GETS A GOOD 
  LOOK AT THE BOY S FACE -- CLEARLY SEEING THAT IT S SCOTT.

                                  CARLI (CONT'D)

                  (REALIZING)  Oh my God...

  FADE IN:


  CARLI SEES SCOTT AND SUSIE, A VERY PRETTY, VERY FASHIONABLE 
  GIRL HIS AGE, BREAK THEIR KISS.  SUSIE STEPS AWAY AND HEADS 
  UP ONE AISLE.  SCOTT HEADS UP ANOTHER.

  CARLI TURNS BACK TO ROB.

                                  CARLI

                Look, I ve just got to go deal with 

                something real quick...

  SHE LOOKS AROUND, BEFORE SLIDING THE PLATE WITH THE SANDWICH 
  ON IT ACROSS THE COUNTER.

                                  CARLI (CONT'D)

                Here!  This one is on me.

  CARLI QUICKLY PULLS A BILL OUT OF HER BRA AND SLAPS IT ON THE 
  REGISTER.

                                  CARLI (CONT'D)

                Just have a seat and I ll be right 

                back!

  CARLI HURRIES OUT FROM BEHIND THE COUNTER, WITH A QUICK 
  GLANCE AT ROB S BUTT, AS SHE GOES.  SHE MOUTHS A SILENT 
   THANK YOU  TO THE HEAVENS.

  ANGLE ON: SCOTT GRABBING BAGS OF CHIPS OFF A SHELF, AS CARLI 
  STORMS UP.

                                  CARLI (CONT'D)

                Scott, what are you doing here?!  

                You re supposed to be in that big 

                building where they teach you stuff.    Working Class  4/7/10 28.


                                  CARLI (CONT'D)

                Mom...  What are you doing here?  And 

                why are you dressed like that?

                                  CARLI

                This is my new job, Scott.  (THEN)  

                But here s a better question: what are 

                you doing here?

                                  SCOTT

                It s my lunch hour.

                                  CARLI

                Well that s obvious because why else 

                would you be eating that girl s face?  

  SCOTT FLUSHES, HATING THIS.

                                   CARLI (CONT'D)

                So that was your  friend  Susie, huh? 

                                  SCOTT

                  Whatever.  Look, I gotta go.

  SCOTT STARTS OFF.  CARLI STOPS HIM.

                                  CARLI

                Not so fast.  I think it s time I met 

                your  friend  and told her a thing or 

                two about what is appropriate behavior 

                in public, which is not to say that I   Working Class  4/7/10 29.

                condone any of that... bear mauling... 

                in private either.

  CARLI STARTS OFF, LOOKING FOR SUSIE.  SCOTT STOPS HER.

                                  SCOTT

                No, Mom!  (PANICKY)  Look, I don t 

                want her to see you like this.

                                  CARLI 

                (TAKEN ABACK)  Like what?  Like 

                someone who s doing her best to 

                support this family?

  SCOTT PAUSES, NOT QUITE SURE HOW TO ANSWER.  THEN:

                  (JUDGEMENT)  Exactly.

  SCOTT HEADS OFF, LEAVING CARLI HURT AND STUNG.  SHE S ABOUT 
  TO GO AFTER HIM, WHEN JEREMY SIDLES UP NEXT TO HER.

                                  JEREMY

                Hey, FYI, the management sort of 

                frowns on you abandoning your station.

                                  CARLI

                Right!  I m coming.

  CARLI AND JEREMY START BACK TO THE COUNTER.

                                  JEREMY

                And, by the by, I saw you using your 

                womanly wiles to butter up the boss.  

                But, trust me, it s not going to work.

                                  CARLI

                The boss?   Working Class  4/7/10 30.




                                  JEREMY

                Rob.

                                  CARLI

                Rob is the boss?

                                  JEREMY

                Not only the boss.  He s Stuart 

                Diamond s son.  This whole food court 

                is his baby.

                                  CARLI

                (REALIZING THE IMPLICATIONS)  Oh, no.

  CARLI SAGS.  COULD THIS DAY GET ANY WORSE?

                                  JEREMY 

                Oh, yes!  He s also in charge of the 

                  Management Training Program.  But 

                don t get any ideas.  The line for the 

                next promotion starts behind me.

  JEREMY TURNS AWAY, HEADING OFF.

                Your family tree s going to need more 

                branches there, buddy.  Grandpa Ray 

                alone had seven brothers and sisters.

                You know what, just leave that out.  

                It was legal in Arkansas at the time

                get me a nice, big glass of Chablis to

                                  PAM

                Well, you were right.  Someone finally 

                noticed me. It was Dicky  Dumpster .

                                  CARLI

                See!  And he turned out to be a really 

                cool guy, didn t he?

                (TO PAM AND WILL)  Be right back.

  SCOTT STOPS, WITH AN EYE ROLL.

                What?

                                  CARLI 

                Today kind of gave me the idea that 

                maybe you re ashamed about me having 

                to take a job at the grocery store.  

                And I really hope I m wrong, because 

                I m finding it hard to believe that I 

                raised that kid.

                                  SCOTT

                You don t have to apologize.

                Oh, I m not.  Trust me.  Sit down! 

  CARLI PUSHES SCOTT DOWN ON THE COUCH.  SCOTT SITS.  Working Class  4/7/10 34.




                                  CARLI (CONT'D)

                See, Scott, I have to work.  I m never 

                going to be the mom who gets to sit 

                around all day at home, looking 

                through catalogs to decide what color 

                Camaro I m going to buy.

                                  SCOTT

                No one drives Camaros anymore.

                                  CARLI

                Exactly!  That s how long it s been 

                since I even thought about buying a 

                brand new car.  I ve never even taken 

                  a vacation.  I could have used the 

                money I was saving up for something 

                like that.  But I moved us here, to 

                invest in our futures, even if that 

                meant we wouldn t have as much as 

                other families.

                                  SCOTT 

                As much?  We don t have anything.

                                  CARLI

                Oh, I m sorry.  It s not raining on 

                your big, fat head, is it?  When 

                you re hungry, there s food.  Right?  

                (THEN)  I work so that you guys can 

                have the advantages I didn t have.    Working Class  4/7/10 35.


                                  CARLI (CONT'D)

                (THEN)  And if that s not good enough 

                for you, Scott, then I m not the one 

                you should be ashamed of.

  CARLI LET S THIS SOAK IN, AS SCOTT CONTINUES SULKING -- NOT 
  WILLING TO CONCEDE.

                                  SCOTT 

                Can I go now?

                                  CARLI

                It s a free country.  I mean, it s a 

                very expensive country but you re free 

                to go to your room.

                                  SCOTT

                So I m not grounded?

                                  CARLI

                ( DUH )  Like a 747 in a blizzard.

  SCOTT HEADS OFF, PASSING NICK AS HE HEADS IN, HOLDING A GLASS 
  OF WINE AND A BEER.  CARLI FLOPS ON THE COUCH, EXHAUSTED, 
  WITH A GROAN.

                                  NICK

                Okay, what happened?

  NICK NUDGES CARLI S FEET.  SHE LIFTS THEM OFF THE COUCH SO HE 
  CAN SIT, THEN FLOPS THEM BACK DOWN AGAIN.

                                  CARLI

                Nothing.  Everything s fine

  NICK HANDS HER THE WINE.  Working Class  4/7/10 36.




                                  NICK

                Come on, Car.  I haven t seen you this 

                beaten down since you got didn t make 

                  cheerleading in eighth grade.

                                  CARLI

                (STILL SMARTING)  I was robbed!  And 

                there was nobody bigger than me who 

                could anchor that pyramid!  (OFF LOOK)  

                Alright.  My big, fancy  career move  

                turns out to be a job at a deli.  I 

                flirted with my boss.  I m thirty-five 

                and I still have to wear a uniform to 

                work.  My son is ashamed of me.  And I 

                can t even work a dumb cash register.

                                  NICK

                But the good news is that Mindi 

                Meisner collapsed under all that 

                weight and three cheerleaders had to 

                go to the emergency room, right?

  CARLI SIGHS, NOT UPLIFTED.  SHE SITS UP TO SIP HER WINE.

                                  CARLI

                I should just take a job at Hooters.

                                  NICK

                No offense, Carli, but A) they haven t 

                called back, and B) maybe those (OFF 

                CARLI)   ships  have already sailed.  Working Class  4/7/10 37.




  CARLI CONSIDERS FOR A MOMENT, THEN SIGHS, DEFEATED.

                                  CARLI

                You re right.  After three kids, 

                 ships  just... sink.  (THEN)  Am I 

                doing the right thing, Nick?  I 

                thought moving here was going to be 

                great for everyone but it s just made 

                  everything harder.

  NICK SCOOCHES OVER AND PUTS AN ARM AROUND CARLI S SHOULDER.

                                  NICK 

                Carli, you re the smartest person I 

                know.  You did the right thing and 

                you re going to make this work.  You 

                want to know why?  Because that would 

                leave me to hold this family 

                  together... and the last thing I was 

                  responsible for was that new SUV I 

                borrowed from my buddy to take ice 

                fishing --

                                  CARLI

                (SHAKING HER HEAD, STILL IN DISBELIEF) 

                In March.

                                  NICK

                In my defense, it was a really cold 

                day.  (THEN)  Okay, so you have to 

                wear a uniform.  You re always fixing   Working Class  4/7/10 38.


                                  NICK (CONT'D)

                up your own clothes.  I m sure you can 

                do something to make it better.  

                Scott s a good kid.  He ll come 

                around.  And hitting on your boss, 

                well... ignore it and hope he has a 

                really, really bad memory.

                                  CARLI

                But what about this register?  The 

                manual is like a hundred pages long.

                                  NICK

                I m a college boy.  I ll help you out.

  NICK GETS UP AND HOLDS OUT HIS HAND FOR CARLI.

                                  NICK (CONT'D)

                Now prepare yourself because I m going 

                to say something I ve never said 

                before.

                                  CARLI

                 I d rather wait until our second 

                date? 

                                  NICK

                Ha.  (THEN, OFF LOOK)   Let s study. 

  CARLI CONSIDERS FOR A MOMENT, THEN GIVES NICK HER HAND AND 
  LET S HERSELF BE PULLED UP.  NICK HEADS OFF TO THE KITCHEN.  
  CARLI FOLLOWS, AS WE...

                                                                              CUT TO:  Working Class  4/7/10 39.




                                        ACT TWO

                                        SCENE H


  CARLI S BEHIND THE COUNTER, RINGING UP A SALE FOR AN OLDER, 
    EXPENSIVELY-DRESSED WOMAN, AS JEREMY OBSERVES THE EXCHANGE 
  LOUNGING AGAINST THE DISPLAY CASE NEARBY.

                                  CARLI

                One (PERFECTLY PRONOUNCED) Nicoise 

                salad.  (THEN)  Sounds a lot classier 

                than a can of tuna on lettuce, huh?

  THE LADY LAUGHS AND PUTS A FIVE IN CARLI S TIP JAR.

                                  CARLI (CONT'D)

                Hey, thanks!  Now I m only ninety-nine 

                  thousand, nine hundred and ninety-five 

                dollars away from my Rolls Royce.

  THE WOMAN LAUGHS AND HEADS OFF.

                                  JEREMY

                (OFF REGISTER)  Impressive.  You re a 

                worthy adversary.  That is so sexy.

  CARLI SCOFFS AND STARTS OUT FROM BEHIND THE COUNTER.

                                  CARLI

                Jeremy, seriously.  I m just trying 

                not to get fired here...

                                  JEREMY 

                Well, I d worry less about being 

                 fired  and more about being so hot in 

                that uniform you burst into flames.  Working Class  4/7/10 40.




  CARLI COMES OUT INTO THE CAFE AREA TO WIPE DOWN TABLES.  
  REVEAL: CARLI S UNIFORM IS EMBELLISHED AND TAILORED TO BE LOW-
  CUT AND FORM FITTING. HER BERET IS WORN AT A JAUNTY TILT.

                                  CARLI

                  I thought the top button was just a 

                little high, but then I thought  who 

                needs a top button at all ?  And I 

                figured, as long as I had the 

                  Bedazzler out already...

  CARLI SHOWS OFF THE MINI-SKIRT SHE S CREATED OUT OF HER 
  FORMERLY BAGGY UNIFORM PANTS.

                                  JEREMY

                You look like a really trashy Barbie 

                Doll.

                                  CARLI

                  (FLATTERED)  Thank you.  (THEN, 

                  NOTICING)  Well, look who s here...

  JEREMY FOLLOWS CARLI S GAZE.  SCOTT HAS JUST ENTERED THE 
  STORE WITH SUSIE.

                                  JEREMY

                Who s that?  Your boyfriend?  Because 

                I think I can take him --

                                  CARLI

                Oh, scoot!

  SHE SHOOS JEREMY AWAY, AS SCOTT BRINGS SUSIE OVER.

                                  SCOTT

                (PAINED)  Susie, this is my mom.  Mom, 

                this is Susie.  Working Class  4/7/10 41.




                                  SUSIE

                It s great to meet you, Mrs. Miller.

  CARLI CHECKS OUT SUSIE, WHO SMILES POLITELY BACK AT HER -- 
  THEN SCOTT, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HIS MOTIVATION HERE.

                                  CARLI

                (TO SUSIE)  Mrs. Miller is my second 

                  ex-husband s mom.  You can call me 

                Carli. 

  CARLI PUTS OUT HER HAND.  SUSIE SHAKES IT.

                                  CARLI (CONT'D)

                Nice to finally meet you, Susie.

                                  SUSIE

                Thank you, Carli.  (THEN)  I wanted to 

                come in and apologize for Scott and I 

                kissing like that in the store 

                  yesterday.  It was inappropriate, and 

                it won t happen again.

                                  CARLI

                I m glad to hear that.

  NOW CARLI SCRUTINIZES SCOTT MORE INTENSELY: CLEARLY THERE S 
  MORE TO THIS THAN MEETS THE EYE.  SCOTT SHIFTS UNCOMFORTABLY.

                                  SUSIE

                And, while I totally respect that fact 

                that Scott is grounded, I am having a 

                birthday party on Saturday night...

                                  CARLI

                (GETTING IT)  Ahh.  There it is!  Working Class  4/7/10 42.




                                  SUSIE

                So I was wondering if maybe you could 

                let Scott just go to the party.

  CARLI SHOOTS SCOTT A LOOK, ON TO HIM, THEN:

                                  CARLI 

                Are your parents going to be home?

                                  SUSIE

                Of course. 

                                  CARLI

                And no drinking?

                                  SCOTT

                Mom--

                                  SUSIE

                (TO SCOTT)  It s okay.  (TO CARLI)  I 

                mean, I know some parents let their 

                kids drink -- but my parents are 

                always, like:  What is this, Europe?   

                So definitely no drinking.  (THEN)  It 

                would mean a lot to me if he could be 

                there.

  SUSIE SMILES BRIGHTLY.  SCOTT LOOKS TO CARLI, EXPECTANTLY.  
  CARLI CONSIDERS, KNOWING HOW HARD THIS IS FOR HIM.

                                  CARLI

                Okay.  I guess that would be fine.  

                (TO SUSIE)  I ll just need your mom 

                and dad s number so I can call up 

                  introduce myself first.  Working Class  4/7/10 43.




                                  SUSIE

                Oh.  Actually... their number s 

                  unlisted.  (SIGNIFICANTLY)  They re 

                lawyers.

  CARLI REGISTERS THIS.

                                  CARLI

                They re lawyers?!  I see.  Well, I 

                sell sandwiches.  And I ll need that 

                number before I can let Scott go.

  CARLI SMILES AT SUSIE, BUT HER EYES MAKE IT CLEAR SHE S NOT 
  BACKING DOWN.  SUSIE TURNS TO SCOTT, HER SMILE TIGHT.

                                  SUSIE

                Can I talk to you privately?

  SCOTT NODS AND STEPS A FEW FEET AWAY WITH SUSIE.  CARLI 
  STRAINS TO LISTEN IN.

                                  SCOTT

                She s not going to back down.  Just 

                give it to her.

                                  SUSIE 

                Scott, my parents wouldn t be 

                  comfortable giving out their number to 

                just anyone.

  SCOTT REGISTERS THIS, SOMEWHAT TAKEN ABACK.

                                  SCOTT

                She s not  just anyone .  She s my 

                mom.  Working Class  4/7/10 44.




                                  SUSIE

                It s not going to happen, Scott.

   HE WANTS TO LET THIS GO, BUT... JUST CAN T.

                                  SCOTT

                Then I m not going to your party, 

                Susie.

                                  SUSIE

                Come on.  You re being ridiculous.

                                  SCOTT

                No, you re being ridiculous.  And a 

                total snob.

  SUSIE TAKES THIS IN, A LITTLE EMBARRASSED AND A LOT ANNOYED.  
  SHE LOOKS FROM SCOTT TO CARLI, WHO QUICKLY TRIES TO COVER FOR 
  HER EAVESDROPPING.

                                  SUSIE

                  Whatever, Scott.  Maybe you should 

                take the bus back.

  SUSIE TURNS ON HER HEEL AND GOES, LEAVING SCOTT STANDING 
  THERE... REALIZING WHAT HE S JUST DONE.  CARLI COMES AROUND 
  THE COUNTER TO JOIN HIM.

                                  CARLI

                What was that all about?

                                  SCOTT

                Nothing.

  A BEAT, AS CARLI TRIES TO RESIST, BUT:

                                  CARLI

                (BEAMING)  You did the right thing, 

                didn t you?    Working Class  4/7/10 45.




  SCOTT IGNORES HER, WANTING NOTHING MORE THAN TO NOT TO TALK 
  ABOUT IT.

                                  CARLI (CONT'D)

                You re a good person, Scott.  And I m 

                proud of you.  (THEN)  How about a 

                hug?   Cause I could do it quick.

                                  SCOTT

                (OVER IT)  I m going back to school.

  SCOTT STARTS OFF.  NOW CARLI OFFICIALLY CANNOT CONTAIN HER 
  JOY.

                                  CARLI

                (CALLING AFTER HIM)  And he even likes 

                school!  Looks like someone did an 

                  excellent job raising that kid!  Who 

                was that again?!  Oh yeah, I did!

  SHE LIFTS HER ARMS UP IN VICTORY.

                                  CARLI (CONT'D)

                (OFF UNDERARMS, ADDED TRIUMPH)  Dry as 

                a bone!

  CARLI SMILES, WATCHING SCOTT HEAD OUT, ENJOYING THIS 
     LEMONADE  MOMENT -- THEN NOTICES ROB APPROACHING.

                                  CARLI (CONT'D)

                (SMILE FADING)  Oh, no...

  AS ROB STEPS UP, CARLI MEETS HIM.

                                  CARLI (CONT'D)

                  (QUICKLY)  Look, before you fire me, I 

                just want you to know that I didn t 

                know you were the boss when I flirted   Working Class  4/7/10 46.


                                  CARLI (CONT'D)

                with you.  (REALIZING)  Which is not 

                to say I m going to be hitting on 

                  customers.  I mean, unless they look 

                like you.  But I ve been studying all 

                night and I want you to know that if 

                you give me another chance, I-- 

                                  ROB

                I m not firing you, Carli.

                                  CARLI 

                You re not?

                                  ROB

                No.  (OFF LOOK)  I m just here to pay 

                you back.  For my sandwich.

  ROB TAKES OUT A BILL AND PUTS IT ON THE COUNTER.  CARLI TAKES 
  THIS IN A MOMENT, A LITTLE TAKEN ABACK.  THEN:

                                  CARLI

                Well, what the hell kind of 

                  businessman are you?  I almost nuked 

                your register yesterday.  And I told 

                you your prices were too high--

                                  ROB

                I m an intuitive one.  And I ve had 

                three customers compliment the great 

                service they got here today. 

  THIS STOPS CARLI IN HER TRACKS.  SHE GRINS, PLEASED.  Working Class  4/7/10 47.




                                  CARLI

                Really?  (BIG SMILE) So... you want to 

                keep me around?

                                  ROB

                  Absolutely.  Although the, uh... mini-

                skirt may not meet safety guidelines.

  ROB CAN T RESIST A GLANCE AT CARLI S LEGS.  CARLI CATCHES HIS 
  EYE, BUSTING HIM.  THEY SMILE, A LITTLE AWKWARDLY, THEN:

                                  WOMAN (O.S.)

                Rob?  Are you ready?

  CARLI AND ROB TURN TO SEE A PILATES-SKINNY AND TASTEFULLY 
    ACCESSORIZED YOUNG WOMAN WAITING IMPATIENTLY NEARBY.

                                  ROB

                Be right there, Babe.  (THEN, TO 

                CARLI)  So... keep up the good work.

  HE TURNS AWAY AND JOINS THE WOMAN, WHO SNUGGLES INTO HIS ARM 
  AS THEY HEAD OFF.  CARLI SIGHS, A LITTLE CRESTFALLEN, 
  WATCHING THEM GO.  AFTER A BEAT, SHE REALIZES A PIMPLY ARM IS 
  SNAKING AROUND HER WAIST.

                                  JEREMY

                That s right.  Cry it out.  I m cool 

                being the rebound guy.

  JEREMY TRIES TO PUT HIS ARM AROUND CARLI, BUT SHE DEFTLY 
  TAKES HIS ARM AND TURNS HIM AWAY, IN AN ALMOST DANCE-LIKE 
  MOVE... SO HE S SUDDENLY STANDING THREE FEET AWAY AGAIN.

                                  CARLI

                Jeremy, you have to be this tall...

  SHE INDICATES A SPOT SOMEWHERE ABOVE HER SHOULDER BUT CLEARLY 
  OVER JEREMY S HEAD.  Working Class  4/7/10 48.




                                  CARLI (CONT'D)

                To ride this ride.  (THEN)  

                                  CARLI (CONT'D)

                I can see you re going to be a 

                project.  But with a little 

                  guidance... (OFF SCENT WHERE HIS ARM 

                WAS) and a lot less Paco Rabonne... we 

                might just be able to shape you up 

                enough to find you a good woman.

                                  JEREMY

                Already found one.  (THEN)  And when I 

                get promoted, I m going to treat you 

                in the manner to which you should 

                become accustomed.

  JEREMY GIVES CARLI A WINK AND STARTS OFF.

                                  CARLI

                That s assuming I don t get promoted 

                first.

  JEREMY TURNS BACK, AGHAST.

                                  CARLI (CONT'D)

                (A GRIN)  That s right, Little Man.  

                Game on.

  AND CARLI HAPPILY HEADS BACK TO WORK, LEAVING JEREMY 
  FLABBERGHASTED, AS WE...

 

                                                                            FADE OUT.
                                  END OF ACT TWO  Working Class  4/7/10 49.




                                          TAG



  PAM AND WILL FINISH THEIR HOMEWORK AT THE TABLE. NICK PUTS 
  PIZZA BOXES IN THE TRASH, AS CARLI LOOKS OVER WILL S 
  SHOULDER.

                                  CARLI 

                (TO WILL)  See?  How easy was that?  

                Your family tree s all done!

  NICK TAKES A LOOK, AS SCOTT ENTERS GRABBING A FEW SNACKS FROM 
  THE FRIDGE.

                                  NICK

                (TO WILL)  Good job, buddy.  It looks 

                  really... unique.

                                  WILL

                But it doesn t even look like a tree.

  WILL HOLDS IT UP: THE  TREE  HAS GROWN INTO A HUGE KNOT OF 
    INTERSECTING BRANCHES THAT SPRAWL ONTO OTHER SHEETS OF PAPER.

                                  CARLI

                Of course it does.  Here!

  CARLI TURNS THE WORKSHEET UPSIDE DOWN.  SUDDENLY IT MAKES 
  SENSE. THE ORIGINAL  ROOTS  NOW LOOK LIKE A SMALL TREE -- AND 
  THE CRAZY SWIRL OF BRANCHES LOOKS LIKE THE ROOTS.

                                  CARLI (CONT D)

                Doesn t matter how tall a tree grows.  

                It s only as strong as it s roots are 

                deep.

                                  WILL

                You re so smart, Mom!

  CARLI HEART MELTS.  SHE GRABS HER BABY BOY UP IN A BIG HUG  Working Class  4/7/10 50.




                                  CARLI

                You re never leaving!  Get used to it.

                                  SCOTT

                I m heading to study group--

  CARLI GRABS SCOTT, TOO, AGAINST HIS WILL.

                                  CARLI

                And this one s going to study group!  

                Does it get any better than this?

                                  PAM

                Mom, did you start early on the 

                Chablis?

  CARLI LAUGHS, ENJOYING THE MOMENT, AND PULLS PAM IN, TOO.

                                  CARLI

                And this one is so clever and witty!

  THE KIDS SQUIRM, PROTESTING.  CARLI LET S THEM GO.

                                  CARLI (CONT'D)

                Alright!  (THEN)  Just remember who it 

                is that s doing such a great job of 

                raising you up.

                                  SCOTT

                (TEASING)  Uncle Nick?

                                  CARLI

                No!  (THEN, RAISING ARMS)  This guy!

  AS CARLI CELEBRATES, ENJOYING THE MOMENT, WE...

                                                                            FADE OUT.
