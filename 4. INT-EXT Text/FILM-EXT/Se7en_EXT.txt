COUNTRY CHURCH -- DAY
The white cross on the church steeple stands against blue sky.
The church bell rings, resonating.
Mass has let out.
Small church, small congregation.
The dirt
road in front is lined with pick-up trucks and parishioners on
foot heading to outlying farms and homes.
An old two-story
house sits across the road.
Lone.
OLD HOUSE -- DAY
Birds sing.
Somerset stands, pondering the forested landscape.
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Is something wrong?
Somerset does not respond. The MAN, in an ill-fitting real
estate jacket, is seated on the hood of a dirty Ford
Thunderbird.
He holds a check and a booklet of receipts.
MAN (CONT)
Is something the matter?
SOMERSET
No... no.
There's nothing wrong.
Somerset still seems distant.
MAN
(writes receipt)
Not that it's any of my business... but,
are you figuring on moving out here
eventually?
SOMERSET
Soon.
MAN
I just never seen a man mortgaging an
empty house before.
SOMERSET
Everything here still seems... seems so
strange to me.
All this.
MAN
I don't know.
I'd say this place is
about as normal as places get.
The man walks over to hand over a receipt.
Somerset accepts the
receipt, folds it.
Somerset smiles.
SOMERSET
That is exactly what I mean.
Strange.
Somerset looks back at the house.
The man does not understand.
CHINESE BODEGA/CITY STREETS -- NIGHT
DAVID MILLS, 31, exits with a bagged 40oz bottle of beer.
He is
a lean, attractive man, constantly coiled, eyes always
smoldering.
FOLLOW as he walks quickly past iron-gated
storefronts.
He crosses the street under elevated subway
tracks.
A train roars overhead.
Mills watches it as he walks on.
Blue sparks spit off the third rail and illuminate Mills,
throwing his shadow long down the deserted street.
URBAN STREET OF ROW HOMES -- NIGHT
This rotting neighborhood lives in the shadow of a single fat
skyscraper.
Mills walks, looks at the broken refrigerators and
pieces of junk in the gutter.
Ahead in the street, TWO YOUNG THUGS struggle with a crowbar to
break into the trunk of a parked car.
Mills draws near.
One thug looks up, doesn't think Mills will
be a problem, continues prying.
Mills stops, calm.
MILLS
Is that your car, man?
FIRST THUG
What the fuck do you care?
Mills pauses, switches his beer bottle to his other hand.
MILLS
Does that car belong to you?
The thugs look at each other, gauging.
They face Mills.
FIRST THUG
Yeah, it's my car, alright?
Fuck off.
MILLS
You're telling me that's your car?
The second thug starts the long way round the car.
SECOND THUG
Well, for some strange reason, I don't
believe you.
Mills gives a "isn't that silly" laugh, shifts his gaze --
Sees the first thug slide the crowbar so it's held as a weapon.
FIRST THUG
(steps forward)
You can fucking suck my...
Mills swiftly finishes that sentence by smashing his bottle
against the first thug's head.
The thug falls, swings blindly.
The second thug moves from the side, brings out a knife.
Mills averts, swings, pounds the side of his fist into the
second thug's face -- CRACK.
Broken nose.
The second thug stumbles back, drops the knife, his nose
squirting blood.
Mills turns, enraged, breathing hard.
The first thug is screaming, trying to stand.
Mills takes one
step, punts the first thug's head.
The crowbar clatters away.
Mills is in the process of kicking a man when he's down, when
the second thug grabs him from behind, pulls him backwards.
Mills clutches at the thug's arm, trying to avoid a choke-hold.
They both struggle spastically.
The thug's winning.
Gurgling, gasping for air, Mills shifts his weight, drops to one
knee and spins the thug, slamming him against the car.
Mills breaks loose, grabs a handful of the second thug's hair
and holds the man's head against the car's side window.
Mills'
free hand pounds the thug's face: once, twice -- third time's
the charm as the window shatters.
The thug goes out cold.
Mills backs off, still incensed.
He rubs his throat, looking at
the two prone men.
Slowly, he regains some composure.
He takes a keychain from his pocket.
He unlocks the door of the
car, loads one of the thugs into the back seat.
He walks to
collect the other thug off the street.
TENEMENT/CITY STREET -- DAY
A body-bag is carried through the crowd around the tenement
doors.
Somerset follows.
Mills follows Somerset.
They walk
towards the end of the filthy block.
MILLS
I'm a little thrown.
I just finished
orientation at central, and they dumped
me off down here.
SOMERSET
I heard you brought in two small-timers
last night.
MILLS
Yeah.
Two real idiots.
SOMERSET
Since we are just starting out, I
thought we could go to a bar.
Sit and
talk for awhile.
That way we can...
MILLS
Excuse me, but I'd rather start sniffing
for a case, if it's all the same to you.
Seeing how we only have a week for this
whole transition thing.
(waits)
I want to get into the shit a.s.a.p.,
know what I mean?
Somerset walks, no reply.
Mills searches to get a read on him.
SOMERSET
I meant to ask you something... when we
spoke on the phone.
I can't help
wondering...
(pause)
Why are you here?
MILLS
(wary)
I... I don't follow.
SOMERSET
All this effort you've gone through, to
be transferred from Philadelphia to
here.
It's the first question that pops
into my head.
Mills formulates his response.
MILLS
I'm here for the same reasons as you, I
guess.
Or... at least the same reasons
you used to have for being here...
(cutting)
...before you decided to give up.
Somerset stops and faces Mills.
SOMERSET
You think you know me?
You just met me
two minutes ago.
MILLS
Maybe I don't understand the question.
SOMERSET
It's very simple.
You've come from the
"City of Brotherly Love" to the "City of
Brotherly Hate," detective.
I've never
seen it done that way.
MILLS
I don't know.
Maybe I thought I could
do more good here than there.
(pause)
You know, it'd be great by me if we
didn't start right out kicking each
other in the balls.
But, you're calling
the shots, lieutenant, so however you
want it to go.
SOMERSET
Let me tell you how I want this to go.
I want you to look, and I want you to
listen.
MILLS
I wasn't standing around Philly guarding
the fucking Liberty Bell.
SOMERSET
But, you've never worked homicide in
this city.
MILLS
I realize that.
SOMERSET
Well, please do me the favor of
remembering it.
Mills just stares back at Somerset.
Somerset walks.
Mills
rolls his eyes, looks to heaven like, "what'd I do to deserve
this?"
He follows Somerset.
INSERT -- TITLE CARD
MONDAY
CITY STREET -- MORNING
A vendor lays out a pile of tabloid newspapers at his busy
newsstand.
The headline: SECOND BIZARRE MURDER!, in huge print.
The vendor lays out another tabloid pile.
Headline: "GIVE ME MY
POUND OF FLESH," SAYS BLOODTHRISTY KILLER, in big, red letters.
The vendor places a third pile beside the others:
SICKENING
MURDERS - EXCLUSIVE DETAILS INSIDE!!!
CITY STREETS, DOWNTOWN -- NIGHT
An assault on the senses.
Crowded streets and sidewalks.
On
every corner, in every doorway, on every stairwell -- freaks,
junkies, punks, leather boys and motorcycle girls.
A few
tourists wander in the mix, heedful of the dangers around them.
Buildings border narrowly.
Somerset walks against the stream.
He carries a file.
CAR HORNS HOWL.
MUSIC BLASTS from the entrances of clubs.
REGGAE from one club is soon OVERTAKEN by RAP from a second
story window.
TECHNO-POP blasts from the tattoo parlor.
Somerset does not like this place, views it with disdain.
He
walks to avoid two men fighting on the ground.
The men are
pulling hair and pounding each other idiotically.
Somerset takes a cigarette from a full pack, lights it as he
crosses through the traffic jam in the street.
A VAGRANT steps
up with his hand out.
VAGRANT
Spare me a cigarette, money-grip?
Spare
me a cigarette?
SOMERSET
Sorry.
Last one.
He walks on.
We BEGIN to HEAR JAZZ MUSIC.
CITY STREET, PORNO DISTRICT -- NIGHT
A bright, tawdry intersection.
Neon swirls and circuit-bulbs on
porno theatres provide the flash.
Cars, taxies, and barkers
urging sexual indulgence from doorways provide the noise.
The streets and sidewalks are crowded with lonely humans, mostly
men, looking around, sizing up promises made on porno placards:
FUN WITH NUDES, BIG BOOBS, NAKED DESIRE, etc.
The usual
contingent of abnormal cretins wanders in the crowd, looking for
someone to hurt.
MOVE through the crowds.
Meet JOHN, a balding, middle-aged man,
wearing thick glasses.
There is not a single thing strange or
unusual about his appearance.
FOLLOW him as he walks.
He's
nervous, looking at the porno palaces.
His sweaty hand clutches a Bible tight against his chest.
He
doesn't feel comfortable being here.
John walks to a corner, waits for the light so he may cross.
A
grotesque STREET PREACHER approaches waving his own Bible.
People walk away from him, so he confronts John.
PREACHER
...are you, Sir?
Is Jesus Christ your
Lord and Master?
Do you believe in Him?
John tries to ignore, traffic blocking his escape.
PREACHER (CONT)
(pleading)
Don't ignore me.
Listen to what I have
to say.
Christ can be your savior!
JOHN
(quiet anger)
Leave me alone.
PREACHER
Think about God, sir.
I can help you
let Him into your life.
Finally the light changes.
John turns and spits in the
preacher's face.
The preacher recoils as John crosses quickly.
John hurries between cars in the crosswalk.
The preacher curses
from the corner, his voice drowned out in traffic.
ANOTHER CITY STREET, PORNO DISTRICT -- NIGHT
People pass on the sidewalk.
John is amongst them, but he
stops, looking up at something offscreen.
He's looking at a bright red storefront adorned with red neon:
THE HOT HOUSE.
Massage parlor.
The Hot House's BARKER notices
John's interest.
BARKER
Interesting isn't it, friend?
You like
that, you like girls, then come on in.
John doesn't hear the barker.
Steps up to study fading pictures
of naked women massaging happy men.
Nudity.
BARKER (CONT)
You'll see a lot more inside.
You'll
see a lot more than that.
John's just looking, his face bathed in bright red light, the
neon reflected in his thick glasses.
CITY MORGUE -- MORNING
It's raining hard.
Mills exits the morgue building with a few
art books and a paper cup of coffee.
He holds one art book over
his head as he dashes through deep puddles in the street.
MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING, ROOFTOP -- NIGHT
Mills and Somerset walk onto the roof.
It is a spectacular view
on all sides.
Miles of city lights.
Breathtaking.
SOUNDS of
the CITY reach them.
SOMERSET
No connection between the two victims?
Mills shakes his head, unloads what he's holding onto a rusty
table.
He sits in one of two lawn chairs.
Somerset sits across
from him.
SOMERSET (CONT)
No witnesses of any kind?
MILLS
None.
Which I can't understand.
It's
like this guy's invisible.
SOMERSET
In this city, minding your own business
is a perfected science.
Somerset takes a picture from the file, the drawing of the sun
with an eye at its center.
He opens a book, CHRISTIAN SYMBOLS,
which is full of illustrations.
He starts paging through.
SOMERSET (CONT)
At the precinct, Sunday nights, they
offer a public crime prevention course.
And, the very first thing they teach is
that you should never scream "help" if
you're in trouble.
Scream "fire."
Because people don't want to get caught
up in anything.
But, a fire... that's
entertainment.
They come running.
Somerset holds the books up to Mills, points to a picture of the
sun and eye, same as the drawing Mills found.
SOMERSET (CONT)
"The Sun in Splendor with the Eye."
It
refers to God the father, and to Saint
Thomas Aquinas.
MILLS
Which saint is he?
SOMERSET
Aquinas wrote a summary of theology,
Summa Theologica.
And he wrote about
the seven deadly sins.
Mills takes the book and looks it over.
SOMERSET (CONT)
Now, what else have you got?
MILLS
Look, I appreciate being able to talk
this out, but... it's my case.
SOMERSET
So... satisfying my curiosity.
I'm
still leaving town on Sunday.
Mills is pondering, very tired.
He unlatches his briefcase,
takes a photocopy of the photo of the falsely pretty woman and
hands it to Somerset.
MILLS
The eyes were circled.
With Mr. Gold's
blood.
SOMERSET
This is his wife?
MILLS
(nods)
She was away on business.
She got back
the day he was killed.
If this means
she saw anything, I don't know what.
We've questioned her about ten times.
SOMERSET
And, if it's a threat?
MILLS
We put her in a safe house.
SOMERSET
This is the one thing.
MILLS
I know.
SLUM TENEMENTS -- NIGHT
Two twenty-story tenement buildings stand practically underneath
the span of a bridge.
The streets are littered with garbage.
Teenagers stand in cliques in front of a liquor store.
Cars
pass slowly, CAR STEREOS PUMPING out HIP HOP.
Under the bridge, in shadow, a car is parked between two
dumpsters.
The trunk is open.
AT THE BACK OF THE CAR
The trunk is full of cardboard boxes which are in turn full of
tall, orange candles.
Hundreds of candles.
JOHN leans in under
the trunk's bulb, opens a leather pouch and checks the contents:
A plastic bottle of prescription pills.
A bottle of aspirin.
A
hypodermic needle filled with liquid.
Lastly, many jars of baby
food: STRAINED CARROTS, STRAINED SPINACH, CREAMED CORN, etc.
MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING, ROOFTOP -- NIGHT
Somerset stands at the edge, holding the photo of Mrs. Gold.
He
puffs on a cigarette, looks out at the city lights.
SOMERSET
It's like he's preaching.
(pause)
The sins were used in medieval sermons.
There were seven cardinal virtues, and
then seven deadly sins, as a learning
tool.
The sins distract man from true
worship.
True faith.
Mills is seated at the table with art books open.
A breeze fans the pages of the books.
The flipping pages reveal
views of heaven, hell, adoration, crucifixion and sin.
MILLS
Like in these paintings, and in Dante's
Purgatory, right?
But, in Purgatory,
Dante and his buddy climb that big
mountain...
SOMERSET
Seven Terraces of Purgation.
MILLS
Anyway... pride comes first, not
gluttony.
And in all the paintings,
the sins are in a different order.
I
can't find a pattern.
SOMERSET
Because there's creativity in the mix.
Consider these books as the murderer's
inspiration.
Or aspiration.
Somerset drops his cigarette to the empty street, watching the
glowing tip fall.
He looks at the woman's circled eyes.
SOMERSET (CONT)
He sees himself contributing to the body
of Christian work.
MILLS
He's punishing these people.
SOMERSET
For all of us to see and learn from.
These murders are like forced attrition.
MILLS
What?
Forced what?
SOMERSET
Attrition.
When you regret your sins,
but not because you love God.
MILLS
Because someone's holding a gun on you.
Somerset thinks.
He walks from the edge to Mills.
SOMERSET
When Mr. Gold's wife found the body,
about how long was she in the apartment?
MILLS
She didn't find it.
The door to the
apartment was open and a neighbor...
SOMERSET
I thought you said she found the body.
When she got back from a business trip.
MILLS
No.
She got back after you and I had
already been there.
Somerset thinks, coming up with something.
MILLS (CONT)
What?
Somerset holds up the photo of Mrs. Gold.
SOMERSET
Maybe she is supposed to see
something... she just hasn't had a
chance to see it yet.
MILLS' APARTMENT, FIRE ESCAPE -- NIGHT
Through the window, we can see into the bedroom.
Tracy comes
back from the living room.
She goes to her side of the bed,
kneels.
She reaches between the mattress and bedspring, takes
out a paperback book she has hidden there.
She comes to the window, opens it and climbs out onto the fire
escape.
She sits, dangles her feet through the metal bars.
She
opens the book and tries to read by the street light, resting
her head against the railing.
A WOMAN is HEARD SCREAMING
distantly.
Tracy looks down the empty street, unsettled.
The woman is not
heard again.
Tracy lays back, looks at the sky, holding herself.
We can now
see the title of the book: PREPARING FOR PARENTHOOD.
There is a
picture of a baby on the cover.
Tracy cries, quietly.
SLUM TENEMENT BUILDING -- MORNING
A crowd has gathered.
Mills' car, the police van and two
ambulances are parked on the sidewalk.
CITY STREET, CATHOLIC CHURCH -- AFTERNOON
A tall church on a bustling street.
Smoggy air has eaten at the
stonework.
The homeless are camped out on the stairs.
ABANDONED CHURCH/ORPHANAGE -- AFTERNOON
A once exemplary church, now boarded up, neglected.
Gothic in
style, it stands with deserted brownstones and empty lots of
rubble as neighbors.
Smokestacks spew smoke distantly.
Cars
and trucks drive by on a nearby elevated highway, but down here
on the street it's a ghost town.
There's a building attached to the rear of the church.
Somerset's car is parked beside it.
ABANDONED CHURCH -- LATE AFTERNOON
The streets are full of patrol cars.
Cops and forensics enter
and exit the church from various doorways.
Saw-horses are
loaded off a flat-bed truck as a police barricade is erected.
ABANDONED CHURCH -- LATE AFTERNOON
Somerset and Mills exit down the stairs.
Somerset's still
searching, holding the list.
He spies a uniformed cop, DARIO.
SOMERSET
Dario!
Come here.
Dario runs up.
Somerset puts his hand on his shoulder and makes
him walk with him.
Mills continues on to his car.
SOMERSET (CONT)
According to the Father, this orphanage
wasn't around for more than five or six
years in the late fifties.
So, I want
someone to go to the Department of Child
Welfare or City Hall and dig up all the
records on this place.
Understand?
DARIO
I got it.
SOMERSET
Get a list of every child who attended
this orphanage before it shut down.
Get
it on my desk within the hour.
Somerset releases Dario, who runs to obey.
Somerset goes to his
own car.
Mills is driving to leave, stops, revs the engine.
Somerset hands the computer list through the window.
SOMERSET (CONT)
You thought of this all by yourself?
This was your brainstorm?
MILLS
Yeah.
Is that so hard for you to
believe?
SOMERSET
It's a pleasant surprise.
MILLS
I'm not as stupid as I look.
Mills peels away.
Somerset heads to his own car.
SOMERSET
(to himself)
I guess not.
JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT BUILDING, REAR -- EARLY EVENING
Mills rushes out into this weedy, overgrown courtyard.
He sees
a thin vagrant sleeping on the building's junk-pile, then looks
all directions.
His eyes are wild.
His gun hand is shaking.
The courtyard is surrounded by alleyways.
The shooter could
have gone anywhere and is nowhere in sight.
Somerset comes out,
face wet with sweat.
Mills holsters his gun.
MILLS
Are you alright?
Are you okay?
SOMERSET
Yeah.
I think so.
They look at each other for a long time.
Both realizing they
came very close to dying.
JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT BUILDING, FRONT -- NIGHT
Police cars on scene.
Curious civilians have gathered.
CITY STREETS -- NIGHT
A block of burnt-out row homes and warehouses.
Stray, wild dogs
roam in a pack.
A car turns down this street.
It's John Doe's
car, moving fast.
Its headlights go out and it cruises,
avoiding garbage cans in the street.
FOLLOW the dark car.
Ahead, a few blocks away, we can see the
only lights in this neighborhood, the flashing reds, whites and
blues of police activity.
CITY STREET -- NIGHT
Somerset's car stops at the corner of Mills' street.
CITY STREET -- NIGHT
In Somerset's car, Tracy and Somerset continue talking.
On the other side of the street, closer to the middle of the
block, John Doe's car is parallel parked at the curb.
CITY STREET -- NIGHT
Somerset leans to pull the door shut, puts the car in gear.
He drives, turns the corner.
CITY STREET -- NIGHT
Doe gets out of his car.
He looks both ways down the street, walks towards Mills' and
Tracy's building.
MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING, ROOFTOP -- NIGHT
Mills shoves the rooftop door open.
It creaks as it swings.
Mills moves out, backwards, looking to top the raised rooftop
entrance, covering it with his gun.
He moves around, sees
nothing, walks to the edge of the roof and looks over.
CITY STREETS, PORNO DISTRICTS -- AFTERNOON
Porno theaters and Adult Bookstores rule these busy sidewalks.
Marquees offer SEXY STUFF, PUSSY FEST and movies like MIDNIGHT
PLOWBOY and NATIONAL LAM-PORN'S CHRISTMAS INSERTION.
Cops are
walking through the pedestrian flow, handing out photocopies.
There are many patrol cars on the street.
Definitely a larger
than usual police presence.
Cops are questioning the proprietors of porn at the entrances of
their shops and theaters.
Cops are taping photocopies onto lamp posts.
These photocopies
are warnings, with the drawing of John Doe's face above a line
of information and the words HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?
THE HOT HOUSE MASSAGE PARLOR -- AFTERNOON
It's a madhouse outside The Hot House.
Police action in
progress.
Cops have formed a barrier, holding off a crowd and
creating an aisle to the back of a jail-van.
Cops and
detectives escort various men, women and transvestites into the
large vehicle.
The crowd, consisting of the dregs of society,
is angry.
Some spit and throw trash at the cops.
CITY STREETS, INDUSTRIAL AREA -- NIGHT
John Doe walks in this section of huge industrial complexes.
Factories and foundries are lined side by side, seemingly for
miles.
We can HEAR TUGBOAT HORNS sounding low and deep.
We're
near the water.
Doe seems to know where he's going.
He passes stacks of
industrial piping and steel drums piled to the sky.
He walks through an industrial junk-yard filled with trashed
bulldozers, trucks and discarded factory equipment.
It's like a
stroll through a bone-yard of dead dinosaurs.
At the end of this field of metal, there is a tall, narrow
alleyway formed by two warehouses.
Doe enters, looking up at
the single lit bulb on the wall above.
He looks at the ground, picks up a rock and a beaten hubcap,
walks under the bulb.
He throws the hubcap with all his might.
It soars, but misses the bulb, falls to the ground behind.
Doe takes aim with the rock.
He throws, grunting.
The rock smashes the bulb, bringing darkness to the alley.
Doe walks back to the mouth of the alley.
He stops and turns to
start from there.
He walks, deliberately, looking down at his
feet.
FOLLOW as he walks.
He stops, looks back to the way he came, then looks down at the
ground in front of him again.
He takes off his thick glasses.
He holds the glasses in his hand.
CITY STREET -- DAY
Mills and Somerset walk towards the precinct house.
They wade
through cars to cross the street.
SOMERSET
I've decided... I want to stay on, till
this is over.
Till either it's done, or
we can see it will never end.
Mills remains impassive.
MILLS
Oh, you want to stay now?
SOMERSET
One of two things is going to happen.
We're either going to get John Doe...
or, he will finish his series of seven,
and he'll never be found.
MILLS
You think if you stay you're doing me
some big favor?
SOMERSET
I'm requesting you keep me on as your
partner a few more days.
You'd be doing
me the favor.
MILLS
You knew I'd say yes.
SOMERSET
No.
I wasn't sure at all.
They enter the precinct house.
Down the sidewalk, from a
distance, comes John Doe.
His brown workboots and clothing are
splattered with blood.
He walks towards the precinct house, hands in his pockets, like
he's merely out for a walk on a Sunday afternoon.
People on the
sidewalk stop upon seeing him, avoiding him.
CITY STREET, AT BACK OF PRECINCT HOUSE -- LATE AFTERNOON
Mills' car pulls out of the fenced parking lot.
John Doe is
seated in the rear.
The car speeds up on the street, turns onto an avenue, heading
into a canyon formed by tall buildings.
At the corner, a car is
parked.
Somerset is at the wheel.
He pulls out, follows Mills' car.
SKYSCRAPER ROOFTOP -- LATE AFTERNOON
California is dressed in full battle gear.
He looks through
binoculars at the city below.
The wind blows hard.
He turns and runs to a sleek helicopter on the roof's heli-pad,
climbs in the side door.
The PILOT leans back from the cockpit
to hand him a helmet.
California dons it, starts strapping
himself in so he can lean out the open door.
CALIFORNIA
Is this wind going to hurt us?
The pilot cranks the helicopter's whining engine and the blades
start to spin, churning the air.
PILOT
Just makes the ride a little more fun.
California hefts a high-powered automatic rifle as the chopper
lifts from the pad and takes off.
CITY STREET -- LATE AFTERNOON
Mills' car weaves through traffic.
Somerset's car isn't far behind, goes through a red light,
barely missing a truck.
Other cars blow their horns.
CITY SKY -- LATE AFTERNOON
The helicopter dips, flying like a bullet over the city skyline,
heading towards the river and the setting sun.
CITY STREETS -- LATE AFTERNOON
FROM HIGH ABOVE, we see traffic on the highway at the polluted
river's edge.
Cards and trucks move like blood through veins.
DOWN CLOSER, we can see Mills' car in the flow.
The car turns
into a lane of traffic on its way to the huge suspension bridge.
Somerset's car is in close pursuit.
UNDER THE BRIDGE, the police helicopter travels close to the
water, moving parallel to the bridge, but low, so that it's out
of the sightline of the vehicles above.
CITY STREETS, INDUSTRIAL AREA -- NIGHT
It's getting dark.
We've been in this section of factories
before, with John Doe.
The police helicopter soars overhead.
INDUSTRIAL SKIES -- NIGHT
The chopper goes high, away, over the industrial area.
It moves to the other side of the factories and settles in low
over the river.
INDUSTRIAL ROAD, AT SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT
Somerset gets out.
He looks through binoculars.
INSERT -- SOMERSET'S P.O.V. -- THROUGH BINOCULARS
Mills' car has stopped under the lights of a junk-yard.
Mills
gets out.
He walks to unlock the passenger door.
MILLS (V.O.)
(from receiver)
Alright, Somerset.
Going for a stroll.
AT MILLS' CAR
Mills opens the passenger door.
Doe looks out.
MILLS
Lean on your side.
Hands behind your
head and lock your fingers together.
Doe obliges.
Mills moves to unchain Doe's feet, cautious.
INSERT -- SOMERSET'S P.O.V. -- THROUGH BINOCULARS
Mills lets Doe out.
Doe does a deep knee bend to loosen his
legs.
Mills takes out his gun.
MILLS (V.O.)
(from receiver)
Where are we going?
Doe points with handcuffed hands, at a path through the junk-
yard, towards warehouses.
Mills motions with his gun.
MILLS (V.O.,CONT)
(from receiver)
Lead the way.
Doe starts walking.
Mills follows, keeping the gun on Doe.
We
lose sight of them behind the junk-yard's massive pieces.
AT SOMERSET'S CAR
Somerset lowers his binoculars.
He gets back in the car, leaves
the lights off, drives slowly towards Mills' car.
INDUSTRIAL AREA, JUNK-YARD -- NIGHT
Mills follows Doe past rusting collections of machines.
We took
this walk with Doe before, through this metallic bone-yard.
JOHN DOE
It's right this way.
Mills is on edge.
His eyes search the towering, twisted junk.
Sharp edges reach for the sky.
Glass breaks under their feet.
MILLS
So far, so good.
SOUNDS of BOATS on the river can be HEARD.
Doe's heading for
the alleyway created by two warehouses beyond the junk-yard.
Doe nears the alleyway.
It is pitch dark.
Doe stops before
entering, turns to Mills.
JOHN DOE
In here.
Mills steps up, keeping his distance from Doe.
He can't see a
thing in the blackness ahead.
MILLS
You go first.
Doe faces the alley.
He starts walking.
We MOVE with him as he
goes.
He's counting silently to himself, moving his lips.
Mills walks behind Doe, keeping a sharp eye out in all
directions.
He's about ten feet behind Doe, keeping his gun
trained on the back of Doe's skull.
MILLS (CONT)
Tell me where we're going.
Doe continues walking, counting his steps, a bit quicker.
WAREHOUSE ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT
Doe walks on.
Mills is behind, walking to close the gap.
We
can HEAR the faint SOUND of RUSHING WATER.
MILLS
I'll blow your head off right now!
Doe stops abruptly.
He spins on his heels, facing Mills.
Mills is getting closer, pumped, ready to pull the trigger.
Doe reaches up with his hands, takes off his glasses.
He holds
them in one hand.
The SOUND of the WATER is LOUDER.
Mills is about six feet from Doe, and knows something's wrong.
John Doe smiles.
MILLS (CONT)
What...
Doe takes one step backwards and falls, straight down,
disappears in the blink of an eye.
MILLS (CONT)
No!
INDUSTRIAL ROAD, SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT
Somerset leaps out, takes out his gun.
FOLLOW as he runs into
the junk-yard as fast as he can.
MILLS (V.O.)
(from receiver)
I'm going in!
INDUSTRIAL JUNK-YARD -- NIGHT
FOLLOW Somerset as he charges onwards through the junk-yard,
stumbling over pieces of metal.
He runs towards the alleyway.
WAREHOUSE ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT
Somerset enters the alley, short of breath.
He points his gun
in front of him, fearful.
Moving slowly.
SOMERSET
Mills!
WAREHOUSE ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT
Somerset comes upon the open manhole.
Water rushes by.
SOMERSET
Christ.
INDUSTRIAL JUNK-YARD -- NIGHT
Somerset runs to his car, driven, gasping for breath, still
soaking wet.
He stops for one second, looks.
Not too far away, the police helicopter flies low to the ground,
turning in wide circles.
Somerset climbs into the car, starts it up.
He drives away,
leaving his lights off.
The engine protests loudly, forced to
its limit.
The car disappears in darkness.
The police helicopter circles, useless.
ABANDONED CHURCH/ORPHANAGE -- NIGHT
The church stands elegant at night, when its decayed state is
partially hidden.
Small shafts of light escape from holes in
the facade and just into the blackness.
Somerset is out of his car.
He strides towards the church,
checks his gun as he goes.
FOLLOW with him, getting closer to
the church.
He climbs the stairs.
Somerset steps up and kicks the church doors open, met by a
tremendous blast of light --
ABANDONED CHURCH/ORPHANAGE -- NIGHT
Smoke billows from the windows.
The fire is moving quickly,
ravenous.
It's just starting to light up the night.
From the front door, Somerset walks weeping, carrying Mills'
body in his arms.
CEMETERY -- DAY
A field of blue.
Cops in orderly rows.
The funeral of David
Mills.
Many police officials and politicians stand in tribute.
Somerset is here, in his dress blue uniform.
He stares forward,
still numb, beaten.
Rifles are raised by a corps of riflemen.
Blanks explode from the barrels.
They reload in unison.
Somerset looks towards the grace where Mills' casket lies under
an American flag.
Tracy is there.
Tracy stands surrounded by strangers at the grave-site.
Her
head is lowered.
She cries.
Each blast of the rifle salute
causes her to react with a start.
CEMETERY -- LATER DAY
The funeral is over.
Somerset stands at the edge of the
graveyard, looking at the distant city.
Behind him, the
mourners are still filing out to their cars.
The captain approaches.
He comes to stand beside Somerset,
similarly solemn.
CAPTAIN
I don't know if I should do this.
(pause)
We found the motel room Doe must have
been staying in after you found his
apartment.
Somerset hasn't acknowledged the captain, still looking away.
CAPTAIN (CONT)
Anyway... we found this in his
belongings.
The captain takes out a sealed envelope.
Somerset takes it.
On the envelope: DETECTIVE SOMERSET, handwritten, in red marker.
MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY
Tracy and Somerset stand near a moving truck in front of the
apartment building.
MOVERS carry Tracy's belongings to the
truck.
Mills' car is attached to be towed behind.
SOMERSET
I wish I could say something...
(pause)
Something to... I don't know...
TRACY
I'll be okay.
Somerset nods.
SOMERSET
We'll keep in touch.
I'll come visit.
TRACY
I'll write to you when we get there.
SOMERSET
Take care of yourself.
(pause)
Take care of the baby.
Tracy nods.
There's nothing left for them to say.
They're both
empty.
It's time for them to give a gesture, a kiss, or a hug,
to say goodbye, but neither makes the first move.
MOVER
That's all, Mrs. Mills.
We got
everything.
Movers latch up the back of the truck while the driver climbs
in and fires up the engine.
SOMERSET
Goodbye, Tracy.
TRACY
Goodbye, Somerset.
Somerset walks away.
Tracy walks away, gets in the passenger
side of the moving truck.
CITY STREET -- LATER DAY
Sidewalks jammed with people, hurrying.
Somerset walks in a
fog, hands in his pockets.
He stops at a corner, but does not
cross.
He stands there, looks up.
At the city around him.
The buildings towering over him.
At the cars, buses and taxies racing in the streets, blowing
their horns and spouting soot.
Somerset reaches into his jacket pocket, takes out the envelope
from John Doe.
He studies it in his hand.
SOMERSET
(to himself)
Oh... man...
He opens it.
He takes out a small note, handwritten.
It reads:
PLOW THEM UNDER.
Somerset looks up again, mortified, fighting to keep control of
his emotions.
He looks around:
At the miserable people, walking past him.
At a man at the top of the subway station stairs, sitting in a
cardboard box, holding out a cup, rattling the change inside.
A father passes by, holding his young son's hand.
Somerset
turns to watch them as they pass.
The gather reaches to pick
the boy up and carry him.
The boy holds tight.
For some reason, this makes Somerset ache with sorrow.
The father hugs his son to him, kisses him on the cheek.
The
boy returns the kiss, with great affection.
Somerset watches them disappear in the mass of humanity.
He
looks back at the note in his hand.
He tears the note up, into little pieces.
PRECINCT HOUSE -- EARLY EVENING
Cars roll by in the street.
Cops come and go.
Somerset walks up the stairs into the precinct house.
