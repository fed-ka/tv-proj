       EXT.  GATE/DRIVEWAY11*

      Henry stands outside the gate of a nice house, checking his *
      clipboard. Behind him, Casey peers through the gate.*

                                  HENRY
                    How s this different from the old 
                    New Ron?

      RON stands with a white shirt on a hanger. Hair shorn to his 
      old crewcut. The rest idle by the van. Henry dials his cell--

                                  RON
                    This s New New Ron. Locked in that 
                    coffin, Henry, I was mano a mano 
                    with some heavy shit. What is a 
                    life? Who am I--?

                                  HENRY
                    And you were how high during this?

                                  RON
                      Unimportant. Don t do grass. Get 
                    high on life.

      Henry listens on the phone. Casey approaches from the house.

                                  CASEY
                    That cereal? You can smoke it--?*

                                  RON
                    No, existence. I was drifting in *
                    darkness and I heard a voice.  Only 
                    dead fish go with the flow-- 

                                  CASEY
                    Sarah Palin spoke to you--

                                  RON
                    Or maybe God, or Jesus. But it hit 
                    home. So I went right out, cut my 
                    hair, signed up with AA, got a new 
                    backup shirt. Don t drift through 
                    life. My take-away from being 
                    locked in a coffin while high.

      He heads off to join Lydia, Kyle, and Roman, who wait across 
      the driveway, gawking at him. Henry hangs up.

                                  HENRY
                    My take-away, don t get in a coffin 
                    while high. See anything?*



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                Party Down - Ep.205 - BLUE DRAFT- 10/12/09        2.

                                  CASEY
                    No. Sure it s the right address--?

      The gate opens, as a porsche pulls up. STEVE GUTTENBERG, *
      expensive work-out gear, sits at the wheel.*

                                  LYDIA
                    Ohmigod. Did you see Three Men and 
                    a Little Lady? That s Ted Danson!

                                  ROMAN
                    It s Steve Guttenberg, actually.

                                  LYDIA
                    I see why he changed it to Danson. 
                    It s very Jewishy--

      Henry approaches the car.*

                                  STEVE GUTTENBERG
                    Hi. What s all this?

                                  HENRY
                    Party Down catering? You booked us--

                                  STEVE GUTTENBERG
                    Shit.*

      Steve pulls into the driveway, exits the car.*

                                  STEVE GUTTENBERG (CONT D)*
                    My fiftieth was tonight, but my *
                    friends threw a surprise party 
                    Friday. I forgot to cancel you--

                                  HENRY
                    It s a two day cancellation policy--

                                  STEVE GUTTENBERG
                    So, I eat the deposit. What about 
                    the food and stuff?

                                  HENRY
                    Pretty much gets tossed--

                                  STEVE GUTTENBERG
                    The waste. Feels wrong. Know what? 
                    It s still my birthday. I m not 
                    doing anything. Invite your *
                    friends, let s party!*
                          (beat)*
                    Unless you have other plans--*

      Kyle, Roman and Lydia pull out cell phones.*

                                                                      MAIN TITLES                Party Down - Ep.205 - BLUE DRAFT- 10/12/09        3.



      INT.  LIVING ROOM22

      Tasteful cocktail music. The staff hang around, ties off, 
      shirts unbuttoned. Roman huddles with KENT, a blobby 20-*
      something geek. Kyle checks the house with COLETTE, a wispy-
      hot actress. Lydia and MRS. GOMEZ -- 40 s, Latina -- sip wine *
      as Steve, now in flow-y, expensive casual wear, pours.

                                  LYDIA
                    I can t believe I m really talking 
                    to you. My daughter s an actress, 
                    so I m going to pester you for 
                    secrets on making it as an actor.

                                  STEVE GUTTENBERG
                    No secret. It s like the joke. Guy 
                    gets into a cab and says,  you know 
                    how to get to Carnegie Hall?  and 
                    the driver says  Practice! 

      Lydia laughs. Mrs. Gomez looks to Lydia blankly. Explaining--

                                  LYDIA
                    The driver s deaf!
                          (to Steve)
                    This is my friend Mrs. Gomez.

                                  STEVE GUTTENBERG
                    Please, first names, it s a party.

                                  LYDIA
                          (to Mrs. Gomez)
                    What s your first name, dear?

                                  MRS. GOMEZ
                      Fulgenicia.*

                                  LYDIA
                    Oh, that s lovely.

                                  STEVE GUTTENBERG
                    You guys appear to be very close.

                                  LYDIA
                    I m new in town. Still meeting new 
                    friends. She lives across the hall.

                                  MRS. GOMEZ
                    Boys from Brazil. So scary, all 
                    those little Hitlers.

      AT THE ENTERTAINMENT CENTER, Casey stands at a shelf filled 
      with DVD s. Henry approaches.

                                  CASEY
                    Nice set-up. Must make you think 
                    quitting acting was a wrong move--

                                  HENRY
                    Did I mention my place has a view 
                    of a Taco Bell?

                                  CASEY
                    This place has Herbie Reloaded on 
                    DVD and BluRay. Point, Guttenberg.

      RON, still in his tie, approaches with a tray of appetizers.

                                  RON
                    Shrimp? Shrimp?

                                  HENRY
                    How s it feel, New Ron?

                                  RON
                    New New Ron. Getting my chops back. 
                    Gonna be a good night. Can t wait 
                    to see that feedback card!

      Ron heads off. Casey looks at Henry, who shrugs.

                                  HENRY
                    He wanted to work the party anyway. 
                    Who am I to say no?
                          (then, taking DVD)
                    Oh, my god--

                                  CASEY
                    What s that?

                                  HENRY
                    Sundown Strip. Indie I did years 
                    ago. I had one scene as a junkie 
                    trying to sell a stolen TV. God--

      He puts it back. Kyle approaches, glancing back at Colette--

                                  KYLE
                    Hey, you guys know German? What s 
                     Ein Rand?  Like,  A Rand--?

                                  CASEY
                    A writer. Ayn Rand, wrote about how 
                    awesome awesome people are--
                          (re: Colette)
                    Who s the waif?

                                  KYLE
                    Colette. From my scene study class. 
                    She s cool. Really deep--

                                  CASEY
                    Just like you.

                                  KYLE
                    Yeah. I really want to bang her--

      Steve approaches, wine bottle in hand. Smiling and pouring.

                                  STEVE GUTTENBERG
                    A man of fine taste. Try this. Pert 
                     93 Barolo. Great with cheese--

      He sees something. RON, peering into a fish tank of water.

                                  STEVE GUTTENBERG (CONT D)
                    Oh, don t touch! That s art.

                                  RON
                    This is art?

                                  STEVE GUTTENBERG
                    Joseph Kootz. That s pure iceberg 
                    water. Costs ten grand a year just 
                    to fly in new ice from Greenland.
                          (back to gang)
                    God, this takes me back. I catered, 
                    back in the day. Actors, I presume?

                                  KYLE
                          (nodding at Henry)

                                  STEVE GUTTENBERG
                    Didn t work out? Well, you know 
                    what? Those days, working gigs, 
                    making squat, just a bunch of 
                      struggling actors goofing around? 
                    Best time of my life.

                                  HENRY

      INT.  SCREENING ROOM88*

      Casey sits watching the DVD on a TV set. Rapt. Impressed.  We 
      can hear Henry s voice, acting the scene.

      Roman and Kent walk in. Kent juggles noted pages and laptop.

      Steve pops his head in, and Ron moves to block his view of 
      the pump on the counter. Steve waves pages.

                                  STEVE GUTTENBERG

      Ron grabs a tray of appetizers and the St. Emilion. Travis 
      grabs the bottle. Slides him another one. Ron takes it.

                                  RON
                    I really appreciate it, Travis--

      Ron exits. A beat. Travis eyes the bottle. Pours. Swirls, 
      sniffs. Tempted. Puts it down. Grabs the phone. Dials.

      EXT.  HOT TUB1313

      Henry sits in the tub, in boxers, swilling wine. Casey steps 
      out of her pants.

                                  HENRY
                    He s got quite an art collection. I 
                    should ve been a movie star.

                    This won t be awkward? Underwear?

      She slips into the hot tub.

                                  CASEY
                    I saw your scene. From that movie.

                                  HENRY
                    You did? Oh, man--

                    It was great. Why didn t you ever 
                    tell me you were actually good.
                          (Henry shrugs)
                    Do you miss it? Acting?

                                  HENRY
                    Being constantly rejected? No--

                                  CASEY
                    I mean doing what you re good at.

                                  HENRY
                    I think I m a good team leader.

                                  CASEY
                    Yeah, but  No risk, no reward--? 

                                  HENRY
                    I have a saying.  No risk, no 
                    risk.  After all that bullshit,

      Tipsy laughs. A moment...and then she kisses him.  A beat, 
      then Henry pulls back--

                    No, we can t do this.

                    Paul and I kinda drifted apart a 
                    few weeks ago, actually--

                                  HENRY
                      Still...Maybe this got a little *
                    lost in the shuffle, but you did 
                    kind of, you know,  break my heart  
                    and that still kinda--is there--

                                  CASEY

                          (silent)
                    Well. Now it s awkward.

      A beat, then Steve walks up.*

                                  STEVE GUTTENBERG
                    Hot tub, yes! Mind if I join?

                                  CASEY
                    Okay, but actually...I have to go.

      She gets out. Steve pulls off his shirt. As Casey grabs her 
      clothes and exits, Steve drops his pants. Steve goes 
      commando. Naked, he walks to the tub, slides in.

                                  STEVE GUTTENBERG
                    This is great, huh?

                                  HENRY
                    Yeah.

                                  STEVE GUTTENBERG
                    You should try without underwear. 
                    The jets feel great on your balls.

                                  HENRY

                    Man, you guys had great chemistry. 

      Henry nods as MRS. GOMEZ and LYDIA walk up.*

                                  LYDIA
                    Ooh. Are there suits we can borrow?

                                  STEVE GUTTENBERG
                    Who needs suits? No risk, no

      INT.  LIVING ROOM1414

      Travis checks the label on a bottle, while Carlos puts the 
      pump on the tank. Ron watches. Carlos grabs the bottle.

                                  RON
                    So, in the future, if I have issues *
                    like this, who should I call?*

      Carlos just glares at Ron. ON THE SOFA, Kyle and Roman slump.

                                  KYLE
                    I liked the first draft. Krond and 
                    DuKlark, that s the story. They re, *
                    like, Jungian shadow figures--

                                  ROMAN
                    I know. That s why you should never 
                    show your stuff. People are stupid.

      CASEY, looking rattled, stomps through the room. She pauses 
      at the sideboard, scribbles on Henry s clipboard--

                                  KYLE
                    You leaving?

      -- she just nods, terse, and she exits.

      EXT. HOT TUB1515

      HENRY, miserable, sits between a nude Kent and a Nude Mrs. 
      Gomez. Also here: Colette, Lydia and Steve. Lydia reclines.

                    like, this robot, growing a soul?
