      An interview is taking place.  The questioning is being

                                  HARRY
                    Massacre is a rather strong term 
                    for the murder of three people.

                    We tend to use strong terms when

                      injunction to kill Celenk ringing 
                    in his ears because that was one of

      LORD (PATRICK) YOUNG the ATTORNEY GENERAL is at his desk.

      Go to Harry facing him.

                    One of my best officers goes on 
                    trial tomorrow.  Wish I had your

                    Sir Gordon is hardly known as a

                                  HARRY
                    This should still have been dealt 
                    with internally.

                                  LORD YOUNG

                    And in the past it would have been. 
                    But the climate has changed rather 
                      dramatically.  We cannot be accused 
                    of any type of whitewash however 
                    small. 

                                  HARRY
                    So this is an opportunity for the 
                                                                                              *

                    liberal credentials.

                                  LORD YOUNG
                    And what an opportunity you ve 
                    given us!  A botched operation, a 
                    dead police officer, his camera-
                    friendly widow, a media that has 
                    scented blood from the start. 

      He gets up from his desk and begins to pace.

                                  LORD YOUNG (CONT'D)
                    Brave Bobbies versus Shady Spooks. 
                    Whose corner do you think we want 
                    to be seen in with an election on 
                    the horizon?  Things have changed. 

      A beat. Harry knows this is true.

                                  HARRY
                          (bitterly)
                    Somebody has to pay.

                                  LORD YOUNG
                    Somebody always has to pay, Harry. 
                    We ve at least ensured it s one 
                    officer and not the whole of MI5 
                    that picks up the bill.

                                  HARRY
                    She s a fine officer, Patrick.

                                  LORD YOUNG
                    And that s why we re only talking a 
                    slapped wrist. 

      Harry looks unhappy. Lord Young pats his shoulder.

                                  LORD YOUNG (CONT D)
                    And she may get off.  Come to the 
                    club later and I ll buy you a 
                    Scotch to make amends. 

      Harry s face darkens.

      INT. ZOE AND DANNY S FLAT - NIGHT 2. 2000
44

      Zoe is answering her front door.  It s WILL.  They stare at 
      each other for a moment. 

                                  WILL
                    You called me.

                                  ZOE
                    Come in.

      He walks into the flat, looking around him as if seeing it 
      for the first time.  His manner is icy. 

                                  WILL
                    So?

                                  ZOE
                    I don t know where to start.

                                  WILL
                    Well let me help.  Start at the 
                    point where my idiot brother stole 
                    some photos from me and you decided 
                    it was all my fault.

                                  ZOE
                    I told you how important trust was.

                                  WILL
                    And that works both ways.  Do you 
                    really believe that I would have 
                    given them to my brother to sell?

      A beat.

                                  ZOE
                    No.

                                  WILL
                    Good, I m glad we ve sorted that 
                    out ...

      He turns to leave.

                                  ZOE
                    Will!

      He turns back.

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                    I m in a lot of trouble at the 
                    moment.

                                  WILL
                    What kind of trouble?




                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                                  ZOE
                    I can t tell you.  Just ... I ve 
                    been very scared and lonely ...

      He stands in front of her.  Shakes his head and laughs.

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                    What is it?

                                  WILL
                    You know when somebody has caused 
                    you real pain.  And you think, what 
                    did I ever do to deserve this?  So 
                    you lie awake at night hating that 
                    person and then you see them again 
                    and the first thing you want to do 
                    is put your arms around them.  It s 
                    kind of humiliating. 

      She looks at him.

                                  ZOE
                    So put your arms around me.

      He hesitates and then takes her in his arms.  She shuts her 
      eyes.

                                  WILL
                    I d ask what s going on but I know 
                    you won t tell me.

                                  ZOE
                    I can t.  Please just trust me.

                                  WILL
                    Trust you?

                                  ZOE
                    Please.  I ll contact you when this 
                    is all over.

      He strokes her hair.

                                  WILL
                    You never have to be lonely, Zoe.

      She breaks away from him.

                                  ZOE
                    I m so sorry for hurting you.  
                    You re right about not deserving 
                    it.

      A frenzy of media activity as people enter the court room. A

                    Services - is above the law.

      A few men are sitting around smoking and drinking coffee. 
      Suddenly at least four MEN burst into the cafe.  Mayhem 
      ensues.  Baseball bats flying and oaths in Turkish and 
      Kurdish.  The men who have come in are inflicting some 
      serious damage on the clientele.  One of the attackers is 
      Ozal.  He walks slowly to the back of the cafe where cowering 
      behind the door is a trembling MAN holding a baseball bat.  
      When he sees Ozal he drops the bat.  Ozal grins, takes out a 
      gun from his jacket pocket and advances towards him.  The man 
      is visably terrified.  Ozal puts the gun to his head and 
                                                                                              **

                      a warning.  We don t want to anger 
                    him.

      A beat while Ozal stares at the man.  Still might do it. 
      Hasan head-butts man and puts him down. Spits on the 
      prostrate form.  Ozal stares at Hasan.  Then he laughs and 
      slaps him on the back.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Ozal and his henchmen are walking through the streets of 
      North London as if they own them.  Ozal is miming the terror 
      of the man with the baseball bat.  His MEN are laughing 
        sycophantically.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. CASINO - NIGHT B (FLASHBACK). 2000
1212*

      Ozal and his men strut into the casino.  Bouncer moves to pat 
      him down but another bouncer restrains him.  These are Alpha 
      Males.

      Ozal takes up his place at the roulette wheel, places a large 
      stake.  The croupier does his job, the wheel spins, Ozal 
      watches intently and the ball comes to rest on his number.  
      He s won.  He smiles with satisfaction and then his eyes meet 
      another pair of eyes across the table.  They are glittering 
      with amusement and belong to a very beautiful woman in an 
      expensive dress and a diamond necklace.  It s Zoe.  She is 
      with a Turkish MAN.  Ozal bets again and wins again.  Zoe 
      laughs and Ozal, encouraged, gathers his chips and comes 
      over.

      And he can t resist moving his jacket slightly to show Zoe 
      his gun.  A miscalculation.  She frowns.

      And she walks angrily away while he follows her with his 
      eyes.  Returns to the roulette table.  Places another bet.

      Ozal gathers his winnings. In the background Hasan Doyan is

      laughing with a couple of associates.  MAHMOUD comes over and 
      exchanges a whispered conversation with Ozal in Turkish.  
      Ozal seems to have heard something significant because he 
      makes his way quickly towards

      Where he sees Zoe at the cloakroom counter.  From Ozal s POV 
      we see that she is arguing with the cloakroom assistant but 
      Ozal s attention is gripped by Zoe.  He smiles and watches.

      Zoe turns, eyes flashing dangerously.

                    What did you say?  You think you

                    Why don t you let me buy you a new 
                    scarf?

      Zoe turns.  Her face is a little flustered at being surprised 
      in this haute-dame routine.

                                  ZOE

      Mahmoud appears.  Gives Zoe a questioning look.  Zoe takes 
      out a small notepad with a Mont Blanc pen.  She writes a 
      mobile number on it and gives it to Ozal.  Then she turns 
      without speaking and leaves.  Ozal watches her leave, kisses 
      the piece of paper, folds it and puts it in his pocket.

                    Not jealous no.  But if some

                    And why should she start running 
                    after you?


      A look between them.  As if this relates to some kind of 
      previous debate.  Zoe outstares him.  He puts the gun away.

                                  OZAL (CONT'D)
                    She would never be able to catch 
                    you. She is too fat.

      A beat.  Zoe can t help laughing.

                                  ZOE
                    So there is a wife.  You shouldn t 
                    talk about her like that.

                                  OZAL
                    Why not?  It is true.  She is a 
                    good cook, she eats too much of her 
                    own food. 
                          (shrugs)
                    She is my wife.

      He genuinely can t quite understand what Zoe s problem is.

                                  CELENK (V.O.)
                    Still a man should always respect 
                    his wife.

      Ozal whips around.  Standing with an amused look on his face 
      is EMRE CELENK.  He is in his mid-forties with sharp 
      intelligent eyes.  Behind him is his bodyguard MEHMET SALEM.

                                  OZAL
                    This is ...

                                  CELENK
                    Sophie Newman.  I have heard about 
                    you.

                                  ZOE
                    Really.  From whom?

      He shrugs as if this is unimportant.

                                  CELENK
                    I was told you were beautiful and 
                    they did not exaggerate.  It is a 
                    pleasure to meet you, Miss Newman 
                    but if you will excuse me I have 
                    some rather urgent business to 
                    discuss with my colleague here.

                                  ZOE
                    Of course.

      She starts to leave.

                    later?

      Ozal looks uncomfortable.  But Celenk has such an air of 
      authority that he cannot challenge him.

                                  CELENK (CONT D)

      Early morning and lawyers in wigs standing smoking. Newspaper

      standing alone.  He doesn t notice a woman standing next to 
      him also smoking furiously.  It is Gillian Doyan.

                    I have to go to Frankfurt on a 
                    business trip.  I need somebody 
                    with me who speaks German, knows 
                    the city.

      Ozal s face.  Clearly most unhappy.

                                  OZAL
                    How long for?

                                  CELENK
                    Oh just a weekend. 

      He looks at the plate of untouched food that Ozal has pushed 
      away.

                                  CELENK (CONT D)
                    How strange.  One trip to the 
                    toilet and suddenly you lose your 
                    appetite?

      Again he laughs a little contemptuously.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                    I got drunk.  I beat my wife.  I 
                    was blinded by love but only God 
                    can forgive me those crimes.

                    She came to my office.

      Zoe is sitting behind Ozal s desk, more soberly dressed than

                    You slept with him?

                                  ZOE
                    And what did you expect?  You let 
                    me go when it was obvious that he 
                    wanted me.

                                  OZAL
                    He s my boss.  I couldn t say no to 
                    him.

                                  ZOE
                    And nor could I.  He s a very 
                      persuasive and powerful man.

      She looks up at him.

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                    More powerful than you.

      He draws his gun and places it against the side of her head.  
      She does not flinch.

                    Killing me won t help you.  He s 
                    the one who laughs at you, calls 
                    you  stupid and weak.  To kill me 
                    would only make him laugh more.

                                  OZAL
                    He was laughing at me?

                                  ZOE
                    As he undressed me. 

      Ozal s finger tightens on the trigger.  Zoe is taking this 
      right to the wire.

                                  OZAL
                    I ll kill him!

      She laughs scornfully.

                                  ZOE
                    You wouldn t dare.  It s more 
                    likely that he ll have you killed 
                    now.  He thinks you re weak.

                                  OZAL
                    Weak?

                                  ZOE
                    Show me you re not weak and things 
                    might be different.  Show me you 
                    care enough about me.

                                  OZAL
                    You re driving me crazy. 

                                  ZOE
                    You know what you have to do for us 
                    to be together.

      He stares at her.  She gently pushes the gun away and puts 
      her hand to his face.

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                    Kill him.

      Two MEN are seated in earnest conversation in the warehouse. 
      One is Celenk, the other is Hasan Doyan the undercover 
      policeman.  Behind them is Mehmet Salem the bodyguard.  
      Celenk looks up and smiles as he sees Ozal.

      Ozal draws his gun.  Mehmet Salem moves quickly but Ozal is 
      quicker and he shoots him.  Salem falls to the floor 
      writhing.  Ozal adminsters the coup de grace.  Turns to face 
      Celenk and Hasan Doyan.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      The court room hushed at the sound of furious shouting in 
      Turkish.  Everybody in the public gallery mesmerised.  Tape 
      pauses.

      English.

      Two shots.  A small gasp of anguish from Gillian Doyan. DS  
                                                                                              *
      Loughton squeezes her arm.  The tape continues.  Then

      Danny comes in with somebody behind him.  It s Harry.

                    Because they need to slap our wrist

                    These are victims of the recent 
                    feuding between two factions of the 
                    Turkish mafia.  One wing was more 
                      associated with the heroin trade, 
                    the other was involved in smuggling 
                    arms. It would appear that a 
                    decisive winner has now emerged 
                    from that battle.

                    And not just guns.  He has close 
                    links to the Balkan arms route and 
                    the weaponry is getting more and 
                    more sophisticated.  Some of that 
                    stuff could easily fall into 
                    terrorist hands.

      Another photo comes up. It is Sevilin Ozal.

      She glances at him sharply.

                                  DANNY (CONT D)

      Zoe in the witness stand.

                    OK, during the briefing of that 
                    Monday morning was it ever 
                    suggested that one of the 
                      objectives of this operation was 
                    the assassination of Emre Celenk.

                                  ZOE
                      Definitely not.

                                    DEFENCE QC
                    What about euphemisms?  Remove him? 
                    Cancel his contract?  I m not au 
                    fait with the most up to date 
                      terminology.

                                  ZOE
                    No euphemisms were used in the case 
                    of Emre Celenk.  And no such course 
                    of action was suggested at any time 
                    during the briefing.

                                    DEFENCE QC
                    Right.  Now Mr Ozal in his evidence 
                    made reference to an individual 
                    called Mahmoud.  You arrived at the 
                    casino with him on the first night 
                    you met Mr Ozal.  Can you tell us 
                    more about that?

                    this particular cake comes without

      Danny at his desk looks up and sees Zoe arriving dressed up 
      for her first meeting with Ozal at the casino.  She is 
      stunning but a little nervous.  Danny stares and we guess 
      that he still feels a certain amount of pain for her.  She 
      fingers the diamond necklace.

      She looks puzzled and then clocks.  Unfastens the diamonds 
      from around her neck and drops them in his outstretched palm.

      the POV of the person on the bench reading a newspaper who is 
      an MI5 AGENT.  When he clocks Ozal he speaks quickly into 
      voice-com.

                    You think there s no such thing as

                    They are not very useful concepts. 
                    War, disease, genocide are all far 
                    better because they are real rather 
                    than abstract and of course because 
                    they reduce the number of human 
                    beings in the world.

      She slaps the mobile out of his hand.

      It clatters to the ground and they both look at it.

      Zoe looks at Celenk and she s scared.

      He smiles, steps forward, and plays with a strand of her 
      hair.

                    My sentence has to reflect two 
                      fundamental factors.  First, there 
                    is your excellent professional 
                    record and the unblemished career 
                    which you had enjoyed.  But I also 
                    have to take into account the need 
                    of the public to feel secure that 
                    nobody is above the law.  I hereby 
                    sentence you to ten years in prison 
                    for the count of conspiracy to 
                    murder Emre Celenk and seven years 
                    in prison for both counts of 
                      involuntary manslaughter.  The 
                    sentences will run concurrently.


      Zoe shudders slightly as if she has been punched but her face 
      does not change.

                    This was a show trial.

                                  LORD YOUNG
                    To a degree yes.  We were showing 
                    that we don t live in a state where 
                    the rule of the law counts for

      They stare at each other and then Lord Young gestures for him 
      to sit down.

      Adam flies onto The Grid, grabs Malcolm and Colin.  The three 
      stand on The Grid holding an urgent conference.  Then Malcolm 
      and Colin disappear running in different directions.  Adam 
      takes out a mobile.

                                  ADAM
                    It s Adam.  No time for

      Behind him, we see Malcolm running back across The Grid.

      Danny sees Adam and Harry walking fast towards him.  Adam 
      passes Harry an envelope.  As they approach.

      Through a glass window, Danny is looking at Harry and Zoe 
      sitting at a table together.  The envelope is on the table in 
      front of her.  He is expostulating, but she is shaking her 
      head vigorously.  She picks up the envelope and angrily 
      throws it back at him.  Harry gets up and walks out to where 
      Danny is standing.

                                                                                              *
                    Yes.  It never went away.
                                                                                              *

      He holds the passport out to her.  She hesitates for a 
      moment.

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                                                                                              *
                    Take it.  It s your freedom and 
                    Harry had to threaten a coup to get 
                    it. 

      She shakes her head.  At that point from another door two 
      prison officers enter.  Zoe jumps up.

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    WAIT!  Please.  One minute.

      They look at each other and retire.

                                  ZOE
                    I ll know who I am and what I ve 
                    done.

                                  DANNY
                    Really?  Because your name wouldn t 
                                                                                              *
                    be Zoe Reynolds in prison.  How do 
                                                                                              **

      Zoe obviously hasn t considered this.

                                  ZOE
                    It never stops.

                                  DANNY 
                    What is your real identity, Zoe?  
                    Who ever really knows that?  If 
                    it s anything, it s the impulse 
                    that led you to decide that 
                    ordinary lives weren t trivial and 
                    that you had a duty to protect 
                    them.  The question is whether you 
                    allow them to put that identity 
                    behind bars for ten years.

      She stares at him.

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    Some lucky person in Chile who 
                    doesn t know it yet is going to 
                    meet Gina Hamilton.  Maybe you ll 
                    have kids.

                    I d like to have a child one day.  
                    A little girl.

                    Then get away from here.

      He puts the passport into her hand.  She stares at it and 
      then puts her arms around Danny.

                                  ZOE
                    I ll never see you again.

                                  DANNY
                    Maybe one day when nothing matters 
                    any more, I ll come out and we ll 
                    sit by the ocean and laugh at all 
                    this.

                                  ZOE
                    Oh, Danny.

                                  DANNY
                    You mustn t cry.

                                  ZOE
                    No.

      He holds her away from him.  They look at each other one last 
      time.

                                  DANNY
                    You have to go.

      The prison officers have arrived and this time Zoe must 
      leave.  She turns and gives him one last look and then she 
      walks out with her plain clothed guards.  For a beat Danny 
                                                                                              *
      stands completely alone but then the door opens and Harry 
      comes in.  Danny turns to face him.  He opens his hands like

                    Gone!

      And finally his face crumples.  Harry walks over, puts his 
                                                                                              *

      for the friend and colleague that he will never see again.
