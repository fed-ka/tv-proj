Aerial view of the Earth's only natural satellite, the
camera roaming about a hundred feet off the surface.
Desolation. Serious, uncompromising, desolation. This place
makes Antarctica look like Tokyo.
And utter silence.
Eventually the camera arrives at a moon base, DIVING DOWN
towards it --
TITLE CARD: "MINING BASE SELENE. CREW: 1."

The empty terrain surrounding the mining base, as viewed
from the Monitoring Station window. Across the landscape a
mountain rises from the morning shadows.
SAM (V.O.)
It's bleak, it's beautiful.
CLOSE UP -- A HAND TOOL
Some kind of rake or shovel half buried in the powdery
soil, like a child's toy abandoned in a sand box.

SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
It's barren, yet filled with
riches.

From up here it is easy to see why the Earth is sometimes
referred to as "the blue marble." A swirl of color.
SAM (V.O.)
The earth is thousands and
thousands of miles away, but
sometimes looks so close I feel
like I could reach out and snatch
it with my hand.

We take in the whole Moon at once. Gray, colorless, eerie.
From this distance the surface resembling Plaster of Paris.

The second in a fleet of four Harvesters (this one known as
Mark) collecting lunar soil. The Harvester resembles a tank
and kicks up clouds of dust. Booming, hulking, efficient.
Sam catches up in his Rover and accelerates into the back
of the Harvester up a couple of ramps. An intricate and
dangerous maneuver he executes deftly.

The Earth at night, illuminated by a glittering spider's
web of artificial lighting. From the Moon this is one of
the most beautiful sights you'll ever see.

LUKE, one of the Harvesters, crossing the lunar landscape
at HALF SPEED.

A desolation special. The blacker than black sky above.
None of the ingredients of life. On Earth we have
rainforests, and flowers, and birds. We have color. Up here
we realize how lucky we are. The base is lit by large
halogen comfort lights, alone in the lunar desert. This is
a lunar night.

Sam heading towards the stalled Harvester. It soon becomes
apparent that there is something STUCK under the front of
the Harvester's AXLE. A second later it is apparent what
that something is: inevitably, it's the MISSING ROVER.
Sam slows his Rover down, approaching the scene with
CAUTION. He parks a few feet away from the wreck and opens
the door of his Rover, stepping outside gingerly.
ONE SIXTH GRAVITY is like walking on a trampoline. Sam
takes long strides, bobbing over to the front of the
Harvester to take a closer look, his boots leaving deep
FOOTPRINTS in the lunar soil.

THE FRONT OF THE HARVESTER
The crashed Rover is exactly as we left it after the
accident, mangled, crushed, captured beneath the trundles
of the Harvester. Sam peers closer and sees that there is
an UNCONSCIOUS MAN in a Lunar Industries space suit trapped
inside.
Sam can't see the man's face -- he has his back to Sam, his
body sprawled across the passenger seat like he's searching
for loose change on the floor of the vehicle.
With great effort Sam manages to prize the Rover's door
open. He reaches inside and begins to pull the man out --
Sam's sheer ADRENALINE giving him the strength of a YETI.
Sam DRAGS the unconscious man away from the crashed Rover,
his body leaving a big TRACK MARK in the gray soil. Sam
takes a second to catch his breath, then leans down and
turns the unconscious man onto his back.
He BRUSHES DUST from the glass of the man's HELMET, leans
down even closer.
CLOSE UP -- THE MAN
Through his helmet we see a BLOODY and BEARDED SAM. Sam as
we remember him. The Sam from the opening twenty minutes of
the film.
Sam's face as the PANIC, the ALARM, the SHOCK, the
REALIZATION hit him like a wrecking ball: this man he has
just pulled out of the crashed Rover is himself.
WIDE SHOT -- THE STALLED HARVESTER
Sam gathers his wits and manages to lift the unconscious
Sam up over his shoulder, fireman's lift style, taking him
to the parked Rover.

Sam 2 driving along in his Rover. He comes across another
one of these JAMMERS. He drives right up, ducks down,
peering up through the windshield -- this new Jammer is as
tall as the others, in fact, it is identical in every way.
How many of these things are there?

Sam 2 circles the Jammer in the Rover, drives on.

The Rover viewed from outside. We can't hear a thing. Just
the endless and unrelenting MOON SILENCE.
Inside the Rover we are able to make out Sam 1, quivering
at the wheel as he sobs.

Shot of Selene from across the lunar plane. The base looks
