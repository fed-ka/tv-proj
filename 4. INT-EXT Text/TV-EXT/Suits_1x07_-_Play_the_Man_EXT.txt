      MIKE speeds on his bike towards Pearson Hardman, suited up, 
      briefs sticking out of his shoulder bag.  He weaves through a 
      couple of suits.  He cuts the corner close and SCREECH.  He 
      swerves, narrowly missing RACHEL, who spills her coffee.

                                  RACHEL
                    Watch it!

      Mike leaps off his bike.  Rachel shakes coffee off her hands.

                                  MIKE
                    I m so sorry.  Are you okay?

                                  RACHEL
                    There are easier ways to kill me if 
                    you re worried that I ll rat you 
                    out for LSAT cheating.

      She barrels into the revolving door of the firm.

                                  MIKE
                    Rachel --

      He starts to chase after her and then remembers his bike.

      He rushes to chain it up and runs in after her.



      Harvey shaking the hand of DANIEL VEGA,(45) tanned and 
      jovial.  They sit with Jones in the lobby of a DeBeque s 
      hotel.

                                  HARVEY
                    Daniel, the paperwork looks good, 
                    despite the fact that you two 
                    decided to go lawyer commando, but 
                    the devil s always in the details--

                    Harvey, I know impulse purchases 
                    don t exist in your world, but the 
                    timing is right.

                                  DANIEL

                    leave that up to my man, Scott.

      The CLICK CLICK of heels is heard on the hotel lobby floor.  
      Harvey slow-motion turns and locks eyes with DANA  SCOTTIE  
      SCOTT.  She s the intelligence of Ruth Bader-Ginsberg, with 
      the body of Ava Gardner and the confidence of Harvey Specter.

                                  DANIEL (CONT D)
                    Meet Ms. Dana Scott.

                    Harvey.

      An icy veneer has fallen over both of them, as though we ve 
      just marked the start of World War Three.

                                  JONES
                    You two know each other?

      Jones starts leading the four of them through the first floor 
      of the hotel.

                                    SCOTTIE
                    We were at Harvard Law together.  
                    Harvey was number five in the class 
                    and I was, oh I forget, what was 
                    it?

                                  HARVEY
                    Married to the library.

                                    SCOTTIE
                    That s right.  Number one.

                                  HARVEY
                    Yes, number one.  At studying.  But 
                    what s my success rate against you 
                    in the real world where we practice 
                    real law?

                                    SCOTTIE
                    Harvey, there should be no winners 
                    or losers in a merger.  Just a 
                    happy new couple.

                                  HARVEY
                    That s right.  Three and oh.

      They ve landed outside the elevators.  Jones and Daniel size 
      these two up.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)          SUITS  #107  "Play the Man"  Final Shooting Script 7/27/11  16

                    Well, I say we let these two talk 
                    deal points while I try your chef s 
                    famous Sea Bass.

      Jones hands Harvey a key to a suite.

                                  JONES
                    Play nice.  Remember --  
                          (indicating Daniel)
                    We like each other, even if you two 
                    don t.

      All four share a laugh.  One that is immediately dropped by 
      Harvey and Scottie as soon as the men have turned.  

                                    SCOTTIE
                    Married to the library?

                                  HARVEY
                    It s not my fault if the library is 
                    the best you could do.

      The elevator doors open and Harvey and Scottie enter.

                                    SCOTTIE
                    If we were going to the first 
                    floor, I d push the button.  But 
                      ironically, we re going to the 
                    fifth floor.

                                  HARVEY
                    Really?

      As the doors close.

                                    SCOTTIE
                    Do you understand what I just did?  
                    Cause you were fifth in the class

      Mike walks towards Donna s desk with a folder.

                                  MIKE
                    Hey, Donna, I proofed the final 
                    agreement on the hotel merger.  
                    Quick question--has Harvey ever 
                    heard of spell check?

      Donna looks up at Mike and we see tears streaming down her 
      face.

                                  MIKE (CONT D)
                    What?

      He has no idea how to deal with this.  She lets out a sob.

                                  MIKE (CONT D)
                    No, no, don t cry, it s okay.  
                          (he hands her a tissue 
                            from her desk)
                    Shhh.  Shhh.

      She chokes on her words.  She bites her lip, fighting the 
      tears...and she drops it.

                                  DONNA
                    Not bad, right?

      Mike takes a step back.  Totally unsure.

                                  DONNA (CONT D)
                    I can also do a Demi Moore single 
                    tear if that s better for the 
                      character.

                                  MIKE
                    I really don t understand.

                                  DONNA
                    If I m going to be Lena Lunders for 
                    you, I want to be able to use my 
                    full range of emotions.

      Mike smiles.

      Donna narrows her eyes.  Kyle hurries away.  Mike watches.

      Mike s standing outside a door, holding a case binder and ice 
      cream.  JENNY stands opposite him, not amused.

                    Pushed me away, then disappeared on

      Scottie emerges out the front doors of the hotel with a 
      suitcase.  A door to a town car is opened for her.  Harvey 
      intercepts her and they walk...

                                    SCOTTIE
                    You here to give me a proper send-
                    off?

                                  HARVEY
                    I don t think we can do that out 
                    here on the street.

                                    SCOTTIE
                    You sure?

                                  HARVEY
                    You tricked me, I m impressed.

                                    SCOTTIE
                    To be fair, Vega did want a merger.  
                    I just convinced him that given 
                    your client s propensity for rash 
                      purchases, allowing him to remain 
                    in charge was a bad idea.  Vega 
                    needed Debeque s Hotels minus 
                    Debeque.  And I found a way.

                                  HARVEY
                    A way he never asked for or wanted.  
                    And one he s never going to get.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)          SUITS  #107  "Play the Man"  Final Shooting Script 7/27/11  50

      Harvey hands her a document.  Scottie takes a look.

                                    SCOTTIE
                    Is this for real?

                                  HARVEY
                    Three of DeBeque s properties will 
                    be on the market by the end of day.

                                    SCOTTIE
                    He s never going to let you sell 
                    off his crown jewels.

                                  HARVEY
                    Here s the thing about passionate 
                    clients.  When they re crossed, 
                    they get angry, and then they ll do 
                    anything to get back.

                                    SCOTTIE
                    Don t do this Harvey.

                                  HARVEY
                      Alternatively, we can get our 
                    clients in a room together, you can 
                    tell them you were wrong and 
                    convince them back into a merger.  
                    The second one sounds more fun to 
                    me.  Because it means we can spend 
                    more time together.

      Off Scottie s frustration.
