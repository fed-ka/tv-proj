      Inside the villa, candles are set up near the bed.  An empty 
      bottle of good champagne rests in an ice bath; two half-
      filled glasses nearby.  An expensive dress, high heels and 
      silk lingerie have been tossed on the floor in the heat of 
      passion.  The body of CLAIRE WOLCOTT lies naked under a blood-
      soaked silk sheet on the bed, as if asleep.  The adjacent 
      pillow is dented, by someone else s head, presumably.  A door 
      to a patio is half open.

      A UNIFORM COP stands by.

                      twenty-four AM, the night staff and 
                    a few guests heard three gunshots.  
                    Nobody could tell from where 
                    exactly.  Fifteen, twenty minutes 
                    later, hotel staff checked the room 
                    and called 911.

                    Boom.  Found a shell.

      With a pen, Rigsby picks up a shell casing across the room 
      from the bed and inspects it.

      Rigsby s outside the door talking with a hotel manager -

      Paul Fricke is being questioned by Lisbon, Jane and Van Pelt.  
      He seems quite calm given the situation.

                    It was a cold night.  So we lit a 
                    fire and made love on the rug 
                    there.  We went to sleep 
                      afterwards.  Then suddenly there s 
                    like a sharp pain, and bang I wake 
                    up and there s blood everywhere and

                    you.

      Fricke shrugs modestly.  Yup.

                    I didn t, really.  I met her a few 
                    weeks ago.  She was at a bar and I 
                    picked her up.  Since then I ve

                                  FRICKE
                      Sometimes.  When I need to.  

                                  VAN PELT
                    Did you take money from Claire 
                    Wolcott?

                                  FRICKE
                    No.  Like I say, I was fond of 
                    Claire.  I planned to keep seeing 
                    her.  You really only want to 
                    monetize as an exit strategy. 

                                  JANE
                    Paul, is your mother still alive?

      Fricke is a degree chillier when talking to a man.

                                  FRICKE
                    I know where you re going with 
                    this, Dr. Freud.  And you re wrong. 
                    My mom s dead, as it goes, but I 
                    loved her dearly.  And she loved me.

                                  JANE
                    Who said anything about your 
                    mother?

                                  FRICKE
                    You just did.

                                  JANE
                    No I didn t.  

                                  FRICKE
                          (irked)
                    Yes you did.

      Jane laughs and gives Fricke a semi-gentle slap on the arm. 

                                  JANE
                    I m playing with you, Paul.

      Fricke s irritated and off balance, as Jane planned.  

                                  FRICKE
                    Are we done here?

      Jane leans in across from Fricke and gets up close in his 
      face.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE MENTALIST      "Crimson Casanova"     GOLD 12/09/08     10.

                                  FRICKE
                    No. 

      Jane looks to Lisbon.

                                  JANE
                      Interesting.  He s either a 
                    habitual liar telling the truth, or 
                    an honest man lying.

      Fricke thinks twice about committing himself to a reply.

                                  LISBON
                    D you keep records?  Of your pick 
                    ups?

                                  FRICKE
                    Of course.

                                  FRICKE
                    Sure.  You think maybe this was a 
                    jealous ex-lover?

                                  JANE
                    Could be.

      Fricke s actually kind of pleased and flattered by the 
      notion.

                                  FRICKE
                    Wow.   


      KEITH WOLCOTT, 38 -- super entitled banker.  Tucked-in pique 
      polo, driving loafers, golf tan -- enters the CBI carrying a 
      paper bag.  Greeted by Lisbon with the slight degree of 
      deference due to a super rich and well connected man. 

                                  LISBON
                    Thank you for coming in, Mr. 
                    Wolcott.  I m sorry for your loss.

      Wolcott hands the bag to Lisbon.

                    We ll return them as soon as 
                    possible.

      Wolcott makes a small but definite `whatever  gesture.   

                                    WOLCOTT
                    I was upstairs speaking with my 
                    friend the attorney general.  I 
                    told him I will not rest until I 
                    see the man who did this brought to 
                    justice.  I will not rest.  I know 
                    I can expect the same from you and 
                    your people.  

      Lisbon doesn t like being pushed.

                                  CHO
                    When did you speak to your wife 
                    last?

                                    WOLCOTT
                    I was in San Francisco for a 
                    business dinner.  I called Claire 
                    around mid-day to tell her I d  
                    probably be staying in town that 
                    night. 

                                  CHO
                    Did you?  Stay the night in town?

                                    WOLCOTT
                    I did.

                                  CHO
                    Did she say where she was going, or 
                    who she was meeting?

                                    WOLCOTT
                    No.  But I didn t ask.

                                  CHO
                    So you didn t know she was at the 
                    spa. 

                                    WOLCOTT
                      I wouldn t expect to know.  She 
                    often went up there on a whim.    

                                  CHO
                    Can you think of anyone who held a 
                    grudge against her?  

                                    WOLCOTT
                    No.  She was, she was harmless. 

                                  CHO
                    Any friends or family that might be

                                    WOLCOTT
                    She s from back east.  She doesn t 
                    have friends or family out here.
                    She shopped and played tennis and 
                    went to spas.  No-one had motive

                    Yes.  The local authorities told me 
                    they suspected as much.  

                                  CHO
                    Did you know she had a lover?

                                    WOLCOTT
                    No.  Do you have a name?  Is he a

                                  CHO 
                    We have a name.  He s not a

      looking closely at her, studying her micro-expressions, 
      change in pulse, and subtle eye movements.  After a couple of 
      passes and stopping and starting, he hovers over a mid-range

                    That was a garbage charge anyhow.

                    Think this through, Natalie.  We re 
                      investigating murder.  If you have 
                    an explanation for these that 
                    doesn t involve killing her?  You 
                    should tell us.  Get yourself off 
                    the hook.

      Natalie sees his point.

                                    NATALIE
                    I thought if I threatened to tell 
                    her husband about her affair, she d 
                    drop the theft charges.  That s 
                    what the pictures were for.

                    How did you know Claire was having 
                    an affair?

                                    NATALIE
                    It was obvious.  She kept sending 
                    me out to buy men s gifts.  You 
                    know, like watches.  Ties.  I knew 
                    they weren t for Keith.  I m not an 
                    idiot.

                                  CHO
                    What did Claire say when you 
                      confronted her about it?

                                    NATALIE
                    I didn t confront her.  Claire left 
                    with that flugly guy before I got 
                    the chance.
                          (beat)
                    It probably wouldn t have worked 
                    anyway.

                    Why not?

                                    NATALIE
                    Because Keith Wolcott is, like, 
                    super controlling.  Especially with 
                    money.  He probably knew all along 
                    his wife was sleeping around.

                    They have an excellent restaurant 
                    here.  Worth the drive.

      Jane goes to the glass patio door, opens it, steps outside to 
      the patio.  Shuts the door, then finds that it can t be 
      opened from outside.  He gestures to Rigsby, who opens the 
      door for him.

      Dark leather chairs.  An upscale cigar room.  We find Wolcott 
      with a bunch of hedge fund types in tuxedos and black bow-
      ties enjoying fine Scotch being served by a white jacketed 
      servant.

      They all laugh merrily.  

      ON Jane and Rigsby approaching.  They glance at each other 
      off the laughter...

      Wolcott takes a beat to realize it s the CBI.  Frowns as he 
      heads over to cut them off.

                    Now is not a good time.

                    This won t take long.

                    hundred thousand dollars your wife

      sheepish faces and move off.  Wolcott stalks back to Jane.

      FADE IN:


      Lisbon enters, pissed off; stands over Jane, who lies on his 
      sofa, relaxed.

                                  JANE
                    What?

                                  LISBON
                    You know damn well what. 
                    You assaulted a man.

                                  JANE
                    I only tweaked his nose.  

                                  LISBON
                    That s assault, technically.

                                  JANE
                      Technically, he s an ass.          
                    He deserved it. 

                                  LISBON
                    Yes he is.  But this is not a 
                    school yard.  You simply can t do 
                    stuff like that.  

                                  JANE 
                    Yes I can.  I did.  The seas didn t 
                    boil.  The sky didn t fall.       

                                  LISBON 
                    It will shortly.  Wolcott s on his 
                    way down here with a thousand 
                    dollar an hour lawyer.  If you make 
                    a formal apology to him, he s 
                    willing to think about dropping the 
                    matter.

                                  JANE
                    Hmmm, let me think.  No.

                                  LISBON
                    Oh come on, be reasonable for once.

                                  JANE
                    I m busy.

                                  LISBON
                    Right.

                    I am.  I m thinking.  He s going to 
                    drop the matter in any case. 

                                  LISBON
                    Oh really?

                                  JANE
                      I guarantee it.  He s a shallow 
                      narcissist.  All about image.  And 
                    this whole business makes him look 
                    small and silly.    

      He closes his eyes as if going back to sleep.  Lisbon simmers 
      impotently a beat, then tweaks Jane s nose and walks away. 
      Jane smiles to himself. 


      Lisbon, behind her desk.  Wolcott and his LAWYER sitting 
      opposite, glowering.

                          (rueful)
                    I m sorry.  My colleague, Mr. Jane 
                    refuses to apologize, says he s 
                    happy to go to court.  And you 
                    refuse to talk to us, so we can t 
                    rule you out as a suspect. 
                    I m afraid this is going to make a 
                    bit of a mess.  

      Wolcott blows air, looks at his Lawyer, takes a beat.

                                  LAWYER
                    Keith, I suggest --

                                    WOLCOTT
                    -- No no.  I have nothing to hide.  
                    What do you want to know? 

                                  LISBON

                    with this Fricke person.  I knew 
                    about the money she was giving him.

                    Why did you deny knowing?

                    suspect, which would be tedious. 

                                  LISBON
                    Did you confront her about Fricke?

                                    WOLCOTT
                    No.  I stopped the check 
                      immediately of course.

                                  LISBON

                    Not at all.  I was happy.  I d 
                    wanted to divorce her for ages.

                                  LISBON
                    Why?

                          (shrugs)
                    She d become irritating.  The cost 
                    of divorce always deterred me.  But 
                    her infidelity with Fricke cut the 
                    payout she d get in half.  
                    If Claire had lived, come Monday, 
                    she was in for a nasty surprise. 
                    I was all set to serve her divorce 
                    papers.

      Fricke enters laughing merrily with Van Pelt.  Rigsby in tow, 
      miserable.  Wolcott leaving, crosses paths with them.  Both 
      men pause momentarily and wonder what to say, then move on.

                    You misled us Paul.  You were going

                    But I didn t.  Did I?  A business 
                    associate of mine is opening a new 
                    club in town.  He offered me a role 
                    as partial owner if I could come up 
                    with a share of the building costs.  
                    Claire was generous enough to offer 
                    me a loan.   

                                  CHO
                    And?

                    days ago, and was told the check

                    That must have been disappointing.

                    She said it must be a mistake and 
                    she d sort it out Monday.

                    Did you believe her?

      Cho eyes Fricke carefully.

                                  FRICKE 
                    No big deal.  You know what the 
                    best part about being me is?  There 
                    are literally dozens of rich, needy 
                    women I could go to for financial 
                    help.  I didn t need Claire s 
                    money.

      Jane walks in, interrupting.

                                  JANE
                    Hey.  What s the story with you and 
                    Katie?  The waitress.

                                  CHO
                    Hello, in the middle here...

                                  JANE 
                    Yes, sorry.  I was thinking. 
                    I had a thought.  Bear with me.  
                          (to Fricke)
                    So, Katie, tell me about her. 

                                  FRICKE
                    Nothing to tell.  Used to be if I 
                    didn t score for whatever reason, 
                    I d call her off the bench.

                                  JANE 
                    Can t sleep alone uh?

                                  FRICKE
                    Some people use cocoa and a good 
                    book, I use beautiful women.

                                  JANE
                    She must have been crazy about you, 
                    to put up with a deal like that.

                                  FRICKE
                    I guess so.

                                  JANE
                    Must be difficult for her now.

                    Of course it is.  She loves you.  
                    That much is clear.  Maybe that s 
                    what all this was about?  Your 
                    behavior finally got to her?

      Fricke shifts in his seat.  Not enjoying this.

                                  FRICKE
                    Katie didn t have anything to do 
                    with this.

                                  JANE
                    How can you be so sure?

      Fricke grows concerned.  His slick exterior momentarily 
      disappears.

                                  FRICKE
                    I know Katie.  She s a good person.  
                    She wouldn t hurt anyone.

      Jane studies Fricke for a beat.

                                  JANE
                    Okay, great.  Thanks.  You can go.

                    I m sorry.  When Agent Cho says you 
                    can go, you can go.

      Jane exits.  Fricke looks to Cho.

                                  CHO
                    One moment.

      He follows Jane out...


      Jane and Cho walk from the interrogation room to the 
      bullpen...

      He hustles Cho along with him.


      MUSIC PLAYS as Cho strides into the crowded lounge.  His hair 
      is spiked, he's wearing flashy clothes, some bling, and his 
      sunglasses are on inside.  

      Cho's peacocking -- a Venusian technique used to grab the 
      attention of women and instigate conversation.  Groups of 
      people, men and women alike, can t help but turn his way.

      FADE IN:


      Cho s at the bar.  Surveying the crowded lounge.  He checks 
      to make sure no one s looking and speaks to himself.

                                  CHO
                    I m in position.   


      REVEAL -- Jane s behind a bank of SURVEILLANCE MONITORS set 
      up in one of the resort suites.  A receiver and microphone 
      are on the desk.  Lisbon, Rigsby and Van Pelt behind him.

                                  JANE
                    Look around, choose a likely 
                    target.


      Back with Cho, who we now see is wearing a small earpiece and 
      microphone discretely hidden among his many accessories.

                                  CHO
                    Will do, hey... 

      This last to the bartender who was watching Cho talk to 
      himself.

                                  CHO (CONT D)
                    Bourbon on the rocks.  Make it a 
                    double.

      Cho s POV -- A NEARBY TABLE where TWO WOMEN are downing 
      mojitos.  They look back at Cho, sizing him up.

      The MOJITO LADIES, DARBY and SARA-BETH, look at each other.  
      The bartender brings Cho his drink.

                    Start a tab for me, would you?  
                    Room 206.  That s for you.

      He puts a fifty dollar bill in the bartender s vest pocket 
      and goes to the Mojito ladies  table, sits down.

      Fricke chats up three captivated women in the lounge.  The 
      whole group is laughing.

      ANGLE -- Katie s at the bar, watching Fricke.


                                  RIGSBY
                    I give up.  I do not understand

                    they like it.

                                  VAN PELT
                    They re drunk women.  You can t 
                      generalize to all women in general.

                    No?  You went for Fricke s line  
                    the same way.  Like a mackerel.

                    Shut up.  I did not.

      Lisbon gives Jane an accusatory look.

      Jane smiles at Rigsby and Van Pelt now ignoring each other.


      The crowd has thinned out.  Fricke is slow dancing with one 
      of his three blondes.  Cho s deep in intimate conversation 
      with the Mojito Ladies.

      Haightly, the manager, enters, approaches Katie as she gazes 
      wistfully at Fricke.

      Katie undoes the apron around her waist and heads for the 
      bar.  Haightly watches her go.


      Rigsby s trying not to fall asleep on the bed.  Van Pelt and 
      Jane watching the monitors.  Lisbon s catching up on 
      paperwork.

      and she stands up indignantly.  They march out in unison, 
      watched by Katie and Fricke and Haightly and other occupants, 
      amused...


      Jane and the team laughing, except for Van Pelt...

                                  VAN PELT
                    What did he say?  I didn t hear.

                                  JANE
                    You don t want to know.


      Cho gets up and goes to the bar, sits a couple of stools down 
      from Katie.  

                                  CHO
                    Oh well.

                                  CHO
                    I blew it.  As usual.  I m just 
                    unlucky in love.  Always have been.   
                    When I do find someone, they break 
                    my heart every time.

                                  KATIE
                    I know how that goes.

      Katie looks at Fricke, Cho follows her gaze to Fricke.

                    No offense, but I ve been watching 
                    him operate this evening, and he 
                    seems like kind of a creep. A 
                    player no doubt, but a creep. 

                                  KATIE
                    This isn t who he is.  When we were 
                    together, he was a sweet, caring 
                    generous man.  It was me that 
                    screwed it up.  We had a terrible 
                    fight.  I said some mean things.  
                    Mean things.  This is all an 
                    attempt to prove me wrong I guess.

                                  CHO 
                    Eh.  If I had a woman like you in 
                    love with me, you could say 
                    whatever you like.  I wouldn t be 
                    out running around.

                                  KATIE
                    That s nice of you to say so.  
                    Thank you.

                                  CHO
                    You know what you need to do? 
                    You need to make him jealous.  
                    Let him see you out and about, 
                    enjoying yourself with another man.

      Katie gives Cho a look.

                                  KATIE
                    Are you hitting on me?

                    Yes I am.  But it s a good plan, 
                    isn t it?  

      Katie smiles...


      Jane, Lisbon, Rigsby and Van Pelt watch ON SCREEN as Katie 
      and Cho hit it off in the lounge.

                                  JANE
                    He s a natural.


      Cho leans in closer to Katie, whilst gesturing for the tab.

      Katie sees Fricke across the room, surrounded by the group of 
      three women, one of them sitting on his lap.

                                  KATIE 
                    Sure.  Let s do it.

      Cho takes Katie by the arm and leads her laughing and smiling 
      past Fricke, who watches them go.  He frowns.


      Cho and Katie crossing the room, still laughing, touching. 
      They just seem to naturally keep walking to the stairs and up 
      toward the guest rooms.


      Cho and Katie giggling along a hallway.  Round a corner.  


      Jane et al watching. 

      ON A SCREEN -- THE SECURITY CAMERA FEED -- Cho and Katie 
      appear, Cho unlocks a room.  They disappear inside.  


      Cho and Katie enter the room, Cho first.  As soon as they re

      Jane et al watching the monitors.  Attentive but restless.

      This to Rigsby and Van Pelt.  In BG A DARK FIGURE MOVES 
      ACROSS A MONITOR SCREEN and disappears.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Not touching that.

      Then suddenly the DARK FIGURE reappears, up close, and we see 
      it s a man in A LONG DARK RAINCOAT AND A BLACK HAT, obscuring 
      his face.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Holy...


      The FIGURE moves swiftly down a long hallway to room 206.  

      He pulls a gun from his waist, and opens the door with a 
      security pass key.  

      He steps inside, only to find it's not Cho and Katie inside; 
      it's Rigsby, Lisbon and Van Pelt waiting with guns drawn.

                                  LISBON

      Rigsby comes back inside and helps Van Pelt pack up equipment 
      in BG.  On sofa, Jane and Lisbon talk with handcuffed 
      Haightly.

      Jane holds up the security pass card that Haightly used to 
      get into the room.

                                  CHO
                    No it s not.  You should seek 
                      psychiatric help.

      Katie laughs.


      Jane sits alone at the bar, nursing a drink.  The crowd has 
      thinned out for the night.  Only a few stragglers remain, 
      including Fricke, who enters from the patio with one of his 
      women, an empty look on his face.

      Fricke sees Jane at the bar and approaches alone.

                                  FRICKE
                    You mind?

      Fricke sits.  He has a heaviness about him, a seriousness.

                                  JANE
                    Rough night?

                                  FRICKE
                    Eh, not bad.  A couple of good 
                    phone numbers. 

      Jane and Fricke sit quiet for a beat.  Then Katie enters from 
      across the room.  Jane sees her, and a moment later Fricke 
      does as well.  In that moment, Fricke lights up.  But he 
        determinedly looks away.  

                                  FRICKE (CONT D)
                    Yup.  Two very tasty numbers...

      Jane calmly pours his drink on Fricke s head. 

                                  JANE 
                    Don t be so bloody stupid.  You 
                    have a good woman there.  That 
                    knows you and loves you.       

      Fricke stares at him for a beat, dripping.  Shocked.  Then he 
      slides out from the bar and heads over to Katie, who watches 
      nervously as he approaches.  Not sure what he wants with her.  
      After a few awkward beats, he reaches down and takes her 
      hand, leading her out.

      A beat on Jane, introspective.  He pays no attention to Katie 
      and Fricke. 

                                    WOMAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Excuse me.

      Jane turns to see a stunning woman before him.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE MENTALIST      "Crimson Casanova"     GOLD 12/09/08     55.

                                  WOMAN
                    You looked kind of lonely. 
                    My friend and I were wondering if 
                    you d like to join us?

      Across the room, the other woman waves from her table.     
      Jane shows her his wedding ring.

                                  JANE
                    Sorry.  Married.

      He turns back to the bar, takes a shot of his drink.

                                                                          FADE OUT.
