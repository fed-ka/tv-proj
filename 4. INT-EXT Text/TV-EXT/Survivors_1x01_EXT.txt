      A few days later. ABBY walks towards a department store in 
      a busy shopping centre. She dials quickly on her mobile and 
      smiles as the call connects.

    She tries to sound as bright as she can.

    The school is a typical inner city mixture of single storey 
      pre-fabricated buildings. Standing in the playground is 
      JENNY WALSH, 24. She is very pretty, with a sweet, 
      sympathetic manner. At her side is TINA STYLES, 7, who 
      carries her rucksack on her back. 

                                  JENNY
                    Don t worry, Tina. She ll be here 
                    in a minute.

                    A lot of people are ill.

                                  TINA
                    You re not.

                                  JENNY
                    Neither are you. We re lucky, 
                    aren t we?

      Suddenly JENNY sees a man running towards them. 

                                  TINA
                    Daddy!

    He scoops his daughter up in his arms. She feels his face.

                    You re hot!

      JENNY can see he is ill. He avoids her gaze.

                    think it s best if the children 
                    stay at home for a few days.

      TINA waves goodbye and JENNY waves back. MARION STURGES 
      (50) the Head Teacher, comes to stand at Jenny s side.

                                  MARION

                    two thirds today. It s very

    She looks exhausted. JENNY looks at her with concern.

      DAVID wedges his car in front of the next in line and jumps 
      out. The driver already waiting looks at him in outraged 
      protest. DAVID holds out his hands in apology.

                                  DAVID
                    Sorry, mate... it s urgent...

                    everyone else...

      DAVID takes out his wallet and offers the man a  20 note.

    He lands a clumsy punch on DAVID, who pushes him away. 
      Other DRIVERS rush over to intervene.

                    He s a bloody queue jumper...

    The other drivers, exasperated by the long wait, also turn 
    on David. He lashes out angrily, still clinging to the 
      pump, and gets thumped for his trouble.

    The confrontation turns into a full on scrap, though with 
      more pushing and shoving than real fighting.

      ABBY watches in horror. Then, from her POV, we see the 
      whole scene go briefly out of focus. She staggers, 
      clutching at her head, sweat pouring down her face. 

                                  ABBY
                    David? David!

    He looks across as she suddenly collapses against the car. 
      Horrified, he drags himself away from the fight and rushes 
      across to her. The other drivers stand and watch, not sure 
    how to respond. Abby is conscious but very woozy. 

                                  DAVID

                    I ve got the bug. I m so hot. My 
                    head feels as though it s about 
                    to explode. 

                                  DAVID

      DAVID looks at her, horribly torn.

                    We ll go home, get you a doctor. 
                    Then I ll come back for Peter...

      ABBY is too weak and groggy to argue. He picks her up and 
      puts her back as gently as he can in the car, then runs 
      around to the other side. The other drivers look on in 
      silence.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      JENNY emerges from the house with PAT leaning heavily 
      against her, wrapped up in a raincoat.

                    Okay?

    PAT nods, though she looks awful. JENNY guides her into the 
      street. She stops to look around in amazement. The street 
    is in chaos, with cars bumper to bumper. There is shouting 
    and confusion everywhere. The traffic lights have failed 
    and many of the drivers are out of their cars. A police car 
      pulls out of a junction, its siren blaring and immediately 
      grinds to a halt in the logjam. A POLICEMAN jumps out and 
      tries to direct the passenger traffic to the side of the 
      road but there is nowhere for anyone to go. 

                                                                          CUT TO:



      JENNY helps PAT along the high street. She stops in 
      amazement as she sees a gang of KIDS hurl bricks through 
    the windows of a shop and reach in to help themselves to 
      plasma TVs, and other electronic goods. The kids scatter, 
      expensive hardware smashing to the ground as they run. 

      JENNY drags PAT to the station but a temporary sign reads: 
       Trams suspended until further notice.  JENNY nearly cries 
    in dismay, but looks at PAT desperately.

                                  JENNY
                    You have to walk, Pat. Please. 
                    It s not far.

    PAT looks at her, barely registering what she is saying but 
      somehow putting one foot in front of another.

      NAJID, 11, a young boy of Pakistani extraction, stands in 
    the road looking around in wonder as a crowd of neighbours
    and friends from the Muslim community walk past. There are 
      a few murmured greetings but the mood is sombre; many 
      people are supported by their friends and family, while one 
    man is carried on an improvised stretcher. They move 
      forward with a common purpose, their torches glimmering in 
    the darkness.

      NAJID has never seen anything like this. The strangeness of 
    it is overwhelming; he bumps into someone in the darkness, 
      earning an angry rebuke.

                                  MAN
                    Watch where you re going! 

      NAJID turns in the crowd, lost for a second, then sees his 
      father up ahead. He runs to catch up. His MOTHER leans on 
    his FATHER s shoulder, wiping her forehead with the sleeve 
    of her dress. His FATHER turns to him with a tired smile.

    His father gives NAJID his copy of the Koran and places a

      NAJID hurries to catch up with his mother, who has moved 
      ahead.

                                                                          CUT TO:



    The streets are now hauntingly still. Nothing moves and 
      there is no sound beyond a whining car alarm.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      A huge housing estate in an inner city area. Suddenly the 
      lights go out from block to block as though someone is 
      snuffing candles. The area is plunged into darkness. 

                                                                          CUT TO:



    The city viewed from the air, its lights illuminating the 
    sky for miles around. Darkness steals over the landscape as 
    the power fails in area after area. In a few seconds the 
      whole city disappears as though someone has thrown a 
      blanket over it. 

    As the lights go out below, the moon seems to glow ever 
      brighter and the stars appear for the first time, shining 
      with indifferent prettiness.

                                                                          CUT TO:

      A poignantlylovely sunrise. Golden light filters over a 
      series of images of the desolate new reality of the disease 
      ravaged country -

      - roads stand silent, blocked with cars. Nothing moves.

      - houses stand quiet. There is little visible sign of the 
      horror, but we know that within each home lies the same 
      terrible story. 

      - cows stand in a field, lowing plaintively to be milked.

    - a shopping mall is eerily deserted.

    - a huge football stadium stands empty.

    - a dog sits in the back of a locked car, barking 
      frantically for an owner who will never come.

                                                                        FADE TO:



    AL hurls the car into the street from the underground car 
      park but immediately has to brake. A van has been left 
      blocking the road. It is freakishly silent. No cars, no 
      trains, no planes, none of the normal, comforting chaos of 
    the rush hour. AL opens his door and stares around.

      Seeing someone in the van he hurries over and bangs on the 
      window.

                                  AL
                    Hey! What s going on? Where is 
                    everybody?

      There is no response. Fear prickles at AL s skin. He flings 
      open the door and grabs the driver s arm.

                                  AL
                    Didn t you hear me..?

    The DRIVER slumps half-out of his cab. AL jumps back in 
      horror.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      NAJID emerges into the sunlight. He is used to the vibrant 
      urgency of a busy working class area, the crush of people, 
    the laughter and shouting, the everyday life he takes for 
      granted. But that is all gone now, vanished as though swept 
      away in a conjurer s trick. Empty of people, completely 
      silent, the street looks like an alien world. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

      NAJID walks along the balcony towards his flat. He stops to 
      stare out. The normally busy estate is completely silent.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      ANYA walks out into the empty forecourt. It is a pleasant 
      afternoon, a gentle breeze blowing. She takes off her 
      doctor s white coat and lets it flutter to the ground. 

                                                                          CUT TO:



    Day fades once more into night. Litter blows down deserted 
      streets.

      There is no one to be seen and nothing moves. The silence 
    and emptiness of the once busy city are haunting. In a 
      brief series of shots we see the sun sink and then rise 
      again. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

      ANYA walks down the street, her bag slung over her 
      shoulder. Suddenly she hears the roar of a car engine and 
      turns to look behind her. A car is speeding towards her on 
    the wrong side of the road. It is a Police patrol car, its 
      blue light flashing and siren wailing. She stops and leaps 
      out, waving her arms. 

                                  ANYA
                    Hey!

    The car doesn t even brake, but actually mounts the 
      pavement and heads straight for her forcing her to fling 
      herself against the wall. The driver is a a young man in a 
      hooded jacket.

      There is a mad grin on his face and he gives ANYA the 
      finger as he goes past. ANYA stares after him in disbelief. 
    Is this what the world is going to be like now?

                                                                          CUT TO:



      ANYA walks down by the canal as the light begins to fade. 
      Barges are moored to the side. ANYA suddenly knows she 
      doesn t want to go any further tonight; in any case, she 
    has nowhere particular to go. She sees a gaily painted 
      barge and hops onto it. Out of habit she knocks on the 
      door, which is open. Inside, it is mercifully free of 
      bodies. ANYA looks around, then slips inside.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      ANYA sits on the deck, enjoying the last of the sunlight. 
    It is peaceful, even beautiful in the warm evening. She 
      eats a tin of peaches, glancing up as a seabird glides low 
      over the canal before wheeling away gracefully. Although 
      nothing can soften the deadening despair in her heart, for 
      a moment at least she is at peace. She opens her bag and 
      takes out a creased photograph of her, Jenny and Pat in a 
      club somewhere raising their glasses to the camera. She 
      stares at it for a second, then lets it slip from her 
      fingers into the canal. 

                                                                          CUT TO:



      ABBY bangs helplessly on her neighboursdoor. She gets no 
      reply; she tries to look in but the curtains are closed. 

                                  ABBY
                    Joe? Linda?

    She tries the door and finds it open. She goes inside.

                                  ABBY
                    Hello..?

                                                                          CUT TO:

      ABBY dashes back out into the street, overwhelmed by panic. 
    She rushes from house to house, shouting frantically.

                                  ABBY
                    Hello! Please, is anyone there. 
                    Someone please help me.

    She sees an open door and goes into another house, but 
      emerges only seconds later, pale and shocked. She stumbles 
      into the middle of the street, a terrible fear clutching 
      violently at her heart. A desperate plea springs to her 
      lips.

                                  ABBY
                    Oh, God. Please don t let me be 
                    the only one.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      Rubbish blows along the deserted street. TOM PRICE walks 
      casually around the corner, looking for all the world like 
      a man enjoying a simple trip down to the newsagent.He 
      wears new jeans and trainers and a smart jacket. He carries 
      a sports bag. He drinks from a bottle of water as he goes. 

                                                                          CUT TO:



    The patio is only a few yards square and covered with 
      potted plants. PRICE clears the pots out of the way so that 
    he can see the paving underneath. He gets down on his knees 
      holding a hammer and chisel. He begins to chip away at the 
      cement until he can move the heavy paving stone to one 
      side. The space underneath it is hollow. He reaches down 
    and brings out a rucksack wrapped in plastic. He throws the 
      protective covering to one side and opens the bag. Inside 
    we see many thousands of pounds.

      PRICE gazes at the money, then opens a side pocket and 
      brings out a handgun. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

      ABBY drags David s body out into the garden. The blanket 
      covering his face falls away and the blankness of his 
      expression nearly overwhelms her. She half slips to the 
      ground as a wrenching sob racks her body. 

                                                                          CUT TO:



      ABBY splashes paraffin over the unseen David s body, then 
      takes a match from a packet. She looks up briefly, her 
      voice cracking.

                                  ABBY
                    I have to find Peter now. I ll 
                    look after him. I promise.

    Her hands shake so violently she can barely strike the 
      match on the side of the packet. It flares for a second 
      then fizzles out. ABBY cries in despair, then tries again, 
      striking match after match until finally the fire bursts 
      into life. She has to turn away quickly as she is scorched 
    by the sudden ferocity of the blaze. 

                                                                          CUT TO:



      ABBY sticks a handwritten sign on the door. It reads 
      simply:  Peter - I Can t Stay Here. Wherever You Are, I ll 
      Find You. Mum 

    She closes the door and walks down the path, clutching a 
    bag in one hand and her mobile in the other. She pauses, 
      glancing back once at the column of smoke rising from the 
      garden. She hesitates, her heart breaking, but then forces 
      herself to leave behind everything she has ever known and 
      loved. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

    AL drives around the silent streets. He looks a little 
      crazed, and swigs from the bottle of champagne. He looks 
      around for signs of life but nothing moves. 

                                                                          CUT TO:



      NAJID walks down the street, shifting a heavy bag from hand 
    to hand and kicking a football in front of him. He is a 
      lonely but determined figure.

                                                                          CUT TO:



    The city streets stand empty. It is a slate wiped clean of 
      life, devoid of its reason for existence. We see shining 
      urban landmarks, serene and haunting in their emptiness.

      After a moment AL s powerful sports car surges down the 
      road. He drives fast, looking around for signs of life, the 
      champagne bottle still in one hand. 

                                                                          CUT TO:



      NAJID plays football in the silent street. He kicks the 
      ball against the glass wall of an office building. He stops 
      suddenly as he hears a car approaching fast. He dashes out 
      into the street.

                                                                          CUT TO:



    AL accelerates, glancing out of the side window as he scans 
    the streets, his attention briefly off the road ahead...

    ... and then suddenly sees the football in the road and 
      NAJID standing right behind it.

    The surprise makes him veer wildly across the road, sending 
    the car into a skid before he can bring it under control 
    and brake. 





                                                                            (CONTINUED)

    He gets out of the car and stands shaking with shock. He 
      looks up at NAJID. They stare at each other. It is hard to 
    say which of them is more surprised. 

                                  AL
                    What the hell are you doing?

                    I could have crashed. Do you know 
                    what this car cost? Ninety grand. 

      NAJID only stares at him. AL shakes his head.

                                  AL
                    You don t play football in the 
                    road. Didn t your parents teach 
                    you anything?

      NAJID collects his football from where it has rolled into 
    the gutter.

                                  NAJID
                    Sorry. 

    The two of them look at each other.

                    Where are you going, anyway?

                    To find my cousins in Blackburn.

                    You reckon?

    AL looks out over the deserted city with as much optimism 
    as he can muster.

                                  AL
                    Yeah, probably. (Pause) I d take 
                    you with me but it s complicated.

                                  NAJID
                    I wasn t asking.

    He picks up his bag and turns away. AL looks after him 
      guiltily.

                                  AL
                    I wouldn t know how to look after 
                    a little boy. I m not really the 
                    parental type.

                    I m not little. I m eleven. 

    AL shrugs then goes back to his car. He drives away. NAJID 
      watches him, his little face blank.

                                                                          CUT TO:

      ANYA leaves the barge almost reluctantly. She knows she 
      must move on but the peaceful canal was a momentary respite 
      from the uncertain horror of the future. She steps down 
      onto the embankment, slings her bag back over her shoulder 
    and moves on.

                                                                          CUT TO:

      After the strange, disorienting silence of the city, the 
      majestic beauty of the countryside comes as a breath of 
      fresh air. A car makes its way through the countryside, 
      winding up a solitary road through the Peak district. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

    The pub stands in a scenic spot overlooking the valley. A 
      single car sits in the car park. ABBY drives in and gets 
      out. She stares at the other car. A WOMAN DRIVER sits at 
    the wheel. ABBY hurries across to her.

                                  ABBY
                    Can you help me, please? I ve run 
                    out of petrol.

      Only now does she realisethat the woman is dead.

      ABBY gazes at her, then forcing herself to open the door, 
    she puts her hands under her arms and drags her out, laying 
    her gently on the gravel. She gazes at the young woman s 
      body sadly.

                                  ABBY
                    I m sorry.

    She walks quickly back to her own car, taking out her bag 
    and a few other essentials.

    TOM PRICE walks at a leisurely pace, his bag over his 
      shoulder. He tries a few cars but finds them all locked. He 
      sees a handsome sports car in a drive. He is just sizing it 
    up when an estate car appears around the corner of the 
      road. It goes past him but then stops. The window winds 
      down and NEIL looks out with a friendly smile.

    He is young, no more than 20 or so. At his side is CATHY 
    who is a year younger. She has a fixed, glassy look.

      story as his own. NEIL smiles sympathetically, then follows 
      PRICE S glance at Cathy.

                    in a kids playground, just 
                    sitting on a swing. 

    He thinks for a second, then, then suddenly decides.

                    You re welcome to ride along with 
                    us, if you want.

      PRICE glances down. CATHY s coat has fallen open and her 
      short skirt reveals a lot of leg. PRICE takes in the sight, 
      then looks up at NEIL with a charming smile.

      age, with long hair and windblown features. It is easy to 
      guess that he has lived much of his life outdoors.

                    all this?

    He sweeps an arm in the direction of the silent houses.

                                  NAJID
                    Of course I do.

    AL ambles back to his car.



    AL and NAJID walk along in sullen silence carrying their 
      bags.

    He looks away petulantly.

                                  NAJID
                    My dad would know what to do.

      NAJID looks at him, hurt. AL feels guilty.

                    Alright, we ll find another car

      ANYA walks through the deserted streets. She hardly seems 
    to know where she s going, but just moves forward at a 
      steady pace staring straight ahead.

                                                                          CUT TO:



    TOM PRICE and CATHY wait by the car outside the shop. NEIL 
      emerges carrying a box full of groceries. He dumps it in 
    the back of the car. CATHY looks at everything anxiously.

                                  CATHY
                    There s such a lot. Can we afford 
                    all this, Neil?

    He exchanges a quick glance with PRICE then looks back at 
      her, his voice gentle.

                                  NEIL
                    Course we can. 

    She nods, her pretty face clouding with the struggle of 
      understanding what has happened to them. NEIL smiles 
      encouragingly.

                                  NEIL
                    Just a couple more things.

      NEIL goes back inside the shop. CATHY leans into the car 
      trying to push the heavy box to one side to make more room. 
    Her skirt stretches up her legs as she does it. TOM PRICE 
      watches her. She looks round and he smiles.

                                  PRICE
                    I ve got it.

    He leans in next to her and pushes the box into place, they 
    are only a few inches apart. He smiles.

                                  PRICE
                    You look nice in that dress. It 
                    suits you. You ve got good legs. 

    She bites her lip but says nothing. 

                                  PRICE
                    Who did you lose? Husband? Kids? 
                    (Pause) Did you hear what I said?

    She nods.

                                  PRICE
                    Good. I was beginning to think 
                    you were a bit simple. (Pause) I 
                    know it seems bad now but you ll 
                    be okay. We ve all got to look 
                    after each other.

    He strokes her cheek gently with his finger. It is barely 
      more than a touch but the effect is electrifying. CATHY 
      screams as though she has been stabbed. PRICE stares in 
      disbelief.

                                  PRICE
                    For God s sake, shut up...

    He grabs her roughly, which only makes her scream more. 
      NEIL comes running out of the shop.

                                  NEIL
                    What happened? 

                                  PRICE
                    She just started screaming. 

      CATHY is crying and shaking. NEIL takes her in his arms and 
    she lets him hold her. 

                                  NEIL
                    It s okay. You re all right. 

    He looks accusingly at PRICE, who shrugs innocently. 

                                  PRICE
                    We were just talking. 

                                                                          CUT TO:



    At the same moment ABBY drives aggressively through the 
      empty streets. Nothing is going to stop her finding her 
      son. She drives into the hospital entrance, picking a way 
      through the litter of abandoned cars and ambulances. She 
      stops near A&E and jumps out. The sliding doors are closed. 
    She pushes and pulls at them but with no result. They are 
      firmly locked, clamped in place when the power went off. 
    She scrabbles her fingers into the gap between the doors 
    but with no result. 

    She shouts in frustration and beats on the doors furiously. 
    But she will not be stopped, not now. 





                                                                            (CONTINUED)

    She hesitates, then looks back at the car.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      ABBY sits in the car. She can hardly believe what she is 
      about to do. For a moment she feels like the old Abby 
      standing outside her body and staring at herself in wonder; 
    but that woman, the happy, unassuming home-maker and 
      mother, is gone forever. 

    She takes a deep breath, then stamps on the accelerator and 
      drives the car straight at the entrance.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      GREG opens his car and puts his supplies in the back. The 
    car is a big four wheel drive already well stocked with 
      provisions - canned food, water, matches and tools. Every 
      square inch of luggage space is stuffed with vital 
      commodities. He slides his baseball bat across the 
      passenger seat and gets in. 

                                                                          CUT TO:



      GREG PRESTON is out of his car looking at the damage. He 
      turns to stare at ABBY in disbelief as she emerges, shocked 
    but unhurt. 

                                  GREG
                    What were you doing? You could 
                    have killed us both.

                                  ABBY
                    I m sorry. 

                                  GREG
                    Of all the terrible pieces of 
                    driving...

                                  ABBY
                    I ve said, I m sorry. Is your car 
                    badly damaged?

    He inspects the scrape on the side of his car. 

                                  GREG
                    It s okay. 

    He looks at her in disbelief but by now she has had enough.

                                  ABBY
                    Well, you didn t stop either.

                                  GREG
                    I had right of way. You do know 
                    how to drive, don t you?

                                  ABBY
                    Fine. It was my fault. Do you 
                    want my insurance details?

                                  GREG
                    Is that supposed to be funny?

                    I thought so.

      Suddenly a laugh bubbles up unstoppably in her throat. She 
      can t help it.

    She gulps again, a sound as much like a sob as a laugh and 
    in truth something of both. GREG gazes at her for a second, 
      then he too finally relaxes and begins to laugh as well.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      ABBY and GREG sit together in the middle of the roundabout. 
    He pours her hot tea from a thermos and adds long life 
      milk. She drinks it gratefully.

                    I never really appreciated how

                    The milk won t last long. I ll

                    Is that what you re going to do? 
                    Find a farm?

                                  ABBY
                    You make it sound quite nice.

                                  GREG
                    You can t stay in the city. It s

                    come with millions of unburied 
                    bodies. In a few months these 
                    places will be hell.

    She looks at him. She had barely even thought about it. He 
      stands up and throws away the remains of his tea.

                    I want to keep moving.

    He gets up, then hesitates, looking back at her dazed and 
      uncertain expression.

                                  GREG
                    You have to live, you know. 
                    (Pause) You owe it to the people 
                    you loved to keep going. That s

    She stares at him and nods slowly. 

                                  ABBY
                    If I recovered, maybe my son did 
                    too. Maybe he s out there

                    You really think he might be

                    Miracles happen. Even now. 

    As he walks to his car she looks after him wistfully, 
      suddenly appalled at the thought of being alone. He senses 
    it and looks back. 

                                  GREG

                    You re obviously not safe driving 
                    yourself.

                    I m actually a very good driver. 

    He glances at the ruin of her car and smiles.

                                  GREG
                    Yeah. So I see.

                                  ABBY
                    It s a long story. (Pause) I d

                    It s just for now though. I ve 
                    got plans of my own. 

    She nods in acknowledgement of this.

    She smiles, more relieved than she will admit to have some 
      company at the start of the long, strange journey that lies 
      ahead.

      PRICE hurtles out of the speeding car and hits the tarmac 
      with a sickening thump. He rolls over and over and finally 
      lies still. He tries to pull himself up but then falls 
      back, unconscious or dead, as Neil speeds away. 

                                                                          CUT TO:



      GREG and ABBY see a petrol station ahead. GREG points to

                    There might be something we can 
                    use...

    As he gets nearer he sees there is a van parked up by the 
      pumps with a man nearby. He smiles wryly.

                                  GREG
                    There s always a bloody queue.

      ABBY smiles in excitement and is already opening the door 
    and  hurrying towards the forecourtwaving at the VAN 
      DRIVER. 

                                  ABBY
                    Hi...

    We STAY ON GREG. Only now does he see the MAN is using a 
      battery powered pump to extract petrol from the storage 
      tanks 30 feet below the surface. The doors of his van are 
      open, and he is storing huge plastic bottles of fuel in the 
      back. He instantly hurls open his door to follow Abby.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      ABBY hurries onto the forecourt.The MAN backs away, 
      looking protectively at his van.

                                  MAN
                    Back off. This is my petrol.

                                  ABBY
                    Where have you come from? Have 
                    you met anyone else?

    She goes towards him, open and friendly. But the man 
      shrinks back. 

                                  MAN
                    You can have your turn later.

                                  ABBY
                    What?

                                  MAN
                    I was here first...

                                  ABBY
                    You don t understand... 

                                  MAN
                    Get lost.

      ABBY stops in confusion.

                                  ABBY
                    Why are you being like this..?

      Before the man can reply GREG barrels onto the forecourt, 
      shouting desperately.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                    The pump... turn off the pump.

    He points at the pump, which chugs noisily, blue smoke 
      rising from its motor. Petrol leaks where the hose isn t 
      tightly screwed on. 

                                  GREG
                    It s sparking! For God s sake 
                    turn it off! 

    The MAN glances at it but is clearly more suspicious of 
      Greg. 

                                  MAN
                    Keep away...

                                  GREG
                    I don t want your bloody 
                    petrol...

      GREG crashes into ABBY, pushing her to the ground. She 
      cries out in shock but then seconds later a spark catches 
    and a sheet of flame engulfs the van. The man disappears in 
      a billowing wall of fire. GREG shields Abby and covers his 
      head as the ferocious heat sucks the oxygen from the air 
    all around him. 

    As the initial explosion dies down GREG looks up 
      cautiously. Fire sweeps across the forecourtand the van is 
      a charred wreck. The MAN has disappeared completely, 
      evaporated in an instant. GREG realisesit is only a matter 
    of seconds before the blaze reaches the storage tanks. He 
      gets to his feet, grabs ABBY and runs.

                                  GREG
                    It s going to blow.

      Reeling with shock and confusion she rushes after him 
      towards the car.

                                                                          CUT TO:

      ANYA looks up as a car appears in the distance. As it draws 
      closer it slows and then swings into the lay-by. GREG and 
      ABBY get out. They nod, a little wary. GREG looks at PRICE. 

                                  GREG
                    What s wrong with him?

                                  ANYA
                    He had an accident. I can t move 
                    him on my own. 

      GREG looks at ABBY and she nods her agreement instantly.

                                  GREG
                    You re welcome to travel with us 
                    until the two of you find 
                    somewhere to stay.  

                                  ANYA
                    We re not together. 

      ABBY kneels beside PRICE, squeezing his hand kindly. 

                                  ABBY
                    You ll be okay now. 

      PRICE stares at her. His face is badly swollen but his eyes 
      glint with their customary sharp intelligence.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                                  PRICE
                    Thanks. I won t forget this. 

    She offers him her hand and he sits up painfully. With her 
    and Greg helping, he hauls himself to his feet.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      NAJID stands in the fast lane playing football. He flicks 
    the ball up and juggles it. The sight of the little boy 
      playing in the motorway is strange and unsettling. AL 
      appears.

                                  AL
                    What did I tell you about playing 
                    football in the road.

      NAJID grins and kicks the ball towards him. AL traps it and 
      smiles.

                                  AL
                    Oh, what the hell.

    He kicks it back. NAJID rushes after it, then stops as they 
      suddenly hear cars in the distance.

                                  NAJID
                    Al!

    He points at the approaching vehicles. AL gestures to him.

                                  AL
                    Come here. 

      NAJID does as he is told. They look on uncertainly as the 
    car gets nearer. When they stop, GREG, ABBY and ANYA get 
      out. PRICE sits in the back seat.

      There is a second as they all look at each other. ABBY 
      smiles at NAJID.

                                  ABBY
                    Hello.

    He shrugs, suddenly shy.









                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                                  NAJID
                    Hi.

      There is an awkward moment. She smiles warmly. 

                                  ABBY
                    It s so good to see you. 

                                  NAJID
                    I don t know you, do I?

                                  ABBY
                          (Shakes her head)
                    There are so few of us left, 
                    every new person feels like a 
                    gift.

    For a second NAJID hesitates but then suddenly all his pent-
    up loneliness and misery overwhelm him. He runs to her and 
      flings his arms around her neck, holding her desperately. 
    She hugs him back, tightly. 

      When she looks up at GREG there are tears in her eyes. 
      There is a moment, then GREG looks at AL.

                                  GREG
                    Where are you headed?

                                  AL
                    I thought I d check out what s 
                    happening in London.

                                  GREG
                    I wouldn t if I were you.

    AL looks at him inquiringly. GREG jerks his head over his 
      shoulder back towards the city.

                                  GREG
                    You think back there was bad? 
                    Wait until you see London. 
                    (Pause) If someone was still in 
                    control we d know by now.

                                  AL
                    There must be something left.

                                  GREG
                    Just a few people like us. 

      Everyone looks at him soberly. They know he is right. 

                                  AL
                    So what do we do?

      GREG shrugs. 


                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                                  GREG
                    That s up to you. (Pause, to 
                    Abby) I reckon this is the end of 
                    the line for me. 

                                  ABBY
                    What do you mean?

                                  GREG
                    I ve got things to do. You ll be 
                    okay now.

      ABBY looks at him in shock.

                                  ABBY
                    You re just going to walk out?

                                  GREG
                    I told you. I m going to find a 
                    place of my own. 

      ANYA nods her head in agreement.

                                  ANYA
                    Me too. Once Tom s okay.

    She gestures at Price. AL shrugs.

                                  AL
                    I might as well push off as well. 
                    I can t play nanny for much 
                    longer.

      NAJID looks at him bitterly. 

                                  NAJID
                    I didn t want you lurking around 
                    me anyway.

      ABBY stares at them all in angry dismay.

                                  ABBY
                    Are you all completely crazy?

      They gaze at her in surprise.

                                  ABBY
                    You can t just... go.

                                  GREG
                    Why not?

                                  ABBY
                    Because we ve only just found 
                    each other. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                                  GREG
                    We don t know each other. We ve 
                    got nothing in common.

                                  ABBY
                    We survived! Isn t that 
                    something? 

      GREG looks at her uncertainly. The others glance at each 
      other, startled by her clarity. TOM PRICE climbs awkwardly 
      from his seat and leans against the car as ABBY stares 
      bitterly at GREG.

                                  ABBY
                    You told me I should make a fresh 
                    start. How can any of us do that 
                    on our own? 

                                  GREG
                    I also told you I had plans...

                                  ABBY
                    Well they can bloody well wait! 
                    This is more important. (Pause) 
                    Everything we ever knew has been 
                    ripped away from us. Our old life 
                    is dead. Now we have to build a 
                    new one. And we can t do it 
                    alone. (Pause, to  Greg) You 
                    can t go. None of us can.

    No one is more surprised by her passion than Abby herself, 
    but the more she talks the more certain she is. She looks 
      around at them, finding an inner strength and will she 
      never knew she possessed.

                                  ABBY
                    There s only one choice. We stand 
                    together or die. 

      There is a long silence, then AL whistles in appreciation.

                                  AL
                    I m going where she s going. 

                                  PRICE
                          (After a second)
                    I m in. 

      They all look at him in surprise. He smiles through cracked 
      lips.

                                  PRICE
                    What else have we got going?

      NAJID looks at ABBY uncertainly.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                    I m going to find my cousins. But 
                    I don t mind hanging around for a 
                    bit.

      ABBY smiles at him and he looks down shyly. ANYA shrugs.

                                  ANYA
                    Why not?

    All eyes turn to GREG. ABBY looks at him fiercely.

                                  GREG
                          (Finally)
                    All right. Just until you get 
                    settled. Then I m away. 

      Abby smiles. The others smile too, optimism spreading 
      amongst them like an unfamiliar and welcome guest. They are 
    an odd, mismatched crowd, but at least they are not alone. 
      GREG smiles and looks at ABBY.

                                  GREG
                    All right, boss. What do we do 
                    now?

      ABBY stares at him in surprise, suddenly aware that all of 
      them are looking at her expectantly. She gazes out 
      uncertainly at the empty landscape. HOLD on a last image of 
      this isolated beauty, then -
