A modest but handsome home in the foothills above Gower.
SUPERIMPOSE: "1983"
A young boy, SONNY STORM, rushes out -- excited but pouty
and a little peeved. He glowers at a 1981 Mercury, parked
at the curb -- then turns back toward the house.
SONNY
(calls back to
house)
Daddy! I don't want you to go!
MASON STORM
emerges from the house -- wearing a dark Gianni Versace
sport coat with a black vest underneath, carrying some
kind of case in his hand. He looks great -- a man of
action, not dandified at all by the snappy attire. He
squints down toward Sonny, proudly -- very much the family
man.
Mason's pretty wife, FELICIA, appears in the doorway.
FELICIA
(calls to Sonny)
Your father has work to do, Sonny
... but he'll be home soon. And
we'll all watch it together.
SONNY
You promise, Dad?
STORM
I promise.
Storm and Felicia come down to car, his arm around her.
Sonny grabs his father's shirtsleeve.
SONNY
Daddy ...
(very serious)
Daddy, is E.T. gonna win?
STORM
He's got my vote.
Storm laughs and ruffles his son's hair.

He kisses Felicia, ready to leave.
SONNY

Storm lifts Sonny up into his arms. He gives the boy
100% of his attention, speaks just for him.
STORM
Knock knock.
SONNY
Who's there?
STORM
Old lady.
SONNY
Old lady who?
STORM
I didn't know you could yodel.
Sonny may not get the joke, but he laughs delightedly --
just because it's his dad telling it. Storm kisses him
and sets him down.
FELICIA

Take my advice: Don't give up your
day job.

The limousine
slowly moves
up beside a stand-alone shack
near the edge
of the wharf.
The shack is an open shelter
with a broad
overhang, and
various kinds of equipment
stored inside
it. A single
bulb illuminates it. The
limo comes to
rest, engine
off, no apparent activity in
or out of the
vehicle.
STORM'S CAR
pulls up at a distance, deep in shadow.
Stacks of huge shipping crates and Sea-Land containers
from a long wall along the cluttered dock. The towering
hulks of several ships loom close by. Storm finds a slot
between bulk containers: a good surveillance point.
STORM

the car from its rear. A beat, as Storm picks up the

One man crosses under the eave of the shack -- reaches

softly)
I know you, Calabrese. But who are
these mystery guests?
The two Shadow Men are obscured by the shack and the
position of Calabrese and Vitale.

Starts his camera soundlessly whirring. He positions his
high-tech directional mike, slipping on earphones.

Calabrese becomes aware of Mikey checking out the noise;
he motions the conspirators to shut up, then signals Mikey
to proceed. Mikey cocks his pistol, moves swiftly toward
the line of containers.

Mikey is about to check farther, when out of nowhere:
Storm lashes out with a savage punch to the face. The
blow is so devastating it knocks Mikey's feet out from
under him so that he topples face-forward into Storm's
arms, out cold. Storm soundlessly lowers the lookout to
the ground.
Storm shakes a sore hand and notices it's cut. Kneeling
down to the outstretched heap, he finds the cause of his
injury -- one of Mikey's teeth wiggles freely in his
fingers. Storm plucks the tooth and folds it inside the
big guy's hand.

he lays them side-by-side on the ground and begins to dig

and begins to fill it in, packing the earth tightly. He
goes to the top of the boards and around them wraps a
length of old hemp rope. Around and around. The boards
stand up about six feet high. Storm steps back, observes
the height, taps it lightly testing the recoil tension.
Now he begins to punch it, harder and harder. Over and
over again. Andy, preparing his lunch, can't keep her
eyes off him. She is awed by his fire and perseverance.

Storm again approaches the Makiwara.
This time it is almost as if no walls can contain him
nothing in his mind can represent a barrier. He has a
sense of total domination before he has begun.
He begins much harder and faster, continues driving his
fist deeper and faster and harder, until even those twelve
inches of solid oak are not enough for him.

concealing a short-barreled automatic weapon.
SECURITY-TYPE
Someone wants to talk to you, Storm.
The man gestures with his coat arm.
Storm's eyes follow
to:
STORM'S POV - PARK BENCH - TRENT
The Senator himself. Big, as life and cool as a cucumber.
Alone and unrecognized on a bench, shelling and munching
from a bag of peanuts. Behind him: a caged vulture.
ANGLE - PARK BENCH
as Storm MOVES INTO FRAME.
He stops, standing above Trent.
TRENT
What a day, huh? Beautiful!
(squints up at
Storm, offers
bag of nuts)
Want some nuts?
Storm makes no move.
STORM
I haven't got the film on me.
TRENT
(breezily)
I didn't think you would.
(clears space
beside him)
Sit down. Take a load off.
Storm glances to the coat-over-the-arm-man, who has taken
up a subtle position about twenty feet away.
After a beat ... Storm sits.
TRENT
You do have the film somewhere, I
assume?
Storm's hard look says yes.

TRENT
Developed yet?
STORM
Still in the camera.
TRENT
Good. Very good. That way I know
you haven't duplicated it.
Storm inches slightly closer.
STORM
You know, Trent ... I could rip
your fucking throat out before that
sonofabitch over there could find
the spit to sneeze.
TRENT
Oh, I'm sure you could, Storm.
(keeps munching
peanuts)
But not before one of those other
gentlemen, across the way, could
put a fifty-caliber slug through
your brainpan.
ANGLE - NEARBY ROOFTOP - TWO SNIPERS
Nicely concealed atop one of the zoo buildings -- their
guns zeroed on Storm's skull.
BACK TO BENCH - STORM AND TRENT
STORM
Very well placed, Trent. But did
you know that human reaction time --
even the fastest -- is between half
and three-quarters of second? And
in that time, I could easily --
Like lightning, Storm lunges for Trent... whips behind
him, seizing his throat and hauling Trent's body into the
line of fire -- as a shield protecting Storm!
TRENT
You could kill me now, Storm -- but
you'll die two seconds later.
STORM
You think I care, motherfucker?
Just so I get you -- one way or the
other.

Then, a voice from O.S.
DUNNE (O.S.)
Maybe you care about this, asshole.
MAX DUNNE
Twenty feet away -- both hands up -- holding a bay's
athletic shirt... "TRINITY VENTURA."
STORM AND TRENT
Storm: stunned.
TRENT
Reach into my jacket pocket.
(when Storm
hesitates)
Reach in!
Storm pulls out a Polaroid snapshot.
Stares at it.
INSERT - POLAROID SNAPSHOT
It's Sonny, looking terrified, in some murky environment --
Dunne and another man (Nolan) smiling with their arms
around the boy.
BACK TO SCENE
Storm releases Trent.
The Senator straightens his tie
and jacket.
TRENT
I want that film and the tape.
I'll give you three hours.
Storm stands.
Dunne facing him.
The snipers behind him.
STORM
(to Trent)
Just tell me one thing. Who pulled
the trigger on me and my wife?
TRENT
(sadistic irony)
Hate poisons people. Let go of it.
Storm glares at Trent.
Dunne takes a step forward.

DUNNE
(to Storm)
I missed your kid seven years ago.
But I won't miss tonight.
Storm glowers with fury.
Trent hands Storm a business
card.
TRENT
Bring that film, Mr. Storm.
Three
hours.
Towering smokestacks silhouetted against black sky.
Deep
RUMBLE of DYNAMOS, TURBINES --
Sonny shins down a pipe as niftily as a spider monkey!
Sonny scampers across the darkened lot, heading for the
traffic and headlights on the PCH.

A cab pulls into the curb outside Mrs. O'Malley's place,
Sonny springs out. We see the cabbie shouting after him --
and Sonny arguing, gesturing toward the nursing home.
Mrs. O'Malley emerges from the nursing home wheelchair.
Sonny rushes to her ... they embrace joyfully.
O'Malley comes out too, more cautiously than his mother.
He is armed. He also hurries to Sonny, hugs him tight.
SONNY
Malley!
O'MALLEY
It's okay, sport. It's okay...
it's okay --
Still hugging Sonny, O'Malley shoves a bill at the cabbie.
Whatever it is, the cabbie is thrilled. He boogies off
ecstatically.
The Camaro ROARS through a hairy turn.
Through the window we see O'Malley on the phone, speaking
urgently. He finishes, hangs up -
ANGLE - FRONT DOOR OF NURSING HOME
O'Malley emerges with Sonny, carrying a travel bag. The
boy and O'Malley quickly hug Mrs. O'Malley, then stride
swiftly out toward O'Malley's car.

UP BLOCK FROM NURSING HOME - SEDAN
The car with the two surveillance men we saw before, waits,
hidden in shadow. The men watch --
O'MALLEY'S CAR
with Sonny aboard, pulls out.
SEDAN
pulls out after it.
Two unmarked sedans whip in and stop ... doors open...
out come Ford, Jones and two plainclothesmen. They give
curt instructions to the valets and hurry inside --
Storm's Camaro pulls and parks.
Storm and Andy, very
wary, step out.
Storm dumps his "battering ram body" and he and Andy sprint
toward the valet booth at the main entrance of the hotel,
where numerous cars are coining and going.
VALET AREA
The valet is a big fat man in a red Beefeater costume.
He is presently handing keys to a large "good old boy" --
boots, ten-gallon hat and all. Tex is just laying a bill
in the Beefeater's hand, and starting to stuff his too-
large frame into a sleek Gullwing speedster with its doors
popped up. Before he can, we see him take a flying seat
on the road as Storm and Andy shove in and --

AVENUE OF THE STARS
Instantly the Gullwing is in flight -- SCREECHING away
from the hotel entrance, across the median and the
decorative fountain that separates the Avenue of the Stars.
But almost equally as fast, two cop cars start to close
in on him. It looks like Storm is trapped! But he slams
the pedal to the metal and blasts between them, escaping.
As the two cop cars crash into each other --
FORD AND JONES
on foot, catch up to the scene.
Too late.
FORD
Get the goddam cars!
They run off. A crowd of theatergoers stare in
bewilderment at the scene of chaos.
The Gullwing thunders off into the night.
Sonny has made his way into the parking area, amidst dozens
of cars, but he has stopped -- looking back fearfully,
worried about O'Malley. O'Malley bursts from the exit.
O'MALLEY
(shouts)
Go!
Sonny -- get outta here!
In front of the station, a cab is jacked up; the driver
replacing a flat. O'Malley starts to run toward Sonny
past the cab, when suddenly:

He is SHOT in the back by Nolan! His lurching bulk crashes
into cab, knocking it off its jack to the ground. The
tire iron (that's used as a jack handle) springs loose,
onto the ground near O'Malley.
Seeing the gunmen, Sonny in horror crawls under a car.
The cab driver flees for
his life. O'Malley
spins back,
draws and tries to fire
at the oncoming Nolan
and Turner --
but he is SHOT TWICE in
the stomach. Turner
kicks O'Malley
in the hand, sending the
gun flying off under
the cab!
NOLAN
Get the kid!
He's under the cars!
Nolan and Turner sprint off after Sonny.
Sonny rolls
from under one to another.
Nolan and Turner try to trap him, peering under the cars --
but Sonny is too agile and cat-like. Turner crouches down,
spots Sonny.
TURNER
Give us the tape, kid -- and we'll
take you home.
SONNY
Fuck you, Jack!
Turner aims his gun.
Suddenly:
His head turns to squash as: a bloody O'Malley stands
over him, bashing him with a tire iron!
A crowd of bystanders scream in horror at this horrendous
sight.
A block from Union Station, the GULLWING SCREECHES into
view.
Nolan comes around the end of the car, sees O'Malley --
standing over the dead Turner with a tire iron in his
hand. It is clear
O'Malley is about to die. But still
he staggers toward Nolan, raising the tire iron.
Nolan, gun in hand, watches incredulously. O'Malley
staggers another step. Sonny has crawled out from under
the car; he sees this. O'Malley staggers another step.

O'MALLEY

You don't deserve to wear your badge.
with his last failing strength,
O'Malley raises the tire iron.
Nolan PUMPS him once, square in the
chest, killing him.
Sonny screams and flees in fear for his life. Nolan races
after him. Between the maze of parked cars. Sonny,
dodging, in between the endless rows.
Meanwhile a small crowd has gathered around the mortally
wounded O'Malley.
Suddenly, O.S. we hear the SCREECHING of TIRES. The crowd
reacts as the Gullwing blasts into the lot, ROARING
straight toward Nolan and the terrorized Sonny. Finally,
unable to get any closer, Storm leaps out of the Gullwing,
onto the hood of a car and races across the rooftops of
one vehicle after another, closing in on Nolan and Sonny.
Andy stops in horror beside the deathly stricken O'Malley.
ON SONNY
unaware of Storm -- trying to escape from his pursuer.
NOLAN
cursing and unable to gain ground on the fleet-footed --
now actually raising his gun. Suddenly:
STORM
from the roof of the next-to-last car roof in a line of
parked vehicles soars through the air like a night eagle-
setting what looks like a new world record in the long
jump -- surprising Nolan from the rear! Slamming the cop
to the ground in instant death. Cracking his neck.
SONNY
stops. Gasping, breathless -- seeing the father he hasn't
seen in seven years.
STORM
relieved and overwhelmed, grabs his son and lifts him off
the ground in a moment of salvation and triumph. They
hold each other with all their strength.

However their moment is incomplete, as Sonny is visibly
distraught about the stricken O'Malley, beginning to sob
at the loss of his surrogate father. Storm turns and
starts to move toward --
O'MALLEY - ON GROUND
Andy ... the crowd around O'Malley. Sonny breaks through,
with Storm half a pace behind. Sonny kneels, embracing
his fallen friend. Storm joins his son, kneels alongside
him, both mourning the loss of their dearest comrade.
ANDY
watching them.
Touched deeply. Then: O.S. SIRENS!
Two police CARS ROAR into view, racing for the station.
BACK TO PARKING LOT
Storm jumps up -- turns Sonny over to Andy, hurrying them
into a nearby cab. The cab takes off.
leaps aboard the Gullwing, ROARS out of the lot --
THUNDERSTORM - NIGHT (STOCK)
Forked lightning blazes above Los Angeles, THUNDER BOOMS --
STAND OF PALMS
illuminated by lightning
... RAIN sheeting past... WIND RIPPING the fronds in a
RATTLING MAELSTROM --
No sentries, no dogs. Only a high gate and fence
surrounding the fort-like mansion.
STORM
swiftly sliding through the shadows, he moves around the
perimeter, pausing to examine things, searching for
something. He finds an old storm gate to what would
probably be a cellar or basement.
We are not sure where we are yet. In
the distance, we
see a procession of marching men, all
wearing kilts, and
all the accoutrements of traditional
Scottish garb. In
the front, several paces ahead of the
neatly marching
lines of men, is a single BAGPIPER.
Behind all of them
is a hearse, being nobly escorted by
mounted police.
FULL SHOT
Now we see them fully: the colors, the feeling, the emotion
of caring men marching in the funeral parade of a fallen
comrade.
CAMERA PAN'S OVER to reveal a section of mourners -- mostly
police but with some civilians. The CAMERA MOVES CLOSER
and PANS TO the front row, where we see Storm in full
police regalia, a medal of valor around his neck. Andy
and Sonny are standing near at sober attention.
The procession stops and the lone bagpiper continues to
play the dirge as he walks up and takes his position on a
section of lawn. The pallbearers remove the flag from
the casket and present it to the Chief of Police, who now
slowly approaches the group of mourners and stops directly
in front of Sonny Storm. He presents the flag and salutes
Sonny. The lone bagpiper stops and an officer on TRUMPET
begins playing "Taps." The coffin is slowly lowered.
FULL SCREEN - TV MONITOR
Finally: the film that Storm shot that night seven years
ago on the wharf. Spliced with the audiotape -- with
subtitles including each speaker's name to make every
word and identity clear. We see:
The two Shadow Men step from the station wagon. The
"pushed" film clearly reveals them to be Trent and Holland.
We see them conspire with Calabrese and Vitale.
CALABRESE (V.O.)
Murder is a serious business, my
friend. And an expensive one.

TRENT (V.O.)
I'm up to here with caution! This
(bleep) lives on alfalfa sprouts
and bean curd, he ain't gonna die
of natural cause.
Our SHOT starts to WIDEN, revealing that the TV monitor
is in a news studio. The nightly news is being broadcast:
what we see on this monitor is simultaneously going out
over the air.
As the SHOT WIDENS and TRAVERSES, we begin to see the
actual news set -- including Esposito who got his well-
deserved scoop -- and other anchorpeople, crewmen, etc.
CALABRESE (V.O.)
All I'm counseling is a little
patience. The man is public. He's
in the paper every day.
TRENT (V.O.)
Yeah? Well, the next time I read
about him, it better be in the
obituaries.
CONTINUE MOVE as the wharf scene keeps playing. The TV
monitor passes OUT OF FRAME, SOUND goes DOWN, we're MOVING
PAST the news set and its occupants (who are readying to
go back on-camera as soon as the wharf tape ends) and on
UP TOWARD --
LIGHTS ABOVE NEWS SET
which now FILL the FRAME -- bright and blinding. The
screen starts to bleach out ... it goes white and
MATCH CUT - SUN (MARINA DEL REY)
above a perfect peaceful sea. A small powerboat (the
kind that you rent from the dock) moves INTO FRAME. Storm
steers it, standing up. Andy and Sonny in the back cockpit
seat.

She switches a channel: up comes the same footage we just
saw on the news set.

It takes a beat before she realizes what it is. Then:

Storm takes a step so he can see the screen.

for a short beat, then --
STORM
picks the TV up from Andy's lap and, while it's still
playing, heaves it over the side and into the drink!
OCEAN SURFACE - TV
splashes ... bobs for a few moments... then sinks beneath
the surface.
ANDY
(laughing)
Hey!
Why'd you do that?
STORM
watching the last ripples from the sinking set. A moment
between him and himself -- when the past is allowed to
slip away, sink out of sight, making way for the future.
Storm turns back from the water surface, to his son and
to the woman he loves. He sits (letting the boat drift
wherever it wants to) and tugs Andy down beside him.
Then he reaches across to his son, pulls the boy to him
with a playful headlock.
For a moment both Andy and Sonny are held in suspension,
wondering what Storm will do or say.
Finally:
STORM
(to Sonny)
Knock, knock.
For a beat, the boy is taken aback.
Then he break's into
a broad smile.
SONNY
Who's there?
Storm glances to Andy, pulling her tighter to him.

SONNY
Boo who?
STORM
You don't have to cry about it.

I love you both.
Storm hugs his son with great affection, pulling Andy to
him with his other arm. This is their beginning.
BOAT
drifts its happy way across the sun-shimmering sea.
FADE OUT.
