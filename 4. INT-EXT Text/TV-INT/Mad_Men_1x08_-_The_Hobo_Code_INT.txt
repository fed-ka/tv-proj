      Elevator doors slide open to reveal a middle-aged, black 
      OPERATOR.  He nods a greeting as Pete ENTERS.  

                                  PEGGY (O.S.)
                    Oh, hold the doors, please!

      Peggy rushes up and squeezes through the closing doors.

                    Thank you.

                                  PETE
                    Well, well.

                                  PEGGY
                    Good Morning.

                                  PETE
                    Says who?

                                  PEGGY
                      Twenty-three, please.

                    ...What?

                                  PETE
                    Don t you think I would have 
                    already said what floor?  

                                  PEGGY
                    I, I don t know.

                                  PETE
                    Besides, how long have you been 
                    working here -- how long have I  
                    been working here?  The man 
                      recognizes us.  

                                  PEGGY
                    Right.  Sorry.

      An awkward moment.  Peggy breaks it, all nervous energy.

                    I can t believe they let you write.

                    You re right, I m sorry.

      Peggy can t decide where to look.

                    I m supposed to supervise the

                    movers, by the way, she has coming 
                    today instead of Saturday, which is

                    why I m here at the crack of dawn.

                    I m a nervous wreck, too.  I kept 
                    my roommate up all night pacing the

                    Rummy should gargle Lavoris

                    to buy a slogan that doesn t reek 
                    of rotgut.

      The elevator pings.  

                                  PETE
                    Make sure he spits it out.  



      The entire floor is deserted as Pete and Peggy CROSS.

                                  PEGGY
                    It smells different up here.

      E/I. PETE S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 

      Pete ENTERS his office, Peggy stands half in half out.

                                  PEGGY
                    I m going to make a pot of coffee.  
                    Would you like some?

                                  PETE
                    No.

                                  PEGGY
                    You sure?

                                  PETE
                    No coffee, Peggy.

      They look into one another s eyes.  Peggy moves in.  They 
      kiss passionately.  He pulls her hair, she fumbles with his 
      belt buckle, they crab-walk to the couch.  He fiddles with 
      her skirt zipper, but it s stretched too tight and difficult 
      to undo, so he yanks her blouse.

                                  PEGGY
                    Don t, you re ripping it.      MAD MEN  EP#107  CP 2nd Draft  "The Code Don't Lie"  9/5/07

      So he digs under her shirt.  Finds an undergarment.  He pulls 
      it down.  Finds another.

                                  PETE
                    Jesus, you re wrapped like a mummy. 

      She eases him onto the couch.  He is prone, undoing his tie, 
      watching her disrobe.  It is such an involved process that 
      enough time passes for us to notice the hunting rifle leaning 
      against the wall.  

      At last, Peggy shimmies out of her drawers.  Pete s eyes 
      light up.  She moves toward him.



      The two lovers are blurry forms moving behind the frosted 
      glass windows that separate Pete s office from the bullpen.  
      The sound of their rising passion is drowned out by a caravan 
      of FIRE TRUCKS ROARING THROUGH THE STREETS below.



      Peggy reassembles the layers of her meticulous outfit with a 
      druggy smile on her face.  Pete s expression is distant. 

                                  PETE
                    Listen.  Maybe this isn t the right 
                    time to mention this but I want to 
                    clear the air.  
                          (beat)
                    I know I told you I d look over the

                                  PEGGY
                    Pete, stop.  There are only so many 
                    hours in the day.  It s okay.

      She inspects her collar in the reflection of his desk lamp -- 
      the seam needs stitching, but for now it must simply slouch 
      in an unattractive way.  She s miffed.

                                  PEGGY (CONT D)
                    Nuts.

                                  PETE
                    I ve made a mistake, Peggy.

                    No, not this.  I needed this.  What 
                    I mean is.  I mean marriage is a

                                  PEGGY
                    Well, gosh, Pete, give it a chance.

                    I guess.  I don t know.  I have all 
                    these things going on in my head 
                    and I can t say them.  I won t be

                    say to me.

      He touches her elbow.

                                  PETE
                    I don t know why I did it.  I guess 
                    I did what I was told.  Everybody 
                    said  she s a great gal, she ll 
                    make a great wife, a great mom,

                    she doesn t understand me.

      is coming to life.

                    It s lovely weather.  But we can 
                    cab it if you want.  

      Trudy moves toward the couch.

                    Even better, really.  It would give 
                    us a little time to celebrate.  

      She sits in the exact locus of Pete and Peggy s morning screw 
      and starts peeling the foil off the top of the bottle.

                    What are you doing?

                    Yeah.  Look.  Trudy, you shouldn t 
                    have come here.

      She stops peeling.

                    Shouldn t have?  What does that 
                    mean?  I m your wife.

                                  PETE
                    I know.  I just don t think I can 
                    leave early.

                                  TRUDY
                    That s absurd.  Of course you can.

                    No, I can t.  Things are busy.  I 
                    have a lot of calls to make.  What

      She becomes visibly upset.

                                  PETE (CONT D)
                    Oh, come on.  Don t be like this, 
                    don t get that look.  Why don t we 
                    have a glass of champagne.  Huh?  
                    Let s have a glass of champagne.

      She sniffles, peels away the foil and corks the champagne.  
      Appropriately enough, the bottle foams over a bit.



      There s a generous spread for the lipstick people: coffee, 
      cookies, a tray of sandwiches.  Booze, too.  The titular MR. 
      MAXFIELD, flanked by his three ASSOCIATES, pours himself 
      coffee.  His right-hand man, AL STRAYHORN, reaches for

                    colors her man.

                    And this idea of  marking.   I m

      Mr. Maxfield reads his associates.  He takes the phone.

                    Ask her how many colors she d like

                    reads Ayn Rand?  I am shocked.

      He flashes Cooper s check.  She whistles like  whoa.

                                  MIDGE
                    I had something planned.  

                                  DON
                    Better than transatlantic flight?

                                  MIDGE
                    You might like it.  A little

                                  DON
                    Sounds fruity.

      She opens the front door.  Two more bohemians gambol in: ROY, 
      whom we ve met before, and KIBBY, a hot proto-hippie with 
      armpit hair and boyish tits peeking out of her flowing dress; 
      she s carrying a Spanish guitar.  

                                  KIBBY
                    Hey!  Finally!

      Kibby hands the guitar to Midge.

                                  MIDGE
                    Oh.  Um.  Thanks.

                                  KIBBY
                    You look surprised.  I thought you 
                    wanted it back.

                                  MIDGE
                    I... Don t own a guitar.

                                  KIBBY
                    Oh.  Oh, well.  Um.  You want one?

                                  MIDGE
                    Say hello to Don.  Don, this is 
                    Kibby, and you remember Roy.

                                  DON
                    Yeah.

                                  ROY
                    Yeah.

                                  KIBBY
                    Hey, handsome.

                    We all present and accounted for?

      Dora opens the clasp on her tiny rhinestone clutch and pulls 
      out a huge branch of MARIJUANA that clearly took up the whole 
      purse.  Don eyes Midge, who returns a raised eyebrow.  

                                  DORA (CONT D)
                    Got a spare a nail?

      Don shakes out a smoke.  She takes it, he lights it.  

                                  DORA (CONT D)
                    Thanks.  

      Dora opens the gatefold sleeve of an LP titled GOSPEL 
      CLASSICS.  

                                  DON
                    Oh, I see, it s a revival meeting.

                    That s right, baby, we re all going 
                    to heaven tonight.

      Roy hands her rolling papers, which she sets in the crook of 
      the album.  She then picks seeds and stems from the pot. 

                                  DON
                    You kids kill me.  You need a

                    Yeah, Jeff, that s how you do it.

                                  DON
                    Is that so, Maynard G. Krebs?  
                    Cause that s not how I ever did it, 
                    and I been rolling smokes since LPs 
                    were 78s.

                    Sometime you gotta leave the 
                    Village for a decent screw.

      Roy drops the needle on a record.  It s hard to tell what it 
      is, free-jazz, soundtrack to foreign film, Miles Davis.  
      Whatever it is, it s weird and intense.       MAD MEN  EP#107  CP 2nd Draft  "The Code Don't Lie"  9/5/07

                                  ROY
                    Oh, man, this cat is the gonest!

                                  JUDD
                    This your maiden voyage, eh, Jeff?

                                  MIDGE
                    You re the Jeff, Judd.  Lay off 
                    him.  His name is Don.

                                  KIBBY
                    Well, don t you worry, Don.  We ll 
                    take real good care of you.

      Kibby throws a tapestry over the light and bathes the room in 
      different colors.



        Conversation and the strains of Rogers and Hart play off one 
      another at a polite volume in this elegant, discreet bar.  A 
      grey-haired BARTENDER stirs gin and ice with a long spoon, 
      then strains the concoction into a frosted martini glass.  
      It s finished with a sunken spear of cocktail onions. 

      The bartender sets the drink in front of Al Strayhorn and 
      leaves a carafe of extra beside the glass.  Strayhorn nods 
      and tucks in.  It tastes as good as it looks.

      A GLASS BREAKS somewhere and Al turns to look.  It s nothing, 
      but it leads his eye toward Salvatore, ENTERING.  They 
      acknowledge one another.  Salvatore approaches.

                    I needed a little extra time in

      tentative eye contact, fiddles with his cuff links.

                    Did you eat?  Maybe you should get 
                    something in you.

      Strayhorn enjoys the double-ent ndre that Salvatore doesn t 
      catch right away.

      We see it in Salvatore s eyes: he will.



      The gang from Sterling Cooper is cramped in back of the bar 
      near the juke box.  A few couples, Peggy among them, sway to 
      a syrupy ballad.  Freddy Rumson cuts in on Peggy s partner, 
      and she obliges him with a chaste slow dance.  FIND Joan 
      talking to Lois: both dancing, both ignoring their partners.

                                  JOAN
                    I m not saying Peggy doesn t have 
                    something upstairs, I m just saying 
                    at Sterling Cooper things are 
                    usually happening downstairs.

      Lois gets whirled around -- by a guy that s not Salvatore.

                    I said things are usually happening 
                      downstairs.

                                  LOIS
                    Oh, I m sorry.  Yes, good to know.

                                  JOAN
                    What s with you?

                                  LOIS

                    Nothing.  I m fine.

      FIND Ken, Pete, Harry, and a few other suits sitting and 
      watching from Loser s Row.  Pete eyes Peggy as she kisses 
      Rummy on the cheek in the song s final moments.  Rummy 
      returns the nicety with a courtly bow and spills some of his 
      drink.  Most everyone goes to the bar.

      Silence from sulking, sullen Pete.

                    Take that as a no.  

      A girl loads the juke box with coins.  After a respite a 
      rollicking song blasts out: CHUBBY CHECKER S  THE TWIST.  

      Peggy and the girls immediately jump up in delight.  They 
      cluster together and start gyrating.  A few guys get up and 
      head for them.  Everyone is into it except Pete.  

      Peggy sees Pete s committed pout and slinks toward him, 
      mouthing the lyrics.  Her arms beckon, her hips twist, her 
      face radiates desire.  It s sexier than we ve yet seen her, 
      but Pete seems immune. 

      She takes his hands and see-saws, doing The Twist.

                                  PEGGY
                    Come on, grumpy.  

      He looks her dead in the eye.

                                  PETE
                    I don t like you like this.

      Peggy s twist becomes a swivel.  Her face falls and her eyes 
      well up.  She snaps her hands away and returns to the crowd 
      to dance.  Pete crumples his cocktail napkin and EXITS.



      Al and Salvatore have moved to a small table and finished 
      dinner.  A BUSBOY clears the utensils and glasses and uses a 
      crumb valet to sweep the tablecloth.  A WAITER places coffee 
      in front of Al and a dram of Sambuca in front of Salvatore.  
      Three espresso beans rest at the bottom of the shot glass.

                    You do have a certain  tortured

                    It s nothing to do with art; I 
                    spend my days sketching bubble gum

      Pot smoke and  Sketches of Spain  hang in the air.  Dora runs 
      her fingers through a candle flame.  Roy picks at a bunch of 
      grapes and whispers to Kibby.  Across the room, Don is on 
      Midge s bed, eyes droopy, lips chapped.  Midge lays beside 
      him in a haze.  

      Don turns and reaches around her shoulders.  He means to 
      embrace her, but instead gets a clutch of men s hair.  

                                  JUDD
                    Hey, man!

      They both pull away with a start.

                                  DON
                    Whoa, hey, sorry.

                                  MIDGE
                    All right, calm down, don t flip 
                    out.

      Don gets up and composes himself.  He pulls a glass from the 
      sink, cleans it with his shirttail and fills it with tap 
      water.  He walks over to the hi-fi and looks through Midge s 
      records.  Miles is replaced by some fuddy-duddy crooner.

                    at least I think those are tits.

                    you make yourself useful and get 
                    everyone some water.

      She does. 

                                  MIDGE
                    Wow, I ve got to get one of those.

      Dora prepares the Gospel LP for another joint.  Don turns to 
      his attention to her.

                                  DORA
                    Like to watch?  That your bag?

                    Let me try.

      She shrugs, hands him the pot and the papers.  Don rolls a 
      perfect smoke in ten seconds flat, as natural as breathing.    

                                  DORA

                    I have.

      She sparks the joint, takes a pull on it and offers it to 
      Don, whose attention is drifting somewhere unsettling. 

                                  DON (CONT D)
                    No, thanks.  I, uh, I have to...



      Don looks at his reflection for a long moment, then takes a 
      comb from his pocket.  In the mirror, we go close on Don s 
      hand running over his scalp.


      CLOSE UP -- (FLASHBACK)

      A boy s hand combs hair.  A train whistles in the distance.


      WIDER

      DICK (Young Don) stands in front of the mirror, exactly as 
      Don was in front of Midge s mirror.  We are now...



      Don emerges from the bathroom, the room mad with music.  He 
      sits on the couch next to Midge.  Everyone else has gathered 
      in the dinette for an ersatz palm reading.  Cheap wine is 
      drunk from tumblers, cigarettes smolder between fingers. 

                                  MIDGE
                    I can t believe you.

      She giggles and pulls down his tie, which is still tight.   

      Don doesn t react.  He looks at Midge s hipster friends, then 
      looks across the room where, as in a stage play, the lights 
      dim except for a spotlight on the DINING ROOM in Dick s 
      (Young Don s) childhood home.  Dick scoots out a chair and 
      joins Archibald and The Hobo at the table.  Effie ENTERS from 
      out of the shadows carrying a crock of god knows what.  

                                  ARCHIBALD
                    You give him the bones, Effie.  He 
                    don t get no God damned meat. 

                                  EFFIE
                    The man can t go to sleep with an 
                    empty belly.  Hardly any meat to 
                    give, besides.

                                  ARCHIBALD
                    Jesus Christ Almighty no one told 
                    you could (trails off muttering).

      He knocks back a long swig of home brew.

                                  DICK
                    Want my chicken leg, mister?

      Archibald backhands Dick.  It stings and he suppresses tears.

                                  ARCHIBALD
                    Put that back on your plate, you

      Don strains at the memory playing out in front of him.  
      Midge s laughter creeps into the tableau, as does the scream 
      and bash of free jazz.  Suddenly, POLICE SIRENS.  The 
      spotlight darkens on the dinner scene.  The hipsters get edgy 
      and go to the window.

                    Well, we should capture this magic 
                    moment, don t you think?  

      Don grabs Midge s Polaroid camera off the end table.

                                  DON (CONT D)
                    Come on, Dora, you exotic flower.  
                    Memories are made of this.  

      Don flashes a shot of Dora and pulls out the film.  

                                  DON (CONT D)
                    How about you, Midge?

      Don snaps and the flash goes off.  He peels out the film and 
      sets it on the table.  

                                  DON (CONT D)
                    Who else?  Who s next?

      He laughs at himself, then shoves the camera in Don s face as 
      a fuck-you.  A blast of white light fills the screen as we...

      The Hobo s skeletal hand pours tobacco into a small crease of

                    See, now, that s a double negative.  
                     Don t you trust anybody.    And 
                    the answer is I trust the code.      MAD MEN  EP#107  CP 2nd Draft  "The Code Don't Lie"  9/5/07

      Dick s expression is blank.  The Hobo picks a rock off the 
      crate by Dick s cot and gets down on his haunches.  

                                  HOBO (CONT D)
                    It s like the old jungle buzzards

                    That s not good English, but I 
                    don t care to correct them.

      The Hobo scratches out a few crude symbols on the floor of 
      the root cellar.  He points.  

                                  HOBO (CONT D)
                    This one means if you talk religion 
                    you ll get a meal.  This tells you 
                    to watch out for a nasty dog.  This 
                    one means that a dishonest man 
                    lives here.  And this means tell a 
                    sad story.  

                                  DICK

                    You just do.  If you want to 
                    survive.

                                  DICK
                    Don t you ever want to go --

                    Back to my wife, my girls?

      The Hobo stubs out his cigarette.

                    Gotta keep movin .  You quit for

                    next, I d wager it d be here. 

      Dick looks mildly startled.  The Hobo is on to other things, 
      however.  Again he pulls out tobacco and papers.      MAD MEN  EP#107  CP 2nd Draft  "The Code Don't Lie"  9/5/07

                    Now, what we do is we sprinkle a

      Don comes to his senses on the couch, Midge s head on his 
      chest, her feet in Roy s lap.  Don reaches for the by-now-
      developed Polaroids.  He shuffles through them and is stopped 
      short by the shot he took of Midge and Roy.

                                  DON

      Are you nuts?  Of course she chooses Roy.

                                  MIDGE
                    You re having some kind of reaction

      Some mocking laughter breaks out.  Don recoils.

                    Play it cool, let s not ruin it.

      A few grumbles of assent.

                    Selling is your game and we re not 
                      interested, because selling s about

                    Whatever you want to label it,

                    You talk about  the establishment,

      Midge looks at him for a long moment.  She shakes her head 
      no.  He removes Cooper s check from his pocket, clicks his 
      pen, and endorses it... To her.  He stuffs it in her bra.

                    Buy yourself a Cadillac.

      Don throws his jacket over his shoulder.

                                  DORA
                    Fuzz is out there.  You can t go.

      He pushes up his tie up to his collar.

      ...Coming off the elevators into the empty office.  She makes 
      her way through the bullpen.  She stops at the door to Pete s 
      office.  She peeks in, looks around and leaves.      MAD MEN  EP#107  CP 2nd Draft  "The Code Don't Lie"  9/5/07  
                                                                                    51.



      Peggy sits and opens her shoulder bag.  She removes a blouse  
      and places it in her bottom drawer.  She fixes her lipstick. 



      DING.  Peggy looks up.  A woman gets off the elevator.  

                                                                      TIME CUT TO:



      Another DING.  Peggy sees an older gentleman step off the 
      elevator.  The office is more lively now, filling up.

                                                                      TIME CUT TO:



      Another DING.  She doesn t even look.  She salts an egg.  



                                  OFFICE GIRL (O.S.)
                    Good Morning, Mr. Campell.

                                  PETE (O.S.)
                    Morning.

      Peggy looks up and sees Pete approaching.  She watches him 
      come towards her, lock eyes with her, then pass her 
      completely.  No words are uttered.  He steps into his office 
      and closes the door.  

      Hold on Peggy a moment.  Her shoulders sag.  Then she puts 
      paper in her typewriter and begins working.

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.
