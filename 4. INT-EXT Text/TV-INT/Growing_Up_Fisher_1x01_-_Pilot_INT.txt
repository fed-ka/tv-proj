      Henry sits at the breakfast table with RUNYEN, who is 
      basically Vince Vaughn.  If Vince Vaughn were fourteen and 
      Asian.  Mel enters dressed for work.  

                                RUNYEN
                Mel Baby!  Khakis go with everything, 
                smart.  Suspenders and a belt?  I m 
                gonna give you a pass because of the 
                whole eyes no worky thing.

      Runyen takes it upon himself to pop Mel s collar.  Mel can t 
      help but smile at the kid s audacity.  

                                MEL
                      (messing with him)
                I d kick you out if I didn t think it 
                was important for my son to have Black 
                friends.

                his eyesight... 


      Mel and his colleague, KEN, 40s, greet a potential client, BILL.      ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           7


                                KEN
                Mel Fisher, I'd like you to meet-- 

      Mel extends his hand immediately, forcing the guy to meet his 
      handshake. 

                                KEN (CONT D)
                --Bill Duffy.

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...But he did trick 'em a lot.   


      Ken and Bill sit at a table, waiting.  Mel enters and puts a 
       playful  arm around Henry who again walks on Mel s left side.  

                                MEL
                      (making a show of it)
                Get in here!  You are not too old to 
                get a hug from your old man!  
                      (then, sotto)
                Okay, what do we got?

                                HENRY
                      (sotto)
                They re both here.  Table s ten steps 
                away, empty chair s at three o'clock.  
                And Ken s fly is wide open.

      Mel confidently walks to the table and takes the empty seat.  

                                MEL
                Ken, Bill.  Hope it's okay that I 
                brought our youngest associate.  Tae 
                Kwon Do got cancelled.
                      (sotto, gesturing)
                Ken, barn door.

      Ken quickly zips up.  Henry looks at the menu.

                                HENRY
                        ( innocently  for Mel s benefit)
                Ahi tuna burger?  Uch.  I'm just 
                getting a quesadilla.

                                MEL
                Whatever you want, bud.  But I'm 
                getting the ahi burger.  Sounds 
                  delicious.

      Henry and Katie stand playing Wii tennis.

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...I could help him with anything...

      Mel enters, plowing into a glass coffee table.  

                                MEL
                Son of a bitch!

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                  ...Except that damn coffee table.  

      Henry and Katie reset the glass for the millionth time.  

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                For as long as I could remember, I was 
                his human guide dog...


      Mel stands holding ELVIS, a beautiful German Shepherd that 
      wears a U-SHAPED HARNESS.  At the sight of Henry, Elvis wags 
      his tail excitedly.  

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...Which is why I was surprised when 
                he got a real one.  

      Mel ties the leash around a leg of the dining room table.  
      Katie texts in the den, dubious.

                                HENRY
                Sweet.  My very own seeing eye dog.  
                      (then, to Mel)
                That's actually mostly yours.

                                MEL
                The correct term is  guide dog.   He 
                doesn't see for me, he guides me.  
                Like a GPS that drools.

                                KATIE
                      (eyes still on phone)
                Perfect.  A trained animal.  That was 
                the only thing missing from this circus.

                                MEL
                Now, Henry, it may take him a while to 
                get used to you...

      Henry drops to his knees and Elvis runs into his arms, 
      dragging the table with him, licking his face like crazy.    ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           9

                to know your scent.  You know, first 
                date stuff.

      Henry wrestles with Elvis, then stops, realizing something.

                                HENRY
                Wait a minute.  I thought the whole 
                reason we never got a dog is because 
                Mom s allergi--

      Henry sees Joyce SNEEZING that chain of eight consecutive 
      sneezes where you stop saying,  Bless you.   

                                KATIE
                Yeah, douche.  Dad's moving out.   

                                JOYCE
                      (between sneezes)
                Don't call-- your brother-- a douche.

                                MEL
                Look, Mom and I talked about this and 
                we both agree we d be happier if--

      Mel crosses and plows into the coffee table.  CRASH!  

                                MEL (CONT D)

                Aaaand that s how I found out my 
                parents were getting divorced.

      As Katie and Joyce reset the glass top, Elvis gives Henry s 
      hand a comforting lick.  But Henry moves away.  

                                HENRY

      Mel, Henry, and Elvis walk into the lobby.  Henry pushes a 
      bellman s cart while eating a sandwich. 

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                A lot of kids blame themselves for 
                their parents  divorce...

      Elvis steps up on the cart and sneaks a bite of hanging 
      turkey, ripping all the meat from the sandwich.

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...but I was pretty certain this one 
                was the dog s fault.

                                HENRY
                You re really pushing it, dude.

      They approach the CLERK at the registration desk.

                                CLERK
                Okay, no, no, no.  No dogs allowed.

                                MEL
                It s okay, he s a guide dog.

                                CLERK
                Yeah... No.  We have a strict  no pet  
                policy.

                                MEL
                And I have a strict  don t break the 
                law  policy.

                Can t see a thing.

      To prove it, Henry waves his hand in front of Mel s face.    ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           11


                                MEL
                And California Civil Code 54.1 makes it 
                illegal to deny lodging to someone using 
                  a service animal.

                                HENRY
                It s a civil code, Kev.  Our hands are 
                tied.

                                MEL
                If you don't give me a room right now, I 
                will sue you so fast that by the time 
                the dust settles this place will be 
                called the Mel Fisher Hotel.  

                                HENRY

                We ll see how the logo looks.

      As Kevin quickly types into his computer, Mel and Henry stand 
      there, savoring their win. 


      An amazing suite.  Henry and Mel kick back on a king-sized 
      bed, scraping the last of the fudge from their sundaes. 

                                MEL
                I gotta hand it to Kevin.  He really 
                redeemed himself with these hot fudge 
                sundaes.  I might even post a nice 
                comment on Yelp.  Nah, probably not. 
                Kinda bloated.

      Just then, Mel s talking watch announces the time.

                Buddy, I can t think of a better way 
                to have started off our new life, but 
                you ve got school tomorrow, I ve got a 
                  deposition.  And most importantly, we 
                gotta get you home before Mom thinks

                                HENRY
                But doesn t it make more sense-- just 
                thinking logically here-- for me to 
                stay and help you navigate the new 
                place.

                Don t worry about me.  I ve got Elvis. 

      As Henry gets up, Elvis takes Henry s place on the bed.

                And before I even got the hot fudge 
                off my face, my job had just been 
                  outsourced to a dog.


      Henry exits the cab to find Joyce sitting on the front steps, 
      smoking her pipe.  She blocks his way.  

                                JOYCE

                  apartment, you can stay with him as 
                much as you want.  Pants.  

      He does a quick look to make sure no neighbors are watching, 
      waves hi to Mrs. Goldfein, then reluctantly removes his jeans.    ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           13

                Hotels are where rock stars go to do 
                their pot.  Look at me.

                                HENRY
                Please don t do  look at me.

                Look at me.  
                      (holding his face)
                I know there re a lot of changes going 
                on right now, but we re still going to 
                be the same family we always were.  

                                HENRY
                Did you... get braces?

      Joyce smiles, proudly displaying her new metal mouth.  Katie 
      appears at the screen door.

                                KATIE
                That s right, Button.  And apparently, 
                as a personal favor to you and me, she 
                turned down the Invisaligns.  

      Joyce dumps tobacco out of her pipe and crosses over to her.

                Oh, there you are, Kitten.  What are

                                HENRY
                No, God no.  I mean, I m glad Dad got 
                Elvis but--

                                RUNYEN
                I get it.  You feel like you re being 
                  replaced.  

      Henry stares out the window and sighs.

                                RUNYEN (CONT D)
                Are you gonna be like this the whole 
                field trip,  cause if so, I ll go sit 
                with Bobby Lacito.  I will not have you 
                wrecking the botanical gardens for me.


      Henry and Runyen are filing off the bus with the rest of the 
      students who are lining up on the sidewalk.  

                                RUNYEN
                I ll tell you what you gotta do.  You 
                gotta find something you can do that 
                Mr. Costello-- I refuse to call him 
                Elvis-- can t.  

                                HENRY
                Like what?

      Henry and Runyen exit the bus.

                                RUNYEN
                I don t know.  Like opposable thumb 
                stuff.  Open olive jars, fold socks 
                into balls, challenge Mel Baby to some 
                pretty intense thumb wrestling.  

      Henry spots something across the street.

                                HENRY
                Oh my God, that s it.    ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           15


                                RUNYEN
                Yeah.  Even your best trained dogs 
                can t thumb wrestle.  

                                HENRY
                No.  Look.  

      Henry points to a sign that says  Apartment for Rent. 

                                HENRY (CONT D)
                I m going to get my dad an apartment.  
                That s something a dog can t do.

                                RUNYEN
                That s also something a fourteen year 
                old can t do.

      Henry starts to walk towards the apartment.  

                                RUNYEN (CONT D)
                What are you doing?  You can t leave a 
                field trip.  We signed a permission 
                slip!

                                HENRY
                      (crossing off)
                Put away the spicy pork and cover for me!

      Runyen tries to psych himself up like a boxer about to enter 
      the ring as he walks over to the TEACHER.  Just as he gets 
      there... he takes off his backpack, undoes the strap and drops 
      to the sidewalk,  wailing  in a full Korean meltdown.

                                RUNYEN
                Puloju soyo!  Puloju soyo!  My 
                backpack broke!

      The teacher immediately puts all her focus on consoling him.

                                TEACHER
                It s okay, it s okay.  We can fix it.  
                Or we ll get you a new one!

                                RUNYEN
                Nega wha nasoyo!  Nega wha nasoyo!  
                Jansport doesn t make this one anymore!

      Runyen looks and sees Henry has made it to the apartment 
      building and, on a dime, pulls himself together.

                                RUNYEN (CONT D)
                Oh, wait, it just snaps back together.

      Henry stands in the doorway.  The building manager, FRED, mid-
      40s, African-American, sits behind a big desk on his cell phone.  

                                FRED
                      (into phone, intense)
                  ...That s just it, everyone brings 
                wine to a dinner party.  But I m not 
                  everyone.  That s why I brought the 
                cactus.   

      He sees Henry and covers the phone.

                                FRED (CONT D)
                Can I help you?

                                HENRY
                Is the apartment still available?

                                FRED
                You running away from home?  

                                HENRY
                  Actually, my dad is.  

      Fred gets what Henry means.

                                FRED
                Well, bring him back, I'll give him a 
                tour.  And a stress ball.  

      Henry starts to walk away and Fred returns to his call.

                                FRED (CONT D)
                      (into phone)
                Manny, a bottle of wine lasts one 
                night.  Cacti outlive most people.  
                You know what, tell Cindy I want my 
                cactus back.  

      Henry turns back.

                                HENRY
                Here's the deal, my dad's blind.  I'm 
                going to be his eyes on this.  If I 
                like the place, he'll like the place.  
                So how  bout you go ahead and give me 
                that tour.


      Mid-tour.  Henry s checking out an impressive walk-in pantry.      ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           17


                                HENRY
                Very nice.  This would hold a lot of 
                  Twizzlers.

      Fred isn t sure if Henry is kidding.  He laughs.  So does 
      Henry.  Who then immediately goes back to business.

                                HENRY (CONT D)
                Are dogs allowed in the building?

                                FRED
                No pets.  

                                HENRY
                What about guide dogs?  There's a 
                penal code law that says you have to 
                allow them.

                                FRED
                      (with a smile)
                Then I guess we're going to allow 
                them.  How old are you?  

                                HENRY
                Fourteen and a half.  
                      (fair is fair)
                How old are you?  

                                FRED
                  Forty-three.  
                      (off Henry's skeptical look)
                And a half. 

      Satisfied, Henry flips the switch and tests the garbage disposal.


      Mel, dressed in a suit, deposes a WITNESS.  Mel has him on 
      the ropes as his LAWYER, the STENOGRAPHER and Bill look on.

      Ken comes in and whispers in Mel s ear.

                                KEN
                You got a phone call.  Henry s 
                  principal.  He sounds pretty angry.

      Mel, still in a suit, Henry and Elvis sit with PRINCIPAL 
      SLOAN, 40s, who holds a permission slip like an affidavit.

                T.O. ourselves.

                                HENRY
                The place is great, Dad.  You gotta 
                see it.  I tried to give the guy a 
                  nineteen-dollar deposit, but he 
                wouldn t take it.  

                                MEL
                This is not about the apartment, this 
                is about you just walking off down 
                King Street like the school rules

      He s gone.  Henry leans back in his chair, proud.

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                I was feeling pretty good about myself.  
                I had gotten Dad an apartment and 
                gotten out of the principal s office 
                with very little collateral damage.

      Henry gives the dog the middle finger.

                                MEL
                This is not good.

                      (smiling, confidently)
                Don t worry about it.  Fred and I 
                  connected over Downton Abbey.  That 
                  apartment isn t going anywhere.

                                MEL
                Neither are you.  Your mom s picking 
                you up any minute.

                                HENRY
                You told her?

                Just because Mom and I are getting 
                divorced doesn t mean we re not both 
                still your parents.
                      (getting up)
                We talked and we agree you need to be 
                  punished.  

                                HENRY
                  Punished?  You know, when Bobby 
                Lacito s parents split, he got a 
                Vespa.

                                MEL
                Awesome.  You re grounded for two 
                weeks.  

      Henry sits there, stunned.  Elvis looks over at Henry, 
      cocking his head, as if to gloat.

                                MEL (CONT D)
                I m gonna go snatch that apartment, 
                before your principal makes it his new 
                bachelor pad.  And apparently you re 
                going clothes shopping with Mom and 
                Katie.  Sorry.  You dug your own grave 
                on that one.

      Mel and Ken celebrate with their client Bill.  Beers and 
      snacks are strewn on the GLASS COFFEE TABLE.  

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                So I got my dad a sweet apartment.  
                Where he could celebrate with his 
                  buddies...

                They settled for the full amount.  Who 
                settles for the full amount?!

      They all clank beer bottles.  Elvis barks in camaraderie.

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...and my archenemy...

      Mel rewards Elvis with a potato chip.  

                                MEL
                Bup, bup.  I can lick my own fingers.

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                Me, I was enjoying a two-week 
                  vacation... 


      A defeated Henry sits on a bench outside FOREVER 21, surrounded 
      by bags of lady clothes, playing a game on his phone. 

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...with a couple of teenage girls.

      Katie storms out of the store WEARING ANIMAL PRINT SKINNY JEANS. 

                                KATIE
                How could you buy the same pants as me?!

      Joyce exits wearing the SAME SKINNY JEANS. 

                                JOYCE
                Because they're awesome!  And I didn't 
                get the belt.  Should I have gotten 
                the belt?  Let me try on the belt.

                                KATIE
                No!    ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           22


                                JOYCE
                Button, who looks hotter in these 
                jeans, your mother or your sister?

      Henry s cell phone rings.  The Caller ID says,  Dad.   

                                HENRY
                I gotta take this, it s my therapist.
                      (into phone)
                Hey, Dad.

                                MEL (ON PHONE)
                I need you to come over right away.  
                And bring bacon bits.

      Henry s confused.


      Remnants from the party are in the background.  Mel paces.

                                MEL
                Elvis got out.


      Henry, Katie and Joyce, pipe in hand, have joined Mel.

                                MEL
                ...And when I went to get his food 
                from the pantry, I must have left the 
                front door open--  

                                JOYCE
                This place is great.  Is that fridge 
                  Sub-Zero?!

                                MEL
                How  bout we find the missing dog, 
                then check out the appliances?

      As Joyce packs her pipe, Katie grabs her keys.

                                KATIE
                      (to Henry, sotto)
                I ll drive with Sherlock, you take 
                Magoo.

      Henry, Joyce and Katie start to head down the hall.

                                MEL
                Henry.    ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           23


      Henry turns to see his dad standing with his left arm out.  
      Henry s needed again.  With renewed purpose, he assumes his 
      position on Mel s left side and proudly leads him out the door.


      Katie s at the wheel, Joyce is sitting shotgun, currently 
      using her nervous mom imaginary steering wheel and brake.  

                                KATIE
                That s ridiculous.  Elvis was not 
                  kidnapped!

                                JOYCE
                He s a beautiful dog.  A lot better 
                looking than that Anthony Hooper.

                                KATIE
                Just look for him.

                                JOYCE
                Elvis!  Here boy!  If we find him, 
                make sure you don t run him over with 
                the car.

                                KATIE
                Don t kill Dad s guide dog.  Got it.

                                JOYCE
                      (shaking her head)
                There s that Pinkberry.

                                KATIE
                      (at her breaking point)
                What are we doing?!

                                JOYCE
                What do you mean?  We re looking for 
                Elvis.

                                KATIE
                But why?  Why does Dad have a guide 
                dog?  Why does he have an apartment?  
                Why are you dressed like me?!


      Things are even more heated between Katie and Joyce.    

                                KATIE
                ...But you had your chance to be a 
                  teenager!

                                JOYCE
                That's just it, I didn't.  I went from 
                being someone s daughter to being 
                  someone s wife to being someone s 
                mother-- 

                                KATIE
                Well, I would like to be someone's 
                  daughter.  Can we make that happen?!

                                JOYCE
                I ll tell you what, after we find 
                Elvis, you and I, we ll go to 
                  Starbucks, and just taaalk and taaaalk 
                and talk.

                                KATIE
                No!  God, no!

                                JOYCE
                I just think that we should--

      Katie lays on the horn to drown out whatever idea Joyce s 
      about to pitch.


      Mel, arm in arm with Henry, Katie and Joyce return.  No Elvis.  

                                KATIE
                Okay, so I ll post it on Facebook....  
                      (to Mel)
                Any chance you took a picture of Elvis?

                                MEL
                I ll just call the Guide Dog 
                  Foundation and tell them what 
                  happened.  I can t be the first blind 
                guy to lose a dog.
                      (then)
                Henry, hand me the phone.

      Henry picks up the cordless phone and hands it to Mel.  As 
      Mel dials, Henry notices Elvis s dog bowl by his feet.    

                                HENRY
                      (to Katie and Joyce)
                That s weird, it s still full.

                                MEL
                      (on phone)
                Yes, hello.  Jeffrey Harawitz s office 
                please.

                                HENRY
                What dog takes off when there s a full 
                bowl of food?

                                JOYCE
                      (through a sneeze attack)
                One-- that was-- kidnapped.

      Henry looks over to see Joyce sneezing right near...

                                HENRY
                The pantry!

      Henry opens the door to find Elvis!  Who rushes out, tail 
      wagging.  Henry, Katie and Joyce cheer.  

                                MEL
                Guys, guys, I'm on the phone.
                      (into phone)
                Mr. Harawitz, there s no easy way to 
                tell you this--      ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           28


                                KATIE
                Dad, Henry found Elvis!  

      Elvis barks.  And jumps up on Mel.  

                                MEL
                      (into phone, seamless)
                  ...Thanks again for the great dog.  Keep 
                up the good work.  Let s talk soon.

      Mel hangs up and turns to Henry.

                                MEL (CONT D)
                You do realize you re my favorite son.  
                And not just because I only have one.

      As Henry and Katie give Elvis water, Joyce crosses to Mel.

                                JOYCE
                Melvin Fisher.  You still surprise me.  
                I know what you did.  And it was very 
                sweet.

      Mel listens to make sure the kids are out of earshot.

                                MEL
                I don t know what you re talking about.

                                JOYCE
                Jeffrey Harawitz?  Your freshman 
                roommate is now the head of the Guide 
                Dog Foundation?  

                                MEL
                He s always loved animals.

                                JOYCE
                You put Elvis in the pantry.  It s 
                just like what you did on our first 
                date.  Going to the museum the day 
                before with your brother and 
                  memorizing the paintings.  
                      (as Mel)
                 Louis the fourteenth was very proud 
                of his legs and thus they re featured 
                  prominently in all his portraits.  

                                MEL
                      (proud)
                That comment got me a second date.
                      (then, re: Henry)
                You said he needed to be needed.  

      She puts her hand on Mel s arm.    ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           29


                                MEL (CONT D)
                Maybe two divorced people can keep a 
                little secret?  

      She squeezes his arm.  We PULL OUT TO REVEAL Katie has 
      witnessed this exchange.  

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                Katie only told me what Dad did much 
                later.  Like I said, he never lied, 
                but he did trick us a lot.

      As Mel and Joyce join Katie, Henry and Elvis:

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                When people say  seeing eye dog,  
                they re wrong...


      Mel, Henry, Katie and a sneezing Joyce stand together, eating 
      Chinese take-out as Elvis devours his bowl of food.  

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...While at first I thought Elvis was 
                breaking our family up, it turns out 
                that big ball of fur was really 
                bringing us closer together...   


      Mel and Elvis stand at the doorway saying goodbye to everyone.  

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...The divorce would allow all of us 
                to finally discover who we needed to 
                be.  For Mom...


      A ball rolls into frame.  

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...For Dad, this would be the 
                  beginning of an amazing journey...  

      As Elvis is about to get the ball, Henry grabs it, and he and 
      Mel play  keep away  the way they played football before.

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...As much as his pride didn t want 
                him to admit to the world he was 
                blind, it was even more important for 
                him to be a good father...

                                MEL
                Hey, I got you something.

      Mel feels for something on the empty table.  Henry sees an 
      envelope sitting on the mantle that says,  Henry.   Henry 
      quietly takes the envelope and puts it on the coffee table for 
      Mel to  find.   He does.  Mel hands it to Henry.  Outside, 
      there s a LONG CAR HORN.  They share a laugh.

                                MEL (CONT D)
                Don't let them kill each other.

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...At the time, I would have changed 
                just about everything that was 
                  happening...

      Henry quickly hugs Mel and exits with the envelope.  


      Henry stops, opens the envelope and reaches in. 

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...But looking back... 

      He pulls out a key marked  Henry s.   

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...I wouldn t change a thing...       ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           31


      He clenches it in his hand and looks back at the apartment, 
      beaming.  Just then, Elvis scampers out, eager to say goodbye.  

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...I learned something that I would 
                have to learn over and over again...

                                HENRY
                      (calling back to Mel)
                Guide dog out here!

      He gets down on one knee and gives Elvis a proper hug goodbye.

                                ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
                ...That more often than not, the tough 
                things that happen in life often make 
                way for greater things than you could 
                possibly imagine. 

      Henry turns to see the most beautiful fourteen-year-old GIRL 
      he s ever seen opening the door to the apartment next door.

                                GIRL
                Do you live here?  

      He looks at the key and then back at her.

                                HENRY
                Yeah.  I guess I do.

                                GIRL
                      (petting Elvis)
                You re lucky your dad s blind.
                      (off Henry s confused look)
                They don t let us have dogs in the 
                  building.

      An awkward beat, then: 

                                HENRY
                My mom smokes a pipe.

                                GIRL
                What?

                                HENRY
                I just want you to know everything.

      She smiles.

                                GIRL
                I m Jenny.

      Henry smiles.  Until... CRASH!     ...Then Came Elvis          Third Network Draft        1/21/13           32

                I gotta go.

      As Henry runs back in the apartment, we...
