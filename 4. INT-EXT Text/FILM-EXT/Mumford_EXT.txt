A freight truck of late 1950's vintage pulls to the side of
the road in a small rural town. A handsome, well-built man
gets out of the passenger side and thanks the Driver. THE
NEWCOMER carries his coat over his shoulder and a beat-up
suitcase; he's got a jut jaw and a modified pompadour, his
shirtsleeves are rolled all the way up past his biceps. He
wipes his brow against the sweltering heat and looks around.
[Until noted below, this section of the movie is in BLACK &
WHITE.]
FOLLETT (V.O.)
I get outta the truck in this two-
bit town. I got no money and no
prospects. What I need right now is
a stiff drink, a cold shower, and a
hot broad. I'll take 'em in any order
they come...
Old three story gothic house in ill-repair beyond a peeling
picket fence and a scruffy yard. The sign says -- ROOMS TO
RENT. The Newcomer goes in the gate.
FOLLETT (V.O.)
...Oh yeah, one other thing I need --
an angle.
He squints through the dirty screen door but sees nothing,
then knocks and turns away to survey the neighborhood.
FOLLETT (V.O.)
I was thinking -- if it weren't for
bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck
at all...
LANDLADY (O.S.)
Can I help you?
The Newcomer turns toward the door. Standing there, holding
the screen open, is the LANDLADY. She's a knockout in a cheap,
small-town way: a cotton dress that buttons down the front
and clings with sweat to her generous curves.
FOLLETT (V.O.)
Either my luck had just changed, or
Fate just bought me another round of
trouble.
The last rays of sun are fighting their way through the trees
as Mumford comes up the trail he clearly knows very well.
Mumford climbs out on the Big Rock, settles himself on the
edge and takes a long drink from a water bottle.
WHAT HE SEES: far below at the foot of these hills, lights
just twinkling on, is the town of Mumford. He stares at it
for several long moments. Then he takes a small headlamp
from his pack and fits the straps over his head (it looks
like a miner's light). He twists the light on to test it and
turns his head to watch the beam move about.
WE CUT BACK WIDE. After a beat, Mumford settles back and
turns off the light.
Mumford hurries up the sidewalk carrying two grocery bags.
He's late. The modest houses are close together on this pretty
street, which rises out of the main business district, seen
beyond Mumford.
Mumford comes to the house where he lives. He heads down the
driveway toward the stairs that lead up to his apartment.
The front yard is completely fenced. Lily, the owner of the
restaurant, is almost visible in there working among the
greenery of a lush garden. Her friendly dog, AINGE, sees
Mumford, leaps easily over the fence and does a circle around
Mumford, who has no free hand to pet him.
MUMFORD
How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
LILY
Doc.
(doesn't look up)
Ainge...
The dog leaps gracefully back into the yard. Mumford hurries
up the stairs.
Mumford is walking up the busy sidewalk carrying his new 5-
foot stepladder hooked on his shoulder. Folks greet him.
Suddenly Lionel appears in front of Mumford, who stops.
MUMFORD
Hello, Lionel.
LIONEL
You've got to have the right ladder
for the job. You don't know what
you're doing, you can get yourself
in trouble.
MUMFORD
You're right, as usual. See you.
Mumford continues up the street. We STAY WITH Lionel, who
watches Mumford with a sour look, then turns to enter a small
medical building.
Idyllic. The beautifully manicured field is surrounded by
lush woods. Standing about forty feet apart, Mumford and
Skip are alone on the field throwing a baseball back and
forth. For quite a while the only sounds are the birds, the
wind, and the regular SLAP of ball into glove. Finally --
SKIP
This is great!
SLAP... SLAP.
SKIP
This is exactly what I wanted.
SLAP... SLAP.
MUMFORD
Skip, you must have lots of people
you can throw a ball with.
SKIP
You'd be surprised. Most guys have
kids or wives or girlfriends. They're
busy. It's not as easy as you think.
MUMFORD
Skip, you're the head of the whole
deal here. Are they busier than you?
SKIP
Well, you know... that's the thing.
Like I said, just about everybody in
town works for me. And it's just not
the same asking someone to throw a
ball when they work for you. It's
like an order or something... And no
one -- no one -- asks me.
Mumford considers. SLAP... SLAP... SLAP.
MUMFORD
So, would you say we're out here...
let me think how to put this... Is
your problem really that you're...
lonely?
SKIP
Don't you like this?
MUMFORD
Hell yes, I like it. What's better
than this? Most guys would kill just
to have someone do this with them
whenever they like.
SKIP
Okay then.
(SLAP... SLAP)
Have you got a lot of friends?
MUMFORD
("nope")
Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily,
runs the coffee shop?
SKIP
No... I've seen her. Good-looking
woman.
MUMFORD
(agrees)
She's probably ten years older than
you.
SKIP
(SLAP... SLAP)
Good-looking woman.
MUMFORD
Lives downstairs from me. She's got
a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
SKIP
(sparks to that)
Really? I'm the only person I know
that likes Danny Ainge, outside of
Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
MUMFORD
Well, there's Lily.
SKIP
Did you know that Danny Ainge was
drafted by the Blue Jays? Do you
know what kind of athlete you have
to be to play in the NBA and in the
bigs?
MUMFORD
Amazing.
SKIP
Unbelievable...
(SLAP... SLAP)
...And Lily named her dog after him?
Far out.
MUMFORD
What kind of person do you have to
be to do this?
Mumford gestures off in the one direction we have not yet
seen.
SKIP
What?
MUMFORD
This --
CUT TO:
REVERSE ANGLE: The baseball diamond is sitting in the vast,
lush grounds behind the PANDA MODEM WORLD HEADQUARTERS, a
brand new, distinctively original, high-tech office park.
Wherever there is an opportunity for tasteful signage, it is
in the motif of a Giant Panda -- sweet white face, black
eyes and ears, round body.
Skip is suddenly self-conscious, embarrassed.
SKIP
I would've traded any of it to have
made the Mumford High varsity.
Mumford takes that in. SLAP... SLAP.
SKIP
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient
of yours. He's my pharmacist.
MUMFORD
Yeah.
(SLAP... SLAP)
Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
Skip is a little surprised to hear this from Mumford, but he
just throws the ball.
MUMFORD
Pretty good, too. Lots of detail.
Nothing hard core. Old-fashioned
ones, from back when people cared
about atmosphere and character.
SKIP
Uh-huh.
MUMFORD
Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot
better than his real one. Nothing
can live up to it. His wife got sick
of it and left him. Took his kids
with her.
SKIP
I wondered what happened to her...
Skip is fascinated, but a little uncomfortable. Mumford seems
oblivious, unusually talkative --
MUMFORD
Of course, it's not that simple.
There's something powerful going on
there. We've got a lot of work to
do.
(announcer voice)
It's hit to the warning track!
For the first time, Mumford throws the ball way high, like a
long fly ball. Skip, delighted as a dog, takes off running
and just barely catches it on the run. He pegs it back to
Mumford.
MUMFORD
In these fantasies, Henry Follett is
played by a handsome guy with biceps.
Can you imagine that? Where your
self-esteem has to be?
(throws him the ball)
Man, I'd just like to move the guy
to the point where he gets to appear
in his own fantasies.
A taxi drops Mumford in front of the Brockett's large and
beautiful house, which sits on an isolated lot on the
outskirts of town.
They come out onto the wide porch, which commands a
spectacular view of the surrounding countryside. There's an
elaborate bar cart out here, which Althea points Mumford
toward.
ALTHEA
I'm awful I know, but will you please
help yourself. I just got a new copper
sauciere from Williams-Sonoma and
I'm afraid it'll be the death of us
all if I don't get back in there...
She disappears inside with a bang of the screen door. Mumford
gets a drink for himself, taking in the view. He sees
something out there.
MUMFORD'S POV: Way in the distance, coming out of the woods
and down toward the house is a teenage boy.
KATIE (O.S.)
You're the doctor, aren't you?
Mumford turns to see that Althea's thirteen year old daughter
KATIE has silently appeared. Her jeans and little tee-shirt
are meant to be sexy; it seems sad on her. Mumford nods.
MUMFORD
You must be Katie. People call me
Doc.
KATIE
(motioning urgently)
C'mere. Quick... c'mon!
Mumford follows as she disappears around the corner of the
porch.
Just as Mumford and Katie come back around the corner, MARTIN,
Althea's sixteen year old son, crosses the yard and comes up
onto the porch. He's wearing an old black leather jacket
with a lot of zippers, dirty jeans and black Converse All-
Stars that are coming apart. In his hand, casually but
properly held, is a .22 caliber rifle. He looks Mumford over.
MARTIN
Is this him?
KATIE
(nods)
I showed him.
MARTIN
(to Mumford)
Do you get it now? This is no joke.
Mumford takes them both in and nods. He understands. Suddenly,
their manner changes, for the worse. What they can see that
Mumford cannot is JEREMY BROCKETT, Althea's husband, who has
come to the back screen door, with the bustle of a late
arrival.
JEREMY
Hey, kids. Oh, hi.
Seeing Mumford, Jeremy steps out onto the porch to shake his
hand. Jeremy is quite handsome and a fantastic dresser; his
Armani outfit cost $4200 all in. His tone: hearty and strained --
JEREMY
You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford.
Jeremy Brockett.
MUMFORD
Doc. Nice to meet you.
JEREMY
Sorry I'm late... traffic was a
motherfucker. Have another drink,
I'll be back in five.
Jeremy goes inside. Martin and Katie exchange a look with
each other, then to Mumford. Martin goes inside.
DISSOLVE TO:
LATER. Dinner is over. Jeremy comes out onto the veranda
carrying two Cuban cigars. His casual outfit is as stylish
and pricey as his work outfit. He joins Mumford and Althea,
who immediately gets up.
ALTHEA
I'll be back.
She goes inside. The men each have a snifter of cognac. Jeremy
makes a ceremony of cutting the cigars --
JEREMY
I think you'll like this. Know much
about Cuban cigars?
MUMFORD
Nope.
Jeremy puts the cigars down, pulls a joint out of his cashmere
pullover and fires it up. After exhaling a huge cloud of
smoke, he offers the joint to Mumford, who declines.
JEREMY
Makes the whole thing that much
better.
Jeremy takes another hit on the joint and puts it down. He
gives a cigar and his gold lighter to Mumford, who begins to
light up --
JEREMY
Just hold the flame a little bit
below the end... that's it... now
just turn it slowly as you draw...
Mumford does as he's told. Jeremy lights his own cigar.
JEREMY
Are you a man who likes to treat
himself right?
MUMFORD
I've had my moments.
JEREMY
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it.
Nobody ever said on their death bed --
"I treated myself too well."
MUMFORD
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said,
"I should have spent more time at
the office."
JEREMY
Fill in the blank. I don't mind the
office. The point is, you only go
'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be
here now.
MUMFORD
What do you do?
JEREMY
Althea hasn't told you?
MUMFORD
(no)
We've been talking about her, mostly.
JEREMY
Well, in '85 four of us left our
firms and formed an investment banking
venture. We've got twenty-three people
working there now.
MUMFORD
You've done well.
The marijuana is kicking in now -- Jeremy gets a self-
satisfied, condescending look on his face that no straight
mind would dare. His response includes their lavish immediate
surroundings--
JEREMY
We've done... very well. You know
anything about addiction, Doc?
MUMFORD
A little.
JEREMY
Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say
when you're in the red zone, you
gotta score.
(watches Mumford smoke)
So what do you think?
MUMFORD
Tastes good.
JEREMY
No... I mean about Althea. About
her...
(makes a face)
...behavior. Do you think you can
fix her up?
MUMFORD
What do you think's wrong with her?
JEREMY
She's gone weird is what's wrong
with her. Out of control. Probably
from living out here in Mayberry.
Jeremy blows cigar smoke into his snifter, then takes a
mouthful of cognac, savoring the sensations. Mumford watches,
fascinated by this guy.
JEREMY
You're the doctor, what do you think?
MUMFORD
She seems very unhappy.
Jeremy gives him a look, as if to say "duh."
JEREMY
I think we all knew that, professor.
The question... the real --
(drawn out, stoned)
-- quest-tio-nee... is... why?
Mumford looks at him a long time.
Jeremy Brockett's Mercedes 500 SL whips around a curve.
Lily is walking Ainge as the Mercedes pulls up and Mumford
gets out. Ainge runs happily around the car and puts his
paws up on the driver's door to greet Martin; we HEAR the
clicking SCRATCH of his nails on the surface. Martin rubs
the dog's head.
LILY
Ainge!
MARTIN
That's okay. Jeremy won't mind. Good
dog.
LILY
Ainge!
The dog obediently leaves Martin and runs back to Lily.
Mumford waves as Martin pulls away.
LILY
(to Ainge)
Do we run into the street? No, I
didn't think so.
(looks after Martin)
Nice car. How's that place?
MUMFORD
It's a pretty piece of land.
They walk up the block with the dog.
LILY
And the Brocketts?
MUMFORD
Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
LILY
It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call
in the National Guard.
(he nods)
Then I did my laundry... watched
20/20.
MUMFORD
...And?
LILY
Shocking. Did you know the government
is wasteful?
(Mumford reacts)
You heard it here first. Oh, and
being a supermodel... it's no walk
in the park.
MUMFORD
Why do you watch?
LILY
No gentleman caller, Doc.
(they turn back)
Not that I care. I've had it with
men. They're so fascinated by their
own crap. Took me four years to get
the last one out. Almost turned me
into a dyke... These days my idea of
a hot date is a long shower by myself
before bed. Now that feels good. And
you don't have to do all that...
listening.
Mumford laughs.
LILY
Oops... sorry. I guess that's the
story of your life.
Mumford comes out the front door and holds it open for Sofie.
He offers his arm and she takes it tentatively.
SOFIE
I'm not making any promises.
MUMFORD
We'll turn back anytime you want.
SOFIE
(seeing something)
Oh boy... this should be interesting.
Mumford looks out toward the street. A woman in her fifties
is turning into the front walk. She stares at them, unsmiling,
as the two parties converge. She is MRS. COOK.
SOFIE
Hello, Mother. I want you to meet
Dr. Mumford.
MRS. COOK
Mumford... like the town?
MUMFORD
(offering his hand)
Yes. It's nice to meet you, Mrs.
Cook.
She finally takes his hand, but it's not friendly.
MRS. COOK
What's happening here?
SOFIE
We're going for a walk.
MRS. COOK
Do you think that's a good idea?
SOFIE
Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself
completely in his hands. For today,
anyway.
MRS. COOK
What kind of doctor are you?
MUMFORD
Ph.D., psychologist.
MRS. COOK
Oh... not a real doctor.
MUMFORD
That's right, the fake kind.
Mrs. Cook is not amused. Sofie pulls on Mumford.
SOFIE
We'd better go or I'm liable to bail
on the whole thing.
Mrs. Cook steps aside as they move up the walk.
Mumford and Sofie, foreground, walk slowly up the block. In
the background, Mrs. Cook watches for awhile before going
inside.
SOFIE
Mom's such a cutie.
MUMFORD
People usually have to get to know
me before they hate me.
SOFIE
She's not in a bad mood. She's like
that all the time.
(a beat)
It doesn't bother me anymore. It's
my dad and my brother I worry about.
MUMFORD
Maybe... but you're the one whose
ass is dragging.
SOFIE
(laughs)
Is that the technical description of
what I've got?
MUMFORD
Is she against you getting help?
SOFIE
We don't discuss it.
MUMFORD
Something's bothering her.
SOFIE
Oh, we've all disappointed her. Me,
especially, but Dad, of course. She
thinks my brother's all right, but
she didn't expect much. It's what
happens when you "marry beneath
yourself"...
Sofie suddenly seems to be fading.
MUMFORD
Please... forgive me.
SOFIE
What?
MUMFORD
Negative thinking makes everything
more difficult. If you're going to
have enough strength to do this, we
have to talk only about positive
things. All right?
She looks at him, unsure if he's serious. It seems so corny.
But she agrees.
MUMFORD
Okay then... Are you positive your
mother's a bitch?
(she laughs, surprised)
Just kidding.
SOFIE
You've got a funny idea of funny.
MUMFORD
(seems worried)
I've offended you!
SOFIE
No.
MUMFORD
Really? What would it take?
She laughs again; surprised again. He's got her off balance
makes a "rim shot" sound.
SOFIE
Is this the treatment?
MUMFORD
Sorry... I'm done.
SOFIE
'Cause I'll tell you, none of the
others have tried this approach.
They've come to the corner. He gestures to ask -- "shall we
cross?" She considers for quite a while, gauging her strength,
then, still on his arm, steps off the curb --
SOFIE
(absurdly unconvincing)
Hey, 'Just do it!'
THEY CROSS OUT OF FRAME as we HEAR:
MUMFORD (O.S.)
I want you to tell me all your
symptoms.
ANOTHER DAY. They're dressed differently. Sofie seems more
vigorous.
SOFIE
I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
MUMFORD
Be specific.
SOFIE
Well... I'm tired all the time,
obviously. I always feel like taking
a nap. But when I try to sleep, I
have trouble.
(Mumford nods)
My muscles ache. And my joints. I
feel like an old person, or like I
did back when I used to work out too
hard... What else?...
Sofie nods.
MUMFORD
Painful lymph glands?
(yes)
Forget fulness... irritability...
depression?
SOFIE
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also...
I get confused.
MUMFORD
Yeah, most people have that. It's
confusing here.
SOFIE
Where?
MUMFORD
Life.
ANOTHER DAY. Mumford is leading Sofie through the lightest
set of calisthenics ever devised. Now they're doing waist
bends and arm waving. Even so, it's taking everything Sofie's
got.
SOFIE
I don't know if I mentioned the
headaches.
MUMFORD
Did you get headaches before this?
(Sofie: yes)
But you get more now? Or more severe?
SOFIE
No, not really. They're about the
same. My marriage was one long
headache.
MUMFORD
So the headaches may not even be a
part of this?
She considers that, reluctantly agrees.
MUMFORD
I can give myself a headache
instantly.
SOFIE
Is that like a party trick?
MUMFORD
All I have to do is have two
conflicting thoughts at the same
time... Like I'll think -- 'Taking
these walks is going to help Sofie
get better.' But then I'll also think --
'Mumford, you just enjoy taking these
walks and you're kidding yourself
about the benefits.'
Sofie's not sure how to take that. She looks away.
MUMFORD
There... I've given myself a real
whopper.
SOFIE
You actually address yourself by
name in your thoughts?
(Mumford laughs)
So you really think having two
opposing ideas in your head does
some kind of damage?
MUMFORD
Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two
different directions at once. It
makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
SOFIE
Well then, my life has been some
kind of huge rip.
Mumford strides up the trail on his late day excursion. He
comes around a bend and is surprised to find Skip waiting
for him, looking serious.
MUMFORD
Hey, Skip.
SKIP
Doc. I know we're not supposed to
get together till Wednesday...
MUMFORD
That's all right. What's on your
mind?
Mumford indicates that Skip should walk with him up the trail.
SKIP
How many sessions have we had now,
Doc?
(Mumford tries to
remember)
Six. And it's been good... like we
were two buddies hanging out. Just
shootin' the shit.
MUMFORD
Yep.
They walk in silence for a while.
SKIP
This is really hard. Everything I
want to say is hard...
Mumford and Skip come out of the trees, climb onto the big
rock, and settle down. The sun is falling over the town of
Mumford.
SKIP
...We're like friends, almost... who
trust each other.
He checks Mumford's reaction. Mumford nods, offers Skip water,
who turns it down. Mumford takes a swig.
SKIP
I want to tell you something, Doc,
but before I do, I need to ask you a
question... Because, for me to tell
you this thing -- well, I haven't
told anybody about this. It's the
biggest secret I've got.
MUMFORD
Sometimes it's best to keep a few
things just for ourselves.
SKIP
You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I
supposed to be able to tell you
everything?
MUMFORD
It's just a thought.
Skip, even more unsure now, looks away, at the town below.
SKIP
That really relates to the thing I
want to ask you... I've noticed that
sometimes, not a lot, but sometimes,
when we're hanging out, throwin' the
ball... or that time we went
bowling... sometimes you'll like --
(gets it out fast --)
-- tell me things about your other
patients.
Mumford lets that hang a few moments, then acknowledges it
silently. Now Skip is even more nervous.
SKIP
Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't
know all that much about psychology
or therapy or... ethics, so maybe
there's something I missed... or
something...
MUMFORD
You're concerned that maybe I can't
be trusted with a secret.
SKIP
I trust you. Definitely. No question.
But, yeah, I'm a little concerned. I
mean, you're not supposed to tell
anyone about your patients'
problems... are you?
Mumford looks at Skip for a long moment.
MUMFORD
That is correct, Skip. I'm going to
have to take a long look at that.
The conversation seems to end there. Skip's not sure where
to go next. Finally --
SKIP
Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell
you --
MUMFORD
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about
me --
SKIP
Doc, I trust you! You've listened to
me better than anybody... maybe ever.
(leans in, intense)
And this secret I've got, I can't
stand it anymore. I don't know if
I'm some kind of --
Skip looks around at the darkening woods, though clearly
there's no one around.
SKIP
-- I don't know if I'm a pervert or
what. It's taken me this long to get
where I can come out and say it... I
can't back away now. I can't spend
another day not knowing if I'm nuts.
Skip closes his eyes for a second and gathers himself.
SKIP
All right, I'm just gonna tell you,
as simple and direct as I can.
(one last spasm of
doubt)
And you understand that this is a
big secret? Just between us?
(Mumford does)
Okay. You know I've got this gift
for certain kinds of... machines.
MUMFORD
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
SKIP
That's right. And you also know that
even though I make 23% of the modems
in the world... I cannot make one
simple connection with any woman who
could truly love me.
MUMFORD
Okay... let's say that, for now.
SKIP
It's true, believe me. So... do you
know what I've been doing, all alone,
in my workshop, for almost two
years?... Mr. Find-the-Need-and-Fill-
It. How I spend my every solitary
hour?
Mumford shakes his head, "no."
SKIP
Guess.
(Mumford demurs)
Go ahead, guess!
MUMFORD
(if he must)
Jerking off?
SKIP
No!... Although that's a good guess.
No, what I've been working on, what
the world really needs and no one
has been able to create --
(leans in, whispering)
-- a virtually life-like, humanoid,
gender-specific, anatomically
functional... sexual surrogate slash
companion.
Mumford tries to put that all together. Finally --
MUMFORD
Slash what?
SKIP
Sexual surrogate... slash...
companion.
MUMFORD
A doll?
SKIP
No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm
talking about much, much more than a
doll. The world has never seen what
I'm talking about... except maybe in
the movies.
Mumford considers that a long time, watching as the sun
finally sinks below the horizon. He looks back at Skip.
MUMFORD
How's it coming?
SKIP
You don't think I'm insane?
MUMFORD
("no")
And that's your secret?
(Skip: "yes")
You meant -- like a trade secret?
SKIP
No, Doc, a private secret! It's
perverted, it's pitiful. What am I --
Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
MUMFORD
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
SKIP
(nonplussed)
Really?
MUMFORD
Definitely.
It's getting dark fast now. Mumford reaches into his bag and
takes out the headlamp we saw earlier. He fits the straps
carefully over his head.
MUMFORD
Skip, that's not much of a secret.
SKIP
(hurt)
It's not?
MUMFORD
Oh, it's okay. It's just not something
to be ashamed of. Maybe you don't
want people knowing -- and believe
me, it's safe with me -- but on the
scale of dirty little secrets, I'd
give it, say... a two.
Mumford twists the headlamp and the light shines out in the
dusk. Mumford turns the beam directly at Skip.
MUMFORD
You want to know a secret? I'll tell
you a secret. Since it's just between
us and all...
Skip, hanging on every word now, agrees emphatically.
MUMFORD
The secret, Skip, is this -- I am
not now, nor have I ever been... a
psychologist.
At first, Skip thinks he's misunderstood Mumford. But in the
huge silence that ensues, he replays it and knows he's heard
right. Mumford looks around, adjusts his headlamp, and gets
up.
MUMFORD
We'd better get going. Just follow
my light. And, Skip, watch your step.
This porch is directly above Lily's porch. Mumford and Skip
sit nursing beers. There's a cooler on the floor. Mumford's
legs are propped up on the porch railing
SKIP
Who else knows?
MUMFORD
Just you.
SKIP
It's time you did some talkin', Dr.
Mum -- Wait a minute. That is your
name, isn't it?
Mumford takes a drink of beer.
SKIP
Damn! What is your name?
MUMFORD
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
SKIP
It matters to me.
Mumford gestures: "sorry, no can do."
SKIP
I've told you a lot of private stuff.
MUMFORD
I can tell you anything else.
SKIP
What about everything? How did this
happen?
Mumford looks at Skip, considering. He takes a long pull
from his beer, then looks at the frosty bottle.
MUMFORD
Did you know that every species of
mammal has found some way to drug,
inebriate, or anestnetize itself?
Even if it's just banging its head
against a rock. Seems to be some
natural urge... to get away for a
while.
(one more look at
Skip)
I've had it for as long as I can
remember. The first place I wanted
out of was home...
AS MUMFORD TALKS we SEE IMAGES FROM HIS PAST, all FROM
MUMFORD'S POV. We do not see him in the scenes. Instead,
everyone else in the scene RELATES TO THE CAMERA AS MUMFORD,
even if they're just ignoring him.
MAGIC
MOVING FAST (MUMFORD'S CHILDHOOD POV) toward the back door
of a rundown, little house in a poor mining community. We
reach the back door and bang inside --
FROM INSIDE A HELMET: the brutal chaos of crashing bodies in
a Friday night high school football game. Mumford is violently
hit. Our view is smashed so deep into the muddy turf that
again the IMAGE GOES BLACK, then quickly FADES UP AGAIN on --
TIGHT ON A CAN OF "IRON CITY" BEER in MUMFORD'S POV as he
puts it on the roof of a green Nash Rambler and ducks into
the back seat. In the shadows is a teen-age girl, MUMFORD'S
DATE. As Mumford moves toward her, she flames a Bic lighter
and gleefully lights a fat joint; her blouse is unbuttoned
and gaping.
MUMFORD (V.O.)
On the other hand, it made some of
my classmates like me better... I
don't know what it was in me, maybe
some genes from my mom, maybe some
discomfort with myself, but early on
I was drawn to any substance that
made me numb...
Graduation Ceremonies. MUMFORD'S POV moving across a platform
toward the diploma being proffered by the PRINCIPAL. PAN TO
Mumford's Parents, dressed up and proud, in the audience.
MUMFORD (V.O.)
When I got a scholarship to go out
of state to college, I was the first
one in my extended family who'd gone
beyond high school. At graduation,
my folks looked like a normal, happy
couple, which I guess they were about
10% of the time... out in public.
We PAN from the back of a garbage truck to a mess of garbage
containers, and MOVE TOWARD THEM.
BACK TO PRESENT. Skip watches Mumford intently.
MUMFORD
...pizza delivery, pipe fitting,
pest control... lots of jobs that
started with the letter "p". For
some reason, I kept losing these
jobs.
(takes a swig of beer)
The only mind-altering substance I
never had a problem with was alcohol.
I never got drunk. I didn't like the
feeling. But really, when you're as
fucked up as I was... big deal.
Mumford stands up and stretches, then sits on the railing
facing Skip.
MUMFORD
Eventually, doing all these different
jobs, I noticed something. For some
reason, probably because I was too
stoned to talk, everywhere I went --
We see various CO-WORKERS from Mumford's jobs. The
environments are radically different, but the activity is
always the same -- the Co-Worker in question is pouring his
heart out to camera.
MUMFORD (V.O.)
-- people would talk to me, tell me
everything... their stories, their
problems, their innermost thoughts.
Sometimes they'd pretend they needed
advice, but mostly people just wanted
someone to listen.
BACK TO PRESENT. Skip is leaning intensely toward Mumford.
SKIP
-- an investigator for the Internal
Revenue Service?
MUMFORD
Everybody has a story, Skip.
SKIP
Sounds like you have several.
MUMFORD
What it felt like was... a series of
separate, unconnected lives --
hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy,
garbage man, civil service guy...
(Yul Brynner accent)
...et cetera... et cetera. Every
time I'd leave a life, it felt good.
Whatever problems I was having were
suddenly gone. I had no friends and
I didn't talk to my family. The only
constant, stabilizing force in my
life was... drugs.
SKIP
An IRS investigator with a drug
problem?
MUMFORD
It wasn't the best situation.
SKIP
Did you carry a gun?
MUMFORD
Didn't need one. We didn't even need
a warrant for most of the shit we
did. Man, the IRS... we could go in
your bank account, your credit
cards... hell, we used to go into
doctors' files and get all the juicy
details. Nobody wants to argue with
the IRS.
MOVING POV as Mumford follows GREGORY down the gloomy alley
to a corner where they can spy at the scene beyond.
MUMFORD (V.O.)
I got teamed with one of the top
guys, a fanatic named Gregory. He
always got his man, whether they
deserved it or not. He was a "closer"
and everybody admired that...
WHAT THEY SEE: The DRY CLEANING BOSS, a Middle-Eastern fellow,
is standing at the back door of his place paying his Asian
employees in cash as they leave.
MUMFORD (V.O.)
He'd make the case and the Collection
guys would come in and clean up. Our
specialty was... sleazy skulking...
Gregory turns to look at camera (Mumford) with a devilish
grin.
MUMFORD (V.O.)
We were a good team. I was a dope
addict and Gregory was insane.
Mumford settles back in his chair as Skip shakes his head,
astounded.
MUMFORD
(announcer-like)
"Get to know your therapist."
SKIP
You were messed up, man.
MUMFORD
(dry)
But look at me now...
SKIP
Hey, you've done good. Look at
yourself... you've cleaned up, you've
got a career --
Skip stops, remembers the truth, realizes. Mumford smiles.
SKIP
At least you pulled yourself out...
MUMFORD
Things got a lot worse.
SKIP
You and Candy...?
MOVING POV as Mumford follows Gregory up the ladder and onto
the roof of this old building in a rundown industrial
neighborhood.
MUMFORD (V.O.)
The way the District Managers got
ahead and won their bonuses was by
generating maximum payments. That
meant the revenue officers had to
use all their "collection tools" --
seizures, liens, levies -- even if a
more reasonable compromise could
have been worked out. The best way
to reduce resistance from the
taxpayers was to build a convincing
case -- whether there'd actually
been a violation or not...
Mumford follows Gregory, crawling, to the edge of the roof
and looks down on a building one block over. It is a small
furniture factory. Employees are eating their lunches on the
loading dock.
MUMFORD (V.O.)
That's where we came in. Our DM was
a particular sonuvabitch, and he
knew just how to get Gregory crazy.
BINOCULAR VIEW of EDMOND WORRELL and MRS. WORRELL as they
get in a Cadillac at the end of a workday.
MUMFORD (V.O.)
...and his family.
MOVING POV OUT THE WINDSHIELD of Gregory's government car as
it comes speeding into the parking lot. There are two flashing
Squad Cars and an Ambulance at the entrance. As Gregory's
car hits a speedbump, the IMAGE BEGINS TO SLOW DOWN --
MUMFORD (V.O.)
What none of us down at the Service
knew was that Edmond Worrell had a
story too... Worrell's was that he'd
been fighting chronic depression for
thirty years. Under the heat of the
investigation, he fell off his
medication. One Tuesday morning, he
went down to the factory early, wrote
his family a letter, then used the
9mm automatic they kept there to
kill himself... The DM dropped the
case that day and started proceedings
to get rid of Gregory...
The IMAGE HAS SLOWED TO A STILL. It now DISSOLVES TO:
Mumford's POV as he comes up the steps. The front door opens
before he gets there. Candy, her face bruised, her eyes red,
comes into view, she has a suitcase in hand.
MUMFORD (V.O.)
Gregory went home drunk, beat up
Candy and went out to drink some
more. Candy told me she didn't want
to see me again. She hated us both
and she was leaving us both... It
made perfect sense to me. I felt the
same way...
Skip is staring at Mumford. Empty beer bottles are lined up
on the porch railing.
SKIP
And so you did...
Mumford nods.
SKIP
And the drugs?
MUMFORD
Harder than I thought. Took me three
tries. But I was highly motivated --
figured there was no point in leaving
me and taking that along. After two
bomb-outs, I found a place in the
desert...
Mumford gets up from his chair and moves toward his door.
MUMFORD
...which seemed perfect for starting
something new. Be back.
Mumford goes inside. Skip sits listening to the night. From
downstairs, in Lily's apartment, he HEARS A SHOWER GO ON.
Mumford comes back out.
SKIP
Somebody's taking a shower down there.
MUMFORD
That'd be Lily.
SKIP
I wish I could live in the shower.
I'd take five a day if I had the
time. I went to this spa in Germany,
a sanitarium practically, up on this
mountain. And the great thing --
they just kept you wet all day.
MUMFORD
Who'd you go with?
(Skip: "alone")
That's not good.
SKIP
How'd you do it?
(Mumford is confused)
The new you.
MUMFORD
You know how easy it is. A kid can
manage it if he wants a fake I.D.
You can do practically the whole
deal at your local Kinko's. The only
variable is how much pride you take
in the product.
SKIP
I know it starts with a birth
certificate...
MUMFORD
All new people start with that...
Mumford looks at Skip.
MUMFORD
What about it?
SKIP
"Mumford"... I mean, why pick the
name of the town you were going to?
MUMFORD
Oh. You got it backwards. I already
had the name when I started looking
for somewhere to settle. When I saw
this town on a map, I thought maybe
it was a sign. See...
MUMFORD
In a free society, you are who you
say you are.
(smiling)
People should remember that before
they go around knocking this country.
(he gets up)
Skip, all this beer's got me sleepy.
Skip looks upset.
SKIP
But you studied psychology, right?
You did the training and just never
got the degree?
MUMFORD
No... no training.
SKIP
(hopeful)
Psych major?
MUMFORD
English Lit.
SKIP
Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
MUMFORD
I understand what it's like to want
to leave a problem behind. That's
all most people are looking to do.
(shrugs)
Mainly, I listen.
He heads inside.
SKIP
Where ya going? I've got a million
questions.
MUMFORD
See you Thursday... regular time.
Mumford goes inside. Skip nods, head spinning.
Mumford and Sofie are delivering newspapers in lovely first
light. Mumford has a canvas sack full of newspapers around
his neck. At each house, he consults the list in his hand,
then hands Sofie a rolled-up paper, which she throws -- with
varying success -- toward the front doors. The activity is
tiring for her, but she's committed.
SOFIE
...so we get on this incredible steam
engine train that runs up into the
mountains...
(she tosses a paper,
grunting)
...and this trip is everything it's
cracked up to be... an open car,
great views, the mountain air blowing
through. We're sitting there, married
for six years, and he says how he
likes it better when I put my hair
back...
Mumford hands her another paper, which she heaves with all
her limited strength, missing the front porch badly. Mumford,
who can't get enough of watching her, doesn't notice at first.
SOFIE
That wasn't so good.
Mumford snaps out of it. He goes up on the lawn and flips
the paper deftly onto the porch. As they continue --
MUMFORD
You're doing great.
SOFIE
I don't know if I'm going to make it
the whole way.
MUMFORD
It doesn't matter. Go on.
SOFIE
Oh... this makes me sound irrational,
which is probably right, but there
was something about him saying this --
it was maybe the millionth time he'd
told me about some preference of
his. Well, I was so... tired of it.
(memories)
Seems like my whole life someone's
been telling me... I'm just not
getting it right. Can we rest for a
second?
She leans against the iron handrail on some front steps,
breathing hard.
SOFIE
You're purposely making me talk while
we do this...
(Mumford nods)
...because you think this is good
for me...
(nods again)
...and you're a sadistic bastard...
MUMFORD
Yes.
SOFIE
...who thinks there's nothing really
wrong with me.
MUMFORD
Oh, there's something wrong with
you, all right. Especially after
hearing that dream of yours, about
the Roto-Rooter.
She laughs. They're playing with each other.
SOFIE
That was really bad, wasn't it?
MUMFORD
Disgusting.
SOFIE
And I'll bet you can interpret the
whole thing
MUMFORD
It's pretty obvious to a trained
professional.
Sofie starts walking again, taking another newspaper from
his sack. He points to the next house.
SOFIE
I hate those dreams where everything
means something.
Sofie heaves the paper squarely onto the porch. She turns to
him with pride, but when she sees the way he looks at her,
she glances away, uncomfortable.
MUMFORD
Is that when you split up?
SOFIE
No, that'd be a good story, but that
was just the beginning of the end.
We went on for another year or so.
Mumford hands her another paper and indicates the next house.
SOFIE
So whose route is this?
MUMFORD
Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old.
Lives next door.
SOFIE
And he's where?
MUMFORD
In the capitol for Boy's Nation.
Five days. Why?
SOFIE
(heaves another paper)
I'm thinking a gal could make a good
living doing this. How hard could it
be squeezing out some fourteen year
old?
MUMFORD
You like it?
SOFIE
It's all right.
MUMFORD
Then you can expect me at 5:30
tomorrow morning.
SOFIE
And this is legitimate therapy?
MUMFORD
Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want
to do it alone.
Mumford crosses the street from his office. A huge bus with
"APPLEJACK TOURS" on the sides, is disgorging its passengers,
a large group of elderly JAPANESE WOMEN, all of whom file
neatly into Lily's Caf. Lily stands on the sidewalk outside
greeting them merrily.
MUMFORD
What's the deal?
Lily continues her welcomes, but points out a hand-lettered
sign in her front window -- "Closed for Lunch. See you
tomorrow."
LILY
They come through a few times each
year.
(greeting one cheerily)
Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you
again!
(back to Mumford)
It's a tour.
MUMFORD
Where am I supposed to eat?
LILY
You're on your own today, honey.
Mumford's attention is suddenly drawn to something across
the street. He glances thoughtfully at Lily for a moment,
then back out there.
WHAT HE SEES: Skip is once again zipping down the street on
his skateboard in the midst of traffic. He has not noticed
Mumford.
MUMFORD (O.S.)
Hey, Skip!
Skip looks over, then immediately changes course toward them,
barely checking the surrounding traffic. He is extraordinarily
skillful. When he gets to the curb, he pulls a snazzy board-
flipping maneuver to dismount and come up on the sidewalk.
Some of the Japanese matrons react with delight.
SKIP
Doc.
Skip notices the tour members filing by, but is immediately
distracted by the presence of Lily, who's a little excited
to meet the local celebrity.
MUMFORD
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip,
Lily.
LILY
It's a pleasure to meet you.
SKIP
(flustered)
Yeah... me you, too... I was at your
house...
LILY
Oh?
SKIP
Upstairs, with Doc... Yeah, it's
very nice... I heard your shower.
Skip can't believe what he just said. Neither can the other
two, actually. Mumford can't stop himself from laughing, but
he cuts it off fast. Lily blushes, but Skip's agitation has
charmed her. Something's happening here.
LILY
I've seen you going by on your board,
but I didn't realize -- you're so
young... to be so...
SKIP
What?
MUMFORD
...so rich?
LILY
(gives him a look)
...so accomplished.
SKIP
I may be young, but Doc can tell
you, I'm very immature.
He's making a joke and it represents quite a recovery. They're
all relieved. Then there's an awkward silence. Skip watches
the last of the tour enter the restaurant.
SKIP
So, is this like a Japanese
restaurant?
LILY
I'd better get in there.
SKIP
That's a lot of people all at once.
LILY
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a
choice of three entrees.
SKIP
What are they?
Lily gives him a careful look: Is he really interested?
There's something about him...
LILY
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or
salad nicoise.
SKIP
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
LILY
(giggling)
You do?
SKIP
Yeah.
LILY
Well, come on in.
She motions him in and starts to follow. Mumford makes a
"what about me?" sound. Lily, grinning, just points to the
sign and leaves Mumford standing on the sidewalk.
DELBANCO (O.S.)
Dr. Mumford.
Mumford turns to find Dr. Delbanco and Phyllis Sheeler, the
shrinks Lionel had conferred with, standing nearby. It takes
a moment for Mumford to remember Delbanco. Finally, shaking
hands --
MUMFORD
Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you
again.
DELBANCO
I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler.
She's the other therapist here in
town.
MUMFORD
(shaking her hand)
Of course... I've heard great things
about you.
SHEELER
Thank you.
DELBANCO
You never got back to me.
(Mumford doesn't
understand)
...I called to say we'd like to take
you out for a meal?... Kind of a
professional welcome.
Mumford makes a show of remembering.
MUMFORD
Forgive me, please. What a gracious
thought. We must do that.
SHEELER
When?
MUMFORD
Why don't I call you when I've got
my calendar in front of me?
DELBANCO
What are you doing for lunch?
MUMFORD
Right now?
The other two nod in unison. Mumford considers, trapped.
Mumford carries a large Fed-Ex box down a side street and
into an alley. As he passes a secluded space created by two
adjacent buildings, something catches his eye.
MUMFORD'S MOVING POV: A young couple is embracing and talking
intimately. As they separate, we can see that it is Nessa
and Martin Brockett. Martin sees Mumford, but makes no sign.
Nessa twists to see what Martin's looking at just as the
view is interrupted by a wall.
Mumford walks on, mulling what he's seen.
There is a locked security screen at the alley entrance to
the back room of the pharmacy, but the door inside is open.
When a YOUNG PHARMACIST appears in there, Mumford raps on
the metal screen.
Mumford and Sofie make their way slowly up the trail. Despite
her labored breathing, it's clear Sofie has made enormous
progress since we first saw her.
SOFIE
When I was in high school we used to
come up here and make out. I liked
to sit on the rock and watch the sun
go down.
MUMFORD
That's what I like.
SOFIE
Which thing?
MUMFORD
Either one.
SOFIE
Why'd you come to the house the other
night?
MUMFORD
I thought I had something to tell
you. But it turned out I didn't.
SOFIE
My brother said you were about to
fire me.
MUMFORD
That's one way to put it.
SOFIE
I bet I know what changed your mind...
(Mumford looks at her)
...My mother. She was so horrible,
you decided you couldn't desert me.
MUMFORD
I thought only action movies had
villains like that.
Sofie gestures ahead.
SOFIE
That's the cut-off, isn't it?
(Mumford nods)
I know why you were going to quit
seeing me.
Mumford slows at this. Sofie heads off the trail into the
woods.
Sofie appears first, but she waits for Mumford before she
steps tentatively onto the rock. Mumford takes firm hold of
her and leads her to a spot where she can securely settle
herself.
SOFIE
You feel like a fake, an imposter...
Mumford looks up, sharply.
SOFIE
...as if maybe you don't know what
you're doing.
She puts a hand on his arm.
SOFIE
Everybody feels that way sometimes...
like we're not who we're supposed to
be. But I have to tell you, Dr.
Mumford --
He winces at her formality.
SOFIE
-- you've been a tremendous help to
me.
MUMFORD
Yeah?
SOFIE
I can't tell you how much I admire
you. You have a wonderful way with
people. And you're very insightful.
I feel like you've seen me clearly...
I never used to admit what a horrible
person my mother was. You've made
that possible for me.
MUMFORD
That's... good?
SOFIE
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never
accepted me for who I was, just like
Mother. The things you've said have
helped me understand what a dick he
is.
MUMFORD
I don't know if --
SOFIE
You're shockingly honest, that's
what makes you great. I've never had
a man treat me this way. With you, I
feel really... listened to.
(gives him a look)
Can I tell you something? It's a
little embarrassing, but I feel very
unguarded with you.
MUMFORD
Of course.
SOFIE
Thanks to this therapy, I now know
what I'm looking for. I need to find
a man like you.
(laughs)
Not one who's treating me, of course.
(full of resolve)
And I'm going to do it, dammit! You've
given me the confidence.
Mumford is in agony.
MUMFORD
Sofie... that makes me very happy.
DAY
We (CAMERA) are being pummelled by three SMALL TOWN TOUGHS
behind Old Man Sutter's gas station/diner in the Follett's
fantasy town. [In BLACK & WHITE.] Beyond them, Old Man
Sutter's stacked YOUNG WIFE watches in horror from the
backdoor of the building. We DO NOT SEE The Newcomer yet.
FOLLETT (V.O.)
Old Man Sutter's young bride had got
me in hot water all right, and now I
was bein' dealt the beating of my
life. If there'd just been two of
those bastards it would have been a
little closer...
One of the Toughs winds up and delivers the coup de grace.
CUT TO BLACK, then FADE UP ON:
Mumford comes up the street, lost in thought, and turns into
the driveway toward his stairs. Ainge leaps over the front
yard fence. Mumford pets the dog distractedly, still moving.
MUMFORD
Hey, Ainge.
Lily rises up suddenly from where she's been working in the
garden.
LILY
Doc...
MUMFORD
(keeps walking)
Lily.
LILY
Doc.
Mumford reluctantly stops. Lily comes up to the fence.
LILY
I don't want you to be mad at Skip...
MUMFORD
He told you.
LILY
(yes)
Skip and I wouldn't have got together
if it weren't for you. That's a big
deal.
MUMFORD
(dismisses it)
You would have met in some shower
eventually...
LILY
I want to give you something. Will
you let me?
MUMFORD
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
LILY
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
MUMFORD
(can't fight)
Okay.
LILY
Here it is, some advice -- do the
hard thing.
MUMFORD
That's it? That's what you're giving
me?
LILY
Clean up the mess. No matter what it
takes.
Mumford leans down to pet Ainge.
MUMFORD
What it might take is... doing time.
LILY
Too bad. That's tough, I mean it.
I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says
you're in love.
Mumford straightens, looks at Lily and acknowledges it.
LILY
Then it's worth it.
Mumford looks at Lily a long moment, then leans over the
fence and kisses her on the forehead. Ainge jumps back over
to her side.
MUMFORD
I'll tell her tonight.
Mumford turns and continues toward his stairs.
Mumford comes out to the rail and looks off over the town of
Mumford.
WHAT HE SEES (or imagines he sees): all across the nightscape,
one window in every house is glowing blue with flickering TV
light.
MOVING IN on the porch steps. Mumford runs into the shot. In
fact, he's run the whole way from his place and he's out of
breath. He takes the porch steps three at a time, rings the
doorbell, and waits.
Mrs. Cook peeks out, then opens the front door, an especially
sour look on her face. She speaks through the screen door.
MRS. COOK
Well, look who's here...
MUMFORD
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
MRS. COOK
Just who is here, can you tell me?
MUMFORD
Could I see Sofie, please?
MRS. COOK
No, you can not. I wouldn't know who
to say is calling.
SOFIE (O.S.)
Mother...
Mrs. Cook glances inside at the as-yet-unseen Sofie, then
hisses at Mumford --
MRS. COOK
I could see right through you from
the start, you imposter. I know what
you're after. I knew it then and I
know it now!
Sofie appears behind her mother.
SOFIE
Mother...
MUMFORD
What do you think I'm after, Mrs.
Cook?
MRS. COOK
Sofie. It's so obvious... you're
after my daughter.
MUMFORD
Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're
right about that.
Both Sofie and Mrs. Cook are set back for a moment. Mrs.
Cook recovers fastest --
MRS. COOK
It'll never happen! You're in big
trouble, mister.
SOFIE
(scary strong)
Mother... go away!
Mr. Cook suddenly appears, takes Mrs. Cook by the arm and
makes her vanish. Sofie and Mumford are left alone. She looks
at him through the screen.
MUMFORD
I guess you saw the show...?
SOFIE
Which show was that?
MUMFORD
Sofie...
SOFIE
Part of it. We were watching "ER"
until someone called.
MUMFORD
You probably got the idea.
Sofie comes outside. She doesn't get too close or look at
him as she walks to the other end of the porch.
SOFIE
Do you know what a betrayal this
is?...
Mumford knows.
SOFIE
...How violated I feel?
MUMFORD
You're not the only one...
Sofie turns sharply to look at him, ready to blow up.
SOFIE
You feel violated?
MUMFORD
Not me... all my other my patients.
I smelled tar and feathers on the
way over here.
SOFIE
You deserve it.
Mumford agrees. He watches her closely.
SOFIE
I should be irate.
Mumford immediately perks up. Sofie tries to correct --
SOFIE
I am irate!
MUMFORD
(grabbing at the thread)
But...
SOFIE
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This
is a terrible thing you've done.
MUMFORD
I know it! Please believe me, I know
that...
Mumford steps closer to her.
MUMFORD
But, there is one... mitigating factor
I want you to consider before you
write me off.
SOFIE
What?
MUMFORD
Will you think about it?
SOFIE
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad
mood.
MUMFORD
I love you. More than I've ever loved
anyone or anything in my life.
She looks into his eyes.
SOFIE
Oh.
MUMFORD
I want to spend the rest of my life
with you... but I'm not sure you
feel the same way.
She regards him for several moments, her mind racing.
SOFIE
I sort of do...
Mumford feels joy. Now, finally, he takes her in his arms.
SOFIE
...but first, you have to tell me
something...
MUMFORD
Anything... just ask.
SOFIE
What is your name?
As Mumford breaks into a huge grin, CUT TO:
The State Correctional Sedan heads out of the business
district toward the highway, leaving the town of Mumford
behind.
FADE OUT.
THE END
