Callie has just entered.  The eyes of her classmates are all 
on her - as if she s just walked into a surprise party.  She 
looks up and sees A PINATA hanging from a light fixture.  And 
 the papier-mache effigy looks JUST LIKE HER.  She s
mortified.  90% of the cafeteria breaks into hysterical 
laughter.  

The sea of obnoxious teenagers parts and ANDREA PRAEGER (16) - 
gorgeous, blond, Aryan - approaches Callie with a wicked 
smile and holding a bat.

CALLIE (V.O.)
I have seen the face of evil.  And, 
not surprisingly, evil has a fake 
tan.


Callie and her best friend, LOLA VAZQUEZ (15), are trying - 
only slightly successfully - to learn the dance steps to the 
Lady Gaga Video du jour.

BACK TO:


Andrea walks over with the bat, positioning herself 
underneath the pinata.

She swings the bat and BUSTS THE PINATA.  GREEN GOBS OF 
 head.  The whole cafeteria GUACAMOLE rain down on Callie s
erupts into laughter.

Callie covered in the goo, stares daggers at Andrea.  She 
wipes the muck off her face.

They slide into a table with Bridget, who we met in the 
parking lot.

BEN
This is Callie.  Callie, this is

She smiles wide, revealing a mouth full of metal and colorful

Callie looks around the spacious entrance... then to the

and carrying a chihuahua a la Paris Hilton.  (This fantasy is

Callie snaps out of her daydream and sees Andrea, who seems 
worried about her little daze.


It truly is a Queen s Quarters.  Modeling photos and trophies 
abound.  Callie sits, uncomfortably, while Andrea lays 
chewing on a Twizzler.12.

Across the hall, Ben and Bridget walk by and see Callie 
chatting with Andrea.

dust.  I gotta get to class.

Ben being bullied by COREY, an intimidatingly hulking guy.  
His JOCK FRIENDS all laugh.

COREY

The jocks are in hysterics.  Callie looks at Ben and senses 
his pain.  The jocks walk away.  16.

Off Callie, concerned about Ben --


The students at their LAB STATIONS are using BOMB 
CALORIMETERS.  DHIRAJ (14), is carefully studying it, giving 
Matt and Callie a chance to talk.

CALLIE (V.O.)

Matt considers this as he turns back to their assignment. 

At a neighboring station, an APPALLED GIRL overhears and 
 MEXICAN GIRL JUST reaches for her phone.  She texts:  NEW
TOLD MATT TO DUMP ANDREA.  WTF?!?!? 


Matt and Andrea have just broken up and judging from the very 
 not loud and forceful SLAP that Andrea gives him, she s
happy.

She spins around and stomps off in the other direction.

Lexy runs over to her.

LEXY
Thought you should know that your 
new BFF was the one who told Matt 
to dump you.

Andrea turns vermillion at this news and kicks a locker.


Ben s room is kind of a disaster.  There s stuff all over the 
place.

A toilet flushes, drowning out that last word.  Andrea 
watches with a venomous smile as Josie leaves the bathroom.

Bridget comes out of a stall.  REALLY awkward.  She goes over 
to the sink and washes her hands.  Bridget sees the moment 
and seizes it.

BRIDGET
 not my place to say, I know it s
but she was just really mean to 
you.

Bridget nods, bracing herself for the usual ridicule.  But

Off her indecipherable smile --


Callie comes into class and sits in her desk.  She overhears 
TWO GOSSIPING GIRLS nearby.

Andrea what had happened, which is 
what I was trying to do --

pinata that Andrea has just smashed.

CALLIE (V.O.)
When I walked head first into what 
would henceforth be known as The 
Great Guacamole Dousing of 2010.

The kids are all laughing hysterically, except for Ben.  
Bridget, across the room, seems slightly amused.  Callie, no
