      EXT. LEEDS - DUSK22

      Blue blue skies. Fluffy white clouds drift... Down through 
      the clouds to the dusk over the doleful city. The red sun 
      sinks. Darkness draws in.

      EXT. DAWSON CONSTRUCTION SITE, DEVIL S DITCH - NIGHT33

      A silent, frozen night. We are drawn as in a nightmare - down 
      a lane signposted to: DEVIL S DITCH... Past half-built houses 
      and dormant earth moving vehicles. Everything iced over... A 
      white feather flutters on the ground... Down into the 
      building site... 

      To the black trough of the foundations. We glimpse: in the 
      very bottom amongst the rusting rods embedded in concrete - 
      the lovely head, shoulders and wing of A DEAD ANGEL.

      Rain sluices across the windscreen. Sparks on the radio: 
       This town ain t big enough for the both of us...  

      A stuffed holdall on the back seat. A black jacket sways from 
      a hook. 5 inch lapels. An old wrist watch on the dash. Fag 
      smoked down to the tip - used to light a fresh one. 

      EDDIE DUNFORD - youthful, ambitious, libidinous. Elongated 
      shirt collar and kipper tie. Booming down the M1. Headed 
      North. Singing along. 

      He checks the time.

      INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, WAKEFIELD POLICE STATION - DAY66

      Eddie, late and sweating. Editor, BILL HADLEY, grey beard, 
      grey eyes, is talking to an owlish, bespectacled man - 
      DETECTIVE SUPERINTENDENT MAURICE JOBSON. Hadley looks 
      pointedly at his watch.

                                  HADLEY
                    Sorry to hear about your father, 
                    Edward.

                                  EDDIE
                    Thanks, Mr. Hadley. He had a good 
                    innings.

                                  HADLEY
                          (to Jobson)
                    This is Detective Superintendent 
                    Jobson. Mr. Dunford s hoping to be 
                    the Post s new Crime Correspondent. 

      They shake hands.

                                    MAURICE JOBSON
                    I ve always got along very well 
                    with Jack Whitehead...

                                  HADLEY
                    Mr. Dunford ll be standing in. 
                    Trial period.

      Jobson watches Eddie head through the smoky room packed with 
      beery JOURNOS. TV lights, notebooks, memo recorders. 

                                    MAURICE JOBSON
                    Local man?

                    as I understand. 

      Eddie shoves his way down a row of chairs. Faces he knows and 
      who we ll meet later. An old girlfriend mouths  hello  - 
      spaniel eyes - KATHRYN TYLER.

      Eddie sits beside BARRY GANNON - skinny, single, obsessed.

                    worry, son, you got your legs well 
                    under the table. Just do the job.

                                  EDDIE
                    Yeah. Fuck him. He s not getting in 
                    on this one.

      Up front, Maurice Jobson takes the stage with DETECTIVE CHIEF 
      SUPERINTENDENT BILL MOLLOY - late 50s, a big man, a dangerous 
      man. They flank a POLICE WOMAN and a crumpled couple: MR. and 
      MRS. KEMPLAY. 

      Beside them is an enlarged school photograph of a smiling 10 
      year old girl against a backdrop of a blue sky with fluffy 
      white clouds. We recognise her as the Dead Angel. Eddie 
      switches on his memo recorder.

                      Gentlemen, it s been a long night 
                    for everyone, especially Mr. and 
                    Mrs. Kemplay. So we ll keep this

                    yesterday evening, 3rd September, 
                    Clare Kemplay disappeared on her 
                    way home from Morley Grange Junior 
                    and Infants. Clare is ten years 
                    old. She was wearing an red kagool, 
                    a dark blue turtleneck sweater, 
                    pale blue denim trousers and red 
                      Wellington boots. When Clare left 
                    school, she was carrying a plastic 
                    Co-op carrier bag containing a pair 
                    of black gym shoes... Mrs. Kemplay 
                    would now like to read a short 
                      statement. Thank you.

      Jobson turns the mic towards MRS. KEMPLAY. Camera flashes.

                                  BARRY
                    Poor cow.

                                  EDDIE
                     If it bleeds, it leads,  right?
                          (a nasty thought)
                    Reckon dad did it?

                                  MRS. KEMPLAY
                    I would like to appeal to anybody 
                    who knows where my Clare is or who 
                    saw her after yesterday teatime to 
                    please telephone the police. Clare 
                    is a very happy girl and I know she 
                    would never just run off without 
                    telling me. Please, if you know 
                    where she is or if you ve seen her, 
                    please... please... please...

      Chokes. Can t go on. The POLICEWOMAN comforts her. 

      Eddie is transfixed by Mrs. Kemplay s distress.

                    That is going back. There was one 
                    not long ago. In Castleford. 
                    Jeanette, was it?

                                  BARRY
                    Jeanette Garland. Never found her 
                    neither.

      Eddie is suddenly interested.

      of a bar in hell. Genuine Formica veneer, booze, fag smoke, a 
      small stage where A WOMAN IN A FEATHERED DRESS belts out 
       We ve Only Just Begun . 

      A table of CRONIES: Barry Gannon, George Greaves, Gaz.

      The bar-woman, BET, has Eddie s drink ready for him. Pint and 
      a whisky. Eddie downs the scotch, quenches it with the beer.

                                  EDDIE

                    you re about it? Death Squads. 
                    You ve fucking lost it, mate.

      Eddie looks down the bar. At the far end is Kathryn Tyler, 
      cornered by a DRUNK. She sends a rescue-me-smile to him. 

                                  BARRY
                    You re a lucky man, Dunford. You 
                    want to look after that one...

      A YOUNG MAN sidles up to Barry - orange feather cut, nervous 
      eyes, fat maroon suit. A Bowie Clone. This is BJ.

                    BJ... Over there.

      Barry nods to a corner table. BJ throws Eddie a little smile, 
      then leaves them.

                    Well I didn t think it was 
                    pleasure, did I.

      Eddie watches Barry join the strange nervy young man, BJ. A 
      secret assignation. 

                                  KATH O/S

      Eddie turns to see Kath at his side.

                                  EDDIE
                    You know Barry. Gets a bit obtuse.

                                  KATH
                    Obtuse? There s a big word for you.

      Eddie s on his feet, into his pants. He pees in the adjoining 
      bathroom toilet. 

      Sound of the phone ringing outside. Eddie flushes the toilet. 
      Comes to the door.

      Lights flash past. He exits the motorway - swerves to halt on 
      the hard shoulder. 


      EXT. HUNSLET CARR, MOTORWAY - NIGHT2121

      Eddie gets out at the foot of the embankment. The black sky 
      beyond the embankment is filled with orange smoke and 
      sparks... 

      Eddie clambers to the top of the embankment. He looks down 
      into the basin of Hunslet Carr. He looks down into hell. 1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      16
                   


      Below, a gypsy camp is on fire. Caravans and trailers blaze. 
      GYPSY MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN are trapped amongst the flames, 
      ringed by POLICE IN RIOT GEAR. Screams of terror, engine 
      roars and heat. The police rhythmically bang their shields 
      with truncheons. They move in on the trapped gypsies. They 
      charge. Bones are broken. Flesh ripped. 

      A tiny 10 YEAR OLD GYPSY GIRL stands screaming amid the 
      satanic fury.

      Eddie hides again in bushes. He sees: OFFICERS - including 
      SERGEANT BOB CRAVEN - ginger bearded and carnivorous - and a 
      short arse - CONSTABLE TOM DOUGLAS. Also DETECTIVE SERGEANTS *
      JIM PRENTICE and DICK ALDERMAN - greased blonde hair, *
      moustache and sideburns. All smoking and drinking and 
      laughing. Illuminated by the flames of hell. At their centre 
      is Detective Chief Superintendent Bill Molloy. Molloy looks 
      up. Eddie buries his face in the mud.

      Eddie driving. Heater and radio on - the missing girl story 
      growing on National. Peering out at the dark world: PEOPLE 
      wrapped against the biting cold, dark factories, silent 
      mills, torn election posters Wilson, Heath -  Who Governs 
      Britain?  

      Eddie pauses at the traffic lights. Across the street is 
      MORLEY GRANGE JUNIOR AND INFANTS SCHOOL. KIDS come out, 
      laughing and screeching. Eddie stares...

      Clare begins to skip along the road. Going home. Eddie drives 
      slowly - keeping pace with her. Traffic horns blare. Clare 
      pauses on the corner, waving at Eddie. 

      Eddie signals to turn up the road. A car angrily roars past 
      him. Screamed abuse. Clare s little figure vanished.

      Eddie drives up Winterbourne Avenue. A cul-de-sac of mixed

      Eddie marches through the clatter of typewriters and chatter. 
      Kath nervously gets to her feet. She looks terrible.

      Ahead, a slick, sharp man with a shark smile, leans against a

      A copy of the Yorkshire Post hits Hadley s desk: 

                                CLARE KEMPLAY MURDERED 
                BY JACK WHITEHEAD, CRIME REPORTER OF THE YEAR.

                                  HADLEY
                    I hope there s no bad feeling. I 
                    mean I hope you don t think you 
                    were in any way bumped off the 
                    story...

                                  EDDIE
                    I m off the story?

                                  HADLEY
                    Not at all, not at all. You 
                    couldn t be reached. So I sent 
                    Jack.

                                  EDDIE
                    So, now it s Jack s story?

                                  HADLEY
                    Look, I have a couple of other 
                    things I want you to follow up. A 
                    favour.

                                  EDDIE
                    A what? A favour?

                                  HADLEY
                    I want you to go to "Shangrila". 

                                  EDDIE
                    Come again?

                                  HADLEY
                       Shangrila . It was a silver 
                    wedding present apparently. Her 
                    favourite film...

                          it)
                    The Dawson place. John Dawson? The 
                      construction magnate?

                                  EDDIE
                    What about him?

                                  HADLEY
                    Barry s got a theory - local 
                      corruption...

                                  EDDIE

                                  HADLEY
                    I want you to hold his hand.

                                  EDDIE
                    No one gives a fuck about local 
                      government corruption.

                                  HADLEY
                    Barry seems to think Marjorie 
                    Dawson will corroborate everything 
                    he s dug up on her husband... 
                            (confidentially)
                    Look, Mrs. Dawson isn t a well 
                    woman. It s ethically dubious to 
                    bother her. I want you to make sure 
                    Barry doesn t go off the deep end. 

                                  EDDIE
                    And what about Clare Kemplay?

                                  HADLEY
                    It ll get solved in the next few 
                    days or never. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Who found her?

                                  HADLEY
                    Builder s mate. Lad from 
                      Fitzwilliam. Edward, I m asking you 
                    to drop it. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Okay.

                                  HADLEY
                    Good. We ll let Jack handle it for 
                    the most part, shall we. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Right. Team effort.

                                  HADLEY
                    That s it. So, you ll stay away 
                    from Fitzwilliam, then...

                                  EDDIE
                      Absolutely, Mr. Hadley.


      EXT. FITZWILLIAM, NEWSTEAD VIEW - DAY3333

      Eddie drives the Viva through the rundown mining town - under 
      the daubed iron bridge: FUCK FITZWILLIAM, FUCK THE IRA. Into 
      the rundown mining town. The pit wheel, terraced houses, 
      burned out bus stops and closed-down shops...

      Down Newstead View; a line of terraced houses.1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      24
                   


      Standing at the road side, a car exhaust pipe in his hands, 
      is a SIMPLE MAN in overalls. He stares at Eddie as he passes. *
      His name is JOHN MYSHKIN.*

      Off Newstead View is a cul-de-sac that ends at the foot of a 
      great grassed-over slag heap. Netherton Close. Allotments, 
      abandoned cars, sheds and caravans dot the slope. Ponies, 
      rusting tractors, white vans, packs of dogs. KIDS play 
      amongst the piles of scrap metal. Beyond are the bleak Moors.


      EXT. 7 NETHERTON CLOSE - DAY3434

      Eddie looks around. A GANG OF BOYS watch him whilst absently 
      smashing an abandoned car. Eddie heads for number 7. A neat 
      lawn. Empty garage. 

      The door is opened by a hard beauty in her late 30s.

                                  EDDIE

                    He s had enough with the police. He 
                    doesn t need to keep going over 
                    it...

      A gentle, commanding voice from inside the dark house:

                    Mary. It s all right. Go fetch your 
                    son.

      MARTIN LAWS. A tough, lean man in his early 40s. Shirt 
      sleeves, muddy boots and dog collar. Watchful and 
        uncompromising.

                                  MARTIN LAWS
                    We ve all had enough of the police

                    the mud. Allotment work.


      INT. 7 NETHERTON CLOSE - DAY3535

      A SIXTEEN YR. OLD BOY in tracksuit bottoms sits on the floor 
      before Eddie. He flicks lank hair out of his eyes. He s got a 
      bruise over his eye. The front room is small and dank. Eddie, 
      Martin Laws and Mary Cole watch the boy.1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      25

                    They thought he d done it, you

                          (to Eddie)
                    The police very quickly realised 
                    their mistake.

                                  EDDIE
                    Why did they think you d done it, 
                    Leonard?

                                    LEONARD
                    Ask them.

                                  MARY COLE
                    He s a good boy, Mr. Dunford. He 
                    didn t do nothing.

                                  EDDIE
                    Get some brass out of it, Leonard. 
                    Tell us what happened.

                                  MARTIN LAWS
                    No need for money, Mr. Dunford. 
                    It s the truth matters... Leonard 
                    can show you the place...

                                  MARY COLE
                    She was a lovely little thing.


3636EXT. DAWSON CONSTRUCTION SITE, DEVIL S DITCH - DAY                   

      Eddie and Leonard tramp through a dense drizzle to stand on 
      the rim of the building foundations. No work going on. 
      WORKMEN watching from the shelter of a half-built house. 
      Martin Laws and Mrs. Cole stand together a little way off, 
      watching.

                                    LEONARD
                    We were waiting for Gaffer, but he

      Eddie crouches and picks up a single white feather. He stares 
      into the black foundations. Behind him, is a large hoarding: 
      A DAWSON UK DEVELOPMENT. 


      INT. THE PRESS CLUB - EVENING3737

      Eddie down into the red gloom of the Press Club. Only a FEW 
      SOULS in hell this early. He heads for Jack at the bar. 
      Jack s on a bender.

    A shaft goes down. Jack laughs in Eddie s face... He slides 
      off his stool and stumbles towards the toilets.

                    Don t fuck around, Jack. 

      Jack smiles with the wisdom of the drunk.

                                  JACK
                    Whatever happened to all those 
                    novels you wanted to write but were 
                    too scared shitless to even try...

      Eddie grabs Jack - shoves him against the tiles.

                                  EDDIE
                    Tell me!

                                  JACK
                    Eddie, I am pissing down my trouser 
                    leg... Yours too...

      Eddie lets him go. Steps back. 

                                  EDDIE
                    You re all washed up. You re just a 
                    hack. 

                                  JACK
                    Such insight.


      INT. EDDIE S MOTHER S HOUSE, HIS BEDROOM - NIGHT3939

      Beethoven s Eroica blasts the player. Eddie s father s vinyl 
      collection is strewn across the floor. Eddie, in pants and 
      vest. Swigging Scotch. He manically pages through articles on 
      the missing girls - SUSAN, JEANETTE, CLARE...

      Eddie s mother enters. He stops the music. She takes in his 
      sorry state. In her hand she has a manila A4 envelope. 
      Scrawled on the envelope is one word:  Scoop . 1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      28
                   


                                    EDDIE S MOTHER
                    A man left this for you, love. Nice 
                    man. Said he was a friend of yours. 
                    Jack someone...

      His mother leaves and Eddie cautiously opens the envelope... 
      Trembling, he pulls out a couple of sheets of paper. We see 
      typed words: 

                              CLARE KEMPLAY. POST-MORTEM. 

       The body measured four feet three inches and weighed seventy-
      two pounds... Presence of coal dust found beneath 
      fingernails... Facial abrasions, possibly bites were 
      noted... 

      Eddie scans. Panic rising. Horrors. Glimpsing phrases...

                                  EDDIE
                          (reading to himself)
                     ...palms pierced... tears and 
                      bruising... 

       Ligature marks... burns upon the neck... inserted into the 
      vagina... 

      Eddie shuffles the pages front to back to reveal a set of 
        photographs. 

      Rapid fire images flash before his eyes: 

        ABRASIONS... A SMALL HAND... A SEVERED SWAN S WING...

      Eddie s face. The horror.

                    She was strangled - gouged her own

                    crucified her and...

                    They d gone and stitched fucking

      EXT/INT. LANE & SHANGRILA / VIVA - DAY42A42A

      They drive up a dark, leafy lane lined with high walls. Fairy 
      lights are strung in the trees... 

      A big house comes into view. Uber 70s bungalow chic. A sign: 
         SHANGRILA . Red Jaguar in the gated drive.

      A DANGEROUS LOOKING MAN WITH A JASON KING MOUSTACHE comes 
      down the drive.

      Barry goes to get out.

      EXT. PAULA GARLAND S HOUSE - DAY4343

      Eddie goes to a red door in a row of pre-war houses. A woman 
      in her early 30s answers - thin, bruised-beautiful. PAULA 
      GARLAND. She takes Eddie s breath for a second.

                                  EDDIE
                    Mrs. Paula Garland? I m from the 
                    Yorkshire Post. It s about 
                    Jeanette.


      INT. PAULA GARLAND S HOUSE, FRONT ROOM - DAY4444

      Eddie runs his eyes over Paula s figure as he follows her 
      into a well-furnished room. There are some new items still 
      wrapped in plastic. On the TV is the school photo: Jeanette 
      Garland against a background of blue skies and white clouds. 
      Just like Susan Ridyard. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Mr. Garland about?

                                  PAULA
                    What do you want Mr. Dunford?

                                  EDDIE
                    Well, I m doing an article on the 
                    parents of children who have gone 
                    missing.
                          (she doesn t blink)
                    It s about how parents have coped, 
                    after all the fuss has died down.
                          (still no reaction)
                    I know this must be difficult. I 
                    mean, I know how you must have 
                    felt...

                                  PAULA
                    You have no idea how I feel.

      She turns away. In a mirror she sees Eddie take in her body.

                                  EDDIE
                    I mean, for example, do you think 
                    the police could have done anything 
                    more to have helped you?

                                  PAULA
                    There was one thing.

                          (notebook ready)

      The red door is slammed in Eddie s face. Eddie turns to the 
      street. Opposite are more recent semis and a sign: A DAWSON 
      UK DEVELOPMENT. He senses everyone watching him. A WOMAN with 
      a pram gawps. Eddie grabs his crotch at her.

4747EXT. THE SHAKESPEARE PUB CAR PARK - DAY                   

      Eddie and Barry head across the car park.

                                  BARRY
                    Dawson did his National Service in 
                    Kenya. There are tales of scalping 
                    and rape and genital mutilation. He 
                    taped the screams. For fun. 

                                  EDDIE
                          (beginning to bite)
                    If you seriously believe her, you 
                    should tell someone.

                                  BARRY
                    Who? The Law? These people are the 
                    Law. 

      Barry assesses Eddie. Is he up to it?

                                  BARRY
                    Eddie? That Gypsy camp at Hunslet 
                    Carr? Take a closer look. Dawson 
                    set up a 100 million pound property 
                    trust. One hundred million. Be 
                      interesting to know who else is on 
                    the board...

                                  EDDIE

                    there, right?1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      33
                   


                                  BARRY
                    You re ignorant, Dunford. Try 
                    carrying a history book along with 
                    that notepad of yours.

                                  EDDIE
                    Want a lift or what?

                                  BARRY
                    Going the other way.

      Barry unsteadily walks away. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Pisshead!

      Barry turns back.

                                  BARRY
                    You never had the urge to deliver 
                    us from evil, then?

                                  EDDIE

                    The devil triumphs when good men do 
                    nowt.

      And, laughing, Barry disappears from view...

      A screech of tyres. Eddie turns: A police car comes racing 
      off the road and swerves to a halt in the car park. TWO 
      POLICEMEN get out. Tommy Douglas and Bob Craven.

                    Come here, you little puff.

      Craven grabs Eddie. Spins him round. Slams his face against 
      the Viva. Holds him by his neck. 

                                  EDDIE
                    What do you want?1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      34

      Craven runs his finger between Eddie s cheeks and pushes it 
      up his arse.

                                  CRAVEN
                    It s not nice, is it.

      INT. PUB - EVENING4949

      The noisy PUB CROWD. Eddie gets himself a drink. Whisky down 
      in one. Pint to cool his throat. Needed it. 

      In the mirror - hidden at the back of the crowd, he sees 
      Paula Garland. Damaged and pale in her red sweater. Sitting 
      alone at a table by the jukebox.

      Eddie brings his pint and a large whisky to Paula s table. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Mrs. Garland... 

      Paula s had a couple already. She looks at his cheerful grin. 
      Looks away. Feigned boredom.

                                  EDDIE
                    Seems like a nice local...

      She takes her time. 

                                  PAULA
                    It used to be.

                                  EDDIE

      Paula nods at the drinks in his hands.

                                  PAULA
                    One of them for me?

      Eddie hands her the whisky. Offers her a cigarette.

                                  EDDIE
                    Come here often, then?

                                  PAULA
                    Sounds like you re trying to pick 
                    me up, Mr, Dunford.

      Eddie laughs a little too quickly. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Hope your friends in the force 
                    don t see us together...

                                  PAULA
                    What do you mean?

                                  EDDIE
                    I got the message. You didn t need 
                    to go to the police.

                                  PAULA
                    I never said anything to the 
                    police.

                                  EDDIE
                    Who did you tell?

                                  PAULA
                    No one.

      The music changes. Diana Ross. Paula stares down into the 
      jukebox lights. Eddie studies her face.

                                  EDDIE
                    Look, I really am sorry about 
                    before. 

                                  PAULA
                          (a straight look)
                    You were doing your job. It might 
                    help find my little girl...

                                  EDDIE
                    Mrs. Garland...

                                  PAULA
                    Paula. It s Paula. 

                                  EDDIE

      She shrugs - tips a little more whisky.

                                  PAULA
                    Ring always felt loose to be 
                    honest. 
                          (a look just for Eddie)
                    There, that was a stupid thing to 
                    say...

      Paula finishes her whisky. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Want another?

                                  PAULA
                    Trying to get me legless?

                                  EDDIE
                    Just say...

                                  PAULA
                    Bad idea. You said sorry. Thanks  
                    for that. 

                                  EDDIE
                    I ll give you a lift home. 

                                  PAULA
                    Thanks for the drink.

      Paula pushes past Eddie - heads for the door. He watches her 
      go. Wants her... 


      EXT. STREETS, CASTLEFORD - NIGHT5050

      Paula Garland walks through the deserted streets like a 
      ghost. Everything around her is frozen and silent. 


      INT/EXT. VAUXHALL VIVA / PAULA GARLAND S HOUSE - NIGHT5151

      Eddie smokes and waits in his car opposite Paula s house. No 
      lights on. Then in the mirror he sees Paula s figure emerge 
      out of the dark. He ditches the fag. 

      Paula pauses - as if sensing the air. Eddie scrunches himself 
      down in the seat... 

      Paula turns lets herself in through the red door.

      No lights come on. But Eddie watches her come to stand at the 
      window, smoking a cigarette. Very blonde. Very pale. 

      Does she know he s watching her?1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      37
                   


      EXT/INT. PAULA GARLAND S HOUSE / FRONT ROOM - NIGHT5252

      Eddie crosses to the house. He can see Paula inside. The glow 
      of her cigarette... She turns to look at him through the 
      glass... He puts his hand against the front door. It s off 
      the catch...


      INT. PAULA GARLAND S HOUSE, FRONT ROOM - NIGHT5353

      Eddie watches Paula s image in the large mirror. Her eyes are 
      on him. Velvet eyes. Red mouth. 

      Eddie s hands go out... Inches from her body... His mouth a 
      fraction from her neck... His hands go out. His mouth close. 
      Can t move closer... 

      Wants her. Can t have her...

      Eddie wakes from his sex dream. Still wants her. Still can t

      voice, then...

      INT. THE ATHENA CAFETERIA - DAY5757

      Eddie heads fast through the steamed up cafeteria packed with 
      PRESS; LOCALS, but also NATIONALS at separate tables.

      Jack pauses - speaks quietly to Eddie.

      Eddie is left alone and friendless.


      INT/EXT. VIVA / MORLEY, VICTORIA RD JUNCTION - DAY5858

      Eddie drives slowly down Victoria Road. He slows as he 
      approaches the junction. Police tape streams from the lamp 
      post. A sign: FATAL ACCIDENT. A plea for information. Smashed 
      green glass has been swept into a heap.


      EXT. MORLEY, VICTORIA RD JUNCTION - DAY58A58A

      Eddie stares at pile of smashed glass. A young, very friendly 
      sergeant - BOB FRASER - comes up to him - shakes hands. Eddie 
      is immediately suspicious.

                    carrying plates of glass?

                    Mr. Gannon in the Shakespeare 
                    Public House... Would you say he 
                    was drinking heavily?

                                  EDDIE
                    I think he had a half. Pint at the 
                    most.

                                  BOB FRASER

                    No idea why he might have come to

                    Gannon was one of the men who gave 
                    us this age. Where he saw 
                      injustice, he asked for justice. 
                    Where he saw lies, he asked for 
                    truth. Barry Gannon once said that 
                    the truth can only make us richer.

                    Barry s premature passing has left

                      Panegyric? 
                          (no idea what it means)
                    No, no I don t think so... Is it 
                    going in today s?

                    Best to wait until after the

                    but you never know what they re 
                    going to turn up... 

      Eddie smiles with dangerous charm. He opens his file and 
      pushes a couple of pieces of typed copy across to Hadley. 

                                  HADLEY
                          (scanning the copy)
                    Do we really need this? 

                                  EDDIE
                    There s been a spate of animal 
                      mutilations. Hacked about swans 
                    found over on Bretton Park...

                                  HADLEY
                    I m not stupid. Jack showed me the 
                      post-mortem. 

                                  EDDIE
                    It s background.

      Eddie stares at him. Waiting. Hating him through a polite 
      smile. Hadley shoves the copy back at him.

                                  HADLEY
                    Get some police quotes. Maybe we ll

      Eddie grits his teeth at that one.

                    Good afternoon. I m here to see 
                    Aunty Marjorie. Marjorie Dawson?


      INT. HARTLEY NURSING HOME, STAIRCASE - DAY7070

      A tailored NURSE MANAGER leads Eddie up a vast staircase.

                    We ve had to give her something for 
                    her nerves. She was in a bit of a 
                    state when they brought her back.

      Eddie passes a STRANGE FEMALE PATIENT who paddles at her 
      crotch, her eyes on him. 


      INT. HARTLEY NURSING HOME, CORRIDOR - DAY7171

      Eddie and the Nurse Manager. Down a corridor to room 102.


      INT. HARTLEY NURSING HOME, ROOM 102 - DAY7272

      Eddie is shown into a sunny room. Flowers, over-heating, 
      Radio 3 - Mahler s Kindertotenlieder:  Now I can see why such 
      dark flames / You flashed at me... . MARJORIE DAWSON is on 
      the bed in a satin dressing gown. Trophy Wife on the verge.

                                  NURSE MANAGER
                    Mrs. Dawson? You have a visitor. 

      Marjorie Dawson opens her eyes. The Nurse Manager takes 
      Steph s flowers. 

                                  NURSE MANAGER
                    It s Eric, Mrs. Dawson. Your

                    It sometimes takes her a while to 
                    come round...

      The Nurse Manager gives Eddie a sly smile, then she s gone. 
      Marjorie Dawson stares at him. It s very hot. Eddie checks 
      the window. 

                                  MARJORIE DAWSON
                    It s locked. Who are you?

      She allows her gown to fall open - lets Eddie clock some 
      thigh - makes a show of covering up. She takes a cigarette - 
      lets Eddie light it for her.

                                  MARJORIE DAWSON
                    I can t help you, Mr. Dunford.

                                  EDDIE
                    You told my colleague, Barry 
                    Gannon, his life was in danger. 

                                  MARJORIE DAWSON
                    Did I really? What a strange thing 
                    to say.

                                  EDDIE
                    He was killed that night.

                                  MARJORIE DAWSON
                    How terrible.

                                  EDDIE
                    You didn t know?

                    Who can tell what I m supposed to 
                    know these days...

      A tear runs down Marjorie Dawson s face...

                                  EDDIE
                    Why did you tell my colleague he 
                    was in danger?

                                  MARJORIE DAWSON
                    He was asking questions.

                                  EDDIE
                    What kind of questions?

                                  MARJORIE DAWSON
                    Reckless questions. About reckless 
                    men. Like you.

                                  EDDIE

                    You smell of death.

      Outside, there s a screech of brakes. 

                                  MARJORIE DAWSON
                    I think you had better leave now.

      Eddie looks down to see a police car. Two policemen leap out.

                                  EDDIE
                    Mrs. Dawson...

                                  MARJORIE DAWSON
                    Don t touch me! Don t hurt me! 
                    Please don t! Please don t!

      She cringes back, wailing like a tormented child. There s 
      Pounding and shouting up the stairs...

                                  EDDIE
                    I m not going to hurt you. Calm 
                    down...

      The pounding up the stairs is getting louder and louder. Mrs. 
      Dawson grabs hold of Eddie - hisses into his face.

                                  MARJORIE DAWSON
                    Tell them about the others...

                    What?

                    What others? What are you talking 
                    about?!

                    Tell them. Please tell them where 
                    they are...

      Eddie turns to the window. Locked. Marjorie Dawson smiles 
      charmingly - once again the perfect trophy wife.

                                  MARJORIE DAWSON

      The door slams open. The two policemen Eddie met earlier 
      burst in. Craven and Douglas. A truncheon whacks Eddie s 
      shins. He goes down. The Nurse Manager snarls from the door. 

                                  NURSE MANAGER
                    Lying bastard!

      Marjorie Dawson turns away in her bed - turns up Radio 3.

                    You re dead, Little Fairy.

    A truncheon cracks Eddie s head. A hand grabs Eddie s hair. 
      He s dragged from the room. Marjorie Dawson and Mahler 
      rapidly recede. The door slams shut!


      INT. HARTLEY NURSING HOME, STAIRCASE - DAY7373

      Eddie. Dragged back down the stairs. Spine bouncing off each 
      stair. Hands flailing hands. Fingernails tearing...


      EXT. HARTLEY NURSING HOME - DAY7474

      Crash! The Nursing Manager slams the front door. Eddie 
      dragged backwards by his hair. Shoes coming off. Hands 
      scraped on the gravel. 

      Eddie twists round. Ribs and hips scraping across the ground 
      now. His Vauxhall Viva rapidly approaching his face. Crack! 
      Straight into it.

      The Viva s door is swung open. His arm held out. His grasping 
      hand. The door slammed on it. Fuck! And again. Eddie s watch 
      smashes to smithereens.

      Blackness.


      INT. PINDERFIELDS CASUALTY - EVENING7575

      Blackness. Sounds of a hospital. 

      A big fat bandaged hand rises against the blurred image of 
      Eddie s mother. No watch.

                    I thought you were bloody dead!

      Eddie struggles to get up.

                    What are you doing?

                    Don t be daft. You re not fit.

      Eddie lurches to his feet. Sick, dizzy, in pain. 

                                    EDDIE S MOTHER
                    Don t do this to me! I hate you for 
                    this, Edward!

      Eddie takes her by the shoulders - brandishes his damaged 
      hand in her face.

                                  EDDIE

      head. She stirs but doesn t wake. Eddie pads away. She 
      sleeps. 

      The sound of the door closing. She sleeps on.

      The sound of the Vauxhall Viva starting up and driving away. 

      She opens her eyes.1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      49

      Then he sees the sign in the night: It s the Only Place to 
      Stop!   The Redmoor Cafe and Motel. En-suite accommodation. 


      INT/EXT. VIVA / REDMOOR CAFE AND MOTEL - NIGHT7979

      Eddie pulls up beside a lorry in the forecourt of the new, 
      long red brick building with pitched roof. 

      Eddie gets out. Looks around. Quiet. He pulls his black bin 
      liners out of the car and heads for the motel...  


      INT. REDMOOR CAFE AND MOTEL, ROOM 27 - NIGHT8080

      A NIGHT PORTER shows Eddie into a flimsy room overlooking the 
      carpark. A single bed, MFI wardrobe, damp curtains.

                                  NIGHT PORTER
                    Two quid a night. 

      Eddie dumps his bags. He counts out twenty eight pounds in 
      notes. The night porter shuffles away. 

      Eddie locks the door. Draws the curtains. Empties out his 
      sack of goodies: Clothes, a portable typewriter, files, 
      envelopes and research... 

      Eddie tears up strips of wallpaper. Makes three columns and 
      pins them to the wall. 

      Eddie labels the columns with a black marker:

                                SUSAN . JEANETTE . CLARE

      He pins up clippings for each girl. He tears Jack s name off 
      the Yorkshire Post article and chucks it. He pins the article 
      beneath Clare s name.

      Photos and newspaper cuttings. He adds the horrendous post-
      mortem photographs. 

      Eddie makes a new column in his growing collection of 
      material:

                                        JOHN DAWSON

      He pins up a snap of the destroyed gypsy camp. 1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      50
                   


      Eddie picks up a photograph of Paula Garland...


      INT. VIVA - NIGHT8181

      Eddie driving one handed. Bites the lid off a bottle of 
      Paracetamol - gobbles a few down. Every move hurts.


      INT. PAULA GARLAND S HOUSE, FRONT ROOM - NIGHT8282

      Eddie eases painfully back into the white leather sofa. On 
      the mantle is a card of the Dawson house,  Shangrila , re-
      located to a snow-covered forest. A pastel sky, windows 
      filled with yellow firelight. Hyper real. Kitsch on 
      Quaaludes.

      Paula hands Eddie a Scotch. He knocks it back. Good stuff. He 
      is in a very dangerous mood. 

                                  PAULA
                    What happened to your hand?

                                  EDDIE
                    Two policemen slammed the car door 
                    on it.

                                  PAULA
                    Why? What for?

                                  EDDIE
                    Thought you might be able to tell 
                    me that. 

                                  PAULA
                    I don t understand.

                                  EDDIE
                    They were the same two coppers who 
                    warned me off last time I was here. 

      Paula s nervous. She gets herself a drink. Eddie watches her 
      body against the drinks cabinet lights.

                                  PAULA
                    I never said anything to the 
                    police.

                                  EDDIE
                    Who did you tell?

                                  PAULA
                    No one.

                                  EDDIE

                                  PAULA
                    I was upset. After you went... 
                    Well, John came over. John Dawson?

                                  EDDIE
                    John Dawson?... What did you say?

                                  PAULA
                    I told him some fucking journalist 
                    had been round asking questions. 
                    You pissed me off.

                                  EDDIE
                          (waving his bandaged paw)
                    There you go, then.

      Eddie painfully gets out of the chair. Goes towards Paula.

                                  EDDIE
                    Tell me about Dawson.

                                  PAULA
                    He s rich. And he was very kind to 
                    us when Jeanette went missing... 

                                  EDDIE
                    He s rich.

                                  PAULA
                    Yeah.

                                  EDDIE
                      Sub-standard housing, dodgy 
                    property trusts, back-handers to 
                    the local council.  

                                  PAULA
                    He s been very good to me.

      Eddie looks her up and down.

                                  EDDIE
                    I ll bet.

                                  PAULA
                    What s that supposed to mean?

      Eddie holds his bandaged hand in her face.

                                  EDDIE
                    Think he d do something like this?

                                  PAULA
                    No.

                                  PAULA
                    He wouldn t. Why would he?

                                  EDDIE
                    Because of what I know, maybe.

                                  PAULA
                    And what do you know, Eddie?

                                  EDDIE
                    Clare Kemplay was found on a Dawson 
                      construction site.

                                  PAULA
                    You re talking nonsense. 

                                  EDDIE
                    I know all people like Dawson care 
                    about are their money and their 
                    little lies.

                                  PAULA
                    You don t know anything. You re 
                    just a boy.

      Paula pushes Eddie back. 

                                  EDDIE
                    I know there s some bastard out 
                    there who s taking and raping and 
                    murdering little girls and nobody 
                    is going to stop him because nobody 
                    really fucking cares! 

                                  PAULA
                    And you do? 

                                  EDDIE
                    I m some fucking journalist who 
                    asks questions, right. And I m 
                    going to keep asking them until I 
                    get the answers.

      Eddie lowers his hand, brushes lightly down her body. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Who else is going to do that for 
                    you?

      Paula kisses Eddie full on the mouth, his eyes, his ears.

                                  PAULA
                    Thank you. Thank you. Thank you...

      Eddie grabs at Paula, numb bandaged hand pawing at her skirt, 
      good hand pulling her against him. They fall to the sofa. 
      They pull at one another s clothes. 1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      53
                   


      Desperate to get at each other s body. Every move hurts 
      Eddie. He doesn t care. No words.


      EXT. SHANGRILA - NIGHT8383

      Eddie drifts towards "Shangrila . Candles burn at the 
      windows. The door opens for him. 


      INT. SHANGRILA, HALLWAY - NIGHT8484

      Eddie enters a magical hall lit by a roaring log fire... 

      In a four poster bed, Paula sleeps on her stomach. Satin 
      sheets up to her neck. Golden hair splayed... 

      Eddie pulls back the sheets to reveal... Paula has bloody 
      swan wings on her back... Eddie staggers away... 


      INT. PAULA GARLAND S HOUSE, HER BEDROOM - DAWN8585

      Eddie wakes in a silent house. He s alone - in Paula s double 
      bed. His wounds have blotted the sheets with blood.

      Daylight filters into a room that is very much Paula s. 
      There s a picture of Jeanette on her side of the bed... 


      INT. PAULA GARLAND S HOUSE, LANDING / JEANETTE S ROOM - DAWN8686

      Eddie emerges from Paula s room. There s a plastic door 
      plate:  Mummy and Daddy s Room . Opposite is a slightly ajar 
      door:  Jeanette s Room . He can hear a softly recited rhyme. 

                                  PAULA O/S
                    ...Two little dickie birds sitting 
                    on the wall...

      Eddie can see Paula - playing the child s game...

                                  PAULA
                    One called Peter and one called 
                    Paul. Fly away Peter. Fly away 
                    Paul...

      Eddie comes into the child s room. Untouched. Pink bedspread. 
      Teddies and dolls. Childish drawings. Photos on a corkboard. 
      Smiling Jeanette Garland. And Paula playing with her little 
      daughter who isn t there... 

                                  PAULA
                    Come back Peter. Come back Paul...

      She speaks without looking at Eddie.1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      54

                    When she was a baby, I d lie awake 
                    at night and wonder what I d do if 
                    anything happened to her; lying 
                    awake, seeing her dead. And I d run 
                    to her room and I d wake her up and 
                    I d hug her and hug her and hug 
                    her. And when she never came home, 
                    all those terrible things had come 
                    true...

      Eddie s arms go round her. He kisses away her tears. She 
      sinks into his arms. He rocks her gently.


      INT. DEWSBURY CREMATORIUM, CREMATOR - DAY8787

      Flames burst up around a coffin. Everything turned to ash and 
      smoke. Just like Eddie s dad. 


      EXT. DEWSBURY CREMATORIUM - DAY8888

      Eddie smokes outside the Chapel of Rest. MOURNERS file out, 
      draw coats round themselves, put up umbrellas, spark up.

                    I doubt it.

      Eddie sees BJ s skinny figure. He s watching from a long way 
      off. BJ clocks Eddie watching him, turns away and vanishes 
      from sight...

      Eddie heads for his Viva... He stops short. Leaning against a 
      red Jaguar parked alongside is Dawson s henchman, Jason King *
      Moustache. Trouble. Jason pulls Eddie s hand off his car door *
      handle. A big solid man emerges from the red Jag. JOHN 
      DAWSON.

      INT/EXT. RED JAGUAR / THE BRADFORD ROAD - DAY8989

      Eddie sits in the back of the Jag with John Dawson. Jason 
      King drives. DAWSON S DRIVER follows in Eddie s car. Down the 
      Bradford Road: black bricks, saris, BROWN BOYS playing 
      cricket in the cold.

                    it s hung parliaments. A year ago

                    fucking 25 per cent! The country s 
                    at war, Mr. Dunford. 

      Everything run-down, closed, obsolete. John Dawson sighs at 
      it all - continues his running commentary on the world of 
      Yorkshire 1974 that drifts past.

                    cocks. It was Cowboys and Indians. 
                    Like now. 


      EXT/INT. THE KARACHI SOCIAL CLUB / RED JAGUAR - DAY9090

      The red Jag followed by Eddie s Viva approaches a large 
      detached building. A sign over the former textile factory: 
      THE KARACHI SOCIAL CLUB. 

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Do you know the Karachi? It s a 
                    place where men can talk. A 
                      businessman like myself and an 
                    officer of the law can get together 
                    in a less formal setting so to 
                    speak. 

      They pull over opposite the Karachi Club with Eddie s car 
      behind. They get out. 

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    You going to continue our late 
                    friend s crusade against local 
                      corruption, Mr. Dunford?

                                  EDDIE
                    What makes you ask that?

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Me and Barry had a very special 
                      relationship most of the time. 
                    Mutually beneficial it was.  

                                  EDDIE
                    In what way?

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    I m in the fortunate position to be 
                    able to occasionally pass on 
                      information that comes my way. 
                    Certain officials sticking their 
                    fingers where they shouldn t. That 
                    kind of thing...

                          (shoot his cuffs)
                    Like the cut?

      Dawson shows him the label:  Dunford s .

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Top man, your father. Knew how to 
                    cut his cloth. Solid. Dependable. 
                    Earned bugger all, mind... 

      Dawson puts his big mitt on Eddie s shoulder.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    That s not you, is it, Mr. Dunford? 
                    You re more like me. We like to 
                    fuck and make a buck and we re not 
                    right choosey how. Isn t that 
                    right? Drop by Saturday lunchtime. 
                    I got something might interest you.

      Dawson heads towards the Karachi Club with Jason King. He *
      pauses - turns back.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    And, Mr. Dunford? My wife is a very 
                    unwell woman. Speak to her again 
                    and it won t be your hand that gets 
                    smashed.

      The driver who took Eddie s car tosses the keys at him and 
      follows the big man and Jason King. Eddie is left with his *
      Viva.

      Homes we recognise. Also council memos, builders  merchants 
      orders for materials, copies of building contracts.

      INT. YORKSHIRE POST, HADLEY S OFFICE - DAY103103

      Eddie into Hadley s office. Jack Whitehead s got there first.

                                  EDDIE
                    It s a bloody farce! Myshkin didn t 
                    do it!

                                  HADLEY
                    He confessed. 

                                  EDDIE
                    It s bullshit. They ve got nothing.

                    Fuck off.  This is the work of your

                                  HADLEY
                    What is he on about?

                                  JACK
                    They found all kinds of things in 
                    Myshkin s room, Scoop. Photos of 
                    little girls - boxes of them...

                                  EDDIE

                    He s coughing for the lot - Clare

                                  EDDIE
                    He s twenty-two. That would make 
                    him sixteen when Susan Ridyard went 
                    missing!

                                  JACK
                    So?

                                  EDDIE
                    So, fuck you, Jack.

                                  HADLEY
                    Would you please watch your 
                    language in my office!

                                  JACK
                    It feels wrong, doesn t it? All 
                    that slog, all those hunches. 
                          (softening)
                    You just don t want it to be him, 
                    Scoop... I was the same once...

                                  EDDIE
                    You re in their pockets.

                                  JACK
                    What are you talking about?

                                  EDDIE
                    The Police going about their 
                    business, supported by the good old 
                    Yorkshire Post!

                    Bitter pill. You ll get used to it 
                    one day.

                    I ll handle the Press Conference,

                                  HADLEY
                    Thanks, Jack.

      Jack leaves. Eddie s eyes go to a card on Hadley s desk... 

                                  HADLEY
                    I don t want you coming to the 
                    office like this.

                                  EDDIE
                    Like what?

                                  HADLEY

      The card Eddie stares at is one of Dawson s house, 
      "Shangrila" in a snow-covered forest. Just like the one in 
      Eddie s nightmares. Just like the one at Paula s house.

                                  HADLEY
                    Edward, I d like you to take the 
                    rest of the month off. Get that 
                    hand seen to...

      Eddie picks up the "Shangrila" card. Opens it:  John & 
      Marjorie Dawson invite you to Shangrila. 

                                  HADLEY
                    Do you mind!

                                  EDDIE
                    How well do you know John Dawson? 

                                  HADLEY
                    I m sorry, Edward. Really I am. But 
                    I don t have the time for your 
                      adolescent conspiracy theories.

      Hadley snatches the card away from Eddie.

      EXT. FITZWILLIAM, NEWSTEAD VIEW - LATE DAY105105

      Eddie, under the iron bridge - through the crumbling mining 
      town. 


106106EXT. NEWSTEAD VIEW - LATE DAY                  

      Eddie pulls over. He walks down the gloomy road. Past closed, 
      cramped front rooms. Black moors stretch beyond. Number 66 
      has been wrecked. Eddie heads through the rubbish strewn 
      garden. 


106A106AINT. 66 NEWSTEAD VIEW - LATE DAY                  

      Eddie creeps through the trashed interior - smashed glass, 
      human excrement, a melted plastic Christmas tree. Water drips 
      through the ceiling...


106B106BINT. 66 NEWSTEAD VIEW, UPSTAIRS - LATE DAY                  

      The toilet bowl and basin are smashed. More graffiti: Wogs 
      Out. Fuck the Provos. Eddie turns off the bath taps. Water 
      slops over the side. A dead cat protruding from a coal sack 
      floats in the brown water.1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      66
                   


    A plastic plate reads: Michael s Room. Eddie enters the cell-
      like room. A smashed bed, torn curtains, a floor covered in 
      comics. Eddie pushes them with his foot: The Hulk, Kung-Fu... 
      a sketch book. He picks it up.

                              RAT MAN, PRINCE OR PEST?!  

        A child-like drawing of a crowned giant rat with human hands 
      and feet sitting on a throne. RAT MAN says:  Men are not our 
      judges. We judge men! 

                                  EDDIE
                    Christ... 

      Eddie turns the page to see: Rat Man flies on swan s wings.

                                  VOICE OFF
                    Pervert!

      Eddie spins round. Nearly has a heart attack. TWO SNOTTY BOYS 
      crowd the doorway. One has a hammer. Eddie recovers.

                                  EDDIE
                    What are you doing?

                                  EDDIE
                    No. 

                                  BOY 1
                    We can do what we want, then.

                                  EDDIE
                    You know Michael Myshkin, do you?

                                  BOY 1
                    He s a pervert.

                                  EDDIE
                    Where s the family?

                                  BOY 1
                    Pissed off.

                    His dad was on Sick because of 
                    dust.

                                  BOY 1
                    His dad was a sp-sp-sp-spastic!

      They laugh.

                                  BOY 2
                    And his mum s a fucking evil witch.1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      67
                   


      Eddie pockets the comic, heads for the doorway - tries to 
      distract the brats.

                    Dead cat in there.

                                  BOY 2
                    Yeah. We killed it.

      Eddie has to push past them. 


107107EXT. 66 NEWSTEAD VIEW - LATE DAY                  

      Eddie gets to the doorway. A THIRD BOY blocks his way, 
      playing with a washing line noose. Behind him, the first boy 
      starts hacking at the wall with his hammer. 

                                  BOY 3
                    You going to give us some brass?

                                  EDDIE
                    Nope.
                          (nods at the noose)
                    What s that for?

                    That s enough, boys.

      Martin Laws heads for Eddie from across the street. A TIRED 
      MUM is with him.

                                  MARTIN LAWS
                    Johnny! You mother s been looking

                    Come here, you!

      The tired mum grabs one of the boys. 

                                  MUM
                    Thank you, Reverend Laws.

                    Clear off, you lot. Go on!

      The boys slouch off. They throw stones from a safe distance.

                    Digging up the dirt, are you? 

                                  EDDIE
                    Think he did it?

                    If Mrs. Cole and I hadn t got

                    his life. Who s to say how he d 
                    turn out...

      They look off across the allotments and the Moors beyond into 
      the gathering darkness. Laws takes Eddie by the arm.

                                  MARTIN LAWS
                    I ll see you to your car. You

      They get to Eddie s car.

                                  MARTIN LAWS
                    I chose to come to this place, Mr.

      INT. PAULA GARLAND S HOUSE, HALLWAY - EVENING108108

      Paula opens the door to Eddie. Pale-faced, on the edge, red 
      cardigan pulled tight round her.

                                  PAULA
                    Where ve you been? 1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      69

                                  PAULA
                    Did you see Myshkin? What did he *
                    look like?

                                  EDDIE
                    Shut the door, love. It s cold.


      INT. PAULA GARLAND S HOUSE, FRONT ROOM - EVENING109109

      Top of the Pops. Eddie Holman sings  (Hey There) Lonely 
      Girl . Paula stares at Jeanette s photo.

                                  PAULA
                    She s dead, isn t she...

      Eddie lights up, passes it to Paula. He puts his arms round 
      her. Kisses her eyes closed. A new number. Barry White. Eddie 
      and Paula sway together to the breathy music... They look at 
      one another and realise they ve fallen for the Sultan of 
      Smooth Soul. Laughter through tears. A moment together.

                                  EDDIE
                    They ve got sunshine down South, 
                    seaview flats, warm summer breezes. 
                    We could go there now. Never come 
                    back...


      INT. PAULA GARLAND S HOUSE, HER BEDROOM - DEEP NIGHT110110

      Paula and Eddie. Clothes drawn off. Clothes draped over a 
      chair. In one another s arms. Tears. Embracing. Falling 
      apart. Embracing again. Making and re-making knots...

      Eddie and Paula. Fitfully sleeping and waking. Unused to one 
      another. Moving in their sleep. Dreaming. Haunted...

      Eddie turns over. He s alone. Paula has melted away into the 
      darkness. Her clothes are gone from the chair... He listens 
      to her moving through the house...


      INT. PAULA GARLAND S HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHT111111

      Paula slips into her coat, then quietly heads out the front 
      door... Eddie comes down the stairs, still pulling on his 
      shirt... The front door closes after Paula...


      EXT. PAULA GARLAND S HOUSE - NIGHT112112

      Eddie emerges into the silent street. Far away down the road, 
      Paula s figure dissolves into the darkness...1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      70
                   


      EXT. STREETS - NIGHT113113

      Paula walks through the night. Expressionless, moving like a 
      sleepwalker...

      Eddie following. An oncoming car s headlights illumines her 
      up ahead. A ghostly white figure that flits away down a 
      lane...

      Eddie knows this place...


      EXT. LANE & SHANGRILA - NIGHT114114

      Eddie follows Paula s figure up a dark, leafy lane lined with 
      high walls. Fairy lights are strung in the trees... 

      Eddie watches Paula buzz the gated grounds of the luxurious 
      bungalow.  Shangrila ... He watches her slip through and head 
    up to the house. The gates swing closed after her. 


      INT. REDMOOR CAFE AND MOTEL, ROOM 27 - DAWN115115

      An empty bottle. Eddie is in a deep drunken sleep. The room 
      is trashed.

      Sounds of trucks outside the motel. Lights travel across the 
      dingy room and across his shrine - the photos of 
       Shangrila ... 

      The drawing of the golden crowned Rat Man on a throne is 
      pinned to the wall. Rat Man dominates Eddie s shrine to his 
      investigation; the columns and lists and photographs.  

                                RAT MAN, PRINCE OR PEST?
                      Men are not our judges. We judge men!


      INT/EXT. VIVA / THE KARACHI SOCIAL CLUB - DAY116116

      Eddie parks up outside: THE KARACHI SOCIAL CLUB. He gets out - 
      heads for the restaurant and club.


      INT. THE KARACHI SOCIAL CLUB - DAY117117

      Eddie comes through the vast red restaurant. Dark, hot 
      colours. Heavy Indian drapes. Hindu gods. White tablecloths. 
      Heavy silver. Indian muzak. Empty. WAITERS IN WHITE COLONIAL 
      UNIFORMS lay out dishes. A FLUNKY comes to Eddie.

                                  EDDIE
                    I m here to see Mr. John Dawson.

                                  FLUNKY
                    Mr. Dawson. One second, sir.1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      71
                   


      The flunky aims Eddie at the bar where the barmaid - CLARE 
      STRACHAN - cleans glasses. 

      Eddie watches the flunky go down the far end to a cordoned 
      VIP area. John Dawson and Jason King Moustache sit at a *
      table. The flunky speaks to Dawson.

                                  CLARE
                    What s it to be, hen?

                                  EDDIE
                    On the big man, is it?

      Dawson approaches Eddie, grinning.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    It s all right, Clare, he s with 
                    me... Same again, love.

      Clare drops her cheery smile. Does as she s told. 

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                          (to Eddie)
                    You look like shit.

                                  EDDIE
                    Up all night. What s your excuse?

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    I ve got my weaknesses, lad. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Paula Garland one of them?

      A second... Then the big man laughs, puts an arm round Eddie 
      and guides him away... 

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Me and Paula go back a long way. 
                    Old friends.

      Three pints are brought on a silver tray. Eddie, John Dawson 
      and Jason King are seated round the table in the snug. Jason *
      lights Eddie s cigarette.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    I like this place. It s private. 
                    Just the wogs and us. That s how I 
                    like things. Private. Cheers.

      The waiter arrives with the food.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Another round, Sammy. And bring 
                    over the pud trolley. I want to

      John Dawson upends his deep red sauce over yellow rice. He 
      and Jason King start shovelling it in. *

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Get stuck in, lad. We don t stand 
                    on ceremony here. Hope you like 
                    your curry hot.

                                  EDDIE
                    I only had it once before.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Let me pile a load of this on for 
                    you. 

      John Dawson loads pickles and yoghurt on a popadum and shoves 
      it at Eddie. Eddie tentatively tries some. Too hot for him. 

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    If you don t mind me asking, what 
                    are you working on at the moment?

                                  EDDIE
                    The Clare Kemplay murder.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Bloody appalling. There aren t 
                    words, are there. They got the 
                    cunt, didn t they?

                                  EDDIE
                    Looks like it, yeah.

      The pints arrive. A waiter pushes a dessert trolley draped 
      with a sheet.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Here we go. I think you know we ve 
                    got an important investment over at 
                    Hunslet Carr... Feast your eyes.

      Dawson pulls off the sheet to reveal a perfect little 
      architect s model of the proposed shopping centre. 

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Look it s got little trees and 
                      everything. What your Yanks call a 
                    shopping mall. You got your high 
                    street chains, your cinema, bowling 
                    alley, caffs, restaurant, all under 
                    one roof. Put a hotel in there and 
                    there s no need to fuck off home.

                                  EDDIE
                    So what s the problem?

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    I ve got investors to look after, 
                    haven t I.  

                                  EDDIE
                    Bill Molloy one of them?

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Don t be a cunt. Course Bill 
                    Molloy s one of them. Not the only 
                    copper neither... Give it to him, 
                    Paul.

      Jason King pushes an A4 envelope across the rapidly staining *
      tablecloth to Eddie. Dawson keeps shovelling food.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Open it.

      Eddie deliberates. It s the same size and colour as the 
      envelope that contained Clare Kemplay s post-mortem...

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Take a fucking look, lad.

      A breath. Eddie pulls out large black and white photos.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                      I apologise for the vile content of 
                    these snaps, Mr. Dunford. I hear 
                    you re a bit of a cunt man. 

      The photos: Glimpses of two men in flagrante. One is BJ. The 
      other is a older, greying man. John Dawson and Jason King *
      continue to stuff themselves.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Sticks in the craw, doesn t it? I 
                    mean, how can they do it?

                                  EDDIE
                    Who is it?

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Who is it?! Bloody hell. How the 
                    mighty have fallen. That s 
                      Councillor William Shaw, that is;

                    Labour Party. That s your Man Most 
                    Likely to Succeed, that is.

      John Dawson pulls out a cigar. Jason lights it.*1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      74

      Cuts deep. A still moment.

                    Come on, Eddie, I need a little

                    Barry s dead, isn t he! 

      Eddie s on his feet. Dawson leans across - his hand goes to 
      Eddie s balls. He squeezes. Clare watches from the bar.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                      I respected Barry. He was a good 
                    man. His problem was he had his own 
                    agenda...  

                                  EDDIE

      Robot aliens are eating instant mashed potato on the TV. 
      Eddie s slumped on the sofa, half-cut, watching Paula fix a

      Eddie thrusts his damaged hand at her face.

      INT. REDMOOR CAFE AND MOTEL, ROOM 27 - EVENING121121

      Eddie works in the gloomy room: He piles up photos, drawings, 
      notes, transcripts. Collects his tapes - each one labelled: 
      LEONARD COLE . BJ . JOHN DAWSON. Throws everything into a 
      carrier bag. 

      Sound of a car arriving outside. Eddie pours two Scotches and 
      waits... A tap at the door... 

                                  EDDIE
                    Come in, Sergeant.

      Sergeant Bob Fraser enters. He looks round the miserable 
      room. 1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      77
                   


                                  EDDIE
                    Married, Sergeant?

                                  BOB FRASER
                    Just. Yeah. You?

      A thought for Eddie. He shakes his head.

                                  EDDIE
                    Hard life - married to a copper.

                                  BOB FRASER
                    She knows the score. 

      Eddie offers him a Scotch. He shakes his head.

                                  EDDIE
                    You re one of the good ones, right? 
                    Not many of them left... 

      Eddie passes Fraser the carrier bag.

                                  EDDIE
                    Barry Gannon s work. And more. High

                    See for yourself. It s all there...

                    Too fucking hard. Thought I could 
                    do it. I can t.

      Fraser peers at Eddie s research pinned to the wall - the web 
      of deceit and lies: SUSAN RIDYARD . JEANETTE GARLAND . CLARE

      Eddie drives. The Hollies sing everything right with the 
      world. He s free. He s laughing...


      EXT. PAULA GARLAND S HOUSE - NIGHT123123

      Eddie pulls up. Gets out. The house is in darkness. 
      Something s wrong...

      Eddie tries the door. No one answers. It s locked.


124124INT. PAULA GARLAND S HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT                  

      Eddie smashes the window - forces the kitchen door. Into the 
      kitchen. Stands there, listening. Glass in his hand. Blood 
      dripping on the Lino. Silence in the house. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Paula!

      Eddie, into the front room. On the TV, the framed photo of 
      Jeanette... Beside it is the card of "Shangrila" in a snow-
      covered forest. Eddie opens it:  John & Marjorie Dawson 
      invite you to Shangrila. 

      Eddie grabs a bottle of whisky. Swigs it. Slumps on the sofa. *
      Reaches for the phone. Dials a number... *

      He hangs up. *


      INT/EXT. VIVA / LANE - NIGHT128128

      Eddie cruises up the dark, leafy lane. He rounds a bend. 
      Glimmering lights loom ahead. 


      EXT. SHANGRILA - NIGHT129129

      Eddie parks up amongst the Jags and Mercs and BMWs. He gets 
      out and heads for the illuminated facade of "Shangrila".

      Eddie waves Paula s invite at the TWO FLUNKIES on the gates 
      and walks up the floodlit drive. Ice underfoot. The windows 
      are ablaze with golden light. WOMEN IN EVENING GOWNS and MEN 
      IN TUXEDOS drift around inside. Drinking. Laughing. Chatting. 
      Strains of Johnny Mathis.


      INT. SHANGRILA, HALLWAY - NIGHT130130

      Eddie comes through into the golden light. Last time he was 
      here was in a dream. This is real. Bow ties. Long dresses. 
      Frilled shirts. Cigars and whiskies. He keeps going - headed 
      for the back room and the noise.


      INT. SHANGRILA, LOUNGE - NIGHT131131

      Eddie enters the lounge. The music is up. RED-FACED MEN and 
      WOMEN with too much slap crowd down the far end. Eddie 
      recognises his editor, Bill Hadley talking to Bill Molloy. He 
      almost laughs.

                                  EDDIE
                    Hello, Mr. Hadley. Looking after 
                    the Yorkshire Post s special 
                      relationship are we? 

      Molloy nods to HEAVIES. Hard men head for Eddie. 

      Eddie keeps going. Garden torches flare in the garden beyond 
      the tall windows. Seated beneath them like the White Queen is 
      Marjorie Dawson. 

      Beside her is Martin Laws with BJ in a suit - flares and 
      lapels you d cut your fingers on. He meets Eddie s look, 
      shakes his head at him. 

      John Dawson pushes his way through, flanked by Jason King. He *
      embraces Eddie.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Eddie, lad. There are people here

                                  EDDIE
                    I want to see Paula. I m not 
                      interested in your filthy little 
                    world. I came for Paula. 
                          (shouting)
                    Paula! Paula!

      Jason King collars Eddie. He meets Dawson s nasty smile.*

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    She s long gone, son... But you 
                    know that, don t you...

                                  EDDIE
                    Where is she?!

      Eddie punches and kicks his way out of Jason King s grasp. He *
      blunders through the panicking crowd. ANOTHER MAN floors him. 
      He crashes to the ground. Finds himself at Marjorie Dawson s 
      feet. She bends to him - trembling - mad...

                                  MARJORIE DAWSON
                    Please tell them about the 
                    others... beneath those beautiful 
                    new carpets, beneath the grass that 
                    grows between the cracks...

      The same words Myshkin used. Before Eddie can respond, he s 
      yanked away by his hair.

                                  HENCHMAN
                    Outside.

      Fireworks explode outside. The party crowd rush to the 
      windows to see the dispaly.

      Eddie is dragged away from Marjorie Dawson by the heavies. 

      Marjorie watches, trembling, from the doorway. 


      EXT. SHANGRILA - NIGHT132132

      Eddie is dragged out of the house, down the drive towards the 
      gates. Fireworks explode in the sky.

      A black police van and an unmarked car roar to a halt at the 
      end of the drive. TEN POLICEMEN emerge. Some armed. Including 
      Dick Alderman and Jim Prentice. Hands reach out for Eddie... 
      The police hurl him into the black van, then jump in with 
      him. The doors slam to.

      INT. WAKEFIELD POLICE STATION, THE BELLY, ROOM 1 - NIGHT134134*

      Flash photographs are taken of Eddie.

      His bandages are cut off his hand. His nails are scraped.

      More flash photographs.

    A torch is shone in Eddie s eye. His mouth is wiped with a 
      spatula.


      INT. WAKEFIELD POLICE STATION, THE BELLY, ROOM 2 - NIGHT135135

      Alderman and Prentice aim a firehose at Eddie handcuffed to a 
      chair. The freezing water pins him to the floor.

      The door slams shut. Locks. Eddie, left panting on the floor, 
      still handcuffed. Silence. He lies, shivering in a pool of 
      water. The bright lights hum. The sound of a dog barking and 
      screams from a nearby room. The eye at the spy-hole watches 
      Eddie.

                                  EDDIE
                    What do you want?! Tell me what you

      Silence. Eddie, shivering on the floor, still handcuffed. 

      The door opens. Old friends enter. The Two Bobs. Craven and 
      Douglas.

                    Oh, fuck. No.

      Craven unlocks the cuffs - throws them to Douglas who puts a 
      blanket over Eddie s shoulders.

      Eddie does as he s told. His right hand is a mess. Douglas 
      paces behind him. Craven sits opposite. Suddenly Craven 
      brings the cuffs down on Eddie s poor hand. He screams.

                    Put your hands back.

      Douglas offers Craven a cigarette. They light up. 

                                  EDDIE
                    What do you want?

      Douglas dangles his cigarette over Eddie s hand. 

                                  EDDIE
                    What do you want?

      Douglas mashes out his cigarette on Eddie s hand. 

                                  CRAVEN
                    Put your hands back.

      Whimpering, Eddie does as he s told. Craven offers Douglas 
      another cigarette. He lights up. Eddie stands up.

                                  EDDIE
                    Just tell me what you want!

                    Sit down.

      Eddie sits. Douglas and Craven stand.

                                    DOUGLAS
                    Stand up.

      They move the chairs and table to the walls.

                    Don t move!

      They leave the room. Eddie stands there, hands over his 
      genitals. Screams and barking come from an adjoining room. He 
      stays where he was told. Shivering. Afraid. Alone...

      SOME TIME LATER:

      Eddie is curled naked in a corner. The door slams open. 
      Craven and Douglas return. Eddie staggers to his feet.1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      83

      Craven kicks Eddie in the crotch. He goes down. Douglas cuffs 
      his hands behind him. Tape goes over his mouth. A black hood 
      goes over his head.


      INT. WAKEFIELD POLICE STATION, CORRIDOR - NIGHT138138

      Hooded, Eddie is dragged and kicked down the corridor by 
      Craven and Douglas.

      The hood is pulled from Eddie s head. He s reeling. Blinded 
      by the strip lighting. Mouth taped up. Craven and Douglas 
      hold him. Bill Molloy stands in front of a medical trolley 
      covered with a green sheet. Molloy grabs the sheet and pulls 
      it back to reveal...

      Eddie tries to scream through the tape. His eyes start from 
      their sockets. Blood thumps into his head...

      Lying on the autopsy trolley is the body of Paula Garland. 

      Eddie s legs give way. He s screaming and vomiting behind the 
      gag. Craven and Douglas keep him upright.

                                  MOLLOY
                    Look at her! Look at her!

      Molloy drags Eddie s face close to the corpse s. Eddie s 
      choking and writhing. Craven pulls off the tape.

      Molloy pauses. He looks up. Standing in the door is the 
      owlish Maurice Jobson. He is very solemn. He gives his head a 
      slight shake at Molloy... 

                                  MOLLOY
                    Stay with him.

      Molloy crosses to Jobson. They go outside. The door shuts us 
      out... 

      But the little viewing window is open. We can see the two men 
      arguing. But we can t hear what they re saying... Jobson is 
      pleading, arguing a case. Molloy is tight lipped... Then 
      Molloy appears to be deliberating...

                    You loved her...

      Molloy gestures to Craven and Douglas. They stand back. 
      Watching the show. Molloy turns Eddie s face up to his.

                                  MOLLOY

      INT/EXT. VAN / COUNTRY ROAD - DAY141141

    A black sack is pulled off Eddie s head. He s kneeling at the 
      open back doors of the van. Craven and Douglas hold him. The 
      van tears down the country road. Craven takes out a Smith and *
      Wesson handgun. Douglas hands him bullets.*

                                    DOUGLAS
                    They said it s OK.

      Craven points the Smith and Wesson at Eddie s face. Eddie *
      screws up his eyes. Waiting for it... There s a click.

      Craven checks the gun. He points it at Eddie s head again. 
      Eddie pisses himself. There s a huge explosion. Eddie opens 
      his eyes. It was a blank. Craven and Douglas guffaw. Then 
      Craven gives him a big hug.

                                  CRAVEN
                    You all right, mate?

      Douglas hands Craven a fistful of live ammunition. Craven 
      loads the Smith and Wesson. Then he shoves the gun into *
      Eddie s pocket. The smiles vanish.

                                  CRAVEN
                    This is the North. We do what we

      CRACK! Eddie s head hits the tarmac. The van disappears off.

      Eddie lies in the road in a heap. His legs move. He starts to 
      stand. Falls over. Stands again. Like a broken puppet. A car 
      heads for him - swerves to a halt inches away. 

      A WOMAN DRIVER leans down to Eddie. He looks at her hair *
      against the sky. Like Paula s.

      Eddie drives the Viva to the bottom of "Shangrila" s drive. 
      No security. He rams the gates open. Enough to squeeze 
      through and head for the house. "Shangrila" is ablaze with 
      house lights. 


      INT. SHANGRILA, HALLWAY - EVENING151151

      Eddie enters the hall. The house is empty, silent but for the 
      doleful sound of Mahler s Kindertotenlieder:  Now I can see 
      why such dark flames / You flashed at me...  Eddie follows 
      the sound - away from the lounge where the party was - into 
      the other wing...


152152INT. SHANGRILA, SWAN ROOM - EVENING                  

      Eddie follows the music through double doors into a vast 
      studio. Two life-size bronze casts of flapping swans flank 
      the fireplace. An enormous photograph of a swan taking off 
      from a black lake hangs above. Swans are everywhere - glass 
      ornaments, china ornaments, stuffed swans are arranged on 
      every surface. 

      Mahler s songs to the Death of Children fades:  What are only 
      eyes to you in those days / In future nights will be but 
      stars...  The stylus remains caught in the groove. Hiss and 
      click. 1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      87
                   


      Another sound. Mrs. Dawson is crouched in a corner, rocking *
      in time to the music that s over. She s been beaten. She *
      rocks, her eyes on him. Boozed and pilled up. Eddie stoops

      a handful. Eddie knocks them out of her reach. Marjorie *
      Dawson whimpering on the sofa. He grabs her - slaps her *

      Tools. Blood. Adult smiles...
