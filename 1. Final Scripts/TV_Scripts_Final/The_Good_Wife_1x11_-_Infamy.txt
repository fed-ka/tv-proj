      INT.  GIMME SOME TRUTH  STUDIO - DAY11

                                  DUKE
                    Let s review, shall we? 

      DUKE ROSCOE, a cross between Glenn Beck, Keith Olberman, 
      Howard Stern.  A smart, savvy entertainer: a walking 
      advertisement for shouting  fire  in a crowded theatre. 

                                  DUKE (CONT D)
                    Three months ago, 2-year-old Jamie 
                    Willens disappeared.  Her mother, 
                    Cheryl, claimed she was snatched 
                    from her shopping cart in a Chicago 
                    grocery store.

      Behind him, photos appear: Cheryl Willens; her cute 2-year-old 
      daughter at a birthday party; images from the crime scene.  

                                  DUKE (CONT D)
                    The police looked high and low for 
                    Jamie and this mysterious kidnapper 
                    and found nothing.  For three whole 
                    months.  Why?  BECAUSE SHE S LYING, 
                    PEOPLE.  She killed her kid!

    Cut TO: Duke on another day... Behind him a sound bite of 
      CHERYL WILLENS (25), a nervous mom, in her driveway:

                                  CHERYL WILLENS
                    I turned away from my shopping cart 
                    for just a second-- just one second-- 

      A big  FAIL  appears on her face...  

                                  DUKE
                    It s day 153 of Cheryl Willens 
                    walking free among us, and, guess 
                    what, Ms. Willens is going back to 
                    her job as-- a school teacher.  
                    That s right, teachingkids-- 
                    because that makes sense.  Now if 
                    you re a concerned citizen like me 
                    then let me give you the e-mail 
                    address of the school district--

    The show is playing on a monitor in the large conference room 
      where...   THE GOOD WIFE #110    "Infamy"    GOLD COLLATED    11/18/09       2.



      INT. 28TH FLOOR - LARGE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY22

                                  DIANE
                    Make it shorter clips.  Grab the 
                    attention of the jury.

      CARY, ALICIA, and three other lawyers nod, take notes as they 
      show the edited tape to Diane on the monitor in the large 
      conference room.  Another clip, another time.  

                                  DUKE (ON SCREEN)
                    It s now Day 285 since Cheryl 
                    Willens killed her baby, and I have 
                    learned the reason Ms. Willens was 
                    in the store at all: to buy condoms!  

                                  DIANE
                    Put how many months under it.

      Cary nods, types on a computer--   

                                  DUKE (ON SCREEN)
                    Yes, it s impolite to say it, but if 
                    the Chicago cops got off their 
                    Dunkin Donut asses and dragged Lake 
                    Michigan, they d find her body! 

                                  DIANE
                    Don t need that.  Just cut it off 
                    at  kill her baby.   

                                  CARY
                    He s a prince, isn t he?

                                  DIANE
                    The gift that keeps on giving.  Do 
                    you have him from last night?

      Cary s not sure, looks toward Alicia.  Clearly she was the 
    one who cut it together.

                                  ALICIA
                    The last file.

      Cary nods, clicks, as WILL appears at the door on his cell:

                                  WILL
                    Come on, you know you re just 
                    managing a disaster here. 
                          (off Diane s look)
                    The network lawyer.  Making one 
                    last stab at a settlement.

                                  WILL (CONT'D)
                          (into the phone)
                    Yes, and you ve been shedding 
                      advertisers like a dog sheds fleas.

      INTERCUT with...

      INT. CHICAGO HOTEL SUITE - DAY33

                                  EMILY
                    Good thing we have a lot of fleas 
                    to shed.   

      EMILY TATUM (31). A stunningly beautiful litigator. An ABA wet 
      dream.  Tries to mask her beauty under cool glasses and a MENSA 
      membership.  In her Four Seasons-type hotel suite, unpacking.

                                  WILL
                    You really want to go to court?

                                  EMILY
                    Hey, I just flew in from LA and 
                    ordered a massage.  Why would I want 
                    to go back so fast?  

      Will laughs.  Diane looks toward him.  Will shrugs: nothing-- 
      shoots a look toward Alicia before starting out of the room:

                                  WILL
                    What re you doing at that network 
                    anyway?  You used to be the cool 
                    one with all the tattoos.

                                  EMILY
                    I m still the cool one.  I just get 
                    room service now--

                                  WILL
                    Shh, I m listening to your client.

      A new clip of a suddenly serious and subdued Duke perched on 
    the edge of his newscaster desk, hands folded:

                                  DUKE (ON SCREEN)
                    On day 312 of Cheryl Willens  freedom, 
                    the Murdering Mom took her own life-- 
                    hanging herself from her closet door.  
                    And you know what her husband does?  
                    SUES ME.  That s right.  Accusing me 
                    of wrongful death.   






                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #110    "Infamy"    GOLD COLLATED    11/18/09       4.

      CONTINUED:33


                                  WILL
                    Did you catch Duke Roscoe last 
                    night, Emily?

      Emily pauses slightly: only the tiniest flash of worry.

                                  EMILY
                    You re not gonna scare me with some 
                    Duke-ism, Will?  He s our most 
                    profitable commentator.  We re not 
                    gonna do anything to hurt that.

                                  WILL
                    We have two Junior Associates who 
                    made it their job to watch Duke 
                    Roscoe.  I think you might want to 
                    hear what Duke said last night.

      Will holds the cell up toward the screen... 

                                  DUKE (ON SCREEN)
                    Well, you know what, I m glad she s 
                    dead.  That s right.  The more 
                    guilty people who commit suicide, 
                    the less we ll crowd the courts.  
                    And I don t care how many 
                      advertisers I scare away saying it--

      Emily, hearing this, winces.  Will nods to Alicia-- good job-- 
    as he turns back to the phone...

                                  WILL
                    Intent.  Disregard.  Emily, you 
                    have an out of-control client--

                                  EMILY
                    He s not my client.  The network is 
                    my client-- 

                                  WILL
                    Then tell your client their 
                      spokesmanis doing everything he 
                    can to raise the settlement amount.  
                    Right now, it s...

    He looks toward Diane who raises two fingers.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    ...three million dollars.  After 
                    Duke s show tonight, my guess is 
                    we ll be up to five.  Give me a call.

                    We re not in a position to be 
                    charging retail.

                                  WILL
                    Don t worry.  She ll come in at 2.5.

                                  DIANE
                          (turns to Alicia)
                    Will that be enough?

                                  ALICIA
                    He wants to go to trial.

                                  DIANE
                    Talk to him.  Tell him how... 
                      unpredictable a trial is.

      Alicia nods, starts out, looks back at... Will, sitting at 
    the table with Diane, Cary, the three other lawyers, talking 
      strategy.  She sighs, left out, leaves.   

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - WILL S OFFICE - DAY44

    TIM WILLENS (20 s) pulls a page from a pile in his lap, hands 
    it to Alicia.  Attractive, if rough-edged, not complex but 
      soulful in a Bon Jovi way.

                                  TIM
                    I just want to be ready.  For cross-
                    examination.  I think they ll try 
                    to set me up as a money-grubber.  
                    Don t you think?  

    Tim looks up, sees Alicia is distracted.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Tim, we may not... want to go to 
                    trial.

                                  TIM
                    Why?

                                  ALICIA
                    It s a First Amendment trial.  It s 
                    hard to go up against Duke s right 
                    to free speech.

                                  TIM
                    Yes, but we ll have the jury s 
                    sympathy, right?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #110    "Infamy"    GOLD COLLATED    11/18/09       6.

      Alicia nods, smiles.  The guy s smart.

                                  ALICIA
                    We re more likely to make a... fair 
                    settlement if we don t go to trial.

                    But a trial will keep Jamie s face 
                    out there.  Somewhere somebody might 
                    give us a lead.  It s happened.

      Alicia nods, but it s hard to believe.  Tim pauses.

                                  TIM (CONT'D)
                    You know, he s still on TV saying 
                    my wife is burning in hell.

                                  ALICIA
                    I know.

                                  TIM
                    People say  don t watch it.   But 
                    he has fans-- people still phoning 
                    me... I saw her body.  I saw my 
                    wife hanging-- 
                          (ripped up)
                    I don t have a TV show.  I don t 
                    have anybody listening to me.  I 
                    can answer him in court.  

      Alicia nods.  This is hard.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Tim, you don t want to be obsessing 
                    on this.  You talked about using 
                    the settlement money to search for 
                    your daughter.  

    Tim is listening now, eyes wet, but eyeing Alicia.

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    If we settle, that is money you can 
                    use now.  If we go to court... I 
                    don t know if you ll ever...

                                  TIM
                    You think I should do this?  Settle?

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes.

    Tim stares at Alicia.  Nods.  Nods.

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - HALLWAY - DAY55

      Alicia exhales as she exits.  This is always hard.  She sees 
      Cary down the hall, starting off.  Will and Diane going the 
      other way.  Alicia rushes to catch up to Cary...

                                  ALICIA
                    What happened?

                                  CARY
                    Oh, hey.  Lots.  Where were you?  
                    Oh, with Tim.  How is he?

                                  ALICIA
                    He s fine.  What happened?

                                  CARY
                    Oh, yeah. Come on. I ll catch you up.

      Alicia sighs.  Always having to tag along with Cary.

      INT. 27TH FLOOR - BULLPEN - DAY66

                                  CARY
                    The network lawyers are coming over 
                    in an hour.  That clip from last 
                    night really did the trick.

      Cary and Alicia start down the stairs...

                                  ALICIA
                    They re settling?

                                  CARY
                    Conference room in one hour.  I 
                    don t even think they watch their 
                    own show-- they re afraid of the 
                    bad publicity.  

    And Cary starts toward his office as Alicia turns to her own.  
    She pauses at her door, finding...

      INT. 27TH FLOOR - ALICIA S OFFICE - DAY77

                                  DAVID LEE
                    I m borrowing you.

      DAVID LEE, (50 s), a warm, avuncular gentleman in monochrome 
      colors, was probably gay before gay was okay.  He has a very 
      large tin canister with a bow on top.

                    Oh, yes.  I m sorry, hello.  The 
                    divorce lawyer?

    He smiles at the dismissiveness.  Used to it. 

                                  DAVID LEE
                    Yes,  the divorce lawyer.   
                          (bluetooth)
                    Well, give him a magazine.

                    We re starting a softball league, 
                    and I wanted to know if you were up

                    greet in 45 minutes to hand-hold a 
                    client.  Upstairs.  

    And he s out the door...

                                  ALICIA
                    Wait, I ve got a settlement on the 
                    Duke Roscoe case in an hour.

                                  DAVID LEE
                    Yes, at the moment we re the only 
                    division making money so we out-

    And David Lee is already out the door.  Alicia frowns, kicks 
    her door closed-- BANG.  KALINDA, hearing it outside, crosses 
    to the door, peers in...

                                  KALINDA
                    Did you want this closed?

      Alicia doesn t smile...

                    one who hand-holds clients.  I m

      Emily smiles, staring right at Will.  To the side a spread of

                    I would ve kicked your ass.

      A big settlement conference.  Emily and a half dozen male 
      lawyers backing her up.  Will, Cary, four other lawyers, and 
      a late arriving Diane.  Ready to start.

                    Okay, we don t need to make this 
                    any bigger than it is.  The network 
                    doesn t want a long, drawn-out 
                    trial.  We would like to move on.

                    You mean from Cheryl Willens suicide

                    That wasn t selling.  That was

      Emily smiles, starts to gather paper from her other lawyers:

                    Over the phone, Will and I talked 
                    about 2 million.  

                                  WILL
                    Actually, we talked about three 
                    million, and a retraction.

                                  EMILY
                    Oh, I must vemisheard.  The 
                    network might be able to go to 2.5, 
                    but any retraction would have to be 
                    worked out separately with Duke.  
                    We only  advise  on content. 

                                  WILL
                    Well, then you might have to throw 
                    in... something extra.

      Emily smiles, her and Will s eyes connected. 

                                  EMILY
                    Well, then, let s haggle.

      Meanwhile, Alicia walks by the conference room, frozen out as 
    she passes, turns toward... THE GOOD WIFE #110    "Infamy"    GOLD COLLATED    11/18/09       11.



      INT. 28TH FLOOR - DAVID LEE S OFFICE - DAY1010

      ...David Lee s office.  Overstuffed chairs.  Rounded corners.  
    Not a harsh contour anywhere.  Bowls of candy.  David Lee 
      waves Alicia in as he continues with the client...

                                  DAVID LEE
                    ...Mind you, I have had my share of 
                    vengeful husbands as well.  Alicia. 
                    There you are.  Carla Browning.

      CARLA BROWNING (late 30s).  An elegant woman.  Poised.  At 
    one time a classical pianist.  They shake hands...

                                  CARLA
                    Nice to meet you, Mrs. Florrick.  I 
                    think I m a fan.

    Ah, that s why she s here.  Scandal as sales tool. 

                                  ALICIA
                    Thank you-- I think.

                    Chocolate raisins?

      David offers a bowl.  He enjoys himself in these sessions.  
      There s a glee about him.  

                                  CARLA
                    No, thanks.  Funny, most divorce 
                    lawyers have Kleenex.  

                                  DAVID LEE
                    Yes, I find it harder for clients 
                    to cry when their mouths are full 
                    of M&Ms.  Have you been to many 
                    divorce attorneys, Ms. Browning?

                                  CARLA
                    A few.  We seem to have a series of 
                    relapses: my husband swearing to 
                    change, me forgiving, him 
                      forgetting, both of us repeating.  I 
                    think I m done.  

      Alicia studies Carla, who looks toward her.  Alicia offers a 
      polite smile, then looks across the hall toward the 
      settlement conference-- where the real action is.  While...THE GOOD WIFE #110    "Infamy"    GOLD COLLATED    11/18/09       12.

      ...ding-- the elevator opens.  One man inside.  Typing on his 
      Blackberry.  We recognize him as Duke Roscoe.  The doors 
      start to close again when Duke sticks out a boot, stops them.  
      Finishes his e-mail, looks up.  Grins.  Showtime.  He starts 
      out.  The receptionist looks up, doubletakes.  Duke puts on 
    his best dental office voice:

                                  DUKE
                    Good morning, ma am.  Would you 
                    point me in the direction of the 
                    settlement conference?

    The receptionist stares at him.  Then limply points.  

                                  DUKE (CONT D)
                    That is a lovely pin.

    And Duke starts off.  The receptionist quickly dials a 
      number, as...

      ...Alicia glances up from note-taking, seeing Roscoe pass in 
    the hall-- what the fuck?-- he pushes into the conference 
      room as David Lee and Carla continue...

                                  CARLA
                    I moved out a week ago, and he s 
                    been calling me at all hours-- 
                      threatening calls, saying 
                      inappropriate things to our sons--  

                                  DAVID LEE
                      I understand, but I must warn you: 
                    filing a restraining order against 
                    your husband could set the stage 
                    for a very ugly divorce. 

      Alicia is distracted, seeing the conference room startled by 
      Duke s entrance.

    The spread.  Duke grabs a plate, puts fruit on it, bagels.  As 
      Will and Diane trade a look, turn back to the settlement papers.

                                  EMILY
                    We would need Mr. Willens to agree to 
                    not speak to the press, of course--

                                  DUKE
                    Do you have any cream cheese?

      Duke.  His plate piled high with bagels.  Impossibly high.  The 
      whole buffet basically poured onto his plate.  Will calls out.

                                  WILL
                    Jennette, cream cheese for Mr. Roscoe.

                                  DUKE
                    And fruit.  Pineapple.

                                  WILL
                    Pineapple too.  Would you like a 
                    bib?

      Duke only half-smiles to himself as Emily warily returns to 
    the contract...

                                  EMILY
                    Mr. Willens would have to agree to 
                    no future civil action--

                                  DUKE
                    What is this, cranberry?  
                          (a jam)

                                  DIANE
                    Yes, I believe so.  

      Will smiles, studies Duke as he comes around the table, sits 
      next to Will, with his piled-high plate.

                                  DUKE
                    Don t mind me.  I m just gonna pig 
                    out here.

    No one can keep their eyes off him eating...

                                  EMILY
                    I just want to add-- there will be 
                    no formal retraction agreement.  
                    And the amount is subject to change 
                    if there is ever found--



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #110    "Infamy"    GOLD COLLATED    11/18/09       14.

                                  DUKE
                    I m just curious.  What is the amount?  
                    How much are you guys paying?  

                                  WILL
                    2.5 Million.

                                  DUKE
                          (whistles)
                    Wow.  And is Mr. Willens paying 
                    that all out of his own pocket?  Or 
                    is your law firm helping?

      Will smiles at his faked misunderstanding. 

                                  EMILY
                    Mr. Roscoe, the network would 
                    prefer to handle this... quietly.

                                  DUKE
                    I love quietly.  I am truly a 
                      misunderstood person because my 
                    default position is quietly.  That s 
                    why I m going to say this... 
                    quietly.

    And you could hear a pin drop as all the lawyers lean in to 
      hear Duke s whisper...

                                  DUKE (CONT D)
                    If the network pays out one red 
                    commie cent, I will quit the 
                    network and take my nine million 
                    viewers with me.  If that means I 
                    have to broadcast from a barge off 
                    the coastal waters of South 
                    Carolina, I will do so rather than 
                    surrender my right of free speech.  

    And the room is silent as...

      ...Alicia still eyes it-- something going on over there.  

                                  CARLA
                    This isn t about revenge.  My 
                    husband is a very powerful man, and 
                    I m scared.  You understand that, 
                    don t you, Mrs. Florrick?

      Alicia turns to her, confused... 


                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #110    "Infamy"    GOLD COLLATED    11/18/09       15.

                                  CARLA
                    Yes.  About my husband.

                                  ALICIA
                    I-- who s you husband?

                                  CARLA
                    Oh, I thought David told you-- 

                                  DAVID LEE
                    And I just assumed, Alicia.  I m

                                  DAVID LEE
                    Her husband is Glenn Childs, the

                                  ALICIA
                          (very simply)
                    Oh. 

                                  DAVID LEE
                    Carla thought you d be sympathetic.

                                  CARLA
                    David is being euphemistic.  Given 
                    how Glenn is acting, I thought I 
                    might need a secret weapon.

                                  ALICIA
                    And that s... me?

                                  CARLA
                    Yes.

      Alicia looks between the two.  There s a loud yell from the 
      conference room, but Alicia doesn t even look.

                                  ALICIA
                    Okay.

      INT. CORRECTIONAL CENTER - PROTECTED CELL - DAY1515

      A new cell.  Modern White surfaces.  Not fancy, but clean.  
    An excited PETER with Alicia.

                                  PETER
                    It s looking good.  We may not even 
                    need to put you on the stand.  The 
                    more I make this a battle between 
                    Childs and me-- and not about sex-- 
                    I win.

      Peter pauses, notices her distraction.  She looks up:

                                  ALICIA
                    Sounds smart.

                                  PETER
                    What is it?  What s wrong?  

      Alicia studies Peter.  Not freighted.  Simple:

                                  ALICIA
                    What happens next?  You win the 
                    appeal and...

                                  PETER
                    I get a new trial.

                                  ALICIA
                    Right.  And you get bond.

    Oh, that conversation.  Peter nods.

                                  PETER
                    I want to come home.  

                                  ALICIA
                    And what does that look like?

                                  PETER
                    Coming home?  It looks like... 
                    family.  

      Alicia pauses: for the moment the practical one; Peter the 
      lyrical one:

                                  ALICIA
                    And you want to run again?

                    I don t know.  People want me to 
                    run again.

                                  ALICIA

                                  PETER
                    I... Alicia, I m getting mail.  You 
                    know that gang outreach program we 
                    talked about last year, Childs 
                    phased it out.  Just dropped it.  
                    Do you know how many neighborhoods 
                    he s putting at risk?

      Alicia studies him.

                                  ALICIA
                    I m on a divorce case right now, 
                    Peter, and I just... I see how easy 
                    it is for people to fall back into 
                    old habits.   

                                  PETER
                    But we won t.

                                  ALICIA
                    Why won t we?

                                  PETER
                    Because we see the problem.  We 
                    know what to avoid.

                                  ALICIA
                          (nods)
                    I have to go.  

      Alicia starts out the door.

                                  PETER
                    I m proud of you, Alicia.   

      Alicia nods.  Okay.  Continues out.

                    My goodness, we re crowded today.

                                  DUKE
                    I think that has to do with me,

      Duke Roscoe at the defense table.  Beside Emily.  The other 
      network lawyers behind them.  

                                  JUDGE ABERNATHY
                    Yes, I believe you re right, Mr.

                                  DUKE

                    our politics, I imagine, are day

      Will rolls his eyes beside Diane and Tim at the plaintiff s 
      table.

                    Your honor, is Duke representing

                    That s alright, Mr. Gardner.  A 
                    smidgen of informality should be 
                    allowed us all.  And, Mr. Roscoe, 
                    yes, I clearly admit we would 
                    probably agree on very little, but 
                    this court is a blind court.  And I

                    Your honor, the defense moves for a 
                    summary dismissal based on the 
                    First Amendment.  The plaintiff 
                    would deny Mr. Roscoe the right to

                                  JUDGE ABERNATHY
                    Mr. Gardner, you argue that the 
                    First Amendment guarantees the 
                    right to speak but not the right to 
                    lie.  I agree with that statement.  
                          (Diane and Will nod: good)
                    But... our case will be decided on 
                    very narrow grounds, Mr. Gardner, 
                    Ms. Lockhart.  To use your example, 
                    it s not enough to prove there was 
                    no fire in the theater, you must 
                    also prove Mr. Roscoe knewthere 
                    was no fire, or had reckless 
                    disregard for that fact.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #110    "Infamy"    GOLD COLLATED    11/18/09       20.

      Emily nods: clearly a hard hurdle to clear.

      INT. COURTHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY1818

      Bang-- Will and Diane rush out the courtroom doors, joined by 
      Cary, the other lawyers, Kalinda and a late-arriving Alicia: 

                                  DIANE
                    Okay, Kalinda and Cary, this now 
                    turns into a fact-finding case.  Who 
                    is leaking Duke all his information 
                    from the police investigation?   We 
                    need to find out whathe was given-- 
                    so we can prove he was lying. 

      Cary smiles over at a blank Kalinda.  Dynamic duo again.

                                    DIANE (CONT D)
                    And, Alicia, you keep on Tim.  Hand-
                    hold him.  Make sure he stays on 
                    the reservation--

                                  WILL
                    Actually, Alicia needs to split her 
                    time between this and the Childs 
                    divorce.

                                  DIANE
                    Oh, right.  Cary, you stay with 
                    Tim.  Hand-hold him.

    Oh, Cary s smile disappears, as Alicia sees this, smiles to 
      herself.  Meanwhile, Will sees an exiting Emily motioning to 
      him.  He goes to her...  

                                  EMILY
                    Look, we all want to save face 
                    here.  So let s talk-- outside the 
                    spotlight, Duke can t know, just 
                    you and me, and if any money 
                    changes hands, it s out of the 
                    press.

                                  WILL
                    Can we have a secret handshake?

                                  EMILY
                    Eight tonight.  My hotel.

      Will nods, starts off, sees Alicia noticing him.  THE GOOD WIFE #110    "Infamy"    GOLD COLLATED    11/18/09       21.



      INT. FIRING RANGE - DAY1919

        THRIP-THRIP-THRIP--gunfire echoes as a paper TARGET is 
      pierced by bullets.  DETECTIVE SEABROOK (the tough but human 
      detective from episode 109) lowers his gun, peers at his 
      target-- nice four-square pattern when-- 

      --BOOOM-BOOOM-BOOOM!  Explosive gunfire comes from the next 
      alley over, decimating the head of it s paper target.  
      Seabrook smiles, doesn t even have to look:

                                  SEABROOK
                    Your spray pattern is like a 
                    fingerprint, K.

      Kalinda.  Peering down the barrel of her massive gun.  BOOOM!  
    One last shot blows a hole through the target...

                                  KALINDA
                    Hey, Seabrook.

      They both slap buttons.  The targets glide back toward them.

                                  SEABROOK
                    What do you need?

                                  KALINDA
                    Why do you think I need anything?

                                  SEABROOK
                    There are twelve open alleys.  
                    You re in the one next to me.

      Kalinda smiles.  Likes Seabrook.  They both attach new 
      targets, push the button, watch the paper targets glide out.

                                  KALINDA
                    The Willens kidnapping.  Everything 
                    you have.

                                  SEABROOK
                    And what do I get out of it?  

                                  KALINDA
                    The satisfaction of doing the right 
                    thing.

                    And...? 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #110    "Infamy"    GOLD COLLATED    11/18/09       22.

                                  SEABROOK
                    You know what I want.

      Kalinda smiles.  Doesn t mind it.

                                  KALINDA
                    I don t come cheap.

                    Long as you come--

      BOOOM--BOOOOM!  They start firing again.  Pause for a second.  
      Kalinda peers around toward Seabrook.

                                  SEABROOK (CONT D)
                    It s an ongoing investigation.

                    The Lindbergh baby is an ongoing

    As they reload...

                    What do you need?  The 911 tapes?

      Kalinda pauses: 911?  News to her.  Covers well.

                                  KALINDA
                    Yep.  The 911 tapes, andthe

                    It s under lock and key.  Upstairs 
                    is upset someone is leaking this

                    Okay, two shots.  Whoever hits

                    Okay.  You first.

      Kalinda nods, aims-- BOOOM-- fires at Seabrook s target.  
      Right at the target s groin.

      Carla, another lawyer, OWEN LUSTBERG (31), the Ari Gold of 
      lawyers, and JUDGE KEELY FARMER, 50 s, social worker calm, 
      blindingly kind, but ineffective... 

                                  JUDGE FARMER
                    Let me start by saying, although 
                    this office may not have the 
                    trappings of a courtroom, both 
                    parties have agreed to arbitration, 
                    and as such, my decisions have the 
                    force of law.  Do both parties 
                      understand?

                                  CARLA
                    We seem to be only one party.

                    As you know, Mrs. Childs, your 
                    husband is a busy man.  He has 
                    asked me, as his lead attorney, to 
                    handle matters in his stead.

                                  DAVID LEE
                    There are no matters to handle in 
                    his stead.

                    You have signed a prenuptial 
                    agreement, Mrs. Childs.  The only 
                    matter to discuss is when are you 
                    moving out.

                                  DAVID LEE
                    The matterto discuss is the amount 
                    of Carla s spousal support, and 
                    whether she ll allow Mr. Childs to 
                    visit his children at all.  

                                  LUSTBERG
                    You seem to be taking for granted 
                    that my client would ignore a 
                    legally executed contract.  Why 
                    would he do that, Mrs. Childs?   

                                  CARLA
                    Because of her.

    She points toward Alicia.  Alicia clears her throat, suddenly 
    the center of attention.  David loves this, eating kettle corn.

                    his laptop.  

      Everyone turns to Lustberg.  Whoa, that s interesting.

                                  LUSTBERG
                    Is that s posedto scare him?

                          (simply)
                    Yes.

      Lustberg pauses.  The simplicity of this startling him.  He

                    Oh my god, are you blind?  

      Childs grabs her arm, stops her.

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                    I have three sons.  I have a life!

                                  ALICIA
                    Let go of me.

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                    Those envelopes on your doorstep-- 
                    that s just the beginning.  I have 
                    a lot more.  A lot more.

                                  ALICIA
                    What are you talking about?

      Alicia picks up a phone, punches four numbers.

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                    Don t play dumb.  Those photos.  
                    That DVD.  I have eight years of 
                    evidence.

                                  ALICIA
                    Then use it; who s stopping you.

                    Security, could you come to the 
                    27th floor bullpen?

      Childs lets go of her arm... 

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                    You make it about family.  I can 
                    too.

    And Childs starts away.  Alicia watches him go.  Angry.  

      INT. CHICAGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT2525

      A room service dinner.  Will and Emily finishing up.  In her 
      hotel room suite.  Emily looking stunning in backless dress.  
      Both looking through settlement agreements...

                                  EMILY
                    Look, Will, your only play is to 
                    win the sympathy of the jury.  They 
                    get so outraged they ignore jury 
                    instructions and award your poor 
                    widower something. 

                                  WILL
                    Actually I have another play.  I 
                    make your network look so bad, they 
                    pay the 4 million.   

                                  EMILY
                    Ah, four million is it now?

                                  WILL
                    And that s cheap.  I just got a 911 
                    tape of a distraught Cheryl Willens 
                    phoning the police about her 
                    missing daughter.  

                                  EMILY
                    Now I know you re bluffing.

                                  WILL
                    Yep.  Just me and a tape recorder, 
                    doing a great imitation of a 
                    panicked mom.  So did it hurt to 
                    get it removed?  
                          (off Emily s look)

                                  EMILY
                    Oh, no, it s still there.  Make-up.

    She dumps the papers on the table, gets up...

                                  EMILY
                    Nope.  Delay the trial, ask for a 
                    continuance, let Duke s head cool, 
                    and I ll get you the 2 million.  

      Will laughs as Emily grabs some cream from the bathroom, 
      starts rubbing it on her right shoulder...

                                  WILL
                    No, I think I ll chance on this 
                    jury.  I ll send you the 911 tape.  

                                  EMILY
                    I was talking to Hannah Morris, 
                    back from the old firm.  She said 
                    you were a monk these days.

                                  WILL
                    Wow.  It got bigger.

    The tattoo coming into sight as Emily removes the make-up.  A 
      mural stretching down her arm and back.  

                                  EMILY
                    Yep, it s my Monopoly board.  I 
                    keep buying property.  Hannah says 
                    you ve been on some kind of sexual 
                    sabbatical for the last six months.

                                  WILL
                    Funny, how would Hannah know?  

                                  EMILY
                    Woman keeps tabs on you, Will.

                                  WILL
                    That sounds scary.  

                                  EMILY
                    Could you get down there?

    Her lower back.  Okay, Will rubs the cream in.  

                                  WILL
                    How do you cover that part with

                    Pretty far.

      A moment of silence.  Will studying her tattooed back.  

                                  WILL
                    So we re not getting any work done

                                  WILL
                    This is a conflict of interest, you 
                    know.

                                  EMILY
                    Only if the sex is meaningful.  Be 
                    right back. 

    And Emily slips into the bathroom, the dress sliding off her 
    as she enters.  Will stands there.  Bites his lip.  Okay.  
      Sees his cellphone humming.  He picks it up.

                                  WILL
                    What s up, Diane?

                    Do you have a TV?  Check out Duke.

      Will looks around.  Yep, a flat screen.  Grabs the remote.

                                  WILL
                    What s he saying now?

      Alicia.  She listens intently to ear buds.  A static-laced 
    911 call.  Cheryl s voice... 

                                  CHERYL WILLENS (V.O.)

                    need to tell me your location!

      A nightmarish exchange.  Alicia, her eyes closed, listening.

                    A market.  I m in Quick Mart-- 
                    she s gone!  My baby! 

      A horrifying cry of pain, sobs.

                    Okay, ma am.  An officer is on the

                    Yes.   *

      There is a slight rumbling among the jury.  Duke is very *

                    tried to get a third trimester

      Duke pauses.  For the first time hesitant.  He shoots a look *

                    Cheryl was spotting.  Nothing 
                    unusual, but the poor girl was so 
                    afraid of losing her baby, she 
                    didn t even tell Tim about it.

                    I think I know why.  I m 
                    representing Marie Childs.  She s 
                    divorcing him.  

                                  PETER
                    I know.  He was here.    

                                  ALICIA
                    Childs?  He told you?  Then I need 
                    to drop this.

                                  PETER
                    Alicia, he d do it either way.  
                    It s because I mthreatening him, 
                    not you.  

      Alicia stares at Peter.  

                                  ALICIA
                    What is Triton Fields?

      Peter turns to her sharply...

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Marie Childs mentioned it.  She 
                    said I should tell you.     

                                  PETER
                    It s a development.  The owner was 
                    accused of bribing people in my 
                    office.  Childs was the prosecutor.  
                    What else did she say?  

                                  ALICIA
                    Childs had a file on his computer.  
                    That s all.

                    Can you find out more?  Will she 
                    tell you more?

      Alicia eyes him.  Takes a second.  Nods.

      INT. PIZZA PARLOR - DAY4141

      Lunchtime mix of office and blue collar patrons. Kalinda 
      enters, sees a YOUNG WOMAN, 17, at the register.  She takes 
      note of her innocent face, and name tag  I. REAGAN .

                    Did I... what did I do?  

      Kalinda pulls out her notebook, looking official.

                                  KALINDA
                    We re just following up on your

      INT. COURTHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY4242

      Will starts toward court, pauses, sees Emily smiling, waiting 
    for him.

                                  EMILY
                    So are we holding grudges?

                                  WILL
                    Not that I know of.

                                  EMILY
                    Because my tattoo misses you.

      Will looks at her, nods, nods.

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    Or are we still worried about a 
                    conflict of interest?  Because when 
                    this goes to the jury that conflict 
                    will be over.

                                  WILL
                    Let me think on it.

                                  EMILY
                    Ouch.

                                  WILL
                    Nope, no  ouch.   I just want to 
                    think on it.

                                  EMILY
                    Okay.  Think fast.

    And Emily enters court.  Will pauses, sees Alicia 
      approaching, and enters too.

      Emily shoots a look toward Duke.  He shrugs: no idea who 
      Irene is.  The two are eyed by Will, smiling to himself.

                                  WILL
                    For information on Jamie.  That was 
                    the police in Scranton.  They think 
                    they have a child matching Jamie s 
                    description.

                                  DIANE
                    Oh my god.

      They both look toward Tim staring at them.

                                  WILL
                    It was a childless couple who 
                    supposedly saw her in a shopping 
                    cart and snatched her.  One of 
                    their neighbors phoned it in for 
                    the reward.

                                  DIANE
                    I--  you want to tell him? 

                                  WILL
                    Yes.

    And Diane watches as Will crosses to him.  Speaks for a 
      second.  Another second.  Tim looks toward him.  And slumps 
      lifelessly.  Will reaches out, grabs him, supports him.

      INT. COURTHOUSE - CIRCUIT COURT ROOM #17 - DAY4646

      Alicia slips into the back of the courtroom beside Kalinda as 
    the female JURY FOREPERSON hands the verdict to the bailiff 
    who passes it to Judge Abernathy. Each step takes forever. 

      Abernathy s face reveals nothing.  Diane looks toward the 
      chair between her and Will.  It s empty.  Tim gone.  

                                  JUDGE ABERNATHY
                    I have just reviewed the verdict, 
                    and I find myself making a very 
                    difficult decision.  

                                  WILL

                                  JUDGE ABERNATHY
                    While I hold the defendant s 
                    behavior abhorrent and callous, 
                    there is no greater bedrock to our 
                    society than that of the of the 
                    First Amendment.  Without it, all 
                    our other rights are at risk.  And 
                    I must admit, I ve found the 
                      plaintiff s case to play on the 
                    jury s passions in this matter and 
                    not their rationality.  

      Alicia and Kalinda react. Shit, this is going south fast.

                                  JUDGE ABERNATHY (CONT D)
                    Mr. Roscoreceives thousands of e-
                    mails a day, so it s not 
                      axiomatically true that he would 
                    have seen this e-mail from Ms. 
                    Reagan invalidating her story.  And, 
                    without that certainty, I cannot 
                    allow a jury under my purview to 
                    subvert the First Amendment.  I am, 
                    therefore, directing a verdict in 
                    favor of the defense.  

    As the Judge gavels, a stunned murmur rises from the gallery. 
      Will and Diane are agog. From the jaws of victory... 

                                  WILL
                    Tell Tim we ll appeal.

                                  DIANE
                    My guess is he s not gonna want to.

      Will stares at her, nods.  He starts up the aisle when he 
      sees Emily.

                                  EMILY
                    Maybe next time.

                                  WILL
                    I d like that.

                                  EMILY

    As they watch... a news report.  Tim and his now 3-year-old 
      daughter, Jamie, hugging at a police station.

                    Neighbors credit publicity from the 
                    recent trial as the reason for 
                    calling the police.  Jamie Willens

                    This stuff s awful.  Too sweet.

    The kettle corn. 

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes, and yet I can t stop eating 
                    it.  Do you have the remote?

      Kalinda uses her foot to shove the remote across the table to 
      Alicia.

                    Roscoe struck another blow for our 
                    precious freedoms.

      Yuck.  Alicia drops the kettle corn in the trash.

      Kalinda doesn t react, staring at the screen.  Alicia only 
      slightly glances over toward her.  Almost imperceptibly.
