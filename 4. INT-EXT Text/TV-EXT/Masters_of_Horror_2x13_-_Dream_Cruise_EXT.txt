A child's cap drops with a SPLASH over the side of the boat. 

 


The baseball cap floats on the high seas. 

The hand of a young boy - SEAN, age 8 - extends to grab the hat. 

His elder brother - JACK (JOHN PATRICK MILLER), age 10 -watches and warns: 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Don't lean over... 

 

                                        SEAN 

                          I'm okay. 

. 

Sean leans forward without thinking, really wanting that hat. 

 

                                        JACK 



                                          3   


                          Sean! Sean! Stop it. Sean!  

The boat tips sideways. M2 

                                                                                              ) 
Jack overcompensates and the boat capsizes. (393

The boys are thrown into the water. 

Sean desperately seeks help from his big brother. 

Jack reaches out for his little brother. 


                                        JACK 

                          Calm down, Sean. Grab my arm! Sean! 


Jack lends assistance grabbing Sean by the arm. 

But Sean's in a panic. He clings to Jack, his sudden terror making him thrash wildly, forcing him 

under the water. 

Jack barely  manages to  grab  the side of the capsized boat with his free hand, trying to  keep it 

steady and help his little brother. 


                                        SEAN 

                          Jack help me! 


From  the  shock  of  almost  being  drowned,  Jack  loosens  his  grip  for  an  instant  and  Sean's  arm 

slips free. 


                                  JACK (CONT'D) 

                          Sean! 

 

Sean sinks into the murky water. 


(FLASH ) 

Jack, now age 35, wakes up. 






                                          4   


We see Sean s face as he drops down into the depths, eyes and mouth wide in a silent scream, 

which struggles to the surface in a bubble. 


Jack wakes up in real time, springing to attention. 

As he looks around, the ocean stretches out around him for miles.

Jack realizes that he's awakened not in bed but in a rowboat. 

A baseball cap floats on the surface right beside the boat. 

Jacks slowly reaches out his hand to grab the hat. 

Then, something suddenly grabs onto him from behind. 

It's Sean, his face as pale as a ghost s. 

Jack reacts. 



Jack wakes up this time for real. M4

He springs up in bed. (243

He's in a cold sweat. 



                                          6   


He sits on the bed with an expression of anguish. 

His cell phone RINGS. 

He grabs the phone peering at the LCD screen. 

The caller ID screen reads: Yuri. 

He answers the phone. 


                                        JACK 

                                        (groggy)

                                  (looking at the watch) 

                          That s okay. I have to get up anyways.  

                          What are you doing up so early? 


                                      YURI (O.C.) 

                          Has something happened to Eiji?

                          Did something happen at work? 

                          Has he said anything to you? 


                                        JACK 

                          Like what?  What s the matter? 

 



                                          7   


Jack goes out to the balcony.  
Silence on the line.

                          Something's not right. 

 

Worry crosses Jack s face. 


                                        JACK 

                          What did he say? 


                                      YURI (O.C.)

                                        JACK 

                          I had a last-minute meeting I couldn t get out of it. 

                          It was too late to call.

                          I need to see you, soon. 

 

Jack s face darkens with guilt. 


                                        JACK 

                          I  will call you.

                          Yeah. I m sorry, I just woke up.

                          Okay, I will call you. 


He hangs up, his face inscrutable. 



Jack walks along the crowded streets of people on their way to work. 

 




Jack goes out office. 

He finds a taxi. 

                                        JACK 

                                               Hey ! Taxi! 

 

He flags down an approaching taxi. 


                                        JACK 

                          Yumehama Marina, please.

                          Huh? Where? 

 

So much for the company paid Japanese lessons. 

Jack writes down on a memo and shoves it at the driver. 

 

                                  CABBIE (CONT'D) 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          Oh, Yumehama Marina. 

                          Why didn't you show me this in the first place? 

 

                                        JACK 

                          So hurry please. 

The taxi speeds off. 




REEL.2 


Jack's taxi arrives. 



Jack gets of the taxi. 

He walks between the yachts, looking for the Terrace Caf . 

 


Eiji's cruiser is docked outside. The three walk up, Jack s face a mask of trepidation. 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          Well isn't she beautiful? This 48-foot princess has twin 550 

                          horsepower engines. Unlike other boats with many owners, 

                          she's true to me. 

                                (grabbing Yuri by the arm) 

                          She's just like my wife. My treasure and mine only. 

 

The name on the bow of the boat reads: Yuri.  Yuri puts on an insincere smile. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          She s a beauty, all right. 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          And she rides like a dream. C mon. Let's have fun. 

 




                                          20   


Eiji boards the cruiser and heads up to the flying bridge deck, leaving Jack to stand still on the 

pier a moment. 

Jack had been frighteningly and seem looks about the surface of the water.  M8 

                                                                                                ) 
Nothing is reflected in water.  (563

His eyes lock on Yuri who is boarding the cruiser. Their eyes meet. M8 

She enters the cabin area. 

Jack boards the cruiser. 

Then, the VOICE of a young boy is heard faintly carried by the wind. 

 

                                      THE VOICE 

                          Jack... Jack... 

 

As Jack hangs his head down peering at the water, Sean's body floats along, staring balefully up 

at him from below the water. 

Jack freezes. 


                                          EIJI 

                          Jack, what're you doing? We gonna  miss the sunset. 

 

As always, Jack closes his eyes, breathes deeply and then slow opens his eyes. 

Sean's phantom has disappeared. 


                                        JACK 

                          I m Sorry. 

 

Jacks boards the boat. 



Eiji sits in the driver's seat.

He pushes the axle level forward. 

Yuri is on the deck, pulling the fender. 



Eiji's cruiser leaves the marina. 

Eiji sits on the flying bridge. 



Eiji slowly pushes the axle level forward. 




                                          23   



MOVES FORWARD. 





The bow crests through the water. 

The stern creates a wake behind the boat. 



 


Moving away from the main ship routes, Eiji's cruiser pokes along at a very slow speed. 

 


Sean drowning. 


 

                                        JACK 

                          Sean! 


Sean's arm slips from Jack's grasp. 

Sean sinks into the sea. 

Some time later. 

                                                                                CUT TO: 


The boat comes to a stop.  Eiji drops the anchor from the front deck. 

The anchor chain unravels, plunging into the depths. 

 


DISTANCE 



Eiji tools along in his cruiser. 



While HUMMING in good spirits, Eiji pilots the boat. 

 


Eiji takes out a diver's knife from the console glove compartment. 

He takes the knife out of the sheath and studies the blade. 

 


Yuri comes up. Eiji is at the controls. 

 

                                        YURI 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          Where are you heading? Aren't we supposed to be going back? 



                                          35   


 

                                          EIJI 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          We'll head back after we've had a little more fun. 

                          The real fun is yet to come. 

Yuri doesn t know how to answer. 

Eiji HUMS a song. 

Suddenly, a BAFFLING SOUND is heard. 



 


 

                                        YURI 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          What? What s wrong? 

 

                                          EIJI 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          Don't worry.  

 

Eiji goes to restart the engine by pushing the starter. 

No matter how many times he tries, NOTHING. The sound of the STARTER is heard grinding 

away, but the engine doesn't turn over. 


                                          EIJI 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                                        Damn it. 

 

Eiji smacks his lips and goes down the flying bridge steps. 

 



                                          36   



Jack timidly makes an entrance.  

Yuri comes out from the cabin. 

Eiji throws the rope at Jack. 


                                        JACK 

                          What do you want me to do with this? 


                                          EIJI 

                          Only one thing to do. It's a lifeline. 

                          Dive down and take a look at the prop. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          I can't do that. 


                                          EIJI 

                          Captain's orders. Disobey them and I'll hang you 



                                          38   


                          with that rope. 

 

Is he joking?  But there s little humor in it. 

 


                                        JACK 

                          I already told you. I don't like water, okay? 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          Don't tell me you can't swim? You're from Long Island, right? 

                          Don't go soft on me, Jack my boy. Show a little backbone. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Eiji, Jack's our guest. Leave him alone, okay? 

 




                                          EIJI 

                              (whispering into Jack's ear) 
                                                                                            M15 
                          Found a nice ally, huh Jack. How did you seduce my wife? 
                                                                                            (173) 
 

Eiji heads for the cabin 

Nothing from Jack, too shocked to reply. 

Jack sees Yuri. 



Night shot of the cruiser bobbing up and down on the sea.  

 


He ties a lifeline rope around his waist. He changes into a wet-suit.   

He also has a diver s knife attached to his leg. 



                                          39   


 

                                          EIJI 

                          If anything happens, I'll tug on the rope. 

                          Then pull me up. Okay? 

 

Jack is holding the rope with Yuri standing next to him. 

 


                                        JACK 

                          It s no problem. 

 

Eiji puts on his goggles, and with a flashlight in one hand, dives into the water. 

Eiji's body soon disappears into the darkness of the water as he swims downwards. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          I wonder if we'll make it home in one piece. 

 

                                        JACK 

                              (almost convincing himself) 

                          We re gonna be okay? 

 

                                        YURI 

                          I hope so. 

 M16 

                                                                                              093) 

Eiji, flashlight in hand, is under the boat. 

He inspects the twin propellers of the boat in the illumination of the flashlight. There is some sort 

of black matter wrapped around the propellers. 

Eiji takes his divers knife and begins to cut free the black matter from one of the propellers. 

The black matter appears to be not seaweed, but rather long strands of black human hair. 




                                          40   


Eiji  looks  rather  shocked.  Seemingly  repulsed  by  the  material  he  is  cutting  away  from  the 

propeller, he hurriedly throws it away from him. 

 


Eiji appears on the surface of the water near the rear deck to take a breath. 

 

                                        YURI M16 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          Was it seaweed? 

 

Eiji looks at his hand which has been touching the seaweed-like stuff. 

 

                                    YURI (CONT'D) 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                                  Well, what was it? 

 

Eiji dives again without answering. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          What the hell is he doing? 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Who knows. 

 


There is no one on the deck. 

Suddenly the switch flicks over and the lamp on the starter motor is engaged. M17 

                                                                                                ) 
The throttle lever trembles.  (353



Eiji cuts away the hair-like substance and throws it away. 



                                          41   


 


The throttle lever trembles.  



Eiji pulls out the hair-like substance and throws it away. 

 


The throttle lever trembles.  



Having finished clearing the black hair-like matter from one propeller, Eiji moves on to the next 

one. As Eiji cuts away the black hair-like matter from one propeller, suddenly the hair extends 
                                                                                              M18 
outwards and Eiji's arm becomes entangled in it. 
                                                                                              (503) 

Eiji is shocked, and in his surprise drops the knife. 

Eiji's arm, caught in the hair, is being drawn in towards the propeller. 

Through the goggles we see Eiji's look of horror. 



The throttle swings to backward. 



Before Jack and Yuri's eyes, the sea behind the boat suddenly churns into a mass of foam. 

Jack and Yuri both look in shock. 

The rope in Jack's hands is being pulled strongly into the sea. 

He is about to get pulled in too. 


                                        JACK 

                          Pull the rope, pull the rope! 


                                        YURI 



                                          42   


                          What's happening? 


                                        JACK 

                          Just grab the line... quickly. Common!  

 

Yuri stops moving. 

                                           M18 

                                  JACK (CONT'D) 

                          Yuri! Grab the line! 

 

Yuri doesn't move. 

                                        YURI 

                                                No, Jack. 

 

                                  JACK (CONT'D) 

                          What are you talking-- 

 

Yuri begins to back away. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          No, Jack. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Are you crazy? If we don't do anything Eiji is... 

 

                                        YURI 

                          No! 

 

The tension in the rope Jack is holding goes flat. 

Jack falls on his behind.  

                                        JACK 



                                          43   


                          Oh, god. Eiji ..Eiji! 

Jack hurriedly pulls up the rope. Yuri watches vacantly. 

The end of the rope which Jack pulls up is cleanly cut. 

 

                                  JACK (CONT'D) 

                          Eiji! 

 

Jack looks into the sea, but there is no sign of Eiji. 

Jack turns and looks at Yuri grimly. Yuri picks up the rope. 

Jack walks away from her and rushes to the cabin. 



Yuri chases after Jack onto the rear deck. She grabs hold of him. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Jack! Jack, he's dead! 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Look, he might not be, alright!! 

                          Maybe he's just out there injured somewhere, we can t see him. 

  

                                        YURI 

                          Look! Everything would be much simpler if he was dead. 

 

                                        JACK 

                                      (shocked) 

                          How can you say that? 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Let him be dead, Jack. 

 

They look at one another, taking in the import of what Yuri wants to do. 

Suddenly,  Eiji  comes  climbing  up  a  ladder  onto  the deck  across  from  them,  as  if  nothing  had 

happened. 

Jack and Yuri are in shock. 

 

                                    YURI (CONT'D) 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          Eiji! You okay? 

 

                                          EIJI 



                                          45   


                                    (in Japanese) 

                          Yeah& 

 

Eiji gets himself up onto the deck and then sits down. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Are you hurt? 

 

Eiji has a bit of a look at himself. 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          No. No injuries. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          But...the propeller&we watched the propeller& 

 

                                          EIJI 

                          The propeller? It was seaweed after all. 

Eiji looks vacant.  

 

                                    EIJI (CONT'D) 
                                                                                              M19

                          I'm going to change. 

Eiji stands up rather sluggishly. 

Eiji heads towards the cabin. 

                                        JACK 

                                      (to Yuri) 

                          What did he just say? 

 

                                        YURI 

                          He's going to change. 



                                          46   


 


CRUISER. 



Eiji and Yuri are both on the flying deck. 

Eiji engages the starter button of the engine. The sound of the engine ROARS to life. 

Eiji engages the throttle. 

Yuri looks at the water behind the cruiser. But there is no sign of anything happening there. 

 

                                        YURI 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          The props aren't working. 

 

Eiji throws the throttle lever to the max. The sound of the engine ROARS AT FULL POWER. 

 

                                    YURI (CONT'D) 

                                    (in Japanese) 

                          You'll damage the engine. 

 

Eiji doesn't answer. He just holds the throttle down at full. 

 


REEL.4 


OUT ON THE WAVES. 



Jack looks around him. He seems to see something off the bow in the water. 

A cap floats on the surface of the water. 

Jack closes his eyes, takes some deep breaths and then looks at the water again. 

The cap is still there. 


                                        YURI 

                                                Are you okay? 

 

                                        JACK 

                          How'd... 

 
                                                                                        M21

                          What? Is something wrong with the cap? 



                                          50   


 

                                        JACK 

                                      (shocked) 

                          What!? Can you see&Can you see that too? 

 


                                        YURI 
                                                                                          M27 
                                                What? Yes. Jack ? 

  

Yuri looks a bit confused by Jack's behavior. 



Jack fearfully creeps out onto the deck. M24 

                                                                                            (323) 


                                          55   


Jack can see the back of Eiji on the flying deck doing something. 

Jack goes back to the cabin. 



Eiji, with the anchor in one hand, unties with the other the life-ring hanging from the deck. 

Eiji throws the life-ring into the water. 

Eiji moves onto the other life-ring and starts working on eighty-sixing it too. 

Eiji stops his work as he notices noises. 

Eiji turns around. 
                                                                                            M25 

Jack appears, wrench in hand. (22
                                                                                              583) 

                                        JACK 

                          What did you do with Yuri? 

                          What did you do! 

 

Eiji makes no reply. He begins to lift the anchor. 

Jack stands ready with his wrench. 

Eiji approaches Jack, slowly. Jack backs away. 



The broken Eiji stumbles back from the cabin. He lets out a blood-curdling CRY  

and then- - plunges straight down into the sea. 


Eiji's arm flies out over the deck and drops into the sea. 

 


Eiji uses wire to fix an anchor to the body of Naomi, which he has wrapped in a white plastic 

sheet. 

Eiji throws Naomi's body into the ocean. 

The package bubbles for a while, and then sinks into the sea. 

Eiji gazes the surface of the water.  



Bubbles rise up from under the sheet as Naomi's body sinks. 

 


The sheet as Naomi's body sinks. 






REEL.6 


Jack and Yuri emerge on the flying deck. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Oh my god! 

 

The cruiser's life boat, radio and have all been smashed beyond use. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          There s got to be another way. 



                                          73   


 

Yuri stares blankly at the destruction. 

Then they hear that same THUMPING sound they heard previously 

. 

                                  JACK (CONT'D) 

                          Oh, shit! 

 

Yuri covers her ears with her hands. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          No, no! Stop it! 

 

Jack looks into the sea. 

From under the sea behind the rear deck of the cruiser a pallid light glows. An object begins to M28 

                                                                                              343) 
slowly rise out of the area of sea from where the light is coming. (12

 

                                        JACK 

                          What the fuck...? 

 

                                        YURI 

                          It s her! 

 

                                        JACK 

                                                C mon! 

 

Jack and Yuri urgently back away from the rear of the boat. 

 



Yuri and Jack emerge onto the deck. 

Yuri takes the lone surviving life ring and hands it to Jack. 

Yuri takes Jack's hand and goes to jump into the sea.  

 

                                        YURI 

                                                 Jack, here. 

 

But Jack hesitates. 

                                        JACK 

                          No... I can't. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          What!? You have to--. 


Yuri pulls Jack's hand. 




                                          82   


                                        JACK 

                          I can't. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Jack, listen& Do it for me. 

 M30 

Jack looks at Yuri. 

Jack and Yuri leap into the sea. 



Jack, terrified of the sea, begins to go into a panic and starts swallowing water. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Jack. Grab this. Grab this. It's Okay, it's Okay. You re safe. 

 

Yuri gets Jack to hold onto the life ring. 

Yuri looks back at the cruiser. 

Naomi is standing on the back deck. 
                                                                                            M31 

 
                                                                                            (12103) 

                                    YURI (CONT'D) 

                          C mon. We've got to get away. 

 

Yuri and Jack start kicking as they hold the ring. 



Yuri and Jack, clinging onto the life ring, are both kicking their way to freedom. 

Yuri looks back towards the cruiser. 

Naomi is standing on the surface of the sea behind the cruiser. 

 


                                        YURI 



                                          83   


                          Quick! Quick! 

 

Shot of Yuri swimming. 

Shot of Yuri s hand crawling. 

Shot of Jack swimming. 

Shot of Jack's legs kicking in the water. M31 

Blood seeps horribly from his wounded leg in the water. 

Naomi,  bathed  in  the  glowing  green  light,  begins  to  slowly  walk  on  the  surface  of  the  water 

towards them. 

Shot of Jack and Yuri swimming. 

Shot of Naomi walk on the surface of the water. 

Yuri casts a look back over her shoulder and sees Naomi. 

 

                                    YURI (CONT'D) 

                          Faster, Jack! Faster! 

 

Naomi is gaining on Yuri and Jack. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          It's no good. My leg... I can't make any further. 

                          I can t& Yuri, I can t. 

 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Don't give up. C mon! 


                                        JACK 

                          But-- 

 

                                        YURI 

                          We can do it. C mon, keep going! 



                                          84   


 

Yuri casts a look back behind her and is shocked. 

 

                                    YURI (CONT'D) 

                          Oh! Wait. Wait.  

 

Yuri and Jack stop swimming. 

Naomi has disappeared. 

 

                                    YURI (CONT'D) 

                          She's gone. 

 

The sea around them looks as black as tar. 

They nervously look all round them. 





View from underneath of Jack and Yuri's legs treading water. 

Something is moving in on them from below. 



Shot of Jack checking the sea around them. 

Shot of Yuri doing the same. 

Far away shot of the two of them bobbing up and down in the dark open sea. 

 

                                        YURI 

                          We made it! 

                                        JACK 

                          Are you sure? 

 

                                        YURI 



                                          85   


                                (as if to convince herself) 

                          Yes. 



Something is moving in on them from below. 




                                        YURI 

                                               We made it!  

 

Jack looks unconvinced. 

 

                                    YURI (CONT'D) 

                                        (smiling) 

                          She wasn't able to follow us this far from the boat. 

                          Oh my God. 

 

Yuri embraces Jack. She kisses him. 

Yuri s face is washed with relief, and an almost hysterical smile. Jack also finally allows himself 

a smile. They both embrace. 

But Jack's face, looking over Yuri's shoulder, suddenly changes expression. 

Behind Yuri is Naomi. 

Naomi stands on the surface of the sea. 

Jack screams. 

Yuri swings around to face Naomi. 
                                                                                        M32 

Naomi wraps herself around Yuri and pulls her down into the sea. (22
                                                                                          133) 

Yuri is pulled into the water. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Yuri! 



                                          86   


 

Jack desperately holds on to Yuri's hand. 

Underwater, Naomi is wrapped around Yuri. 

Jack continues to hold on. 

 

                                  JACK (CONT'D) M32 

                          Yuri! 

 

Yuri's face, underwater, is in agony. 

Jack holds on desperately... Just like 25 years ago... 

 


FLASH  BACK  TO  JACK  HOLDING  ONTO  SEAN'S  HAND  25  YEARS  EARLIER.  JACK 

LETS GO AND SEAN DROWNS. 





It looks like Yuri's hand is going to come free from Jack's hand. 

But Jack continues to hold on; he won t let go this time. 

Yuri is in pain under the surface, as Naomi continues to hold tight. 

Suddenly, SEAN'S GHOST comes floating up from the depths of the ocean. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Sean! 

 

Sean advances on Yuri and Naomi. 

 

                                  JACK (CONT'D) 

                          No! 

 

Sean grabs hold of Naomi s  arm. 



                                          87   


Naomi let go her hold of Yuri s body. 

Jack pulls on Yuri's arm in a tug of war.  

Before log, Yuri's head pops victoriously back up above the surface of the water. 

Jack embraces Yuri. 

 

                                  JACK (CONT'D) M32 

                          Yuri, are you okay? It s okay. 

                          You still with me? You still with me? 

 

Yuri is out of breath, panting and exhausted, but she is able to nod. 

Jack looks down into the water. 

SEAN'S GHOST is restraining Naomi. 

Yuri also looks down into the water. 

SEAN,  continuing to hold onto Naomi, disappears as he descends down  into the depths of the 

sea, pulling Naomi from behind.. 

Jack and Yuri continue to stare downwards. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Sean... 

 

                                        YURI 

                          He was&He was protecting you. 

 

Jack and Yuri continue to look down towards where Sean disappeared. 

Then Sean's cap appears floating next to Jack. 


                                        JACK 

                                      Hold this. 

 

Jack gives the life ring to Yuri. 

Jack picks up the cap, and holds it tight.  



                                          88   


 


                                    YURI (CONT'D) 

                          Look 

                          . 

Jack turns to Yuri. 

Yuri points towards the horizon, where the first light of dawn is beginning to appear. M33 
                                                                                              ) 
        (413

                                                                      FADE TO BLACK 


A yacht cruises beneath a blue sky. 

Yuri takes the steer, and Jack stands right next to her. 

 


Jack holds the photo in hand. 

Jack and Sean in their childhood appear in the photograph. 

Yuri casts the anchor, and comes toward Jack. 

Yuri sits beside Jack. 

                                        YURI 

                          So, Jack& 

 

                                        JACK 

        Yeah& 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Are you still afraid of the ocean? 

 

                                        JACK 

                          Not so much any more. 

                          I might even be starting to see its beauty.  

 



                                          89   


He  takes  her  hand  and  brings  it  to  his  mouth  for  a light  kiss,  and  she  lays  her  head  on  his 

shoulder. 

 

                                  JACK (CONT'D) 

                          So what did the doctor say? 

 

                                        YURI 

                          Well. It s three months and counting. 

 

Yuri lovingly places his hand on her belly, and strokes her tummy with it. 

 

                                        JACK 

                          You know, if it s a boy, at least we know what to call him. 

 

                                        YURI 

                                      (grinning) 

                          Yeah. His name works for me. 

 

                                        JACK 

                                               Hold on second. 

 

Jack gives the wreath to Yuri. 

Jack puts the photo into the wreath. 


                                        JACK 

                                               C mon! 

 

Jack and Yuri stand up the deck. 

Jack kisses the wreath.   

 

                                        JACK 
                                                                                          M34 

                                                                                          (22503) 

 
                                          90   


                          Goodbye Sean. 


Jack throws a wreath he had been holding into the water. 

 

 

                                        JACK M34 

                          We ll see you little soon again, pal. 

 

Jack and Yuri continue to look down on the sea. 

The photo of Jack and Sean in their childhood gently floats on the rise and fall of the sea swell.
