LEMARCHE CASTLE, TOMB - NIGHT (1865)
A storm is raging outside. We hear the clap and roll of THUNDER.
TOMB STAIRWAY -
RATS scurry away down the scum-covered steps as the GLOW OF A
LANTERN and FOOTSTEPS herald someone's arrival...
GENVIEVE LEMARCHE
emerges around the bend. Mid-30s. Cultured beauty. Her dress and
face are smeared with grime and... is that blood we see too? God
only knows what's happened to her.
Genvieve ducks under a monstrous cobweb as she passes an open
window.
WINDOW
LIGHTNING streaks across the night sky outside. We catch a glimpse
of the MOON disappearing behind the clouds.
Genvieve reaches the bottom of the stairs. The tomb itself.
Water trickles in through cracks in the lichen-covered walls,
pooling on the tomb floor.
Genvieve moves forward, her lantern throwing distorted shadows
over everything...
In front of her is Anton LeMarche's stone sarcophagus.
Genvieve kneels in the water, one hand resting on the spiked iron
railing which surrounds the tomb. She reaches the other hand
towards a scum-covered plaque, brushing the grime away...
THUNDER and LIGHTNING reach a crescendo as...
A SKELETAL HAND rises out of the water, reaching for her.
Genvieve SCREAMS. The lantern falls from her grasp, sputtering
out. The hand reaches for her arm and inadvertently clutches her
breast instead...
Genvieve starts to laugh hysterically.
DIRECTOR (O.S.)
(exasperated)
Cut! Thank you, Renee. Can we
throw some light on the set?
GENVIEVE
I'm sorry...
Suddenly it is lighter. Genvieve can't stop laughing. The groping
monster hand disappears back beneath the water.
WE PULL BACK, REVEALING -
It's not 1865. The LeMarche Castle tomb is in fact, a 90s movie
set. We are inside a soundstage, on a raised set, so the slugline
should really read...
SOUNDSTAGE, LEMARCHE CASTLE TOMB SET -
A FILM CREW scurries about. Everyone is LAUGHING now. The DIRECTOR
sits to the right. He and the DP are already huddled over the
video-assist monitor. We see the previous scene rewinding at high-
speed.
The FIRST A.D. moves in.
FIRST A.D.
Water in the pool's running low,
fill her up!
Crewmembers move towards the set.
An SFX PUPPETEER (i.e., the skeletal arm) crawls out from under,
followed by an ELECTRICIAN.
PUPPETEER
I can't see shit down there! I'm
working blind!
GENVIEVE/THE ACTRESS
rises out of the water. Her name is actually RENEE HALLOW and her
beauty is undeniable, even in such a disheveled state.
RENEE
This is great, I could've spent
four months on a romantic comedy
with Warren Beatty, and instead,
I've got a horny zombie trying to
cop a feel!
The crew members LAUGH. She's well-liked on the set. Renee grins.
Wardrobe and make-up personnel move in to adjust Renee's
appearance.
RENEE
Uhgh, there's water everywhere...
(beat)
Can I get a cigarette?
The MAKE-UP GIRL pulls a pack of cigarettes from her fanny-pack
and offers Renee one. In a flash, a P.A. appears with a lighter.
Renee mumbles "thanks" as she fires up. She squints her eyes,
trying to see past the set lights.
RENEE
(calling out)
Geoff?
(beat)
Anybody see my boy?
GEOFF (O.S.)
Right here, Mom...
GEOFF MATTHEWS, Renee's 12 year-old son steps into view. Renee's
face lights up when she sees him.
RENEE
How long have you been here?
GEOFF
Couple minutes. I saw the last
shot. That was pretty cool.
Renee grimaces as the make-up girl spritzes her face with a spray-
bottle.
RENEE
(casually)
How did it go with your father
last night?
GEOFF
Good. He said he'd be over for
dinner at eight...
(awkward)
I mean... he misses you, Mom...
RENEE
I miss him too...
RENEE
(continuing)
I just don't want you to get your
hopes up, okay? We're trying to
work things out, but...
Her voice trails off.
GEOFF
I know, Mom.
RENEE
(affectionate)
You know everything, don't you?
Renee and Geoff are interrupted by a CREWMEMBER who's spraying
"atmosphere" about the set with a hand-held smoke machine. Renee
coughs.
Off-set, the FIRST A.D. is trying to get the show on the road.
FIRST A.D.
Okay, people! Quiet! We're going
to try this another time!
GEOFF
Guess it's showtime.
RENEE
Yep.
Renee kisses Geoff on the forehead. He takes the cigarette from
her and moves off the set, standing near the camera.
The director turns back toward Renee.
DIRECTOR
Alright, Renee. Last time. I
promise. We nail this and you
won't have to do this ever again.
RENEE
That's what you said the first
time...
Renee turns and heads back toward the stairs. A P.A. hands her a
new lantern. As she reaches the stairs, the house lights dim,
creating the proper atmosphere once again.
UNDER THE SET -
The puppeteer gets ready. It's cramped. The electrician checks a
power box connection.
The director nods to the camera operator.
OPERATOR
Rolling. Speed...
SLATE BOY
"Castle of Terror." Scene 69A.
Take thirteen.
The slate comes down.
DIRECTOR
Action!
The scene replays itself as before, only now we're watching the
action from multiple viewpoints.
We start on the video assist monitor, then move up to...
GEOFF
He grins as he watches the scene unfold.
ON THE SET
Renee has reached the sarcophagus. LIGHTNING flashes. The skeleton
hand bursts up, grabbing Renee's arm. The scene continues past the
original point of interruption.
UNDER THE SET -
We see an undetected LEAK. Water drips down. The puppeteer shifts
position, struggling, and...
...knocks over the power box which SPARKS just as...
ABOVE -
Renee/Genvieve grabs the iron railing with both hands.
Electricity surges through Renee. Her body jerks and writhes like
some nightmarish marionette.
UNDER THE SET -
The electrician drags the puppeteer back. Sparks fly.
ELECTRICIAN
Jesus! We've crossed over into
220! Shut down the generator!
ABOVE -
Crewmembers SCREAM and scramble back...
All the circuits are blowing, lights EXPLODING and showering
sparks over the whole set. This is not part of the movie.
RENEE
It's awful. She shakes, her SMOKING HANDS frozen to the iron
railing by the electricity running through her...
Suddenly, Renee falls forward against the iron. Her face begins to
SMOKE AND SINGE...
The lights CONTINUE TO BLOW, casting a strobic effect over the
soundstage, adding to the chaos.
ON GEOFF
As he witnesses the whole event. He tries to rush forward, but
someone restrains him...
GEOFF
Mom!!!!
Suddenly all the circuits in the stage are blown and the LIGHTS GO
OUT. Renee slumps back into the water, smoke trailing up from her
still form. And we...

OPERATING ROOM - DAY
An aged GOLDEN RETRIEVER is on the surgical table. CHASE MATTHEWS,
D.V.M., gently strokes the dog's fur. He's good with the dog. He's
kind. The retriever's owners: a MOTHER and her SON, look on.
CHASE
I think this is probably for the
best. He's a very old dog. He
has arthritis. He has cataracts
in his eyes...
Chase looks at the mother. He's always hated this part.
CHASE
He's had a good life...
(to dog)
...haven't you, boy?
INTERCOM
Doctor Matthews, your son is on
line one. He says it's an
emergency...
Chase breaks concentration, pulling his eyes away from the mother
and son.
SOUNDSTAGE, LEMARCHE CASTLE TOMB SET -
A blur of activity converges on the movie set. A TRIO OF
PARAMEDICS. A FIRE OFFICIAL. A POLICE OFFICER. Medical equipment.
Horrified crewmembers watch on, helpless.
WE STAY ON Geoff, momentarily blocked out and then revealed again
and again, amidst the commotion of paramedics scrambling to save
Renee. The director has his hand on Geoff's shoulder.
Geoff's eyes dart about, taking it all in. Things are happening
very fast:
--Renee's hand is lifted. Someone checking her pulse. --Her
eyelids parted. A pen light flashing at her fixed pupils.
PARAMEDIC #1 (O.S.)
Run me down a line of normal
saline.
--An I.V. needle plunges into the inside of Renee's elbow. --A
syringe injects into the I.V. post.
--Hands hook up a life-pack monitor. Renee's dress is torn away.
Electrodes press to bare skin. --The monitor screen blinks to
life.
PARAMEDIC (O.S.)
We have a bradycardic rhythm at
30.
--Another PARAMEDIC dials out on a cellular phone, to the
consulting physician.
PARAMEDIC #3 (O.S.)
White female. Approximately
thirty five years old.
Electrocution...
--A clear tube is inserted down her throat. --The monitor shows
erratic heartbeat.
PARAMEDIC #2 (O.S.)
She's in V-fib.
--There's a renewed urgency even amidst their rush.
--Defibrillator paddles are pressed to her chest.
Geoff looks to the monitor as...
--It goes to flatline.
PARAMEDIC (O.S.)
Clear.
GEOFF
No...
Geoff moves forward, pulling away from the director. The police
officer moves in and intercepts Geoff, turning the boy away.
Geoff's eyes fix on the monitor. An unbending flatline...
GEOFF
You have to bring her back...
Chase rushes onto the set, pushing past crewmembers. He freezes at
the sight of the horrific commotion around Renee's still form.
CHASE
Oh Jesus...
Chase's gaze connects with his son.
GEOFF
(helpless)
Dad...
We pull back from Geoff, Chase, and the commotion around Renee.
Farther and farther as the darkness around the set begins to close
in...
PARAMEDIC #1 (O.S.)
(urgent)
We're losing her...
Darkness everywhere and we

DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY
Moving boxes clutter the downstairs.
Chase is weaving through the maze, doing an inventory on the
boxes.
A sweaty PAIR OF MOVERS are climbing up the stairs. Each is
hunched
over, with a garment box balanced on his back. The side
of each carton is boldly labeled: RENEE - ATTIC.
MOVER (O.S.)
We've got six more of these. You
sure you want them all in the
attic?
Chase is contemplating a compromise when Geoff appears from the
kitchen doorway.
CHASE
...Geoff, what if we just give
the clothes to Goodwill? We'll
keep the rest. Just the clothes.
Geoff shakes his head, firm and deliberate denial.
GEOFF
You're the one who wanted to move.
Nobody would've touched them if
you didn't want to move here...
Chase weakens, giving in.
CHASE
All the 'Renee' boxes go in the
attic. Sorry.
Marjorie KNOCKS on the open frame of the front door.
Geoff recognizes her from his mother's funeral. She flashes him a
warm smile.
MARJORIE
Hi. I'm Marjorie Hargrove. Your
new housekeeper.
Marjorie has a naive, friendly quality about her. She's also
blessed with eye-popping genetics. Standing there outside the
door, looking more than a little nervous... we can't help but like
her. Needless to say, she doesn't look like your typical
housekeeper.
MARJORIE
(re: Chase's reaction)
Is something wrong?
CHASE
Uh... no. You just... look
different than you sounded on the
phone. Please, come in.
Marjorie enters. She grins at Geoff again. Yep. She's nervous
alright.
MARJORIE
I'm real excited about working
for you Mr. Matthews...
CHASE
Well we're glad to have you,
Marjorie. You can call me Chase,
by the way.
Marjorie passes her curious eyes over one of Renee's garment
containers.
MARJORIE
I've always admired Ms. Hallow.
That scene she did in Blue
Midnight, where her lover meets
her at the train station...
(she sighs)
I must've watched that movie four
times.
Chase smiles. Marjorie's enthusiasm is endearing.
Just then, one of the movers loses his grip. A garment box bounces
down the slope of the stairs. When it reaches the bottom, dresses
spill over the floor.
MARJORIE
Oh. I'll get that...
Marjorie moves for the spill. The first dress she touches is a
beaded peach evening gown. Her fingers linger on the fabric.
MARJORIE
This is gorgeous. She wore this
at the Emmys, didn't she?
Geoff moves forward, acting overly defensive.
GEOFF
Hey, don't touch her stuff. It
made her crazy when people touched
her stuff.
Marjorie is taken aback by the oddity of Geoff's statement.
Chase catches her eye, shrugging apologetically.

EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY
Geoff and Chase move inside. The offices look like they were built
in the 40s. A dark corridor stretches down the center of the
suite. Faded green walls are solid, with few exteriors. It's
creepy in here.
Heavy, grey plastic curtains absorb much of the light which does
find its way in. Nothing looks like it's been updated in the past
fifty years.
CHASE
This doesn't look so bad...
Chase sweeps a curtain aside, revealing the interior to Geoff.
Dust swirls in the air.
GEOFF
How long ago did this guy retire?
CHASE
It's been a few years.
Geoff takes a look around, growing uncomfortable.
GEOFF
(skeptical)
A few?
Geoff moves on down the central corridor which seems to grow
darker and more dismal with every step. He moves on into the
boarding room...
BOARDING AREA - DAY
Rows of kennels are stacked along the walls, smothered with
cobwebs. Ancient, rusted surgical equipment is scattered
everywhere. The place is a mess. Windows are boarded up and
shadows cloak the room.
Over to the right, Geoff hears a RUSTLING.
A CARDBOARD BOX on one of the shelves jiggles. Something is moving
around inside it.
Geoff's eyes widen. Still, morbid curiosity propels him forward.
The box rustles again. He reaches for it and...
A CREATURE LEAPS out at him, HOWLING. Geoff SCREAMS and jumps
back. The box tumbles over and...
A CAT crawls out. Behind the protective mother, are four of the
cutest kittens we've ever seen, MEWING away.
Geoff sighs just as Chase rushes into the room.
CHASE
What's wrong?!
GEOFF
(embarrassed)
Nothing. I just got spooked by a
bunch of furballs.
Inside the box is a note. Chase reaches for it. It reads: "And a
warm welcome to you."
CHASE
Great, now I've opened an
orphanage too.
One of the kittens pads out of the box and looks up at Geoff with
sleepy eyes. Her fur is striped.
GEOFF
Well, I'll take one. If it's
okay...
Geoff lifts the fragile creature, cradling it in his arms.
GEOFF
She looks like a tiger.
Chase spies an old broom resting in the corner.
CHASE
Tell you what, you do some
sweeping up here, and she's yours.
Geoff nods and Chase moves back out into the hallway.
Geoff sets the box back upright and lowers Tiger in with the other
kittens. He reaches for the broom and goes to work sweeping away
the cobwebs.
Just as soon as he turns his back, Tiger climbs the side of the
box, spilling over onto the floor.
EXAMINATION ROOM
Chase is unpacking a shipment of medical supplies. When he places
them in the cabinet, he stirs up a layer of dust.
Tiger scampers by as Chase coughs his way out of the cloud of
dust.
WAITING AREA
Tiger sees the front door ajar. And as she approaches to explore
what lies beyond--
The door swings open...
ZOWIE, A SIBERIAN HUSKY is staring back at her. He's black and
white with blue eyes, with a mask that is at once menacing and
majestic.
A pudgy thirteen year old boy, DREW, has a hold of the dog's
collar.
Zowie's BARK sends Tiger scrambling.
Drew loses his grip as Zowie yanks free. A strong, paternal
command calls after Drew from outside.
VOICE (O.S.)
Drew, you get a handle on that
dog, now!
EXAMINATION ROOM
Chase spins around at the commotion as Tiger darts across the
floor with the barking dog in pursuit.
Mayhem ensues as Zowie's big paws slip on the slick tile.
Geoff rushes in from the boarding area.
Tiger ducks beneath the back of a surgical gurney.
Zowie's snoot wedges beneath the base, inches from Tiger's tiny,
striking paw.
Drew slides in on his knees, renewing his hold on Zowie's collar.
He pulls the dog back.
Geoff rescues Tiger from beneath the gurney.
Drew shrugs sheepishly.
DREW
Sorry. He gets kinda hyper...
Drew's stepfather, Gus Gilbert, enters. The dreaded, domineering
voice of authority in Drew's life. WE know him as the sheriff at
Renee's funeral.
GUS
Hell, he thought it was lunch.
How ya doin', Chase?
(a handshake)
You haven't met my boy.
(aside)
Drew, where the hell are your
manners.
Drew steps forward and awkwardly offers his hand to Chase. Then
Geoff. The boys shake.
GEOFF
He's a cool lookin' dog.
Zowie lurches forward, eager to shower affection on Geoff. Geoff
strokes the dog's soft mane.
GEOFF
What's his name?
DREW
Zowie.
Drew puts his palm under Zowie's chin and turns him for Chase to
see. There are several scabbed-over gashes on his left cheek.
GUS
Damn dog stuck his nose in on my
rabbits and they ganged up on him.
I swear that dog's an idiot.
DREW
Is he gonna be okay?
With one eye on Zowie, Chase sprays some antiseptic on the
examination table and wipes it clean.
CHASE
Let's have him hop up here.
Drew prods Zowie. Zowie jumps up onto the table. Chase looks over
the facial lacerations, then turns on a penlight and examines the
dog's eyes.
Gus passes a lingering look over Tiger. He reaches in to pet her,
making sure it meets with Geoff's approval.
GUS
When I was young I thought cats
were the girls and dogs were the
boys.
CHASE
There are three more girls where
that one came from looking for
homes.
Drew perks up at the thought, but Gus shoots it down.
GUS
Not our home.
Chase takes the light out of Zowie's eyes. He looks to Gus.
CHASE
Thee facial lacerations should heal
up pretty quickly. I'll give you
som antibiotic cream--
GUS
--Drew, he's your dog. Are you
listening to this?
Chase turns to Drew and continues...
CHASE
His left eye is scratched, corneal
abrasion. Eyedrops will help, but
it's going to take som time. Try
to keep him away from those
rabbits, huh?
Drew nods, casting a glance aside at Gus.
GUS
(to Chase)
I hear you've got Marjorie
Hargrove working for you now.
CHASE
How'd you know that?
Gus gives Chase a knowing grin.
GUS
It's a small town, Chase.
Gus laughs and claps Chase on the shoulder.
GUS
Hey Geoff, did you know your
mother and I used to be high-
school sweethearts?
Geoff is surprised at this. Surprised and annoyed. Tact isn't a
quality that Gus possesses in abundance.
GEOFF
Really?
GUS
(nodding)
Homecoming. Prom. Whole nine
yards.
(to Chase)
Course that was a lifetime ago.
VAN - DAY
Chase digs some cash out of his wallet. Geoff stares out at the
school. He's dreading this.
CHASE
What's a lunch cost these days?
You want ten?
GEOFF
(unenthused)
Sure.
Chase looks at his son.
CHASE
You nervous? New town, new
school. I know it must be pretty
hard for you...
GEOFF
(cutting him off)
I'll be fine, Dad.
Geoff reaches for the door, but Chase stops him. He's trying to
reach his son. He really is.
CHASE
(awkward)
Geoff... you have to help me out
here a little...
"MEOW!" Chase drops his eyes to the bulge squirming around in
Geoff's jacket. He can't help but smile.
CHASE
Are you sure you don't want me to
pick you up. It's a long ride.
Geoff opens the side panel of the van and slips out his MOUNTAIN
BIKE.
GEOFF
That's what my bike's for...
Before Chase can say another word, Geoff is gone.
CLASSROOM - DAY
MRS. GORDON is addressing a room of SEVENTH GRADERS.
Geoff is doodling in his notebook, feeling acutely out of place as
he tries to avoid the curious glances the rest of his new
classmates are giving him.
MRS. GORDON
People, this is Geoff Matthews.
He'll be joining our class for the
rest of the school year...
As Mrs. Gordon points to him, Geoff drops his face even lower.
This is the worst embarrassment a boy could ever suffer. He'd like
to throttle Mrs. Gordon.
A freckle-faced boy, DOUG, fires off a question.
DOUG
Hey, what's Hollywood like? Do
you know Eddie Murphy?
GEOFF
(annoyed)
No.
MRS. GORDON
Why don't we save that for later,
Doug?
A girl with braces, SUSAN, continues the interrogation.
SUSAN
What about Julia Roberts?
MRS. GORDON
Susan! That'll be enough.
Susan shuts up. Geoff sinks even lower in his seat.
The kids turn their eyes back to the front of the room.
But one classmate's eyes are still on Geoff. It's Clyde.
Clyde shifts his stare to the squirming lump in Geoff's jacket. He
catches a glimpse of Tiger's bobbing nose popping out.
HALLWAY - DAY
Geoff joins the stampede of kids as the BELL releases them for the
day. Almost immediately, Clyde and his cronies, STEVIE AND BRAD,
fall in step behind him. Drew hangs slightly off to the side, not
really wanting to be a part of the intimidation.
CLYDE
What's the hurry, Junior? Where
you off to?
Clyde quickens his pace, pulling ahead of Geoff and stopping in
front of him. Stevie and Brad move in on either side. Surrounded
by peers, it's apparent how small Geoff is for his age.
On the wall next to them is a bulletin board display. Clyde
glances at it. Geoff follows his gaze.
DISPLAY
It's one of those corny school affairs with construction paper
letters spelling out: "WE REMEMBER RENEE HALLOW." Beneath that are
pictures of Renee clipped from various magazines. Cloyingly
tasteless.
CLYDE
(feigning remorse)
Too bad about your Mom. Papers
said it was pretty gross, getting
fried like that. Guess you saw
it, huh?
Geoff nods. Clyde raises his eyebrows, pulling Geoff's jacket
open.
CLYDE
So, what are you hiding there?
STEVIE
When you bring a friend to school
you're supposed to introduce him.
Geoff's arm tightens protectively around Tiger.
GEOFF
Her name's Tiger.
CLYDE
Tiger? Don't you think that's
kind of a pussy name?
(reaching out)
Can I hold her? I promise I'll be
real careful.
Clyde has a convincing way about him. Geoff reluctantly hands the
kitten over. Clyde is so gentle with the creature that one would
never question his sincerity.
Geoff is just beginning to feel at ease when something changes in
Clyde's tone, something sinister.
CLYDE
Hey, Geoff. You ever seen a
kitten run?
GEOFF
I've seen her run around the
house.
Clyde's eyes narrow. He takes a couple of steps back. Geoff's
heart starts to sink.
CLYDE
No, I mean really run...
(beat)
Like this!
Clyde backsteps and bolts off down the hallway with Tiger. Brad
and Stevie fall in behind him, laughing.
Drew shrugs apologetically. He's torn, but he tears off after them
nonetheless.
GEOFF
Shit...
Geoff runs off in pursuit of them.
KITCHEN - DUSK
Marjorie is at the stove, fixing up dinner, while Chase scans the
newspaper at the table.
Geoff enters through the kitchen door. He moves past them without
a word.
CHASE
(calling after him)
Hey! How was your first day at
school?
GEOFF
(over his shoulder)
It sucked.
MARJORIE
Now is that any way to talk to
your father?
Geoff stops for a moment, turns...
GEOFF
You're not my mother.
...and exits through the opposite door.
Chase looks to Marjorie and offers a sympathetic shrug.
CHASE
Sorry.
KITCHEN - NIGHT
Drew's mother, AMANDA, withdraws a roast from the oven.
Gus is at the sink, washing his hands. He turns to see Zowie
laying at Drew's feet in the living room. Drew is watching a MUSIC
VIDEO on TV.
GUS
Drew, I don't remember inviting
Zowie in for dinner.
DREW
Just until he heals up?
Gus is waggling his thumb toward the back door.
Drew slumps in defeat.
Gus reaches into the cabinet and pours himself a Bourbon.
DREW'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
Amanda's about to put the roast on the table when Gus nuzzles up
behind her, breathing down her backside. With his drink in hand,
he sweeps her hair aside and zeros in for a kiss on the back of
the neck.
Gus eases his free hand around between Amanda and the counter and
presses his palm firmly into her crotch, drawing her body tight to
him.
She stiffens at his intimate hold, uncomfortable with his timing.
AMANDA
Gus, please...
At the back door, Drew is watching from beyond the screen,
disgusted by the sight of Gus pawing his mother. Drew swings the
door open as loud as he can to signal his return.
Gus plants a last kiss on the back of Amanda's neck and backs off.
But before he goes, he snatches a chunk of meat from the serving
platter. Leveling his leering eyes at Amanda, he stuffs it into
his mouth suggestively.
GUS
God damn, you're good.
Drew rolls his eyes and takes his seat at the table, returning his
attention to the TV, where another MUSIC VIDEO is on.
Gus glances at the TV, annoyed by the MUSIC. He drops into his
spot at the head of the table, blocking Drew's view. Drew leans to
the side for a better look. Gus takes notice and leans to the same
side to obstruct his view.
GUS
You're breaking the law here,
Drew.
AMANDA
Really, Gus. It won't bother me.
Gus ignores her, inching forward with a confidential, harsh
whisper.
GUS
Your mom's spent the last hour
cooking. Stop being a little jerk
and show her some appreciation.
Drew aims the remote control at Gus, as if to shut him up, and
silences the TV.
Amanda approaches with the roast. The moment it's on the table,
Drew starts dishing up a hefty serving. Gus spears Drew's fork
with the serving fork.
GUS
Not that much appreciation. I
thought we were gonna tone down
that flabby ass.
DREW
Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud
that you are.
AMANDA
Knock it off, guys...
Gus throws back a sip of Bourbon.
GUS
(to Drew, quietly)
You watch that mouth of yours,
Drew buddy.

GUS' ROOM - NIGHT
The ELECTRICAL ZING. The dog's whimpering CRY. And the RINGING OF
BELLS reach Gus in rapid succession, rousting him from his sleep.
He rolls out of bed and grabs his robe.
GUS
Damn it, Drew. That dog is
history!
Amanda stirs, groggily focusing on Gus' departing figure.
DREW'S ROOM - NIGHT
Drew swings open the door to the hallway as Gus marches by,
stuffing shells into a shotgun. Panicked, Drew takes off after
him.
AMANDA AND GUS' BEDROOM - NIGHT
Amanda wakens with a start. She rises, eyes focusing on the dark
bedroom. Gus is sound asleep next to her. Then, from outside, we
faintly hear ZOWIE'S SCRATCHING.
Slowly, Amanda rises from bed, pulling on a bathrobe as she heads
for the door.
DREW'S ROOM - NIGHT
Photos of Drew with Zowie are tacked on the wall above the bed.
The one photo of Drew, Amanda and Gus has been altered with a cut-
out head of Zowie's pasted on Gus' shoulders.
WE FIND Drew below. He's fallen asleep with his Walkman on. Even
with his ears covered, the POUNDING at the door jolts him awake.
Half asleep, Drew peels off the headphones.
GUS (O.S.)
Drew, you unlock this door! Right
now!
AMANDA (O.S.)
Unlock it, Drew!
The anger in his mother's voice brings him off the bed. Gus'
POUNDING continues.
Drew moves to the door. The inside is secured by a double dead
bolt. Instead of unlocking them, he opens a tiny, customized
window which gives him a view of the hall.
DREW
What did I do now?
AMANDA
Open the door, Drew.
Drew unlatches the deadbolts and steps back as Gus bursts through
the door.
GUS
Where do you come off lying like
that? "I'm burying my dog." You
think a lie like that's never
gonna catch up to you?
Drew backs into the bed, taking a seat.
Amanda comes through the door, and behind her is...
ZOWIE
This is our first glimpse of the resurrected dog. Fur shiny and
wet, the gaping gunshot wound in his rear. Zowie's head hangs low,
his eyes GLEAMING RED. The husky is covered with dirt from head to
toe.
Drew's eyes widen in astonishment.
Zowie staggers across the room towards Drew, nails clicking on the
floorboards. Drew shrinks back in uncertain horror as the dog
moves closer.
Zowie absently throws his arms up onto the bed, across Drew's lap.
And slowly, perfunctory, his tongue licks Drew's cheek. This last
action of Zowie displaces Drew's fear. Tears well up in the boy's
eyes.
DREW
(a whisper)
Zowie...
GUS
Say your goodbyes. Zowie's going
outside. You're grounded, buddy.
That's the new law.
Drew lifts his hand from stroking Zowie's fur. His palm is covered
with muddy blood.
AMANDA
I never knew an open wound could
smell so bad...
(beat)
Honey, he should have been looked
at this morning. I don't know
what you were thinking. It's a
wonder he's still alive.
Drew gazes into the dog's vacant eyes. It truly is a wonder.
GEOFF'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Chase enters and stops in the doorway.
Geoff sits in front of the television with a pile of videotapes
next to him. He's scanning through Renee's old movies with the
remote. The sound has been turned down and the effect is a little
eerie.
ON THE SCREEN
We see RENEE move through a scene. Geoff hits the slo-mo button
and the image winds down. Renee's face. HER EYES stare out at us
from the alien universe of the past.
CHASE
(gently)
Geoff...
Geoff doesn't respond. He's captivated by Renee.
Chase moves into the room.
CHASE
Geoff!
Geoff PAUSES the tape. Renee freezes, the image flickering ever so
slightly. For an instant, we think we see a FLASH OF Renee being
electrocuted. But it's only an instant.
Finally, Geoff tears his eyes away from the screen, resenting his
father's intrusion.
GEOFF
What?
CHASE
You alright?
Geoff's face softens. He nods.
GEOFF
Dad... do you think...
(beat)
...you think you and Mom would've
gotten back together?
Chase draws closer. He takes a seat next to Geoff. The pain in his
son's eyes is almost more than he can stand.
CHASE
I think so.
CHASE
(continuing)
Your Mom and I loved each other,
Geoff. Don't ever think that we
didn't.
GEOFF
I still can't believe she's
dead...
Chase moves to reach for his son, and suddenly the phone RINGS,
shattering the moment.
Chase hesitates, but finally he rises and answers the phone.
After a moment, he returns.
GEOFF
Who was that?
CHASE
Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He
got hurt again. I'm going over to
take a look at him.
Geoff's eyes widen. He looks like a ghost walked over his grave.
GEOFF
I'm going with you.
Chase nods and exits to get his coat.
Geoff looks back at the TV once more. The image paused.
Renee staring at us from beyond the grave.
CHASE'S VAN - NIGHT
Chase lays Zowie on his side on an examining table and shines an
overhead light onto the wound.
Geoff is looking in from outside, utterly bewildered by the
living, breathing dog.
CHASE
How'd it happen?
Gus casts a threatening glance in Drew's direction.
DREW
(glaring at Gus)
Some psycho hunter probably got
trigger happy...
Chase is too busy preparing a syringe to notice the nonverbal
exchange.
CHASE
I'm going to give Zowie a local
anaesthetic so I can clean up the
wound. I'd like to take him home
tonight for observation.
AMANDA
Fine.
DREW
Can you keep him at your place
until he gets better?
CHASE
Sure...
Drew tenderly strokes Zowie's mane as Chase administers the
injection. Zowie stares up at Geoff with dull, blank eyes.
Drew reads Geoff's bewilderment and joins him outside the van.
Their words are clear, but whispered.
GEOFF
Maybe he wasn't dead when we
buried him.
DREW
He was dead. You know he was.
Geoff returns his stare to Zowie.
DREW
You can't tell anyone, Geoff.
Ever.
Geoff looks into Drew's eyes and nods in understanding.

GEOFF'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Tiger is curled up at the foot of Geoff's bed. Geoff climbs in,
careful not to disturb the kitten. As he lays his head back on the
pillow...
VOICE (O.S.)
Sleep tight, darling. I'll be
with you soon.
It's a woman's VOICE. A familiar one. Now we hear the rhythmic
CREAK of a rocking chair. And with it comes the voice again,
humming a HAUNTING LULLABY.
Wide-eyed, Geoff turns his head toward the source...
A WOMAN'S NONDESCRIPT FORM is seated in the rocking chair across
the room. Rocking forward, her face passes into a swath of
moonlight...
It's Renee. With the rock of the chair, her face recedes back into
the shadows. Her soothing HUM remains.
And again, her face passes into the swath of light. And again it
retreats.
Geoff raises his hand, reaching out for her.
Renee's hand rises from the shadows, reaching for him.
But suddenly, THE ROOM BEGINS TO STRETCH.
The rocking chair and the bed seem distanced like polar extremes,
mother and son hopelessly separated by forces beyond their
control.
LIGHTNING FLASHES in the bedside window. Renee is falling farther
and farther away.
GEOFF
Mom!!!
Geoff leaps from his bed as the darkness closes in and...
GEOFF
bolts up from his pillow. Awake now, face wet with perspiration.
It was a nightmare. Except, if it was a nightmare, why do we still
hear...
...the steady CREAK of the rocking chair.
Geoff slowly turns his head once again, repeating the actions of
his dreams.
In the shadows, the chair is still rocking. As it comes forward
into the moonlight, we see ZOWIE, curled up asleep on the seat of
the chair.
Tiger is not on the bed anymore. She's up on top of the bookcase
now, wide awake, eyes fixed on the dog. She HISSES.
Geoff stares at the rocking chair, petrified.
CHASE'S OFFICE - DAY
Chase strips off the bandage over Zowie's rear end. The wound is
gooey and open.
Geoff reads the concern in Chase's expression. Drew is right there
at Geoff's side, looking on.
DREW
What's the deal?
CHASE
I don't know. He's had three
days. His immune system should've
responded by now...
Chase puts on his stethoscope and checks under the dog's rib-cage
for a pulse. He checks a number of places, then shakes his head,
totally confused.
CHASE
I can't seem to find a pulse... it
must be so weak, it's not
registering...
Geoff and Drew share conspiratorial glances as Chase sets the
stethoscope aside and extracts a blood sample.
Chase labels the capped vial of blood "ZOWIE" and carefully places
it into a packing container. When he closes the lid, we see the
preaddressed label:
UNIVERSITY OF MAINE
School of Veterinary Medicine
Lab Samples Enclosed
Uncomfortable with Chase's investigation, Geoff reaches for Zowie.
GEOFF
We'll take him back to the
kennels, Dad.
78A
OMITTED
BOARDING AREA - DUSK
THE KITTENS ARE HISSING, shrinking to the back of their kennel.
Zowie stands motionless before their cage, gazing in at them.
Geoff and Drew are nearby, putting the finishing touches on the
bedding inside a larger boarding kennel.
GEOFF
You think my Dad'll figure out why
he's not getting better?
DREW
You think he'd believe it if he
did?
One of the kittens SPATS fearfully at Zowie. Geoff turns to stare
at Zowie.
GEOFF
How can he not have a heartbeat?
DREW
(worried)
Maybe it takes a while...
Drew lifts Zowie into the kennel. Geoff secures the door,
something that clearly must be done from the outside.
Zowie immediately begins to pace back and forth inside the cage.
He turns towards us and we...
CUT TO:
GEOFF'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Marjorie and Geoff are at the kitchen table with the remnants of
dinner. Geoff is doing last-minute touches on his costume.
Marjorie looks over his costume. He's got a hockey mask pushed
back onto the top of his head.
MARJORIE
So who're you going as, Wayne
Gretzky?
For effect, Geoff slips the hockey mask down over his face before
answering.
GEOFF
I'm going as Jason.
MARJORIE
Jason? Who's he play for?
GEOFF
He doesn't. He hacks people up.
Geoff checks his watch.
GEOFF
I'm late.
As Geoff heads for the door, Chase is just coming in for the
evening.
CHASE
Hey! Where're you off to?
GEOFF
I'm going out, Dad!
Geoff ducks out the door. Chase turns to Marjorie.
CHASE
Out?
MARJORIE
He's probably going up to the Pet
Sematary. Kids've been going out
there on Halloween night for
years.
CHASE
What do they do up there?
MARJORIE
Oh, you know... drink beer, tell
ghost stories. They try and spook
each other out, talking about
zombies and things...
(she shrugs)
It's no big deal, Chase. I did it
when I was young.
DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Drew is at the bathroom mirror.
AMANDA
Hold still. Hold still.
Amanda puts the finishing touches of color on Drew's lips. She's
done an alarmingly good job of turning Drew into THE JOKER.
AMANDA
You make sure you're home by ten.
If Gus finds out I let you go...
DREW
(sighs)
I'll be home, Mom. Don't worry.
I won't let Gus blow up again...
Amanda looks Drew straight in the eyes.
AMANDA
Drew, I know Gus isn't your
father, but you never even knew
your real father. He walked out
on the both of us, and you
remember that.
(beat)
Gus isn't that way. He has it in
him to love us both. You just
have to give him a chance...
Drew nods respectfully. Amanda gives him a kiss. Drawing back, she
rubs out the lipmarks she's left on his made-up cheek.

OMITTED
DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Amanda draws back from the window, mortified. She nervously
crosses to the refrigerator and grabs a beer, turning as Gus
enters.
AMANDA
You're home early.
GUS
Nope. Just ran out of smokes.
Gus opens a kitchen drawer and fishes for a pack of cigarettes. He
fires one up.
GUS
Where's the boy?
Amanda squirms.
AMANDA
Uh... in his room...
Gus tightens his brow, casting a suspicious eye.
A sickened look flushes through Amanda as Gus pulls his eyes away
from her and marches upstairs.
GUS (O.S.)
DREW!
His feet POUND down the hallway. Silence for an instant. Then the
powerful swing of Drew's door. Followed by Gus' hastened return
down the hallway. And as he hustles down the stairs...
GUS
God damn it, Amanda! You want me
to be a father to the boy, and as
soon as I lay down the law, you
let him break it!
Gus stops before Amanda.
GUS
Where is he?
One step away from terror, Amanda shakes her head. Gus loses his
patience. He rips the can of beer from her grip and sends it
flying across the room.
GUS
WHERE IS YOUR SON!?
Amanda sighs in quiet defeat.
AMANDA
The Pet Sematary.
Gus turns away and heads out the door.
GEOFF'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Chase is in the study, perusing some files. He looks into the
hallway as Geoff arrives home, then glances at the clock. It's
late. Very late.
Chase rises. He's both angry and relieved. Right now, though, the
anger's winning out.
CHASE
Were you drinking?
Geoff absently shakes his head. He slumps back against the wall,
drained from the night's horrors.
CHASE
Drew's Mom called hours ago, the
rest of the kids were back by ten.
Where the hell were you boys?
Geoff shrugs, trying to mask his uneasiness.
GEOFF
Just out.
CHASE
"Out." Well that's great, Geoff.
(beat)
Look, I've been letting you get
away with a lot these past few
weeks, but I'm not going to stand
for crap like this. I don't care
if it's Halloween... it's a school
night, and if you do this again...
GEOFF
(cutting him off)
I'm really tired, Dad... can I just
go to sleep?
Chase stops and looks at his son. Geoff's exhaustion is self-
evident.
CHASE
(sighing)
Go on... we'll talk about this in
the morning.
Geoff nods and heads for the stairs.
GEOFF'S ROOM - NIGHT
THE CLOCK is creeping up on 2AM...
THUNDER rumbles outside in the distance and rain starts to spatter
the window panes.
Geoff's eyelids fall beneath unbearable weight and he nods off to
sleep. Tiger is sprawled out on the blanket against his chest.
Slowly, we move back towards the window...
In a flash of LIGHTNING--
GUS' FACE
APPEARS OUTSIDE. Washed in the haunting white glow. Streaked with
mud. Caked with blood. Staring in at Geoff.
Geoff is jolted awake by the delayed clap of THUNDER and whips his
gaze to the window. Before he can focus...
...the pulse of lightning fades away. And with it, Gus' face. Only
darkness remains beyond the window pane.
Geoff returns his gaze to the bedroom, unaware of Gus' appearance.
He sinks back to his pillow, already hurtling towards sleep once
more.
DREW'S ROOM - NIGHT
Drew is sound asleep, curled up under the sheets. He clutches his
pillow like a life preserver.
GUS (O.S.)
Drew!
Drew's eyes flutter open. He turns towards the window. Now, he
hears some activity outside. And then Gus' hushed voice.
GUS (O.S.)
Drew, buddy. I lost my keys.
Drew goes saucer-eyed. He swallows the swelling lump in his throat
and rises from his bed.
KITCHEN - NIGHT
Drew steadies his quivering fingers just enough to sink the key
into the deadbolt on the back door. Drawing the CREAKING door
open, he gazes out back.
DREW
(scared shitless)
Gus?
Nothing moves outside. The longer Drew watches, the more eerie
each shadow becomes. Spooked, Drew steps back inside, quickly
closing the door. He locks it back up again.
When he turns around, he's face to face with GUS.
Drew stiffens, backing into the wall.
DREW
H-how'd you get in?
Gus offers a nightmarish grin and raises his hand, dangling his
keys.
GUS
Found 'em.
Drew's eyes follow a flow of blood from Gus' neck to the floor.
Gus looks down at his dirty, bloody footprints. He's tracked blood
all over the linoleum.
GUS
I'm makin' a mess of your mother's
kitchen floor...
(beat)
I need a shower...
Gus turns without another word and heads for the stairs.
Drew's mouth drops in utter astonishment as he watches Gus
clumsily climbing the stairs.
After a moment, he returns his attention to the bloody kitchen
floor. Tearing off a wad of paper towels, he wets them and begins
to mop up Gus' tracks.

AT THE MIRROR - NIGHT
Gazing vacantly at his reflection, Gus covers his ravaged throat
with a gauze strip, wrapping it around the circumference of his
neck again and again and again.
Behind him, the shower is running, filling up the bathroom with
steam.
Finishing the dressing off with a sloppy tape job, Gus reaches for
the pajamas hanging nearby. He lazily buttons the buttons, failing
to notice their alignment is off. He never did bother to shower.
He's still covered with mud.
AMANDA AND GUS' BEDROOM - NIGHT
Gus enters from the steamy bathroom. The shower is still running.
Amanda stirs, sleepy eyes focusing on him.
AMANDA
Gus, hon. I'm sorry about
tonight. You coming to bed?
Gus lifts the covers and climbs in. With him comes the chill of
death. Gus presses up behind her. His hand moves beneath the
sheets, finding its way over the curve of her waist, caressing.
Amanda shivers.
AMANDA
God, you're ice cold...
(turning)
...and you smell! Lord, what did
you get yourself into?
It's then that Amanda sees the bandage around Gus' neck. Blood is
seeping through the gauze.
AMANDA
My God, Gus, what happened?
Amanda reaches out to touch him, but Gus stops her hand short of
the bandage. Instead, he leans forward and clutches one of her
breasts.
Amanda tries to twist away.
AMANDA
Gus... stop it! What's wrong with
you?!
But Gus doesn't stop. He throws himself on top of Amanda, roughly
forcing her back onto the bed.
AMANDA
Gus!!!
Amanda's hands beat at Gus' face and back, to no apparent effect.
With one arm forced against Amanda's throat, he rips open her
nightgown with the other.
We pull away from Amanda's struggles, back to the bathroom. The
shower running on and on, cloaking the bedroom in steam.
CHASE'S OFFICE - DAY
Chase enters with a stack of files tucked under his arm. As he
organizes them in the large filing cabinet with the others, he
listens to his messages on the answering machine.
The current caller sounds a little annoyed...
MESSAGE MACHINE
...Doctor Matthews, this is
Elliot Rudman at the university.
I've looked over the blood
specimen you sent us on canine
Zowie...
Chase abandons the filing and immediately returns the call. While
it RINGS...
VOICE (O.S.)
Knock, Knock, Doc.
A MOTHER and TWO TODDLERS are standing in the doorway to Chase's
office, trying not to intrude on his call.
MOTHER
(quiet whisper)
We saw your sign. Are there any
kitties left?
Chase studies them. They look like decent people.
CHASE
Take your pick. They're in the
boarding area. You can go on
back.
Chase turns away as his phone call is answered.
CHASE
Elliot, it's Chase...
CHASE'S OFFICE (INTERCUT) - DAY
ELLIOT RUDMAN has the phone tucked under his chin, in the midst of
an autopsy. The WHIRR of the saw drowns out his words as he shaves
the dome off a dog's skull.
CHASE
I didn't get that...
The pathologist turns off the saw. His words become audible.
RUDMAN
...I said next time it might help
if you took the blood sample while
the animal was still alive...
The comment hits Chase out of left field.
CHASE
What?
RUDMAN
I don't know what you expected to
find, Matthews. There's nothing
wrong with the antigens, nothing
to indicate an unusual death...
CHASE
Wait, there must be some mix-up.
He was... the dog is alive.
RUDMAN
Not this dog. There wasn't enough
oxygen in those red cells to pump
life into a flea.
Chase is baffled, speechless.
RUDMAN
You took over for Doctor Yolander?
CHASE
Yes... why?
RUDMAN
Because the last person that sent
me blood from a dead animal was
Yolander...

BOARDING AREA - DAY
The kennels have been cleaned up, but the room retains its eerie,
dimly lit quality.
The DRIP of a faucet reverberates from the far corner.
The mother enters with a toddler clinging to each hand. Their
smiles fade at the unsettling surroundings. Slowly, they move down
the row of kennels.
TODDLER
Where are the kitties?
CHASE'S OFFICE - DAY
CHASE
(into the phone)
Look, this is ridiculous...
Suddenly, BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAMS pierce the air. Chase drops the
phone and rushes out of the office...
BOARDING AREA - DAY
The toddlers are screaming at the top of their lungs. Mom is
burying their heads in her dress.
Chase bursts in as the mother hastily retreats for the exit. Her
horrified eyes flash by Chase. In an instant, she and the toddlers
are gone.
Chase remains alone, moving down the long row of kennels with
mounting trepidation...
Zowie's cage is empty.
Chase shifts his troubled gaze to the...
DRIP DRIP DRIP... as a PUDDLE OF BLOOD forms on the floor.
Chase raises his eyes...
THE KITTENS' KENNEL -
Nothing but bloody ribbons of torn flesh are left of the kittens,
dangling from the grid gate. DRIPPING.
Chase looks away as a new level of fear runs through him.
CHASE
Jesus...
It's too gruesome even for a man of Chase's background. Fighting
the gag reflex, he searches the room for the missing dog...
...and then he spots the broken glass window vent along the floor.
And the pile of blood-spattered shards laying on the tile.
CHASE'S VAN - MOVING
A MAP of Maine is unfolded on the passenger seat. Chase is on the
car phone.
CHASE
Can I have the address for Quentin
Yolander?
Chase jots an address down on the map. He turns the van up a
mountain road, winding through the towering pines.
YOLANDER'S CABIN - DAY
QUENTIN YOLANDER rocks back in his thick hide chair. His world is
closed off from daylight by the extensive blinds.
He's holding a SMALL POODLE in his lap. Its big brown eyes are
staring back at him.
YOLANDER
You'd be so much more interesting
with blue eyes...
And now, ONE OF THE POODLE'S EYES POPS OUT. Yolander's finger
comes through from beneath the eye socket.
On closer examination, WE REALIZE that the dog is not alive at
all. Yolander has his hand inside the hollowed-out carcass.
He carefully looks over a container of glass eyes on his desk and
selects the right shade of blue. A shot of whiskey rests nearby.
Yolander reaches up into the poodle's belly and fits the blue eyes
securely into place.
There's a KNOCK at the door. Yolander ignores it. Maybe he's deaf.
Another KNOCK. Yolander turns towards the door, annoyed at the
intrusion. And behind that annoyance, there's a touch of madness.
PULLING BACK, we see the rest of the room. Stuffed animals are
crowded from floor to ceiling. A product of Yolander's obsession
with TAXIDERMY.
YOLANDER
I'm immortalizing a poodle. State
your business!
Yolander presses some stuffing into the poodle's gut and begins to
sew up the stomach.
CHASE (O.S.)
Doctor Yolander. This is Chase
Matthews. I've moved into your
offices in Ludlow...
Yolander's attention remains on the needle as he meticulously
stitches the belly.
CHASE (O.S.)
(continuing)
...I sent a blood sample out for
analysis. They tell me I sent
them the blood of a dead animal...
At this, Yolander breaks his concentration. The needle pricks his
hand. Blood oozes from the puncture, dripping onto the dog's
stomach.
CHASE (O.S.)
...a dog...
Yolander rises from his seat and swings open the door.
Chase stands in the doorway, startled. It doesn't take a genius to
figure out that the good Doctor is drunk.
YOLANDER
(glaring)
Why are you bothering me about
this? Can't you leave it be?
CHASE
I... um...
Chase glances to the right and steps back...
A BOBCAT
is perched nearby, frozen in mid-pounce. It takes a second for
Chase to register that the bobcat has been stuffed.
Now Chase sees the rest of the room... a whole zoo of stuffed
animals, looking like a rural version of the Bates Motel.
CHASE
(momentarily thrown)
...the pathologist... he said that
you had reported a similar
incident... with a cat...
YOLANDER
The Creed cat, that's right.
Bastard's name was "Church".
(grins)
Let me guess. Your dog's tissue
isn't healing, pupils aren't
dilating... maybe you can't find a
heartbeat?
CHASE
Exactly! I thought it might be
some sort of blood condition...
immune deficiency or...
Quentin Yolander laughs. It's disconcerting.
YOLANDER
There's no "blood condition." The
dog isn't sick, it's dead.
(drawing closer)
And so was Creed's cat. And so
was his wife the night she was
killed for the second time...
As Yolander moves forward, Chase backs up. He bumps into a whole
shelf of stuffed creatures. To his right, A RAVEN sits frozen on
its perch. Chase regards Yolander as being completely insane.
YOLANDER
(menacing)
You want some advice, friend? You
get in your car, you pick up your
family... and you get the hell out
of that town.
CHASE
Well... uh... thanks...
Chase continues to back out of the door. On his way out, he bumps
into the stuffed raven's perch...
...only this raven isn't stuffed. It spreads its wings and
SCREECHES.
Chase just about jumps out of his skin, tripping out of the
doorway.

DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT
The dinner from Hell. Geoff splats a helping of mashed potatoes
onto his plate, all the while keeping a wary eye on Gus...
Gus is serving himself a chunk of rabbit. It hits the edge of the
plate, teetering on the rim. He passes the dish on.
Gus meets Geoff's gaze. For a moment, there's a deadened, vacant
look in Gus' eyes. Then slowly, a limp smile creeps over him,
sending a chill up Geoff's spine.
Geoff averts Gus' stare. Gus helps himself to potatoes and passes
the plate on. He lets go of it short of reaching Drew. Only Drew's
quick hands save it from hitting the table.
Amanda comes to the table with a dish of LIMA BEANS. She casts Gus
a cold, hateful stare and sets the limas down. She's still angry
over last night.
Gus dishes a sloppy scoop and passes it toward Drew. Like before,
he lets it drop too early. This time Drew doesn't save it. The
lima beans shower the floor.
AMANDA
God damnit, Gus! This isn't
funny!
Amanda fetches a dishtowel and kneels to clean up the mess.
Geoff and Drew exchange quick glances. As Geoff reaches for the
salt...
...Gus intercepts his wrist. Geoff gulps.
Gus drops his jaw, revealing a gooey mass of food. But the frozen
smile and the look in his eyes convey dementia rather than
playfulness.
Geoff and Drew can't believe their eyes. They laugh uncomfortably.
There's no other response.
Gus LAUGHS too... awkward, terrible laughter. Spitting out food
over his shirt and plate as he does so.
The boys stop laughing, but Gus just keeps on going.
Amanda stares at Gus and carries the mess out of the room.
Through his laughter, Gus' bandage has slipped down, exposing part
of his ragged wound. The wound glistens, oozing CLOTTED BLOOD and
GOOEY PUS.
Drew hesitantly reaches for Gus' neck, readjusting the bandage.
Grossed out, Geoff averts his eyes and sets his fork aside.
DREW'S ROOM - LATER
Geoff and Drew enter. Drew swiftly secures the deadbolts on his
door.
GEOFF
What was that all about? You
think he's trying to scare us?
DREW
I don't know but I'm not taking
any chances...
Drew opens the chest at the foot of his bed and produces a
SHOTGUN. A box full of shells spill as he withdraws the gun.
Cracking open the chamber, Drew loads two shells into the chamber.
CHASE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Chase sits in the den, looking exhausted and disheveled. In front
of him, the t.v. is on. RENEE'S FACE stares out at us. Chase hits
the remote and rises, moving to the back door.
He checks the deadbolt, then secures the chain link as a backup.
From somewhere outside, we hear a DOG HOWL.
Chase's eyes drop to the DOGGY DOOR, a holdover from the previous
owner. Chase bends down and latches the door.
Now he pauses at his desk... considers... then pulls something out
of the bottom drawer. It's a gun.
HALLWAY - NIGHT
Chase moves to the front of the house, securing that door.
Satisfied, he turns off the light and heads upstairs...
WE STAY AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS -
MOVING INTO DARKNESS, shadow and form begin to take shape. We hear
a low GROWL and see a flash of RED EYES. It's Zowie. Already in
the house.

CHASE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Coming through the door from the downstairs, Chase stops cold.
RENEE is on the bed. Clothed in a negligee. Lying across a blanket
of rose petals. Her eyes meet his with powerful longing.
RENEE
Chase. I miss you so much...
CHASE
(dry-mouthed)
Renee...
Chase approaches. Slowly. Fearful that this is all a dream.
Renee reaches out her hand. They touch. This is not a dream.
CHASE
Oh God...
Chase absently sets his gun on the bedside table as Renee draws
his body to hers.
They kiss. Once. Twice. Not a dream.
Renee rolls Chase over, forcefully climbing on top. Chase sinks
down into the center of the bed as Renee straddles him.
Slowly, Renee slips off the top of her negligee...
RENEE
(a whisper)
I can come back, Chase...
...and sinks down on top of him, kissing him hungrily.
Her nipples graze his chest, then her breasts flatten as she
grinds her hips against his.
Almost instantly, the weight of her grows unbearable. Chase fights
to pull his mouth from hers, to breathe...
CHASE
No... Too heavy.
There is no pleasure in his words, just unmitigated horror as
Renee's body comes down on him harder.
CHASE
...can't breathe... I can't...
CHASE'S EYES
pop open, frenzied, AS HE COMES OUT OF HIS DREAM.
Chase is alone on the bed, but he's still feeling the weight
pressing down on him...
ZOWIE
is laying on his chest, staring back at him, rearing his teeth in
a growl...
Zowie LUNGES forward, jaws flashing, and Chase twists sideways...
GNASHING TEETH connect with Chase's shoulder, then with the
pillows where Chase's head used to be. A BLIZZARD OF DOWN FEATHERS
ERUPTS...
Chase scrambles out of bed, flailing for the gun on the bedside
table...
THE GUN spins out of reach and across the floor...
Chase DIVES for the gun and reaches it just as Zowie leaps to the
floor. In a panic, Chase FIRES WILD...
Zowie abruptly turns and SMASHES through the bedroom window,
sending glass flying.
CHASE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Chase looks on in terror. Finally he pulls his eyes away from the
shattered window...
...and catches a glimpse of something in the dresser mirror.
Something that sends a chill up his spine.
The flurry of down feathers is floating to the mattress. But
intermingling with the feathers are a handful of ROSE PETALS,
slowly settling to the bed.
BATHROOM - MORNING
Chase is bare-chested at the mirror, applying a dressing to the
dog bite on his shoulder.
Marjorie appears in the doorway with a basket of laundry. She
stops short at the sight of Chase standing there in his boxers.
Chase catches her reflection in the mirror and is startled.
MARJORIE
I didn't mean to... I was going to
empty the hamper...
Chase turns, shaking off the scare.
CHASE
It's okay.
Marjorie's eyes can't help but fix on the dog bites scattered over
Chase's chest and arms.
MARJORIE
What happened to you?
CHASE
I had a little run-in with Zowie.
MARJORIE
You sure did...
Marjorie sets the laundry aside.
MARJORIE
Here, let me do that...
Marjorie looks over the antiseptics Chase has laid out on the
sink. Saturating a wad of gauze with hydrogen peroxide, she gently
cleanses the gashes on his arms.
There's nothing overtly sexual in her actions, but the gentleness
of her touch doesn't go unnoticed by Chase.
MARJORIE
I hope he doesn't have rabies.
CHASE
He doesn't. I don't know what he
has, but I'm hoping to God it's
not infectious...
Chase stops and looks at Marjorie's reflection in the mirror.
CHASE
Marjorie... what do you know about
the Creed murders?
Marjorie stiffens for a moment. Obviously the Creeds are a sore
spot for the people in this town.
MARJORIE
Did you ever play that game where
you pass a story down a row of
people and see how screwed up it
gets by the time it's done?
People say Louis Creed's son came
back from the dead and it drove
him crazy...
(she rolls her eyes)
He killed his wife and himself,
and that's the end of story.
Anything else belongs in the
National Enquirer.
Marjorie tapes the bandage over Chase's shoulder too tight.
Chase's groan snaps her back to the reality at hand.
MARJORIE
Sorry. Now tell me what that has
to do with Zowie?
Chase closes his eyes, shutting out the pain.
CHASE
I wish I knew.
LIBRARY - DAY
Chase approaches the counter, looking to the ELDERLY LIBRARIAN for
assistance.
LIBRARIAN
What are you looking for, Hon.
CHASE
Do you have anything on the Creed
murders? I can't find the
microfilm from that period...
The librarian's smile vanishes. She lowers her voice, focusing her
attention on some paperwork.
LIBRARIAN
We don't keep anything on file
from that far back.
CHASE
But you've got files from the
previous years...
LIBRARIAN
We have nothing on the Creed
murders, sir. Can I get you
something else?
Chase looks around and realizes that a dozen hostile eyes are on
him. TOWNSPEOPLE withholding a dark secret.
Chase slowly backs away, eager to escape the field of hostile
stares.

DREW'S HOUSE - DAY
Drew rushes through the front door, SLAMMING it behind him and
throwing the deadbolt.
BEDROOM - DAY
Drew climbs onto his bed and grabs his shotgun from the gun rack.
His fingers shake as he flips off the safety.
DREW
Oh man...
Just then we hear the CRACKLE of a POLICE P.A. and Gus' amplified
VOICE coming from the yard outside.
GUS (V.O.)
(mocking)
This is the Police, come out of
the house with your hands up!
Gus finishes his words with a burst of FEEDBACK and then amplified
MANIACAL LAUGHTER.
Drew's eyes go wide with terror. He creeps out into the hall,
clutching the gun.
HALLWAY - DAY
Drew tries to look out the window. Then we hear a low, guttural
GROWL. Drew slowly turns...
Zowie is standing down the hall, leveling a dead stare. Zowie
takes the first step forward.
DREW
(horrified)
No, Zowie! It's me!
Pleading, Drew slowly retreats down the hallway.
Along the way, he backs right into...
GUS, grinning from ear to ear.
Drew recoils against the wall, swinging up his shotgun.
DREW
Stay back!
But Gus just keeps on grinning. He takes a step forward...
Drew pulls the trigger...
And CLICK! Nothing happens. The chambers are empty.
GUS
Forget something, Drew buddy?
Gus raises his hand. He's holding the shotgun shells. He lets them
fall to the floor.
Suddenly Gus wrenches the gun from Drew's hands. He swings it
and...
...Drew SCREAMS and ducks beneath the blow, as the shotgun butt
SMASHES a hole in the wall above his head. Gus flings the shotgun
aside and LUNGES for Drew...
Drew races down the hallway to the back door. He turns the latch.
The deadbolt has been locked from the inside.
Drew's eyes whip to the keyholder on the wall. All the keyhooks
are empty.
Here comes the JINGLING of keys in Gus' pockets as he comes down
the hall...
Drew dashes away from the back door.
Gus' eyes shift from Drew's fleeing form to A BOX OF TOOLS in the
service closet.
AT THE FRONT DOOR
Drew jimmies the knob. Again, the deadbolt is locked from the
inside. Tears are streaming down Drew's face now.
FOOTSTEPS approach. Drew spins around...
Gus is advancing, WITH A HAMMER tight in his grip.
GUS
(crazed)
You have the right to remain
silent...
WHAM! Gus SMASHES the hammer into the wall to punctuate his words.
Plaster goes flying.
GUS
(continuing)
...while I bash your fucking head
in!
Drew's eyes dart frantically, looking for a way out. The closest
route of escape is UP THE STAIRS.
Down the hallway, Zowie starts running forward. Drew's caught
between a rock and a hard place...
GUS
You have the right to a lawyer,
but you won't need one...
He runs for it. Gus charges to intercept him...
Drew gets to the stairs first.
GUS
...cause you'll be dead!
WHAM! Gus brings the hammer down with the claw end leading. It
sinks into the stair below Drew's feet...
Zowie LEAPS past Gus, tearing up the stairs as Gus wrenches the
hammer free...
UPSTAIRS
Drew makes it to the top of the stairs with Zowie right on his
heels.
Drew DIVES into Amanda and Gus' bedroom as...
Zowie springs from the floor. Drew SLAMS the door shut, SMACKING
Zowie. Zowie collapses to the floor, dazed.
BEDROOM - DAY
Drew throws the latch on the door. Almost immediately, Gus is
outside, POUNDING at the door with the claw end of the hammer.
Wood splinters fly as the hammer claw sinks through...
Drew SCREAMS and goes for one of the dormer windows. It's stuck;
he can't get it open.
From the hallway, Gus violently SMASHES the door again and again.
The door is splintering apart. WE SEE glimpses of Gus through the
ragged holes.
GUS (O.S.)
Do you understand these rights,
Drew buddy?!
Drew grabs a chair and HEAVES it through the window...
GUS (O.S.)
...OR ARE YOU JUST TOO FUCKING
STUPID?!
The bedroom door EXPLODES INWARD and Gus claws his way into the
room...
Wasting no time, Drew climbs through the broken window...
CAR - DAY
Speeding down the highway. Drew and Amanda are mortified.
Suddenly, we hear the WAIL of Gus' patrol car coming up from
behind. Amanda looks to the rear-view mirror...
AMANDA'S CAR - DAY
Amanda hips her head back in front of them. The potato truck is
blaring its HORN.
Gus' car swerves out onto the shoulder, speeding up to match her
pace.
DREW
Mom!!!
Gus cranks the wheel, jumping back onto the road, forcing Amanda's
car into the path of the oncoming truck.
POTATO TRUCK - DAY
THE DRIVER stands on the BRAKES.
GEOFF'S HOUSE - DUSK
Geoff enters first. Wearing a dark suit. Looking pale and empty
inside. Chase follows, dressed in black. It's obvious they've been
to a funeral.
Without a word, Geoff heads up the stairs. Chase watches on,
feeling utterly helpless.
UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY
Chase exits from his bedroom, pulling a sweater over a more casual
change of clothes. He cocks his head at the SOUNDS of Geoff moving
about in the attic above.
The door atop the attic stairway is barely ajar.
Chase wrinkles his brow, concerned. Turning away, he heads
downstairs.
KITCHEN - DAY
Marjorie is preparing dinner. Across the room, the kitchen TV is
playing...
ON TELEVISION is the evening news. A photo of Drew and Amanda
appears above the NEWSCASTER.
NEWSCASTER
... Friends and neighbors came to
pay respects for Drew and Amanda
Gilbert, who died in a head-on
collision Saturday...
Chase enters the kitchen, eyes moving to the TV.
MARJORIE
Those poor people. I saw Gus this
morning... he looked terrible.
Chase pulls his eyes away from the broadcast as Marjorie sets
dinner on the table. Chase yells upstairs.
CHASE
Geoff, dinner's ready!
(after no reply)
Geoff?!
GEOFF (O.S.)
I'm not hungry.
Chase gives Marjorie an apologetic look and rises from the table.
Meanwhile, the news broadcast continues. A photo of Clyde appears
on the screen.
NEWSCASTER
...in other news, the
disappearance of a Ludlow youth
remains a mystery. Clyde Parker
was last seen on Saturday
afternoon. His motorcycle was
found off Highway 62...

ATTIC - NIGHT
Chase pushes open the door. A spring coil pulls the CREAKING door
closed behind him. One look at the attic and Chase turns pale...
A huge window at the far end of the room allows the moonlight to
reach all corners of the spacious old attic...
All of Renee's belongings have been unpacked. The entire attic has
been converted into a museum-like room, down to the last
meticulous detail. A room in preparation for Renee's return.
Gauzy curtains billow out from some unseen draft. Pictures of
Renee rest everywhere. Awards. Memorabilia...
GEOFF is seated before the brightly lit, three-way theatrical
mirror, casually setting out Renee's make-up.
CHASE
Geoff... what are you doing?
There's an obsessive dementia in Geoff's gaze.
GEOFF
I'm getting things ready for Mom.
Chase sighs. Obviously the strain of Drew's funeral has proven too
much for Geoff. He moves closer.
CHASE
(gently)
Mom is dead, Geoff. You know
that...
A creepy smile flickers across Geoff's face.
GEOFF
She doesn't have to be.
Chase freezes as a chill runs up his spine.
CHASE
What are you talking about?
GEOFF
I can bring her back. The same
way Drew and me brought Zowie
back...
At this, Chase is positively spooked.
CHASE
Geoff, this is crazy. Zowie
didn't die.
GEOFF
He did. We buried him.
(intense)
There's a place out in the
woods... if you bury something
there, it comes back alive.
Chase stares at his son. This is insane. It must be.
Just then, the PHONE RINGS downstairs. Geoff continues to stare at
his father.
GEOFF
We tried it on Zowie first. And
then we did it again, when Zowie
killed Gus. Drew didn't want Gus
to be dead, so we brought him
back, too...
It's too much for Chase. His mouth is hanging agape.
MARJORIE (O.S.)
(outside the attic
door)
Doctor Matthews, you've got a
call. It's the caretaker at the
funeral home. Something about
your wife's grave...
Chase nods in private acknowledgement. He stares at Geoff as he
backs away.
CHASE
Look, Geoff. Just... just relax,
okay. I'm going to take this call
and I'll be right back. Okay?
Geoff doesn't respond. Chase pulls open the door and leaves.
KITCHEN - NIGHT
Chase is on the phone. The CALLER'S WORDS bring grave concern to
Chase.
CHASE
What?! Christ, I'll be right
there...
Chase hangs up, stunned. He turns to Marjorie, who's watching him
with a concerned gaze.
CHASE
(hurried)
Marjorie, I need you to stay late.
Geoff is really upset and I have
to take care of this. Don't let
him leave the house, alright?
Chase is out the door before she has a chance to respond.

ATTIC - NIGHT
Geoff is laying on his mother's bed, weeping. Tiger sits at the
foot of the bed. Suddenly she wakens and HISSES.
From out of the darkness...
RENEE'S HAND
ENTERS FRAME, gently touching Geoff's side. And with its arrival,
so comes her eerie LULLABY.
RENEE
(a whisper)
I need you, Geoff...
GEOFF
slowly raises his head, bewildered. Renee's hand withdraws into
the darkness. He reaches out for her, but she's gone. The LULLABY
remains, beckoning from down the attic stairs.
The attic door slowly swings open of its own accord.
Geoff rises from the bed and follows.
DOWNSTAIRS FOYER - NIGHT
Geoff looks into the living room as he passes. Marjorie has fallen
asleep on the sofa with the TV on.

VAN - NIGHT
The van is speeding down the dark, open highway. Chase is on the
car phone, frantic, waiting as it RINGS. There's finally an
answer...
CHASE
Doctor Yolander, this is Chase
Matthews, we spoke the other
day...
Yolander cuts him off.
YOLANDER'S VOICE
(bitter)
You didn't leave town, did you.
YOLANDER'S HOUSE (INTERCUT)
Yolander sits in the darkness, a bottle of whiskey and a tumbler
at his side. His "creatures" are all around him, eyes glowing with
reflected moonlight. His voice is slurred. The voice of someone
who's already damned.
YOLANDER
You sorry bastard. You stayed. I
have nothing more to say to you,
Matthews...
CHASE'S VOICE
(desperate)
Look, just tell me one thing. Did
I treat an animal that had been
brought back to life? Did I?!
YOLANDER
What do you think?
CHASE'S VAN - NIGHT
Chase grips the carphone tightly, his knuckles white.
YOLANDER (V.O.)
Believe what you saw, Matthews.
The dog was dead.
CHASE
My God...
(mounting horror)
...how is that possible? You have
to help me, Doctor Yolander. I
don't know what I'm dealing with
here! They've dug up my wife...
YOLANDER'S VOICE
(cutting him off)
I'm retired from my practice,
Matthews. It's your practice now,
and it's your problem.
(beat)
God help you...
CHASE
(screaming)
Wait! Don't hang up!
But Yolander does. And now we hear the DIAL TONE.
CHASE
Shit!
Chase flings the carphone down, looking up as...
An approaching potato truck ZOOMS by. Blinding headlights. A
BLARING HORN. Chase barely swerves out of the way.
Recovering from the scare, Chase reaches over and opens the glove
compartment. He pulls out his gun and sets it on the seat next to
him.
GEOFF'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Marjorie stirs on the couch, blinking her eyes open at the SOUND
of a THUD upstairs. Otherwise, the house is dark and silent.
MARJORIE
Geoff?
HALLWAY - NIGHT
Marjorie starts up the long, dark flight of stairs to the attic.
The thin night-shirt she's wearing does little to protect her from
the sudden cold. She clutches herself, shivering.
MARJORIE
Geoff? You okay up there?
ATTIC - NIGHT
Marjorie cautiously pushes open the door. Her concern for Geoff is
forgotten as she beholds the Renee Hallow memorabilia.
She moves about Renee's unpacked belongings in bewildered
reverence.
The gauzy curtains billow about Marjorie like ghosts. And then she
glimpses something beyond the curtains...
A FIGURE
stands in the shadows, wearing the BEADED PEACH DRESS that
Marjorie had admired earlier. For a moment we think it's Renee,
but as Marjorie draws closer, we see that the dress has been
fitted onto a dressmaker's model.
Marjorie lays a hand on the fabric, feeling the contours of the
design.
GUS' HOUSE - NIGHT
Chase's headlights stream through the windows, distorting the
interior. The house looks like it's been through a tornado. A
trail of BLOODY PAW PRINTS leads into the kitchen. The stench is
repulsive. Grimacing, Chase has to keep himself from gagging.
CHASE
Jesus...
As Chase moves forward, he catches sight of...
GUS
standing in a swath of light. At Gus' feet is Zowie, tongue
lolling out of his mouth. Dead for the second time. Scattered
around the dog are various tools.
Propped against the wall is the cut out square of wood. It's
fitted with hinges at the top.
CHASE
Gus, what are you doing?!
Gus glances down at the dead dog.
GUS
(dead-pan)
I was building a doggy door.
CHASE
God damn it Gus, you dug up my
wife! What the fuck is going on
around here?!
Gus brings a cordless electric drill up from his side, pointing it
at Chase in a threatening manner.
GUS
(grins)
A little drilling. A little
killing.
As Gus moves forward, Chase gets a good look at him for the first
time. He doesn't look even remotely alive.
CHASE
Holy shit!
Chase levels his gun with a trembling hand.
Gus stabs the air with the drill, feeding on Chase's horror.
Chase pulls the trigger. A bullet pounds Gus' chest. A SPRAY OF
FLESH explodes from his back.
Unphased, Gus regains his balance.
GUS
God I hate when that happens...
Before Chase can squeeze off the next round, Gus rips the gun from
his grip...
GUS
You got a permit for that?
Opening the chamber, Gus empties the remaining bullets and tosses
the gun aside.
GUS
Didn't think so.
Gus fires up the drill. The bit spinZZZZZZ. He DIVES at Chase,
knocking him back against the counter. The drill bit SINKS INTO
CHASE'S ARM...
Chase SCREAMS as Gus withdraws it. Now, he presses it into Chase's
shoulder. Chase is on the verge of blacking out now. The pain is
unbearable...
Gus withdraws the drill once again, aiming now for Chase's eye.
GUS
(maniacal)
No brain, no pain, Chase. Think
about it...
The whirling drill bit is millimeters away from Chase's eye. He
clutches Gus' arm, trying to force the drill aside...
At the last second, adrenaline kicks in and Chase diverts the
drill. It SINKS INTO the counter-top nearby... STUCK.
Gus ROARS, lashing out, but Chase manages to duck away...
Chase catches sight of HIS GUN on the floor. He scrambles for it,
scooping it up...
BULLETS are rolling across the floor every which way. Chase slaps
his palm down on one and desperately fumbles with the chamber...
Gus' hands CLAMP DOWN around Chase's neck. He swings Chase around
and SLAMS him against the wall, lifting him off his feet...
Chase GASPS as the life is literally crushed out of him...
He brings the gun up beneath Gus' chin and jams it into his ruined
throat. Gus just keeps on throttling him...
GUS
(insane)
Just remember, Chase... I had Renee
first... and now I'm gonna have her
last...
BLAM! The top of Gus' head BLOWS off. His BODY is thrown back by
the incredible force, tumbling him to the kitchen floor with a
HEAVY THUD.
Chase sucks in precious air, then his head snaps up.
CHASE
Geoff!
ATTIC - NIGHT
Marjorie is now seated before Renee's theatrical make-up mirror,
entranced. She's wearing the beaded peach dress.
With the help of Renee's vast array of cosmetics, Marjorie has
turned herself into a stunning beauty.
The lipstick isn't quite right. Turning to the countertop
magnifying mirror, she carefully touches up her ruby red lips. Her
face fills nearly the entire mirror...
...except for one rim, which reflects the dark, shadowy attic
behind her.
A HUGE EYE joins her reflection in the distorting mirror. Marjorie
nearly jumps out of her skin. She spins around...
MARJORIE
Jesus, Geoff! Don't sneak up on
me like that!
...but no one is there.
THE MAKE-UP MIRROR catches another glimpse. Renee's RED LIPS,
magnified tenfold. The lips begin to move...
RENEE
(a whisper)
Did you really think you could be
like me?
Renee's fist swings in, SMASHING a panel of the mirror...
Marjorie raises her hands to protect herself against the flying
glass. And as her hands come down, she finds...
Renee standing before her. Her ghostly form silhouetted by
moonlight. Curtains billowing around her. We never fully see her.
Marjorie's face goes white with fear.
RENEE
Such a young face... but you've got
potential...
Renee grabs a fistful of Marjorie's hair, viciously YANKING her
head back...
RENEE
We'll do the eyes first. You
always start with the eyes...
Renee lashes out, SLASHING a mirror shard across the skin beneath
Marjorie's right eye. Marjorie SCREAMS.
GEOFF'S ROOM - NIGHT
Geoff awakens at the commotion upstairs. He rocks forward, rising
from his bed.
185
OMITTED
HALLWAY - NIGHT
Geoff pauses at the base of the attic stairway, looking up at the
open door. All he hears are the faint SOUNDS of movement.
GEOFF
Marjorie? You know you're not
supposed to be in the attic.
Geoff starts up the stairs.
ATTIC - NIGHT
Geoff trepidatiously enters. He weaves through the maze of gauzy
curtains. And then he sees her...
Renee is standing in the midst of the attic. She's perfectly made
up. Gorgeous. Just as she was on the day she died. She smiles
warmly.
GEOFF
Mom...
RENEE
I came back for you, Geoff. We're
going to be together again.
Renee raises her outstretched arms to receive him. Through the
haze of his tears, Geoff doesn't see the sinister, vacant gleam in
her eyes.
CHASE'S VAN - NIGHT
Reaching the house, Chase SKIDS to a stop across the lawn.
188B
OMITTED
ATTIC - NIGHT
Chase cautiously enters with the gun in his grasp. The spring coil
swings the CREAKING door shut behind him.
From Chase's vantage point, he can't see them yet. He makes his
way around the stripped dressmaker's model, past an upright
dressing mirror. And then he sees...
MARJORIE
Slumped against Renee's bed like a ragdoll. We can only see half
of her face. It looks untouched. Chase reaches for her...
CHASE
Marjorie?
Marjorie's head rolls sideways, exposing the other half of her
face. The skin has been stripped from her skull and peeled back...
Chase turns his head away. And that's when he sees them...
RENEE AND GEOFF
Holding each other tightly. Geoff has his head buried in Renee's
breast. Renee looks up from her son, meeting Chase's gaze. Her
voice is both seductive and terrifying.
RENEE
Hello, Chase.
Chase gasps. The word "horror" doesn't do the moment justice.
CHASE
Oh my God...
RENEE
We can try again, Chase. We can
make it work this time.
Chase sinks back against the wall. He's lost a lot of blood and
his strength is leaving him.
CHASE
(shaking his head)
No...
RENEE
Don't you love me anymore, Chase?
CHASE
You're not Renee... Renee's dead...
(screaming)
Geoff! Get over here now!
But Geoff just holds his mother tighter. A hint of annoyance
flickers through Renee's eyes. She strokes Geoff's hair.
RENEE
(looking at Chase)
Geoff, honey, why don't you go
downstairs. Your father and I
need a moment alone. Do it for
me?
Geoff looks up at his mother, mesmerized. She releases him from
the embrace. He brushes past Chase without a glance and heads for
the attic door.
RENEE
Geoff...
Geoff pauses at the door, looking back. Renee's words have a
hauntingly familiar ring...
RENEE
I love you.
Geoff smiles. Turning away, he opens the door and...
CLYDE
is standing there, an AXE perched on his shoulder. His face is
torn to shit, bones and brain matter exposed. He's covered from
head to toe in dirt and clotted blood. He looks worse than any of
the undead we've seen. A total walking nightmare.
CLYDE
(grinning)
Hey, Junior. Wanna play?
WHOOSH! Clyde swings the axe, sinking it into the wall just in
front of Geoff's face...
Geoff tumbles back onto the floor, snapping out of his trance.
Clyde brings the axe down...
...and Geoff rolls to the side, barely avoiding decapitation.
CHASE
Geoff!
Chase stumbles forward to rescue his son. As he does so, Clyde
brings the axe back up, SMASHING Chase in the head with the blunt
end...
Chase goes down. Unconscious.
CLYDE
Oops! Looks like Daddy got a boo-
boo...
Clyde turns his gaze back on Geoff.
CLYDE
Now, where were we?
Geoff shuffles backwards across the floor as Clyde moves into the
room.
Renee passes behind Clyde. She SLAMS the attic door shut and snaps
off the knob with a jerk of the wrist, locking them all inside.
Scared out of his wits, Geoff makes it to his feet. Clyde swings
again and misses...
Geoff grabs hold of the axe handle, struggling, and the two boys
go down...
RENEE
Moves to the vanity. She sweeps a hand across it, sending
everything crashing to the ground. Crystal perfume bottles
SHATTER, spilling their contents over the floor.
Renee reaches for a lighter and flicks it on. She touches the
flame to the perfume-soaked floor...
FLAMES roar into existence, racing across the floorboards,
igniting the curtains...
We see the flames reflected in Renee's soulless eyes.
ON GEOFF AND CLYDE
As they wrestle with one another across the floor. Bloody spittle
drips from Clyde's face. He flashes a feral snarl.
Clyde LUNGES forward and tears into Geoff's shoulder with his
teeth...
Geoff SCREAMS. His hands grope blindly for a weapon and close on a
mirror shard. He JABS it up and into Clyde's eye...
Somehow, Geoff manages to roll out from under Clyde. He rises to
his feet...
Clyde lets loose a DEMONIC ROAR. He charges, SLASHING the axe
wildly, knocking aside curtains and dressing models alike.
Nothing's going to stop him. Nothing.
Flames are consuming the attic, licking the rafters, igniting the
canopy drapings... devouring everything. SMOKE is rolling across
the floor...
Geoff reaches a far wall. He's trapped in a corner. There's
nowhere else to go. Behind Geoff is a CIRCUIT BOX. INSULATED
CABLES run from the box down through the attic floor. Geoff
turns...
And here comes Clyde...
CLYDE
Here it comes, buddy! HERE IT
FUCKING COMES!!!
Clyde swings. Geoff ducks. The axe hits the circuit box behind
him, severing the insulated cables...
As Clyde rips the axe out of the wall for another try, Geoff
reaches for one of the SPARKING CABLES.
Clyde raises the axe above his head...
CLYDE
Eat it, ass-hole...
GEOFF
EAT THIS!!!
...and Geoff shoves the live cable into Clyde's mouth!
SPARKS shoot out of Clyde's eyes and ears. He jerks back and
forth, writhing in a horrific replay of Renee's electrocution.
Then Clyde's face BLOWS APART in a gout of ruined flesh and BLUE
FLAME. The circuit is blown and the SMOKING BODY falls...
Geoff drops the cable. The blazing inferno is closing in. He runs
to Chase...
Chase is barely conscious. Geoff drops to his knees and pulls his
father to his feet...
RENEE (O.S.)
Don't leave me again, Geoff!
Geoff turns...
RENEE
is standing in the midst of the FLAMES, reaching out. The make-up
and mortician's wax she wears fall victim to the heat and her
"face" begins to MELT AWAY...
RENEE
Don't leave me alone!
Geoff turns away, horrified. With Chase on his shoulder, he
reaches the door. Locked. Geoff sets Chase against the wall.
He spots the AXE, still clutched in Clyde's hand. Geoff drags the
axe free from the dead boy's grasp and goes to work on the door...
Ignoring Renee's CRIES, Geoff swings the axe again and again,
chopping the door apart. He coughs through the smoke. The flames
are almost upon them...
Finally, the wood splinters apart. Geoff reaches through and
grasps the outside handle, pulling the door open. Then he turns
and lifts Chase up once more...
At the door, Geoff pauses for one final, tearful look back. Then
his face hardens and he turns away, pulling Chase to safety.
RENEE
NO, GEOFF! NO!!!
ON RENEE
Alone in the fiery storm, SCREAMING. Flames devour her flowing
white dress. Her face doesn't even look remotely human anymore.
And as the inferno slowly closes in, we...
DISSOLVE TO:
