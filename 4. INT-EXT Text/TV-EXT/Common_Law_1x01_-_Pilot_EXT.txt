      A woman's voice talks over the establishing shot of this
      modern community center.

                                    DR. RYAN (O.S.)
                    Today, we're going to discuss
                      intimacy...



      Travis catches up with Wes as they head to the parking lot.

                                    WES
                    I can't believe we're doing this.

                                      TRAVIS
                    We wouldn't be if you hadn't pulled
                    your gun on me.

                                    WES
                    I wouldn't have pulled my gun on you
                    if you'd just learn to apologize.

                                      TRAVIS
                    I didn't do anything wrong.

                                    WES
                    You know what?  Just shut up. 

                                      TRAVIS
                    Dr. Ryan said we're supposed to talk
                    about these things.

      They reach a silver Fisker Karma hybrid sports car parked at
      the curb and Wes clicks the doors unlocked.

                                      TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                    I think she's going to be good for
                    us.  She seems really smart.

      Wes shoots Travis a look, realizing--

                                    WES
                    Give it up.  She's way out of your league.



      Wes and Travis head to the cordoned-off crime scene, which
    is swarming with FIRST RESPONDERS and CRIME SCENE TECHNICIANS.

      They're greeted by a sloppy, overweight BEAT COP, who's
      surprised to see them together.  They talk as they all push
      through a crowd of LOOKIE-LOOS. 

                                    BEAT COP
                    I thought you guys broke up. 

                                      TRAVIS
                    We're in couples counseling.

      The beat cop laughs, then realizes they're not joking.

                                    BEAT COP
                    Get out.  For real?

                                      TRAVIS
                    We wanted to find the magic again.

      Wes's look says it all.  The beat cop considers that.

                                    BEAT COP
                    Does that work?  Because my wife
                    keeps saying we need counseling.  

      Wes regards the slovenly cop, incredulous.

                                    WES
                    You're married?

                                    BEAT COP
                    13 years.  Now, all of a sudden she
                    thinks I'm a sex-addict because I
                    want to do it more than once a month. 
                    Maybe the wife and I should join
                    your group.

      They duck under the police tape cordoning off the area.  

                                    WES
                    Let me save you a lot of time and
                    money.  You don't need therapy.  You
                    just need to lose weight.  

                                    BEAT COP
                    She says she likes me chubby.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/107.
 

                                    WES
                    And you believe her?

      That stops the beat cop.  He regards Wes.

                                    BEAT COP
                    You're an asshole, you know that?

                                      TRAVIS
                    No.  He doesn't know that.  That's
                    why he's in therapy.

      They arrive at the DEAD BODY wearing filthy jeans, no shoes,
      and lying face-down in the mud.  

                                    WES
                    So, what do we got?

                                    BEAT COP
                    Victim is a white male.  Indigent.  
                    John Doe.  Puncture wounds in the
                    neck.  

      Donning rubber gloves, Wes and Travis kneel to inspect the
      body.  Travis searches the victim's pockets.  Wes lifts the
      victim's shirt.  The skin on the victim's back is reddish.  

                                    BEAT COP (CONT'D)
                    Another homeless junkie looking to
                    score got the Sidewalk Special.  

                                    WES
                      Interesting theory.  Except the victim
                    wasn't killed here--he's lying on
                    his stomach, but the hypostasis on
                    his back indicates he was moved.  He
                    wasn't homeless either.  He's wearing
                    designer jeans.

      Wes and Travis gently roll the body over, and we now see the
      victim's face.  The victim has a straggly beard and more
      stab wounds to his chest and cuts on his hands.

                                    WES (CONT'D)
                    But you were right about the white
                    male part.  Keep up the good work,
                    and you'll make captain in no time.

                                    BEAT COP
                          (to Travis)
                    How do you work with this guy?      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/108.
 

                                      TRAVIS
                    Our therapist says it's because I'm
                    attracted to abusive relationships.

      Wes spots something poking out under the VICTIM'S BODY.  He
      reaches down and slides out a BLOODY EAGLE SCOUT KNIFE.  

                                    WES
                    Eagle Scout knife.

                                      TRAVIS
                    What?  They giving out merit badges
                    for killing homeless people now?

      Wes shoots him a look. 

                                      TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                    You used to laugh at my jokes.

                                    WES
                    You used to be funny.

      The knife is photographed, bagged, and tagged as they talk.

                                    WES (CONT'D)
                          (to the beat cop)
                    Any witnesses?  

                                    BEAT COP
                    Probably, but no one's talking.  Bad
                    for business.  Fulton Street is the
                    Rodeo Drive of drug dealing.

      Travis scans the crowd of lookie-loos.

                                      TRAVIS
                    You know, when I was a kid, I lived
                    in a neighborhood like this.  One
                    time, this rich guy crashed his car,
                    and by the time the ambulance arrived,
                    his rims, radio, watch, wedding
                      ring...everything was gone. 

      Catching on, Wes looks to the shoeless John Doe, then follows
      Travis's gaze to the crowd where Wes now notices--

      A TEENAGER wearing new sneakers.  

                                      WES/TRAVIS
                    Let me do the talking.  

      But the teenager realizes they're looking at him and takes
      off running.  Wes and Travis peel off in pursuit, leaving
      the beat cop confused.  He calls after them--      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/109.
 

                                    BEAT COP
                    Hey!  Where're you going?!



      The teenager bangs into people on the crowded sidewalk.  We
      TRACK with him as he cuts across a street and weaves through
      traffic.  

    ON WES and TRAVIS, sprinting in pursuit.

                                    WES
                    He's headed for the apartments.

      Indeed, the teenager ducks into the entrance to a run-down
      building.  Travis calls out an audible as he pulls ahead--

                                      TRAVIS
                    '97 Packers!

                                    WES
                    Got it!

      Wes peels down an alley as Travis charges into--



      The teenager CRASHES through the glass and shoulder-rolls to
      his feet.  He grabs the ladder and rides it down--      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1010.
 



      The teenager lets go and drops, landing hard on the pavement. 
    He comes up to find--

      Wes.  He grabs the teenager.

                                    WES
                    Take it easy.  We just want to talk
                    to you.

      The teenager doubles over, exhausted.

                                      TEENAGER
                    I didn't do anything! 

      Travis jumps down from the fire escape ladder.

                                      TRAVIS
                    You killed a guy for his shoes. 

                                      TEENAGER
                    I didn't kill anyone.

                                    WES
                    No one thinks you did.

                                      TRAVIS
                    I do.

                                      TEENAGER
                    He was already dead.  

                                      TRAVIS
                    You know how many times we've heard
                    that one?

                                      TEENAGER
                    I swear.  I just took his shoes.

                                      TRAVIS
                    He's lying.  Let's shoot him.

      Travis reaches for his gun.  

                                    WES
                    Travis, you can't shoot him.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Why not?  He ran from a crime scene. 
                    He's wearing the victim's shoes. 
                    I'm betting after I shoot him, we
                    find more evidence on him.  And if
                    not, we'll plant evidence on him--      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1011.
 

      Travis checks his magazine.

                                      TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                    I'd better put in the untraceable
                    bullets...

      The teenager watches nervously as Travis starts switching
      out the bullets.  

                                      TEENAGER
                    All right!  I took his cellphone and
                    wallet.  He had no money...  

      The teenager pulls a CELLPHONE and a WALLET out of his pocket.

                                      TEENAGER (CONT'D)
                    You cops are worse than criminals.

                                    WES
                    Hey, don't lump me in with him.  

      Wes checks the cellphone.  The face is CRACKED.  He tries to
      turn it on, but--

                                    WES (CONT'D)
                    Looks like the cellphone's toast. 
                    Hopefully, ITC can pull some data
                    off it.   

    As Wes talks, Travis opens the wallet.  Inside, he finds an
    ID with a UNITED STATES SENATE SEAL on it.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Check this out.

      CLOSE ON ID:  Under the SENATE SEAL (an EAGLE grasping a
      U.S. FLAG), we see the VICTIM's photo and the typed words:

      "FAMILY OF SENATOR ROBERT MACCALLUM.  RELATIONSHIP:  SON"

                                    WES
                    Our John Doe is the son of a senator.

      Travis and Wes exchange a knowing look.

                                      TRAVIS
                    This is going to be all over the
                    news.  

                                    WES
                    Maybe your real mom will recognize
                    you on T.V. and finally try to contact
                    you.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1012.
 

                                      TRAVIS
                      "Biological mom" is the correct term. 
                    All of my moms are "real."

    As they continue to bicker we--

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


      TITLE CARD OVER BLACK SCREEN:

              "You may feel as though you know your partner
                quite well--maybe too well...but you'd be 
                      surprised at what you don't know."

                      --From Relationship Rescue, by Dr. Phil



      CAPT. PHIL SUTTON (50s, an ex-Marine) sits behind his desk. 
    We may notice he wears prayer beads on his wrist, and right
      now, something's burning on his desk...a cigar?

      Wes and Travis stand in his office.  They try to act like
      the smoke isn't bothering them.

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    This has got to be by-the-book.  The
                    D.A. can't have her detectives
                    objecting to each other's testimony
                    in court.

                                      TRAVIS
                    We're not like that anymore, Cap. 
                    Right, Wes?

                                    WES
                    Right.

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    Really?  Because I heard about your
                    session today.  Doesn't sound like
                    you two are making much progress.

                                    WES
                    Did Dr. Ryan tell you that?  Because
                    that's a violation of doctor-patient
                      confidentiality.

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    Wes, don't start in with your lawyer
                    crap.  You have no rights.  You lost 
                    them when you pulled your gun on
                    your partner. 

                                    WES
                    Travis has forgiven me for that. 
                    Why can't you?

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    Why do my two best detectives have
                    to be such a pain in the ass? 

                                    BETH (O.S.)
                    Are we interrupting something?      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1014.
 

      All heads turn to find Detectives BETH SANTANOVA (40s, butch)
      and NORA GOODEN (30s, lipstick lesbian) in the doorway.  

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    Yes, come in.

      They enter.  Nora waves the smoke from her face.  Travis and
      Wes exchange looks, realizing--

                                      TRAVIS
                    You're giving the case to Cagney and
                    Lacey?  

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    D.A. specifically requested them.

                                    BETH

                                      TRAVIS
                    This is sexual discrimination.

                                    NORA
                    Or maybe the D.A. just wants the
                    best two dicks in the department on
                    the case.

                                    WES
                          (to the captain)
                    So the D.A.'s running your department
                    now?  Did she tell you what to wear
                    today too?

      Wes is trying to get a rise out of him, but the captain is
      steely.

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    If you're trying to make me angry,
                    Mitchell, it's not going to work.  I
                    know my triggers.  I've evolved.  Unlike
                    you two.

                                      TRAVIS
                    How do you know if you don't give us
                    a chance to prove we've changed?

      That stops the captain.  He considers that point.

                                    WES
                    You know this is an election year. 

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    Exactly, and this case will either
                    make or break the D.A.'s campaign.        Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1015.
 

                                    WES
                    Oh.  So you want the D.A. fired. 
                    That's actually brilliant.  It's
                    like reverse psychology.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Although it's also classic passive-
                    aggressive behavior.  If you don't
                    like the D.A., you should just
                    confront her--

                                    NORA
                    --You guys are psycho-babbling
                      sociopaths, you know that?

                                      TRAVIS
                          (overly sincere)
                    Thank you for caring enough to share. 
                    My partner and I promise to weigh
                    your input carefully.

                                    NORA
                    Blow me.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Threat or invitation?

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    All right.  That's enough.
                          (to Wes and Travis)
                    I'm giving this case to you.  

      Wes and Travis grin.

                                      CAPT. SUTTON (CONT'D)
                    But not because you want it--because
                    you need it.  It's going to force
                    you two to take your counseling
                    seriously.  The D.A.'s itching to
                    have you two thrown in jail, so you'd
                    better start learning how to get
                    along.  

                                      WES/TRAVIS
                    We can do that./Deal.

                    Alright, alright.  No more negative
                    energy.  In fact, let's all smudge. 
                    Everyone take a breath.

      With that, the captain waves the smoke, closes his eyes and
      inhales deeply.  We realize now that he's burning sage.  

      The detectives inhale, pretending to go along.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

                    The Boy Scouts of America started
                    giving these things out in 1911 as
                    an award to the highest achieving
                    boy scouts...

      We're in--



      Wes's car snakes through a swarm of PRESS crowded outside
      the senator's gated mansion.



      Wes and Travis head back to Wes's car. 

                                      TRAVIS
                    Zach's on the run.

                                    WES
                    You don't know that.

                                      TRAVIS
                    We should call in an APB.

                                    WES
                    If we call in an APB, the press will
                    get wind, and Zach will be crucified
                    before he ever gets a chance to defend
                    himself.

                                      TRAVIS
                    OK, but we're going to look awfully
                    stupid when our prime suspect tweets
                    about his escape from the country.

                                    WES
                    I didn't say we shouldn't find him. 
                    I just said I don't want to make it
                    public.  Let's have ITC triangulate
                    Zach's cellphone signal.  And he's
                    not our prime suspect.  He's a
                    suspect, a person of interest.        Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1022.
 

                                      TRAVIS
                    Who got in a fight with the victim,
                    owned an Eagle Scout knife, and
                    conveniently disappeared.  You say,
                      "potay-toe" and I say, "potah-toe."

                                    WES
                    It's "tomay-toe" and "tomah-toe."

                                      TRAVIS
                    Whatever. 



      Wes's car pulls through the gates and up the long driveway
    to this swanky house in the Hollywood Hills.  

    As Wes and Travis park and climb out, the house owner and
      operator, VINCE WEST (early 30s), comes out to greet them
      with MARCUS (30s, corn-fed bruiser).  

                                    WES
                    Detectives Mitchell and Marks. 

      They flash their BADGES.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Who runs this place?

                                      VINCE
                    That'd be me.  Vince West.  This is
                    Marcus Hunter, the house security.

                                    WES
                    You both live here?

                                      VINCE
                    I do.  Marcus doesn't.

                                      MARCUS
                    I only get called in when there's
                    trouble with the residents.  I run
                    security for all the sober houses in
                    the area.  

                                      VINCE
                    I called Marcus as soon as I realized
                    Tobey was missing this morning.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Mind if we look around?      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1023.
 



      Wes and Travis head to Wes's car.  

                                    WES
                    It doesn't mean anything.  Emotions
                    run high in therapy sessions.  People
                    sometimes say things they don't mean. 

                                      TRAVIS
                    And people sometimes say exactly
                    what they mean.  Tobey was an
                      embarrassment to the family, and
                    Zach finally snapped. 

      Just then, Wes's phone RINGS.  He answers.

                                    WES
                          (into his phone)
                    Mitchell here...  Yeah?  We'll be
                    right there.

    He hangs up, turns to Travis.

                                    WES  (CONT'D)
                    They found Zach.

                                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

      SWIRLING EMERGENCY LIGHTS spin on top of RESCUE VEHICLES.

      Wes and Travis cut through the police cordon, showing their
      badges to a UNIFORM COP who lets them through.  We are in--



      Wes and Travis make their way into the lobby of a building.

                                      TRAVIS
                    It was almost too easy.  Brother
                    kills brother.  It's classic Cain
                    and Abel.  

                                    WES
                    You do realize how the law works,
                    don't you?  People are innocent until
                    proven guilty.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1025.
 

                                      TRAVIS
                    Remember that the next time you get
                    the urge to pull your gun on me for
                    doing something I didn't do.

      Wes and Travis enter the elevator...



      ...and exit the elevator onto a ROOFTOP.  L.A.F.D.,
      PARAMEDICS, and cops wait, tense.  

      Travis and Wes cross the roof and finally come to a stop. 
      CAMERA SWEEPS around, revealing the stunning city skyline in
      a panoramic ARC, and then lands on--

      A DESPERATE MAN (20s)

      Standing on the edge of the roof.  About to throw himself 30
      stories down to his death.  The center of all this attention.

      This is ZACH MACCALLUM.  He sees Wes and Travis approaching.

                                    ZACH
                          (edgy, upset)
                    Don't get any closer.  I'll jump!

      Wes and Travis stop.

                                      TRAVIS
                    You're not going to jump.

                                    WES
                    Good idea, Travis.  Dare him to jump.

                                      TRAVIS
                    If he was going to jump, he would
                    have already.

                                    ZACH
                    You don't know me!  You don't know
                    what I've done!  

                                      TRAVIS
                    We know exactly what you've done.

                                    WES
                    Maybe you should let me do the
                    talking.
                          (to Zach)
                    I'm Detective Wesley Mitchell--

                                      TRAVIS
                    --Maybe we should let him decide.        Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1026.
 

      Travis looks to Zach.

                                      TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                    Who do you want to talk to?  Me or
                    him?  I'm Detective Travis Marks.

                                    ZACH
                    I don't want to talk to either of
                    you!

                                      TRAVIS
                    Then, why haven't you jumped yet?

                                    WES
                    Will you shut up?

      Their approach confuses Zach.

                                    ZACH
                    I just wanted to tell my dad I'm
                    sorry first! 

                                    WES
                    Sorry for what?

                                    ZACH
                    My brother's dead because of me!  

      Zach looks down, more resolute than ever about jumping.

                                      TRAVIS
                    You should've picked a higher
                    building.  

                                    WES
                    Travis...

                                      TRAVIS
                    I'm just saying...you could live. 
                    You'd be a vegetable, but--

                                    ZACH
                    --I decided I'd rather talk to him.

      Zach gestures to Wes.  Wes shoots Travis a cocky look.

                                    WES
                    See?  He'd rather talk to me.

      Travis looks around, getting an idea.  He nods and peels
      off, disappearing down the roof access stairwell.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1027.
 

                                    WES (CONT'D)
                    Listen.  You can't jump.  Don't do
                    that to your father.  He'll never
                    get over it.  I know.

                                    ZACH
                    You don't know anything.

                                    WES
                    Trust me.  I do.



      Wes edges toward Zach.

                                    WES
                    Look.  Whatever you did, I'm sure
                    your father will forgive you.

                                    ZACH
                    We had a bond.  I should've trusted
                    him.  

                                    WES
                    Who?  

                                    ZACH
                    Tobey!  He said his ex-dealer was
                    going to kill him if he didn't pay
                    him back the $5,000 he owed him.  I
                    didn't believe him.  I thought Tobey
                    was gonna go buy drugs.  I should've
                    given him the money.  Now, he's dead,
                    and it's all my fault... 

      His voice trails off.  Full of despair.

                                    WES
                    So, you didn't kill Tobey?

      That stops Zach.

                                    ZACH
                    Of course, I didn't kill him.  He
                    was my brother.  I loved him.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1028.
 

                                    WES
                    An Eagle Scout knife was found at
                    the scene.  Was it yours?

      Zach reels, confused--

                                    WES (CONT'D)
                    We believe it was the murder weapon.

                                    ZACH
                    I gave my scout knife to Tobey when
                    he graduated rehab.  You gotta believe
                    me.  I didn't kill him.  

                                    WES
                    Well, if you jump, everyone's going
                    to think you did.

    ON ZACH.  Reconsidering, despondent but unsure.

                                    WES (CONT'D)
                    Come on.  Come down from there.  

      Wes takes a step toward him and holds out his hand. 

                                    WES (CONT'D)
                    Your father's had a bad enough day
                    already.

      Zach nods, finally giving in.  

                                    WES (CONT'D)
                    Give me your hand.

      But now that Zach's decided to live, the height is terrifying. 

      He's overcome by vertigo as he shifts his footing and turns
    to face the railing.  His foot slips--Zach DROPS!

      Wes hurries to the railing in horror to see Zach has only
      dropped a few feet into a WINDOW WASHING APPARATUS, which
      rises up, commandeered by Travis who wears a smug smile.

                                      TRAVIS
                    I get credit for this one.

                                    WES
                    You almost made him jump.  I talked
                    him down.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Doesn't look that way.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1029.
 

                                    WES
                    He slipped.
                          (to Zach)
                    Tell my partner you slipped.

      Zach just regards the guys, confused.

                                    ZACH
                    You're partners?



      A distraught Zach sits in an ambulance.  EMTs check him over
      while he talks to Wes and Travis.  

                                    WES
                    Can anyone corroborate that you gave
                    Tobey your knife?

                                    ZACH
                    No.  It was a private thing just
                    between us.  Tobey had always made
                    fun of me for being a Boy Scout, so
                    when he graduated rehab, I thought
                    I'd give it to him as a joke.  But
                    he was actually really proud of it. 

                                    WES
                    Any idea who Tobey's drug dealer was?

                                    ZACH
                    No, he would never tell us.  He was
                    afraid if our dad found out, he would
                    try to have him arrested and only
                    make things worse.

                                      TRAVIS
                    We're going to need to get your
                      fingerprints.

      Now, a SEDAN pulls up, and Senator MacCallum climbs out. 

                                    ZACH
                    Am I being arrested?

                                    WES
                    No.  But I suggest you get a lawyer.

      The senator rushes up to his son, and they embrace.

                                      SENATOR MACCALLUM
                    Oh, thank God.  I was so worried.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1030.
 



      Wes and Travis head back to Wes's car. 

                                      TRAVIS
                    Tobey's ex-drug dealer threatened to
                    kill him unless he pays him $5,000? 
                    I don't buy it.    

                                    WES
                    Agreed.  Not many drug dealers out
                    there selling their product on credit. 
                    But Tobey needed the money for
                    something.

      Wes chirps his car unlocked. 

                                      TRAVIS
                    Probably drugs.

      Travis opens the car door--CLUNK!  Wes instantly reacts.

                                    WES
                    Did you just ding my door?

                                      TRAVIS
                    No.

      Wes hurries over to inspect the door.  There is indeed a
      dent.  A tiny dent.

                                    WES
                    You did.  You dinged my door.  

                                      TRAVIS
                    That was already there.

                                    WES
                    It was not.  

                                      TRAVIS
                    You shouldn't park in compact spaces.

      Travis climbs in and slams the door closed on Wes.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      awards from their two years in better days as partners.  We

                    Are you still thinking about that?

                    It just happened.  

                                      TRAVIS (O.S.)
                    Hey, I offered to drive.

                    riding in your car.

    We WIDEN to reveal we're in--



      Wes and Travis stand in the car lot, watching as an EXOTIC
      SPORTS CAR rolls off a car carrier truck.

                                      TRAVIS
                    How much is that one?

                                    WES
                    Six-fifty.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Thousand?

                                    WES
                    It's a Swedish Koenigsegg CCX, third
                    fastest car in the world.

                                      TRAVIS
                    I'd rather keep the money and take
                    the bus.

                                    WES

      They turn to find a salesman (DOMINIC SANTORI) approaching.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1036.
 

                                      DOMINIC
                    ...to come in for six months.

                                    WES
                    I've been waiting for it my whole
                    life.

      Dominic grins and holds out his hand.

                                      DOMINIC
                    Dominic Santori.

      Wes shakes his hand.

                                      DOMINIC (CONT'D)
                    We got a black one inside.  It's
                    only a CCR, but it's a sweet ride if
                    you want to give it a whirl.

      Dominic gestures to another EXOTIC SPORTS CAR parked in the
      nearby showroom. 

                                    WES
                    I'd rather take this one out.

                                      DOMINIC
                    Sorry.  It's not street legal yet.
                    We gotta change out its smog system
                    first.  Federal law.

      Wes gives Travis a look, the short-hand of partners--

                                    WES
                    Right, because you can't drive it
                    with an illegal smog system.

      Travis catches on--

                                      TRAVIS
                    Right.  And we wouldn't want him to
                    break any laws.
                          (to Dominic)
                    So.  How much is this car without
                    all the drugs stuffed in it?

                                    WES
                          (annoyed)
                    Travis, I'll do my own negotiating.

      Dominic eyes the guys.

                    questions about Tobey MacCallum.

                                      DOMINIC
                    Never heard of him.

                                    WES
                    Then why did he call you seven times
                    the week before he was murdered. 

      Dominic pulls out his cellphone and punches in a number.

                                      DOMINIC
                    I'm calling my lawyer.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Did he owe you money?

      Dominic ignores him as he waits on his phone.  Travis pulls
      out his gun, but Dominic isn't scared.

                                      DOMINIC 
                    What're you going to do?  Shoot me?

                                      TRAVIS
                    Why not?  I have a gun.  I shoot bad
                    guys.  That's what I do.

                                    WES
                    He's not lying.  He does stupid things
                    all the time.  I'd answer his
                    questions if I were you.

                                      DOMINIC
                    I'm not answering anything.
                          (into his phone)
                    Hey, Larry.  It's Dom...

      Travis trains his gun on the Swedish import.

                                      TRAVIS 
                    The first question is easy.  Why was
                    Tobey calling you?

      Dominic forgets about his cellphone, suddenly more concerned
      about his expensive baby.

                                      DOMINIC
                    Whoa.  Hey!  That's a $700,000 car.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1038.
 

                                    WES
                    He doesn't care.  He'd rather ride
                    the bus.

                                      TRAVIS
                          (low, to Wes)
                    Is the smog system in the front or
                    the back?

                                    WES
                    Back.

      Travis turns his gun to the back-end of the car.

                                      DOMINIC
                          (into his phone)
                    I've got two cops down here...

                                    WES
                          (to Travis)
                    A little bit lower and to the left.

      Travis adjusts his aim.

                                      TRAVIS
                    I'm giving you one more chance.  Did
                    you threaten Tobey's life?

                                      DOMINIC
                          (to Travis)
                    My lawyer wants to know your badge
                    number.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Tell him it's 9-1-1.

      With that, Travis SHOOTS THE CAR--BLAM!  Wes winces.  Dominic
    is apoplectic, shouting into his cellphone.

                                      DOMINIC
                          (into his phone)
                    Crazy cop just shot my car!

                                    WES
                    Sir, please calm down.

      Travis kneels down to assess the damage--WHITE POWDER IS
      SPILLING OUT of the emissions.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Looks like it sprang a leak.

      Dominic looks under the car, sees the powder, and panics.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1039.
 

                                      DOMINIC
                          (into his phone)
                    I'll call you back.

    He closes his phone and turns to the cops.

                                      DOMINIC  (CONT'D)
                    Listen.  I won't press charges for
                    shooting my car if you just leave now.

    As they talk, Travis surreptitiously scoops up a sample of
      the powder and places it in a baggie.

                                    WES
                    It doesn't matter if you want to
                    press charges.  This is a crime scene
                    now.  We have to impound your car as
                    evidence.  I assure you my partner
                    will be prosecuted to the fullest--

                                      DOMINIC
                    --All right.  Fine.  I'll tell you
                    everything I know about Tobey if you
                    just forget about all of this.

      Travis and Wes consider that with a shrug.  OK.

                                    WES
                    How did you know Tobey?

                                      DOMINIC
                    I had nothing to do with his murder. 
                    I wasn't even in town.

                                    WES
                    Why was he calling you?

                                      DOMINIC
                    He needed money.  

                                      TRAVIS
                          (dubious)
                    He asked you for money?

                                    WES
                    Did he say what he needed it for?

                                      DOMINIC
                    No, but he seemed pretty strung-out. 
                    He kept looking back at the car he
                    rolled up in.  Someone was waiting
                    inside, but I couldn't see them--the
                    windows were tinted.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1040.
 

                                    WES
                    What kind of car?

                                      DOMINIC
                    A 1969 Pontiac GTO.  Black with gold
                    flames.  

                                    WES
                    You know your cars.

                                      DOMINIC
                    It's my business.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Did you give Tobey the money?

                                      DOMINIC
                    He's the son of a senator.  I figured
                    it'd be a good idea to have him in
                    my back pocket.  Tobey promised he'd
                    work it off washing cars.  

      The guys regard him, unsure.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Where were you last night?

                                      DOMINIC
                    I was at a car show all day yesterday
                    in Phoenix.  I didn't get home until
                    this morning.  You can check with
                    the airlines.

                                    WES
                    We'll do that.

      Wes and Travis turn to go.  Dominic nervously looks to his
      "leaking" car.

                                      DOMINIC
                    So, you're going to forget about all
                    this, right?

                                    WES
                    We're Homicide.  We don't care about
                    drug dealers.



      Wes and Travis head back to Wes's car parked across the
      street.  Wes pulls out his phone.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1041.
 

                                      TRAVIS
                          (sarcastic)
                    Once in a while it feels good to just
                    let the criminal walk.  Especially
                    when we have evidence and everything.

      Travis holds up the baggie of heroin.  Wes dials a number.

                                    WES
                    You shot his car.  That's illegal
                    search and seizure and a lawsuit.
                    We could never arrest him.

                                      TRAVIS
                    So we do nothing?

                                    WES
                          (into his phone)
                    Hey, Randi.  Santori's smuggling the
                    heroin in through his import cars'
                    emissions systems.  We got a sample
                    for your dogs.  They're gonna have a
                    field day...  You're welcome.

      With that, he hangs up.  Travis shrugs.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Sucks we won't get credit for that.



      A graveyard of dismantled and rusting automobile carcasses,
      stacked in rows.  Wes and Travis move down an aisle.

                                      TRAVIS
                    If Tobey's drug dealer owns a classic
                    muscle car, then this is where he'd
                    get the parts.

                                    WES
                    Unless he's heard of eBay.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Ever tried shipping an engine block?

      They hear a footstep.  They both wheel around as--

      A DOZEN MEN ARMED WITH SHOTGUNS and BASEBALL BATS emerge
      from the shadows, leveling their guns at Wes and Travis. 

                                    WES
                    Whoa-whoa-whoa!  Don't shoot!      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1042.
 

      Wes and Travis put their hands up.  Nobody lowers their guns. 
      One scar-faced MAN speaks.

                                      SCARFACE
                    This is private property. 

                                      TRAVIS
                    We're looking for Fat Man.

      Scarface eyes him, wary.

                                      SCARFACE
                    Who's looking?

                                      TRAVIS
                    T-Bone.

      Scarface signals one of his men who peels off and disappears
      into a garage.  Wes gives Travis a side-glance.

                                    WES
                    "T-Bone"?

      The garage door opens, and out steps a huge SAMOAN MAN. 
      He's heavily inked with traditional tattoos.  He sees Travis
      and brightens.

                                    FAT MAN
                    T-Bone!

                                      TRAVIS
                    Fat Man!

                                    FAT MAN
                    My name is Fuamatu-Ma'afala, dickweed.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Watch that mouth, or I'm telling
                    momma.

                                    FAT MAN
                    Momma always said you were a snitch.

      Fat Man pulls Travis into a bear hug.  Everyone watches,
      confused, shotguns still drawn.

                                    FAT MAN (CONT'D)
                    Put your guns down.  This is my foster
                    brother.

      The henchmen all lower their guns.  Fat Man eyes Wes.

                                    FAT MAN (CONT'D)
                    Who's this?      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1043.
 

                                      TRAVIS
                    That's Wes.  He's my partner.

                                    FAT MAN
                          (incredulous)
                    You're gay?

                                      TRAVIS
                    No.  I'm a cop.

      The henchmen all reach for their guns again, but Travis stops
      them with--  

                                      TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                          (quickly)
                    We're just looking for a car.



      Wes and Travis head down the sidewalk in this low-rent part
    of town.  Bars on the windows.  They come to--



      A small clapboard bungalow.  A car sits parked in the
      driveway, covered by a car cover.  Travis lifts the cover.  
      It's indeed the black GTO with gold flames.

      They share a look.  They draw their guns and split up.

    ON TRAVIS as he quietly walks to the back of the house.

    ON WES.  He moves forward.  Up the porch steps.  Suddenly,
    he hears the sound of a SHOTGUN RACK--CLACK-CLICK!  

      Wes SLAMS himself against the wall.  Ready for a gunshot.

      Silence.  Then he hears the SHOTGUN RACK again--CLACK-CLICK.
      Then again--CLACK-CLICK.

      Wes can't figure it out.  He raises his weapon.  He leaps
      out, SPINS and AIMS at the screen door, yelling--

                                    WES
                    L.A.P.D.!  FREEZE!

      THROUGH THE SCREEN DOOR, we reveal--

      A NEWBORN BABY swinging back and forth in a cheap ROCKER
      with a broken hinge.  With each motion, the hinge creaks
      CLACK-CLICK.  The baby GURGLES.

      OFF Wes, lowering his weapon...



      The skyscrapers of Century City hang as a backdrop to this
      quaint neighborhood.  Wes stands on the front walk of a white-
      picket-fence house, watering the lawn.

      A LEXUS pulls up, and out climbs a stunning and sophisticated
      WOMAN (30s).  She's wearing a wool-skirted business suit. 
      This is ALEX MCFARLAND.  She sees Wes and sighs.

                                    ALEX
                    What are you doing here?

                                    WES
                    The St. Augustine needs fertilizer.

      Alex moves to the trunk of her car and pops it open.

                                    ALEX
                    You need to get your own lawn.

                                    WES
                    This is my lawn.

      She pulls a briefcase and a box of files out of her trunk. 
      Wes turns off the hose and moves to help her.

                                    ALEX
                    I only agreed to share custody of it
                    because I assumed you'd have your
                    own place by now.  

                                    WES
                    I'm looking.  



      A BEATER pulls in, and Travis climbs out with a SOCCER BALL. 
    He heads to a motel room, passing a MOUSY HISPANIC MAID (20s,
      full-figured) pushing a cleaning cart.  This is LUNA.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Hey, Luna!

      She turns, and Travis tosses her the ball.  She catches it.

                                    LUNA
                    What is this?

                                      TRAVIS
                          (in Spanish, subtitled)
                    A present for your son.  You said he
                    wants to play soccer this year.

      Luna regards the present, touched.

                                    LUNA
                    Grac as.

                                      TRAVIS
                    De nada!

    He heads off.  Luna calls after him. 

                                    LUNA
                    There's a lady waiting for you in
                    your room.  I let her in.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Is she pretty?      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1054.
 

                                    LUNA
                    The ones who come looking for you
                    always are.

      Travis grins.  That's what he wanted to hear.  He continues
      on.  Luna watches him go.  She clearly has a crush on him,
      but she's too shy to act on it.



      Residents work in the garden.  Wes and Travis stand over
      Vince and Gretchen who are planting a row of flowers.

                                      VINCE
                    Well, Tobey didn't get it from anyone
                    here.  Marcus conducts random
                    searches.  Residents here aren't
                    even allowed to have cold medicine.
                          (then)
                    Can you hand me the hydrangea?

      Vince points to the wheelbarrow filled with various flowers. 

                                    WES
                    I wouldn't plant the hydrangea there. 
                    It'll give the bamboo white flies. 
                    Plant these.

      Wes hands a couple of potted plants to Vince.  As Vince
      reaches for them, Travis notices TWO CRUDE PRISON TATTOOS on
      Vince's arm.

                                      TRAVIS
                    You did time in prison?

                                      VINCE
                    Two stints for possession--a real
                    motivator to stay sober.  



      Wes and Travis head to Wes's car.  

                                      TRAVIS
                    Any other ideas where Tobey might've
                    gotten the heroin?      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1060.
 

                                    WES
                    None of it makes sense.  If Tobey
                    was using again, Irene would've known.  

                                      TRAVIS
                    What?  You still think someone
                    forcibly injected a heroin addict
                    and then stabbed him?  

                                    WES
                    Yeah, that doesn't make sense either.  

                                      TRAVIS
                    And yet, you still think Zach is
                    innocent.

                                    WES
                    No, I'm just not sure he's guilty. 

      Travis's phone buzzes.  He checks a text message.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Really?  Because Ellen just texted
                    that Zach's fingerprint matched the
                    print on the knife.



      A CRUSH OF REPORTERS descends on Wes and Travis as they climb
      out of Wes's car.  The guys push through the throng of
      REPORTERS, which includes Cindy Lu.  

                                      CINDY LU
                    Detective Marks!  Is it true Zach
                    MacCallum is a suspect in his
                    brother's murder?

      She shoves the microphone in their faces.

                                    WES
                    No comment!

      Travis and Cindy exchange a look as Wes and Travis slip into
      the building.  Wes doesn't miss it.



      The REPORTERS mob LAURA GOTTESMAN (50s, would rather win
      cases than make friends) as she climbs out of her SUV.  A

      Wes yells through the motel room door.

                                    WES
                    I got a new lead on Tobey MacCallum's
                    murderer.

                                      TRAVIS (O.S.)
                    We broke up, remember?      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1072.
 

      INTERCUT WES and TRAVIS.  Travis returns to his business
      with Ellen.  

                                    WES
                    I need your help!

      That stops Travis mid-grope.  He looks to Ellen.

                                      TRAVIS
                    What did he just say?

                                      ELLEN
                          (irked)
                    I don't know.  I wasn't paying
                    attention.

      Travis calls to the door.

                                      TRAVIS
                    What did you just say?!

                                    WES
                    I need your help!

      Curious, Travis gets up, but Ellen stops him.

                                      ELLEN
                    Travis, it's our two-week anniversary. 
                    You promised.

      She seductively pulls down the straps of her dress.  Unable
    to resist, Travis grabs her.  They fall onto the bed.

                                    WES (O.S.)
                    Tobey was dyslexic!

      That stops Travis again.  He rises and crosses to the door.

                                      ELLEN
                    If you open that door, I'm leaving,
                    and I swear I'm not coming back.

      Travis stands at the closed door, weighing his options.

                                    WES (O.S.)
                    I think he transposed the digits in
                    that disconnected telephone number.

      Now, Travis finally opens the door, revealing Wes.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Now look who's starved for attention.

      Ellen grabs her purse and pushes past them.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1073.
 

                                      ELLEN
                          (to Travis)
                    I hope Wes embroidered your name on
                    his new black panties for you.

      With that, she leaves.  Travis watches her go, crushed by
        what-could-have-been.  He turns to Wes.

                                      TRAVIS
                    She had my name embroidered on her
                    new panties.

                                    WES
                    You were about to break up with her
                    anyway.

                                      TRAVIS
                    I was not.

                                    WES
                    It's been two weeks.  You've never
                    dated any girl longer than two weeks.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Yes, I have.

                                    WES
                    Who?

      Travis considers that, realizing--

                                      TRAVIS
                    Ellen was starting to hint about
                    moving in together.

                                    WES
                    You see?  I did you a favor.

      Travis grabs his shoes and starts putting them on.

                                      TRAVIS
                    For the record, I didn't leak anything
                    to the press.

                                    WES
                    I know.  Cindy Lu's bi.

                                      TRAVIS
                          (surprised)
                    Really?  

                                    WES
                    Or maybe she just is when she wants
                    info.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1074.
 

                                      TRAVIS
                          (kicking himself)
                    I can't believe I passed that up.

                                    WES
                    Come on.  We need to borrow Randi's
                    dog.

    As they head to Wes's car--

                                      TRAVIS
                    Why?

                                    WES
                    I had ITC run the number through all
                    combinations of digits, then cross-
                    referenced those with currently
                    working numbers.  Guess what number
                    came up?  Marcus Hunter.

                                      TRAVIS
                    The guy who runs security for the
                    sober house? 

                                    WES
                    Irene said Tobey couldn't stand anyone
                    doing drugs around him.

                                      TRAVIS
                          (catching on)
                    Tobey caught someone using at the
                    sober house and tried to call Marcus
                    to report them.

                                    WES
                    But he got killed before he could.

                                      TRAVIS
                    We should call Marcus.

                                    WES
                    Already did.  He's meeting us at the
                    sober house.



      Travis and Wes lead Randi's K-9, Hudson, out of the gate.

                                    WES
                    Shouldn't we knock on the door and
                    ask Randi if this is OK?      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1075.
 

                                      TRAVIS
                    It's not gonna be OK.  She never lets
                    anyone borrow her dog, especially me.

      Hudson wags his tail, happy to see Travis.  Hudson licks his
      face.  Travis eats it up.

                                      TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                          (in baby talk to Hudson)
                    She was always jealous of us, wasn't
                    she?



      The residents and Wes emerge from the house to see the Sober
      House van speeding down the driveway!  Not far behind--

      Wes's car gives chase. In the driver's seat is Travis.  Wes
      sprints after his car as it speeds by.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1077.
 



      Travis and Wes are in pursuit of Vince in the van.  They
      round a corner at top speed.



      Vince's van blows through a red light, narrowly missing
      several cars, which crash all around him. 



      Both cars come to a crashing stop, shattering glass and
      crumpling metal. 

      Vince staggers out of his wrecked van and makes a break for
      it, but Travis jumps out too, tackles him to the ground, and
      slaps on handcuffs.

                                      TRAVIS
                    You're under arrest.

    It takes Wes longer to get out of the passenger side.  The
      door finally opens and FALLS OFF.  Wes surveys the damage. 
      Smoke streams from the hood.  Wes gapes, heartbroken.  

                                      TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                    You okay?

                                    WES
                    I don't want to talk about it.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Look.  If it'll make you feel any
                    better...I'm sorry I dinged your car
                    door before.



      Wes and Travis examine more Luminol bloodstains inside the
      the back of the wrecked van.  Captain Sutton and Laura are
      here now too.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1080.
 

                                    WES
                    We're awaiting confirmation, but
                    we're fairly confident the chemical
                      fingerprint of the heroin found in
                    Tobey's system will match that found
                    hidden in Vince's room.

      Laura watches as Vince is loaded into a police car.

                                      LAURA
                    I guess I have to go face the press
                    now and tell them I made a mistake.

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    That's a very bad idea.  Let me help
                    you.

                                      LAURA
                          (suspicious)
                    Why would you want to do that?

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    Because you're a good D.A., and I
                    want you to win this election.  So
                    here's what you say--

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      CLOSE ON LAURA, who gives a statement to the crowd of PRESS.

                                      LAURA
                    ...And so we had Detectives Beth

                    decoy arrest of Zach MacCallum...

    We WIDEN to reveal we're on--



      The media crowds the steps to the jail.

                    West into a false sense of security
                    so that Detectives Wes Mitchell and
                    Travis Marks could gather further
                    evidence without constraint.  I want
                    to applaud the fine work of the
                    detectives--

      But suddenly there's a commotion as the jailhouse doors
      finally open.  All heads turn as ZACH WALKS OUT with his
      father.  Cameras FLASH!  The senator hugs his son.        Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1081.
 

    As Wes watches the emotional reunion, he absently touches
      his Saint Christopher's necklace.

      After a long hug, Zach moves to the podium and addresses the
      media.

                    My brother battled addiction for
                    most of his life, but for the last
                    two months, he was clean.  He had
                    not relapsed as had been rumored.  I
                    was guilty of believing it myself. 
                    I realize now that my brother tried
                    to do the right thing and lost his
                    life for it.  Tobey MacCallum was a
                    hero.  I am proud of him.  And I
                    love him.

      More FLASHES as the media swarms him.  We--
