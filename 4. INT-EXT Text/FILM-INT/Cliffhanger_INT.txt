sweating, panting, awake. It hasn't been that long since the
accident -- a year, to be exact -- but he looks older. He
looks as if he's watched Susan Collins drop at least one
hundred times. Gabe reels himself in as a STEWARDESS hands him
a glass of water.
STEWARDESS
Take this.
(Gabe does)
Afraid of flying?
Gabe shakes his head.
GABE
Falling.
Gabe, with no luggage, is at the small airport's only car
rental counter, doing the paperwork for a RENTAL AGENT.
RENTAL AGENT
Midsize?
GABE
Any size, any color, any model.
RENTAL AGENT
How long will you be needing it?
GABE
(flat)
Just under six hours.
MAGGIE (O.S.)
You aren't wasting any time, are you?
Gabe turns and looks at
MAGGIE
who is standing off to the side.
MAGGIE
I knew you'd be coming by. Today.
Gabe's happy to see her -- but at the same time, he isn't.
She looks too good -- and she brings up quite a mixed bag of
memories. Maggie carves on a smile.
MAGGIE
If you're in that much of a hurry, why
don't you ride with me?
Maggie pilots the copter, heading out toward the mountain
range. Gabe fiddles with some of the equipment inside. Both
grope for a way to start the conversation.
GABE
This is new...
MAGGIE
It's a thermal scope -- picks up body
heat of lost hikers --
Gabe flicks it on, looks at the total absence of heat as they
fly over the snow.
GABE
Still find the dead ones the old
fashioned way, I guess.
So much for small talk. Gabe is clearly uneasy watching these
mountains go by. Maggie breaks an awkward silence --
MAGGIE
You could have said goodbye.
GABE
(shakes head)
If I did, I'd have to listen to you
tell me one more time that it wasn't
my fault.
MAGGIE
(angry)
Today -- especially today -- you get
to hear it again. The harness clip
broke.
Cold stress -- one in a
million equipment failure. You and
Hal could have checked it from then
till now and it still would have
happened.
(beat)
You did everything right --
GABE
-- If I did everything right, Susan
Collins would still be alive.
THE HELICOPTER
whizzes on to the Ranger station -- a small building by an old
country road. Not much activity outside of some ROOKIE
CLIMBERS working out on a CLIMBING PRACTICE WALL. Maggie
starts to land the copter, and as she does --
INSIDE THE COPTER
GABE
Do you really believe all that?
That
it wasn't our fault?
Maggie slows the rotor, her eyes on the controls. Gabe's eyes
are locked on her.
MAGGIE
(turns to Gabe)
Yes. Yes, I do.
But she answered a half beat too slow. The helicopter touches
ground.
GABE
I'm not sure what I wish more, Maggie.
That you meant what you said, just now
-- or that it were really true then.
The Southwest regional center for printing and distributing
currency. Hundreds of troops stand guard over the impressive
U.S. Treasury complex.
is at work -- the ROAR of its parts is deafening as it stamps
out a plate design on huge sheets of paper -- we move in on
THE PAPER
which is moved by mechanical arm to a SLICER that razors the
bills apart -- it's moving too fast for us to see the
denomination -- the cut bills are separated by --
FOUR SEPARATION CHUTES
that fire the bills down to a mechanical COUNTER that
serializes, counts, bands and stacks them faster than any
human could -- a HAND reaches to pick up a band --
THE BILLS
are something a banker could work a lifetime without seeing,
but are real nonetheless --
$5,000 bills, banded here in
hundreds. The band is put back in the growing stack by
RICHARD TRAVERS
mid-thirties, a tough, imposing Treasury agent -- he regards
the fortune piling up in front of him with only cold,
professional interest. Travers is flanked by a trio of equally
tough TREASURY AGENTS -- he turns to flunky DAVIS (20s). It's
clear who's in charge of protecting the money here, and who's
in charge of counting it.
TRAVERS
Tell Wright the San Francisco shipment
is ready.
DAVID
(phone already out)
Right away, Mr. Travers.
As Davis dials we move to --
THE OFFICE
of WALTER WRIGHT (50s), comptroller of currency -- his
demeanor suggests he's in control, and used to keeping it that
way.
WRIGHT
(into phone)
Good -- good. I'll be right down.
As Wright gets up from his desk, though, we hear in the outer
office --
SECRETARY (O.S.)
You can't go in there --
MATHESON (O.S.)
Watch me.
KURT MATHESON (30s) bursts into the office, trailed by
Wright's flustered SECRETARY.
MATHESON
Walter Wright?
(flashes badge)
Matheson. FBI. We need to talk.
PRINTING COMPOUND - THE MONEY
has now been packed into a trio of metal briefcases -- ten
thousand $5,000 bills. Travers shuts the cases in turn, and
locks each with an electronic key card, triggering a FLASHING
RED LIGHT on the locks as he does. A uniformed PILOT shows up
behind Travers as he cuffs the cases to the hands of the three
other agents.
PILOT
We'll be fueled and ready in ten
minutes, Mr. Travers.
TRAVERS
(an order)
Be ready in five.
MATHESON (O.S.)
Go ahead and take ten. We'll need the
time.
Travers looks up at Matheson, who has just arrived with
Wright. Travers is instantly furious at the challenge to his
authority.
MATHESON
(flashes badge)
Matheson. FBI.
TRAVERS
(looking down at it)
Your parents must be proud.
(to Wright)
What the fuck is this about?
WRIGHT
Small problem with the shipment,
Travers.
(to Matheson)
Tell him what you just told me.
Matheson draws out a file and hands it to Travers.
MATHESON
We got word that somebody's been
observing your currency shipments --
this load, the $5,000s -- over the
last three deliveries.
TRAVERS
(laughs)
There isn't a hell of a lot anyone can
do but observe.
(beat)
This is the most protected shipment
we've got -- and the most useless for
a thief. Those bills aren't in
circulation. You think five thousand
dollar bills are easy to pass? Who the
fuck would try?
Matheson hands Travers a folder.
MATHESON
This guy might.
We look over Travers' shoulder at the photos, which are all
blurry, all blown up from different surveillance pictures --
and all of them show ERIC QUALEN.
TRAVERS
Who is he?
MATHERS
(patient)
His name's Eric Qualen. One of the
East German spies who got shut out by
the reunification. The CIA issued an
inter-agency warning about him right
after the wall came down. He's got
nowhere to go and nothing to lose.
He's also got the international
connections to get rid of bills like
these -- and he's probably desperate
enough to try for them. Fifty million
bucks buys a lot of sanctuary.
TRAVERS
Could you get to the part where I'm
supposed to care?
MATHESON
(shows him more photos)
We had two agents monitoring him.
These two -- Gleason and Quinones.
Their last report said he was going to
try to take this shipment.
TRAVERS
(turning away)
Thanks for the tip. But I've got work
to do.
MATHESON
(stopping him)
Did I say "last" report? I think I
did. I mean last fucking report.
These guys have vanished.
TRAVERS
You have my sympathy, but --
(exasperated)
There's a reason we do things this
way, all right? Armored cars can be
hijacked. Trains can be derailed. But
nobody can get to us in flight. The
only time this is on the ground is at
the mint, or on the Presidio runway in
San Francisco. Either way, someone
would have to shoot his way past a
couple of thousand guards.
Matheson still isn't convinced.
TRAVERS
If you're worried about an inside job,
forget it. I checked the plane from
top to bottom an hour ago. And these
three are my best against. Even if one
of them did go skydiving, they
wouldn't get far. Each case has an
electronic tracer with a range of one
hundred miles.
Travers pulls a tracking device about the size of a watchman
out of his jacket pocket. The small screen shows three red
blips at rest -- matching the three currency cases.
TRAVERS
(facing down Matheson)
I haven't lost a bill in eight years.
And I'm not scrubbing this shipment
because you scare easily.
MATHESON
(an easy smile)
Who said anything about stopping the
shipment?
(beat)
I've been tracking Qualen for almost a
year. If he pulls something, I want to
be in on the party.
Travers, angry, turns to Wright. Wright clearly doesn't like
this either, but is resigned to it.
WRIGHT
This is cleared from the top, Travers.
Matheson will accompany you on the
flight to San Francisco.
(beat)
Show him every professional courtesy.
Travers turns back to a smiling Matheson, looking like he'd
rather kill him instead, as we --
CUT TO:
We can hear Maggie's helicopter flying off overhead -- camped
inside the cave are BRETT and EVAN, both 20s, both shivering,
amid their gear -- backpacks, cooking stuff -- and parachutes.
These are Colorado rock jocks -- thrillseekers who'll try
anything if the odds are strong enough they'll die in the
process.
EVAN
(freezing)
Way to check the weather, Brett.
BRETT
(shivering yet macho)
Hey. If it were easy, it wouldn't be
worth d-doing.
CUT TO:
who looks tense -- we MOVE AROUND the cabin and find two more
relaxed Treasury agents are dozing on the opposite side of the
plane, their arms chained to the currency cases. Matheson is
edgy. Another AGENT offers some condescending reassurance.
AGENT
Just enjoy the view, huh?
(Matheson says nothing)
Relax. I mean, what could happen in
the air?
Matheson turns back to his window and looks down --
WINDOW POV - THE GROUND BELOW
is covered with snow -- the jet's shadow moves sleekly and
plainly over it. But after a moment we see -- -- another
jet's shadow on the ground, coming up fast!
INSIDE THE DC-9 - MATHESON
reacts this and shifts his look upward to --
WINDOW POV - ANOTHER PLANE (GULFSTREAM)
is flying a parallel course to the Treasury jet, and is just
one hundred yards away. Close enough to see Eric Qualen's face
in one of the windows.
INSIDE THE PLANE
Matheson stands -- Travers has noticed the plane by now too,
and gets out of his seat as the other agents react.
TRAVERS
(to other agents)
Stay put! Don't panic, goddammit!
Travers moves into
THE COCKPIT
where the pilot seems nervous, but oddly, not frightened.
PILOT
He's coming in too slow.
TRAVERS
(cool)
No -- we're going too fast, and we're
too high up. Push flaps forward twenty
degrees and drop to five thousand
feet.
THE CABIN
Matheson is out of his seat, pistol drawn. Seems a little puny
under the circumstances.
MATHESON
(to agent)
You got any rifles?
AGENT
Forward compartment -- left side --
Matheson rushes through a curtain to the area between the
cabin and the cockpit and pulls open a closet door. To his
horror, he finds inside not rifles, but
TWO DEAD BODIES
who we'll recognize as the missing FBI agents from the photos
Matheson showed Travers.
MATHESON
backs up in horror -- and he sees Travers calmly coming out of
the cockpit. Rattled, Matheson pulls his gun on Travers.
Travers looks dumbfounded -- then angry.
TRAVERS
What the hell are you doing --
MATHESON
Checked the plane from top to bottom,
huh? You fucker --
(clicks hammer back)
Put your hands behind your head! It's
over!
Travers puts his hands out and walks forward -- slowly,
backing Matheson into the cabin. Not in surrender, but as if
he's calming a nutcase. The other agents see this and don't
know which way to jump.
TRAVERS
Calm down -- give the gun to me --
MATHESON
(to other agents)
There's a couple of dead bodies in the
front compartment -- they're FBI
agents --
TRAVERS
He's losing it --
They now think Matheson is crazy too -- he looks nuts -- the
other agents move behind him. Matheson gets even more frantic
and point his gun at them.
MATHESON
Goddamn it! Don't you see what he's
doing! He's hijacking the fucking
shipment!
(back to Travers)
Don't make me shoot you!
The other two agents get behind Matheson and rapidly disarm
him. Travers pulls out his gun with a slow, leisurely move.
TRAVERS
Don't make me laugh.
Travers FIRES his gun three times, one for each agent's
chest -- the agents are cut down, realizing too late what's
happened. A fourth SHOT knocks Matheson over a seat as if he'd
been kicked. Travers puts his gun away and puts on a radio
headset as he goes to a window.
TRAVERS
(to mouthpiece)
Move into position.
Gabe looks out the window at the countryside he used to belong
in. He's wondering if he still does.
CUT TO:
-- Qualen, who is also wearing a headset radio and is wired
to a safety line in the jet. He's lowering a thick steel cable
down to the Treasury jet.
Qualen is as deadly as advertised -- 150 mph winds are tearing
at him through the open door, but he is unfazed and
unfrightened.
TRAVERS
is also wired to a safety line by his own jet's open door.
TRAVERS
(into radio)
More -- more -- keep it coming --
THE TWO PLANES
Qualen's jet lowers the cable into the Treasury jet -- it
looks like an Air Force midair refuelling -- difficult and
dangerous. After about thirty feet of line is lowered --
TRAVERS
-- takes it in and clips it to a ring at the top of the jet's
doorway.
TRAVERS
(into radio)
Locked on. Move into lateral position.
INSIDE QUALEN'S PLANE
The pilot, KRISTEL, is a woman. Her skill, like her hard
beauty, can be measured in a glance: she's a lot calmer than
her counterpart in the Treasury plane.
KRISTEL
Moving into lateral position.
ON THE TWO PLANES
Qualen's jet lowers itself, banking to the side -- the
Treasury jet raises itself. Both are now flying side by side,
with the cable serving as a thirty foot bridge.
TREASURY JET CABIN
Travers, unclipped from his safety line, cautiously goes to
the cockpit. The pilot, nervous, struggles with the controls.
PILOT
We're right on the edge of the
storm -- let's move it.
Travers pulls the two dead FBI agents out of the
compartment -- one is dressed in a flying suit like the pilot,
one in a suit like Travers.
PILOT
This isn't going to work -- Wright
will suspect something.
TRAVERS
So what. He'll sift though a plane
that went down in a storm --
(gestures to bodies)
-- find enough pulverized bone for six
men heroically killed in the line of
duty --
(finds three suitcases)
-- and just enough of the right kind
of ash.
Travers opens one of the cases, which is identical to the
others -- except that it's full of one dollar bills. He's
thought of everything.
TRAVERS
We get twenty-one gun funerals and
they write off fifty million. It's
perfect, as long as you hold the plane
steady -- so concentrate.
Travers moves back into the cabin.
INSIDE QUALEN'S JET
We can now see four other passengers. All are fit and armed --
HELDON and RYAN are seated, while KYNETTE and DELMER, ready to
help with the transfer, are on the opposite side of the door
from a very impatient Qualen.
QUALEN
(into radio)
Travers -- hurry it up.
INSIDE TREASURY JET
Travers, now in a harness like the one seen earlier -- uncuffs
the money cases from the agents.
TRAVERS
(into radio)
On my way.
Travers steps back into the cockpit and flips a toggle switch
over and LED --
THE LED
starts counting down from 2:00 -- 1:59 -- 1:58 --
IN THE COCKPIT
Even in the last minute, the storm's gotten worse -- the plane
is flying right into the blackest center of it. The pilot
looks more panicked than ever.
TRAVERS
That charge is going to blow both
engines -- the plane'll go down like a
rock, so clip yourself on to the end
of the cable with the money as soon as
I get over.
(an afterthought)
And make sure you bring the right
cases.
Travers heads back into the cabin and hooks his harness to the
cable between the planes.
TRAVERS
(into the headset)
Dip the plane. I'm coming over.
THE JETS - LONG SHOT
Qualen's jet dips down so there's a sharp incline -- Travers
starts the slide down, zipping in seconds across into
QUALEN'S JET
where he's pulled in and unclipped by Qualen.
QUALEN
(shouting over the wind)
Why didn't you send the money over?
TRAVERS
(shouting too)
Somehow, I didn't think you'd have
waited for me if I'd sent it first.
Qualen smiles in reply. No. Maybe he wouldn't.
IN THE TREASURY PLANE COCKPIT
The pilot locks the controls and rushes back to the cabin.
THE LED
counts down -- 0:38 -- 0:37 -- 0:38 --
IN THE TREASURY PLANE CABIN
The pilot gathers the cases and uses their cuffs to attach
them to the cable -- but as he steps past the bodies of --
THE AGENTS
Matheson's eyes open -- he's not dead yet.
IN THE CABIN
The pilot clicks the last of the three cases onto the cable
and is about to put his harness on -- but behind him, Matheson
shakily crawls to his feet, draws his gun, and SHOOTS the
pilot in the back twice.
THE PILOT
drops out of the plane, flailing -- if he's screaming, we
can't hear it over the HOWLING of the storm --
IN QUALEN'S JET
Qualen and Travers are watching the whole plan unravel --
TRAVERS
(shouting to cockpit)
Get underneath the jet! The cases will
slide over!
THE JETS - LONG SHOT
Qualen's jet sharply dips down and the cases start to slide
over -- but at the same time --
INSIDE THE TREASURY JET
Matheson, groggy, holds onto the doorway and FIRES a full clip
from his automatic at Qualen's jet -- and
THE LED
counts down -- 0:02 -- 0:01 -- 0:00 -- and
THE TREASURY JET'S ENGINES
are destroyed as the charge DETONATES --
THE JETS - LONG SHOT
As promised, the Treasury jet is now plummetting as if it had
no wings at all, levelling the angle between the planes -- the
cases dangle precariously on the wire --
INSIDE QUALEN'S JET
TRAVERS
(shouting)
Lower! Get underneath it!
INSIDE TREASURY JET
Matheson struggles to the cockpit and gets behind the controls
-- as if that's going to do any good --
THE JETS - LONG SHOT
Qualen's jet is deliberately racing the disabled Treasury jet
down, but it's hopeless -- there's no way to get underneath
the falling jet long enough for the cases to slide over.
INSIDE QUALEN'S JET - KRISTEL
isn't quite panicked. Yet.
KRISTEL
It's dragging us down! Disconnect the
cable!
Heldon and Ryan try to do just that, but the cable is
taut -- there's no way to loosen the clip on the door --
BOTH JETS
dive down faster at an ever steeper angle, over the edge of
the Colorado mountain range --
INSIDE THE TREASURY JET
-- the clip on the door finally breaks --
BOTH JETS - LONG SHOT
-- the Treasury jet drops as Qualen's jet, trailing the cable
and the money, sharply shoots upward --
THE TREASURY JET
makes a one point landing nose first into the wilderness,
cartwheeling into a FIREBALL!
The sound of the EXPLOSION, muffled in the wind, far-off, but
audible, drives Hal outside -- he's alert, but can't see
anything in the murk of the storm --
levels off the plane, but it's still in trouble --
CABIN - QUALEN AND TRAVERS
struggle to reel in the cable, because --
CLOSE ON THE CABLE
The money cases are still, barely, holding on, the cuffs
caught on the broken clip at the end --
QUALEN AND TRAVERS
aren't even bothering with the electric winch, they're
dragging it in hand over hand -- but --
CLOSE ON THE CABLE
-- the cases, torn by the wind, work their way loose one at a
time and drop -- one -- two -- three -- into the snowy
mountains below!
IN THE CABIN
Heldon and Ryan clamp the door shut as Qualen angrily attacks
Travers --
THE COCKPIT - KRISTEL
tries to bring the plane up, but can't -- the fuel guage
needle is dropping fast --
INSERT - THE WING
is pouring out fuel through a dozen bullet holes -- one of two
engines sputters to a stop.
THE COCKPIT - KRISTEL POV
The plane is now just skirting the mountain tops, and is still
being battered by storm winds -- Kristel aims it for what
looks like the flattest, longest mountain top --
THE CABIN
Kynette and Ryan grab Qualen and Travers to separate them --
all strap in, because
THE PLANE
is going down -- it just tops the edge of a precipice and hits
the ground level --
THE MOUNTAIN TOP - LONG SHOT
-- the problem is, the ground itself isn't level, it tilts
down towards another edge five hundred yards distant -- if the
plane keeps skidding, it'll go over the edge --
THE PLANE
sleds down at an angle, skipping over rocks -- -- through
trees --
-- tearing off a wing --
THE COCKPIT
Kristel rides the stick only out of habit -- nothing she does
is going to matter now --
INSIDE THE CABIN
The men are jolted around -- windows IMPLODE as Kynette tries
to protect a bag of what is obviously explosives --
THE PLANE
rips downhill through a wooded area like a runaway train --
-- the second wing is sheared off by trees --
COCKPIT POV - THE OPPOSITE EDGE
is coming up fast -- but
THE PLANE
wrenches to a sudden halt, the fuselage intact.
WIDER VIEW - THE PLANE
or what's left of it has stopped several feet short of the
edge -- we can see why: the steel cable, trailing from the
cargo door, has lashed itself around a half dozen trees,
acting as a tripwire to stop the plane.
INSIDE THE PLANE
Quiet. All are dazed but, outside of superficial cuts,
unhurt. Kristel moves out of the cockpit, looking around.
KRISTEL
So much for phase one.
(to Travers)
Now what?
She speaks for all of them -- especially a still-seething
Qualen. Travers pulls out the tracer monitor for the cases.
The tracer screen shows three distinct blips -- the tracers
have survived the fall.
TRAVERS
Now -- we call the police.
Hal, agitated, paces in the main office -- Frank, unconcerned,
puts a coat hanger and some aluminum foil on a little TV to
drag in the fading signal of a Broncos game.
HAL
Look -- I know there's a storm, but
that wasn't thunder.
FRANK
(unconcerned)
Hal, when you've been in this line as
long as I have --
The station's scanner radio barks to life.
KRISTEL (O.S.)
(panicky)
Mayday -- mayday -- downed DC-3 --
mayday --
Hal runs to the radio and keys the mike.
HAL
Rocky Mountain Rescue -- come in,

Kristel is on the radio, as Travers and Qualen hang back.
Kristel's voice is panicked but she can't suppress a grin.

Dead silence. The transmission cuts off/
HAL
Mayday -- come in, mayday --
Kristel hangs up the radio and smiles, Travers and Qualen
standing behind her. Qualen lightly applauds.
QUALEN
Not bad. The insulin was a nice touch.
A knock on the door brings no response -- no one inside. Gabe
opens the unlocked door -- and steps inside.
GABE
Maggie?
No answer. Gabe takes a look around the living room. His face
tells us, without a doubt, this used to be his home. Gabe
moves inside, pausing at a mantle. Two framed photos -- Gabe
and Maggie sleeping together in a hammock, bolted to a sheer
wall over a 2,000 foot drop. Gabe, Hal and Maggie, all
younger, all sporting drunken grins, in a mountain cave.
Gabe
smiles for the first time today at this memory -- a BANGING at
the back of the cabin shakes him out of it.
Not a storage shed at all -- it's a small workspace that
offers solid protection from the elements, is well-lit, and
whistle-clean. Maggie, in front of a table, pulls a cover off.
A LARGE PLASTIC CAGE
-- inside is a bald eagle. One of maybe 2,000 left in the
country. Its uneven feathering and small, gawky size tells us
it isn't nearly full grown. A bandage on its side tells us
it's been injured. Maggie's smile tells us it's healing.
MAGGIE
Hey there --
The door to the shed opens -- Gabe steps in, and shuts the
door behind him. Maggie looks surprised to see him. Gabe just
looks awkward.
GABE
Hi.
(beat)
Could you introduce us?
MAGGIE
Sure. Gabe Walker -- this is A27.
A27 -- Gabe.
GABE
Not the tag -- what do you call
him?
MAGGIE
Her. I call her Lucky.
GABE
(bends down, eyes wound)
Poachers?
(Maggie nods)
Bastards...
MAGGIE
They got the mother -- and left this
one behind. Too small to make a decent
trophy, I guess.
GABE
About four months, right?
(Maggie nods)
Christ -- it must have been just about
his -- I mean her -- first flight --
MAGGIE
Time to change the dressing.
Maggie pulls on a pair of pair of cowhide gloves.
GABE
You can't do that alone --
MAGGIE
I've had to learn. She trust me --
Maggie reaches into the cage, but the eagle starts thrashing.
GABE
I'm making her nervous --
(beat)
You hold her, I'll do the dressing.
Gabe finds another pair of gloves, sterile cotton pads and
alcohol in a drawer -- Maggie reaches in and grabs the eagle's
beak and talons quickly but gently, and takes it out of the
cage, holding it firm. This is clearly something they've done
many times before. They move together, tight -- Gabe and
Maggie both react to this bit of close contact as they bandage
the eagle. It's getting warmer in here. Gabe reaches down and
yanks off the patch. The eagle thrashes as Gabe cleans the
wound.
GABE
Got some fight in her -- that's good.
(beat)
What happened to Dave?
MAGGIE
The usual. Flew off -- never calls,
never writes --
Gabe winces at this one as he carefully tapes the small patch
and sticks it on the eagle's side. Maggie puts the eagle back
in the cage and closes the top door. Gabe and Maggie don't
move any further apart as they pull their gloves off. Gabe
tentatively reaches for Maggie's face -- but she pushes him
hand away.
MAGGIE
I'm glad to see you, Gabe. But I kind
of wish you hadn't come. I was almost
used to you being gone.
(beat, quiet)
Why are you here?
GABE
(pauses)
I thought I came back to see if I'd
learned to live with it. Well, big
surprise. Coming back just tore me
open all over again, like it all
happened yesterday instead of a year
ago. Nothing's changed. Including the
way I feel about you.
(beat)
I didn't realize it till I saw you at
the airport. But I came back for you,
Maggie.
MAGGIE
Does that mean you're going to stay?
GABE
No. Not here.
(beat)
I want you come with me. Start over,
somewhere else.
MAGGIE
(incredulous)
You come back after being gone a year,
and you expect me to --
(beat)
You don't live here any more, Gabe.
Your choice, remember? But this is
my home. I'm not leaving. You can
stay with me, or you can go alone.
It's still your choice.
HAL (O.S.)
Now there's an easy call.
Standing in the shed's doorway is Hal. Stone faced. Grim.
OUTSIDE SHED
Furious, Gabe heads out after Hal.
GABE
What the hell do you want?
HAL
(beat)
I need your help. A plane's gone down
on Comb Bluff. This storm would blow
a copter all over the place -- but we
can climb up to it.
GABE
"We"?
(beat)
Talk to somebody who's still on the
payroll. You've got a half dozen new
guys --
HAL
-- who couldn't climb that wall now if
there were stairs cut into it. But
you've soloed it.
GABE
During the summer. On a bet.
HAL
This is a little more important than a
bet. Just a few injured people with
no first aid or shelter, camping in a
zero degree blizzard. They'll be ice
sculptures by tomorrow morning.
GABE
(shakes his head)
Maybe you missed the headlines -- but
I don't do rescues any more. They're
bad for my conscience.
(beat)
Fuck this one up on your own.
Gabe walks past Hal. Furious, Hal spins Gabe around.
HAL
Play it again, Gabe, about how we
killed her. I was there too, remember?
GABE
(hot)
Not like I was, pal -- her fingers
brushed mine on the way down --
HAL
(right back)
-- and I was the one who had to deal
with her family when you fucking tore
out of town.
(takes a breath)
We lost her. Whatever anybody says
about cold stress and the clip, you
and I have to live with that. But
right now, there are some more people
who need our help, and they shouldn't
die too just because you've got a
problem keeping the past in the past.
Gabe knows he's right. But he's hesitant. And scared.
GABE
I don't want the responsibility.
HAL
Walk away and you are responsible.
They'll die. I can't do this alone.
(Gabe slows but doesn't
stop)
You know what else, Gabe? You can go
anywhere you want, but if you don't do
this, now, you're going to be stuck on
that goddamn ledge for the rest of
your life.
Gabe turns. Sees Maggie in the doorway. She's heard every
word. Gabe turns to Hal -- hesitates -- and nods.
Maggie is on the phone, pacing, as Frank is slumped in front
of the radio scanner. Suddenly, the radio comes to life.
HAL (O.S.)
-- Come in, Rescue Unit -- over --
Maggie bolts over to the radio before Frank can react.
MAGGIE
(keying mike)
Rescue Unit -- what's going on,
Hall? -- over --
Maggie looks out the window. The station's windspeed gauge is
flying around so fast it looks like it might take off.
MAGGIE
Acknowledged. Let me talk to Gabe --
over --
HAL (O.S.)
(hesitates)
You can't. He's taking care of
passengers. Just like I should be.
Over and out.
Maggie leans back in the chair, looks out at the storm, and
tries not to worry. She fails miserably.
Wright's pacing around, trying to figure out what in his
office he should break first. Davis shows up at the door.
WRIGHT
(furious)
Okay -- I know it's not in San
Francisco. I know it's not here. I
know it's not in any fucking airport
from here to Montana. Where it's
not - we got that covered. Now, do
you have any ideas on where it is?
DAVIS
(walking to a map)
There's no radio contact, sir. At all.
We're not receiving the tracer signal
from the cockpit's flight recorder.
Radar lost it after it went low here.
He points to a huge part of Colorado. Hundreds of square
miles.
DAVIS
We have to assume it went down in the
storm.
WRIGHT
Air search?
DAVIS
(shakes head)
That storm hasn't quit yet. Weather
service says we've got it until
tomorrow morning at least. Even if we
could get a plane up now, it'd be
impossible to see anything on the
ground. And --
Wright slumps into a chair.
WRIGHT
-- The roads are shut down, right?
DAVIS
Most of this area doesn't even have
roads.
WRIGHT
(rubs his eyes)
Keep two copters on full standby. And
let me know the second that storm
starts to wind down.
CUT TO:
is just a small "point of interest" shed for hardy tourists
who have hiked up this far -- there is a corny photo stand,
where you stick your head through a hole, so your face is put
on top of a cartoon climber hacking up a mountain. Gabe rushes
past this to a glass display case on the wall.
THE GORDON DOUGLAS DISPLAY
has black and white photos of a square jawed 1930s climber
with his expedition -- more important is what's beneath it.
Douglas' original climbing equipment -- a coil of rope, some
pitons, a hat, a cloth backpack, small binoculars, other odds
and ends. Gabe prepares to smash the glass -- and hesitates.
Respect.
GABE
(sighing)
Sorry, Gordon -- I promise I'll have
it back tomorrow.
Gabe SMASHES the glass as we move to --
The expedition has holed up here for the night -- Travers and
Qualen look upset. Things aren't going as well as they'd
hoped. Kristel tries to get some candy out of a vending
machine that's obviously empty. Kynette saws at some camp food
with a distinctive knife -- the handle is a set of brass
knuckles. Delmer guards Hal, who is bound, and seated by the
souvenir photo stand.
HAL
Well -- look at the bright side.
(beat)
At least you've only got to make the
split five ways now.
Gabe takes the now cooked rat carcass -- properly skinned and
butchered -- off his knife blade. We can see from flickering
shadows that a small fire is now burning in a cave -- we
pull back to see
THE FIRE
which is built out of small bundles of $5,000 bills. It's safe
to say that something like $500,000 is going up in smoke, and
the fire's dying down. Gabe tosses a fresh band of bills on
the flame. Gabe cools the knife in some snow, saws off a rat
leg, and chews unhappily.
GABE
(mouth full)
Mmm. Just like -- chicken.
Gabe sparingly washes the bite down with a taste of Jack
Daniel. It's going to have to last him. He has an entire rat
to get through.
DISSOLVE TO:
Very quiet in here. Frank is snoring, slumped over the radio.
Maggie is wide awake and obviously hasn't slept -- her
attention is fixed out the window.
MAGGIE'S POV - WINDSPEED GAUGE
The gauge is still flying around, but clearly shows that the
winds are slowing.
Wright is coiled at his desk, tense. Ten empty styrofoam
coffee cups -- and dark rings under Wright's eyes -- make
clear he hasn't slept. Wright's assistant bursts in.
DAVIS
We've got a fix on the plane, sir --
we're getting a reading on the flight
recorder tracer --
WRIGHT
Any visual? Any radio contact?
DAVIS
Not yet --
WRIGHT
(heading to the door)
Get the copters ready. We take off in
three minutes.
DAVIS
The winds are still too strong --
WRIGHT
Sorry to hear it. We're still going.
The plane might be intact.
Wright drags the protesting Davis out the door.
DAVIS
Sir --
WRIGHT
Shut up. That fifty million isn't
coming out of my pension.
Gabe is sweating, straining in the dark, climbing up -- this'd
be a good spot to pull back and take in the view, except --
THE CHIMNEY
-- there's nowhere to pull back to. There's about two inches
of clearance between Gabe's chest and the rock, and about the
same between his back and the rock. To the right, there is no
light. At all. To the left, there's no light. Even above,
there is no light, because the crack isn't straight -- nature
isn't that obliging -- it zig-zags up. Gabe is well within the
mountain rock. Nothing could be closer to being buried alive
Gabe snakes through a spot where the crack goes straight up --
he takes out his penlight and turns it on --
GABE'S POV - INSIDE THE CRACK AROUND HIM
even this dim light reveals scores of bats hanging on the
wall, surrounding him, up and down, left and right --
GABE'S FACE
is stuck somewhere between nausea and the realization that
he's made a big mistake.
GABE
I didn't need to see that. I really
didn't.
Gabe cuts the light and slithers up through the dark.
Gabe has a quick climbing rhythm now. He pulls himself up with
his hands, then braces his body with his back, and pulls
himself up again -- he's not looking up, because he can't see
anything yet anyway -- naturally, this leads to --
A head and rock collision. Gabe's head crashes against a new
part of the crack, as the passage thins out. He gropes up.
The passage is narrowing to the point that he can't get
through it. Dead end.
GABE
Should've taken that left turn at
Albequerque.
Gabe backs down, and starts to slide across the side. With
his back wedged against the rear wall, he uses his feet to
push against the forward wall.
GABE'S POV - BLACK
Zero visibility -- Gabe can't see what he's shoving toward.
There has never been light of any kind in here.
GABE
blindly pushes to the side, rattled by the difficulty of doing
this in the dark.
GABE
It's just like any other side move --
you can't see where the fuck you're
going, that's all --
Gabe stops and fishes out his penlight. Turning it on, it's
clear those batteries haven't gotten any more potent in the
last few hours. Gabe shines it to the side.
GABE'S POV - THE LIGHT
is fading fast. A match's last gasp is brighter.
GABE
exasperated, puts the penlight in his mouth and moves on.
GABE
(garbled)
Much better.
Gabe inches on to the side. Looks up to see if the crack has
gotten wider. It hasn't. Gabe mumbles something phonetically
near "motherfucker" around the flashlight, aiming it up --
GABE'S POV - UP
No opening larger than a mail slot --
GABE
still cursing, still looking up, still moving to the side --
he gets the opening he wants, but not where he wants it --
The crack suddenly, drastically widens as he moves to the
side -- since he's been bracing his back against the wall,
Gabe falls out of control, twisting around, face down --
Gabe bounces down the walls for several yards and catches
himself by bracing his arms and legs against the crack. It's
now five feet wide as he painfully brakes himself --
GABE'S POV - THE PENLIGHT
falls out of Gabe's mouth and tumbles down, ping-ponging from
one side of the crack to the other as it tumbles a long, long
way down -- even after the light is gone, we can still hear
the penlight's receding clattering against the walls --
GABE
is now, literally, in a jam. There are no handholds, no
ledges, and the walls are slick. All he can do is remain
braced against the crack's walls until his already sore arms
and legs give out.
Gabe is just as we left him. Face down, arms and legs pressing
against the five-foot gap of the tunnel walls.
Carefully, Gabe takes one hand off the wall, gets out his
lighter with the other, and ignites it for a look --
GABE'S POV - UPWARD
Just as the crack has widened below him -- it's wider above
him. More important, it slants at an easy enough angle to
allow him to walk up. If only he can get up there.
GABE
snaps the lighter shut, pockets it, and readies himself.
Gabe steadily "walks" up the vertical passage by bracing
himself with one leg and one arm -- then moving the other
leg and arm up.
Gabe repeats this until he has his hands on the curved edge
where the crack snakes into a sideways passage. But there are
no handholds that will allow Gabe to get a grip and simply
swing over and climb up.
GABE
(winded)
So much for the easy part.
OVERHEAD ANGLE - THE CRACK
Gabe takes a deep breath, readies himself, and shoves himself
away from the wall with his arms, pushes himself into a squat
against the opposite wall, hanging for a second with no
support at all, and he springs from that all into
THE DIAGONAL PASSAGE
Gabe lands hard but flat on the passage and immediately starts
backsliding into the drop, but he digs in with his boots and
his hands. Safe at last. Gabe carefully stands in a crouch --
and starts heading up.
Gabe moves up through the diagonal section -- the crack is
starting to go directly upward. Gabe looks up --
GABE'S POV - TOP OF THE CRACK
It's coated with snow, but not too much -- Gabe can faintly
make out light shining through up there.
GABE
knows the top is twenty feet away. Gabe starts up the easy
segment, his back braced against one wall.
Gabe, wedged near the top of the crack, is ready to dig
through the snow -- but he hears the sound, muffled and
distant, of Kynette talking. Gabe strains to hear -- a bad
time to come up? Might be.
The radio is reading Gabe loud, if not clear -- the
interference of solid rock is garbling it. But we can see out
the window that Frank is now between radios, carefully
hauling Evan's body from the helicopter to the station on a
collapsible gurney. No one else is in the station.
GABE (O.S.)
(over radio, broken up)
-- Come in, Frank --
Gabe, exasperated, stops for a moment.
GABE
Is there anybody else on the radio?
Maggie shakes her head no.
GABE
I take a year off and the department
goes to hell.
(keys it)
-- Come in, Rescue Unit --
TOP OF BUTTRESS - HIGH ANGLE
We can see there are three holes punched in the snow along the
crack's top --
CLOSER ON ONE OF THE HOLES
Recognizably the part of the crack Gabe and Maggie dove
into -- but perched on the edge is a block of plastic
explosive -- the detonator LED races down -- 0:20 -- 0:19 --
A SECOND HOLE
has been punched in the snow at the center point of the
crevice's top -- another bomb has been planted there --
A THIRD HOLE
at the opposite end of the crevice has a third timer tied to
a third pack of plastics --
Gabe and Maggie cautiously move along a single ledge --
finally, some light can be seen, thirty feet ahead, as they
round a corner.
GABE
(smiling)
Come on -- we're almost out.
The crack narrows, and Gabe straddles it, putting his feet on
the opposite edge to walk faster. But before he can go on --
A HAND
grabs one of Gabe's ankles from below and yanks him down --
Gabe tumbles painfully, braking himself in front of
KYNETTE
bruised and bloody, who has survived the earlier fall and made
his way out. His look is not a forgiving one.
KYNETTE
Miss me?
Kynette smashes Gabe's face with a devastating, brass-knuckled
punch --
GABE
falls back, desperately grabbing at the walls to stop himself
from going all the way down -- as he weakly tries to get up --
KYNETTE
calmly opens his knife, and re-laces his fingers into its
brass-knuckle handle.
TOWER FACE
The gang and Hal watch the mountain top, with very different
expectations and hopes -- their vantage point keeps them from
seeing where the crack actually comes out.
QUALEN
(looks to Hal)
You might say a few words for your
friends -- this is the one that will
bury them.
BOMB NUMBER TWO - INSERT
Ready to blow -- 0:10 -- 0:09 --
IN THE CRACK - MAGGIE
can only look down helplessly at
GABE AND KYNETTE
fighting -- Gabe is on his feet, but Kynette, slashing at him
with his knife, is forcing Gabe to back up -- the crack is
getting wider, and finding footholds while crab-walking
backwards in the dark isn't east.
Gabe's in a rotten fighting position -- as he has to spread
his feet out wider as he backs up, he's always lower than
Kynette.
Gabe throws a punch at Kynette's stomach, but there's no power
to it. Kynette hits Gabe with a brutal knuckle-duster punch --
Gabe flies back several feet, somehow managing to straddle the
crack walls -- which are now four feet apart. Kynette moves in
for the kill.
BOMB NUMBER TWO - INSERT
The LED counts down -- 0:02 -- 0:01 -- 0:00 -- but doesn't
detonate. A green light starts flashing, but the bomb hasn't
gone off.
IN THE CRACK/CHIMNEY
Kynette moves in over Gabe and swings down with the knife --
But Gabe grabs his knife hand, and adding his own force to the
swing, imbeds the knife to the hilt in the rock wall,
trapping Kynette's hand in the brass-knuckle handle.
Gabe stabilizes himself on Kynette's trapped arm and gets a
little payback -- three solid roundhouse punches to Kynette's
face -- he then climbs up his pinned opponent, stepping up
on Kynette's stuck hand as if it were a piton.
TOWER FACE
Qualen's smirk is wiped off his face. The bomb didn't work?
TRAVERS
What happened?
QUALEN
I'm not sure -- I set the timer --
Qualen gestures helplessly, putting the radio in Hal's reach.
Hal takes advantage of this, throws off Travers, and grabs the
radio.
HAL
(keying radio)
Gabe, it's a dud --
But the second Hal transmits --
BOMB NUMBER TWO
detonates over the central part of the crevice, and as
promised, it's even bigger than the first --
INSIDE THE CRACK
The bomb instantly blasts tons of rock down the crevice --
GABE AND MAGGIE
The RUMBLE of the approaching rockslide is unmistakable --
Gabe shoves Maggie forward --
GABE
Move!
Maggie doesn't have to be told twice -- she and Gabe move out
the narrowed crack quickly, but under the circumstances,
this "running" looks damn slow --
KYNETTE
struggles with the stuck knife as the cave-in knocks him off
the wall and buries him instantly --
GABE AND MAGGIE
cover the last ten feet, shoved forward by an airburst from
the giant explosion -- they make it to the crack's edge at
last, but on the
OUTSIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN
Gabe and Maggie still have to cling desperately to the sheer
wall -- the airburst has turned the crack into a wind
tunnel -- it's as if the mountain were trying to blow them
out.
TOWER FACE
Hal, shocked, stares at the enormity of the explosion. Qualen
looks serenely satisfied.
QUALEN
When I was seventeen, I was a sentry
on the East Berlin boundary.
There was a problem, then -- too many
defectors were managing to sneak
through the wilderness to the west. A
man would take them through, every
night of every week -- a man like your
friend.
(beat)
He had quite a sense of humor. Every
time he got someone through, he'd
radio us at midnight to let us know
how many. "Five tonight." "Eight
more have been freed tonight." No one
could find the route. It made me look
bad.
(beat)
I looked day and night and finally I
found it. A tunnel. I didn't tell me
superiors. I put a charge there, with
a timer to trigger a radio receiver on
the detonator. At midnight. Our friend
made his radio report, and I heard him
say "seven" before the explosion.
(beat)
They pulled eight bodies out of the
tunnel, and I was promoted to
intelligence the next day.
Hal, stunned, looks at the radio, realizing Qualen tricked
him into detonating the bomb. Travers, grinning, takes the
radio from Hal and pats him on the back.
TRAVERS
Thanks. We couldn't have killed him
without you.
GABE AND MAGGIE - ON THE WALL
The force of the airburst, as brief as it is strong, is over.
Dust slowly swirls out -- Gabe and Maggie raise their heads.
Gabe looks back -- the crack is now sealed off. Gabe takes a
piton and hammer from his belt and hands it to Maggie along
with the rope.
GABE
Knock this in the side. Make it firm.
Maggie does as Gabe takes the binoculars out, and climbs out
on a slim toehold so he can look up the wall.
GABE'S POV - UP THE WALL
Gabe whips the binoculars up to the top edge of the wall. It's
blurry -- Gabe focuses the binoculars on -- the third
bomb, visible on the mountain's edge. The LED counts down,
but it's partly obscured. All Gabe can see is the seconds, not
the minutes, that remain -- :42 -- :41 --
GABE (O.S.)
Bad news. There's another bomb up
there. We've got to move quick.
Gabe scans methodically but rapidly down the rock below. All
smooth. Until -- Gabe swings the binoculars back. There's a
lip ninety feet below, leading into the wall. A cave.
GABE (O.S.)
Good news. There's a cave down there.
GABE
puts away the binoculars and swings back to Maggie -- she lets
the length of rope drop. It's thirty feet long. Not even
almost long enough to get to the shelter. Gabe leans against
the crack wall, drained. Now what?
HELICOPTER - MOVING OVER MOUNTAINS
Frank is in the air, heading back out toward the range,
frantically working the radio.
FRANK
Maggie -- come in, Maggie, this is
Rescue One --
TOWER FACE
Frank's call is heard on the radio. Travers takes it, and
takes charge.
TRAVERS
There's our ride out of here. Everyone
out of sight -- except you, Kristel.
(hands her radio)
Make the distress call. You're so good
at it.
All scramble up towards the clearing.
INSERT - THE THIRD BOMB
We can see what Gabe couldn't -- the timer has about two
minutes left -- 1:59 -- 1:58 --
GABE AND MAGGIE - AT THE CRACK'S EDGE
Gabe looks completely defeated. Can't go up. Can't go back in.
Can't go down.
MAGGIE
(frantic)
What are we going to do?
GABE
(defeated)
Die. I'm sorry, Maggie. I'm sorry you
got into this.
Gabe and Maggie fuse together in a tight embrace -- a final
embrace. But Gabe opens his eyes as the rope, still in
Maggie's hand, brushes his cheek. The end is frayed.
Gabe's eyes light up. Inspiration. Gabe breaks off the embrace
and snatches the rope from her -- he pulls at the end and
furiously starts unravelling it.
MAGGIE
What are you doing?
Frank is practically there, heading toward the buttress and
the facing Tower.
FRANK
(over radio)
Come in, Maggie, over --
KRISTEL (O.S.)
(over radio -- "weak")
Alpha Charlie Niner -- please --
help --
Frank recognizes the pilot's voice from the "distress call".
FRANK
(over radio)
I copy, Charlie Niner -- what's your
position -- over --
An aerial flare fires up, leaving a clear marker.
FRANK
(over radio)
Sit tight, Charlie Niner -- I'm right
on top of you.
GABE AND MAGGIE - AT THE CRACK'S EDGE
Gabe is still unravelling the rope fiber -- it's three
different segments wound together. The helicopter flies
overhead -- and past.
MAGGIE
(shouting, waving)
Frank! Down here! Frank!
GABE
Forget about it. He can't hear you.
(hands Maggie some rope)
Tie these together. Tight.
MAGGIE
(realizing)
-- Are you out of your mind --
GABE
This is rope from the Gordon exhibit.
The way guys climbed then, they'd tie
on three at a time -- this rope'll
take around nine hundred pounds.
MAGGIE
Gabe -- this rope is sixty years old
--
GABE
(misses the point)
Yeah, they made it pretty good then.
Each of these strands ought to hold
about 300 pounds before snapping.
Gabe rapidly ties the rope to the piton -- Maggie works on the
third connecting knot as she does the mental calculation of
what she and Gabe weigh together.
MAGGIE
(dazed)
Ought to. About.
(beat)
Will it hold?
Gabe takes the line from her and lets it drop. Ninety feet of
what looks like twine.
GABE
Depends on how big a breakfast you
had. You want to go first?
Maggie's stunned -- but there's no choice. She starts the
rappel down, and Gabe is close behind.
INSERT - THE THIRD BOMB
is ready to blow -- 0:12 -- 0:11 --
MAGGIE AND GABE - RAPPELLING DOWN
To make this even trickier, they have to swing over to the
side about fifteen feet to get to the cave -- meaning they
have to move down in pendulum type swings that put even more
pressure on
THE ROPE
which looks sorely tested at one knot -- it's coming undone --
MAGGIE AND GABE - RAPPELLING
They swing down lower -- twenty feet to the cave, four
thousand to the ground --
INSERT - THE BOMB
-- 0:04 -- 0:03 --
MAGGIE AND GABE - RAPPELLING
They reach the end of the rope -- six feet above the cave
and fifteen feet away laterally.
GABE
(shouting)
Swing towards it -- and drop!
Maggie nods -- they start the swing over -- as they get over
the cave's lip --
THE ROPE
snaps --
MAGGIE AND GABE
fall, landing roughly on the cave's narrow lip -- Gabe
starts to slip over, but Maggie pulls him back as --
ABOVE ON THE WALL
The bomb detonates and starts raining debris -- an instant,
massive rockslide --
MAGGIE AND GABE
dive into the small cave as the rockslide tumbles past --
exhausted, they collapse on the cave floor.
THE HELICOPTER - OVER THE TOWER
Frank, obviously, is surprised by the nearby explosion.
FRANK
What the fuck --
But he sees Kristel in a clearing. Face down in the snow.
First things first.
Dust from the rockslide is drifting past the cave opening, but
the worst is over. Gabe rolls Maggie over carefully.
GABE
Are you okay?
MAGGIE
My ears are ringing -- but I'm all
right. Gabe, what's going on?
GABE
(shows money in his pack)
This. That plane crash -- it's a half
dozen guys who were smart enough to
steal fifty million bucks, but dumb
enough to drop it all over the range.
They've got Hal as a bird dog -- and
right now they're heading for the rest
of it.
MAGGIE
Where?
GABE
It's close to the lake -- Hal's
probably leading them on the slowest
possible route down to it.
(stiffly gets up)
I can get there first -- all I have to
do is make it along the north wall to
the Bitker ladder --
MAGGIE
"All?" Jesus, Gabe -- what do you
expect to do then?
GABE
(aching)
Something -- subtle.
Gabe lurches towards the cave opening, looking more like
Quasimodo than a champion climber. Maggie stops him.
MAGGIE
I'm going with you.
GABE
No way. You're climbing back down --
try to get to the station or find some
help.
MAGGIE
I'm just as good a climber as you
are -- and right now, I'm definitely
in better shape.
GABE
(hard)
And you're definitely not going --
Maggie stares Gabe down. Guess who won all the arguments when
they were together. Gabe's face is a portrait of familiar
exasperation.
GABE
Okay. Come on --
As they move out of the cave together, Gabe favors one foot.
GABE
-- but the second you slow me down,
I'm leaving --
(slips on sore leg,
Maggie catches him)
-- I'm leaving you behind. Understood?
MAGGIE
(helping Gabe out)
Anything you say, Gabe.
is slogging uphill after his own tracer blip -- which is
turning back around and heading towards him. Qualen aims his
gun and waits, but at the top of the hill --
THE RABBIT
that spooked Gabe earlier sticks its head up for a curious
sniff. It has the tracer fastened to its neck with a currency
band. Furious, Qualen FIRES at the rabbit -- it safely speeds
away as Qualen smashes the useless tracer monitor and turns
around.
-- Travers, who has been shaken to the opposite side of the
copter, reaches into his jacket and pulls out the pistol he
took from Frank -- he aims at Gabe --
INSERT - THE HELICOPTER SKID
One of the two rungs holding the copter up bursts --
THE HELICOPTER
slips, now hanging from just a single rung -- -- and the
impact of the slip makes Travers drop the gun -- it falls out
the open passenger door. Travers scrambles up through the
cabin to go after -- -- Gabe, who is trying to get off the
helicopter and onto a solid part of the ladder before the
whole thing goes down --
Gabe jumps for the wall as
Travers scrambles behind him and --
CLOSE ON THE HELICOPTER SKID
-- as the last rung supporting the copter snaps in two --
GABE
grabs hold of the ladder as
THE HELICOPTER
plummets down -- but as it starts its fall --
TRAVERS
leaps from the falling copter and grabs Gabe's leg -- Gabe
struggles to support both of them, but Travers, weakened from
his wound, loses his grip on Gabe's leg -- he stares up in
terror at Gabe as he clutches Gabe's snow-slick boot --
GABE
Cheer up. It's a beautiful spot to
die.
Travers slides off and away --
THE FALL - LONG SHOT
Travers SCREAMING as he free falls, trailing behind the
helicopter -- we follow the entire four thousand foot drop --
-- until the helicopter explodes when it hits the ground far
below, and the fireball engulfs Travers just before he
impacts into the explosion!
GABE
looks down at the burning wreck and clings to the ladder,
closing his eyes for a moment in exhaustion. But the WHOPPING
of another helicopter makes him look up --
THE TREASURY HELICOPTER
has shown up, a little too late to be of any help.
INSIDE THE TREASURY COPTER
Wright, Davis and Stuart look at the billowing flames of the
wreck -- even from here, the burning money is visible,
drifting up in the smoke. Wright turns to Stuart.
WRIGHT
I'm no expert -- but what do you make
of that "event"?
GABE
is drained -- from somewhere, he finds the strength to lift
his head up --
GABE'S POV - THE WALL
The section of ladder above him, of course, is gone -- he has
to cover the fifty feet of wall above him by free climbing.
There are holds that look easy enough for him, but --
GABE
leans back, gripping the ladder, too tired to move. Just the
thought of one more climb drains him.
GABE
(mumbling)
Forget it. No fucking way. I'm staying
right here. I've spent the night on
walls before -- some of the best
nights of my life have been spent
lashed to walls --
Before Gabe can take this any farther -- a loop tied to the
end of a rope falls to a stop next to him. Gabe looks up --
ON THE EDGE - HAL
has thrown the line down. Maggie is by his side.
HAL
Remember -- keep your arms and legs in
the vehicle at all times --
GABE
puts the loop around himself and tightens it by rote -- even
this action aches.
GABE
(too tired to shout)
Fuck you --
Hal and Maggie draw Gabe up -- Gabe pulls some of his weight
by using hand and foot holds, but when he reaches
THE PRECIPICE EDGE
Hal and Maggie are both winded from the effort as they haul
Gabe onto the top. Gabe unties himself, and collapses into
Maggie's lap.
HAL
(winded, coiling the
rope)
Jesus Christ -- you think you could
have put a little less effort into
that climb? I mean, what have you done
for me -- lately?
Hal ends his harrangue and looks over -- Gabe has apparently
revived, because he and Maggie are locked in the kiss of their
lives. Hal stands, and smiles -- he walks toward the Treasury
agents, who are scrambling out of the helicopter. Hal starts
an explanation that's going to take a long, long time as --
GABE AND MAGGIE
break off their kiss.
MAGGIE
Does this mean you're staying?
Off Gabe's answering smile, we --
FADE OUT.
