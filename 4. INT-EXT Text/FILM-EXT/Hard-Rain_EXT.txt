Storefronts are sandbagged and closed. A sign on one store
reads: GONE FISHING. A sign on another: HEY LOOTER. NOTHING
OF VALUE HERE. TRY NEXT DOOR. And on the next store: HE'S
LYING.
A CHURCH
Beautiful, old, ringed with a five-foot-high wall of sandbags.
The floodwater is up to the first level of sandbags.
CARS AND PICKUP TRUCKS
Loaded down, are heading out of town on streets covered in
the first water of the flood.
A STATUE
On an island in the middle of the street. It's Civil War-
era, of a general on a horse, sword held high. The floodwater
is over the curb, lapping at the base of statue's pedestal.
Near the statue stands...
THE SHERIFF
50s, with soft edges and friendly eyes. He's talking into
his radio mike.
SHERIFF
So, are we all going to die?
HANK, the dam control officer, is on the radio with the
Sheriff.
HANK
Not right now. But I'm gonna have to
let out a little more.
WAYNE and PHIL, two deputies, 30s, are near the Sheriff,
shoring up a sandbag wall that has partially collapsed.
PHIL
I think my best was when I turned
twelve. My Dad set up a treasure
hunt. It was really cool.
(off Wayne's disdainful
look)
Well, it was.
Wayne shrugs a "whatever" and pulls a sandbag up out of the
water. There's unpleasant-looking muck all over his arms. He
drops the sandbag back into the water and shakes off the
crud with disgust.
WAYNE
This blows.
PHIL
My most awful birthday was sweet
sixteen. I had mono. How about you?
What was your worst?
WAYNE
You kidding? You think I could've
possibly had a birthday worse than
this? What kind of loser do you think
I am?
SHERIFF (O.S.)
Don't answer that, Phil.
The Sheriff walks over.
SHERIFF
Hank says he's gonna open another
gate. We're gonna get another rise.
They turn at the sound of honking. The MAYOR drives up.
MAYOR
Gentlemen. Hey -- happy birthday,
Wayne.
Wayne nods. Phil stiffens. They do not like this guy.
MAYOR
(to the Sheriff)
Mike, I gotta say, what you're
doing... I don't know if I'd be here,
considering.
SHERIFF
(good-natured)
Well, you would be if you wanted to
get the last couple of paychecks
some bastard owed you.
MAYOR
(grins, then:)
I just want you to know I think the
people 'round here made a big mistake.
Phil grumbles to himself.
PHIL
"The people"? You're the one who
screwed him.
MAYOR
Sorry, Phil?
PHIL
(blushes)
I, uh --
SHERIFF
(to Mayor, saving
Phil)
You know, Bob, as much as I'd love
to stand here all day talking about
how great I am, if you don't get
moving I'm gonna have to haul your
sorry ass off to jail.
MAYOR
(laughs)
Okay, okay, I'm going. Keep up the
good work, boys. It's appreciated.
The Mayor rolls up his window and heads off.
WAYNE
Whaddya say we go torch the fucker's
house and blame it on looters. Or
how about we put a dead cow in his
living room. He comes back after
it's been in the water a couple of
days. Hello!
SHERIFF
(shakes head)
You wanna know how to get the best
revenge on the Mayor and his boys?
You do exactly what we're doing. You
protect the town. You protect it
better than they would. Better than
they ever could.
WAYNE
(thinks, shrugs)
I think the dead cow's better.
SHERIFF
(ignores Wayne)
Any looter that comes in here is in
for a big surprise, cause as long as
I'm still wearing this pointy thing...
(indicates badge)
...nobody's taking anything from
this town.
CLOSE ON the lower half of the front doors as they fly open.
Out come TWO MEN in long dark raincoats.
WELLMAN
Runs up, stopping in the open door.
WELLMAN
Hey, wait!
VERY CLOSE ON THE TWO MEN
As they slowly turn to face Wellman. We just see their faces,
shielded from the rain by hat brims. Meet...
TOM AND CHARLIE
Tom, 30, handsome, with an easy smile. Charlie, 50, with a
tough, red face.
CHARLIE
Excuse me?
WELLMAN
Looks nervous for a second, then holds up a clipboard.
WELLMAN
You forgot to sign.
TOM AND CHARLIE
We see, for the first time, by their hats and uniforms, that
they are armored car drivers. There's an armored car parked
at the curb, on the other side of a low wall of sandbags.
Charlie sighs, goes back to Wellman and perfunctorily signs
the form. Then he and Tom go to the sandbag wall. Tom holds
both bags in one hand and the shotgun in the other. Charlie
doesn't want to get wet.
He steps from the sandbag wall onto the rear bumper of the
truck, then keys open the doors.
CHARLIE
Okay.
Charlie reaches out for the money bags. Tom jumps off the
sandbag wall and lands in the water, splashing Charlie.
CHARLIE
For Christsakes!
TOM
It's a flood, Charlie. You're gonna
get wet.
Charlie takes the bags, tosses them in then shuts the back.
He moves toward the front, still trying to keep out of the
water. Tom splashes him some more.
CHARLIE
Hey! Do you know what kind of crap
is in that water?
TOM
(of course he knows)
Well, yeah.
Tom kicks some more water at Charlie. Charlie gives Tom a
withering look and climbs in the truck.
Looking away from town, the HIGH SCHOOL is on the left. On
the right is the CEMETERY. Farther on, on the left, is a CAR
AND BOAT DEALERSHIP. The road is covered in water.
THE ARMORED TRUCK
Goes by the entrance to the high school, water shooting up
from the wheels, pushing out in a wide wake.
The Sheriff motions Wayne to stop the car, then he grabs the
radio mike and clicks it on as a megaphone.
SHERIFF
(into mike)
Henry, I saw you. Come on out.
No one comes out of the house.
SHERIFF
Henry, I'm not leaving until you
come out.
A few moments pass and then...
HENRY AND DOREEN SWERZKY
Late 70s, step out onto their porch.
DOREEN
Jesus H. Christ, Henry, I told you
to stay away from the damn window.
THE SHERIFF
Gets out of the car.
SHERIFF
What are you still doing here?
HENRY
We're just --
DOREEN
We're setting traps.
SHERIFF
That's illegal, Doreen.
DOREEN
You gonna arrest us, Sheriff? Hell,
are you even sheriff anymore, Sheriff?
Didn't you lose an election? I sure
as hell know I didn't vote for you,
and neither did Henry.
HENRY
Doreen...
SHERIFF
You don't need to set traps.
DOREEN
That's what they said in '73. When
we got back, anything the bastards
didn't steal they broke, just for
the hell of it.
SHERIFF
That's not happening this time.
DOREEN
Damn right it's not.
SHERIFF
You can't stay, you know that.
HENRY
We're going to my sister's.
SHERIFF
Good.
DOREEN
Soon as we finish setting the traps.
The Sheriff wants to say something more, but he's not about
to argue with Doreen. He just nods and gets back into the
car.
IN THE CAR
The Sheriff climbs back in. He and Wayne watch Henry and
Doreen go back into the house, Doreen still nagging at Henry.
SHERIFF
God'll understand if you have to
drown her in the basement, Henry.
The Sheriff sighs, nods to Wayne. Wayne puts the car in gear.
The water is creeping up the sloping hood of the truck.
CHARLIE
We gotta get out of here.
TOM
What about the money?
CHARLIE
The money's safe; we're not. Water
rose about a foot in the last twenty
minutes. The National Guard isn't
going to be here for another hour.
You do the math.
Tom shrugs -- Charlie's right. They're about to get out when
light washes up on them. They look out to see...
THE HEADLIGHTS OF A GMC SUBURBAN
Approaching on the other side of the dip, a quarter-mile
away.
CHARLIE AND TOM
Look at each other then get out of the truck.
THE SUBURBAN
Stops on the far side of the dip -- a hundred yards away.
The headlights shine across the water. Doors open and MEN
get out.
TOM AND CHARLIE
Come around the front of the truck. They can't see through
the glare of the Suburban's bright headlights.
CHARLIE
Hello!
MAN'S VOICE
You okay? You stuck?
CHARLIE
Yes!
MAN'S VOICE
We'll see if we can get you out!
We'll be right over!
Charlie looks at Tom, relieved.
CHARLIE
Looks like we might just --
THE SUBURBAN
Headlights go on high beam.
CHARLIE AND TOM
Squint, blinded by the high beams.
TOM
Why'd they do that?
CHARLIE
Probably so they can see better.
TOM
Or so we can't see at all.
Charlie looks at him -- what does he mean? Tom puts his hand
on his pistol.
IN THE WATER
Assembled by the Suburban are...
JIM AND HIS MEN
All holding guns. He speaks to them quietly.
JIM
This is my retirement fund, boys,
and if any one of you screws up, I
swear to God I'll kill you. Let's
go.
They start wading down into the dip in the road. Kenny carries
a rifle.
TOM AND CHARLIE
Tom squints through the bright light.
CHARLIE
Company dispatch and the National
Guard are the only ones who know
we're here.
TOM
Anyone with a scanner from Radio
Shack could've intercepted your call,
Charlie.
CHARLIE
(realizes)
Jesus.
TOM
(to Jim and men)
Could you turn down your lights?!
JIM
We're bringing a rope!
TOM
Turn down your lights!
JIM
We'll be right there!
Tom starts to pull his gun.
KENNY
is fired up on adrenalin. He has his rifle up and is aiming
it.
HIS POV
Tom with his hand on his pistol, starting to pull it out.
TOM AND CHARLIE
Charlie sees Tom going for his gun. He moves close to Tom,
half in front of him, putting his hand on Tom's.
CHARLIE
Take it easy, Tom.
KENNY
Stiffens.
KENNY'S FINGER
Squeezes the trigger of his rifle.
TOM
Jumps at the sound of the rifle crack.
CHARLIE
Is knocked back.
TOM
Yanks out his gun and starts shooting back.
JIM AND HIS MEN
Duck down in the water.
TOM
Shooting blindly, looks over and sees...
CHARLIE
A horrible look on his face, blood coming out of his neck.
He sinks into the water.
KENNY
Shoots off another few quick rounds.
TOM
Drops into the water, bullets plugging in around him. Just
his hand and pistol are visible, shooting blindly back toward
Jim and his men. THE SUBURBAN
Is hit by Tom's fire.
TOM
Runs out of bullets. A beat later we see Charlie start moving
through the water -- Tom is pulling him.
JIM
STOP SHOOTING!
KENNY
Doesn't hear Jim and keeps firing.
JIM
Aims his pistol at Kenny's head.
JIM
Stop.
Kenny stops.
BEHIND THE ARMORED TRUCK
Tom comes up in the water behind the truck, gasping, holding
Charlie. Tom rests his gun on the truck bumper.
CHARLIE
I'm sorry, Tom.
Charlie's gone.
JIM AND HIS MEN
Jim glares at Kenny, his eyes on fire.
KENNY
He was going for his gun!
JIM
He wasn't gonna shoot, Kenny.
Goddamnit!
(shakes head, calls
to Tom)
We just want the money! Get away and
we won't have to kill you!
TOM
Shuts his eyes, thinking, scared.
JIM (O.S.)
Now!
Tom opens his eyes. He looks down at...
CHARLIE
Floating in the water.
TOM
What the hell is he going to do?
JIM AND HIS MEN
Jim's men look at him. Jim motions them to wait some more.
JIM
You got thirty seconds to get the
hell away!
Jim and the others wait, but there's no answer from Tom.
JIM
The clock's running! Go!
Still no response from Tom.
THEIR POV
All they can see is the front of the truck, in the light of
the "Welcome" sign. They can't see the back.
JIM AND HIS MEN
Jim nods to his men. They head for the truck, down into the
deeper water at the bottom of the dip in the road. All have
guns up and ready.
Jim sends Mr. Mehlor and Ray out to circle around. They all
move quietly. The only sound is the rain.
JIM
Gets to the truck and moves along its side, Kenny right behind
him. Jim gets to the back of the truck, nods for Kenny to
cover him, then steps out behind the truck, gun up.
JIM'S POV
Tom is gone.
CHARLIE
Is floating in the water, eyes of glass.
KENNY, MR. MEHLOR AND RAY
Step into the circle of light thrown by the "Welcome" sign.
JIM
(eyes Charlie)
Ah, Jesus.
(to Kenny)
Your dad'd be real proud of you,
Kenny.
KENNY
He was going for his gun!
JIM
Mr. Mehlor, I believe we're gonna
need your science project.
Mr. Mehlor nods and digs into his pack. Ray looks down at
Charlie in the water.
RAY
"I shall bring floodwaters upon the
earth to destroy all that lives under
the heavens and every creature that
has the breath of life in it shall
perish." Genesis 6:17.
KENNY
Were you a preacher or something?
Ray laughs.
MR. MEHLOR
Ray did five years in the hole at
Joliet. The only thing you get to
read in the hole is the Bible.
KENNY
(to Ray)
You got religion?
RAY
Obviously.
Mr. Mehlor laughs as he pulls something out of his pack.
It's...
SMALL EXPLOSIVE DEVICE
A half-stick of dynamite with a timer, mounted on a magnet.
MR. MEHLOR
When you hit the switch you've got
thirty seconds.
RAY
You teach your students how to make
things like that?
Mr. Mehlor puts the device on the back door.
MR. MEHLOR
You been to a high school recently,
Ray? My students taught me how to
make things like that. Ready?
JIM
Hold on.
Something's wrong. Jim touches the handle on the door. It
moves. Uh-oh. He raises his pistol, grabs the door handle
and pulls. The door swings open. We don't need to see what
he sees -- we can tell from the expression on his face.
Tom is running hard through the knee-deep water, pulling a
string of canvas money bags buckled together. The truck and
"Welcome" sign are two hundred yards behind him. Tom hears
an angry yell.
Kenny is the one yelling.
JIM
Shut up. Everyone.
They quiet. The patter of the rain is too loud -- they can't
hear anything. Jim scans the horizon, but sees nothing.
RAY
Now why'd he have to go and do a
thing like that?
JIM
To stay alive.
(off their looks)
He thinks we'll kill him -- unless
he knows where the money is and we
don't.
MR. MEHLOR
There is another possibility.
(off their looks)
He's thinking of keeping it for
himself.
JIM
There's always that. Either way, we
got ourselves a sharp one.
KENNY
What do we do?
Jim is looking at something in the distance.
JIM
Pretty soon the water'll be too deep
for him to run. But for us it'll be
just deep enough.
KENNY
(unclear)
Deep enough for what?
The name WILLIAM PORTMAN is chiseled into a crypt. Tom appears
from underwater, gasping for breath. He gets to his feet and
trudges off through the water.
Tom comes out through the gates of the cemetery, splashing
through the knee-deep water. He's running when he hears,
from behind him, boat engines firing up. He turns to see...
LIGHTS
Racing toward him over the water, a hundred and fifty yards
back.
TOM
Sprints off.
THE SKI-BOAT
Jim is steering the ski-boat. Mr. Mellor hunkers down beside
him. We PULL BACK to see...
TWO JET-SKIS
Flanking the ski-boat, piloted by Kenny and Ray.
ON THE ROAD
Tom is running as fast as he can. He looks back, sees the
ski-boat and jet-skis closing. They'll get him before he
gets to town. He suddenly veers off the road toward...
THE HIGH SCHOOL
The sign out front reads: GO WARRIORS!
Tom runs around the side of the high school.
JIM AND HIS MEN
Ride up on the ski-boat and jet-skis and round the corner.
THEIR POV
No sign of Tom.
JIM
Cut your engines!
The engines are shut down. They all drift. Jim shines a
flashlight over onto...
WINDOWS
There's a hole in a window large enough to climb through.
Jim turns to his men.
JIM
Let's get him out. But for Godsake,
whatever you do...
(with a hard look at
Kenny)
...don't kill him. Not until we find
out where he hid that money.
Kenny drifts up to the front doors. He pulls on them. Locked.
JIM
Mr. Mehlor?
MR. MEHLOR
Reaches into his pack.
Kenny rides his jet-ski fast away from the front doors and
the doors explode.
Jim and Mr. Mehlor are moving right outside the windows just
as Tom blasts out of the school and races off into the dark.
Tom moves fast over the water. He yanks off his clip-on tie.
JIM AND THE OTHERS
Chase Tom's light, behind by fifty yards, heading out into
farm fields. They get closer and closer and then watch as...
TOM'S JET-SKI
Runs straight into a tree and explodes.
JIM AND THE OTHERS
Race up to find the burning, flaming wreckage of the jet-
ski. Ray circles on the other jet-ski. Kenny, still bleeding
from the head, is in the boat with Jim and Mr. Mehlor.
KENNY
(laughing)
Nice driving, buttwipe!
RAY
I'm glad you're enjoying this, Kenny,
but if he's dead, how do we find the
money?
Kenny reacts -- oh, right.
JIM
Oh, he's still alive.
We see what Jim sees.
ECU THROTTLE OF JET-SKI
Tom used his tie to wrap the throttle open.
HUNDRED YARDS AWAY
Tom is hiding in the branches of a floating tree, watching
the distant lights of Jim and his men. The current carries
Tom away.
WITH JIM AND HIS MEN
Jim scans the horizon; sees nothing.
JIM
Ray, I'm in need of a little
inspiration.
RAY
"With a raging flood he makes an end
of those who oppose him, and pursues
his enemies into darkness." From one
of the more obscure --
KENNY
Sorry to interrupt Bible study and
all, but has no one but me noticed
how completely screwed we are? We
should be back in the motel room,
counting out the money. Instead --
Jim lashes out with a fist, hard and fast, hitting Kenny in
the chest, knocking him out of the ski-boat, into the water.
Kenny comes up in the thigh-deep water, sputtering.
JIM
No one likes this particular turn of
events, Kenny, but we have a choice --
we can can either deal with it or we
can walk away. There's a lot of money
out there, so I choose to deal with
it. If you want to go, that's fine --
start swimming. You want to stay,
that's fine, too -- just stop your
damn whining.
Jim pushes the throttle forward and the ski-boat takes off,
leaving Ray on the jet-ski, with Kenny in the water.
KENNY
What the hell's his problem? All the
money in the world ain't worth a
goddamn nickel if you get caught.
It's not like there won't be other
jobs.
RAY
You may have more of these in you,
Kenny, but Jim doesn't.
Ray pulls Kenny up onto the jet-ski and takes off after Jim.
The water level is creeping up a five-foot-high wall of
sandbags.
REVERSE ANGLE
Looking out over the top of the sandbag wall. A tree floats
by on the water.
HANDS
Suddenly appear on the top of the wall and...
TOM
Pulls himself into view. He climbs over the wall, exhausted.
BEHIND THE SANDBAG WALL
Gasoline-powered pumps are sucking up any rainwater. The
sandbags have kept the floodwater at bay.
TOM
He hurries up the back steps and goes into the church.
The rain sheets down hard. A lightning flash reveals...
THE STATUE
The water is up to the horse's knees. The lightning passes
and a second later thunder rolls.
Water is halfway up the four-foot high wall of sandbags around
the station. There are three outboard motorboats moored to
the sandbags.
SHERIFF
Phil, take Karen's boat.
The Sheriff and Wayne climb toward their boats.
WAYNE
You can do it, Phil. The men of
Huntingburg are counting on you.
PHIL
Just bite me.
Wayne laughs as he and the Sheriff fire up their boat engines.
Two gates open fast, all the way, and water thunders out.
The Sheriff and Wayne are motoring in their boats, zooming
through the trees, engine noise obliterating anything coming
in over the radio.
Phil steers Karen's small boat down Main Street, past the
statue. The water is up to the rider's stirrups.
KAREN
(pleading)
Did you see the stained glass windows,
Phil? Did you see what a good job
they did? I can't let anything happen
to the church, not after all I've
put into it.
PHIL
Karen, you know I'd do anything for
you, but the Sheriff told me to get
you out of town. I'm sorry. It's for
your own good.
Karen stands up.
PHIL
What're you doing?
KAREN
If you're not going to take me back
to the church, then I'll swim.
Karen moves to get out of the boat.
PHIL
No. Hey, hold on.
Phil lets go of the throttle and stands, moving toward Karen.
KAREN
What am I saying?
Karen suddenly turns on Phil and pushes him out of the boat.
KAREN
This is my boat. You swim.
Karen guns the engine and shoots off down a side street.
Phil stands in the waist-deep water and watches her go,
flabbergasted.
Karen comes around a corner and drives her boat up to the
church. The water is swirling quietly, still a good three
feet below the top of the wall.
Close on the lighted "Welcome to Huntingburg" sign. There's
a rushing sound and a two-foot-high wall of water hits the
sign. The lights explode in geysers of sparks and the water
rushes on.
The Sheriff and Wayne are racing through a grove of half-
submerged trees. There's a rushing sound above the sound of
the engines. WHAM! and they're hit by the wall of water.
Wayne falls out of his boat and is lost in the swirling water.
Jim and his men are motoring down an alleyway when...
THE WALL OF WATER
Rushes down the alley.
RAY
The water hits him hard, knocking him off the jet-ski. He's
swept away by the water.
CLOSE ON A FENCE LACED WITH CONCERTINA WIRE
The surge water shoots through it. And suddenly there's...
RAY
Slammed up against the fence, pinned to it, water rushing
over and around and by him. He yells as the wire cuts into
him.
Karen is pouring gasoline into the pumps.
She hears the rushing and looks up as the surge hits. Water
shoots over the top.
The wall of water slams in hard, cascading over the sandbag
wall.
The building is like a rock in a stream, with the water
rushing up high against one wall, roiling and swirling around
the sides.
Jim pulls Ray, coughing, choking, bleeding, into the ski-
boat.
Karen suddenly has a horrible thought and stops. She shakes
it off -- doesn't want to think about it -- and mutters to
herself.
KAREN
They'll get him out.
Phil is clinging to the statue as the water surges by below
him.
Wayne gets back into his boat. The Sheriff realizes something.
SHERIFF
Wayne... You locked him in.
A telephone pole is half-submerged, being pulled along fast
by the current.
Tom surfaces in a hole in the roof. There's a vent duct laying
on the roof -- Karen must've kicked that over to get to the
light fixture. Karen helps Tom up. She sits and he lays down
on the roof, catching his breath.
TOM
Thank you.
KAREN
I owed you -- for hitting you and
all. But we're even now, okay?
TOM
Even.
(beat, looks around)
What happened?
KAREN
I don't know.
They get up.
KAREN
Maybe another levee broke upriver.
They've been --
Just then...
A PROPANE TANK
Explodes. The fireball rips across the dark sky, illuminating
everything, showing...
JIM AND HIS MEN
Fifty feet away -- Jim, Mr. Mehlor and Ray in the ski-boat
and Kenny on the jet-ski -- guns aimed at Tom and Karen.
TOM
Oh, God.
DARKNESS
As the lightning passes, and in the darkness, the thunder
rolls.
JIM AND HIS MEN
Switch on their lights and move forward. They pass...
CARS
Floating down the street with other debris. The cars have
been damaged by the flood -- one is missing a door.
JIM AND HIS MEN
When they get closer to the Sheriff's station, what they see --
or don't see -- makes them stop.
THEIR POV
Tom and Karen have disappeared. Karen's boat is still moored
to the Sheriff's station roof, empty.
JIM
They're in the water! Kenny, cut
your engine!
Kenny shuts off the engine of the one remaining jet-ski. Jim
shuts down the boat engine. They float in silence, scanning
the water with their flashlights. There's no sign of Tom and
Karen.
UNDERWATER
Tom motions Karen to follow him. She's freaked and hesitates.
Tom grabs her hand and pulls her.
THEIR POV
The ski-boat and jet-ski are right above them, flashlights
playing over the water.
JIM AND HIS MEN
Reach the roof of the Sheriff's station. Jim looks around.
JIM
Kenny, go that way. We'll go down
here.
LONG SHOT POV THROUGH CAR WINDSHIELD
Of Kenny and Jim heading off in different directions.
TOM AND KAREN
Rise into view in a car. They gasp for air and keep low.
KAREN
Tell them where the money is.
TOM
I can't.
KAREN
Well, I can.
She's about to call out. Tom grabs her hard.
TOM
If they know where the money is,
they will kill us.
Before Karen can say anything, a flashlight beam comes
swinging toward them and they have to duck underwater.
JIM
Watches as his flashlight beam washes over the car. Nothing
there. He guns his engine and heads off down the street.
THE CAR
Floats off around a corner.
IN THE CAR
Tom and Karen surface, catch their breath. Quiet for a few
moments as they both look around to see that Jim and his men
are gone.
KAREN
So what do we do?
TOM
I guess just drive around until we
run out of gas.
KAREN
(pissed)
Look, I've spent the last eight months
of my life restoring that church,
and I just left it to come save your
ass, so spare me, okay?
TOM
(beat)
When we get down here a little further
we'll find a place for you to hide.
(off her look)
I'm gonna get back to the truck and
wait for the National Guard.
(checks watch)
They should be there pretty soon.
Karen nods. Tom looks at her. She's shivering.
TOM
Cold?
KAREN
No, I'm fine. The heater just kicked
in.
Tom looks at her, gives a little grin. Their eyes meet for a
second, then they look away.
Phil climbs up onto the roof, exhausted. He sees the hole in
the roof and goes to look at it. As he's looking down...
SHERIFF (O.S.)
Is he dead?
Phil turns to see...
THE SHERIFF AND WAYNE
Coasting up in their boats.
PHIL
No. Someone got him out.
SHERIFF
Who?
PHIL
(hesitates)
Maybe Karen.
WAYNE
Karen? How could she get him out?
You took her out of town.
PHIL
I -- It --
SHERIFF
Let's hear it, Phil.
PHIL
It happened real fast, okay?
Tom and Karen float down the alley in the car.
KAREN
You ever been robbed before?
TOM
No. The scariest thing that ever
happened before was Charlie running
out of donuts.
(off her look)
I've only been doing this for a couple
months.
KAREN
(not what she wanted
to hear)
Oh.
Silence for a few moments.
KAREN
What'd you do before this?
TOM
I, uh... I sold construction
machinery.
(off her look)
I was making good money, it just...
I don't know. It just didn't seem
right for me anymore.
KAREN
How'd you end up in this?
TOM
My uncle did me a favor; got me in.
KAREN
Nice favor. How's he gonna feel after
tonight?
TOM
My uncle was Charlie -- my partner
in the truck.
KAREN
Oh, God. I'm sorry.
Tom nods -- so is he.
Phil climbs into the Sheriff's boat.
WAYNE
She know karate or something, Phil?
Maybe kung fu? I mean, I can't see
how else she could overpower the
likes of you.
PHIL
Shut up, Wayne.
SHERIFF
Shut up, both of you. Let's go find
Karen; see if she's got him.
The Sheriff fires up his engine and heads off, Wayne
following.
Karen and Tom are still in the car. They freeze at the sound
of engines in the distance. The sounds fade. Tom looks around.
TOM
God, I wonder whose car this is.
Karen plucks some cassette tapes out of the water.
KAREN
Well, whoever it is, he listens to
Pat Benatar, Eddie Money and the
soundtrack to "Footloose."
TOM
Really?
(looks at tapes)
Hold on...
(looks around car)
...I think this is my car from high
school.
Karen laughs. Just then...
THE CAR
Gets caught on something and stops.
TOM
Looks like we get out here.
(Karen hesitates)
Come on -- I told your father I'd
have you home by ten.
Karen grins. Just then...
A TRANSFORMER
down the street explodes.
TOM AND KAREN
Hear a sparking sound and look over to see...
A TRANSFORMER
On a telephone/power pole close to them. Rain hits it, causing
the sparking sound. The floodwater is inching up the pole
toward it.
The water will reach the transformer in a matter of seconds.
And while they're staring at that...
ANOTHER TRANSFORMER
At the end of the street explodes as water hits it.
TOM AND KAREN
Look around -- what to do? Tom points.
TOM
There!
They climb out of the car and start swimming toward a house.
THE TRANSFORMER
Water is three inches from the transformer; two inches...
TOM AND KAREN
Swimming as hard as they can.
THE TRANSFORMER
One inch from the water...
TOM AND KAREN
Reach the house. They pull themselves up onto a television
antenna/ladder running up the side of the house. Karen's
feet are still in the water.
TOM
Get your feet up!
THE TRANSFORMER
The water is about to touch. There's a sizzling sound.
TOM AND KAREN
They heave a huge sigh of relief -- but then Tom realizes...
TOM
Oh, shit!
KAREN
What?
TOM
(re: antenna/ladder)
It's metal!
Tom pushes Karen over onto a window ledge. Then, just as
Tom's about to step over...
KENNY
Comes screaming in on the jet-ski. He dives off the jetski,
gets a hold of Tom and pulls him under.
KENNY AND TOM
Surface. Kenny is stronger and he has Tom in a tight grip.
One problem -- Kenny doesn't know the danger they're in.
TOM
We've gotta --!
Kenny shoves Tom underwater.
KENNY
HEY! I GOT HIM!
Tom comes up, looks over at...
THE TRANSFORMER
The sizzling is getting louder.
TOM
We have to --!
Kenny dunks Tom again.
KENNY
I GOT HIM!
UNDERWATER
Tom grabs Kenny's arms and pulls himself up fast.
KENNY AND TOM
Tom's head comes out of the water and slams into Kenny's
chin. Kenny is stunned. Tom gets free of his grasp.
KAREN
Hurry!
Tom does the backstroke, pulling hard toward Karen.
KENNY
Still stunned, finally hears the sizzling and looks over
at...
THE TRANSFORMER
The water touches the outer casing of the transformer.
KENNY
Starts swimming fast toward...
TOM AND KAREN
Karen grabs Tom's arm and Tom gets a hold of the windowsill
and pulls himself up.
KENNY
Grabs onto...
THE TV ANTENNA
And starts pulling himself out of the water.
THE TRANSFORMER
Explodes.
KENNY
Feels pretty pleased with himself until...
THE TV ANTENNA
Starts dancing with electricity and...
KENNY
Is hit by the voltage and his teeth clamp shut and his body
goes rigid and his clothes explode in flames.
TOM AND KAREN
Look away.
THE WATER
Dead fish start floating to the surface.
KENNY
Is fried, smoking. He falls off the TV antenna and hits the
water with a loud and ugly hiss. He floats away, his body
shaking spasmodically.
TOM AND KAREN
Tom hears an engine approaching. He looks around, then smashes
the window with his elbow.
Jim drives the boat down the street. Mr. Mehlor is scanning
the water with a flashlight.
MR. MEHLOR
Jim! Over there!
Jim looks over to see...
THE JET-SKI
Floating in the water. And not far from it is...
KENNY
Still twitching.
OMITTED
Sequence omitted from original script.
Jim and Mr. Mehlor pull Kenny into the ski-boat. Kenny is
shivering. Part of his hair has been burned away.
KENNY
Jesus, God, it hurts!
JIM
You're gonna be okay, Ken. Mr. Mehlor
knows these things and he thinks
you're gonna be okay.
Mr. Mehlor looks at Jim. Mr. Mehlor knows these things and
he thinks Kenny is going to die.
KENNY
It hurts!
JIM
Don't you, Mr. Mehlor? Don't you
think Kenny's gonna be okay?
MR. MEHLOR
Yeah, Kenny. You're gonna be fine.
KENNY
Jesus, I can't stop shivering.
Mr. Mehlor moves aside. Jim puts his arms around Kenny.
KENNY
I know you didn't want me to come.
JIM
You kidding? We couldn't've done
anything without you.
KENNY
My dad'd sure be pissed off, huh?
JIM
Your dad'd just want you to lay still
while we got you some help.
KENNY
Hey -- hey the pain's goin'.
(relief)
Oh, man.
He looks up at Jim and grins.
KENNY
When you said I was gonna be okay, I
thought you were just shittin' me.
JIM
See? You gotta trust me.
Kenny's shivering stops. It stops because he's dead. Jim
slowly lets go.
Henry stands on the roof of the back porch, steadying a small
rowboat as Tom gets in. Doreen nags from the window.
DOREEN
You give away our only boat in the
middle of a flood. You are a genius,
Henry. A goddamn genius.
TOM
(whispers to Henry,
re: Doreen)
You wanna come with me?
Henry looks at Tom, entertaining the notion...
DOREEN
Jesus, Henry, what are you waiting
for -- a kiss goodbye? Get back in
here.
Henry sighs and lets go of the boat. Tom rows off.
LONG SHOT OF TOM
We see him in silhouette, crossing the gap between two houses.
JIM AND HIS MEN
Are watching, from the shadows on the dark side of the street.
RAY
Why don't we just get him?
JIM
If our resourceful young friend hears
us coming, he'll electrocute us or
sink us or one of you'll shoot him.
Besides...
(glances at watch)
...I know where he's going. What I'd
like to know is where he came from.
The Sheriff sits in his boat, moored to the wall of sandbags
around the church. Wayne's boat is tied up next to it. The
floodwater is trickling over the top of the wall. The gas-
powered pumps inside the wall are keeping the waters at bay.
WAYNE AND PHIL
Come out of the front doors of the church.
WAYNE
They're not here.
Tom rows up to the truck and "Welcome" sign. His flashlight
shows just the top of the truck and sign. Tom looks at his
watch, ties the rowboat to the sign, jumps into the water.
A few moments pass, then Tom surfaces, holding a shotgun.
Then he senses something behind him and turns to see...
A COW
Floating in the water, tongue out, eyes glassy.
TOM
Kicks away, horrified. And then he hears an engine. He looks.
TOM'S POV
Jim's ski-boat is coming over the water. The engine cuts out
and the ski-boat drifts, a hundred feet from Tom.
JIM
(yelling)
Son, before you go underwater and do
something tricky, there's something
I'd like you to see!
A flashlight comes on, the beam swivels, illuminating...
HENRY AND DOREEN
Standing in the ski-boat, blinking in the light.
TOM
Slumps.
JIM
Now, I know it's your job to protect
that money, and maybe you'd even be
foolish enough to give your life for
it. The question is, are you willing
to give their lives for it?
Jim puts a pistol to Doreen's head.
JIM
Drop the gun and get into the boat.
TOM
Thinks for a second, then throws the shotgun away and pulls
himself into the rowboat.
JIM
Excellent choice.
TOM, JIM, HENRY AND DOREEN
As Tom and Jim call to each other across the water, Doreen
goes at Henry.
TOM
I'll take you to the money, but you
gotta let them go.
DOREEN
I hope you're proud of yourself,
Henry Sears.
HENRY
Shh.
JIM
I think it'd be best if --
DOREEN
I told you not to give him the goddamn
boat.
HENRY
Doreen, please.
JIM
I think it'd be best if we all stayed
together.
TOM
You say all you want is the money?
Prove it. Let them go.
JIM
I don't know if that's --
DOREEN
We could be safe in our home instead
of out here in a boat with these low-
life scumbags!
JIM
(after a look at
Doreen, nods to Mr.
Mehlor)
Let 'em go.
The Sheriff, Wayne and Phil motor past the statue. Wayne is
driving his boat; Phil is with the Sheriff. The water is up
to the General's neck.
Tom helps Henry and Doreen over into the rowboat. As he does,
his face comes close to Henry's for a second.
TOM
(whisper)
Karen?
HENRY
(shakes head, whispers)
In the attic. They never saw her.
Karen swims down the center of the street.
Tom is in the ski-boat with Jim. He looks out at...
HENRY AND DOREEN
As Henry rows them off into the darkness.
DOREEN
(disappearing in dark)
Faster, Henry! The bastards might
change their minds! Stop lily- dipping
and move it!
Henry starts to turn the boat around.
DOREEN
What're you doing?
HENRY
I'm gonna row back there and see if
he'll shoot you. Or me. Fine either
way.
DOREEN
Henry...?
HENRY
Do you want me to get us out of here?
DOREEN
Yes, of course, I --
HENRY
Then shut the fuck up.
Henry turns the boat around and rows off. Doreen is silent.
JIM'S SKI-BOAT
Jim shakes his head. Tom looks at Ray, coughing and at Kenny,
dead. Tom doesn't know what to say.
TOM
I...
JIM
The only thing I want to hear from
you is where the money is.
The Sheriff and Wayne are motoring fast down a street, the
Sheriff leading. The Sheriff sees something in the water in
front of him. He curses and throttles down fast.
KAREN
Is in the water, exhausted and cold.
Jim pilots the ski-boat into the cemetery. All are aghast.
A DOZEN CASKETS
Are floating in the water. Half of them have drifted up
against the fence; the others are headed that way.
JIM
I wonder where they think they're
going.
RAY
What the hell's going on?
MR. MEHLOR
This happened in a flood in Georgia.
The ground gets soggy, and the caskets
are air-tight -- anyone who hasn't
been planted too long just pops up.
RAY
You teach your students stuff like
that? No wonder they kicked you out.
MR. MEHLOR
I didn't teach my students anything
at all.
JIM
(to Tom)
Where is it?
TOM
It's hard to tell now with the water
so deep.
Jim cocks the hammer on his pistol. Tom gets the hint.
TOM
It's down there a little further.
Jim nods, gives the engine some juice and they move on.
TOM
Takes a quick look at his watch.
JIM
Sees Tom looking at his watch.
Karen is in the Sheriff's boat, wearing Phil's jacket, trying
to warm up.
KAREN
Tom went off in their rowboat.
WAYNE
(to Phil)
It's Tom now. Looks like you lost
out, pal.
SHERIFF
Where was he going?
KAREN
Back to the armored truck.
Jim throttles down the ski-boat engine.
JIM
Here?
TOM
Uh... no. A little farther --
JIM
They're not coming, son.
Tom looks over at Jim, pretending to be confused.
TOM
What?
JIM
The National Guard. They're not
coming.
TOM
I don't --
JIM
I know you've been trying to stall
until they show up, but they're not
coming.
TOM
(pause as he realizes)
Oh, God. You intercepted Charlie's
call, then you called them off.
JIM
No, son, I didn't call them off.
They never were coming. We didn't
"intercept" Charlie's call. He called
us direct.
And on Tom's look of disbelief...
The Sheriff is in his boat; Wayne is back in his own. The
Sheriff is on the radio.
SHERIFF
Hank, remember when Mike Crane holed
up in Jack Finch's barn and said he
was gonna burn it down?
CROSSCUT WITH HANK
HANK
Hey, I was the one who got the dumb
son-of-a-bitch to come out.
SHERIFF
Right. And before you went in, I
deputized you, you dumb son-of-a-
bitch! So when I say get down here,
it's not a request, it's an order.
So get down here! Now! I won't need
you for long. And bring your gun.
JIM
We were gonna hit you just before
you got on the Interstate, but then
you got stuck so we had to change
our plans and take you --
TOM
Bullshit. This is all bullshit.
JIM
I knew Charlie when we were both
working construction for the Johnstown
company. His middle name was McCarthy
because his parents loved Charlie
McCarthy on the radio. His wife's
name was Mary. She died of a heart-
attack last year. He has a daughter
and a son, both grown with children
of their own. I'm afraid I don't
know the names of the grandchildren.
Tom looks down, not wanting to believe.
JIM
What else do I know...? Oh, yes. I
know Uncle Charlie was trying to
steer his favorite nephew away from
a life of crime.
Tom suddenly lunges for Jim. Ray yanks Tom back.
TOM
Why'd you shoot him? Kill Charlie
and you get to keep another share?
JIM
No, That was an accident. Ken shot
him.
(eyes Kenny sadly)
I never told him Charlie was on my
side. Ken liked to talk.
(shakes head)
He shouldn't've been here. But his
dad asked me to watch over him. I
guess I didn't do the best job.
RAY
Excuse me, Jim. I hate to interrupt
and all, but could we just get the
money and get the hell out of here?
JIM
(nods; to Tom)
I'm gonna ask you one more time. And
before you think of bullshitting me
again, keep in mind I have had a
very frustrating night. And while I
know I'll never get the money if I
kill you, it's getting to the point
where I just don't care.
Jim casually aims his gun at Tom.
TOM
I'll tell you where it is. But it's
not going to do you any good.
Jim arches an eyebrow.
TOM
The Guard may not be coming, but
someone else sure as hell is.
At the controls of his boat, moving fast, sprayed by rain.
Karen and Phil are in the back of the boat. Wayne is close
behind in his boat.
JIM
I'll take my chances.
Tom pauses, looks over to...
THE CRYPT
Just the top of it is visible. Two more COFFINS float nearby.
TOM
There.
Jim steers the ski-boat over, hands Tom a flashlight.
JIM
Well, go get it.
Tom climbs over the edge of the ski-boat and into the water.
He turns on the flashlight and drops below the surface.
RAY
(eyeing Tom in water)
"At night we'd go down to the river
and into the river we'd dive."
(off Jim and Mehlor's
looks)
Springsteen, "The River." I'm all
out of bible quotes.
UNDERWATER
Tom shines his light on...
THE CRYPT
One end of a rope is tied to the crypt. The other end, cut
and frayed, is suspended in the water, waving in the current.
ON THE WATER
Jim watches Tom's light rise. Tom comes up fast, takes a
breath.
TOM
It's gone.
JIM
What?
TOM
(smug)
Looks like somebody beat you to it.
RAY
Oh for Christs -- I'm gonna shoot
him, Jim.
Ray grabs pistol in his belt. Before he can pull it out,
holes puff out of his chest, followed by blood and then the
sound of the rifle-shots. Ray tumbles into the water. A half-
second later there's...
HAIL OF BULLETS
Ripping into the ski-boat, water, trees, crypt.
THE SHERIFF'S BOAT, WAYNE'S BOAT
Are outside the fence, a hundred feet from the crypt. PUSH
IN FAST on...
THE SHERIFF
To the rescue. He and Wayne and Phil fire their guns.
TOM
Ducks underwater.
JIM
Pulls his pistol, returns fire.
MR. MEHLOR
Opens fire with a shotgun, shooting wild, yelling. Then he's
hit and knocked out of the boat, dead.
IN THE SHERIFF'S BOAT
KAREN
Stop! You'll hit Tom!
The Sheriff stops shooting, yells at the others.
SHERIFF
Hold your fire!
Wayne and Phil stop shooting.
BY THE CRYPT
Tom is holding onto a coffin, out of view of the Sheriff. He
hears a rush of bubbles and turns as...
JIM
Comes to the surface, breathing deep.
JIM'S GUN
Comes out of the water fast and the barrel goes to Tom's
forehead.
THE SHERIFF'S BOAT
There's an adrenal fire in the Sheriff's eyes. He starts his
boat forward, Wayne following. Their lights find...
JIM'S BOAT
No sign of life. Then there's a sound and the lights sweep
over to find...
JIM AND TOM
Climbing up on top of the mostly-submerged crypt. Jim is
behind Tom with his gun to Tom's head.
THE SHERIFF
Stops his boat. Wayne stops, too. They are thirty yards from
Jim and Tom.
KAREN AND TOM
A look passes between them.
JIM
(to Sheriff)
Now, sir, I can imagine you'd love
nothing more than to shoot me, but I
caution you -- in order to do that,
you're gonna have to shoot through
young Tom here.
THE SHERIFF
Thinks for a second, then shrugs.
SHERIFF
Okay.
He raises his rifle.
KAREN
Realizes what is about to happen.
TOM AND JIM
Also clue in, but before they can move...
THE SHERIFF
Squeezes the trigger as...
KAREN
Hits the gun with her arm.
THE RIFLE
Fires.
TOM
is grazed in the arm by the bullet.
THE SHERIFF
Smacks Karen hard with his rifle and she tumbles out of the
boat, unconscious.
TOM AND JIM
Throw themselves back off the crypt as...
THE SHERIFF AND WAYNE
Empty their guns in their direction.
JIM
Returns fire, shooting blindly over the top of the crypt.
PHIL
Reaches for Karen, floating limp in the water, but...
WAYNE
Is closer. He grabs Karen and pulls her into his boat, then
grins at Phil.
TOM AND JIM
Are behind the crypt. Tom holds his bleeding arm. Jim reloads.
TOM
Well, that was unexpected.
JIM
Is he the one you thought was coming
to your rescue?
No answer from Tom, but the answer is clear.
WITH THE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN
The Sheriff and Wayne reload.
HANK (O.S.)
Anyone mind telling me what the hell
is going on?
The Sheriff, Wayne and Phil turn to see...
HANK
In his boat, right behind them, all dressed up in hunting
gear, rifle at the ready.
SHERIFF
Hey, Hank. That money I told you
about? From the armored car? We're
gonna keep it. Three million dollars.
Four ways.
(shoots at crypt)
Seven fifty apiece. You okay with
that?
Hank is stunned. He doesn't answer.
SHERIFF
Hank? You okay with that?
HANK
Seven hundred and fifty thousand
dollars?
(beat, grins)
Damn straight I'm okay with that.
WAYNE
(grumbling, re: Hank)
Don't see what we needed him for.
SHERIFF
Then I guess you've never been hunting
with Hank.
(to Hank)
We got two behind that crypt. Get
'em.
Hank nods. He motions for Wayne to go one way; he'll go the
other. They start off. A blind shot comes from Jim behind
the crypt. The Sheriff shoots back. Phil finally musters up
the courage to say something.
PHIL
Maybe I'm not okay with it.
SHERIFF
Come on now, Phil.
PHIL
You're gonna kill people?
SHERIFF
They're looters, Phil! They come and
steal from an armored truck in our
town -- they're looters.
(fires two shots)
PHIL
What about Tom? What about Karen?
They're not looters.
SHERIFF
No, they're witnesses.
The Sheriff fires off a flurry of bullets.
TOM AND JIM
Behind the crypt, bullets winging by. Jim looks over, sees...
HANK
Motor into view.
JIM
Opens fire.
HANK
Shoots back.
TOM
Flattens against the crypt, then turns to see...
WAYNE
Coming into view on the other side.
TOM
Looks at Jim, sees he's occupied in the fight with Hank.
Then he sees...
RAY
Floating in the water, dead, pistol still jammed in his pants.
TOM
Thinks, decides, and reaches out for Ray.
CLOSE ON JIM
Shooting at Hank. He hears gunfire from Wayne and is about
to swivel to shoot in that direction when he hears a gun
firing from right next to him. He turns to see...
TOM
Shooting back at Wayne with Ray's gun.
WAYNE
Pulls back out of the line of fire.
HANK
Curses and pulls back, too.
TOM AND JIM
Exchange a look.
THE SHERIFF'S BOAT
PHIL
How can you do this?
SHERIFF
Jeez, Phil, I always thought Wayne
was the stupid one. Read my lips.
(slowly)
Three million dollars. Look at it!
The Sheriff reaches down into a forward storage area of the
boat and pulls back a tarp revealing the bags of money.
SHERIFF
A couple of those bags are gonna be
yours, Phil.
PHIL
But -- but -- you're the Sheriff!
The Sheriff rips his badge off and throws it away.
SHERIFF
I'm the what?
TOM AND JIM
Jim looks at Tom, then hands Tom his pistol. Tom doesn't
know what Jim's doing. Jim slips beneath the water.
HANK
Whistles and gets Wayne's attention. He motions Wayne to try
it again.
THE SHERIFF'S BOAT
PHIL
For twenty years you've been --
SHERIFF
For twenty years I've been eating
shit, breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Well, tonight I'm changing the menu!
From now on everything I eat is gonna
be shit-free!
BEHIND THE CRYPT
Tom is looking for Jim, to see what he's doing. And then...
WAYNE AND HANK
Come around on both sides.
TOM
Starts shooting at them with the two pistols.
WAYNE AND HANK
Pull back. As they go...
TOM
Sees...
KAREN'S ARM
Draped over the side of Wayne's boat.
TOM
Takes another shot at Hank but stops firing at Wayne.
CLOSE ON JIM'S SKI-BOAT
Jim's hand appears over the gunwale. He reaches in and
grabs...
MR. MEHLOR'S PACK
And pulls it out of the boat.
THE SHERIFF'S BOAT
SHERIFF
Can I make it any clearer, Phil? Do
you want me to draw pictures?
Phil pulls out his revolver and points it at the Sheriff.
PHIL
I can't let you do it.
SHERIFF
Oh for --
(beat)
Okay, Phil. But here's how it's gonna
go. I'm gonna hear one of two things
out of you. Either I'm gonna hear
you say you're in with us, or...
(moves close to Phil's
gun)
...I'm gonna hear a bullet come out
of that gun and go into me.
Phil is incredulous. The Sheriff weighs his hands like scales.
SHERIFF
(one hand)
Seven hundred and fifty thousand
dollars or...
(other hand)
...you kill me. Your choice.
The Sheriff weighs the hands a couple more times. Phil slumps,
lowers the gun.
SHERIFF
There we go.
SOMETHING
Flies through the air; lands in the water by the Sheriff.
It's...
MR. MEHLOR'S PACK
And it starts sinking in the water.
BEHIND THE CRYPT
Tom sees...
JIM
Haul himself into the ski-boat.
WAYNE (O.S.)
In the boat!
THE SHERIFF, WAYNE AND HANK
Start shooting at Jim in the ski-boat.
JIM
Sticks the shotgun over the gunwale and returns fire.
TOM
Starts swimming for the boat.
THE SHERIFF, WAYNE AND HANK
See Tom and start shooting at both he and Jim when...
MR. MEHLOR'S PACK
Explodes and...
THE WATER
Erupts in a huge geyser.
THE SHERIFF, WAYNE, PHIL AND HANK
Are knocked off their feet. The Sheriff, Phil and Hank are
thrown into the water. Their boats are rocked up and back
and swamped with falling water.
JIM
Fires up his engine.
TOM
Is almost to the boat.
WAYNE
Gets to his knees in his boat and starts shooting.
TOM
Gets to Jim's boat and grabs onto it.
JIM
Cranks the throttle, and, dragging Tom, tears off under the
hail of Wayne's bullets.
TOM'S POV
As Jim races through the tombstones, barely missing
halfsubmerged stone crosses and crypt roofs.
TOM
Rams into one cross.
HIS HANDS
Start to slip from the boat.
JIM
Grabs Tom's hand and holds on as they shoot off across the
water.
THE SHERIFF, PHIL AND HANK
Get back in the boats.
Jim hauls Tom into the boat. Tom lays on the bottom, catching
his breath. Blood is dripping down from his arm.
TOM
(beat, looks up at
Jim)
You really want that money?
Jim gives Tom a look -- of course he wants that money.
TOM
'Cause the only way you're ever gonna
see it is if you help me get Karen.
Before Jim can answer, gunshots ring out behind them. They
look back to see...
THE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN
Coming after them in the three boats, shooting, closing.
TOM
We're too slow.
JIM
(thinks, then:)
Here.
Jim moves away from the wheel, giving it to Tom. Tom gets up
and takes over. Jim bends and picks up...
KENNY
Lifeless and limp.
JIM
Looks at Kenny for a moment, then pushes his body overboard.
WITH THE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN
Flying over the water.
THEIR POV
They see a body tumble out of the ski-boat.
WITH JIM AND TOM
Jim looks back, following Kenny with his eyes.
Jim and Tom make the turn onto Main Street. They look back
as...
THE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN
Come around the corner, two hundred yards back.
TOM
They're not going to catch us now.
LOW ANGLE
Of the ski-boat, racing toward camera. As it gets closer,
the camera BOOMS DOWN underwater to reveal...
THE STATUE
The sword tip just below the surface. THE SKI-BOAT
There's a jarring metal on metal clank as the sword tip slams
into the propeller.
JIM AND TOM
Are thrown forward.
JIM
Slams head-first into the dash.
UNDERWATER
The propeller has stopped.
TOM
Looks back to see that...
THE OUTBOARD MOTOR
Has almost been ripped from its moorings.
TOM
Okay, so maybe they are gonna catch
us now.
No answer from Jim. Tom looks down.
JIM
Is laying on the deck, unconscious. Just then... BAM! BAM!
BAM!
HANK
Has his rifle resting on his boat's windshield and is firing
off a clip on automatic as he, Wayne and the Sheriff close
in.
TOM
Ducks down and tries to start the engine. No go. Again. It
catches on the third try. Tom guns it and the boat tears
off.
THE OUTBOARD ENGINE
Is wobbling, vibrating.
HANK
Keeps up his stream of gunfire.
TOM
Stays down, driving blind, as the bullets fly in, blowing
holes in the windshield. He looks at Jim, at the engine and
curses. He steers the boat toward...
THE CHURCH
All lit-up, brilliant white in the darkness, a quarter-mile
away.
The water is now over the sandbag wall. The first several
feet of the church are flooded.
THE SKI-BOAT
Comes up fast. Tom grounds it on top of the sandbag wall.
Tom hesitates for a half second before grabbing Jim and
pushing him out of the boat and into the water.
JIM
Hits the cold water and comes to, sputtering.
TOM
Grabs guns and ammo and jumps out of the boat and into the
water. He lays a rifle on the top of the sandbag wall and
fires off a clip.
THE SHERIFF, HANK AND WAYNE
Jim's bullets plug into their boats. They circle back.
AT THE CHURCH
Tom pushes Jim, still groggy, into the flooded church.
Wayne and Hank are alongside the Sheriff, engines idling as
they look at the church.
SHERIFF
(nods, to Hank)
Then go get some bottles.
Hank nods, guns his engine.
PHIL
(to Hank)
Wait -- what about the dam?
SHERIFF
It'll be fine.
PHIL
You said if it goes it'll wipe out
the town.
SHERIFF
Fuck the town.
Hank nods in agreement and takes off.
Water is starting to go over the top again. It pours down in
sheets over the face of the dam.
Wayne is thinking about something. He makes a decision and
flicks on his engine.
SHERIFF
What're you doing?
WAYNE
We got too many bodies with bullets
in 'em.
(nods at Karen)
I'm gonna put her in her house, make
it look like she fell down the stairs
and drowned.
PHIL
Don't you touch her!
WAYNE
Saving her life... Hmm... You know,
that might have actually gotten you
laid.
SHERIFF
Oh, for Christsakes, just dump her
here.
WAYNE
We got a few minutes before Hank
gets back.
SHERIFF
Just dump her here!
Wayne ignores the Sheriff and motors off.
SHERIFF
Wayne! Goddamnit, we've gotta get
them outta there! Wayne!
But Wayne keeps going.
Hank motors up to the Sheriff and Phil.
HANK
Where's Wayne going?
SHERIFF
On a date. You all set?
HANK
Yeah, but --
SHERIFF
Then let's go.
HANK
Aren't we gonna wait for Wayne?
SHERIFF
We can get started without him, the
dumb shit. He won't be long. Besides,
we got Phil. Phil's gonna earn his
money on this, aren't you Phil?
Phil looks scared shitless.
Water continues to pour over the top. CLOSE ON CONCRETE
Chunks of cement are starting to wash away.
The Sheriff, Phil and Hank heave the flaming Molotov
cocktails.
THE ROOF
The bottles hit, explode. Sheets of fire rain down the roof.
ONE BOTTLE
Smashes through a window.
The roof is on fire.
Modest, two-story, on a side street. The front door is open;
the boat tied up outside. There's a light on in the front
hall.
The church roof is on fire.
THE SHERIFF, PHIL AND HANK
Are across the street.
The Sheriff is getting very agitated.
SHERIFF
They're not coming out, Hank!
HANK
The fire's not catching. The rain's
too --
SHERIFF
We have to get them! We have to kill
them! Do you understand? If they're
not dead, we got jack shit!
Water is cascading over the top of the dam. Chunks of concrete
are washing away.
A large V is being cut in the top of the dam by the raging
water.
A QUARTER-MILE AWAY
Looking back at the dam. The line of lights on top of the
dam start to fall over, then go dark, snuffed out by an unseen
force.
The Sheriff's boat comes onto Main Street, moving fast.
IN THE BOAT
Hank is looking back, in the direction the flood will come.
HANK
We gotta go faster!
SHERIFF
Yeah, you're right.
The Sheriff pushes Hank out of the boat.
HANK
Goes skipping over the water and slams into a streetlight
post.
The damaged ski-boat that Jim and Tom took to the church has
slipped off the sandbag wall and is drifting. A peaceful
scene. But then, from the distance, comes a rushing roar.
Hank, groggy in the water, also hears the distant roar.
Hank unwraps himself from around the lamp post. He looks
back.
HIS POV
Streetlights in the distance, winking out one by one, marking
the advance of the wall of water.
HANK
Oh my God.
Hank looks around for safety. He sees it.
HIS POV
There's an alleyway.
HANK
Swims for the alley.
Roars through the town, pushing a rolling wave of debris,
obliterating anything in its path.
Hank swims into the alley. Hank looks for something to climb
up on, to hold onto. There's...
FIRE ESCAPE LADDER
At the end of the alley.
HANK
Swims for it. He hears the rushing roar of the advancing
flood. He expects the flood to blow by the end of the alley.
Wrong.
WALL OF WATER
Comes into the alley, banking high on the far wall before
coming down and barreling toward Hank. And what makes it
worse for Hank is that there's...
A CAR
At the front of the wave, being pushed by the water.
HANK
Dives clear just as...
THE CAR
Smashes into the wall, right where Hank had just been.
HANK
Relief in his eyes. He gets to the fire escape and is climbing
to safety when...
PROPANE TANK
Comes into the alley, rolling in the flood, spraying propane
from a torn hose. It explodes.
HANK
Barely has time to scream.
The house has been hit by the flood. It's being pulled by
the massive current, stretching overhead phone and power
lines.
The house is carried on the current, turning in the water.
IN THE KITCHEN
Tom watches, astounded, as the room starts to turn around
him. He kicks fast for the door to...
THE LIVING ROOM
Tom swims in, fast, toward the stairs when...
A WINDOW
Caves in and...
HUGE TREE BRANCH
Smashes in, filling the room, blocking Tom's route to the
stairs.
TOM
Tries to get through the tangle of branches and leaves, but
can't. He swims over to another window and slides it up.
KAREN
Keeps looking down for Tom.
The house is impaled on a tree, the current sluicing around
it.
TOM
Surfaces near the side of the house, gasping. The current
starts ripping him past the house. He swims as hard as he
can back to the house, reaches out and grabs onto a gutter.
The water swirls through the branches of a half-submerged
tree.
HENRY AND DOREEN
Are in the tree. Henry is either unconscious or dead. Doreen
cradles him.
DOREEN
Come on, Henry. Forget that "Go to
the light" crap. Come back to me.
You're all I've got.
And Henry starts to come to.
DOREEN
Oh, Henry. Thank God.
Henry opens his eyes.
HENRY
Next time, when I say "Let's
evacuate," we're gonna evacuate.
DOREEN
Whatever you say, honey.
She hugs him tight and after a beat he hugs her back.
Tom and Karen swim out of a second floor window, grab the
rain gutter. Tom pulls himself onto the roof then grabs Karen
and helps her up. They crawl until they're clear of the edge.
Only the sloped roof of the house is visible in the swirling
water. They are just catching their breath when they are hit
by...
BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT
And they look to see...
THE SHERIFF
In his boat, shining a searchlight on them with one hand, a
gun in the other. He starts shooting.
TOM AND KAREN
Tom pushes Karen toward the peak of the roof as the bullets
plug in around them. Tom pushes Karen over the top then turns
and dives off the roof and into the water.
KAREN
Hears an engine behind her and turns.
A BOAT
Racing toward the house. It's...
THE SKI-BOAT
And at the controls is...
JIM
Barely alive.
THE OUTBOARD MOTOR
Is wobbling, vibrating at the back of the boat, almost loose
from its moorings.
JIM'S POV
He sees Karen, crouched below the peak of the house, a bright
light coming from the other side along with gunshots.
JIM
Pushes the throttle all the way forward.
THE SKI-BOAT
Shoots forward.
UNDERWATER
Tom swims hard toward the Sheriff's boat.
THE SHERIFF
Is shooting down into the water at Tom's moving shape.
THE SKI-BOAT
With Jim at the wheel, comes racing straight toward the house.
KAREN
Thinks he's going to turn.
KAREN
No! No!
THE SKI-BOAT
Doesn't turn.
KAREN
Rolls to the side, just getting clear as...
THE SKI-BOAT
Hits the sloping roof of Karen's house and ramps up it.
THE OUTBOARD MOTOR
Digs into the shingles of the roof and tears free from the
back of the boat.
THE SHERIFF
Hears the sound and looks up as...
THE SKI-BOAT
Comes over the peak of the roof.
TOM
Surfaces to see...
THE SKI-BOAT
Fly right over him, heading straight for...
THE SHERIFF
Who ducks down, just in time as...
THE SKI-BOAT
Misses him, landing just past him in the water.
THE SHERIFF
Straightens up, grinning with glee that the boat missed him.
And then he hears a piercing whine coming from behind him.
He turns, just in time to see...
THE OUTBOARD MOTOR
Flipping end over end, propeller whirring, heading straight
for him.
THE SHERIFF
Starts to scream.
CLOSE ON KAREN
Looking over the peak of the roof in horror. She hears the
Sheriff's scream and the scream of the propeller and then a
horrible ugly ripping and both screams stop.
THE SHERIFF'S BOAT
The Sheriff is gone. The side has been smashed out of the
boat and the boat is flooding with water.
THE SHERIFF
Is just some misshapen thing trailing red, floating in the
water.
JIM
Tries to restart the ski-boat but it's dead. He slumps
forward.
TOM
Sees Jim slump against the side of the boat.
TOM
You okay?
JIM
Fine.
Tom can tell Jim's anything but. Tom swims for the boat.
THE BOAT
Tom swims up, pulls himself in. He pulls Jim back off the
controls, sees the blood.
TOM
Oh, God. We gotta get you to --
Jim looks at Tom. Tom understands -- Jim's not going anywhere.
TOM
Thanks.
JIM
For what?
TOM
You just saved our lives.
JIM
I did? I just came for the money.
Tom looks at Jim -- he knows Jim's lying.
KAREN (O.S.)
Do you need any help?
JIM
(grabs Tom's arm)
No. Tell her to stay back.
TOM
(to Karen)
It's okay!
Jim lets go of Tom.
JIM
You're going to turn it in?
TOM
Sorry to disappoint you.
JIM
Well, hell, then I guess I better
take it after all. I figure the
river'll carry me down to the Gulf
of Mexico. If I catch the right
currents, maybe I'll end up in...
Belize?
(Tom nods)
You come look me up. I'll buy you a
drink.
TOM
I'll do that.
Jim grimaces as he's hit by a wave of pain. He looks away.
JIM
Go.
Tom hesitates for a second.
JIM
Please.
Tom turns and slides into the water and swims away.
JIM
Son, don't think too badly of your
Uncle Charlie. He always said you
were capable of remarkable things.
(beat)
He was right.
There's a last look between Jim and Tom, then Tom swims away.
JIM
(smiles)
The rain's stopped.
(breathes deep)
The air after a rain...
Jim slowly topples forward and is still.
TOM
Swims through the swirling current toward Karen's roof.
JIM'S BOAT
Sinks below the surface and is gone.
TOM AND KAREN
Karen is down at the water's edge with her arm extended to
Tom. Tom grabs it, and as Karen pulls...
MATCH CUT TO:
Karen pulls Tom up onto scaffolding running along the edge
of the new roof under construction. Tom holds a paper bag.
He's wearing work gear -- tool belt, work boots, etc. Tom
looks at the work being done on the roof.
TOM
They got a lot done today.
KAREN
It's coming along.
(re: bag)
What'd you get?
TOM
Barbecue chicken from Lilly's.
KAREN
Yum.
TOM
You want some? I wish you'd told me.
I woulda got more.
KAREN
Ha ha.
And as they sit down and start to eat, the camera begins to
PULL BACK.
TOM
I talked to Mikey. He says the
flooring should be in by Friday.
KAREN
That's what he said last week.
TOM
I said if it wasn't here by Friday
at six that you were going to go
over and beat the crap out of him.
KAREN
And I will.
