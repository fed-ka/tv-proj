      MADDY, SHANNON, TOM, RHYDIAN, CERI

      A small stream in the woods.  Trees and bushes cluster 
      thickly along the bank: ideal cover&

      With a SHRIEK of delight, SHANNON SWINGS ACROSS THE STREAM on 
      a rope suspended from an ancient oak.  She lands safely -

                                  MADDY
                    Go, Shannon!

                                  TOM
                    My turn.

      Even RHYDIAN s applauding.  

      She swings the rope back, TOM catches it.  Makes a comedy 
      routine out of spitting on his hands, psyching himself up as 
      if this was some impossible feat -

      But as he swings out over the stream, SOMETHING RUSTLES in 
      the bushes.  TOM looks towards the movement - his grip slips - 

      And he falls into the stream!

                                  MADDY
                    Tom!

                                    SHANNON
                    You all right?

                                  TOM
                    Someone s there!

      Scrambling upright, dripping, he points into the thicket:

                                  TOM (CONT D)
                    Someone s spying on us!

      A HOODED FIGURE: can t tell if it s male or female, let alone 
      who it is.  Then the bush RUSTLES, and the figure is gone.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      SHANNON crouches to examine broken and trampled twigs. 

                                    SHANNON
                    This is where he was standing.

      TOM, MADDY and RHYDIAN stop a couple of paces back, wary of 
      trampling the evidence.

                    So was he spying on us?

                    How am I supposed to tell that from 
                    a few broken twigs?  Come on, let s 
                    get out of here&

      She leaves, followed by TOM.  MADDY and RHYDIAN hang back -
      just long enough to SNIFF THE AIR and catch a SCENT TRAIL.  

                                    RHYDIAN

      JIMI, SAM, LIAM and some other FOOTBALL TEAM MEMBERS are 
      having a kick-around.  Meanwhile, TOM talks to SHANNON.

      The girls gather round to discuss, now ignoring TOM.

      Meanwhile, the kick-around culminates in SAM taking a kick at 
      goal.  LIAM, the goalie, jumps the wrong way.  GROANS from 
      the team.  LIAM scrambles to his feet, furious -

                    playing the right position, you d

                    pull yourselves together!  Tom!

      TOM runs over to join in as the kick-around begins again.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      The kick-around s still going on.  MADDY and RHYDIAN, deep in 
        conversation, watch idly.

                                    RHYDIAN*
                    If she can hide from us when she *
                    wants, then when we see her -*

                                  MADDY*
                    It s because she wants us to.*

      TOM kicks the ball hard, clearing it away from goal.  But 
      he s kicked it much too high.  It soars straight towards the 
      school building - and a large window!

      TOM gulps, just waiting for the glass to shatter&

      But the ball s passing over RHYDIAN s head.  He jumps -

      And just gets a hand to the ball.  Deflected, it bounces 
      harmlessly off the wall.   

      But suddenly the whole team are STARING AT HIM!

                    Sam.  Go fetch Miss Graham.

      RHYDIAN looks round in alarm.  What did he just do?

      MISS GRAHAM watches JIMI line up a penalty kick.  SAM, LIAM, 
      and TOM look on.  A slightly confused RHYDIAN is in goal.

      MADDY and the 3Kswatch from the sidelines.  Other PUPILS 
      have drifted up here too, wondering what s going on. 

                                  JIMI
                    All you have to do is stop the ball 
                    going in the net. 

                                    RHYDIAN

                                  TOM
                    Just play along, mate.  

      JIMI takes the penalty kick - Rhydian doesn t move, the ball 
      goes into the back of the net.

                                  JIMI
                    Didn t you hear what I said? Stop 
                    the ball. Or are you too cool to 
                    dive?

                                    RHYDIAN
                    Do it again.

                                  JIMI
                    Don t want to embarrass you.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    Just do it again. Please.

                                  MISS GRAHAM
                    Jimi, take the penalty.

      Kicking the ball towards the top corner.  No one s going to 
      be able to save that.

      But RHYDIAN jumps/dives like he has springs on his feet - and 
      saves it one-handed.

      Grinning from ear to ear, JIMI turns to MISS GRAHAM:

                                  JIMI

      But he s swallowed up by the celebrating team, who slap him 
      on the back and welcome him aboard.  Doesn t look like 
      they re taking  no  for an answer!

                    No one s expecting that.  Well, 
                    maybe they are.  But you can t be

      TOM fumbles to explain his philosophy of football - and life.

                                  TOM
                    On the field, all the stuff you re 
                    not good at, the people you don t 
                    get on with, fade away.  You re

      RHYDIAN, CERI

      RHYDIAN walks home through the woods, rucksack on his back, 
      boots in them.  Everything s right with the world.

      But things are catching his attention.  A RUSTLE among the 
      leaves; the SNAP of a breaking branch; 

      He slows down, moving more softly, trying not to rustle the 
      dead leaves or snap any twigs.

      He turns on his WOLF-HEARING. He hears movement.  Parallel to 
      him, keeping pace, but hidden in the trees.  

      There s someone here.

      RHYDIAN stops, half-closing his eyes: letting his Wolfblood 
      senses take over.  We sense things the way he does -

      EVERY SOUND MAGNIFIED - the distant STREAM like a waterfall, 
      we can even hear the hum of that INSECT over there -

      A SNAPPING TWIG.

      And out of nowhere, SOMEONE s standing RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM!

      Still working on instinct, RHYDIAN JUMPS BACK, putting 
      distance between them - his mouth forms a defensive SNARL -

      But CERI (36) - straggle-haired, torn clothes, looks like 
      she s lived rough forever - simply stares at him.

      Her intensity, her obvious amazement as she looks him over 
      rings bells in RHYDIAN s head.  He half-knows where this is 
      going, who she s going to turn out to be, and that just makes 
      him ever more angry -

                                    RHYDIAN
                    What d youwant?  Who are you?

                                  CERI
                    I m your mother.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    I don t have a&  You re not, you 
                    can t be&  

      He can t breathe.  He takes a step back - the world is

                      aggressively in midfield.  Right.

      Everyone s moving to positions.  Except one person, lost in

      RHYDIAN stands in the goal.  LIAM takes a corner.  JIMI leaps 
      and heads the ball.  It hits RHYDIAN, bounces off - and TOM 
      scores.

                                  MISS GRAHAM
                      Concentrate, Rhydian!

      LIAM retakes the corner. The ball bounces off someone, 
      trickling past RHYDIAN, who hasn t moved.

                    Good idea.  With him in goal, we re 
                    going to need them.

      This is the Wolfblood version of astral projection.  He can 
      see and hear EVERYTHING.

      At first, just an overview, an aerial photograph from a high 
        perspective, with an overlay of every noise for miles - wind, 
      animal noise, burbling streams -

      But as he concentrates on a feature, it suddenly leaps into 
      SHARP CLOSE-UP. The stream flowing in the moon light.

      ON RHYDIAN -

      As he realises what he s doing, what he s sensing.  The most 
      wonderful thing he s ever felt.

      MADDY has stopped taking photos for a moment.  Watching 
      RHYDIAN in the goal.

      Suddenly the REFEREE BLOWS his whistle.

                                    SHANNON
                    It s over!  Yaaay!

                    It s half-time.

      SHANNON groans.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      The second half. More football seen through photos taken by 
      Maddy.  Players attacking in the opposite direction.  Some 
      close calls, but no goals.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      REFEREE, MADDY

      MADDY takes a photo, checks her watch.

                                  MADDY
                    The ninety minutes are up.

                                    SHANNON
                            (tortured)
                    So why are they still playing?

                                  MADDY
                    Injury time.

                                    SHANNON
                    Are we winning?

                                  MADDY
                    It s nil-nil.  Have you even been 
                    watching?

      The REFEREE blows his whistle, points to the penalty spot!  
      BOOs and SHOUTING from the home crowd.  JIMI and his team 
      look worried.

      SHANNON applauds, sure it s all over, until MADDY glares-

                                  MADDY (CONT D)
                    It s a penalty kick!

                                    SHANNON
                    Is that good?

                                  MADDY
                    No!  Baron s Mill should score and 
                    win the match.

                                    SHANNON
                    Right.  Penalty kick, bad.  I can t 
                      actually feel my feet any more.

      Both teams clear out of the penalty area as the opposing 
      team s STRIKERreadies himself to take the kick.  

      It s one on one: him against RHYDIAN.  

      RHYDIAN takes a deep breath.  Focusing with all his Wolfblood 
      senses on the ball, on the striker - the sound of the 
      CHEERING CROWD DROPS AWAY-

      The STRIKER is in SLO-MOas he runs at the ball - he kicks -
      the ball soars towards what looks like an open goal -

      RHYDIAN leaps like he s never leapt before - and saves it!

      Back to NORMAL MOTION and NORMAL SOUND as the crowd go wild! 
      Even SHANNON jumps up and down beside the ecstatic MADDY:

                                    SHANNON (CONT D)
                    Yes!

                                  MADDY
                    Wooo, Rhydian!

      The striker just stands there - how on earth did the goalie 
      save that?  The 3KSbreak out their best routine -

      But play continues!  TOM s up the field, waving for the ball.

      RHYDIAN throws the ball to him - TOM takes possession, the 
      opposing team scramble to catch up, but it's too late -

                                  MISS GRAHAM
                    Go on, Tom!

      TOM dribbles past a tackling defender, takes the kick-

      ANDscores the winning goal!  Hysteria from the home crowd as 
      the whistle blows.  SAM leaps off the subs bench, ecstatic.  

      The REFEREE BLOWS HIS WHISTLE.  The game s over.

      SPECTATORS invade the pitch to congratulate TOM and RHYDIAN -

      Almost trampling the 3KS, who abandon their routine in a 
      temper tantrum as they realiseno one s watching anyway&

        Congratulations for TOM, the goal-scorer: but everyone s 
      going nuts over RHYDIAN.  He s hoisted onto the team s 
      shoulders and carried off the pitch in triumph.

      RHYDIAN looks around the crowd: MR. JEFFRIES applauding him, 
      genuinely pleased that the  bad boy  has come good -

      A proud JIMI.  SHANNON, cheering.  A grinning TOM. 

      MADDY, smiling bravely at him as she lines up one final 
      photo.

      We end the scene on her PHOTO - RHYDIAN and TOM, surrounded 
      by team-mates and fans, joint heroes of the hour.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      RHYIAN, MADDY, CERI

      RHYDIAN emerges from the changing rooms.  MADDY is waiting 
      for him.

                                  MADDY
                    Hey, it s the Man Of The Match.

                                    RHYDIAN
                            (actually, he s loving it)
                    Tom scored the winner.  I ve never 
                    seen him so happy.

                                  MADDY
                    I ve never seen youthat happy.  
                    Not in human form, anyway. 

                                    RHYDIAN
                    It was a buzz.  Winning. Being part 
                    of the team - 

                                  MADDY
                    Belonging somewhere.

      RHYDIAN agrees, knows exactly what she means and where she s 
      going, but he plays it cool:

                                    RHYDIAN
                      I guess.

                                  MADDY
                    You know, it s not too late to 
                    change your mind.

      They re almost at the school buildings - and a figure is 
      waiting in the mouth of an alley between buildings.

      It s CERI.

                                  MADDY (CONT D)
                    Or is this where I say goodbye?

                                    RHYDIAN
                    It s my choice, Maddy.

      MADDY gets upset.

                                  MADDY
                    I hate goodbyesanyway.

      She hurries off.  RHYDIAN watches her go.  Torn.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      RHYDIAN, CERI, TOM, *

      An alley, a patch of dead space between two buildings.  CERI 
      paces, agitated, as RHYDIAN approaches.

                                  CERI
                    We should be gone by now.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    I said I d meet you when I was 
                    finished.  

                                  CERI
                      Finished what?

                                    RHYDIAN
                    Playing football.  Did you watch?

      CERI looks at him like he s crazy.  Of course not.

                                  CERI
                    I don t watch humans playing their 
                    games.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    You should have.  Then you might 
                        understand...why I can t come with 
                    you.

      CERI s genuinely shocked.  

                                  CERI
                    You want to stay here-?

                                    RHYDIAN
                    It might be a game but I was part 
                    of something.  Something I was good 
                    at, something I wanted - not 
                    something I was born into. It was 
                    my choice.

      CERI s eyes flash YELLOW - real anger at his stupid decision&

                                  CERI
                    I m offering you freedom!  The 
                    Wolfblood life!

                                    RHYDIAN
                    There isno  Wolfblood life !  We 
                    all get to choose how we live - and 
                    I can t live like you.  Maybe if 
                    you stay, we can see each other -

                                  CERI
                    Did she do this?  Your tame wolf 
                    friend -

                                    RHYDIAN
                    Don t you evercall Maddy tame.

      CERI snarls - her head drops, her hands form claws, we think 
      she s about to take wolf form and attack&!

      But RHYDIAN stands firm, defying her.  CERI knows she s lost 
      this fight before it even starts.   This has devastated her.

                                  CERI
                    She s corrupted you - I m your 
                    mother -

                                    RHYDIAN
                    - Who wasn t there.

      CERI, rather then allow her distress to show, turns and leaps 
      the perimeter wall at the end of the alley in a single bound - 
      and she s gone.  RHYDIAN stares after her.  Shaken-up.

                                  TOM  (O.S.)
                      Rhydian?

      RHYDIAN swings round.  TOM appears.

                                  TOM (CONT D)
                    Who were you talking to?

                                    RHYDIAN
                    No one.   I thought you d gone to 
                      Bernies.

                                  TOM
                    I decided to come back for our man 
                    of the match.   Shannon said she d 
                    meet us up there.

                                    RHYDIAN
                    Cool.

      They start walking off.  

                                                                            CUT TO:


      MADDY, RHYDIAN. TOM

      MADDY brooding, tearful.  She senses something. Sniffs.  
      Rhydian s scent trail wafts up her nose.  She turns.   

      Sees TOM and RHYDIAN walking out the gates.  Amazing.

                                  MADDY
                      Rhydian!

      TOM and RHYDIAN stop. She runs towards them. 

                                    RHYDIAN
                    We re going up to Bernies!  You 
                      coming?!

      MADDY runs between them, looping her arms through theirs.
