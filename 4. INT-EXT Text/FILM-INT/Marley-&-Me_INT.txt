Sebastian is obviously the passenger shooting John, who's
driving.
SEBASTIAN
(ON TAPE)
All right, I'm zooming in. Whoa. Not
a flosser.
JOHN
Turn it off.
And as he REACHES for it - WHAM'. He hits another car! The
camera goes flying. Fumbles. SCREAMS. YELLS.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Jesus Christ!
SEBASTIAN
They're okay! They're getting out.
Sebastian manages to right the CAMERA and unsteadily films
John getting out of the car, heading towards the car he hit.
The passenger door opens and Jenny comes out. She's covered
in frosting and the remains of a birthday cake which she was
carrying in her lap. The damaged car is full of balloons.
JENNY
Are you a complete idiot?!
SEBASTIAN (O.S.)
And so one of the truly great love
affairs of the late eighties began.
In the home video, Jenny advances on John, hurls the rest of
the cake at him, starts flailing at him with her hands.

The driver of the car, another co-ed, gets out and yells at

SEBASTIAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Although, technically, they didn't work
together so much as John worked for
Jenny who was the editor of said
paper...
SHOT OF JENNY AND JOHN KISSING
In her office, through the semi-closed Venetian blinds.
SEBASTIAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Let's just say there were some flagrant

CONTINUE PULLING BACK TO REVEAL...
The two of them sit on the edge of the bathtub, soaking their
sore feet. Jenny's still in her wedding dress, bunched up so
as not to get it wet. John has got the pant legs of his tux
rolled up.
Jenny takes a swig from a bottle of champagne, passes it to
John. He looks at her.
JOHN
How do I get vou?
JENNY
What?
JOHN
I'm serious. In what world does a guy
like me get someone like you?
JENNY
Are you kidding?
(leans on him)
You're part of the plan.
JOHN
The plan.

Now that one's a surprise...
They kiss and as we push past them, into the snowy window, we

Oh yeah.
She turns to John.

JOHN
I know, I got it.
JENNY
Who are you?
JOHN
I'm John Grogan.
JENNY
Wrong. You're John Friggin Grogan
who's about to get a job.
She leans over and gives him a big, long kiss.
JOHN
Um, okay, see now I don't wanna get out
of the car.
JENNY
JOHN
JOHN
i really just wanna sit here and make
out with you.
JENNY
--Get out of the car.
He nods, starts to get out, then pauses.
JOHN
Who am i again?
(QUICKLY)
Kidding.
ARNIE KLEIN -- fifties, never smiles, flowered shirts -- the
editor of the Sun-Sentinel of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, is
flipping through John's portfolio.
JOHN
Yes, sir, I got a Mitchy.

ARNIE
A Mitchy. Min-hmm. So, tell me, why
did you want to leave the estimable -
(he flips to a story, reads
THE HEADING)
- Kalamazoo Gazette?
JOHN
Well, as you know, Sebastian and I were
in college together, and he was always
talking about South Florida... mostly
about the women of South Florida, but
anyway, after my wife and I got married
we thought it might be nice to come
DOWN HERE--
ARNIE
For the women?
JOHN
Uh, no-- for the... the... uh...
ARNIE
For the work?
JOHN
Yes. That.
ARNIE
Your wife's Jenny Havens, right?
JOHN
Well, Jenny Grogan now--
ARNIE
She take the job at the Post?
JOHN
YEAH--
ARNIE
I tried to get her over her

What's the matter, the Post didn't want
Yo m?
JOHN
Well, she does features. I'm more a
straight news writer. This is a better
paper for that.
ARNIE
Straight news writer, huh. Meaning you
think you're a reporter?
JOHN
Meaning I know I am.
ARNIE
And the six other sweaty-palmed college
grads I'm interviewing today, you think
you're better than them?
JOHN
No, sir. In fact, I'm pretty sure I'm
not. But I do know that I always seem
to surprise myself. Ten years ago, I
was doing bong hits and playing Donkey
Kong, never dreamed I'd get into
college. But I did, and I graduated
with honors. Two years ago, my buddies
told me that the most Jenny Havens
would ever say to me was, You're sweet,
but I don't like you in that way.. But
she did like me in that way-- and my
buddies can suck it because I married
her. I certainly never thought I'd win
some award with a dumbass name--
ARNIE
(POINTING)
The "Mitchy."
JOHN
(POINTING BACK)
Exactly sir. But i surprised myself
and I won it. And if you give me the
chance, I'm pretty sure I'll surprise
you, too.
Arnie considers him a moment.
ARNIE
That's quite a speech, son. You
rehearse that, or come up with it on
the fly?

JOHN
Elevator, on the way up.
(THEN)
How'd I do?
Arnie just looks back at him.
Jenny is writing in her NOTEBOOK when we see John crossing
the street through the passenger window. She looks at him.
Afraid to ask.
JENNY
So?
JOHN
He's got me on a little thing they like
to call... Desert Storm--
JENNY
YOU GOT THE JOB!
She gets out of the car and the two embrace right there on
the street. She takes out her notebook, crosses something
off on her "list."
JENNY (CONT'D)
okay... "Jobs." Done.
JOHN
So what's next? Lunch?
JENNY
(KISSES HIM)
House.
News footage of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on television. John
and Jenny sit at the table reading a different newspapers. He
glances at her...
JOHN
You like the quote about the speed
bumps?

JENNY

"If they save even one life--"
JOHN
-"it would be worth it. And with that,
Janet Dickerson's mother's eyes filled
with tears."
(THEN)
That one just felt exactly right,
y'know?
JENNY
Yeah, no, it's good. What happened to
the Desert Storm piece?
JOHN
That's it. The injured girl's dad's in
Kuwait. What, that's not in there?
JENNY
(looks at the article)
Uhhhh... they must've cut it... And
they kinda misspelled your name. John
Egan...
JOHN
What-- you're kidding--
He reaches for the paper, but she holds it away.
JENNY
Forget it. It's good, John. It's got
facts, some color. It's a solid piece.
JOHN
Thanks. I'm almost done with yours.
This idea of voting machines sounds
REALLY EFFICIENT--
JENNY
Well, except on the other page I talk
about what could happen--
He goes back to reading. She sips her coffee.
JOHN
Oh, it continues...
An awkward moment as he now searches for the new page, has to
fold back the paper. No escaping the fact that ie article is
longer and more important than his. She finally gets up...

17 CONTINUED: (2)
JENNY
You know what? The rest is just okay,
really pretty boring...
JOHN
No, no, I'm enjoying it...
He tortures himself and keeps reading. She moves to the sink,
starts to rinse out her cup...
JOHN (CONT'D)
Wow, they really gave you a lot of
space, didn't they?
She sets the cup on the counter, looks at the WILTED PLANT on
the sill.
JENNY
Damn. I killed another one. How am I
ever going to take care of a kid, I
can't even keep a plant alive?
John looks up from the paper. "Kid?" She comes gives him a
kiss.
JENNY (CONT'D)
I'll see you later, Mr. Gorgan.
She headsout, leaving John staring terrified at the plant.
SEBASTIAN (V.0.)
A kid, huh...

John is leading Jenny, her eyes closed, through a house
towards the kitchen. LORI, 55, leathery and smoking, is
going in front.
LORI
Sorry about the smell.
JENNY
When can I look?
JOHN
Just hang on...
Lori opens a door to a laundry room.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Okay. Now.
Jenny opens her eyes and sees a utility room. Nine yellow
yipping Lab puppies tumble out of a cardboard box towards
John and Jenny.

JOHN (CONT'D)
Happy Birthday.
JENNY
Oh my God... they're adorable...
(THEN)
Wait a minute, my birthday's a month
from now.
LORI
That's okay, they can't leave for
another three weeks anyway.
JENNY
John, we never even talked about this.
JOHN
You're right. Let's go.
He's kidding. And besides, Jenny's already on the floor,
letting the puppies climb all over her.
JENNY
Look at you guys...
LORI
I got papers on the mom and the dad, so
you can register these.
JOHN
Is the father here too?
LORI
(HESITATING BRIEFLY)
Oh, yeah, somewhere. Anyway, girls are
$400, boys are $375. Except this
little guy here.
AND
She points to one male puppy, who is clearly the goofiest
most excited.
LORI (CONT'D)
You can have him for $325.
JENNY
How sweet. He's on clearance...
LORI
Well, he's a little too stocky for the
breed, so he probably won't show.
JENNY
He's so sweet...

JOHN
He likes you.
JENNY
John, I don't know if I'm ready for a
PUPPY--
LORI
You have to wait three weeks for the
litter to get weaned, before you can
bring 'em home anyway.
JOHN
Plenty of time to get ready.
JENNY
I won't even be here. I'm gonna be with
my sister then...
JOHN
No problem. I can take him. Be good
bonding time. Get him all trained in
time for you to come home.
A chuckle from Lori.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Let's give 'em all the scare test.
LORI
(STOPS CHUCKLING)
The what?
JOHN
I hear the best dog in the litter is
the one who doesn't spook easily. They
turn out to be the most people-
centered.
LORI
(SLIGHTLY WORRIED)
Uh, how are you gonna--
John turns away, and then suddenly turns back with a loud
step and a "BOO"! All of the puppies scatter. Lily barks.
But Clearance Puppy just leaps onto his shoes, his tail
wagging.
LORI (CONT'D)
Well, that's your guy.
John scoops him up. Clearance Puppy licks his face. John
hands him to Jenny. She lets him lick her face...
19.
20 CONTINUED: (3) 20
JENNY
I would've picked you anyway--
JOHN
Meant to be.
He watches her cuddle the puppy and knows he's done the right
thing.
John and the puppy on the drive home. The puppy atop a pile
of towels. John looks at him.
JOHN
Hey... guy.
The dog just stares at him quizzically. Uncomfortable alone
with the dog, John turns on the radio. BOB MARLEY plays and
the puppy THUMPS HIS TAIL.
21.
24
24 CONTINUED:
JOHN (CONT'D)
You like Bob Marley?
The dog THUMPS HIS TAIL AGAIN. John turns up the music.
THUMP. THUMP. THUMP faster this time.
JOHN (CONT'D)
GOOD BOY--
(trying it out)
Bob?
(nothing, then)
Marley.
THUMP THUMP THUMP.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Marley. Okay-- Marley. Cool.
But now the pup starts wriggling towards John, John tries to
put him back...
JOHN (CONT'D)
No-- stay boy... stay.
(the dog crawls into his lap)
Okay, not really safe, bud--
Marley gets stuck with half his body draped over the console.
He remains like this, his tail thumping... John gives up.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Alright, fine, but just this time.
THUMP. THUMP.
25
As John crouches down, shows him his bowls...
JOHN
This one's water. This one's food.
22.
26 CONTINUED: 26
Marley starts pawing the food bag.
JOHN (CONT'D)
C'mon, man, you've already had kibble
and half a seat belt.
(moment, relents)
All right. Special treat. But just
today...
He opens the bag and Marley tackles it. Several cupfuls
spill onto the floor. John goes to the pantry to get the
dustpan and brush. When he returns, he finds Marley has
eaten the food in the bowl AND every last scrap of spilled
food. And now he's squatting to pee again...
JOHN (CONT'D)
No, no, no!
He picks up the puppy and rushes him outside.
Jenny's on the phone. Her young NIECE and NEPHEW wait for
her, a board game on the floor between them. She motions
that she'll just be a second...
23.
28
28 CONTINUED:
JENNY
Marley. I like that...
John's on the phone, talking to Jenny as he follows Marley
around the room, trying to keep shoes and socks and cords out
of his mouth...
JOHN
Are you sure? Because it can be
temporary...
INTERCUTTING: JOHN & JENNY
JENNY
No, it's good.
(THEN)
He must be exhausted.
JOHN
Oh, yeah, he's pooped.
Marley lets out a SQUEAK as he tugs at a couch cushion...
JENNY
(HEARS IT)
Oh, he sounds so sweet!
JOHN
Yeah...
(snapping his fingers at the
dog, shaking his head "no")
He's very cute. Just like a little kid
only furrier.
JENNY
Put the phone by his ear...
John chases after the dog who burrows under the couch, his
tail sticking out so that John can't get him...
JOHN
Uh, okay, he's listening.
John just holds the phone awkwardly as Jenny coos baby talk.
JENNY
(into the phone)
Hey, Marley! Who's my good boy?!
Mommy can't wait to meet you...
24.
29
29 CONTINUED:
JOHN
Anyway, don't worry, he's doing great.
Like he's lived here his whole life.
All eight weeks of it. And you know
what else? I think he's going to be
pretty easy to train. I mean, he's
curious which means he's smart, right?
JENNY
Of course he is. I can't wait to see
him.
JOHN
Just him?
JENNY
Jealous?
JOHN
I'm not the one sleeping in a box.
JENNY
I love you. I'll see you Friday.
John, dressed to go out, is setting down Marley in his wooden
box on the garage floor.
JOHN
I'll see you in the morning, okay?
Marley looks at him with a heartbreaking expression. John
hesitates.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Aw, come on, don't. You'll be fine,
alright. And tomorrow, we're gonna
tear it up. I'm thinking kibble, park,
chew toy, the whole nine yards. Okay?
we good?
Marley doesn't-look so good, looks kind of sad. John turns
and gets out of there.
Journalist hang out.'John and Sebastian at the bar. Many know
Sebastian, he's constantly nodding at people throughout:
SEBASTIAN
So I'm there in this cave, right?
Blindfolded. And I can feel the
machine guns, there's like nine of 'em
around me... and they tie me to a chair
and then Escobar comes in and says--
are you ready?
(SPANISH ACCENT)
I read your piece on Kadahfi, And I
think you captured his narcissism just
right.
(LAUGHS)
Can you believe that?
JOHN
Some of it.
SEBASTIAN
Man, I wish you could've been there.
JOHN
Yeah, but then I wouldn't have been
able to do the piece on the water main
break at the library. That would have
sucked.
SEBASTIAN
(hand on John's shoulder)
Your time will come, amigo.
JOHN
I'll drink to that--
They toast with their beers, Sebastian clocks John looking at
his watch.
SEBASTIAN
You gotta be somewhere?
JOHN
Oh. No, it's the puppy. It's his first
NIGHT ALONE--
SEBASTIAN
You got adoc?
26.
32
32 CONTINUED:
JOHN
Marley. A little lab. Like you said.
Remember? The bomb...
SEBASTIAN
Oh, right. Smart move. You'll see.
(slaps him on the back)
You've just preserved your quiet way of
life for at least another two years.
33
The door opens and the puppy gets excited--
JOHN
No no... I just wanted you to know I'm
back.
The puppy whimpers and he goes over to him, reaches into the
box and pets him...
JOHN (CONT'D)
Buddy, you really gotta chill, okay?
Yeah, I know, good to see you, too.
But I'm just inside the house, I'll see
you in the morning. Big day tomorrow.
Get some sleep.
John gulps orange juice from the bottle. Leaves a quarter-
inch, puts it back in the fridge. And now we hear BARKING
from the Garage.
27.
Water running. John swallows some preventative aspirin,
picks some nachos off his shirt. He turns off the water.
And we hear WAILING and KEENING coming from the garage.
John has his head buried under the pillows AS THE WAILING AND
KEENING GO ON. AND ON. AND ON. Finally, John can't take it
anymore. He sits up, pulls earplugs out of his ears.
38
As the light comes on and Marley's head appears over the top
of the box. John sighs, comes over and scoops him up...
John gets Marley settled in the box, now by the side of the
bed.
JOHN
Just this one time.
John climbs into bed, shuts off the light. Marley whimpers
and John rolls onto his stomach, reaches into the box and
strokes his back, the puppy lays down, still whimpers...
JOHN (CONT'D)
Oh, come on...
(THEN)
Hey. Remember this?
(half drunk, sings badly)
One love, one heart...
(MARLEY QUIETS)
Let's get together and feel alright...
John nods off, one arm hanging over the side of the bed into
the box, his hand resting on Marley's back as the puppy now
snoozes peacefully and we then...
FADE OUT.
AN ALARM CLOCK SOUNDS.
40 FADE IN: CLOSE-UP OF MARLEY'S FACE 40
Tail rising in the b.g., wagging.
REVEAL: BEDROOM - MORNING

40 CONTINUED:
As John opens his eyes to see Marley snuggled up against his
face. Marley's eyes looking into his. John reaches over the
puppy and shuts off the alarm.
JOHN
She comes home today.
Hung over, he sits up, looks around the messy room, half due
to John's bachelor housekeeping habits, half due to Marley.
Not only has everything has been chewed, but some time during
the night Marley discovered how much fun toilet paper is.
JOHN (CONT'D)
We should probably clean up.
John vacuums, struggles to empty the bag, puts a broken vase
in the trash, does the dishes, etc. Marley follows him, tail
wreaking havoc, knocking over everything that isn't nailed
down. John picks up the HUGE CHEW TOY he'd just bought and
examines it as Marley runs into the bathroom...
JOHN
Huh.
It's already completely gnawed up. John looks at Marley who
emerges dragging a roll of toilet paper, rams right into the
screen door, bounces back.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Marley, it's a screen, you're not gonna
GET THROUGH--
Meanwhile, Marley backs up a few steps, gets a head of steam,
then rams into it again, this time goes right through it.
JOHN (CONT'D)
--there.
John gets drenched as he gives Marley a bath.
John drags Marley into the garage.
JOHN
I'll be back in an hour. Be good.
29.
44
They open the door and freeze.
JENNY
Oh my God.
It's a mess. It's almost incredible that it's all due to a
single puppy. The box is in shreds; so are the blankets. A
puddle of urine on the floor. A large piece of dry wall has
been chewed off near the big garage door. The garbage cans
are overturned. Marley is whimpering in the corner.
JOHN
Wow. Okay, this is not how I left it.
JENNY
How long has he been in here?
3/06/07 30.
47 CONTINUED: 47
JOHN
An hour, at the most.
(looks around, then)
Jeez... he Alg drywall. That's just not
right.
JENNY
(she picks him up)
Look. He's shaking--
Another bit of THUNDER and the puppy whimpers louder.
JENNY (CONT'D)
Does thunder scare you, Mister? Hm?
He licks her face, snuggles into her. She gives him the
Pluto stuffed animal. She hugs him...
JENNY (CONT'D)
Look at us.
She looks up at John and smiles. He returns the smile.
Mission accomplished.
As Marley bursts out of the back bedroom with one of Jenny's
bras in his mouth.
JENNY
Marley, no!
Jenny chases him into the kitchen, past John who holds up the
newspaper...
JOHN
He gave me an extra paragraph...
Marley bursts through the back screen door...
John sits across from Arnie. He looks thrown:
JOHN
I don't understand, why me?
ARNIE
I'm in a bind, John.
JOHN
But I'm a reporter, not a columnist.
ARNIE
It's a step up.
JOHN
Yeah, but it's a step away from what I
wanna do.
ARNIE
It's also better pay, you set your own
hours, pick your own topics...

32.

52 CONTINUED:
ARNIE (CONT'D)
and it's only temporary, just until I
find someone permanent.
JOHN
What happened to Jerry?
ARNIE
You may have noticed that in every
other column, he went on about The Pie
Palace?
JOHN
I really haven't read his--
ARNIE
Turns out he's been getting free meals
in exchange for mentioning the joint.
It's also why he became such a fat ass.
John nods. Oh.
ARNIE (CONT'D)
Anyway, it's twice a week. And like I
said, it's only until I can find
someone else to replace him. Then
you're back on, uh... whatever beat you
were on.
John sits at the table scribbling on a legal pad. He tears
off the sheet and crumples it up, throws it across the room.
Marley bounds into the room, Jenny behind him, sweating.
JENNY
I think he dislocated my shoulder. He
doesn't heel-- hell, he doesn't even
walk, he sprints, and I had to pull him
off three dogs...
JOHN
Poodle?
JENNY
Yeah, among others. There was a
Yorkie, a Dalmatian and a bichon frise
that may never be right again.
(sees the legal pad)
What're you doing?
JOHN
Arnie gave me a column.
JENNY
You're kidding? Congratulations!
JOHN
Oh, yeah, it's a big honor. I get to
write about zoning laws and yard sales.
JENNY
I bet you make something out of it.
JOHN
It's only temporary until he finds
someone else. I'm just trying to get
something down for Tuesday.
She gives him a kiss, starts out of the room
JENNY
You'll think of something. And John,
I'm serious abut Marley. He wreaks
havoc everywhere he goes. We gotta do
something...
34.
55
As they follow Marley back into the house.
JOHN
Well, that was fun.
(to the dog)
Congratulations, Marley. You flunked
obedience school.
JENNY
You know, John, there is something else
we can do--
JOHN
(looks at her)
No, no, I'm not doing that to him.
JENNY
It's painless. And he'll be a lot more
comfortable. It'll calm him down.
JOHN
Yeah, you know why he'll be calmer?
Because he'll have nothing to look
forward to.
JENNY
What're you talking about? There are
plenty of other things that'll make him
HAPPY--
JOHN
That's where you're wrong. Trust me,
Jen: I know. I'm a guy. And yeah,
lots of things make us happy, but the
only thing we really look forward to is
sex. Runner up: the possibility of
sex.
JENNY
Oh, Please. Every book says he'll live
LONGER--
JOHN
It'll just feel longer.
JENNY
John, he's out of control. It's the
right thing to do.
John sighs, looks at Marley who's now humping the stuffed
"goofy" that Jenny gave him as a puppy.
39.
59
Jenny at the wheel. John in the passenger seat. Marley in the
back, his front paws balanced on the center console.
JOHN
It won't be so bad, buddy. You'll see.
Sex is overrated.
Marley looks-at him.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Okay, I'm lying, and I think you know
that... so maybe the best thing is to
just not talk about it.
Jenny cuts him a look. He lowers his voice.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Poor son-of-a-bitch.
A guilty John cracks the window just a bit and Marley begins
listing to starboard, leaning against John to catch a whiff
of the outdoor smells. Marley crawls onto John's lap...
JOHN (CONT'D)
Oh, okay, you wanna sit up here...
Marley now jams his nose into the small opening, snorting to
catch the fresh air
JOHN (CONT'D)
Least I can do.
John lowers the window and Marley gets his whole snout out.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Here you go...
John lowers the window again and now Marley sticks his whole
head out, ears flapping behind him, tongue hanging out like
he's drunk.
JOHN (CONT'D)
He's so happy. He has no idea what's
about to happen to him.
Jenny looks over as Marley hooks his paws over the half open
window so that his neck and upper shoulders now hang out of
the car.
JENNY
He's making me nervous.

59 CONTINUED:
JOHN
He's fine. He just wants a little
FRESH--
Suddenly Marley slides his front legs out the window until
his front armpits are resting on the glass.
JENNY
John, grab him!
Before John can do anything, Marley is off his lap and
scrambling out the window of the moving car.
JOHN
He's onto our evil plan, and he's
making a break for it!
But now his butt is up in the air, his hind legs clawing for
a foothold...
60
As Jenny slows down in heavy traffic, John lunges out the
window after Marley, grabs the end of his tail with one hand
so that Marley dangles upside down, outside the car, by his
tail... He trots along the pavement with his front paws...
61
Jenny gets the car stopped, HORNS HONKING BEHIND THEM.
JOHN
Uh, little help here...
John's stuck. He can't pull the dog back in the window and he
can't open the door. He can't let go as angry drivers behind
them are now starting to swerve around them. John hangs on
for dear life...
JENNY
I got him!
62
John sits at his desk, tries to write a column. Sebastian, in
a flak jacket, pauses at his desk...
SEBASTIAN
Strip mall get approved?
JOHN
Riveting planning commission vote.
Knuckle-biter. 8 to 1.
SEBASTIAN
You up for a beer?
JOHN
Can't, I gotta finish the column.
Maybe tomorrow?
SEBASTIAN
Can't, I'll be in L.A. Part of that
drug piece I'm doing--
JOHN
Right. Another time then.
John watches him move off, a secretary giving Sebastian a big
smile as he passes. John sits there another moment, looks at
his desk. A photo of him and Jenny. One of Marley with a flip
flop in his mouth.
John chuckles to himself, then deletes the column, starts
typing a new one.
John sits anxiously across from Arnie who sits at his desk
reading. The editor's expression is grim as he looks up at
John.
JOHN
I'm really sorry, I'll go back and do
the zoning piece--
ARNIE
The hell you sorry for? It's
hilarious.
John sits back down, looks at Arnie. See, the thing is,
Arnie's face doesn't say "hilarious," but...

ARNIE (CONT'D)
I loved it. Getting kicked out of
obedience school, the humping, the
"Great Escape," all of it. Hysterical.
Again, Arnie's face remains dead serious as he passes the
paper back to John.
ARNIE (CONT'D)
Run it. As is.
JOHN
Thank you, sir.
John starts out of the office.
ARNIE
Hey, Gorgan...

As Jenny pushes John back onto the bed, starts kissing
Things getting hot and heavy quickly. As they kiss...
JENNY
Honey?
JOHN
Yeah...
JENNY
Did you eat some kibble?
JOHN
What?
And now they part and we see MARLEY'S HUGE FACE RESTING ON
THE SIDE OF THE BED, watching, panting up a storm.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Marley-- get out of here!

Oh, he knows, and trust me, he

Marley! Get out!
But Marley jumps up on the bed, tries to climb on both of
THEM--
JENNY
Marley!
And now they both start laughing as the dog tries to lick
their faces...
67
Silence. Arnie reads John's column, his face dead serious.
ARNIE
This is even funnier than the last one.
JOHN
Thank you, sir.
ARNIE
You're good, Gorgan. And not just the
dog stuff. The piece on the women of
Boca last week. What'd you call them?
JOHN
Boccahontis.
ARNIE
Hilarious.
John nods, starts for the door...
ARNIE (CONT'D)
Is it true what you wrote? You and the
wife are trying to have a kid?
JOHN
Well, we're not really trying.
ARNIE
How's that work?

JENNY
Like right now.
In the f.g., stands a harried thirty-something FATHER with a
screaming INFANT in a Bjorn. John stands just behind the
father who bounces in place trying unsuccessfully to soothe
the baby.
GIRL'S VOICE
Daddy!
And now, another KID, 4-year-old girl, jumps up in and out of
frame...
GIRL
I wanna push the button!
FATHER
Daddy can't lift you right now--
GIRL
(jumps up again)
You said I could push the button!
FATHER
Alright, okay, I'll just--
He tries to pick her up without leaning over...
GIRL
Ow! You're hurting me!
FATHER
Okay, you know what? Never mind, no
button!
A very uncomfortable John now steps forward...
JOHN
You want me to give her a hand?
FATHER
Oh-- would you mind?
John lifts the girl up to the panel. She runs her hands,
from top to button, down the panel, pressing every single
button.
FATHER (CONT'D)
Sarah! Goddammit--

And now the little girl starts bawling in concert with the
baby, while a trapped John backs up into the corner.

John enters and is greeted as usual by Marley who jumps on
him.
JOHN
Hey, boy.
(LOOKS AROUND)
Jenny?
JENNY
Out in a sec!
John stands there, Marley looking at him.
JOHN
(to the dog)
So. This is us not trying.
The bathroom door opens and Jenny walks out in a tiny, silky
two-piece thing...
JENNY
Hey, Sailor.
She walks into the bedroom. John looks back at Marley as he
follows her into the bedroom.
JOHN
Catch you later, buddy.
And closes the door on the dog.
John and Sebastian sit at the bar.

73 CONTINUED: 73
SEBASTIAN
So the puppy wasn't enough?
JOHN
Well, technically, we're not trying.
But you know Jenny.
SEBASTIAN
But things are good right now, just as
they are, right?
JOHN
Yeah, things are really good.
SEBASTIAN
So why change it up with a kid? I
mean, have you already forgotten my
little cautionary tale...
JOHN
The bomb, right?
SEBASTIAN
Yes. The bomb. And just so we're
clear, the countdown sequence has been
reactivated. By you.
JOHN
Well, it's been a few months and
nothing's happened. Which actually
makes me wonder if--
BARTENDER
Mr. Grogan?
The BARTENDER sets a PHONE down in front of John.
BARTENDER (CONT'D)
Phone call. I loved that thing you did
on your dog watching you and your wife
have sex? Really funny stuff...
JOHN
(EMBARRASSED)
Thanks...
BARTENDER
Seriously, man, your stuff is classic.
JOHN
Well, it's just temporary, but thanks.
John cuts a look at Sebastian, picks up the phone.

JOHN (CONT'D)
Hello.
JENNY (PHONE)
I just wanted to let you know that
there's a naked blonde in your bed.
JOHN
Oh. Why don't you two get started and
I'll be there as soon as I can.
JENNY
Very funny. Can you come home? I'll
make it worth your while.
JOHN
Oh. Alright then. I'll see what I can
do.
He hangs up. Looks at Sebastian.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Uh, I'm sorry, man, but I gotta jam. I
forgot, I had this thing, I gotta deal
WITH--
SEBASTIAN
She's calling you home, isn't she?
JOHN
Yeah. See you later.
John starts out of the bar. Sebastian calls after him.
SEBASTIAN
Tick tick tick!
74
Romantic Music on the stereo. John comes in, wearily,
absently pets Marley. He goes into the bedroom. The
bathroom door is open. John sits down on the bed.
JOHN
You know, this baby thing. I been
thinking maybe we should take a break.
You know? Obviously, it's not
happening. Maybe that's nature's way
of saying it's not good timing.
No sound from Jenny. He struggles on.

JOHN (CONT'D)
Maybe this is a sign that we're not
ready for this. I mean, have we really
thought this through? Because--

He looks up to see Jenny at the bathroom door. From
her back she brings out a home pregnancy test strip.
JENNY
I'm pregnant.
JOHN
(PAUSE, then)
Great. Wow, that's... great.
JENNY
But you just said
JOHN
Yeah, no, I mean-- okay, this is
definitely awkward now, but...
JENNY
You wanna start over?
JOHN
Can I?
JENNY
By all means.
JOHN
Thank you. Okay, well... I gotta be
honest, I'm a little panicked.
JENNY
Are you panicking because I'm
pregnant... or because you're afraid
I'm going to hit you?
JOHN
Both. It's a twofer thing.
JENNY
Are you scared?
JOHN
No. No. Not at all.
(then, looks at her)
Yeah, yeah I'm pretty scared.

Look at me...
He looks at her. She smiles at him.
JENNY (CONT'D)
We're gonna be okay.
JOHN
(BEAT)
I believe you.
He looks at her stomach, kisses her there...
75
As John hands Arnie his latest column...
JOHN
That's probably the last one about
Marley for a while. But in about nine
months, I'm gonna have a new subject,
might be just as fun. Jenny's
pregnant.
ARNIE
(FLAT)
I'm very happy for you. Have you
bought her a present?
JOHN
What?
ARNIE
A gift, John. She's carrying a child.
Your child. Don't you think that's
worth something?
JOHN
Uhhh...
ARNIE
You don't wanna make the mistake I did.
Listen to me. There's gonna come a
time, she's fat, she's nauseous, her
ankles are swollen, and she's gonna
look at you, and this is what that look
will mean: "You bastard. You did this
to me. You dick, you ruined me." But

Lit with candles. Jenny and John on the couch. She removes
a beautiful gold necklace from a box and holds it up...
JENNY
Oh, John, it's beautiful...
She sets it down on the coffee table, then moves close to
him.
JENNY (CONT'D)
Thank you...
She kisses him.
JOHN
I was just thinking about you when I
walked by the store and saw it in the
window...
JENNY
That is so sweet.
JOHN
Put it on...
She turns back to the coffee table and looks around...
JENNY
Where'd it go? It was right here.
JOHN
You just put it down. It can't have

JENNY
Oh God...
Marley stands a few feet away, looking strangely gleeful. A
glint of Gold in the moonlight dangles from his mouth. They
both get up, start to move towards him...
JENNY (CONT'D)
Hey, boy. Come here. Look what I got
for you.
JOHN
We don't want any trouble...
JENNY
Yeah, here's a little something--
(imaginary) treat. Marley
She reaches into her pocket for an moves
looks at her. Is this a trick? He considers. Then he
closer. John tiptoes up behind him, ever so slowly.
JENNY (CONT'D)
I just want to give you a treat and a
big kiss. That's a boy...
Inch by inch, Marley approaches her. But then, behind
Marley, John knocks against a table. Marley freezes.
JOHN
He made me! Go!
Jenny lurches for Marley, going for his collar, and John
leaps at him from behind. Marley skitters away. Ah, a game!
He wags his tail, prances, sticks his rear in the air and his
puts his head to the ground. John feints, tries to maneuver
Marley back into Jenny.
Jenny finally grabs him from behind. John pries open his
mouth. Nothing. He reaches inside, looks up at Jenny.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Uh-oh.
Carefully, Jenny lifts the shiny necklace out of a glass
filled with bleach.
JENNY
I think it's shinier than before.
Amazing.
JOHN
Yeah. He did us a favor. And I only
threw up eight times.
JENNY
My hero.

The NURSE arranges the gown on Jenny.
NURSE

Unambiguous genitalia, if we had our
druthers, but whatever...
NURSE
Shhhhh... hang on...
She listens for a moment with a little microphone hooked up
to a speaker. Nothing.
NURSE (CONT'D)
Sometimes you,can't hear it, depending
on how the baby is lying.- You're ten
weeks, right?
JENNY
Next Monday, yes.
NURSE
Might be a little early for that.
Let's go right to the sonogram. Did
you bring your blank tape?
JOHN
(waving it, smiling)
Ready to roll.
NURSE
Let's get a good picture first. It'll
be on the monitor there.
The Nurse begins running the instrument around Jenny's
stomach. John and Jenny peer at the computer screen.
NURSE (CONT'D)
(NEUTRAL)
Hmmm. This one doesn't seem to be
picking up anything. Excuse me, I'll
be just a minute...
She leaves. Jenny and John smile at each other, but inside
each of them, a small pinpoint of fear starts to expand. We
wait for a few moments. A pressured silence. And then...
smiles down at
DR. SHERMAN comes in, followed by the nurse,

Jenny and John, holding hands, look at the computer screen.
They see a sac, which, with a click of the mouse, Dr. Sherman
expands and expands. But it's empty. Jenny tries to smile.
JENNY
Is there anything in there?
DR. SHERMAN
Not what you'd expect to see at ten
weeks.
JENNY
Not quite ten weeks.
Dr. Sherman looks at them directly. Kindly:
DR. SHERMAN
Jenny, I'm sorry, but there's no
heartbeat.
John and Jenny are still, silent.
DR. SHERMAN (CONT'D)
One in six pregnancies ends this way.
it just happens sometimes, that's all.
I'm very sorry. But you're young and
healthy and in a couple of months, you
can try again.
(THEN)
Why don't you come by my office on your
way out and we can talk some more.
He exits. John is still holding the blank videotape. He
tries to hide it from Jenny. He leaves. Jenny and John look
at each other.
JENNY
How could this happen? What'd I do
wrong?
JOHN
You didn't do anything--
JENNY
I must have. Otherwise, how could I
lose it?

Jenny, it's not something you have any
control over. It's like the doctor
said, it just happens--
JENNY
Not to me... I did something wrong. I
know it... I did something wrong. I'm
sorry, John...
JOHN
Don't say that--
JENNY
But I am-- I'm sorry--
JOHN
I don't need sorry. You didn't do
anything!
She turns away and begins to cry. John just sits there,
staring at the videotape in his hands.
Outside in the hall, the door to another examining room opens
and they hear a couple laughing, talking excitedly.
Jenny and John look away from each other, their pain made
even worse.

John is driving Jenny home.
JOHN
In a couple of months, we can try
again. Okay?
Jenny just looks out the window.

With difficulty, John holds back Marley to protect DEBBY ---
19, glasses, bookish, the house sitter -- from his affection.
JOHN
Yeah. Close to a hundred pounds.

He just wants to say hi. He won't hurt
you. Just stand still and be calm.
You're a dog person, right?
DEBBY

There are just a few things about
Marley you need to know. He eats three

him again. Of course all this food has
to go somewhere.

Debby is throwing up in her mouth a little as she cleans
Marley's ears. Marley loves it.
JENNY'S VOICE
Marley is an excellent watchdog. And
in this neighborhood, that's a good

Debby is showering - and then starts SCREAMING. Marley has
stuck his head through the shower curtain and is licking the
water. Debby splashes water at him to make him go away.
Marley, thinking she's playing, scrambles into the tub with
her. She grabs the curtain, and it pops off the curtain
rings one by one as in ",Psycho."
JOHN'S VOICE
- actually, you might want to keep the
bathroom door closed in general.

Debby has run out of the bathroom, a towel hastily wrapped
around her. Marley chases her. He leaps - and returns to
earth with the towel in his mouth. Debby SCREAMS.

Debby is standing on a coffee table, nude, swatting at an
unseen Marley with a bunch of tall artificial flowers.

Other than that, enjoy him! Thanks so
much. Love, Jenny and John.

Four walls, four different floral wallpapers. Twin beds.

since... you know. But there's no way
we're breaking the streak tonight.
JOHN
No kidding. 'Cause it's not just God
watching. God, his mother...

They are in separate beds, staring at the crucifix.
JOHN
It's July, but I think I can see my

JENNY
I can't feel my toes.
John gets out of his bed and into Jenny's. Much SQUEAKING.
JENNY (CONT'D)
My God. Shhh.
JOHN
It's not the mattress. It's the
shrieks of over-sexed souls in hell.
JENNY
You wanna join them?
He looks at her.
JOHN
Are you sure, because we don't have
to...
JENNY
I can't help myself. Knowing it hasn't
happened in this house in 50 years is a
turn-on.
They roll into each others' arms, the bed squeaking.

The next morning. John and Jenny, looking flushed and
relaxed, and slightly abashed, come downstairs. Mrs.

They heard us.
JOHN
No...
He jumps as Mrs. Butterly slams the teapot on the table.
MRS. BUTTERLY

I'm off to Mass.
Mrs. Butterly leaves. John and Jenny look at the other
guests. They smile bravely.
JOHN
Wow. Any of you hear her bed squeaking
last night? I hope she hits confession
before Mass, that's all I can say.
Another widow, another room, another collection of religious
artifacts. John smiles.
Jenny sits on the bed, smiles at the NOISE, starts taking off
her shoes. John ushers the Owner out of the room.
A THUNDERSTORM outside. John sits at his desk, tries to work
while Marley walks in circles. John looks at him...
JOHN
It's only thunder...
John goes back to work. We hear more THUNDER, and Marley
starts howling, knocks over a floor lamp... John looks off
towards the bedroom...
JOHN (CONT'D)
Jenny?! Can you help me out here? I
got twenty minutes to file this column!
We follow John as he gets up from his desk, heads towards the
back bedroom...

We follow him into the room, an anxious Marley close at his
heels. She's not here, he turns around just as she steps out
of the bathroom, smiling...
JENNY

She holds up a pregnancy test with a clear BLUE line, her
exuberant face lit up by a FLASH OF LIGHTNING. John goes to
hug her, as Marley HOWLS in the b.g., we then...
FADE OUT.
SUPER: "Nine Months Later."
John and Jenny are asleep. Marley goes through his nighttime
ROUTINE:
He chews through a sock. He drinks out of the toilet. He
works on chewing through the plastic dog food tub. Another
night and he'll be in. He chases a fly.
Finally he goes to his bed on the floor of the bedroom. He
settles himself down to sleep. He yawns, he scratches, he
closes his eyes. He snores. And then -
He wakes up, suddenly alert. He looks over at Jenny. He
gets up, sits by her side of the bed, and waits.
Suddenly Jenny sits up, rests a hand on her stomach.
JENNY
WHOA--
She catches her breath, leans over to John.
JENNY (CONT'D)
John. John, wake up.
JOHN
What?
JENNY
I think it's time.

Jenny has finished dressing. Suddenly she yelps in pain,
doubles over. John takes her in his arms.
JOHN
It's okay.
JENNY
Ow!
Suddenly, A GROWL. They turn to see Marley glaring at John.
JOHN
It's okay. I'm not hurting her.
Jenny MOANS again and now Marley's eyes narrow. He takes a
step towards John.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Please don't scream, honey. He'll kill
me.
JENNY
You put the car seat in this weekend,
right? They won't let us take the baby
home without the car seat installed.
JOHN
Like I'd forget that.
Panicking, John is struggling to get the car seat he forgot
out of the box. He starts beating at the Styrofoam. Marley
barks excitedly. John gets an idea, hands him one end of the
box.
JOHN
Come on, Marley. Help me out here. Do
what you do best...
Unsure, Marley licks the box.
JOHN (CONT'D)
No, don't lick it, eat it! Destroy it!
You can chew through drywall, man! I
know you can do this!
Marley catches on. He starts shredding the box.
68.
John hurls a suitcase and the partially-assembled, partially-
destroyed car seat into the back seat. He yells:
JOHN
Car seat's in!
JOHN
Ready?
JENNY
Yeah. You?
Marley barks from the back seat. They both turn and look at
him. What's he doing here?
John opens the front door, drags Marley in. John gives him a
GIANT BONE-SHAPED CHEW TOY...
JOHN
Okay. Here... Stay. Be good. Please,
God. No storms. Stay.
The chew toy now almost completely gone. Marley sleeps
beside it as we hear A KEY IN THE LOCK and he gets to his
feet, greets John as he comes through the door.
JOHN
Hey, boy.
As John sets down a bowl of food, crouches down as Marley
starts to eat.

As the sun now streams in through the front windows down onto
Marley, who is sound asleep. We hear A CAR DOOR CLOSE and he
raises his head...
A moment later, THE FRONT DOOR OPENS and John comes in and
Marley greets him, jumps up on his chest.
JOHN
Hey, boy... let's go outside...
As Jenny unpacks her suitcase. Marley bounds into the room
and greets her.
JENNY
Hello, Marley...
She crouches down, gives him a kiss, rubs his back. And
that's when we hear a small, birdlike chirp and the dog
freezes. Where'd that come from?
We hear the coo again and this time Marley lifts one paw in
the air like a bird dog, and points in the direction of the
car seat that we now see sitting on the bed...
JOHN
You know what I think would be a
bummer? If he ate the baby...
.Harley & Me Shooting Draft
70.

116 CONTINUED:
She moves to the car seat and turns it around so that now we
see the baby for the first time. She smiles at Marley...
JENNY
This is Patrick, Marley.
Jenny unbuckles Patrick from the car seat and crouches down
beside Marley and lets the dog sniff the baby's toes, then up
his legs, finally his diaper which puts Marley into a Pampers
stupor, the Holy Grail of aromas and Marley's eyes glaze...
JENNY (CONT'D)
See, he's not gonna hurt him.
JOHN
No, but I'm gonna have to put a lock on
the diaper pail.
Jenny tries to watch the baby, now crawling around on the
floor and file her column over the phone at the same time.
JENNY
I have the quote right here--
Patrick crawls over Marley, who's supremely patient as
Patrick takes a fistful of his eye.
JENNY (CONT'D)
Well, have legal call them again and
get a release for it. They told me it
was on the record-- Marley-- Patrick,
that's his eye-- No, not you, Karla,
just get the release. I'll call you
back.
(HANGS UP)
Be gentle, Patrick!
Jenny leans back in her chair, rubs her face. Then...
JENNY (CONT'D)
(GETS UP)
Laundry.
71.
119
The baby in his high chair. Jenny sets a few cheerios on the
tray. Patrick picks them up and drops them, we follow them
down...
THE FLOOR
To where Marley waits, eagerly vacuuming up the cereal. It
continues to RAIN CHEERIOS and we then BOOM BACK UP and see
that Patrick is now eight months old, laughing as he throws
the cereal onto the floor...
They're both working at their desks. Jenny looks up from her
computer.
JENNY
I need to go in tomorrow for a few
hours, see my editor. Think you can
watch the baby for me?
JOHN
Sure.
John looks around the room. The place is a disaster area.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Remember us?
JENNY
You mean, those younger, skinnier
better looking people? Yeah, I think I
remember them. Vaguely.
JOHN
Well, I miss them.
He turns back to his work. She looks at him, sets her pad
aside, comes up behind him, puts her arms around him.
72.
122 CONTINUED: 122
JENNY
They're still here.
He looks up at their reflection in the window, not so sure.
John and Jenny now asleep on opposite sides of the bed. On
the floor beside John, Marley lifts his head and GROWLS. We
then hear a piercing SCREAM coming from outside. The dog is
already out of the room.
John sits up, immediately starts to get out of bed...
JOHN
MARLEY-
JENNY
Honey, don't go out there.
JOHN
Stay here. Call the police.
Marley's at the door growling as John, in his boxer shorts,
grabs the dog by the choke chain and opens the door. We hear
another SCREAM coming from a couple houses down and Marley
breaks through the screen, pulling John with him...
A REALTOR is showing a COUPLE around the large, empty, new
house. She points out the designer kitchen that looks out
onto the patio and pool, a huge yellow lab now leaping in.
A moment later, we see John, clutching Patrick, enter the
backyard, try to haul Marley out of the pool. He gives up,
heads for the house, opens the back door and peers inside.
JOHN
Hi.
The Realtor smiles awkwardly at him.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Can I see a set-up, please?
REALTOR
Certainly.
(looks at the baby)
First home?
JOHN
No, we live up in West Palm, over on
Churchill?
REALTOR
Ooooh. Well, I think you'd find this
neighborhood to be quite a pleasant
change.
And now Marley bolts past him into the house, tracking wet
footprints all over the floor, jumps up onto the REALTOR.
REALTOR (CONT'D)
Oh... my... hello...
JOHN
Hey, who's dog is that?
John enters, carrying Patrick, supplies to fix the screen.
JOHN
Jenny?
A wet Marley bounds into the house, heads for the back. John
follows.
76.

THE
Jenny is crouched on the floor when John appears in
doorway.
JOHN
Hey. You alright?
She stands up, smiles the best she can.
JENNY
I'm fine. Where you guys been?
JOHN
I wanna show you something.
JENNY
What?
JOHN
(hands her the set up)
A house.
(before she can react)
It's a little pricey, but I think we
can do it.
JENNY
John, I know we've talked about it, but
I'm not sure this is the right time.
JOHN
And when would the right time be, Jen?
After one of us gets stabbed in the
driveway?
JENNY
JOHN--
JOHN
C'mon, honey, we're cramped in here.
This was supposed to be our three-year
house, remember?
JENNY
I know, but we can't afford to buy a
new one.
JOHN
Sure, we can. With both our salaries--
JENNY
Yeah, about that... I don't think I'm
gonna be able to keep working.

77.

130 CONTINUED:
JENNY (CONT'D)
(THEN)
I'm pregnant.
JOHN
What? Are you sure?
She steps away, revealing the counter where FOUR PREGNANCY
TESTS are lined up, all with the same result: Positive.
JENNY
Very.
John sits with Sebastian at his desk.
SEBASTIAN
Already? I mean, how old's the one you
got?
JOHN
About eight months.
SEBASTIAN
Jesus. Haven't you heard of birth
control?
JOHN
Yeah, well, sometimes it doesn't work.
You know what else doesn't work? The
one about how "A dog will stop your
wife's biological clock."
SEBASTIAN
Hey, I'm not the one, keeps getting her
pregnant.
John gives him a look, sees Arnie heading into his office,
takes a breath and gets to his feet.
JOHN
Wish me luck.
SEBASTIAN
I'm sure he'll give you the raise.
JOHN
How do you know?
SEBASTIAN
He always gives me one.
John just shakes his head, starts for Arnie's office.
78.
132
John sits across from Arnie.
ARNIE
Why should I do this, why are you worth
it?
JOHN
Because I'm doing a good job?
ARNIE
Are you asking me?
JOHN
Well, since I took over, the column has
doubled in readership...
ARNIE
So you are doing a good job.
JOHN
Yes, sir.
ARNIE
So why not make it permanent?
JOHN
You mean, like forever?
ARNIE
That's what the word "forever" means.
Yes.
(THEN)
John, you know how many yo yo's in the
other room would kill to have their own
column? You took a piece of crap About
Towner and turned it into something
fresh.
(SITS BACK)
I hate to break it to you, son, but
you're a good columnist.
JOHN
I just had this idea about myself, you
know, that I was a reporter.
ARNIE
Yeah, well sometimes life comes up with
a better idea. Tell you what. You
make it a daily column and I'll double
your salary. How's that?
79.
This is the elegant kitchen we saw, bare and uninhabited,
several scenes ago. Now it's full of the clutter of the
Grogans' life. The new baby, CONOR is screaming. We follow
Jenny through the new house asshetries to soothe him.
JENNY
Shhh, honey. Come on.
John follows now...
JOHN
Is he wet?
JENNY
No. And I can't get a burp out of him.
I think it's colic.
81.
135 CONTINUED: 135
JOHN
Want me to drive him?
JENNY
We can't do that every night.
From the other room, we HEAR Patrick CRYING, "Mommy!"
JENNY (CONT'D)
Oh, Jesus.
JOHN
I'll do the washer.
John sitting on the washer with his WAILING BABY. Not fun.
John looks to where Marley lies in the corner, watching.
JOHN
Any ideas?
John is opening the cupboards, getting cereal and yogurt into
a bowl for Patrick. Jenny enters with a fussing Conor on her
shoulder...
JENNY
Can you take him? I just need a minute
to myself.
John takes the baby and instantly Conor starts crying louder.
JOHN
Happens every time.
JENNY
You just need to spend more time with
him.
John puts Conor on the changing table, unbuttons his onesie,
checks his diaper. It's wet; he starts changing him. Conor
cries throughout. Jenny enters.
JENNY
It's okay, I'll do it.
82.
138
138 CONTINUED:
JOHN
I'm doing it! It's fine! You tell me
to spend more time with him, I do it,
and then you take over because I'm not
doing it right.
JENNY
I don't want you changing him when
you're mad.
JOHN
I'm not mad!
He hears himself, lets her change the baby. She takes him,
sits down with him in a rocking chair, tries to nurse him...
JENNY
Conor, come on... Conor, please...
She finally stops trying, rocks the chair, looks helplessly
at John.
JENNY (CONT'D)
I don't know what's wrong with me.
Mothers are supposed to be able to give
their baby everything.
JOHN
He's just colicky, Jen. He'll grow out
of it.
JENNY
Okay, here's an idea, you stay here and
I'll go to work while he grows out of
it.
He holds up his hands, what does he say to that. She looks
up at him a moment.
JENNY (CONT'D)
I'm just tired, alright? Go on.
She then resumes trying to nurse the baby. He walks out of
the room. She rocks back and forth, looks up with a dark
expression as she hears his CAR START.
ARNIE (V.0.)
It's post partum depression...
83.
John sits on a stool in front of'a portable SCREEN while a
pretty female PHOTOGRAPHER adjusts her lights. Arnie sits
nearby on a desk watching the portrait...
ARNIE
Her hormones are all on tilt and she's
depressed. It happens. After my
fourth kid was born, I'd wake up, find
my wife just staring at me with a
mallet in her hand. I thought she was
gonna kill me in my sleep. I still
do...
(THEN)
Did you get her the gift?
JOHN
Yeah.
ARNIE
Huh. That usually works.
Arnie gets off the desk, says to the Photographer:
ARNIE (CONT'D)
Alright, Janice, make him look pretty.
The man's an official columnist now.
Arnie moves off and the photographer looks up from her camera
and smiles at John. He smiles back. She keeps smiling... so
does he... she finally indicates his hair...
PHOTOGRAPHER
You have a Barney sticker in your--
JOHN
Oh-- thanks.
He rakes his fingers through his hair, grabs the offending
sticker, looks at her...
JOHN (CONT'D)
I must look like hell... I don't think
I've had a full night sleep in two
months.
PHOTOGRAPHER
Stress?
84.
139 CONTINUED: 139
JOHN
Kids. I got one with colic, and
another, can't make it through the
night without coming into my room every
two hours.
PHOTOGRAPHER
Well, I think you're holding up great.
You look cute.
JOHN
Really?
PHOTOGRAPHER
Yeah, like a cute, exhausted Dad. It's
adorable.
John just nods stupidly, the dagger so deep in his heart,
he'll never reach it. She smiles at him.
PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D)
You certainly look a lot better than
Jerry ever looked. I tried to get him
to take a new picture, but he liked the
one they took the day he started the
column, nineteen years ago.
JOHN
Nineteen years, huh...
And just when he thought one dagger was brutal enough, his
expression goes really pensive. And on that look, we see a
FLASH as she takes his picture and go right to:
As John looks at the house... the windows all lit up. Inside
Jenny moves about with the baby over her shoulder as Patrick
chases Marley around the room. John sits in the car, unable
to move, just watching the chaos in the window.
Marley jumps up against the glass, stands on his hind legs,
paws to the window and looks out. He barks and now Jenny
comes up behind him, hauls him off the window and now sees
John sitting in the car. She gives him a look that says
"What're you doing? Get in here!"
John quickly gets out of the car...
85.
John and Jenny eat dinner in exhausted silence. Patrick
throws his food on the floor where a happy Marley waits.
Conor starts crying O.S. and Jenny gets up like a robot.
JOHN
I'll get him.
John leaves the room. Jenny sits there.
John and Jenny are in bed asleep. Patrick comes into their
room.
PATRICK
Mommy?
Jenny wakes up on autopilot.
JENNY
Okay, honey, let's go back to bed.
She leads him out of the room. And a second later Conor
starts crying. John lies there a moment, then gets up.
Through the doorway, Jenny, her back to us, gently bounces
Conor on her shoulder. John moves into FRAME...
JOHN
Jen, you okay?
REVERSE - ON JENNY
She's crying, her back to John who's now in the b.g. A
moment, then...
JENNY
I'm fine.
John comes into the kitchen just as Jenny takes a chewed copy
of "Good-night, Moon" from Marley's mouth...
JENNY
You ruined it! Bad dog!
She leaves the room and John looks at the dog.
86.
145
145 CONTINUED:
JOHN
You just had to eat the book? What,
have you got some kind of death wish?
I'm telling you, you better chill, or
she'll kill you. Right after she kills
me.
146
As Jenny gently sets a sleeping Conor in his crib. She
quietly backs out of the room and shuts the door.
As she peers in on Patrick, also napping in his room.
As Jenny comes in, Marley following and sits down heavily on
the bed. She looks at Marley as he lays down beside the bed.
JENNY
Stay.
She now lays down and closes her eyes. A moment of peace.
And then, somewhere in the distance we hear a faint BEEP BEEP
BEEP as some truck backs up. Marley lifts his head, perks up
his ears and listens. Please don't bark, dog. Please don't
bark. BEEP BEEP- And Marley BARKS, bolts out of the room...
Jenny opens her eyes with a start as Marley runs barking
through the house, we hear something CRASH and break O.S.
87.
149
149 CONTINUED:
And now Conor's crying.
150
As Marley jumps up against the window and peers out. Jenny
comes into the room, sees a lamp on its side, a cushion torn
open where Marley now stands. she grabs him by the collar--
JENNY
Why do you do this?! Why do you wreck
everything! Why?!!
She hauls her hand back to hit him, but hesitates, and just
shoves him away from her and storms into the other room for
Conor.
151
As John comes in, sees Jenny sitting there on the couch.
JOHN
Why's Marley out in the--
JENNY
I want that dog out of here.
JOHN
Okay. I'll take him out.
She looks up at him.
JENNY
I want you to get him out of here and
keep him out of here.
JOHN
What'd he do--
JENNY
I mean it, John. I want him gone. I
want him gone for good.

SEBASTIAN
You giving up the dog? i thought yo u
loved that thing.
JOHN
Jenny wants him out.
SEBASTIAN
That's harsh, man.
JOHN
I don't know what else to do. She's
really unhappy. Maybe the dog is just
one too many things.
SEBASTIAN
They're all unhappy. Trust me.
Well... who knows? Maybe you'll get
lucky and nobody'll want him.
John just nods, thinks about that. Sebastian glances around,
then takes John aside.
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Listen, there's something I gotta tell
you.
(THEN)
I'm leaving the paper.
JOHN
What?
SEBASTIAN
I just gave Arnie my notice.
John looks over at Arnie's office, the door's closed.
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
He's not too happy about it. He called
me an ungrateful quizzling and threw a
stapler at me.
JOHN
You going over to the Post?

I'm going to New York.
Sebastian smiles. John doesn't move.

The Gray Lady came courting last week.

I'm talking about the New York
BUDDY--
JOHN
I know who you're talking about.
SEBASTIAN
You don't seem happy for me.
JOHN
I am. I'm just in shock. I mean, I'm
in Florida because of you. Woodward
and Bernstein. Remember? That was the
idea.
SEBASTIAN
Yeah, that was the idea before you
decided to be the Andy Rooney of South
Florida.
JOHN
I didn't decide to be anything--
SEBASTIAN
Exactly.
Boom. That hurts John. They stand there a moment,
considering each other, then.
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Look, man, you're happy doing your
thing and I'm not trying to piss on
that. I mean it, you're good at it. I
just wanted you to be the first to
know. That's all.
154
John is working at his desk when Arnie drops a few stacks of
letters down.
ARNIE
These are all responses to the column
you wrote last week.
John thinks a moment...
ARNIE (CONT'D)
One where you said you may have to give
the dog away.
JOHN
(looks at the letters)
Oh. I assume they all want me to keep
him.
ARNIE
No. They're all saying they'd take
him.
Arnie moves on and John stares at the letters.
158
Jenny's been watching. She stands there thoughtfully as John
puts the frisbee in the box and resumes the hunt for the rest
of Marley's stuff, the dog following him.
Jenny's sitting on the bed waiting as John comes in.
JOHN
He's all packed up. Patrick will want
to say good-bye, but Conor's too young
TO--
JENNY
You can't do this.
JOHN
What do you mean? Three days ago, you
were pretty clear--
JENNY
I know, but you can't do it. I won't
let you. You can't give away Marley.
JOHN
Okay, wait. I'm lost. You told me you
didn't want him around. What's
happened?

The fact that you would have done
something like that, for me, that you
love me that much...

174 IN. AIRPLANE - DAY (ON THE TARMAC)
The Grogans are in the back of the plane.
JOHN
Look. There's Marley!
THROUGH THE WINDOW they can see Marley's crate arriving at
the plane on a luggage truck. Marley is asleep, heavily
drugged. Conor starts banging on the window.
CONOR
Hey, Marley! We're up here!
PATRICK
He can't hear you with the engine
going.
JOHN
(aside to Jenny)
Not to mention the tranquilizers. I
think he's already reached his cruising
altitude.
175
The engines ROAR up and the stewardess begins her pre-flight
safety demonstration. John watches her, smiling, relieved
they made it this far, when he freezes.
A MUFFLED MOAN is coming from beneath his feet. Clearly it's
Marley. Passengers near them frown.
PASSENGER
is that a dog?
JOHN
Maybe, I don't know.
PATRICK
Marley's Sad. Marley's our dog. He's
with the suitcases.
John smiles weakly at the Passenger.
JOHN
What an imagination, huh?
(MOUTHING IT:)
We don't have a dog.
He makes the crazy sign with his finger, gesturing at
Patrick. The MOANING gets worse. John just smiles tightly.
102.
As John is introduced to fellow staff and reporters, most of
them at least ten years younger than he is. He's shown his
desk. John sits down at his cubicle, stares out the window
at the city. His EDITOR, black, John's age, approaches with
a much younger REPORTER...
EDITOR
Hey, John. Settling in okay?
JOHN
I'm fine, thanks.
EDITOR
Good. I want you to meet Billy...
He indicates the twenty-something guy beside him. John and
Billy shake hands.
EDITOR (CONT'D)
Billy's gonna show you the ropes.

John shuts off all of the lights, heads upstairs. We follow
him up the stairs. He stops near the top, peers through the
bannister into...
183 PATRICK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 183
From the low angle of the stairs, Patrick lies on his side,
sleeping. And then we see Marley's head rise and reveal
itself as Marley lifts it to look at John standing there.
He'd been laying there on the bed behind Patrick. He looks
at John, knows he's not supposed to be there, but...
JOHN
That's alright, pal. I won't tell.
(THEN)
We kicked ass down that hill, didn't
we?
John smiles at him and continues up to bed.
John sits across from the editor.
JOHN

EDITOR
Yeah, I mean, don't get me wrong, it's
a good piece, but... you're reporting
now, John. I want you to tell the
story, I don't want you to be in the
STORY--
JOHN
I'm pretty sure I don't mention myself--

John sits there, thinking about that.

Marley snores on the floor while John, Jenny and the kids all
watch a movie together. Suddenly, they all take a whiff, then
wince at once...
CONOR
Marley!
They all begin waving their hands in front of their faces.
JENNY
I think someone needs to go out.
JOHN
(GETS UP)
Come on, boy...
Marley gets to his feet, follows John to the front door.
188
As John comes back into the room a moment...
JOHN
It's pouring out there...
He grabs his slicker and heads back out...
190
John is tucking the boys in.
JOHN
He's just out exploring. You know how
much he likes the woods.
PATRICK
Bobby says dogs, when they're going to
die, they go away to do it. That's
what his beagle did.
JOHN
And that's true... for beagles. But
not labs like Marley. He's just out
there making trouble somewhere. Don't
worry...
195
John's on the phone to neighbors...
JOHN
Okay. Well, if you see him... thanks.
He hangs up, goes to the window.
JOHN (CONT'D)
I'm gonna get in the car, maybe drive
OVER TO--
(he sees something)
Jenny.
Shooting Draft
109.
MARLEY & ME
196
John stands with DR. PLATT, a female vet. Marley lies on the
floor in a dog bed, an IV is going into his paw.
DR. PLATT
He's on an IV for fluids and a
sedative.
JOHN
So what happened?
DR. PLATT
His stomach twisted. He ate or drank
something quickly, took in a lot of air
and his stomach flipped. I got a tube
down which let out some of the gas. I
think i untwisted it.
JOHN
So he's okay...
DR. PLATT
For now. But once this happens, it
almost always happens again. And if it
does, there's not gonna be anything I
can do. He's too old for that kind of
surgery.
JOHN
What if it doesn't happen again?
DR. PLATT
More than likely, it will.
JOHN
But what if it doesn't?
DR. PLATT
I just think you should prepare
yourself that he might not make it
through the night.
(MORE)
110.
197
197 CONTINUED:
DR. PLATT (CONT'D)
(THEN)
Maybe one percent of dogs ever survive
THIS--
JOHN
One percent? What's that number based
on?
DR. PLATT
Mr. Grogan--
JOHN
I'll tell you what it's based on:
regular dogs.
(getting worked up)
Lady, we are so far from 'regular", you
have no idea.
(INDICATES MARLEY)
My guy here... He once ate an entire
answering machine, and digested it.
Then went back and ate the phone for
dessert. So don't give me numbers like
"one percent," because you don't know
him. But I do, and I'll see him in the
morning.
We TRACK WITH JOHN as he storms out of the exam room, walks
down the hall, goes through waiting room, then he PASSES US
as he goes out into the dark parking lot, walks to his car
and stops.
We stay BEHIND HIM as he leans with one hand on his car, and
doesn't move.
198
Jenny's sitting at the table looking through a thick album
when John comes in. She looks up at him expectantly.
JOHN
We're just gonna have to wait and see.
If he makes it through the night, I
think we'll be alright.
He notices the album.
JOHN (CONT'D)
What're you looking at?
JENNY
Your old columns. He's in a lot of
'em.
111.
198
198 CONTINUED:
John rotates the album for a better look.
JOHN
You saved these?
JENNY
Every one.
He looks up at her.
JENNY (CONT'D)
Even on the crappiest day, when the
boys were driving me nuts and the
laundry wasn't done and a hundred other
things were hard, I knew I had this.
(taps the book)
Five minutes of you. Sometimes they
were funny and sometimes they were sad,
or silly or whatever, but they were all
you. And for those five minutes, you
made me feel better.
She gets up, comes over to him, leans down and kisses his
head. Then, as she starts out...
JENNY (CONT'D)
You should read them. They're pretty
great.
199
As John, his head on the table, asleep, pops up at the sound
of the ring and grabs the phone.
JOHN
Hello?
(listens, then)
Alright. Thank you.
He hangs up, sees Jenny now standing in the doorway, tying
her robe, looking at him anxiously.
JOHN (CONT'D)
He's coming home.
201
Loft. Downtown. Full of unpacked boxes. A mattress on the
floor. Expensive electronics sit atop their cartons. John
follows Sebastian on a "tour."
JOHN
Nice place. How long you been here?
SEBASTIAN
Two years, little more.
Sebastian sees John looking at all of the unpacked boxes.
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
I'm in and out of town so much I really
haven't had a chance to settle in. I
hired a decorator, but she and I got
into a thing and it got messy--
JOHN
Right.
SEBASTIAN
Beer?
JOHN
I can't, I still got one more interview
to do.
A
Sebastian opens the fridge revealing nothing but beer and
hunk of Parmesan.
SEBASTIAN
What's the piece again?
JOHN
U.N.
SEBASTIAN
Right, you told me that. So you're
down in Philly now, huh?
JOHN
Just outside. More space for the kids.
113.
202
202 CONTINUED:
SEBASTIAN
Whatta you got, five now?
JOHN
Three. Here's a picture of
everybody...
John pulls a photo from his wallet, hands it to Sebastian.
SEBASTIAN
(NODS)
Jenny's holding up.
JOHN
(ignores the callowness)
Yeah, she's great. And that's Colleen
our youngest...
SEBASTIAN
What's with the ladybug get-up?
JOHN
(smiling at the memory)
Oh, yeah, that's a funny story. She
had done this pageant at her preschool
two weeks before, but she didn't wanna
take off the costume, plus Marley went
ballistic for the antenna which is why
it looks like he's trying to eat her
head.
SEBASTIAN
(FLAT)
Yeah, that is funny.
(returns the photo)
So I was thinking later on maybe Thai?
There's this new place in the meat
Packing District. How's that sound? Be
just like old times.
John stands there a moment, feeling the distance between
them.
JOHN
Uh, well, actually I'm headed back home
later today.
SEBASTIAN
Oh.
JOHN
In fact, I should probably get going...
114.
202
202 CONTINUED: (2)
SEBASTIAN
Alright.
(awkward Man-pat hug)
Good seeing you, man.
JOHN
For sure.
SEBASTIAN
(walking him out)
Oh, hey, be sure to check out the
Delegates Lounge at the U.N... Great
Mojitos, really hot interpreters.
JOHN
Thanks for the tip.
And John goes out the door. Sebastian takes out his
blackberry, dials...
SEBASTIAN
Hey, it's Sea-bass. What're you up to
tonight?
(THEN)
Oh. No, that's cool. Another time
then.
He hangs up, stands there in the middle of his big, empty
apartment a moment. He then dials another number.
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Hey, it's Sea-bass. What's going on?
203
John enters the house, sets down his suitcase.
JOHN
Hello? Anybody home?
He sees a note ("PICKING UP THE KIDS. J"), and peers into:
THE KITCHEN
Where Marley is up on his hind legs, eating something off the
counter. John puts his keys down, but Marley doesn't react.
John sneaks up behind him. Marley keeps eating the grilled
cheese sandwich off the plate...
115.
204
204 CONTINUED:
JOHN (CONT'D)
Marley? Hey, boy.
Marley looks up briefly as if he heard something, but then
returns to eating. John is right behind him. John reaches
out and touches Marley, and Marley jumps, totally guilty.
Then he turns and greets John.
JOHN (CONT'D)
What's the matter, boy? You didn't
hear me? Huh?
He looks at the dog a moment, thoughtful, then...
JOHN (CONT'D)
Let's go for a walk.
205
Jenny is at the top of the stairs.
JENNY
Marley?
(turns to John)
Have you seen him?
JOHN
He's not up here.
207
A
John and Jenny find Marley lying peacefully in front of the
dying fire.
JOHN
I guess I could move his bed down here.
John sits down beside Marley.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Man. He's always slept with us. Now
he can't even make it upstairs.
JENNY
He looks pretty comfortable to me.
(THEN)
I'll go get his bed.
JOHN
Hey Jen? why don't you grab a blanket
for me, too.
She nods, starts back up the stairs. John grabs a pillow
from the couch and lays down beside Marley.
JOHN (CONT'D)
This is a good spot. I may never sleep
upstairs again.
JENNY (O.S.)
Hey. Scooch over.
He looks up and see that Jenny's brought a blanket. She lies
down with them. John puts his arm around them both.
Marley's tail begins gently pounding the floor.
117.
207
207 CONTINUED:
JENNY (CONT'D)
Just like old times.
THUMP. THUMP.
208
John sits across from his editor.
JOHN
It'd be twice a week. Six hundred
words.
EDITOR
And what's the subject?
JOHN
Everyday stuff. The stuff we all go
through. But funnier.
EDITOR
I don't get it. I thought you came
here to be a reporter.
JOHN
I did, but I think we both know that
isn't me. I'm a columnist. A good
one.
A SECRETARY sticks her head in the office...
SECRETARY
John-- your wife's on the phone. She
says it's important...
JOHN
I'll be right there.
(to the editor)
Think about it.
209
Jenny on the phone, looking out into the backyard.
JENNY
I can't get him back inside. He's
lying out there in cold... and he won't
move...
210
Jenny and Patrick are sitting on the floor. Marley is lying
on the dining room floor, breathing heavily.
JENNY
Patrick came home and we got him here.
Dr. Platt said if he's comfortable,
leave him here for a while and see.
But he's no better.
John kneels down by Marley, who looks at him but doesn't wag
his tail or lick his hand. He runs his hand over his coat -
then over his stomach, the dog flinches.
JOHN
I'm taking him in.
The kids all come into the room, Colleen carrying a stuffed
sheep.
COLLEEN
Is he sick again?
JOHN
Yeah, he is, honey. But I'm going to
take him to the hospital and they'll
try to make him better.
Conor bends down, nuzzles Marley's face.
CONOR
Get better, Mar.
COLLEEN
You can take Lamby, okay?
(she puts the stuffed animal
next to him)
But don't chew her other ear off.
Patrick leans down, hugs Marley tightly and whispers right in
HIS EAR:
PATRICK
Goodbye.
When he looks up at his father, John can see that Patrick's
crying, that he knows what the other two don't.
John stands as Dr. Platt comes out...
DR. PLATT
I did everything that worked before.
But no luck. There's still surgery,
BUT HE'S--
JOHN
--not strong enough.
DR. PLATT
There's blood in his stomach. The
lining might be compromised. I don't
know what we'll find if we go in there
anyway.
JOHN
Can you give me a minute? I need to...
I need to call my wife.
214
Jenny listens to John on the phone.
JENNY
I know.
Jenny nods as tears come. They stay on the phone, quiet,
just being with each other. Finally:
JENNY (CONT'D)
I love you, John.
216
John enters. Marley is on the table, zonked out. Dr. Platt
has put a blanket on the cold metal table so Marley is warm.
DR. PLATT
I'll give you some time.
She goes. John stares down at Marley. Takes the stuffed
lamb out of his pocket, places it under a paw. When John
puts a hand on his flank, Marley's eyes flutter open. His
tail THUMPS gently.
JOHN
Hey, buddy.
He pets Marley's head, runs his hands all over Marley's body.
His coat, still shedding. His tail. He takes up each paw,
each ear, remembering and memorizing at the same time. He
leans down, puts his nose on Marley's neck and breathes him
in. Then he goes around, squats down so he's on Marley's
level. He looks into Marley's eyes.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Listen, you know all that stuff we
always said about you? What a total
pain you are? The world's worst dog?
Well, don't you believe it. Don't
believe it for a minute. You loved us,
every day, no matter what. And that's
a pretty amazing thing.
(he leans in)
(MORE)
121.
217 CONTINUED: 217
JOHN (CONT'D)
Look, I don't know where you're going
from here, but you remember this:
You're a great dog, Marley. You are a
great dog.
In the BEDROOM, Jenny sits on the bed, the phone in her hand,
waiting, we BEGIN PULLING AWAY DOWN THE HALLWAY.
Dr. Platt is in the room now. John, his hand on one of
Marley's paws, kneels on the ground, looking at Marley,
Marley lays on the table, looking right back at him.
DR. PLATT
He won't feel a thing. He'll just slip
away. Are you ready?
JOHN
(looking at Marley)
We're ready.
Dr. Platt inserts the needle into the I.V. and presses the
plunger.
As a pajama-clad Patrick slips a tape into the VCR...
As we now HOLD ON MARLEY'S EYES, slowly beginning to close.
As Jenny sits vigil by the phone, we CONTINUE PULLING BACK.
As Patrick sits alone in the dark living room, his face
illuminated by the TV, as he watches SILENT IMAGES from
Grogan family home videos:
TWO-YEAR-OLD PATRICK rides on Marley's back through the house
at 345 Churchill, young Marley's tail knocking over
everything within range, toddler and dog both joyous.
122.
224
As Marley's eyes finally close. The CAMERA drifts to John's
hand, stroking Marley's side. Dr. Platt listens to Marley's
heart and says:
DR. PLATT
He's gone.
FROM ABOVE, the dog on the table, the doctor discreetly going
to the side, and John laying his head next to Marley and
putting his arms around him as we now...
