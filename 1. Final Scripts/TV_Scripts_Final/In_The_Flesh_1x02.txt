      INT. WALKER HOUSE - KIEREN S BEDROOM - MORNING - DAY 40A0A

      KIEREN, bleary eyed, bad night s sleep in him, crosses to the 
      mirror and looks at himself: pin prick eyes, cover up mousse 
      smudged, patches of pale cold flesh underneath.

      He starts applying cover up liberally and puts in his 
        IrisAlwayscontacts. He picks up an untouched mug of tea, 
      opens his window and pours it out. He looks over to the 
      Burton house opposite where he sees KEN BURTON staring 
      blankly out the window. Catatonic with grief.  

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. WALKER HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING - DAY 455

      STEVE is grilling bacon. It sizzles. SUE is sitting at the 
      table drinking juice. KIEREN walks in holding the empty mug. 

                                    KIEREN
                    Hi. 

                                  SUE
                    Hi.

                    Yer need a refill?

                                    KIEREN
                    No, you re alright. Trying to cut 
                    down.

                                    STEVE
                    Know what you mean. More than three 
                    cups and I m in and out of the loo 
                    all day and all night. And the 
                      colour, I don t know if I should 
                      contact Dr. Garrison about this 
                    Sue, because the colour...

                            (indicating apple juice)
                    Can we not discuss the colour of 
                    your urine at the moment, Steve.

      Steve puts up his hands:  my mistake . He starts serving out 
      bacon on plates.

                                    KIEREN
                    Crazy night. 

      Steve and Sue stop and look at Kieren. A moment of silence. 
      Are they going to broach the subject of MAGGIEgetting shot?  

                                    STEVE
                    Yes. Yes it was. (Beat) According 
                    to reports gale force winds reached 
                      speeds of a 160 miles per hour. 

      Kieren s got his answer: MAGGIEisn t going to be discussed. 

                                    STEVE (CONT D)
                    Lots of trees down. The train 
                      station s completely flooded. 

                                  SUE
                      Flooded? 

                                    STEVE
                    The underpass. We told them, all of 
                    us on the board, we told them last 
                    year that the drainage system was 
                    out of date and needed to be 
                      refitted but they didn t listen, 
                      completely in denial. Then three 
                      inches of rain fall and they re 
                      absolutely buggered.

                                  SUE
                    Are you still going to be able 
                      to...?

                                    STEVE
                    I m on call, but I told Clive not 
                    to contact me unless it was an 
                      emergency.  

                                  SUE
                    Good. (toKieren) Dad s going to be 
                      staying with you today. 

                                    STEVE
                      Precautions. (tryingto defuse that 
                      ominous statement) It ll be fun.

                    So he s not coming to the ceremony?

      Kieren looks up to see his sister JEM coming downstairs 
      dressed in FULL HVFUNIFORM. Kieren notices she s got her 
      pistol in her belt.  

                                  SUE
                    I m going with you. 

      Jem goes to the cupboard, takes out some caramel shortbreads, 
      her staple comfort food. 

                                    KIEREN
                      What s the ceremony? 

      Jem looks at her parents. Their expressions urge her to stick 
      to the plan.  

                                  JEM
                          (to Kieren)
                    I m not allowed to say. 

                                  SUE
                    No, that s not what we said - 

                                  JEM
                    Don t tell your brother about the 
                      ceremony -

                                  JEM
                    Okay so you want me to tell him, do 
                    you? Alright, fine. It s a ceremony 
                      honouring the victims of the 
                      Rising. The people who s brains you

      Jem looks at her mum, dad and half-dead brother, takes out 
      her gun, opens the chamber, checks it s fully loaded. 

                                  JEM

                    Is fucked. 

      ..And with that she exits upstairs. Kieren looks after her. 
      He wants to say thank you for warning him about Bill, he 
      wants to say sorry for...He just wants to talk to his little 
      sister. Perhaps a one on one is in order? 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. WALKER HOUSE - JEM S ROOM - MINUTES LATER - DAY 466

      METALCORE music blares. JEM is chomping on the shortbreads 
      while playing A SHOOT EM UP VIDEO GAME on her game console 
      (she s using a laser gun controller). The game is about 
      blasting away zombies. Knock on the door. 

      The music and the video game sound effects are so loud Jem 
      doesn t even hear the knocking. Finally the door opens and 
      KIEREN tentatively enters. Jem s got some trained instincts 
      on her. She senses a presence. She turns around. Sees Kieren. 
      Snaps: 

                                  JEM
                    What you want?

      Even though he wasn t expecting a smile and a cheery hello, 
      Kieren is still knocked back by his sister s hostility. He 
      gently soldiers on with what he wanted to say:

                                    KIEREN
                      I just, I just wanted to say thank 
                    you. For warning me last night 
                    about Bill and the  -

      Jem snaps up to her feet. If Kieren thought she was hostile 
      before, he ain t seen nothing yet:

                                  JEM
                      I didn t do it for you. I did it 
                    for mum and dad. They re stupid 
                      enough they d have defended you if 
                    Bill had burst in without warning. 

                                    KIEREN
                    Well, either way, I just wanted to 
                    say thanks. 

                                  JEM
                    Not accepted. 

      Kieren stands there. Not sure what to do. Jem looks at him.  



                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 2  FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 5.

                    Fuck off. 

      Kieren puts his hands up (just like his Dad did in the scene 
      previous): he doesn t want a fight. Jem goes back to the 
      video game. Kieren goes to exit. Hears the sounds of the 
      violent anti-zombie game. Stops. Suddenly gets pissed off. 
      Pissed off at Jem for treating him so harshly, pissed off at 
      his parents  denial, just pissed off in general. 

                                    KIEREN
                    So you and Bill Macy are best 
                      friends now? You know he s always

                    GET OUT GET OUT!

      Kieren does. On Jem: conflicted and torn between two worlds. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. WALKER HOUSE - LOUNGE - DAY 46A6A

      STEVE enters to find SUE looking out the window at the place 
      where Maggiewas executed. Steve sees she has the cordless 
      phone in her hand.

                                  SUE
                    I m calling Shirley back.

                                    STEVE
                    Why?

                                  SUE
                    I m going to tell her what really 
                      happened to Maggie. 

                                    STEVE
                    No love, I thought we agreed on

                    It s Bill.  The Saviour of 
                      Roarton . Please, love; for 
                      Kieren s sake. We can t afford to 
                    make trouble.

      Sue relents. He has a point. But she s not happy about it.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 2  FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 6.

      Steve looks down. Doesn t say anything as she exits out the 
      room giving him the cordless phone as she does so.

      INT. MACY HOUSE - STAIRS - DAY 477

      BILL is on the stairs. Smoking, looking into the lounge 
      where:

      SHIRLEY is talking to JANET. 

      Bill listens. 

                                    SHIRLEY (O.S.)
                      ...He ll be coming back today.

      Janet nods.

                    Now centre said you can have access 
                    to a therapist.

                      tapped, Janet. 

      SHIRLEY appears at the door.

                    Bill. Cos Rick, he s gonnabe 
                      different from when yerlast...

      Bill can t hear anymore of this. He goes up the stairs. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. MACY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS LANDING - CONTINUOUS - DAY 47A7A

      BILL crosses to Rick s room. Puts out his cigarette.

      Takes a deep breath. Then enters. 

                                                                            CUT TO:IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 2  FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 7.




      INT. MACY HOUSE - RICK S ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY 47B7B

      It s exactly the same way the day Rick left for basic 
      training. A very teenage lad s room: macho achievements on 
      display (school football shirt with MACY on the back, 
      trophies for various sporting actives, poster of United and 
      glamour models on the walls).  

      Bill pads around the room. He stops by one of the trophies, a 
      karate statue. 

      He picks it up. Runs his hand over the inscription. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      E / I. ARMOURED TRUCK (MOVING) - DAY 47C7C

      An ARMOURED TRUCK, with tinted windows, races down the road. 
      In the front is the DRIVER (34) and, in the back, opposite an 
      ARMED MILITARY ESCORT (25), is RICK MACY (20). 

      We don t see Rick face-on, just the back of his head. His leg 
      is in a METAL BRACE. Rick (face unseen) looks out the truck s 
      tinted window and sees some graffiti:  SEND ZOMBIE DEMONS 
      BACK 2 HELL . He looks over at the Military Escort. At his 
      weapon: Is he here to protect them from me, or me from them? 

      The Military Escort feels Rick s eyes on him. Looks in his 
      direction and gives Rick such a dirty look it sends Rick back 
      to the tinted window and bare landscape outside. Rick spots a 
      motorway sign informing him he is now entering THE NORTH. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. WALKER HOUSE - KIEREN S ROOM - DAY 488

      KIEREN is sitting on his bed, looking at the photographs on 
      his wall of Rick. He stands up and reaches under the BED. He 
      pulls out a SHOEBOX. Still kneeling he carefully places it on 
      the bed and opens it. He slowly takes out a card with a print 
      of a Vincent Van Goghself-portrait on it. 

      He opens it. We read the inscription inside:

      Dear Ren, Know this guy is your fav. You re gonnago far. And 
      I ll be there right next to you, telling dumb jokes and 
        embarrassing you. This shitewith me Dad. I ll sort it. Swear 
      I will. Rick x  

      It s a compulsion. It hurts to look at it, but in a weird way 
      the hurt comforts him. Proves to him that...what? He has a 
      soul? A knock at the door. STEVE enters. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 2  FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 8.

                                    STEVE
                      Doesn t seem right, you up here all 
                    on yer todd. 

      What Steve really means is he doesn t want Kieren to be alone 
      because the last time he was... well he killed himself. 

                                    STEVE (CONT D)
                    Fancy watching something? 

                                    KIEREN
                    Not sure. 

                                    STEVE
                    I ve got five new Blu-raysjust 
                    come in the post. 

      Kieren doesn't want to watch a bloody blu-ray. 

                                    STEVE (CONT D)
                      They re not gonna watch themselves. 

      Kieren looks at his Dad. He s not taking no for an answer. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. WALKER HOUSE - LOUNGE - DAY 499

      All the curtains are drawn. It s gloomy. KIEREN and STEVE sit 
      next to each other watching an old silent movie on the wide 
      screen TV (NB: we don t see the movie, we just hear the 
      tinkly piano music) The film s jolly sound track is very much 
      at odds with the charged depressing atmosphere in the room.   

      While watching the film, Steve has the Neurotriptyline
      injector in his hand, plus a dose of Neurotriptyline. He is 
      consulting the patient information leaflet Shirley gave him 
      and Sue. A worried Kieren is watching this. Steve sees him 
      watching, tries to divert Kieren s attention.

                                    STEVE
                          (re: film, while preparing 
                            injector)
                    I ve watched this one a thousand 
                      times. Don t mind though. I like 
                      watching films over and over. No 
                      surprises. You know what yergonna
                    get second time around. 

                                    KIEREN
                      Suppose so.

        CONTINUED:99

                                    STEVE
                    We can watch this again straight 
                    after if yer dlike? 

      Kieren s attention is on Steve preparing the injector. 

                                    STEVE (CONT D)
                          (re: injector)
                    Now, would yermind turning around 
                    for me, Kier?

      Kieren does, but a bit reluctantly. Steve finds the blue 
      catheter on the back of Kieren s neck.

                                    KIEREN
                    Dad, are you sure you know what 
                      you re doing?

                                    STEVE
                            (showing Kieren the 
                              leaflet)
                    Don t you worry, I ve read these 
                      instructions back to front.
                          (to Kieren, but also to 
                              himself)
                    Just like taking off a plaster; 
                      quicker yerdo it, less painful it 
                    is.

                                    KIEREN
                    Don t think that s the right-

                                    STEVE
                    Here we go!

      Steve jams the injector into Kieren s neck and pulls the 
      trigger.

      Kieren begins to convulse uncontrollably. Steve drops the 
      injector and holds onto his son. While he holds him there s a  
      KNOCK AT THE DOOR. Steve s head whips around. His face pure 
      panic.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. WALKER HOUSE - HALL WAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 41010

      More knocking. STEVE is guiding a still very groggy KIEREN 
      out the lounge. He opens the door to the BROOM CUPBOARD under 
      the stairs. Kieren, though still pretty out of it because of 
      the injection, clocks what his Dad s doing. 





                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 2  FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 10.

                                    KIEREN
                            (distant, slurring words)
                    No Dad... don t... I m not good in 
                      confined spaces...

                                    STEVE
                    Won t be for long. Promise.

      More knocking. Steve doesn t have time to be sensitive. He 
      reaches into the cupboard, finds a torch, hands it to Kieren 
      while gently pushing him into the claustrophobic space. He 
      slams the door closed and goes to the front door, opens it a 
      crack: it s not an HVF death squad, it s an ESTATE AGENT with 
        a prospective COUPLE. 

                                    ESTATE AGENT
                      Hello, MrWalker.

      Steve looks at him blankly. The AGENT reminds him.

                                      ESTATE AGENT (CONT D)
                    The 11 o clock viewing.

      Steve nods his head. The agent and couple enter. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. WALKER HOUSE - BROOM CUPBOARD - SAME TIME - DAY 41111

      KIEREN sits. Torch on. Trying to fight off the effects of the 
        Neurotriptyline. He can hear his Dad s muffled voice and 
      multiple footsteps. 

                                    STEVE (O.C.)
                          (very muffled)
                      Kitchen. Handy for all sorts of, 
                    uh, cooking. Vegetables, meat, 
                      whatever takes yerfancy really...

      KIEREN listens, still affected by the injection. But also now 
      growing in awareness about where he actually is. He wasn t 
      messing when he said he didn t do well in confined spaces, 
      he s been claustrophobic for years. Kieren looks around him 
      and feels hemmed in, the dark shadows look quite distorted. 
      And everything definitely feels distorted. 

      Kieren s breathing quickens.  The torchlight begins to 
      flicker. Kieren tries to fix it. But it just flickers more. 
      On the last flicker the torchlight illuminates:

      LISA LANCASTER. IN THE CUPBOARD. RIGHT BESIDE HIM. STARING AT 
      HIM.

      Kieren lets out a cry and drops his torch.

      PITCH BLACK. We snap awake. We re in a coffin... Underground. 

      Heavy breathing. Legs kicking out. Fists hit hard wood. Again 
      and again. Harder and harder until the wood cracks and soil

      light a strange almost other worldly colour. Lightening

      their graves including in the grave next to Kieren s AMY

      INT. WALKER HOUSE - KIEREN S ROOM - LITTLE LATER - DAY 42020

      KIEREN watches out the window as his Dad s car drives off. 
      When it s out of sight, Kieren quickly crosses to his 
      wardrobe and opens it. A number of outfits are hung up. 

      Kieren takes out a few and looks at them: Most are 
        alternative PUNK ROCK OUTFITS from his outcast mid teen 
      years. These clothes are meant to make you stand out and 
      that s the last thing he wants to wear right now. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      KIEREN enters his mum and dad s room, opens a closet, and 
      looks through it. Doesn t find what he s looking for. He 
      looks around and there - in a pile of dirty laundry - it is: 
        A TRACKSUIT TOP WITH A HOODIE. Kieren picks it up. Why would 
      he want some stinking tracksuit top? 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      The front door slams and KIEREN (wearing the hoodie) steps 
      into frame. He s out. Incognito. But out all the same. He 
      squints at the daylight and looks down the street. No one in 
      sight. It s now or never. As he walks past Number 11 we see 
      Ken through the curtains, still staring blankly, SHIRLEY sits 
      next to him looking on with sympathy.

      EXT. THE LEAS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 42323

      KIEREN is walking down the street at pace, head down, staring 
      at his moving feet. Once he gets to the woods he ll be safe. 
      Or safer. But right now if one of The Lea s residents gets a 
      good look at him he s done for. But he needs to see it. Has
      to see it. Whatever itis he s risking his safety for. 

      SLAM OF A DOOR. VOICES IN THE DISTANCE. Kieren looks up. 
      Stops dead. From across the street coming out of a semi 
      detached house on the corner, a MIDDLE AGED COUPLE have 
      exited they are DUNCAN and PATTY LANCASTER, (Lisa Lancaster s 
      parents). Kieren s expression: Absolute dread. He knows them. 
      Kieren spins around so his back is to them. A tense moment. 
      Kieren peeks a look over his shoulder. They ve not noticed 
      him and are reversing out of the driveway. He waits until he 
      hears the car driving off.  

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. LANCASTER HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY 42424

      Through a clean patch in the grubby window we see KIEREN 
      turning around and continuing to walk quickly down the street 
      towards the woods. We notice he gives the house a wide berth 
      but he can t help looking up, then quickly averting his gaze.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      NO SCENE 25


      EXT. DISUSED GRAVEYARD - DAY 42626

      We see KIEREN exiting the woods and coming upon a small 
      Gothic cemetery next to a WAR TORN parish church. The whole 
      area has been cordoned off with MAKESHIFT BARRICADES and 
      WEATHERED BLUE AND WHITE POLICE TAPE. Kieren reads a rusted 
      official sign that has been fastened to the chained locked 
      iron gate:   DANGEROUS. QUARANTINED AREA. DO NOT ENTER.  

      Kieren stands there for a minute afraid to trespass. Then it 
      hits him: it s people like him that the sign s warning about. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. DISUSED GRAVEYARD - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 42727

      The overgrown graveyard has been left to nature. No living 
      human has set foot here for years.  Kieren notices that some 
      of the graves have been disturbed, soil unearthed: people who 
      came back in The Rising. Kieren approaches one of them. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 2  FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 15.

      He stops by a black granite stone, stares at the engraving. 
      His former resting place. Written in gold script is:

       KIEREN WALKER
      1991 - 2009
      Gone is the face we loved so dear
      Silent the voice we loved to hear 

      He gets down on his knees. Looks down. There in the earth is 
      his rotting COFFIN. Kieren puts his hand to his head: 
       Christ, what a mind fuck . 

      SOUND OF SOMEONE CLIMBING THE IRON GATE. Kieren snaps out of 
      his reflections. Someone is in the graveyard with him. What 
      to do? Kieren takes cover behind his own gravestone. Tries to 
      make himself small. He hears a FEMALE VOICE. 

                                    FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hi, nan. Cold today isn t it? 

      Kieren hears: plastic bag rustling...blanketbeing laid 
      down... a few moments of silence... then the female voice 
      begins to speak again: Softly, gently. 

                                    FEMALE VOICE (O.C.) (CONT D)
                          (barley audible)
                    It s been a lonely week this week, 
                    Nan. More than it usually is. 

      Kieren frowns. Who is she talking to? He ventures a look:

      Laying on a blanket talking to a gravestone is a YOUNG 
      FEMALE. Her face unseen. She stops talking. Cocks her head. 

      Kieren snaps his head back. Shit. He hears someone getting 
      up. Footsteps on grass. Closer and closer. Moment of silence. 

                                    FEMALE VOICE (O.C.) (CONT D)
                          (close and from above)
                      I know you. 

      Kieren looks up. It can t be. It just can t be. ANGLE ON: The 
      Young Female. We recognize her as Kieren s zombie hunting 
      partner, AMY DYER (18). 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. DISUSED GRAVEYARD - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 42828

      KIEREN RUSHES through the overgrown graveyard running away 
      from Amy. He chances a glance over his shoulder: there she 
      is, jogging after him. The stress makes him remember:

      MEMORIES FROM THE SUPERMARKET AND RABID AMY CHASING LISA 
      LANCASTER. THESE FLASHBACKS ARE QUICK, FLASHING BEFORE 
      KIEREN S EYES AS HE RUNS THROUGH THE GRAVEYARD. 

      FLASH. Kieren s back in the present, running as fast as he 
      can. He checks behind him: no one there. What the- SMACK! 
      Kieren s run into a tree. He goes down, dazed for a moment. 

      He sees a pair of red converse and looks up. There she is: 
      Amy, Cheshire grin on her face. Kieren scrambles up and 
      searches for a weapon. He sees a RUSTY IRON BAR and picks it 
      up. He brandishes it in front of him. Amy laughs. 

                                    KIEREN
                    Stay back. 

      Amy pulls a  OooI m so scared face  and steps forward him. 

                                    KIEREN (CONT D)
                      I mean it!

      Amy continues to advance on him. Forcing Kieren backwards. 

                                  AMY
                    Go on then. Stick me. 

      Kieren doesn t. Instead he keeps retreating. He looks behind 
      him: two more feet and he s going to fall into AN OPEN GRAVE.

                                    KIEREN
                    Swear to god I will!

                     Hit me with your rhythm stick. Hit 
                    me, hit me. 

      Kieren stops. He s at the edge of the open grave. He s boxed 
      in. Nowhere to go. Amy doesn t stop advancing on him. 

                                    KIEREN
                    I m serious! Stop!

      Amy stops. Kieren breathes a sigh of relief. Amy then gives a 
      WAR CRY ROAR and RUNS at him. Oh Jesus! Kieren s got no 
      choice. He holds the iron bar in front of him as protection. 
      Amy runs straight towards it, fearless. Her eyes go wide. As 
      do Kieren s. The iron bar has punctured her stomach. 

      Kieren s in shock as Amy staggers backwards, clutching her 
      abdomen, then collapses. Kieren stands there, frozen. He 
      drops the iron bar and goes to her - she s stiff, not 
      breathing, no pulse:  Christ, I ve killed her!  A moment. 
      Then Amy omits a LOW MOAN. Kieren s eyes fill with fear as 
      Amy, now old school zombiefied, RISES UP. Back from the dead!

      EXT. NEW CEMETERY - ROARTON - DAY 428A28A

      VILLAGERS sit on fold-out chairs among the SIMPLE WHITE 
      CROSSES (think graveyards for fallen soldiers). A particular 
      line of crosses have BLUE ARMBANDS attached to them and GREEN 
      POPPY WREATHS resting at their base. Ex HVFfighters (JEM, 
      GARY, DEAN) are sat in the front row in full uniform. VICAR 
      ODDIE is standing addressing the crowd.

      All eyes on Jem. She s shocked to be singled out. She stands, 
      looks at Sue -  What the hell s going on, mum? .

                    For acts of great heroism in the 
                    face of extreme danger, I (and the 
                      government) present you with the 
                    Medal of Courageous Service. 

      Oddie produces a beautiful medal and pins it on Jem s chest. 
      She s stunned. She certainly wasn t expecting to be honoured. 
      The crowd applaud. Oddie motions for her to give a speech. 
      Jem awkwardly tries: 

                                  JEM
                    I, I wasn t expecting this. I 
                      don t...

      Jem turns and looks at the line of white crosses with green 
      poppies resting on them.  

                                  JEM (CONT D)
                      I wasn t the bravest. Not by a long 
                    shot. 

      Jem takes the medal from her chest. 

                                  JEM (CONT D)
                    If anyone deserves this, it s Lisa 
                      Lancaster. She was the real hero. 
                    Not me. 

      Jem goes to DUNCAN and PATTY LANCASTER. She gives the medal 
      to Patty, who becomes emotional. She and Duncan embrace Jem.  
      The crowd are very touched by this seemingly humble gesture 
      on Jem s part and they give a standing ovation. 

      While the crowd are on their feet, BILL and JANET enter 
      Heroes  Resting Place (the graveyard). Oddie notices them.  

                                    VICAR ODDIE

                    Bill?  

      ON: Bill. He nods:  Alright . The crowd pat Bill on the back 
      as he takes the podium and readies itself for a passionate 
      speech about the HVF srelevance. Bill scans the crowd. 

                                    BILL
                      Rick s coming home. 

      The villagers do a collective double take. What did he say? 

                                    BILL (CONT D)
                    We expect your full support.

      And with that, Bill walks past the open mouthed villagers. 

      Oddie gets it together enough to call after his shepherd.

      Bill takes Janet s hand and exits. 

      Oddie looks back at the crowd: Who explode into CHATTER. 
      DUNCAN and PATTY LANCASTER share a hopeful glance.  

                                    DEAN

                    past in minute detail. 

      Kieren stops. Turns back to her. 

                                    KIEREN
                    How did you know I was doing that? 

                                  AMY
                    I m psychic. 

                                    KIEREN
                          (very serious)
                    Is that another power we possess?

      Kieren s seriousness cracks Amy up again.  

                                  AMY
                    I m not really psychic, dum dum. 
                    Just that s what I did when I first 
                    got back. Looking at old photo 
                      albums, wanting to live in the 
                    past, getting depressed  cos I knew 
                    deep down I couldn t. It s what 
                      you ve been doing since you got 
                    back from the treatment centre, 
                    isn t it?

      Kieren, eyes down, nods.  

                                    KIEREN
                          (still with head down)
                    How did you...stopdoing that? 

      Amy stands. 

                                  AMY
                      I went on day trips. 

      Kieren looks up at her -  Day trips? 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. MACY HOUSE - DAY 43232

      A FEW VILLAGERS including DUNCAN and PATTY LANCASTER have 
      gathered outside the Macyhouse to  welcome  Rick home. 

      SUE and JEM both look apprehensive. Rick coming home is not 
      good for the Walker family. We stay on them for a moment then 
      drift to GARY and DEAN. Both with cans of lager. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 2  FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 22.

      Gary looks at Dean, a tiny bit nervous.  Who knows what will 
      happen next.

      EXT. ROARTON - ROAD - DAY 432A32A

      KIEREN and AMY are at the bus-stop. KIEREN has his hoodie
      right over his face.

                                    KIEREN
                    You swear where we re going is 
                    safe?

                                  AMY
                    Cross my heart and hope to die. 

      An Army Truck barrels past them as they wait. Unbeknownst to 
      KIEREN and AMY RICK MACY is inside.


      INT. MACY HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY 43333

      Behind the front door, JANET and BILL both look terrified. A 
      few moments with the two of them, just their breathing. Then 
      a noise of a vehicle. Sounds of the crowd, excited chatter. 
      Bill and Janet look at each other - he s arrived. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. MACY HOUSE - DAY 43434

      The ARMOURED TRUCK has indeed parked up next to the Macy
      House. VILLAGERS crane their necks to get a better view. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Bill looks out the window. Sees the truck. Turns to JANET. He 
      nods -  He s here.  Janet trembles.  Bill goes to her. 

                                    BILL
                    He s gonnabe the same old Rick. I 
                      promise yerthat, love.

        CONTINUED:3535

      Janet nods. She needed that hug. She goes to break the 
      embrace. But Bill is holding on too tight. Looks like she 
      wasn t the only one in need of a cuddle.  

                                    JANET
                    All those birthday cards we got 
                    him. We can watch our son open them 
                    now.

      Bill takes a deep breath. Breaks the embrace. Looks at 
      himself in the hallway mirror. Puts his  game face  on. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. MACY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 43636

      BILL and JANET exit. Bill s back snaps straight. Janet s 
      mouth snaps into a smile. They present a picture of 
      solidarity and confidence. Deep down they re anything but. 
      The DRIVER gets out the cab and goes around to the back of 
      the truck. He nods at Bill and Janet. They brace 
        themselves... Villagers crane their necks to get a better 
        view...thedriver OPENS the back of the truck and pulls out 
      an extendable metal ramp. The sun is shining so bright, the 
      inside is a black hole. 

      Then the noise of metal on metal. The crowd gasp as they 
      see... RICK MACY (20), dressed in full Military Uniform, 
          walking/shuffling (due to his brace) down the metal ramp. 

      First thing to say about Rick is he s STRIKINGLY HANDSOME. 
      The second thing to mention is he s SHOCKINGLY BANGED UP. He 
      has a LONG GASH on his face that goes from his mouth to his 
      forehead and is held together by METAL STAPLES. Most of his 
      LEFT LEG is metal. He looks like he s been put back together 
      by a very competent DRFRANKENSTEIN. 

      IT IS OBVIOUS TO ANYONE THAT RICK IS INDEED A PARTIALLY 
      DECEASED SUFFERER. 

      JEM puts her hands on her head. Mind blown. The Crowd don t 
      know what to do. Should they clap? Should they boo? It all 
      depends on how Bill and Janet react... Bill is pale faced. 
      Fixed on the spot, as his partially deceased son shuffles 
      towards him. Rick stops just in front of his parents. 

      A pause. Bill s expression is unnerving. What will he do? 
      Like this until.. Bill sticks out his hand. Rick takes it. 
      The tension in the air pops and the crowd applaud. Bill 
      gestures to Oddie to do the same.  Oddie steps up to Rick. 

                                    VICAR ODDIE
                      Welcome home, son.

      Oddie shakes Rick s hand. Philip and most of the villagers  
      eyes grow in wonder - Wow, Vicar Oddie shaking the hand of a 
        PDSsufferer. That s on a par with Ian Paisley shaking hands 
      with Martin McGuinnessback in the 1980 s.  

      Rick looks out into the exuberant crowd, does a little wave, 
      scans the familiar faces, searching for someone. Someone he 
      used to know.  Kieren Walker. Where is he? 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Kieren s flabbergasted he s out in public. Amy grabs his hand 
      and takes him into the run down amusement park. It s off 
      season but there s still SOME PEOPLE floating about, going on 
      the rides, playing knock the coconut, eating candy floss. 

                                    KIEREN
                      Jesus, when you said a day trip I 
                      thought we were going somewhere 
                      secluded, not grand central

                    So? We ve got our contacts in and 
                    cover up on. You wear too much of 
                    that stuff by the way. 

      Amy goes to touch his face. Kieren flinches.

      A bored TOWNIE COUPLE are on the ride as well as well. Crappy 
       scares  start to jump out at them. Amy overplays it, 
      screaming and jumping out of her seat.

      KIEREN and AMY ride the tea-cups. AMY is enjoying herself.

                                    KIEREN
                    You like being... how we are, don t

                    of?

                    Us. 

                                  AMY
                      Death. The Big Sleep. Deep down 
                      fearing the reaper is the reason 
                    why everyone s so messed up in the 
                    head. They know the end is nigh, 
                    but there s nothing they can do 
                    about it so it drives them nuts and 
                    they live their lives with one eye 
                    on the clock. We don t have to do 
                    that. We can smash the clock to 
                      pieces. That s an incredible 
                      blessing.

      Kieren considers this. KIEREN thinks he snatches a glance of 
      LISA LANCASTER in the crowd.... It can t be. He collects 
      himself.  

                                  AMY (CONT D)

      INT. CHURCH RECTORY - STUDY - DAY 43939

      GARY and DEAN sit opposite VICAR ODDIE and a note-taking 
      PHILIP. Vicar Oddie has a face like thunder. 

                                    VICAR ODDIE
                    You want a wage for patrolling the 
                      woods?

                                    GARY
                    Aye. That s right. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 2  FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 28.

                                    VICAR ODDIE
                    What about your sense of community 
                      spirit?

                                    GARY
                    We ve still got that. 

                                    DEAN
                    Just, you know, it takes up a big 
                    chunk of the evening. Don t it, 
                    Gaz? 

      Gary nods. 

                                    VICAR ODDIE
                    And God forbid protecting the 
                      village against rogue rabid 
                      monsters gets in the way of your 
                      drinking time gentlemen. 

                                    GARY
                    Hey, Vicar. We re not saying we re 
                    not gonnado it. But now we re a 
                    man short and me and Dazare gonna
                    have to take on Bill s shifts, we 
                      reckon we should be compensated for 
                    that. 

                                    VICAR ODDIE
                    What makes you believe Bill won t 
                    be doing his patrols? 

      Gary and Dean exchange a look: Oddie is way behind the curve. 

                                    GARY
                    He's got his family back. Gonna
                    want to start looking for work. 
                    Won t have time to faffaround in 
                    the woods - 

                                    VICAR ODDIE
                    The patrols are not faffingaround. 

                                    GARY
                      Whatever you say, Vicar. But if yer
                    want us out there, yergonnahave 
                    to show us some appreciation. 

                                    DEAN
                    Just want to be appreciated, Vicar. 
                      That s all. 

      Vicar Oddie stares at them. They re not going to budge. He 
      sighs. Turns to Philip.  



                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 2  FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 29.

                                    VICAR ODDIE
                    Is it feasible?

                                    PHILIP
                      Budget s tight, but it s feasible. 

      Vicar Oddie turns back to Gary and Dean. He s lost. 

                                    VICAR ODDIE
                      You ll get your money. 

      Gary and Dean try not to look too pleased. They stand.  

                                    GARY
                    Thank you, Vicar. 

                                    DEAN
                      Tavery much. 

      Vicar Oddie gives him a sharp look. 

                                    DEAN (CONT D)
                      Vicar, Sir. (Under his breath)
                      Whatever. 

      Gary and Dean are exiting. Before they can:

                                    VICAR ODDIE
                      There llbe a patrol tonight. 

      Gary and Dean stop and silently curse. They were both hoping 
      to get lathered tonight at the pub. They play a quick silent 
      game of rock, paper, scissors. Dean loses (he always loses 
      these games). Curses. Gary laughs. 

                                    DEAN
                    Why do I always lose? 

                                    GARY
                     Cos you always go fer paper yer
                    soft tart. 

      Gary and Dean exit arguing. Oddie goes over to the painting 
      of the horsemen. He s agitated. It s all slipping away. 

                                    VICAR ODDIE
                    Has Bill been in touch. 

                                    PHILIP
                    I got through to Janet. They re 
                    going to The Legion tonight. 

      It dawns on VICAR ODDIE what that means.

      bottle SHATTERS. RICK cocks a rifle. We see that his bottle 
      targets are a good 50 metres away at the other end of the 
      garden. He s a tremendous shot. BILL has his rifle and a 
      beer, marvelling at his son. Janet s nowhere to be seen.

      BILL shoots at bottles. He s not half as good as Rick. It s

      doesn t like to see his father unhappy. JANET appears with a 
      flask of tea and some sarnies.

                    They did go through that bad patch 
                      before The Rising. 

      Rick turns his head. Bad patch? 

                                    BILL
                      Selfish of him.

                    He killed himself.

      EXT. FUN FAIR - DAY 44545

      KIEREN, hoodieup, watches AMY on a daredevil ride. He can t 
      help but smile at her joie de vivre. Deep down her lust for 
      life is something he wishes he had. He would like to be a 
      daredevil himself. Slowly he reaches up and puts the hoodie
      down.  

                                    YOUNG MAN (O.C.)
                      Kieren?  

      Kieren freezes. Doesn t turn around. 

                                    YOUNG MAN (O.C.) (CONT D)
                      Kieren? Kieren Walker? 

      Kieren slowly turns around to see the Young Man with his 
      Girlfriend beside him.  

                                    YOUNG MAN (CONT D)
                    How are you.... (alive)? I went 
                    to... (your funeral)? You re a 
                      rotter. HE S A ROTTER!

      PEOPLE turn and look at Kieren. Their eyes filled with fear. 
      Kieren doesn t know what to do. His breathing quickens.  



                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 2  FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 35.

      All the crowd are staring daggers at him.  He s a rotter, 
      he s a rotter! . He sees, oh God he sees LISA LANCASTER
      amongst them.   He stumbles back from the apparition, bumps 
      into a BUNCH OF TEENAGE GIRLS who let out HIGH PITCHED 
      SCREAMS. The screaming is infectious and the crowd PANIC. 
      Kieren makes a fast exit.  

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. SEASHORE - EARLY EVENING 445A45A

      KIEREN is running towards home as if his life depends on it. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. WOODS - EARLY EVENING 44646

      KIEREN reaches the woods on the outskirts of Roarton. He s in 
      bad shape. The unexpected encounter with his old school mate 
      and  outing  has combined to make Kieren extremely stressed. 
      The forest isn t helping matters. He decided to go the 
        untroddenroute to avoid people and right now the trees, 
      branches and brambles are all fighting against him. 

      A low moan in the wind. Kieren stops. Listens. Just the wind 
      in the trees. Then another moan. This one more audible. Who 
      the hell said it?

      SOUND OF A BIRDS TAKING FLIGHT. 

      Kieren turns to where what has disturbed them: A FIGURE 
      standing in the distance. It s not an untreated zombie that 
      the spraying missed. It s something much worse then that... 
      It s LISA LANCASTER. She s standing next to a great oak. 
      Staring right at Kieren. She s wearing her dirty HVFoutfit. 
      Blood all over her. Dead eyes. Exactly how Kieren left her. 

      She stares at him with her dead eyes. Kieren stares back, 
      completely stunned.  

      After a moment Lisa Lancaster turns and walks away. 

      Kieren has to follow her. He does. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. WOODS - CAVE - DAY 446A46A

      KIEREN is trying to keep up. He comes out into a clearing and 
      sees: Lisa entering a cave entrance. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 2  FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 36.


        CONTINUED:46A46A

      Kieren stops. Looks to where Lisa has lead him. A cave. By 
      his expression we can tell it s not just a random cave. This 
      cave means a lot to him. So much so in fact that he cannot 
      enter.  

      Kieren gives the cave one last pensive look, then turns and 
      leaves. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. ROARTON  - BUS STOP - EVENING 44747

      Kieren exits the woods, takes a breather at the Bus Stop. As 
      he catches his breath he looks up at the village NOTICE 
      BOARD: the place during The Rising for relatives to put up 
      missing persons posters.

      Most of the posters (think 9/11 missing person posters) are 
      still up but with RED CROSSES or BLACK TICKS on them. Only 
      ONE poster has no markings, in fact this poster looks newer 
      then the others. The unmarked poster is of LISA LANCASTER. 

      Kieren stares at LISA S MISSING POSTER. It depicts a smiling 
      Lisa in casual clothing, her arms around a happy pet dog. 
      It s a strikingly human image. Written below the photo is:

       MISSING. LISA LANCASTER. Our daughter went missing on a 
      supply mission on March 23rd during The Rising. Praying for 
      the best. Any information please call us  

      Kieren s horrified. For multiple reasons: 1. Lisa Lancaster s 
      body went missing after he and Amy killed her. That s news. 
      And 2. Her parents, Mr. & Mrs. Lancaster, don t know for sure 
      that she died. Kieren knows. He was the one that killed her.   
      Kieren reaches out and plucks the poster off the board.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. MACY HOUSE - RICK S ROOM - EVENING 44848

      RICK sits on his bed in the middle of his pristine room. He s 
      dressed to go out in some of his old clothes: Ben Sherman 
      branded shirt, jeans, leather shoes, hair gelled. He is 
      staring at the big Utdteam poster on the wall. Thoughts 
      churning inside of him. Thoughts of Kieren. Rap on the door 
      and BILL enters holding two cans of lager. Rick snaps up, his 
      posture rigid. He literally comes to attention for his dad. 

                                    BILL
                    Not doing well. 

      Rick looks at his Dad alarmed. Has his poker face betrayed 
      him? Does Bill know how upset he is about Kieren?



                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 2  FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 37.

                      I hear City s scorching. 

      Bill shakes his head.

                    Might  aveto switch teams.

                    Don t you dare, I ll kill yer. 

      Bill gives Rick the lager. Rick takes it but doesn t open it.

                                    BILL
                      Should. Got a right to be proud. 

      Bill opens his can and puts it up for toast. This is Rick s 
      cue to do the same. He does. 

                                    BILL (CONT D)
                    To you coming back in one piece, 
                    son. 

      Rick toasts. Bill drinks. Rick does the same. 

                                    BILL (CONT D)
                      Right. Down that and we ll be off.

                    Aye. 

      Bill exits. 

      Rick stands there for a moment. Then grasps his stomach. The 
      liquid is burning his insides. He looks at the full can of 
      lager in his hand, waiting to be drunk. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. BACK GARDEN - WALKER HOUSE - EVENING 448A48A

      KIEREN comes around the back of the house to the garden. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 2  FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 38.

      He s sweaty and out of breath. He s run all the way home. He 
      opens the back door and enters the house. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. LOUNGE - WALKER HOUSE - EVENING 448B48B

      KIEREN gets in the house. Breathes a sigh of relief -  God, 
      that was close.  He crosses the lounge. Sees out of the 
      window that STEVE, SUE and JEM are outside the front door, 
      having a clandestine pow-wow.

      After a few moments of heated words (mainly between Jem and 
      Steve), Jem walks towards the house, followed by her parents. 

      Kieren quickly goes from the window and...whatshould he do? 
      Appear normal! He sits down. Tries to act like he s been in 
      this position for ages. 

      The door goes. 

      Kieren realizes he s still holding Lisa s missing poster in 
      his hand. Shit! He stuffs it in his Dad s hoodiepocket just 
      as his sister enters. 

      Jem stops, looks at him, is she going to tell him? No she 
      silently passes. 

      Sue enters after her.  

                                  SUE
                          (trying her best to act 
                            like everything s normal)
                    Hi, love.

      Sue nods, doesn t want to get into a big long explanation 
      about where they ve just been (Rick s welcoming home 
      ceremony).

                    Oh, hello there.

      On Kieren realises-  Oh shit, I forgot to take it off 

      Kieren s hand goes to the pocket. If he gives it back now his 
      Dad will find the missing poster.

      INT. THE LEGION - BAR AREA - NIGHT 450A50A

      PEARL s in the middle of taking down the FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS 
      of HVFfighters posing with their zombie kills. Amongst the 
      clientele is DUNCAN and PATTY LANCASTER.

      Gary tutsloudly.

      PHILIP is placing one fold out chair in a grotty corridor 
      next to the bogs with a makeshift  RESERVED  sign and a mangy 
      Velvet rope. This is for RICK. No one really knows what to do 
      with him. PHILIP s in a bit of a fluster, after his 
        conversation with VICAR ODDIE, this is his plan.

      The bell above the door rings. The pub tenses up as:

      It s RICK flanked by BILL and JANET. We notice Rick is 
      wearing his medals. Just like his dad wanted him to. 

      The regulars stare at Rick -  Bloody hell, here he is, in the 
      flesh . 

      PHILIP begins to tentatively approach RICK, intending to show 
      him to his  seat . He s cut short by:

                                    BILL
                      Right,

                    Who s buyin drinks fer Desert

      The regulars look at each other -  Well, if Bill s alright 
      with Rick being in here, better fall in line . They begin to 
      offer to get drinks for Rick:  Pint of bitter, fer lad  
       Lager fer Rick   Whiskey chaser, Fer the war hero . PHILIP

      SUE and STEVE around the table with KIEREN, who is pretending 
      to eat his food again. JEM isn t at the table, instead she  
      keeps her distance, standing by the door, playing with her 
      food and staring daggers at her brother.  

                                  JEM
                    Does he have to do that?

      KIEREN opens the door to a smiling AMY. No cover up on. No 
      contacts. She looks like the living dead. Kieren reacts. 

                                    KIEREN
                    Jesus Christ, what have you done to

                     Cos that would have been giving

      Amy s words about giving in stir something up in Jem 
      (secretly she believes she  gave in  when she didn t do her 
       duty  in the supermarket). It s the boiling point for her 
      and before she explodes, she jumps down from the breakfast 
      bar and exits the house without a word.

                    No thanks, Mrs. Walker. My insides 
                    are pretty decrepid. I eat solids 
                    and it goes straight through. Tried 
                      eating a Mars bar couple of days 
                    ago. Had to throw away my knickers 
                    andmy skirt.

      Sue and Steve take this in. Kieren gets up. Keen to stop Amy

      She s upset about seeing Amy, it s brought up a lot of 
      repressed feelings inside her (we ll see why later).

      Jem waits for a reply. No reply. She spots DEAN S TRUCK and 
      waves him down. She comes up to the passenger window. Dean 
      sits there. A FLASK and a HANDHELD GAMES CONSOLE (old crappy 
      one) on the seat next to him. Rifle jammed in between the 
      seats. He s off to patrol the woods.

                    if my Nan paid up in advance).

      Kieren takes a deep breath. He unbuttons his shirt cuffs and

                                    PHILIP
                    Vicar Oddie did say he d be on his 
                    way, Bill.

                                    BILL
                    He s offending me, Philip. By not 
                    being  ere. He s offending me.  

      Bell rings.  

                                    PHILIP
                      This llbe him. 

      Bill and Philip turn to the door. It s not Oddie, it s AMY. 
      Quite obviously, sans cover up and contacts, a PDSsufferer.  

      EVERYONE SHOCKED.Jaws on the floor. It s that classic scene 
      in a Western when all falls silent and even the pool balls 
      come to a halt.

      Silence. All eyes on Amy. 

                                  AMY
                    Take a picture, lasts longer.

      Murmurs and whispers from the regulars:  Bloody hell, it 
      speaks! ,  Talks like a real person! 

      Then another surprise as KIEREN enters. If anyone s jaw 
      wasn t on the carpet, they are now -  Fuckinghell, two 
      Rottersin the Legion. Who d have ever thought it? 

                                    PEARL
                          ( wow wee )
                      They re all coming out the woodwork 
                      tonight.

      Kieren and Amy slowly and carefully move towards the bar. Any 
      sudden movements and these people could attack!

      One person that looks like he d attack is BILL. But he isn t 
      because his wife JANET is present and has her hand on her 
      husband s arm. 

      Janet s hand on Bill s arm is enough to quell action, but 
      Bill still feels he has to say something:

                                    BILL
                    We allowing rottersin ere, now?

                    Two of those then. 

      Pearl gets the lemonades. Kieren and Amy stay at the bar. 
      Kieren can feel Bill s eyes on him. 

      BILL turns to PHILIP, who is staring agog at Amy.

                                    BILL
                    You gonnasort this, or am I?

      PHILIP, still dazed by the visage of Amy, makes his way over 
      to KIEREN and AMY.

      Kieren shakes his head. PHILIP appears before them. He can t 
      really keep his eyes off Amy. She looks even more fascinating 
      close up.

                                  AMY (CONT D)
                    What are you looking at?

                      Where?

                                    KIEREN
                    Hi Phil. 

      Philip doesn t even acknowledge Kieren. He s all about Amy, 
      this amazing, beautifulpartially deceased creature. He s 
      absolutely awed by her.

                                    PHILIP
                      (Pointing off, still has his eyes 
                    fixed on Amy)
                    Over there.

                          (not impressed at all)
                    Big wows.

                                    KIEREN
                    Hey. That s good, Phil. I remember 
                      politics was always something you 
                      wanted to get into, wasn t it?  

      Philip, who s attention has been laser-sighted on Amy, 
      finally notices Kieren standing there. The spell s broken a 
      bit. 

                                    PHILIP
                    Yeah. It s, you know, a lot of 
                      pressure, a lot of work. You have 
                    these ideas about what it s going 
                    to be like and then...

                                  AMY
                    And then you re asking people to go 
                    into a segregated area. 

                                    PHILIP
                    It s not up to me.

      Amy opens her mouth to protest. Kieren beats her to it. He 
      collects his and Amy s drinks, nods for Philip to lead the 
      way, glad to get away from all the stares and whispers. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. THE LEGION - CORRIDOR NEXT TO TOILETS - DAY64A64A

      PHILIP guides KIEREN and AMY towards the chair designated for 
      Rick and hastily pulls over another seat. 

                                  AMY
                            (sarcastic)
                    Wow, it s the VIP lounge. 

                                    PHILIP
                    (as he places the second chair)
                    Enjoy your night. 

      Philip gives Amy a sly once over, is about to leave when...

      Rick exits the mens s toilets wiping his mouth. He sees 
      Kieren. Freezes. Turns to ice. He does. If you were to go up 
      to him now and push him he d topple over and smash into a 
      million little pieces. Kieren goes up to the edge of the PDS
      sufferer area. Rick snaps back into reality. Notices out of 
      the corner of his eye Philip looking at him. 

                                    RICK
                      Alright, mate?  

      Rick sticks out his hand. It trembles ever so slightly. 
      Kieren looks at Rick. At his outstretched hand. He s stunned 
      by Rick s response. He was expecting... what? Fireworks? A 
      passionate embrace? Maybe not, not here, but certainly he 
      wasn't expecting an  alright mate  and a bloody handshake. He 
      takes Ricks hand none the less. 

                                    KIEREN
                    It s good to see you, Rick. 

                                    RICK
                    Yeah. Good to see you too, Ren. 

      Rick s eyes dart over to Philip. He takes his hand back. 

                                    RICK (CONT D)
                          (beat)

                      Right. Well I can t go out there.

                    Why not?

      Kieren looks at Rick. Really? You really don t know why?

      Rick turns to Philip.

      PHILIP backs off. Rick lifts rope for Kieren. Kieren looks at

                    Sure. If she must. 

      Kieren and Amy exit out the PDSsufferers  area.

      EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 46565

      A bright full moon illuminates DEAN trekking through the 
      woods on patrol. Dean has his rifle slung over his shoulder 
      and is in the middle of playing a zombie shoot emup game on 
      his HANDHELD GAME CONSOLE. 

                                    DEAN
                    Have that yerrotters. 

      Dean s just got a new high score. A SMALL FIGURE passes 
      behind him. TWIGS break under its feet. Dean stops. The game 
      is urging him to play on. He turns around: Complete darkness. 
      Just black shapes and... Something there. A faint outline. 
      It s watching him. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 2  FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 59.


        CONTINUED:6565

      Dean slowly raises his games console like a torch. The 
      trembling blue LCD light hits branches, leaves and... A TREE. 
      Dean relaxes -  Just a stupid tree, yersoft get.  Then a 
      noise. What sounds like a MOAN. From just over the 
        embankment. Dean spins around. More audible MOANING.  Dean 
      swings his rifle round. He slowly moves up the wooded 
        embankment. As he climbs the embankment the sounds become 
      louder. Dean gets to the top of the embankment. Peeks over 
      it. 

      ANGLE ON: Dean s face. Frozen in surprise. He s looking at 
        a...RABIDMALE ZOMBIE. In a clearing. With a dead sheep. The 
      Rabid Male Zombie cocks it s head and looks at Dean and 
      ROARS. Dean freaks out. 

      He STUMBLES backwards, loses his footing and TUMBLES down the 
        embankment. Losing his rifle in the process, he finally thuds 
      to a halt at the bottom. Dazed. He shakes his head, trying to 
      clear the stars. Then he hears a PANTING SOUND. With a 
      trembling hand he takes out his GAMES CONSOLE and shines the 
      LCD up at: THE RABID MALE ZOMBIE. Right next to him. So close 
      that Dean can smell the Rabid s rotten breath. 

      The Rabid Male Zombie SNARLS. Dean SCREAMS. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. THE LEGION - BAR AREA - NIGHT 46666

      KIEREN and AMY sit at RICK S table. RICK drinks and chats 
      with Kieren. GARY eyeballs Amy. 

      From the bar, BILL and JANET stare at Kieren, wary. Is the 
      past repeating itself?

                    And he flew right off the path and

                    Yeah? 

      To  prove it  Rick slugs the last of his pint.

      Rick gives Amy daggers. He knows just as she does that 
      they re nevercoming out.

                    On what?

      Before Rick has to answer he s saved by DEAN who crushes into 
      the pub, covered in sweat and mud.

                    Dad, can Rentag? 

      Bill stops. He turns back, face thunder, his sights on 
      Kieren, even though it was Rick who asked the question (in 
      Bill s warped head Kieren must have put Rick up to asking the 
      question somehow).

      Bill slowly approaches Kieren.

      RICK and KIEREN sit in the darkness. The only sounds are a

      RICK is trekking through the woods.

                    Think we re lost. 

      No reply. Rick looks behind him. Kieren s nowhere to be seen. 

                                    RICK (CONT D)
                    Ren? 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. WOODS - ENTRANCE TO CAVE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 47676

      KIEREN is standing at a distance, looking over in wonder at: 
      an untreated RABID MALE ZOMBIE (the same one that chased 
      Dean). The Rabid Male Zombie is outside the entrance to THE 
      CAVE we saw before. The Rabid Male Zombie is in the middle of 
      hollowing out a DEAD SHEEP s head. He isn t tearing the sheep 
      apart and eating the grey matter like an animal, he is 
      CAREFULLY putting the pieces of brain on a stone next to him. 
      As if preparing the table for supper. Kieren can t take his 
      eyes off his untreated counterpart. RICK appears. 

                                    RICK
                    Hey, it s the old den - 

      Kieren turns to Rick and shushes him. He points to where the 
      Zombie is. Rick sees him and scrambles for the walkietalkie.  

                                    KIEREN
                    Wait. 

      Kieren indicates to the cave. The Zombie s finished preparing 
      the brains. It lets out a gentle moan. An untreated LITTLE 
      GIRL ZOMBIE exits the cave. She s about eight. Pale as the 
      moon. Hair matted. Eyes pin pricks. The Sunday school white 
      dress she was once buried in now in tatters. She shuffles to 
      the Male Zombie who offers her a piece of grey matter. She 
      takes it and then plops down next to him. The Rabid Male 
      Zombie makes sure she s eating, then he begins to feed.  

      Kieren watches, marvelling at this primitive domesticity. 
      Rick watches, then presses the button on the WalkieTalkie.

      The crackle of the walkietalkie startles the Rabid Male 
      Zombie and Rabid Little Girl Zombie.  They look up.  See 
      Kieranand Rick.  They shuffle away from them at pace.

                                    RICK

                      What s up with yer?

      The two zombies are making their way through the clearing.

      Rick goes to chase after them.

                                    RICK
                    Come on, Kier.

      Kieran, quite relunctantlysets off after the two rabid 
      zombies with Rick.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      RABID MALE ZOMBIE and RABID LITTLE GIRL ZOMBIE are shuffling 
      as fast as they can away from:

      RICK and KIEREN.  Hot on their tail.

      From another part of the clearing we see GARY and Bill join 
      the chase.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. WOODS - MINE CAVE ENTRANCE - NIGHT 47878

      RABID MALE ZOMBIE holding the RABID LITTLE GIRL ZOMBIE s hand 
      are shuffling towards the mine cave entrance tailed by BILL, 
      GARY, RICK and KIEREN. 

      For the zombies escape is possible if they can just enter the 
      cave and it looks like they might achieve their goal. They re 
      at the cave s mouth when:

      THE RABID LITTLE GIRL ZOMBIE IS ZAPPED BY A TASER. 

      She goes down.

      She s been zapped by DEAN who has been waiting for them at 
      the cave mouth.

                      A set! Know how much government 
                    pays for a - AGGGHHHHH!

      In his stupid delight, he forgets about the RABID MALE 
      ZOMBIE, who has just bitten him for zapping his daughter. 

      The posse get to them and before the Male Zombie has a chance 
      to inflect any more damage to Dean, he s taseredby GARY. 

      Dean is in a panic.  He rolls around.

                                    DEAN (CONT D)
                    I ve been bit! I ve been bit!

      Dean looks at Kieren. Then looks at his wrist watch. Dean 
      checks himself. No, he s not  turned  into a rotter. AWKWARD.

      Shame faced Dean gets to his feet. Looks sheepishly in Gary s 
      direction. Gary has a face like thunder.

      untreated Zombies being tied up ready for transport. He s in

      Rick shakes his head. Cocks his rifle. KIEREN instinctively 
      puts his hand out to stop him. Kieren rubs his face. Cover up 
      comes off. He takes out one contact lens and looks at Rick 
      with the same eyes as the Male Zombie and the Little Girl 
      Zombie: Pin pricks.  

      RICK raises his gun again to the ZOMBIES. KIEREN stands

      Bill sighs. Rick has failed him. Goes towards the rabids. He 
      aims his rifle. Pulls the trigger. The rifle jams. Bill 
      curses. Checks the gun. Tries again. Rifle is jammed again. 
      Bill throws the rifle to the ground.
