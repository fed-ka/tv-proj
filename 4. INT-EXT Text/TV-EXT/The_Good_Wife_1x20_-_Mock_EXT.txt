      ...Alicia sees a cab approaching, waves for it.  Out of 
      service, it passes.  Alicia lowers her hand, looks at the ring 
    on her finger.  Considers it.  She hears her cellphone ring.  
      Checks the caller.   Will.   Answering:

                                  ALICIA
                    Hi.THE GOOD WIFE #119     "Mock"     BUFF COLLATED     4/15/10        3.




      Alicia hangs up, waves down a cab.  Opens the door when she... 

      ...pauses, seeing a man approaching.  Crossing the street 
      toward her.  It takes Alicia a disbelieving second, watching 
    the man approach.  And she suddenly gasps, realizing it s...

      ...Peter.   Alicia slams the cab door, rushes toward him, 
      horrified.  A concerned gasp:

                                  ALICIA
                    Peter, no.

                                  PETER
                    I love you.

                                  ALICIA
                    No, you can t be down here!  No--

      Alicia looks around, horrified!  As Peter finds himself 
      single-minded, only eyes for her...

                                  PETER
                    Just don t leave me.

      Alicia takes him by the arm, drags him back...

                                  ALICIA
                    You need to be upstairs-- 

                                  PETER
                    I can t lose you.  I can t lose 
                    Zach and Grace--

    But she hits speed-dial on her cell, rushing, pulling him--

                                  ALICIA
                    Daniel, DanielGolden, please.  Tell 
                    him it s an emergency.  I don t care 
                    where he is!  Peter is going to be 
                    arrested in about twenty minutes!  

      Meanwhile--

      ...the Sheriff and another officer heading in: toward the 
      elevator.  Ummm.  What now?  Alicia pauses, considers it, 
      reverses course, starts in,... 


      A squat nondescript windowless building.  Bland 1990s 
      government architecture.  Inside...


      Amal nervously fiddles with a small FLASH DRIVE, eyeing the 
      Pujari TRAVEL AGENCY in the MINI-MALL down the street.  

                                  AMAL
                     PAL-one, two, three? 

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes, just three files.  That s all 
                    they want.  You won t be alone. 
                    Look.

    She points to TWO SEDANS parked up the street.

                                  AMAL
                    Did you tell them about the Pujari 
                    brothers?

                                  ALICIA
                    Belkin knows your bosses are 
                      potentially dangerous.  He also 
                    knows you ve done nothing wrong.

                                  AMAL
                    And he ll keep his promise to 
                    release my mother? 

                                  ALICIA
                    We have a deal in writing.

      Amal nods, goes to the door.  Sweating, nervous:

                                  AMAL
                    Here I go.

                                  ALICIA
                    Amal.  Take a deep breath.  Just 
                    think of your mom.  I have somebody 
                    in there if anything goes wrong.  
                    Okay?

      Amal nods.  He crosses the street toward the mini-mall. 


      Alicia watches Amal and Kalinda through the window.  Hard to 
      see.  Too many travel posters in the way.


      ...the street is filled with shouts-- Hands on your head!  
      Now!  Hands on your head! -- a sudden charge of Feds with 
      guns, Belkin in the lead...

                                  BELKIN
                    Federal agents, don t move!

      Kalinda with a photo of the gems.  The Merchant is nice, 
      patient.  A meticulous suit.  Kalinda points at the photo:

                    See, here, they look like they were 
                    mounted on a necklace or something.

                                  MERCHANT
                    The box is another matter.  

      Kalinda turns back. 

                                  KALINDA
                    You recognize the box?

    The Merchant nods, points toward the tin box in the photo.

                                  MERCHANT
                    It s a camphor box.  It s sold 
                    here, in the market.
