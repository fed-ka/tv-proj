      INT.  GYMNASIUM - DAY

      ANDY FAIRBELL, a slight, pasty gym teacher, is standing in
      the middle of a gymnasium inside the school logo of the
      McKinley High School Fightin' Tariffs mascot painted on the
      floor.  He addresses a group of students.

                                    ANDY
                    Honor.  Integrity.  Courage under
                    fire.  Enthusiasm.  A decent throwing
                    arm.  These are all attributes you'll
                    need today in dodgeba...

      Andy gets smashed in the face with a cherry ball thrown by
      BRYCE, a hulking, studly lacrosse player.  He staggers in
      and out of frame, blood now dripping from one nostril.

                                    ANDY (CONT'D)
                    Okay, that's the enthusiasm I was
                    talking about, Bryce, but we haven't
                    started yet.  When I blow this whistle-

      Andy touches the whistle to his mouth and immediately gets
      hit in face again.  He begins choking on the whistle and
        coughing/whistling.  After a moment he manages to dislodge
      it.

                                    ANDY (CONT'D)
                    Okay, game on!  Go ahead without me.

      He staggers to the bleachers as the kids swarm the court.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      INT. SPANISH CLASSROOM - DAY

      LOREN PAYTON paces in front of his class, frustrated.

                                      LOREN
                    You're not hearing me!  It's not
                    Madrid.  It's Madrith.  With a "th." 
                    And I want to hear that "th."  Here's
                    an example: "Yo vivo en Madrith con
                    mi famila: Maritha, Thancho, and mi
                      bithabuelo, Thantiago."

      It is revealed that his class is made up of all Mexican-
      American students.

                                      HISPANIC STUDENT
                    Nobody talks like that, bud.                                                                                      2.

                                      LOREN
                      Correction, everybody in Spain talks
                    like that, bud.  And you know why? 
                    The language was invented there.  I
                    know you all think that because you
                    were taught a bastardized version of
                    this beautiful dialect you can skate
                    through my class, but we speak the
                    queen's language in here. 

      Loren turns his back to write something on the chalkboard.

                                      HISPANIC STUDENT
                    You're a queen, maricon.

      The classroom laughs.  Loren turns back.

                                      LOREN
                    I think I heard someone just call me
                      a butterfly.  So...GRATHIAS!

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      EXT. HISTORY CLASSROOM - DAY

      A handwritten sign above the words "History Class" reads
      "People's."  Muffled ranting can be heard through the window,
      as well as the sound of someone trying to open a locked door.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      INT. HISTORY CLASSROOM - DAY

      The class is split into two factions: one chubby student
      sitting beneath a banner that reads, "Boss Man," and the
      rest across from him beneath a banner that reads, "Working
      Man."

      BEN SHOEMAKER is wearing an outdated dress shirt and tie. 
      The sleeves are rolled up revealing his tattoos and he is
      drenched in sweat.  He addresses a student trying to leave
      the locked classroom.

                                    BEN
                    Do you have to go to the bathroom,
                    Teresa? 

      On the verge of tears, she nods and crosses her legs.

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    Oh!  Well why don't you ask your
                    boss down at the coal mine?  Hey,
                    Boss Man, can Teresa go to the
                    bathroom?                                                                                      3.

      The student beneath the "Boss Man" banner shakes his head
      and laughs while chomping an unlit cigar and greedily counting
      his Monopoly money.

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    Oh, well, looks like that's a big
                    no.  Take your seat!  You should be
                    happy you even have a seat.  Because
                    in 1902 the poor United Mine Workers
                    of America weren't so lucky.  They
                    had to call in old Teddy Roosevelt
                    for help.  Now do you want Teddy R
                    to intervene?

      The classroom begins to plead for his help.

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    Alright, then.

      Ben slams the bat on his desk.

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    You've dined on the backs of the
                    working man for the last time, porky!

      Ben starts advancing on the terrified "Boss Man".

      INT. LIBRARY - MORNING

      Loren enters a mostly-empty library carrying a huge stack of
      books.  While crossing the room he passes Bryce, who is seated
      at a computer station looking at pornography with a few
      friends.

      ABBEY LOGAN, the young, beautiful librarian, is seated behind
      the counter engrossed in a novel.  Loren drops the large
      stack of books on the counter.

                                      ABBEY
                    Wow.  You read all of those books in
                    one night?

                                      LOREN
                    Yeah I did.  These books ruled. 
                    High five literacy!

      Loren puts his hand up for a high-five.  Abbey awkwardly
      returns the high-five.  She begins checking his books in.

                                      ABBEY
                    Okay.  Let's see, 'Films of Lifetime:
                    The Biography of Meredith Baxter-
                    Birney'.

                                      LOREN
                    That one got me.

                                      ABBEY
                    'Ma'am on the Moon: How Sexism Kept
                    the First Woman Out of Space.'

                                      LOREN
                    So unfair.

                                      ABBEY
                    Are you just checking out books you
                    think will impress me?

                                      LOREN
                    What?  No.  Why, are they impressing
                    you?

      She smiles at him.

                                      LOREN (CONT'D)
                    What are you reading?

                                      ABBEY
                    I'm reading Game of Thrones again.                                                                                      5.

                                      LOREN
                    Awww, that cool show with all the
                    tits and the dragons?

                                      ABBEY
                    Yeah, it's also a book.

                                      LOREN
                    Well, if I did want to impress you,
                    it'd probably be something along the
                    lines of...a couple of pitchers of
                    margs and Karaoke?

      The bell rings. 

                                      ABBEY
                    I think you have get to class. 

                                      LOREN
                    I'll just check these out.

      Loren grabs a pile of random novels that Abbey had just
      checked in.

                                      LOREN (CONT'D)
                    Awwwww, Jane Austin.  Shit!

      Loren passes the computer station Bryce is seated at.

                                      BRYCE
                          (under his breath)
                    Swing and a miss, faggot.

                                      LOREN
                    You know what they say, Bryce: the
                    most homophobic people are those
                    trying hardest to cover up their own
                      homosexual tendencies.

      Loren begins to walk away.

                                      BRYCE
                    Is that how you found out, Loorrren?

      Loren stops, turns back, and leans in.

                                      LOREN
                    I've scored more pussy than you've
                    had wet dreams about, Bryyyyce.  So
                    why don't you come talk to me when
                    your right testicle descends.  It
                    shouldn't be hard to find me.  Just
                    look for the biggest cabin on pussy
                    lake, bitch.                                                                                      6.

      Proud of himself, Loren rises to leave only to run into
      PRINCIPAL BARRY QUINN, a fresh-faced, idealistic, twenty-
      something, who has been standing there the whole time.  He
      has a "McKinley Recycles" button pinned to his shirt.

                                      LOREN (CONT'D)
                    Principal Quinn!

                                      PRINCIPAL QUINN
                    I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.

                                      LOREN
                    Good, because I'm pretending like I
                    didn't say it. 

      Bryce can now be seen in the background pantomiming sexual
      positions with one of his buddies.

                                      PRINCIPAL QUINN
                    I look at you, Loren, and I just see
                    this big cloud of negative energy.

      Loren examines his shirt, searching for a stain.

                                      PRINCIPAL QUINN (CONT'D)
                    You know what need?  You need to
                    detox your body with some kombucha. 
                    Then you need to detox your mind
                    with my 90 minute faculty yoga class.

                                      LOREN
                    You know, I'd love to Barry but my
                    schedule is just so full of anything
                    else.

                                      PRINCIPAL QUINN
                    As you know, Loren, I'm going to
                    have to cut several positions by the
                    end of the school year and I hope
                    that your name won't be on that list.

                                      LOREN
                    I hope so too.

                                      PRINCIPAL QUINN
                    You do know that I'm your friend,
                    right Loren?

      Principal Quinn tries hard to make eye-contact.  Loren looks
      in every different direction but his eyes.

                                      LOREN
                    Yeah, I know.                                                                                      7.

                                      PRINCIPAL QUINN
                    Good.  Let's hug it out.

      Loren keeps his arms at his side, while Principal Quinn
      embraces him.  Loren follows.  Bryce now has his buddy pinned
      down on a table by the neck and is pretending to hit that
      ass from behind.

                                    LAX PLAYER
                    Bryce, enough, bro!  They're gone
                    now!

      INT. TEACHERS LOUNGE - DAY

      Ben is engaged in a heated argument with ROD KNORR, an aged
      drunk fossil, who is also a history teacher at McKinley. 
      Other teachers mill about the room.

                                    BEN
                    Duty?  You were a pawn, that's what
                    you were.  A puppet for the oligarchy. 
                    Did you ever think to ask why you
                    were there?

                                    ROD
                    Don't talk to me about duty.  I was
                    calling in air-strikes on the Highway
                    of Death while you were jacking off
                    to a JC Penny catalogue.

      Rod removes a flask from his pocket and pours it into his
      coffee.

                                    BEN
                    You smell like Jimmy Buffet.

                                    ROD
                      Cheeseburger in Paradise, comrad!

      Ben walks over to Loren, who is helping Andy stop his
      nosebleed.  Andy is starting to develop black eyes.  Seated
      near them is GLADYS, an ancient typing teacher who seems to
      be perpetually asleep.

                                    ANDY
                    I've swallowed so much blood that I
                    think I can skip lunch.

                                      LOREN
                    That's not healthy.

                                    ANDY
                    I'm cutting out carbs so I'm pretty
                    sure it's cool.  It's like a smoothie.                                                                                      8.

                                    BEN
                    Dodgeball again?  Why do you even
                    continue to teach it at this point?

                                    ANDY
                    It teaches social hierarchy, Ben.  I
                    think you of all people would
                      appreciate the lesson.

                                    BEN
                    Well, I think it's noble of you to
                    take the jester's role in that
                      hierarchy.

                                    ANDY
                    That Bryce Turner is a sociopath.

                                      LOREN
                    Bryce did this to you?  That little
                    bastard just got me in trouble at
                    the library.  Principal Quinn reminded
                    me about the staff cuts.  Again.

                                    ANDY
                    Well I don't have anything to worry
                    about.  P.E. and Home Ec. are what
                    we call "life skills".

                                      LOREN
                    Please, you'll be the first to go.

                                    BEN
                    Says the guy who teaches Spanish to
                      Spanish-speakers.

                                      LOREN
                    It's a core-credit, shit-for-brains.

                                    BEN
                    So's History.

                                      LOREN
                    Not the kind of history where you
                    break a kid's collar bone throwing
                    desks around.

                                    BEN
                    Hey!  You want to learn about slave
                      insurrections, you got to break a
                    few eggs. 

                                    ANDY
                    That Bryce Turner is gonna to get
                    what he has coming to him because
                                      (MORE)                                                                                      9.

                                    ANDY (CONT'D)
                    one day I'm gonna be the one holding
                    the cherry ball.

                                      LOREN
                    Not if I see him first.

                                    BEN
                    It's because you two are little
                    bitches, that's why he keeps messing
                    with you.  You have to demand respect.

                                    ANDY
                    I think he respects me.

                                    BEN
                    He doesn't respect you.

                                    ANDY
                    How do you know?

                                    BEN
                    Because I don't respect you.

                                      LOREN
                    We should come up with a plan.

                                    BEN
                    That's a great idea!  Or, maybe you
                    could be adults, and not let a 16-
                    year-old get under your skin.

      Gladys snores herself awake.

                                      GLADYS
                    He who seeks revenge digs two graves.

      Gladys falls right back asleep.  The three teachers stare at
      her for a moment.

                                      LOREN
                    Does she mean one grave for herself?

                                    BEN
                    I don't know, man.  I'm gonna get
                    out of here.  I'll see you guys
                    tomorrow.

                                    ANDY
                    Say "fight" to the missus for me.

      Ben exits.                                                                                    10.

                                      LOREN
                    You want to go check the Lost and
                    Found for cool hats?

                                    ANDY
                    Yeah, I could use some sunglasses!

      A sleeping Gladys and Rod, who is now chugging his spiked
      coffee, are the only two left in the room.

      EXT. BEN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

      Ben's house is a modest, one-level ranch in a rundown
      neighborhood.  On the lawn three silhouettes are throwing
      rolls of toilet paper into the trees.

      INT. BEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Ben is asleep in bed next to his wife CRYSTAL.  They both
      wake suddenly to the sound of wet objects hitting the house. 
      He rises from bed and opens the curtains just as an egg smacks
      the window.

                                    BEN
                    You little friggin' punks!  Oh, man.

      Ben puts on Crystal's slippers and runs out of the room,
      muttering curses.

      EXT. BEN'S PORCH - NIGHT

      The front door snaps open and Ben emerges in just slippers
      and tight white underwear. 

                                    BEN
                    What are you little ingrates doing
                    out here?!

      Three kids are trying to rip up his mailbox.  Ben looks down
      and notices a flaming bag.

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    Damn it!  I know what's in this, but
                    I don't own a fire extinguisher.

      He starts stomping the bag.  Dog feces explodes all over his
      shins and slippers.  The three kids begin laughing and Ben
      gives chase.  The kids retreat, jumping into a convertible
      driven by Bryce Turner.

                                      BRYCE
                    Nice slippers, commie!

      They peel off, chanting Bryce's name.                                                                                    11.

                                    BEN
                    Communism has great ideals; it's
                    been ruined by the greed...

                                      NEIGHBOR (O.S.)
                    Shut the hell up, Shoemaker!  Some
                    of us are trying to sleep.

                                    BEN
                    Our rights as homeowners are being
                    violated!

                                      NEIGHBOR (O.S.)
                    Fuck you!

                                    BEN
                    Fuck you!

      INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

      Ben slams his tray down at a cafeteria table where Loren and
      Andy are already sitting.

                                    BEN
                    Alright I'm in.  Let's get this
                    fucker.

                                      LOREN
                    I told you he'd come around.

                                    ANDY
                    Why the sudden change of heart, Mr.
                    Mature? 

                                    BEN
                    What?  Can't a guy stick up for his
                    friends?

      Loren shushes them both.

                                      LOREN
                    Shhh, there she is!

      All three turn toward the lunch counter, where the beautiful,
      buxom lunch lady, ADRIANA, has just emerged.  In slow motion,
      she ladles macaroni and cheese onto student's plates.  A
      large gob falls into her cleavage.  She seductively scoops
      it up with her hand and then begins sucking on her fingers. 

                                    BEN
                    I want a divorce.

                                    ANDY
                    Those are some carbs I could eat.                                                                                    12.

                                      LOREN
                    If anyone needs me, I'll be in the
                    staff bathroom masturbating.

                                    BEN
                    Alright, back to Bryce.  If we're
                    gonna hit this kid, we gotta hit him
                    where it hurts.

                                      LOREN
                    Exactly.  And what does Bryce love
                    more than anything?  Lacrosse.  And
                    what can lacrosse players NOT do?

                                    ANDY
                    Play baseball? 

                                    BEN
                    Have consensual sex?

                                      LOREN
                    Both good guesses.  The answer is
                    drugs.  Student athletes have to be
                    drug free.  So if someone just happens
                    to get busted with drugs...

                                    BEN
                    So, what?  We knock the kid out,
                    stuff him full of narcotics, Maria-
                      Full-of-Grace him across the border?

                                      LOREN
                    Jesus, no.  We plant them in his
                    locker.

                                    ANDY
                    Ah, I'm pickin' up what you're puttin'
                    down.

                                      LOREN
                    Good, because I'm laying it on pretty
                    thick.  The only problem is getting
                    the drugs.

                                    BEN
                    I can get drugs.

                                      LOREN
                    Yeah we're not talking about your
                    blood pressure medication here.

                                    BEN
                    Neither am I.  I'm talking about
                    hitting the streets, where I came
                    up.                                                                                    13.

                                    ANDY
                    I can get drugs, too.

                                    BEN
                    You couldn't score hash in Amsterdam.

                                    ANDY
                    That's actually harder than you think. 
                    I'll tell you where they're not
                    selling, the Anne Frank house.  No,
                    I'm going straight to the source.

                                    BEN
                    Dealers?

                                    ANDY
                    Urine.  Lip's lie, bladders don't.

                                      LOREN
                    Well, while you two DEA agents are
                    out there fumble-fucking this up,
                    I'll just hit up my Saturday detention
                    kids.  Bring whatever you score Monday
                    morning, bright and early.

      Ben points.

                                    BEN
                    Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys, it's happening
                    again!

      All three turn to see Adriana spilling a huge, wet slice of
      meatloaf into her cleavage.  Ben and Andy cringe.

                                      LOREN
                    Still hot.  I'm sorry.  That's still
                    hot.

      END ACT ONE

                                    ACT TWO

      INT. GYMNASIUM - AFTERNOON

      Andy is standing in front of a table full of small plastic
      cups.  His students are seated in the bleachers.

                                    ANDY
                    I'm gonna give you one last chance. 
                    Raise your hand if you have drugs
                    and you won't get in trouble. 
                      Otherwise, it's piss test time.

      No one raises their hands.                                                                                    14.

                                    ANDY (CONT'D)
                    I know at least one of you is on
                    drugs.  Save us all the trouble. 
                    It's Friday afternoon, you want to
                    get started on the weekend.  Go ahead
                    and start it here.  With the truth.

      The students remain silent.

                                    ANDY (CONT'D)
                    Last chance.  This is the real last
                    chance.  No one?

      He waits for anyone to speak up.

                                    ANDY (CONT'D)
                    Okay this is the actual real, real
                    last chance.  Seriously.  3, 2, 1,
                    last chance over.  Grab a cup and
                    bring me your pee.

      INT. BEN'S BEDROOM - MORNING

      Ben is standing in front of a mirror wearing an Adidas track
      suit, trying to look tough while whispering to himself.

                                    BEN
                    What, you holdin' shit?  You carryin'
                    some dope?

      CRYSTAL, Ben's wife, walks in.

                                      CRYSTAL
                    Honey, have you seen my fluffy pink
                    slippers?

                                    BEN
                    Oh, hey, baby.  Ummm....no.  Did you
                    check the...

      Ben just finishes the sentence by trailing off into nonsense. 
      Crystal gives him an odd look.

                                      CRYSTAL
                    Are you psyching yourself up for
                      something?

                                    BEN
                    Oh, this.  No.  Milo and I are going
                    to the park.

                                    MILO (O.S.)
                    I don't want to go to the park!                                                                                    15.

                                      CRYSTAL
                    Oh.  Well, you look like a rhythm
                    guitarist for Korn.

      Crystal leaves the room.

                                    BEN
                    She's right.  Just gotta be me.

      MILO, Ben's young son, enters the room.

                                    MILO
                    What's with this park bullshit?  You
                    said we were gonna go buy drugs.

                                    BEN
                    Sssshhhh!  Just get in the car.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      INT. LIBRARY - MORNING

      Loren is standing in front of a group of pathetic misfits
      during Saturday morning detention.

                                      LOREN
                    A lot of people are going to tell
                    you that Saturday morning detention
                    is a punishment.  Not me.  See I
                    come from the John Hughes school of
                      discipline, where Saturday morning
                    detention isn't a punishment, but an
                      opportunity.

      He begins pointing at the students.

                                      LOREN (CONT'D)
                    An opportunity for the jock to get
                    to know the goth chick with all the
                    dandruff.  An opportunity for the
                    dangerous heart-throb to get to know
                    the foxy ginger chick, who's also
                    kind of a bitch a lot of the time.

      A redhead student student stares back at him, sullenly.

                                      LOREN (CONT'D)
                    But also an opportunity to maybe
                    break out a joint or two, and smoke
                    it because the guy running detention
                    is gonna be gone for like, the next
                    twenty minutes.  Be young.  You're
                    gonna get older.  It's unavoidable. 
                    It just happens.                                                                                    16.

                                    MALE STUDENT
                    Huh?

      Tears can be seen on Loren's cheeks.  He pauses and stares
      eerily.

                                      LOREN
                    When you grow up, your heart dies.

      Loren exits the library.  The students look perplexed. 

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      INT. TEACHERS LOUNGE - MOMENTS LATER

      Loren enters the teacher's lounge.  He picks up a newspaper
      and starts to sit down, only to realize that Gladys is still
      seated in that chair, asleep.  Startled, Loren jumps up. 
      Realizing that Gladys did not wake up and that she has a Hot
      Pocket in her hands, he removes the Hot Pocket and replaces
      it with a chalkboard eraser.  He exits, snacking. 

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      EXT. URBAN STREET CORNER - DAY

      Ben's beat up mid-90's Toyota Tercel pulls up to a group of
      black kids standing on a corner.  Outdated rap is blaring
      from the car stereo. Milo is in the back seat.

      INT. BEN'S CAR - DAY

                                    BEN
                    Alright, wait here, buddy.  I've
                    gotta go talk to these guys about
                    some ill product.

                                    MILO
                    If you get killed, can I drive home?

      EXT. URBAN STREET CORNER - DAY

      Ben exits the car and begins making his way to the group.

                                    BEN
                    What up, bloodclot?

      The group looks confused.

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    Peep this: my boy and I are out
                    trolling for some of that candy to
                    bring back to my Nubian queen.  You
                    got a line on some of that New Jack
                    shit?                                                                                    17.

                                      STREET KID #1
                    Huh?

                                    BEN
                    You know.  That sick shit.  That
                    stuff that make you mad foul.

                                      STREET KID #1
                    Are you a cop?

                                    BEN
                    No, I'm a teacher.

                                      STREET KID #2
                    Awww, shit.

      Everyone exhales and relaxes.

                                      STREET KID #2 (CONT'D)
                    We give you sad fools a discount.
                    What you need: Lithium, Ritalin,
                    Xanax?

                                    BEN
                    What could get me in the most trouble?

                                      STREET KID #3
                    This guy's freakin' me out, man.

                                    BEN
                    Heroin.  Do you have heroin?

                                      STREET KID #1
                    Fifty bucks!

                                    BEN
                    Damn!  Wow.  Hold on.

      Ben walks back to the car and leans in Milo's window.

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    Hey, let me borrow $15.  I'll get
                    you back.  I need this.

      Milo licks his thumb and counts out the money from a large
      roll of cash.  Ben returns to the group and starts counting
      out the money.  All the corner kids are staring at him.

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    Fifteen, Twenty.  What?  Oh, this
                    isn't for him...

      Ben gestures to Milo.                                                                                    18.

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    It's for another kid. 

      Ben hands the cash over and the kid hands him three small
      balloons.

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    Thanks a lot.  I really appreciate
                    this.  You guys be safe. 

      Ben starts walking back to the car.

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    And remember to keep reading.  The
                    most dangerous thing in the world is
                      a teenager who arms this weapon...

      Ben taps on his temple.  He climbs in the car and squeals
      off.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      INT. LIBRARY

      The misfit detention students are still seated in the library. 
      Loren enters.

                                      LOREN
                    Okay.  I'm back.  Anything happen
                    while I was gone?

      Loren begins sniffing the air, trying to detect pot.

                                      LOREN (CONT'D)
                    Doesn't smell like weed at all in
                    here?  No drug use whatsoever?  What
                    have you guys been doing?

      Loren notices a student scribbling on a piece of paper.

                                      LOREN (CONT'D)
                    What are you writing?  A love letter?

      Loren picks up the piece of paper.  It's a drawing of a
        machete-wielding psychotic clown standing over a decapitated
      teacher.

                                      LOREN (CONT'D)
                    This is the shit you guys are into: 
                    psycho clowns?  Nobody's making new
                    friends?  No one's making out in the
                    back of the library?

                                      FEMALE STUDENT
                    No, but he fingered me.                                                                                    19.

      All the kids laugh.

                                      LOREN
                    Awww, that's not what I meant.  I'm
                      disappointed in all of you.  I weep
                    for your generation.  Now who's gonna
                    sell me a joint?

      Every kid shoots a hand into the air.

      END ACT TWO.

      INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MORNING

      Loren, Andy and Ben are all standing in the hallway doing
      their best to look inconspicuous.  Bryce approaches his
      locker, escorted by Principal Quinn and the school police
      officer, OFFICER WINSLOW.

                                      LOREN
                    Uh-oh, McGruff the Crime Dog here to
                    take a bite out of something!

                                    BEN
                    Ooooooh, someone's in trouble.

                                    ANDY
                    Yeah and his name is Bryce.

                                      PRINCIPAL QUINN
                      Gentleman, don't the three of you
                    have anywhere better to be?

      All three shake their head no.

                                      OFFICER WINSLOW
                    Open your locker, son.

      Bryce opens his locker and a comical amount of over-the-
      counter drugs fall out: bottles of ibuprofen, flu medicine,
      etc.

                                    ANDY
                    I think I see some Sudafed in there. 
                    Don't people use that to make meth?

      Officer Winslow searches further in Bryce's locker.  Bryce
      appears shocked.

                                      OFFICER WINSLOW
                    What do we got here?  Oh, looks like
                    a reefer stick.  Oooh, a couple of
                    reefer sticks.                                                                                    20.

                                      LOREN
                    Dope is for dopes, Bryce.

                                      OFFICER WINSLOW
                    Whoa!  Is that?  It is!  Jesus, that's
                    three balloons of black tar heroin! 
                    Bryce, I'm actually impressed.

                                    BEN
                    Uh-oh!  Felony possession of a
                    Schedule 1 Controlled Substance on
                    school property?  If I'm not mistaken,
                    that's an automatic academic and
                    athletic suspension.

                                      PRINCIPAL QUINN
                    I really wish we could hard-talk
                    this out, Bryce.  But Mr. Shoemaker's
                    right.  Let's go.

      Principal Quinn and Officer Winslow begin to escort Bryce
      away. 

                                    ANDY
                    Hey Bryce, heads up!

      Andy fires a cherry ball that misses Bryce entirely and hits
      Principal Quinn in the back of the head, nearly knocking him
      over. 

                                      PRINCIPAL QUINN
                    Coach Fairbell are you serious right
                    now?!  Get over here.

      Andy follows along pouting like a child. 

                                      PRINCIPAL QUINN (CONT'D)
                    What are you doing?

                                    ANDY
                    Bryce started it.

                                      PRINCIPAL QUINN
                    That's your excuse?  Bryce started
                    it?

      Over Principal Quinn's shoulder, Loren and Ben begin
      pantomiming gay sex moves.  Andy can't help but chuckle. 
      Principal Quinn turns and catches them in the act.

                                      PRINCIPAL QUINN (CONT'D)
                    That's it.  All of you get to my
                    office.  I'll deal with you after I
                    deal with Bryce.                                                                                    21.

      Ben and Loren reluctantly follow along.

      INT.  PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE WAITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Loren, Andy, and Ben sit on a bench opposite, TAMARA SHERMAN,
      the principal's hefty, black secretary.  The buzz from the
      harsh, fluorescent lights is the only sound.  The phone on
      her desk rings and rings.  

                                      LOREN
                    Are you gonna get that?

                                    MRS. SHERMAN
                    That's the problem.  You all act
                    like children, now you in charge of
                    children.  It's a damn shame.

      All three roll their eyes.

                                    MRS. SHERMAN (CONT'D)
                    Oh sure.  Like Mrs. Sherman don't
                    know what she talking about?  You
                    all three need to get your shit
                    together or else you'll be joking
                    around in the unemployment line.

                                      LOREN
                    Hey Tammy, did I ever tell you I
                    value the opinion of a Chili's
                    waitress more than the crap that
                    comes out of your head?

      Mrs. Sherman stands up and rounds her desk wielding a stapler.

                                    MRS. SHERMAN
                    Oh that's how we gonna be?  Okay. 
                    Y'all wanna wrestle?  Let's wrestle!

                                    BEN
                    He didn't mean any harm, Tammy. 
                      Apologies.

                                    MRS. SHERMAN
                    You need to keep a leash on your
                    boy.  You come at me like that in
                    the parking lot it's gonna be a whole
                    different story.

      Suddenly Mr. Turner, Bryce's father, an impressive man in an
      impressive suit, shoulders past Mrs. Sherman, directly into
      the principal's office without knocking.

                                    MRS. SHERMAN (CONT'D)
                    Go ahead.  Just stroll right in as
                    you please.  Pay me no mind.                                                                                    22.

                                    ANDY
                    Did you guys get a whiff of that? 
                    That guy smelled amazing.  I'm pretty
                    sure that was CK 1.

                                    ADAM
                    You're an idiot.  That was definitely
                    Drakkar Noir.  Pure class.

      Mr. Turner enters the principal's office and exits almost
      immediately with Bryce in tow.  Bryce flashes a shit-eating
      grin at the three of them.  Principal Quinn yells from his
      office.

                                      PRINCIPAL QUINN (O.S.)
                    I'm ready for you three now.

                                    MRS. SHERMAN
                    The principal will see you now.

                                      LOREN
                    You serve a very valuable function
                    at this school, Tammy.

      INT.  PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY

      A stressed-out Principal Quinn sits at his desk like a man
      who has just been verbally flogged.  His office looks like a
      liberal arts college dorm room: a Buddha on the desk, Nepalese
      prayer flags in the background, an acoustic guitar in the
      corner, etc. 

                                      PRINCIPAL QUINN
                    Take a seat.

      The three teachers sit.  Principal Quinn bobs a tea bag in
      his mug.

                                      PRINCIPAL QUINN (CONT'D)
                    I'd offer some of my caffeine-free
                    chai ginger spice tea, but I don't
                    believe in positively reinforcing
                    negative behavior.

                                      LOREN
                    So how long is Bryce suspended? 
                    Three weeks?  A month?  A month!   
                    You iron-balled son of a bitch.  I
                    didn't think you had it in you.

                                      PRINCIPAL QUINN
                    Don't worry about Bryce, worry about
                      yourselves.                                                                                    23.

                                    BEN
                    Wait.  Don't tell me he's getting
                    off, Barry.

                                      LOREN
                    Student's actions have to have
                      consequences, Barry.

                                    ANDY
                    Yeah, Barry.

                                      PRINCIPAL QUINN
                    Coach Fairbell, what's the name of
                    your gymnasium? 

                                    ANDY
                    Andy's Thunderdome: 15 students enter,
                    11 leave?

                                      PRINCIPAL QUINN
                    The actual name.

                                    ANDY
                    Turner Gymnasium?

                                      PRINCIPAL QUINN
                    Sound familiar?  As in Zebulon Turner,
                    Bryce's great-grandfather?

                                    ANDY
                    Oh, I thought they named it after
                    Tina Turner.  That's where I got the
                    whole Thunderdome thing.

      Principal Quinn leans back and sighs.

                                      PRINCIPAL QUINN
                    Look, we're all trying to keep our
                    jobs here.  Or at least I am. 

                                    BEN
                    So that's it?  The star lacrosse
                    player gets caught with $50 worth of
                    smack and gets off scott-free? 
                    Because daddy gives money to the
                    school?  We're just supposed to walk
                    out of here like that's justice?

                                      PRINCIPAL QUINN
                    No, you're supposed to sit here while
                    I add yet another written warning to
                    your files.  And you're lucky that's
                    all you're getting.                                                                                    24.

                                      LOREN
                    I don't know if there's enough room
                    in my file.

                                    MRS. SHERMAN (O.S.)
                    Oh, I'll start another one for you.

                                      LOREN
                    Barry, do you ever just confuse her
                    for Eddie Murphy in a fat suit?

                                      PRINCIPAL QUINN
                    I think you gentlemen have classes
                    to get to.

      The three teachers get up and leave.  Principle Quinn picks
      up his acoustic guitar and begins strumming, singing with
      his eyes closed.

                                      PRINCIPAL QUINN (CONT'D)
                    "I'm like a bird, I wanna fly away. 
                    I don't know where my home is, I
                    don't know where my soul is."

      He stops singing and lays his forehead on the edge of his
      desk.

      INT. LIBRARY - DAY

      Loren enters the library with an armful of books.  Abbey is
      behind the desk.

                                      ABBEY
                    There's no way you're done with those
                    books already.

                                      LOREN
                    Did you know a lot of these are also
                    movies?  Speaking of movies, I was
                    thinking what if you and I...

                                      ABBEY
                    Listen, Loren you're cute...

                                      LOREN
                    You're right.

                                      ABBEY
                    But I don't date co-workers.

                                      LOREN
                    Well, good, because I'm probably
                    gonna be fired soon.                                                                                    25.

                                      ABBEY
                    I'll tell you what, how about when
                    you get fired, you give me a call?

                                      LOREN
                    That sounds like a date.

                                      ABBEY
                    It's not.  Hey, did you hear about
                    Bryce Turner?

                                      LOREN
                    What?  No.

                                      ABBEY
                      Apparently they found a ton of drugs
                    in his locker.  Weird stuff too:
                    heroin, ladies multivitamins.  How
                    have you not heard about this? 

                                      LOREN
                    I make it my policy not to meddle in
                    student affairs.

      A student couple walks by, holding hands.

                                      LOREN (CONT'D)
                    Trevor, are you dating Trisha now? 
                    What happened to Heather?  You guys
                    were so good together.

      Abbey just stares at Loren.

                                      LOREN (CONT'D)
                    I should go.

      Loren grabs a new stack of books and exits.

                                      LOREN (CONT'D)
                      Awww...Joy Luck Club.  Shit!

      INT. HISTORY CLASSROOM

      Ben is seated on a stool between the same, unfortunate "boss
      man," and the group under the "working man," banner.  As he
      talks, he angrily throws small pieces of paper and paper
      clips offscreen.

                                    BEN
                    See the thing about justice, class,
                    is sometimes you have to go out and
                    take it for yourself.
                                      (MORE)                                                                                    26.

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    Sometimes you just have to take
                    yourself a little piece of the pie
                    and say, "This slice is for me,
                    system.  But see sometimes, even
                    after you've eaten that pie, the
                    system finds a way to bore into your
                    stomach, fish between your blood and
                    your guts and take that little piece
                    of pie right back.  Why?  Because
                    he's the goddamn pie-maker!  So you
                    have two choices.  You can either
                    give up like a coward, or you can
                    continue to fight, celebrating even
                    the pettiest of victories as though
                    they were giant, giant battles. 
                    Because in the end, you certainly
                    didn't stop the Boss Man, but at
                    least you made his day just that
                    much worse.

      The Boss Man student is now revealed, covered in the various
      items Ben has been throwing.

                                    BOSS MAN
                    Does anyone want to switch roles?

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      INT. GYMNASIUM - AFTERNOON

      Andy is standing in front of his class, a stack of lab reports
      in his hand.

                                    ANDY
                    I have the results of your urine
                    tests here.  First of all, congrats
                    on being honest.  None of you are on
                    drugs.  Which surprises me, but also
                    makes me kinda proud.  We do have
                    some issues here, though.

      Andy begins looking through the reports.

                                    ANDY (CONT'D)
                    Okay, Harrison, you're hypoglycemic,
                    if you didn't already know.  That
                    means low blood sugar, so have some
                    Mike & Ike's.

      Andy tosses him a box of candy.                                                                                    27.

                                    ANDY (CONT'D)
                    Joel, you need to drink more water,
                    up your electrolytes.  Your pee was
                    like gravy.  Beth, congratulations,
                    you're pregnant! 

      The kids all turn to stare at BETH, who is mortified.

                                    ANDY (CONT'D)
                    I don't know if you already knew
                    that or not.  Hey, class, eyes up
                    here.  That info is confidential
                    between Beth and her doctor.  And
                    me.  And all of you.  Doesn't leave
                    the Thunderdome.

      EXT.  MCKINLEY HIGH SCHOOL - AFTERNOON

      School buses are pulling up in front of the school.

      INT. TEACHERS LOUNGE

      Ben, Loren and Andy all look out the window.  Andy uses
      binoculars.

                                    BEN
                    I think you're all being hard on
                      yourselves, we executed that plan
                      perfectly.

                                      LOREN
                    Yeah except now I'm out twenty bucks
                    on those "reefer sticks."

                                    BEN
                    You think that's bad, I'm out fifty
                    bucks on that smack.  Plus I owe my
                    kid money now.

      Rod is seated nearby, reading a newspaper.  He clears his
      throat.

                                    ROD
                    Told you Sallies you should have
                    gone this route from the get-go.

      Loren takes the binoculars from Andy.

                                      LOREN
                    He's right, I actually like this
                    better.

                                                                                  CUT TO:                                                                                    28.

      EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

      The thugs that Ben bought the heroin from are taking turns
      pummeling Bryce.

                                      BRYCE
                    Do you know who my dad is?!

                                      STREET KID #1
                    I don't even know who my dad is.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      INT. TEACHERS LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

                                    ANDY
                    Did you tell them to lay off the
                    face?  Because they're definitely
                    not laying off the face.

      Ben is now using the binoculars.

                                    ROD (O.S.)
                    Why would he tell them to lay off
                    the face?

                                    BEN
                    Why would I tell them to lay off the
                    face?  Well, I'm going home.  See
                    you tomorrow.

      The bell rings.  Fade to black.

      THE END
