A black screen.
The sound of a knife cutting through boot leather.
Fade in on the waists of two men (THE SURGEONS) hovering
around a crude operating table.
In the extreme background, TWO STRETCHER BEARERS are just
leaving.
SURGEON 1 (O.S.)
Is this the last one?
One of the bearers stops and looks back. His face is numb.
And he nods hollowly.
We cannot see the patient stretched out on the table. But we
do see that the first surgeon has succeeded in getting the
man's boot off.
SURGEON 2 (O.S.)
God, what a mess... at least there's
no gangrene.
SURGEON 1 (O.S.)
There will be if it doesn't come
off.
SURGEON 2 (O.S.)
Well I can't saw if I can't keep my
eyes open.
Let's coffee up... he
can wait a few more minutes.
As the TWO SURGEONS duck through a tent flap in the background
we see a mangled foot, torn by shrapnel, it oozes blood from
a cut clear to the bone.
LIEUTENANT JOHN J. DUNBAR'S eyes are now open. He's a young
man, his features sharp and handsome. With effort, he lifts
his head and searches the room.
His eyes come to rest on the form of a legless man lying in
bloodsoaked sheets. He's whimpering like a child.
Dunbar comes to a sitting position on the operating table.
As his eyes move around the room they come to rest on a crate
filled with the boots of men who have lost their legs.
A cane travels through space and deftly hooks one of the
boots.
Lieutenant Dunbar brings the boot onto the operating table.
He tries to pull it on his mangled foot, but the pain makes
him cry out. Deliberately he breaks the cane and sticks a
piece of it between his teeth.
Tears of pain are rolling down his face. A sweat has broken
out on his forehead and with great determination he pulls
the boot on.
The operating table is empty save the broken cane and a small
pool of blood. Dunbar is gone.
LEGEND: ST. DAVID'S FIELD, TENNESSEE - 1862
Silhouetted against the outside, Lieutenant Dunbar pauses in
the wide doorway of headquarters. We can hear the distant
sounds of work and life coming from the outside but in here
it's strangely quiet.
A SERGEANT sits at a desk in the foyer. Across the way, at
another desk, is an enlisted CLERK. Both men glance from
their paperwork at the man in the doorway. But it's only a
glance and they go right on shuffling paper.
Footfalls sound in a hallway and a blue-eyed officer with
slick, black hair swings into the foyer. He too has a
slackness that echoes the dreariness of this post.
The blue-eyed officer, LIEUTENANT ELGIN, and Dunbar meet at
the doorway. Dunbar glances down at a scrap of paper in his
hand.
DUNBAR
Where can I find Major... Fambrough?
ELGIN
Turn right... all the way to the end
of the hall.
Being roughly the same age and rank these two might idle
awhile, but Dunbar is eager. He's already moving.
FAMBROUGH (O.S.)
Lt. John J. Dunbar.
DUNBAR
Sir?
Dunbar stops and turns, peering down the hallway. No one is
there.
Sitting behind the desk, holding a set of orders is MAJOR
FAMBROUGH.
FAMBROUGH
Lt. John J. Dunbar.
Lt. Dunbar is standing in front of the desk.
DUNBAR
Yes sir?
FAMBROUGH
Indian fighter, huh?
DUNBAR
Excuse me?
FAMBROUGH
(indicating paper)
Your orders say you are to be posted
on the frontier. The frontier is
Indian country. I quickly deduced
that you are an Indian fighter.
He arches an eyebrow, challenging the lieutenant. He has sad
swollen eyes. He is an army lifer passed over too many times
for promotion and right now does not look like a well man.
FAMBROUGH
I did not ascend to this position by
being stupid.
DUNBAR
No sir.
Fambrough returns to the order. Dunbar watches him in silence.
The major's tunic is covered with food stains. Sweat has
broken out all over his head. His grooming is awful. His
hands are trembling slightly. Something is very wrong with
him.
Now the major sees something on the official paper. He looks
quickly at the lieutenant, then back at the paper, moving
his lips but making no sound.
FAMBROUGH
It says here you've been decorated.
DUNBAR
Yes sir.
FAMBROUGH
And they sent you out here to be
posted?
DUNBAR
Actually sir, I'm here at my own
request... I want to see the frontier.
FAMBROUGH
You want to see the frontier?
DUNBAR
Yes sir... before it's gone.
The major fixes Dunbar with a sly look.
FAMBROUGH
Such a smart lad coming straight to
me.
Still sly, Fambrough digs into a side drawer. There is the
distinct clink of glass on glass as he rummages. Now Fambrough
has what he wants, a blank official form. He begins to fill
it out, writing in a disturbingly childish way.
FAMBROUGH
Sir Knight, I am sending you on a
knight's errand. You will report to
Captain Cargill at the furthermost
outpost of the realm... Fort
Sedgewick.
He looks over his work with a schoolboy's excitement and
affixes his signature with a wild flourish.
FAMBROUGH
My personal seal will assure you
safe passage through many miles of
wild hostile country.
He folds the order and hands it to Dunbar.
DUNBAR
I'm wondering sir, how will I be
getting there?
FAMBROUGH
You think I don't know?
DUNBAR
No sir, it's just that I don't know.
FAMBROUGH
Hold your tongue.
The major turns in his chair to stare through a single, dusty
window. He can see a teamster outside, tying down canvas on
a heavily-loaded wagon.
FAMBROUGH
I'm in a generous mood and will grant
your boon. You see that peasant...
he calls himself Timmons... he leaves
this very afternoon for your Fort
Sedgewick. Ride with him if you
like... he knows the way. That is
all.
Dunbar stands and salutes. Fambrough returns it snappily.
The lieutenant starts for the door.
FAMBROUGH (O.S.)
Sir Knight...
Dunbar turns around. Fambrough is standing in front of his
desk. There's a large, dark splotch on the major's trouser
front.
He jams both of his hands into the front of his pants and
giggles.
FAMBROUGH
I just pissed in my pants... and
nobody can do anything about it.
The half-caved in supply house bulges with supplies.
Cargill's late quarters are also filled with new goods.
There's barely enough room to reach the little bunk.
A lamp turns up, casting a glow over Dunbar's incredibly
cramped quarters.
He adjusts the lamp and sits back on the bunk, his journal
on his lap. He begins an entry.
DUNBAR (V.O.)
Have arrived to find Fort Sedgewick
deserted. Am now waiting for the
garrison's return or word from
headquarters. Post is in exceedingly
poor condition. Have decided to assign
myself clean-up duty beginning
tomorrow. Supplies abundant. The
country is everything I dreamed it
would be. There can be no place like
this on earth.
Dunbar signs the entry, yawns contentedly and reaches to
turn down the lamp.
A wolf howls somewhere outside. It's low at first but it
keeps on building. At its height, the howl sounds as though
it is coming from, something gigantic.
Dunbar is still listening after it's gone. He hears wood
snap in the direction of the river then all is quiet again.
Without hesitating, he slips the big revolver out of its
holster and cradling it like a teddy bear, slips it under
his blanket.
The light is left blazing.
Dunbar is sleeping quietly. He opens his eyes and rears his
head to get his bearings. Then he flops back down and shuts
his eyes, hoping for more sleep.
He hears two heavy footfalls in rapid succession.
Dunbar holds his breath staring at the doorway. Quietly, he
pulls his gun aiming it directly at the doorway.
Silence. Suddenly, a shadow starts across the threshold,
followed quickly by Cisco's big buckskin head. The horse
watches Dunbar a moment, then looks curiously around the
room.
It's storming outside. Rain is pouring down, its patter broken
from time to time by spectacular flashes of lightning and
the boom of thunder.
But inside it's cozy. The quarters are still crowded but
considerable order has been brought to bear on the place.
He is just finishing up the grouse and a pile of bones sits
on the table. Open at his side is his journal.
DUNBAR (V.O.)
Almost a month and no one has come.
The longer this condition persists,
the less inclined I am to believe
that anyone will. Rain has forced me
indoors for most of two days. I have
begun an awning. The work has ruined
my hands, but I am excited about the
improvement it will bring to this
place.
A great bolt of lightning strikes outside, filling the room
with violent white light. Dunbar walks to the door and tosses
out a handful of bones. Two Socks scurries to collect the
bones and retreats under the shelter of a nearby tree.
DUNBAR (V.O.)
It is the loneliest of times... but
I cannot say that I am unhappy.
The first of three carbine boxes is lugged off the stack.
Dunbar's journal lies open on his bunk. We hear a digging
sound in the background. The lieutenant is facing the wall
of his quarters. Using a bayonet as a cutting tool, he has
carved a window out of the sod. He's nearly finished and is
just tidying up.
DUNBAR (V.O.)
Have made all the preparations I can
think of. I cannot mount an adequate
defense but will try to make a big
impression when they come. Waiting.
Finished, he retreats to his bunk and sits staring across at
his new window. He glances at the journal by his side and
has a thought. He picks it up and starts to write.
DUNBAR (V.O.)
The man I encountered was a
magnificent looking fellow.
Kicking Bird sits next to the fire playing with his son but
he is preoccupied with something.
There is a rustle of movement at the tent flap, and Ten Bears
peers in.
TEN BEARS
May I come in?
The little boy races over to the old chief, Kicking Bird
makes a move to pull him back, but Ten Bears indicates the
boy should stay.
TEN BEARS
No, no let him sit with me.
There is silence as the two men settle themselves by the
fire, the little boy content in Ten Bears' lap.
TEN BEARS
Our country seems good this summer,
but I have not been out to see it.
KICKING BIRD
Yes... it is good. The grass is rich.
The game is plenty and not running
away.
TEN BEARS
I am glad to hear it. But the buffalo
are late. I always worry about the
bellies of our children.
A brief silence.
KICKING BIRD
I was thinking of a dance.
TEN BEARS
Yes, a dance is always a good idea.
It would be good to have a strong
sign.
Kicking Bird seems suddenly uncomfortable. The little boy
leaves.
KICKING BIRD
Yes.
TEN BEARS
There's a funny thing about signs.
They are always flying in our faces.
We know when they are bad or good
but sometimes they are strange and
there is no way to understand them.
Sometimes they make people crazy but
a smart man will take such a sign
into himself and let it run around
for two or three days. If he is still
confused he will tell somebody. He
might come to you or to me and tell
it. A smart man always does that.
Ten Bears picks up the pipe and puffs away, seemingly without
care.
KICKING BIRD
I have seen such a sign.
TEN BEARS
Oh?
KICKING BIRD
I saw a man, a white man.
Ten Bears' eyes get big for a moment. Then he thinks.
TEN BEARS
Just one?
KICKING BIRD
Just one. He was naked.
Ten Bears thinks some more.
TEN BEARS
Are you sure it was a man?
KICKING BIRD
I saw his sex.
TEN BEARS
Did you speak to him?
KICKING BIRD
No.
Ten Bears rubs at his old eyes with both hands.
TEN BEARS
We will council on this.
The eldest and most respected men of the band, including Ten
Bears, his pal STONE CALF, an influential warrior named WIND
IN HIS HAIR, and Kicking Bird are seated around the fire.
Crowded around them, in a high state of excitement, are the
village's leading warriors. The meeting is in progress.
KICKING BIRD
He might be a god or he might be a
special chief -- that's why we are
thinking of having a talk with him.
There is a little murmuring around the fire, and it goes
silent. Wind In His Hair rises to speak.
WIND IN HIS HAIR
I do not care for this talk about a
white man. Whatever kind of white
man he is, he is not Sioux and that
makes him less. We've camped here
for ten days now and each day our
scouts find nothing. One old bull
with wolves tearing him apart, nothing
more. We need meat -- not talk.
KICKING BIRD
You are right, we need meat today
and tomorrow. But we must also have
meat in ten years.
Kicking Bird pauses here. Everyone is listening attentively.
KICKING BIRD
But the whites are coming. Our friends
the Shoshone and the Kiowa, even our
enemies, agree on this -- the whites
are coming. More than can be counted.
WIND IN HIS HAIR
Kicking Bird is always looking ahead
and that is good. But when I hear
that more whites are coming -- more
than can be counted I want to laugh.
We took a hundred horses from these
people, there was no honor in it.
They don't ride well, they don't
shoot well, they're dirty. They have
no women, no children. They could
not even make it through one winter
in our country. And these people are
said to flourish? I think they will
all be dead in ten years.
There is a surge of enthusiasm in the lodge and Wind In His
Hair is riding the crest of it.
WIND IN HIS HAIR
I think this white man is probably
lost.
This parting shot prompts a good-natured round of laughter.
KICKING BIRD
Wind In His Hair has spoken straight,
his words are strong and I have heard
them. It's true the whites are a
poor race and it's hard to understand
them. But when I see one white man
alone, without fear in our country,
I do not think he is lost. I think
he may have medicine. I see someone
who might speak for all the white
people who are coming. I think this
is a person with which treaties might
be struck.
WIND IN HIS HAIR
This white man cannot cover our
lodges, or string our bows, or feed
our children. I will take some good
men... there are many here tonight.
We will ride to the soldier fort, we
will shoot some arrows into this
white man. If he truly has medicine
he will not be hurt. If he has no
medicine he will be dead.
This is the best idea so far and there is much talk around
the fire. They quiet down as Ten Bears prepares to speak.
TEN BEARS
It is easy to become confused by
these questions. It is hard to know
what to do. No man can tell another
how he will be. But I know this...
killing a white man is a delicate
matter. If you kill one, more are
sure to come. We should talk about
this some more.
He drops his head, closes his eyes and starts to fall asleep.
The meeting is over.
Dunbar is snoring. The lantern is turned down low. A horse
whinnies loudly and Dunbar arises.
In the next instant there is a pounding of hooves and the
yelping of Indian boys.
Reeling with sleep, Dunbar is up and moving. He grabs a rifle
and lurches for the door.
As he runs through the door he forgets to duck under the
wooden cross beam. His skull cracks resoundingly against
the. overhang and Dunbar slumps onto his back... out cold.
It's growing light and Dunbar is just coming to. He rolls to
one side and touches the egg that has risen on his forehead.
He hears movement in the yard and looks out.
Cisco is pawing the ground. The Indian line still around his
neck.
Lieutenant Dunbar has gotten a beautiful shine out of his
best boots. He's putting the finishing touches on one of the
toes.
Dunbar places the boot next to its mate and turns to inspect
a dress tunic laid out on the bunk. His open journal is lying
next to it. He picks at little pieces of lint and brushes at
the smudges.
DUNBAR (V.O.)
Since I arrived at this post I have
been walking on eggs. It has become
a bad habit and I am sick of it.
Tomorrow morning I will ride out to
the Indians. I do not know the outcome
or the wisdom of this thinking. But
I have become a target and a target
makes a poor impression. I am through
waiting.
Another council is in progress. As before, the leading men
are seated around Ten Bears' fire while the other warriors
stand packed in the shadows. Wind In His Hair is seated close
to the elders.
TEN BEARS
I am in agreement with Kicking Bird.
We will go down and talk to the white
man and find out what kind of white
man he is.
Wind In His Hair jumps into the conversation.
WIND IN HIS HAIR
If this council decides to talk with
the man at the soldier fort then it
will be so. But in my mind it is not
right that a Sioux chief, a chief as
great as Ten Bears, goes to ask the
business of a puny, trespassing white
man... a white soldier who has only
a smart horse and a few white man
clothes.
There are many yeses in response to this. As is his custom,
Ten Bears lets the outburst subside, seeming unruffled all
the while. Casually, he pops a piece of meat into his mouth
and begins to chew.
TEN BEARS
I will not go... you will go... you
and Kicking Bird. That is all I have
to say.
Dunbar huddles beneath the warmth of his buffalo robe. He is
finishing up the second of two drawings. It is a portrait of
Wind In His Hair, he carefully titles it "The Fierce One."
He has already completed a likeness of Kicking Bird and
underneath it the words "The Quiet One."
Except for Kicking Bird and Stands With A Fist, the tipi is
empty. They are just seating themselves at the firepit in
the center of the lodge. A brief silence, during which Kicking
Bird studies the girl with the bowed head.
KICKING BIRD
Your wounds are healing well?
STANDS WITH A FIST
Yes.
KICKING BIRD
You are happy here, with my family?
STANDS WITH A FIST
I am glad to be here. I am missing
my husband.
KICKING BIRD
Perhaps you will marry again when
the time is right.
STANDS WITH A FIST
Perhaps.
Kicking Bird is leading up to something and Stands With A
Fist fears it. She keeps her head bowed.
KICKING BIRD
We have word from many places that
the whites are...
Kicking Bird stops himself, he knows this must be hard. She
brings her green eyes to bear on the medicine man, waiting
to hear more.
KICKING BIRD
They are coming into everyone's
country. They will soon be in ours I
think. This white man who lives at
the old soldier fort, the one who
calls himself loo ten tant... I have
visited him and I believe his heart
is a good one. He knows things about
the whites which we do not.
He pauses letting this sink in.
STANDS WITH A FIST
I am afraid of the man at the fort.
KICKING BIRD
He is only one man.
STANDS WITH A FIST
I am afraid that he will tell some
whites that I am here. I am afraid
that they will try to take me away.
KICKING BIRD
Every warrior in camp would fight
them if they tried.
She is not much reassured by this. In the way of a defeatist
she lowers her eyes once more.
KICKING BIRD
I cannot make the white man talk.
Loo ten tant does not know Sioux.
Kicking Bird waits. Still she does not raise her head.
KICKING BIRD
You have a certain medicine which no
other Sioux -- man or woman -- has.
STANDS WITH A FIST
It has been a long time since I made
the talk.
KICKING BIRD
I do not ask this for myself... I
ask this for all our people.
STANDS WITH A FIST
It's dead in me.
KICKING BIRD
I want you to try and remember the
the word.
STANDS WITH A FIST
I don't know how.
KICKING BIRD
You don't want to know.
This outburst shocks Stands With A Fist, she runs out of the
lodge.
Lieutenant Dunbar is asleep in the moonlight. The rumbling
is getting louder. It wakes him. He gropes about, lights the
lantern and listens to the strange, powerful sound.
Something's in the air. He holds the lantern toward the
ceiling. Particles of dirt and dust are being shaken from
the roof. It's the earth that's trembling.
The first light streaks through the burrow entrance.
Christine is exerting herself mightily in an effort to move.
But she can't and again she begins to cry.
More sounds from down below in the canyon. Hoofbeats. And a
whinny or two. No way to tell whether this is friend or foe.
But she can't stay in the burrow.
CHRISTINE
Help...
She listens. The hoofbeats are gone.
CHRISTINE
(louder)
Help me...
(screaming)
Please... I need to get out.
Someone is coming up the slope.
A moment later, hands are clawing at the walls of the burrow
and she is looking into three, surprised Sioux faces. The
face in the center is recognizable. A YOUNGER KICKING BIRD.
The fire is still burning in the center of the lodge. Dunbar
is sleeping soundly.
It's not a moment later that we hear the soft sounds of
mumbling somewhere in the lodge. Then it's quiet. There's
that mumbling again. And now a woman's giggle.
Dunbar stirs, waking and curious, sits up a little and looks
across the fire. There is movement on Kicking Bird's platform.
The medicine man's head and that of his wife come into view
for a second or two before they sink back down into shadow.
The movements and sound that follow become more forceful.
They're having sex.
Embarrassed, the lieutenant averts his eyes, they happen
over the forms of Kicking Bird's deeply sleeping children,
the low-burning fire, and settle on Stands With A Fist's
back.
Lieutenant Dunbar, the sounds of lovemaking floating over
him, peers again in that direction only to meet the smiling
eyes of Kicking Bird and his wife.
Embarrassed again, he stares open-eyed at the ceiling. He
looks like a man who knows something is happening but doesn't
know what it is.
Stands With A Fist's eyes are open too. She doesn't move.
The person we see from the waist up bears little resemblance
to the Lieutenant Dunbar we've known.
His long hair hides his face on his slightly bent head. His
skin is not so white anymore, and the great bone-pipe
breastplate covers his torso.
Dunbar starts to write and stops, he repeats this action. It
is clear that as Lieutenant Dunbar, he can find nothing to
say. He lays the pen down momentarily.
DUNBAR (V.O.)
Made a long patrol today. There is
nothing to report. The truth is I am
bored.
There is the scurry of movement and the scratch of tiny paws.
His eyes roam to the place in the corner where sacks of flour
and hard biscuits and other provisions are stored. Watching
the sacks more closely, he sees that they are infested with
mice.
Restlessly, he walks to the doorway, gazing out onto the old
fort. The awning is beginning to tear at the corner. And
then he spots something.
Kicking Bird's pipe is a beautiful piece of work. It's being
smoked.
Kicking Bird puffs away a few times and hands the pipe to
Dunbar. The lieutenant, aware that the pipe is something
special, handles it with care.
He looks to Kicking Bird for guidance as he puts his mouth
to the tip. The medicine man reassures him with a wave of
the hand and Dunbar begins to puff.
Dunbar coughs lightly at the harsh tobacco but he smokes
well, watching the bowl pulse with life at each puff.
He stops now and lowers the pipe. He stares down. The pipe
seems almost alive as it lays in his hands.
Dunbar hands the pipe back, and as Kicking Bird takes it he
hears the light tinkling of bells.
Dunbar hears it too. As he looks toward the sound, a shadow
falls across the arbor's entrance.
KICKING BIRD
We were waiting for you.
Stands With A Fist ducks through the arbor's entrance and
seats herself between Dunbar and Kicking Bird.
Stands With A Fist is wearing a band of bells around one
ankle. She has a pair of simple but pretty moccasins on her
feet. Her dress is old but well-cared for. Animal teeth are
sewn along her bodice. On her wrist is a solid brass bracelet.
Her hair is tied back loosely with a bret, accenting the
feminine in her face.
Her whiteness seems to show more than ever. But it is not
dominant. The Sioux is dominant.
KICKING BIRD
(to Dunbar)
Welcome. It is good that you are
here.
Kicking Bird looks to Stands With A Fist. She takes her time
and the words are accented but they are close enough.
STANDS WITH A FIST
Hullo. You here... good.
The words are sweet music to the lieutenant. He replies with
a feeling of great relief.
DUNBAR
Thank you... I feel good.
STANDS WITH A FIST
(to Kicking Bird)
He thanks you. It is good.
KICKING BIRD
Ask him why he is at the soldier
fort.
STANDS WITH A FIST
(to Dunbar)
Uhh... you... come...
Dunbar jumps in. There are things he wants to know, has waited
a long time to know.
DUNBAR
Wait... what is your name?
STANDS WITH A FIST
Our... names?
KICKING BIRD
What does he say?
STANDS WITH A FIST
He wants to know how we are called.
KICKING BIRD
Ahhh... He's right. I'm sorry.
The medicine man nods agreeably. He smiles at Dunbar, quite
right, introductions should come first.
STANDS WITH A FIST
He... he... Kick...
DUNBAR
Kick?
STANDS WITH A FIST
More.
She kicks at the ground with the toe of her moccasin. Dunbar
doesn't get it. She kicks a little harder.
DUNBAR
Kicking?
STANDS WITH A FIST
Kicking... yes... Kicking... Bird.
DUNBAR
(to Kicking Bird)
Kicking Bird...
(to Stands With A
Fist)
What does he... is he a chief?
Stands With A Fist has the word but it takes a few seconds
to make it come out of her mouth.
STANDS WITH A FIST
Hul... hal... ho-lee... holy... holy
man.
DUNBAR
Oh...
(glancing at Kicking
Bird)
A brief silence. Kicking Bird seems ready to speak but Dunbar
is too quick.
DUNBAR
(to Stands With A
Fist)
Your name... you.
She thinks. It's hard. She smiles thinly.
STANDS WITH A FIST
I don't know.
An idea comes to her. She stands up quickly.
DUNBAR
Up? Get up?
STANDS WITH A FIST
No.
She repeats the movement again.
DUNBAR
Stand.
Her smile is a little wider this time.
STANDS WITH A FIST
Yes... Stands.
Dunbar starts to speak but she cuts him off.
STANDS WITH A FIST
More...
(thinking)
Wiff...
(quickly)
With.
She draw something in the dirt. It's an "A".
DUNBAR
Stands With A...
Now she makes a fist and holds it close to Dunbar's face.
DUNBAR
Fist?
She nods.
DUNBAR
Stands With A Fist. I'm John... John
Dunbar.
STANDS WITH A FIST
John Dunbar.
DUNBAR
Yes.
His surroundings are completely Indian, Dunbar is cleaning
the big navy revolver.
DUNBAR (V.O.)
A war party is going against the
Pawnee soon and I have asked to go.
I sensed that I have made a mistake
in doing so but I could not bring
myself to take it back. They are my
friends and from what little I gather
the Pawnee have been very hard on
these people. I hope I have not
overstepped my bounds.
The lodge flap rustles and in comes Stands With A Fist and
Kicking Bird. Dunbar stands to greet them.
DUNBAR
I'm glad to see you... please sit.
Kicking Bird speaks and Stands With A Fist translates.
STANDS WITH A FIST
(translating)
Kicking Bird wants to know why you
want to make war on the Pawnee. They
have done nothing to you.
DUNBAR
They are Sioux enemies.
STANDS WITH A FIST
(translating)
Only Sioux warriors will go.
DUNBAR
I asked that he would think about my
going.
STANDS WITH A FIST
He has.
DUNBAR
Then tell him this. I have been a
warrior for longer than many of the
young men that will go on this war
party. Tell him.
STANDS WITH A FIST
(translating)
He says that the Sioux way of being
a warrior is not the white way. You
are not ready.
DUNBAR
I know, I understand. But I cannot
learn these ways in camp.
She translates this to Kicking Bird. The medicine man
hesitates then speaks once more.
STANDS WITH A FIST
He asks that you watch over his family
while he is gone.
Dunbar looks to Kicking Bird then to Stands With A Fist unable
to mask his disappointment.
STANDS WITH A FIST
(on her own)
This thing he asks you... it is a
great honor for you.
Dunbar thinks a moment longer and speaks directly to Kicking
Bird.
DUNBAR
I will be happy to watch over your
family.
STANDS WITH A FIST
(translating)
He thanks Dances With Wolves for
coming.
DUNBAR
Who is Dances With Wolves?
STANDS WITH A FIST
It is the name which everyone is
calling you now.
He thinks and remembers the night with Two Socks.
DUNBAR
Dances With Wolves... that's right.
(to Stands With A
Fist)
How do you say it?
STANDS WITH A FIST
(in Sioux)
Dances With Wolves.
DUNBAR
(in Sioux to Kicking
Bird)
Dances With Wolves.
The medicine man smiles.
Dances With Wolves sits alone in the arbor. He's fidgety.
Now he hears a light tinkling of bells, the sounds he's been
waiting to hear.
Her feet appear in the doorway.
STANDS WITH A FIST (O.S.)
Dances With Wolves?
DANCES WITH WOLVES
I'm here.
Black Shawl is settling the youngest children in for bed,
Stands With A Fist is playing with the oldest of the children.
They're setting up a child's tipi.
BLACK SHAWL
How is Dances With Wolves?
Stands With A Fist stares straight ahead as if she were
wondering the same thing. Which she was.
STANDS WITH A FIST
What do you mean?
BLACK SHAWL
How is he learning?
STANDS WITH A FIST
He learns well... he is fast.
Case closed, she goes back to playing and Black Shawl
continues putting the kids to bed.
She looks again at Stands With A Fist wondering "what did
you think I meant?"
Stands With A Fist is sitting in the middle of the lodge,
she starts when Black Shawl walks in.
BLACK SHAWL
You are not talking today?
STANDS WITH A FIST
No, I'm not.
Black Shawl gives her a deeper look, then lets it go.
The sun is setting and the village is settling in for the
evening.
Lying on his bed, Dances With Wolves looks sleepy as he stares-
across at the small fire. Even, in his drowsiness, it is
easy to see he's concentrating... in this case on a certain
someone.
Again, Dances With Wolves is waiting. This time, not so
patiently. He gives up and leaves in search of something.
Stands With A Fist kneels before Black Shawl, the older woman
is combing out the tangles in her hair. Black Shawl senses a
tension in the girl and gently tries to pry it out of her.
BLACK SHAWL
People are talking about you...
Stands With A Fist stiffens a bit.
STANDS WITH A FIST
What are they saying?
BLACK SHAWL
They are proud of the medicine you
are making with Dances With Wolves.
Stands With A Fist is quiet.
STANDS WITH A FIST
I have hurt him and I must go talk
to him.
BLACK SHAWL
You can't, he is gone.
Stands With A Fist bolts up, racing to the lodge flap -- she
pulls it aside and is stunned by the sight of Dances With
Wolves' abandoned lodge -- Cisco is nowhere to be seen.
She turns away, tears coming to her eyes. Black Shawl is
beside her watching -- the girl's emotions have betrayed
her.
Black Shawl takes the crying girl into her arms. A child
runs into the lodge but Black Shawl indicates "not now."
The message is clearly understood, and the child digs in his
heels and heads the other way.
Part of the old bed has collapsed but some of it is still
strong enough for support and here Dances With Wolves is
sitting as he leafs through his beloved journal.
He reads a little entry here and there, sometimes smiling at
the memory.
A few blank pages remain at the back of the book. Reaching
these he closes the journal and holds it on his lap, letting
his mind run for a moment.
Now he notices the old pen and ink. He picks them up and
opens the journal for one last entry.
He writes: "I love Stands With A Fist" and signs himself
"Dances With Wolves."
Something is moving outside and Dunbar stops, drawing his
gun out. He drops the book on the bed and carefully moves
outside.
Dances with Wolves sits at his cozy fire, working on a pipe.
He follows a low rumble of thunder as it rolls overhead.
Thunder booms again and suddenly Stands With A Fist comes
through the lodge flap.
Dances With Wolves comes to his feet. They stare across at
each other. Dances With Wolves walks slowly to her and they
embrace lightly. Stands With A Fist starts to slip out of
her dress.
Dances With Wolves and Stands With A Fist are having sex.
The sounds of their love-making are suddenly joined by more
insistent sounds from outside. Urgent yelling.
The lovers freeze. Stands With A Fist props herself on an
elbow, listening.
STANDS WITH A FIST
Trouble...
Dances With Wolves steps into the lodge, followed by Smiles
A Lot. They both have rifles and Dances With Wolves' old
long-barreled revolver is holstered at his waist.
Before him is a quiet, tense scene.
The women are huddled together on a single sleeping platform.
Kicking Bird's three children nestled between them. Two of
the kids are crying softly.
Black Shawl grips a hatchet and Stands With A Fist has a
rifle. They will both fight. But they are both scared.
Everyone in the village has a life at stake. In one glimpse,
Dances With Wolves understands what he will be fighting for.
He looks once more at the women and children and ducks out
of the lodge.
Now there's a ripping at the lodge entrance. The flap is
being torn away. Black Shawl is desperately pulling the child
back from the edge of the lodge.
Suddenly, there he is... a Pawnee warrior. But now it's his
turn to be surprised. He sees Stands with A Fist taking aim,
and it's too late. She fires the rifle and the Pawnee explodes
back out of the lodge.
Pretty Shield stands in front of a group of children, ready
to defend them.
The Pawnee is inside now. He has a wild desperate look and
in a moment his hatchet will be flailing its way through
these people.
But he never takes a step. Instead he suddenly sinks to his
knees and we see another arrow join the one that is already
buried in his back. The warrior keels over and Pretty Shield
looks through the open flap to see the grinning face of Stone
Calf.
Without hesitation, Pretty Shield snatches a half-burned log
from the fire and finishes the Pawnee.
The children watch, their faces a mixture of horror and
intrigue.
Black Shawl and Stands With A Fist are clearing things away.
The medicine man has hosted a dinner party which is now
winding down.
Wind In His Hair is there, Dances With Wolves and several
other prominent warriors. It's purely social and all the men
are enjoying themselves.
Dances With Wolves sneaks a look of affection at Stands With
A Fist, and she returns it.
Then, with more theatricality than is really necessary, he
stretches his arms and yawns. Wind In His Hair looks at his
friend with surprise.
Dances With Wolves gets to his feet.
WIND IN HIS HAIR
There is gambling tonight... at Horse
Back's lodge. Horse Back's games are
always good.
DANCES WITH WOLVES
I am tired... and Horse Back already
has a good rifle of mine.
(to Kicking Bird)
thank you...
(to all)
goodnight.
He slips out. In a few seconds, the men have pick up another
topic to jawbone.
They pay no attention to Stands With A Fist's momentary exit,
But Black Shawl does, it doesn't bother her, but she notices.
The medicine man's wife is already in bed as he slips under
the covers with a grunt.
BLACK SHAWL
How long will Stands With A Fist
mourn?
Kicking Bird gives his wife an odd look.
KICKING BIRD
I don't know.
BLACK SHAWL
I hope it will not be too long.
Kicking Bird rises on his elbows.
KICKING BIRD
Something has happened? Well what?
BLACK SHAWL
She has found love again.
KICKING BIRD
With who?
BLACK SHAWL
Dances With Wolves.
KICKING BIRD
Are you certain of this?
BLACK SHAWL
When you see them together you will
know.
Kicking Bird stares wearily across the floor.
KICKING BIRD
What are people saying? They're not
angry?
BLACK SHAWL
No. They like the match. It makes
sense. They are both white.
KICKING BIRD
I suppose I will be the one to say
something.
A brief silence.
BLACK SHAWL
She's your daughter now.
Kicking Bird glances up frustrated with himself.
BLACK SHAWL
You can't see everything coming.
Dances With Wolves sits waiting as a voice comes to him from
the outside.
Wind In His Hair's face pokes through the entrance. He steps
inside, followed by Smiles A Lot.
WIND IN HIS HAIR
There's talk that you want to get
married.
DANCES WITH WOLVES
To who?
Wind In His Hair and Smiles A Lot share a smile.
SMILES A LOT
To Stands With A Fist.
WIND IN HIS HAIR
That's the one isn't it?
DANCES WITH WOLVES
She's in mourning.
SMILES A LOT
Not today.
WIND IN HIS HAIR
She has been released. Kicking Bird
did it.
DANCES WITH WOLVES
He did?
Wind In His Hair isn't really listening. He glances around
the lodge curiously.
WIND IN HIS HAIR
What are you doing?
DANCES WITH WOLVES
Kicking Bird told me to wait.
WIND IN HIS HAIR
You might be waiting a long time.
Smiles A Lot says he saw Kicking
Bird riding on the prairie...
Smiles A Lot whispers in the warrior's ear.
WIND IN HIS HAIR
He says he was talking to himself.
When a medicine man is the last to
know he can take it pretty hard.
DANCES WITH WOLVES
What do I do?
Wind In His Hair looks around at the sparse furnishing.
WIND IN HIS HAIR
You are pretty poor my friend and a
Sioux girl is not for free. I don't
know if you can get married.
A long silence. Dances With Wolves looks around his lodge.
Wind In His Hair is right. He really has nothing.
DANCES WITH WOLVES
I have the buckskin...
WIND IN HIS HAIR
That's too much medicine.
DANCES WITH WOLVES
(to Smiles A Lot)
Do you think the buckskin is too
much medicine?
Smiles A Lot is on the hot seat. He looks to Wind In His
Hair, but no luck -- he's on his own.
SMILES A LOT
For a girl.
WIND IN HIS HAIR
Maybe we can help you... wait here
for us.
Wind In His Hair and Smiles A Lot leave.
Dances With Wolves tosses and turns in his bed. He slips out
of the covers and ducks his head through the lodge flap,
checking again on the ponies.
Dances With Wolves' hair is shiny. His breastplate gleams,
the officer's pants have been dusted and his old boots have
something resembling a shine. The groom is ready.
WIND IN HIS HAIR
Turn around...
Dances With Wolves does a three-sixty.
WIND IN HIS HAIR
Pretty good...
A brief silence as Wind In His Hair contemplates something
he wants to say.
WIND IN HIS HAIR
You know, the man she mourned for
was my best friend.
DANCES WITH WOLVES
I didn't know that.
WIND IN HIS HAIR
He was a good man. It's been hard
for me. I am not the thinker Kicking
Bird is. But I think he went away
from her because you were coming.
That is how I see it now.
The sound of music and people outside distracts both men.
The old man puffs away at his trusty pipe. Now he lays it
down. Kicking Bird and Dances With Wolves are waiting
patiently.
TEN BEARS
It's hard to know what to do.
The old man gets up, walks to his bedside, reaches up into
the sacred rigging above an takes down a melon-sized rawhide
bundle. He brings this back to the fire and unwraps it slowly.
Inside is a rusted hunk of metal, the helmet of a Spanish
conquistador.
TEN BEARS
The men who wore this came in the
time of my grandfather's grandfather.
Eventually, we drove them out. Then
the Mexicans came. In my own time
the whites came... the Texans. They
have been like all the others who
find something they want in our
country. They take it without asking.
I have always been a peaceful man,
happy to be in my own country and
wanting nothing from the white people.
Nothing at all. But I think you are
right. I think they will keep coming.
When I think of that, I look at this
bundle. Our country is all that we
want. We will fight to keep it.
He picks up his pipe and puffs deeply.
TEN BEARS
Tomorrow morning we will strike the
village and go to the winter camp.
Stands With A Fist is packing and so is Dances With Wolves.
He is putting away the shield that Stone Calf once worked
on. She pauses to stroke her husband's leg tenderly.
STANDS WITH A FIST
You have everything from the soldier
fort?
DANCES WITH WOLVES
No, there is nothing for me there.
Stands with A Fist laughs as she starts out of the lodge.
STANDS WITH A FIST
That's good.
But as he tightens the leather thongs on the shield case,
Dances With Wolves' face begins to cloud.
Dances With Wolves lies unconscious on the floor of the ruined
supply house. One side of his face is grotesquely swollen
from the blow he took. Blood still seeps from a long split
of the skin along his cheek.
He groans. Voice are playing about his ears, the voices of
white men. He opens his eyes.
A bearish, bearded SERGEANT BAUER, is squatting directly in
front of him. Behind the sergeant, peering over the crumbled
walls like visitors at a zoo, are a crowd of ordinary
soldiers.
BAUER
Spivey...
A pitiful looking man, SPIVEY, who is a soldier by name only,
answers up.
SPIVEY
Yessir sergeant...
SERGEANT BAUER
Tell the major he's wakin' up... and
move your worthless ass.
The sergeant's smallish eyes are fixed on Dances With Wolves.
With some effort he manages to get himself into a sitting
position against the back wall.
SERGEANT BAUER
Got yourself a helluva shiner, didn't
ya?
Dances With Wolves only blinks at him. His cheek is crushed
and so is his spirit.
Someone calls attention and two officers walk into the
roofless supply house. One is a MAJOR, one is a young
lieutenant -- Lieutenant Elgin -- the officer Dances With
Wolves bumped into at Fort Hays. Neither one recognizes the
other.
MAJOR
Does he speak english?
SERGEANT BAUER
Don't know sir... you speak english?
Talk english?
(kicking at one of
Dances With Wolves'
boots)
Talk?
DANCES WITH WOLVES
I speak english...
Everyone is shocked at the clarity of the words.
MAJOR
Who are you?
DANCES WITH WOLVES
Lieutenant John. J. Dunbar. This is
my post.
MAJOR
Why are you dressed like this?
DANCES WITH WOLVES
I came out from Fort Hays last April.
But there was no one here.
The major and the lieutenant exchange whispers.
ELGIN
You have proof of that?
DANCES WITH WOLVES
My journal is on the bunk in my
quarters. My orders are in the
journal. It will tell you everything.
ELGIN
Spivey, you and Edwards were here
first. Did you find anything... a
journal.
Spivey shifts uncomfortably.
SPIVEY
We didn't see nothin' sir.
ELGIN
Where's Edwards?
SPIVEY
He's outside. But he didn't see
nothin' either.
Elgin indicates to the major that he will get to the bottom
of this and walks out the door -- the major follows.
Dances With Wolves lets his head slump forward. The men
gathered around the supply house murmur among themselves,
commenting on the prisoner. They can't take their eyes off
him. Neither can Sergeant Bauer. He watches the prisoner
from a distance. Then he walks across the floor, squats in
front of him and whispers coarsely in his face.
SERGEANT BAUER
You turned Injun, din'cha?
Dances With Wolves lifts his head and stares at the sergeant.
SERGEANT BAUER
Din'cha?
The major and the lieutenant suddenly reappear.
ELGIN
What is your name?
DANCES WITH WOLVES
Dunbar... D.U.N.B.A.R... John.
ELGIN
You say you are an officer?
DANCES WITH WOLVES
Did you read my orders?
ELGIN
No.
DANCES WITH WOLVES
It was in my journal.
ELGIN
There are no orders and there is no
journal.
There is a silence as Dances With Wolves takes this in.
Elgin tries again.
ELGIN
Why are you out of uniform?
Dances With Wolves takes a long time to answer.
DANCES WITH WOLVES
I have to relieve myself.
Water drips from Dances With Wolves' head and he comes to
again. As he moves he hears a jangling and discovers that
his hands and feet are in chains. Everyone has assembled.
ELGIN
Why are you out of uniform?
DANCES WITH WOLVES
What is the army doing out here?
Sergeant Bauer shoves Dances With Wolves with his gun.
BAUER
Lieutenant's askin' the questions
here.
Elgin quickly steps in.
ELGIN
We are charged with apprehending
hostiles, recovering stolen property
and retrieving white captives taken
in hostile raidings.
DANCES WITH WOLVES
There are no hostiles.
MAJOR
We will ascertain that for ourselves.
Now if you guide us to these camps
and serve as an interpreter, your
conduct will be reevaluated.
DANCES WITH WOLVES
What conduct?
MAJOR
Your status as a traitor might improve
should you choose to cooperate with
the United States Army.
DANCES WITH WOLVES
(quietly)
There is nothing for you to do out
here.
Elgin can see that the major's attitude and inexperience has
killed any chance of communication. He makes one last try on
his own.
ELGIN
Are you willing to cooperate or not?
MAJOR
Well, speak up...
DANCES WITH WOLVES
(lowly in Sioux)
I am Dances With Wolves...
MAJOR
What's that?
DANCES WITH WOLVES
(loudly in Sioux)
I am Dances With Wolves... I have
nothing to say to you. You are not
worth talking to.
The major is surprised. Elgin is not. The major turns on his
heel and walks out. Lieutenant Elgin stares at Dances With
Wolves.
ELGIN
Sergeant... have a detail take him
down to the river... let him clean
up his face.
Dances With Wolves is half-dozing against the wall when Spivey
walks in with a plate of army gruel. He's followed by Sergeant
Bauer. Spivey sets the plate in front of the prisoner. He
admires the breastplate and like a crow eyeing something
shiny, he thinks to grab for it.
Suddenly a pair of manacled hands lock on his wrists. Dances
With Wolves face is inches away from Spiveys. Terrified,
Spivey pulls away, kicking over the plate of food as he
scrambles to safety across the room.
SERGEANT BAUER
Lap it up Injun.
Dances With Wolves sticks a toe under the lip of the plate
and flips it over. Most of it hits Spivey, a little splashes
on Bauer. Spivey moves to kick the prisoner, but Bauer
intercedes with his rifle.
SERGEANT BAUER
Go on ahead Injun... You'll just get
hungrier is all... but mebbe that
don't matter. Word is they're gonna
ship you back to Hays. And they'll
hang you once you get there.
Bauer and Spivey leave him and Dances With Wolves kicks out
viciously at the spilled plate.
The couple we have come to know are sitting on their bed.
Dances With Wolves is combing Stands With A Fist's hair.
It's something he is doing with care and affection. She is
loving it as much as he. They are together as two people can
be and yet it is a hard time.
DANCES WITH WOLVES
You have nothing to say?
STANDS WITH A FIST
What can I tell you?
DANCES WITH WOLVES
What ever is on your mind.
STANDS WITH A FIST
We have decided. You are my husband.
I am your wife. That is all I know.
Dances With Wolves lays his forehead on her back. He sighs.
Then he pulls away, slips a robe around his shoulders and
walks out of the lodge.
Sadly, she watches him go.
Several men are gathered around Ten Bears' fire, including
Kicking Bird, Wind In His Hair and Dances With Wolves.
All the men are draped with blankets. The wind is howling
outside. The men are engaged in small talk as the pipe goes
around the circle.
The pipe comes around to Dances With Wolves, and the man
next to him must nudge him to attention. Dances With Wolves
takes the pipe and begins to smoke.
Ten Bears watches him closely.
TEN BEARS
(to Dances With Wolves)
Dances With Wolves is quiet these
days.
He does not reply. He smokes a little more and passes the
pipe.
TEN BEARS
Is his heart bad?
Dances With Wolves glances at the men around the fire.
DANCES WITH WOLVES
Killing the soldiers at the river
was a good thing. It made me free
and my heart was big to see my friends
coming to help me. I did not mind
killing those men. I was glad to do
it.
He searches for the right words.
DANCES WITH WOLVES
But the soldiers hate me now like
they hate no other. I am more than
an enemy to them, I am a traitor.
They will hunt for me. They will not
give up. And when they find me they
find you and that cannot happen.
Objections break out all around the fire. Wind In His Hair
jumps to his feet and even Kicking Bird is protesting.
TEN BEARS
Quiet!... sit down Wind In His Hair.
You are hurting an old man's ears
with your loud talk.
Stands With A Fist is building up the fire in their cozy
home. Dances With Wolves works on a long-stemmed pipe which
is in the last stages of completion.
TEN BEARS (O.S.)
Dances With Wolves?
Dances With Wolves gets up, opens the flap and admits the
old chief. A few snowflakes cling to his wispy hair.
He goes straight to the fire and sits.
TEN BEARS
Ahh... this is a nice fire... at my
age a good fire is better than
anything.
Stands With A Fist brings two small bowls of food, places
them next to the men and busies herself with something else.
Though neither one is much interested they begin to eat.
TEN BEARS
I wondered how your bad heart was
doing and though I would come by and
see for myself. This place doesn't
look so bad-hearted.
Dances With Wolves smiles.
DANCES WITH WOLVES
No, we are happy.
TEN BEARS
But you are leaving anyway?
DANCES WITH WOLVES
I have talked with Stands With a
Fist and we will go together.
TEN BEARS
Have you told this to Kicking Bird
or to Wind In His Hair.
It's anguish for Dances with Wolves to think about his
friends. He shakes his head "no". Ten Bears thinks again in
silence.
TEN BEARS
You are the only white man I have
ever known. I have thought about you
alot. More than you know.
DANCES WITH WOLVES
That does not surprise me.
TEN BEARS
You have always spoken with your
heart. And like all of us, you are a
free man and can do anything you
like. When I look across this fire,
I do not see a white soldier. I see
only a Sioux named Dances With Wolves.
And there is nothing they hate so
much as a Sioux.
Ten Bears words always have purpose and as always, he makes
his point.
He pauses for a moment and notices Dances with Wolves' nearly
finished pipe.
TEN BEARS
You are making a pipe?
DANCES WITH WOLVES
Yes?
Ten Bears holds out a hand and Dances with Wolves hands the
pipe to him. Ten Bears inspects it briefly.
TEN BEARS
This might be a pretty good pipe...
how does it smoke?
DANCES WITH WOLVES
I don't know, I haven't tried it
yet.
TEN BEARS
Let's smoke it awhile... it is good
to pass the time this way.
From a little distance, Wind In His Hair is watching Dances
With Wolves' lodge. His face is full of uncertainty and a
kind of pain we have never seen before. He is in agony.
He starts forward but after a few yards he stops to think.
He turns back but has only gone a few steps when he stops
and turns to face Dances With Wolves' lodge once more. He
starts for the tipi again, but he can't go thru with it. The
proud warrior turns away and walks quickly out of sight.
Black Shawl watches as Kicking Bird slips a magnificent pipe
into its buckskin case. Now he looks at her. The medicine
man too is in a kind of pain we have not seen before.
Carrying the pipe he made, Dances With Wolves walks through
the village. Suddenly he stops. Kicking Bird is standing in
the middle of the empty avenue.
Like gunfighters, the two men approach each other at a slow
and deliberate walk.
Gradually they realize that each has selected the same parting
gift. It's heartbreaking. Kicking Bird tries to cover with a
casual question, but it's all fake.
KICKING BIRD
You've finished your pipe? How does
it smoke?
DANCES WITH WOLVES
I'm told it smokes well.
Dances With Wolves moves to make the exchange. Kicking Bird
does the same. From one hand to the other. Men couldn't be
closer.
KICKING BIRD
It doesn't seem possible that we
could come this far.
DANCES WITH WOLVES
You were the first man I ever wanted
to be like. I will not forget you.
Neither can speak. There is only goodbye.
Stands With A Fist sits on a pony outside the lodge. Two
pack horses are loaded with their things.
Dances With Wolves swings onto his pony's back and we follow
as they start out of the village. No one is standing in rose
to watch them leave. No one is crying. In fact, people are
making the motions of going about their regular work.
But it's all fake too. The whole village is sad and the most
obvious sign is that there is no sound. In the awful quiet,
most people avert their eyes as the two pass by.
Everyone in the camp has stopped to listen.
WIND IN HIS HAIR (O.S.)
Can you not see that I am your friend?
