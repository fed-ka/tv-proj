      INT. COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE - COURTROOM - MORNING11

      A large empty courtroom.  Just one person sitting in it.  
      ALICIA.  A men s garment bag beside her.

                                  BAILIFF
                    Mrs. Florrick.

      A kindly BAILIFF.  Alicia nods, follows him through...

      INT. COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE - HOLDING CELLS - MORNING22

      ...a side door toward the holding cells, a few sleeping and 
      pacing convicts.  But the Bailiff points her toward a door...

                                  BAILIFF
                    I put them in the jury holding 
                    room.

      Alicia nods-- thank you-- and slips into...

      INT. COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE - JURY HOLDING - MORNING33

      ...the darkened holding room. A circle of light in the middle 
    of it.  Network lighting, two camera set up.   Early Show  
      anchor RUSS MITCHELL, nodding.

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    It s humbling.  I ve sent people to 
                    prison-- a lot of people, actually-- 
                    and I d do it again.  But I wish 
                    every prosecutor had my experience: 
                    walking in a convict s shoes.

      PETER.  In prison blues.  Mid-interview.  Genuine emotion, 
      humility; he s good at this.  Alicia peers past the handful 
    of techs, lawyers, watching.  

                                  RUSS MITCHELL
                    Well, you must ve seen the articles 
                    and heard the rumblings.  With 
                    crime rates up, and disappointment 
                    in your successor rising, voters 
                    seem to want you back.

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    Russ.  My dad always told me: if 
                    you re ever granted a second act in 
                    life, don t repeat the first one.  
                                  (MORE)




                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #107   "Unprepared"   BUFF COLLATED   10/27/09      2.

                                  PETER FLORRICK (CONT'D)
                    So as honored as I am by all the 
                    talk, I think that s all it is: 
                    talk.  

      Peter sees Alicia, shoots her a smile.  She smiles back.  Not 
      sure what to think of this.  The media back in her life.

                                  RUSS MITCHELL
                    So what s next then for Peter 
                    Florrick?

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    Well, first of all, I have to go 
                    into that courtroom over the next 
                    few weeks and win this appeal.  I 
                    have a family who I miss with every 
                    fiber of my being; a wife who has 
                    been... amazing, and two kids who-- 
                    I m humbled by their strength 
                    through this. 

      Alicia notices a woman standing in the dark too, taking 
      pictures with her iPhone.  KYA POOLE (35).  A blissfully 
      confident and smooth Reputation Management pro.  Not 
      obviously sexy.  But English major erotic and available.  
      Something about her.  Alicia s antenna up. 

      DANIEL GOLDEN, also in the room, notices Alicia, quietly 
      slips around the outskirts of the interview toward her.  

                                  RUSS MITCHELL
                    I promised I would address the 
                    elephant in the room, and so I have 
                    to now.  What drove you to seek out 
                    prostitutes, and to put so much of 
                    your life and career in danger?

      Peter considers it.  He s a politician at heart, but he s 
      good at this, deeply considering it.  Alicia listens.

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    I m flawed.  I m human.  And I ve 
                    paid the price.  That s not a 
                    complaint; that s just the truth.  
                    I ve looked at myself in the mirror, 
                    and I didn t like what I saw, and I 
                    just want to change.   

    And this last sentence he directs right at Alicia.  She meets 
    his eye, as Golden comes up beside her, whispers:

                                  GOLDEN
                    Thanks.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #107   "Unprepared"   BUFF COLLATED   10/27/09      3.
      CONTINUED: (2)33


    She nods, gives him the garment bag, as Peter finishes:

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    I think it s time to turn the page 
                    now.  And look toward the future.  

      INT. HOLDING ROOM - TEN MINUTES LATER - DAY44

      Peter hugs Alicia.  The lights up now.  Interview over.

                                  PETER
                    Thanks, love.  God, you smell good.

                                  ALICIA
                    How d it go?

                                  PETER
                    Good, I think.  It s kind of weird.  
                    Oh, this is Kya Poole.  LLC 
                    Consultants.  A Reputation Manager.  

                                  KYA
                    Hello, Mrs. Florrick.  I have a lot 
                    of respect for you.   

                                  ALICIA
                    ...Thank you.

      Peter sees the garment bag, takes it from Golden...

                                  PETER
                    Oh, good.  I hope it still fits.  
                    Prison Mac and Cheese takes it s 
                    toll.  Dominic, can I use the 
                    bathroom here?

    The Bailiff nods, opens the door, and Peter slips in as Alicia 
      studies Kya.  Flipping through her iPhone photos.  Kya knows 
      she s being watched, turns an image to her.

                                  KYA
                    That s the look the public misses. 
                    Confident, real, optimistic.  You 
                    know what he was talking about at 
                    that moment?  You.

    Kya smiles.  Alicia smiles back.

                                  ALICIA
                    I have to go.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #107   "Unprepared"   BUFF COLLATED   10/27/09      4.
      CONTINUED:44


                                  KYA
                    Stern, Lockhart, and Gardner?

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes.

                                  KYA
                    Say hello to Will.  

      Alicia looks at her, nods.  Peter shouts from the other room:

                                  PETER
                    You ll drop by later?

                                  ALICIA
                    After work.

    And Golden nods respectfully to Alicia as she starts out.

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - LARGE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY55

                                  ELLEN
                    Sorry, what was the question again?

      PROFESSOR ELLEN WHITTON, 30s.  Intelligent, socially awkward, 
    and nervous.  A brilliant woman who s always afraid she has 
    to prove herself.  The opposite of the confident Peter.  

                                  TAMARA (O.S.)
                    You work at Chicago Poly Tech, 
                    isn t that correct, Professor 
                    Whitton?

                                  ELLEN
                    Yes.  I um... I received a grant to 
                    research cellular reproduction in 
                      pluripotent stem cells.

    The examination is playing on a monitor in the large 
      conference room.  A dozen lawyers crowded around it, 
      watching, standing, seated... all working.

                                  TAMARA (O.S. ON THE MONITOR)
                    More commonly known as cloning?

                                  ELLEN (O.S. ON THE MONITOR)
                    Yes, I m sorry, yes.  Cloning.

      Watching, WILL leans toward DIANE:

                                  WILL
                    Why s she apologizing so much?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #107   "Unprepared"   BUFF COLLATED   10/27/09      5.
      CONTINUED:55


                                  DIANE
                    That s who she is.

                                  TAMARA (O.S. THE MONITOR)
                    Now the prosecution contends that 
                    you buckled under the pressure of 
                    your research.  You were supposed 
                    to deliver your results, and you 
                    missed several deadlines.  

                                  ELLEN (ON THE MONITOR)
                    Yes-- no.  I mean, missing 
                    deadlines is just-- everybody 
                    misses deadlines.

                                  WILL
                    Watching her makes me nervous.  

      Diane nods, not disagreeing, as Alicia slips in the back of 
    the room, late.  Cary looks over, nods at her.

                                  TAMARA (O.S. THE MONITOR)
                    Did you set the fire that destroyed 
                    your lab, Professor Whitton?

                                  ELLEN (ON THE MONITOR)
                    No.  Never.  I -- Look, I was on 
                    the verge of a... of a career-
                    defining fellowship at Cambridge.  
                    I would never do anything to hurt 
                    my research.

                                  TAMARA (O.S. THE MONITOR)
                    Where were you at the time of the 
                    fire?

                                  ELLEN (ON THE MONITOR)
                    I was -- I wasn t at the lab -- I 
                    mean, I was earlier-- but I was 
                    running, uh, at the track -- across 
                    campus...

                                  WILL
                    This is like watching baby seals 
                    being clubbed.

      Diane clicks a remote, freezing the image, as Alicia peers 
      past the other associates to see the partners discuss...

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    That s after how many sessions of 
                    witness prep?

                    The stammering, the nerves -- she 
                    looks guilty.

                                  TAMARA
                    She s innocent.

                                  WILL
                    Yes, well, so is my four-year-old 
                    niece, but I wouldn t put her on

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - HALLWAY - DAY66

      Diane, Will, and TAMARA, a mid-level Associate, confident, 
      certain, never withholds her opinion, exit the conference room:

                                  TAMARA
                    That puts more pressure on the 
                    other witnesses.

                    Yeah, and get some tougher witness 
                    prep.  Jeez, those were whiffle

      Diane and Will look at her.  A sore point.  Tamara might have 
      pushed that too far:

                    Josephson?  No.  I need it to be

                    Darwinian.  More real world. 

      Will and Diane stop, see CARY and Alicia through the glass 
      packing up the conference table.  Will laughs.  Diane too.

                                  DIANE
                    It doesn t get more Darwinian than 
                    that.

      INT. 27TH FLOOR - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY77

      Arson expert witness, KEITH THOMAS, 40s, cocky, knows the 
      drill.  Being taped, questioned...   

                                  THOMAS
                    It was a rush to judgement.  The 
                    fire department labeled it an 
                    arson, but the reality is it could 
                    have been an accident.

      Alicia questioning as Cary watches politely, making notes.  A 
    few other associates watching too.     

                                  ALICIA
                    But arson investigators found 
                    traces of lighter fluid at the 
                    crime scene, didn t they, sir?

                                  THOMAS
                    They re callingit lighter fluid, 
                    but what they really found was 
                    butane-- which is not only 
                      commonplace in a lab, but could 
                      spontaneously ignite.

                                  ALICIA
                    Thank you, sir.

      Cary is up, and on his feet...




                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #107   "Unprepared"   BUFF COLLATED   10/27/09      8.

                      Spontaneously ignite?  Are you 
                    serious?

      Alicia shoots a look toward a confrontational Cary.  Even the 
      witness is a bit surprised.  Um, isn t this witness prep?

                                  THOMAS
                    Yes, I am serious.  I try to be.

      Alicia nods: good.  

                                  CARY
                    Then let s continue in this serious 
                    vein.  Aren t all the flammable 
                    liquids stored in steel cabinets on 
                    the other side of the lab? 

      Cary points toward a diagram of the lab.   

                                  THOMAS
                    Yes, I believe that s correct.

                                  CARY
                    You believe?  So you don t know?  

                                  THOMAS
                          (looks toward Alicia)
                    Wouldn t you object at this point?

                                  CARY
                    No, she wouldn t.

                                  ALICIA
                    Just do your best, sir.

                                  THOMAS
                      I misspoke.  I should ve said: 
                    Yes, that s correct.

      Thomas doesn t like Cary.  And Cary could care less, pointing 
    to a courtroom exhibit: photos of an arson scene:

                                  CARY
                    What about the wax residue found at 
                    the crime scene?  Investigators say 
                    it came from a birthday candle used 
                    as part of a time-delay incendiary 
                    device.  Ever see that before?





                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #107   "Unprepared"   BUFF COLLATED   10/27/09      9.

                                  THOMAS
                    A birthday candle can be used as a 
                    three-minute fuse allowing the 
                    arsonist to flee before a fire.  
                    But I think it s far more likely to 
                    have come from wax paper, which 
                    wouldn t be out of place in a lab.

                                  CARY
                    Yes, I ve seen it all the time in 
                    labs.  For sandwiches or comb 
                      harmonicas.

      Alicia shoots a look toward Cary: okay, come on.

                                  THOMAS
                    That s kind of rude.

                                  CARY

                    No, I m an expert witness, not an 
                      investigator.  

                                  CARY
                    Did you evaluate photos of the

                    But, ultimately, your assessment of 
                    this fire is pure conjecture.

                    Try to keep it competitive.  
                    Tamara, keep me in the loop.

    And that s it.  Dismissed.  Tamara heading back toward Ellen 
    in her office.  Alicia looks toward Kalinda as they walk:

                                  ALICIA
                    What d I miss?

                                  KALINDA
                    Plan B.  Religious fanatics.  Saw 
                    your husband s appeal starts today?

                                  ALICIA
                    Yep.

                                  KALINDA
                    Should be interesting.

                                  ALICIA
                    I m kind of nostalgic for when 
                    things weren t so interesting.

      Kalinda smiles, likes Alicia.  

                                  KALINDA
                    You need a drink.

                                  ALICIA
                    Probably.  

      INT. CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING - COURTROOM #18 - DAY1111

      Peter.  In a suit for the first time in months, and looking 
      great.  Standing at the defense table.  Big man on campus 
      again.  Greets the court reporter.  

                                  PETER
                    Judy, you look good.
                          (she smiles)
                    Hey, Mike, Bob, Alex.

      A few familiar faces in the gallery.  One is ALEX PHELAN who 
      we ll come to meet more fully later.

                                  A.S.A. LANDRY
                    Peter.

      A nod from the entering A.S.A. NATHAN LANDRY.  A bit finicky, 
      peacock-proud.  Finely groomed.  But tough.  Peter nods back:

                                  PETER
                    Nate.  You gained a few pounds.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #107   "Unprepared"   BUFF COLLATED   10/27/09      14.

                          (laughs)
                    Heard you made some new friends in 
                    Tamms.

                                  PETER
                    Yeah, a nice burglar.  I gave him 
                    your address.

      Landry laughs, turns toward the prosecution table.  As Peter 
      smiles, renewed-- he loves this stuff-- whispers to Golden. 

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    You believe it?  I hired Landry.  I 
                    taught him everything he knows.  

                                  GOLDEN
                    Let s hope you didn t teach him too 
                    well.  

      JUDGE HARVEY WINTER breezes into court.  A calm survivor in 
    the Chicago court system.  He watches the parade of humanity 
      pass his bench with a comic knowing eye.  He likes Peter-- or 
      likes comebacks-- but that won t keep him from judging 
      fairly.  Smiling...

                                  JUDGE WINTER
                    Well, Mr. Florrick.  It s been a 
                    long time.  

                                  PETER
                    Your honor, always a pleasure.

      Landry looks between them: great.  Peter schmoozing.  Alicia 
      enters court, starts to slip into a gallery row at the back, 
    but sees Kya sitting there, taking notes.  Alicia instead 
      slips in the front row behind Peter, as Golden stands:

                                  GOLDEN
                    Your Honor, we d first like to

                    Thank you, your honor.  I d also 
                    ask that you consider releasing my 
                    client on electronic monitoring 
                    while the appeal is ongoing--



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #107   "Unprepared"   BUFF COLLATED   10/27/09      15.

                    on the tableat this point, given--

                                  JUDGE WINTER
                    Bail hearing is set for the day 
                    after tomorrow.  Five o clock.  

      Golden and Peter look up.  Really?  Alicia, in the gallery, 
      also caught off-guard... 

                                  A.S.A. LANDRY
                    Your Honor, the state vehemently 
                    objects--

                                  JUDGE WINTER
                    Your vehemence is noted.  There will 
                    be a bail hearing here tomorrow at 
                    Five, Mr. Landry.  You re welcome to 
                    join us.  If there s nothing else to 
                    schedule, next case.

      That s it.  People start to file out.  Peter turns, sees a 
      startled Alicia:  

                                  PETER
                    You believe this?

                                  ALICIA
                    Wow.  

                                  PETER
                    Yes.  I could be out in two days.

      Alicia nods: doesn t know what to say.  As Golden eyes her, 
      senses her ambivalence.

                                  BAILIFF
                    Mr. Florrick.

    The Bailiff.  Time to go.  Peter nods, smiles to Alicia.

                                  PETER
                    See you...  soon?

    And Peter is escorted off as Alicia just stands there.  Wow.

      INT. ALICIA S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING1212

    The garment bag.  Alicia stares at it, hanging from a closet 
      knob.  She opens her closet door.  Starts to hang Peter s 
      suit-- stops-- stares at her clothes filling the rack.

      Experimentally she shoves it all to one side.  Leaving half 
    the rack for men s clothes.  Hangs Peter s suit there.  
      Stares at it.  Unsure.  

                                  GRACE
                    Is he getting out?

      Alicia turns, sees her daughter at the bedroom door.  
      Immediately shifts to attentive parent mode:   

                                  ALICIA
                    How did you-- Who said that?

                                  GRACE
                    It was on-line.  Sixty-five 
                    articles.  One even in Singapore.

    The two start out of the bedroom...

                    an e-mail.  

      Alicia turns to her.  Technology.  A mom s new threat.

      Zach entering the kitchen, everybody getting their own

      INT. CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING - JUROR HOLDING - DAY1414

      Peter sits with Golden and Kya discussing strategy...

                                  KYA
                    No.  First, you reject all press 
                    conferences.  You just want to be 
                    home with your family-- that s all. 
                    No statements, no photos.  Keep the 
                    press starved.  Then they ll eat 
                    whatever you offer.  

    But Peter looks up, sees a man at the door.  ASA ALEX PHELAN 
      (mid-40s).  A trustworthy Jeff Bridges type.  Been around 
      forever.  Likes Peter.

                                  ALEX
                    Private holding room?  Beats lockup.

      Peter laughs, goes to him.  Just the two in the doorway.

                                  PETER
                    Upside of being a  special priority 
                      defendant.  Downside-- everything else.

      Alex laughs, looks both ways, leans in...

                    Landry s gonna throw everything he

                    Wants to do the right thing.  A 
                    little nudge might help.

                                  PETER
                    It s nice to see you, Alex.

                    I think we re fine, but I

                    Thank you for coming in early, Ms.

                    make you comfortable with your 
                    testimony, not to rehearse you, or 
                    get you to remember answers.  In

                    we re doing our job poorly.  You ll 
                    just feel scripted in court.

      Alicia studies it.  The letter.  At the top is a cross inside 
      a sun.  Another letter from the Christian Coalition for 
      Bioethics.  

      INT. ALICIA S APARTMENT BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY2525

      Zach and Grace.  Returning home from school.  Barely 
      tolerating being in the same elevator together:

                                  GRACE
                    Okay, you can drop the cool thing.  
                    We re not at school anymore.

                                  ZACH
                    What cool thing?

                                  GRACE
                    The--  Look at you.  The way you re 
                    standing.

                                  ZACH
                    I m just standing!  What is your 
                    problem?  

      Ding-- the two get off the elevator, and...

      INT. LANDING - ALICIA S APARTMENT LEVEL - DAY2626

      ...stop, seeing a manila envelope on their apartment doormat.  
      A second passes. 

                                  GRACE
                    Maybe it s from mom s work.

      Zach nods, starts slowly toward the envelope, bends down, 
      picks it up.  Reaches for the brad fastener.  

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    Wait-- maybe we should... 

                                  ZACH
                    What?

                                  GRACE
                    I don t know--  

      Zach opens the envelope, pulls out... a DVD.  Stares at it.

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    Great.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #107   "Unprepared"   BUFF COLLATED   10/27/09      27.

      Zach feels something on the back of the disk.  A post-it 
      note.  He flips it over, reads on the back one word... 
       Stop. 

      INT. ALICIA S APARTMENT - ZACH S BEDROOM - DAY2727

                                  GRACE
                    We need to tell Mom about this.  
                    Andthe pictures.

      Grace has the photos (from 101) on the bed.  Zach closes his 
      bedroom door, crosses to his computer, pops the DVD in. 

                                  ZACH
                    No, we don t.

                                  GRACE
                    Yes, we do.  Zach.  You re not the 
                    Dad.  Stop trying to act like one.

                                  ZACH
                    Just go to your room, Grace.  

    But they both shut up, seeing an image appear on the computer 
      screen.  Not a great image.  Degraded.  Think DeLorean.  
      Marion Barry.  A man sitting on a bed.  Heavyset.  Mid-50s.  
      Just the edge of his belly caught in frame.  He s talking.  
    But it s way off-mike.  Undecipherable.  Then...  

      ...a man enters frame.  It could be Peter or not.  It s tall as 
      Peter.  But it s hard to hear, hard to see.  Like a negative 
      image.  The heavy man has a briefcase, sets it on the table.

                                  GRACE
                    Is it?  Is this faked too?

                                  ZACH
                    I don t know.

                                  GRACE
                    This is getting crazy.  Zach: this 
                    is serious.  

                                  ZACH
                    I know.  We agreed: they re trying 
                    to scare Mom.

                                  GRACE
                    Right.  And maybe there s a reason 
                    she should be scared.  

      Zach considers it.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #107   "Unprepared"   BUFF COLLATED   10/27/09      28.

      INT. 27TH FLOOR - BULLPEN - DAY2828

      A cross inside a sun.  The letter from the Christian 
      Coalition for Bioethics.  A pen moves down it, circling every 
      seventh letter.  It belongs to Kalinda, eyeing the page, 
      looking for some kind of code, a laptop beside her.

                                  ALICIA
                    Anything on the CCB letters?

      Alicia at the door.  

                                  KALINDA
                    Depends.  Does  hidvycilfeteenuc  
                    mean anything to you?

                                  ALICIA
                    What s the context?

    The two smile when Alicia sees Daniel Golden in reception.  
      What?  What s he doing here?  

                                  KALINDA
                    How s witness prep?

                                  ALICIA
                    Not bad.  We ll talk.  

      Alicia starts toward Golden as Kalinda eyes CCB s home-grown 
      website on the laptop.  

      Christian Coalition for Bioethics.  The mission statement: 
       Bringing Protestant ideals to science.   Kalinda studies the 
      letter.  A Bible quote at the top: 

       Isaias 9:18: For wickedness is kindled as a fire.   

    She circles the second S in Isaias.  Hmm... Something 
      puzzling her here...

      INT. 27TH FLOOR - BULLPEN - DAY2929

      Golden walks with Alicia toward her office: 

                                  GOLDEN
                    I m so sorry about this, Alicia.  I

                                  GOLDEN
                    I know we ve talked about having 
                    you testify... It might happen 
                    sooner than we anticipated.

      Alicia stops, looks at him...

                                  ALICIA
                    How soon?

                                  GOLDEN
                    Tomorrow.

      Alicia is startled.  Takes a second.  Realizes:

                                  ALICIA
                    You want me to testify at the bail 
                    hearing?

                                  GOLDEN
                          (nods)
                    We need to show the judge that 
                    Peter will have a safe, stable 
                    living situation if he s out on 
                    bail-- that he s welcome home.

      Alicia.  She stares at him.  

                                  ALICIA
                    You know what I d like back?

      Golden nods.  He issorry.

      INT. 27TH FLOOR - ALICIA S OFFICE - DAY3030

      Alicia sits at her desk, a bit beaten.  Golden with her:  

                                  GOLDEN
                    Landry s cross could get personal-- 
                    they think the judge is in Peter s 
                    pocket, so they just want to draw 
                    blood-- so keep your responses 
                    short, to the point, unemotional--

                                  ALICIA
                    I spent six hours prepping 
                    witnesses today.

                                  GOLDEN
                    It s one thing to know it.  Lawyers 
                    always make the worst witnesses.

                                  ALICIA
                    Thanks.

                                  GOLDEN
                    I just want you to be prepared.

                                  ALICIA
                    Who hired Kya?  You or Peter?

      Golden stares at Alicia.

                                  GOLDEN
                    I did.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Why did you hesitate?

                                  GOLDEN
                    I didn t.  Peter has friends who 
                    want to see his reputation 
                    burnished, so in a sense they hired 
                    her.  But she s good.  She 
                    supposedly did the same for the 
                    Madoff sons this year.

                                  ALICIA
                    And that went so well.

      Golden smiles.  

                                  GOLDEN
                    Do you want me to prep you?

                                  ALICIA
                    No.  Thank you.  I think I can 
                    handle it.

                                  GOLDEN
                    If you don t mind me saying: there 
                    is some ambivalence inherentin 
                    your... position, Alicia.  And 
                      ambivalence could hurt Peter s

                                  ALICIA
                    I won t lie on the stand, Daniel.

      INT. ALICIA S APARTMENT - ZACH S BEDROOM - DAY3131

      Zach.  He works in his room.  The DeLorean-like video frozen 
    on his computer screen.  The photos of Peter with a hooker 
    and crack (from episode 101) on his bed.  Zach toys with... 

      ...a purple Apple NANO: a new video Nano.  He turns it on.  
      Checks the video image.  Recording.  Good.  He pulls out...

      ...a small hard disk-- size of a pack of cards.  Cables.  A 
      power source.  He starts to leave the room when...

      ...wait-- he returns to his computer, ejects the DVD, slides 
    the photos and DVD back into a envelope.  He reaches behind 
    his bedroom mirror, a piece of masking tape there.  He...

      ...tapes the envelope back into place.  No one ll look there.  
      And... 

      INT. ALICIA S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALL - DAY3232

      ...Zach exits the apartment door, crosses to a planter across 
      from it.  Nice indoor ficus plant.  White pebbles filled in 
      around the trunk.  

      Zach places the Nano in the planter.  Just the top corner-- 
    the lens corner-- peering above the edge.  He points it 
      toward the door, clicks it on.  Checks the screen.  

      Yep.  A pretty good view of the door.  He tilts it slightly, 
    so it takes in the welcome mat.  Good. 

    He connects the hard drive to it, then the power line.  He 
      plugs the power line into a plug behind the planter. 
      Carefully he scoops white pebbles over the hard drive, power 
      cable, covering them completely.  He backs away and...

      ...looks at his handiwork.  If you look closely you can see 
    the top edge of the Nano, but that s about it.

      Then he grabs his school books from inside the door, and 
      starts off.

      Mary Bennett on the stand.  The real stand.  She stares out 
    at the courtroom, the jury, the...

      ...approaching A.S.A., JOSEPH FORD, loud, high-energy.

                                  FORD

      Shit.  What she was coached not to do.  She shoots a nervous 
      look toward Cary and Alicia in the first gallery row.

                    prepare for that.

    An unusually charitable response from Diane.

                    Make sure Walt holds up.

      There it is.  The warning.  As Diane and Will peel off,  Ellen 
      catches up to Alicia and Cary...

                    He didn t win an award.  The 
                    physics department was honored as a 
                    whole, but--
                          (off Alicia s concern)
                    Even if he embellished his 
                    credentials, the alibi story s 
                    solid.  I wasat the track that

                    The coverarticle he wrote for the

                    turned out to be three paragraphs 
                    on page 46.  He seems to lie in a 
                      self-aggrandizing way-- 

                                  CARY
                    And we can t put someone who 
                      embellishes like that on the stand--

                    No.  What we can t do is elicit 
                    perjured testimony.  So make sure 
                    he doesn t perjure himself.  

      Diane starts out, rushing to a meeting...

      toward her.  Something going on. 

      INT. 27TH FLOOR - BULLPEN - LATER3737

      Kalinda and Alicia walking...

                                  KALINDA
                    So a letter written by the Christian 
                    Coalition for Bioethics should have 
                    all the hallmarks of a Protestant 
                    terrorist group: the logo, the 
                    cryptic, apropos Bible quote, right?

    She points.   Isaias 9:18 - For wickedness is kindled...   

                                  KALINDA (CONT D)
                    So why did they pull a quote from 
                    the Douay-Rheims edition, a 
                      CatholicBible?

      Alicia s puzzled: how does Kalinda know that?  

                                  KALINDA (CONT D)
                    St. Mary s.  K through twelve.  
                      Protestantversions like King James 
                    call it the book of Isaiah - no  s  
                    at the end - and verse 9:18 is some 
                    variation of  For wickedness 
                      burnethlike the fire.   

                                  ALICIA
                    Does the first CCB letter use the 
                    Catholic bible too?

                                  KALINDA
                    Both do.  I think it s a red 
                    herring; I think someone created it 
                    to throw the blame on somebody 
                    else.   

                                  ALICIA
                    Sounds like you might have someone 
                    in mind.  

                                  KALINDA
                    Well, if I were a cynic, I d say our 
                    client.  She s the one who found 
                    this letter on her windshield.

                    You are a cynic.

                                  ALICIA
                    I think Ellen s innocent.

      there.  The front door of his apartment.  Zach s own hands 
      appear on the screen, having set the Nano, and-- there he is-- 
      backing up.  

      Good.  It s working.  

      Zach clicks a key-- fast-forwards-- watching the image race 
    by.  Not much change.  Just the door.  Grace exiting with 
      book bag, rushing off.  Then a figure racing to the door-- 
      nope-- just an apartment cleaning person mopping.  Racing out 
    of the image again.

                    firefighters responded within five 
                    minutes-- that s eight minutes for 
                    her to run two miles?  If she can do 
                    that, she ought to sign up for the

                    Peter Florrick was tried, 
                    convicted, sentenced -- there s no 
                    longer a presumption of innocence--

                                  GOLDEN
                    This isn t about innocence.  This 
                    is about bond.  Mr. Florrick has no 
                    previous record, he s not a flight 
                    risk; he s a family man eager to go 
                    home to his wife and children-- who 
                    are eager to have him--

      --Zach behind her.   

      Shit.  Alicia sees him, can t believe it.  

      Zach nods to her, trying to be adult, and we find the manila

                    Mrs. Florrick, you mentioned the 
                    apartment is a three-bedroom, and 
                    you have two children.  Would they

                    So you and your husband would share 
                    a room?

      Alicia hesitates.  None of this has been discussed.  She 
      shoots a look to Zach as she answers...

                    I had a brief consultation with a

                    the allegations against my husband

      INTERCUT with...

      EXT. CHICAGO POLY TECH CAMPUS - NIGHTA47A47

      ...Alicia wincing as she exits her car, approaches Cary on 
    the college campus.

                                  ALICIA
                    Okay, well that s disappointing.

                                  KALINDA
                    Yep, disappointing-- as in it looks 
                    like she s sending threats to 
                    herself.  Where are you?

                                  ALICIA
                    Poly Tech.  The auditorium.  Cary 
                    and I are checking out her alibi.

    But Kalinda starts to break up.  

                                  KALINDA
                    What--?

                    I m losing you.  Call me back.

                    Hey.  So Walt came out of 
                    Auditorium Four, stood here--

      Cary already walking his way through the alibi.

                                  ALICIA
                    Right.  He came out at 9 pm, looked 
                    across the street--

      Alicia glances.  A few runners on the track.

                    If it s this lighting-- that should 
                    be alright.

                          (Alicia looks at him)
                    Auditorium at school, they have a 
                    scrambler to stop cellphones from 
                    ringing during a performance.  Bet 
                    they have the same thing here.

      Alicia looks at Cary.  And Cary realizes, looks at her.

                    How could Walt phone his mom from

      Cary points to the navigation map, the streets...

                    Walt said he saw the firetrucks 
                    here.  On University Avenue.  But 
                    the fire station-- 
                          (pointing)
                    Is here.  The lab is here.    

    He points to a street running directly between the two.

                                  ALICIA
                    Garden Avenue is a direct route.  
                    Why would firefighters have taken

      Alicia stares at Cary, realizing too:

                    The fuse length was never

                    Around nine, I stepped outside to 
                    make a phone call to my mom.  Right 
                    in front of the recital hall.

                                  WALT
                    No. If I wanted to frame her, why 
                    would I be here vouching for her?  

                                  DIANE
                    I don t know.  Is it because you 
                    set the fire to keep her here 
                    instead of off at the Cambridge 
                      fellowship?  

      Ellen watches this, reeling.

                                  DIANE (CONT D)
                    But you never meant for it to be 
                    pinned on her, did you?  And when 
                    it was, you tried to save her.  
                    With an alibi.  With fake letters 
                    from a hate group-- a red herring. 

      Walt looks up at Ellen...

                                  WALT
                          (quiet)
                      I couldn t... I couldn t let her 
                    go...

                                  JUDGE RANDALL
                    Mr. Gifford, let me quickly say: 
                    you have a Fifth Amendment right 
                    against self-incrimination--  

      A stunned moment as Ellen stares at Walt... Can t believe it.

      INT. CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING - COURTROOM #21 - MOMENTS LATER4949

      Ellen sits in the emptying court, still a bit stunned.  Cary 
      sits beside her... 

                                  ELLEN
                    So the charges are just... dropped.

                                  CARY
                    Against you, anyway.

      Ellen shakes her head.  Still in disbelief about Walt.

                    never happened.

      Ellen nods, overwhelmed.  It s over.

                                  ELLEN
                    Thank you so much... for

      A beat.  Ellen hasn t had the luxury of thinking about that.

                    Start over.

      INT. ALICIA S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALL - DAY5050

      Zach returns from school, book bag over his shoulder when he 
      checks...

      ...the Nano, back in the planter, still recording.  But-- oh 
      no-- it slipped below the planter edge.  Damn.  The lens 
      obscured by the planter edge. 

      INT. ALICIA S APARTMENT - ZACH S BEDROOM - DAY5151

    The apartment door image.  It s on Zach s computer screen 
      racing by again.  Zach watches it.  The image is fine, so 
      what happened?

    The apartment cleaner zooms through the image again 
      vacuuming, and there-- the vacuum becomes big in frame and-- 
      bump.

                                  ZACH
                    Ahhh... dang.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #107   "Unprepared"   BUFF COLLATED   10/27/09      56.
      CONTINUED:5151


      Suddenly the bumped Nano image is dissected by the top edge 
    of the pot, leaving only the top third of the image clear.  
      Zach starts to click the  stop  key when--

      --wait--

      --there s somebody.  Just the top of someone s head in frame.  

      Zach hits a key, slowing down the image to real speed, and he 
      leans forward, watching, listening (the Nano has sound too).

      A figure.  A man.  But just the top of his head.  Dark hair.  
      Passing back and forth in the available part of the frame.  
      Zach turns up the volume all the way.  All the way.  Hears...

      ...footsteps on the marble.  Hears a click-click-click.  What 
    is that.  He waits.  There!

    The man in frame.  Just the back of his head as he pivots 
      there.  Slowly, slowly turning, pivoting.  What s he doing?  
      There are those clicks again.  

      Click-click.  And...

      ...Zach, mouth open, sees what he s doing.  Taking pictures.   
      Pivoting, taking a panoramic picture of the hall.  The camera 
      blocking his face.

      Zach freezes the image.  Leans forward, Zach s eyes a few 
      inches from the computer screen now.  Who is that?  It s the 
      clearest he ll ever make the image.  

      A white man.  With black hair.  A crew-cut.  

      Zach stares at him.  Who is that?

      INT. CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING - COURTROOM #18 - DAY5252

                                  JUDGE WINTER
                    Before I rule on bail, I m told the 
                      prosecution intends to make a 
                    proffer to the court...

      Alicia enters from the back just as Judge Winter sits.  Sees 
    Kya back in court.  Taking notes.

                                  A.S.A. LANDRY
                          (relishing this)
                    That s correct, Your Honor.

                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #107   "Unprepared"   BUFF COLLATED   10/27/09      57.

                                  A.S.A. LANDRY (CONT'D)
                    The State has recently received 
                    evidence that the defendant 
                    attempted to interfere with the 
                    judicial process.

    On Peter, Golden -- what?   

                                  A.S.A. LANDRY (CONT D)
                    I have a signed affidavit from 
                    A.S.A. Alex Phelan stating that 
                    Peter Florrick asked him to try to 
                    influence Your Honor into granting 
                    bail.   

      Peter frowns, looks toward Alex Phelan in the gallery.  

                                  A.S.A. LANDRY (CONT D)
                    Now we know your honor is truly 
                    impartial, and that any influence 
                    would have fallen on deaf ears, but 
                    we also believe that Mr. Florrick 
                    has put you in an awkward position: 
                    confusing the public as to the 
                    impartiality of any bail offer you 
                    might extend.  

      Judge Winter.  He just stares at Landry.  Knows he s being 
      blackmailed into denying bond.   

                                  GOLDEN
                    Your Honor, this is outrageous!

                                  JUDGE WINTER
                    It is that, Mr. Golden!  

                                  GOLDEN
                    It s pure fiction.  

    But Judge Winter pauses.  And Golden and Peter wince: know 
      that they ve lost.  

                                  JUDGE WINTER
                    Mr. Phelan is an officer of the 
                    court, counselor.  Unless you have 
                    concrete evidence that Mr. Phelan 
                    is lying, the proferred information 
                    is considered reliable and 
                    relevant.  Bail is hereby denied.  
                    This court is adjourned.

    And Winter rushes from the court like a crook fleeing the 
      scene of the crime.  Alicia approaches the defense table.  
    Not sure what to say...

                                  ALICIA
                    I m so sorry, Peter.

                                  ALICIA
                    Could he have misinterpreted--

                                  PETER
                    No.  It s just -- betrayal.

    On Alicia - wants to believe him... 

                                  BAILIFF
                    Mr. Florrick.

      Time to go.  The cuffs go back on.  Peter looks at Alicia.  
      Trying to be stoic - but he s crushed.

                                  PETER
                    I really thought I d be leaving 
                    with you.  You ll tell the kids...

                                  ALICIA
                    I will.   

                                  PETER
                    See you...

    Not  soon  anymore.  Peter reaches out with his cuffed hands.  
      Alicia touches them, sees the sadness in his eyes.  Nods 
      goodbye.  The bailiff takes him away, and we stay on Alicia s 
      face.

      Alicia, decompressing on a bench outside.  Staring at 
      nothing, and then -- smiles as Will approaches, joins her.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Peter didn t get bail.

      Will absorbs this, then:

      A long beat.  She turns to him, hesitates, then... ever so 
      slightly... she nods.  A tacit confession.  She is.
