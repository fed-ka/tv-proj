A small caveman community made up of five large caves, all
facing out towards a crackling fire.
Slack-jawed, yet strong and confident CAVEMEN stumble about,
dragging haunches of meat, pounding the dirt with sticks,
dragging the women.
WE PAN OVER to a small cave. Not even really a cave at all,
but a crack in the rocks barely large enough to sleep in.
Stepping out of this "cave" is a small, weak, nerdy-looking
caveman.
The chief caveman, set apart by the large mallet he wields,
steps towards the fire and grunts loudly to mark the
beginning of a caveman meeting.
"Loser caveman" steps forward apprehensively, only to be met
with laughter from the other cavemen. "Loser caveman" sighs
and shrinks back into his sad, little cave, watching them
from the shadows.
CHIEF CAVEMAN
(grunting; subtitled)
Me see beast today. Beast scary.
Beast danger for caveman.
The rest of the cavemen look nervous.
CHIEF CAVEMAN
If caveman kill beast? Caveman
safe. Caveman have food.
The cavemen grunt in understanding.
CHIEF CAVEMAN
Who kill beast?
The cavemen grunt amongst themselves. The toughest of the
bunch steps forward, pounds his chest and grunts.
CHIEF CAVEMAN
Grob kill beast. Good Grob.
The chief notices "loser caveman" watching from a distance.
CHIEF CAVEMAN
Loser want kill beast?
All the cavemen turn and laugh at the "loser caveman".
CHIEF CAVEMAN
Loser kill nothing!
2.
All the cavemen laugh hysterically.
CAVEMAN #1
Look at Loser cave! So small!
CAVEMAN #2
Loser dumb!
CAVEMAN #3
Fuck that guy!
All the cavemen pick up rocks and begin throwing them at the
"loser caveman", who dives out of his cave and runs around
the camp, dodging their blows.
Everyone in the village is asleep. Everyone, that is, but
"loser caveman" who sleeps uncomfortably in his tiny little
cave, tossing and turning, unable to get comfortable.
A stirring in the trees causes "loser caveman" to sit
upright. There's something outside of the village. Something
big.
Suddenly a GIANT TUSKED BOAR pushes through the trees and
stands, looking quite menacing, not ten yards from the
village fire.
"Loser caveman" is practically shaking with fear. The boar
makes eye-contact with "loser caveman" and charges directly
towards his tiny little cave.
The giant boar runs head first into the cave opening, but the
opening is too small for the beast to fit its head inside.
"Loser caveman" screams like a girl.
The boar backs up to strike again -- this one sure to be the
end of "loser caveman" -- when a large boulder, knocked loose
by the Boar's first hit, tumbles down and lands smack on the
Boar's head, killing it instantly.
The entire village runs out to see what has happened. The
"Loser caveman" stumbles out of the cave and dusts himself
off.
The chief steps forward.
CHIEF CAVEMAN
The beast! It dead!
3.
CAVEMAN #2
Hey, look at loser! He almost die!
Look he scared!
Everyone laughs. The Chief looks towards Loser, standing
nervously near the corpse of the Giant Tusked Boar.
CHIEF CAVEMAN
Loser, what happen?
LOSER CAVEMAN
(SHAMEFULLY)
The Beast, it came at me. It smash
my cave.
Everyone laughs hysterically. WE PAN over the many laughing
faces, pointing and hooting at loser caveman's cowardice. We
watch as the "loser caveman's" face turns bright red, the
veins in his neck pop out and his fists clench up tightly.
SUDDENLY WE FLY into the caveman's skull, traveling through
his cerebral cortex and towards the frontal lobe of his
small, homo erectus brain. Sparks are flying back and forth
across his brain as his synapses fire in rapid succession.
There is a SMALL EXPLOSION.
We fly back out of "loser caveman's" skull -- his face
contorted in rage.
He interrupts everyone's laughter.
LOSER CAVEMAN
Hold on one minute!
Everyone stops laughing.
LOSER CAVEMAN
Loser wasn't finished.
Loser caveman stands up straight and tall -- all of a sudden
the Bruce Willis of cavemen.
LOSER CAVEMAN
After beast smash cave, Loser look
at beast and say, "not on Loser's
watch." Loser grab rock on ground,
lift above head and smash it
down... right onto motherfucker's
head.
The entire village gasps.
4.
LOSER CAVEMAN
Loser kill beast.
(PAUSE)
Now fuck off, Loser going back to
sleep.
The chief steps forward ominously, then proclaims:
CHIEF CAVEMAN
Loser kill beast! Loser caveman
hero!
Loser steps forward, grabs the prettiest of all cavewomen and
drags her towards his cave as the entire village erupts in
cheer.
FREEZE FRAME:
NARRATOR
The world's first lie. A monumental
occasion in the history of mankind.
(PAUSE)
That lowly caveman who stumbled
upon the ability to lie went on to
become chief of his village,
married dozens of cavewomen, and
passed on the lying gene to
hundreds of newborn cave-children.
(PAUSE)
Over time lying spread throughout
the world, sparking the eventual
birth of imagination itself, story-
telling, religion, and the oh-so-
important polite lie, as in, "Oh
Patty, have you lost weight? You
look fantastic."
(PAUSE)
The world would be a very different
place if events had gone otherwise
on that prolific, Paleolithic eve.
If not for that night, man would
have never acquired the ability to
lie to himself and to others.
(PAUSE)
A world without lying would be a
world without dreams. A world
without pretense. A world without
fiction. A world without flattery.
A world very unlike our own.
UNFREEZE:
The film rewinds about thirty seconds, to the point where the
chief asked what happened with "loser caveman" and the boar.
5.
CHIEF CAVEMAN
Loser, what happen?
LOSER CAVEMAN
(SHAMEFULLY)
The Beast, it came at me. It smash
my cave.
AGAIN WE FLY into the caveman's skull, traveling through his
homo erectus brain. Sparks are flying back and forth across
his brain as his synapses fire in rapid succession...
But this time there's no explosion.
We fly back out of "loser caveman's" skull -- his face
contorted in rage.
The rage slowly fades and Loser just stands there, everyone
in the camp waiting for him to say something.
LOSER CAVEMAN
Rock fall on beast. Loser do
nothing. I think Loser even soil
bear pants.
(pause; sniffing)
Loser smell bad.
Everyone falls onto the ground laughing hysterically.
CHIEF CAVEMAN
Loser biggest loser ever! Caveman,
throw rocks at loser!
Everyone in the camp joins in on another round of throwing
rocks at "loser caveman" as he runs around the camp,
terrified and miserable.
FADE TO BLACK.
INSERT: "PRESENT DAY. LOS ANGELES, CA."
FADE UP:
A completely indistinguishable Los Angeles mid-rent apartment
complex.
MARK BELLISON pulls up in his early nineties Volvo, parks and
enters.
6.
Mark walks Jennifer to the front door of her apartment
complex.
MARK
Thanks for going on this date with
me. You're way, way out of my
league and I know you were just
doing it as a favor to Greg, and
that most likely I'll never hear
from you again.
JENNIFER
I actually had a better time than I
thought I'd have, but I won't know
for sure how I feel about you until
I'm less drunk.
MARK
Give me a call if you still like me
once you're sober.
JENNIFER
I might.
Mark leans in for a kiss. Jennifer kisses him on the cheek
and goes inside.
MARK
Thanks for kissing me on the cheek,
I know you didn't have to do that
and....
Jennifer waves and heads inside.
MARK
(shouting after her)
... you're very pretty. Thank you!
15.
Mark parks his car and walks towards a large office building.
The sign on the building reads: "LECTURE FILMS MOTION PICTURE
STUDIOS -- We Film Someone Telling You About Things That
Happened."
In front of the building is a man in a suit standing on his
briefcase with his tie around his head, screaming.
SCREAMING MAN
This isn't natural! None of this is
natural! We're all animals! This
doesn't feel right! Why am I
wearing clothes? How can you people
live like this? Where did all this
concrete come from?!
Mark walks right by him. A woman in a business suit stops him
on his way through the front door.
WOMAN IN BUSINESS SUIT
I don't want to go in there today.
I just don't. You know?
Mark nods understandingly and enters the building.
18.
ANGLE ON SIGN: "A SAD PLACE FOR HOPELESS OLD PEOPLE"
Mark enters the building.
Bursting out of the bank, Mark is a caveman who just invented
fire.
Mark and Greg sit at the bar, Greg half listening as an
inspired Mark ends his monologue.
MARK (CONT'D)
... I said something... that
wasn't.
Greg perks up.
36.
GREG
Huh?
MARK
I said something... that... wasn't.
I... what's the word I'm looking
for? Well, there is no word. Of
course there's not, I just invented
it.
Mark is frustrated by his inability to explain.
MARK
Here. Watch.
(calling over bartender)
Jim.
JIM, mid-40's, short and stout, waddles over.
JIM
What?
Mark, stands up, clears his throat, and holds his hands out
like "gimme some room".
There's a long pause as Mark summons his newfound talent:
MARK
(PROFOUNDLY)
My name is Doug.
Greg and Jim look at Mark confusedly.
GREG
(dead serious)
Your name is Doug.
JIM
(without hesitation)
Hi Doug.
GREG
It amazes me that I never knew your
real name.
(PAUSE)
Doug is good. It suits you.
Mark is flabbergasted.
MARK
Come on guys. Are you serious?
What's my name?
37.
GREG
It's Doug.
JIM
Doug.
MARK
No. My name is Mark.
GREG
(still dead serious)
Your name is Mark.
JIM
(still without hesitation)
Hi Mark.
GREG
Mark suits you much better.
JIM
Mark-o.
MARK
You guys aren't following me.
(THINKING)
Okay, guys...I'm black.
GREG
I knew it.
JIM
You're very light skinned, but I
can see it.
GREG
I've always wanted a black friend.
Mark punches the bar in anger.
MARK
Fuck it, I'm an Eskimo.
GREG
Fantastic.
JIM
I've never seen a black Eskimo.
MARK
Okay, I'm a pirate.
GREG
I didn't know they still had those.
38.
JIM
Are you a dangerous pirate?
MARK
Okay then, I'm a lion tamer... and
I have purple hair.
GREG
Aren't you scared you'll get bitten
one day?
JIM
(to Greg)
I want to die my hair purple just
like Mark's.
Greg nods. Mark sighs.
INSERT: "TWO HOURS LATER"
Mark sits at the bar looking completely bored.
JIM
I'm a one-armed Jewish space
explorer.
GREG
When's your launch date?
JIM
Shalom. How'd you lose your arm?
MARK
I invented the bicycle.
GREG
I love your work.
JIM
Can you get me a discount on a ten
speed?
Mark sighs, finishes his beer and gets up to leave.
MARK
I give up. And I'm bored.
Mark heads towards the door, dejected. He turns back.
MARK
Guys, if you had the power to make
things the way you wanted them,
what would you do first?
39.
GREG
If I could do anything in the
world?
JIM
Anything at all?
MARK
Pretty much.
Greg and Jim think this over long and hard.
GREG
I'd bone bitches asses.
JIM
Right in the ass.
MARK
Specifically the ass?
GREG
If I could change things I would
make all the hot chicks bone me.
JIM
Agreed.
Mark mulls this over.
MARK
Alright then, let's try that.
Mark downs his beer and heads towards the exit.
GREG
Where are you going?
MARK
Out.
Mark walks the street, a hunter looking for his prey.
Within seconds Mark spots a gorgeous blonde walking right
towards him. He stops in his track, quickly trying to decide
how best to proceed.
But as the blonde passes him he just stares at her like a
deer in the headlights.
40.
BLONDE
Don't look at me, I'm not attracted
to you.
The blonde walks away. Mark stands on the sidewalk staring
off into space, the wheels in his mind working overtime. Then
it hits him.
MARK
Wait!
BLONDE
Don't bother. I've heard it all
before.
MARK
(BLURTING)
THE WORLD IS GOING TO END IF WE
DON'T HAVE SEX RIGHT NOW!
Immediately the blonde's eyes well up in tears. She is
terrified.
BLONDE
Do we have time to get to a motel
or do we have to do it right here?
Mark is a caveman who just invented his penis.
The neon sign outside reads "A Cheap Motel for Intercourse
with a Near Stranger".
We slowly PUSH IN on the door of room 206. We hear noises
inside that at first sound like moaning, but as we get
closer... they sound more like crying.
Mark walks across the parking lot. A look of total shock on
his face.
Mark pulls in front of the Bellagio hotel and casino. Both
Mark, and a very hungover looking Greg, pop out of the car.
Mark hands the keys to the valet and they both stumble
inside.
Mark hustles through the parking lot, manuscript in hand. He
reaches the door and then stops -- remembering something.
Mark runs to the curb and throws his manuscript onto the
dirty, filthy street. He gets down on his hands and knees and
rubs his manuscript into the grime, making sure to get every
page equally filthy.
Satisfied, he organizes the pages into a neat pile and enters
Lecture Films.
Jennifer pushes through the throng of people, which is now
even larger than before. As she reaches the door Mark opens
it for her and slides her through.
MARK
Come up quick, they look like they
could get out of hand any second.
Mark hurries Jennifer into the elevator.
Mark's neighborhood is a sea of candles. The crowd has grown
beyond measure. A massive sea of people, all holding candles,
all waiting quietly like serene cows for Mark to come down
and make his announcement.
OTS of Newscaster cameraman. The newscaster is interviewing a
young man, with Mark's apartment building in the background.
YOUNG MAN
I heard that he said we all get
mansions, and that there's even
ponies.
NEWSCASTER
(to cameraman)
Ponies. Mansions. Ice Cream. These
are the things we can all expect
when we die. What else can we
expect? We won't know until Mark
Bellison steps out of that...
YOUNG MAN
(SHOUTING)
THERE HE IS!
Mark cracks open the front door and steps out onto his front
steps, with Jennifer right behind him. The newscaster and
cameraman run to get into position.
Mark looks out at the sea of people staring silently at him,
waiting for answers.
81.
MARK
Hello.
A man runs up and hands Mark a microphone.
MARK
Oh, thanks.
His voice echoes through the neighborhood.
MARK
Wow.
You could hear a pin drop. No one is even breathing.
MARK
So. I guess you've all heard the
things I told my grandmother last
night and... I understand why
you're here.
(PAUSE)
I know... some things. Some very
important things. And I'm going to
share these things with you now.
Intercut throughout: different video feeds, people listening
to radios, standing in the cold watching TV's through store
windows -- all around the world.
Mark takes a deep breath and holds up his "pizza box
commandments".
MARK
Everything you want to know is
written here. On this old pizza
box.
Mark looks out at the crowd, all of them so hopeful, so
needy. Mark looks back at Jennifer and Greg who give him a
proud nod.
MARK
(READING)
Number one: There is a man who
lives in the sky who controls
everything. Number two...
MAN #1
(interrupting; shouting)
Whoa, whoa whoa. What does he look
like?
Mark wasn't prepared for questions.
82.
MARK
(STRUGGLING)
Tall. Big hands. A good head of
hair.
WOMAN #1
What ethnicity is he?
MARK
(making it up as he goes)
He's a new ethnicity. It's like a
mix of all of our ethnicities.
MAN #2
Does he live on a cloud?
MAN #3
Can we see him?
MARK
(becoming confident)
No. He lives much higher than the
clouds, too high to see.
WOMAN #2
So he lives in space?
MARK
No, not that high.
MAN #3
So you mean the Thermosphere?
MARK
Look, people I got a lot to get
through here. I'm just telling you
what I know: Man. Lives in the sky.
You can't see him. Controls
everything. Cool?
Everyone nods.
MARK
Number two: When you die you don't
disappear into an eternity of
nothingness. Instead, you go to a
really great place.
(PAUSE)
Number three: In that place every
person will get a mansion.
MAN #4
What kind of mansion?
83.
MARK
I don't know. Whatever kind of
mansion you're thinking of right
now.
WOMAN #3
Oh no! I wasn't thinking of a
mansion!
A lot of people echo this sentiment.
MAN #5
Shit! I was thinking of a horrible
mansion!
MARK
Look, it's the best mansion you can
think of, not just now, but ever.
Whatever the best mansion for you
can possibly be, that's the one
you'll get.
(CONTINUING)
Number four: When you die, all the
people you love will be there too.
MAN #6
Will they have their own mansions?
MARK
Yes, of course. Everyone gets a
mansion.
MAN #6
What if I want them to live in my
mansion?
MARK
If they want to live with you, they
can leave their mansion and live in
yours.
MAN #6
What happens to their mansion?
MARK
I don't know, it goes back on the
market.
WOMAN #4
What about the people I hate? Will
they be there too?
MARK
No.
84.
WOMAN #4
Where are they?
MARK
Okay, they're probably there, but
you'll never see them. They're far
off, too far for you to get there.
WOMAN #4
But what if they try to find me?
MARK
They won't. They hate you too.
WOMAN #4
But what if they don't? What if
they love me but I hate them?
MARK
Well then you're just... you'll
both be fine with it. There's only
love there, okay?
(CONTINUING)
Number five: When you die there
will be free ice cream. All day.
All night. Whatever flavor you can
think of.
WOMAN #5
What, even bad flavors?
MARK
But why would you eat bad flavors?
WOMAN #5
Well, you just said every flavor I
can think of.
MAN #8
Oh no, I just thought about vanilla
and skunks!
MARK
Well don't eat it then!
WOMAN #6
I've just thought the chocolate
sauce is diarrhea!
MARK
Well don't put it on then! What's
wrong with you people? I mean...
(CONTINUING)
(MORE)
85.
MARK (cont'd)
Number six: If you do bad things
you won't get to go to this great
place when you die.
MAN #9
Where will you go?
MARK
A terrible place. The worst place
imaginable.
A rumble of terror moves through the crowd.
WOMAN #7
What constitutes a bad thing?
MARK
Murder. Crime. Rape. Things like
that.
WOMAN #7
You have to tell us all the things
or else we might do them and it
wouldn't be our fault!
The whole crowd echoes this sentiment.
MARK
Fine.
MAN #9
Is punching someone bad?
MARK
Yes.
MAN #9
What if they're trying to hurt you?
MARK
Then it's fine.
WOMAN #7
Is cursing bad?
MARK
No.
WOMAN #1
What about being late for work?
86.
MARK
That's fine too. I mean, you might
lose your job if your boss doesn't
like it, but it won't effect what
happens after you die.
WOMAN #2
What about if you forget to feed
your dog?
MARK
That also is fine. Unless the dog
dies. Then it's bad.
MAN #1
If you do just one bad thing do you
go to the bad place?
MARK
No. You get...
(thinking about it)
... three chances. If you do three
bad things you're out.
MAN #1
Like baseball!
MARK
Kind of, yes.
There's a hubbub throughout the crowd: "It's like baseball",
"I love baseball" "I'm scared of the bad place".
MARK
Any more?
About fifty people stand up and ask their questions at the
same time.
MARK
Look, can we just move on?
MAN #2
No! We have to know everything
that's bad!
MARK
Fine. Let's start with you...
(POINTING)
MAN #3
Is it bad to wear pants?
87.
Mark sighs.
DISSOLVE TO:
INSERT: "SIX HOURS LATER"
MARK
No. There's no hairstyle that will
put you in the bad place. Like I've
told you, the main things are
hurting people physically on
purpose, taking people's stuff,
doing things to people they don't
want done, killing people on
purpose. Okay? Are we good?
The crowd nods apprehensively. Many of the people in the
crowd are crying.
One of the crying men, shaking like a leaf, stands up, with
terror in his eyes.
CRYING MAN
(SHAMEFUL)
I've done many of those bad things.
Is there anything I can do to not
go to the bad place? Help me, I'm
so scared.
MARK
Well, you didn't know about these
bad things until I told you just
now so you're fine.
MAN #8
(CRYING)
Am I fine?
WOMAN #5
(CRYING)
What about me?
Tons of people shout similar sentiments.
MARK
You're all fine! I'm only talking
about people who do bad things
starting right now. Everyone else
is fine.
The crowd erupts in a massive cheer. People hug each other
passionately, wiping tears from their eyes.
88.
MARK
(READING)
Number seven: The man in the sky
who controls everything decides if
you go to the good place or the bad
place. He also decides who lives
and who dies.
MAN #4
Does he cause natural disasters?
MARK
Yes.
WOMAN #3
Did he cause my mom to get cancer?
MARK
Yes.
WOMAN #4
Did he cause that tree to land on
my car last week?
MARK
Yes.
The crowd is quiet for a long beat....they're mulling this
over. The first man to speak is a blue collar guy with a
thick Brooklyn accent.
BLUE COLLAR GUY
I say fuck the guy that lives in
the sky!
The whole crowd erupts in agreement. People stand up
shouting, flicking off the sky.
MAN #5
Yeah! That guy's a fucking asshole!
WOMAN #5
That motherfucker better hope I
never see him face to face!
MAN #6
That guy's a fucking coward! Hiding
up there and doing bad shit to us!
Why doesn't he do it to our faces?
WOMAN #6
We need to stop that motherfucker
before he kills us all!
89.
Mark looks worried. He didn't anticipate this. Suddenly a
thought occurs to him.
MARK
(SHOUTING)
WAIT!
Everyone quiets down.
MARK
This guy who lives in the sky and
controls everything is also
responsible for all the good stuff
that happens.
The whole crowd "aaaahhs".
MAN #7
He's the guy who saved my life on
that fishing trip when the boat
capsized?
MARK
Yup.
MAN #7
Did he capsize the boat?
MARK
Well, yes.
WOMAN #7
He's the one who killed my
grandmother and left me those
millions of dollars?
MARK
You betcha.
WOMAN #3
So is he the same one who cured my
mom's cancer?
MARK
That too.
The crowd thinks this over.
MAN #8
So he's kind of a good guy, but
he's also kind of a prick too?
90.
MARK
Right. But check this out:
(CONTINUING)
Number eight: Even if the man in
the sky does bad shit to you, he
makes it up to you by giving you an
eternity of good stuff after you
die.
The crowd "aaahhs" again.
WOMAN #1
As long as you don't do any of the
bad stuff you listed, right?
MARK
Right. Of course.
WOMAN #2
So it's kind of a test?
MARK
Yes. Right.
(PAUSE)
Well, that's it. That's everything
I know.
Mark looks out at the crowd, they're all exhausted, their
minds completely blown. The Nurse who started this all steps
forward.
NURSE #1
How do you know these things?
MARK
(THINKING)
The man in the clouds told me.
NURSE #1
Yeah, but how come we're just
learning these things now, millions
of years into our existence?
MARK
I don't know, he forgot or
something. I gotta go people, good
night!
Mark takes Jennifer by the hand and pulls her back inside his
building.
91.
Mark and Greg are shit-faced, sitting around Mark's giant
swimming pool.
98.
MARK
Hey, watch this.
(yelling over the fence)
HEY PEOPLE!
About forty voices shout back: "He's talking to us!" "Maybe
he has more answers!" "Finally!"
MARK
The man in the sky just told me
something!
Mark snickers to himself. Greg, drunk and stupid, can't help
but snicker too.
MARK
You're all gay!
Mark and Greg explode laughing. From the other side of the
fence we can hear people mumbling shock. "I am gay." "I
always knew it." "This is going to be awkward for my
husband."
MARK
And adopted!
Mark and Greg almost roll into the pool they're laughing so
hard. The people on the other side of the fence aren't
laughing: "Who's my real mother?", "This explains so much",
"Dad, why didn't you tell me?"
GREG
I don't know why we're laughing.
It's really probably very sad for
those people.
MARK
I'm gettin' a beer.
Mark hobbles up and walks into the house. Moments later he
emerges with two cokes.
MARK
Out of beer. Just Coke.
Mark tosses Greg a Coke and sits down on his chaise lounge,
cracking open his Coke and taking a sip.
MARK
I want to do something big again.
Like telling the people what
happens when they die. That felt
good. I gotta do something big like
that again.
99.
GREG
Maybe the Man in the Sky will tell
you something new.
MARK
Maybe.
Mark looks down at his can of Coke.
CLOSE ON COKE CAN: The warning label is extremely long and
written in very small type. It starts with, "COKE IS VERY BAD
FOR YOU. The following are diseases, physical ailments and
general health issues that coke might cause:"
The label then goes on to list dozens of ailments. Mark's
eyes scan down to the very bottom of the label where it says
simply, "If you still want to drink Coke, do so at your own
risk."
Mark looks over to find Greg staring at the depressing label
as well.
GREG
Ugh, this shit is so bad for you. I
really shouldn't drink this.
Mark stares at this label for a moment, thinking. With his
hand he covers everything on the label except for "Please
Enjoy Coke."
He smiles widely.
MARK
Hey, Greg. What if I told you that
drinking Coke was good for you?
Greg turns to him, his face full of hope.
MARK
And not just Coke. But all the
delicious foods you're not supposed
to eat. What if they were all of a
sudden really, really good for you?
GREG
It would be the happiest day of my
life.
CUT TO:
100.
The sign outside reads, "A QUITE PLACE TO THINK ABOUT THE MAN
IN THE SKY".
GREG
Makes sense people would start
getting married at these places. I
mean, who you marry decides who's
mansion you're going to live in one
day. It's a big decision.
110.
MARK
Yeah.
They enter the building.
Mark loosens his tie as he walks out of the building and
towards the street.
In the background we can see the "church" door open.
JENNIFER
(SHOUTING)
Hold on a minute!
Mark turns, confused and tired.
Jennifer runs to him. She stands before him, they both stare
at each other.
MARK
What?
Jennifer pulls out Mark's letter and shows it to him.
JENNIFER
I'm confused.
114.
MARK
So am I.
JENNIFER
Is any of it... the things you
said... are they... I can't think
of the word.
(PAUSE)
Is there a Man in the Sky?
MARK
No.
JENNIFER
Why'd you say there was?
MARK
Because I couldn't cope with the
look on my grandmother's face.
JENNIFER
But how could you say something
that... wasn't.
MARK
I'm not sure. I just did it.
JENNIFER
And what did you mean that I could
grow old and ugly and still be
beautiful to you?
MARK
I mean just that. You'll always be
beautiful to me.
JENNIFER
But what if my looks...
MARK
It doesn't matter.
JENNIFER
I feel funny.
MARK
Me too.
(PAUSE)
Everything is so hard. Nothing is
easy anymore.
There is a long moment of silence. Jennifer moves closer to
Mark and looks directly into his eyes.
115.
JENNIFER
I know what I want.
MARK
What?
JENNIFER
I want short, fat kids with little
snub noses.
The biggest smile we've ever seen comes across Mark's face.
MARK
(JUBILANTLY)
Easy! That's an easy one.
Just
like she did the night on her couch, Jennifer reaches
over
and puts her hand on Mark's wrist. They both stare at
each
other for a long beat, holding hands, love beaming from
both
of them.
The world is changing before their eyes.
JENNIFER
Does anyone else know about your
invention?
MARK
No. But I'm sure it won't be long.
JENNIFER
Should we tell them right away?
MARK
I'm not sure. I don't think
everyone will understand.
Greg sticks his head out of the church door.
GREG
What's going on out here?
Everyone's just sitting in there.
Are we gonna finish this wedding?
Jennifer smiles at Mark.
JENNIFER
Yes.
Mark smiles back.
MARK
Praise the Man in the Sky.
116.
WE RISE UP as Mark and Jennifer walk hand in hand towards the
church -- and an unknowable future.
NARRATOR
The world's last moment of honesty.
A monumental occasion in the
history of mankind.
(PAUSE)
That lowly writer who stumbled upon
the ability to lie went on to
become one of the most important
men of his age, married to one of
the most beautiful women of his
time, and passed on the lying gene
to generations to come.
(PAUSE)
A world without honesty is a world
with dreams. A world with pretense.
A world with fiction. A world with
flattery. And most importantly, a
world with true love. Put simply, a
world very much like our own.
FADE TO BLACK.
