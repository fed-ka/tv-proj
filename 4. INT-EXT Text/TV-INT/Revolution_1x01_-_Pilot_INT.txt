 RACHEL MATHESON, 28, sits at the table.  Idly plays  Words
 on her iPad.   with Friends 

When from the hall-- she hears the FRONT DOOR.  Then a THUMP! 

RACHEL
Ben...?

No answer.  Rachel stands, heads into the next room--


--only to see a stack of BOXES.  SOUP CANS.  Over a hundred 
 finest.  of Campbell s

And an OPEN FRONT DOOR.  Frowning, Rachel moves outside--


MILES MATHESON, 24, a Marine.  Likable; his face is an open 
book.  He rides shotgun.  His best friend BASS, 26, drives.  
Their buddy OLIVER, 21, in the back.  Long night at the bar.  

Ollie chuckles at a text.  Furiously texts back.3.


MILES
What?

OLIVER
Just talking to that waitress.  The 
red head.  

MILES
You ever consider just... you know?

MILES

  Oliver shoots Miles a strange look.  No.  No, he hasn t.

OLIVER

BASS
You know, deep down, he kinda is.

Miles checks the I.D.  He answers, casual-- he speaks to his

Ben, cell to his ear, at his LAPTOP.  As he speaks, he shoves

MILES

MILES
Ben?  Hello? 


BEN
Miles!

Ben hangs up.  Anxious.  Afraid.  Back to his laptop.

ON THE SCREEN.  That downloading PROGRESS BAR.  Almost 
 finished!   there... almost... it sDOWNLOAD COMPLETE.  

Just as the computer screen STROBES BRIGHTLY-- then FLICKERS 
OFF.  As do all the lights.  

Ben removes the FLASH-DRIVE.  Folds the port back, as we 
realize-- it s disguised as an ELEGANT SILVER PENDANT.  Real 
James Bond shit. 


 PHONE shorts out.  In the back seat.  Oliver s5.


OLIVER

DASH READ-OUTS FLARE.  Then expire.  Bass notices, gives them 
a firm knuckle rap.

BASS
Aw, come on...

MILES
(troubled)
...I think you should pull over.

Bass nods-- Miles is right.  Bass crosses a lane.  Pumps the 
anti-locks.  But nothing is happening--

MILES
Bass.  I said stop the car. 

BASS

MILES

BASS
Whattaya think I mean?!  Goddam 
brakes are out!

OLIVER
What!?

Bass tries again.  But the car only ROCKETS FORWARD-- FASTER--

MILES
Then-- pull the Emergency!

Bass YANKS the emergency brake.  SCREEEEECH!  

The Challenger SPINS OUT, right there in the middle of the 
highway!  Spinning-- SPINNING!  A nail-biting beat--

Before it finally comes to a rest.  On the shoulder of a 
FREEWAY OVERPASS.

Miles.  A deep sigh of relief.  Christ.  

 quite so relieved-- he glances out the But Bass isn t
windshield-- AS ALL AROUND THEM-- OTHER VEHICLES CAREEN and 
CRASH.  Out of control.

BASS
We gotta get off the road--6.



Next CAR we see is a battery powered TOY.  Like the real 
 spinning in daft, pointless circles. ones, it s

A CRIB.  Inside-- DANNY, 2, is awake.  Grips his railing.  
Watching, curious, as--

More toys suddenly come to life.  All at once.  Whirring 
Teddy Bears.  Talking Dolls.  Tinny police SIRENS.  

A girl-- CHARLIE, 5, in an adjacent bed.  Wakes.  Takes in 
 old enough to know to be the uncanny sight.  She s
frightened...

CHARLIE
Mommy...?!

Rachel RUSHES IN-- just as all the toys SUDDENLY and 
PERMANENTLY DIE.  Rachel sits beside her daughter, lovingly 
brushes hair from her face-- 

RACHEL

 okay, Charlie. ...it s

Ben enters.  Locks eyes with his wife.  They speak silent and 
scared volumes to each other.  Then Ben steps to the window.  
Peers out at--

THE CHICAGO SKYLINE.  As... building by building... it begins 
to FLICKER OFF.  To BLACK.

CLOSE ON BEN.  Watching in grim awe.  

of the two-ton BULLETS that fire at them, pell-mell--7.


Finally-- Miles and Bass reach the OFF RAMP.  Pivoting to--

Oliver.  Still lagging behind--

MILES
Would you hurry up?!

When Oliver reaches the EXIT.  Takes a few steps down the 
s safe-- help but exhale, now that he ramp.  Can t

OLIVER
Okay, okay.  Get off my--

SMASH!  A SEMI TRUCK, out of nowhere, POUNDS into Oliver!  
OBLITERATES HIM.  Before it PLUNGES off the exit ramp.  

Off Miles and Bass.  Watching in horror--


A CHYRON:  SYLVANIA, WISCONSIN.   

The pacing calms.  More measured.  Elegaic.  

A HAND patiently STRIKES a wedge of steel against flint.  
Then again.  Then again.  Finally, the spark ignites the 
kindling.  The kindling ignites a fire.  In a living room 
fireplace.  The flames illuminate the face of-- 

Ben Matheson, now 45.  He turns to a FADED, WATER-STAINED 
PHOTO of him and Rachel.  Tacked to the wall.  He lightly 
 face.    touches Rachel s

BEN
    Morning.

HALLWAY.  Ben swings open a door to reveal-- a BEDROOM.  And 
a messy, unmade bed.  He frowns--


It s dusty.  Mildewed.  Shadowed.  Since the vehicle s on its 
 DISORIENTING, too.  A SIDEWAYS FUNHOUSE-- where side-- it s
the ceiling is comprised of a sink, a microwave, a FRIDGE--

 FASCINATED.  By the modern conveniences.  The Charlie s
gadgets.  She remembers them from when she was young, but 
 EXOTIC.  At heart-- still, it s AN EXPLORERSHE S-- RESTLESS--

Behind her, Danny drops in.  He isn t quite so entranced-- he 
sees the windshield-- shattered right where a head would hit-- 

CLOSE ON CHARLIE.  As she looks straight up-- at the overhead 
REFRIGERATOR/FREEZER.  Door lazing open.  It REMINDS HER--  


Another fridge/freezer.  Both doors wide open.  

Charlie, 5.  Sits, wide-eyed, before THREE TUBS of ICE CREAM.  
Rachel hands her a spoon.  Ben watches.  They all wear the 
same clothes from the Tease.  THE NIGHT OF THE BLACKOUT. 11.


CHARLIE
Really?

Her parents trade looks.  Both on the verge of breakdown--

RACHEL

BEN
(choked up)
Whoa.  Slow down, kiddo.  I want 
you to remember-- really remember-- 
what it tastes like.

Rachel still hums, and by now we might recognize the tune-- 
  The pain and fear in Ben and Wild World.   Cat Stevens 
Rachel s faces-- it s tragic.  


CLOSE ON CHARLIE, 20.  Reminiscing.  Then... she reaches up-- 
CLICKS the fridge shut.  And taped to the front-- a POSTCARD.  
FROM NEW YORK CITY.  The Empire State Building.  A real 
treasure.  Charlie smiles.  Pockets it.

Meanwhile-- Danny searches in the hall.  Directly above his 
head-- the BATHROOM DOOR-- he stretches up.  Unclasps the 
lock-- the DOOR FLINGS OPEN--

AND A MUMMIFIED CORPSE COLLAPSES ON TOP OF HIM!  Neck broken 
from the accident, never discovered in the aftermath.  We 
JOLT!  But not as much as Danny-- he SHOUTS--

CHARLIE
Danny!

 Charlie RUSHES OVER-- PULLS her brother to her feet-- he s
out of breath--

CHARLIE
You okay?

But now we notice-- Danny is much more than out-of-breath.  
It grows into a LABORED WHEEZE.  His THROAT CONSTRICTS--  

CHARLIE

MAGGIE
I get it, Charlie, I was twenty 
once, too.  But he s right.  Things 
are different now-- 

Charlie lashes out at an easy target-- to her Dad--

CHARLIE
Why is she a part of this 
conversation?

BEN
Hey--

CHARLIE

CHARLIE

DANNY
Charlie!

The second it escapes her lips, Charlie regrets it.  And sure 
enough, it stops the argument cold.  Ben takes it like a gut 
punch.  Quiet, hurt, he pivots to the dying fire-- 

BEN
That s a good question.  I m... um.  
 low, I should get some more Fire s
wood.  Excuse me.  16.


Ben slumps out of the room.  Maggie, flustered, upset, 
follows.  Danny shoots daggers at Charlie--

DANNY
Good, Charlie, that was great.

OFF Charlie.  She feels terrible.  


JUMP CUTS.  Charlie packs supplies.  Fills old, empty DR. 
PEPPER SODA BOTTLES with pre-boiled water from the kettle.  
Lifts that faded PHOTO of her Mom and Dad.  Places it in her 
LOCKBOX-- and she takes that, too.

She holds Danny s CROSSBOW.  Hers now.  She feels its weight--

MAGGIE (O.S.)

Charlie looks up.  Maggie s the last person she wants to see.

The two warriors approach each other.  Slow.  Wary.  Like 
boxers in a ring.  Waiting for someone to hit first--

 When suddenly, fast as a STRIKING SNAKE, Miles GRIPS Dex s

of food and fresh water.  As the

CHARLIE
Here?  From Portland?

Charlie looks at her.  Is she for real?  But Maggie is dead  
serious.  A tear skips down her cheek.

MAGGIE
Took me years.  Making my way East.  
Hoping for a boat back home.  But 
around Wisconsin, I just... gave 
up.  God help me, I gave up.

Off Charlie.  Perhaps seeing Maggie in a new light--


CLOSE ON CHARLIE.  Sleeping.  Curled up in the luxurious 
leather of a first class seat.  But then... a SLIGHT RUSTLE.  
Charlie wakes.  Still foggy, she sees--   

  A wide, A STRANGE MAN sits next to her.  TREVOR, 30 s.

Trevor digs.  Finds a GLASS BOTTLE of WHISKEY.  He gives 
another troubling plastic grin.  

TREVOR
Oh.  You like to have a good time?  
We like to have a good time, too.   

Trevor takes a healthy pull.  Tosses the bottle to his 
comrades.  They do the same.

Then Trevor discovers Charlie s LOCKBOX.  Opens it.  It s all 
trash to him.  He CRUMPLES the photo of her parents.  But 
then... he pulls out the iPOD.  To Charlie--

Just then... the MOOK restraining MAGGIE-- COUGHS-- Trevor 
COUGHS, too.  They meet eyes.  Frowning--

Now the Mook stares at the WHISKEY BOTTLE in his hand-- and 
as he puts two and two together-- he VOMITS BLOOD-- 

Just as Trevor DOUBLES OVER-- KNIVES in his GUT--

TREVOR
What s in the whiskey, bitch??

MAGGIE

Aaron SHOVES OFF his guard, who s also puking gore-- and our 
three heroes TEAR out of the plane-- 


Maggie opens the door.  Everybody enters.  Quietly searching.  

Aaron spots a stray bottle of moonshine.  Looks around.  
Coast is clear.  Takes a swig.  

Charlie.  Examines the photos on the wall.  When--

A KNIFE is PRESSED against her neck!  Bites into her skin.  
Charlie GASPS-- and MILES is granite-cool--

beneath thick, patchwork quilts.  In a farmhouse bedroom.

An African-American WOMAN, 50 s, sits across.  She s fiercely

GRACE
Well.  If you have to have an 
asthma attack, least you had the 
good sense to have it near me.

She hands him an ASTHMA INHALER.  Rusty, but still amazingly 
 never seen anything like it.  high-tech to Danny.  He s

GRACE
Lucky you, I still have a few of 
these laying around.

DANNY
What is it?47.


GRACE
You breathe it in.  Stops an attack 
before it starts.   

DANNY

She TUGS on his HANDCUFF.  Lifting his wrist with it.  

DANNY

Soldiers.  

GRACE

just what I need, that is peachy.  
I swear, I should ve let you die in

DANNY
Well.  Thank you for not letting

Danny stands.  But immediately sways, weak.  

GRACE
(cranky but warm)
Oh, sit down, before you crack your 
skull open.  You can stay the 
night.  But you leave first thing,

MILES

from Sebastian Monroe... not charge 
down his goddam throat.  

CHARLIE

MILES
Why do you think they took your 
 bait.  And if I go brother?  He s

Him or me.  

CHARLIE
But my Dad said-- look, I m begging

 Stockpiles of weapons.  It s

No... no.ve been through a lot   I 
just to get here-- a helluva lot-- 
and now we re gonna get Danny--  49.


MILES
 that?And why s

CHARLIE
 familyBecause you re! 

A beat of conflicted pain across Miles  face.  We can tell he 
wants to help.  But he quietly responds--

MILES
Haven t talked to your Dad in 
 seen you since you years.  Haven t
 were in diapers.  Family?  We re
strangers.

Charlie.  More than angry.  HURT.  When--

MAGGIE  (O.S.)
Come on.  Your Uncle s made himself 
perfectly clear.  

Maggie stands in the entrance.  Clipped.

MAGGIE
You know, Ben barely even mentioned 
you.  Now I think I know why. 

Charlie follows Maggie out.

Miles.  Guilty.  Calls after them--

MILES
Wait.  At least stay till morning.
(hates this)
Your... friends, too.  

CHARLIE
 think so. I don t

MILES
There s wolf packs on the streets.  
And they hunt at night.  Now come 
on.  Just till sun up.  

Charlie looks at him.  Still pissed.  But relents.


Charlie, Nate, and Maggie sit around a fire-- the smoke 
curling up through a BROKEN STAINED GLASS SKYLIGHT.

Aaron stands at the knick-knack shelves.  Delighted, he 
inspects a LOUIEVILLE SLUGGER BASEBALL BAT.  He sets it back 
on the shelf-- it CLATTERS to the floor.  Much too loud.  50.


Miles.  Behind him.  He might kill Aaron here and now. 

AARON
(a forever beat)
 clearly off on the Look.  We re
wrong foot, let s just start over.  
Hey.  I m Aaron.    

Miles ignores him-- searching for an LP from a stack.

AARON
Okay.  Good talk.  

CHARLIE
Uncle Miles?

MILES
Just Miles.

CHARLIE
d he  Monroe want you?  Why Why s
want my Dad? 

MILES
...it s complicated.

CHARLIE
Yeah, well.  He died over it.  So 
try me. 

Miles winces at that--

MILES
Monroe thinks your Dad and I know 
something.  Something important.  

CHARLIE
 that?  And what s

MILES
Why the power went out.  And maybe 
how to turn it back on.
(off her surprise)
Which would mean tanks, planes, 
guns, factories.  Monroe would 
steamroll the continent, no one 
could stop him. 

MAGGIE
But-- that s just-- Ben was a 
farmer-- before that, he taught 
math--

 thoughtful expression--But then... Maggie sees Charlie s51.


MAGGIE
What?

CHARLIE
 know.  There was a lot he I don t
d  say.  And sometimes he wouldn t
say some strange things--

PUSH IN ON AARON.  Standing at the shelves, his face hidden 
from the group.  He listens.  INTENT.  STRESSED.  From his 
POCKET, he PULLS-- that SILVER PENDANT.  STARES AT IT.  
 talking--Whatever he knows... he ain t

MILES
Of course not.  Whole thing s

Miles finds the LP he s been looking for.  Sets it on a HAND-
WOUND VICTROLA.  Drops the needle.  And of ALL THINGS--  

  Scratchy.Wild World.  Cat Stevens.   It s

 a miracle.  And as she PUSH IN ON CHARLIE.  To her... it s
listens, we TRANSITION TO:

Which makes Miles COMPLETELY UNCOMFORTABLE.  Stiff as a 
 far from paternal.  A lackluster back pat--  board.  He s

MILES
Whoa.  Hey.  Um.  There, there.

MAGGIE
Nice.  Thank you.  

Then Maggie holds Charlie tight.  Or tries to.  Charlie 
stiffens-- not ready for that kind of contact from Maggie.  

CHARLIE

She left.  Four years ago now.

I think the village was too small 
for her.  I think she just...

Miles studies Charlie.  Sympathetic.  So does Maggie.  

MAGGIE
Reminds me of someone.

His heart truly breaks for her.  

NATE

Then, from nowhere-- Nate SAVAGELY, EXPERTLY HEAD-BUTTS 
 jaw!  Miles, then delivers a CRUSHING ROUNDHOUSE across Miles 

Nate RUNS for the door!  Miles takes off after him--

Off Charlie, Maggie, and Aaron-- exchanging shock.  What the 
HELL just happened? 


Charlie.  Maggie.  Aaron.  Watching.  They re unsettled-- not 
because Miles is apoplectic.  Just the opposite.  He s calm.  
Too calm.  He opens a cabinet--

CHARLIE

MILES

AARON

So what are you gonna do?

From the cabinet-- Miles removes a BOTTLE of SCOTCH--

MILES
This is, to the best of my 
knowledge, the last bottle of 
Scotch in Chicago.

I am going to drink it. 

And he proceeds to do so.  Pours it into a glass.

Miles finally bares his fangs--

MILES
I think you ve done enough for me.  
Get the hell out of my bar.
(in her face)
I SAID GET OUT!!  NOW!    

 back down.  She just looks at him.  With Charlie doesn t
pity.  And sadness.  Before she turns away.  Walks out.

Maggie and Aaron give Miles one last look.  Then follow.


 Danny.  Alone.  He stands before a HALLWAY DOOR.  And it s
LOCKED.  With FOUR DIFFERENT LOCKS.  He brushes his hand over 
 a little strange.  When--them.  It s

She hands him a HANDFUL of ASTHMA INHALERS.  He pockets them.

DANNY

She hands him the pack.  Danny smiles.  When-- POUND POUND 
POUND!  The door.  Their blood goes icy.   

GRACE
Get upstairs.  

Danny scrambles up the steps.  Grace smooths out her blouse.  
Opens it.  Revealing Captain Neville.  And two Soldiers.

CAPTAIN NEVILLE
(grins that grin)
Howdy, ma am.  Isn t it just a 
lovely day?

GRACE
 Morning.  

CAPTAIN NEVILLE
 Hate to bother you.  But we re
looking for a young fugitive.  A 
boy, really.  Yay high, brown hair?

CAPTAIN NEVILLE (CONT'D)
So maybe, you think real hard, 
 recollect seeing him after you ll
all.  Now what do you say?

Long beat.  Captain Neville gives a toothy smile.  Folksy 
charm wrapped around jagged iron.  

Then... Grace sags.  Opens the door wider.  Steps back.  
Silently and pointedly looks upstairs.  SURRENDERING Danny.

Captain Neville nods.  Rushes in.  Past a despondent Grace.  

Neville takes the steps, two at a time.  Reaches the bedroom 
door.  THROWS IT OPEN to REVEAL--

The room s empty.  And the WINDOW S OPEN.  And outside, Danny 
SPRINTS through the wheat!  


 still.  Silent.  It s

 uneasy.  As in the b.g., the group We follow NATE.  He s
cautiously moves through the bar.  An organized, military 
sweep.  But no sign of Miles.  Nate leads them into--  


--where Nate stops.  Because Miles didn t run-- didn t hide.  
He stands at the top of the stairs.  SWORD in EACH HAND.  

Nate steps forward.  Tries to talk Miles off the ledge--

NATE
Look.  Monroe wants you alive-- we 
 wanna hurt you--don t

Miles eyes the soldiers.  He s bone-tired.   

MILES

MILES
(a beat; a sigh)
I know.  

The Sergeant nods to his men.  Orders them forward.  They 
 heard the stories, too.  hesitate.  They ve

SERGEANT
Now.

The Soldiers draw their weapons.  Climb the steps.  Towards 
Miles.  Who waits.  We INTERCUT: Soldiers... Miles.    

At the top of the steps... the Soldiers pause.  

A moment frozen in time.  

The rumble before the thunder.  

Then the first Soldier SWINGS.  As does Miles.  Their BLADES 
MEET-- CLANK!  

Multiple Soldiers SURGE FORWARD.  But Miles, sharp tactician 
that he is, has them BOTTLE-NECKED on the steps-- he SLASHES, 
again and again, slicing open MULTIPLE CHESTS.59.


A few beats of SWORDFIGHTING.  But none of that polite 
European fencing shit.  This is a new style.  An AMERICAN 
style.  Bare-knuckle.  Brawling.  

And Miles is a GODDAM VIRTUOSO. 

But there s just too many of them-- they PUSH MILES BACK-- he 
HACKS away, desperately, but they start to OVERWHELM HIM-- 
 wedged up against the balcony ledge--he s

So then Miles leaps off!  Hop-scotches to a high STORAGE 
RACK.  TIPS IT, rides it down to the main floor, Parkour 
meets classic SWASHBUCKLING--  

The Soldiers scramble back down the steps--

ON THE GROUND FLOOR.  Miles.  Out in the open.  Exposed.  

The SERGEANT.  Approaches.  And this guy KNOWS his way around 
s   He Raiders.  like the SWORDSMAN from  a blade.  He s
INFURIATED.  Miles has already killed a pile of his men.  But 
Nate blocks his way--

NATE
We need him alive--

SERGEANT
Look at my men, go fuck yourself--

The Sergeant shoves Nate out of the way--

Miles braces for the attack.  Only problem--

 SURROUNDED.  Soldiers advance from all sides.  Warily He s
closing in on Miles-- as if approaching a rattlesnake.  

MILES.  Spins, slow.  Knows the score.  A deep breath-- 

Then he ATTACKS!  Takes on the Sergeant-- and multiple 
 FORMIDABLE and TOUGH and WILY Soldiers.  All at once!  He s
as HELL-- but there s just too many of them-- one SLASHES his 
RIBCAGE!  Blood!  Then another Soldier makes contact!

 a BULL encircled by seven Miles FIGHTS-- but he s
bullfighters.  And we know how that ll end.  That is, until--  

CHARLIE
Hey!  

One SOLDIER spins-- just as CHARLIE UNLOADS her CROSSBOW 
directly into his chest!  He drops!  

Miles.  Shocked.  And can t deny-- a little relieved-- THEN--60.


AARON
Over here!

Aaron.  Unarmed.  FUCKING TERRIFIED.  

Two SOLDIERS CHASE Charlie-- into the MAZE of tall, heavy 
INDUSTRIAL RACKS-- another Soldier CHARGES AARON-- he RUNS 
into the saloon--

Leaving Miles with the Sergeant and THREE OTHERS-- a 
MANAGEABLE NUMBER for Miles-- he efficiently punches a few 
 TICKETS-- leaving just Miles.  And the Sergeant.  And guys 
the SHIT IS ON.  


The Soldier bursts into the saloon.  Aaron just stands there. 

AARON
I, um.  Sorry.

As Maggie suddenly ATTACKS the Soldier from behind-- slitting 
his throat before he ever knew what hit him--


MILES.  CLINKING-- CLANKING-- CLANGING SWORDS with the 
 ASTOUNDING.Sergeant!  Both evenly matched.  It s

ANGLE ON: A SOLDIER.  He s hunting Charlie.  Through the tall 
racks.  Beat.  When he rounds a corner--

And she s right there!  FIRES!  Arrow THWACKS!  Direct hit!  

But then-- another Soldier-- TIPS a HEAVY RACK, right on top 
of her-- Charlie SCRAMBLES, but it catches her LEG!  OUCH!  
She PINNED.  Trapped--  

This Soldier steps to her.  Murder in his expression.  
Charlie is most definitely DEAD MEAT.  When suddenly--

Nate is there!  Gripping that BASEBALL BAT.  Takes a Babe 
 head!  The Ruth swing across the back of the Soldier s
Soldier crumples to the floor.

Nate.  Charlie.  A VERY LONG beat.  They lock eyes.  There s 
SO GODDAM MUCH he wants to tell her.  But--

MAGGIE
Charlie!

Maggie and Aaron race up to Charlie.  She looks to them.  And 
when she turns back... NATE IS GONE.61.


MAGGIE
You okay?  

Charlie.  Bewildered.  And conflicted.  And let s be honest-- 
a little tingly.  As Maggie and Aaron LIFT UP the rack--

MILES.  Still battling the Sergeant.  Desperately.  To the 
death.  Until-- after a few beats of the COOLEST FUCKING

Miles turns to Charlie, Maggie, and Aaron, just as they

He picks up a CRACKED vinyl LP.  Forlorn.

and light-- and we catch up--  

CHARLIE
Sounds good.

MILES
Okay.  Let s go get your brother--


DANNY.  Re-cuffed.  Captain Neville beside him.  As the wagon 
rolls down the interstate.  Through a now-abandoned, now-
pointless TOLL GATE.  On its way to Monroe...  


Finally-- GRACE.  Holds that PHOTO of her SON.  Guilt-ridden.  
Then-- she moves to that LOCKED HALLWAY DOOR.  The one Danny 
noticed.  She UNLOCKS the four different locks, with four 
different keys.  Then enters--


Small.  Simple.  Just a rough-hewn desk and chair.  But it s 
 ON the table-- a BARE BULB ELECTRIC LAMP.  Which-- what s
HOLY SHIT-- GRACE CLICKS ON!

And a HOMEMADE COMPUTER.  Bulky.  A spiderweb of wires.  A 
green phosphorous monitor.  And a BLINKING CURSOR .  It s
OPERATIONAL.  We HEAR that old school MODEM WHINE.  

As Grace sits before it, we notice for the first time-- she 
wears a silver pendant necklace around her neck.  Just like 
  The FLASHDRIVE NECKLACE.  Ben s.

CLOSE ON MONITOR.  She types:  THE MILITIA WAS HERE. 

Beat... then someone on the other end responds!  Flickering 
green words on the screen:  DID THEY FIND IT? 

Grace types:  NO. 

Another beat.  Then... from the other end: 

 SO... WHAT NOW?   

CLOSE ON GRACE.  She leans back in her chair.  Troubled.  
Contemplating the question.  

As do we.  What does it all mean?  Off Grace.  Off this 
mystery.  Off this IMPOSSIBLE piece of technology, we--

BLACKOUT.
