                         It s Different for Girls 


                                      TEASER

  EXT./INT. DILLON HIGH - MORNING

  Over the circus of high school STUDENTS arriving by bus, car, 
  bike and foot, WE HEAR SAMMY MEADE broadcast...

                              SAMMY MEADE (V.O.)
                ...and what a night-day 
                  doubleheader Dillon has this 
                weekend!  First, Friday Night, the 
                football Panthers look to sharpen 
                their claws against the hapless 
                Ramapo Rams - the worst team in the 
                  division.  

    A SKATEBOARDER ramps into the school entrance, down the 
  crowded hallway, whizzes by a teacher carrying coffee, races 
  the length of the hallway and out...

  THE BACK OF THE SCHOOL

  THE SKATEBOARDER rolls down a ramp, gathers momentum, then 
  LAUNCHES --

  CLOSE ON the skateboarder, AIRBORNE...  He lands 
    successfully.  He coasts toward...

  THE FOOTBALL FIELD

  The team is running a blocking drill: two lines, lead player 
  in each line faces off, driving into the other with all 
  they ve got at the whistle.  

                              SAMMY MEADE (V.O)
                I tell you, the only way the 
                Panthers lose this game is by 
                beating themselves.  But one 
                massacre won t be enough for 
                Dillon.  Not this weekend.  

  PULL FOCUS to CHEERLEADERS practicing on the sideline.  

                              SAMMY MEADE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                The Southwest Cheerleading 
                  Regionals start this Saturday, and 
                the young Panther Squad, led by 
                                (MORE)


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      2.

                captain Lyla Garrity, is hunting 
                for victory.  Hell, these ladies 
                feel confident about winning.  And 
                let Sammy give y all a bit of 
                advice: don t bet against these 
                  Panthers,  cause these little 
                ladies are tough...

  Sammy s broadcast continues over...

  INT. FIELD HOUSE - GIRLS LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

  LYLA GARRITY, in gym shorts and a T-shirt, stands over a 
  sink.  Her eyes are red; she chokes back sobs.  Lyla pulls 
  paper towel after paper towel out of the dispenser, then runs 
  water over the towels.

                              SAMMY MEADE (V.O.)
                These little ladies are easy on the 
                eyes, too.  Which not only helps 
                the football player giving it his 
                all on the field, but also helps 
                put asses in the seats.

  MOVE WITH LYLA as she carries the towels to...

  HER LOCKER.  WHORE is scrawled across in lipstick.  Lyla 
  scrubs the locker clean.  She stops, the word no longer 
  visible.  The sting of it, however, is still there.  OFF 
  LYLA, as she resumes scrubbing --

  INT. DILLON HIGH - GYMNASIUM - DAY

  A giant AMERICAN FLAG draped across one wall provides a 
  backdrop as the CHEERLEADING SQUAD practices.  But this is no 
  rah-rah pom-poms bullshit.  These girls are synchronized 
  gymnasts, and they whip across the gym, doing backflips and 
    corkscrews as they practice their routine.  The girls are all 
  business, with no make-up and sweating like jocks.  

  PICK UP Lyla as she enters the gym.  The squad stops.  Lyla 
  glares.  WE HEAR some giggles.

                              KENNEDY
                        (taunting)
                Lyla Garrity, she s the best, every 
                guy wants to touch her chest.

                              BRITTANY
                Panthers roar, Panthers soar, but 
                Panther cheerleaders ain t no 
                whore.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      3.

    CONTINUED:


  A WHISTLE BLOWS.  MISS DER, the cheerleading coach (35), a 
  former Miss Texas blonde bomb who is driven to win and cold 
  as ice, marches to the front of the gym.  

                              MISS DER
                Cut the bullshit!  The tournament 
                starts this Saturday, and we ve 
                been working for too long to screw 
                up now.  I need you serious, I need 
                you focused.  I need you committed 
                to winning - I for one don t want 
                to take home a silver medal.
                        (smiles)
                I like gold.

  The squad echoes the sentiment. 

                              MISS DER (CONT D)
                And Lyla - I need you here on time.  

  Lyla wants to explain, but Miss Der raises her hand --

                              MISS DER (CONT D)
                I don t want to hear it.  Okay 
                  everyone, let s run it again.  And 
                use the music to keep your beat.

  Miss Der cranks up THEME MUSIC.  The squad tumbles, an 
  acrobatic display.  Lyla backflips across the floor, then 
  VAULTS into the hands of BRITTANY (her supporting base), as 
  the squad forms a pyramid.  

  ON LYLA, arms raised, the pinnacle of the pyramid.  But as we 
  MOVE CLOSE ON LYLA, it s clear her mind is elsewhere.  Lyla 
  loses her balance, FALLS...

  Lands heavily on top of Brittany.  Brittany pushes her off.

                              BRITTANY
                Great.  I guess Tim Riggins banged 
                the balance right on out of you.

  OFF Lyla sprawled on the floor, a blank expression masking 
  her misery...

  INT./EXT. CADILLAC - HIGH NOON 

  CLOSE ON JASON STREET, his blank expression similar to 
  Lyla s.  Sun shines on his face and wind whips through his 
  hair...




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      4.

    CONTINUED:


  REVEAL: a Cadillac racing across the Texas landscape.  
  There s a wheelchair strapped to the roof.

  ANGLE ON Jason, in the back.  Jason s hand is out the window, 
  buffeted by the wind.  CLOSE ON MITCHELL STREET S EYES, 
  watching from the rear view mirror.

                              MITCHELL STREET 
                Got a great deal customizing the 
                car, son.  It s amazing what they 
                can do.  We re going to fit it with 
                hand controls so you can drive.  

                              JASON
                Cool.

                                JOANNE STREET
                  Everything s going to be okay, 
                honey.  You re going home.

  FIND JOANNE STREET, in the passenger seat.  While Mrs. Street 
  is sincerely overjoyed, she s also anxious about the future - 
  and no smile painted on her face can hide this.  Jason smiles 
  back, but then his smile fades as his eyes are drawn to...

  THE HANDICAPPED PLACARD hanging from the rear view mirror.  

                                                                      SMASH TO:

  EXT. STREET HOUSE - DAY

  Mr. Street unloads Jason from the Cadillac, but Jason insists 
  on wheeling himself up the homemade ramp.

                                JOANNE STREET
                Your dad made those ramps. 

                              JASON
                Good job, dad.  

                              MITCHELL STREET
                We converted the living room into 
                your new room.  You ve got your own 
                bathroom and your own entrance.

  Mrs. Street opens the door.  Jason wheels inside - but gets 
  stuck on the lip.  He struggles.  Mrs. Street motions Mr. 
  Street to help, but Jason shakes him off.

                              JASON
                  I...got...it...




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      5.

    CONTINUED:


  Jason gets over the lip!  OFF this triumphant moment...

  INT. STREET HOUSE - JASON S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

  Jason enters.  The room is filled with trophies and pictures 
  and newspaper articles, relics from glory past.

                              MITCHELL STREET
                Welcome home, son.

  His father hugs him; it s awkward because of the wheelchair.  
  Jason smiles weakly.  Welcome home indeed.

                                JOANNE STREET
                Are you hungry, Jason?  Want lunch?

                              JASON
                I m fine, mom.  Just tired.  You 
                guys mind if I lie down?

                                JOANNE STREET
                Not at all.

                              MITCHELL STREET
                You need a hand? 

                              JASON
                Legs, dad.  I need legs.
                      (beat)
                It s a joke.  Seriously, I m fine.

  The Streets exit, a little too eagerly.  The door shuts and 
  Jason sits alone, surrounded by his history.  He picks up a 
  photo of Lyla and himself.  Stares.  Tears well up, but he 
  forces them back.  Puts the picture in a drawer and closes 
  it.  OFF this...

  EXT. DILLON HIGH - MAIN ENTRANCE - DAY

  SMASH, surrounded by Smashettes, holds court.  

                              SMASH
                Embrace the game.  Breathe it, live 
                it, eat it, think it, see it.  At 
                all times, in all ways.  Football 
                is life.  And I m setting records 
                Friday Night, you can t contain my 
                desire.  Just give me the ball...

  Smash stops mid-sentence as WAVERLY GRADY (17) walks by.  
  There s something sophisticated about her that sets her 




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      6.

  apart.  Plus, she s drop dead beautiful.  Smash FOLLOWS  
  Waverly -- 

                                SMASHETTE
                Hey, Smash!  Where you going?

  STAY WITH SMASH, a lion stalking his prey. 

                              SMASH
                Excuse me, Miss?  I do not believe 
                I have the privilege of knowing 
                you.  If you d like, I ll escort 
                you to wherever you re going, give 
                us a chance to exchange 
                  formalities...  

  Waverly rolls her eyes, keeps walking.

                              SMASH (CONT D)
                I ve got almost thirty minutes till 
                  practice.  Football practice?

  No response.  Smash flashes his million dollar smile.

                              SMASH (CONT D)
                You do know who I am?  Smash 
                  Williams, star running back.  
                Destined for USC, for the Heisman, 
                for the NFL, and for the Hall of 
                Fame.  

  None of this impresses Waverly.  Smash keeps following.

                              SMASH (CONT D)
                Now don t be shy, girl.  I know I 
                just laid a lot of intimidating 
                info on you, but deep down, Smash 
                is humble.  It just happens to be 
                your lucky day that Smash s eyes 
                have locked on you. 

  A BLACK LINCOLN CONTINENTAL pulls up.  Waverly waves at the 
  driver, who is concealed behind tinted windows.

                              WAVERLY
                I ve got a ride.  But, thanks.

  The tinted window of the Lincoln rolls down.  REVEAL REVEREND 
  GRADY in the driver s seat.  

  ON SMASH, suddenly recognizing Waverly.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      7.

                              SMASH
                Waverly?  Waverly Grady?

                              REVEREND GRADY
                Hi, Brian.  Ready for Friday s 
                game?

  Smash nods, but the game is the furthest thing from his mind.

                              REVEREND GRADY (CONT D)
                You remember Waverly?

                              WAVERLY
                He does now.

  Waverly winks, gets in the car.  The Lincoln pulls away.   

  OFF Smash, like he just got stung by Muhammad Ali.

                                                                      SMASH TO:

  EXT. TAYLOR S CAR - MORNING

  The Taylors commute to school.

                              TAMI (O.S.)
                It bothers you.

                                TAYLOR (O.S.)
                It does not bother me.

                              TAMI (O.S.)
                Come on, admit it.  A co-pep rally?  
                The football team sharing the show?

  INT. TAYLOR S CAR - CONTINUOUS

  Coach drives, Tami next to him, and Julie in the back.

                                TAYLOR
                I think sharing the stage with the 
                  cheerleaders is good.  Those girls 
                work hard; they deserve it.  

                              TAMI
                Doesn t their tournament take the 
                focus off the football game?  Isn t 
                that dangerous to the team?

  Tami s pushing his buttons, and Coach knows it.

                                TAYLOR
                Hell, I plan to channel the energy 
                those girls put into my players and 
                use it Friday Night.  

                              TAMI
                        (whispers)
                Like you use to channel my energy?  

                                TAYLOR
                Exactly.

  Tami kisses Coach.  Long and sexy.

                              JULIE
                Hey!  The road!!

                                TAYLOR
                I m watching!  Anyway, I love the 
                idea of a co-pep rally.

                You want my thoughts on 
                  cheerleading?

  Coach doesn t, but knows he s going to hear it.

                              JULIE (CONT D)
                It s even more pointless than 
                  football.

                              TAMI
                Careful.  Football pays our bills.

                                TAYLOR
                Amen, sister.

                              JULIE
                Okay, I concede that.  I even 
                concede that football has a purpose 
                in terms of entertainment, though 
                for the life of me, I don t know 
                why.  But cheerleading?  Cheering 
                for others to entertain?

                                TAYLOR
                This is Texas cheerleading, and 
                those girls are tough.  Real jocks.  

                              JULIE
                Then why don t the girls get paid 
                like jocks?  Do you know a Dallas 
                Cowboy Cheerleader makes fifty 
                dollars a game while the average 
                NFL player makes forty thousand per 
                game.  Cheerleading is sexist, dad.  
                Girls jumping up and down in short 
                skirts waving pom-poms, singing 
                silly ditties.  And why?  Are girls 
                hard wired to put on short skirts 
                and cheer for men?

                                TAYLOR
                      (a long beat, then)
                Are you, uh, planning something?  I 
                mean, like, shaving your head and 
                moving to New York?  I m just 
                asking.

  INT. GARRITY HOUSE - MORNING

  Lyla, draped in an oversized flannel shirt, is at the 
  breakfast table.  



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      10.

    CONTINUED:


                              LYLA
                I don t feel well.  I swear it.

  PAM GARRITY absentmindedly feels Lyla s forehead.  No fever.

                              PAM 
                You re fine.

  ON Lyla, she doesn t have the strength to argue.  PICK UP 
  BUDDY GARRITY as he enters, pours himself coffee.

                              BUDDY
                Don t worry, this will all blow 
                over.  Those kids will have 
                  something better to talk about.  

  BACK TO Lyla, even more worried at the mention of other kids.

                              BUDDY (CONT D)
                There s no quit in Lyla Garrity.  
                No matter what comes at you, you 
                keep going.  That s my baby.  Now 
                get dressed.  Practice, remember?  
                Got to get that W for the squad on 
                  Saturday.  This is your moment in 
                the sun.  You deserve this.

  OFF Lyla, buoyed by her father s words...

  INT. STREET HOUSE - JASON S ROOM - MORNING

  Jason struggles to put his pants on, literally lifting his 
  limbs and pushing them into his pants.  He s breathing 
  heavily.  But then his breathing quiets as HE HEARS... 

                                JOANNE STREET (O.S.)
                We have talked about this.  I don t 
                want to rehash what we ve already 
                settled.

                              MITCHELL STREET (O.S.)
                What we ve settled and what you 
                think we ve settled are two 
                  different things.

                                JOANNE STREET (O.S.)
                        (getting louder)
                Not now, Mitchell.  NOT NOW!

  ON JASON, quickly lifting himself into his chair.  PRELAP the 
  sizzle of Bacon...                                                                                      11.



  INT. STREET HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

  START ON bacon sizzling in a pan.  PICK UP Jason, wheeling to 
  the table.  FIND Mr. Street reading a newspaper.  He smiles.

                              MITCHELL STREET
                   Morning, son.

  Jason winks.  Fixes a fork to his hand so he can eat.  Mrs. 
  Street serves Jason a plate of bacon and eggs.

                                JOANNE STREET
                I bet you missed homemade cooking.

                              JASON
                I sure did.  Thanks, mom.

  ANGLE ON his father, peering over the paper, watching Jason 
  eat.

                                JOANNE STREET
                Uh, Jason, a lawyer s coming by 
                tonight.  Just to talk. 

  Mr. Street puts down the paper, clearly exasperated.  

                              JASON
                You and dad don t seem on the same 
                page about this.

                                JOANNE STREET
                There is no page yet.  This is all 
                about options.  Your father and I 
                are on the same page that we ll 
                spare no expense when it comes to 
                making you better.  Am I right, 
                  Mitchell?

  Mr. Street nods.

                              JASON
                Alright, mom.  We ll talk to the 
                lawyer.  

  He bites his bacon.  Mr. Street reads his paper.  Mrs. Street 
  sips her cup of coffee.  OFF this  Ordinary People  moment...

  INT. FIELD HOUSE - WEIGHT ROOM - DAY

  The FOOTBALL TEAM pumps iron, young studs in cutoff T s with 
  ripped chests and iron-board stomachs.  MATT SARACEN and 
  Smash sit on bench presses, but neither is lifting.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      12.

                              SMASH
                Don t you watch TV?

                              SARACEN
                I watch TV.

                              SMASH
                Well you re watching the wrong TV.  
                Man, I thought you were gonna eat 
                Julie s whole head, the way you 
                kissed her.  Gotta be smoother then 
                that.  Smooth like the Smash.

                              SARACEN
                That a fact?

                              SMASH
                Watch and learn.  I just met this 
                bangin  shorty, and I guarantee 
                I ll hit that  fore you cop a feel 
                off Julie Taylor.

                              DOLIA
                You saying you ll score on Waverly 
                Grady before Saracen gets second on 
                Julie Taylor?

                              SMASH
                That s what I m saying.

                              PUDNICK
                I don t know, Smash.  Waverly was 
                studying in Ghana for a year.  
                She s real smart, and she don t 
                give a damn about football.  You 
                might be overreaching.

                              SMASH
                  Nothing s out of reach to the 
                Smash.  I m one size fits all.   

                              DOLIA
                You ain t scoring on the Reverend s 
                  daughter.  I ll bet Saracen gets 
                second on Julie Taylor before you 
                score.

                              PUDNICK
                Julie Taylor is hot.  I d do her.

                              SMASH
                We all would.  You ve got a deal. 



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      13.

  LAUGHTER.  Suddenly, silence --

  REVEAL COACH TAYLOR, standing in the room. 

                              SMASH (CONT D)
                Hey... Coach.

  A long beat as Taylor s glare burns a hole.  

                                TAYLOR
                You girls lifting or chatting?

                              SARACEN
                We re lifting, sir.

  ANGLE ON Matt, pumping.  ANGLE ON Smash, doing the same.  

                                TAYLOR
                        (addressing the team)
                It would be a mistake to take a 
                vacation mentality to Friday 
                Night s game.  It s not just that 
                we might lose, but that we might 
                not win.  We have a chance here for 
                more than a W.  We have a chance to 
                  establish ourselves, to build a 
                  reputation.  To put fear into 
                future opponents.  Do not 
                  underestimate the power of fear.  

  Coach places his hands on Smash and Saracen s barbells.  

                                TAYLOR (CONT D)
                  Reputation plus intimidation equals 
                victory.  I want us to go all out 
                this Friday.  No let up.  This is a 
                chance to shine.  I want us to 
                shine.

  He gently pushes down on the barbells, creating resistance.  
  Smash and Saracen struggle...

                                TAYLOR (CONT D)
                Dig deep.  Focus on the game.  
                Focus only on this game.

  He pushes down harder - Smash and Saracen can no longer lift 
  and can barely keep the dumbbells from crushing them.  

  Coach walks away.  OFF Smash and Saracen, happy to be alive --                                                                                      14.



  INT. DILLON HIGH - HALLWAY - DAY

  Saracen is talking to Julie at her locker, or trying to, and 
  Julie is trying not to look excited.  But she really is.

                              SARACEN
                So, I was, you know - I didn t know 
                where I was.  Not that I didn t 
                know, but I forgot.  I was excited, 
                and just wanted to kiss you.  

                              JULIE
                You didn t realize you were in a 
                stadium filled with fifteen 
                thousand people?  Including my 
                father?

                              SARACEN
                Not at that moment.  I m sorry.  I, 
                uh, I won t do it again.  Okay?

                              JULIE
                Sure.

                              SARACEN
                But, that wasn t, I didn t come 
                here to apologize.  Not that I m 
                not sorry--

                              JULIE
                I get it.  Come on, cut to the 
                chase.

                              SARACEN
                Do you want to go out?  With me?  
                Tomorrow night?  We can--

                              JULIE
                Yes.

                              SARACEN
                What?

                              JULIE
                I said yes.

                              SARACEN
                You said yes?

                              JULIE
                Oh, brother.  We ve got to start 
                  communicating better. 



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      15.

  OFF Matt, praying for help...

  EXT. WOODS - DAY

  TIM RIGGINS pushes Jason down a dirt path.  Lyla walks 
    alongside.  Everyone is laughing.  Suddenly, Jason STEPS OUT 
  of the chair.  A beat as everyone stares, then Jason WALKS 
  down the path, the smile on his face widening, then Jason 
  RUNS, faster and faster, full of joy --

  He FALLS into mud.  Struggles to get out, but the mud is 
    quicksand, and Jason s legs are stuck.  He looks to Tim and 
  Lyla for help, but they walk away.  Jason struggles with 
    everything he s got, but his legs can t move and he slowly 
  sinks down, deeper and deeper.  Finally, his head goes under 
  and he can t breathe...

                                                                          CUT TO:

  INT. STREET HOUSE - JASON S ROOM - DAY

  Jason wakes with a GASP.  Takes several deep breaths until he 
  realizes he was dreaming.  Until he realizes that he s still 
    paralyzed.

  ANGLE ON Jason getting into his wheelchair.  Rolls around his 
  room, bored.  Peeks into his bathroom...

  CLOSE ON the metallic shower seat in his stall.  Shiny and 
  cold.  OFF Jason, realizing that what was once normal, will 
  never be normal again.  

  EXT. DILLON - DAY

  The cheerleading squad jogs through town, Lyla Garrity at the 
  head.  Townspeople stop in their tracks - these girls are not 
  a bad sight.

  The girls jog to a park, and start doing sit-ups.  FIND 
  Kennedy, whispering loudly to Brittany.

                              KENNEDY
                I m not judging Lyla, I ve been 
                friends with her since forever.  
                But getting banged by Tim Riggins 
                could be more then she can handle.  
                Could throw off her whole game.  
                With the tournament this Saturday, 
                that s too risky.  We have to win.

  FIND Lyla, about to kill.  MARIA laughs.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      16.

                Tim Riggins made a play for her.

                              KENNEDY
                Make a play for this, bitch.

  ON Lyla, feeling even worse.  Maria resumes jogging.  

                              MARIA
                Come on Lyla, you know you re bank.  
                Work out the anger.  Let s use that 
                nasty energy to win the tournament. 

  Most of the girls agree, and they all start jogging down the 
  path.  Except Lyla.  She jogs in another direction.

                              LYLA
                You girls go.  I ll see you later.

  STAY WITH LYLA as she jogs away.  CONTINUE WITH HER as she 
  runs past Dillon Elementary.  GRADE SCHOOL CHEERLEADERS 
  practice in front of the school.  The young girls recognize 
  Lyla and wave, as if a celebrity is passing.  A couple of 
  teachers, however, look at Lyla with judgement.  Or do they?  
  OFF Lyla, unsure...

  EXT. STREET HOUSE - DAY

  Jason is in his driveway, spinning in his wheelchair.

                                GEORGE (O.S.)
                Jason?  Hey Jason, you re home!

  GEORGE DUNN, Jason s next door neighbor, walks over.  Shakes 
  Jason s hand, though Jason struggles with returning the grip.  
  MRS. DUNN and NICK, their six-year-old son, hurry over as 
  well.  Mrs. Dunn hugs Jason.

                              MRS. DUNN
                Welcome home.

                              JASON
                Thanks, Mrs. Dunn.

                              MRS. DUNN
                You look good.  Doesn t he, George, 
                doesn t Jason look good?

                                GEORGE DUNN
                He does.  You do, Jason.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      17.

    CONTINUED:


  The Dunns mean it, and Jason takes it the right way.  ANGLE 
  ON Nick, sitting on a tricycle, staring at Jason.

                              NICK DUNN
                Can you walk?

  ON Nick s parents, very uncomfortable.

                              JASON
                No, I can t.  But I bet I can go 
                faster than you.

  Jason spins his chair, motions toward Nick s tricycle. 

                              NICK DUNN
                Bet you can t.

                                                                  TIME CUT TO:

  BOTTOM OF THE DRIVEWAY

  ANGLE ON little Nick in his tricycle racing Jason Street in 
  his wheelchair.  Up the length of the driveway... Nick wins!

                              NICK DUNN
                Yay!

  ANGLE ON Jason, laughing, spinning his chair.  He stops --

  REVEAL Lyla at the bottom of the driveway.  

  No one says a word.  Mr. Dunn gathers his family and walks 
  away.  Jason still hasn t moved.  Neither has Lyla.  Finally 
  she opens her mouth, but nothing comes out.  She tries 
  again...

                              LYLA
                I... I...

  But it s too late.  Jason spins around and enters his room.  
  Closes the door.  OFF Lyla, totally rejected...


                                END OF ACT ONE                                                                                      18.


                                    ACT TWO

  INT. DILLON HIGH - ENGLISH CLASS - DAY

  The class is divided between boys and girls.  JUDITH LEVINE 
  stands in the middle.

                                JUDITH
                Brian, you re on.  Monogamy in 
                  literature?

  ANGLE ON Smash, as he slowly stands.  It s clear that 
  whatever assignment was given, he didn t do.

                              SMASH
                I don t know about literature, but 
                I do know monogamy is bullshit.  
                It s man-made.  Actually, it s 
                  woman-made.

  The class LAUGHS.  FIND Waverly, slightly amused.

                                JUDITH
                Monogamy has been a theme in 
                  literature throughout history.  
                Homer s Iliad - today s assignment - 
                is an example, recounting the 
                  consequences of Helen s adultery.  
                But note Homer s double standard in 
                how Ulysses was easily forgiven for 
                dallying Circe in The Odyssey.  

                              SMASH
                That s  cause men can be with more 
                than one woman, but women should be 
                with only one man.

                                JUDITH
                Explain.

                              SMASH
                It s about the seed and the egg.  
                The flower and the bee.  The man s 
                job is to spread the pollen.  The 
                girl s is to grow it.  Now, can t 
                be growing more than one at a time, 
                can you?

                              AARON
                What the hell are you saying?





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      19.

    CONTINUED:


                              WAVERLY
                I think Smash is saying that 
                monogamy is not natural.  That the 
                male of any species is hard wired 
                for genetic diversity, thus 
                assuring his dominance in the 
                future.  

                              SMASH
                Exactly.  

                              WAVERLY
                It s rare to find monogamy in 
                nature, especially among mammals.  
                Beavers, otters, bats, some 
                  primates, but for the most part, 
                monogamy is not natural.  The male 
                instinct is to fertilize as many 
                eggs as possible.

                              SMASH
                I knew I liked you.

                              WAVERLY
                But that s what makes humans 
                  different.  Freud argues in 
                   Civilization and its Discontents  
                that civilization is founded on the 
                  repression of instincts.  I would 
                add that we re never so human as 
                when we act contrary to our 
                  instinct, and that monogamy - with 
                the right person, is a state of 
                higher evolution. 

  You can hear a pin drop.  AARON crosses to the girls  side.

                              AARON
                I m with the new chick.

  He sits down amidst LAUGHTER.  ANGLE ON Smash, his eyes 
  lazored on Waverly.  The BELL RINGS. 

  INT. DILLON HIGH - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

  Smash motors down the hall, avoiding students like he does 
  tacklers.  Finally, he catches up to -- WAVERLY.

                              SMASH
                Hey!

  Waverly stops.  Waits.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      20.

                              SMASH (CONT D)
                That was good in class.  Sharp.

                              WAVERLY
                Thanks.

                              SMASH
                So how about we hang after school?  
                Just you and me, some deep 
                  conversation, know what I m saying?

                              WAVERLY
                I do.  But I ll pass.

  She starts back down the hall.

                              SMASH
                Pass?  Pass on the Smash?

  Smash feigns indignity, but his usual charm ain t working.  
  Waverly keeps walking.

                              SMASH (CONT D)
                I don t give up, baby.  I don t 
                quit.  Embrace the Smash!

  Smash FOLLOWS HER THROUGH A DOOR.  We HEAR A SCREAM, then 
  Smash jumps back out.  OFF Smash, realizing he just followed 
  Waverly into the girl s room...

  INT. DILLON HIGH - CAFETERIA - DAY

  LANDRY stands behind TYRA in the food line.  Staring.

                              TYRA
                What are you looking at?

                                LANDRY
                Uh.  You.

                              TYRA
                And why are you looking at me?

  OFF Landry, debating whether to tell her his fantasy...

  FIND Lyla, sitting by herself, pretending to read a magazine, 
  trying to block out the leper stares she s getting from the 
  other students.  Suddenly, TWO BOYS sit with her.

                              LYLA
                Oh, God!  You guys scared me.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      21.

                We did?  Wow, I guess that s a 
                  compliment.  I mean, the word is 
                that Lyla Garrity is not easy to 
                scare.  What we re saying is, we 
                think what you did - sleeping with 
                both Jason and Tim - was bold.  
                Forging new boundaries.

                              BOY #2
                We re here to see if you want to 
                keep forging new boundaries.  With 
                us.  All together.  

  ON these boys, so full of themselves; this is the funniest 
  thing they ve ever heard.  

  BACK TO Lyla, fighting tears but refusing to cry in front of 
  these pricks.  A SHADOW looms over the table...

  TIM RIGGINS.  The cocky boys suddenly turn coward and leave.  
  Tim sits in their place.

                              RIGGINS
                What was that about?

  Lyla shakes her head.  Chokes back a sob.  Tim reaches under 
  the table, tenderly takes her hand.  Gives a love squeeze.  

                              RIGGINS (CONT D)
                You want me to kick their asses?
                      (Lyla shakes her head)
                Kick someone else s ass?

  FIND TYRA, in line.  Watching Tim holding Lyla s hand.

  BACK TO Lyla and Tim.  Lyla realizes everyone in the 
  cafeteria is watching.  She pulls her hand away.

                              LYLA
                Leave me alone!  Can t you see that 
                us talking makes it worse?

                              RIGGINS
                Why?

                              LYLA
                 Cause everyone sees.  Everyone 
                thinks.  And then Jason hears, and, 
                you know, I can take all the shit 
                the students and the town can dish 
                                (MORE)

                me.  Don t you get it?

                              RIGGINS
                Who cares about what everyone sees? 
                This is about us.

                              LYLA
                There is no us!  There never was!!  
                Get this straight Tim - we were a 
                one night stand.  A mistake.  I 
                love Jason.

  OFF Tim, like he was punched in the gut...

                        (dangles the keys)
                I put the keys on a Garrity Motors

  CLOSE ON the floormats, Garrity Motors emblazoned across.

  But Ben s face is serious.

                              BEN
                I came to apologize.  Alice and I 
                are punishing Brittany for what she 
                did to Lyla.

  Buddy has no idea what Ben s talking about.  

                              BEN (CONT D)
                  I thought you knew.  Brittany put 
                  something nasty on Myspace.  Other 
                kids then added to it, but Brittany 
                started it.  Hell Buddy, I don t 
                even know what Myspace is, but I 
                can assure you, it won t happen 
                again.  I just wanted to apologize 
                in person.  Lyla doesn t deserve 
                this, no matter what she did.

  OFF Buddy, No matter what she did echoing in his head...

  INT. GARRITY MOTORS - BUDDY S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

  Buddy stares at Lyla s Myspace page.  A PICTURE of Lyla

  Lyla walks toward the gymnasium.  Tyra intercepts her.

                              TYRA
                Damn you, Lyla!

  Lyla stops, dreading this confrontation.  Tyra s fists are

                              TYRA (CONT D)
                You know, you... you...

  Tears suddenly well in Tyra s eyes.  Tyra, shocked and 
    embarrassed, quickly turns and leaves.  OFF Lyla, feeling 
  even worse than if Tyra had ripped into her...

                                                                          CUT TO:                                                                                      24.



  INT. DILLON HIGH - GYMNASIUM - DAY

  Lyla s alone in the gym, practicing backflips.  Backflip 
  after backflip after backflip.  Trying to numb the pain.

  INT. FIELD HOUSE - GIRLS LOCKER ROOM - DAY

  CLOSE ON ice packs wrapped around Lyla s knees.  REVEAL Lyla, 
  in her underwear and bra.  Completely worn out.  Maria walks 
  over, wrapped in a towel.  

                               MARIA
                Miss Der wants to see you.

  INT. FIELD HOUSE - MISS DER S OFFICE - DAY

  Miss Der is viewing film of the squad s routine.  PICK UP 
  Lyla, entering.  Miss Der FREEZES the film.

                              MISS DER
                Look Lyla, this is difficult for 
                me.  I know how hard you ve worked 
                to get to this moment.  I know 
                you ve choreographed the squad s 
                routine, I know you ve spent 
                summers practicing, I know you ve 
                dreamt about this since you were a 
                little girl.  I also know how good 
                you are.  That s why I made you 
                captain.  But Lyla, you have to 
                think like a captain.  And that 
                means thinking of the team first.

                              LYLA
                What are you saying?

                              MISS DER
                I want you to consider stepping 
                down.  At least for this Saturday.  

                              LYLA
                Oh my God.  Is this because of what 
                I did with Tim?

                              MISS DER
                  I couldn t care less about that.  
                This is about winning, and the 
                health of your team.  Your focus is 
                for shit, Lyla, and that means 
                you re dangerous.  You know how 
                many girls get seriously hurt in 
                                (MORE)

                our sport.  It s almost as bad as 
                  football.  

                              LYLA
                I can get focused.

                              MISS DER
                I don t think you can.  Not for 
                  Saturday.  So consider it.  And 
                consider it as a captain, with your 
                  responsibility to your team.

  Miss Der unfreezes the film.  OFF Lyla, reflected in the 
    footage...

  INT. TAYLOR HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 

  Coach reviews FILM FOOTAGE.  Tami cleans up.

                              TAMI
                Yeah, yeah, oh sure Eric, just sit 
                there while I tidy up.  Here, don t 
                move, let me lift your feet, get 
                you more comfortable.

  She lifts his feet onto a stool. 

                                TAYLOR
                Thanks.

  His eyes stay riveted on the screen.  Julie ENTERS.

                              JULIE
                I m going out tomorrow night.

                              TAMI
                Okay.  What are you doing?

                              JULIE
                Matt Saracen asked me out.

  Suddenly Coach sits up.  Turns off the TV.

                                TAYLOR
                What?  Saracen asked you out again?

                              JULIE
                Relax dad, you know how I feel 
                about football players.

                                TAYLOR
                Then why are you going out with 
                him?
                      (Julie rolls her eyes)
                I... I had plans.  Really, I was 
                planning on cooking dinner 
                  tomorrow.

                              JULIE
                Give me a break.

                                TAYLOR
                I was.  Or I am now.  Bring Saracen 
                here.

                              JULIE
                No way!

                                TAYLOR
                Yes way.  If you re going to date 
                this guy, have him come over and do 
                it proper.  That s what I did with 
                your mother.

                              TAMI
                It was very romantic.

                              JULIE
                It s date death!  Come on guys.

                                TAYLOR
                We ll leave you alone after dinner, 
                honest.  

  ON Julie, begging her mother for help.

  INT. STREET HOUSE - NIGHT

  JASON S POV as he and his parents sit at the dining table.  
  Across from Jason is CHRIS SABLE, a lawyer. 



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      27.

    CONTINUED:


                              CHRIS SABLE
                Coach Taylor was your quarterback 
                coach in Pee Wee, correct?

  Jason nods.

                              CHRIS SABLE (CONT D)
                Coach Taylor is currently your 
                coach?

  Jason nods.

                              CHRIS SABLE (CONT D)
                And is it true that in the entire 
                time Coach Taylor has been your 
                coach, never once did he personally 
                instruct you on how to tackle?

                              JASON
                He was my quarterback coach.

                              CHRIS SABLE
                Just answer the question.  Please.  
                Did Coach Taylor ever instruct you 
                on how to tackle?

  Jason shakes his head.  He watches Sable jot notes.  

                              JASON
                This is about blaming Coach, isn t 
                it?  

                              CHRIS SABLE
                It s not about blaming anyone.  
                It s about winning a lawsuit.  

                              JASON
                      (to his parents)
                I can t believe it.  You want me to 
                blame Coach?  He s been like, like 
                family.  Dad?

                                JOANNE STREET
                Your dad and I have discussed this, 
                Jason.  We re united on this.

                              MITCHELL STREET
                We are not united.  Stop saying 
                we re united.  I think Jason s 
                right.  
                      (to Sable)
                You should probably go.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      28.

                Don t you dare!  This is not a 
                decision that just you make.  I 
                want to know where we re going to 
                get the money we need --

                              MITCHELL STREET
                Joanne!

                                JOANNE STREET
                I want to know!  Where will we get 
                the money to take care of Jason?!

                              MITCHELL STREET
                We ll get it.  But I m the head of 
                this household and I m using my 
                veto power.  Mr. Sable, you can go -

                              MITCHELL STREET
                Now, Mr. Sable.

  Sable rises.  He drops a card on the table.  

                              CHRIS SABLE
                Jason dedicated himself to Dillon, 
                and it s only fair that Dillon 
                shoulder its share of the economic 
                burden.  Unfortunately, sometimes 
                we need the law to make it fair.  

  Sable EXITS the house.  Mr. Street shuts the door.  

                                JOANNE STREET
                That s just great, he came highly 
                  recommended.  Good lawyers don t 
                grow on trees, you know. 

                              JASON
                Lawyers are snakes and 
                  bloodsuckers, mom.  We don t want

                Well, he s not going to, and we 
                have to take care of him.  His

                                  ACT THREE

  INT. DILLON HIGH - GYMNASIUM - MORNING

  Coach Taylor speaks to players, cheerleaders and students at 
  a CO-PEP RALLY.  Miss Der is off to his side. 

                                TAYLOR
                I know what football means to 
                Dillon, and I m here to tell you 
                that Dillon s support is a key to 
                why we re successful.  This support 
                binds us together as a community 
                and as a team.  So it s with that 
                spirit that I welcome the 
                  cheerleaders to this pep rally.  
                Support those who support you! 

  CHEERS from the audience.

                                TAYLOR (CONT D)
                And may I add that if sharing the 
                  spotlight means sharing the stage 
                with Miss Der, well then I don t 
                mind sharing the stage at all.

  WHOOPS and CATCALLS from the crowd.  Coach winks at Miss Der, 
  and laughs.  Suddenly, Coach stops laughing --

  ANGLE ON Julie, staring at him.  Coach turns away.  FIND 
  Tami, also staring at him.

                                TAYLOR (CONT D)
                      (to himself)
                Oh, brother.  Uh, Miss Der...

  He hands Miss Der the mic.  Coach slinks into the shadows.

                              MISS DER
                  Assertion is the key to success.  
                Demand what you deserve.  I know 
                the football team deserves victory 
                Friday night.  I know how hard 
                Coach Taylor works the players, how 
                hard the players work themselves.  
                I m here to tell you the 
                  cheerleading squad will demand 
                victory on Saturday as well.  A 
                victory that will lead to 
                  nationals! 

  CHEERS from the cheerleaders.

                Dillon High has never had dual 
                  championship teams before.  Dillon 
                High is about to!!

  The gym ROCKS OUT.  Drums beat, feet stomp.  Students dance.  
  Several football players deliver cookies to the cheerleaders, 
  a reverse kind of Rally Girl.  FIND Tim Riggins scanning the 
  crowd, looking for Lyla.  But she s not there.  

                                                                          CUT TO:

  INT. DILLON HIGH - HALLWAY - DAY

  Lyla walks down the hall.  A RELIGIOUS STUDENT remarks --

                              STUDENT
                How come you missed the rally?

                              LYLA
                Just didn t feel up to it.

                              STUDENT
                It s your guilt.  You re paying for 
                your sin.

                              TAMI (O.S.)
                You re gonna pay for your sin with 
                a foot up your ass.

  PICK UP Tami storming over, glaring.  The student leaves. 

                              LYLA
                When is this going to stop?

                              TAMI
                Don t worry about those jackasses, 
                sweetie.

  ON Lyla, it s clear that she is worrying.  Tami puts her arm 
  around her.  WE FOLLOW as they walk down the hall...

                Everyone makes mistakes.  As far as 
                feeling guilty and taking blame and 
                abuse - there comes a point you 
                just have to say screw  em.  No 
                matter what you did.  Get back to 
                living.

                The problem is I think maybe 
                everyone is right.  Maybe I am a 
                bad person.  I don t know how Jason 
                can ever forgive me.

                              TAMI
                You are not a bad person.  You made 
                  a mistake, period.  And if you want 
                Jason to forgive you, you have to 
                forgive yourself first.

                              LYLA
                But what I did is really sinful.  
                In a Biblical way.

                              TAMI
                Honey, God created sin so that we 
                might know her mercy. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

  INT. FIELD HOUSE - BATHROOM STALL - DAY

  TIGHT on a NEEDLE, a VIAL.  The needle is drawn, INJECTED...

  ANGLE ON Smash.  Getting good at this.

  EXT. HERRMANN FIELD - DAY

  The football team scrimmages, lined up over the ball on the 
  twenty yard-line, awaiting Coach s whistle.  

                                TAYLOR
                Dillon has never lost to the Rams.  
                We will not lose on Friday.  You 
                will dominate your opponent!  You 
                will hit hard, hit harder, then hit 
                even harder still.  That clear?  

                              THE TEAM
                Yes, sir!

  Coach WHISTLES.  Saracen barks the play.  The ball is 
  snapped, pads POP! and the linebackers BLITZ --

  Saracen ducks under them, rolls to his right.  Tosses a 
  teardrop pass to --

  SMASH.  The ball drops into Smash s hands and Smash makes for 
  the endzone without breaking stride.  A DEFENDER is down 
  field, and has a great angle on Smash...  



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      33.

    CONTINUED:


  WIDE as we FOLLOW THE FOOTRACE, but despite the angle, the 
  defender can t gain as Smash kicks it into an extra gear.  
  Smash crosses the 50, the 40, 30, 20 --

  The defender s angle finally intersects, but Smash easily 
    STIFF-ARMS him aside and skips into the endzone.  Spins the 
  ball on the ground and prances.

                              SMASH
                Who s the fastest?  Who is the 
                fastest?  Say hello to the Smash.

  ON THE SIDELINE

  MAC nods at Coach, impressed.  OFF Coach, saying nothing.  
  Just taking it all in...

  INT. WILLIAMS HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

    Pre-dinner prep.  Sauces sizzle, steam spews.  CORRINA is 
  chopping carrots.  Smash peeks into her gumbo.  

                              CORRINA
                What you looking at, boy?

                              SMASH
                Did you put those onions inside?  
                You know, those fancy ones.

                              CORRINA
                Vidalia onions?  Yeah, they re in.  
                You re acting strange, Brian.  And 
                I still don t understand why this 
                dinner had to happen all of a 
                sudden.

                              SMASH
                Just a little give back, mom.  The 
                  Reverend s been good to us, it s 
                our turn.  That s all.

  ON Corrina, she doesn t buy it.  SHEILA enters.

                                SHEILA
                It s his daughter.  Waverly.  She s 
                back at school.

                              SMASH
                It is not Waverly.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      34.

                              CORRINA
                Waverly.  Now that makes sense.  I 
                heard she was coming back.  Does 
                she interest you, Brian?

                              SMASH
                All girls interest me.

                              CORRINA
                Maybe.  But I don t often see you 
                chasing them.

                              SMASH
                The Smash don t chase.  They come 
                to me.

  Corrina swats Smash in the head.

                              SMASH (CONT D)
                Hey!  Uh, one more thing...

                              CORRINA
                Another ingredient I m missing?

                              SMASH
                Your blouse.  Could you change it?  
                Put on that blue one I like.

  OFF Corrina, threatening Smash with a serving spoon --

  The DOORBELL RINGS.  Smash opens the door.  REVEAL Reverend 
  Grady and Waverly.

                              REVEREND GRADY
                Hello, Brian.  Well hello, Corrina.

  The Reverend enters, hugs Corrina.  FIND Waverly in the 
  doorway, looking at Smash like he s pathetic.

                              WAVERLY
                Having your mother cook dinner.  
                That s low.

                              SMASH
                        (defensive)
                I cooked some, too.

                              WAVERLY
                Yeah, I bet.  Okay, score one for 
                you.  But it s early in the game.                                                                                      35.



  INT. WILLIAMS HOUSE - LATER

  The dining table is full of food.  

                              REVEREND GRADY
                  Everything tastes wonderful.  I m 
                very impressed, Corrina.

                              CORRINA
                Don t be.  If Brian had given me a 
                little more warning --

  FIND Smash, silently begging his mother.  Corrina LAUGHS.

                              CORRINA (CONT D)
                  Actually, when I heard Waverly was 
                back at school, it gave me the 
                excuse I was looking for.  

                              WAVERLY
                Thank you, Mrs. Williams.

                              CORRINA
                You re welcome.  And welcome home.  
                You were in Ghana, right?

                              WAVERLY
                That s right.

                              CORRINA
                With a missionary?

  Waverly nods uncomfortably.

                              WAVERLY
                  Purifying. 

                              REVEREND GRADY
                        (laughs)
                  Purifying water and building homes.  
                Real important work.  Say, Brian, 
                Waverly is going to take an SAT 
                course.  Maybe you could advise 
                her?

                              SMASH
                Uh.  Sure.  Love to.

                                SHEILA
                Didn t your course end last Friday?




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      36.

  He smiles at Sheila.  She sarcastically smiles back.

                              CORRINA
                Extra lessons can t hurt.  Playing 
                  football s not forever, but an 
                  education - that stays.

                              REVEREND GRADY
                Amen, sister.

                              SMASH
                  Football s staying for me, mom.

                              CORRINA
                I hope so.  But I ll be a very 
                proud mom when my boy gets his 
                college degree.  

                              SMASH
                And I ll be a very proud son.

  Corrina smiles.  OFF Waverly, cocking her head.  Skeptical.  

  INT. TAYLOR HOUSE - NIGHT

  Coach, Tami, Julie and Matt Saracen eat dinner.  No one says 
  a word.  Extremely awkward.

                              JULIE
                Okay, that s enough.  TV time.

  Julie stands, motions to Saracen. 

                              SARACEN
                Thank you, ma am.  Dinner was 
                really good.

  Tami smiles.  Julie pulls Saracen away.  OFF Coach, not even 
  knowing what to think...

  INT. WILLIAMS KITCHEN - NIGHT

  Smash washes dishes.  Waverly dries.

                You coming to the game Friday 
                night?

                Why?  You going to trick me into it 
                if I say no?

                              SMASH
                Maybe.  See, Smash don t accept no.  

                              WAVERLY
                You ll have to this time.  And 
                what s with you calling yourself 
                 the Smash ?  You always talk in 
                the third person?

                              SMASH
                The Smash stands for me, my mom, 
                and my sisters.  When I succeed, we 
                all succeed.  Team Smash. 
                      (beat)
                Forget the game.  Would you go out 
                with me after?  Please.

  Waverly smiles.  Walks out of the room.

                              SMASH (CONT D)
                What?!  What was that?  Don t think 
                it s over, girl.  The Smash don t 
                quit.  The Smash don t lose.  You 
                know what makes a champion a 
                  champion?  The refusal to lose.  
                That s why I m a champion.  I 
                refuse to quit.

  INT. TAYLOR HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

  Julie and Saracen sit on the couch watching  The Office.   
  Saracen s arm is on the back of the couch, inches from 
  Julie s shoulder.  Julie laughs at something on the TV, and 
  Saracen laughs, too, but the truth is that Saracen s arm 
  aches and all he s thinking about is putting his arm around 
  her.  PRELAP...

                                TAYLOR (V.O.)
                Why the hell is he still here?

  INT. TAYLOR HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

  Coach stares down the steps.  Tami is inside the room.

                                TAYLOR
                Yeah, but Saracen s changing.  
                Being starting quarterback on a 
                winning team will do that.  He s 
                getting that swagger.

                              TAMI
                  I remember when you had that 
                swagger.  God, it was like 
                  yesterday that we were their age.  
                Now we re the guardians.  Yikes.

                                TAYLOR
                You feeling old?

                              TAMI
                Not when I m with you.

  They kiss.  Tami pulls him inside, the years peeling away as 
  they kiss with more urgency.  Suddenly, Coach breaks away --  

                                TAYLOR
                He s all over her.  I can smell it.

  And before Tami can react, Coach BURSTS out the door...

  INT. TAYLOR HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

  Matt s arm is just about on Julie s shoulder.  He lowers it, 
  lowers it, working by millimeter.  Finally he makes contact.  
  Freezes for a reaction.  But Julie seems cool, so he settles 
  in.  Julie snuggles to Saracen and pulls a blanket around 
  them.   

  BAM!  The door opens.  REVEAL Coach.

                                TAYLOR
                Party s over!

  Saracen bolts up.  Julie stares at her dad in horror.  Coach 
  realizes he just made a big mistake.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      39.

    CONTINUED:


                                TAYLOR (CONT D)
                Uh, I mean, it s getting late.  
                Don t you have a game?

                              SARACEN
                Yes, sir.

                                TAYLOR
                Well, finish up.  

  ON Julie, pissed, but Coach is still reluctant to leave.  He 
  snatches the blanket covering Julie and Saracen.

                                TAYLOR (CONT D)
                That s my blanket!  I was looking 
                for it.  Gets cold upstairs.

  OFF Julie, swearing never to bring home another date...

  INT. STREET HOUSE - JASON S ROOM - NIGHT

  Jason strums a guitar, or rather is trying to.  His 
    coordination is for shit, and he s frustrated.  A FLY buzzes 
  Jason s head, in and out.  Jason tries to swat it, but misses 
  by a mile.  The fly dive bombs again, Jason a sitting target.  
  Jason SPINS his wheelchair, desperate to get away.

                              JASON
                Get off me!

  He stops.  REVEAL TIM RIGGINS watching from the other side of 
  the screen door.

                              RIGGINS
                Hi.

  BACK TO Jason: he just stares.

                              RIGGINS (CONT D)
                Can I come in?  I ve got to tell 
                you something.

  Jason slowly nods.  Tim hesitates.  

                              RIGGINS (CONT D)
                You gonna hit me again?

                              JASON
                I might.  
                      (beat, then)
                What do you have to tell me?




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      40.

    CONTINUED:


  Tim cautiously enters.

                              RIGGINS
                It s about Lyla.

                              JASON
                That s a bad subject.

                              RIGGINS
                I know, and man, I m really sorry.  
                I  m not making excuses or nothing, 
                it s just that Lyla -
                      (takes a breath)
                She loves you.  She s always loved 
                you.  Was never any question about 
                that.

                              JASON
                Odd how she slept with you when she 
                loves me so much.

                              RIGGINS
                It was never about me.  She just - 
                freaked.  And I guess I m the one 
                to blame.  I took advantage.

  OFF Jason, not sure what to make of this.

                              JASON
                Fine.  You told me.  See you 
                 round.

                              RIGGINS
                Yeah.  I guess.

  Tim stands.  THE FLY circles the room, then BUZZES Jason.  
  Jason shakes his head in frustration, but the fly refuses to 
  leave, as if the fly knows Jason s limits by now.

  WHAP!  Tim nails the fly with a rolled up magazine.

                              JASON
                Oh, man.  You smooshed it against 
                our team photo.

  CLOSE ON smudge across the Panther team photo.

                              RIGGINS
                Sorry.

  They both LAUGH.  Tim glances around the room.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      41.

                Doesn t this stuff depress you?  

                              JASON
                Hells, yeah.

                              RIGGINS
                It s like a museum.  

                              JASON
                The Jason Street pre-paralyzed 
                museum.  Wheelchair accessible.

                              RIGGINS
                You charge admission?

                              JASON
                  I should.  I am a big financial 
                drain, you know.
                      (then)
                Would you do me a favor?  Help me 
                get this shit down.  I think I need 
                a new hobby.

  Tim nods.  Lifts a trophy.

                              RIGGINS
                Hey, this is mine.

                              JASON
                What are you talking about?

                              RIGGINS
                This was for first place in the 
                run, pass and kick contest.  I 
                think we were ten.  I beat you.

                              JASON
                I don t think so.

                              RIGGINS
                I know so.  Was the only time I 
                won.

                              JASON
                If you won, why do I have the 
                trophy?

  INT. DILLON HIGH - TAMI S OFFICE - DAY

  Pam Garrity, her big hair perfectly coiffed and dressed sharp 
  in a suit and heels, talks to Tami.  Tami is in jeans.  She s 
  got her hair in a ponytail.

                              TAMI
                You want Lyla s transcripts?

                              PAM
                That s right.  We re placing her in 
                the Hawthorne Academy for Girls.  
                It s a good school.

                              TAMI
                The best all-girl school in Texas.  
                But why?  Because of what happened 
                with Tim Riggins?

  Pam clearly doesn t want to talk about it. 

                              TAMI (CONT D)
                Pam, this is 2006.  Don t send Lyla 
                to a nunnery.  Don t buy into such 
                a double standard.  No one s 
                hassling Tim Riggins; why make Lyla 
                take the fall?

                              PAM
                Don t play ideologist for me, okay?  
                I didn t make the world, but I know 
                that God did, and that God s a man.  
                The world is different for girls.

                              TAMI
                Not if we fight that thought.

                              PAM
                Let some other girl s mother fight 
                that fight.  I for one will not 
                stand by and let my baby be called 
                a slut every day  til she 
                  graduates.  She s already been 
                  pressured to quit the cheerleading 
                squad.

                              TAMI
                But that s my point.  Let her 
                  cheerlead, tell her not to quit.  




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      43.

    CONTINUED:


                              PAM
                You think I don t want her to 
                  cheerlead?  Who do you think has 
                driven Lyla all over Texas for the 
                greater part of her life in pursuit 
                of this dream?  Do you know how big 
                Texas is?

                              TAMI
                Big.

                              PAM
                Very big.  

                              TAMI
                I know you re doing what you think 
                is right.  It s just, well, I think 
                Lyla s really special.  I think 
                you re underestimating her.  She s 
                so much more than a cheerleader.

                              PAM
                Watch your words, honey.  I know 
                you think cheerleading is silly, 
                but if you really knew Lyla, you d 
                know it s everything to her.  It 
                makes her part of something.  Lyla 
                likes to be liked.  Now, can I 
                please have the transcripts?

  Tami pulls out a file.

                              TAMI
                The need to be liked - the female 
                disease.  I say it s time for women 
                to stop being so nice and time for 
                us to rule the world.  Maybe then 
                we d get things accomplished.

                              PAM
                Please.  Tami Taylor, you talk 
                feisty feminism, but if I recall 
                  correctly you dropped everything in 
                your world to become a part of 
                Eric s.  You put aside your 
                  impressive education and had his 
                baby.  Truth is, you re no 
                  different than anyone else  round 
                here.

  OFF Tami, stabbed with some truth...                                                                                      44.



  INT. DILLON HIGH - AUDITORIUM - DAY

  Coach is backstage with Julie after her dance recital.  Julie 
  is in a leotard.

                                TAYLOR
                I m sorry about last night.  I 
                know, I m an idiot.  But Julie, 
                it s just, just - I know you re 
                maturing into a beautiful young 
                lady, but to me you re my little 
                girl, and I just go primal.  

                              JULIE
                Because of Matt?

                                TAYLOR
                Because of guys in general.  
                Jesus...

  ANGLE ON OTHER DANCERS parading by, all in leotards, all in 
  the blossoming stage of adolescence.  Julie gives him a kiss.

                              JULIE
                Thanks, dad.  I appreciate that.  
                I m proud of how you re maturing, 
                too.

                And this is the defensive playbook 
                of the Texas Longhorns.  Know them 
                by Monday.

                              SARACEN
                Monday?

  CLOSE ON a pile of playbooks.  A foot high. 

                                TAYLOR
                Yeah, I know it s a lot, but you 
                got to get it done.

                              SARACEN
                I... had plans.

  ON Coach, he doesn t want to hear about it.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      45.

    CONTINUED:


                              SARACEN (CONT D)
                With your daughter.  Is that what 
                this is about, sir?  With all due 
                respect.

  Coach gets in Saracen s face.

                                TAYLOR
                With all due respect, you and I 
                have to keep my daughter out of 
                this.  But hear this: I love my 
                  daughter, and I am a man, and I was 
                once a boy.  Understood?

                              SARACEN
                Yes, sir.

  Coach backs away.

                                TAYLOR
                But this is about football.  About 
                the Panthers winning State.  I m 
                not treating you any differently 
                then I would any starting 
                  quarterback.  Glory comes with a 
                price, son.  Memorize those plays. 

  OFF Saracen s look...

                Sweetie, we re trying to protect 
                you.  See, when I was a sophomore, 
                there was this girl, Marion.  She 
                went to a party, got drunk, ended 
                up in a - well, I might as well say 
                it, you re all grown up - she ended 
                up in a three-way with two boys.  

  Lyla does not want to hear about three-ways from her mother.

                The boys become heroes, and Marion?  
                We all made her life a living hell.  
                Even me.  Every day she slouched 
                lower in her seat, looked a little 
                more dead behind the eyes.  

                              LYLA
                I don t want to leave.  The 
                  tournament is Saturday.

                She told me to consider it.

                You should step down.  Honey, it s 
                best for everyone.

                              LYLA
                I don t want to quit cheerleading.  
                It s all I ve got now.

  Main Street is crowded with pedestrians.  BUSINESSMEN get 
  their shoes shined.  

  EXT. GRADY HOUSE - NIGHT

  Smash stands below Waverly s window.

                I m not leaving until you agree to 
                go out with me tonight.  Get some 
                pizza, ice cream, whatever.  But 
                I m not leaving  till you say yes.

  ON Waverly, standing at the window.  She doesn t flinch.

                Think about what you re doing.  I m 
                the Panthers  star player.  We lose 
                this game, goodbye State.  The 
                entire town of Dillon will be 
                  devastated, and it will be all your 
                fault.  All because you wouldn t 
                agree to one simple date.  We don t 
                even have to call it a date.

  Waverly turns inside.

  Smash talks to himself, puzzled.

                Now what, Smash?  You really gonna 
                skip the game?  For a girl?

  He toughens up.  Then looks at his watch.  Glances at 
  Waverly s window.  Panic.  But Waverly appears.

                              WAVERLY
                Okay, I ll go.  For Dillon s sake.

  Smash flashes his million dollar smile.

                Sweet.  Pick you up after the game.  

  He turns from the window, starts on a slow run.

  Not so fast.

                Yeah, you re different.  That s

                That doesn t sound like a friendly 
                people.  But they seemed pretty 
                friendly at the World Cup.  Was 
                being there during World Cup cool?

                              WAVERLY
                It was no big deal.

                              SMASH
                No big deal!  I heard there were 
                parties in the street when they 
                made the quarterfinals.  You sure 
                you were in Ghana?

  Waverly s eyes widen.  But it s not Smash s words that have 
  shocked her - his nose is BLEEDING.  Gushing down his face.

  Smash s letterman jacket is balled up on Waverly s lap.  
  Smash lays his head on it as he pinches a napkin to his nose.

                No.  Just lately.

                              WAVERLY

                You want to tell me?

                No.

                You want to tell me about that SAT 
                class.  I checked - I know you re 
                not taking it.

                              SMASH
                You want to tell me where you been 
                the last year?  I know it wasn t 
                Ghana.

  Waverly doesn t argue.  A beat, then...

                              WAVERLY
                Have you ever just been blue?

  INT. STREET HOUSE - JASON S ROOM - NIGHT

  Jason strums his guitar, his inability to coordinate chords 
  producing a sorrowful sound.  There s a KNOCK.  Jason opens 
  the door --  

  REVEAL Lyla.  Jason starts to shut the door...

                              LYLA
                Don t!  I need to speak to you. 

  Jason hesitates, but Lyla enters.  She s angry.  

                              LYLA (CONT D)
                Look at me!  Can t you even look at 
                me?!  
                      (Jason does)
                I made a mistake.  By far the worst 
                mistake of my life, in fact, when 
                you think about it, aside from the 
                time I stole a lipstick in the 
                seventh grade at Walmart it was 
                  practically my only mistake.  I 
                admit it was a big one, but there 
                is no manual on how to act when 
                your boyfriend becomes paralyzed.  
                This is hard for me, too.

                              JASON
                You need a manual to tell you that 
                sleeping with your boyfriend s best 
                friend isn t cool?  I don t think 
                so.

  Jason spins his chair into a wall as he gets emotional.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      54.

                              LYLA
                I wish I could take it back, I wish 
                I could.  But I can t.  You know, 
                it was our dream that got shattered 
                when you got hurt.  Our dream.  I 
                was alone.  I was scared.

                              JASON
                So you slept with him?  I don t get 
                it.

                              LYLA
                I don t either.  But I do get that 
                I love you.  Now more than ever.
                      (beat)
                I was so sad, sure the dream was 
                gone, trying to pretend it wasn t.  
                But then it overwhelmed me, and I 
                let it.  But I don t believe our 
                dream has to be gone.  I believe in 
                Jason Street and Lyla Garrity.  

  Lyla cries.  Jason is crying, too.

                              JASON
                I used to believe in us, but now I 
                don t know.  God Lyla, you are so 
                  beautiful.  I just don t know if I 
                can forgive you.

                              LYLA
                I wish you could.  I ll never stop 
                loving you, Jason.  And not the 
                star quarterback, and not the 
                  paraplegic, but you, Jason Street.  
                And I miss you.  I miss my best 
                friend.  I d do anything to win you 
                back.  You re all I ever wanted.

  ON Jason, he turns away.  Holds up a hand.  Enough.  Lyla 
    hesitates, then EXITS the room.

                                    ACT FIVE

  EXT. HERRMANN STADIUM - MORNING

  ESTABLISH the American, Texas, and Dillon Panther flags 
  flapping in the wind.  TICKET LINES circle the stadium.  
  YOUNG GIRLS dressed in homemade skirts wave pom-poms as 
    cheerleading squads unload from buses in the parking lot.  

  INT. GARRITY CAR - MORNING 

  Buddy pulls into the parking lot, Pam in the passenger seat, 
  BUDDY JR. and TABBY in the back.  Lyla is not in the car.

  EXT. HERRMANN FIELD - DAY

  Fans mill as a crazy PANTHER LADY (70), all decked out in 
  every imaginable type of Dillon Panther paraphernalia, is 
  chasing Landry for some unknown reason.  Landry is trying to 
  maintain his dignity, but he s failing.

  FIND Coach pushing through a throng of people, politely 
  smiling as everyone congratulates him on last night s game.  

  FIND Smash, surrounded by admirers.  Smash is firing off one-
  handed pushups.

                              SMASH
                I am a machine.  But a thinking 
                machine, and a machine with heart.  

                                TAYLOR
                That machine sounds like a person.  

  The Smash admirers LAUGH.  Coach motions Smash aside.

                                TAYLOR (CONT D)
                Good game last night.

                              SMASH
                Thanks.

                                TAYLOR
                You re feeling good, huh?  
                  Physically?

                              SMASH
                Never felt better.

                                TAYLOR
                I mean,  cause you were really good 
                last night.  Ran over that defender 
                                (MORE)

                                TAYLOR (CONT'D)
                like he was a bowling pin.  You 
                doing anything different?

  A long beat.

                              SMASH
                Yeah.  Eating better, getting more 
                rest.  All that stuff you preach.

  Smash flashes his million dollar grin.  But Coach doesn t 
  really buy it.

                                TAYLOR
                Okay, son.  Keep up the good work.

                                                                          CUT TO:

  INT. HERRMANN STADIUM - BATHROOM - DAY

  Coach is at a urinal, Buddy at the one next to him. 

                              BUDDY
                Good game last night.  Well 
                coached.

                                TAYLOR
                Thanks, Buddy.  The boys were 
                really firing on all cylinders.

                              BUDDY
                That they were.  Listen, I know 
                you ve been Jason Street s coach 
                for years, and that you re Tim 
                Riggins  coach, and how close you 
                all are.  And I just want to say 
                I m sorry for this whole mess with 
                Lyla.  I m really sorry.

  A beat.

                                TAYLOR
                I may be their coach, but I m 
                Julie s father.  I understand 
                having a teen daughter.  I think 
                the hardest part is accepting that 
                our girls, are girls.  On the 
                  fasttrack to becoming ladies.

  OFF Buddy, touched...                                                                                      57.



  EXT. HERRMANN STADIUM - BLEACHERS - DAY

  Tami sits in the bleachers.  She sees Coach carrying a tray 
  with Cokes, popcorn, pretzels...  Waves him over.  

                                TAYLOR
                Good seats.  Where s Julie?  

                              TAMI
                She was here, but got a call from 
                Matt Saracen.  Something about him 
                having to study plays, and he 
                couldn t make it.  So she ended up 
                going there.

                                TAYLOR
                She went there?

                              TAMI
                Eric, Julie knows every play 
                Saracen has to memorize.  She s 
                helping him.  

  Coach buries his head in his arms.

                              TAMI (CONT D)
                Only thing you could do now is make 
                it worse.  Push her, you ll lose 
                her.  Tell me I m wrong.

  Coach can t.  But OFF him feeling lousy...

  INT. FIELD HOUSE - GIRLS LOCKER ROOM - DAY

  The cheerleaders, in various stages of dress, ready 
  themselves.  Legs are taped, limbs stretched.  Also hair 
  spray and make-up applied.  Being pretty does scores points.

  PICK UP Lyla as she enters.  Silence. 

                              LYLA
                I m here to compete.  To win.  I 
                want in, and I swear I m ready.  I 
                swear I ll be focused.  But, if I 
                don t have your support, if I don t 
                have your faith - I won t do it.  

  Lyla looks at Miss Der, then at the girls.  OFF the girls...                                                                                        58.



  EXT. HERMANN FIELD - DAY

  MAYOR RODELL and other Dillon notables are with REVEREND 
  LOCKE as he leads the stadium in prayer.

                              REVEREND LOCKE
                ...and may God bless us, let us be 
                  ourselves, and let us part as 
                friends.  Amen.

                              THE STADIUM
                Amen.

                              MAYOR RODELL
                Alright!  Ladies and Gentlemen, 
                girls and boys, welcome to the 2006 
                  Southwest Cheerleading Regionals!!

  The stadium rocks with CHEERS.  The various squads run onto 
  the field.  PRELAP the NATIONAL ANTHEM...

                                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

  The spectators  patriotism is palpable as the NATIONAL ANTHEM 
  plays.  REVEAL Lyla at the head of the Panther Squad.  

                              THE ANTHEM (V.O.)
                ...Oh say does that star spangled 
                banner yet wave...

  FIND Jason Street as he wheels into the stadium, unseen.  

                              THE ANTHEM (V.O.) (CONT D)
                O er the land of the free, and the 
                home of the brave...

  The anthem ends.  Red, white and blue BALLOONS are released 
  into the air.  It s showtime.

  EXT. HERRMANN FIELD - LATER

  THEME MUSIC UP as the Panthers perform.  ON Lyla leading her 
  squad as they tumble in sync, forming a pyramid.  Lyla vaults 
  up, Brittany supports her.  The pyramid moves, Lyla readies 
  her dismount -- 

  The MUSIC CUTS OUT, the sound system dead.  We hear GASPS 
  from the crowd, confusion among the girls.  

  ANGLE ON Lyla, still precariously balanced on top of the 
  pyramid.  




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      59.

    CONTINUED:


                              LYLA
                Hold it together!  Let s keep 
                moving, COUNTING OFF: 1 and 2 and 1 
                and 2; 1 and 2 and 1 and 2...

  The squad moves, Lyla keeping count.  Then the spectators 
  start CLAPPING, and soon the entire stadium maintains the 
  beat.  

  The squad completes its routine, climaxed by Lyla s twisting 
  dismount.  She sticks her landing.  

  The stadium THUNDERS, everyone to their feet.  FIND Buddy and 
  Pam.  ANGLE ON Pam as she shares a moment with TAMI.  

  BACK TO Lyla, taking it all in, her game face still on.  
  Telling us that she s here, she s not moving, and anybody who 
  has a problem with it can go straight to hell.  

  REVEAL Tim Riggins, also on his feet, clapping with gusto.  
  Then Tim sees Jason Street...

  JASON S POV

    A cheering crowd, something he s seen before, but never from 
  this perspective.  Cheering for Lyla.  For his Lyla.  

  LYLA S POV

  She locks eyes with Jason.  Sees him smile.  A sign of hope?

                                                                HARD TO BLACK:
