      Early morning. The unfinished roof is deserted. NOAH, 42, 
      sits on a crate, smoking a cigarette and watching the sun 
      rise slowly over the brownstones of Brooklyn.

      He s wearing his pajama pants and a white tee-shirt. He s a 
      handsome guy, well-built, solid. Maybe a little scruffy. 
      Probably has a beard. And his hair is falling into his eyes. 
      It s not some kind of hipster declaration, he just hasn t had 
      time to get it cut.

      From up on his perch, the city looks peaceful. Charming. Far 
      away.

      Noah takes another drag and extinguishes the cigarette. He 
      picks up a hand-sized rock by the chimney vent, turns it over 
      and reveals a compartment designed for hiding house keys, 
      where he stashes the pack.



      NOAH is packing a minivan on the curb outside his brownstone. 
      It s one of those inconceivable acts of geometry that only 
      men of a certain age with at least two children seem to have 
      mastered. He approaches the task like a chess master. 
      Absolute concentration. 

      His son, MARTIN, 13, comes out of the apartment and sits down 
      on the stoop, watching him. 

                                  NOAH
                    Hey. 

                                  MARTIN
                    Hey.

                                  NOAH
                    Are you packed?

                                  MARTIN
                    Yup.

                                  NOAH
                    Are you excited?

      Martin doesn t answer. He picks angrily at some debris on the 
      steps.                                                                                      3.


                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    You re hiding it well, but I can 
                    tell that you are.

                                  MARTIN
                    I wanted to stay here for the 
                    summer.

                                  NOAH
                    I know.

                                  MARTIN
                    I wanted to go to league camp.

                                  NOAH
                    Well, next summer, if you bring 
                    that grade point average up, you 
                    can stay and go to league camp. -

                                  MARTIN
                    That s ridiculous!

                                  NOAH
                    Why is that ridiculous?

                                  MARTIN
                    You said I could go to league camp -

                                  NOAH
                    If you got your grades up. You seem 
                    to have forgotten the second clause 
                    of the contact. 

                                  MARTIN
                    It sucks at Grandpa s.

                                  NOAH
                    That s not true. 

                                  MARTIN
                    It is true.

                                  NOAH
                    Martin, your grandfather has a 
                    swimming pool, two tennis courts, 
                    and a sauna on his property. It 
                      objectively does not suck there.

      Martin glares at his father.

                                  MARTIN
                    You suck.

      Noah shrugs.                                                                                      4.


                                  NOAH
                    That is, at least, a more 
                      defendable hypothesis.


      Martin spots his basketball tucked into middle of the 
      suitcase rubric.

                                  MARTIN
                    Oh shit, I ve been looking for 
                    that.

      He jumps up, darts over to the trunk and reaches for the ball 
    -

                                  NOAH
                    No wait!

      But it s too late. Martin pulls the ball out, thus 
      destabilizing the structure. The suitcases fall, popping open 
      on the street.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    Martin! What the hell?!

      Martin just stares at him, blank. 

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    What were you thinking?

      Martin runs off into the house.



      Noah is back on the curb, repacking the trunk. A VOICE begins 
      speaking, over the scene. Noah doesn t react to it. He 
      doesn t hear it.

                                  VOICE
                    Mr. Kalish. Hi. Thanks for coming 
                    in.

                                  NOAH S VOICE
                    It s not like I had much of a 
                    choice.

                                  VOICE
                    Well, we ll try not to take up too 
                    much of your time.

      Trevor exits the brownstone and bounds down the steps, 
      followed by his older sister, WHITNEY 16, who wears red 
      lipstick, dark sunglasses and a tiny jumpsuit.

                                  VOICE (CONT D)
                    I d like to begin by asking you a 
                    few questions about how this whole 
                    mess got started. 

      The kids climb into the minivan.  

                                  NOAH
                          (to Whitney)
                    Good morning, daughter.

                                    WHITNEY
                    Good morning, father.

                                  NOAH
                    Do you need your sunglasses in the 
                    car?

                                    WHITNEY
                    I m breaking them in.

                                  NOAH
                    Are we going to see your eyes at 
                    all this summer?

                                    WHITNEY
                    I doubt it.

                                  VOICE
                    Is that alright with you? Mr. 
                    Kalish?                                                                                      7.


      Halla comes out of the brownstone carrying their youngest 
      daughter STACEY (2) in her arms.

                                  NOAH S VOICE
                    It s a free country, Pal. Ask away.

      Halla opens the back seat and installs Stacey in her car 
      seat.

                                  HALLA
                          (looking around the car)
                    Where s Martin?

                                  NOAH
                    Still in the house, isn t he?

                                  HALLA
                          (frowning)
                    I don t think so.



      Noah opens the sliding side door and Martin climbs into the 
      mini-van.



      Four hours later, the minivan finally pulls into a restaurant 
      parking lot. All the kids pile out.



      The kids are loaded back into the minivan. Noah buckles 
      Stacey into her car seat.

                                  STACEY
                    You ve got dirt on your face!

                                    WHITNEY
                    That s not dirt, stupid. That s dry 
                    blood.

                                  NOAH
                    Whitney, if you don t adjust the 
                    attitude, I swear to God ...

      In the front seat, Halla turns and looks at Noah, concerned.  

                                  HALLA
                    Is it still bleeding?

                                  NOAH
                    I doubt it. It was a tiny cut -

                                  HALLA
                    When we get to my parent s place, I 
                    want to see it.

      He freezes.                                                                                    22.


                                  HALLA (CONT D)
                    What?

                                  NOAH
                    I forgot to leave a tip. 

                                  HALLA
                    It s fine. She was obnoxious 
                    anyway.

                                  NOAH
                    Halla. They live on those tips. 
                    I ll be right back.

      Before she can stop him, he s jogging back across the parking 
      lot.



      Huge wooden gates, covered with ivy, open slowly. The minivan 
      passes through and stops in the center of a circular, pebbled 
      drive. Before them stands a Georgian country masterpiece. One 
      of those dreamy old mansions, built by oil barons, during the 
      turn of the previous century.

      The front door swings open and Halla s mother, MARGARET, 65, 
      comes flying out.

                                  MARGARET
                    You re here! Finally!

      The kids pile out of the car. One-by-one they embrace their 
        grandmother. 

                                  MARGARET (CONT D)
                    Whitney let me look at you. God, 
                    you re so thin. Have you stopped 
                    eating or something?

                                  HALLA
                      Practically.

                                  MARGARET
                          (to Whitney)
                    Well, keep it up, you look 
                    fabulous.                                                                                    24.


                                  HALLA
                    Mom, this is not a behavior pattern 
                    we want to encourage.

                                  MARGARET
                    Don t listen to you mother. She s 
                    just jealous. She was always a 
                    donut. Lose a few more pounds dear, 
                    and I ll take you to Paris.

      Behind the car, Noah has opened the trunk and begun unloading 
      luggage. Martin sidles up to him.

                                  MARTIN
                    Aren t you worried these people are 
                    going to fuck us up royally?

                                  NOAH
                    Oh come on, your mother turned out 
                    okay.

                                  MARTIN
                    She s a nutjob too, Dad.

                                  NOAH
                    Maybe so, but if you keep talking 
                    about her like that, you re going 
                    to wind up with a fist in your 
                    mouth.

      Martin stares at Noah, shocked.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    We all have our limits, Pal.

      Martin walks away.



      Noah, a beer in hand, opens the screen door and steps out of 
      the house, unto the expansive deck. Before him is an epic 
      backyard. A swimming pool in the foreground. Tennis courts in 
      the distance. A flower garden. A vegetable garden. A 
      fountain. A gazebo. A hammock. 

      Trevor is already in the pool. Whitney is reading in the 
      hammock. Martin is hitting balls down on the tennis courts.

      Noah HEARS a sound behind him and turns. Halla s father, 
      BRUCE, 70, has joined him on the deck. He s holding a bottle 
      of white burgundy.                                                                                    25.


                                  BRUCE
                    Noah, I thought I might be able to 
                    interest in you in an apertif.

                                  NOAH
                    Thanks Bruce. I ve got a beer.

                                  BRUCE
                          (frowning)
                    Where in the world did you find 
                    that?

                                  NOAH
                    In the refrigerator?

                                  BRUCE
                    Huh. Must have been left by one of 
                    the Mexicans.

      Bruce pours himself a glass and shows the bottle to Noah.

                                  BRUCE (CONT D)
                    It was a gift from Paramount.

                                  NOAH
                    That s right. The new movie opens 
                    soon, doesn t it?

                                  BRUCE
                    Next month.

                                  NOAH
                    Have you seen it?

                                  BRUCE
                      I couldn t bear to. After the mess 
                    they made of my last book ... 
                    nobody listens to me out there. 
                    Nobody actually wants my opinion. 
                    They just want me to cash my check 
                    and show up at the premiere. So 
                    that s what I do now. And I feel 
                    like a bit of a whore, of course, 
                    but then I come home and I look 
                    around...

      He surveys his kingdom.

                                  BRUCE (CONT D)
                    And I feel better.

      Noah suppresses an eye roll. Both men drink.                                                                                    26.


                                  BRUCE (CONT D)
                    So, I read your little book.

      Noah winces.

                                  BRUCE (CONT D)
                    I enjoyed most of it very much. Of 
                    course you could have used a decent 
                    editor, but the first novel, by an 
                    unknown writer ... I m sure you 
                    didn t get to pick.

                                  NOAH
                    No.

                                  BRUCE
                    Halla tells us it did well? I don t 
                    keep up with such things.

                                  NOAH
                    Well enough to get a second book.

                                  BRUCE
                    Well congratulations, son. That s 
                    not easy to do.

      Bruce holds out his glass. They clink.

                                  BRUCE (CONT D)
                    Now you can finally quit that 
                    horrible job of yours.

                                  NOAH
                    It wasn t that big an advance.

                                  BRUCE
                    Oh no? Pity.

                                  NOAH
                    I like my job, Bruce. I wouldn t 
                    quit it even if I did make the kind 
                    of money you do.

                                  BRUCE
                    Your first book felt a bit 
                      disjointed, if you want to know the 
                    truth. Like you never really had 
                    the chance to complete a thought. 
                    You need to give yourself time,    
                    Noah. To write, of course, but just 
                    to be. Out here, some days I don t 
                    even go into my office. I just walk 
                    down to the beach and think. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    27.

                                  BRUCE (CONT'D)
                    By the time I sit back down at my 
                    computer, a whole chapter just 
                    flows out of me. 

      Noah doesn t respond.

                                  BRUCE (CONT D)
                    Everyone has one book in them. 
                    Almost nobody has two.

      Noah drains his beer. 

                                  BRUCE (CONT D)
                    How s the brownstone?

                                  NOAH
                    It s wonderful. 

                                  BRUCE
                    Large enough for all of you?

                                  NOAH
                          (flat)
                    Yes. Thank you again for the loan.

      Bruce waves him off.

                                  BRUCE
                    It was my pleasure. I couldn t have 
                    my grandchildren growing up in a 
                    tenement.



      Noah sits down by the surf, nursing his beer, watching the 
      waves. The beach is relatively empty.                                                                                     28.


      It s early in the season, and most of the sunbathers have 
      gone in for dinner. Only the SURFERS are still in the water, 
      sucking the marrow out of the swell.

      Out of the corner of his eye, Noah notices a ROGUE BOARD 
      drifting towards shore. He looks around for the owner, but 
      there s nobody close by. Worried that it will be swept out 
      again by the tide and lost, Noah gets up, wades into the 
      water to retrieve it. 

      Then he sits back down in his spot.

                                  NOAH S VOICE
                    If you asked me if I was a happy 
                    man, back then, I would have said 
                    yes. I loved my wife. I loved my 
                    kids. My first book had just come 
                    out... everything I promised myself 
                    I d achieve when I was a young 
                    man... I d done it.

                                  VOICE
                    But?

                                  NOAH S VOICE 
                    That s the thing. There was no 
                     but .  When I look back on what 
                    happened, I couldn t tell you why.

      A SURFER appears suddenly, like a seal, in the white water. 
      He stands and waves. Around his ankle, there s a broken 
      leash. 

                                  SURFER
                          (re: the board)
                    Thanks for the rescue, man. It s 
                    getting gnarly out there.

                                  NOAH
                    No problem.

                                  SURFER
                    I m Cole.

                                  NOAH
                    Noah.

      They shake.

                                  COLE
                    You gonna paddle out?

                                  NOAH
                    No, I don t ... I m just watching.                                                                                    29.


                                  COLE
                    On vacation?

                                  NOAH
                    That s right.

                                  COLE
                    Want to learn? I teach people. I 
                    run a clinic. We meet every 
                    morning. Seven am at Tower 4. 

                                  NOAH
                    Thanks but I m not sure it s my 
                    thing.

                                  COLE
                    Where you staying?

      Noah gestures vaguely behind him in the direction of Bruce s 
      house.

                                  COLE (CONT D)
                    Oh wow. You a wall street guy?

                                  NOAH
                          (surprised)
                    Do I look like a Wall Street guy?

                                  COLE
                    Hey, no offense man. I like Wall 
                    Street guys. They re psychopaths. 
                    They make good surfers.

                                  NOAH
                    I m a teacher. It s my father-in-
                    laws house.

                                  COLE
                    Ah. Well. I like teachers too. If 
                    you change your mind, just show up 
                    one morning. First lesson s on me.

                                  NOAH
                    Thanks man.

                                  COLE
                    It s the least I can do. You saved 
                    my board.

      Noah nods. Cole starts down the beach. As he walks away, Noah 
      SEES the tattoo of an angel spread across his back.                                                                                    30.


                                  COLE (CONT D)
                          (turning back)
                    If you see a bonfire outside your 
                    window tonight, that s my crew. 
                    We re having a sort of meet-and-
                    greet to see who s back for the 
                    season. You should come.

                                  NOAH
                    But I don t surf.

                                  COLE
                    Alright, don t come. But don t call 
                    the cops.



      Noah quietly opens the wooden gate that separates Bruce s 
      property from the sand. He continues down a small path of 
      wooden planks through the dunes. 

                                  NOAH S VOICE
                    You give up some personal liberties 
                    to live in a secure state. On all 
                    levels. National. Municipal. 
                    Marital.

      The sky above him is streaked with stars.



      Noah wanders down the deserted beach, headed towards the 
      bonfire.                                                                                     33.


                                  NOAH S VOICE
                    I d never had a problem with it 
                    before. I liked being married. When 
                    other men used to complain about 
                    their wives, I d just think  Well 
                    that poor sucker made a bad 
                    choice. 

      Up ahead, he sees a woman sitting alone on the sand, close to 
      the surf. As he crosses behind her, she turns to look at him. 

      It s Alison. Her face is illuminated by the moon. She looks 
      stunning. Otherwordly. 

                                  NOAH
                          (amazed)
                    Hi.

                                  ALISON
                    You found me.

                                  NOAH
                    What? No, I was just ... I was just 
                    out for a walk and you happened to 
                    be -

                                  ALISON
                          (smiling)
                    Hey Noah? I was kidding. 

                                  NOAH
                    Oh. Right. Sorry, I -

                                  ALISON
                    How s your head?

                                  NOAH
                    It s - uh - it s fine now. Thank 
                    you.

                                  ALISON
                    Are you going to the party?

                                  NOAH
                    Uh - what party?

                                  ALISON
                    The surfers are throwing a bonfire.

                                  NOAH
                    I don t surf.

                                  ALISON
                    Me neither. Walk me home then?                                                                                    34.


                                  NOAH
                          (surprised)
                    Um, okay.

                                  ALISON
                    Unless you have somewhere else to 
                    be?

                                  NOAH
                    No, I - where do you live?

                                  ALISON
                    I m just up over that dune.

      She holds out her hand to him for assistance. He pulls her up 
      to stand. She tries to brush the sand off her body. 

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                    Would you mind cleaning the places 
                    I can t reach?

      She turns her rear towards him. She s wearing jeans and a 
      thin tank. There s sand caked all over her very attractive 
      ass. 

      Beat.

                                  NOAH
                    I don t think that s a good idea.

      Alison turns back towards Noah and grins.

                                  ALISON
                    Fair enough.

      She pulls a pack of cigarettes out of her purse.

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                    Want one?



      Noah and Alison walk down a little paved road that runs 
      parallel to the beach. They re both smoking.

                                  ALISON
                    I don t get it. Are you a writer or 
                    not?

                                  NOAH
                    I ve written a book.                                                                                    35.


                                  ALISON
                    So you are then.

                                  NOAH
                    No, but you know what they say. 
                    Everyone has at least one book in 
                    them. You haven t really proven 
                    anything until you ve followed it 
                    up.

                                  ALISON
                    I don t know anyone who says that. 

                                  NOAH
                          (weary)
                    I do.

                                  ALISON
                    Sounds like you hang out with 
                    assholes.

      Noah smiles. He s never thought of it that way.

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                    And your wife? What does she do?

                                  NOAH
                    She, um, she sells luxury books.

                                  ALISON
                          (frowning)
                    Luxury books?

                                  NOAH
                    You know, coffee table books. On 
                    fashion. Or travel. Lifestyle 
                    stuff.

                                  ALISON
                    She s a writer too?

                                  NOAH
                    No, she doesn t - she sells them. 
                    To hotels and fancy stores. 

                                  ALISON
                    So she sells books that rich people 
                    read?

                                  NOAH
                    Well, I mean, you certainly can 
                    read them. But mostly, they re kind 
                    of decorative.                                                                                     36.


      Alison laughs.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    What?

                                  ALISON
                    Nothing. I just never knew that was 
                    a job.

                                  NOAH
                    Yeah, well, it s not like curing 
                    cancer, but Halla s got a great 
                    eye, so...

      Alison stops.

                                  ALISON
                    This is me.

      They re standing in front of a gravel driveway which leads to 
      a small, airy beach cottage, up on stilts. 

                                  NOAH
                    Wow. What a great house. 

                                  ALISON
                    I think so.

      She heads up the driveway.

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                    So does she sell your book?

      Noah is lost for a moment in the moonlit perfection of this 
      little bungalow.

                                  NOAH
                    What? No.



      Alison leads Noah around the side of the house to a quaint 
      water closet made entirely of wooden planks. She strips down 
      to her bikini and steps inside, barely closing the slotted 
      door behind her.

                                  ALISON (O.C.)
                          (from inside the shower)
                    Do you mind if I just rinse off?

                                  NOAH
                    Not at all.                                                                                    37.


      The SOUND of water turning on. Behind the door, steam begins 
      to rise. A moment and then Alison s bikini top drops to her 
      feet.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    I love these things.

                                  ALISON (O.C.)
                    What?

                                  NOAH
                          (shouting)
                    I said I love these things!

                                  ALISON (O.C.)
                    Outdoor showers?

                                  NOAH
                          (shouting)
                    Yeah.

                                  ALISON (O.C.)
                    Come on in! When the planks get wet 
                    they smell like pine.

                                  NOAH
                          (shouting)
                    I can smell it from here!

      Alison s wet head appears around the door. She reaches out a 
      glistening hand.

                                  ALISON
                    You have to try it.

      She grabs Noah s arm. Her touch startles him. Snaps him back 
      to reality. 

                                  NOAH
                          (sharply)
                    No.

      He pulls away, almost violently. He looks around. What is he 
      doing here?

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    I have to go. It s late. I ll, um,  
                    I ll see you around. 

      Noah turns and leaves as quickly as he can.                                                                                    38.



      Noah walks down the dark road, trying to calm his heartbeat. 
      Behind him, he HEARS the muffled sound of a man and a woman 
      arguing. The woman s voice sounds a lot like Alison. 

      The fight seems to escalate. They re screaming at each other.

      Noah slows down.



      Shrouded by shadows, on the far side of the street, Noah 
      watches the events unfolding down Alison s driveway.

      She s wrapped in a towel talking to a MAN, mid-30s, in swim 
      trunks. Noah is too far away to hear what they re saying. A 
      surfboard leans against a parked car.

      Alison PUSHES the man away as hard as she can. As he stumbles 
      back, the motion-sensitive light switches on and Noah can see 
      his face -

      It s Cole.

      Cole reaches for Alison. She SLAPS his hand away. He comes at 
      her again, grabbing her by the hair, whispering into her ear.  
      Noah doesn t know what to do. It looks like she s being 
      attacked. He steps forward, into the street, with the intent 
      of saving her -

      Just as he does, she turns her head and looks down the 
      driveway. Noah FREEZES. She seems to SEE him. Somehow, 
      through the dark, she s looking right at him. 

      Then she does something strange. She SHAKES HER HEAD. It s a 
      slight movement, but it s clear. 

      Alison turns back to Cole and says something incendiary. He 
      takes a beat, looks at her, then he PUSHES her against the 
      hood of the parked car. He bends her over on her stomach and 
      enters her from behind.

      Alison rests her head against the hood of the car. She s 
      facing down the driveway. She s facing Noah. Her eyes meet 
      his and LOCK.

      He knows he should go - it isn t right to watch - but he 
      can t move. He can t breathe. Somehow he knows that she wants 
      him to stay. Like she s putting on a show.  

      For him.                                                                                    39.



      An hour later. Alison emerges from the house, holding her 
      tea. She sits down in a rocking chair and looks out. Across 
      the street, she can SEE a section of the ocean between two 
      houses. The sun is rising over the water. 

      On the driveway below, Cole appears, in a half-zipped 
      wetsuit, carrying his surfboard under his arm.

      He waves to her. She waves back.

                                  COLE
                          (calling up)
                    What are you doing today?

                                  ALISON
                    I was thinking about going to work.                                                                                    43.


                                  COLE
                    And later?

      She shrugs.

                                  COLE (CONT D)
                    I m going to swing by and visit him 
                    after my clinic this afternoon. 
                    Want to meet me there?

                                  ALISON
                    Okay.

                                  COLE
                    Can you be there by four?

                                  ALISON
                    I think so.

                                  COLE
                    Cool. And then afterwards, I want 
                    to take you out to dinner. Unless 
                    you already have a hot date?

                                  ALISON
                    I have to check my calendar.

      Cole grins.

                                  COLE
                    You do that.

      He starts down the driveway. She watches him go. Suddenly, 
      she stands and goes to the railing -

                                  ALISON
                    Be careful!

      Cole stops, turns back. He looks concerned.

                                  COLE
                    I will, Ali.



      Alison sits on the floor of the outdoor shower, under the 
      spray. She s staring at the water as it hits her feet and 
      disappears between the slatted wooden planks. We get the 
      feeling she s been sitting there for a while. Like, maybe, 
      she s having a hard time getting up.                                                                                    44.


      A VOICE starts speaking. It s the same voice we heard on 
      Noah s side, the POLICE OFFICER. And just like Noah, Alison 
      doesn t seem to HEAR it.

                                  VOICE
                    Why don t you tell me how it began?

                                  ALISON S VOICE
                    Oh God, it was so long ago, who 
                      remembers?

                                  VOICE
                    We re hoping that you do, Ms. 
                    Bailey.



      Alison peddles her bicycle along the side of Montauk Highway 
      on her way into town. The road is mostly deserted. The sun is 
      now cresting over the tops of the hills. 

                                  ALISON S VOICE
                    It all started on a dark and stormy 
                    night. 
                          (beat)
                    Oh, God, I m kidding. Please don t 
                    write that down.



      Alison, back in her civilian clothes, rides her bike through 
      the quaint beach town. 

      She stops in front of a little bakery and hops off.



      With the cupcakes packaged neatly in her basket, Alison rides 
      along the side of the road.

                                  ALISON
                    I do remember the sun was really 
                    bright. Like, unusually strong for 
                    so early in the season. 

      She stops at a four-way intersection, gets off her bike and 
      walks it off the road, to the mouth of a dirt lane flanked by 
      holly trees. 

      She shades her eyes with her hand and stares down the path.

                                  ALISON S VOICE
                    There was no place to hide. 



      Alison rides her bike into the parking lot of the fishing 
      marina.



      Alison stands at the end of one of the docks.

      She reaches into her bag and pulls out the glittery business 
      card that Jane left on the counter.                                                                                    56.


      It reads: 

                  Isabel Guralnik, Psychic.  The Painted Lady 

      Alison looks up again. Sure enough, the boat in front of her 
      is called The Painted Lady.



      Alison is back at the same the intersection. Again, she 
      stares down the dirt road lined with holly trees. 

      She gets off her bike and starts to walk it slowly up the 
      lane.



      Alison stops at the entrance to a small, New England 
      cemetery. She leans her bike against a crumbling stone wall 
      and takes out the box of cupcakes.

      She checks the time on her phone. It s already 6 pm. 

      And there are three MISSED CALLS from Cole.



      Alison sits in front of a newish headstone. She traces her 
      hand over the engraving.

      It reads: 
                          GABRIEL BAILEY, 2011-2013. 

      There are fresh flowers on the grave and a little keychain 
      with a surfboard attached. Cole, it seems, has already been 
      there.

      Alison unwraps the bakery box and takes out one of the 
      cupcakes. She sticks a candle on top, lights it, and places 
      it at the foot of the grave.

      Then she kneels down, gets her face very close to the ground, 
      and begins to sing. 

                                  ALISON
                          (singing)
                    Happy Birthday to you. Happy 
                    Birthday to you. Happy Birthday 
                    dear Munchkin. 

      She chokes on a unexpected sob. She wipes a sudden torrent of 
      tears away with the back of her hand.

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                    Happy Birthday to you.

      Alison presses her ear to the earth as if she s listening for 
      a response.                                                                                     59.



      Hours later. The last rays of the summer sun hover on the 
      horizon. Alison is sleeping on Gabriel s grave. She wakes 
      with a start and looks around, confused. Without the bright 
      sunlight, the cemetery is a very different place. The tall 
      trees that were sheltering her from the sunlight, just hours 
      before, are now hulking, menacing. The shadows are long.

      She s frightened. She quickly pulls out her phone and makes a 
      call.

                                  ALISON
                    Cole?



      Alison sits on the stone gates, waiting. Headlights down the 
      dirt path. They come closer and closer, blinding her. A pick-
      up truck stops and Cole gets out. He looks at his wife. 

                                  ALISON
                    Please don t be mad.

      Cole silently loads her bike into the back of his truck. 



      Alison expertly crumples a leaf between her fingers. She 
      rolls the joint quickly, lights one end with a lighter and 
      takes an epic drag.  

      She leans back in the rocking chair and watches the stars 
      coming out. Her shoulders slowly loosen and fall. 

      Alison HEARS the sound of a screen door opening beneath her. 
      Cole appears in the driveway below, his wet suit half-zipped, 
      carrying a surfboard.   

                                  ALISON
                          (surprised)
                    You re going out again?                                                                                    60.


                                  COLE
                    I had a lousy surf. Broke my strap. 
                    Almost lost my board. Gonna try to 
                    redeem myself.

                                  ALISON
                    Alone? 

                                  COLE
                    Unless you want to come with me?

      Beat. Then Alison shakes her head.

                                  COLE (CONT D)
                    That s what I thought. 

      He stands his board up and examines it.

                                  COLE (CONT D)
                    Are you ever going to get back in 
                    the water?

                                  ALISON
                    I don t know. 
                          (beat)
                    I m sorry.

                                  COLE
                    I don t care. I just thought you d 
                    miss it.

                                  ALISON
                    No, I mean, I m sorry about this 
                      afternoon. 

      Cole looks up at her.

                                  COLE
                    I went by the restaurant. They said 
                    you d left hours ago. Where were 
                    you?

      Alison shrugs, helplessly.

                                  ALISON
                    Nowhere.

      Cole just sighs. He picks up his board and heads down the 
      driveway.

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                          (calling after him)
                    Be careful.                                                                                    61.


      This time he doesn t turn around.



      A few hours later. Alison sits on the beach, wrapped in a 
      wool blanket, watching the surf. 

                                  ALISON
                    I was thirty-one years old. I 
                    remember promising myself I d get 
                    to thirty-five. I d make it through 
                    until then. And if nothing had 
                      changed... well then I d tried hard 
                    enough. 

      She HEARS a noise behind her and turns around. She s shocked 
      to see Noah, smiling down at her.

                                  NOAH
                    Hello.

                                  ALISON
                          (stunned)
                    Hi.

                                  NOAH
                    I found you. 

                                  ALISON
                          (confused)
                    Were you looking for me?

                                  NOAH
                    I m kidding. I was just on my way 
                    to that barbecue down there. 

                                  ALISON
                    Oh you re a surfer?

                                  NOAH
                    Yeah. Sort of. I m learning ... do 
                    you live around here?

                                  ALISON
                    Right over that dune.

                                  NOAH
                    Cool.

      Noah just stands there, grinning. 

                                  ALISON
                    How s your head?                                                                                    62.


      Noah touches his bandage.

                                  NOAH
                    Oh it s okay. I think.

                                  ALISON
                    Did you end up going to the 
                    hospital?

                                  NOAH
                    No, I couldn t face it. I might go 
                    tomorrow.
                          (beat)
                    Can I join you?

                                  ALISON
                    Uh, sure.

                                  NOAH
                    Or, I m sorry - did you want to be 
                    alone?

                                  ALISON
                    No, no. Sit.

      Noah sits down happily, next to her. He takes out a pack of 
      cigarettes and offers her one.

                                  NOAH
                    Want one? They re french.

                                  ALISON
                    I quit a while ago.

                                  NOAH
                    Me too. But I m on vacation.

      Alison smiles.

                                  ALISON
                    Okay. Why not.

      She takes one and he lights it for her.

                                  NOAH
                    I only allow myself to smoke french 
                      cigarettes.

                                  ALISON
                    Why?                                                                                    63.


                                  NOAH
                    Because they re so hard to come by. 
                    I usually give up before I find 
                    one.

      Alison laughs. 

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    So I m Noah, in case you -

                                  ALISON
                      I remember. I m Alison.

                                  NOAH
                    I know. I m sorry again, about this 
                      afternoon. 

                                  ALISON
                    Don t worry about it.

                                  NOAH
                    I can t believe I made you watch me 
                    choke my kid.

                                  ALISON
                    Things happen. Kids are stupid.
                          (beat)
                    I m glad she s alright.

                                  NOAH
                    And then I had a seizure in your -

                                  ALISON
                    Hey, Noah. Do I look upset?

                                  NOAH
                          (honest)
                    You look great.

      Alison flushes. She wasn t expecting that. 

                                  ALISON
                    Then drop it.

                                  NOAH
                    Okay.

      They resume staring at the ocean.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    So do you live out here year round?

                                  ALISON
                    Yup.                                                                                    64.


                                  NOAH
                    What do people do  for fun?

                                  ALISON
                    With kids? All sorts of things - 
                    surfing, sailing, fishing -

                                  NOAH
                    No, I mean, single people.

      He turns and stares right at her. Almost like he s asking her 
      out.

                                  ALISON
                    Um... I wouldn t know.

                                  NOAH
                    You re not fun?

                                  ALISON
                    I m not single.

                                  NOAH
                          (surprised)
                    You re married?

      She nods.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    But no ring.

                                  ALISON
                    We re both surfers. We were afraid 
                    we d lose them in the water. 

                                  NOAH
                    Wow. You re married.

                                  ALISON
                    You sound shocked.

                                  NOAH
                    It s just, you seem so...

      Alison frowns.

                                  ALISON
                    What?

                                  NOAH
                      Independent.                                                                                    65.


                                  ALISON
                          (touched)
                    Oh. Thanks.

      Beat.

                                  NOAH
                    Any children?

      Alison looks at the sea again.

                                  ALISON
                    No.

                                  NOAH
                    Well you re young. You ve got 
                    plenty of time. 

      Alison nods but doesn t respond. An awkward silence sets in. 
      They both smoke. 

                                  ALISON
                    Can I ask you a question? It may be 
                    kinda rude?

                                  NOAH
                    Go ahead.

                                  ALISON
                    Why d you have four?

                                  NOAH
                    Kids?

      She nods. Noah smiles.

                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    I used to have a good answer for it 
                    actually. It was something about 
                    wanting to populate the earth with 
                      reasonable people so the 
                      extremists, with their enormous 
                    families, didn t take over.

                                  ALISON
                    You had four children for political 
                    reasons?

                                  NOAH
                    I was in grad school. It seemed 
                    like a good idea at the time.

                                  ALISON
                    And now?                                                                                    66.


                                  NOAH
                      I couldn t imagine my life without 
                    each one of them. They really are 
                    the best things that ever happened 
                    to me. I know everyone says that, 
                    but it s true.

      More silence. They don t look at each other. But there s some 
      kind of heat building between their bodies. 

                                  ALISON S VOICE
                    I didn t like getting close to new 
                    people back then. I didn t want to 
                    have to explain to anyone else what 
                    had happened. 

      She lays back against the sand with a sigh. A moment. Then he 
      lies back as well. They look up at the stars.

                                  NOAH
                    It s such a beautiful night.

                                  ALISON
                    Yeah, it is.


                    I feel like doing something crazy.

                                  ALISON
                    Like what?

                                  NOAH
                    You want to go for a midnight swim?

      Alison feels suddenly sick. 

                                  ALISON
                    No, I... I don t.

      She sits up.

                                  NOAH
                    I m sorry, that was stupid - 

                                  ALISON
                    It s okay.

                                  NOAH
                    I didn t mean to suggest anything 
                      inappropriate. I just thought it 
                    might be refreshing to, you know, 
                    get wet.

      He cringes.                                                                                    67.


                                  NOAH (CONT D)
                    That didn t come out right either.

      Alison can t help it. She smiles. Then she stands up. 

                                  ALISON
                    It was nice bumping into you.

                                  NOAH
                    Can I at least walk you home?  



      Alison and Noah turn up the pebbled driveway that leads to 
      her house.

                                  NOAH
                    Wow. This is where you live? This 
                    place is great.

                                  ALISON
                    Thanks. 

                                  NOAH
                    When did you buy it?

                                  ALISON
                    My parents built it actually. It 
                    was their summer home.  

      Noah spots the outdoor shower adjacent to the side of the 
      house.

                                  NOAH
                    Is that an outdoor shower?

                                  ALISON
                    Yeah.

                                  NOAH
                    Oh man, I ve always wanted one of 
                    those.

                                  ALISON
                    Want to try it?



      Alison shows Noah the little wooden stall.

                                  NOAH
                    This is my idea of happiness.                                                                                    68.


                                  ALISON
                    Go ahead. Get wet.

      Noah grins.

                                  NOAH
                    No. I should go home.

      He turns to look at her. Stare at her, more accurately. She 
      smiles up at him. She doesn t mean to. It just keeps 
      happening.

                                  ALISON S VOICE
                    But he didn t feel like a new 
                    person. He felt like someone I had 
                    known a long time ago. And then 
                    lost track of.

                                  ALISON
                    Okay. Well, thanks for the walk.

      She puts out her hand to shake. He ignores it, moves in and 
      KISSES her on the cheek.

                                  NOAH
                    I guess I ll see you around town?

                                  ALISON
                    There s no real way to avoid it.

      Noah nods and heads up the driveway.

      Alison takes a deep breath, trying to calm her heartbeat. 
      Then she steps into the shower, turns on the hot water and 
      takes off her clothes.



      Alison exits the shower, wrapped in her towel just as Cole is 
      turning up the driveway, accompanied by a stunningly 
      beautiful, younger girl. They re both carrying boards. This 
      is his employee JOLENE, 25.

                                  COLE
                    Hey.

                                  ALISON
                    Hey. Hi Jolene.

                                  JOLENE
                    Oh my God, Alison. Cole told me 
                    what day it was and I just want to 
                    say, I am so sorry.                                                                                    69.


      Alison glares at Cole.

                                  COLE
                    What? Is it a secret?

                                  JOLENE
                    Did I say something wrong?

                                  COLE
                    No, Jo. You didn t. I ll see you 
                    tomorrow?

                                  JOLENE
                    Okay. Goodnight Alison.

                                  ALISON
                          (as pleasantly as she can)
                      Goodnight.

      Jolene heads off down the street. Cole walks slowly towards 
      Alison.

                                  COLE
                    She was just trying to be nice.

                                  ALISON
                    Fuck her if you want to. I don t 
                    care. Just don t make me watch.

      He stares at her in disbelief. Then he turns, PUNCHES a dent 
      in the hood of his truck.

      She JUMPS.

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                    Cole! Don t do that!

                                  COLE
                    Why not?!

                                  ALISON
                    Because you re scaring me!

                                  COLE
                    I m scaring you? I m scaring you??? 
                    I did everything you wanted. I read 
                    all the books. We went to the 
                      counselor. We went to the priest. I 
                    took you to that fucking shaman in 
                      Patagonia. I m trying, Alison.

                                  ALISON
                    I know.                                                                                    70.


                                  COLE
                    I wake up every day with his face 
                    in my head too. You re not the only 
                    one who lost a child. 

                                  ALISON
                    I know.

                                  COLE
                    How much longer are you going to 
                    treat me like I m the one who 
                    killed him? 

                                  ALISON
                          (stunned)
                    I don t.

                                  COLE
                    Yes you do. 

      A long pause. Then Alison goes over to him. She leans into 
      him. 

                                  ALISON
                    I m sorry.

      Cole doesn t respond.

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                    It hurts.

      Cole melts. He wraps his arms around her.

                                  COLE
                    I know it does, baby.

                                  ALISON
                    Make it stop.

                                  COLE
                    I don t know how.

      Alison reaches up and kisses Cole. He kisses her back, 
      gently. She kisses him harder. Hungry. Her hands move down 
      his body, into his trunks. He puts his fingers in her hair 
      and pulls her towards him gently, whispering in her ear -

                                  COLE (CONT D)
                    Let s go inside.

                                  ALISON
                    No.                                                                                    71.


      Alison puts both hands on Cole s chest and SHOVES him away 
      suddenly. He looks at her, confused. He reaches for her. She 
      SLAPS his hand.

      They stare at each other. Breathing hard.

      In one swift movement, Cole grabs Alison by both shoulders, 
      turns her around and pushes her against the hood of his car. 
      He bends her over onto her stomach, rips off her towel, and 
      enters her from behind.

                                  COLE
                    Is this what you wanted?

                                  ALISON
                    Yes.

      As Cole fucks her, Alison rests her head on the cold metal of 
      the car hood and looks out into the darkness. As usual, she 
      feels nothing.

      Suddenly, she GASPS.

      There, in the shadows, on the other side of the street, she 
      sees Noah. Watching. 

      His eyes bore into hers. He s not looking away. He s not 
      ashamed. He s just standing there, watching her with another 
      man. 

      As if it s all for him.

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                            (whispering)
                    Harder.

      Cole pounds into her harder. Noah doesn t break his gaze. 
      Alison has never done anything like this before. She s 
      terrified, but also, incredibly turned on. She FEELS 
      something start to build -

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                    Harder.

      Cole grabs her hips and slams himself into her. She closes 
      her eyes and lets the sensation overwhelm her. They come at 
      the same time.

      It s the first orgasm she s had in a year.

      Cole falls on top of her.

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                    Oh my God.                                                                                    72.


                                  COLE
                    Did you just - ?

                                  ALISON
                    Yeah. 

      Alison opens her eyes and looks out into the darkness. 

      Noah is gone.
