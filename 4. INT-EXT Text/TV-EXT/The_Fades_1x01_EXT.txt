          We establish on the town twinkling at night. 



          It s dark. Very dark. SARAH, wearing a scarf, shines a 
          torch around a street. 

                                            SARAH
                          I know you think this is ridiculous. But 
                        I - saw it - Neil. 

          She points a torch one way. She points a torch another. 

          She turns a blind corner and turns left and right.

                                            SARAH (CONT D)
                          Because they re coming Neil, I ve seen 
                        it.  

          SARAH frowns. 

                                            SARAH (CONT D)
                          HinkleyWay Shopping Centre - meet me 
                          there.   

          She hears the noise of a bin clattering. She points a 
          torch towards it. 

          Her torch hits a person. Crouched in the dark. He looks a 
          mess. It s POLUS. 

                                            SARAH (CONT D)
                          Hello?

          There is liquid all around him. It could be blood, it 
          could be rust. 

                                            SARAH (CONT D)
                        Neil. Hang on...

          She takes the phone from her ear but doesn t disconnect. 

          She looks again at POLUS. 

                                            SARAH (CONT D)
                        You OK?

          She approaches. 

          There is a sound. It s a sound we re going to hear a lot 
          of. The sound of something breathing without a throat. A 
          sound akin to a fish dying in the open air.                     THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  2



                                            SARAH (CONT D)
                        Are you... hurt? 


            POLUS  eyes are revealed - they burn amber. 

                                            SARAH (CONT D)
                        Can you...

          Suddenly POLUS turns and lunges straight at her. 

          There isn t even time for SARAH to scream. 

          The phone spins out of her hand and across the floor and 
          we spin with it. 

          We close on the phone. 

                                            NEIL (O.S.)
                          Sarah... Sarah... SARAH!

          And from that shout we crash into titles.

          PAUL enters the street and heads toward MAC, 17, geeky, 
          but with eyebrows you want to love. He doesn t look at 
          him.  

                                            PAUL
                        Beep. Beep. 

          MAC smiles at his passing friend. 

                                          MAC
                        Just so you know, I m not your dog. 

          PAUL gets on his bike. 

                                            PAUL
                          I know. 

          MAC picks up his bike. 

                                          MAC
                        Apart from in the American sense. I d be 
                        your  dawg - you know, your d-a-w-g. If 
                        you asked me nicely. 

                                            PAUL
                        I ll keep you in mind.  

                                          MAC
                        Brap. 

          MAC grins. PAUL starts to ride. MAC rides after him.   

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        Still crazy?                    THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  5



                                            PAUL
                        Still crazy. 

          We watch from the back of them. 

                                          MAC
                        Good to know. 

                                            PAUL
                          Always good to know. 

          We watch them ride off together. Music begins to play. 



          They ride their bikes through dirty grass under 
            fluorescent lights. 

          MAC fucksaround a bit. PAUL is steadier. 


          (19.15)

          They wind their way up and across the car park roof. 


          (19.16)

          MAC is trying to pry the boards open on the shopping 
            centre fixed entrance. 

          PAUL is holding the bikes. 

                                            PAUL
                        This is a bad idea. 

                                          MAC
                          Correction: This is a good idea with bad 
                          possibilities. 

                                            PAUL
                          ...What does that even...?

                                          MAC
                          Besides, you promised. It s my turn. 

                                            PAUL
                         You promised. It s my turn.  

                                          MAC
                         Neo, sooner or later you're going to 
                          realize just as I did that there's a 
                          difference between knowing the path and 
                          walking the path.                     THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  6



          The board is pried apart. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        We re in. 

          MAC enters. PAUL hesitates. Looks around. 



          NEIL carries SARAH toward the caravan.                  THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  14




            SARAH, stands alone in a world of... ash. Music plays - a 
          driving rhythm with an ethereal quality. 

          Ash flakes fall from the sky like snow. SARAH looks up at 
          them and scans the sky. 

          She puts her hand up to catch a piece of ash and the 
            images seem to slow as she does. 

          We close in on SARAH S face. She frowns, confused. 



          SARAH is alone, stumbling some more, unsure again. 



          PAUL stands in a world of ash just like the one SARAH was 
          just in. 

          A world of just ash. And he s alone in it. 

          Ash flakes fall from the sky like snow. 

          He frowns and puts his hand up to catch one. 



            Establish on a school. And a school sign -  StBarnabas
            Secondary School and Sixth Form College.  

          MAC and PAUL are amongst those thronging through the 
            school gates. 

          MAC is holding a bullet casing up to the light - 
          despite the crowd of kids around them. 

                                          MAC
                        This is a - bullet...

                                            PAUL
                          I know Mac, will you put it away?

          MAC turns and shouts at the top of his lungs. 

                                          MAC
                          MURDER. MURDER. I VE JUST BEEN SHOT!

          PAUL flinches away. No-one turns around or even looks 
          at them. MAC looks at them all - satisfied, but 
          slightly disappointed. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        Like any of them pay the slightest 
                          attention to what we do. We re the 
                          unwashed, we re the unwanted, we re 
                        the invisible in this school. 

          Someone spits on MAC s back as he passes. His friend high 
          fives him. MAC knows it s there. But ignores it.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  21



                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        And this is a bullet. And a slightly 
                        odd one I think. Which makes it even 
                        more exciting. 

          PAUL is really confused and his friend isn t helping. 

                                            PAUL
                        Not exciting...

          His sister ANNA passes him in the opposite direction. Her 
          eyes flare - she doesn t want to be acknowledged by PAUL - 
          not now - not here. 

            Beside her walks JAY, beautiful, 17. As they walk on by, 
          PAUL summons courage. 

                                            PAUL (CONT D)
                        Hi. Jay. 

          She turns to look at him - surprised. PAUL is equally 
            surprised the words have come out of his mouth. MAC 
            smiles - amused by all this. 

                                          JAY
                        What?

          And if her surprise wasn t bad enough... ANNA turns. 

                                            ANNA 
                          Fuckoff Paul. How we came out of the 
                        same egg is a mystery to me. 

                                            PAUL
                        Womb. We came out of the same womb. 
                        Egg and we d be - identical - twins - 
                        there are certain differences between 
                        us if you hadn t noticed. 

                                            ANNA
                        Yeah. You re retarded. 

          MAC laughs. ANNA sticks a finger up at him. And PAUL 
          and MAC push through the double doors. 



          NEIL, still looking just as unwashed and with an 
            improvised eyepatchover his eye (Sellotapeholding in 
          place some sort of padding), checks a rabbit trap and 
          pulls out a bird that s somehow been trapped inside it. 

          It s dead. 

          He looks at it closely, looking at it carefully for 
          signs of having been gnawed at by other animals.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  27



          He sees nothing. 

          He puts it in his satchel and continues across the 
            fields to home... which is a small caravan, dead ahead. 



          PAUL and MAC walk companionably along a street. 

                                          MAC
                        She loves you...

          He eats a crisp. 

                                            PAUL
                        Mac. 

                                          MAC
                        She loves you not...

          He eats a crisp. 

                                            PAUL
                        Mac. Really. 

                                          MAC
                        She loves you...

          He eats a crisp. 

                                            PAUL
                        Mac. You need to - stop. 

                                          MAC
                        She loves you not...

          He eats another crisp. 

                                            PAUL
                          I will use physical violence on you.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  34



                                          MAC
                        This is science. 

                                            PAUL
                        You need science. 

                                          MAC
                        And you need love MobyDick. 

          PAUL says nothing. MAC grins and reaches to take another 
            crisp. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        She loves you. 

          PAUL bangs on the underneath of the packet, the crisps 
          fly everywhere. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        Now that s just childish...



          NEIL walks a little bit ahead of PAUL. 

                                            NEIL
                        So how much can you see?

                                            PAUL
                        Of what?

                                            NEIL
                        Of the things you shouldn t. 

                                            PAUL
                        What things?

          NEIL turns and looks at PAUL. 

                                            PAUL (CONT D)
                            nuqDaq'oHpuchpa''e'? That s Klingonfor 
                           where s the bathroom ? You re making 
                          absolutely no sense. 

          NEIL looks at PAUL with a soft smile. 

                                            NEIL
                          Klingon. The kid speaks Klingon. 

                                            MARK (O.S.)
                        Neil.

          NEIL looks up and sees MARK, surprised. 

                                            NEIL
                          Mark...

          MARK looks from NEIL to PAUL. 

                                            MARK
                        With one of my students - hello Paul.

                        Hello Mr. Etches.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  39



          MARK looks steadily at NEIL. NEIL looks back. There s 
            animosity here. 

                                            NEIL
                        How s Sarah?

                                            MARK
                        She s fine. 

                                            NEIL
                        Good to - see you Mark. 

          Neither are sure it is good to see the other. 

                                            MARK
                        Yeah. Definitely. 

          NEIL and PAUL walk on.  

                                            PAUL
                        How do you know Mr. Etches?

                                            NEIL
                        Long - story. 

          NEIL checks his watch. And begins to walk. 

                                            NEIL (CONT D)
                          Come-on we re going to be late. 

                                            PAUL
                        For what?

          PAUL thinks and then runs slightly to catch him up. 



          NEIL sits on the edge of the roof. PAUL thinks and then 
            copies him. It s some drop. 

                                            NEIL
                        Close your eyes. 

          PAUL thinks and then does that. 

                                            NEIL (CONT D)
                        Just concentrate on my voice. Empty your 
                        head of everything but my voice. Now open 
                        your eyes. 

          PAUL does. 

                                            NEIL (CONT D)
                        They like height - when organic matter 
                          passes through them they burn. 
                                            (MORE)                  THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  40


                                            NEIL (CONT D)
                        So you ll see them on roof tops, on bus 
                          shelters, walking down the middle of the 
                        road, cars are fine, being winged by a 
                        car - that doesn t hurt. So look for them 
                        on ledges on - 

          We watch with Paul s eyes. His eyes blur as the screen 
          does. Then things start to focus. Blurs become semi-
            transparent shapes. That slowly become people - Fade 
          people. On the top of buildings, sign posts, telephone 
            boxes, in the middle of the street... everywhere and 
          anywhere where the general public are not.  

          PAUL is amazed at the number and the complexity. 

                                            PAUL
                        What are they?

                                            NEIL
                          They re the dead. And they re trapped 
                        here. 

            PAUL s eyes grow wide. 

                                            PAUL
                          They re - the dead?

          NEIL looks at PAUL. Who is staring at what is below him. 

                                            NEIL
                        When people die... 

                                            PAUL
                          They re - dead?

                                            NEIL
                        When people die - they go up or they stay 
                        here - some go up - some stay here. These 
                        are those that stay here. We call them 
                        The Fades. 

                                            PAUL
                          They re - just - trapped here. 

                                            NEIL
                        If they don t ascend - yeah. 

                                            PAUL
                        So these are bad people? The people left 
                        over - the ones that go up are going to 
                          heaven right? 

                                            NEIL
                        Good? Bad? Why people believe death is 
                          somehow fair... Death is random - same as 
                        life is. Life has famine, illness, 
                          shitness. Death is similarly crap. That s 
                        why the problem exists.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  41



                                            PAUL
                        The problem?

                                            NEIL
                          Imagine being trapped in a world you 
                        can t touch, you can t taste... hate 
                          grows. Those left behind - get - shitty. 

                                            PAUL
                        And that s what... So that man I saw 
                          attacking you was a - shittyghost?

          NEIL considers how to answer this. 

                                            NEIL
                        No. He was something new. 

                                            PAUL
                        And you - what are you? Are you a - 
                          Ghostbuster?

          NEIL turns to PAUL and smiles. 

                                            NEIL
                                  (ironic)
                        Yeah kid. I m a Ghostbuster.

          NEIL smiles at PAUL, who is not smiling back.

                                            NEIL (CONT D)
                          I m... We re an ancient order. Some call 
                        us angelics.I don t. We exist to protect 
                        those that need protecting - from things 
                        we don t - can t - understand. Disputes 
                          between the dead. Ascension points. We 
                          protect and we keep the balance. 

                                            PAUL
                        How?

          NEIL considers how to answer this question. 

                                            NEIL
                        With - weapons - we ve adapted guns which 
                        are organically treated so as to hurt 
                        them. Stun them. But mostly - with our 
                          powers. We are - blessed - in some way - 
                        I ve a friend who heals, I ve another - 
                        she is a - was a - seer. 

                                            PAUL
                        And you? What do you do?

          NEIL doesn t like this question. 

                                            NEIL
                        I m - complicated.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  42



          NEIL thinks about saying more, but doesn t. 

                                            PAUL
                        And none of this stuff... None of this 
                        stuff is in my head?

          NEIL grins. 

                                            NEIL
                            Ghostbuster shonour.

                                            PAUL
                        Yeah. But you could be mad too. Or in my 
                        head - too. 

          They sit on the edge of the car park. Watching the sun 
          fade. 

                                            NEIL
                        Good point. That s more than possible. 

          Out on PAUL. 



          PAUL stands in a world of ash. 

          A world of just ash. 

          Ash flakes fall from the sky like snow. 

          He puts his hand up to catch one. 

          He looks about himself - he starts to walk. He walks 
          towards a hill in the distance. 

          Looking around, all the time, scared - he sees a derelict 
            broken telephone box on the floor beside him. He stares 
          at it - surprised. 

          Then. Big surprise. The mist clearing slightly - he sees 
          someone standing looking at him. This is JOHN. We won t 
          know who he is until later. 

                                            PAUL
                          Hello...?

          JOHN looks at him and then turns and starts to run. 

                                            PAUL (CONT D)
                        No... No... Don t run...

          PAUL follows. But then he trips on something, he looks to 
          see what it is. It s a - hand. It s a human hand. 
          Sticking out of the dust.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  43



          He looks at it - aghast. 



          PAUL is moving fast, he s late. He s running.  

          He turns a corner...

          To see a FADE GIRL in the middle of the underpass in 
          front of him. A teenage FADE GIRL we may recognise from 
          the attack on Neil, and who ll we ll later know as 
          Natalie. Again skinny, too skinny, again starving, again 
            almost black and white. But this time with a listless 
          look in its eyes. 

          PAUL swerves to avoid her but can t. 

          He ploughs straight through her body. 

          The FADE GIRL screams - PAUL screams - and THE FADE 
            GIRL s skin burns and then just like that PAUL is through 
          her.

          He turns back, she s gone. He touches the air where she s 
          been with a studied look on his face. 

          Then PAUL takes a breath - takes another breath - and 
          tries to get control of his breathing. Then he walks 
          away. 

          And the re-appropriated FADE GIRL watches him. An 
            interested look on her face. 



          PAUL sits bum-sucking a cigarette on a park bench. 

          He s so consumed that he doesn t notice JAY approach. 

                                          JAY
                          Didn t know you smoked...?

          PAUL is really surprised to see her. He doesn t know what 
          to say. This girl makes him nervous.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  46



                                            PAUL
                        Yeah? 

                                          JAY
                        Yeah. 

          PAUL tries to think of something to say. 

                                            PAUL
                        I m just learning. 

          He winces, regretting the remark. 

                                            PAUL (CONT D)
                          I mean, yeah, I m just learning... I 
                        tried to write L on the cigarette in my 
                          sister s lipstick but...

          JAY looks at him and smiles. 

                                          JAY
                        Well, you re bum-sucking the shit out of 
                        that, filter must be soaking...

          She takes the cigarette out of his mouth and moves her 
          lips carefully around it. She inhales and exhales. 

                                          JAY (CONT D)
                        See?

          PAUL nods and takes the cigarette back. He tries to smoke 
          how she showed him. 

                                          JAY (CONT D)
                        You heard about the thing at the old 
                          shopping centre?

                                            PAUL
                        No. 

                                          JAY
                          There s police all around it. Everyone s 
                          talking about it in school - current 
                          theory is someone got raped...

                                            PAUL
                        Yeah?

                                          JAY
                        Yeah. AndAlicia s been off school. 

                                            PAUL
                        Yeah? Alicia? Yeah. 

          She turns and looks at him.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  47



                                          JAY
                        You OK? You seem weirder than ever...

                                            PAUL
                        Oh. Yeah. Yeah, I m just... trying to 
                          decide if I m mental or not. 

                                          JAY
                        What are your odds?

          JAY laughs. PAUL looks at her and smiles - he loves her 
            smile. 

                                            PAUL
                        My sister would kill you she even sees 
                        you talking to me...

                        She d probably kill you too. She s into 
                        her - she doesn t believe in the inter-
                          mingling of the species - even if it s 
                        just talking. 

          PAUL isn t sure what  just talking  means. But he likes 
          the tone of what she s saying.  

                                            PAUL
                          I guess you re all off out tonight...

                                          JAY
                        We re all off out every night. Up the 
                          woods. Only thing to do round here. 

                                            PAUL
                        Yeah. I guess so. Just be careful of the - 
                        you know - rapist. 

          JAY smiles at PAUL and his weirdo comment. 

                                          JAY
                          You re not mental. You re just different. 

                                            PAUL
                          That s what my Mum said...

                                          JAY
                        Your Mum s wicked. 

                                            PAUL
                        ...As she cleaned me up from whoever 
                          bullied me.  Oh Paul, someone s squirted 
                          tomato ketchup all over you, they re just 
                          scared of difference.   Oh Paul, 
                          someone s emptied a bin on your head, 
                          they re just scared of... . 

          JAY laughs lightly.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  48



                                          JAY
                          I always wanted to be different. 

          She turns and looks at PAUL. 

                                          JAY (CONT D)
                        I was a bit of a hairbrush princess, you 
                        know - think I m a popstar. I don t know - 
                        my Dad thinks I m better than everyone 
                        so...

                                            PAUL
                        Well. I ve - never - wanted to be 
                          different.  

                                          JAY
                        Maybe I don t mean you re different. 
                        Maybe I mean special. 

          PAUL looks at her. 

                                            PAUL
                          You re the second one who s said 
                          something like that...

          JAY looks at him carefully for a moment - does she like 
          him too? 

                                          JAY
                        Got the taste of your spit in my mouth 
                          now...

                                            PAUL
                        Yeah?

          She smiles at him. 

                                          JAY
                          You ve got nice eyes - in this light. 

          PAUL flushes and then tries to think of an eloquent 
            response. He fails. 

                                            PAUL
                        Yeah?

          She smiles. Then she thinks better of being here further, 
          takes the cigarette again and has another tug. 

                                          JAY
                          Better go. 

          He hesitates a second - forming words in his mouth he 
          will never say. She grins at the effort. 

                                            PAUL
                          Right.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  49



          And JAY walks off. 

          PAUL stares after her. Thinks, and then finally calls 
          out. 

                                            PAUL (CONT D)
                          You ve got nice eyes too. 

          She doesn t turn around. 

                                          JAY
                          I know. 

          PAUL smiles and turns back to his cigarette. 

          She picks up her bike and cycles off. 

          PAUL watches her with a shy smile. 



          MAC stands practising with a yo-yo. He s doing badly with 
          it. 

          PAUL comes out of the house. 

          His phone rings. He looks who it is, he smiles and throws 
          the phone to MAC who catches it impressively. 

          And then answers. 


                                          MAC
                        ....I know... Oh, I ll make sure he gets 
                        his protein Meg. Mum. Meg. I m a big fan 
                        of protein... 

          PAUL pushes MAC in a friendly way. They keep walking. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        Yeah. You too.

          MAC disconnects. And throws it back to PAUL, who fumbles 
          the catch. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                          Parental quicksand?

            A dead bird falls from the trees behind them. Neither of 
          them notice it. 

                                            PAUL
                          Something like that...                  THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  54



          MAC smiles and taps his knee with his hand. 

                                          MAC
                        Well, you know the only way to escape 
                        quick sand is by raising your legs slowly 
                        until you re lying on your back - on your 
                          actual back. Then you ll just float. 
                        Takes balls but it s possible. 

          MAC looks at PAUL, slightly more seriously. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        You OK?

                                            PAUL
                        Yeah. 

                                          MAC
                          I mean... the Heather Langenkampstuff...

                                            PAUL
                          I knew what you meant. 

          They walk in silence a bit longer. They walk past a bin. 
          MAC dumps the yo-yo inside, then turns and walks 
            backwards in front of PAUL.  

                                          MAC
                          Because I ve had a thought - 

                                            PAUL
                        What thought?

          MAC does a bit of a moonwalk. 

                                          MAC
                        The Sixth Sense. 

          PAUL laughs, despite himself, won over my his friends 
          nagging insistence. 

                                            PAUL
                        Would you say everything you ve ever 
                          learnt about was from films Mac?

          Another bird drops from the trees behind them. 

          MAC turns front and starts walking normally while giving 
          this notion serious consideration. 

                                          MAC
                        No. Television been doing some important 
                        work for me recently. And then there s 
                        the whole complicated - nay, thorny - 
                        issue of internet pornography...                  THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  55




          A bunch of kids are sitting around a couple of lanterns 
          drinking some sort of homebrew. 

          Amongst them are TRACY, JAY and ANNA, dancing in the 
          sunset. STEVE watches them. And we watch as if from a 
            distance. 



          Further off, PAUL and MAC lying on their bellies, watch 
          the kids enviously. 

          PAUL watches JAY particularly closely. 

                                          MAC
                          Admittedly, for the isolated incidents 
                        they show in the film, maybe Bruce 
                          Williscould have been a ghost for 
                        those -

            A bird drops down from the sky, neither of them notice. 
          If they did, they d notice five birds, all dead, all in 
          the same spot. 

                                            PAUL
                        That bit with his wife and the wedding 
                        ring, I like that bit. 



          ANNA sits on the lap of STEVE, a beefy looking guy. 

          ANNA snuggles into STEVE s lap. She s playing drunk but 
          quite enjoying it. 



          MAC lies considering. PAUL lies watching JAY.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  56



                                          MAC
                        But what about the rest of his life? 
                        The bits the film doesn t show? I 
                        mean, what if he felt like a coffee... 
                        He walks into your standard American 
                        brand coffee place...

          MAC plays Bruce.

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                         Hi, I d like a coffee please . No 
                          answer.  Excuse me, but I d like a cup 
                        of coffee . No answer. 

          PAUL suddenly notices SARAH. Now a Fade. And with a light 
            emanating from her chest. 

                                          MAC (CONT'D)
                        They can t see him. He s a ghost. 
                        Well, eventually, he s going to be 
                          pretty - you know - annoyed. 

                                            PAUL
                        Yeah. OK. 

          Another bird drops dead.  

                                          MAC
                        It s a fatal flaw. 

          SARAH begins to walk away. She glances over her 
          shoulder to PAUL. PAUL stands as if to follow her.  

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                           Hello, hello, where s my coffee . I 
                          mean... like he hasn t guessed he s a 
                          ghost. Bruce Willis looks like a man who 
                        likes coffee. 

          MAC checks his friend s face. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        You OK Paul? 

            Behind them NEIL appears, he s been following SARAH, he 
          ducks out of view. Then he spies out, and is very 
            surprised to see PAUL - again. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        Who s here?

          PAUL says nothing. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        What is it? Where is it?                  THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  57



          We watch with MAC s eyes as PAUL decides and then 
            scrambles to follow SARAH. Another bird drops dead. 

          MAC is left following behind. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        Paul. Wait up. I haven t finished my 
                          theory -  

          PAUL breaks into a run. 

          MAC tries to follows, but then trips over a tree root 
          and lands face first in the dirt. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                          Paul... Paul!

          NEIL runs past MAC. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        And who the fuck are you?

          NEIL keeps on going. MAC realiseshe s alone. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        This is going to happen a lot isn t it?

          Another bird drops dead. Narrowly missing MAC. He looks 
          up, enraged. And then resigned. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        Good point. Well made. 

          PAUL - his face concentrating - his mind alert - makes 
          his way fast through the trees behind SARAH. 

          NEIL follows him - weaving between the trees. 



          But another force is moving faster and harder than PAUL 
          and NEIL. 

          We just catch kinetic glimpses. Maybe it s clear it s 
            POLUS. Maybe it isn t. 



          SARAH keeps walking. Another bird drops dead. 

                                            NEIL (O.S.)
                        So - you ve made your decision then?

          PAUL turns wildly to face NEIL. Who is looking only at 
          him. 

                                            PAUL
                        You again. 

                                            NEIL
                        Me again. 

                                            PAUL
                        Who - is she?

                                            NEIL
                          Sarah. Her name is Sarah. 

                                            PAUL
                        She s a friend?

          SARAH turns and looks at NEIL. 

                                            SARAH
                        Look after Mark for me. 

          NEIL nods at her. 

                                            PAUL
                        They can talk?

                                            NEIL
                        She can right now. 

          PAUL looks back at SARAH. 

                                            NEIL (CONT D)
                        She s looking for a place to pass. This 
                          wood s about one of the only places in 
                        this country not fucked with enough to 
                        still have passing places...

          More birds fall from the sky. 

                                            PAUL
                        What?



          More kinetic movement, more POLUS.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  59




                                            NEIL
                        There are holes in the world. Ascension 
                          points. There used to be loads. Then man 
                          invented concrete and... There s another. 

          NEIL indicates an older woman looking about herself 
            anxiously. She s in a nightgown. She has a glow in her 
            chest. She looks lost. 

          PAUL has too many questions. 

                                            PAUL
                        What are those - lights - in their chest?

                                            NEIL
                          They re beacons - when the dead near 
                          ascension their - souls - shine. Those 
                        that pass, that light lltake over their 
                        body with a bang. Those that don t, the 
                        light turns off and they know they re 
                          trapped here - forever. 

                                            PAUL
                        So this is about - ascension - this is 
                        about - heaven?

          NEIL turns. Surprised by the use of that word. 

                                            NEIL
                        You know, I ve got a friend who s going 
                        to really like meeting you. She s into 
                        the quasi-religious shit too. 

                                            PAUL
                        What?

                                            NEIL
                          Heaven s a big word. This is about death 
                        kid. Only death. 

          Off PAUL. 



          More birds fall. NEIL uses his jacket to try and shield 
          him and PAUL. 

                                            NEIL
                          Fucking birds. 

          PAUL looks up at him. NEIL decides to explain. 

                                            NEIL (CONT D)
                          Collateral damage. 

          PAUL stumbles, NEIL doesn t notice. 

                                            PAUL
                        Will any of this ever make sense?

          NEIL considers this. 

                                            NEIL
                          Probably not. 

                                            PAUL
                        Do you know how much danger you re in - 
                        we re in?

                                            NEIL
                          Probably a lot. 

          PAUL has a moment where something passes across his face. 
          He almost loses his balance, but rights himself. 



          SARAH s light turns out, she looks at it - slightly 
            aghast - then at NEIL. 

                                            NEIL
                        Oh shit.

                                            SARAH
                          Neil... Neil...

                                            NEIL
                        She s not going... She s not passing.

                                            PAUL
                        What?

            A tear rolls down SARAH s face. 

                                            NEIL
                        I m sorry Sarah. I m sorry. 

          PAUL wobbles again. He steadies himself again. 

                                            PAUL
                        It is... I sort of...

          PAUL falls backwards and begins to fit.

          NEIL runs towards him. 

                                            NEIL
                          Paul... Paul...



          On the roof of the Caravan, POLUS - his hands and face 
          covered in blood - makes a noise like death.  



          NEIL tries to shield a fitting PAUL as a torrent of birds 
          fall from the sky.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  62




          PAUL is running through ash and rubble. He s following 
          JOHN. 

                                            PAUL
                          Wait... please wait... who are you?

          JOHN stops at a ridge in front of PAUL, smiling down on 
          him.

                                            JOHN
                        No time to stop. 

          PAUL looks at him - now horrified. 

                                            PAUL
                        What is this - place?  

          He looks down on the other side of the ridge. 

          It s become a wasteland of nothing. It s a total 
            apocalypse. And on the floor in front of him lie the 
          corpses of MAC and NEIL.  

          PAUL looks at the bodies and looks at the wasteland - we 
          close hard on his eyes as he takes in the horror. What 
          does this mean?



            PAUL S awakens. He looks up at the worried looking NEIL. 
          And behind him a worried looking SARAH. 

                                            NEIL
                        What did you see? Look at me. Paul. 

          PAUL looks around. There are dead birds all around them. 

                                            NEIL (CONT D)
                        Look at me Paul. What did you see?

          We close on PAUL s face.
