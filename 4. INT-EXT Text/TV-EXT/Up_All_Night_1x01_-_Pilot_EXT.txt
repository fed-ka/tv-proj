      It s a downtown, loft-like building.  Soho-esque.


      Reagan bursts out of the door as a miffed ASIAN GUY from the 
      karaoke joint stares.

                                  REAGAN

      Reagan and Will spend the whole morning with Amy.  

      They have breakfast.  Amy eats scrambled eggs with her 
      fingers.

      They stroll through the park with their dog, Gene.      UNTITLED EMILY SPIVEY "Pilot" 34.


      Amy sleeps in the sunlight.  Reagan and Will sit on swings 
      with coffees.  They are talking, Will says something and they 
      burst into laughter.

                                                                                CUT TO:
