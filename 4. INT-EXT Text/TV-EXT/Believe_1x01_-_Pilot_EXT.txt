      A VOLVO STATION WAGON arrives at the prison gate.  


      Dimly lit.  The Van cruises up to a HERCULES CARGO PLANE, 
      propellers already whirring, the back door open.  

      The van doors open and Santos pulls Tate out.  Still wearing 
      the hood, he stands there-- when suddenly a HIGH PRESSURE 
      HOSE starts dousing him with water, almost knocking him down.

                                  TATE
                    Whoa!  Stop!

      Reveal Channing is the one doing the hosing.  Gibbs and 
      Santos get him up and take the hood off.  He and Channing 
      exchange a look: it s the first time he s seen her.

                                  TATE (CONT D)
                    Nice to meet you too.

      The Volvo also arrives and Winter gets out.  He s upbeat, 
      removing his priest collar as he walks.  He smiles at Tate.

                                  WINTER
                    We re gonna fly for a couple of 
                    hours and we ll talk.  Some real 
                    clothes, some real food.  How s 
                    that for a plan?

      Tate agrees and they walk forward.  Winter notices his 
      handcuffs.  He turns to Channing.

                                  WINTER (CONT D)
                    I didn t ask for those.

                                  TATE
                    She s a little exuberant.

                                  CHANNING
                    You don t know me at all.

                                  WINTER
                          (to Channing)
                    Take them off.

      She reluctantly removes Tate s cuffs.  Tate boards the plane 
      with Santos.  Winter follows, but Channing grabs his arm and 
      pulls him back.  She s respectful... but insistent.

                                  CHANNING
                    Sir.  He s a death row inmate.

                                  WINTER
                    He claims he didn t do it.                                                                                    17.


                                  CHANNING
                    They all say that!  Why him?  Why 
                    take the chance?  

      Her emotions slightly get the better of her.  She seems more 
      hurt than angry... did Winter pass her over?  He s sensitive.

                                  WINTER
                    You ve been loyal.  I appreciate 
                    that.  But it s the right call.  
                    Some day you ll understand why.

      No more time to discuss-- they ve got to go.  Winter boards 
      the plane and Channing, dissatisfied, follows.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      A large party is underway for a glittering new high rise.  On 
      the phone: THEO SKOURAS (50s).  Black tie, tanned, athletic, 
        charismatic.  It s hard to say no to him, and you wouldn t 
      want to, either.

                                    SKOURAS
                    The girl is in LA Hospital.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Establishing.


      The cargo plane LANDS.  As the doors of the plane open, an 
      AMBULANCE is waiting.  

      Channing and Santos push the stretcher (carrying Tate) out of 
      the plane towards the back of the ambulance with Gibbs now 
      behind the wheel-- all three in EMT UNIFORMS now.                                                                                     25.


      Tate tries to lean up and see, and we note that his face and 
      arms are covered with fake bruises and blood.  Channing puts 
      an oxygen mask on his face and pushes him back down.   

      As they get to the ambulance and are about to load, Winter is 
      there.  He looks down at Tate.

                                  WINTER
                    This may be the most important day 
                    of your life.  Exciting, isn t it?

                                  TATE
                          (wearing the mask)
                    [garbled]

      Based on his tone, he probably wasn t saying  yes it s 
      exciting.   Winter smiles and touches him on the shoulder.

                                  WINTER
                    Good luck.

      The stretcher goes up into the ambulance and Winter walks to 
      a car as the ambulance pulls away, all wailing sirens and 
      flashing gumballs.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Moore is on the phone, walking in small circles in the 
      parking lot:                                                                                    26.


                                  MOORE
                          (into phone)
                    What do you mean I m trying to kill 
                    you?  
                          (listens)
                    It s just one day, Mom!  You can t 
                    get sick from a day old sheet cake!  
                          (listens)
                    I know it has custard in it--

      She looks and sees DOCTOR TRACY ELLIOT (40s, black) nod 
      goodbye to a few EMPLOYEES then heads towards her car.  

      We FOLLOW HER as she pulls off her white lab coat, she s 
      exhausted, BEEPS her keys to unlock her fancy ride as Moore 
      hurries to catch up with her, still on the phone--  

                                  MOORE (CONT D)
                    Excuse me, Doctor?  Do you have a 
                    second?
                          (into phone)
                    Look I ll call you back--

      The Doctor turns, not thrilled, we STAY on her--

                                  DOCTOR ELLIOT
                    Yes?

                                  MOORE
                    I have a question.  I have this--
                          (into phone)
                    Mom go.  Go watch Bravo.  Go.  I 
                    don t know.  Two something.  Use 
                    the guide.

      Moore hanging up as we still hear the CHIRPING.

                                  MOORE (CONT D)
                    Argh!!  Sorry.  My mother.  The 
                    guilt, you know?  What s that thing 
                    that comes out in the shower? 

                                  DOCTOR ELLIOT
                          (baffled)
                    Mold?

                                  MOORE
                    Right.  It s like mold.

      Doctor Elliot is a little rattled... by Moore being rattled.

                                  DOCTOR ELLIOT
                    Look, uh, I m really exhausted, I m 
                    sure someone inside can help you--                                                                                     27.


                                  MOORE
                    Right.  Sorry to bother you.  

      Doctor Elliot nods politely, relieved the exchange is over... 
      she turns towards her car and Moore DARTS towards her--

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Traffic slows as the ambulance exits the freeway and heads 
      into the maze of streets in DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES.


      Doctor Elliot is bound and gagged and making muffly noises.  
      Moore wears her hospital coat and looks down at her in the 
      open trunk.

                                  MOORE
                    I just want to say that I think 
                    athletes aren t the real American 
                    heroes.  Doctors are.

      Then she SLAMS the trunk on her and walks away.


      The hospital in the background as Moore walks towards us, 
      unbuttoning the doctor coat with one hand, phone to her ear 
      with the other. 

                                  MOORE
                    You didn t tell me they were 
                    sending someone.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Moore approaches her car.  

                                  MOORE
                    I was outnumbered.  I need intel 
                    and support.

                                    SKOURAS
                    Fine.  Call them.

      She hangs up.  Gets in her car.  

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    40.



      Tate looks both directions.  She s gone.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    42.



      Tate goes from shop window to shop window-- and sees Bo in A 
      SMALL ELECTRONICS STORE on a computer.   


      Bo walks away from the store.  Still irritated.

                                  BO
                    We have to go to 1147 Oswald 
                    Street.

                                  TATE
                    What are you talking about?

                                  BO
                    I have to tell Cortez about Senga.

                                  TATE
                    Can you stop with that?

      Suddenly a CAR SCREECHES to a stop in front of them.  Santos 
      leaps out, expecting Tate won t come easily--

                                  BO
                    Channing!

      Channing smiles at Bo but then leans out:

                                  CHANNING
                          (to Tate)
                    Get in!

      Tate and Bo hurry to the car and it quickly pulls away. 


      A working class neighborhood, a house in some disrepair.  The 
      number says 1147.  Cortez (wearing a hoodie) unlocks the 
      front door and enters.


      An area of the city with warehouses, empty lots, etc.  An OLD 
      WOODEN GATE rises and Channing s car disappears into the 
      garage of an INDUSTRIAL BUILDING.


      Residential area of SMALL HOUSES.  Tate and Bo walking-- he s 
      favoring his side.  He pulls out the money Winter gave him-- 
      wet with blood. 

                                  TATE
                    120 bucks for the next seven years.  
                    That ll work.  
                          (to Bo)
                    Winter told you where to go, right?

                                  BO
                    Right.  

      They walk.

                                  TATE
                    That thing back there.  How did you 
                    do that?

                                  BO
                    What do you mean?

                                  TATE
                    That thing with the birds.  What 
                    was that?  Does it happen a lot?

                                  BO
                    I don t want to talk about it.  

      She stops-- they ve arrived outside Cortez s house.  She 
      approaches the door and RINGS the bell.  Tate follows.

                                  TATE
                    Will they give us more dough here?

                                  BO
                    You mean for cookies?

                                  TATE
                    What?

      Cortez answers the door.  Bo smiles.

                                  BO
                    Cortez!

                                  TATE
                          (realizing)
                    Oh come on Bo let s go...                                                                                     58.


                                  CORTEZ
                          (to Bo)
                    What are you doing here?

                                  BO
                    I need to talk to you about Senga.  
                    And my friend needs help.  

      Bo lifts up his shirt to show the wound.  Cortez looks a 
      little intimidated by Tate, but his medical instincts kick in 
      and he begins to inspect it.

                                  CORTEZ
                    Whoa.  What happened there?

                                  BO
                    A mean woman shot him.

                                  CORTEZ
                    You were shot?

                                  TATE
                    It s nothing, I m fine.

                                  BO
                          (to Tate)
                    He s a doctor.  A really good 
                    doctor.

      Bo looks at Cortez, who appreciates the words but hesitates.

                                  CORTEZ
                    If you ve been shot, we have to 
                    report it to the police.

                                  TATE
                    Can you stop the bleeding first?  
                    I d appreciate that.

      Cortez nods and helps him inside.


      Tate wears Cortez s hoodie as they stand there.  Tate looks 
      both ways on the street as the sun sets.

                                  TATE
                    Okay now where do we really go?

                                  BO
                    Bus station.  Flat Dune, Nevada.

      Tate nods.  He sees Bo is still looking up at the house.

                                  TATE
                    Look that was very touching.  But 
                    if this is going to work when we go 
                    to a new town, we re going to need 
                    some rules, okay?

                                  BO
                    Okay.

                                  TATE
                    Number one.  That doctor guy wasn t 
                    your business.  You re nosy.

                                  BO
                    But he fixed you.

                                  TATE
                    Yeah that was fine and all, but 
                    when we get somewhere you need to 
                    mind your own business.

      Bo looks at Tate skeptically.

                                  BO
                    What if a girl falls into a river?

                                  TATE
                    I don t care.  Now promise.

      They start walking as our song from the opening -- FEIST S 
      1234 -- starts up in a FULLY ARRANGED VERSION we:

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    62.



      Moore approaches.  The car is empty.  REVERSE POV to VERY FAR 
      AWAY-- as Channing and Winter watch her from a bluffside.

      BACK TO MOORE: looking up, and around... she gets it. 


      The song KEEPS ON PLAYING and we follow FROM BEHIND as Tate 
      and Bo approach the bus station...

                                  BO
                    What s rule number two?

                                  TATE
                    Always do what I say.

      Bo thinks about it.                                                                                    64.


                                  BO
                    Okay.  But what if we re in an 
                    igloo and you have a cold and can t 
                    smell anything, and you tell me to 
                    light a candle but I smell gas?

                                                                            CUT TO:


      The song ends as Tate and Bo board the bus together.
