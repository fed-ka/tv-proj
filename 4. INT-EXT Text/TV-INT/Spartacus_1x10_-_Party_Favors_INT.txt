  SPARTACUS stares out at the arena through the gate as the 
  CROWD chants his name in anticipation.

                                        CROWD (O.S.)
                        SPAR-TA-CUS!  SPAR-TA-CUS!

  VARRO joins his side.

                                        VARRO
                        They roar your name.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Soon they shall roar yours as well.

  Varro nods, obviously preoccupied.  Spartacus frowns.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                      Or mourn it, if your mind is absent 
                        the task.

                                        VARRO
                        I have yet to have word on my wife 
                        and son --

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I will not fight alongside a man 
                        who is not clear to his purpose.

  Varro hardens with a grim smile.

                                        VARRO
                        I am clear. My purpose is blood.


  NIGHT

  DURO crashes to the ground, sent there by his brother AGRON 
  while they spar.  Agron snorts in disgust.

                                        AGRON
                        Get up.

  The exterior gate SWINGS OPEN, pulling his attention to 
  Spartacus, Varro, DOCTORE and other Gladiators returning 
  from the games.  CHEERS erupt for the triumphant heroes.  

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    6.
  CONTINUED:

  All the men that didn't fight rush over to hear today's 
  tales from the arena.

  CRIXUS,

  bitter as fuck that he didn't fight today, doesn't join 
  them. He hangs back, striking a palus with contempt.  ASHUR, 
  unable to resist a little passive aggressiveness, sidles up 
  as he surveys the boisterous scene.

                                        ASHUR
                      It pains me to watch others claim 
                        your laurels.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Your pain shall increase if you 
                        continue to stand beside me.

  Ashur moves off with a barely contained smile, passing Varro 
  and Spartacus.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You fought well today.

                                        VARRO
                        The gods favored me, to count you 
                      as ally.

  Something catches Spartacus' eye behind Varro.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Their favor extends beyond the 
                        arena...

  Varro turns to find his wife AURELIA and his son JANUS being 
  led into the MESS HALL by MIRA and a GUARD.  Her belly shows 
  slight evidence of her pregnancy's progression.

                                        VARRO
                        Aurelia...

  Varro rushes over, tears of joy filling his eyes as he 
  sweeps them up into his arms.

  SPARTACUS

  catches Mira's eye, graces her with a smile of gratitude. 
  Mira returns the smile and moves off into the villa.

                                          VARRO(cont'd)
                        I feared I would never hold you 
                        again. Ashur said he found only

                        message...

                                          AURELIA
                        Titus had returned.

                                        VARRO
                        Did he hurt you?  I will see his 
                        heart from his fucking chest --

                                          AURELIA
                        The blood was not mine.
                                (off Varro's 
                                  confusion)
                        I cut him, deep and low.  He will 
                        never force himself on a woman 
                        again. Afterwards I sought refuge 
                        with my brother's family, in the 
                        hills.  The slave girl found me 
                        there, by Spartacus  direction.

                                        VARRO
                        Thank the gods you are safe.

                                          AURELIA
                        Where were they when Titus first 
                        laid hands on me?  I still carry 
                        his child. Nothing has changed, 
                        Varro.

                                        VARRO
                        The entire world has changed.  And 
                        I along with it.

  Varro looks into Aurelia's sorrowful eyes, regretting how 
  much pain he has caused her.

                                          VARRO(cont'd)
                        The child.  It springs from your 
                        belly, a part of you. I would love 
                      it as such... if you would have it 
                        so.

  Tears fill her eyes as he takes her in his arms, finding 
  warm comfort there once again.  OFF the reunion...



  Incense burns.  Smoke lulls thick in the stillness of the 
  air.  ADJUST TO FIND ILITHYIA sitting on the edge of the 
  bed. Eyes distant, hair disheveled.  Sleep has obviously 
  evaded her for many nights.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    8.

  Ilithyia looks to the doorway.  Lucretia looms there.

                        I could not face prying eyes.  One

                        full knowledge.  Licinia's blood...

  Lucretia presses a list of names into Ilithyia's hands.

  Lucretia exits.  OFF ILITHYIA as she begins to realize the 
  cost of such a "friendship"...



  A SLAVE scrapes the dirt off Spartacus.  Varro enters, moves 
  excitedly to Spartacus.

                                        VARRO
                        I owe you more than I can ever

  They glance over to find Crixus, forced to scrape himself 
  with the rest of the lower men.

  HECTOR the guard enters, interrupting Crixus  angry

  OFF CRIXUS, his hatred for Spartacus barely contained...



  Spartacus and Crixus stand before Batiatus. Spartacus 
  registers surprise at the news he has just received.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      We are to fight each other?

                        Numerius has chosen.  He would 
                        drink in the spectacle of present 
                        glories pitted against past.

  Crixus grins, sensing the opportunity to regain his status.

  Batiatus clocks his over-exuberance.

                        Keep to mind this is an exhibition. 
                        Blood may be spilled -- for show 
                        only. Serious injuries will pale to 
                        the punishment of the man who 
                        causes them.

  Hector starts to move them off.

  Crixus leaves begrudgingly, feeling the sting of exclusion 
  as he exits.  Batiatus strolls, Spartacus in tow.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        The ego bruises deeper than the 
                        flesh.

  Batiatus nods, considering that.

                                        BATIATUS
                      He brought this house great honor, 
                        not so long ago.  Do not overly 
                        embarrass the man.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I will give Numerius a show.  
                        Nothing more.

                                        BATIATUS
                        When I put on the Toga Virilis, it 
                        was in this very room, surrounded 
                      by my father's champions.  Even 
                        then I knew one day my own titans 
                        would eclipse them.  But none more 
                      so than Spartacus, Bringer of Rain.

  He stops at a large object draped by white cloth, removing 
  it proudly to reveal a STATUE OF SPARTACUS (bust and cock, 
  in the style of the trophy room).  Spartacus eyes the statue 
  proudly.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You honor me.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You stand above all others.  
                        Continue upon this path, and 
                        together we shall have the world.

  OFF SPARTACUS, embracing his destiny...                                                                                    12.



  MOVE WITH NAEVIA as she carries a vessel of steaming water. 
  She's startled by guard Hector returning from the ludus.

                                        HECTOR
                        You have been avoiding me.

                                        NAEVIA
                        I have been tending my duties.

                                        HECTOR
                        Your manner hardens.  I prefer it 
                        soft, as the moment we shared not 
                      so long ago...

                                        NAEVIA
                        You mistake smile and friendly 
                        touch beyond intent.

  She continues on.

                                        HECTOR
                        And the key that went missing from 
                      my clasp, after your "friendly" 
                        touch?

  She stops, stiffening in barely concealed fear.

                                          HECTOR(cont'd)
                      It did not by "mistake" draw into 
                        your palm, did it?

                                        NAEVIA
                      It did not.

                                        HECTOR
                        Yet you tense from question.  Such 
                        reaction warrants fair search...

  Hector moves in closer but Naevia stops him with a firm 
  look.

                                        NAEVIA
                      My hands service Domina alone.  She 
                        would not be pleased to hear of 
                        yours laid upon me without her 
                        consent... or to learn of a guard 
                        that has misplaced his key.

  Hector chews on that, backs down.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    13.
  CONTINUED:

                                        HECTOR
                        I would not have it so.

                                        NAEVIA
                        You have reputation for your 
                        handling of women.  Seek your loss 
                        among them, and do not press me 
                        again with accusation.

  Hector locks eyes with her, not caring for the tone.  A 
  tense beat.  Hector backs down, exits. OFF NAEVIA, her 
  confident demeanor crumbling as she realizes how close she 
  just came to discovery...



  SLAVES help prepare Batiatus and Lucretia for bed.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You trust Ilithyia not to come 
                        unhinged in front of the 
                        Magistrate?

                        More watchful than last, I pray.

  Lucretia tightens at the veiled mention of the Licinia 
  incident.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        All things have worked to 
                        advantage. Ilithyia is in our debt, 
                        and through collection access is 
                        gained to the most noble of 
                        families.

                                        BATIATUS
                        She attends to the list?

                        She will draw them to the 
                        Magistrate s celebration, so 
                        artfully placed within our walls.

  Naevia enters, pours steaming water into a basin.  Batiatus 
  moves to wash his face with it.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    14.

                        I desire his eyes upon me when I am 
                        the one anointed by the Magistrate. 
                        I want him to see that as my 
                        fortunes rise, his plummet.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        You taunt an injured snake.  One

                        serpent's head struck from its body 
                      in due course. And good Solonius 
                        will never see it coming...

  OFF BATIATUS, the thought of Solonius' downfall warming his 
  soul...

  Agron hisses at Duro as they receive their food from EUCLID

  Agron moves off in disgust, passing Spartacus and Varro.

                                        VARRO
                        I have heard of opportunities in 
                        Sicilia. Had I been wise, we would 
                        have moved there to escape my 
                        debts. Yet the advice of my wife 
                        fell short of its mark...

  They glance up to find Crixus approaching.

                        A true champion dreams only of the

                        And what does one dream of when he 
                      is no longer champion?

                      He stole nothing.

  Spartacus rises, violence erupting in his eyes.

                      If I am a thief, the crime was 
                        witnessed by all of Capua.  And is 
                        still celebrated to this day.

  Crixus tenses -- but a GUARD interrupts.

                                        GUARD
                        Spartacus.  You are summoned.

  Spartacus moves away with the Guard.  OFF CRIXUS, 
    smoldering...



  TIGHT ON AN 8X8 GAME BOARD, covered with BLACK and WHITE 
  STONES.  WIDEN TO REVEAL Batiatus and Ashur playing 
  Latrunculi, an ancient Roman strategy-based game.  It's 
  clear that Batiatus is winning handily.  He addresses

  Spartacus looks to Batiatus, who nods.  Spartacus moves a 
  marker.  Batiatus chuckles.

                        I fear our champion has no head for

  Batiatus makes a move, seizes another white marker.

                        Battles are often lost... and yet 
                        the war concludes in victory.

  Spartacus moves a marker, immobilizing Batiatus  Aquila 
  (Eagle) standard-bearer. The game is won.  Ashur gawks. 
  Batiatus laughs.

  Ashur exits with a sour frown.  Batiatus indicates for 
  Spartacus to sit.

  He kisses her, deep and sincere.  Passion rises as she loses 
  herself in it.  He slips her dress off as her hand undoes 
  his subligaria.  Now both naked, he eases her down and 
  enters her with a soft grunt.  SLOWLY ADJUST OFF THEIR LOVE

  eyes dance, a smile bending his lips. His enemy Crixus has 
  finally revealed a weakness to be exploited...



  Spartacus again immobilizes Batiatus' Aquila.  Batiatus 
  huffs, flustered from battle and flush from wine.

                                        BATIATUS

                        besting a man so far above your 
                        station?

  Batiatus reaches for more wine.  Pours Spartacus another 
  drink, then one for himself.

  Batiatus raises his cup.  Spartacus joins him in a drink.

  Batiatus receives the point, dismisses Spartacus.

                        Gratitude for the instruction.

  Lucretia waits until the Guard has removed Spartacus from 
  earshot, hisses at Batiatus.

                        Crixus was also Champion.  Yet no 
                        cup was ever raised with him.

  Batiatus gauges that, turns away to clear the game board.

                      We both know Crixus for a brute.

  OFF BATIATUS, considering her words as she leaves...



  The Guard escorts Spartacus back to the ludus.

                        Your victory was a glorious sight.

  Spartacus nods at the compliment -- then tenses as they come 
  around a corner to find Hector struggling with Mira.  Her 
  lip bloody, dress torn, breast exposed.  Visibly shaken.

  Hector swings. Spartacus reacts instinctively, catching 
  Hector's arm and pivoting to send the man flying. Hector 
  crashes into a SCONCE, screaming as the FLAMES sear the side 
  of his face. The other Guard whips out his sword.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Yes, Dominus.

  Batiatus gestures for the Guard to take Spartacus away. OFF 
  BATIATUS, wondering if his wife was right about their new 
  champion...



  The Magistrate enters with his wife Domitia and son 
  Numerius. A CONVOY OF SLAVES and PERSONAL GUARDS accompany 
  him.  Batiatus and Lucretia greet them, their own GUARDS and 
  SLAVES (including Naevia and Mira) assembled in the lushly 
  appointed atrium.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Magistrate Calavius!  The House of 
                        Batiatus welcomes you, on this, 
                        such a glorious day!  A boy enters 
                      my gates, yet leaves a man!

  Batiatus grins at Numerius.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        Gratitude for your hospitalities. 
                      We are in your debt.

                                        ILITHYIA (O.S.)
                      As are we all.

  Ilithyia appears, radiant and poised.

                                          DOMITIA
                        Ilithyia!  I had begun to fear for 
                        your health.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        A momentary lapse.  I have been 
                        tended to with most compassionate 
                        care within these walls.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    26.

  She gives Lucretia a warm smile. Lucretia returns it, 
  pleased to see Ilithyia falling into order. Numerius glances 
  about, can't contain his excitement any longer.

                        Who would blame him?!  To stand 
                        among the greatest titans in all 
                        the Republic, his to command.

                                        NUMERIUS

                        Each of my proud warriors has been 
                        instructed to regard your orders as 
                      if given from my own lips.

                      As well he should! Even more so 
                        when he hears the Champion of Capua 
                        himself has given you a tour of the 
                        ludus.

                                        NUMERIUS

                      He awaits your presence, with 
                        permission of your father...

  Numerius looks to his father with pleading eyes. Calavius 
  laughs, giving his consent.

                        the training square.

  Two Guards (not Hector) comply. Numerius practically bursts 
  with excitement as he's led out.

                                          DOMITIA
                        I have never seen him of higher

                        The house of Batiatus has such 
                        effect. Have you ever witnessed the 
                        view from their balcony? It simply 
                        overwhelms the senses.

  She gives Lucretia a sly smile.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Come. Let us gaze upon Capua's 
                        perfection.

                        discuss how ravaging their women 
                        are.

  Ilithyia flits out with Lucretia and Domitia. Calavius 
  watches her go, his eyes narrowing in shrewd observation.

  Calavius grins as he sips his wine.  Batiatus returns it.

  OFF BATIATUS' confidence as they exit, WIPING US TO --



  Lucretia, Domitia and Ilithyia gossip in the b.g. as 
  Batiatus reaches across the Latrunculi board and makes a 
  move.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        I was unaware you possessed such a

                                        BATIATUS
                        I consider myself a student of 
                        military strategy.  To win, one 
                        must maneuver to catch his opponent 
                        unawares.

  Batiatus perks up and attempts to seize his opening.

  Numerius enters, dirty and breathless with excitement.  He 
  clutches a practice sword.

                        Father!  Spartacus gave me his

  OFF ILITHYIA, her eyes twinkling as she sips her wine...



  Steam rises as Numerius lays in the bath, eyes closed. 
  (NOTE: This will be shot so that all we see of Numerius is 
  his head and shoulders -- we will never see him nude below 
  the waist.)

  Numerius' eyes shoot open as he looks to find Ilithyia 
  standing in the doorway.  She moves closer, a soft smile on 
  her lips.

                        Yes, you are.

  Ilithyia leans over and traces her fingers in the water.

                        Nothing quite as sensual as a warm 
                        bath. The water caressing your 
                        skin, washing away the grime of the 
                        common world...

  Numerius is hypnotized by the swell of Ilithyia's breasts.

                        Many honors. Many pleasures...

  She rises with a smile, moving slowly to the foot of the 
  tub. Numerius eyes her body, the way she moves. His pulse 
  quickens with barely concealed desire.

                                          ILITHYIA(cont'd)
                        The choices you make tonight will

                        and destinies. So much rests in 
                        your hands. And I would see them 
                        properly filled...

  Ilithyia locks eyes with him as she undoes her robe and lets 
  it drop to the floor, revealing her naked perfection.  OFF 
  NUMERIUS' STUNNED smile as she steps into the bath, WIPING 
  US TO --



  TIGHT ON A HAND, as it strums a lyre.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL a 
  BAND OF MUSICIANS playing as GUESTS mingle, the celebration 
  now in full swing.  ADJUST TO FIND

  moves with the wooden sword he received from Spartacus.  The 
  boy could not be happier -- or more satisfied.

                        A fine celebration, Batiatus!  I 
                        have never seen the boy happier.

  Ilithyia joins them, a cup of wine in her hand and a wry 
  smile gracing her lips.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Let us call him boy no longer.  
                        Does he not appear to you a man?

                                        BATIATUS
                      He does seem to stand taller, does 
                      he not?

                                        LUCRETIA
                      By quite some measure.  Soon he 
                        will rival the stature of his 
                        honored father.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                      It gives great pride, knowing I 
                        have such an heir to carry the name 
                        Calavius.

  She shares a smile with Batiatus, tinged with sadness.

                                        ILITHYIA
                                to Magistrate)(

                          extraordinary things.  I for one 
                        cannot wait to see them.

  She shifts her eyes to

  SPARTACUS

  standing next to Varro, on display with the other Gladiators 
  (including Crixus).  Varro notices the hint of venom in 
  Ilithyia's glance, whispers to Spartacus.

                                        VARRO
                      It appears the wife of the Legatus 
                        yet harbors grudge.

  Spartacus glances at Ilithyia.  Her attention is pulled away 
  as she's assaulted in greeting by AEMILIA and CAECILIA.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        She is a cat absent claws.

  Mira carries a tray of food, slowing as she passes 
  Spartacus.

                        Gratitude for last night.

  Spartacus looks across the room where Hector stares daggers 
  in their direction, the burn on his face still fresh.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        The man overstepped. I merely made 
                        correction.

                        done the same for any woman.

  Varro chuckles, spotting Crixus glaring at Spartacus, 
  wishing him dead.

  A KNOT OF GUESTS pass by, WIPING US TO --



  Lucretia, Ilithyia, AEMILIA and CAECILIA enjoy wine and 
  gossip.  Ilithyia squirms, visibly uncomfortable with the 
  current topic.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    37.

                        Licinia has completely vanished!  
                        Slipped away in the night absent 
                        slaves and not seen since.

  Ilithyia blanches.  Lucretia levels a gaze -- remain calm.

                        Who would wish such a thing upon a

                        Who could blame her then?

                        Helen to Paris!  How scandalous!

  Lucretia, Caecilia and Aemila GIGGLE, but Ilithyia remains 
  silent.  Her eyes dropping to the marble floor.                                                                                    38.



  [NOTE: ALREADY SHOT.]  ON LICINIA, laying upon the exact

  TIGHT ON ILITHYIA, haunted by this grotesque memory. She's 
  finally snapped out of it by the arrival of SOLONIUS, 
  looking ever the peacock in his finest robes.

                        the Republic stand glittering 
                        before me in Capua.

  The women TITTER at the compliment.  Lucretia produces a 
  plastic smile.

  The two rivals exchange man-hugs.  All for show.

                        Sadly the same cannot be said of 
                        your fortunes in the arena. Have 
                        you had opportunity to greet the

                      As the evening wears, I am certain 
                      he will find time for the less 
                        significant guests.

  The nearby patrons SNICKER. Solonius swallows his hatred and 
  forces a thin smile.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Gratitude for the invitation. I 
                        hope soon to return the favor.

  He gives a slight bow and moves off.  Batiatus watches him 
  go, reveling in his suffering.

                        The rictus of a man dying, a slice 
                      at a time.

                        I prefer as many strokes as 
                        possible. To maximize the pleasure.

  Solonius ignores the objection as he snags a snail off a

                        beneath the waves.

  Solonius drifts into the crowd.  OFF ASHUR, the weight of 
  betrayal crushing down upon him...

  Batiatus stands beside the Magistrate and Numerius, calling

  little uncomfortable at being the center of attention.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Yet before he dons the Toga 
                        Virilis, let us honor him with 
                        sport and blood!  A contest between 
                        present and past. Spartacus, 
                        Champion of Capua!  Step forward!

  Spartacus complies.  The patrons ogle him, clearly 
  impressed. Crixus glares, ready to destroy him.  Naevia 
  clocks the look, worry etching her face.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        And Crixus!  Former Champion, step 
                      --

                                        NUMERIUS
                        Wait.

  Crixus pauses, confused.  Batiatus shares the feeling.

                                          NUMERIUS(cont'd)
                        I fear Crixus has seen his best day 
                        past. I would have Varro fight in 
                        his place.

  Numerius furtively looks to Ilithyia, who gives the 
  slightest of smiles.  This is why she seduced the boy.  
  Batiatus recovers with a laugh.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You are the editor, young master!  
                        Your will, our hands!  Varro!  Step 
                        forward!

  Crixus fumes, his eyes wild with fury.  Doctore gives him a 
  look: settle down.  Crixus takes a step backwards as an 
  elated Varro moves up next to Spartacus.

                                        VARRO
                                  whispered)(
                        Did you have hand in my elevation?

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    42.
  CONTINUED:

                                          SPARTACUS
                        The boy's change comes as surprise.

                                        VARRO
                      It seems the gods favor us both 
                        now.

  Varro grins as Doctore signals for two SLAVES to bring them 
  weapons.  Varro with sword and shield, Spartacus with two 
  swords.  Doctore locks eyes with them.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Honor the boy.  Honor this ludus.

  LUCRETIA SCOWLS

  as she pulls Batiatus aside for a private conversation.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Numerius insults Crixus in our own 
                        house!

                                        BATIATUS
                        Let it pass. Our only concern is 
                        the Magistrate's happiness.

  Batiatus steps forward, leaving Lucretia to stew.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Numerius!  These men, these titans 
                      of the arena, are yours to command!

  Numerius takes a step forward, raises his fist, then brings 
  it down sharply.

                                        NUMERIUS
                        Begin!

  Spartacus grins as he and Varro circle one another.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Let us give them a show.

  Spartacus attacks.  He trades thunderous blows with Varro, 
  who spins and counters with lightning dexterity.  As they 
  battle, POP to our main characters watching:

  -- Varro drives his sword down which Spartacus blocks with 
  both of his blades.  MIRA follows Spartacus' every move, 
  unable to quell her blossoming feelings.

  -- Spartacus spins and swings both swords, which Varro 
  barely manages to sidestep.  DOCTORE watches stoically.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    43.
  CONTINUED:

  -- Spartacus grunts as Varro catches him across the lower 
  right side of his stomach, opening a long thin gash (NOTE: 
  the wound should be identical in location to the one Aulus 
  the driver was clutching at the end of ep. 106.) ILITHYIA's 
  face twists into a dark smile.

  -- Spartacus returns the favor, drawing blood across Varro's 
  chest.  Varro flinches back, grins as the two men circle. 
  CRIXUS glares, desperately wishing he were facing Spartacus. 
  He catches NAEVIA glancing at him from across the room.  She 
  subtly smiles her support.  Crixus softens.  ANGLE ON ASHUR, 
  catching the exchange, his own smile taking root.

  -- Spartacus and Varro trade blows and blood, both grinning 
  at the friendly rivalry.  Spartacus loses one of his swords, 
  Varro his shield.  SOLONIUS eyes Batiatus, plotting his next 
  move in their deadly game.

  ON SPARTACUS,

  as he evades Varro's attack.  TIME SLOWS as Spartacus takes 
  advantage of an opening and SLICES Varro's flank with one 
  sword and SWEEPS his left foot with the other.

  VARRO CRASHES TO THE FLOOR

  losing his sword.  He scrambles to his knees, only to find 
  Spartacus on him, sword at his neck.  Varro laughs, raising 
  the two finger surrender of the missio.  The patrons CLAP 
  and cheer as Spartacus and Varro share private words.

                                        VARRO
                                  kicking himself)(
                      My fucking flank!

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Protect it, and next time it may be 
                        you who stands victorious.

  A look of mutual respect between these two.  Batiatus beams 
  as he addresses the crowd.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Spartacus, the Champion of Capua 
                        still! And Varro, a formidable 
                        challenger, to be closely watched 
                      in the arena!

  APPLAUSE from the patrons as Batiatus looks to Numerius.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Numerius!  Pass judgment on our 
                        fallen warrior!

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    44.
  CONTINUED:

  Numerius steps forward and delivers the THUMBS DOWN, as if 
  it were a declaration of his manhood.

  A HUSH FILLS THE ROOM

  as Batiatus tightens, sharing a worried look with Lucretia. 
  Ilithyia smiles.  This is exactly what she planned.

  VARRO TENSES

  as he and Spartacus trade confused looks.  Spartacus' eyes 
  flash to Batiatus for an explanation.  Batiatus forces a 
  smile, whispering to Calavius.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Apologies, Magistrate, but we 
                        agreed this was merely an 
                        exhibition.  Not a fight to the 
                        death.

  Numerius catches Ilithyia's eye, turns to his father.

                                        NUMERIUS
                        Father...

  The Magistrate grins.  Proud of his son's fortitude.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                                to Batiatus)(
                        Numerius has made his decision.  I 
                        shall reimburse you the cost of the 
                        man.

  TIGHT ON BATIATUS, as he weighs his options.  Kill one of 
  his best gladiators, or disappoint the Magistrate.  A tense 
  beat, then Batiatus nods to Spartacus.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Proceed.

  Spartacus locks eyes with Varro.  At a loss.  Both men 
  trapped.  Spartacus doesn't move.  He can't.  The delay 
  causes the crowd to MURMUR at the insubordination.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                      Do we have a problem, Batiatus?

                                        BATIATUS
                                (firmly to 
                                  Spartacus)
                        I said proceed.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    45.
  CONTINUED:

  Spartacus still doesn't move, so Batiatus motions for the 
  Guards.  This is deadly fucking serious.  The Guards step 
  forward, drawing their swords.  Hector grins widely as he 
  unsheathes his blade, hoping Spartacus does something 
  stupid.

  PUSH IN ON SPARTACUS,

  tensing as his eyes go cold, ready to kill anyone that 
  advances.  Varro knows exactly what his friend is thinking.

                                        VARRO
                        Don't. They will kill us both.
                                  the painful truth)(
                        There is no choice.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        There is always a choice.

                                        VARRO
                        Not this time.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Spartacus!

  Spartacus shifts his eyes to Batiatus, his hand tensing on 
  his sword.  Varro knows Spartacus is about to get them both 
  killed -- and there's only one way to stop it. VARRO GRABS 
  SPARTACUS' SWORD thrusts it down halfway into his own chest.  
  Spartacus is stunned.  Varro looks up at Spartacus, blood 
  leaking from his mouth, tears filling his eyes.

                                        VARRO
                        Live...  And see my wife provided 
                        for. And know... I would have done 
                        the same...

  A long, agonizing beat and then...

  SPARTACUS

  thrusts his blade down through Varro's chest. TIME SLOWS as 
  BLOOD SPLASHES and Varro collapses to the floor -- dead.

  ON SPARTACUS,

  devastated.  He stumbles back, his sword CLANGING to the 
  ground.  Everything comes through to him now as if 
  underwater.  The patrons LAUGHING and APPLAUDING.  Batiatus 
  signaling the Guards to remove him.  Mira, looking on in 
  shock.  Spartacus is escorted out past



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    46.
  CONTINUED:

  ILITHYIA,

  never seeing the satisfied smile bending her lips. She has 
  struck at the heart of her enemy, leaving his world 
    shattered...



  Guests head out as the party winds down. The Magistrate 
  warmly clasps Batiatus' shoulder.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        I am forever indebted to your 
                        hospitality, Batiatus.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Think nothing of it.  A favor for a 
                        dear friend.

  The Magistrate looks over to Numerius, now wearing his TOGA 
  VIRILIS, saying goodbye to the departing guests.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                      He calls for blood without 
                        hesitation! Such boldness will one 
                        day carry him to the senate.

  Batiatus glances at Lucretia nearby.  Grins nervously.  This 
  is the moment he's been waiting for.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The noblest of ambitions.  I myself 
                        have designs on political office.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                      Is that so?

                                        BATIATUS
                        Not the senate, not so soon, but 
                        something local.  I would speak to 
                        you of support, perhaps tomorrow, 
                      if --

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        I leave for the coast on business.

                                        BATIATUS
                        When you return then.

  The Magistrate laughs, dismissing the thought.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    47.

                        Politics is too dull for a man of 
                        your persuasion!  You would ache 
                        for the sights and sounds of the 
                        arena.

                                        BATIATUS
                        A sacrifice I would gladly make in 
                        service to Rome.

  Calavius frowns as he realizes that Batiatus has his mind 
  set on this.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        Batiatus, you are a fine lanista. 
                        Perhaps the finest in all the 
                        Republic. But politics...  It 
                        requires a different sort.

  Solonius appears, delighted at having overheard.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Citizens of status, with the proper 
                        heritage.

                                  laughs)(
                        Just so.  Relish in what you know 
                        best. Leave politics to the men 
                        with breeding for it.

  Batiatus' world crumbles, the catastrophe hidden behind a 
  frozen smile.  Solonius presents his own smile to Batiatus, 
  having turned the humiliation back around.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS(cont'd)
                        Come, good Solonius!  We have not 
                        had occasion to speak this evening.

  Calavius moves off with Solonius.  Batiatus stares after 
  them as Lucretia comes up, dying to know the outcome of the 
    conversation.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        The Magistrate's response?

                      To be answered in blood.

  Lucretia s face drops. OFF BATIATUS, plotting revenge for 
  the slight&                                                                                    48.



  Spartacus stalks his cell, a caged beast.  Racked with 
  sorrow and rage.  His mind FLASHING to VARRO S FACE as he 
  died by Spartacus  hand.

  SPARTACUS ERUPTS,

  destroys everything in his cell.  He POUNDS his fists 
  against the wall, BLOOD SPRAYING as the skin tears from his 
  knuckles.  The eruption passes, leaving him drained and 
  empty.

  MIRA

  in the doorway.  A beat.  She goes to him, tenderly embraces 
  this broken man.  Tears spill from Mira's eyes as she pulls 
  him close to her.  Spartacus tenses.  Then his own tears 
  fall as he pulls her to him, desperate for the contact.

  SPARTACUS SINKS

  into Mira.  As these two damaged souls become one, CAMERA 
  SLOWLY RETREATS through the open door and out across the 
  empty training square as the light fades from the world...
