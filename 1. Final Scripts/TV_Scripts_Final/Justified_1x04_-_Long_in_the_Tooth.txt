      EXT. DENTIST S OFFICE - PARKING LOT - DAY33

      A four story Medical Complex.  A sign reads Offices For 
      Lease.   The parking lot is half full of cheap, filthy cars 
      pocked with dings and scrapes.  Bumper stickers shout out to 
      Jesus, blurb local radio stations, and remember the troops.  

      Super: VISTA HEIGHTS, CALIFORNIA.

      INT. DENTIST S OFFICE - DAY44

      The tooth-shaped wall clock tells us we re in a dentist s 
      office; old carpet and flickering lights tell us times are 
      tough.  Plastic plants dot shelves.  Bad music mingles with a 
      drill whistling in some back room.  

      The row of waiting patients seem in their dress and 
      exhaustion to be lower income.  There is a KOREAN LADY, a 
      GAWKY TEEN, an OLDER MAN, a MEXICAN GIRL, and an AVERAGE JOE.

      MINDY SPRINGER, the cute receptionist, 28, calls out.

                                  MINDY
                    Joe?  Come on back.

      INT. DENTIST S OFFICE - EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY55

      DR. PETER OLDHAM, DDS, 45, peers into JOE S mouth.  His 
      dental assistant RAUL, 30, observes.  Dr. Oldham picks at 
      Joe s teeth.

                                  DR. OLDHAM
                    A little pitting in number six.  

      Raul nods.  Oldham is a broad-shouldered guy about 45 years 
      old.  He picks at other teeth.  

                                  DR. OLDHAM (CONT D)
                    Your gums are retreating.
                          (to Joe)
                    I ll have Mindy give you a softer 
                    brush.

      INT. DENTIST S OFFICE - EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY66

      PAULA, 8, Mexican, is in the chair.  Dr. Oldham has a mirror 
      in her mouth.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                    EP. 104 - "LONG IN THE TOOTH" - 2ND PINK  12/01/09    2.

        CONTINUED:66

                                  DR. OLDHAM
                    Looks good, kiddo.  Go ahead and 
                    rinse up.

      Paula fills a cup.  She drinks and swishes.  Dr. Oldham 
      smiles.  A knock at the door.  It s MRS. PENA, 40, Mexican, 
      Paula s mom.  She holds an aluminum tray.

                                  DR. OLDHAM (CONT D)
                    What is this?

                                  MRS. PE A
                    Tamales, doctor.

                                  DR. OLDHAM
                    Aw, Mrs. Pe a.  They smell awesome, 
                    but I told you, you don t have to 
                    worry.  You pay when you can.  

                                  MRS. PE A
                    Until then, tamales.

      INT. DENTIST S OFFICE - WAITING ROOM - DAY77

      Dr. Oldham walks Paula and Mrs. Pe a out.  They pass a small 
      table off the waiting area.  He places the tamales alongside 
      other gifts: Cards, drawings, knitted things; fruit from 
      backyard trees; bottles of homemade hot sauce; pottery from 
      school; and tubs of baked goods.

                                  MRS. PE A
                    You are a good man, Dr. Oldham. 

                                  DR. OLDHAM
                    And you are too kind.

                                  FERGUSON (O.S.)
                    Are you an idiot?!

                                  MINDY (O.S.)
                    Mr. Ferguson, please lower your 
                    voice.

      Dr. Oldham and Mrs. Pe a turn to see a patient, CHASE 
      FERGUSON, 33, a wormy, life-coach type, arguing with Mindy.  
      Dr. Oldham ushers Mrs. Pena and Paula out.

                                  DR. OLDHAM
                    Thanks for the tamales, Mrs. Pena.  
                    Paula -- up and down, not side to 
                    side.

      Mrs. Pe a and Paula exit.  Dr. Oldham turns to Mr. Ferguson.  



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                    EP. 104 - "LONG IN THE TOOTH" - 2ND PINK  12/01/09    3.

        CONTINUED:77

                                  DR. OLDHAM (CONT D)
                    Mister Ferguson.

                                  FERGUSON
                    Finally, someone with a brain.

                                  DR. OLDHAM
                    What s the problem?

                                  FERGUSON
                    Fire this woman.  She has no idea 
                    what she s talking about and she s 
                    wasting my time.  I have clients to 
                    get to.

                                  MINDY
                    This is the fourth visit we ve 
                    extended his credit.  He s past due 
                    and he refuses to pay his balance.  

                                  FERGUSON
                    I m not refusing to pay, I m not 
                    supposed to pay.  
                          (to Dr. Oldham)
                    The tone of voice she uses.  Like 
                    I m an infant.  

                                  MINDY
                    He insists the insurance company 
                    covers his procedures.  But I ve 
                    called.  Repeatedly.  They don t.

                                  FERGUSON
                    As I ve explained three times now, 
                    my insurance company requires 
                      additional paperwork for the semi-
                    elective procedures, i.e. my caps 
                    and gold crowns, which she is 
                    clearly too lazy to do... 

                                  DR. OLDHAM
                    I ll look into it.

                                  FERGUSON
                    Don t look into it.  Fix it.  I 
                    can t come here every time and 
                    argue with your sub-mental staff 
                    about out-of-pocket compensation.  
                    I have things to do; I can t show 
                    up at my seminar in a filthy car.  
                    That affects business.

      Oldham glances at his clients, adopts a low tone of voice.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                    EP. 104 - "LONG IN THE TOOTH" - 2ND PINK  12/01/09    4.

                                  DR. OLDHAM
                    Could you lower your voice?

                                  FERGUSON
                    Again talking like I m five.  You 
                    know, I ve had it with you people.  
                    I could get better dental work in a 
                    third world country.  A cleaner 
                    office, too.  I mean, Jesus, get 
                    some Pine Sol.  Leave here needing 
                    a tetanus shot.  

      He walks out.  Oldham and Mindy stand there stunned.

      INT. DENTIST S OFFICE - EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY88

      Dr. Oldham paces, runs his hands over his scalp.  He grabs 
      dental tools off a tray.  They go in his pocket.  He opens a 
      cabinet.

      EXT. DENTIST S OFFICE - PARKING LOT - DAY99

      Ferguson stands by his not-filthy BMW, talking on his 
      Bluetooth.

                                  FERGUSON
                    Remember, Brian, you are the alpha 
                    dog.  You don t have to take that 
                    shit from anyone...  

      He doesn t see Dr. Oldham walking toward him, opens his car 
      door.  

                                  FERGUSON (CONT'D)
                    I don t care if he s a paraplegic.  
                    I don t care if he s a 
                      quadriplegic.  Hell, I don t care 
                    if he s just a torso on a 
                      skateboard--

      He hears footsteps and turns.  

                                  FERGUSON (CONT D)
                    Hey! 

      Dr. Oldham, one hand behind his back, shoves Ferguson into 
      the driver s seat.  

                                  FERGUSON (CONT D)
                    What the hell?!

      Dr. Oldham reveals what he held behind his back -- a syringe.  
      He jabs it into Ferguson s neck, thumb poised on the plunger.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                    EP. 104 - "LONG IN THE TOOTH" - 2ND PINK  12/01/09    5.

                                  DR. OLDHAM
                    If you don t do exactly as I say, I 
                    will depress the plunger and inject 
                    drain cleaner into you and you will 
                    die.

                                  FERGUSON
                    You gotta be--

      Oldham pushes the needle in a bit.

                                  FERGUSON (CONT D)
                    OW!  Okay, okay!

                                  DR. OLDHAM
                    Put the seat back.

      Ferguson hits the control, the seat starts angling back, 
      slowly.

                                  DR. OLDHAM (CONT D)
                    Faster!

                                  FERGUSON
                    That s as fast as it goes!

      The seat goes back, stops.

                                  DR. OLDHAM
                    Open your mouth.

      Ferguson does.  Oldham fishes around in his pocket.  

                                  DR. OLDHAM (CONT D)
                    You think I m a jerk?  Think I got 
                    a dumpy little office so I m a 
                    loser?  I m a man.  I help people.  
                    Them I do for tamales and hot 
                    sauce.  To pay for that, assholes 
                    like you get the up-sell: the 
                    bonding, the laser whitening, the 
                      gold-not-porcelain crowns.  And now 
                    you don t want to pay?  You know 
                    what?  Fine.  But I ll take back 
                    what s mine.

      Dr. Oldham shoves dental pliers in Fergusen s mouth.

                                  DR. OLDHAM (CONT D)
                    Consider me a repo man.  

      Dr. Oldham pulls a GOLD CROWNED MOLAR from Fergusen s mouth.  
      Ferguson squeals.  The molar goes in Dr. Oldham s pocket.  



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                    EP. 104 - "LONG IN THE TOOTH" - 2ND PINK  12/01/09    6.

      He yanks a second tooth, pockets that as well.  He turns and 
      walks away from the car.  

      Ferguson holds his jaw, yells incoherently.

      Dr. Oldham sucks in big breaths of exhilaration and, then, 
      panic as he walks away with blood on his white smock, teeth 
      in his pocket, pliers in his left hand, and syringe in his 
      right.  Ferguson honks his horn.  Dr. Oldham drops the 
      syringe like Michael drops the gun in The Godfather.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      INT. MARSHAL S OFFICE - ART S OFFICE - DAWN1212

      Raylan is in with Art.  The office is otherwise empty.

                                  ART
                    This morning at eight-forty-five 
                    L.A. time, LAPD got a 911 from a 
                    patient of Dr. Peter Oldham, DDS.  
                    Seems Mr. Ferguson had his back two 
                    molars excised without anesthetic.  
                    In a parking lot. 

      Art swivels his computer monitor to show Raylan a California 
      DMV photo of Dr. Peter Oldham, DDS, aka Roland Pike.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Rollie Pike.  

      A face Raylan has been thinking about for five years.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    How d they find out?

                                  ART
                    LAPD ran prints and got a match.

                                  RAYLAN
                    The media?

                                  ART
                    It s already on CNN.  Security 
                    camera footage.   The Crazy 
                    Dentist.   It s got legs.

                                  RAYLAN
                    That puts a clock on it.  Cartel 
                    has a long memory.   

                                  ART
                    There s a flight to L.A., 
                      connecting through Chicago, leaves 
                    in forty minutes.  Rachel s 
                      downstairs.  You can go together.  

      Raylan looks at Art -- huh?




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                    EP. 104 - "LONG IN THE TOOTH" - 2ND PINK  12/01/09    8.

                    You re afraid she s going to cramp 
                    your style?  Cock-block you from 
                    banging a starlet?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Rollie s my case.

                                  ART
                    Now, because of you, it s mine, 
                    too, and Rachel s going with you.  
                    Not only that -- and I know you ll 
                    love this part -- she s taking 
                    lead.

      Raylan looks at Art again.

                                  ART (CONT D)
                    She has seniority, Raylan.

      Raylan sees there s no arguing, heads out.  

      I/E. RACHEL S MARSHAL CAR - LEXINGTON - DRIVING - DAYA13A13

      Raylan and Rachel.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    How much do you know about Rollie 
                    Pike?

                    I know six years ago he decided to 
                    give himself a helluva Christmas 
                    bonus -- took off with a chunk of 
                    cartel money he was laundering.

                                  RAYLAN
                        A two-hundred-and-fifty thousand 
                    dollar chunk.  

                                  RACHEL
                    I read the report.  The boy had a 
                    hefty set of balls.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Balls, nothing.  That s halfway to 
                    crazy.  He looks like an 
                      accountant, but he s not.

                                  RACHEL
                    I get it.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I don t know if you do.  Rollie 
                    Pike is a very slippery individual.

                                  RACHEL
                    This isn t my first fugitive.  You 
                    know that, right? 

                                  RAYLAN
                    Do you know why he ran?

                                  RACHEL
                    Well, that s what you do.  You take 
                    the money and run.

                                  RAYLAN
                    He didn t just suddenly give in to 
                      temptation.  The boss threw an 
                    insult at him, so he threw 
                    something at the boss -- a 
                      paperweight.  It put out his right 
                    eye.  Of course, Rollie didn t know 
                    the eye was unsaveable.  By that 
                    point he d already taken the cash 
                    and split, since he wisely assumed 
                    he d be dead as soon as possible. 

                                  RACHEL
                    It isn t bedtime, Raylan, so why 
                    are you telling me a story?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Just want you to be up to speed if 
                    you're taking the lead here.

                    First of all --  if  I m taking 
                    lead?  That s not a question. 

                                  RAYLAN
                    That was more of a rhetorical--

                    because I'm taking lead.

      EXT. DENTIST S OFFICE - DAY1313

      The parking lot is full of altogether different vehicles now: 
      LAPD squad cars, news vans, and federal-issue Fords and Crown 
      Vics.  People mill around.  Law enforcement, camera guys, 
      civilians behind tape.

      Raylan and Rachel arrive in a rental Crown Vic.  They get 
      out, head for the building.

      Formerly Dr. Oldham, in a battered tomato-red CAMARO.  He is 
      surprised, almost amused.

      A dozen people (LAPD, Marshals, FBI) look through books, take

                    We knew Rollie was probably headed 
                    for the border, so Ray-Ray went to 
                      Brownsville and staked out a bar 
                    where people go to buy paper.  
                    Rollie walked in.  Raylan made his 
                    pitch, told Rollie he was looking 
                    either at a short life on the run 
                    from gun thugs like Tommy Bucks, or 
                    he could get him into WitSec, get a

                    was what, on your computer this 
                    morning?

        Receptionist Mindy comes out of an office door, holding a 
      cardboard box, walks up to them.  (Wardrobe note: Mindy has a 
      nice watch, maybe a ladies  Rolex.)

                                  MINDY
                    Excuse me.  I m guessing you re 
                    gonna shut the office down, and I 
                    was wondering if I could take 
                    these, so they don t go bad?

                                  JIM
                    What are they?

                                  MINDY
                    Tamales.

      Jim looks in the box.

                                  MINDY (CONT D)
                    Want one?

                                  JIM
                    No, thanks.

      She offers them to Raylan and Rachel.  They shake their 
      heads.

                                  MINDY
                    Your loss.  They re real good.

                    Anyone have any idea Dr. Oldham was 
                    really Roland Pike?

                                  JIM
                    No.  They all seem pretty stunned.  

      In the b.g., an FBI AGENT goes with Raul into the exam room 
      Mindy came out of.  

                                  RACHEL
                    How did he pass himself off as a 
                    dentist?

                                  JIM
                    He wasn t passing.  He got a  
                    degree from a dental school in 
                    Panama.  Came here, kept his head 
                    down, worked the fringe -- 
                    illegals, people without insurance.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Never saw him as a dentist.  
                          (off their looks)
                    I always imagined him sitting on a 
                    beach in Belize or Brazil.

      The FBI agent comes out of the exam room.

                                  FBI AGENT
                    Uh, we may have a problem.

                    Lemme see, lemme see. 

      Rollie looks in the cardboard box.

      Rollie moves the tamales.

                                  ROLLIE
                    Smart.

      Inside the box: a hundred packets of DENTAL-GRADE GOLD. 

                                  ROLLIE (CONT D)
                    Were you scared?

                                  MINDY
                    No, it was exciting.  But there 
                    were a lot more people than I 
                    expected.

                                  ROLLIE
                    I pulled two teeth without 
                      anesthetic.  Or permission.

                                  MINDY
                    But why would they send out twenty 
                    guys?  That time my cousin s 
                    trainer beat him with his weight 
                    belt?  Two cops.

                                  ROLLIE
                    Yeah, well, I ve got a lot of 
                    unpaid parking tickets.  

      Rollie puts the box in the back seat.

                                  ROLLIE
                    We turn the gold into cash, get a 
                    new car, new ID s.  Once we re over 
                    the border, we cruise down to 
                    Belize, where they speak English 
                    and it s almost impossible to be 
                      extradited.  We set up shop and 
                    start fixing kids  teeth again.  
                    That sound good?

                                  MINDY
                    Sounds crazy, but yeah. 

      Rollie grins, turns the key, drives off.

                    Up until six years ago, I worked

                    I was their accountant, I moved 
                    money around.  And one day I... I 
                    just couldn t do it anymore, and I 
                    took some of their money and I ran.  
                    That s why I had to change my name.

                                  MINDY
                    Why didn t you tell me?

                    would ve gone?   Uh, Mindy?  Yeah, 
                    before I was a dentist I was a 
                      money-launderer for a drug cartel? 

                                  MINDY
                    Oh, my God.  What else have you

                          (Mindy looks at him)
                    I read somewhere you go to a mall 
                    parking lot and look for keys in 
                    the ignition.

                    Look, if you want to walk, I

                    You can say I threatened you.  I ll

      Silence.  Mindy thinks, sighs.

                    called me Rollie.

                                  MINDY
                    Okay, well, Rollie?  Don t lie 
                    anymore, okay?  It d break my

      Rollie nods, walks off. 

      EXT. MINDY S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY2020

      Raylan and Rachel stand at the open door of an apartment, 
      finishing up with a middle-aged MAN.

                                  RACHEL

      The man nods, closes the door as we track Raylan and Rachel 
      to the next apartment.  The door is already open, an 
      attractive thirty-something, SHAWNI BURNETT, standing there.

      EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - DAY2121

      Rollie walks down a row of cars, looking for keys in an 
      ignition.  No... No... No... No... Yes!  Keys in the 
      ignition!  He reaches for the door handle.  

                                  JONES (O.S.)
                    You re just going to steal that car 
                    in broad daylight?

      Rollie turns to see JONES, a black veteran, 70, with a 
      prosthetic leg and a U.S.S. New Jersey cap, getting out of a 
      Chevy Lumina.  

                                  ROLLIE
                    What?  Noooo!  This is my car.  I

      Jones comes around.  Rollie sees the prosthetic leg.

                    Really, I promise you--

                    Without looking.

      Jones gives Rollie a look.

      EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - DAY2222

      Jones sits in the driver's seat of Mindy s Camaro.  The 
      engine thunders.

      Jones peels out.

      EXT. CASH-FOR-GOLD - DAY2323

      Mindy s waiting on a bus bench.  Rollie pulls up in Jones  
      Lumina.  Mindy gets in.

      Rollie gets out of the Lumina, paces the sidewalk.  Mindy 
      sits in the car, angry.  Her cell phone starts to ring inside 
      her purse.  Mindy grabs her purse, digs for the phone.

                    Raylan!  My favorite U.S. Marshal!  
                    I saw you this morning!

                                  RAYLAN
                    Where?

                                  ROLLIE
                    Outside my office building.  I 
                    never forget a hat.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    You should ve said hi.

                                  ROLLIE
                    I was running a little late, you 
                      understand.  But you looked good.  
                    Hey, I guess you re still pretty 
                    mad at me, huh?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Rollie, if anything, I m angry at 
                    myself.  I really thought I had you 
                    measured.  You gave me your word 
                    and I took it.

                                  ROLLIE
                    Raylan, I d love to explain to you 
                    why I ran, but right now, I have 
                    enough respect for you to know 
                    you re probably running a trace on 
                    this, so I m going to have to bid 
                    you adieu.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    Rollie, one more thing.  I ll be 
                    quick.  I saw you on CNN this 
                    morning.  Security video of you 
                    pulling that fella s teeth.  Now, 
                    if the marshals and the FBI saw it, 
                    it s a fair bet your friends in 
                    Miami did too.  You know what ll 
                    happen to you and Ms. Springer if 
                    the bad guys find you before I do?

                    No one s finding me, Raylan.  

      Rollie ends the call.  He looks around, spots a truck loaded 
      with yard trimmings.  He tosses the phone in the back, gets 
      in the Lumina with Mindy and drives off.

      Rachel, still on the phone, turns to Raylan.

                                  RACHEL
                    We ll have his location in two

                    dumped the phone.  

      Raylan heads for the street.

      EXT. MINDY S APARTMENT - STREET - DAY2626

      Lots of cars -- LAPD, USMS, FBI.  And, way down the street, 
      there s a black Mercedes.

      IN THE MERCEDES

      There are two men.  We ll call them FRANK and JOE.  As we 
      will pick up, Frank is a local hire and Joe was flown in from 
      Miami.

                                  FRANK
                    It don t bother you, working for 
                    spics?  See, the spics we got out 
                    here re mostly wetbacks with no 
                    papers, pick lettuce all day, live 
                    like thirty deep in some ratpiss 
                    apartment or else, like, in 
                    homemade tents out by the highway. 
                    Point is, they ain t runnin  shit.

                                  JOE
                    No.

                                  FRANK
                          (having forgotten his own 
                            question)
                     No  what?

                                  JOE
                    No, it doesn t bother me.

                                  FRANK
                    Yeah, well, it would me. 

      Joe gazes out the window, trying to ignore his companion. 
      When he sees Raylan, he almost stops breathing.  He stares 
      for a long moment, making sure.  Then he takes out his cell 
      phone, starts dialing.  Frank is oblivious, just goes right 
      on talking. 

                                  FRANK (CONT D)
                    Reason I got kicked outta the Corps 
                    -- aside from all that shit with 
                    the missing tires -- was I didn t 
                    even like takin  orders from a 
                    white man.  But a honey dripper? 
                    Forget it.  Can t tell those people 
                    a goddamn thing. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                  EP. 104 - "LONG IN THE TOOTH" - 2ND PINK  12/01/09    26.

      He finally notices that his companion has a phone up to his 
      ear.

                    He there?...  Yeah, get him for me.

                                  FRANK

                    callin , or is it, like, hush-hush 
                      need-to-know?

                                  JOE
                    I m calling Miami.

                          (nervous)
                    You gonna tell  em all that 
                    spicaroo stuff I said?  I was just 
                    kidding with that. 

                                  JOE
                          (re: Raylan)
                    You see the guy in the hat?

                                  FRANK
                    The tall one?

                                  JOE
                    The one in the hat.  He s the 
                    Marshal who popped one of Gio s 
                    captains a few months back by the 
                    pool at the Delano.  It was on CNN.

                                  FRANK
                    Yeah, I m not too big on, like, 
                    what you call  current events. 

      An unintelligible voice SQUAWKS from Joe s phone.

      PRE-LAP the sound of a siren whoop.

      EXT. INDUSTRIAL STREET - DAY2727

      Jones steers Mindy s Camaro to the curb, followed by an LAPD 
        black-and-white.  Two young cops, LANE, black, and PETERS, 
      white, come up on either side of the car, Peters on the 
      driver s side, approaching very cautiously, guns drawn.  But 
      then they see Jones, share a look, shake their heads -- not 
      him.  Peters addresses Jones.

                                  PETERS
                    Sir, I m gonna need you to keep 
                    both your hands on top of the 
                    steering wheel for me, please.

                                  JONES
                    And I m gonna need you to kiss my 
                    taint, you ofay piece a shit.

                                  LANE
                    Sir, there s no need for that type 
                    of language.

      Jones looks over at Lane as though noticing him for the first 
      time.

                                  JONES
                    Listen to you, talkin  like a real 
                    house neee-gro.  Why you pull me 
                    over, House Negro?  

                                  PETERS
                    Sir, I m gonna have to ask you to 
                    step out of the vehicle.

                                  JONES
                    How  bout I ask you to go fight 
                    some actual crime,  stead of 
                    breaking the balls of a disabled 
                    veteran?

                    car. 

      Peters opens the driver s side door and helps Jones pull 
      himself out of the car.  Lane reaches in through the 
      passengers  side window, opens the glove box, takes out the 
      car s registration card. 

                                  JONES
                          (groaning with the effort)

      INT. TACO STAND - DAY2828

      At the counter, a TEENAGER gets his tray of food, moves off.  
      Rollie and Mindy move up.  The counter man, HEC, 60, waits 
      for their order.  They don t order.

      EXT. INDUSTRIAL STREET - DAY2929

      There are MANY COPS on the scene now, along with FBI and 
      USMS.  A FORENSIC TEAM examines Mindy s Camaro.  Jones is 
      sitting in the back of a squad car.  Lane guards him.  Peters 
      brings Raylan and Rachel over.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You want it...?

                                  RACHEL
                    No, by all means, you take the 
                    angry black man.

      Raylan shrugs -- okay -- and goes up to Jones.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Mr. Jones?  Officer Peters tells me 
                    you found this car?

                                  JONES
                    Not that it s any of his business. 
                    Or yours either.  You some kind of 
                    fancy lawman, huh?  Federal Bureau 
                    of Intimidation?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Marshal s Service.

                                  JONES
                    Yeah?  Or are you just saying that, 
                     cause the Gold Dust twins...
                          (meaning Peters and Lane)
                    ...told you I was a  radical 
                    militant  and you thought I might 
                    have a soft spot for Marshals since 
                    they were the ones walked James 
                    Meredith to school?  

                                  RAYLAN
                    Well, I can t say I d joined up yet 
                    at that point, but if you want to 
                    give me credit for it, I won t stop 
                    you.

                                  JONES
                    I m supposed to be impressed you 
                    got a colored partner?  You re all 
                      post-racist and shit?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Can I tell you my theory?

                                  JONES
                    You re a white man in America -- 
                    with a badge and gun, no less -- I 
                    figure you can do just about 
                    anything you want.

      Rachel steps in.

                                  RACHEL
                    Mr. Jones, we think you swapped 
                    cars with a funny little guy looked 
                    like he was running from something.  
                    That sound about right?

                                  JONES
                    Did I hear you drop your  R s?  You 
                    trying to  get down  with me, soul 
                    sista ?

                                  RACHEL
                    Sir, why don t you save everyone 
                    some time and tell us what he s 
                    driving now?  Otherwise we have to 
                    run through the DMV database to get 
                    your make, model and license.  
                    We ll find it, but I hear in this 
                    state it sometimes takes the DMV a 
                    half-hour just to answer their 
                    phone.

                                  JONES
                    Well, then, I guess you d best get 
                    started.

      Again, if we re paying attention, way down the street, 
      there s a black Mercedes parked at the curb.

      I/E. MERCEDES/INDUSTRIAL STREET - DAY3030

      Frank and Joe watch Raylan talking to Jones.  Joe is on his 
      cell phone.

      EXT. PENA HOUSE AND STREET - DAY3131

      Rows of homes, little boxes.  The Lumina is parked in front 
      of one.  

      Rollie and Mindy are at the door.  Rollie rings the doorbell.  
      Finally the door opens, reveals Mrs. Pena, the one who gave 
      the tamales.  She looks out through the security screen, a 
      little leery.  

                                  ROLLIE
                    Hey, Mrs. Pena.  It s me, Dr. 
                    Oldham.  

                                  MRS. PENA

                          (glances around)
                    Look, could we come inside?  

      Mrs. Pena hesitates, then unlocks the door.

      INT. PENA HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY3232

      Ornate decor, and too much of it.  But clean, nice.  Rollie 
      and Mindy sit together on a couch.  Mrs. Pena sits opposite, 
        stone-faced.  An old man, DON JAIME, sits nearby watching 
      television, the volume up.  They raise their voices, talking 
      over the MEXICAN SOAP OPERA on TV.  

                                  MRS. PENA
                    Paula saw on the news, how you hurt 
                    that man.   

                                  ROLLIE
                    No, no, Mrs. Pena, they took that 
                    video completely out of context.  

                                  MRS. PENA
                    What do you want from us?

                    Mindy and I have to get into

                    the borders are being watched very 
                    closely.  We need help.  Someone 
                    who knows how to get across without

      Suddenly the TV turns off.  Don Jaime speaks.

                          (in Spanish)

      Mrs. Pena shoots him an angry look.

                                  MRS. PENA
                    This is my house, and my decision.

                    Who bought you this house?  

      Mrs. Pena hesitates, then walks out.  Don Jaime faces Rollie 
      and Mindy.  Now he speaks English.  

      Mindy feels her stomach.  Something is not sitting right.

      Jim hurries out.

      Rachel starts to go with.  Raylan stays where he is, watching

                    Just a sec.

      Raylan waits for the last of the FBI to clear out of the

      takes off his hat.  Rachel hangs back, watches.

      Don Jaime shrugs.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    I m sure you were hoping to put all 
                    this disruption behind you.  I can 
                    imagine it s jarring to have 
                    strangers asking questions.  I hope 
                    you ll permit me to ask just a few 
                    more.
                          (beat)
                    See, I understand your connection 
                    to Dr. Oldham.  I myself have a 
                      connection of a different sort.  I 
                    never baked him any food, like your 
                    daughter did, but you could fairly 
                    say I feel a sense of obligation to 
                    the man.  
                          (beat)
                    I know you understand this 
                      obligation.  Which is why I think 
                    you misled the men who just left.  

      Don Jaime doesn t react.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT'D)
                    I don t intend to tell them.  It s 
                    okay by me.  But you should know 
                    that without the proper 
                      information, bad men will find your 
                    dentist friend before I can.

                    They will kill him and they will

                      happening.  Do you understand?

                     Cause it s a movie.

                    I know, but he s supposed to be a 
                    pro, right?  I mean, you turn

                    gun in your hand, you re not even

                    Maybe he accidently shot a guy in 
                    the backseat.

                                  FRANK
                    Whatever.  So now he only uses a 
                    blade.

                    You ever kill anybody with a knife,

                          (gets no response)
                    It feels... real personal.  Plus, 
                    talk about messy...

                    Well, you probably have me on your 
                    to-do list now, too, huh?
                          (no answer)
                    That s a yes.  Okay.  Three 
                    options.  Number one -- and it s in 
                    that position for a reason -- I get 
                    out of your car, you get this moron 
                    to drive you to the airport, when 
                    you get back to Miami you tell Gio 
                    he d better hire one of those 
                      consultants that teach guys how to 
                    survive in prison,  cause Rollie s 
                      testimony s gonna put him in for 
                    all day.

                    What s option two?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Option two is, next time I see you, 
                    I kill you.

                                  JOE
                    Isn t that the same line you used

                    There s two of us, cowboy.

                          (re: Frank)
                    You really wanna count on him to 
                    back you up?   Cause if it happens, 
                    you go first.  That s not an 
                    insult.  You always go for the good 
                    one first.   

                                  JOE
                      Flattering.  Thanks.  Option three?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Not much of an improvement on 
                    option two.  We do it right now and 
                    you die in this car.
                          (beat)
                    No takers?  Okay, then.

      Raylan opens the door, gets out.

      No other cars run along this road.  Sagebrush and agave cover 
      the narrow brown canyons that offset the sapphire sky.  A 
      sign with arrows in opposition reads:

      The Chevy Lumina passes and pulls into the next turnout.                   EP. 104 - "LONG IN THE TOOTH" - 2ND PINK  12/01/09    44.

                    This is it.  We are officially in

                                  COYOTE (O.S.)
                    Hey, white people.

      Rollie and Mindy turn.  A gaunt Mexican man, 50, the COYOTE, 
      stands a dozen yards behind them.  Like he appeared out of 
      thin air.  Rollie and Mindy look spooked.  He walks over. 

                                  COYOTE (CONT D)
                    Take these.

      He hands them two backpacks he had slung over his shoulder.

                    Blankets.  Oranges.  Water.  We go 
                    halfway and stop.  We wait for 
                    dark, then we cross at night.

      Raylan drives along the empty road.  He sees something up 
      ahead.  The Lumina, parked in a turn-out.

      Raylan pulls up next to the Lumina, gets out, already on his

      EXT. DESERT ROAD - TURNOUT - DAYB50B50

      Raylan hears an engine, turns.  He sees the black Mercedes 
      barrel into view on the road.

                                  RAYLAN
                          (into cell)
                    And an ambulance.

      He ends the call and puts the phone away and then steps out 
      toward the road and stands with empty hands at his sides.  
      The Mercedes stops some distance away from Raylan.  Frank and 
      Joe get out either side and start moving toward Raylan, 
      circling him, so that one is moving to his right and the 
      other to his left.  They both have handguns out, not pointing 
      at anything but not hidden, just held down beside their legs.  
      They get to within about thirty yards of Raylan.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    Right there s good.

      Frank and Joe ignore him, keep moving.  Raylan points with 
      his left hand at Frank.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    I changed my mind -- I ll take you 
                    first.

      This stops Frank cold.  He stands staring at Raylan, not sure 
      what his next move should be.  

      Joe keeps moving, doesn t even hesitate.

                                  JOE
                    We just wanna talk, Marshal, see if 
                    we can t work something out.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Can t see s we got anything to talk 
                    about, but if there s something you 
                    want to say, you can say it from 
                    there.

                                  JOE
                    I just wanna come a little closer, 
                    so we re not shouting at each other 
                    like a coupla drunk hobos.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You take one more step, I m gonna 
                    shoot you.

                                  JOE
                          (taking another step)
                    Come on now, Marshal--

      Joe starts to take another step.  Raylan draws fast and 
      shoots him.  Joe looks surprised.  He drops his gun and puts 
      both hands over the bloody wound in his stomach, but he 
      doesn t go down yet.

      Raylan has already turned to face Frank, who s standing in 
      the same place he was when he stopped. 

      Neither of them is pointing a gun, but both still have guns 
      in their hands.

                                  RAYLAN
                          (re: Frank s gun)
                    Use it or throw it away.

      Frank sags, defeated, starts to toss his gun.  But then, very 
      suddenly, he makes a quick move to raise his arm toward 
      Raylan with the gun still in his hand.  Raylan shoots him in 
      the chest.  Pink mist explodes from his back and he goes down 
      to stay. 

      Raylan turns back to Joe, now sitting on the ground, leaning 
      against a garbage can, his hands over his stomach, trying to 
      hold himself in.  Raylan walks over to him.  Joe s gun is on 
      the ground next to him, but he appears to have forgotten 
      about it.  Raylan kicks it away and squats in front of Joe.  
      Joe looks at Raylan with glazed eyes.  When he talks, his 
      mouth is full of blood.

                                  JOE
                          (sounding almost drunk)
                    Just need to sit here for a sec... 
                    catch my breath.

      Joe laughs, which turns almost immediately into gurgling.  He 
      stays sitting up, but his head lolls forward and he dies 
      choking on his own blood.

      The Coyote leads.  Rollie and Mindy look miserable.  
        Hot/tired/frayed.  The Coyote stops.

                          (eyeing Mindy)
                    Second thought, forget the watch.

                                  ROLLIE
                    Don t you even think about it.  

                                  COYOTE
                    I really wasn t asking permission. 

      The Coyote reaches out to Mindy.

                                  ROLLIE
                    I m warning you, don t touch her.

                                  COYOTE
                    Okay.  First I give her a sniff.  

      Rollie throws his backpack at the Coyote and follows it.  He 
      dives into him and takes him down.  The Coyote throttles 
      Rollie.  Rollie punches and gouges.  It s ugly, desperate.

      The Coyote pulls a squat KNIFE from his belt buckle.  He jams 
      it into Rollie s gut.  It comes back red.  Rollie clamps the 
      Coyote s throat.  He squeezes the veins.  Pure rage.

      He bashes the Coyote's head on the hardpan.  Over and over 
      and over.  

                                  ROLLIE
                    I m just a weak man, huh, pal?  
                    Who s weak now, shithead!

                    Rollie, stop.  Stop it.  Stop it!

      Rollie stops.  Snaps out of it.  He looks at Mindy, sees fear 
      in her eyes.  Then he looks down, sees the dead Coyote.

                                  ROLLIE
                    Oh, my God...

      He gets to his feet.  He looks at Mindy.

                                  ROLLIE (CONT D)
                    You gotta go back.  You gotta get

                                  ROLLIE
                    I was always afraid of this.

      EXT. DESERT - TRAIL - DAY5151

      Raylan sees something in the distance.  Buzzing flies bode 
      ill.  He comes upon the Coyote's corpse.  He sees a blood 
      trail leading off into the desert.  

      EXT. DESERT - THE BUS - DAY5252

      Mindy and Rollie arrive at a rusted, sun-bleached bus.  
      There s a hole through the roof, from the fire that obviously 
      scorched the entire inside.  

      Rollie and Mindy drop their packs.  Mindy gets out her water. 

                                  MINDY
                          (re: water)
                    I m empty.

                                  ROLLIE
                    Take mine.

                                  MINDY
                    How s your stomach?

                                  ROLLIE
                    It s fine.  I gotta pee.

      Rollie walks to some rocks.  Mindy sips from his canteen.

                                  MINDY
                    You re almost done.

      AT THE ROCKS

      He pulls down his belt and pulls up his shirt - not peeing, 
      checking his wound.

      AT THE BUS

      Mindy sits, leaning against the bus.  A silent shadow washes 
      up on her.  She looks up.  It s Raylan.  

                                  MINDY (CONT D)
                    Thank god.

                    Over there.  He s hurt. 

                                  RAYLAN
                    I ll get him help.  Rollie!

                                  ROLLIE
                    Mindy?  Who is it?  You okay?  

      Rollie peers around the mound of rocks. 

                                  RAYLAN
                    Hey, Rollie.

                                  ROLLIE
                          (relieved)
                    Ha.  Raylan.  Do you believe this?

                                  RAYLAN
                    It s one for the books.  You armed?

                                  ROLLIE
                    Well, I do have my dick in my hand. 

                                  RAYLAN
                    Ms. Springer says you re hurt.  Come 
                    here, let me take a look.  

                                  ROLLIE
                    Merely a scratch.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Rollie, it s over.

      Rollie hesitates, sighs, starts out of the rocks.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                  EP. 104 - "LONG IN THE TOOTH" - 2ND PINK  12/01/09    53.

                    I never did thank you for letting 
                    me slip in Brownsville.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I didn t let you slip.

                                  ROLLIE
                    Okay, Raylan.

      As Rollie steps into the clearing a SHOT RINGS OUT.  

      Rollie bolts back to the rocks.  

      Raylan covers Mindy, falls back behind the bus.  ANOTHER 
      shot.  ANOTHER.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    Stay there!  Don t move!

                                  RAYLAN
                    No, Rollie, that s the bad guys.  
                    Looks like they got a sniper 
                    waiting on the Mexican side.  

                                  ROLLIE
                    That s not going to help tourism.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Air support will run him off.  Just 
                    sit tight.  A few more minutes.

                                  ROLLIE
                    A few more minutes.  That sounds 
                    about right.  We know how this is 
                    going to go.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Help s on the way.

                    They gonna help me to Belize?  
                    That s where I was going, Ray, 
                    that s where I was taking Mindy.  
                    We were going to open a little 
                    clinic, fix poor kids  teeth.  But 
                    first?  Two weeks vacation.  White 
                    beach and a palm tree, sun going 
                    down on the water.  Mindy there in 
                    the hammock.  An ice cold beer.

                    Come on, Ray, you know.  They never 
                    let anyone do what they did in 
                    their old life.  I ll be lucky if 
                    I m a greeter at Walmart.

      Rock shatters near Rollie.  Raylan returns fire.  The sniper 
      fires back.  More splintering dirt and rock.

                    You got good cover, just wait him 
                    out.  You can make it.

      Rollie feels his gut.  His hand comes away dark. 

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    Explain something to me, Rollie.
                    You say you want to fix poor kids  
                    teeth.  That sounds like the stand-
                    up man I talked to in Brownsville, 
                    the one gave me his word.  Doesn t 
                    sound like the fella who skipped 
                    out on me.

                                  ROLLIE
                    For what it s worth, Raylan, when I

                    on the TV in Brownsville.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Really?  

                                  ROLLIE
                    You remember a character named 
                    Hermey?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Help me out.

                                  MINDY
                    Hermey s the elf who makes toys but 
                    really wants to be a dentist.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    You mean the gay elf?

                                  ROLLIE
                    He s not gay.

                                  RAYLAN
                    If you re telling me you re gay...

                                  ROLLIE
                    I m not gay!

                                  MINDY
                    He s really not.

                                  ROLLIE
                    At any rate, and I don t know why, 
                    but when I was a kid, Hermey really 
                    got to me.  I got picture books on 
                      dentistry, little kid dentist 
                    tools...  Eventually I forgot about 
                    it, grew out of it.  Then, when I 
                    walked into that bar in Brownsville 
                    and saw it on the TV, it was like a 
                    message from heaven telling me what 
                    I had to do.  
                          (beat)
                    Go ahead.  You can laugh now.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Why would I laugh?

                                  ROLLIE
                    Because it s so stupid.  Basing a 
                    decision like that on some TV show 
                    you saw as a kid.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I don t know.  I can t imagine all 
                    the hours I spent watching Gunsmoke 
                    didn t have something to do with me 
                    becoming a marshal.
                          (beat)
                    What happened to the money you 
                    took?

                                  ROLLIE
                    Even dental school in Panama isn t 
                    cheap.  Plus, setting up a 
                    practice.  I also spent thirty-
                    thousand dollars making you think I 
                    went to Nicaragua.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Money well spent.

                                  ROLLIE
                    I saw how you killed that gun thug 
                    who went after me.  Thanks for 
                    that.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Don t mention it.

      Then they notice it s been quiet for some time.

                                  ROLLIE
                    You hear that?  All that nothing?  
                    You know what that means, don t 
                    you?  He s moving.  He s gonna get 
                    us from the other side. 

                                  RAYLAN
                    He s waiting.  And so are we.   

                                  ROLLIE
                    All he wants is me, Ray.  You know 
                    the pros, they get their target, 
                    they re done.  Unless he has to 
                    come around and someone sees him.  
                    In that case, after he kills me 
                    he s going to kill you and Mindy.

                                  RAYLAN
                    No, he s not.

                                  ROLLIE
                          (more to himself)
                    And what kind of man would I be if 
                    I let that happen.

      Rollie looks at his bloody wound.

                                  ROLLIE (CONT D)
                    You know what?  I ve been running 
                    long enough.  I had my fun.  I m 
                    ready to surrender now.  Nothing 
                    wrong with being a greeter at 
                    WalMart. 

                                  MINDY
                    Baby, what re you doing--?

                                  ROLLIE
                    Get those handcuffs ready, Ray.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Rollie, you stay the hell there!

                                  ROLLIE
                    I love you, Mindy.  

      Rollie crouches like he's going to run.  

      Raylan has no choice but to give him cover.  He starts firing 
      in the direction of the sniper.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                  EP. 104 - "LONG IN THE TOOTH" - 2ND PINK  12/01/09    58.

      But Rollie doesn t run, he just stands up.  He smiles and 
      shuts his eyes.  His chest blooms with blood a split-second 
      before the sound of the rifle-shot reaches them.  Rollie 
      drops.  

      Raylan sees...

      The SNIPER -- a figure in the distance -- running back toward 
      Mexico.  

      Raylan fires his gun until it is empty.  

      The sniper disappears.  No more shots from the hills.  

      Raylan pulls Rollie s body to cover.  He pulls a blanket from 
      one of the packs.  He covers the body.  

      Mindy weeps.

      A chopper is heard in the distance.

      I/E. RENTAL CAR - DRIVING - NIGHTA53A53

      Rachel drives; Raylan sits with his head back and his hat low 
      over his face, maybe asleep.  Rachel looks at Raylan for a 
      moment, then takes his hat and tries it on.

                                  RAYLAN
                    It fit?

                                  RACHEL
                    Nope.

      Rachel hands the hat back.  Raylan puts it on.  Rachel goes 
      back to driving and Raylan goes back to sleep.

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.
