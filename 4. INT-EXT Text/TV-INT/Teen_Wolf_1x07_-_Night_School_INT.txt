      The school doors slam shut, shaking on their hinges as Scott 
      and Stiles grip the handlebars with everything they ve got.

                                  SCOTT
                    Lock it, lock it!

                                  STILES
                    Do I look like I have a key?

                                  SCOTT
                    Grab something--

                    What?

                                  SCOTT
                    Anything.

      While Scott clutches the handlebars, Stiles looks out the 
      doors to the BOLT CUTTERS leaning against the wall outside.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    No.

                    Yes.

                                  SCOTT
                    No, Stiles, don t--

      But he pushes past Scott, stepping out into the cold air.


      Stiles charges back in with the bolt cutters. Scott grabs the 
      other handle, the two of them fumbling to get both sides of 
      the tool down into the bars, a makeshift lock.

      When they look up again the WALKWAY leading to the doors lies 
      empty. A few leaves tumble across the pavement.

      They slowly retreat back, taking each step faster and faster 
      until--

      They re running.


      Scott and Stiles hurtle into a dark classroom.

                    The desk--the desk.

      They slip around the teacher s desk and start pushing it 
      toward the door only to flinch at the LOUD SQUEAL of metal 
      against tile.

      Scott nods. They turn to the windows to view the parking lot. 
      Quietly stepping to the furthest window, they spot Stiles s

      Scott and Stiles sit frozen underneath the classroom window,

      The classroom door cracks open. Scott and Stiles slip into

      glance around in terrified desperation. 

      There is nowhere to hide. 

      Stiles looks to Scott with pleading eyes. But Scott doesn t 
      seem to know what to do either. So Stiles reaches for a

      The movement happens so quickly it leaves Scott and Stiles

      THE JANITOR S FACE COMES SLAMMING BACK TO THE DOOR S WINDOW. 

      Scott and Stiles stagger away in shock as the body of the 
      Janitor slams forward again, rattling the door in its frame.

      Scott grabs at the door, trying to get it open, trying to 
      help the man as Stiles pulls him back.

      Both of them SCREAMING, Scott and Stiles finally run for it, 
      racing down the corridor as--

      THE LOCKER ROOM DOOR wrenches off its hinges, BURSTING into 
      the corridor and falling to the floor. The Janitor s dead 
      body collapses down onto the door and then in one swift

      FADE IN:


      Feet flying across the floor, Scott and Stiles race for the 
      exit at the end of the hall. They reach the fire door handles 
      at the same time, pushing down and shoving forward.

      The doors OPEN, but only an inch, CLANGING against something 
      behind them. Pushing again, they hear the same METALLIC 
      CLANG. Something is on the other side, blocking the doors.

                                  STILES
                    What the hell?

      Scott peers out the open inch of the door.

                                  SCOTT
                    It s a dumpster. A garbage 
                    dumpster.

      The two slowly retreat a few steps.

                                  STILES
                    He pushed it in front of the doors--

                                  SCOTT
                    --to trap us in.

      Stiles turns, backing into the door, trying to push off from 
      his feet and move the dumpster behind it.

                                  STILES
                    Help me.

      The door CLANGS against the dumpster again and again as he 
      keeps trying to muscle it open.

                                  SCOTT
                    Stiles, stop.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 107" GOLDENROD DRAFT1/10/1113.

                    not dying in school.

                                  SCOTT
                    We re not going to die.

                                  STILES
                    Then what s it doing? What does it 
                    want?

                                  SCOTT

                    into teamwork. That s beautiful.

      They retreat from the doors again, looking down the other end 
      of the hall. But their cautious progression comes to a halt 
      when Scott pauses. He turns to the wall of windows at the 
      side of the corridor looking out on the courtyard and 
      opposite side of the school.

      ON THE ROOF - A figure crouches in the darkness, RED EYES 
      gazing directly at them.

      Scott and Stiles start moving, running, nearly stumbling over 
      each other as--        TEEN WOLF "Episode 107" GOLDENROD DRAFT1/10/1114.

      THE ALPHA bounds from one level of the roof to the next, 
      landing and leaping in the same instant as Scott and Stiles 
      race ahead.

      BEHIND THEM GLASS EXPLODES into the hallway, the Alpha 
      crashing back into the school.

      Scott grabs Stiles, pulling him to the adjacent stairwell.

                                  SCOTT
                    Down, down!

      They race into the lower level of the school, running for 
      safety while--


      Scott and Stiles back into the basement of the school, 
      slipping around corners. Florescent lights flicker above them 
      with an ELECTRIC CRACKLING.

                                  STILES
                    We have to do something.

                                  SCOTT
                    Like what?

                                  STILES
                    Kill it. Hurt it. Inflict mental 
                    anguish on it. Something.

      Stiles glances at the doors with mesh cage windows in them, 
      old and dirty lockers lying open inside. Trying to think 
      fast, eyes darting as--

      A DOOR SLAMS OPEN behind them.

      The two of them pull back into the darkness. Holding still, 
      they hear a STRANGE CLICKING on the floor, claws tapping 
      against the tile.

      Stiles s eyes move from the thin corridor to where several 
      old ADMINISTRATIVE DESKS lie stacked against the wall. Scott 
      catches his look, seeing an idea come to fruition.

      Stiles slowly--very slowly--moves his hand into his coat 
      pocket to pull out his CAR KEYS. He brings them up. They 
      JANGLE softly, causing both boys to flinch.

      Scott glares at Stiles, eyes nearly coming out of his head. 
      Especially when his friend rears back and--

      THROWS THE KEYS.

      They land right in one of the cage rooms, CLATTERING AGAINST 
      THE WALL.

      Something BLURS past, A MASSIVE SHAPE in the darkness, 
      soaring in after the keys.

      Without hesitating, Stiles jumps out of the shadows and slams 
      the door shut behind it.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 107" GOLDENROD DRAFT1/10/1116A.

      CONTINUED:1212

      With barely a second to comprehend the plan, Scott rushes to 
      one of the steel desks and rams it against the closed door. 
      Stiles slips out of the way as the door JERKS FORWARD hitting 
      the side of the desk.

      The Alpha ROARS from inside the cage room, SLAMMING into the 
      door. But the desk wedges between it and the opposite wall.

      Scott and Stiles turn to each other in a moment of pure 
      triumph. The Alpha can t get out.

      They trapped it.


      Waiting behind the wheel, Jackson stares at Stiles s Jeep, 
      studying it in the darkness.

                                    JACKSON

                    Fine. Don t have a meltdown.

      He steps out, Lydia clicking her own door open.


      Stiles and Scott stand on opposite sides of the desk now 
      wedged between the cage door and the wall. Stiles slowly 
      motions with his hand for Scott to climb over. But Scott 
      looks too scared to move.

      A BREATH comes from inside the cage room. 

      Both boys turn back. They can t see it in the darkness, but 
      the Alpha is there, trapped inside.

      With a far more emphatic look, Stiles twists his head at 
      Scott, trying to get him to climb over the desk to him.

      Finally, Scott moves, awkwardly sliding over the desk as--

      THE ALPHA S HAND SLAMS UP against the mesh wire window of the 
      door sending both Stiles and Scott flinching back. They stare 
      at the massive hand, clawed fingers like talons fitting 
      through the openings. It slowly pulls back, disappearing 
      again into the shadows.

      Incredibly, Stiles starts toward the cage room.

                                  STILES
                    It s trapped. It can t get out.

      The cage RATTLES as if in response.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                          (more confident now)
                    That s right. We got you.

                                  SCOTT
                    Shut up.

                                  STILES
                    No. I m not scared of this thing.
                          (to the Alpha)
                    I m not scared of you. Because 
                    you re not going any--

      Suddenly the Alpha LEAPS UP, SHOOTING RIGHT INTO THE CEILING. 
      THE PANELS BURST away, CRASHING and CLATTERING to the floor.  

      Scott and Stiles gaze up in horror as the ceiling panels 
      above them SHAKE, bending and popping up under the weight of 
      the creature. No longer trapped at all.

      They turn to watch the panels rumble and shake above as the 
      Alpha makes its retreat.


      Heels clicking down the hallway, Allison peeks into one 
      classroom after another.

      Her voice echoes down the corridor. Shadows bounce across the 
      walls as she moves toward a stairwell.

                    Are you kidding? You have to use 
                    the bathroom? Now?

                                  LYDIA
                    Yes, now. You have a problem with

                    I m starting to have a problem with 
                    all your functions.

      Ignoring his comment, she pushes through the door. Arms 
      folded, Jackson gazes back to the empty corridor. But his 
      arms fall to his sides when he sees something...

      A LARGE SILHOUETTED FIGURE. At the end of the corridor. 
      Standing there. Watching him.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    McCall?

      He steps forward, trying to catch any detail of the figure at 
      the end of the hall. But it s an almost perfect silhouette. 
      And still strangely motionless.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    Scott?

      Then, almost as an inaudible whisper, he says another name...

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    Derek?

      The silhouette moves from a standing position down to all 
      fours. Then, almost casually, it lopes into the next hallway, 
        disappearing around the corner.

      Short gasps choke their way between Jackson s lips as he 
      stares down the long corridor until--

      THE GIRL S ROOM DOOR slams open, sending him nearly off his 
      feet.

      Walking on the tile floor between the school s two swimming 
      pools, Allison stops when her phone begins RINGING. She pulls 
      it out to answer.


      Still in the basement, Scott turns to Stiles.

      Allison s PHONE RINGS again. She picks up.

                    Where are you?

      Jackson and Lydia hurry around the corner.

                    Finally. Can we go now?        TEEN WOLF "Episode 107" GOLDENROD DRAFT1/10/1124.

      But before any of them can speak they hear an odd RUMBLING 
      above them.

                                  SCOTT
                    Run.

      He spins, pushing them forward as SOMETHING BURSTS OUT OF THE 
      CEILING PANELS behind them.


      The doors to the cafeteria SLAM open, five frightened 
      teenagers rushing in.

                                  STILES
                    Scott, wait--not here--not here.

      But he isn t listening. Swinging the doors closed, Scott 
      spins back to search for a way to barricade them in.

                                  SCOTT
                    The vending machine. Help me push 
                    it in front of the doors.

                                    ALLISON
                    What was that? Scott, what was 
                    that?

                                  LYDIA
                    What happened to the ceiling?

      He doesn t answer, concentrating his efforts on shoving one 
      of the vending machines forward.

                                  SCOTT
                    Just help me!

      Jackson and Allison get behind it as well, sliding it against 
      the doors. Scott s panic seems to infect them all, 
      heightening the fear among the group.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)

      Even a frightened Lydia helps, pushing chairs forward, moving 
      as fast as she can.

      Jackson and Allison grab chairs, stacking them, everyone 
      rushing to blockade the doors. Everyone except for Stiles.

                    Okay, nice work. Beautiful job,

                    wall of windows!

      Stiles shakes his hands at the field of glass to his right. 
      Scott and the others look up. Good point.

                                    ALLISON
                    Can someone please explain what s

                    I d at least like to know why.

      Scott doesn t respond. Doesn t even look at her.

                    Someone killed the janitor.

      Stiles looks to Scott for help. But his friend almost seems 
      to be shutting down. Just shaking his head, no idea what to 
      say while Allison and the others become more panicked.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)

      All eyes turn back to him in shock. Especially Stiles. Scott 
      looks almost surprised at saying it himself.

      He snaps at her, causing Allison to flinch noticeably. Behind 
      her, Jackson can t help but smile just a little bit. Stiles 
      gets in between them to pull Scott aside.

                    That s it. Give me your phone.

      He spins Stiles around, grabbing for the phone in his pocket. 
      But in a moment of pure instinct, Stiles reels back and 
      CLOCKS Jackson, sending him sprawling to the floor.

      Strangely, Lydia isn t the one running to help him up. It s

      While he s turned around, she can t see the look on his face. 
      And despite being punched, he s smiling, silently pleased by 
      the turn of events. He slowly gazes back, feigning shock and 
      hurt.

      Cradling his shaking hand, Stiles looks to Scott who is just 
      as surprised. Then, with the hand not trembling in pain,

      SOMETHING SLAMS AGAINST THE DOORS. Lydia SCREAMS, Allison 
      retreating to her side.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 107" GOLDENROD DRAFT1/10/1132.

                          (talking quickly)
                    We re at the school--Dad--we re at 
                    the school--

      WHAM! A stack of chairs tumble down as the barricade against 
      the doors begins to fall. Stiles lowers the phone, backing 
      away with the others.

      Something HAMMERS at the doors. SMASHING at them, POUNDING, 
      desperately trying to BREAK THROUGH.

      THE VENDING MACHINE SLIDES FORWARD. A chair whips past 
      Allison as if thrown like a projectile. She screams, hands *
      coming up.*

                                  LYDIA
                    Oh God, oh my God--

      THE HINGES at the top of the doors begin coming out of the 
      wall, metal seeming to bend and collapse inward.

                    kitchen leads to the stairwell.

                    Up is better than here.

      ANOTHER BOOM and the decision is made. They run for the 
      kitchen.


      THE STAIRWELL DOOR slams open. Scott and the others spill out 
      into the second floor hallway. They try doors. All locked. 
      Until Lydia finds an open one and--


      They hurtle into a Chemistry room, quickly and quietly 
      shutting the door. Scott grabs the teacher s chair and fits 
      it under the knob as they hear-- 

      THE STAIRWELL DOOR SLAMS OPEN.

      Everyone backs away to the wall where they can t be seen at 
      the window of the door, each holding their breath.         TEEN WOLF "Episode 107" GOLDENROD DRAFT1/10/1133.

      Jackson, Lydia, Allison, Scott and Stiles, all press to the 
      wall in terror.

      Closest to the door, Scott slowly leans out from the wall. 
      Stiles grabs at him, trying to get him to pull back. But 
      Scott cocks his head, listening...

      He hears the CLICK of CLAWS against the tile floor. The 
      creature coming closer and closer. The door RATTLES from the 
      weight of its approach.

      Lydia covers her mouth with her hands, trying not to shriek 
      as a BREATH STEAMS THE WINDOW at the door. And then...

      It moves on, the sound of its lumbering body dissipating. 
      After a moment, the kids breathe. But no one moves. Eyes 
      still on the window of the door, Scott whispers--

                                  SCOTT
                    Jackson, how many people can fit in 
                    your car?

                    Five? I barely fit into the back.

                    What about this?

      Scott s eyes to the STEEL DOOR past the teacher s desk.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    It leads to the roof. We could go *

                    I can find him by scent. By blood.

                    It s the best plan. Someone has to 
                    get the key if we want to get out 
                    of here.

      Scott grabs the teacher s POINTER from the chalkboard, 
      gripping it like a baseball bat. Then notices their looks.

                                  LYDIA
                    There is.

      Lydia nods to the CABINET full of CHEMICALS.

      He turns each bottle, looking for the right one, then 
      carefully hands it to Lydia.

                      something.

      Turning, he eases the chair out from under the doorknob.

                                    ALLISON
                    Scott, stop.

                    Stop. Just stop.

      She has tears in her eyes, out of fear and anger.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    Remember how you told me that you d 
                    know whether or not I was lying? 
                    That I have a tell? So do you.
                          (off his look)
                    You re a terrible liar. And you ve 
                    been lying all night.

      The others listen behind her, watching with evident 
      discomfort as Scott almost responds with another lie but then 
      keeps his mouth shut.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    Don t leave us.

      Furthest from the group, Jackson practically has to bite his 
      lip to keep from smiling.

                                  SCOTT
                    Lock it behind me.

      But before he can turn, Allison steps forward. As the others *
      watch, she pulls him toward her, pressing her lips to his in *
      a kiss of pure pleading. Scott gently eases back and breaks *
      the kiss. With a look of torture on his face, he turns and--*

      Goes out the door. It CLICKS shut as--*        TEEN WOLF "Episode 107" GOLDENROD DRAFT1/10/1136.



      The door to the darkened stairwell eases open. All too aware 
      of his own frightened gasps, Scott steps inside and peers 
      down...

      No sign of movement. He begins taking the steps one-by-one, 
      inching his way back to the first floor.


      Scott steps around the corner, breathing the air in, cocking 
      his head... and catching a scent.


      TWO DOUBLE DOORS quietly click open allowing Scott to step 
      into the school s cavernous gymnasium. A large wide-open 
      space, it s lit only by the emergency lights mounted over the 
      two exits. 

      Clutching the MOLOTOV COCKTAIL in his hand, Scott takes a 
      breath of the air, his head turning toward THE TELESCOPING 
      BLEACHERS against the wall.

      He makes his way over. But instead of climbing up, he steps 
      around and UNDERNEATH the bleachers.

      Through the dark recesses Scott ventures deeper and deeper. 
      Feeling his way through the underside of the bleachers, he 
      slowly peers up to discover something hanging in the shadows 
      above.

      THE JANITOR S KEYS.

      Hanging from his body which itself hangs from the metal 
      supports crosshatching the underside of the bleachers...

                                                                          FADE OUT:

                                        ACT SIX

      FADE IN:


      Stiles, Lydia, Jackson and Allison sit, lined up against the 
      wall while waiting for Scott s return.

                                    ALLISON
                            (whispering)
                    I don t get this. I don t get why *
                    he s out there, why he left and... *
                      I can t... I can t get my hands to *
                    stop shaking. My hands--

                                    JACKSON
                    It s going to be okay.

      Stiles turns, hearing the whispers. He glances to Lydia who 
      seems strangely calm. Almost like she s determined not to be 
      frightened anymore while Jackson leans closer to Allison.

                                    ALLISON
                    I can t stop shaking.

                                    JACKSON
                    It s okay.

      He puts his hands over hers, their fingers intertwining, 
      trying to keep her calm while his eyes linger over her just a 
      little too long.


      Scott gently sets the MOLOTOV COCKTAIL down on the floor. He 
      reaches for one of the metal supports underneath the 
      bleachers. Stepping gingerly up, he begins climbing, making 
      his way toward the KEYS which hang from the Janitor s belt. 

      After one last step, he stretches his arm, trying to grasp at 
      the keys when--

      A CLUNKING SOUND makes him stop.

      He holds still, eyes darting to the shadows. Then cocks his 
      head to listen. But there s nothing. He reaches up again for 
      the keys when--        TEEN WOLF "Episode 107" GOLDENROD DRAFT1/10/1138.

      CONTINUED:3030

      ANOTHER CLUNK causes the supports to shudder. Turning back, 
      he sees what the source of the sound is when--

      THE BLEACHERS START COLLAPSING INWARD.

      Someone or SOMETHING is pushing the seats in from the gym 
      floor, causing the bleachers to telescope in on him.

      With a well-aimed swipe, Scott snatches the keys off the 
      body. He jumps back to the floor between the bleachers and 
      the wall and hurtles for the light just beyond.

      But the bleachers close in fast, threatening to crush in on 
      him as he makes one last leap. He grabs the MOLOTOV COCKTAIL 
      on the floor and--

      Tumbles out to safety.


      At the teacher s desk, Lydia glances at the bottles of 
      chemicals they used to make the Molotov Cocktail.

                                  LYDIA
                    Jackson, you handed me the sulfuric 
                    acid, right? It has to be sulfuric *
                    acid. It won t ignite, if it s 
                    not...

      She looks back at him to find him glaring at her.

                                    JACKSON
                    I gave you exactly what you asked 
                    for. Didn t I?

      He stares at her, unblinking. An unnerving, frightening 
      stare. Lydia looks back at the bottle.

                                  LYDIA
                    Yeah. Yeah, I m sure you did.


      Standing at the edge of the collapsed bleachers, Scott 
      shakily raises the Molotov Cocktail.

                                  SCOTT
                    Come on. Come and get me.

      SOMETHING comes rushing forward as Scott hurls the cocktail 
      and squeezes his eyes shut waiting for the fiery explosion.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 107" GOLDENROD DRAFT1/10/1138A.

        CONTINUED:30B30B

      But all he hears is breaking glass. He snaps his eyes open to 
      see harmless chemicals spilling across the floor.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Oh damn.

      SOMETHING latches around his ankle and drops him right to the 
      floor. The KEYS tumble out of his grasp as he s hurled to the 
      center of the gym. 

      A CLAWED HAND clamps down on the side of Scott's head, 
      pushing his face to the floor. The tips of the claws poke 
      into his cheek, threatening to draw blood as his eyes open 
      wide.

      Then the ALPHA S SILHOUETTED PROFILE eases down toward 
      Scott s face, sharp teeth jutting from its open mouth. It 
      lets loose a ROAR as powerful and earth-shaking as the cry of 
      a T-Rex. 

      Pinned and helpless, Scott s eyes suddenly blaze with a 
      YELLOW GLOW as if in response to the Alpha s roar. He opens 
      his mouth, teeth now fanged.

      He s beginning to shift...


      The others turn to hear the echoes of the bizarre sound 
      coming from the school below. All except for Jackson who--

      Falls to his knees, wincing in pain. Then he s SCREAMING. 
      Hand clutching the back of his neck, he crumbles to the floor 
      as the others whirl around to see him lurching in pain.


      Scott twists up, the Alpha no longer holding him down, no 
      longer anywhere in sight. Eyes yellow, he cries out as he 
      transforms into a werewolf.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 107" GOLDENROD DRAFT1/10/1139.

      CONTINUED:3232

      But brought on this time by the howl of the Alpha, the shift 
      is agonizing, his body wracked with spasms of pain, clawed 
      hands pressing, almost digging into the floor.

      His head whips up as the transformation completes. But 
      something is different. Teeth bared, an animalistic pulling 
      back of his lips, it s as if innocent Scott McCall has 
      disappeared completely. Nowhere to be found behind the yellow 
      eyes now searching the shadows for something...

      Something to kill.


      Allison and Lydia pull Jackson back to his feet.

                                    JACKSON
                    I m fine. Seriously, I m okay.

      He pulls away, into the shadows, so they can t see him as--


      The door SLAMS open against the wall, rattling on its hinges.  
      Clawed hands at his sides, Scott slowly takes the steps, a 
      hunched darkened figure.

                    It s been there for days and he 
                    won t tell me what happened--

      A shadow falls across the floor. Scott steps back into the 
      corridor. Head turned down, his approach is slow and 
      deliberate, eyes glaring up with a murderous stare.


      Stiles steps in between Lydia and Jackson.

                                  STILES
                    Can we not argue for half a second *
                    here?

                                    ALLISON
                    Where s Scott? He should be back by *
                    now.

      She doesn t see the silhouette moving in front of the door--


      Just outside, Scott approaches the door. He fits the 
      Janitor s MASTER KEY into the lock while his other clawed 
      hand comes up. His breath is ragged, almost strangled by low 
      growls rising from the back of his throat. 

      Chest heaving with each gasp, eyes squeezing shut as if 
      trying to hold the monster at bay--

      Scott SNAPS the KEY off in the lock.


      Allison sees a SILHOUETTED FACE at the door.

                                    ALLISON
                    Scott?

      She hurries for the door. Grabbing the knob, she twists but 
      is unable to open it. She looks out, seeing only the back of 
      Scott s head.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    Scott? What are you doing?

      Head still turned, he starts to move. Walking away from her.

                                  LYDIA
                    Where s he going?

                                    ALLISON

      She pounds on the door, yanking at the knob, SHOUTING his 
      name until finally Lydia s voice cries out over hers.

                                  LYDIA
                    Stop, stop! Do you hear that? 
                    Listen.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 107" GOLDENROD DRAFT1/10/1139B.

      SIRENS. All three of them rush the windows to look out on--

      THE SCHOOL PARKING LOT - where Deputy Sheriff cars race in, 
      RED AND BLUE LIGHTS whirling into the darkness.


      As the SIRENS grow louder and louder, Scott slumps down to 
      the floor, shaking, forehead beaded with sweat...

      But normal once again.
