Carl leans down to hoist up the body.
Headlights appear:
an oncoming car.
The car approaches, slowing.
Carl, with the trooper's body hoisted halfway up, is frozen
in the headlights.
The car accelerates and roars past and away.
We just make
out the silhouettes of two occupants in front.
The wrecked car's headlights shine off into a snowfield
abutting the highway.
A young man in a down parka is
limping across the snowfield, away from the wrecked car.
Grimsrud strides calmly out after the injured boy.
He
raises his gun and fires.
With a poof of feathers, a hole opens up in the boy's back
and he pitches into the snow.
Grimsrud walks up to the wreck and peers in its half-open
door.
A young woman is trapped inside the twisted wreckage,
injured.
Snow swirls in the headlights of the wreck.
Grimsrud raises his gun and fires.
AN OIL PAINTING
A blue-winged teal in flight over a swampy marshland.
The
room in which it hangs is dark.
We hear off-screen snoring.
We track off to reveal an easel upon which we see a half-
completed oil of a grey mallard.
The continuing track reveals a couple in bed, sleeping.
The
man, fortyish, pajama-clad, is big, and big-bellied.
His
mouth is agape.
He snores.
His arms are flung over a woman
in her thirties, wearing a nightie, mouth also open, not
snoring.
We hold for a long beat on their regular breathing and
snoring.
The phone rings.
The woman stirs.
WOMAN
Oh, geez...
She reaches for the phone.
WOMAN
...
Hi, it's Marge...
The man stirs and clears his throat with a long deep rumble.
MARGE
...
Oh, my.
Where?...
Yah...
Oh, geez...
The man sits up, gazes stupidly about.
MARGE
...
Okay.
There in a jif...
Real good, then.
She hangs up.
MARGE
...
You can sleep, hon.
It's
early yet.
MAN
Gotta go?
MARGE
Yah.
The man swings his legs out.
MAN
I'll fix ya some eggs.
MARGE
That's okay, hon.
I gotta run.
MAN
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.
I'll fix ya some eggs.
MARGE
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
MAN
Ya gotta eat a breakfast...
He clears his throat with another deep rumble.
MAN
...
I'll fix ya some eggs.
MARGE
Aw, Norm.
PLATE
Leavings of a huge plate of eggs, ham, toast.
Wider, we see Marge now wearing a beige police uniform.
A
patch on one arm says BRAINERD POLICE DEPARTMENT.
She wears
a heavy belt holding a revolver, walkie-talkie and various
other jangling police impedimenta.
Norm is in a dressing
gown.
MARGE
Thanks, hon.
Time to shove off.
NORM
Love ya, Margie.
As she struggles into a parka:
MARGE
Love ya, hon.
He is exiting back to the bedroom; she exits out the front
door.
Dawn.
Marge is making her way down the icy front stoop to
her prowler.
It is a lakeside cabin surrounded by white.
A brown Ciera
with dealer plates is pulling into the drive.
Grimsrud climbs out of the passenger seat as Carl climbs out
of the driver's.
Grimsrud opens the back door and, with an
arm on her elbow, helps Jean out.
She has her hands tied
behind her and a black hood over her head.
With a cry, she swings her elbow out of Grimsrud's grasp and
lurches away across the front lawn.
Grimsrud moves to
retrieve her but Carl, grinning, lays a hand on his
shoulder.
CARL
Hold it.
They both look out at the front lawn, Grimsrud
expressionless, Carl smiling.
With muffled cries, the hooded woman lurches across the
unbroken snow, staggering this way and that, stumbling on
the uneven terrain.
She stops, stands still, her hooded head swaying.
She lurches out in an arbitrary direction.
Going downhill,
she reels, staggers, and falls face-first into the snow,
weeping.
CARL
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Jesus!
Grimsrud, still expressionless, breaks away from Carl's
restraining hand to retrieve her.
BRAINERD POLICE HEADQUARTERS
We track behind Marge as she makes her way across the floor,
greeting various officers.
She holds a small half-full
paper sack.
Beyond her we see a small glassed-in cublcle.
Norm sits at
the desk inside with a box lunch spread out in front of him.
There is lettering on the cubicle's glass door:
BRAINERD
PD. CHIEF GUNDERSON.
Marge enters and sits behind the desk, detaching her walkie-
talkie from her utility belt to accomodate the seat.
MARGE
Hiya, hon.
She slides the paper sack toward him.
NORM
Brought ya some lunch, Margie.
What're those, night crawlers?
He looks inside.
The bottom of the sack is full of fat, crawling earthworms.
MARGE
Yah.
NORM
Thanks, hon.
MARGE
You bet.
Thanks for lunch.
What
do we got here, Arbie's?
NORM
Uh-huh.
She starts eating.
MARGE
...
How's the paintin' goin'?
NORM
Pretty good.
Found out the Hautmans
are entering a painting this year.
MARGE
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
NORM
They're real good.
MARGE
They're good, Norm, but you're
better'n them.
NORM
Yah, ya think?
He leans over and kisses her.
MARGE
Ah, ya got Arbie's all o'er me.
Lou enters.
LOU
Hiya, Norm, how's the paintin'
goin'?
NORM
Not too bad.
You know.
MARGE
How we doin' on that vehicle?
LOU
No motels registered any tan Ciera
last night.
But the night before,
two men checked into the Blue Ox
registering a Ciera and leavin' the
tag space blank.
MARGE
Geez, that's a good lead.
The
Blue Ox, that's that trucker's
joint out there on I-35?
LOU
Yah.
Owner was on the desk then,
said these two guys had company.
MARGE
Oh, yah?
Marge's prowler is parked in an otherwise empty lot.
Snow
drifts down.
It is now dusk.
The brown Ciera with dealer plates still
sits in the drive.
Wade, briefcase in hand, gets into his Cadillac, slams the
door and peels out.
The car pulls into the driveway.
FOYER
Jerry enters and sits on the foyer chair to take off his
galoshes.
SCOTT'S VOICE
...
Dad?
JERRY
Yah.
SCOTT'S VOICE
Stan Grossman called.
JERRY
Yah, okay.
SCOTT'S VOICE
Twice.
JERRY
Okay.
SCOTT'S VOICE
...
Is everything okay?
JERRY
Yah.
Thoonk - the first boot comes off.
SCOTT'S VOICE
Are you calling Stan?
JERRY
Well...
I'm goin' ta bed now.
CARL'S CAR
Carl mumbles as he drives, underlit by the dim dash lights,
one hand now holding a piece of rag to his shredded jaw.
CARL
...
Fnnkn ashlzh...
Fnk...
ROAD
Carl's car roars into frame, violently swirling the snow.
Its red tail lights fishtail away.
FADE OUT
HOLD IN BLACK
HARD CUT TO:
BRIGHT - LOOKING THROUGH A WINDSHIELD
It is a starky sunny day.
We are cruising down a street of
humble lookalike houses.
We pan right as we draw toward one house in particular.
In
its driveway a man in a hooded parka shovels snow.
He
notices the approaching car and gives its driver a wave.
The driver is Gary, the Brainderd police officer.
He gives
a finger-to-the-head salute and pulls over.
OUTSIDE
Gary slams his door shut and the other man plants his shovel
in the snow.
MAN
How ya doin'?
GARY
Mr. Mohra?
MAN
Yah.
GARY
Officer Olson.
MAN
Yah, right-o.
The two men caucus the driveway without shaking hands and
without standing particularly close.
They stand stiffly,
arms down at their sides and breath streaming out of their
parka hoods.
Each has an awkward leaning-away posture, head
drawn slightly back and chin tucked in, to keep his face
from protruding into the cold.
MAN
...
So, I'm tendin' bar there at
Ecklund && Swedlin's last Tuesday
and this little guy's drinkin'
and he says, 'So where can a guy
find some action - I'm goin' crazy
down there at the lake.'
And I
says, 'What kinda action?' and he
says, 'Woman action, what do I
look like,'
And I says 'Well,
what do I look like, I don't
arrange that kinda thing,' and he
says, 'I'm goin' crazy out there
at the lake' and I says, 'Well,
this ain't that kinda place.'
GARY
Uh-huh.
MAN
So he says, 'So I get it, so you
think I'm some kinda jerk for
askin',' only he doesn't use the
word jerk.
GARY
I unnerstand.
MAN
And then he calls me a jerk and
says the last guy who thought he
was a jerk was dead now.
So I
don't say nothin' and he says, 'What
do ya think about that?'
So I
says, 'Well, that don't sound like
too good a deal for him then.'
GARY
Ya got that right.
MAN
And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead
and I don't mean a old age.'
And
then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin'
crazy out there at the lake.'
GARY
White Bear Lake?
MAN
Well, Ecklund && Swedlin's, that's
closer ta Moose Lake, so I made
that assumption.
GARY
Oh sure.
MAN
So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I
don't think a whole great deal of
it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the
homicides out here and she thought
I should call it in, so I called
it in.
End a story.
GARY
What'd this guy look like anyways?
MAN
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda
funny-lookin'.
GARY
Uh-huh - in what way?
MAN
Just a general way.
GARY
Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr.
Mohra.
You're right, it's probably
nothin', but thanks for callin'
her in.
MAN
Oh sure.
They say she's gonna
turn cold tomorrow.
GARY
Yah, got a front movin' in.
MAN
Ya got that right.
CLOSE ON CARL SHOWALTER
In his car, now parked, one hand holding the rag pressed to
his mangled jaw.
He is staring down at something in the
front seat next to him.
His other hand holds open the briefcase.
It has money
inside - a lot of money.
Carl unfreezes, takes out one of the bank-wrapped wads and
looks at it.
CARL
...
Mmmnphh.
He paws through the money in the briefcase to get a feeling
for the amount.
CARL
...
Jeshush Shrist...
Jeshush
fuchem Shrist!
Excited, he counts out a bundle of bills and tosses it onto
the back seat.
He starts to take the rag away from his chin but the layer
pressed against his face sticks, its loose weave bound to
his skin by clotted blood.
He pulls very gently and winces as blood starts to flow
again.
He carefully tears the rag in half so that only a bit of it
remains adhering to his jaw.
It is pulled over to the side of an untraveled road.
THe
door opens and Carl emerges with the briefcase.
He slogs through the snow, down a gulley and up the
embankment to a barbed-wire fence.
He kneels at one of the
fence posts and frantically digs into the snow with his bare
hands, throws in the briefcase and covers it back up.
He stands and tries to beat the circulation back into his
red, frozen hands.
He looks to the right.
A regular line of identical fence posts stretches away
against unblemished white.
He looks to the left.
A regular line of identical fence posts stretches away
against unblemished white.
He looks at the fence post in front of him.
CARL
Mmmphh...
He looks about the snowy vastness for a marker.
Finding
none, he kicks the fence post a couple of times, failing to
scar or tilt it, then hurriedly plants a couple of sicks up
against the post.
He bends down, scoops up a handful of snow, presses it
against his wounded jaw, and lopes back to the idling car.
HOTEL ROOM
Marge has a packed overnight back sitting on the unmade bed.
She is ready to leave, already wearing her parka, but is on
the phone.
MARGE
No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back
up to Brainerd.
VOICE
Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
MARGE
Mm.
But ya think he's all right?
I saw him last night and he's -
VOICE
What'd he say?
MARGE
Well, it was nothin' specific
he said, it just seemd like it
all hit him really hard, his
wife dyin' -
VOICE
His wife?
MARGE
Linda.
VOICE
No.
MARGE
Linda Cooksey?
VOICE
No.
No.
No.
They weren't -
he, uh, he was bothering Linda
for about, oh, for a good year.
Really pestering her, wouldn't
leave her alone.
MARGE
So ... they didn't...
VOICE
No.
No.
They never married.
Mike's had psychiatric problems.
MARGE
Oh.
Oh, my.
VOICE
Yah, he - he's been struggling.
He's living with his parents now.
MARGE
Oh.
Geez.
VOICE
Yah, Linda's fine.
You should
call her.
MARGE
Geez.
Well - geez.
That's a
suprise.
MARGE'S CAR
Marge drives, gazing out at the road.
MARGE AT A DRIVE-THROUGH
She leans out of her open window and yells at the order
panel:
MARGE
Hello?
MARGE AT THE GUSTAFSON OLDS GARAGE
She sits in the lot, eating a breakfast sandwich.
JERRY LUNDEGAARD'S OFFICE
Jerry is at his desk using a blunt pencil to enter numbers
onto a form.
Beneath the form is a piece of carbon paper
and beneath that another form copy, which Jerry periodically
checks.
The carbon-copy form shows thick smudgy, illegible
entries.
Jerry hums nervously.
Glass rattles as someone taps at his door.
Jerry looks up and freezes, mouth hanging open, brow knit
with worry.
Marge sticks her head in the door.
MARGE
Mr. Lundegaard?
Sorry to bother
you again.
Can I come in?
She starts to enter.
JERRY
Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda
busy -
MARGE
I unnerstand.
I'll keep it real
short, then.
I'm on my way out
of town, but I was just -
Do you
mind if I sit down?
I'm carrying
a bit of a load here.
JERRY
No, I -
But she is already sitting into the chair opposite with a
sigh of relieved weight.
MARGE
Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you
about yesterday.
I was just
wondering -
JERRY
Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had
any vehicles go missing.
MARGE
Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean,
how do you know?
Because, see,
the crime I'm investigating, the
perpetrators were driving a car
with dealer plates.
And they
called someone who works here, so
it'd be quite a coincidence if
they weren't, ya know, connected.
JERRY
Yah, I see.
MARGE
So how do you - have you done any
kind of inventory recently?
JERRY
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.
MARGE
but do you know that for sure
without -
JERRY
Well, I would know.
I'm the
Executive Sales Manager.
MARGE
Yah, but -
JERRY
We run a pretty tight ship here.
MARGE
I know, but - well, how do you
establish that, sir?
Are the
cars, uh, counted daily or what
kind of -
JERRY
Ma'am, I answered your question.
There is a silent beat.
MARGE
...
I'm sorry, sir?
JERRY
Ma'am, I answered your question.
I answered the darn -
I'm
cooperating here, and I...
MARGE
Sir, you have no call to get
snippy with me.
I'm just doin'
my job here.
JERRY
I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here.
I'm cooperating...
There's no, uh
- we're doin' all we can...
He trails off into silence.
MARGE
Sir, could I talk to Mr. Gustafson?
Jerry stares at her.
MARGE
...
Mr. Lundegaard?
Jerry explodes:
JERRY
Well, heck, if you wanna, if you
wanna play games here!
I'm
workin' with ya on this thing, but
I...
He is getting angrily off his feet.
JERRY
Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!
MARGE
Sir?
Right now?
JERRY
Sure right now!
You're darned
tootin'!
He is yanking his parka from a hook behind the opened door
and grabbing a pair of galoshes.
JERRY
...
If it's so damned imporant
to ya!
MARGE
I'm sorry, sir, I -
Jerry has the parka slung over one arm and the galoshes
pinched in his hand.
JERRY
Aw, what the Christ!
He stamps out the door.
Marge stares.
After a long moment her stare breaks.
She glances idly
around the office.
There is a framed picture facing away from her on the
desktop.
She turns it to face her.
It is Scotty, holding
an accordion.
There is another picture of Jean.
Marge looks at it, looks around, for some reason, at the
ceiling.
She looks at a trophy shelf on the wall behind her.
She fiddles idly with a pencil.
She pulls a clipboard
toward her.
It holds a form from the General Motors Finance
Corporation.
She looks idly around.
Her look abruptly locks.
MARGE
...
Oh, for Pete's sake.
Jerry is easing his car around the near corner of the
building.
Marge's voice is flat with dismay:
MARGE
...
Oh, for Pete's sake...
She grabs the phone and punches in a number.
MARGE
...
For Pete's s- he's fleein' the
interview.
He's feelin' the
interview...
Jerry makes a left turn into traffic.
MARGE
...
Detective Sibert, please...
POLICE OFFICER
We are looking across a steam table at a man in blue.
He
moves slowly to the right, pushing his tray along a
cafeteria line.
Behind him, in the depth of the room, is an
eating area of long Formica tables at which sit a mix of
uniformed and civilian-clothed police and staff.
We are listening to an offscreen woman's voice.
WOMAN
Well, so far we're just saying he's
wanted for questioning in connection
with a triple homicide.
Nobody at
the dealship there's been much help
guessing where he might go...
The woman is entering frame sliding a tray.
Marge enters
behind her, sliding her own.
We move laterally with them as
they slowly make their way along the line.
MARGE
Uh-huh.
WOMAN
We called his house; his little
boy said he hadn't been there.
MARGE
And his wife?
WOMAN
She's visiting relatives in Florida.
Now his boss, this guy Gustafson,
he's also disappeared.
Nobody at
his office knows where he is.
MARGE
Geez.
Looks like this thing goes
higher than we thought.
You call
his home?
WOMAN
His wife's in the hospital, has
been for a couple months.
The big C.
MARGE
Oh, my.
WOMAN
And this Shep Proudfoot character,
he's a little darling.
He's now
wanted for assault and parole
violation.
He clobbered a neighbor
of his last night and another
person who could be one of your perps,
and he's at large.
MARGE
Boy, this thing is really ... geez.
WOMAN
Well, they're all out on the wire.
Well, you know...
MARGE
Yah.
Well, I just can't thank you
enough, Detective Sibert, this
cooperation has been outstanding.
DETECTIVE SIBERT
Ah, well, we haven't had to run
around like you.
When're you due?
MARGE
End a April.
DETECTIVE SIBERT
Any others?
MARGE
This'll be our first.
We've been
waiting a long time.
DETECTIVE SIBERT
That's wonderful.
Mm-mm.
It'll
change your life, a course.
MARGE
Oh, yah, I know that!
DETECTIVE SIBERT
They can really take over, that's
for sure.
MARGE
You have children?
Detective Sibert pulls an accordion of plastic picture
sleeves from her purse to show Marge.
DETECTIVE SIBERT
I thought you'd never ask.
The
older one is Janet, she's nine, and
the younger one is Morgan.
MARGE
Oh, now he's adorable.
DETECTIVE SIBERT
He's three now.
Course, not in that
picture.
MARGE
Oh, he's adorable.
DETECTIVE SIBERT
Yah, he -
MARGE
Where'd you get him that parka?
They have reached the end of the cafeteria line.
With a nod
to the cashier, Detective Sibert indicates hers and Marge's
trays.
DETECTIVE SIBERT
Both of these.
MARGE
Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
DETECTIVE SIBERT
Oh, don't be silly.
MARGE
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
DETECTIVE SIBERT
Oh, don't be silly.
GAEAR GRIMSRUD
He sits eating a Swanson's TV dinner from a TV tray he has
set up in front of an easy chair.
He watches the old black-and-white TV set whose image - it
might be a game show - is still heavily ghosting and
diffused by snow.
The audio crackles with interference.
Despite the impenetrability of its image, it holds
Grimsrud's complete attention.
At the sound of the front door opening, Grimsrud looks up.
Carl enters, his face suppurating and raw.
He reacts to Grimsrud's wordless look with a grotesque
laugh.
CARL
You should she zhe uzher guy!
He glances around.
CARL
...
The fuck happen a her?
Jean sits slumped in a straight-backed chair facing the
wall.
Her hooded head, resting on her chin, is motionless.
There is blood on the facing wall.
GRIMSRUD
She started shrieking, you know.
CARL
Jezhush.
He shakes his head.
CARL
...
Well, I gotta muddy.
He is plunking down eight bank-wrapped bundles on the table.
CARL
...
All of it.
All eighty gran.
Forty for you...
He makes one pile, pockets the rest.
CARL
...
Forty for me.
Sho thishuzh
it.
Adiosh.
He slaps keys down on the table.
CARL
...
You c'n'ave my truck.
I'm
takin' a Shiera.
GRIMSRUD
We split that.
Carl looks at him.
CARL
HOW THE FUCK DO WE SHPLITTA FUCKIN'
CAR?
Ya dummy!
Widda fuckin'
chainshaw?
Grimsrud looks sourly up.
There is a beat.
Finally:
GRIMSRUD
One of us pays the other for half.
CARL
HOLD ON!
NO FUCKIN' WAY!
YOU
FUCKIN' NOTISH ISH?
I GOT FUCKIN'
SHOT INNA FAISH!
I WENT'N GOTTA

I GET SHOT FUCKIN'
PICKIN' IT UP!
I BEEN UP FOR
THIRTY-SHIKSH FUCKIN' HOURZH!
I'M
TAKIN' THAT FUCKIN' CAR!
THAT
FUCKERZH MINE!
Carl waits for an argument, but only gets the steady sour
look.
Carl pulls out a gun.
CARL
...
YOU FUCKIN' ASH-HOLE!
I
LISHEN A YOUR BULLSHIT FOR A WHOLE
FUCKIN' WEEK!
A beat.
Carl returns Grimsrud's stare.
CARL
...
Are we shquare?
Grimsrud says nothing.
CARL
...
ARE WE SHQUARE?
A beat.
Disgusted, Carl pockets the gun and heads for the door.
CARL
...
Fuckin' ash-hole.
And if
you shee your friend Shep Proudpfut,
tell him I'm gonna NAIL hizh
fuckin' ash.
OUTSIDE
We are pulling Carl as he walks toward the car.
Behind him
we see the cabin door opening.
Carl turns, reacting to the
sound.
Grimsrud is bounding out wearing mittens and a red hunter's
cap, but no overcoat.
He is holding an ax.
Carl fumbles in his pocket for his gun.
Grimsrud swings overhand, burying the ax in Carl's neck.
MARGE
In her cruiser, on her two-way.
Through it we hear Lou's
voice, heavily filtered:
VOICE
His wife.
This guy says she was
kidnapped last Wednesday.
MARGE
The day of our homicides.
VOICE
Yah.
Marge is peering to one side as she drives, looking through
the bare trees that border the road on a declivity that runs
down to a large frozen lake.
MARGE
And this guy is...
VOICE
Lundegaard's father-in-law's
accountant.
MARGE
Gustafson's accountant.
VOICE
Yah.
MARGE
But we still haven't found Gustafson.
VOICE
(crackle)
-
looking.
MARGE
Sorry - didn't copy.
VOICE
Still missing.
We're looking.
MARGE
Copy.
And Lundegaard too.
VOICE
Yah.
Where are ya, Margie?
We hear, distant but growing louder, harsh engine noise, as
of a chainsaw or lawnmower.
MARGE
Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving
around Moose Lake.
VOICE
Oh.
Gary's loudmouth.
MARGE
Yah, the loudmouth.
So the whole
state has it, Lundegaard and
Gustafson?
VOICE
Yah, it's over the wire, it's
everywhere, they'll find 'em.
MARGE
Copy.
VOICE
We've got a -
MARGE
There's the car!
There's the car!
We are slowing as we approach a short driveway leading down
to a cabin.
Parked in front is the brown Cutlass Ciera.
VOICE
Whose car?
MARGE
My car!
My car!
Tan Ciera!
VOICE
Don't go in!
Wait for back-up!
Marge is straining to look.
The power-tool noise is louder
here but still muffled, its source not yet visible.
VOICE
...
Chief Gunderson?
MARGE
Copy.
Yah, send me back-up!
VOICE
Yes, ma'am.
Are we the closest PD?
MARGE
Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich
and he takes February off to go to
Boundary Waters.
ROAD EXTERIOR
Marge pulls her prowler over some distance past the cabin.
She gets out, zips up her khaki parka and pulls up its fur-
lined hood.
For a moment, she stands listening to the muffled roar of
the power tool.
Then, with one curved arm half pressing
against, half supporting her belly, she takes slow, gingerly
steps down the slope, through the deep snow, through the
trees angling toward the cabin and the source of the
grinding noise.
She slogs from tree to tree, letting each one support her
downhill-leaning weight for a moment before slogging to the
next.
The roar grows louder.
Marge stands panting by one tree,
her breath vaporizing out of her snorkel hood.
She squints
down toward the cabin's back lot.
A tall man with his back to us, wearing a red plaid quilted
jacket and a hunting cap with earflaps, is laboring over a
large power tool which his body blocks from view.
Marge advances.
The man is forcing downward something which engages the
roaring power tool and makes harsh spluttering noises.
The man is Grimsrud, his nose red and eyes watering from the
cold, hatflaps pulled down over his ears.
His breath steams
as he sourly goes about his work, both hands pressing down a
shod foot, as it if were the shaft of a butter churn.
The roar is very loud.
Marge slogs down to the next tree, panting, looking.
Grimsrud forces more of the leg into the machine, which we
can now see sprays small wet chunks out the bottom.
Marge's eyes shift.
A large dark form lies in the snow next to Grimsrud.
Grimsrud works on, eyes watering.
With a grunt he bends
down out of frame and then re-enters holding a thick log.
He uses it to force the leg deeper into the machine.
Marge is advancing.
She holds a gun extended toward
Grimsrud, who is still turned away.
Grimsrud rubs his nose with the back of his hand.
Marge closes in, grimacing.
Grimsrud's back strains as he puts his weight into the log
that pushes down into the machine.
The dark shape in the snow next to his side is the rest of
Carl Showalter's body.
Marge has drawn to within twenty yards.
When she bellows it
sounds hollow and distant, her voice all but eaten up by the
roar of the power tool.
MARGE
Stop!
Police!
Turn around and
hands up!
Startled, Grimsrud scowls.
He turns to face her.
He stares.
Marge bellows again:
MARGE
...
Hands up!
Conscious of the noise, she shows with a twist of her
shoulder the armpatch insignia.
MARGE
...
Police!
Grimsrud stares.
With a quick twist, he reaches back for the log, hurls it at
Marge and then starts running away.
Marge twists her body sideways, shielding herself.
No need - the heavy log travels perhaps ten yards and lands
in the snow several feet short of her.
Grimsrud pants up the hill - slow going through the deep
snow.
Behind him:
MARGE
...
Halt!
She fires in the air.
She lowers the gun and carefully sighs.
MARGE
...
Halt!
She fires.
Grimsrud still slogs up the hill - a miss.
Marge sights again.
MARGE
...
Halt!
She fires again.
Grimsrud pitches forward.
He mutters in Swedish as he
reaches down to clutch at his wounded leg.
Marge walks toward him, gun trained on him as her other hand
reaches under her parka and gropes around her waist.
It comes out with a pair of handcuffs, which she opens with
a snap of the wrist.
MARGE
...
All right, buddy.
On your
belly and your hands clasped
behind you.
THE CRUISER
Marge drives.
Grimsrud sits in the back seat, hands cuffed
behind him.
For a long moment there, he is quiet - only engine hum and
the periodic clomp of wheels on pavement seams - as Marge
grimly shakes her head.
MARGE
...
So that was Mrs. Lundegaard
in there?
She glances up in the rear-view mirror.
Grimsrud, cheeks sunk, eyes hollow, looks sourly out at the
road.
Marge shakes her head.
At length:
MARGE
...
I guess that was your
accomplice in the wood chipper.
Grimsrud's head bobs with bumps on the road; otherwise he is
motionless, reactionless, scowling and gazing out.
MARGE
...
And those three people in
Brainerd.
No response.
Marge, gazing forward, seems to be talking to herself.
MARGE
...
And for what?
For a little
bit of money.
We hear distant sirens.
MARGE
...
There's more to life than money,
you know.
She glances up in the rear-view mirror.
MARGE
...
Don't you know that?...
And
here ya are, and it's a beautiful
day...
Grimsrud's hollow eyes stare out.
The sirens are getting louder.
Marge pulls over.
MARGE
...
Well...
She leans forward to the dash to give two short signalling
WHOOPS on her siren.
She turns on her flashers.
She leans back with a creak and jangle of utilities.
She stares forward, shakes her head.
We hear the dull click
of her flashers.
MARGE
...
I just don't unnerstand it.
Outside it is snowing.
The sky, the earth, the road - all
white.
A squad car, gumballs spinning, punches through the white.
It approaches in slow motion.
An ambulance punches through after it.
Another squad car.
FADE OUT:
FADE IN:
HIGH AND WIDE ON A SHABBY MOTEL
It stands next to a highway on a snowy, windslept plain.
One or two cars dot the parking lot along with an idling
police cruiser.
MOTEL ROOM DOORWAY
We are looking over the shoulders of two uniformed policemen
who stand on either side of the door, their hands resting
lightly on their holstered sidearms.
One of them raps at
the door.
COP ONE
Mr. Anderson...
A title fades in:
OUTSIDE OF BISMARK, NORTH DAKOTA
After a pause, muffled through the door:
VOICE
...
Who?...
COP ONE
Mr. Anderson, is this your burgundy
88 out here?
VOICE
...
Just a sec.
COP ONE
Could you open the door, please?
VOICE
...
Yah.
Yah, just a sec.
We hear a clatter from inside.
VOICE
...
Just a sec...
One of the policemen unholsters his gun and nods to someone
whose back enters - a superintendent holding a ring of keys.
This man turns a key in the door and then stands away.
The two policemen, guns at the ready, bang into the motel
room.
The rough hand-held camera rushes in behind them as the two
men give the room a two-handed sweep with their guns.
The room is empty.
Cop one indicates the open bathroom door.
COP ONE
Dale!
The two men charge the bathroom, belts jingling, guns at the
ready, jittery camera behind them rushing to keep pace.
A man in boxer shorts is halfway out the bathroom window.
The policemen holster their guns and charge the window, and
drag Jerry Lundegaard back into the room.
His flesh quivers as he thrashes and keens in short,
piercing screams.
The cops wrestle him to the floor but his palsied thrashing
continues.
The policemen struggle to restrain him.
COP ONE
Call an ambulance!
COP TWO
You got him okay?
Cop One pinions Jerry's arms to the floor and Jerry bursts
into uncontrolled sobbing.
COP ONE
Yah, yah, call an ambulance.
Jerry sobs and screams.
A BEDROOM
We are square on Norm, who sits in bed watching television.
After a long beat, Marge enters frame in a nightie and
climbs into bed, with some effort.
MARGE
Oooph!
Norm reaches for her hand as both watch the television.
At length Norm speaks, but keeps his eyes on the TV.
NORM
They announced it.
Marge looks at him.
MARGE
They announced it?
NORM
Yah.
Marge looks at him, waiting for more, but Norm's eyes stay
fixed on the television.
MARGE
...
So?
NORM
Three-cent stamp.
MARGE
Your mallard?
NORM
Yah.
MARGE
Norm, that's terrific!
Norm tries to suppress a smile of pleasure.
NORM
It's just the three cent.
MARGE
It's terrific!
NORM
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the
twenty-nine cent.
People don't
much use the three-cent.
MARGE
Oh, for Pete's - a course they do!
Every time they raise the darned
postage, people need the little
stamps!
NORM
Yah.
MARGE
When they're stuck with a bunch a
the old ones!
NORM
Yah, I guess.
MARGE
That's terrific.
Her eyes go back to the TV.
MARGE
...
I'm so proud a you, Norm.
Norm murmurs:
NORM
I love you, Margie.
MARGE
I love you, Norm.
Both of them are watching the TV as Norm reaches out to rest
a hand on top of her stomach.
NORM
...
Two more months.
Marge absently rests her own hand on top of his.
MARGE
Two more months.
Hold; fade out.
