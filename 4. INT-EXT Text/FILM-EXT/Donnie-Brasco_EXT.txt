NICKY

SONNY

Judy gives Lefty a kiss. He blushes.
LEFTY

Sonny looks at the stern. Emblazoned across it:
"THE LEFT HAND"
SONNY
That's some fucking irony, ain't

LEFTY
That's hand-built in Taiwan, that
boat.
BOOBIE
What is that, half a million?

Hey, Left.
Donnie nods toward the parking lot. Lefty looks, sees a LINCOLN TOWN
CAR pull up.
LEFTY
That's him. That's Trafficante.
Lefty jogs up the dock as STEVE DISALVO, 40s, Trafficante's ENFORCER,
emerges from the Lincoln.
DISALVO
You Lefty?
LEFTY
Nice to meet you, Mr.
Trafficante.
DISALVO
This's Mr. Trafficante.
Lefty turns as SANTO TRAFFICANTE, 70s, a feeble old man with a pork
pie hat, is helped from the car by his entourage of FLORIDA WISEGUYS.
He and Lefty shake hands.
LEFTY
That's the boat I arranged for
you, Mr. T raffi cante . We got a

I'm gonna propose you. You know

BOOBIE
He knows a lot of broads, Donnie.
LEFTY
If Donnie had a dollar for every
broad of all his broads, he could
buy the fucking boat himself.
BOOBIE
If Donnie's got so many broads,
how come we never seen none of
them?
LEFTY
He uses them broads like Kleenex.
He won't spend a dollar to take
a lady out.
Boobie drinks, takes a beat.
