      The CREWMEN atop the deck react to the FIRE erupting along 
      the coast.  They shout to each other in MANDARIN.

                                  MAN S VOICE (V.O.)
                    I ve never read anything like it.  
                    Except in 19th century literature.


      A SMALL SKIFF rests on the beach.  THE FISHING TRAWLER moored 
      offshore.  The ship s CAPTAIN and First Mate -- both Chinese  
      -- cautiously approach the WALL OF FLAME...

                                  MAN S VOICE (V.O.)
                    The last thing anyone expects to 
                    find on a deserted island...

      A RUSTLING from the woods nearby.  The Captain pulling out A 
      GAFFE.  A precaution.  Eyes going wide to see --

                                  MAN S VOICE (V.O.)
                    ...is that it s not deserted.                                                                                            2.


      ...A PAIR OF BARE FEET emerge from the woods.  All bruises 
      and scars.  PAN UP as the FIGURE lowers his hood REVEALING... 
      a BEARDED YOUNG MAN. 27 years old.  Sun-bleached hair. Gaunt.  

      This is what is left of OLIVER QUEEN. 


      As Oliver boards the fishing boat from the skiff, he looks 
      back one last time at his home for the last five years.  

                                  MAN S VOICE (V.O.)
                    The island he was found 
                    on is called  Lian Yu.   It s 
                      Mandarin... for  Purgatory.    

      We see the ISLAND fully for the first time.  Black and 
      silent, far from anywhere and everywhere.  It feels wrong.  

                                  MAN S VOICE (V.O.)
                    I can t tell you why he s alive...
                    Because for five years... that 
                    island did its best to kill him.

      Off Oliver, staring at the island.  A solemn good-bye to 
      what s been his home for the past five years...

                                                                    MATCH CUT TO:


      The LIMO pulls up to A MASSIVE STONE MANSION surrounded by 
      vast grounds.  Old money.  American royalty.


      Oliver looks up at his house.  As if seeing it for the first 
      time.  The driver POPS the trunk, is about to reach inside --

      -- when Oliver SPINS and blocks him.  A quick move.  

                                  OLIVER
                    I ve got it.

      Oliver bends to remove AN ARMY MUNITIONS TRUNK.  Weathered.  
      Marked with Chinese letters.  He holds it tight.  As if his 
      life literally depended on it.  


      BLACK WATER laps against the hull of the Queen s Gambit.  
      DARKENING CLOUDS billow overhead.  THUNDER in the distance.                                                                                            11.



      A younger Oliver emerges from the lower deck.  Shirtless.  
      Carefree.  The roiling clouds above can t dampen his mood.  
      He walks across the deck to where -- 

      His father, ROBERT QUEEN, confers with HACKETT (40, grizzled, 
      hard), Robert s head of security --

                                    HACKETT
                    Storm s a category two.  Captain s 
                      recommending we head back.

                                  ROBERT
                    Is it really that serious?

                                    HACKETT
                    When even the captain looks 
                    seasick, I take that as a bad sign. 

                                  ROBERT
                          (disappointed)
                    Not even two days out...
                          ( oh well )
                    Alright.  Back to Bahrain.  You ll 
                    inform the crew?

      Hackett dutifully nods, crossing paths with Oliver --

                                  OLIVER
                    We in trouble?

                                  ROBERT 
                    One of us is.

      He does not mean the storm.  

                                  OLIVER
                    Yeah.  She and I... just kind of 
                      happened...

                                  ROBERT
                    Things don t happen to us, Oliver.  
                    They happen because of us.  I wish 
                    that would settle in.   

      Oliver s heard that nugget before.  Ad nauseum.

                                  OLIVER
                    If I wanted a lecture I d be back 
                    at Stanford. Or Berkeley. Or Reed.

      From below deck, we hear a girl s voice:                                                                                              12.


                                  GIRL S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Oliver!  Where do you keep the 
                    bottle opener on this thing?!

                                  OLIVER
                          (calling down)
                    I ll show you.  One sec.

      Oliver starts toward the hatch --

                                  ROBERT
                    You know that won t finish well.  
                    For either of them.  Or you.

      Oliver shrugs.   What can you do?   And heads below.  Off 
      Robert, hearing Oliver and the woman s LAUGHTER ECHO... 


      MOVE ACROSS the well-manicured lawn and into the woods 
      behind.  Underneath the thick foliage is... OLIVER curled up 
      on the ground, sleeping like a man who s lived in the wild 
      for five years.  He s restless.  LIGHTNING FLASHES overhead.  

                                  GIRL S VOICE (PRELAP)
                    One... two... 

      The DISTANT ROAR of THUNDER takes us back to --  


      LIGHTNING CRACKLES and Oliver wakes with a start.  Moira is 
      now standing over him.  Terrified.  His hand SHOOTS OUT -- on 
      instinct -- GRABBING her by the throat --  

                                  MOIRA
                    OLIVER!

      His eyes snap wide, releasing her quickly.  Horrified to 
      discover what he was doing.  

                                  OLIVER
                    I m... so sorry.  

      Moira studies him with shock and confusion.  Oliver s eyes 
      well with pain if not tears --

                                  OLIVER
                    What happened there -- it was 
                    horrible.

                                  MOIRA
                    I know, son.  You re home now.
                          (then)
                    Please, come inside, sweetheart.

      Oliver nods.  Allows her to help him to his feet.  We watch 
      as Moira tenderly moves with her son back inside, the RAIN 
      CONTINUES TO FALL... 


                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                            18.


                                            ACT TWO


      The storm now replaced by a resplendent morning.  Moira and 
      Walter look on as a LAWYER takes Oliver through a stack of 
      papers.  But Oliver s far more fascinated with the lawyer s 
      iPhone.  He examines it -- amazed -- it s like magic, as --

                                  LAWYER
                      Death-in-absentia usually occurs 
                      automatically after seven years.  
                    However, in cases of imminent peril 
                    -- a boating accident, for example-- 
                    the court will grant a petitioner s 
                    request to declare the missing 
                    person deceased sooner. 
                          (an awkward beat)
                    We ll... delve into the quagmire of 
                    ownership position in light of your 
                      disappearance at a later date.

                                  WALTER
                    Oliver, I hope you understand, in 
                    light of you and your father s... 
                    absence, it was necessary to bring 
                    the company under the control of 
                    the board.

      Oliver says nothing.  Fixated on the iPhone.  The lawyer 
      points and Oliver puts the phone aside to sign.

                                  LAWYER
                      Congratulations.  You re alive.  
                    Again.

      The lawyer briefcases the documents and exits.  Moira flashes 
      a look at Walter.  She got her way.  She usually does.  


      Tommy s SLR McLaren cruises through the fog-shrouded streets.  
      A tourism BILLBOARD reads:   Starling City is a STAR City...  

                                  TOMMY (PRELAP)
                    Your funeral blew.


      A chasm of silence -- awkwardness -- between them.  

                                  OLIVER
                    You went to law school.  Just like 
                    you said you would.                                                                                            23.


                                  LAUREL
                    Yes.  Everyone s proud.  

                                  OLIVER
                    Adam Hunt.  Are you sure you want 
                    to mess with him?  

                                  LAUREL
                    Why are you here?  

                                  OLIVER
                    To apologize.  To tell you it was 
                    my fault.  To ask you, please, 
                    don t blame her --

                                  LAUREL
                    For what?  Being 18?  Falling under 
                    your spell?  How could I possibly 
                    blame her for doing the same things 
                    I did?   

                                  OLIVER
                    Laurel, I --

                                  LAUREL
                    She was my sister!  I couldn t be 
                    angry at her because she was dead.  
                    And I couldn t grieve because I was 
                    so angry at her.  That s what 
                    happens when your sister dies while 
                    screwing your boyfriend.  
                          (beat)
                    We buried an empty coffin.  Because 
                    her body is at the bottom of the 
                    ocean.  Where you left her.  

      The words sting Oliver.  Only because they re true.  Pained --

                                  OLIVER
                    I know it s too late to say it... 
                    But I am sorry.

                                  LAUREL
                    I m sorry too.  I had hoped you 
                    would rot in hell for a whole lot 
                    longer than five years.

      A dagger in his heart.  Laurel turns to go back inside, 
      passing Tommy standing just outside the doorway.

                                  LAUREL
                    How did you think this was going to 
                    go, Tommy?                                                                                            24.


                                  TOMMY
                    About like that.

      She heads back in.  Oliver watching her go.  Dying inside.


      The Mercedes SPINS OUT coming to a stop -- the van screeching 
      to a halt -- blocking the Mercedes  path.  Then -- everything 
      happening almost too fast to process -- the van door sliding 
      open -- TWO MEN in GROTESQUE MASKS spilling out -- silenced 
        semi-automatics -- body armor -- moving with military 
      precision -- OPENING the doors of Tommy s car -- the crumpled 
      metal -- army boots crushing shattered glass --

      A HOOD over Tommy s head -- quick -- a chokehold, as -- A 
      BYSTANDER gets out of his car -- rushing toward the scene to 
      intervene -- to help --

      -- when a THIRD MASKED MAN leans out of the van wielding a 
      MACHINE GUN.  A TORRENT of GUNFIRE SLAMS the bystander to the 
      pavement.

      OLIVER sees the samaritan drop -- surging towards him -- a 
      YOUNG BOY -- the samaritan s son -- doing the same --

                                  BOY
                    DAD!

      The boy rushes to his father.  Tears streaming down his 
      cheeks.

      Oliver is transfixed by this heartbreaking scene, as -- a 
      hood comes down over his head.  Enclosing him in BLACKNESS.  

                                  OLIVER (PRELAP)
                    SARA!                                                                                            25.



      Oliver floats by himself in dark frigid waters.  

                                  OLIVER
                    SARA!

      He DIVES below the surface.  Beat.  Then re-emerges.  Alone.  

                                  OLIVER
                    SARA!

      Desperation grows.  Oliver taking in a lungful of air, about 
      to go below again -- when a hand grabs him.  Oliver wheeling 
      around to see --

                                  ROBERT
                    Oliver!

                                  OLIVER
                    She s down there--!

                        ROBERTOLIVER
      No, Oliver, she s not --I ve got to --

      Oliver struggles -- Robert gripping him -- first to restrain, 
      then to EMBRACE --

                                  ROBERT
                    She s gone!  It s been twenty 
                    minutes in freezing water.  
                          (softer)
                    She s gone, Oliver.

      Oliver sags in his father s arms.  Surrendering.  A whisper --

                                  OLIVER
                    Please God...  No.  It s all my 
                    fault.  It s my fault.

      Oliver fights tears, as Robert tows him towards --


      Hackett, the security chief, reaches to drag them both 
      aboard.  Freezing, devastated, Oliver lies there shivering in 
      his father s arms.  

      Off the three men, floating atop the endless black sea...

                                  MASK (PRELAP)
                    Mr. Queen...?                                                                                            26.


      SNAP IN.  The hood YANKED off Oliver s head.  Oliver shaking 
      his head to get his bearings to see he s --


      Diggle jerks the limo to a stop, bolting out.  Scans the 
      street.  No sign of Oliver.


      TIGHT ON SEVERAL BOTTLES OF WATER AND A FEW MREs.  PULL OUT 
      TO REVEAL Oliver, Robert and Hackett atop the lifeboat, 
      checking their meager rations --

                                  ROBERT
                    A few days.  Maybe.
                          (to Hackett)
                    Best guess?

                                    HACKETT
                    With the current, maybe a week from 
                    the Paracel Islands.  

      Oliver moves to the side of the raft.  Robert follows.    

                                  ROBERT
                    We re going to get through this, 
                    Oliver.

                                  OLIVER
                    Really?   Cause the no food and no 
                    landfall for a week say otherwise.

                                  ROBERT
                    We ll make it.  We have to.  
                          (then)
                    I thought I d have more time.

                                  OLIVER
                    For what?  

      He studies his son.  Then, hinting at a larger mystery:

                                  ROBERT
                    I started with nothing, Oliver.  
                    But the more I earned, the more I 
                    paid.  I paid with my soul.  Queen 
                      Consolidated s success was built on 
                    the pain and suffering of many.  
                    Pain and suffering I caused.  
                          (beat)
                    I failed our city.                                                                                            37.


                                  OLIVER
                    Dad, don t say that.  You re... 
                    you re a good man.

                                  ROBERT
                    You don t know me.  Not really.  
                    You don t know the truth.

      Off father and son, the endless sea all around them...

                                  TOMMY (PRELAP)
                    He s not who I thought he was.  


      Oliver s limo pulls up outside the converted factory space.  
      PAPARAZZI snap photos of the guests.  Oliver alights --
      pausing for the cameras -- and makes his way inside. 


      Oliver and Laurel.  Hunt s building in the distance.

                                  LAUREL
                    I m sorry... about saying I wished 
                    you were dead.  That was wrong.

                                  OLIVER
                    I d be happy to be, if it meant me 
                    instead of her.

      Laurel sees it in his eyes.  He s sincere.

                                  LAUREL
                    About Sara...  There s something...   
                    I m afraid to ask... but I need to 
                    know.  When she died... did she 
                    suffer? 

      FLASH CUT:  Sara in the sinking yacht.  Screaming in terror.

                                  OLIVER
                          (lying)
                    No.  

                                  LAUREL
                    I think about her every day.

                                  OLIVER
                    Me too.  

                                  LAUREL
                    I guess we still have one thing in 
                    common then.

      BEEP!  Oliver checks the iPhone.  The timer reads, 00:00.  
      Hunt s time is up. Oliver swipes the screen, switching apps -- 

      ON THE SCREEN:  ACCOUNT 52... BALANCE... $0.00.                                                                                              47.


      Oliver frowns.  Hunt isn t playing ball.

                                  LAUREL
                    Something wrong?

                                  OLIVER
                    Just... someone who owed me some 
                    money.  Didn t pay.

      He looks up at her.  They share a brief and intense look -- 
      it s evident they re still very much in love.

                                  LAUREL
                    I can t believe I m saying this...  
                    But if you ever really want to talk 
                    to someone -- about what happened -- 
                    I m sure it wasn t easy for you, 
                    and if you wanted I could try to...

      Oliver s heart breaks knowing what he has to do next -- 

                                  OLIVER
                    Laurel, you always saw the best in 
                    me.  Even right now, you re looking 
                    for it, hoping that island changed 
                    me somehow, made me a better 
                    person.  It didn t.  Stay away from 
                    me.  I ll just hurt you all over 
                    again.  Only worse.   
                          (back to the party)
                    You should go.  I ve got five years 
                    of debauchery to catch up on. 

      She studies him.  Sad.  Disgusted.  

                                  LAUREL
                    You re wrong, Ollie.  That island 
                    did change you.  At least now 
                    you re honest.

      She heads back inside.  Oliver feels like he swallowed broken 
      glass, but... to business.  He moves into --


      The towering building looms.  Hired muscle -- business suits 
      and machine guns -- visible through the windows.  Patrolling.

      Suddenly... SHUNK.  An ARROW embeds itself on the rooftop.  A 
      CABLE trails from it -- stretching across the wide expanse -- 
      back to the Iron Works Building, as --


      ...but inaudible at street level.  DROWNED OUT by the lights 
      and TECHNO THUMP of the party across the street.  The COPS 
      standing guard outside Hunt s building don t hear a thing.                                                                                            49.



      The policemen spin around -- looking up -- as the WINDOWS 
      BLOW OUT!  Reacting --

                                  POLICEMAN
                    All units.  Converge.  Converge. 


      CLOSE ON THE RATIONS BOX.  No more MREs.  Only one bottle of 
      water left.  Only three-quarters full.  WIDEN TO REVEAL:

      Oliver, Robert and Hackett.  Frail and weakened by lack of 
      food and water.  Floating in the endless sea.  

                                  ROBERT
                    Oliver...

                                  OLIVER
                    Don t talk, Dad.  Save your 
                    strength.

                                  ROBERT
                    I am.  You re my strength.  And I m 
                    saving you.    

      Wanting privacy from Hackett, Robert moves close to Oliver.  

                                  ROBERT
                    We re not going to last.  The three 
                    of us.  But you can.  You can 
                    survive.   
                          (then)
                    Make it back to Starling.  I ruined 
                    our city.  You can save it.   

      Oliver looks at his father.  Has he lost his mind?  

                                  OLIVER
                    Just rest, Dad --

                                  ROBERT
                    This is my penance.  This is what I 
                    deserve.  But you...

      Robert touches Oliver s face.  Tender.  Emotional.

                                  ROBERT
                    ...you re my absolution.

      ANGLE ON:  HACKETT.  He s been listening.  Doesn t like where 
      this is going.  He reaches behind his back and pulls out a 
      LONG KNIFE when -- 

      BANG!  Hackett is blown off the lifeboat, dead before he hits 
      the water.  REVEAL ROBERT is HOLDING A SMOKING GUN.  Oliver 
      cannot believe what he just saw.                                                                                              51.


                                  OLIVER
                    Dad!

                                  ROBERT
                    I love you, son.  Survive.

      Robert puts the gun to his head.  Oliver goes to stop him -- 
      but for the very last time in his life -- he s too slow. 

                                  OLIVER
                    No!!

      A SECOND GUNSHOT.  Oliver cries out.  His innocence shattered 
      forever.  He grabs onto his father s lifeless body, hugging 
      it close.  Off Oliver s tearful eyes WE DISSOLVE TO: OLIVER S 
      EYES in the present-- as they flutter open in...


      WORKERS hang TARPS over the broken windows.  Hunt storms 
      about the ruins of his home, barking at an UNDERLING --   

                                  HUNT
                    I want the entire security system 
                      overhauled.  Card keys.  Motion 
                      detectors.  Everything military 
                    grade.  No one gets in here again.    

      Hunt spies an ARROW sticking out of his wall.  

                                  HUNT (CONT D)
                    Ever.  

                                  UNDERLING
                    Sir, your accountant is holding on 
                    line one...

      Hunt goes to his desk, picks up his phone --

                                  HUNT
                          (into phone)
                    What is it, Ron?                                                                                              55.


      Whatever Ron says, Hunt s face goes ashen --   

                                  HUNT
                    What the hell are you talking 
                    about??!  Forty million dollars 
                    doesn t just up and vanish! 
                          (then)
                       Untraceable?   IT S FORTY MILLION 
                    DOLLARS!  FIND IT!

      Hunt stops.  Sees the SMALL RED DEVICE the Arrow was holding 
      during the shoot out.  It is attached to his computer.  Shit.

                                  HUNT
                          (realizing)
                    It was a goddamn set up...

      Hunt slumps in his chair.  Broke.  And broken.


      THE ARROW stands atop the adjoining roof, looking down on 
      Laurel and Detective Lance.  Watching.

                                  DETECTIVE LANCE (O.S.)
                          (recalling Laurel earlier)
                    ...we don t need to go outside the 
                    law to find justice.  I believe 
                    that.  And by the time I m done, 
                    this guy ll believe it too.  


      A LONE CAR is parked in the dimly lit lot.  Behind the wheel 
      sits a GRIZZLED MAN (45, reptilian, cold).                                                                                              60.


      After a moment, SOMEONE GETS IN THE BACKSEAT.  The GRIZZLED 
      MAN speaks but we don t see to who --

                                  GRIZZLED MAN
                    The police failed to identify the 
                    men I hired to kidnap Oliver.  And 
                    they never will.  

                                    A VOICE (O.S.)
                    Good.

                                  GRIZZLED MAN
                    Should we arrange another 
                      abduction?   

                                    A VOICE (O.S.)
                    No.

      REVEAL the person in the backseat... IS MOIRA QUEEN.  She was 
      the one that had Oliver kidnapped.  She shakes her head --

                                  MOIRA
                    There are other ways of finding out 
                    what my son knows.  

      With that, she gets out of the back and walks away.  Off this 
      shocking development, we go back to...


      The Arrow lowers his hood, revealing Oliver s face.  We try 
      to read his expression, but we can t.  So much of Oliver, so 
      much of his story, is still a mystery to us.  We wonder now 
      more than ever what exactly happened to him on that island.    

      Oliver surveys the city as an evening MIST settles in.  WE 
      MATCH CUT TO: ANOTHER MIST FIVE YEARS AGO...


      Oliver s lifeboat floats through the mist of the China seas.  
      Oliver s in it, looking lifeless.  After a moment, Oliver 
      HEARS something... the SOUND OF SEAGULLS.  Land is near.  

      He struggles to lift his head... his eyes searching the 
      horizon.  As the mist parts, he sees something in the 
      distance.  He rubs his eyes.  Convinced he s hallucinating, 
      he squints again.  And then we see it, too:

      AN ISLAND.
                                                                  SNAP TO BLACK.


                                    END OF PILOT
