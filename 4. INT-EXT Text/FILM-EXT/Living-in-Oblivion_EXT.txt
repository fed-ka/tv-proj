A quiet, deserted industrial street. It is over an hour before
dawn and the street is still cloaked in the heavy stillness
of night.
In the weak light filtering out of their battered van, BERT
and CYBIL -- the Craft Service Managers, finish setting out
breakfast supplies on a 6' table. They work in almost complete
silence, both nearly paralyzed with sleep. A cheap walkie-
talkie, lying beside a paper plate of soggy Oreos, sputters
and buzzes occasionally. Other items on the table include a
mangled banana, seven grapes, and a box of chocolate covered
donuts.
BERT
What time is it?
CYBIL
Four. Why?
BERT
This milk is bad.
CYBIL
(sniffs)
When did you buy it?
BERT
Tuesday? I don't know. What's today?
CYBIL
Monday.
(pause)
There's a deli on Broadway.
BERT
Nothing closer?
CYBIL
Nothing that's open.
BERT
(sniffs the milk)
Is it that bad?
CYBIL
I don't know. You're the one who
said it was bad.
At that moment a large truck grinds around the corner and
shudders to a stop in front of the building. Bert replaces
the carton of milk neatly beside the orange juice.
Amid low, one-word greetings, the CREW tumbles out of the
trucks and stands in a groggy cluster around the Craft Service
table. WOLF -- the Cameraman, assumes a place of prominence.
He wears a black leather coat, a black beret, and black
leather half-fingered gloves.
WOLF
This is the worst fucking coffee
I've had in my life.
CYBIL
Then don't drink it.
GAFFER
What're we doing today?
WOLF
(pulls out a wrinkled
callsheet)
"Interior. Living Room. Ellen talks
to Mom."
AC
Any nudity?
CYBIL
Yeah, you have to take your fucking
pants off.
AC
I'll do it. I like Ellen.
GAFFER
Yeah, she's a babe. She was the nurse
in that Richard Gere movie.
BERT
I worked on that.
AC
The shower scene.
WOLF
Start with the 5K in the window. Run
feeders for three blonds into the
living room.
GAFFER
Two people. Sitting? Standing?
WOLF
Who fuckin' knows?
GAFFER
(walks off)
"Ellen talks to Mom."
CU sidewalk. A pair of women's orthopedic shoes enter the
frame and begin pacing.
Camera pans up to reveal CORA, a small woman in her early
60s, pacing beneath the awning of her residential hotel. She
appears to be rehearsing dialogue with herself.
CORA
Ellen, I have no memory of this
whatsoever. Ellen... Ellen I have NO
memory of this whatsoever.
Jeff pulls the car up to the curb and Cora gets into the
back seat.
The Gaffer and AC help the still-groggy Palomino into the
back of the production van. JEFF, the driver, watches them
in sleepy curiosity.
With Palomino safely propped in a seat, the AC goes back to
the set. The Gaffer waits a moment then slips his script out
of his back pocket and slaps it into Palomino's motionless
hand.
GAFFER
It's called "Tsunami." A Japanese
tidal wave hits New York. You've an
ex-Navy S.E.A L. frogman, working
undercover. You save the city. You'd
be perfect for the lead. That's my
number; call me, or I'll call you.
Either way it's been great working
with you, man.
As Palomino stares at him blankly, the Gaffer slams the door.
The car pulls out.
Nicole stands with her back to the camera as Nick strides up
to her with impatience.
NICK
Alright, Nicole. What's the matter?
NICOLE
You tell me! You're the one with the
bug up your ass!
NICK
Now wait just a second!
NICOLE
You've been picking on me all day! I
can't do anything right!
NICK
I'm sorry if I was short with you,
Nicole, but I think you can see I'm
under a little pressure here. I'm
shooting a Dream Sequence without a
smoke machine, my mother's out there
thinking she's at a circus wedding
and you tell me the whole movie seems
fake!
NICOLE
I never said that!
NICK
You did too. You said, "Everything
feels fake."
NICOLE
I meant me! I feel fake! Everything
I'm doing feels fake. I can't act. I
should just do shower scenes in
Richard Gere movies for the rest of
my life!
NICK
Nicole, that's ridiculous. You're a
fantastic actress. All you have to
do is show me you want that apple
more than anything else in the world;
don't give up. Understand? You cannot
give up.
NICOLE
OK.
Suddenly Wanda yells out.
WANDA
Ready, Nick?!
NICK
Ready!
