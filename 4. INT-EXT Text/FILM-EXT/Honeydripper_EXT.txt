We follow a small boy's FINGERS on a strange contraption-
WIDER
SCRATCH, 10 years old, has a `DIDDLEY BOW', a piece of baling
wire nailed to the side of the unpainted shack so it is
stretched taut. He moves an old corn cob under it as a fret
and makes TWANGY, pitch-shifting NOTES as he plucks the wire.
His friend LONNIE stands moving his fingers over a BOARD he
has laid on the side of the porch floor. A few scrawny
CHICKENS run around in the yard behind them-
LONNIE
Leave off with that, Scratch.
SCRATCH
Aint bothering you.
LONNIE
Yes it is.
That aint no kind of
music.
We see that the board has PIANO KEYS drawn across it and that
Lonnie is pretending to play a song on it-
SCRATCH
Least I make a sound.
LONNIE
Yeah and it's a nasty one.
Lonnie looks at the sky-
SCRATCH
You want to try again tonight?
Lonnie sits on the edge of the porch, gauging the time from
the setting sun-
LONNIE
Might as well.

2
SLIDE GUITAR plays. A tuft of RAW COTTON bobs on the stem
and we begin to scroll OPENING CREDITS-
2.
We TILT and RACK to look over a FIELD OF COTTON, the bolls
plumped out and ready for picking, blowing in the breeze.
A HARVEST HAND steps into the shot, looks toward the setting
sun, wipes his face with a bandanna then stoops to pick the
row in front of him. We PULL BACK to see other PICKERS, men
and women in denim coveralls, old gingham dresses and hard
work shoes, wearing straw hats against the sun and trailing
LONG WHITE SACKS between their legs and behind them.
The boys walk down between them in the opposite direction-

MUSIC CONTINUES.
We see the boys walking on a PATH through
the PINES-
4
4
AFTERNOON
MUSIC CONTINUES. We float over RAILROAD TRACKS cutting
through flat, piney woods, catching up the boys, who walk on
the ties-
5
5
MUSIC CONTINUES. The boys stroll past white buildings of an
ARMY BARRACKS. SOLDIERS, black and white, DRILL on the
grounds-
6
6
The river rolls past us in the FG as the boys cross a
RAILROAD BRIDGE. We SUPERIMPOSE-
ALABAMA
-
1950
OPENING CREDITS END

We hear PIANO MUSIC as we CRANE DOWN toward the HONEYDRIPPER
LOUNGE, a ramshackle wooden roadhouse at a rural crossroads.
3.
BLUE-colored light bulbs (a few broken) FLICK ON and OFF
erratically around the HONEYDRIPPER SIGN as we TRACK toward
and then THROUGH it on the way to the entrance, catching up
with Lonnie and Scratch.
The boys step under the door-light, frantic with insects, and
go up on their toes to peek in through a window-
8
-the RED-lit ACE OF SPADES CLUB across the road, PEOPLE
hanging out in front, LAUGHTER heard from within-
HONEYDRIPPER
Ty reacts.
Behind him, Maceo indicates the near-empty room-
MACEO
Like the man say, you can't argue
with failure.
STOKELY, a bitter drunk who holds on to the end of the bar,
calls out to them-
STOKELY
You know why Slick here is like a
preacher?
Slick tenses, used to this-
STOKELY
Cause he does all his best work on
his knees.
Stokely almost chokes with laughter-
MACEO
Never mind him, he just a drunk-
STOKELY
I hear she put a ring through it
and use it to yank him around the
house.
Slick starts to rise but Maceo puts a hand on his arm-
7.
MACEO
You know Tyrone don't allow no
scufflin here, Slick.
STOKELY
I oughta get me a old woman too,
take care of the groceries. Just
got to sweet-talk her some, give
her a good poke now and then-
MACEO
You gonna drink, Stokely, or you
gonna lay out back recoverin from
that busted head you about to get?
DELILAH
Gentlemen-
They all turn to see DELILAH, Ty's wife, coming out from the
back of the club. She is dressed for church-
SLICK
(doffs his hat)
Miss Delilah-
DELILAH
Let's behave ourselves. (sees)
What are you boys doing in here?
Out!
Lonnie and Scratch, busted, hurry out.
Delilah turns her
attention to China Doll-
DELILAH
And what are you doing behind that
bar?
CHINA DOLL
It's just for a minute.
DELILAH
That's sixty seconds too long.
Maceo, you get back there and take
that child's place.
China Doll mopes as she steps out from behind-
DELILAH
You bring people their food. Don't
you be messing with their liquor.
CHINA DOLL
Nobody's eating.
8.
DELILAH
That's cause nobody's here but
these couple lost souls, haven't
had an appetite since they give
over to the devil.
Maceo gets behind the counter as Delilah heads for Ty at the
door-
BERTHA MAE
At Pinetop's Honeydripper
That's where I get my cold can beer
At Pinetop's Honeydripper
That's where I get my cold can beer-
Maceo reluctantly moves down to take the order of NADINE, a
large, handsome woman with a prominent gold tooth who has
just stepped in-
NADINE
Evenin, Maceo. You lookin good
tonight.
MACEO
Likewise, Miss Nadine.
What can I
do for you?
NADINE
(flirting) You know what you can
do for me, sweet man.
Maceo tries to slip the hook and be polite at the same time-
MACEO
What would you like to drink?
DOORWAY
Ty watches the CROWD in front of the Ace of Spades.
Delilah
comes up to join him, indicates his drink-
DELILAH
How many is that tonight?
TY
Don't dog me about that, baby.
Not
tonight.
DELILAH
I don't want China Doll behind that
bar.
9.
TY
She got to help out.
DELILAH
Not there she doesn't. You know
she's not sposed to get excited-
TY
Not much chance of that in here.
(wistful) Harvest hands all been
crowdin into Toussaint's place.
The young ones.
DELILAH
You'll get some of them.
TY
They stick their noses in here, get
one little sniff of the music, and
they gone.
DELILAH
(joking)
Maybe that's the wages of
sin.
TY
(bitter) Aint no sin happenin here
tonight, baby, and there sure as
hell aint no wages. Your God wants
to chastise some sinners He best
move on over to Toussaint's, got a
whole barroom crowded with em.
DELILAH
He isn't `my God'.
He's
everybody's God.
He looks at his wife-
TY
How that tent meeting went tonight?
DELILAH
Viola Underwood found the Lord.
TY
I thought she found Him last year
when they come through.
10.
DELILAH
(smiles) Well, she must have lost
Him again between then and now,
cause she come down that aisle
tonight hollering in tongues.
TY
The Spirit didn't move you, though?
DELILAH
(thoughtful) Not yet.
Might be
too late for me.
Delilah surveys the room-
DELILAH
I can't believe you're serving
Alton Stokely.
STOKELY
Stokely has to use two hands to keeps his glass steady as he
drinks-
DELILAH (O.S.)
That poor man-
TY (O.S.)
Toussaint cut his credit off.
Either he gets it here-
TY AND DELILAH
TY
-or he drinks that paint-peeler
Willie Pettigrew cooks up back in
the swamp.
DELILAH
He's gonna drink himself to death
in here.
TY
Least he won't go blind first.
Delilah shakes her head and heads out the door-
DELILAH
Imonna go home and say a prayer for
that man.
11.
TY
(calling after)
Say one for me
too, baby.
STAGE
Bertha Mae is singing straight to Slick now, as Metalmouth
backs her up on the harmonica-
BERTHA MAE
Come here sweet Poppa
Let me whisper in your ear
Come here sweet Poppa
Let me whisper in your ear
Go back to Alabama
But don't you leave your Momma here
Only Slick applauds-
SLICK
That was outstandin, baby.
You
still got the voice.
Bertha Mae, a little unsteady, holds onto Slick's arm as he
helps her off the stage-
BERTHA MAE
You think so?
SLICK
Sent a chill down my spine to hear
you.
Bertha Mae looks to Ty as he steps back in-
BERTHA MAE
I might be a little late Saturday,
Tyrone.
TY
(mutters, embarrassed) Don't need
to come in if you don't want to.
She stops dead.
Stares at him till he has to let it out-
TY
I've made other arrangements.
BERTHA MAE
Other arrangements-
12.
TY
Try something new in here.
SLICK
You can't do that!
BERTHA MAE
It's his place, darlin, he can do
whatever he want.
Bertha Mae nods to Ty, holding onto her dignity for all it's
worth-
BERTHA MAE
You know where to find me if you
need me.
Bertha Mae pulls Slick out the door. China Doll watches
after them, troubled, while Ty pours himself another drink-
MACEO
(softly)
I put the box on now, Ty?
TY
Yeah.
Put the box on.
MACEO
Imonna crank it up some, see if we
can draw a little life in here-
Maceo crosses and plugs an ancient-looking tabletop JUKEBOX
in.
The jukebox sputters to life, LIGHTS FLASHING ON and MUSIC
BLARING for a moment, then the LIGHTS FLICKER and all the
POWER in the club goes OFF!
9
9
The Honeydripper SIGN is the last to FLICKER and DIE.
Lonnie and Scratch watch from under the streetlight-
LONNIE
There it go again.
SCRATCH
Lectricity don't like that jukebox.
13.
10
11
Bertha Mae pauses as she climbs the FRONT PORCH of her two-
story wooden HOUSE, the nicest in the neighborhood, listening
to the TRAIN WHISTLE with a troubled look on her face. Slick
waits for her with the door open-
BERTHA MAE
That is a terrible noise.
SLICK
Just the northbound from Talledega.
Sounds like it always does.
BERTHA MAE
Like a soul bein carried away from
this life.
ANOTHER WHISTLE-
SLICK
Come on in, darlin.
You catch your
death out here.
12
12
We hear the TRAIN WHISTLE again as the WHEELS ROLL and the
TRAIN strobes past us, picking up speed as it pulls out from
the yard-
When it clears we see a LONE FIGURE standing across the
tracks. He steps forward and catches a bit of light--
17.
SONNY BLAKE, 20's, rumpled from hard travelling.
He carries
a GUITAR CASE and something bulky in a SACK-
SHACK THOMAS, an older man in a PULLMAN PORTER'S UNIFORM
stands under the moth-addled light on the tiny STATION
PLATFORM, watching Sonny-
SHACK THOMAS
Lucky the high-sheriff aint here to
see you crawl outta that boxcar.
SONNY
He come round here much?
SHACK THOMAS
Only when he's bored.
Sonny reaches Shack at the platform-
SONNY
You working that train?
SHACK THOMAS
Kansas City to New Orleans.
SONNY
What you get off here for?
SHACK THOMAS
I growed up here. Still got
people. How bout you?
SONNY
(shrugs) Got tired of sleepin in a
boxcar. Listen, is there a place
to-
SHACK THOMAS
(points) Switchman's shed, right
over there, has got a cot. Don't
mind the rats none, less you got
food on you- and I can see you and
a good meal has been strangers for
some time.
Sonny looks at the shed, unenthusiastic-
SHACK THOMAS
You get into town tomorrow an need
somethin, tell em Shack Thomas sent
you. They know who you talkin
about.
18.
SONNY
Thanks. Hey, what's the name of
this town?
Shack points to the SIGN hanging down from the lip of the
platform roof-
SIGN
HARMONY
The sign reads-
SONNY (O.S.)
Name like that, must be a good
place for musicians.
PLATFORM
Shack laughs as he heads away-
SHACK THOMAS
Only night I ever spent in jail was
a town called Liberty. Sun comes
up, you'll see where you landed.
And you best be out of that shed by
first light.
13
14
SUNRISE. An OLD MAN in coveralls leads a MULE along the side
of the road.
A TRUCK carrying two dozen PICKERS in its open bed approaches-
TRUCK
One of the pickers, DEX, turns to look back at the man and
mule-
DEX
Aint seen no mule in a long time.
The other pickers, men and women, don't look interested or
even fully awake yet-
21.
DEX
I knew this was Alabama, but that's
the Stone Ages, man.
One of the other men, HAM, looks him over. Dex is little and
combative and has a nasty-looking SCAR on his face. Ham is
big and morose, with a deep, grumpy voice-
HAM
Where you from, boy?
DEX
Memphis.
HAM
Down on you vacation?
A few snickers-
DEX
Got in a piece of trouble up there
with the white folks, need to bide
my time for a spell.
JUNEBUG, a local man with a nervous air, jumps in-
JUNEBUG
You bide any time in these fields,
bossman gonna fire your ass for
takin up space.
DEX
Aint no worry bout that.
I'm a
cotton-pickin fool.
HAM
You a fool, all right.
More snickers and the truck stops at the side of a COTTON
FIELD. Somebody lets the tailgate down and they begin to
climb off-
DEX
And where you from, Brother Bear?
HAM
Missippi.
DEX
Then this a real step up for you.
Folks round here has discovered
fire and whatnot-
22.
HAM
That trouble you in have anything
to do with runnin your mouth?
The pickers unroll the sacks they pick up from the pile
that's been left and begin to spread out at the base of the
unpicked rows-
DEX
Had to do with somebody get on my
nerves and I had to deal with him.
HAM
Must of been somebody kind of puny.
Dex turns to face the much larger Ham-
DEX
As I recall he just about your
size.
The two men stare at each other for a long moment. Way too
early to fight. Dex breaks eye contact and moves toward a
row-
DEX
What's this place we at?
JUNEBUG
Nearest town is Harmony.
This Mr.
Silas Tugwell's place.
He nods toward Dex's row-
JUNEBUG
You better get pickin.
DEX
Cotton aint goin nowhere.
JUNEBUG
More you get first thing when the
dew still on it, the more it weighs
when it tip that scale.
Dex's gaze falls upon a tall, strong-looking young woman
starting down the row next to his-
DEX
You live here too?
She gives him a weary look-
23.
DEX
(shakes his head)
You got my
sympathies.
15
15
A WIDE SHOT of the TRACKS that cut the town in two.
CLOSER
Sonny stands on the tracks just as the SUN RISES, pondering-
which side of the tracks is for white people, which for the
colored.
He hears GUITAR MUSIC to one side, steps cautiously toward it-
16
16
Sonny wanders down the street lugging his sack and case,
moving toward the sound of a SLIDE GUITAR being played
expertly-
An irate-looking WHITE LADY glares at Sonny as she picks up
the milk bottles from her stoop, steps inside and slams the
door. Sonny moves ahead, uneasy-
We TIGHTEN on his face as he stops to listen, the MUSIC
ECHOING, seeming to come from here, then from there, then
suddenly from right behind him-
He turns-
POSSUM, blind, with his chair tilted back against the not-yet-
open GENERAL STORE, PLAYS expertly on a beat-up old GUITAR.
Sonny lays his case down to listen for a moment, watching the
man's fingers-
Possum gets a whiff of him.
He keeps playing as he speaks-
POSSUM
Somebody slept in the railroad
yard.
Sonny watches the blind man's fingers move on the strings-
SONNY
Yall can play that thing.
POSSUM
Been doin it near forever.
24.
SONNY
(looking around) Listen, which
side of the tracks am I-
POSSUM
The wrong side for you.
SONNY
What you doing here then?
POSSUM
White folks look right through me.
How much mischief an old blind
spook like me gonna get up to
anyhow?
Sonny surveys the street-
SONNY
Where our people go for music
around here?
POSSUM
There's a couple places just a
little bit out of town. At the
crossroads.
SONNY
Long walk?
POSSUM
You in a hurry?
Possum finishes his song-
SONNY
How old is that box you playin,
Pops?
POSSUM
(smiles) Second one that ever was-
an the devil's got the first. How
bout yours?
Possum gently nudges Sonny's case with his toe.
Sonny is
surprised at the blind man's perception-
SONNY
Brand new.
Made it myself.
POSSUM
(whistles)
Made it hisself-
25.
SONNY
That's right. So these clubs-
POSSUM
Old Toussaint, owns the Ace of
Spades, don't feature live music.
And Pinetop Purvis, owns the
Honeydripper Lounge? He don't care
bout no guitar. Won't have one
under his roof.
SONNY
That don't make sense.
Possum scratches his head-
POSSUM
Yeah- when a musician put his hand
to murder, nine times outa ten it's
a drummer done it. But Pinetop a
piano man-
SONNY
He killed somebody?
POSSUM
That's the story.
Might be true,
and it might not.
17
17
Ty is tacking one of the Guitar Sam POSTERS on the front of
the building.
POSSUM (V.O.)
But if you meet the man, you damn
well don't be askin him about it.
A CRACKLE and a curse from the side of the roadhouse-
MACEO (O.S.)
Damn!
Ty looks up-
TY
What's the matter?
MACEO (O.S.)
I got a shock.
26.
TY
Thought you used to work for the
power company.
SIDE OF ROADHOUSE, MACEO
Maceo wrestles with the jury-rigged WIRES that run out from
the battered, rusting POWER BOX-
MACEO
I drove a supply truck.
TY (O.S.)
Guitar Sam aint gonna play by no
candlelight.
MACEO
(sniffs)
I smell bacon.
TY (O.S.)
You must of burnt your porky ass
with that lectricity.
CHINA DOLL (O.S.)
Breakfast ready!
FRONT OF ROADHOUSE
China Doll has stepped out from the club-
TY
Where's your mama?
CHINA DOLL
Already over to the Mayor's. She
told me to come here and make sure
you eat something fore you start
runnin around.
Maceo comes around from the side-
MACEO
That is a sweet woman you got.
CHINA DOLL
You got one waitin for you if you
want her.
Maceo makes a face-
27.
MACEO
You mean Nadine?
18
19
A battered TRUCK sits in front of the club. ZEKE, a taciturn
white man, and his black loader step out as Maceo approaches-
MACEO
(calls out) Bout time you fellas
run by. We just about dry here.
The loader lets down the tailgate to reveal CASES OF BEER AND
LIQUOR. He begins to pull them out and pile them on the
ground-
ZEKE
Your boss in?
Maceo shouts back into the club-
MACEO
Tyrone!
Whiskey wagon come by!
Ty steps out of the club carrying one of the Guitar Sam
posters-
TY
Y'all a day late.
Ty nods at the Ace of Spades club across the way-
TY
Old Man Toussaint gonna chew you
out.
ZEKE
Toussaint went over to another
supplier upstate. We just got you,
then we headin down to the army
base, officers' club needs
servicin. This fifty-six dollars-
35.
TY
(weak grin) My credit no good
anymore?
Zeke only has to look at the loader, who starts to put the
cases back onto the truck-
TY
Whoah, whoah- what's your hurry?
ZEKE
Nobody that's right in his head
sell liquor on credit. Specially
not to no darktown roadhouse.
TY
Well this is like a special case,
see- we got the harvest coming in,
soldiers at the base gonna be let
out on leave- Saturday night. Aint
enough hootch in this truck to
satisfy what we gonna sell-
ZEKE
You pay as you go.
That's bidness.
Zeke walks toward the cab of the truck, Ty following him,
desperate, waving the poster-
TY
You can come by Monday, get paid
and take back every damn drop I
aint sold! We got Guitar Sam lined
up, you know what that means?!
Zeke steps in and slams the door, the loader doing the same
on the other side of him-
TY
I'll pay you extra- penny a bottle
on the beer and a nickel on the
whiskey!
The truck engine coughs-
TY
(desperate) What if I throw in
five dollars up front, just for you
fellas- ?
Zeke pulls away-
36.
TY
Come on, man, everybody give
credit, that's the American way!
But the truck is gone down the road.
Maceo comes up beside
Ty, watching forlornly-
MACEO
Maybe we could buy some busthead
from Willie Pettigrew.
TY
With that sheriff sniffin around
every night? Land my black ass in
jail for good.
Another TRUCK pulls around the bend from the opposite
direction-
MACEO
Then what we gonna do?
The new truck slows to a stop by them.
The DRIVER pokes his
head out-
DRIVER
Got a liquor delivery for a Mr.
Lucien Toussaint?
MACEO
That's-
TY
That would be me.
Maceo bites his tongue.
Ty plays it through-
TY
I trust they got my check all
right?
DRIVER
Don't spose I'd be here if they
didn't.
Ty glances over to the Ace of Spades, then points behind the
Honeydripper-
TY
Pull it around to the back- we'll
help you unload.
37.
The driver nods and wheels the truck past them.
Maceo's
smile fades and he looks to Ty-
MACEO
Man, this better be some Saturday
night.
20
22
Ty, Maceo and China Doll approach the general store.
A WHITE
COUPLE enter from the front-
TY
What I need is for you to go get
friendly with Luther, then I just
happen in-
CHINA DOLL
We can't just ask Mr. Skinner?
41.
TY
Mr. Skinner don't want nothin from
colored folks but they buy his
goods and shine his shoes. You go
on ahead, now-
Maceo and China Doll cut around toward the back of the store.
We TIGHTEN on Ty as he unrolls the posters he carries, looks
across the street for another likely place to hang one-
POSSUM (O.S.)
It was early
Friday evenin
Hounds began to bark
Ty turns-
how did Possum get there, chair and all?
POSSUM
Stackolee an Billy Lyons
Was squabblin
In the dark
Ty frowns at the lyrics-
POSSUM
Stackolee said
To Billy Lyons
"What you think bout that?
First you takes all my money
Then you spits in
My Stetson hat."
TY
I hate that damn song.
Possum keeps playing but stops singing-
POSSUM
How you keepin, Tyrone?
TY
(wary) Just tryin to hold it
together.
POSSUM
Got your beautiful young daughter
with you this mornin-
TY
Don't you be studyin her.
42.
POSSUM
Heard you gone put on a guitar man
out your place.
TY
Where you hear that?
POSSUM
(grins)
Oh- the breeze.
TY
Well this time the breeze know what
it's blowin about.
POSSUM
Better be careful, Tyrone. You
know what them guitar players are
like.
Ty glares at Possum-
TY
Be careful yourself.
Ty stalks away around toward the back of the store.
Possum
grins and sings again-
POSSUM
Well he shot him
Three times in the shoulder
Three times in the side
That was the last time he shot him
Cause Poor Billy
Up and died
23
23
A quartet of WORKMEN and DELIVERYMEN lounge on piled up
shipping crates as Shack Thomas stands addressing them-
SHACK THOMAS
The time is ripe and the bill is
past due. Roosevelt would of done
it already, only he died and they
don't listen to Miss Eleanor no
more. But Mr. Truman startin to
bend, specially now that we got a
war heatin up. As Brother Randolph
says-
TY (O.S.)
Here it comes-
43.
Shack looks to see Ty joining the others-
TY
-the gospel accordin to A. Phillip
Randolph.
SHACK THOMAS
(pleased)
Tyrone! How you doing,
man?
TY
Got my nose above the waterline.
SHACK THOMAS
And here's my baby- how's your mama
doing, China Doll?
He gives China Doll a hug and kiss-
CHINA DOLL
She's doin fine, Uncle Shack.
SHACK THOMAS
Just tellin the boys here how
Brother Randolph pushin through
this deal where our boys gonna be a
full part of services- already got
the Navy and the Air Force, and the
Army is-
TY
I carried a rifle in the Great War,
Shack. Boys get in the middle of
this Korea mess they aint gonna
thank you for your efforts.
SHACK THOMAS
We want our due in this country, we
got to go whole hog-
TY
Black folks shooting yellow folks
to keep the white folks happy?
SHACK THOMAS
It's time to move on from that kind
of thinkin.
Ty starts in through the back entrance of the store-
44.
TY
You go ahead and move right on,
Shack. Then come back and tell the
rest of us how it is.
He steps in.
Shack turns to China Doll-
SHACK THOMAS
That is a hard-headed man.
24
25
Ty and China Doll hurry down the tracks and cross to the
black side of town-
TY
You got that boy eatin out of your
hand.
CHINA DOLL
Luther's the only one didn't pull
my hair when he sit behind me at
Sunday school.
TY
Well I hope you got a little that
sugar left, cause we got to spread
some on Miss Bertha Mae Spivey-
CHINA DOLL
You gone ask her to come sing
again?
TY
Imonna ask her for money. Word is
she got a whole pile of it
squirreled away.
China Doll stops, breathing heavily, bends to put her hands
on her knees-
CHINA DOLL
Daddy-
TY
Come on, girl, we in a rush here-
46.
CHINA DOLL
I got to rest.
Ty softens, walks back to stand beside her-
TY
I'm sorry, baby.
You catch your
breath.
China Doll smiles weakly-
CHINA DOLL
So- why Miss Spivey gonna give you
money, you don't let her sing at
the club any more?
TY
Gonna make her a partner.
CHINA DOLL
Partner in what?
TY
In the Honeydripper.
CHINA DOLL
But all you ever say it's just a
hole you pour good money into-
TY
That don't matter.
Imonna make her
a proprietor.
CHINA DOLL
`tress'.
Like waiter and waitress.
TY
Proprietress. She got to like the
sound of that.
26
26
One of the GUITAR SAM POSTERS appears in the front window as
Maceo tapes it up-
A trio on teenage girls stop to look at it as they pass
(Possum is nowhere to be seen)-
Maceo steps out to join them, eager to close the deal-
47.
MACEO
Lovely ladies out to make a
purchase-
OPAL
That the same Guitar Sam is on the
radio?
MACEO
The very one.
OPAL
What's he look like?
MACEO
Fine lookin man. Real lady killer
from what I hear. Got that New
Orleans style to him.
OPAL
You ought to have a picture up
there.
MACEO
Oh, we'll be gettin some of those
when he comes in on the train. The
main thing is, the man is
electrified- and you know what
that means.

Formerly a fairly grand house, Bertha Mae's hasn't been
painted for awhile and the yard could use some work. Ty
coaches China Doll as they climb the stairs-
TY
We make like we just come by to see
how she's keepin, and then I'll
kind of mention how I been thinking
of bringing her on as a partner-
CHINA DOLL
Left the door open.
China Doll pushes the front door all the way open. We can
hear Bertha Mae's VOICE singing on a scratchy old RECORD.
China Doll peeks in to see-

Sonny walking along. He has left his guitar and sack back at
the club. He slows, seeing-
POV - SHERIFF'S CAR
The SHERIFF'S CAR is sitting at the side of the road, a
COUNTRY SONG playing on the radio-
SONNY
He decides to brave it, walks ahead with his eyes fixed
straight ahead. We he gets even with the car we see Sheriff
Pugh sitting in the driver's seat, watching him-
PUGH
In a hurry, boy?
Sonny stops, looks to the Sheriff-
SONNY
Naw, sir.
PUGH
Take your hat off.
Sonny takes his hat off. He meets the Sheriff's eyes, trying
to strike a balance between defiant and submissive-
PUGH
Where you headed?
SONNY
Lookin for work.
PUGH
You're not from here.
SONNY
Naw, sir.
50.
PUGH
Stranger wanderin around, no job-
that would make you a vagrant.
SONNY
But I'm lookin-
PUGH
I got a job for you.
Get in the
back.
Sonny doesn't even think about running away.
31
31
Black PRISON LABORERS pick cotton, watched over by an armed
DEPUTY-
GATLIN (O.S.)
I can always use another hand.
We SHIFT to see GATLIN, a white planter who chews and spits
tobacco, looking Sonny over as Sheriff Pugh stands by-
PUGH
Caught this young fella in flagrant
violation of the statutes. Gawkery
with intent to mope.
GATLIN
What's he gonna run me?
PUGH
Three dollars a day plus you feed
im lunch. Now the sentence- that
depends on how long you gonna need
the help.
Sonny decides to speak up-
SONNY
I don't get any trial?
SHERIFF PUGH
Sure you do, boy. And a speedy
one, too. (points) Meet Judge
Gatlin.
Gatlin spits-
GATLIN
Grab a sack.
51.

Maceo nails a Guitar Sam POSTER to a tree, looks over his
handiwork.
An ARMY PLATOON trudges into the crossroads, sweat-soaked and
footsore-
Maceo watches, pleased, as the black soldiers check the
poster out as they pass-
MACEO
Saturday night, fellas! Every fine-
looking colored woman in the county
gonna be there- don't want to miss
it!
A white LIEUTENANT passes, giving Maceo a dark look.
Maceo
salutes-
MACEO
Afternoon, sir.
Nice lookin bunch
of soldiers.
33
35
Blazing hot.
Cotton chaff in the air as the prison WORK GANG
bend to their
task, dragging long sacks behind them like
snakes. Even
the DEPUTIES are sweating rivulets as they
stand by with
their SHOTGUNS in hand.
Sonny is way behind the others, not dressed for the work,
wincing as he pricks his fingers for the umpteenth time.
NED, a little prisoner picking his way back in the opposite
direction in a parallel row, takes pity on him-
NED
Y'all never done this job before.
57.
SONNY
Can't say I have.
NED
You want to set your pins out wide,
bend over from the hip-
Sonny widens his stance-
NED
-and don't be bobbin up and down
all the time. When you up, be up,
but when you on the row, stay down.
Sonny digs in and keeps low-
NED
But most important, you got to get
you a rhythm. Everything in this
life got a rhythm to it- even
pullin cotton off the plant.
SONNY
Lay it out for me.
NED
Not my rhythm- your rhythm. That's
between you and the day and the
work you got before you. Once you
on it, don't let nothin and nobody
push you off it.
SONNY
I'm going so slow.
NED
You gettin paid by the pound or by
the hour?
SONNY
I'm not gettin paid at all.
None
of us are.
Ned cackles-
NED
Then I suggest you work that into
your rhythm too.
A DEPUTY calls out-
58.
DEPUTY
Let's see more pickin and less
talkin over there!
NED
Gettin right on it, Boss!
Ned picks his way behind Sonny. Sonny starts to rock
slightly, looking for a rhythm of movement he can maintain-
36
36
The free pickers sit on and around the truck that brought
them, eating lunch. Dex watches the prison laborers across
the road as he SHUFFLES a battered DECK OF CARDS, sitting
with a couple of the other men-
DEX
Them boys fryin over there.
JUNEBUG
That Judge Gatlin's gang- he work
them people from can until can't,
ever damn day, and when his fields
is picked he bid em out to the
neighbors. Harvest time comes
round here, you sign up with
somebody fast or you stay outa
sight.
Dex waves flies away from his face, spits-
DEX
Ate a peck of dust today.
JUNEBUG
Take some water.
DEX
Only thing wash the dust out is
whiskey.
JUNEBUG
(smiles) Aint enough whiskey in
this world wash out what I
swallowed in my life.
Dex riffles the cards-
JUNEBUG
What we playin for?
59.
DEX
Two bits a hand.
JUNEBUG
That's kind of steep-
Dex laughs and starts to deal a card at a time to the players-
DEX
Hell, I member playin this game one
night- Memphis is Boss Crump's
town, folks is gamblin before they
can walk- ten dollars a hand. I
caught a winnin streak that cleaned
out half the sportin men on Beale
Street. Got up from that table, my
money was as long as train smoke-
JUNEBUG
What happen to it?
Dex raises his voice so the woman he checked out in the
morning can hear-
DEX
Spent it all on fine-lookin women.
He calls to where Ham stands in knee-high grass, a heavy
stick in his hand, staring intently at the ground-
DEX
Yo, Missippi-
JUNEBUG
His name Hamilton.
DEX
Hambone!
You want in on this?
He raises a matchstick in his fingers-
DEX
Settle up on payday.
HAM
That your deck of cards?
DEX
What if it is?
HAM
I stay clear of it then.
60.
Dex stops dealing to stare at Ham, insulted-
DEX
You sinuatin?
HAM
Just sayin I don't want to play.
There is a sudden RUSTLING at Ham's feet and WHAP! he brings
his stick down hard. He pulls up a RABBIT, dead, by its hind
legs-
JUNEBUG
Looks like dinner.
DEX
Rabbit is a rodent. Man eat a
rabbit, might's well eat a rat.
Dex snorts, disgusted, then finishes dealing. He lays the
top card face up and slaps down the rest of the deck-
DEX
(mutters) Simple country nigger,
fraid to sit down an lose his
little handful of change--
JUNEBUG
He awful big to mess with.
DEX
Don't scare me none. I'm a steppin
razor, man, I'm trouble on two
legs.
We hear a CAR APPROACHING, SLOWING DOWN-
DEX
Your draw, Junebug. And don't be
drippin sweat on my cards.
MACEO (O.S.)
Excuse me, folks-
They turn to see Maceo leaning out of the window of Ty's old
Ford, a Guitar Slim POSTER taped to the side of it-
MACEO
Yall heard about the show we puttin
on at the Honeydripper Saturday
night?
61.
37
37
A very modest wooden house with a porch.
LIGHTS on inside-
38
39
A CHOIR sings at the front of the LANTERN-LIT tent, a
CONGREGATION of salvation-seekers filling the benches-
CHOIR
Mother died-
Yes she died and left me
It was long- long time ago
Oh but I searched
Searched her record over
I found mother just had to go
UNDER TENT
CHOIR
Oh she cried son,
Son don't you worry
Oh you know the Lord
Always fix a way
Delilah arrives at the rear of the tent, finds herself a spot
on a bench-
CHOIR
She left me standing
Standing along the highway
Oh wondering- which way I must go!
REVEREND CUTLIP watches his singers, clapping out time with
his big hands-
CHOIR
As I walked-
All along the highway
I was seeking my Lord each day
She left me standing
Standing along the highway
Just wondering- which way must I
go!
`Amens' and other sounds greet the end of the song. Reverend
Cutlip steps to the center of the platform and looks around
at the souls gathered-
64.
REVEREND CUTLIP
The Highway of Life, Brothers and
Sisters, will twist you and turn
you, it will run you this way and
that way, it will tempt you with
many a detour-- for the Highway of
Life, Brothers and Sisters, is
designed to lead us astray!
He gets an `Amen!' from someone in the crowd-
REVEREND CUTLIP
It meanders away from the Light and
into the Darkness, it tires our
legs and whittles away at our
spirits!
The congregation start to get into it, RESPONDING, rocking
with the rhythm of the sermon, flapping their PAPER FANS that
advertise Beauchamp's Funeral Home in the hot night--
REVEREND CUTLIP
It snares us with the thorns and
thistles of wickedness, it is paved
with the black deeds of sinners and
laid out on a crooked plan! That's
not the road we want to be on,
Brothers and Sisters, that's not
the path we need to follow!
The Reverend picks up speed-
REVEREND CUTLIP
We got to get on that other road!
The one that leads to salvation!
The one that leads to glory! The
one that leads to the right hand of
God! Praise His name!
CONGREGATION
Praise the Lord!
REVEREND CUTLIP
The thoroughfare I'm talking about,
the righteous path we got to tread,
is called the Highway to Heaven,
and by the great Lord above it is
straight and it is narrow!
(MORE)
65.
REVEREND CUTLIP(cont'd)
Keep your eyes on the prize and
your feet on the street and you
won't ever make a mis-step, you
won't ever falter, you won't ever
stumble, because Jesus will show
you the Way!
Several people in the audience are up and SHOUTING now,
getting into the Spirit. Reverend Cutlip shifts gear,
filling his voice with a sense of dread and warning-
REVEREND CUTLIP
But you got to pay attention to who
it is walking beside you, Brothers
and Sisters, got to be wary against
those who will hold you back from
your journey! There's many a loved
one got to be left behind! Cause
you either on the road or you lost
in the wilderness!
DELILAH
We TIGHTEN on Delilah as she listens, upset, taking this all
very personally-
REVEREND CUTLIP (O.S.)
You either headed for glory or
doomed to damnation! You either in
with the Lord or you in with the
Devil- and they aint no in-between!
40
42
MUSIC CONTINUES. We TRACK BACK through the house, looking at
PHOTOGRAPHS and POSTERS of her singing in her glory days,
finally TRACKING out onto the PORCH where Slick sits glumly
on the steps and the undertaker stands in his black suit,
looking at his watch as MOURNERS begin to pass into the house-
43
44
MUSIC CONTINUES. Ty and Maceo help carry the coffin down a
dirt road, Slick walking at the head of the mourners
following it-
68.
45
45
MUSIC CONTINUES as-
Hands grip ropes as the coffin is lowered into the HOLE-
Reverend Cutlip speaks a eulogy-
Slick tries to keep it together-
Scratch and Lonnie watch the ceremony from a tree branch-
Ty looks at his watch, slips away from the funeral party.
Delilah notices, frowns. Reverend Cutlip takes note as well-
A shovel digs into piled dirt-
Dirt is tossed down upon us and the screen goes BLACK.
46
46
Ty waits for a train, still in his mourning suit. We TIGHTEN
on his face- tense, preoccupied with his schemes to save the
club-
POSSUM
Hear tell Miss Bertha Mae passed.
Ty whirls around-- somehow he didn't see Possum, sitting on a
bench behind him, guitar in his lap.
TY
That's right.
POSSUM
She lived it how she sang it.
Ty tries to ignore him, looks down the rails-
POSSUM
Waitin for somebody.
Ty is silent.
POSSUM
Aint nobody on that train gonna
change your luck, Tyrone. Gonna
have to save your own self.
69.
TY
(annoyed)
What you know about
anything?
POSSUM
Oh, nothin much.
Ty steps away.
Possum speaks quietly-
POSSUM
But I know you from way back.
Possum starts PLAYING, a dark, moody, slide-guitar blues.
Ty looks toward Possum, not happy he's there, then looks
away. The MUSIC gets LOUDER, FASTER, Possum MOANING and
WHOOPING, stomping his foot-
We TIGHTEN on Ty's face, tighter, tighter, then DISSOLVE TO:
48
48
Possum stops playing and cocks his head to listen-
The WHISTLE again as the TRAIN APPROACHES.
Ty takes a deep breath, hoping-
70.
49
49
Mourners are walking back down the country road where we saw
the coffin carried.
Reverend Cutlip sidles up to Delilah-
REVEREND CUTLIP
A mournful end for a wayward
sinner.
DELILAH
She always seemed at peace with
herself.
REVEREND CUTLIP
The company she kept, the life she
led-
DELILAH
I never knew Bertha Mae to do hurt
to a living soul.
The Reverend is not too pleased with Delilah's forgiving
attitude-
REVEREND CUTLIP
We're all hoping to see you get
over and accept the Lord tonight,
Delilah.
DELILAH
I'm hoping so too.
Cutlip nods toward the FIELD as they pass the PRISON LABOR
GANG, picking cotton under guard-
REVEREND CUTLIP
You been lingering at the threshold
long enough, Sister. Time to step
ahead.
Delilah tries not to show how shaken she is by this
challenge. She passes out of frame and we see China Doll
bringing up the rear of the funeral party, lost in thought.
She looks over into the cotton field-
POV - SONNY, PRISON LABOR GANG
Sonny bends his back with the other laborers, picking and
sweating-
71.
CHINA DOLL
China Doll pauses, frowns as she sees it is Sonny working, a
DEPUTY strolling past him, shotgun in hand. Sonny sees her,
lowers his head in shame-
50
50
The TRAIN has just pulled into the station.
A pair of
PULLMAN PORTERS step out--
But nobody else.
Ty feels his heart sink. Shack Thomas comes up behind him,
carrying an overnight bag-
SHACK THOMAS
Tyrone- got somebody gettin off
here?
TY
Supposed to be.
He halts by Ty for a moment, watching.
Nobody else is
stepping out-
SHACK THOMAS
What's the party's name?
TY
Sam- Guitar Sam-- don't know his
birth name-
SHACK THOMAS
(impressed) He's comin here?
He calls to the porters further up the platform-
SHACK THOMAS
Yo, Nat!
Guitar Sam get on this
train?
NAT
Naw, man. He's in the hospital
back in Little Rock.
TY
Hospital?
72.
NAT
You know music folks- whatever he
was doin, he must have done too
much of it.
The porters LAUGH. Shack, realizing this must be a setback
for Ty, pats his shoulder before he steps onto the train-
SHACK THOMAS
Well, brother- maybe he be in
tomorrow.
We FOLLOW Ty away from the train as Nat calls `All aboard!'
and the engine gathers power.
Possum sits listening to the single SLIDE NOTES he plays, as
if tuning his guitar-
POSSUM
Somebody didn't show up.
TY
(grim) Wish they'd made you dumb
instead of blind.
We HOLD on Possum, cackling darkly, as Ty walks away.
The
train WHISTLE BLOWS-
51
53
A SHOTGUN in a deputy's arms-
POV - PICKERS
Faces dripping sweat, prison gang pickers stoop to their work-
TY
Ty stands by his beat-up old Ford at the side of the road,
watching, remembering.
A few of the PRISON LABORERS look up, curious, as Sonny is
led over-
DEPUTY
This the one?
Ty nods, looks to Sonny-
TY
You got any ideas about turning
rabbit on me, you best get rid of
em now.
SONNY
You payin my way out?
TY
Till Monday.
SONNY
How come?
They get INTO THE CAR-
TY
You like draggin that cotton sack?
SONNY
No.
TY
Then don't ask questions.
83.
Ty pulls away, leaving the less fortunate stooped in the
field-
54
57
The free pickers are lined up at the side of the road-
CLOSER
A white CLERK sits behind a wooden table in front of the
transport truck and pulls cash from a METAL BOX, consulting a
thick LEDGER in front of him as he pays the pickers off.
Sheriff Pugh observes, his patrol car parked nearby.
Ham has come to the head of the line, Junebug behind him-
CLERK
Twenny-four, twenny-five, twenny-
six, twenny-seven, twenny-eight.
Make your mark here-
HAM
(softly)
Owe me thirty.
CLERK
Book says twenny-eight.
HAM
Dollar fifty every hundred pound,
and I picked-
CLERK
Two dollars deducted for stones.
HAM
I didn't put no stones in the sack.
CLERK
We mill the cotton, there's always
stones.
HAM
But there wasn't none in my sack-
CLERK
We take off two dollars a week,
always have. Aint that right,
Junebug?
Junebug knows it's useless to complain-
JUNEBUG
Yes suh.
Been that way my whole
life.
90.
Ham is furious but has nowhere to go with it-
SHERIFF PUGH
You gonna take your pay, son, or
give it up to charity?
Ham swipes his pay off the table, stalks away.
Sheriff Pugh
glares after him.
We FOLLOW Ham as he crosses to the rear of the truck.
Dex
sits on the tailgate, grinning at him-
DEX
Wouldn't let nobody mess with my
money like that.
HAM
They took the same two dollars off
yours.
DEX
Yeah, and you could pave a highway
with the rocks I threw in that
mess.
He catches the eye of Lucille, standing nearby-
DEX
You country nigros let the crackers
run you like dogs-
SNATCH! Ham grabs Dex by the shirt front and yanks him
close, hissing in fury-
HAM
That sheriff wasn't here I'd snap
your neck, boy.
SHERIFF PUGH (O.S.)
Don't let me stop you.
Ham turns to see Sheriff Pugh standing behind him, a wry
smile on his face-
SHERIFF PUGH
But first you gonna sign that
ledger like you sposed to. Don't
want nobody cryin they didn't get
their due.
91.
58
62
MUSIC CONTINUES. Luther struts around a corner in the black
section of town, dressed up to party. Behind him we see a
half-dozen other YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN, all decked out, moving
toward the railroad tracks-
CHOIR (V.O.)
You
got to choose
Got
to choose tween the fire and
the
Light
All
you sinners
Got
to choose tween the fire and
the
Light
63
65
MUSIC CONTINUES. We TRACK toward the barracks-like housing
for itinerant workers as PICKERS come out, cleaned up and
ready to celebrate-
CHOIR (V.O.)
All you sinners
Got to choose tween the world and
the Lord
Ham walks alone. We see him stuff his ROLL of single dollar
BILLS into one pocket, tuck a FOLDING KNIFE into the other.
He passes a telephone pole and we HOLD on the Guitar Sam
POSTER tacked up on it-
CHOIR (V.O.)
Train is leavin
Better jump on board!
66
66
Delilah arrives at the revival tent, the CHOIR already
SINGING-
CHOIR
You got to kneel
Got to kneel for the Savior and
pray
You got to kneel
Got to kneel for the Savior and
pray
97.
67
67
MUSIC CONTINUES. The BLUE LIGHTS of the SIGN come on.
PEOPLE fill the yard in front, heading into the Honeydripper.
Metalmouth collects COVER CHARGE at the door, MONEY passing
hands-
CHOIR (V.O.)
All you sinners
Got to kneel for the Savior and
pray
Aint no hidin
From the Judgement Day!
68
69
Reverend Cutlip holds forth under the LANTERN LIGHT-
REVEREND CUTLIP
The Lord don't want nobody to sit
back suffering! He wants you to
stand up! He wants you to rise up!
He wants you to step forward! He
wants you rush down into the
merciful arms of His eternal
salvation!
Many of the congregation are up on their feet, clapping and
testifying-
REVEREND CUTLIP
Is there anyone out here tonight
gonna answer His call? Is there
anyone out here tonight gonna come
forward and be saved?
99.
DELILAH
Delilah is standing, tears running down her cheeks, filled
with the emotion of the moment-
REVEREND CUTLIP
The fire is heatin up, Brothers and
Sisters, and Judgement Day is nigh!
Aint no time to hesitate, you got
to come on down and take Him into
your heart!
Delilah starts to walk down the aisle-
REVEREND CUTLIP
That's right- come on down! They
no turning back now- feel the
Lord's hand at your back- got to
leave all them sinners behind!
Delilah stops in the middle of the aisle, trembling, unsure-
REVEREND CUTLIP
(sees her) You got a voice in your
heart, Sister- that's the Lord
talking! You hear him?
Delilah starts to nod her head, weeping-
REVEREND CUTLIP
That voice telling you where you
need to be right now! You just got
to move your feet and get there!
70
72
Ham and a few other pickers stand outside Toussaint's, beers
in hand, staring across toward the Honeydripper as Sonny
steps out PLAYING with a CROWD behind him-
HAM
What the hell is that?
Sonny steps out into the middle of the crossroads and plays,
a CAR stopping short of running him over.
107.
He hops up on the hood and keeps playing, a TRUCK from the
other direction stopping to blast him with its HEADLIGHTS.
Sonny indicates with his guitar neck to the CROWD emptying
out of Toussaint's that he wants them to follow, then hops
down onto a big picker's back and is carried back in to the
Honeydripper, still playing-
HAM
We got to check that out!
A couple dozen patrons move away with him. We HOLD on the
doorway as OLD MAN TOUSSAINT comes out to look, puzzled and
angry-
73
76
Slick sits on a tomb, drinking wine, MOONLIGHT spilling over
Bertha Mae's fresh-dug GRAVE. He listens to the MUSIC in the
far distance-
SLICK
Sound like the music movin on
again, darlin. The way it always
do.
He listens for another moment, sighs-
SLICK
Time to make room for whoever comin
next.
FADE TO BLACK.
115.
77
77
The SUN RISES next to the Honeydripper sign. We hear the
CROW of a distant ROOSTER. The parking lot is empty but for
Ty's old Ford-
Ty, exhausted but happy, steps out front. He pastes a SNIPE
that says HELD OVER! across the Guitar Sam poster-
POSSUM (O.S.)
That boy can play some.
Ty turns. Possum is on the road, guitar strung over his
shoulder, feeling his way with a red-tipped CANE.
TY
You leavin?
POSSUM
Aint needed round here no more.
TY
Where you headed?
POSSUM
(smiles)
Oh-- down the road.
Ty watches the blind man move away for a moment.
MACEO (O.S.)
Tyrone-
Ty turns as Maceo steps out, equally tired and unshaven-
MACEO
Who you talkin to out here?
Maceo looks down the road, but Possum is nowhere to be seen.
Ty shrugs-
TY
Just myself.
78
78
Scratch and Lonnie are set to pretend to play music again.
Lonnie spreads his fingers over the keys he's drawn on the
board-
-and begins to PLAY!
Fast, rhythmic boogie piano-
116.
Instead of a Diddley bow, Scratch is pretending to tune the
two strings on a `guitar' made of a plank of wood and baling
wire. He carefully takes a length of clothesline rope
leading from the guitar, tacks the end of it to the wall of
the shack, plugging himself in. He looks to Lonnie, who
nods, and then-
-he begins to PLAY in time with Lonnie.
We CRANE UP and away from them, the MUSIC spilling out over
the field-
It sounds a whole lot like rock and roll.
