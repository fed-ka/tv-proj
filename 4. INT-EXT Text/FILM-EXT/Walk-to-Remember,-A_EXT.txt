A vast view of the coastline in winter -- beaches, rivers,
sea marshes, inlets -- ebbing and flowing.
ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
For many, days and nights are
spent fishing Pamlico Sound or
crabbing the Neuse River.
The CAMERA FINDS a small coastal town, edged by a harbor
on which fishermen toil.
The CAMERA, MOVING inland, CROSSES OVER modest houses
decked with plastic rooftop Santas...
ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
While the ocean may be the focus
of daily labor, churches have
always tried to be the focus of
life.
And MOVES UPHILL TO...
Where fake snow is sprayed on store windows. The CAMERA
CONTINUES TO the far side of Main Street -- with its
stately homes with big lawns, flower beds, and tasteful
Christmas garlands.
ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
When I lived here, there were
eighteen churches within town
limits alone.
2.
From each corner, four churches face each other. The
Fellowship Hall Christian Church, the Church of the
Forgiven People, the Church of Sunday Atonement, and All
Saints Church.
ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
They sponsored pancake breakfasts,
rummage sales, car washes, and
softball games.
The CAMERA FINDS and FOLLOWS a newish sport utility
vehicle with MD plates as it passes a rummage sale and a
softball game.
ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
You'd think that all the people
here were friendly, welcoming,
open-hearted...
Dr. LANDON CARTER, 33, drives the truck.
Landon's truck turns the corner and slows in front of the
huge Southern Baptist church.
ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
But they did matter. They
mattered to everyone. Except
Jamie Sullivan...
Landon's truck turns into a driveway just past the church
and heads for a cluster of buildings. Behind the
buildings, a cemetery.
3.
The truck pulls up in front of the old parsonage -- it's a
different color than he remembers.
ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
... Astronomer. Actress.
Believer in God...
Landon hesitates a moment, then climbs out of his truck.
Landon heads up the walk and onto the front porch.
Presses the DOORBELL. It RINGS inside. Landon is edgy,
unsettled.
ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
... Believer in me.
A nurse opens the door.
DISSOLVE TO:
ROCK MUSIC drifts out open doors -- barely recognizable as
"Born in the U.S.A." Students hang. Brains, preps,
richies, heavy metals, jocks, punk rockers, goths, geeks.
Mixing without mixing. Most are red-eyed, woozy, wasted.
A couple of boys break dance to a BOOM BOX.
Missing are the criminals...
A shiny T-top CAMARO ROARS up. Stops, TIRES SQUEALING.
VAN HALEN BLASTING. LANDON, 18, at the wheel. He is
impulsive, sexy-troubled, with the nothing-to-lose courage
to act on destructive whims. He is envied, copied,
feared.
CLAY, obese, wearing a too-small student monitor vest, is
dumping garbage from a trash can. A loud HONK. Clay
turns to see the Camaro, then turns back to the school,
coast clear. He quickly heaves in the empty trash can as
the Camaro pulls up.
Eric pushes a door open.
Empties fall from the back seat.
Clay climbs in.
CLAY
Go go go go.
PRINCIPAL ED KELLY, middle-aged, pockmarked skin, Casio
calculator watch, exits the gym.
Landon drops Clay's student monitor vest out onto the
road. Another car runs it over.
Mr. Kelly walks over, picks up the vest. Shakes it.
Frustrated. Eyes the empty beer bottles by the dumpster.
Camaro is parked on the dirt access road, headlights
shining through the locked rear gate. JOHN COUGAR
MELLENCAMP's "Small Town" playing.
Eric finishes taking a leak.
ERIC
(calling over,
repeating)
Landon. To save your life, you
have to either go deaf or go numb
in your dick and balls.
Eric climbs back in the car.
JAMIE (GIRL), hearing the laughter, gathers herself and
approaches Landon's window, her SNEAKERS CRUNCHING in the
GRAVEL. She crosses her pilly brown sweater across her
chest.
JAMIE
(to Landon,
tentative)
Hey. Hi. Your lights. Any
chance you could... turn them
off --
BELINDA
(leaning over
Landon)
God give you this road?
JAMIE
No --
BELINDA
Then we'll be keeping the lights
on.
(CONTINUED)
8.
CONTINUED:
LANDON
(to Jamie, seeming
nice)
If you want the lights off, I'll
turn them off.
And he does.
Darkness.
JAMIE
Thank you.
Thank you so very
much.
She backs away from the car, grateful.
From the car:
BELINDA (O.S.)
I can't see a friggin' thing.
Jamie, startled, paused at the top. But instead of
looking bullied, her face shows determination, humor even.
A moment later, she jumps down on the far side.
Disappears.
Landon looks up at the fence.
10.
LANDON'S POV
Jamie sitting atop, holding a large mirror, reflecting the
headlights back into the car.
BACK TO SCENE
They stare at each other.
His annoyance turns to mild
respect.
The CB RADIO comes to life inside the car.
A GARBLED
TRANSMISSION.
BELINDA (O.S.)
Landon!
The Camaro fishtails away. TIRES CRUNCHING, red
taillights bouncing on the rough road. The car turns left
onto the paved road and speeds out of sight.
Turns right, following the fire trucks.
An old man walking his little dog.
Crossing the street.
The Camaro swerves.
TIRES SQUEALING.
A LOUD, HEART-
SEARING THUMP.
The old man -- sideswiped, drops to the asphalt.
The CAMARO SLAMS into a light pole.
CRUNCHING METAL.
TINKLING GLASS.
The Camaro crumpled into the light pole. Headlights
askew. Clay and Eric and Belinda getting out, dazed.
Landon runs to the old man. Kneels. Shakes him.
No
response. The man's TERRIER BARKS at Landon.
LANDON'S FACE
Frightened, anguished.
The real Landon showing for an
instant.
Police SIRENS WAIL in the b.g., growing LOUDER.
A battered Chevette steers through a working-class
neighborhood.
By daylight, a modern brick and glass structure.
Landon busts out, arms high, fists tight, like a righteous
political prisoner. Freedom. He struts through the
courtyard. Not a care in the world.
Landon watches a tow truck lower the crumpled Camaro. A
neighbor kid, JOSH, 12, watches from across the street, on
his way to school.
Landon pokes and prods his car -- the engine, underneath,
the body, the paint. A discouraging mess.
Landon lifts the garage DOOR.
15.
LANDON'S POV - INSIDE GARAGE
A murky place.
Filled with old tools and junk and a grim
old bike.
Landon comes out the glass door, his arms loaded, sees his
bike. No way to carry. He looks around. The bus stop.
A bus approaching.
BANGING, RATCHETING, CLINKING. Landon's working hard.
A
BOOM BOX playing SIMPLE MINDS' "Alive and Kicking."
LANDON'S POV - HIS MOTHER'S LEGS
and worn terry slippers appear.
CYNTHIA (O.S.)
I want to talk to you.
He pauses, annoyed, then rolls himself out.
The mangled front bumper's on the ground. Cynthia stands
there in her bathrobe. Upset. Landon's almost too much.
CYNTHIA
You're not hanging round here all
day.
LANDON
I'm not hanging. I'm fixing my
car --
CYNTHIA
You don't need a car you can't
drive for a month. Go see Marvin.
LANDON
'Bout what?
CYNTHIA
About a job.
Landon ignores her.
Slides back under his car.
16.
CYNTHIA (O.S.)
He's going to try you as assistant
manager.
(beat)
You could be manager someday.
Landon can't believe this.
Landon slides back out.
LANDON
I'm not working there.
Cynthia sets her jaw.
He knows that look.
Raining. Landon exits behind all the others. Stands
under an overhang, lights a cigarette, angry, waiting for
a ride. Jamie approaches, something on her mind.
LANDON
(rude)
You're like this fly, buzzing
buzzing everywhere --
JAMIE
-- This play means a lot to me.
LANDON
(snorting)
This play -- ?
JAMIE
-- I know you don't suck at
acting.
Landon laughs. Refusing to take her seriously. Behind
him, the lights go out as the school closes for the night.
JAMIE
But you have to make it a big joke
because only dorks and dweebies
like doing theater --
LANDON
-- What are you going on about?
Pause.
JAMIE
I can judge too.
(CONTINUED)
27.
CONTINUED:
He exhales, eyeing her, daring her.
JAMIE
You don't care about classes or
graduating. But you like school
because you're popular and you
know you'll never be on top again.
LANDON
That's deep --
JAMIE
-- Your act only works with an
audience.
LANDON
My act?!
She walks off toward her father's old Pontiac.
The last
car in the parking lot.
Fire trucks rush by on the street below. Landon's ears
twitch. He looks about. No one, no ride. He sees the
Pontiac backing out of a parking spot.
Landon bangs on the side of her car as she drives past.
LANDON
A ride?!
Please!
Landon and Jamie walk around the fire, watching the fire
and the firemen. Landon is just tolerating her.
JAMIE
The reason I got the part... I'm a
little like Lizzie. Except I
don't worry about some man
rescuing me.
LANDON
Good thing.
If she's offended, she keeps it to herself.
(CONTINUED)
30.
CONTINUED:
LANDON
You got some kind of list?
JAMIE
Are you asking to mock me or do
you really want to know?
LANDON
Maybe a little of both.
They both smile.
JAMIE
I'll take a chance.
LANDON
Go for it.
JAMIE
It's like a to-do list, but for my
life.
He smirks.
JAMIE
If you can't imagine the future,
you won't have one.
He lights a cigarette.
She reaches for it.
LANDON
(joking)
Having a cigarette. 100.
She grins and takes a drag.
They share the cigarette.
LANDON
So what else is on this list?
JAMIE
It's private.
LANDON
(cajoling)
You want to tell me...
She eyes him, not certain she's willing to risk sharing
her dreams with him.
LANDON
(guessing, rudely)
Get very wasted. Lose your
virginity --
(CONTINUED)
31.
CONTINUED:
JAMIE
(correcting)
Spend a year in the Peace Corps.
Make a medical discovery --
LANDON
(contemptuous)
Ambitious.
JAMIE
Being negative's a lot more work
than being positive.
LANDON
Like you'd know.
JAMIE
I do know.
(pause)
Be two places at once... learn to
hit a baseball or turn a
cartwheel... eat breakfast with
chopsticks...
He likes the frivolity of these.
LANDON
What's... Number one?
She looks away, embarrassed.
JAMIE
(changing subject)
If you want help with your lines,
I have two conditions.
(smiling)
You have to promise not to fall in
love with me.
He's certain she's joking.
LANDON
No problem --
JAMIE
And you have to meet my father.
He looks at her like she's crazy to worry about this.
LANDON
Fathers love me.
32.
CLOSE ON PARSONAGE FRONT DOOR
swinging open. Reverend Sullivan looming tall.
Ichabod
Crane in a collar.
Landon gives a cheery little wave. He's very sweaty.
His
bike teeters on its kickstand in the b.g.
LANDON
Hey.
Landon Carter.
Landon offers his hand. The Reverend shakes reluctantly,
eyeing him closely: Landon's Army boots, torn jeans,
dirty t-shirt, aloof manner.
REV. SULLIVAN
(surprised)
You're in the play?
LANDON
Lead man.
Jamie slides out the door. She looks good in jeans and a
white t-shirt. Almost normal. In the b.g., Landon's BIKE
CRASHES over. He bounds down the porch steps.
LANDON
(explaining bike)
They took my license for 30 days.
But nobody's pressing charges.
The Reverend looks at Jamie, concerned. Landon tries the
kickstand, then leans the bike against a carefully trimmed
bush. Not the best place.
JAMIE
I'll get something for us to
drink --
LANDON
Don't bother!
But she's already gone.
The Reverend gestures toward the
open front door.
Landon is waiting when Jamie appears. He has scripts in
his back pocket. They smile at each other, laugh.
JAMIE
(re: her father)
I know. Don't say anything.
LANDON
He's a softy. Got him wrapped
around my finger.
JAMIE
You think so.
LANDON
Know so.
(CONTINUED)
35.
CONTINUED:
She grins, skeptical.
JAMIE
This way.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Jamie leads Landon toward the cemetery rear gate.
JAMIE
People think I'm strange, don't
they?
LANDON
(smiling)
Yes.
JAMIE
Because I try to be nice to
people?
LANDON
Yeah.
Maybe.
I dunno.
JAMIE
Do you think I'm strange?
Pause.
Landon's caught off-guard by her frankness.
LANDON
Yeah.
But that can be good.
Jamie quickly scales the fence.
Landon's right after her.
LANDON
Why are we here?
Landon, Clay, Eric, Belinda. Eric's pickup is parked by
Belinda's Cabriolet. RADIOS ON, BLASTING the same
station, same song: JOHN FOGERTY's "Rock and Roll Girls."
ERIC
Women are definitely evolving into
men.
CLAY
The moustaches on some girls.
Unbelievable.
BELINDA
Why is Jamie Sullivan staring at
us?
They look.
Jamie's watching them.
They laugh.
ERIC
She wants to jump Landon's bones.
BELINDA
That is so pitiful.
LANDON
She's very confused.
CLAY
Deluded.
ERIC
Deranged.
(CONTINUED)
41.
CONTINUED:
LANDON
Demented.
BELINDA
She's coming over here...
LANDON
Heart be still.
They laugh more and she's there.
JAMIE
(to Landon)
Hi.
He doesn't respond.
She shifts from foot to foot.
Confused.
JAMIE
The play's going to be really
good.
LANDON
(mocking her)
I'm really glad you think so.
His friends snicker and guffaw.
She looks at them, then
back to Landon.
JAMIE
I guess you don't want to practice
lines tonight.
LANDON
You guessed right.
She gives him a funny look and walks away.
A better
person than he and he knows it.
BELINDA
That's one girl who can't take a
hint.
LANDON
Because she doesn't know what a
hint is.
They laugh. Landon the loudest.
It feels good, but he
also feels a little... bad.
Landon can't believe this.
He presses the BELL again.
LANDON
(talking to door)
Jamie?
(beat)
Open up.
(beat)
Open the door. Please.
(long beat)
Reverend Sullivan, I have to talk
to your daught--
JAMIE
What is your problem?
She's standing in the front yard.
LANDON
You're not in a very good mood.
JAMIE
You don't miss a thing.
WIDER
He steps down off the porch.
LANDON
The play's in a couple of weeks.
JAMIE
Yes.
And?
(CONTINUED)
43.
CONTINUED:
LANDON
I was hoping we could run lines
together.
JAMIE
Oh.
Just not at school...
LANDON
Yeah --
JAMIE
Or anywhere where people might see
us.
LANDON
Belinda's a very jealous person.
JAMIE
That would be the reason.
Pause.
He thinks she might be going for this.
JAMIE
So it's like you want to be secret
friends.
LANDON
That's it! Exactly! You're
reading my mind --
JAMIE
Then maybe you can read mine.
She walks up the porch steps, goes in the front door, and
opens it. Before she goes in:
JAMIE
I thought I saw something in you,
something good. But I was wrong.
Landon walks to his car, then yells back at the parsonage.
LANDON
Why do you have to be so weird?!
The front door opens, startling Landon. It's the
Reverend. Red-faced with fury. Landon glares back, but
then climbs in his car and drives off. Ashamed.
Landon and Luis face each other across the half-court.
Landon's got a ball and is further from the basket.
LANDON
You, me, and the basket. We're
the three corners of a triangle.
Take one step in.
Landon and Luis both step forward.
LANDON
Am I at the same angle to you and
the basket as before?
LUIS
Yeah.
LANDON
Are you?
LUIS
Yeah.
LANDON
So what did we just make?
LUIS
A similar triangle?
LANDON
What else? What kind of triangle
has three sides of different
lengths.
LUIS
Scalene?
LANDON
Okay.
Make me an isosceles.
Luis steps outward, directly opposite Landon.
LANDON
Yes!
Two sides the same.
Landon tosses him the ball. They play. Jamie glances
over from a picnic table where she works with her student,
Isabel. Landon looks at her, she looks away, he looks
back. Thoughtful. Watching her. But not staring.
On the marquee: The Rainmaker. Under this, "All
Invited." Under this, a full parking lot.
Landon runs out, looking for his friends.
Mr. Kelly
shakes his hand, then deals with parents.
LANDON'S POV
Belinda getting into her car.
WIDER
LANDON
Belinda!
Belinda stops.
BELINDA
What?!
She waits.
Landon struggles with what to say.
BELINDA
That's what I thought!
Landon watches her START her CAR, back from a parking
space --
DR. CARTER
Landon.
Landon turns.
His father is standing on the curb.
DR. CARTER
Fine performance.
LANDON
Who invited you?
(CONTINUED)
50.
CONTINUED:
DR. CARTER
Ed Kelly.
I thought we might get
a bite --
LANDON
Not hungry.
Landon moves toward his Camaro.
DR. CARTER
Landon! Please. Don't walk away
from me.
LANDON
Like you walked away from us?
Landon opens his car door and gets in.
Not forgiving.
Landon waits by Jamie's locker.
The BELL RINGS.
No
Jamie.
Eric and Clay watch Landon hammer out dents in the Camaro.
They're smoking, sharing some beers. Josh, the neighbor
kid, stands across the street, wanting to be invited over.
ERIC
(contemptuous)
She's like some Puritan.
LANDON
She's not.
She's got her own
ideas.
CLAY
Mutant ideas.
(CONTINUED)
51.
CONTINUED:
LANDON
Maybe to you.
Eric and Clay exchange a look -- is Landon defending her?
ERIC
Belinda's telling everyone that
kiss was real.
LANDON
It was.
Eric and Clay smirk in disbelief.
ERIC
And that you're scamming on Jamie
Sullivan.
LANDON
(not denying it)
Scamming's a strong word.
Landon's waiting when Jamie approaches her locker. Her
hair pulled back. She looks good in a simple, fresh way.
LANDON
You weren't in school yesterday.
JAMIE
I went to the doctor with my
father.
LANDON
He okay?
JAMIE
Healthy as can be.
Pause. She doesn't help him.
She opens her locker, gets
what she needs.
LANDON
You were great the other night.
JAMIE
Thank you.
So were you.
Pause.
He tries to touch her hair.
She ducks.
LANDON
I haven't been nice to you.
(CONTINUED)
52.
CONTINUED:
JAMIE
You're hardly nice to anyone.
LANDON
(sincere)
I'm sorry.
JAMIE
(walking away)
I wish I could believe you.
Landon follows Jamie out of the building.
Catches up.
(CONTINUED)
54.
CONTINUED:
LANDON
Jamie --
JAMIE
You lack honor. You lack
compassion. You lack honesty.
You lack humanity.
She heads to the old Pontiac.
Landon jogs after her.
LANDON
Okay. Maybe some of that is
true --
JAMIE
You don't know the first thing
about being someone's friend --
LANDON
I don't want to be just your
friend --
JAMIE
You don't know what you want --
LANDON
You don't either. Take a look at
yourself. Maybe you're scared
that someone might actually like
you --
JAMIE
And why would that scare me?
LANDON
Because then you couldn't hide
behind your books and your
telescope and your sweater and
your God.
She gets into her car. Slams the door.
STARTS the
ENGINE. She recognizes the truth.
LANDON
But the real reason you're scared?
You like me!
She drives off. Clay and Eric, watching, guffaw at
Landon's spectacle.
LANDON
If you were really my friends,
you'd be helping me, not running
me down.
(CONTINUED)
55.
CONTINUED:
ERIC
The only one running you down is
you.
Landon sits alone. Legs dangling over. Lighting and
dropping matches into the black beyond his feet. His body
caught in the occasional sweep of car headlights.
Nearby, an abandoned car.
A rusty old Yugo.
The door is open to a lab where Jamie and the Star Club is
meeting. Landon mops, working hard, while listening in.
Inside, Jamie ignores him.
Mr. Kelly watches from near the trophy case.
Almost
approving.
MR. KELLY
Mr. Carter. Don't wear a hole in
that one spot there.
Landon grins and moves on. Behind Landon's back, Mr.
Kelly peeks into the science lab. Sees Jamie. Looks back
at Landon. Wonders.
Landon parks his Camaro.
It's shiny and buffed and
perfect again.
Hanging on the front door:
a simple evergreen wreath with
a plaid bow.
Landon slides his backpack off his shoulder.
Pulls out a
shopping bag. Holds it out to Jamie.
LANDON
(awkward)
It's a present. Take it.
She does. She opens the bag, pulls out a beautiful pink
sweater. She's overwhelmed.
Without a word, just a happy smile, Landon hops down the
steps toward his car. Reverend Sullivan appears in the
doorway.
LANDON
(calling back)
Merry Christmas! And to all a
good night!
60.
Landon speeds, the windows open, WIND WHIPPING, DIRE
STRAITS BLASTING. The Camaro turns and brakes and turns
again, kicking up gravel, raising hell. The car slides to
a stop.
Colorful banners and flags flap in the brisk WIND.
Landon
talks with a used car SALESMAN.
SALESMAN
Eight hundred.
LANDON
It's got a new V-6 and
transmission. Alloy wheels.
(beat)
Twelve hundred.
(CONTINUED)
63.
CONTINUED:
SALESMAN
Nine-fifty.
LANDON
New paint. Extra chrome.
Not a
scratch anywhere.
SALESMAN
The interior is --
LANDON
Reconditioned. Completely. Be a
collector's someday. Twelve
hundred.
They look at the Camaro.
Shining in the sun.
SALESMAN
You can't expect me to pay you for
your -- attachment to that car.
Landon gazes at another dealership across the street, then
adopts the surly, vaguely-threatening attitude of old.
LANDON
I don't. I expect you to pay me
for yours.
The Salesman looks from Landon to the car. He pulls a wad
of cash from his pocket. Wearily counts out twelve bills.
Landon takes the money, touches the Camaro's hood, then
walks away.
The marquee reads, "HAPPY HOLIDAYS!"
One car. An old station wagon.
At the parking space, a
sign: "School Principal Only."
Landon watches a tow truck lower the abandoned Yugo. When
the car is down, he sees Jamie standing on the sidewalk.
Landon faces Jamie.
LANDON
Hey.
JAMIE
I heard what you did.
Thank you.
He nods, but quickly changes the subject.
LANDON
(re: the Yugo)
She great or what?
JAMIE
Why are you doing all this?
To
impress me?
LANDON
No.
(beat)
But are you -- impressed?
She smiles.
(CONTINUED)
65.
CONTINUED:
JAMIE
Like fire.
LANDON
What?
JAMIE
You.
She heads for her father's old Pontiac.
LANDON
New Year's Eve. Would you go out
with me?!
She stops.
Turns around.
Surprised.
JAMIE
Yes.
But not as a date date.
LANDON
Why not?
JAMIE
I'm not allowed to date.
She smiles and gets in the car.
Landon follows signs for the church office.
Landon's under the Yugo's hood.
Josh, the kid from next
door, is in the driver's seat.
LANDON
Start the engine.
Josh turns the key. Nothing happens.
Under the hood,
Landon changes something.
LANDON
Again.
Josh tries the engine again.
Still no go.
Landon changes
something else.
LANDON
One more time.
Josh tries one more time. The ENGINE ROARS, then DIES,
then amazingly STARTS again. It's running. Landon high-
fives Josh, then sees an old station wagon turn in.
Kelly hands a paper to Landon.
MR. KELLY
Your grades for fall semester.
They're -- good.
LANDON
(incredulous)
You came here to give me my report
card?
MR. KELLY
I've seen students with records
like yours go to J.C. for a couple
of years, then transfer to a good
college.
Landon understands what Kelly is implying.
MR. KELLY
I'd gladly write you a letter of
recommendation.
LANDON
Thank you.
MR. KELLY
You're welcome.
They shake hands.
68.
Landon steers the car into a parking lot for a miniature
golf course with a castle-shaped video arcade and Little
League diamond. A family entertainment center.
The YUGO ROARS down the asphalt.
A sign for the
approaching state line whips by.
Landon takes Jamie's hand and pulls her toward some
invisible place.
JAMIE
Where -- what -- are we -- ?
He keeps tugging her.
She follows him.
Laughing.
LANDON
Stand right here.
JAMIE
Where?
He leans down and lifts one of her feet a foot from the
other. He notices a large bruise on her leg. She brushes
her dress down.
JAMIE
You're acting like a crazy person.
LANDON
You're straddling the state line.
You're in two places at once.
She's thrilled at his solution to her wish.
He walks to
the shoulder of the road.
LANDON
Repeat after me.
Huh?
He does a cartwheel.
She laughs.
JAMIE
I can't.
LANDON
I'm gonna teach you.
A starry night with a bright moon. Glimmering silver
water. Jamie and Landon walk onto a dock. DISTANT
FIREWORKS BOOM.
(CONTINUED)
72.
CONTINUED:
JAMIE
It's places like this that make me
certain there's a God.
LANDON
(surprised)
You're sometimes not sure?
JAMIE
I'm sure.
Pretty sure.
They reach the end of the dock. She turns to face the
WIND. It blows her hair. She turns his face the same
way.
JAMIE
It's like the wind. I can't see
it but I feel it.
He closes his eyes.
Feeling the wind.
Opens them again,
rejecting the idea.
LANDON
We can measure wind.
JAMIE
Uncertainty makes you
uncomfortable.
LANDON
What do you actually know with
religion?
JAMIE
Wonder.
Beauty. Joy.
(beat, quieter)
Love.
She's embarrassed.
She tries to avoid implying anything.
JAMIE
My mother told me God is love, so
when you're feeling love, you're
feeling God.
(beat)
I think talking about these things
-- threatens their very beauty and
mystery.
Her tone is matter-of-fact, but Landon's got a serious and
tender look on his face. He touches her hair.

JAMIE

I don't understand...
LANDON
Maybe you're not supposed to.
He moves closer.
LANDON
I might kiss you.
She looks down.
Shy.
JAMIE
I might do it wrong.
LANDON
(tenderly)
Not possible.
He touches her neck, her cheek, her mouth. Then leans in
and kisses her. A tender, soft kiss. He pulls away.
They look at each other a moment.
LANDON
I love you, Jamie.
There, he put it out there, risked looking and feeling
foolish. Not the old Landon. Jamie looks away. Mixed
emotions. Happy and sad.
LANDON
(gently)
Now's when you say something.
JAMIE
(overwhelmed)
I can't.
(beat)
I can't -- explain.
She turns back to him, her eyes shining.
She touches his
face and they kiss again, deeply.
But after a few moments, she drops her chin onto his
shoulder. Smiling, glowing even, but slightly aloof,
staring at the water. He pulls away slightly to study her
face. He touches her cheek and brings her back from
wherever she's been.
JAMIE
You make me feel...
(CONTINUED)
74.
CONTINUED:
LANDON
(hopeful)
Loved?
JAMIE
(smiling)
That.
And less strange.
Tears run down her cheeks. Landon wipes them away with
his thumbs, attributing them to happiness.
Landon follows Jamie up the steps. The lights in the
living room are on. THROUGH the windows, they can see her
father taking down the Christmas tree.
JAMIE
Be very quiet.
He pulls her to him.
Kisses her.
The front door opens.
REV. SULLIVAN
(embarrassed)
Hello, Landon.
Landon and Jamie separate, but Landon keeps an arm over
her shoulder.
LANDON
Hey, Reverend.
Reverend Sullivan studies the two young people.
LANDON
(whispers to Jamie)
Happy New Year.
And he goes. Jamie walks by her father and into the
house. Not saying anything. He watches her. What has he
allowed?
Landon and Jamie head into school.
Landon nods to
Belinda, others. They glare back.
LANDON
(to Belinda and
others)
What's your damage?
75.
Landon leads Jamie up, round and round, to the top of the
tall steel tower.
76.
They exit the staircase to a small 360 degree overlook.
Jamie's amazed at the view.
JAMIE
How do you know this place?
LANDON
Before the divorce. My father
used to take me here. Fire
spotting was his summer job.
They look off to the curve of the horizon, where sea meets
sky.
LANDON
From here he proved to me the
earth isn't flat.
(beat)
On rainy days, we'd be above the
clouds.
JAMIE
What would you do up here?
LANDON
Look.
Talk.
Not talk.
He pulls a deck of cards from his jacket pocket. They sit
and he starts to shuffle. Not too well. Jamie takes the
deck. Shuffles like a card shark.
Jamie is already waiting when Landon's Yugo pulls up.
He
gets out, walks to her, they kiss.
LANDON
What'd you tell your father?
JAMIE
The truth.
I just left you out of
it.
She climbs up and over the wall.
He follows.
Jamie fits the pieces of her telescope together.
LANDON
When did you build this?
(CONTINUED)
77.
CONTINUED:
JAMIE
I was twelve.
Landon shakes his head, amazed.
JAMIE
It's not that complicated.
Landon doubts this.
JAMIE
It's an alt-azimuth design with
one parabolic mirror and one
secondary flat one.
LANDON
Where's the one you're building?
JAMIE
In my back yard.
(pause, embarrassed)
I lied before. It's hardly
started. But when it's done, it
will have twice the power of this
one --
LANDON
Wait, back up.
You lied?
JAMIE
Kinda.
Yeah.
He grins, loving her even more.
JAMIE
So what do you want to see?
LANDON
Mars.
JAMIE
Mars doesn't rise until 2:30
A.M. --
He opens his backpack.
Pulls out the contents.
LANDON
A Thermos of hot coffee.
A
blanket. Socks.
JAMIE
You planned this --
(CONTINUED)
78.
CONTINUED:
LANDON
Hoped for it.
Pause.
JAMIE
Are you trying to seduce me?
LANDON
No.
Why?
Are you seducible?
JAMIE
(firm, but smiling)
No.
LANDON
That's what I thought.
He reaches back into his backpack.
Pulls out a second
blanket.
LANDON
Ergo, a second blanket.
One for
me, one for you.
He hands her one.
She takes it, smiling, reassured.
JAMIE
Ergo?
LANDON
(slightly embarrassed)
What about your father?
JAMIE
I'm always home by midnight and
he's always asleep.
The old Pontiac slows.
79.
Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Three Amigos! on the marquee.
Landon and Jamie exit as Belinda and a new boyfriend buy
tickets. Clay and Eric and a crowd behind them.
LANDON
Hey, Belinda.
She takes her boyfriend's arm, turns away, snubbing him.
LANDON
Clay, Eric.
Eric says something inaudible and the whole crowd sniggers
and laughs. He's become Landon. Landon reddens, now
realizing for certain that he's become a Jamie Sullivan.
Landon and Jamie walk.
The theater in the b.g.
JAMIE
(re: his status)
From citizen high to citizen low.
LANDON
I don't care.
(CONTINUED)
86.
CONTINUED:
JAMIE
Care, but just don't let it get to
you. It gives them power.
LANDON
That what you do?
JAMIE
Yes.
I try to keep my power.
He's impressed with how she manages.
LANDON
One of your secrets.
JAMIE
(serious)
Yes, one of many.
He doesn't notice her tone.
Jamie gets out of the car.
Landon quickly follows.
LANDON
Jamie --
JAMIE
I'm sick.
LANDON
Then I'll take you home.
You'll
feel better tomorrow.
He tries to take her arm. She shakes off his hand, steps
back. Wanting to be heard and understood.
JAMIE
Landon. I'm sick -- with
leukemia.
Landon tries to say something.
Nothing comes out.
His
soul numb.
JAMIE
I found out last winter. I'm not
responding to treatment anymore.
His face crumples with pain and anguish.
LANDON
Why didn't you tell me?
JAMIE
The doctors said to do everything
the same as long as possible.
(pause)
I didn't want anyone being --
weird around me.
LANDON
Including me?!
(CONTINUED)
88.
CONTINUED:
JAMIE
Especially you.
(long beat)
God gives me an illness, then you.
A cruel joke.
She gets in the car. Slams her door shut.
He stands
there, not knowing what to do.
Landon pulls up in front of Jamie's house.
A long quiet
ride.
LANDON
I'm not letting you die.
Jamie just looks at him.
Feeling sorry for him -- what he
wants doesn't matter.
Moonless dark. Few cars. The YUGO RIPS down the road.
Landon opens a map over the steering wheel. Turns on the
dome light. Looks at the return address on an old letter.
Landon's Yugo winds through city streets.
Mansions. Big lawns. The Yugo slows as Landon leans
forward to read a street sign. His face is tear-streaked.
He flicks his headlights to bright, then low again.
The car turns left.
Large new colonial. Landon slams his car door and stands
in the street. Staring at his father's house. He heads
up a flagstone path for the front door.
Landon RINGS the resounding DING-DONG BELL, then bangs on
the heavy wood door. Grief-stricken.
LANDON
Dr. Carter!... Carter!... Dad!
Please!! I have to talk to you!!
Landon backs away from the house. Angrily kicks over a
decorative planter. Is halfway to his car when Dr. Carter
opens the door and comes out.
DR. CARTER
Landon!
Landon doesn't hear.
DR. CARTER
Landon!!
Landon turns around. Sees his father. Breaks down,
sobbing. His father goes to him. Hugs him, a big bear
hug.
LANDON
You have to save her!
DR. CARTER
Landon, who?
Is your mother all
right?
Lights pop upstairs.
LANDON
It's Jamie -- my girlfriend -- she
has cancer -- you have to come
look at her -- right now!
DR. CARTER
(calm, trying to
diffuse)
It's the middle of the night --
LANDON
I don't give a shit what time it
is!
Landon pulls away.
Angrier.
DR. CARTER
Landon, I'm a cardiologist, not an
oncologist --
(CONTINUED)
91.
CONTINUED:
LANDON
You're a doctor, aren't you?!!
He waves his father off, dismissing him.
DR. CARTER
Landon!
I'll look into it!!
But Landon hasn't heard. He's in his car. Dr. Carter
watches his son's car move away, regretful.
The Yugo parked in the driveway. The morning paper lying
on the grass. Landon paces in front of the front porch.
Incapable of ringing the bell, lacking the courage,
lacking the right words.
Upstairs, the curtains move.
Landon's still in bed. Facing the wall.
Cynthia KNOCKS.
Enters with a plate of food.
CYNTHIA
I brought some dinner.
No response.
She leaves the tray and goes.
Landon is still in bed. Cynthia enters.
Pulls back the
curtains. Yanks up the shades.
CYNTHIA
I don't care if you don't leave
the house. But you have to get
out of bed.
Before Landon can ring the bell, the front door opens.
The Reverend. Landon runs past him into the house.
LANDON
Where's Jamie?!
REV. SULLIVAN
At school.
Where you should be.
Oh.
Jamie and Landon are looking at stars.
A long quiet
moment.
LANDON
What are you thinking?
JAMIE
(honest)
That I want you to take me home.
LANDON
Now?
We just --
JAMIE
I don't want to come here anymore.
She begins taking the telescope apart.
Depressed.
Jamie looks at the high fence, weary, then reaches into a
pocket for a key. Unlocks the gate. Swings the gate
open. Landon's astonished.
LANDON
You have a key?
JAMIE
Yeah.
I've just never needed it.
(pause)
Will you talk to my father?
LANDON
I've talked to your father.
JAMIE
That's what I mean.
Their eyes meet.
Her look is serious.
Reverend Sullivan is up a ladder. Cleaning a gutter.
Landon stands below, a few feet away, gathering his nerve.
He walks over.
ON LADDER
The Reverend is busy ignoring Landon standing below.
A
long beat, then:
(CONTINUED)
99.
CONTINUED:
LANDON
(calling up)
Sir. Being ignored is beginning
to feel preferable to being
noticed.
The Reverend looks down.
LANDON
I'll be honest. I don't know if I
can pray, but I can do just about
anything else.
Neither Landon nor the Reverend see Jamie come out of the
house and walk over.
ON GROUND
Landon shields his eyes with a hand to see the Reverend
better.
LANDON
Whatever you need. Whatever Jamie
needs. I'm here.
(beat)
I could start by driving her to
school --
JAMIE
I'm not going back to school.
Landon and her father both turn to her.
Pale, wane.
They
understand what she is saying.
JAMIE
You can tell anyone you want.
I
don't care.
She goes into the house. Landon and Reverend Sullivan
look at each other, then away, uncomfortable. That didn't
sound like her.
Landon's sitting on his childhood tree swing, twisting
side to side. Pensive. His mother comes out of the
house.
(CONTINUED)
102.
CONTINUED:
LANDON
Time seems to be slowing down and
speeding up at the same time.
She reaches to put a hand on his shoulder.
He lets her.
The rear gate is open. A caretaker waits while Landon
carries pieces of the older telescope to his car. A tall
pile of parts is already at his car.
Eric and Clay drive up in Eric's pickup.
Gravel flying.
MUSIC BLASTING.
Landon freezes, not sure what to expect.
The truck makes a circle around Landon, then stops. The
MUSIC QUIETS. Eric and Clay jump down. A long tense
moment, then:
ERIC
Hey.
LANDON
Hey.
Without a word, Clay walks to the Yugo, lifts the heaviest
telescope part, and carries it to the bed of the pickup.
Eric follows suit.
Landon studies the pieces of the smaller telescope and how
they fit together. They are like a map for how to build
the bigger one.
Landon unloads an impossibly large round cardboard
concrete form-tube from his car. Carries it around the
house toward the back yard.
103.
The sky is pink. A squirrel runs along a telephone wire.
The Yugo is the only car in the visitor lot.
On the marquee on the front lawn: "WELCOME HALEY'S
COMET." The Yugo parks in the b.g.
Landon quietly opens the back door to the kitchen.
HIS POV
Cynthia sits at the table with Dr. Carter, his father.
CYNTHIA
Sit with us a minute.
The back porch light comes on. Reverend Sullivan steps
out onto the back porch. Landon looks up.
(CONTINUED)
114.
CONTINUED:
LANDON
(flushes, almost
manic)
I have to finish it tonight.
Without a word, the Reverend turns around and goes back
inside. Leaving the porch light on. Landon goes back to
work.
Reverend Sullivan comes out. Dressed. He carries two
mugs of coffee and a brightly burning kerosene camp
lantern. Peace offerings.
He walks over, sets down the lantern, hands Landon a mug.
Ready to work.
LANDON
I've almost finished the rocker.
Did she order mirrors?
REV. SULLIVAN
In there.
As they walk to the garage.
REV. SULLIVAN
You have materials for the side
bearings?
LANDON
I'm using an old phonographic
turntable.
REV. SULLIVAN
For the focuser?
LANDON
A chrome-plated brass pipe from a
drain line.
The Reverend nods, impressed.
He yanks the garage door
up. Goes in.
LANDON
You know about this stuff?
REV. SULLIVAN
I helped Jamie with the first one.
(CONTINUED)
115.
CONTINUED:
LANDON
(surprised)
I thought she built it herself.
REV. SULLIVAN
She did. But hardly anyone does
anything truly alone.
The Reverend carries out a large cardboard postal package.
Landon takes it as the Reverend lowers the garage door.
LANDON
(serious)
I need to do this alone.
Reverend Sullivan searches Landon's face for a long
moment, understanding, then turns and heads for the back
door.
Landon stands in the doorway. The Reverend is wiping his
glasses, his face, maybe of tears. He sees Landon.
REV. SULLIVAN
You finish?
LANDON
A few minutes ago. I have to ask
you something.
Long pause.
REV. SULLIVAN
When I was seventeen, I was sent
up for a year for stealing a car.
(beat)
Sometimes I still feel that boy
inside me and I don't like him.
(beat)
But I like you.
The Reverend stands, offers Landon his hand.
Landon takes
it. The two men shake. Allies now.
Landon carries Jamie out a large attic window. The
finished large telescope is set up. Pointing at the sky.
She's in her nightgown, wrapped in a blanket.
JAMIE
(grateful, touching
it)
It's beautiful... Thank you.
But she looks at the lights of the house and streets
around them.
JAMIE
I don't know what we'll be able to
see... Help me stand.
He checks his watch.
LANDON
Wait a sec.
As she turns to him, questioning, the neighborhood
suddenly darkens as the street lamps and lights in every
nearby house are switched off.
Neighbors step outside.
Hold up binoculars.
Members of the Star Club and other students look through
traditional telescopes.
117.
Jamie hugs Landon in gratitude.
LANDON
We have five minutes.
Jamie, tears streaming, braces herself against Landon and
she peers into the telescope eyepiece. She pulls back,
wipes her eyes, then looks again. She swings the
telescope into the correct position.
HER POV THROUGH TELESCOPE
Haley's Comet, its icy nucleus issuing the jets and
streamers of gas, dust, and debris that form the comet's
hazy head and long tail.
JAMIE (O.S.)
The comet of the century...
BACK TO SCENE
She steps back so he can see. He looks quickly, then
moves aside so she can keep looking. She's completely
engrossed. A long, quiet moment, then:
LANDON
You love me?
She leans away from the eyepiece and looks at him -- yes.
LANDON
Will you do something for me?
JAMIE
Landon.
I can't even do for
myself.
LANDON
But if you could, you would?
JAMIE
Yes.
His throat tightens with nervousness, with hope, fear,
sadness, and love.
LANDON
Will you marry me?
HER FACE
Illness, happiness, disbelief.
118.
A sea of pink, purple, and white blossoms.
Dogwoods,
wisteria, azaleas, and roses blooming.
Landon walks alone.
His hair and clothing tousled by a
steady gentle wind.
ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
She made me a believer. In love.
In life. In the journey that
never ends...
Landon stops.
Faces the wind.
Lets the air swirl over
him.
(CONTINUED)
122.
CONTINUED:
ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
... And in the mystery of all
things you can't see but feel
everywhere around you...
He closes his eyes.
She's there...
FADE OUT.
