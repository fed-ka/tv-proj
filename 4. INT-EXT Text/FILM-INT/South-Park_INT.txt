We are in a young boy's bedroom, just as his alarm clock goes
off. BRRRRRTTT!!!
RADIO ANNOUNCER
Good morning South Park! It's five-thirty
a.m. on Sunday!! Time to feed the horses
and water the cows!!
From the back, we see the blond haired kid sit up from his
bed. He stretches, and then walks over to his closet.
We still only see the boy from the back as he reaches in his
closet and pulls out an orange coat.
The kid puts his coat on, then turns to camera and pulls the
hood shut, so that we never get a good look at his face.
MOTHER (O.S.)
KENNY! YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE FOR CHURCH!!!
This boy's name is KENNY, and under his orange coat, we have
no idea what he looks like, except for his European nose and
hazel eyes.
KENNY
Mph rmph rm!
Kenny walks through his small, dirty house and into the
kitchen, where his MOTHER, FATHER and OLDER BROTHER are
sitting at the humble table.
KENNY'S MOTHER
Sit down, you can share some of your
brother's waffle.
The doorbell rings. Kenny walks over to the door.
CLOSE UP on a bag that reads 'CHEESY POOFS'. A hand reaches
into the bag, pulls out a wad of orange crunchies and raises
them --
BOOM UP to reveal the fat face of eight year old ERIC CARTMAN
who chows down on the chips.
Now we see that fat little Eric is sitting on his couch,
eating Cheesy Poofs and watching television.
The doorbell rings. Cartman doesn't move a muscle.
CARTMAN
MOM! SOMEBODY'S AT THE DOOR!
CARTMAN'S MOTHER enters. She is extremely June Cleaveresque
(except that she's a hermaphrodite crack whore). She returns
with Stan, Kyle and Kenny.
CARTMAN'S MOTHER
Look, Eric it's your little friends.
CARTMAN
What the hell are you guys doing here?
IKE
Baba turtre bad!
Kyle holds up the newspaper ad.
CARTMAN
Ooh!
The boys are all sitting in the front row. Cartman has a huge
tub of popcorn, all kinds of candy, and a large drink.
IKE
Purpre mama!
KYLE
Be quiet, Ike! The movie's starting!
ANGLE - MOVIE SCREEN
A TITLE reads 'Terrance and Phillip - Asses of Fire'
BOYS
HOORAY!!!
On the screen, we come across PHILLIP, a very handsome
Canadian star with a great body.
PHILLIP
Say Terrance, what did the Spanish Priest
say to the Uranian gynecologist?
PAN OVER to TERRANCE, who is also Canadian, and equally
handsome in a more rugged way.
TERRANCE
I don't know, Phillip, what?
Phillip rips a big fart. Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.
ANGLE - BOYS
Laughing their asses off.
KYLE
That was sweet!
STAN
Where do they come up with this stuff?!
CARTMAN
How come Terrance and Phillip are so
weird looking?
KYLE
Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like
Ike!
CARTMAN
Oh.
IKE
Poo bada!
ANGLE - SCREEN
TERRANCE
You're such a pigfucker, Phillip!
PHILLIP
What?! Why would you call me a
pigfucker?!
TERRANCE
Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck
pigs.
PHILLIP
Oh yeah!
Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.
ANGLE - BOYS
KYLE
Woa, dude! Did they say what I think they
said?
ANGLE - SCREEN
Terrance pulls out a white envelope.
TERRANCE
Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, I
just got a letter!
PHILLIP
A letter from who, you shit sucking cock
master?
TRACK IN on the boys' wide eyed faces as the dialogue from
the film enters their innocent ears.
TERRANCE
It's from your mother.
PHILLIP
My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it
say?
TERRANCE
It says 'Dear Terrance, please don't ever
tell my son that I licked your hairy
balls.'
Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.
PHILLIP
Oh, you fucking ball whore!
The boys don't laugh, they just smile widely, they seem busy
taking it all in.
CARTMAN
Wow... Ball whore...
TERRANCE
Listen, you donkey raping shit eater-
KYLE
(To himself)
Donkey raping shit eater.
IKE
Doky maping she deeder!!!
TERRANCE
You'd fuck your uncle!
PHILLIP
YOU'D fuck your uncle!
TERRANCE
(Singing)
Shut your fucking face,
Unclefucka!!
You're an asslicking, Ball sucking
Unclefucka!!
You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true
Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-
PHILLIP
SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE!!
UNCLEFUCKA!!!
YOU'RE the one that fucked your
Uncle, UNCLEFUCKA!!!
You don't eat, or sleep or mow the
lawn
You just fuck your Uncle all day

TERRANCE & PHILLIP
Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!
You butt licking bastard
Unclefucka!
TERRANCE
You're an Unclefucka I must say!
PHILLIP
You fucked YOUR Uncle yesterday!
TERRANCE & PHILLIP
Unclefucka!
That's YOUUUUUUU!!!!!
The song ends and the boys erupt into applause.
The kids of South Park are all in their seats, singing.
KIDS
Shut your fucking face,
Unclefucka!!
You're a shitsucking, cocksucking
Unclefucka!!
The door opens, and suddenly the kids quiet down.
CLOSE-UP on a hand puppet with a large red hat. It seems to
be speaking.
MR. HAT
Okay, children, let's take our seats.
As the voice continues, we PULL BACK to reveal that the
puppet is on the right hand of MR. GARRISON, a forty-six year
old teacher who is in denial about his homosexuality.
MR. GARRISON (AS MR. HAT)
We have a lot to learn and precious
little time.
Garrison looks over the class and notices that every single
one of them is wearing a Terrance and Phillip T-shirt,
except, of course, for Wendy.
MR. GARRISON
Why is everyone wearing T-shirts of
Sigfried and Roy?
KYLE
It's not Sigried and Roy, Mr. Garrison,
it's Terrance and Phillip.
KIDS
TERRANCE AND PHILLIP!!
Stan looks over at Wendy. She just rolls her eyes. Stan
sulks.
MR. GARRISON
Well, anyway... Today children, our
friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all
about the environment.
MR. GARRISON (AS MR. HAT)
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The
environment is what surrounds us. It is
what we live and breathe.
CARTMAN
I hate the environment.
KYLE
Dude, how can you hate the environment?
CARTMAN
'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and
fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.
The kids all GASP!
MR. GARRISON
Eric! Did you just say the "F" word?
CARTMAN
Fragile?
KYLE
No, he's talking about fuck, dude. You
can't say fuck in front of Mr. Garrison.
MR. GARRISON
Kyle!
CARTMAN
Why the fuck not?
MR. GARRISON
Eric!
STAN
Dude, you just said fuck again.
MR. GARRISON
Stanly!
KENNY
Mph.
MR. GARRISON
Kenny!
CARTMAN
That's bullshit! If Terrance and Phillip
can say something, I should be able to
say it too!
BEBE
Wow, Cartman's cool!
CLYDE
He's like Terrance and Phillip!
Cartman gloats proudly.
CARTMAN
Fuckin' a right.
MR. GARRISON
How would you like to go to the
principal's office?
CARTMAN
How would you like to gargle rat jiz?
Mr. Garrison is in shock.
MR. GARRISON
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!
CARTMAN
I said -
Cartman takes out a megaphone, hits the switch and puts it
to his mouth. It feeds back horribly.
CARTMAN
(Through megaphone)
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO GARGLE RAT JIZ?!
Garrison is floored.
KYLE
Oh, dude we are fucked now.
The boys are seated in front of the Principal's desk.
STAN
Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw
the Terrance and Phillip movie!
KYLE
Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!
Just then, the Principal walks in. She is PRINCIPAL VICTORIA,
a frizzy haired woman of about forty.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
I am VERY disappointed in you boys!
You should be ASHAMED of yourselves! I've
already called in your parents, but first
I want you to THINK about what you've
done.
CARTMAN
Principal Victoria, can I ask a question?
PRINCPAL VICTORIA
What?
CARTMAN
What's the big fucking deal?
STAN
Yeah.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
AGH!! I want to know where you heard
these horrific obscenities!
The boys look at each other.
STAN
Nowhere.
KYLE
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few
times before...
STAN
Yeah!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Boys, I seriously doubt that Mr. Garrison
ever said-
(Reading)
'Eat penguin shit you cum sucking ass
spelunker' in school!
The boys all laugh.
But then the door opens and in walks Stan's mother, Kyle's
mother, Cartman's mother and Kenny's mother.
STAN
Oh, oh...
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Thank you all for coming on such short
notice. As you can see, your boys are all
being disciplined.
STAN'S MOTHER
This just isn't like you, Stanley!
Stan looks down at the floor.
KYLE'S MOTHER
What did my son say, Principal Victoria?
Did he say the S word?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
No, it was worse than that...
KYLE'S MOTHER
(Gasping)
The F word?!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
No, worse. Here's a short list of the
things they've been saying.
The mothers look over the sheet of paper. Immediately, their
eyes bulge.
STAN'S MOTHER
Oh dear God...
KYLE'S MOTHER
What is 'fisting'?
CARTMAN'S MOTHER
That's when the fist is inserted into the
anus or vagina for sexual pleasure.
The two moms stare at Ms. Cartman.
CARTMAN'S MOTHER
What?
KYLE'S MOTHER
(To Kyle)
Young man, you will tell Peincipal
Victoria THIS INSTANT where you heard all
these horrible phrases!
KYLE
I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath,
and swore ourselves to secrecy!
CARTMAN
It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!
STAN
Dude!
CARTMAN
What? Fuck you guys, I wanna get out of
here.
KYLE'S MOTHER
Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt!
Not again!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
What is Terrance and Phillip?
KYLE'S MOTHER
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY
untalented, unfunny actors from Canada.
Their TV show is filled with toilet humor
and bad language and is just complete
garbage.
Now it appears they have a
movie and I'm positive it's not suitable
for children!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Well, it looks like I'll have to send a
warning letter out to parents. I have to
put a stop to this before MORE children
see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
CARTMAN
Everybody's already fucking seen it.
MS. CARTMAN
Eric!
CARTMAN
I'm sorry! I can't help it!! That movie
has warped my fragile little mind.
KYLE'S MOTHER
Alright, boys, that's enough. Get out and
let us adults speak.
The boys get up and walk out. Kyle's mother slams the door
behind them.
KYLE'S MOTHER
We must take action on this immediately.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give
detention to those boys.
KYLE'S MOTHER
Forgive me for saying so, Principal
Victoria, but your methods are too...
Shall we say... soft?
As head of the
PTA, I am exercising my right under
article 42 of the PTA code.
A look of shock comes over the principal's face.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Article 42!
You don't mean-?!
KYLE'S MOTHER
Yes Principal Victoria.
The PTA is
impeaching you.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
But I-
KYLE'S MOTHER
You are officially relieved of your
duties as principal of this school!
Kyle's mother sits herself down at Principal Victoria's desk.
KYLE'S MOTHER
Get out of that chair! The PTA is in
charge now!
The other school kids are in line for lunch.
Just then, the Kyle's mother's voice comes blaring through
the P.A.
KYLE'S MOTHER
Attention students. We are now enforcing
a new dress code at South Park
Elementary. Terrance and Phillip shirts
are NO LONGER ALLOWED IN SCHOOL. Anyone
wearing a Terrance and Phillip shirt is
to be SENT HOME IMMEDIATELY.
The kids look down. They're all wearing Terrance and Phillip
shirts.
KIDS
HOOORAY!!!
The kids all cheer and run out the door. Leaving the
cafeteria absolutely empty... Except for Wendy.
WENDY
Hello?
Wendy's hello echoes throughout the entire building.
A dapper NEWS ANCHOR sits behind a news desk.
NEWS ANCHOR
All over America, kids are flocking to
the R rated film, 'Terrance and Phillip
Asses of Fire'. Here with a special
report, is a quadriplegic midget in a
bikini.
A QUADRIPLEGIC MIDGET IN A BIKINI stands in front of the
camera with a microphone.
Q. MIDGET W/BIKINI
Thanks, Tom. It appears that the effects
of the Canadian Comedy are far reaching
indeed. All over America, children seem
to be influenced.
A TEACHER is on stage with a young spelling bee contestant.
TEACHER
Alright, this is for the silver medal.
Spell 'Forensics'.
KID
Oh, fuck that, why should I fucking have
to spell forensics?
All the kids cheer.
KID
Here you go; S-U-C-K-M-Y-A-S-S,
FORENSICS.
CUT TO:
The news anchor shakes his head in disgust.
NEWS ANCHOR
Thanks, midget. Shocking report.
The
controversy surrounding the Terrance and
Phillip movie began in the small mountain
town of South Park, Colorado where the
local PTA banned the movie.
With us
tonight is the head of the South Park
PTA, Sheila Brofloski-
A screen appears with Kyle's mother, looking very pissed. The
TITLE below her reads 'Outraged Mother'.
NEWS ANCHOR
Ms. Brovlofski, how are these kids seeing
this film? Is bad parenting to blame? Or
is it Canada?
KYLE'S MOTHER
Canada!
NEWS ANCHOR
Alright. Here with a counterpoint is the
Canadian Minister of Movies.
A split screen appears, Kyle's mother on one side, and a
goofy looking Canadian slides into the other.
NEWS ANCHOR
Thank you, Minister, for joining us.
CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
Thanks for having me, buddy.
NEWS ANCHOR
Minister, parents all over America are
concerned about your country's
entertainment. Your thoughts?
CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
Well, the film is R rated, and it's not
intended for children-
KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh but OF COURSE children are going to
see it!!
CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The
fact is that we Canadians are quite
surprised by your outrage-
KYLE'S MOTHER
YOU JUST DON'T CARE!
CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The
United States has graphic images of
violence on television all the time, what
is that one show? COPS? And car crashes
caught on tape? We can't believe that a
movie with some foul language and fart
jokes would piss you off so much.
KYLE'S MOTHER
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ...
... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.
NEWS ANCHOR
But minister, it isn't like this film is
the first troublesome thing to come out
of Canada. Let us not forget Brian Adams
a few decades ago.
The Minister thinks.
CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
What?
KYLE'S MOTHER
The Canadians are just mad that we
mothers here in South Park have the
chutzpah to stand up to them!
Like it or
not, Mr. Canadian Minister, OUR children
are now safe from your Canadian smut!
The boys are in the front row, this time with Wendy, watching
the Terrance and Phillip movie.
TERRANCE
Well, Terrance I hope you learned
something from this whole experience.
PHILLIP
I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a
boner biting dick fart fuck face!
The boys laugh merrily. Wendy just looks bored.
TERRANCE
Say Phillip, want to see the Northern
Lights?
PHILLIP
You bet, Terrance!
Terrance pulls out a match, lights it, then farts.
The flame burns Terrance to a blackened mass.
PHILLIP
HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by
lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
TERRANCE
(Just a skull)
I sure did, Phillip!!
The boys laugh hysterically.
STAN
Did you see that, Wendy?
WENDY
Yup.
DOCTORS and NURSES are pushing Kenny into the operating room
ER style.
Everything is quick and chaotic. Shouts fill the hallway.
NURSE
CBC chem kit STAT!!
DOCTOR GAUCHE
LOAD THAT I.V. WITH 70CCS OF SODIUM
PENTOTHAL!!
It's mid-operation.
DOCTOR GAUCHE
Siphon the fluid off his brain!! Vacuum!
Another nurse hands him a sucker tube.
He immediately shoves
into Kenny's skull.
It starts to slurp and burble.
DOCTOR GAUCHE
Try to untangle his trachea and
esophagus!
NURSE
Right!
While Doctor Gauche wrestles with Kenny's lungs and torso,
the nurse reaches into Kenny's mouth and pulls both his
windpipe and esophagus out of his mouth, turning them inside
out in the process.
Off to the side, Stan, Cartman and Kyle look on as the doctor
and nurses tangle themselves in knots with Kenny's innards.
DOCTOR GAUCHE
No! THAT DOESN'T GO THERE!!
NURSE
Watch his liver!!!
Kenny's liver POPS out of his torso and slides across the
floor.
ASSISTANT
I'll get it!!!
DOCTOR GAUCHE
We have precious little time left people!
We're going to lose him soon!!
Suddenly, there is a long, BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP.
NURSE
Doctor, his heart's stopped!
DOCTOR GAUCHE
Crack him.
Let's get it out of there!!!
Doctor Gauche lifts Kenny's heart out of his body.
DOCTOR GAUCHE
We need to zap this, quick!
And runs it to the microwave.
He opens the door.
DOCTOR GAUCHE
Who's making a potato?
DOCTOR 2
My bad, sir.
I missed lunch.
DOCTOR GAUCHE
Damn it! I am NOT going to lose this
kid!!!!!!
Fade up from black.
We're close on Kenny's face.
His little
eyes start to open.
Doctor Gauche leans over him Kenny.
Stan and Kyle are
there.
DOCTOR GAUCHE
Kenny.
Kenny, can you hear me?
Kenny stirs.
KENNY
(Weakly)
Mph rmph rm...
DOCTOR GAUCHE
How are you feeling, son?
KENNY
mph.... rmph....
DOCTOR GAUCHE
Great... Son, I have some bad news.
We
accidentally replaced your heart with a
baked potato.
You have about seven
seconds to live.
KENNY
Mrm?!
Just then, Kenny's baked potato heart explodes, splattering
gore all over the inside of the recovery room and on the
outside of Dr. Gauche, Stan and Kyle.
STAN
Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny!
KYLE
You bastards!!
DOCTOR GAUCHE
Damn it!
It never gets any easier!
Anybody get the score of that Broncos
game?
Kyle's mother is waiting with the rest of the parents.
The nurse walks up to Kenny's parents with a sad expression.
NURSE
I'm sorry...
Kenny's mother breaks down.
KENNY'S MOTHER
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
KENNY'S DAD
You bastards!
KYLE'S MOTHER
I knew this would happen! Those bastard
Canadians have now killed a child! Can't
people see the damage that film is
doing?!
STAN'S MOTHER
He was killed doing something he saw in
the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip...
THEY killed Kenny.
CARTMAN'S MOTHER
You bastards.
KYLE'S MOTHER
This is it! The time for action is NOW!!
(Singing)
Something must be done!
This is like a spreading rash!
They're pulling out our children's
brains
and filling them with trash!
Can't you see what this is leading
to?
A world of smut and sex and poo!
I believe the good fight has begun!
Something must be done!
Everyone gathers around Kyle's mother.
STAN'S MOTHER
I agree!
(Singing)
Something must be done!
We must take action fast!
My child used to say 'please and
thank you'
Now he says suck my ass!
CARTMAN'S MOTHER
And my boy was the sweetest boy the
world had ever known!
until those damn Canadians brought
that filth into our home!
I agree that there is now a battle
to be won!
We can't just stand here singing!
Something must be done!
KENNY'S MOTHER
But what are we going to do against the
media machine? It's so big and powerful!
KYLE'S MOTHER
Right! And we can use that same media
machine to exploit OUR cause!
We've got
to let the whole world know what the
Canadians did to your son!
PARENTS
Yeah!!
KYLE'S MOTHER
COME ON!
The parents all head out the door-
The boys gather around Kenny's lifeless body.
CARTMAN
(Dazed)
I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him
a hundred dollars!
KYLE
Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.
CARTMAN
No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I
don't have to pay him!
KYLE
Oh.
The boys walk out, leaving Kenny's corpse behind. We can
still hear the boys voices as they exit.
KYLE (O.S.)
I can't believe he's dead.
CARTMAN (O.S.)
Yeah, I'm having total deja vu right now.
Like this has all happened before...
After they leave, PUSH IN to Kenny's dead body, which is
left all alone on the operating table.
The camera continues to zoom in to Kenny's face...
ZOOM IN on Kenny's dead face. We pass into his thoughs...
FLASH!!
The boys are sitting on Cartman's couch watching TV.
ANGLE - TELEVISION - THE CONAN O'BRIAN SHOW
Conan comes back from a commercial break. Sitting next to
him, is Ms. Brooke Shields.
CONAN O'BRIAN
Our next guests have the number one movie
in the world right now, please welcome
Terrance and Phillip!
A few cheers as Terrance and Phillip walk out on stage. A few
boos as well, and we see that the South Park mothers are in
the audience holding 'Anti-Terrance and Phillip' signs.
Terrance and Phillip walk out and sit next to Brooke Shields.
PHILLIP
Hello, Conan!
TERRANCE
Hello, Brooke Shields!
CONAN
It's nice to have you here in America.
PHILLIP
Yeah, well, you being a Canadian and all,
we thought what the hell!
CONAN O'BRIAN
So guys... I understand you have a comedy
routine worked out for us.
PHILLIP
We sure do, Conan. And here it is. Excuse
me, Terrance.
TERRANCE
Yes, Phillip?
Phillip rips a fart that launches Terrance backwards and into
the band.
They both laugh wildly.
PHILLIP
Gotcha!
Terrance and Phillip laugh. Nobody in the audience laughs.
ANGLE - BOYS
They laugh merrily.
RESUME - THE CONAN O'BRIAN SHOW
TERRANCE
Good one, Phillip!
Cheers.
PHILLIP
Cheers, Terrance!
Terrance extricates himself from the band. Conan is growing
nervous. He looks out into the audience...
Kyle's mother is sitting there, looking angry. Conan makes
eye contact with her, and then nods his head. Kyle's mother
nods back.
CONAN O'BRIAN
(Nervous)
So, guys, I need to ask you a serious
question...
PHILLIP
I just farted Terrance back into the
stone age!
They both laugh hard.
Brooke Shields waits a beat, then belts out a fake laugh.
BROOKE SHIELDS
I farted once on the set of Blue Lagoon!
TERRANCE
Nobody cares, Brooke Shields!
CONAN O'BRIAN
Terrance and Phillip... Whose idea was
it, to have a person lighting a fart on
fire in your movie? Who is responsible
for that?
Terrance and Phillip exhange glances.
TERRANCE
Phillip, I think our friend Conan has
been working too hard.
CONAN O'BRIAN
Say it! It was YOUR idea to have someone
light a fart on fire in your movie!
PHILLIP/TERRANCE
(Together)
It was our idea to have someone light a
fart on fire in your movie.
ANGLE ON THE AUDIENCE
Kyle's mother is among them, listening to all this.
KYLE'S MOTHER
(Into her lapel)
That's it!
Move, move, move!
ANGLE ON TERRANCE AND PHILLIP
A battalion of Army guys appear, seize Terrance and Phillip
and arrest everyone in their group.
KYLE'S MOTHER
Terrance and Phillip, you are under
arrest for working in America without the
proper documents! WE GOT YOU!
ANGLE - BOYS
KYLE
Dude, what the hell is going on?
RESUME - THE CONAN O'BRIAN SHOW
TERRANCE
Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed
by The Conan O'Brian Show!!
PHILLIP
This little scrotum sucker willfully
deceived us!
(Pointing to Conan)
You are a bad man!
TERRANCE
And you call yourself a Canadian!
(To Phillip)
I told you we should of done Leno!
Conan O'Brian turns away, ashamed.
KYLE'S MOTHER
Don't listen to them, Mr. O'Brian.
They're master manipulators. You did a
good job.
TERRANCE
You loved our movie, Conan!
We watched
it together.
You... You laughed!
Conan grabs his head.
CONAN O'BRIAN
What have I done?!!!
Conan grabs a gun and blows his head off, dousing Brooke
Shields with blood.
BROOKE SHIELDS
AGAHGAHGGH!!!! Mondays at eight
AAAGHGH!!!!
Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily. Kyle's mother cradles
Conan's lifeless body.
KYLE'S MOTHER
You see what your filth has caused?
TERRANCE
US?! This is your mess, outraged mother!!
The boys are sitting on the couch in absolute shock.
STAN
Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and
Phillip!
KYLE
Our moms suck!
CARTMAN
This could mean... No more Terrance and
Phillip - EVER!
Lots of foreigners with their silly foreign outfits sit at
their stupid microphones with their ridiculous translation
headsets -- in the general assembly hall.
The Canadian
Ambassador stands before them.
CANADIAN AMBASSADOR
As The Canadian Ambassador, I hereby
condemn the actions taken by America in
apprehending Terrance and Phillip!
A MURMUR goes through the crowd.
CANADIAN AMBASSADOR
We demand their release IMMEDIATELY!! As
you can see from this graph, the entire
economy of Canada relies on Terrance and
Phillip! Without them we are doomed to
recession!
The United Nations head bangs his gavel.
Now Kyle's mother stands up. She is with a group of mothers
all wearing M.A.C T-shirts.
KYLE'S MOTHER
If I may?
Everyone looks at Kyle's mother.
KYLE'S MOTHER
As president and founder of M.A.C., I
would like to state-
UNITED NATIONS HEAD
Excuse me, M.A.C.?
KYLE'S MOTHER
Yes, Mothers Against Canada.
UNITED NATIONS HEAD
Kay.
KYLE'S MOTHER
I would like to state that Canada must
learn to stop infiltrating our country
with its graphic art!
Cheers from the Americans.
CANADIAN AMBASSADOR
Last time I checked America was a free
country!
KYLE'S MOTHER
Look at this!
Kyle's mother pulls Kenny's mother up by the head.
KYLE'S MOTHER
This woman's child was KILLED by your
country's humor! Look how upset she is!
Kenny's mom looks fine.
CANADIAN AMBASSADOR
We will continue to sell Terrance and
Phillip videos to anyone retarded enough
to buy it!!
KYLE'S MOTHER
Then you leave me no choice... I call for
an EMBARGO on ALL Canadian Imports!!!
More cheers from the Americans. The Canadians look worried.
The boys are in the check out line at Bob's supermarket.
CARTMAN
What the hell do you mean I can't get
Cheesy Poofs?!
BOB
Sorry, kid. Cheesy Poofs are a Canadian
export. We can't carry them any more.
KYLE
Who the hell made up that law?!
CARTMAN
You can't do this!! Have you ever HAD
Cheesy Poofs? They're a taste sensation
with a delightful cheddar crunch.
BOB
There's nothing I can do. I can still
sell you Cheese-o's.
CARTMAN
FUCK Cheese-os and FUCK you!
Cartman storms out. The boys follow him.
The boys walk into Cartman's house. Cartman slams the door
behind him. The boys all walk toward the living room.
CARTMAN
Come on, you guys... We have to THINK!
STAN
About what?
CARTMAN
About Cheesy Poofs, dumbass! This
whole thing has gone too far!
KYLE
I don't really think you need Cheesy-
Poofs, tubby-
But the boys come to an abrupt halt when they reach the
living room and see that all four mothers are waiting for
them, silently.
Everyone just sits there for a second. The lighting on Kyle's
mother's face looks almost evil.
KYLE'S MOTHER
Boys, we have to have a difficult
discussion.
KYLE
We already know what you did. We saw it
on television.
STAN
Yeah, how come you arrested Terrance and
Phillip?
STAN'S MOTHER
Stanly, you're too young to understand
what's good for you. That's why we
mothers have taken charge.
KYLE
But they fucking didn't do anything
wrong!
CARTMAN
Yeah!
And what rim job expert went and
outlawed Cheesy Poofs!?
The mothers all gasp in horror.
KYLE'S MOTHER
What was that word, young man!?
CARTMAN'S MOTHER
Oh, he said rim job.
It's when someone
licks your ass for-
KYLE'S MOTHER
I know what it is!
CARTMAN
(To his mother)
Lick someone's ass?!
KYLE'S MOTHER
The Terrance and Phillip movie has
obviously done irreparable damage to
their brains.
We have to put them in
rehab right away.
KYLE
What's that?
KYLE'S MOTHER
You boys need help.
There are rehab
centers that specialize in treating
people with chronic addictions to bad
language.
STAN'S MOTHER
There are?
Kyle's mother thinks for a second.
KYLE'S MOTHER
Well no, I guess not...
But we will
establish the first of its kind right
here in South Park.
All the children in
town will have to attend and receive
treatment from the school counselor Mr.
Mackey!
Ooh I just love when I get these
sorts of ideas!
CARTMAN
Why?
So you can fuck up our life some
more?
CARTMAN'S MOTHER
Eric!
Don't talk to Ms. Brovlofski that
way!
CARTMAN
But mom!
I'm not fucking addicted to
fucking bad language!
I don't have a
fucking problem!
Kenny walks through the black void of hell. A trippy, single
shaft of light seems to follow him wherever he goes.
KENNY
Mphrmo?
No answer... No nothing...
Kenny continues on, flames shoot up randomly from the ground
scaring the shit out of him.
KENNY
MPHR!! MMLY MMT!
Suddenly, Kenny hears a CLAWING NOISE. It gets louder and
louder. Kenny starts to run faster and faster. Now the
clawing is RIGHT BEHIND HIM! Kenny spins around. He is face
to face with SATAN!
Satan looks down at Kenny and shoots flames out his nose.
Kenny's eyes bulge open.
KENNY
MMMMMPHPHPHPHP!!!!!
SATAN
Fallen one... We have such sights to show
you!
Kenny shakes. Satan turns to a whispy form and flashes across
the room like a serpent, in a millisecond he is right up in
Kenny's face.
SATAN
I am Satan. I am your God, now.
KENNY
MPH RM!!!
Kenny tries to run away, but Satan again changes form, flies
across the room and cuts Kenny off.
SATAN
Come with me. I will show you what
delightful pain awaits.
Two black DEMONS grab Kenny by the arms and start to lead him
away.
KENNY
MMMMMPHPHP!!!!
Just then, SADDAM HUSSEIN show up next to Satan.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell,
kid! Relax! Take a load off!!
SATAN
You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't
you?!
Kenny's eyes grow wide.
KENNY
MMMPPH!!!
The kids are sitting in chairs in a circle.
There are anti-
drug signs on the walls: "Crack is Whack"; "Get High on
Pottery"; and, "I Go From Zero to Bitch in .9 Seconds."
MR.
MACKEY, the wiry school counselor, leads the group.
There's
a pottery wheel and lots of craft tables behind them.
MR. MACKEY
Mkay, it's come to my attention, that you
boys have a potty-mouth problem, mkay.
Now the sooner you recognize your
problem, mkay, the sooner we can get you
back to your third grade homeroom where
you belong.
KYLE
But they're just words, Mr. Mackey. Our
parents are over-reacting.
BEBE
Yeah, Wendy's here, and she doesn't even
like Terrance and Phillip!
Wendy looks bored. Stan tries to smile at her, but she
doesn't even acknowledge him.
Meanwhile, Cartman is violently shaking in his seat.
CARTMAN
Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having
Cheesy Poof withdrawal...
MR. MACKEY
Mkay, kids from all over the State have
been brought here, because you all share
the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's
start with you.
He points at Gregory. The little British bastard from the
lake.
GREGORY
My name is Gregory... And I have a potty
mouth.
Wendy looks at Gregory. Stan notices this.
CARTMAN
You've got a stupid accent too.
MR. MACKEY
Eric, that is not appropriate.
CARTMAN
What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the
ear.
MR. MACKEY
Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly
what I'm talking about. We have to change
the way you think.
GREGORY
How are you gonna do that?
Mr. Mackey crosses to a piano. He plays chords while speaking
the following lines.
MR. MACKEY
There are times when you get suckered in,
by drugs and alcohol and sex with wom-en.
But it's when you do these things too
much
(Singing)
That you've got to clear your head
and get back in touch...
Mr. Mackey plays the piano and sings:
MR. MACKEY
You can do it, it's all up to you,
mkay?
With a method, there's nothing you
can't do, mkay?
You don't have to spend your life
addicted to crack
Homeless on the streets giving hand-
jobs for cash
as long as you follow this simple
plan
I'm fully convinced that it's,
easy, mkay...
The kids are extremely disinterested. Mackey walks over to a
chalkboard.
MR. MACKEY
Step one: Think about fun. Think
about all that you'll miss addicted
to this
Step two: Think it all through.
Think how's this gonna change my
life, what am I gonna miss?
Step three: Go and hug a tree, Hug
anything that gets in your way!
And step four: Just don't do it
anymore - it's easy, Mkay!
Mackey gets the children in a circle all holding hands.
MR. MACKEY
Come on, kids! Sing along!
KIDS
(Extremely half-assed)
You can do it, it's all up to you
mkay?
With a method, there's nothing you
can't do, mkay?
We don't have to spend our lives
addicted to crack
Homeless on the streets giving hand-
jobs for cash
MR. MACKEY
As long as you follow my simple
plan
I'm fully convinced that it's,
easy, mkay...
Everyone starts dancing in a circle.
KIDS
Step one: Think about fun. Think
about all that you'll miss addicted
to this Step two: Think it all
through. Think how's this gonna
change my life, what am I gonna
miss?
Step three: Go and hug a tree, Hug
anything that gets in your way!
And step four: Just don't do it
anymore - it's easy, Mkay!
MR. MACKEY
It's easy, Mkay?!
Everyone falls down laughing.
Kyle's mom and the other moms watch the kids and Mr. Mackey
rolling around on the floor laughing on a security monitor.
KYLE'S MOTHER
What the hell do they think this is?!
Summer camp?!
Just then, Kyle's mother walks in with a scowling look,
interupting the kids and Mr. Mackey who are still laughing
merrily. The other mothers are behind her.
KYLE'S MOTHER
Mr. Mackey, what is going on?!
Mr. Mackey stands up, looking scared.
MR. MACKEY
Uh, we're just, starting our program...
KYLE'S MOTHER
This is NOT a place for fun and games!
This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!!
We at MAC have a trial to go to!
The mothers walk away.
MR. MACKEY
Mkay.
CARTMAN
God Damn it your mom is a bitch, Kyle.
Kyle hangs his head.
Terrance and Phillip are on the stand.
JOHNNY COCHRAN
Terrance and Phillip... You knowingly,
with malice of forethought were trying to
destroy American culture, yes or no?
Terrance rips a fart.
JOHNNY COCHRAN
YES OR NO!
The kids are all in the main room, sitting on a couch,
huddled around a television.
They laugh merrily.
STAN
Shh! Mr. Mackey's gonna hear us!
TERRANCE
The Americans are just showing their TRUE
COLORS as smelly bastards.
PHILLIP
Fight the power!
TERRANCE
The young boy that died lit himself on
fire. It was unfortunate, but how can
they blame US?
PHILLIP
Don't believe the hype!!
Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.
The kids all shout agreement.
KIDS
(Adlib)
Yeah! WooHoo!
BACK TO COURTHOUSE
Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.
TERRANCE
You cannot oppress us! We will continue
to pursue our art. We know there are
Americans out there who will help us!
Kyle's mother now stands up from the prosecutor's table.
KYLE'S MOTHER
Your 'ART' is shallow and immature! We
Americans do NOT allow that for our
children!!
PHILLIP
Please. You teach your children that
America is the land of the free. But it's
all bullshit. You're one of the most
conservative countries in the world!
The children all listen, wide-eyed.
TERRANCE
The problem is you don't allow your
children to think for themselves. You try
to raise them in a protective bubble, and
then when they finally get old enough,
they realize they've been lied to, and
they resent you for it.
PHILLIP
Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so
fucked up.
KYLE'S MOTHER
THAT IS ENOUGH!!
TERRANCE
WAKE UP AMERICA! YOUR government censors
YOU from the world.
KYLE'S MOTHER
NO THEY DON'T!
PHILLIP
YES THEY DO! AND I'LL PROVE IT TO YOU! IN
MARCH OF LAST YEAR, THE AMERICAN
GOVERNMENT-
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOP.
Suddenly, the screen goes blank. A sign that says 'PLEASE
STAND BY' comes on.
The kids all watch, wide-eyed.
KYLE
What happened?
WENDY
The station CONVENIENTLY went blank.
The Canadian Prime Minister stands directly in front of
camera, looking right at us.
CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER
ATTENTION AMERICA!! You have taken our
national treasure Terrance and Phillip.
We, in turn, have taken yours... The
Smothers Brothers!
The Canadian Prime Minister steps out of the way, revealing
the Smothers Brothers tied up in chairs behind him.
CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER
I'll let you catch your breath... Now,
release Terrance and Phillip, or else we
will EXECUTE your beloved Smothers
Brothers!!
TOMMY SMOTHERS
Please listen to them!!
DICK SMOTHERS
They're not fucking around!!
CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER
We're not fucking around. This is not
aboot deals. This aboot dignity. This is
aboot freedom... This is aboot respect.
RETURN Terrance and Phillip NOW!!!
Another Canadian leans in and whispers in the Prime
Minister's ear.
CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER
Oh yeah... AND FUCK YOU, AMERICA!
He raises his middle finger, but it's all blurred and
digitized.
MR. MACKEY
Okay kids, for today's rehabilitation
activity, we're going to watch the
Terrance and Phillip movie.
STAN
What?!
KYLE
Sweet!
MR. MACKEY
Now, this is an EDITED version of the
movie, which was put out by the MPAA.
That's the Motion Picture Association of
America.
WENDY
Isn't that censorship?
MR. MACKEY
No the MPAA is NOT a censorship group.
WENDY
Why not?
MR. MACKEY
Uh... Because they say so... Mkay. Now I
want you to watch this movie, with all
the immature profanity taken out, and
notice how much better a movie it
becomes...
Mackey puts the tape in and hits play.
The TITLES come up 'Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire'
Except that 'Asses' has been blurred out, and replaced with
'bunz'.
KIDS
HOORAY!!!
The movie begins. Phillip walks in. But it isn't Phillip's
voice, somebody has dubbed him over.
DUBBED PHILLIP
Hey Terrance. I feel like I'm going to
pass gas near your head.
DUBBED TERRANCE
I would rather you didn't, Phillip.
DUBBED PHILLIP
Oh? Is that so?
Phillip farts on Terrance.
TERRANCE
Oh, you are such a maroon!
PHILLIP
You would know, dummy.
The boys look confused.
TERRANCE
You are pigeon-like in your intelligence.
The pseudo-Terrance and Phillip laugh. Terrance throws a
match on Phillip and Phillip burns to death.
A TITLE comes up - THE END.
And the credits roll.
CARTMAN
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!
KYLE
Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!
The lights in the theater come up.
MR. MACKEY
So you see, the point and the theme of
the film is kept intact. And of course,
the MPAA didn't cut out any of the
graphic violence. What did you think?
CARTMAN
Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to
get the taste of ass out of my mouth from
that piece of shit movie.
MR. MACKEY
Eric, you're not watching your mouth!
CARTMAN
You get me Cheesy Poofs with the
delightful cheddar crunch, and I'll watch
my fucking mouth!
MR. MACKEY
Eric!!!!
You need to be rehabilitated.
Help me to help you!
CARTMAN
Help yourself prickfuck!
MR. MACKEY
I am not a prickfuck, mkay? You little
asshole!
Mackey slaps his hand over his mouth and looks around, scared.
CARTMAN
Ha, ha, you stupid asshole prickfuck.
Mr. Mackey is in a private office with the members of M.A.C.
KYLE'S MOTHER
How is the children's progress?
MR. MACKEY
Very encouraging. Most of the children
have been weened from their naughty
mouths.
KYLE'S MOTHER
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
MR. MACKEY
(Nervous)
Well, some of the children just don't
respond to 12 step programs.
KYLE'S MOTHER
Then we'll have to resort to plan B and
call the v-chip organization.
Dramatic MUSIC STING. Mackey looks afraid.
MR. MACKEY
Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn't been
fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.
KYLE'S MOTHER
(Evil)
I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate
times call for desperate measures, Mr.
Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of
your situation.
MR. MACKEY
(Nervous)
Alright, I'll make the call...
The kids are again glued to the TV watching the trial of
Terrance and Phillip.
Back in the courthouse, the jury walks in and sits down.
JUDGE
Madam foreman, have you reached a
verdict?
FOREMAN
We have, your honor.
JUDGE
How find you, the jury?
FOREMAN
We the jury, find the defendants...
Terrance and Phillip... GUILTY of being
complete bastards.
The crowd goes wild. The mothers of M.A.C. stand and cheer.
The kids sit in shock.
KYLE
Oh no!
TERRANCE
Oh oh, Phillip. You know what this means?
PHILLIP
We'll be farting bread and water for a
few years.
The judge bangs her gavel.
JUDGE
Terrance and Phillip, for crimes against
the great nation of America you are
hereby sentenced to DEATH.
HUGE MUSIC STING.
TERRANCE
DEATH?! You gotta be shittin' me!
PHILLIP
Aghgh!
Phillip passes out.
The kids can't believe what they're seeing. Everyone is
silent. Finally, Kyle perks up.
KYLE
Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!
STAN
How do we do that?
Kyle thinks for a moment.
WENDY
You raise awareness by distributing
buttons, stickers and leaflets.
CARTMAN
That'd be sweet! We could try to bring
back Cheesy Poofs!
KYLE
Yeah, let's make Free Terrance and
Phillip buttons!
WENDY
You guys don't even care. All you care
about is seeing Terrance and Phillip fart
on each other more.
The boys sit there and blink.
STAN
Yeah!
WENDY
This is about freedom of speech, Stan,
about censorship.
The handsome English kid, Gregory chimes in.
GREGORY
Yes, what's next? Barcodes on our
forearms? This country is the most
fascist of all.
Wendy looks at Gregory deeply. Gregory smiles at her.
STAN
What the hell are you talking about, kid?
WENDY
You don't get it Stan... You just don't
get it.
Wendy walks away.
STAN
What? What don't I get?
(To Kyle)
What don't I get?
KYLE
I don't know, dude.
STAN
That British dickhole is what's taking
Wendy away from me!
KYLE
I thought she wasn't your girlfriend,
dude.
STAN
She's Not! But if she WAS it would be
THAT little asshole who's fucking it up
for me!
The kids are all sitting in rows, wearing very crude 'Free
Terrance and Phillip' buttons.
MR. MACKEY
Mkay, children, you've all made terrific
progress, and are hereby done with the
eight step program.
The kids all AD LIB relief.
CARTMAN
Thank God, that sucked ass.
MR. MACKEY
Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you
need to work more on not saying the F
word and the N word.
CARTMAN
The N word?
MR. MACKEY
(Reading)
Norwegian Ass Raper.
CARTMAN
Oh yeah.
MR. MACKEY
The rest of you are graduated. You can go
home today.
The kids cheer.
CARTMAN
I don't graduate?! WHAT THE FUCK IS
THIS?! THIS IS BULLSHIT?!
Just then, Mackey notices the little buttons on everybody's
shirts.
MR. MACKEY
Free Terrance and Phillip? Oh no... Mkay.
KYLE
(Proudly)
We're protesting!
STAN
Yeah!
MR. MACKEY
Well, boys, it might interest you to know
that your FRIENDS the Canadians have just
bombed the U.S.
STAN
They did?!
MR. MACKEY
Yes, at six this morning they bombed the
heck out of Cleveland.
KYLE
Oh. That doesn't count.
WENDY
They only bombed Cleveland because we're
going to Execute two of their citizens!!
MR. MACKEY
Wendy, Mkay, if you want to start getting
political, I'll throw your skinny little
butt right back into rehab. Mkay?
CARTMAN
HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU NOT GRADUATE ME?!
DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE TO STAY HERE?!
MR. MACKEY
No, Eric... I'm afraid it's phase two for
you...
Dramatic MUSIC sting.
Kenny is chained up in a torture chamber in Hell.
Demons and
ghouls surround him.
SATAN
Prepare thyself for unending pain!
Unparalleled misery!!
Kenny starts to cry.
Saddam Hussein comes out from behind Satan holding a martini.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Hey, relax Satan. Don't get all worked
up. You're gonna give yourself an ulcer
again.
KENNY
Mrph mprph!!
SADDAM HUSSEIN
What? What do you mean you don't belong
here? Relax guy, hell is for children.
KENNY
Mrph mprhm mm rmph!
SADDAM HUSSEIN
A deal? You wanna make a deal with the
devil. Well sure, deals are mounds o'
fun.
SATAN
(To Saddam)
Saddam, would you let me do my job
please!
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid
wants.
KENNY
Mph rmph rm rmph rmph rm!
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Oh, you want out of hell, huh?
SATAN
Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The
whole POINT of hell is that you don't
WANT to be here!
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you
want out of hell, all you have to do is
collect 10 proofs of purchases from
'Snacky Smores.'
They're rich,
chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring
me ten proofs of purchases and we'll
grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.
KENNY
Mrph?
SADDAM HUSSEIN
I wouldn't bullshit you kid! Snacky
Smores are now available in stores
everywhere! No biggie!
Saddam walks over to Kenny and releases his chains.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
(To Kenny)
Well what are you waiting for pal?!
Get
to it!
Kenny runs out and away.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
HA HA HAHA!! What a dumbass!!
Saddam walks over and joins Satan on the couch.
SATAN
I don't see why you have to belittle me
in front of people like that.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke.
Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only
available up on Earth. He'll never get
'em, see?
SATAN
Sometimes I just think you don't have any
respect for me.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Hey, come here, guy.
Saddam pulls Satan around and plants a big wet kiss on him.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Who's my cream puff?
SATAN
I am.
A large crowd of parents has gathered for a PTA meeting.
Kenny's mother is at a table selling dead Kenny t-shirts. She
has a shitload of money all around her. Another MOTHER walks
up, hands Kenny's mom money, and gets a shirt.
MOTHER
Is that a new pearl bracelet, Mrs.
McKormick?
KENNY'S MOTHER
Why yes. Yes it is.
Meanwhile, Kyle's mother is on the stand.
KYLE'S MOTHER
As our next official order of business
here at M.A.C., we will test the new V-
chip. As most of you know, the V-chip was
created to lock children out of watching
certain shows on television. And now the
N.I.H. has created a new, exciting
product that they can tell us all about.
Here is the Surgeon General, Dr.
Pangloss.
DOCTOR PANGLOSS, a lab technician in white takes the podium.
DOCTOR PANGLOSS
Thank you, parents.
One person claps. Pangloss hits a button and a slide
projector starts showing pictures of the device.
DOCTOR PANGLOSS
The machinery of the new 'V-chip' is very
simple, and similar to that of the V-
chip. The chip is placed just under the
subject's skin, where it emits a small
but painful shock of electricity whenever
an obscenity is uttered.
The parents are fascinated.
STAN'S FATHER
Now wait a minute, are you telling us
that this chip somehow KNOWS if the kid
is swearing?
DOCTOR PANGLOSS
It's just like a lie detector. Certain
things happen in you when you swear just
like when you lie, the chip picks up on
this and gives the subject a shock.
The parents AD LIB 'Ooohs' and 'Ahhhhs'
DOCTOR PANGLOSS
We are very excited to see the results of
this test.
(Calling)
Patient 453, would you step out here,
please?
Cartman steps out wearing a hospital gown.
DOCTOR PANGLOSS
Patient 453 here has been fitted with the
new v-chip...
CARTMAN
My head hurts.
DOCTOR PANGLOSS
Don't worry about that. Now, I want you
to say 'Doggy.'
CARTMAN
Doggy.
DOCTOR PANGLOSS
Notice that nothing happens.
(To Cartman)
Now say 'Montana.'
CARTMAN
Montana.
DOCTOR PANGLOSS
Good. Now 'Pillow'.
CARTMAN
Pillow.
DOCTOR PANGLOSS
Alright, now I want you to say
'horsefucker.'
Cartman looks offstage to his mother.
CARTMAN'S MOTHER
Go ahead, it's alright, Eric.
Cartman smiles.
CARTMAN
Horsefuck-
BZZZZZAAAAT!!!!
CARTMAN
AGAAHGAHGAH!!!!!
Cartman falls to the floor in pain. All the parents ooh and
ahh and applaud.
CARTMAN
OW!! That HURT GOD DAMMI-
BAZAAATTT!!
CARTMAN
OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T
FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--
BAZAAATTT!!
DOCTOR PANGLOSS
Success!! Our device works perfectly! We
will begin mass production immediately!
KYLE'S MOTHER
And so we have succesfully removed the
Canadian smut from all of our children's
brains.
We have made changes at school to ensure
that our kids are NEVER AGAIN exposed to
smut!!!!!!! It's OVER!
The crowd goes wild.
Stan and Kyle are sitting in their desks, waiting for school
to begin.
Wendy walks by on her way to her desk.
STAN
Hi Wendy.
WENDY
(Not even looking)
Hi Stan.
Wendy walks on by.
KYLE
Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats
ass about you.
STAN
(Eyes still on Wendy)
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
KYLE
Good thing she was never your
girlfriend... Dude, here comes Cartman.
Cartman walks in and gingerly sits down.
KYLE
Hey, Cartman, did they put that V-chip in
your head or your ass?
STAN
What's the difference?
Stan and Kyle laugh.
CARTMAN
Very funny dickhead-
BZZAAT!
The v-chip shocks Cartman.
CARTMAN
OW!
FUCK-
BZZZAAAT!!
CARTMAN
AY!
Cartman is thrown to the floor in a shivering heap.
KYLE
Whoa!
What the hell was that?!
STAN
Dude!
It's the V-chip!
It shocks him
ever time he cusses!
Stan and Kyle look at each other.
Kyle smiles.
KYLE
Hey Cartman.
CARTMAN
What?
KYLE
You know, me and Stan were just talking
about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck
you are.
CARTMAN
Oh yeah?!
Well you're a monkey-shit-
BZAAAT!
CARTMAN
SHIT-
BZZZAAAT!!
CARTMAN
FUCK-
BZZAAAT!!
The cycle continues as Stan and Kyle laugh merrily
watching Cartman flopping around on the floor.
KYLE
This is sweet!!
STAN
Totally!
Garrison stands before his class.
MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, let's try a few new math
problems. What is five times two?
The kids all just sit there.
MR. GARRISON
Come on, children, do be shy, just give
it your best shot.
Clyde raises his hand.
MR. GARRISON
Yes, Clyde?
CLYDE
Twelve?
MR. GARRISON
Okay, now let's try to get an answer from
somebody who's not a complete retard.
Anyone? Come on don't be shy...
Just then, the door bursts open and in walks a couple of Nazi
looking American soldiers.
They walk over to the children and start pulling off their
'Free Terrance and Phillip' pins.
STAN
Hey, what are you doing?
SOLDIER
You can't wear these in school. It's
against school policy, thank you.
Another solider rips off Kyle's pin and replaces it with a
yellow star.
KYLE
What's that for?
SOLDIER 2
You get a star for doing well in school.
Just as quickly, the soldiers make their way out the door.
WENDY
NAZIS!!
STAN
What's the matter, Wendy?
WENDY
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
STAN
(To Kyle)
God damn it, why does she keep saying
that?
The boys are in line. Nazi-ish soldiers usher them through.
STAN
I'm so sick of these soldiers.
KYLE
Yeah, they suck.
CARTMAN
I know.
Always saying, do this, do that.
They think they're so cooool.
(To the soldier)
Acht lieben kraft auct shpiler!
(BZZZT)
OW!!!
The soldier glares at him. The boys walk into the kitchen,
where they are greeted by their big, happy, black school
CHEF!
CHEF
Hello there, children!!
STAN
Hey, Chef.
CHEF
How would like some Salisbury Steak with
buttered noodles?
KYLE
We can't, we're on a hunger strike.
CHEF
A hunger strike? For what?
STAN
To free Terrance and Phillip.
CARTMAN
But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.
STAN
Chef, do you know anything about women?
CHEF
Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?
KYLE
I don't know.
CHEF
Children, I know ALL there is to know
about women.
STAN
What's the secret to making a woman
happy?
CHEF
(Dishing out food)
Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the
clitoris.
STAN
Huh?
Suddenly, Chef realizes who he's talking to.
CHEF
Oops, I guess you haven't got that far
in your anatomy class, huh?
STAN
No, what does that mean, find the
clitoris?
CARTMAN
Is that like finding Jesus or something?
Now Chef starts to panic.
CHEF
Uh... Nothing. Forget I said anything.
Now move along, children! You're holding
up the line!
Just then, the P.A. blares out an announcement.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA (O.S.)
ATTENTION ALL SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY
STUDENTS AND STAFF! REPORT TO THE
GYMNASIUM IMMEDIATELY FOR A SPECIAL
ANNOUNCEMENT!!
STAN
Woa, I wonder what's going on, dude.
All the elementary students are gathered in front of a large
television monitor.
Mr. Garrison and his class walk in and look confused.
The boys walk up to Chef.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Please take your seats, everyone!!!!
They all go to their seats.
KYLE
What's going on, Chef?
CHEF
Something big, children.
The television goes from that Emergency broadcast signal to a
scene of a news anchor sitting at his desk.
NEWS ANCHOR
(Very serious)
This is a State of Emergency. We go now
to the White House for a VERY IMPORTANT
ANNOUNCEMENT from the President of the
United States.
The President is sitting in a chair by the fireplace.
PRESIDENT CLINTON
Ladies and gentlemen... At five a.m.
today, a day which will live in infamy...
sort of... the U.S. has declared war on
Canada.
ANGLE - KIDS
They all stare in silence. Mr. Garrison takes a deep breath.
CHEF
Oh, no...
MR. MACKEY
I don't believe it.
CARTMAN
Holy crap-
(BZZZT!)
OW!! Hey crap isn't a swear word, what
the fuck?!
(ZZZZZZTTT)
AGAGAGH!!!
PRESIDENT CLINTON
All Canadians are to leave the country
immediately, or be subject to military
camps. All Canadian products are to be
thrown out.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
How can they do this?
MR. GARRISON
I never thought there would be war again
in my lifetime...
PRESIDENT CLINTON
Do not be afraid of this war. Instead
embrace it. We have God on our side. And
besides, they're just Canadians, what the
hell are they gonna do?
Everyone watches the television in stunned silence.
STAN
Chef, what does it mean that we're at
war?
CHEF
It's... It's not good children.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
What do we do? Do we go on as normal
or...?
MR. GARRISON
I don't know Principal Victoria... I
don't know...
PRESIDENT
And now, I would like to bring up the
woman who led, and is still leading the
way in this glorious stand-
KYLE
(Pointing to TV)
HOLY SHIT DUDE!!
Kyle's mom appears on the TV dressed in military garb.
PRESIDENT
Mrs. Sheila Brovlofski.
CHEF
Isn't that your mother, Kyle?
Kyle can't believe it.
On the television, Kyle's mother walks up to the podium. She
is dressed to the hilt. She hugs the President and the first
lady and then takes a deep breath.
KYLE'S MOTHER
My fellow Americans. I have led this
fight in the War against profanity. I
have founded Mothers Against Canada.
Our
neighbor to the north has abused us for
the last time.
PRESIDENT
As Commander in chief, I have ordered our
Army to set up defensive positions along
the US-Canada border in anticipation of
an attack.
KYLE'S MOTHER
What about air strikes?
PRESIDENT
Huh?
KYLE'S MOTHER
We have to have air strikes on their
military and entertainment centers.
It's
the only way to ensure that their smut
can't reach American soil!
PRESIDENT
Oh, uh...
I don't know if air strikes
are necessary.
KYLE'S MOTHER
Not necessary?!
Mr. President, may I
remind you that our country's heart and
soul are at stake, and our children's
minds are the battlefield!
The bastard Canadians want to fight us
because we won't tolerate their potty
mouths. Well, if it is war they want...
THEN WAR THEY SHALL HAVE!!!
A huge eruption of cheers from the crowd in front of Kyle's
mother. She is obviously floored by it. She can't help but
smile. She actually holds her head up higher, and then raises
her arms up in two peace signs, as the cheers get louder.
The president forces a smile and actually applauds with the
rest of the crowd.
Back in the gymnasium, Kyle looks thoroughly embarrassed.
CHEF
Damn, your mom's a bitch, Kyle.
CARTMAN
Amen to that.
Kenny is sadly walking around hell. He walks up to another
one of hell's prisoners.
KENNY
Mph rmph rm rmph rm?
GEORGE BURNS
Snacky Smores? Why the hell would I have
proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores?
Beat it, kid.
Kenny moves along. He hears some voices coming from a door.
Kenny opens the door and peeps inside-
Saddam and Satan are lying in bed.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
You just get cranky when you're tired,
that's all.
I told you that you
shouldn't have tried to carry that futon
all by yourself.
SATAN
I'm not cranky.
And that futon was not
too big to carry myself-
Just then, Satan hears a reporter on CNN.
TV
In war news, countries from Europe and
Asia are joining sides in the Canadian-
American War-
SADDAM HUSSEIN
-Listen butterbuns, let's make love and
forget about the whole thing-
SATAN
SHHH!!!!
TV
...The death count is already on its way
to 10 million with no signs of slowing
down.
What started as a spat between the
United States and Canada is quickly
turning into World War III-
Kenny's eyes bulge, he wants to see more, but Satan clicks
off the television and sits up in bed.
SATAN
It has come to be...
The Four Horsemen
are drawing nigh!
The time of the
prophecy is upon us!
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Oh I love when you get all biblical
Satan.
You know exactly how to turn my
crank!
SATAN
No I'm being serious! Those Canadian
entertainers are to be killed. It is the
seventh sign.
Satan walks over to large pedestal which holds an ancient
tome.
Satan turns the pages as he talks.
SATAN
Behold, the signs of my reign on earth
are all falling into place!
The fall of
an empire-
He points to an ancient-looking picture of the death of
Ceasar.
SATAN
-The coming of a comet-
He points to a picture of a comet passing by Earth.
SATAN
Jerry Springer's movie doing more than
ten million box office-
A picture of Jerry Springer holding a bunch of money.
SATAN
....And now....
Satan points to an ancient drawing on the wall. It looks like
Terrance and Phillip being stabbed in the head.
SATAN
The seventh sign!
When the blood of
these Canadians touches American soil...
It will be my time to rise!!!!!
DRAMATIC music.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Yeah!
YEAH!!!
Man I'm getting so HOT!!!
SATAN
Do you always think about sex?
I'm
talking about some very important stuff
here!
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Listen buttercup, let's make love and
forget about the whole thing.
SATAN
Is sex the only thing that matters to
you?
Saddam thinks for a second.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
I love you.
Satan sits with his arms crossed and a frown.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
You know I do.
SATAN
I know.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
So what do you say we shut off that light
and get close, huh?
Satan reaches over and turns off the light.
Everything goes
pitch black. The light goes off of Kenny's face as well.
A beat.
Then, a small moan from Satan.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Yeah, you like that, don't you bitch?
Kyle is at the keyboard of his dad's computer. Stan and
Cartman are waiting in the background.
KYLE
Okay... I just need to find a few private
message boards...
STAN
Wait! Before we put a message out, do a
search on the word 'clitoris'.
KYLE
Okay...
Kyle types in the word and hits return.
KYLE
(Reading the screen)
"Found Eight Million Pages With the Word
Clitoris"!
STAN
Wow!
KYLE
I'll just try the first one.
Kyle clicks the mouse. They wait for the screen to load.
Finally, it does.
KYLE
Dude! It's a lady giving a blow job to a
horse!
Stan and Cartman rush over.
STAN
Is it Cartman's mom?
CARTMAN
Very funny!
KYLE
Hey... It IS Cartman's mom!!
Cartman looks at the screen.
CARTMAN
Oh, son of a bitch!
(ZZAP!!)
AAGHGH!! I mean, son of a biscuit!
STAN
Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman!
Ike bounces in, happily.
IKE
Ber dada!
KYLE
Get out of here Ike, you're too young for
this stuff!
IKE
Papa mama simi.
Ike bounces out.
CARTMAN
Come on, just get to the message board!
KYLE
I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian
server... I've got to break into the main
frame...
Kyle furiously hits a bunch of keys.
KYLE
Damn it! They've got an access code! I'll
try to reroute the encryptions...
Kyle furiously hits a bunch more keys.
STAN
Dude, do you know what you're doing?
KYLE
No, dude, all you have to do is hit the
keys really fast and say a bunch of
stupid shit and it works.
Just then the screen pops up. Access Granted.
KYLE
Bingo. Okay, here we go...
(Typing)
Want to help Terrance and Phillip? Meet
us for a meeting at Gladdy's barn
tomorrow night...
CARTMAN
Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
KYLE
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
CARTMAN
More people will come if they think
there'll be pie and punch!
KYLE
(Typing)
pie and punch... This is Top Secret. The
password is...
The boys all think...
STAN
(Dramatically)
La Resistance.
Triumphant MUSIC cue.
The door to the attic pops open.
Kyle shoves Ike up into the
attic.
KYLE
You stay up here in the attic, Ike.
Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?
IKE
Uhh...
KYLE
Goodnight, Ike, we're all going to bed.
The door closes and it is dark.
Ike blinks. He looks out a small window, onto the street
below.
A few armed soldiers walk by.
Ike pulls out a little plastic harmonica and sadly starts to
play.
Tons of MILITARY PERSONNEL are running to and fro. Giant
computer screens show Canada's latest attacks.
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Sir! The Canadians have destroyed Des
Moines!!
PRESIDENT
How can you tell?
Everyone laughs merrily.
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Good one, sir!
Suddenly, a PENTAGON GUY runs up to the President, holding
some papers.
PENTAGON GUY
Sir, we're tracking a signal crossing
into Canadian computers! It looks like we
may have a resistance movement
starting...
The President grabs the papers and dashes over to Kyle's
mother, who is standing there looking smug, with her arms
behind her back and her chest out. She has a few military
badges on her.
PRESIDENT
(Showing her the papers)
Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance...
It's probably Canadian spies!!
KYLE'S MOTHER
Well find out where that signal is coming
from!
Then hunt them down like dogs!
Any and all Canadian influence must be
stopped at all cost!
PRESIDENT
Yes ma'am!
The President starts to run off.
KYLE'S MOTHER
And Bill?
PRESIDENT
Yes?
KYLE'S MOTHER
I'm needing lunch.
PRESIDENT
Right away, ma'am!
The president runs off.
Cartman's mother is tucking him into bed.
RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
What is quickly being referred to as 'The
Great Canadian-American War' has already
reached a death toll of two million.
Cartman's mother reaches over and switches off the radio.
CARTMAN'S MOTHER
Goodnight, honey.
CARTMAN
Mom... When is the war gonna be over?
CARTMAN'S MOTHER
I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You
want it to end quickly, huh?
CARTMAN
Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz
all my favorite TV shows have been
replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
CARTMAN'S MOTHER
Oh.
With that, Cartman's mother gets up-
CARTMAN
Mom...
CARTMAN'S MOTHER
Yes, hon?
CARTMAN
If you went down on a horse... You'd tell
me, right?
CARTMAN'S MOTHER
Sure, hon. Goodnight.
She switches off the light, and leaves.
Cartman lies there, lit only by soft, blue moonlight and
thinks.
He hears a SCRAPING noise, and looks a little scared, but
then tries to close his eyes to sleep.
CARTMAN
Go away, scary noise.
Again the SCRAPING. Cartman pops open hs eyes to see -
KENNY! He is transparent and floating above Cartman's bed.
Cartman is horrified. Too much so to even scream.
Kenny puts his hands to his mouth to try and speak, but he
makes no sound.
Finally, Cartman lets out a piercing cry.
Cartman's mother comes running in, just as the image of Kenny
disappears.
CARTMAN'S MOTHER
Eric?! Eric, what is it?!
CARTMAN
I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
Cartman's mother looks around and sees nothing. Finally, she
just cradles Cartman's fat head in her arms.
CARTMAN'S MOTHER
Oh you poor dear. You've been through so
much...
CARTMAN
I bet him he couldn't set himself on fire
and now he's all pissed off!!
(BZZTZT!)
AGH! I can't say pissed off?!
(BAZZTZT!!)
AGH!!
Kenny is again snooping around. He quietly creaks Satan's
door open and walks in.
Satan is in his room, looking at a map of Earth.
SATAN
The execution of Terrance and Phillip is
imminent, soon all hell shall rise!!
Kenny looks scared.
SATAN
(Evil and scary)
Are you afraid, little one? Afraid for
the souls of your pitiful friends that-
Suddenly, Saddam walks in carrying some bags.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Hey Satan!
I got some great new home
furnishings today!
Satan rolls his eyes and sighs. His attempt to be evil to
Kenny is squashed again.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Boy buddy Rich, it was a bitch to get
something to match with that bathroom
tile!
Saddam looks at Kenny.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Oh, hey kid. Find those proofs of
purchases yet? No?! Gee, whatta surprise!
Well, keep lookin!
A beat. Satan folds his arms and looks at the floor, pissed.
SATAN
Do you wanna know what I did today?
Saddam lets out a sigh.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
What did you do today Satan?
SATAN
You don't care.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Hey fella!
Relax!
This whole armageddon
thing has got you all stressed out. Let's
make love.
SATAN
Do you remember when you first got here?
We used to talk all night long. Until the
sun came up... We would just lie in bed
and TALK.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
That's because I wanted to fuck you,
dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those
pants down!
SATAN
Don't call me dumb!
SADDAM HUSSEIN
I mean cute dumb. Now bend over!
As this conversation happens, Kenny's eyes dart back and
forth as if watching a tennis match.
SATAN
How come you always want to make love to
me from behind? Is it because you want to
pretend I'm somebody else?
Saddam sighs.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Satan, your ass is gigantic and red, who
am I gonna pretend you are? Helen Reddy?
A beat.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Come on, kid. Help me with these shower
curtains.
Saddam and Kenny walk out. Leaving Satan all alone with sad
music playing.
SATAN
(Gently)
Sometimes I think
When I look up real high
That there's a whole world up there
And just maybe it could be mine
But then, I sink
because it's here I'm supposed to
stay
but I don't even know how or why
its supposed to be that way-
Satan walks to his veranda.
SATAN
Up there, there is so much room
Where babies burp and flowers bloom
Everyone dreams I can dream too
Up there, Up where
The skies are ocean blue
I could be safe and live without a
care... Up there
Satan walks over to a bright blue globe and spins it slowly.
SATAN
They say I don't belong
That my place is down below
Because of my beliefs I'm supposed
to stay where evil is sewn
But what is evil anyway?
Is there reason to the rhyme?
Without evil there could be no good
So it must be good to be evil
sometimes
Up there, there is so much room
Where babies burp and flowers bloom.
Everyone dreams I can dream too
Up there, Up where
The skies are ocean blue
I could be safe and life without a
care... Up there
PULL BACK, big crane shot rising above Satan.
Stan and Kyle are painting a sign on the wall 'La
Resistance'.
Cartman comes running in, he looks scared.
KYLE
You're late, Cartman!
CARTMAN
I had to ride my bike here. My behind is
killing me.
KYLE
Your behind?
CARTMAN
I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if
I say 'ass-
(BBZZAATT)
OW!!!
KYLE
Did you bring the pie and punch?
CARTMAN
No you guys... Something happened... You
guys wanna hear something creepy?
(Looking over each shoulder)
I don't think Kenny is dead.
STAN
What?
CARTMAN
I saw him last night!
KYLE
I know Cartman, I know.
I see Kenny
every day.
CARTMAN
YOU DO?!
KYLE
Sure, dude.
On the face of every child,
on the smile of every baby...
Kyle and Stan laugh again.
CARTMAN
Hey!
I'm telling you this WAS Kenny! I
think he's haunting me.
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK!
The boys all look scared.
KYLE
Somebody's here...
The boys walk over to the door, and open the sliding panel in
front of their eyes.
KYLE
Who is it?
VOICE
Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.
KYLE
What's the password?
VOICE
Uhh... I don't know.
KYLE
Guess.
VOICE
Uhh... Bacon.
KYLE
Okay.
Kyle opens the door. The golden haired young boy from rehab
stands there looking handsome and angelic.
GREGORY
Viva la Resistance.
STAN
Oh no, it's that kid.
GREGORY
This is the place--
Another kid walks up next to Gregory, it's Wendy. Stan's eyes
grow wide.
STAN
Wendy?
WENDY
Stan?! YOU started La Resistance?
GREGORY
Well, apparently you have a bigger heart
than we thought. Let us get this meeting
underway, there are others coming.
Gregory takes Wendy's hand and pushes his way in. Stan fumes.
Now the room is filled with a bunch of scared looking
RESISTANCE FOLLOWERS. All of whom are under the age of
twelve.
The room is lit only by candlelight. And the large 'VIVA LA
RESISTANCE' banner hands on the wall.
Stan and Kyle look nervous.
STAN
Everyone be seated, please.
The kids all sit down.
KYLE
Wow, a lot of people showed up.
STAN
Yeah, so what do we say?
KYLE
I thought you had something planned.
STAN
Me?!
Stan looks out over the faces. Gregory checks his watch.
STAN
(Nervous)
Kay. Uh... Terrance and Phillip are
supposed to be killed, and we think that
sucks ass!!
The kids don't respond. Stan shoots a nervous look at Wendy,
who is sitting next to Gregory.
STAN
Uhh... So we think we should prank call a
bunch of policemen! We can have pizzas
sent to them that they didn't order! VIVA
LA RESISTANCE!!!
Again no response. Gregory rolls his eyes.
STAN
Uhh...
Gregory stands up.
GREGORY
May I?
STAN
What?
Gregory takes Stan's place at the front of the group.
GREGORY
Terrance and Phillip are currently being
held at a Canadian Internment camp two
kilometers outside of town.
They are to be executed tomorrow during a
star-studded USO show for the troops.
Gregory pulls a big map out of nowhere and rolls it out. Stan
and Kyle can't believe it.
GREGORY
We must sneak into the camp through this
duct, freeing Terrance and Phillip
inside... The war is escalating, and the
American forces are preparing for a large
scale attack on Canada. That means the
time is now...
KYLE
Wow, dude, Wendy's new guy is smart.
Stan shoots Kyle a dirty look.
GREGORY
This is a dangerous mission, so I'll go
myself.
Wendy smiles at Gregory.
STAN
No!
Everyone looks at Stan.
STAN
WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to
save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!
GREGORY
This will be very dangerous... Are you
quite sure?
CARTMAN
Fuck that!
(BZZT)
AGAGH!!
STAN
We're going... Let's run through the
plan!!
A huge hall is filled with hundreds of soldiers in different
battalions.
We see our regulars: Mr. Garrison with a uniformed Mr. Hat,
Mr. Mackey, Jimbo and Ned, Bo, Pip, Stan's Grandfather,
Jesus, Officer Barbrady....
JIMBO
Oh, I'm so glad there's a war again. I
was gettin' worried I'd never see another
one!
NED
I know what you mean.
JIMBO
And they're giving all us troops a big
USO tomorrow with celebrities and
executions!
PAN OVER to Mr. Garrison.
MR. GARRISON
You look great in your new uniform Mr.
Hat.
MR. HAT
You do too, Mr. Garrison.
MR. GARRISON
Boy, I can't wait for our first shore-
leave so I can go get me some poontang.
Chef sits down in a seat behind Garrison near the back.
GENERAL PLYMKIN, a gruff old army type with bug eyes, steps
up to a podium and addresses the troops.
GENERAL PLYMKIN
PAY ATTENTION!
The crowd settles down.
GENERAL PLYMKIN
It's no secret that the Evil Canadian
Federation has scored major victories all
over the United State.
We have brought
you here because you ar America's best,
and last hope.
Another general leans over to Plymkin and whispers in his
ear.
GENERAL PLYMKIN
Oh... Apparently you're not the best,
you're simply the last. Anyway, let's
strategize... Map!
A large, holographic 3-D map of South Park springs up in
front of him.
He walks around it pointing out things with a
laser-pointer.
GENERAL PLYMKIN
Our sources have told us that the
Canadians might try to attach tomorrow's
USO show and stop us from executing
Terrance and Phillip.
He points to a spot on the 3-D map.
GENERAL PLYMKIN
Now each battalion has a specific code-
name and mission.
Battalion 5, raise
your hands-
Chef is in Battalion 5 and dutifully raises his hand.
Then he looks around and notices to his surprise that
everybody else in his section is also African American.
GENERAL PLYMKIN
You will be the all-important first
defense wave, which we will call
'Operation Human Shield'.
CHEF
Hey, wait a minute...
GENERAL PLYMKIN
Now keep in mind, 'Operation Human
Shield' will suffer heavy losses.
But
don't lose your spirit men!
Stay until
the bitter end.
Battalion 14?
A bunch of white guys raise their hands.
GENERAL PLYMKIN
Right, you are 'Operation Get Behind The
Darkies'.
You will follow Battalion 5
here-
He points to a spot on the 3-D map.
GENERAL PLYMKIN
-and try not to get killed for God's
Sake.
Are there any questions men?
Chef raises his hand.
GENERAL PLYMKIN
Yes soldier?
CHEF
Have you ever heard of the Emancipation
Proclamation?
GENERAL PLYMKIN
I don't listen to hip-hop.
Chef scowls.
GENERAL PLYMKIN
If you somehow live, we will regroup on
this hill outside--
Suddenly, the 3-D hologram starts to flicker and fizzle.
GENERAL PLYMKIN
Now what's wrong with this thing?
General Plymkin messes with the controls.
GENERAL PLYMKIN
Fucking windows 98!
General Plymkin has pulled the plug. He stands there with
the cord in his hands.
GENERAL PLYMKIN
GET GATES IN HERE!!!
BILL GATES walks in, escorted by two MILITARY GUARDS.
GENERAL PLYMKIN
YOU TOLD US WINDOWS 98 WOULD BE FASTER
AND MORE EFFICIENT WITH BETTER ACCESS TO
THE INTERNET!!!
BILL GATES
It is faster, over five million--
Plymkin pulls out a gun and shoots him in the head. Gates
falls to the floor, dead.
GENERAL PLYMKIN
Alright men, get lots of rest, and
prepare thyselves for battle!
In the dead of night, the kids are all in a circle discussing
the plan.
GREGORY
...after you clear this zone here,
rendezvous behind this ridge where
Terrance and Phillip should be held.
KYLE
Gotcha.
GREGORY
You are indeed brave, but you will need
someone who's done this sort of thing
before.
MOLE!
Suddenly, a bump in the ground starts to move forward, leaving
a trail behind it. (like bugs bunny before he pops out)
The bump comes to a stop at the children's feet and out pops
THE MOLE.
He is a very bitter little nine year old French
kid with a THICK French accent.
VOICE
Oui?
GREGORY
Thank you for coming, Mole.
THE MOLE
So... We must free more Canadian
prizoners?
KYLE
Yeah, I guess.
THE MOLE
America... She iz a beetch that sheets on
her own children.
Stan and Kyle look at each other confused.
GREGORY
This is the Mole.
He will accompany you
to the prison where Terrance and Phillip
are.
He is an expert in covert
operations and a lifelong fighter for
freedom.
THE MOLE
Freedom... It's like cow's urine poured
down your troat. You wonder 'Do I want
this?' I'm thersty... But it's urine.
Everyone stares at The Mole.
GREGORY
Good luck Stan, I'll make sure Wendy
is... kept safe?
Stan gets pissed.
KYLE
Give me Terrance and Phillip or give me
death!!!
OTHERS
YEA!!!
Now, Gregory breaks into song. His voice is absolutely
gorgeous and deep. He puts his hand on Stan's shoulder.
GREGORY
God has smiled upon you this day
The fate of a nation in your
hands...
Stan and Kyle look at each other. They can't believe how good
this guy's voice is. Wendy appears enthralled.
GREGORY
As brothers and sisters we unite
And behind you we shall fight!
Until only the most righteous
belief stands!
The music builds. Gregory gets up on a soapbox.
GREGORY
Do you see the distant flames?
they bellow in the night
Fight in all our names
For what we know is right
And if you all get shot and cannot
carry on
Though you die, La Resistance
lives on!
KYLE
What? Shot?
Kyle and the boys look a little worried, as other kids join
in the song.
KIDS
You might get stabbed in the head
by a dagger or a sword
You might be burned to death
or skinned alive or worse!
GREGORY
But when they torture you
You will not feel a need to run
For though you die, La Resistance
Lives on!
KIDS
Do you hear the beating drum?
It is our hearts all joined to one
It is the music of our souls
knowing we have much to overcome!
As THE SONG CONTINUES we-
CUT TO:
The soldiers, including Garrison, Mackey, Ned and Jimbo are
in their bunks.
SOLDIERS
Tomorrow we face our destiny!
Tomorrow we fight to keep our
country free!
Death to Canada! Death to them all!
Like our forefathers we shall
answer the call!
PAN DOWN to Chef's bunk where he is lying naked with a hot
chick. As usual, Chef sings a song that has absolutely no
relevance to what's going on.
CHEF
(Stroking woman's arm)
Baby your thighs sparkle like
diamonds
Baby your butt is tender like the
night
I can see by the look in your pants
that you want to treat me right.
I'll whisper sweet nothings in your
cleavage
And you can kiss me gently with
your tongue
And I'll make love to you so deeply
That you'll feel pressure clear up
to your lungs.
Meanwhile, the soldiers continue their song.
SOLDIERS
Something must be done!
Something's gotta give!
Tomorrow we will be free or we will no
longer live!
CUT TO:
Terrance and Phillip are chained to the wall in a dark, dirty
prison cell. Two armed American soldiers are torturing
Terrance and Phillip with hot irons, as Terrance and Phillip
sing-
TERRANCE & PHILLIP
Shut your fucking face Unclefucka!
You're an ass raping cock sucking
Unclefucka!!!
CUT TO:
Ike watches the soldiers march from his little attic window.
OFFICER (O.S.)
Canadian pussy is mighty cold!
SOLDIERS (O.S.)
CANADIAN PUSSY IS MIGHTY COLD!
Ike blinks.
Does he understand them? he picks up a small
book and starts to write in it.
Satan paces back and forth in hell.
SATAN
This is it! World War Three is at hand!
The millennium nears!
Satan crosses to one of his small demons.
SATAN
Prepare the minions for the rising of
Gothos!
The demon dashes off.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
This is so exciting! Let's fuck!
Satan sighs and bows his head.
SATAN
This is the millennium, Saddam! This is
Armageddon! There's more to life than
sex!
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Hey, relax guy!
SATAN
Well I just want you to be impressed with
what I do. I want you to respect my MIND.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
I DO respect your mind! It turns me on!
It makes me wanna fuck the shit out of
you! Don't you see?
MUSIC BEGINS.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
(Singing)
Hey guy, relax, put out
You gotta put out for me!
I'm just a man with needs
And right now I need your
generosity!
I love your eyes, your nose and
lips
So drop those pants and do some
dips
Come on guy, you gotta relax
relax, put out for me!
Kenny looks confused.
SATAN
What if I, don't wanna put out?
That's all you ever say
Relax put out
I'm a living creature, I have
feelings too, I don't need this
abuse from you-
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Hey, guy, relax, put out!
You gotta relax, shut your mouth-
Baby I'd do anything for ya!
Now don't make me smack you in the
eye like last time-
Kenny keeps watching as Saddam throws on a Shakey's hat and
does a quick softshoe. Satan rolls his eyes.
SADDAM HUSSEIN
I get what I want, and what I want
is for youuuuu toooo put ooooout!!!
Saddam finishes the song and Satanhangs his head.
SATAN
What if I just left?
SADDAM HUSSEIN
Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides,
you know that if you left me, I'd hunt
you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna
go grab a drink.
Saddam leaves. Satan looks about to cry, but then notices
Kenny still standing there.
SATAN
What are you doing?! Get on with your
misery!
KENNY
Mph rmph rm rmph rm?
SATAN
Him? I don't know... He can be nice...
sometimes.
KENNY
Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
SATAN
What do you mean?! I could leave him if I
wanted to!
KENNY
Mph rm. Rmph rm rmph rm.
Satan lowers his head. Slowly he starts to cry. Kenny walks
over and pats him on the back.
Right out of Nazi Germany.
Barbed wire, guards, the whole
bit.
ANGLE ON BOYS
They are on their backs, shimmying along the ground
underneath the blanket of razor-wire that is set up around
the camp.
The Mole uses the bolt-cutters to cut the wire as he goes,
clearing a path for Stan, Kyle and Cartman.
THE MOLE
Be careful not to touch this wire-
A wire catches on Cartman's arm and SNAPS against his face.
CARTMAN
OW!
MOTHERFUCKER!
BZZAAAAT!!!
CARTMAN
FUC-
Stan shoves his hand over Cartman's mouth, leaving Cartman to
cuss bloody murder into Stan's glove.
CARTMAN
MPHMPH MPHMPHMPH!!!
BZAAT!
CARTMAN
MMMPPPHHH!!!
Finally they clear the fence and lie down in view of the
camp.
THE MOLE
It sounds like the USO show has started.
We have precious little time...
Kyle looks at the horrible concentration camp.
KYLE
Oh my God...
THE MOLE
God? ...Let me tell you something about
God... He is ze biggest bitch of zem all.
Kyle looks at The Mole, oddly.
STAN
How are we ever gonna find them?
The Mole whips out some night vision goggles.
ANGLE ON INTERMENT CAMP THROUGH NIGHT VISION GOGGLES
The Mole inspects the camp.
He sees a guard on a guard
tower.
Then he pans over to a bunch of Canadians standing
in a line in rags.
The Mole quickly clicks the magnification to high so we see
the saddened faces of the Canadians.
KYLE
Do you see them?
Do you see Terrance and
Phillip?
THE MOLE
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will
have to dig.
KYLE
That's gonna take a long time!
THE MOLE
Time? Did time matter to the
Revolutionists who were forced to eat
their own shit while dying in the
dungeons of ze King?
The boys think.
The mole is digging frantically while the boys follow on all
fours.
Cartman holds a flashlight.
CARTMAN
Dude, this is seriously lame. I didn't
know we were gonna get all dirty and
stuff.
THE MOLE
Sheet!
STAN
What is it?
THE MOLE
Bedrock!
I cannot dig any further in zis
direction!
STAN
We're going to die here like baby mice
who have had no milk in days.
Dry up
into crunchy little pinkies.
The boys stare.
A beat.
THE MOLE
Or, we can dig UP.
The mole starts digging up towards the ground.
Cartman is by himself, slowly moving from building to
building. He is scared out of his mind.
CARTMAN
(Imitating the Mole)
Shut of ze Power, Cartman. Zis is very
important, Cartman... Stupid British
piece of shi-
(BAZZT!)
OW!
He approaches the electrical box.
Just as he's about to open
it, two armed AMERICAN SOLDIERS round the corner.
Cartman
gets scared and hides in the shadows.
The soldiers continue
walking...
AMERICAN SOLDIER
Dude, if I was gay, I'd be just like Big
Gay AL!
AMERICAN SOLDIER 2
Me too!!
...And pass a terrified Cartman.
The boys are waiting, bored, for The Mole to return.
KYLE
I don't think he's coming back, dude.
Just then, we hear The Mole return from his hole. He is
carrying the ticket guy from the movie theater.
TICKET GUY
Oh thank you! Thank you for getting me
out of there!! They locked me up for
selling movie tickets to minors!
THE MOLE
Is this one of zem?
KYLE
No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!
THE MOLE
Oh... Alright, back you go.
The Mole takes the Ticket Guy back through the hole.
TICKET GUY
No! Please! I don't want to go back!!
The boys sit back down and wait again.
Satan is looking into a large, oracle-like ball. Saddam isn't
around, but a few demons and Kenny are hanging out.
SATAN
The execution is going to happen any
moment... We must prepare.
The demons make excited noises.
KENNY
Mph rmph rm!
SATAN
Get everyone in hell ready. When the
blood of Terrance and Phillip spills, the
day is ours!
Two of the demons head for Satan's room.
SATAN
No! Not Saddam. Don't wake him... Uh...
I'll tell him...
Satan walks to the bedroom.
Cartman approaches the electrical box nervously -- looking
all around for soldiers.
He opens the door to the electrical box and sees a large
switch labeled ON and OFF.
He reaches to turn off the switch
when he feels a tap on his shoulder.
Cartman jumps.
CARTMAN
Agh!!!
Then turns and karate-chops in one spastic flurry to see -
KENNY!!
CARTMAN
Son of a gun!
HECK!
Kenny's ghost is again floating in front of Cartman. Kenny
again struggles to speak.
CARTMAN
GO AWAY, KENNY!
IT'S NOT MY GOSH DARN
FAULT!
KENNY
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
CARTMAN
I don't have proofs of purchases from
Snacky Smores, Kenny!
KENNY
MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!!
CARTMAN
AGAGAH!!
Cartman runs off, leaving the power completely on.
Ike is still just sitting quietly in the dark attic.
Suddenly, the attic door bursts open!
AMERICAN SOLDIER
Found one!
Other soldiers file into the attic and grab Ike by the arms.
AMERICAN SOLDIER
Yep, that's a Canadian alright.
IKE
Sibi mammama.
The American Soldier picks up Ike.
AMERICAN SOLDIER
So, thought you could hide from us, did
you?! Take him away!
The soldiers drag Ike down the stairs.
AMERICAN SOLDIER 2
Sir, look at this!
(Holding up a book)
He was writing some kind of diary...
AMERICAN SOLDIER
Diary?
What does it say?
AMERICAN SOLDIER 2
(Reading)
Cookie monster.
Banana.
Sweeping, moving MUSIC STING.
Satan opens the door to find Saddam sleeping happily in his
cozy bed. He is only wearing little black g-string panties.
SATAN
(Whispering)
Have you finished?
Now we see that Kenny is standing at the foot of the bed. He
holds a gasoline can, and has just finished pouring the last
drops underneath the bed.
KENNY
Mph mph.
SATAN
Then move out of the way.
Kenny walks over next to Satan. Satan pulls out a book of
matches.
SATAN
I must be strong... I must be strong...
Satan tries to light the match. It won't light.
SATAN
Damn it...
Finally, the match lights. Satan holds it up-
SATAN
Goodbye, Saddam...
-and throws it onto the bed.
SATAN
Come on!
Saddam burns to a crisp and Satan and Kenny run out.
