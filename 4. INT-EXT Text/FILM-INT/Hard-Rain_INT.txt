Nervous assistant bank manager WELLMAN is hurriedly tossing
stacks of money into two canvas bags.
A MAN'S SHADOW
Washes up on Wellman.
CHARLIE (O.S.)
Do you think you could go a little
faster, pal?
WELLMAN
I -- I'm going as fast as I can.
SECOND SHADOW COMES UP
TOM (O.S.)
Well, it's not fast enough.
Wellman is about to speak, then sees something, gulps.
A SHOTGUN
Is held by one of the men, pointed at the floor.
WELLMAN
Sweeps the money off the shelves and into the bags.
SECOND MAN (O.S.)
That it?
WELLMAN
Yes. We don't keep any of our --
THE TWO MEN
Ignore Wellman, grab the canvas bags and stride off.
Charlie gets into the driver's seat; Tom climbs into the
shotgun seat. They shut and bolt the doors. Charlie gets on
the radio.
CHARLIE
Dispatch, this is 31.
DISPATCHER (V.O.)
Go ahead, 31.
CHARLIE
We're leaving Huntingburg. We'll be
back in an hour.
DISPATCHER (V.O.)
Ten-four. Get out of there.
CHARLIE
We're gone. Over and out.
Charlie hangs up the radio. He starts writing on a clipboard.
Silence for a few moments, and then Charlie notices Tom
staring at him.
CHARLIE
What?
TOM
Your ear.
CHARLIE
What about my ear?
TOM
You've got a major hair growth going
on.
CHARLIE
Shut up.
TOM
I'm serious. You're gonna need
somebody to go in there with a weed
whacker.
Charlie grabs a donut bag off the seat and tosses it to Tom.
CHARLIE
Here.
TOM
You're offering me one of your donuts?
I don't know what to say. I'm getting
all misty.
CHARLIE
If it'll shut your mouth you can
have the whole bag.
Charlie starts the truck. Tom thinks about it, then tosses
the bag back.
TOM
Nah. I start eating donuts and I'll
never get out of this truck.
CHARLIE
(disgusted)
I love how you think you're better
than this.
TOM
Don't get me wrong, Charlie. There's
a lot to like about this job -- and
I don't just mean the dashing
polyester ensemble and the solid
three-figure income.
CHARLIE
(angry)
You ungrateful shit! I don't believe
you!
TOM
(surprised)
Charlie, relax! I was kidding!
CHARLIE
You don't wanna do this? Fine. Go
back to selling hot construction
machinery. That's a helluva career.
TOM
It had better hours.
Charlie slams the clipboard down on the seat.
CHARLIE
You think this is a joke? This is
funny? Jesus Christ! You know how
lucky you are you could get in here?
Thirty years old and all the crap
you pulled and you never got caught?
TOM
(angry)
That wasn't luck, old man. That was
skill. I was good at it.
CHARLIE
Oh, yeah, it takes a lot of skill to
fence bulldozers. That's goddamn
genius time.
TOM
About as much skill as it takes to
sit in a truck and get fat eating
donuts.
CHARLIE
Oh, so that's all I've been doing,
huh? Just wasting my life away.
TOM
I didn't say that.
CHARLIE
Yeah, building a home, raising a
family -- that's just stupid.
TOM
I didn't say that!
CHARLIE
You know what, Tom? I really don't
give a shit what you said.
Tom doesn't reply. Charlie puts the truck in gear; starts
off. Tom looks at Charlie, shakes his head -- what was that
about?
Writing letters in a crossword puzzle. Holding the pen is...
JIM
Late 50s, with a creased face and piercing eyes. He's sitting
at the bar, drinking coffee. Rain sheets down outside. The
BARTENDER watches TV, sound off. Next to Jim at the bar are...
RAY, KENNY AND MR. MEHLOR
Ray, 40s, has lank hair, rheumy eyes and a glass of Irish
whisky in front of him. Kenny, 20s, long hair, has the energy
of a puppy -- unfortunately he has about as much smarts as a
puppy. Mr. Mehlor. 40s, looks like -- and was -- a high school
teacher.
ON TV
Sound off, a MAN is crying about what he has lost in the
flood.
RAY
"Thus saith the Lord; Behold, waters
shall rise up out of the north and
be an overflowing flood and all the
inhabitants of the land shall howl."
Jeremiah 47:2.
Ray takes a drink. Kenny leans over to Ray, sotto.
KENNY
You're gonna be able to buy a helluva
lot of bibles, huh, Ray? Me? First
thing I'm gonna do is get my brother
a lawyer. Best that money can buy.
A thought comes to Jim -- an answer to a clue in the crossword --
and he starts filling in words as Ray and Kenny talk.
RAY
What's he facing?
KENNY
Thirty in.
RAY
He cap a cop or something...?
KENNY
Security guard. "In the commission..."
All he's got is a piece of shit P.D.
Now I'm gonna be able to afford him
a good lawyer -- a guy with a haircut.
Jim leans over to Kenny.
JIM
'Scuse me a second. Take a look at
thirty-one across.
Jim slides the newspaper in front of Kenny.
KENNY
Shit, Jim. I don't do crossword
puzzles.
MR. MEHLOR
I'll take a look, Jim.
JIM
Kenny can read.
(to Kenny)
Just look at it. You know when you
write down a word and suddenly it
looks all wrong? Maybe it's right,
but it doesn't look right?
Jim points at the newspaper.
JIM
Thirty-one across.
Kenny shrugs and looks down at the newspaper.
KENNY
(mumbles as he reads)
Mention money again and...
His eyes go wide.
ECU CROSSWORD PUZZLE
In an uncompleted part of the puzzle, Jim has written a
message in the boxes. It reads: MENTION MONEY AND I'LL KILL
YOU.
JIM AND KENNY
Kenny looks up at Jim. Jim glances over at the bartender
then back at Kenny. Understand?
JIM
Did I get it right?
KENNY
Yeah, Jim. You got it right.
Charlie and Tom continue to drive in silence. They both sneak
looks at each other. Their eyes meet for a second, then they
look away. A moment's pause then...
TOM
Jerk.
CHARLIE
Jack-ass.
A hint of a smile on both of them. Tom reaches for Charlie.
TOM
Give us a kiss. Come on.
Charlie goes red in the face, pushes Tom away.
CHARLIE
Get out of here.
TOM
(laughs, beat)
You really are a cranky old fart,
you know that?
CHARLIE
I'm sorry.
TOM
What was that about? I mean, I'm
just sitting here and all of a sudden
you go postal on me.
CHARLIE
I don't know, I... It's just this
weather. I... I want to get back.
TOM
You know, I really do appreciate
what you've done for me. This is a
good job.
CHARLIE
No, it's not. It stinks. It's putting
your life on the line for someone
else's money.
Tom glances ahead and sees that the road is covered in water.
TOM
Jesus. Where's the road?
THEIR POV
Stretching out ahead of them are reflector bars on the
telephone poles, a few feet above the rippling surface of
the floodwater.
CHARLIE
It's there.
(beat)
Somewhere. I hope.
(beat)
Look, Tom, I don't care what it is
you end up doing.
TOM
Oh, God, here we go again.
CHARLIE
This is the last time, I swear.
Tom sees something ahead. He doesn't understand at first.
HIS POV
The reflector bar on the pole two poles ahead is lower than
the others. No reflector bars for a hundred yards, then they
resume.
CHARLIE
(looks at Tom)
I just think, whatever it is you do,
it's time you did some heavy lifting.
Tom figures out what's going on with the reflector bars.
TOM
Stop!
CHARLIE
No, you gotta hear this. You're better
than --
TOM
Stop the truck! We're going down!
OUTSIDE THE TRUCK
The water rises fast up the grille as the truck angles down.
INSIDE THE TRUCK
CHARLIE
Jesus!
Charlie stands on the brakes.
THEIR POV
A wave of water rushes forward from the truck, then comes
back and washes over the hood, splashing up on the windshield.
TOM
Back up!
Charlie throws the truck into reverse but gives it too much
power. They hear the rear wheels spinning underwater. Charlie
eases off, the tires start to catch, they start moving
backwards.
Charlie and Tom exchange a quick look of relief... and then
the engine dies. Charlie tries to restart it, but there's
nothing.
OUTSIDE THE TRUCK
It's stopped on a downgrade -- it's a dip in the road.
The water is up to the top of the front tires: up to the
hubcaps on the rear wheels. The headlights are underwater,
spots of yellow glowing. They've stopped next to a lighted
sign.
CLOSE ON SIGN
WELCOME TO HUNTINGBURG.
HOME OF THE 1987 STATE CHAMPION WARRIORS.
IN THE TRUCK
CHARLIE
Goddammit!
TOM
It's a little dip in the road or
something. You can see the reflectors
come up the other side.
CHARLIE
(curses to himself)
I knew this would happen.
(grabs radio mike)
TOM
I'll see if there's anyone coming.
Maybe we can get pulled out.
Tom opens the door. Charlie adjusts the radio frequency
selection button; clicks on.
CHARLIE
Dispatch, this is 31. 31 calling
dispatch.
DISPATCHER (V.O.)
(over radio)
31, this is dispatch.
CHARLIE
(into radio)
Dispatch, we're stuck outside of
Huntingburg. Truck's dead.
DISPATCHER (V.O.)
Where are you?
CHARLIE
We're on 231, headed for the
Interstate. Right by a sign saying
"Welcome to Huntingburg."
Tom climbs out and up on top of the truck.
OUTSIDE THE TRUCK
Tom stands on top of the truck. In one direction, nothing
but blackness. The other way he can see the lights of the
town. But there are no cars coming.
IN THE TRUCK
Charlie looks over as Tom appears, upside-down, in the
doorway.
TOM
The town's been evacuated. We won't
get any help from there.
CHARLIE
Dispatch can't get anyone out.
TOM
They are aware we're carrying a
shitload of money...?
CHARLIE
They called the National Guard.
They're gonna be here in about ninety
minutes.
TOM
Ninety minutes? Jesus.
CHARLIE
(nods; into radio)
Dispatch, we're gonna need help a
little sooner than --
There's a sudden sparking sound and the radio cuts out and
interior lights and the headlights go out.
TOM
Oh, shit.
Looking out as the Sheriff's car rolls past on the water-
covered street. A HAND lets go of a curtain and it swings
across the window.
A glass window is smashed and water floods into the boat
showroom. Jim and his men stride in. Kenny ogles a
particularly nice cruiser. Jim stops at a smallish ski-boat.
JIM
Here we go.
KENNY
(re: cruiser)
What about this monster?
JIM
(re: ski-boat)
This is all we need.
RAY
Shit, Jim, we're stealing. Can't we
take anything we want?
JIM
The water isn't very deep yet. We
need something with a low draft. Mr.
Mehlor -- find us some gasoline.
Mr. Mehlor heads off.
KENNY
Sees something else he likes. We don't see what it is.
KENNY
Oh, Jim...?
Tom wades through the classroom, pushing floating desks aside.
Flashlight beams stab into the room. Tom hurries to the hall.
Tom makes his way past banks of lockers, trying to get as
far as he can from the probing flashlight beams.
Tom tries lockers, looking for a place to hide.
Tom ducks down as...
A FIREBALL
Shoots over him.
KENNY AND RAY
Ride the jet-skis into the flooded school.
UNDERWATER
Tom is swimming as hard as he can, out of breath. KENNY AND
RAY
Ray goes off down a hall while Kenny idles in the lobby.
TOM
Surfaces, gasping.
KENNY
Hears the gasp, turns, grinning.
KENNY
Enemy sub off the port bow!
TOM
Gets to his feet runs as fast as he can down the hall. He
rounds a corner and keeps going.
KENNY
Guns his engine and takes off after Tom.
TOM
Runs another thirty feet, then trips on something and goes
down.
KENNY
Comes around the corner, grinning when he sees...
TOM
Halfway down the hall, standing frozen, caught in Kenny's
light.
KENNY
Guns it, racing forward down the hall toward Tom.
KENNY
Full steam ahead!
THE JET-SKI
Hits something underwater and stops.
KENNY
Keeps going. He flies through the air, slams headfirst into
a trophy case and drops into the water.
TOM
Stands up -- he was kneeling.
TOM
Low tide, sailor.
A HANDRAIL
On the wall, angles down into the water. Underwater there
are a couple of steps leading up to a change in level in the
hall -- that's what the jet-ski grounded on.
HALLWAY
Ray motors down the hallway toward the corner.
RAY
Kenny?
HIS POV
Around the corner comes a jet-ski. Ray assumes it's Kenny.
RAY
See him?
Then the jet-ski speeds up and shoots by him. Ray sees it's...
TOM
Wearing Kenny's hat and jacket.
RAY
Gives chase.
SCHOOL HALLWAYS
Ray races after Tom along the flooded hallways, taking the
turns fast. Ray pulls a gun, starts shooting.
TOM'S POV
Tearing through the halls, flashlight lighting the way.
Bullets hit the walls, ceiling, water around him.
TOM
Comes around a corner, sees the open front doors ahead of
him.
JIM AND MR. MEHLOR
Come into view in the ski-boat, blocking the exit.
TOM
Turns hard and speeds down a side hall.
TOM'S POV
A wall of windows at the end. No way out. Trapped. Then...
KENNY
Rises out of the water, blood running down his face, pistol
up.
TOM
Looks back.
RAY
Is on his tail.
TOM
Makes his choice and guns the jet-ski straight at Kenny.
TOM
Yee-hah!
KENNY
Fires, misses and is knocked to the side as...
TOM
Hunches down on the jet-ski and crashes through the windows.
Tom walks through a small room lined with closed cupboards.
He goes through a door.
Tom comes out into the altar. He looks around, impressed.
It's a beautiful church. Scaffolding goes up one wall -- the
church is being restored. Tom is startled by a sound from
above. He grabs a heavy silver candlestick as a weapon and
looks up to see...
BIRDS
Fluttering up in the rafters.
TOM
Takes a breath. Just as he relaxes, he hears a whooshing
sound from behind him and turns to see...
A LARGE CRUCIFIX
Being swung at his head. Thunk and...
THE SCREEN GOES BLACK
FADE IN:
Tom slowly regains consciousness, blinking his eyes. He
hears...
SHERIFF (O.S.)
What are you doing here?
But the Sheriff isn't asking Tom, he's asking...
KAREN
30, pretty, even in head-to-toe rain gear.
KAREN
I was setting up pumps.
WAYNE
I sure as hell don't get what you
see in that church.
KAREN
I wouldn't expect you to, Wayne.
WAYNE
What's that supposed to mean?
SHERIFF
Karen, did you think the order was
for everyone but you to evacuate?
KAREN
I was gonna go as soon as I filled
the pumps, but the next thing I know,
I've got a looter on my hands. Now,
maybe I'm crazy, but I was expecting
a little gratitude?
PHIL
I think it's great what you did.
WAYNE
That's it, Phil. That'll finally get
you into her pants.
PHIL
Shut up.
SHERIFF
What if he'd had a gun, Karen? A lot
of these looters carry guns.
TOM (O.S.)
I'm not a looter.
TOM
Sits up on a cot, behind bars in the holding cell, woozy.
Jim and his men are searching the school for the money.
RAY
Jim, it could be anywhere. It might
not even be in the school.
JIM
Keep looking.
The Sheriff, Phil, Wayne and Karen stand outside the cell.
Tom is inside, on the cot. He touches the cut on his forehead.
WAYNE
What were you doing at the church?
KAREN
I told you -- he was looting it.
TOM
I just said I'm not a looter!
(to Karen)
You're the one who nailed me?
(Karen nods)
You got a better arm than my ex-wife.
What the hell did you hit me with --
a statue? I saw a flash of some guy
coming at me.
KAREN
(mumbles, embarrassed)
It was a crucifix.
(to others)
It was the only thing there!
TOM
Oh, great. Now I'm gonna have people
coming from around the world to see
the face of Jesus on my forehead.
SHERIFF
Look, son, what were you doing in
the church?
TOM
Looking for a place to hide out.
WAYNE
From who -- Swamp Thing?
TOM
The bastards who killed my partner.
That stops the room.
TOM
We were driving an armored truck.
The truck got stuck out past the
high school. They must've picked up
our call to dispatch, 'cause they
knew where we were. Charlie and I
were just standing there and all
hell broke loose.
SHERIFF
How much money did you have?
TOM
A little over three million.
They all exchange a look -- that's a lot of money.
TOM
The bank was afraid of looters. They
had us cleaning out their branches
up and down the river.
WAYNE
They stole three million dollars?
SHERIFF
No, I don't think so.
They all look at the Sheriff. He looks at Tom.
SHERIFF
You took the money, didn't you.
TOM
I hid it in the cemetery. Tied it to
a crypt for a guy named Portman.
WAYNE
What the hell'd you do that for?
TOM
I don't like to carry around that
much cash.
SHERIFF
Jesus, Wayne, use your head. If he
hadn't hidden it, they woulda killed
him, too.
The Sheriff looks at Tom -- is that it? Tom nods.
SHERIFF
You got any ID?
TOM
No, it was in my jacket and I --
WAYNE
Color me surprised.
The Sheriff thinks for a beat, then tosses some keys to Phil.
SHERIFF
Get out two rifles and a shotgun.
Phil nods and goes to it. The Sheriff opens a desk drawer,
pulls out an ankle holster.
WAYNE
You believe him?
SHERIFF
Well, yes, Wayne, I do. And even if
I didn't, I'd say we sure as hell
had an obligation to check it out,
don't you think?
The Sheriff starts strapping on the ankle holster.
TOM
I'll go with you. I can show you
where --
SHERIFF
No, I think you better stay put. But
that was --
WAYNE
Yeah, all we need is an armored car
guy helping us out.
The Sheriff thwacks Wayne in the ear.
WAYNE
Ow!
SHERIFF
Wayne, what's the worst that's ever
happened to you? When old Mrs. Dugan
went after you with a knife? This
guy just got shot at!
(dismisses Wayne; to
Tom)
Smart move with the money.
Phil comes over with the guns.
SHERIFF
(to Phil)
Wayne and I'll check out the cemetery.
You escort Slugger...
(nods at Karen)
...out of town. Get her to some high
ground, then come on back.
The Sheriff jams a small pistol into his ankle holster.
KAREN
I have to fill the pumps --
SHERIFF
(pulling her out)
Not any more you don't.
The Sheriff straightens up, grabs a rifle from Phil and pulls
Karen to the door. Wayne goes to Tom's cell door and pulls
it shut with a click.
SHERIFF
Wayne...
WAYNE
He could still be lying!
The Sheriff rolls his eyes and gestures for Wayne to come
along. He opens the door for Karen, Wayne and Phil to go
through.
TOM
Sheriff -- they killed my partner
without any warning.
SHERIFF
And they're gonna regret that, I
guarantee you. They're gonna regret
coming anywhere near this town
tonight. And out he goes.
Tom hears boat engines start up and move away. He lays back
down on the cot, listening to the rain.
Empty. Light comes out from under the door to the bathroom.
Hank is on the can reading a copy of "American Survivalist"
magazine. An odd reaction comes over his face. He feels
something weird. He looks down.
ON THE FLOOR
Water is seeping in under the door.
HANK
Holy shit!
The bathroom door flies open and Hank waddles out, pants
around his feet. He shuffles fast to the control wheels and
starts spinning them.
Hank pulls up his pants as he gets on the radio.
HANK
Sheriff! Sheriff!
HANK
(on the radio)
Sheriff, come in!
Tom hears the sound and opens his eyes -- what the hell is
that?
TOM SITS UP, SWINGING HIS LEGS OVER THE SIDE OF THE COT. HE
REACTS, LOOKS DOWN. HIS POV
There's two feet of water in the station.
Tom looks over, stunned, to see... THE DOOR
As a fine stream spits in through the keyhole.
THE WINDOWS
Are heaving as the water rises up against them.
TOM
Gets to his feet, woozy and goes to get out of the cell. He
remembers -- uh-oh: the cell door is locked.
The water level inside is rising fast. It hits the wall
sockets and there's a spit of sparks, then all the desk lamps
go dark. Light still comes from overhead fluorescent panels.
Tom sees...
TWO KEYS ON A KEY RING
Laying on the Sheriff's wooden desk. They're four feet away --
too far to reach.
Tom looks through the cell bars at wooden chairs bobbing in
the water. The Sheriff's desk lifts up, starts floating. Tom
gets an idea. He takes his belt off.
Tom holds one end of the belt and tosses the rest of it at...
THE DESK
Bobbing in the rising water. He misses the keys.
TOM AND THE DESK
Tom tries again. The belt lands on the desk top.
Tom very gently starts pulling. Too hard; the belt starts
slipping off the desk. He gets it just right and the desk
starts moving toward Tom. He reaches out with his hand,
stretching.
HIS FINGERS
Touch the top of the desk, start pulling it toward him, and
he just gets a firm grip on the desk when...
THE TELEPHONE POLE
Smashes into a window, bending in the bars on the window,
shattering the glass, letting a torrent of water into the
room.
THE DESK
Is moved by the rush of water, but not before Tom grabs...
THE KEYS
And grips them tight.
TOM
Tries the keys in the lock. They don't fit. He looks at them.
CU KEYS
The tag is emblazoned with the Ford logo.
TOM
Great! I can drive out of here!
Tom tosses the keys into the water and looks around at...
THE WATER LEVEL
Rising very fast. A foot in ten seconds.
TOM
Climbs up the cell bars, the water rising with him. He's
running out of room between himself and the ceiling. Three
feet. Two feet. He's being pushed up by the water toward...
FLUORESCENT LIGHT FIXTURE
On the ceiling, caged in a wire cover.
TOM
Is terrified, about to die. The water rises up past his face.
TOM'S HANDS
Pull his Maglite flashlight from his belt. He takes off the
lens and the battery cap, then shakes the batteries out.
TOM
Sticks the flashlight tube up through the wire grate over
the light fixture.
He blows out the water -- like clearing a snorkel -- then
breathes. Reprieve for a few moments and then...
THE WATER
Reaches the top of the flashlight tube and starts to trickle
in when...
THE FLUORESCENT LIGHT FIXTURE
Goes dark. In the darkness, there's the sound of tubes
breaking and metal being wrenched.
TOM
Looks up, astonished, to see...
THE FLUORESCENT FIXTURE
Being lifted up and away from above. Streetlight comes in,
silhouetting...
A FIGURE
Standing on the roof. The figure leans down and starts tugging
at the wire cage over the inside of the fixture. In the light,
Tom sees that it's...
KAREN
And she's pulling as hard as she can, but the wire cage isn't
budging. She pulls out a Swiss Army knife, unfolds a small
knife and starts taking out the screws holding the cage in
place. She gets two screws out.
TOM
Pulls on the cage and it swings down. He climbs up it.
The window glass tumbles in. Tom reaches in, undoes the latch
and slides up the window. He climbs in, straddling the window
sill. The camera moves down Tom's leg to show...
A WOLF TRAP
Laying on the floor, just below the window.
TOM
Is oblivious. He starts to put his foot down into the trap.
Just then he knocks...
A POTTED CACTUS
Off the windowsill. It falls straight down into...
THE WOLF TRAP
Hitting the trigger. The jaws snap, obliterating the cactus.
TOM
Jesus Christ!
A SHOTGUN BARREL
Snaps into view, pointing right at Tom's head.
WOMAN (O.S.)
You so much as breathe funny and
your head is going back out that
window without you.
Doreen holds the shotgun on Tom and Karen as they move away
from the window, hands raised.
DOREEN
Real slow now. Like you were in a
big jar of molasses. That's it.
They hear footsteps coming down old wood stairs.
MAN (O.S.)
Doreen? You haven't killed anybody,
have you?
DOREEN
I've got everything under control,
Henry. You go back up.
Henry enters.
HENRY
Jesus, Doreen, you caught a whole
gang.
Henry and Doreen have brought everything into their attic --
a TV, some silver and china, bowling trophies. A Coleman
lantern lights the room.
DOREEN
(sarcastic)
Well, isn't that just wonderful! Now
these bastards are gonna want to
kill us, too! Why the hell did you
have to come to this house?
KAREN
We thought it was empty.
DOREEN
You know what? The house next door
is empty. So whaddya say we go back
downstairs and you two keep moving?
HENRY
We are not going to send these people
out to the wolves.
DOREEN
Oh, we're not, are we? Then what's
your plan, General Schwartzkopf?
HENRY
I -- I just don't think --
TOM
It's okay. I have to go anyway.
They look at him, surprised.
TOM
The National Guard'll be at the truck
in about fifteen minutes. I'm gonna
go wait for them.
DOREEN
You can't swim that far in fifteen
minutes.
HENRY
He could take our boat.
DOREEN
Henry!
HENRY
(to Tom)
I'll go get it ready for you.
DOREEN
Henry, he is not taking our boat.
Henry ignores Doreen. He pushes the attic stairs down, heads
down them.
DOREEN
(grabs TV; to Tom)
Here. You want a TV too? How about
some china? Maybe our silver?
(sets TV down)
Henry! Henry, you leave the boat
where it is!
Doreen heads off down the stairs. Tom starts down the stairs,
stops.
TOM
Karen?
(she looks at him)
I'm Tom.
They shake hands.
KAREN
Watch yourself, Tom. I really don't
wanna have to save your life again.
Tom nods and goes down the stairs.
Hank is on the radio.
HANK
I'd love to help you, Sheriff, but I
can't leave! If the water goes over
the top again it's bye-bye, dam! Bye-
bye, town! In fact, I could use a
little help up here myself.
Tom shuts the door. He piles the weapons on a shelf. He sees
Jim touch his head.
TOM
That hurt?
JIM
Yeah.
TOM
Good.
Jim and Tom are by one of the stained glass windows, looking
out through a pale-colored pane at the Sheriff and his men
across the street. They watch Hank race off.
JIM
Does he have the girl?
TOM
(shakes head)
She's in the small boat.
Tom touches the wound on his head.
TOM
Jesus, I'm gonna get hepatitis.
JIM
Hepatitis, hell. You probably already
got cholera.
Tom gives Jim a look then starts for the back of the church.
JIM
What're you doing?
TOM
There's a back room.
(touches wound)
Maybe they've got something I can
use on this.
JIM
You been in here before?
TOM
(bad memory)
Oh, yeah.
JIM
What happened?
TOM
I saw Jesus.
Jim is by the window, looking out at the Sheriff and Wayne
across the street in the shadows. He turns as...
TOM
Enters from the back. He's got a bottle of rubbing alcohol
and a towel. He splashes some of the alcohol on the towel,
then touches it to his wound. It hurts like a sonofabitch.
After a beat...
TOM
So, has this all gone pretty much
how you thought it would?
Jim turns on Tom.
JIM
Everything would have gone fine if
you'd've just walked away from the
truck.
TOM
Oh, yeah? Well, everything would've
gone even better if you hadn't decided
to rob the damn truck in the first
place!
Jim looks away. After another silence...
TOM
Did Charlie have cancer or something?
JIM
You mean why was he doing this?
(thinks, shrugs)
No cancer.
(beat)
Didn't you ever think about taking
the money?
TOM
No.
JIM
Come now. A man who used to make his
living fencing hot jackhammers never
thought about what he'd do with three
million dollars?
TOM
Sorry to disappoint you.
(beat)
What are you gonna do with it?
JIM
As little as possible.
Silence for a few moments, then...
TOM
Belize.
Jim looks at him.
TOM
It's this small country in Central
America, on the Atlantic side.
JIM
I know where Belize is. What about
it?
TOM
They speak English and the dollar
goes a long way. Beautiful beaches;
friendly people. And they've got
liberal banking laws. Very liberal.
JIM
No, you didn't think about taking
that money at all.
TOM
(busted)
You can't ride in the truck and not
think about it.
JIM
I'm sure. And I guess that's pretty
much how it started with Charlie.
Tom thinks, nods and presses the towel to his wound again.
Tom watches Wayne drive off with Karen.
TOM
Shit. Where's he going?
Tom grabs a rifle, frustrated and angry.
Tom finishes reloading a gun.
JIM
What -- you're gonna swim after her?
Tom doesn't answer. He moves toward the front door. Jim cuts
him off.
JIM
You ain't gonna help her by getting
shot. He's gone and you don't know
where.
TOM
The Sheriff knows. I think maybe
I'll go ask him.
JIM
You'll be dead before you get over
the sandbags.
(beat)
Look, he'll be coming for us. You
can ask him then.
Jim sees something out the window.
TOM
What if he doesn't come?
JIM
I wouldn't worry about that.
Tom sees what Jim sees.
THEIR POV
The Sheriff, Phil and Hank are heading toward the church,
flaming Molotov cocktails in their hands.
Tom and Jim duck down as...
THE BOTTLE
Flies across the inside of the church and smashes against a
wall, sending sheets of fire down the wall.
Karen is unconscious. Wayne has her laying on the stairs
leading up from the entry area to the second floor. There's
three feet of water in the house. Karen's legs are in the
water. Her hands are handcuffed to a railing attached to the
wall, running up the stairs. Wayne stands over Karen, pats
her face.
WAYNE
Wakey-wakey.
Karen stirs, then starts slipping back into unconsciousness,
so Wayne splashes her face with water. Karen comes to,
sputtering. Her eyes focus. She looks up at Wayne. Wayne
grins.
WAYNE
Dear Penthouse: I always thought
your letters were fake, until the
wildest thing happened to me. I'm a
policeman in a small town. In the
middle of the big flood last year, I
was patrolling the streets in a boat,
feeling kind of sorry for myself --
'cause it was my birthday and all --
when I saw the front door to a house
was open. I pulled my gun -- afraid
it might be looters. Imagine my
surprise when, instead of a looter,
I find a young woman handcuffed to
the railing of her stairs. Her name
was Karen, and ever since she came
back from college she'd made it clear
she was too good for any of us local
folk. Now here she was, in handcuffs!
I said, "What the heck is going on
here, ma'am?" And she said...
Karen says nothing. Wayne leans in close.
WAYNE
And she said...
KAREN
Sorry, Wayne, but I'm not playing a
part in your sick little play.
Wayne pulls his gun, puts it to Karen's head.
WAYNE
You're perfect for the role. I suggest
you reconsider.
KAREN
Or what? You'll kill me? You're gonna
do that anyway.
WAYNE
I might get clumsy. It might take a
while.
KAREN
I'm sure you can hurt me. But it's
all going to be the same when I'm
dead.
Wayne straightens up, looks at her, then launches back into
it.
WAYNE
And she said, "Happy Birthday, Wayne.
I've got something for you." Well,
I'm not stupid. I knew what she wanted
to give me and I knew she wanted to
give it bad, so I --
THE OVERHEAD LIGHT
Sparks and goes out.
WAYNE
(looks up at light)
That won't do. Man's gotta see what
he's doing. 'Scuse me.
Wayne heads off for the kitchen. The second he's gone...
KAREN
Raises her hips and digs a hand into her pocket and pulls
out her Swiss Army knife. She pries open the big blade. She
hears Wayne sloshing back toward her. She gets back into the
position Wayne left her in as...
WAYNE
Re-enters carrying two burning candles in candle-holders.
WAYNE
I got the candles. All's we need is
a cake.
He sets the candles down on a dry step above Karen's head.
He leans in close.
WAYNE
Mood lighting. You in the mood yet?
(no answer from Karen;
back into Penthouse
letter)
And then she said, "My present's
ready and waiting. All's you gotta
do is unwrap it."
Wayne reaches into the water, undoes Karen's rain pants,
yanks off her shoes, then pulls off her pants. He throws
them over the banister. Karen remains passive, blank. Wayne
takes off his holster; hangs it on the banister. Then he
pushes his pants down to his ankles. His shirttail is long
enough so that we don't have to see his wretched little
pecker. He climbs on top of Karen in the water, brings his
face close to hers.
WAYNE
It was cold and rainy that birthday
night, and all I wanted was to get
someplace warm and dry. As it turned
out, what I really wanted was
something warm and wet. Wayne grins
and closes for a kiss and...
KAREN'S HAND
Moves fast with the knife and...
WAYNE'S EYES
Pop open wide.
WAYNE
His head jerks back. He tries to shout, but all that comes
out is an awful gurgle. He tries to push off Karen, but...
KAREN
Wraps her legs around him, holds him close, pinning him.
WAYNE
Finally breaks free. He tries to stop the bleeding with a
hand, but the blood spurts through his fingers. He reaches
for his gun in his holster on the banister, but just as he
grabs it...
KAREN
Lashes out of the water with her legs, kicking Wayne in the
groin, pushing him back.
WAYNE
Tries to get his balance, but his feet can't move -- his
pants are around his ankles. He falls back into the water,
firing his pistol.
BULLETS
Blow chunks out of the wall next to Karen, hit the ceiling
and...
WAYNE
Is floating on his back, trying to lift the pistol, but his
strength is fading fast. He gets off one last shot and...
THE CANDLE
Nearest Karen is blown to pieces.
WAYNE
The gun drops into the water. No more shots. No more life.
He floats, pants around his ankles, covered in blood, dead.
KAREN
Happy Birthday, Wayne.
Jim and Tom hear a creaking and look up.
THE CEILING
The fire has eaten holes in the roof. Embers come down.
A small chunk of burning ceiling drops down. Jim and Tom
look up. Just then...
BRIGHT LIGHT
Floods into the church through...
THE STAINED GLASS WINDOWS
Filling the church with a kaleidoscope of colors.
TOM AND JIM
Look out the windows.
TOM
My God they're beautiful.
THE STAINED GLASS WINDOWS
Remain beautiful for a few more seconds until they shatter
and blow inwards as...
THE SHERIFF'S BOAT AND HANK'S BOAT
Come crashing through.
THE BOATS
Land, stop fast. The Sheriff's boat lands closer to the
pulpit; Hank's boat closer to the balcony.
THE SHERIFF, HANK AND PHIL
Look around. It's quiet for a moment. There's no sign of Tom
and Jim.
Karen has her pants back on. She reaches out with one foot
and hooks Wayne's holster off the banister. She flips it
through the air and catches it with her hands. She opens
little leather pockets -- mace, more bullets. No keys. Karen
starts to panic.
KAREN
There have to be keys. There --
She sees...
WAYNE
Still floating on his back, still dead. She looks closer
at...
WAYNE'S PANTS
Bunched around his ankles. And there, hanging from a belt-
loop is a ring of keys.
KAREN
Reaches out with her foot for Wayne's pants. She can't reach.
WAYNE
Is slowly drifting out the open door. Beyond the door, in
the light of the streetlamp, the water is riffling, moving,
and Wayne is heading toward it.
KAREN
Slides down further on the stairs, into the water, then stops.
CLOSE ON HANDCUFFS AND RAILING
There are metal supports going from the railing to the wall,
every three feet. Karen is prevented from going any further
down the stairs by one of these supports.
KAREN
Reaches out with a foot, straining, stretching her body,
almost dislocating her shoulder and...
HER FOOT
Just barely touches one of Wayne's feet, but then Wayne's
foot slips away and...
KAREN
Can only watch as...
WAYNE
Drifts out the door and is pulled away by the current.
The Sheriff, Phil and Wayne scan the water, looking for
movement.
SHERIFF
Where are they?! Jesus!
UNDERWATER POV
Looking up through a tangle of floating pews at the wavering
silhouettes of the boats and the men in them against the
burning timbers above.
TWO PISTOLS
Come into view, pointed up through the water.
ON THE WATER
The Sheriff, Phil and Hank have let down their guard for a
second when there's a series of dull, muted clacks from
underwater as...
BULLETS
Come streaking out of the water, winging by them, plugging
into the boats.
UNDERWATER
Jim fires the pistols, the bullets' bubble streaks knifing
up through the water.
THE SHERIFF, PHIL AND HANK
hit the deck in their boats, returning fire over the gunwales.
TOM
Surfaces over by the stairs up to the balcony, gasping for
air. He runs for the stairs.
BLAZING TIMBERS
Start to fall from the burning roof frame, hitting the water
with loud sizzling hisses.
THE SHERIFF, PHIL AND HANK
Turn to shoot at tom through the dropping flaming debris.
TOM
Disappears up the stairs, the bullets just missing him.
UNDERWATER
Jim runs out of bullets. He's long since run out of air. He
drops his guns and swims under the pews.
HANK
Looks up, realizing that Tom will be able to shoot down on
him. He reverses his boat fast under the balcony as...
TOM
Shoots down from the balcony, blowing a chunk out of the
prow of Hank's boat.
The water is up to Karen's chin. Her hands are working
frantically beneath the water.
UNDERWATER
She's using the tip of the knife blade to unscrew the screws
holding the support to the railing. She's on the last one.
The blade slips, misses, gets a quarter turn, another quarter
turn...
KAREN
Spits out the water that spills into her mouth.
UNDERWATER
Another quarter-turn and the screw is loose enough to turn
by hand.
KAREN
Holds her breath with the water touching her nose. She gets
the screw loose, pulls up on the railing and pulls the
handcuff through the gap between the support and the railing.
The Sheriff turns to Phil and nods re: Jim.
SHERIFF
You take care of him!
The Sheriff aims at the balcony as Phil scans the water,
looking for Jim.
UNDERWATER
Jim pulls an electrical cord out of a wall socket.
ON THE BALCONY
Tom ducks down as the Sheriff's bullets start plugging through
the wood front of the balcony. Tom moves away from the bullet
strikes, splashing through the water in the balcony.
CLOSE ON BALCONY FLOOR
As BANG BANG BANG -- bullets start shooting up from below.
HANK
Is firing up at Tom through the floor of the balcony.
TOM
Jumps back, startled, looking down at...
THE BALCONY FLOOR
Holes explode in the floor, sending up small geysers of water.
The water then starts whirlpooling down through the holes.
TOM
Moves back from hank's advancing bullet holes.
THE SHERIFF
Keeps firing.
TOM
Is caught between Hank's bullets and the Sheriff's bullets.
So he racks a load in the shotgun and dives backwards off
the balcony.
HANK
Is still shooting up as...
TOM
Arcs off the balcony, firing the shotgun under the balcony
at Hank.
HANK
Dives to the floor of his boat as Tom's shotgun blasts blow
plate-sized holes in the church doors.
TOM
Lands in the water and goes under.
THE SHERIFF AND PHIL
Look for Tom in the water.
HANK
Starts to get up from the bottom of his boat, searching for
a clip for his gun.
THE SHERIFF
Sees Tom's shape in the water and is about to shoot when...
JIM
Jumps up out of the water with the electrical cord. He tosses
a loop of the cord around the Sheriff's neck and pulls,
yanking the Sheriff out of the boat.
TOM
Comes out of the water, aiming his shotgun at...
PHIL
Who is aiming his pistol at Tom. Phil freezes.
THE SHERIFF AND JIM
Struggle in the water. Jim pulls the cord tightly around the
Sheriff's neck as the Sheriff tries to get a shot off at Jim --
he can't get the barrel pointed at Jim.
HANK
Fumbles with the bullet clip.
HANK
(to Phil)
Kill him!
TOM
Turns his shotgun on Hank and pulls the trigger -- click. Uh-
oh.
HANK
Kill him!
TOM AND PHIL
Exchange a look.
HANK
Slams the clip into his gun and levels it at Tom.
PHIL
Points his gun at Hank.
PHIL
No! We can't --
BANG! and hank shoots Phil. Phil pitches back out of the
Sheriff's boat.
PHIL
Lands between Jim and the Sheriff, knocking them apart.
THE SHERIFF
Is free of Jim's grasp. He shakes off the electrical cord
and turns to shoot...
JIM
Who moves a little faster. He grabs Phil's pistol and puts
it to the Sheriff's head before the Sheriff can bring his
gun around.
HANK
Draws a bead on Jim and is about to shoot when...
TOM
Comes out of the water on the other side of Hank's boat. Tom
pushes down hard on the side of the boat.
HANK
Is rocked back, thrown off balance. He starts to spin and
bring his gun around when...
TOM
Swings with the shotgun, catching...
HANK
In the side of the head. Hank crumples and falls into the
water, taking his rifle with him.
JIM AND THE SHERIFF
Jim nods at the Sheriff's rifle.
JIM
In the boat.
THE SHERIFF
Hesitates, then tosses his rifle into the boat.
TOM
Grabs Hank's rifle and aims it at the Sheriff.
TOM
Where's Karen?
Karen undoes a last screw in a metal support.
She pulls the handcuff through the gap between the support
and railing. She's at the top of the stairs.
THE END OF THE RAILING
Curves and goes into the wall.
KAREN
Tugs at the railing, tries rocking it up and down. It doesn't
budge. She starts chipping at the plaster with the knife.
KAREN
God, I am really beginning to hate
fine craftsmanship.
THE WATER
It's up to her chest.
The Sheriff hesitates.
TOM
Where is she?
SHERIFF
They went back to her house.
TOM
Where's her house?
SHERIFF
It's --
And just then they all hear something truly ominous -- a
siren pierces the night.
She reacts to the siren -- uh-oh.
The siren wails.
JIM
What in God's name is that?
SHERIFF
Hank?
HANK
(woozy but okay)
It's topped out.
SHERIFF
How much time we got?
HANK
How should I know?
SHERIFF
Guess!
HANK
It's an old dam! Not long.
SHERIFF
(to Tom)
Then I'd say you boys better drop
your guns.
TOM
What?
SHERIFF
That's the deal! You let me and Hank
go -- with a few of these bags --
and I'll tell you where to find Karen.
JIM
(to the Sheriff)
Get out of the boat.
TOM
Hold on.
Jim turns to look at Tom.
JIM
Hold on?
SHERIFF
It's the only way you're gonna find
her!
TOM
It's only a couple of bags.
JIM
No.
TOM
But I thought --
JIM
Look, I don't know what you thought
but I told you, I'm here for the
money; that's all.
Tom doesn't know what to do. The Sheriff looks pretty pleased
with himself. He might just get out of this. And then...
PHIL (O.S.)
She lives on Boyd Street.
They all look over at...
PHIL
Alive, but barely.
PHIL
Three over. Two-story, blue shutters.
TOM
Looks at Jim, disappointed, angry, then hurries to Hank's
boat.
JIM
Climbs into the Sheriff's boat.
TOM
Climbs into Hank's boat. He starts the engine, looks down
at...
PHIL
Floating in the water, dying. A brief look between them,
then...
TOM
Drives the boat out through a shattered window.
JIM
Pushes the Sheriff out of the boat.
Jim keeps his gun leveled at the Sheriff and Hank, standing
in the water, as he pulls the money bags up from the forward
hold.
SHERIFF
So, you just gonna kill me?
JIM
Lord knows I should.
Jim opens a money bag and smiles at what he sees.
Karen tilts her head back to keep her lips and nose above
water. And then she hears a window smash. She turns as...
TOM
Wades in along the upper hall.
TOM
I'm guessing you can't get up.
KAREN
I'm handcuffed.
Tom reaches into the water for the railing.
KAREN
The railing's bolted to the wall.
He looks at her.
KAREN
I've got a saw.
TOM
Where?
KAREN
In the kitchen. In the tall cupboard
beside the --
And then they hear a sound more ominous than the siren --
they hear the siren stop.
TOM
Is that good or bad?
Jim, the Sheriff and Hank react to the silence. Jim looks
off.
THE SHERIFF
Drops underwater.
JIM
Turns back at the sound of the Sheriff going under.
UNDERWATER
The Sheriff pulls up his pant leg.
JIM
Is aiming his gun at the water and is about to fire as...
THE SHERIFF'S HAND
Comes out of the water shooting a pistol.
JIM
Is shot in the gut and the thigh and high on the chest and
he stumbles back, bellowing, and falls out of the Sheriff's
boat and into the water.
SHERIFF
You should've just killed me.
KAREN
You gotta go!
Tom starts hyperventilating.
KAREN
The dam's gone! You gotta go!
TOM
(shakes head)
I owe you one.
Tom breathes deep then ducks underwater.
UNDERWATER
Tom flicks on his flashlight and starts swimming down the
stairs.
KAREN
Watches Tom and his light get swallowed up in the murky water.
Phil is grabbing for the Sheriff's boat as the Sheriff and
Hank zoom out of the church, leaving him behind.
PHIL
NOOOO!
Tom swims down into the living room. His light shows a couch,
chairs, TV set. Books and newspapers are suspended in the
water.
Phil hears the roar. He looks around, lost.
The roar is building, getting louder. Phil sees something in
the water and reaches for it, frantically. He gets it. It's...
A BIBLE
And he clutches it to his chest as...
THE FLOOD
Hits the church.
Tom swims into the kitchen. He looks for the tall cupboard
by the fridge. He opens it.
INSIDE THE CUPBOARD
Hanging on a hook on the back wall is a saw. Tom grabs it.
Tom is threading his belt through the handle of the saw to
secure it. He gets it done and starts to swim out of the
kitchen.
BACK TO KAREN
Just Karen's lips and nose are above water.
IN THE KITCHEN
Tom is about to leave when everything starts to move --
rocking, from side to side, as if in a slow motion earthquake.
Cupboards and the fridge open and bottles and food and plates
tumble out.
Karen hears the groaning, ripping as the house tears free
from water and sewer lines. She's looking down for Tom when
there's a snap and the light above her goes out.
Karen doesn't have much time left. The water is washing over
her mouth and nose. And just as she's about to go under...
TOM
Swims in with the saw. He starts sawing on the handrail.
Everything's going fine. And then...
THE SAWBLADE
Snaps.
TOM AND KAREN
Look at each other. Oh no. Karen's going under.
TOM
Sees something. He dives into the water.
KAREN
Can only watch and wait. What's he doing? Oh, Jesus. And
then...
TOM
Surfaces, holding Wayne's pistol. He puts the mouth of the
barrel to the handcuff chain, shields Karen's face, looks
away and pulls the trigger.
