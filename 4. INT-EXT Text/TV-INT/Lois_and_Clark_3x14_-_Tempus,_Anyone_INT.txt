      small carpeted stage with a cheesy backdrop and some chairs.
      THREE THUGS and Tempus sorting through the sack of gold and

                                    MAJOR DOMO
                    You're amazing, Mr. Tempus, I mean,
                    how do you score this kinda swag
                    and there's not a cop after you,
                    not a bank with your picture in it?

                                    TEMPUS
                    Major Domo?  Can you keep a secret?

                                    MAJOR DOMO
                    Sure.

                                    TEMPUS
                    I have an inter-dimensional 
                    transport.  Right here in this 
                    building, actually.  And once a 
                    day, I pop out of this universe 
                    into an alternate one, take what 
                    I want and zip back here -- where I 
                    haven't so much as jaywalked.

      The guys just look at Tempus a second, then at each other, 
      then back at Tempus.  Domo bursts into laughter.  So does 
      Tempus.  Then so do the others.

                    Ahhh, Mr. Tempus, you kill me, I 
                    swear, if there's anybody funnier 
                    than you, I mean, hey, no wonder 
                    you wanna be on TV...

                                    TEMPUS
                    Oh, I don't want to be on TV to 
                    entertain... anymore than I want 
                    people to know I really own this 
                    station.

                           lovingly)
                    You see, TV is power.  The power to
                    lull, pacify...

                    jelly -- the power to _take_.

      office door, then REVEAL several new WHITE FOR MAYOR posters
      stacked nearby-- then PERRY WHITE himself steps right up to 
      a poster to give it the once-over.

      This Perry is a bit less dapper, more rumpled and denim-ed,
      like a 60's college professor.  But the poster has him in a 
      sharp suit and tie, hair artificially thickened.  Perry    (X)
      grimaces.

                    I look like Malvolean Dan Rather.            (X)

                                    WELLS
                    I know this is one in a series of
                    dreadful shocks --

                                    LOIS
                    But why -- ?

                                    WELLS
                    Obviously the Lois of this
                    dimension died before Clark arrived
                    in Metropolis.

                                    LOIS
                    And there's no Superman.  He didn't
                    even know who that was.

                                    WELLS
                    Oh, my.

      Lois watches as Lana and Clark move back to the elevators  (X)
      and Perry and Jimmy head back to the bullpen.

                    It doesn't matter.  We don't belong 
                    here and the only way we're getting 
                    back is with super-help.

                                    WELLS
                    Do you have a plan?

                    But first I need an excuse to team
                    up with Clark Kent.

      They move off toward Perry and Jimmy.

                    away and... ?

      She makes the flying motion with her hand.

                                    CLARK
                    Honey, nobody saw me.  I just used

                                    LOIS
                    Clark.  Please.  Help us get back
                    where we belong.

                                    WELLS
                    Yes.  Help us rid your world of
                    Tempus before he destroys it.

      As Clark's about to answer, Lana walks up.                 (X)

                                    LANA                         (X)
                    Clark?  Where've you been?

      Although she's talking to Clark, she's looking at Lois.

                                    CLARK
                    Uhhhh..
                          (looks at watch)
                    ... oh, right, seven, your folks.            (X)
                    We were just...

                                    LOIS
                    ... working on a story.

                    Together?

                                    CLARK
                    Perry teamed us up.

                                    LANA                         (X)
                    Did he.

                                    LOIS
                          (to Clark)
                    But we can take point while you 
                    deal with your wedding.  I know how 
                    overwhelming it can all get.  Just 
                    promise we'll meet up later?

      Lois and Clark lock eyes.

                                    LANA                         (X)
                    Let's go, Clark.

                                    LOIS
                    Clark?

                          (to Lois)
                    I'll catch up with you back at the
                    Planet.  About one.

                                    LOIS
                    Great.

                    I don't like having to come look 
                    for you.  You know how Dad gets 
                    when you're late...

                    her.



      Wells is being strapped into a steel chair by Domo.  Lois  (X)
      has a blindfold removed from her eyes by Tempus.           (X)

                                    TEMPUS
                    You know, you really shouldn't walk
                    around unarmed.  My stores are
                    offering a nice deal on a twelve
                    clip automatic.
                          (produces it)
                    Twenty-four rounds with every
                    purchase... and a free pair of
                    sunglasses.                                  (X)

                                    WELLS
                    You may do what you wish with me,
                    Tempus, but I implore you: let the 
                    girl go.

                                    TEMPUS
                    God, Herb, who writes your 
                    dialogue?  You sound like The 
                    Prisoner of Zenda.

                    this.

                                    TEMPUS
                    And you sound like Lois Lane, in
                    trouble again.  Not gonna get away
                    with what, Lois?

                    My plan is to become Mayor of 
                    Metropolis by killing Perry White.
                    But wait, somebody might try and 
                    stop me -- big, brawny, looks good
                    in blue?  Gee, if _only_ I lived in 
                    a dimension with no Superman.  Oh, 
                    wait.  I do!
                          (laughs)
                    And you're headed for another
                    dimension yourself, Lois. .
                    Slightly more...  spiritual.  Hope
                    you've been good.

                                    TEMPUS
                    I've missed you, Herb. Sure,                 (X)
                    you're a few years older, I'm a few
                    pounds lighter... you're about to            (X)
                    be a corpse, I'm about to be a god,
                    but it's the same old us, together 
                    again, hm?  Only now, you want _my_
                    machine.  And it's in the building, 
                    right here.

                                    WELLS

      She is blindfolded and her hands are cuffed behind her back.
      The ledge is very narrow.. Sheer wall above, sheer wall 
      below.  No windows.  The skyline and the wind buffeting her
      tell us she's up high.

                                    TEMPUS
                    Think she has any idea she's five
                    hundred feet in the air?

      A ledge-brick Lois is standing on crumbles from its mortar
      and --



      Tempus pulls up a nice lounge chair and settles in to watch.

                                    TEMPUS
                    Oooh, watch the foot there, Lois...

                                    WELLS
                    Tempus, I cry out to whatever 
                    humanity there is in you -- don't 
                    do this.

                                    TEMPUS
                    Why?

                    It's barbaric and cruel.

                                    TEMPUS
                    Herb, if I wanted to kill her, I'd

                    lamb chop and eat it.

                    I think it's a bad idea for Perry 
                    to debate Tempus tomorrow..

      She gets up and moves to the boiling pot.  Grabs a pair of tongs.

                                    LOIS (CONT'D)
                    No, I certainly don't want him to 
                    look like a coward but Tempus said 
                    he was going to kill Perry...  No, 
                    he didn't say where or when.

      With the tongs she fishes a boot out of the caldron -- it's
      soaking wet and dyed bright red.  She lets it drop back in.

                                    LOIS (CONT'D)
                    But if there's anybody in the 
                    Tempus camp that you might be able 
                    to get to... you know... open up, 
                    in exchange for some... I don't 
                    know... money, _now_ might be a 
                    good time.  Yes, security's a good 
                    idea, too.
                          (looks off)
                    I'm working on that angle myself.
                    Bye.

      She hangs up and glimpses a photo of Lana and Clark, arms  (X)
      around each other.  She turns away from it and sees another 
      one.  She shakes her head.

                                    LOIS (CONT'D)
                    I've gotta get out of here.

      She hears the sounds of Clark struggling O.S.

      She moves so she can see him.  He straightens up.  All we
      see is his head.  Bit of cape and shoulders.

                    that picture.  It's in that trunk

      She moves to a trunk.  Kneels and opens it.

                    My Mom gave it to me when I was
                    little.  She said it was on the
                    blanket they found me in.

      She takes out the S.  Smiles.  Looks back at her aborted
      sewing attempts.

      through a selection of ties.

      A FLYING BLUE BLUR becomes Lois and Superman.  They move
      protectively to Perry.

                                    LOIS

                    What -- ?

      PEOPLE get to their feet for a better look, staring and 
      murmuring.

      Superman X-RAYS the walls.  Moves to the back wall.

                                    TEMPUS
                    Everyone get back!  He's very
                    dangerous!

      Superman shoves the cheesy flat aside, revealing a steel 
      door.  He grabs the handle and peels it from the frame as if 
      it were cardboard, revealing Wells, tied in his chair. 
      (This is the Windowless Room we've been in.)  Domo has just 
      cut Wells loose.

                                    WELLS
                    Superman, be careful, there's a

                    A bomb?  Did he say bomb?

                                    SUPERMAN
                    I see it.

      He grabs it out of Wells' pocket, releases Wells.

                                    MAJOR DOMO
                          (like a bad actor

      Bullets fly off Superman.  One bullet SPARKS into the bomb.

                                    TEMPUS
                    Stand back!  Everyone back!  I will
                    save us!

      And with a flourish Tempus produces a GLOWING chunk of
      Kryptonite.

                                    LOIS
                    No!

      She lunges for Tempus but Domo grabs her.  Two Thugs hold 
      guns on her.

      Superman has no idea what this green rock is.  He starts for
      Tempus.

      As he gets close, the effect hits him.  He gets woozy.  Then 
      drops to his knees.  The bomb slips out of his hand to the
      floor.

      Superman tries to get up but can't.  The cameras close in.  
      Tempus smooths his hair for his close-up, then assumes a 
      dramatic world-savior pose.

      Tempus holds the rock to Superman like Van Helsing with a 
      cross on Dracula.  He kneels down and shoves the damaged 
      bomb far from Superman.  It skitters across the floor and 
      runs smack into Wells' feet.  He kneels gingerly, examining 
      it as --

                    the only alloy known to weaken him.
                    You should feel fortunate I was 
                    prepared!  He can't hurt us now!

                    ripped a door open, threatened us 
                    with a bomb?

      Wells, meanwhile, picks up the bomb and holds it to his ear.
      It is now ticking.  He looks rather worried.

                                    WOMAN
                    He saved us... Did you see that?

                                    JIMMY
                    It was amazing.  We'd all be dead
                    if he hadn't --

                                    LOIS

                    Clark, please...

      He coughs.  Breathes.  Lois hugs him.  He brings his hand up 
      to his mouth belches.

                                    SUPERMAN

                    We're fine, thanks to you, Kent.

                                    JIMMY
                    Why didn't you tell us about
                    yourself before?

                    I'm sure everyone has a lot of 
                    questions -- but the important 
                    thing to remember is, he's here to 
                    help.

                                    WELLS
                    He is in every way no less than
                    a... Superman.

                    I love it.  And the suit is great.
                    Stand alone kind of thing, touch of 
                    patriotic, lotta muscle.  White, we

                    No, thank you, sir.  There's only
                    one... Superman.

                                    JIMMY
                    That name. I can see it right now
                    on the front page of the --


  78  DAILY PLANET HEADLINE: SUPERMAN!                         78   

      The paper is lowered by a pair of hands, revealing we are



      Superman and Lois, alone.

                                    LOIS
                    I'm sorry the secret identity thing
                    got blown.

                                    SUPERMAN
                    It's all right.  Honestly, I don't 
                    know how you think a pair of 
                    glasses would keep people from 
                    finding out.  It's ridiculous.

                                    LOIS
                    Don't get me started.  So is Lana            (X)
                    okay with all this?

                                    SUPERMAN
                    Lana said it was her or Superman.            (X)

                                    LOIS
                    I'm sorry, Clark.

                                    SUPERMAN
                    I wish I felt half as bad about
                    losing her... as I do about losing
                    you.
                          (they look at each
                           other)
                    What if I asked you to stay?

                                    LOIS
                    I can't.

                                    SUPERMAN
                    But I'm not sure how to... be
                    this.  You made it happen.

                                    LOIS
                    All I did was help you make the 
                    right choice.  You'll keep doing 
                    that.  You just have to believe in 
                    yourself as much as I do.

                                    SUPERMAN
                    Lois, I don't just need your
                    help... I need _you_.

                                    LOIS
                    So does he.

                                    SUPERMAN
                    What I'm trying to say is... I know
                    it's crazy but... I think I... I...

      He lets this sink in.  Looks at her.

                                    SUPERMAN
                    Does he know what he has?

                    We both do.

                    We all do.

                    all is right again in both

                    ready?
