      Mike answers his door to find Dr. Ron on the porch. The *
      SPRINKLERS are on in front of Mike s house.*

                                  DR. RON*
                    Hey, Mr. Delfino. My name is Ron. My *
                      girlfriend is Susan Mayer, y know from *
                    across the street?*

                                  MIKE*
                    Oh, I know her.*

                                  DR. RON*
                    We ve kinda got a burst pipe across *
                    the street. *

                                  MIKE*
                    C mon in while I get my tools. *

      In the b.g., Susan appears on her front stoop. We see her *
      shout  Ron! Ron!  But the sound of the sprinkler drowns her *
      out. *

                                  MIKE (CONT'D)*
                    And you can call me Mike.*

      Mike heads inside as Ron reacts.*


      Susan sees Dr. Ron at Mike s doorstep. *

                                  SUSAN*
                    Ron! Ron! *

      The sound of the sprinklers are drowning out her shout. Susan *
      looks at the two steps in front of her, she braces herself *
      and wheels forward. CLUNK! CLUCK! Susan wheels down the *
      steps, grimacing with pain. She catches her breath and looks *
      up to see DR. RON disappear into Mike s house.*

                                  SUSAN (CONT'D)*
                    No! Come back!*

      SERIES OF SHOTS: Susan wheels herself down her stone walkway. *
      Given her surgery, it s a bumpy, painful ride. Susan then *
      wheels down the sidewalk towards Mike s. *



                                                                            (CONTINUED)DH217     "Could I Leave You?"    (WHITE FULL)    02/02/06       40.

      Finally, in Susan s haste to get into the street, the back of *
      her wheelchair catches on the curb and TIPS THE WHEELCHAIR, *
      dumping Susan into the street.*


      Dr. Ron crosses the street, where Susan is gingerly getting *
      to her feet. She bends laboriously in an attempt to right her *
        wheelchair.*

                                  DR. RON*
                    Liar!!*

      Susan turns. She holds onto the fence for support.*

                                  SUSAN*
                    Ron, I m sorry. You were so mad about *
                    Karl, I didn t think you d understand *
                    about Mike.*

                                  DR. RON*
                    You re right. I don t. Were you *
                    sleeping with us both?*

                                  SUSAN*
                    No! *

                                  DR. RON*
                    Why am I even asking? Every word out *
                    of your mouth is a liar word! *

      Dr. Ron heads for his car. Susan grabs his arm. Mike comes *
      out of his house, holding his tool box to see... *




                                                                            (CONTINUED)DH217     "Could I Leave You?"    (WHITE FULL)    02/02/06       41.

                    Please! Let me explain.*

                                  DR. RON*
                    Let go of me!*

      Dr. Ron yanks his arm away. Susan stumbles over her fallen *
      wheelchair and lands on the ground. *

      Mike drops his tools and runs over as Ron tries to help her *
      up.*

                                  DR. RON (CONT'D)*

                    I'm sorry! Here, let me help you... *

      As Dr. Ron helps Susan into her wheelchair, Mike rushes up.*

                    What the hell is wrong with you?*

                                  DR. RON*
                    Hey! It was an accident.*

                                  MIKE*
                    Sure didn't look like an accident to *

                                  DR. RON*
                    Yeah. Go home, Mike!*

      Mike gets in Dr. Ron's face.*

                                  MIKE*
                    Touch her again like that, and you're *
                    gonna be dealing with me.*

                    You might want to get out of my face.*

                    Or what?*

      Mike stares down Dr. Ron, waiting for a response, but it *
      never comes. As Mike starts to turn away, a furious Dr. Ron *
      shoves Mike to the ground. *

                                  SUSAN*
                    Ron! What are you doing?!*

      Mike jumps up and goes for Dr. Ron who cowardly starts to run *
      off. Mike grabs him, pins his arm behind his back and SLAMS *
      him face onto the hood of his car.*

                                  SUSAN (CONT'D)*
                    Guys, please! Stop it! *

      ANGLE ON: Karl, watching from Susan's window. As he does, he *
      eats dessert, thoroughly entertained.*

      BACK TO SCENE*

      Mike releases Dr. Ron, who stands red-faced and enraged, *
      straightening his clothes. *

                                  DR. RON*
                          (to Susan)*
                    I can't believe I've wasted my time *
                    with you. I thought we had something, *
                    but you've just been leading me on. *
                    You're obviously still in love with *
                    him. I'm done.*

      Dr. Ron gets into his car. *

                                  SUSAN*
                    No, Ron... please don't go.*

                                  DR. RON*
                    Hell with you.*

      Dr. Ron drives off. A beat. Susan turns to Mike.*

                    Why are you torturing me?*

      Through the shadows and dark we see Caleb sneaking up close *
      to Bree s house. He sees a second floor window and begins to *
      throw some pebbles against it. A moment, then the window *

      Caleb fidgets, waiting, then Danielle suddenly appears out on *

      Caleb takes a moment to drink in the sight of Danielle before *

                    Is this real gold?*

      Caleb wouldn t know if it was or wasn t, but he nods *
        enthusiastically. Danielle grins with covetous delight. A *
      BARKING DOG brings her back to the moment.*

      Danielle gives Caleb a quick peck on the cheek, and hurries *
      away. We linger on Caleb, standing in the moonlight, a little *
      dazed by what s just happened. His fingers come up to the *

      Peter stands before A NIGHT WATCHMAN, who guards the entrance

      Beat. The watchman takes out his keys.

                    Alright. But I'll have to escort you.

                    Four eyes are better than two.

      He unlocks the gate and Peter helps him lift it up. The 
      watchman unlocks the door. As he and Peter walk into the 
      store, we see Bree in the b.g. slip out, unseen. 


      Peter catches up with Bree, who's wandering around aimlessly, 
      still traumatized by her lockup.

                    Yes. I can't seem to figure out how I 
                    ended up in the dressing room. I 
                    remember having a drink at the bar and 
                    then going to look at a dress and 
                    then... nothing.

                                  PETER
                    Don't sweat it. I've ended up in worse 
                    places. 

      Bree looks up at Peter, grateful.

                    Thank you for coming to get me. If I 
                    had to wait until the store opened... 
                    let's just say you saved me a lot of 
                      embarrassment. 

                                  PETER 
                    Just don't tell anyone at AA I'm a 
                      gentleman. It might undermine my tough 
                    love persona. 

                                  BREE
                    My lips are sealed.

                                  PETER
                    However, I will go on record as saying 
                    you're no longer the easiest alcoholic 
                    I've ever sponsored.

                                  BREE
                            (stiffening)
                    Please don't call me that.

                                   PETER
                    You know, part of recovery is 
                    accepting the label. But if you'd 
                    prefer, I can call you a drunk, a *
                    lush, a boozehound --*

                                  BREE
                    Okay, okay. I admit... my drinking has 
                    gotten out of control recently. Can 
                    you help me fix that? If I'm going to 
                    drink, it should be responsibly. 

                                  PETER
                    Bree, you have to stop altogether.

                                  BREE
                    I know that's the party line, but in 
                    practice, isn't the important thing to 
                    dial back to a healthy level? When you 
                    go to Weight Watchers, they don't ask 
                    you to stop eating entirely. You're 
                    simply asked to eat sensibly. 

                                  PETER
                    I've never known anyone who died from 
                    not drinking.

      They arrive at Peter's car. He unlocks the passenger side, 
      holding open the door for Bree.

                                  BREE
                    Maybe not. But I bet your program 
                    would have a higher success rate if 
                    you didn't make the cure worse than 
                    the disease.

                                  PETER 
                    You blacked out in a department store 
                    dressing room. 

      Beat. Bree stares at Peter icily.

                      A gentleman would have waited until I 
                    was safely home to point that out.

      She gets inside and shuts the door herself. Peter sighs.*

      FADE IN:


      Betty walks down the street, fumbling with her car keys, when *
      she sees Danielle walking in the opposite direction.*

                    Morning, Mrs. Applewhite.*

                    Good morning, Danielle. Please say hi *
                    to your mother for me and --*

      Betty slams the brakes on the mild pleasantries. Stares at *
      the necklace around Danielle s neck. Betty s necklace.*

      But Betty has already started back towards her house, double-*
      time. Danielle shrugs, keeps walking.*
