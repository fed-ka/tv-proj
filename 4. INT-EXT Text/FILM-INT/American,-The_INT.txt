JACK (dark, fit, mid-forties) is staring at the embers of a
log fire. He sips from a thick cut crystal glass of whiskey.
The impressive US Army Special Forces crest tattooed on the
shoulder of his bare torso is at odds with JACK's quiet
manner and the distinguished silver that flecks his hair and
stubble. JACK is no longer young.
A creak behind him and his eyes flick over his left shoulder.
INGRID (34) is naked. With an intimate familiarity she kisses
JACK on the top of his head, sits close behind him and wraps
her arms around her lover, linking her slender hands across
his upper chest.
Her head resting on his shoulder, her face beside his, INGRID
and JACK watch the fire together in easy silence.
3
6
JACK packs a few belongings in a holdall.
7
10
JACK washes his face in the cramped bathroom at the back of
the bar.
In the background, on the stereo, The White Stripes cover One
More Cup of Coffee.
JACK stares at himself in the mirror. He looks exhausted.
11
11
JACK is sitting at the back of the bar. He has a good view of
the whole establishment: including the entrance and the door
to the bathrooms.
He lights a cigarette.
LARRY comes in and sits opposite him.
LARRY
(genuinely shocked)
You started smoking again?
JACK exhales.
JACK
Guess so.
7.
LARRY
Since when?
JACK
Since now.
The WAITER slides over and flicks a cloth at the table.
WAITER
Cafe?
LARRY
Due.
The WAITER disappears.
A beat.
LARRY puts an ENVELOPE on the table.
LARRY
Stockholm account. Final
installment.
JACK takes the envelope and puts it in an inside pocket.
LARRY is about to speak but stops.
The WAITER reappears and puts down two cups of coffee.
LARRY puts two cubes of sugar in his cup and starts stirring.
Then speaks low and fast:
LARRY
You can't stay here, Jack. You
won't see `em coming, not in a big
city. But you can't go far, either.
If the gentlemen whose accounts you
closed belonged to Brink, Gallazzo,
Simenov- any of the first division-
you have four or five hours at most
before every airport, train
station, bus stop, toll booth and
ski lift from Stockholm to Skopje
is under surveillance.
JACK smokes.
JACK
So.
Not a question. An acknowledgement that LARRY knows exactly
what he's talking about. And JACK is listening.
8.
LARRY
So. You find a hole- somewhere
nearby- and you crawl into it and
you stay put until I say it's safe
to come out.
JACK's expression is as immoveable as a cliff face.
LARRY
Turn right outside the bar then
second left. Via Spinetti. You'll
find a silver Citroen C2 with
Chieti plates. Check the glove box
and follow the map. Castelvecchio.
It's a fucking fortress. Literally.
And as dead as a graveyard. Anyone
within a three to five mile radius
you'll see `em coming.
He pushes something across the table. A MOBILE PHONE in a
cellophane bag.
LARRY
Get there. Stay there.
LARRY finishes his coffee and dabs at the corners of his
mouth with a napkin.
LARRY
Do nothing `till you get my call.
12
12
JACK gets into a compact Citroen C2: nothing flash.
He opens the glove compartment and finds a PLAIN MANILLA
ENVELOPE.
Inside the envelope is:
-a PASSPORT bearing Jack's photo in the name of Edward Clarke
-a DRIVER'S LICENSE in the same name
-and a MAP.
13
16
JACK looks at the sign.
He looks up at the silent town, at the vast stone ramparts.
An OLD MAN comes out of a crooked medieval doorway, stares at
JACK and disappears into another building.
JACK looks at the dead sockets of the windows, random beneath
the rotting patchwork of rooves.
A DOG barks. The WIND hisses. The atmosphere is deathly.
JACK makes a decision.
And drives away.
17
21
The internal courtyard is refreshingly cool.
11.
In the centre of the courtyard is a FOUNTAIN made of marble
shot through with black veins.
In the fountain stands an alabaster STATUE OF A GIRL. She's
wearing a toga and holding a clam shell from which the water
falls. The water is delivered by a two and quarter millimetre
diameter pipe made of bronze.
As JACK crosses the courtyard he glances at the STATUE.
He finds it hard to tear his eyes away.
22
22
A toothbrush in the glass by the sink.
The guidebook on the bedside table.
Apart for this, JACK has avoided unpacking: living entirely
out of his holdall for some time.
From the holdall, JACK produces a pair of Leica 15x56 Geovid
BRF Rangefinding BINOCULARS.
Through his casement window he has good view of
CASTELVECCHIO.
He sweeps the town in grid formation: calm and methodical.
This is a routine assessment.
JACK's POV: apart from the occasional appearance of an old
man, woman or dog, the dead town across the valley is empty.
23
23
JACK is lying on top of his bed, fully clothed and wide
awake.
Taped to the inside of the wooden bed frame...
...is his WALTHER semi-automatic handgun.
24
27
Rotting doors lead to abandoned cellars and storerooms.
A MONGREL tied to a post is barking savagely, his leash
keeping him inches from sinking his bared fangs into JACK.
JACK stares at the dog: a mysterious creature of fear and
fury.
13.
28
31
The SUN is sinking behind the high mountains that overlook
the hilltop town.
JACK is wearing an immaculate white linen shirt.
He's sitting in a small walled garden snuggled at the rear of
a crumbling fifteenth century edifice, overlooked yet
secluded and trapping the last rays of the sun.
FATHER BENEDETTO pours two large glasses of brandy from a
globulous green bottle of ARMAGNAC and sniffs his drink like
a honey bee hovering over a bloom.
18.
FATHER BENEDETTO
Que siamo! The quality of the
brandy is good, the liquor is
smooth and the glass warmed by the
sun.
He pronounces warmed "war-med". His English is sophisticated
but quaint, like an out-of-date book.
JACK sniffs his drink before he sips it. Not like a
connoisseur: like a White House taster checking the safety of
a Presidential beverage.
FATHER BENEDETTO
(in ENGLISH)
The only good thing to come from
the Francesi, everything else...
FATHER BENEDETTO grimaces.
FATHER BENEDETTO
The French are... pezzi di merda.
This is not an American discovery.
Italians have known this for
centuries. [In ITALIAN] When Rome
called France the province of Gaul,
they were just the same. Arrogant
sensualists. Their cuisine is fussy
and their wine effeminate. Only
their brandy is worthy of any
attention.
FATHER BENEDETTO looks at JACK.
FATHER BENEDETTO
(in ENGLISH)
Forgive me. I speak too fast. You
study our history?
JACK
No.
FATHER BENEDETTO looks horrified.
FATHER BENEDETTO
You come to Italy to make a guide
book and you don't care about
history?
JACK
I take pictures, father.
A beat.
FATHER BENEDETTO
Of course. You are American. You
think you can escape history. You
live for the present.
19.
A beat.
JACK likes this man. His shrewdness is disconcerting but
humane.
JACK sips his brandy.
JACK
I try to, father.
32
The remnants of a simple yet sophisticated meal: apple,
pecorino cheese, honey and walnuts.
On his lap top, JACK has organised several weeks worth of
PHOTOGRAPHS of CASTEL DEL MONTE into three categories:
1. Street plan
2. Exit routes/car
3. Exit routes/foot
20.
Now he is cleaning and oiling his WALTHER PPK/S.
36
36
JACK completes his morning exercises then showers and
dresses. His manner is precise and methodical. Only a man who
has lived alone for many years can live like this.
When his preparations are complete, he picks up his
BINOCULARS and studies the nearby town of CASTELVECCHIO
through his medieval casement window.
37
38
JACK lowers his binoculars.
Thinks.
Decides to proceed with caution.
39
42
JACK is lying on top of his bed, fully clothed but fast
asleep.
His eyes roll left and right beneath his lids.
He's dreaming.
In his right hand is a book of MEDIEVAL ITALIAN ART &
ARCHITECTURE.
Twitching in his sleep, JACK's grip on the ART & ARCHITECTURE
BOOK slowly loosens...
THUD!
As the BOOK hits the floor JACK opens his eyes, sits up and
rips the taped WALTHER from beneath the bed, pointing it at
the door.
Silence.
JACK's heart is beating.
43
43
JACK is looking through his BINOCULARS.
JACK'S POV:
...of a small yellow and blue Italian POST OFFICE VAN heading
up the winding alpine road towards CASTELVECCIO.
26.
44
46
The shop is small and dusty.
So is the POSTMASTER.
JACK
Buon giorno.
The POSTMASTER grunts his reply, jutting his chin.
JACK
Il fermo posta?
The POSTMASTER turns to a rack of pigeonholes behind a sack
of mail hanging in a metal frame like an old person's walking
aid. From one pigeonhole he draws a bundle of general
delivery envelopes held together by an elastic band. Some
have been there for weeks. Months even.
POSTMASTER
Nome?
A beat.
JACK
Clarke.
Deftly, like a teller counting through a thick wad of
banknotes he flicks through the mail with thin, wasted
fingers.
27.
POSTMASTER
Clarky?
JACK
Clarke. Una pacchetto.
POSTMASTER
Pacchetto!
This makes all the difference. The POSTMASTER clicks again,
disappearing behind the rack of pigeon holes...
POSTMASTER
Clarky, Clarky, Clarky. Ecco.
...and reappearing with a PACKAGE.
The PACKAGE is from an Italian PHOTOGRAPHIC SUPPLIERS.
JACK
Grazie.
POSTMASTER
Identificazione.
JACK flicks his eyes downwards. He has already put his
PASSPORT on the counter.
The POSTMASTER scoops it up with bony fingers.
Looks from the picture to JACK.
JACK bears the scrutiny with a deadly straight face.
47
47
JACK unwraps the PACKAGE.
He removes:
-film
-photographic paper
-development fluids
-fixing solutions
Then:
-a solid, monolythic rectangular receiver made out of a
single piece of lightweight alloy.
-a bolt assembly.
-a barrel.
28.
Only with this final piece is the puzzle complete.
Laid out on the floor is a SOCIMI 821 SUB-MACHINE GUN.
Without touching it, JACK studies the weapon like a
connoisseur looking at the hue of a wine. In particular he
notices that the SERIAL NUMBER has been scratched off.
Then he moves slowly, assembling the weapon with precision
engineered expertise:
-inserting the barrel into the front of the receiver and
securing it with the nut,
-opening the sidefolding tubular stock and engaging the
buttpad,
-snuggling the buttpad to his shoulder,
-looking down the barrel,
-and slowly squeezing back the finger-grooved TRIGGER as we
SMASH CUT TO:
48
48
Our beautiful twenty four year-old Italian girl enters.
CLARA.
She sits on the edge of the bed, whose ageing metal springs
squeak slightly, and puts her smoking cigarette in an ashtray
on the bedside table.
She kicks off her slip-on shoes.
Slips off her panties.
Lifts her light cotton dress over her head and lies back on
the bed in one practised motion.
JACK sits on the bed beside her.
He doesn't look at her.
ITALIAN GIRL
Amore?
She reaches up to touch JACK as we cut to:
49
51
Sixteenth century. Sombre wood panelling stained dark with
polish and smoke. Two paraffin lamps stand on a huge antique
sideboard, their frosted orbs engraved with scenes from the
life of Our Lord.
The room is filled with a dining table: a massive black
edifice of oak, five inches thick with six legs fluted like
the columns of cathedrals.
30.
Using antique crockery, ancient copper pots and utensils like
old fashioned instruments of torture FATHER BENEDETTO
performs culinary alchemy: transforming flesh into meat,
dough into bread, hard earth nuggets into vegetables.
He hums as he cooks: Opera arias. And Johnny Cash.
JACK sips from a glass of wine and watches FATHER BENEDETTO
potter around the wood fired stove. The priest has his own
wine which he sips as he works between bouts of humming.
52
52
JACK eats a bowl of chilled carrot and sorrel soup in
silence.
FATHER BENEDETTO watches him, pleased to see his guest so
absorbed.
As soon as JACK has finished, FATHER BENEDETTO invites him to
help himself from the ancient tureen.
Then he bustles over to the stove, humming again.
JACK eats, studying a framed photo of FATHER BENEDETTO with
his arm around a tough, corpulent Italian man in his mid-
twenties. FABIO.
FATHER BENEDETTO returns to the table with a large covered
dish issuing steam into his face.
He notices JACK's eye-line.
FATHER BENEDETTO
All the sheep in my flock are dear
to me, but some are dearer than
most. Especially those that have
strayed from the fold.
Off JACK's intrigued look FATHER BENEDETTO clarifies:
FATHER BENEDETTO
Fabio. He is a... [in ITALIAN] 'car
doctor'. But I suspect his practice
is not entirely sound. Ecco!
FATHER BENEDETTO whisks the lid off the covered dish
revealing a stew of poultry carcasses covered in sauce.
FATHER BENEDETTO
Fagiano. Pheasant. With sauce of
orange juice, orange peel,
chestnuts, garlic, Marsala wine
and... Come si dici in Inglese?
Brodo di Pollo. Chicken broth.
31.
FATHER BENEDETTO serves each of them with a complete bird and
pours white wine into fresh glasses.
FATHER BENEDETTO
Also: salsify in garlic butter.
Mange-tout. Fried wild mushrooms
with truffle.
JACK helps himself to vegetables.
FATHER BENEDETTO watches him as he savours his first taste.
JACK licks his lips and sips some cold white wine.
The two men regard one another, the priest awaiting a
verdict.
JACK
Sinful.
FATHER BENEDETTO shrugs.
FATHER BENEDETTO
The Holy Father eats better than
this.
The flash of a smile crosses the priest's face.
JACK
Have you ever wanted to be anything
other than a priest?
FATHER BENEDETTO
Have you ever wanted to be anything
other than a... come se dice in
Inglese...?
JACK
Photographer?
FATHER BENEDETTO
Photographer.
JACK
I do what I'm good at.
FATHER BENEDETTO
I'm sure you have other talents.
You have the hands of a craftsman,
not an artist. You are good with
machines. Yet you told me just the
opposite when we first met.
JACK hides his unease from the watchful priest.
FATHER BENEDETTO
Journalism cannot make you a rich
man.
32.
FATHER BENEDETTO's eyes flick over the ROLEX.
JACK
No.
FATHER BENEDETTO
Perhaps you are rich already?
JACK
I'm not a young man. I have my
savings.
FATHER BENEDETTO
(in ITALIAN)
My meagre income is subject to the
vagaries of the stock market and
with church attendance declining
there's less and less money in the
offertory. But if a man has God in
his vaults...
He looks searchingly at JACK.
JACK
I don't think God is interested in
me. Father.
FATHER BENEDETTO
(in ENGLISH)
I know better than to try to make a
convert over pheasant and
Trebbiano.
JACK is silent.
The two men continue eating.
Then casually:
JACK
What are the snakes for, father?
FATHER BENEDETTO taps the end of his nose in the universal
sign for secrecy.
FATHER BENEDETTO
"The grave soul keeps its own
secrets, and takes its own
punishment in silence."
He has a twinkle in his eye. The priest is on a mission to
extract the truth... and JACK knows it.
53
55
The metal door slides open. FABIO leads JACK inside.
At the back of the cluttered workshop is a blue ALFA ROMEO
being resprayed white. Beside it, one half of a LANCIA is
being welded to another.
JACK knows better than to stare. He follows FABIO through
to...
34.
56
56
Girly calendars, Italian style.
JACK
I'm taking pictures forty minutes
north of here. Right up in the
mountains. Father Benedetto said
you might be able to help.
FABIO
(in ITALIAN)
You need models. For your
photographs? Italian girls?
He winks at JACK. He's being friendly.
JACK
My publisher wouldn't stretch to a
four by four and the park trails
are playing havoc with my chassis.
The technical English is slightly beyond FABIO's grasp.
This suits JACK.
FABIO
(in ITALIAN)
Want me to take a look?
JACK
Not really. I just need something
to work on a ruptured driveshaft.
FABIO
(in ITALIAN)
You're a mechanic?
JACK
Just a hobby. I tinker.
JACK looks at the TOOLS hanging on the walls and littering
the work benches.
FABIO shrugs.
FABIO
(in ITALIAN)
Help yourself. [In ENGLISH] My
garage is your garage.
JACK
I appreciate that.
FABIO gets on with work, sliding himself beneath the
resprayed Alfa Romeo.
35.
JACK picks out various implements, laying them on the work
surface: drill, hacksaw, lathe, vice, mallet.
Behind an oil pan with a jagged hole in it he discovers
several GEAR WHEELS with the teeth sheared off. He holds the
biggest one up.
JACK
Bene?
FABIO is engrossed his work.
FABIO
Si! Si! Va bene!
JACK
Quant'e?
FABIO grins and growls. A gearwheel with no bite is useless
to him.
FABIO
Niente!
JACK wraps the gearwheel in a sheet of oily newspaper and
puts it in the sports bag with the tools.
At the door, he pauses.
That's when JACK sees it on the notice board. A PHOTOGRAPH of
FATHER BENEDETTO and FABIO. FABIO is much younger in this
photo: fourteen or fifteen years old. He's wearing an AS Roma
football strip. Again: the priest has his arm around the boy.
JACK
Ciao. Grazie.
FABIO
Ciao, Americano!
57
57
FATHER BENEDETTO rings the CHURCH BELLS for Mass.
58
59
JACK has laid out his newly acquired tools on the flag stone
floor of his room.
36.
Beside them is the SOCIMI SUB-MACHINE GUN.
Using the CHURCH BELLS as sound cover...
...JACK puts the GEARWHEEL on a flag stone tile and smashes
it into five pieces with a four pound MALLET.
60
60
By torchlight, JACK is fashioning CONNECTORS from the smashed
steel gear.
It's very, very tricky work and his eyes ache in the poor
light.
61
64
The sound of CHURCH BELLS.
JACK is at work:
-modifying the SOUND SUPPRESSOR to make it more efficient
-filing the CONNECTORS until the trigger squeeze is softer
-adjusting the position of the TELESCOPIC SIGHT mountings
And finally:
-checking the balance of the weapon: JACK poises it on the
edge of a ruler over the pencil mark he has determined to be
the gun's centre of gravity.
The SOCIMI balances perfectly.
By now the sun is low and the light fading. JACK's eyes are
sore and his fingers aching.
He sits on his bed with his hands on his knees, silent in the
dying light.
65
65
We're in the living room of a small apartment. It's simply
and attractively furnished. There are 2 GIRLS: not obviously
hookers.
The FIRST GIRL is on her mobile phone. Every now and again
she glances at JACK. The SECOND GIRL approaches him for a
light.
JACK
E Clara qui?
[Is Clara here?]
SECOND GIRL
Non e stasera qui.
[She's not here tonight.]
She loops her arm through JACK's.
39.
SECOND GIRL
Volete una bevanda?
[Would you like a drink?]
JACK shakes his head.
JACK
Forse un altro tempo.
[Perhaps another time.]
66
67
Crowded with locals. JACK orders a coffee.
Through the window he tries to keep an surreptitious eye on
the YOUNG MAN. But the darkness outside throws back
reflections of the bright neon-lit bar within.
One reflection catches our attention.
The Italian girl. CLARA.
She is drinking and laughing with friends, young Italians
like her. She catches sight of JACK.
He turns away.
68
70
We're in the corridor outside JACK'S ROOM.
JACK takes his right hand from his pocket.
He's clutching the WALTHER.
Slowly, he reaches his left hand upwards, towards the lintel
above the door where he finds...
...a single FEATHER.
71
71
From the inside of the room we watch four sturdily fashioned
deadbolt locks slide open. Each lock is new and home made.
JACK enters, shuts the door, locks all four bolts. And sits
on the bed.
72
74
MATHILDE's sunglasses reflect the alpine landscape.
MATHILDE
You picked a beautiful spot.
She takes off her shades.
Her once hazel eyes are now GREY-BLUE.
She glances round the hire car's drab plastic interior.
MATHILDE
You would be hard pressed to make a
fast get away in this.
Perhaps she's nervous. Her attempt at humour isn't working
and she stumbles slightly on her grammar:
MATHILDE
I would have thought you to have
had at least an Alfa Romeo.
JACK
This attracts less attention.
MATHILDE
Is it far?
JACK
Fifty minutes.
She looks up through the sun roof at the high mountains over
head.
MATHILDE
Up there?
JACK nods.
She eases herself back, resigned to a long climb.
MATHILDE
The train was tiring. One has to
keep alert so much in cities.
Her eyelids are drooping.
JACK
I'll wake you before the turn-off.
She smiles gratefully. But does not shut her tired eyes.
The CLOCK on the dash reads 12:17
44.
75
75
JACK negotiates the alpine road, leaning into the steering
wheel, shifting up or down a gear and glancing from the
mirror to the road and back again
MATHILDE is asleep.
JACK scans her, taking in every detail: her low-heeled shoes
are expensive but she wears no jewelry except a Seiko wrist-
watch on a metal strap and a thin gold chain at her throat.
Her tan is light, her breasts neat and her legs shapely and
recently waxed.
But JACK doesn't look at her like an object of desire. He
looks at her cautiously, with an expression that says: "this
young woman is ruthless. If she were not, she wouldn't be
alive."
That's when he notices the CAR in his rear view mirror.
It's too far behind to decipher the make or model and it
weaves in and out of frame as JACK negotiates the alpine
road.
MATHILDE wakes with a start. The CLOCK on the dash reads
13:05.
MATHILDE
Are we nearly there?
JACK
The turn-off's up ahead.
His eyes flick to the rear view mirror. Hers to the wing.
She spots the CAR behind. JACK catches her eye questioningly.
MATHILDE
I told you I work alone.
JACK slows just before the turn off and pulls over.
Then stops.
Now its MATHILDE's turn to look questioning.
JACK
Just a precaution.
He gets out of the car and pretends to urinate.
The CAR behind passes at speed.
A blue Seat. The driver neither slows down nor looks in their
direction.
JACK gets back in the car.
45.
And turns off up a dirt track that disappears into the
meadows.
76
80
Her sunglasses back on, MATHILDE watches the meadows slip
backwards in the nearside wing mirror as the car bumps back
down the alpine track.
MATHILDE
I wish you hadn't brought me here.
Again... a real sadness.
JACK glances at her.
54.
MATHILDE
This is the sort of place I wish
I'd discovered by myself. Then
maybe one day I could have retired
here. But you already know it.
JACK is touched.
JACK
I'm much older than you. By the
time you've retired I'll be dead.
81
82
The YOUNG WOMAN's manner is once more tense and formal.
MATHILDE
We will meet as before?
JACK nods.
The distant sound of a DIESEL ENGINE. The train is
approaching.
MATHILDE
On the first of next month?
He nods again.
MATHILDE
Around noon?
Not even a nod this time: just a slow blink.
MATHILDE opens the door, runs around to the boot and grabs
her canvas sports bag. Then returns to the passenger side of
the car and looks in.
MATHILDE
Thank you for a lovely day. Mr.
Butterfly.
She leans in..
...and kisses him lightly on the cheek, her lips light and
quick on his stubble.
MATHILDE
You must take your mistress to the
meadow for a picnic.
55.
She closes the car door, walks onto the platform and vanishes
onto a waiting carriage. The TRAIN honks and belches, moving
off down the track in the direction from which it came.
JACK watches it go.
And drives off.
Confused.
83
83
Two OLD MEN drinking beer at the bar. Two more at a table,
playing Scopa with old fashioned Trentine playing cards.
Sitting at the back of the room, JACK stares at a shot of
Grappa.
Above him, mounted on the wall, is a TELEVISION. On the TV is
a Western: Charles Bronson and Henry Fonda in ONCE UPON A
TIME IN THE WEST.
JACK downs his shot, gets up and walks over to the bar. Pays.
The BARMAN nods at the screen.
BARMAN
Sergio Leone. Italiano.
JACK turns and looks.
HENRY FONDA in close-up, is about to shoot a red headed BOY
of seven in the head.
JACK stares. Just at the moment that the gun goes off...
...JACK turns away.
BARMAN
(in poor ENGLISH)
You like cow boy movie?
JACK thinks.
Then shakes his head.
JACK
Hokey.
84
84
CLARA and JACK are naked.
JACK tries to kiss her on the lips but CLARA turns away: just
enough to let him know this is against the rules.
56.
JACK kisses her neck. Her breasts. Her stomach.
As he moves his head between her legs, her fingers (already
ensnared in his hair) tighten their grip, stopping him from
going further.
JACK looks up at CLARA, across her belly, and she looks back
at him, her expression fixed yet curious.
Against her rules but not, we sense, against her wishes, JACK
kisses CLARA softly, tenderly, deeply until she is moving
against his tongue, using her sex like a mouth to kiss him in
return.
They make love, breaking each of Clara's two remaining rules
in turn. First: JACK puts her in a position she initially
resists. Then: he kisses her.
CLARA comes, not wanting to.
Suddenly, preoccupied, JACK does not.
85
85
JACK is in bed with CLARA.
CLARA
Morboso?
She looks at him.
CLARA
(with certainty)
Morboso.
JACK
Morboso?
CLARA
Morboso is like... when you can't
stop thinking about something.
He stares back at her: wordless.
CLARA
Or someone.
A long pause: her eyes searching his. JACK sits up, lights a
cigarette and stands by the window, looking through the
blind, down into the street.
JACK
You needn't act.
CLARA
Act?
57.
CLARA watches him, confused but fascinated.
JACK
You might have to act with your
other clients but you don't have to
pretend anything at all with me.
She lights herself a cigarette.
JACK
I want you to be yourself with me.
Be as indifferent as you like. I
came here to get pleasure, not to
give it.
He hands her CASH.
She counts it.
CLARA
Maybe I pretend very well. I got
more tip than the other girls
usually get.
He walks to the door.
Pauses.
JACK
I don't sleep with the other girls.
And leaves.
86
86
JACK is asleep.
He is not alone.
In the bed beside him:
INGRID.
Pale as death.
Eyes rolled back in her sockets.
***
JACK wakes up suddenly, gasping.
The bed is empty, the sheets twisted and damp.
58.
87
88
In the gun-metal light of dawn, fiddly work:
-cartridges taken apart
-tiny holes drilled in the nose to a depth of precisely 3mm
-the hole half-filled with mercury
-and plugged with a drop of liquid lead.
JACK is converting jacketed ammunition into EXPLOSIVE
BULLETS.
89
89
Outside, the sun is merciless. Inside, JACK has taken refuge
in the cool of the church. He is alone. He is not praying.
Just staring impassively at the gaudy crucifixion: at the
thorns and the nails and the running blood.
Footsteps. JACK checks for reflections in his watch.
It's FATHER BENEDETTO: dressed for Mass.
FATHER BENEDETTO
I've been looking for you.
He mops the sweat from his brow with the hem of his Soutane,
takes JACK by the arm and leads him to one side, away from
the light of the candles.
FATHER BENEDETTO
A man was here asking questions
about you.
A beat.
JACK
Here?
FATHER BENEDETTO
He came to the church this
afternoon.
JACK
What did he want?
59.
FATHER BENEDETTO
To know where you live. He said he
was a friend from Switzerland.
JACK
Switzerland?
JACK thinks.
JACK
And you told him?
The priest looks at with complete disdain:
FATHER BENEDETTO
Of course I do not tell him. How do
I know him? He is maybe the police.
Certainly he is no friend. A friend
would know your pensione.
Besides...
FATHER BENEDETTO leans close and whispers:
FATHER BENEDETTO
Friends do not carry guns.
FATHER BENEDETTO glances shrewdly at JACK, his eyes searching
into him.
FATHER BENEDETTO
If you live in Italy, and you are a
man of the cloth, you meet many
people. Besides, I lived once in
Naples. If you live in Naples you
know the difference between a fat
wallet and a... custodia per armi
di spalla. How you say in English?
JACK
Shoulder holster.
FATHER BENEDETTO
Si.
JACK glances up and down the aisle.
OLD LADIES are dribbling into church in twos and threes.
The BELL for mass starts ringing.
JACK
You're a true friend, father.
FATHER BENEDETTO
I am a priest.
JACK turns to go.
60.
FATHER BENEDETTO
Signor Clarke?
Again the priest leans close, holding JACK by the elbow in a
gesture of austere confidence.
FATHER BENEDETTO
I make a mistake. He did not say he
was from La Svizzera: Switzerland.
He said- forgive me the names in
Italian are so similar- La Svezia:
Sweden.
90
92
JACK is sitting in the window, making himself as visible as
possible to the world outside.
He downs a Grappa: then gets up to pay for it. His movements
are slow and leisurely.
The BARMAN hands him his change. And a small white ENVELOPE.
JACK is not expecting this.
BARMAN
(in ITALIAN)
Someone left this for
"L'Americano". This afternoon.
JACK looks at the ENVELOPE.
JACK
Grazie.
He turns casually away from the BARMAN's prying eyes and
opens the envelope with extreme caution.
Inside is a folded CUTTING. It's from the Swedish Daily
newspaper STERSUNDS-POSTEN.
JACK unfolds the cutting. We catch a glimpse of:
-Ingrid's dacha.
-A police line.
-Three dead bodies in the snow: the two hitmen and the girl.
Heart racing, JACK slips the cutting in his pocket.
Grabs three SUGAR CUBES from a silver bowl on the bar.
And leaves.
93
102
The YOUNG MAN puts his foot down.
The SPEEDOMETER climbs.
103
109
A small, simply furnished bedroom with a bed, a desk and a
chair.
As he sips a large cup of strong black coffee, CLARA cleans a
vicious welt on his right shoulder blade.
As the dirt and blood come away she reveals an exquisite
tattoo...
...of a BUTTERFLY.
CLARA
Ve bene. Tutto posto. Signor
Farfalla. [Good. Everything's OK.
Mr. Butterfly.]
His eyes open wide and he turns to her quickly.
JACK
Why d'you call me that?
A beat.
CLARA
You have a tattoo. On your back.
Of course.
He relaxes.
But not completely.
68.
110
112
TINS of fruit drops: three kinds: black cherry, pineapple and
lemon. Each tin is emptied of its fruit drops.
Twenty rounds of ammunition- each round packed in silica- fit
exactly into each tin.
Lead rounds in the black cherry, jacketed in the pineapple
and explosive in the lemon.
JACK re-seals each tin with sellotape.
113
116
JACK opens a black combination lock SAMSONITE BRIEFCASE and
lines the bottom and sides with the lead-lined film
protection bags, cut to fit.
Into the base of the briefcase he glues pre-shaped pieces of
firm grey plastic foam. These form the pockets into which he
slots the constituent parts of the SOCIMI SUBMACHINE GUN.
They fit perfectly.
Over this JACK uses the HOOKS and EYES to clip a false
bottom: a tough card cover onto which are pasted the custom
made headed notepaper, invoice books, notepads and envelopes.
74.
To the briefcase's central divider he adds the metal pens, a
calculator and a mobile phone. He sets the combination to
821. Then shuts and locks the BRIEFCASE.
This done he sits on the bed and stares at the case. With his
work complete, he is struck by a terrible sense of emptiness.
117
118
JACK dresses very carefully for dinner.
It is clear he wishes to make a favourable impression upon
CLARA.
119
123
JACK opens his eyes.
Sits up.
He's shocked to have slept so deeply.
CLARA must be in the shower.
He looks around at the little room casually, like a curious
lover.
Opens the top drawer of the bedside cabinet.
Finds a VIBRATOR.
Opens the bottom drawer.
Finds a RED PURSE.
86.
Inside the RED PURSE...
Finds a BERETTA DOUBLE-ACTION MODEL 21A BOBCAT.
Just at that moment CLARA comes out of the bathroom.
JACK shuts the drawer and pretends to be asleep.
124
125
LARRY is sitting in a high back leather office chair before a
large, imperial mahogany desk. In front of him are two banks
of screens.
87.
The first bank displays 3 CCTV views: (1) the entrance to his
apartment block (2) a staircase and (3) the entrance to his
apartment itself.
Another bank of screens shows 3 NEWS CHANNELS: (1) CNN, (2)
BBC WORLD and (3) AL JAZEERA.
LARRY
Our pretty young Belgian client and
her associates think someone on
your long list of enemies might
have put a tail on you.
JACK (V.O.)
Not possible.
LARRY
Course not, Jack. But if, for the
sake of argument, it was possible-
I'm thinking it could be Galazzo.
Or Simenov. Or Italian undercover.
JACK (V.O.)
Cops?
LARRY
The crooked kind.
JACK (V.O.)
How come I'm still here?
LARRY
The Belgians think they're planning
to wait for the drop and
exterminate you and Mathilde in one
swoop.
With the help of his DESKTOP computer LARRY is comparing the
scrolling share prices on CNN with the fluctuating value of
the US DOLLAR.
JACK (V.O.)
Where the hell's this information
coming from?
LARRY
I'm fucked if I know, Jack. If you
want my opinion, they're just being
jittery. I told `em you were the
most security conscious
professional I know. I told `em no
one gets close to you.
126
127
The words are out before he can stop them.
LARRY
Jack? [A BEAT] Jack? I'm sorry.
He rubs his eyes, wearied by his own insensitivity.
LARRY
That was, um.... I'm just saying
you can be relied on.
Silence.
LARRY
Jack?
CLICK.
128
130
JACK opens his PICNIC HAMPER and in it he puts:
-a polystyrene cool box packed with ice and containing a
chilled bottle of Aspirinio
-a loaf of course bread
-two clods of mozarella
-150 gms of proscuitto
-and his WALTHER PPK/S.
131
DAY
132
CLARA climbs in and fastens her seat-belt.
90.
She puts the RED PURSE between her legs. JACK glances at the
RED PURSE.
And drives.
CLARA
Where we go?
JACK
Swimming.
CLARA
How far do we go? To Fanale?
JACK
An hour. And we're not going to the
sea, we're going to the lakes. In
the mountains.
CLARA
For a... come se dice... you have
in the back...
JACK
A picnic.
CLARA
A pick-nick! We are going for a
pick-nick. Just the two of us.
She looks at him.
CLARA
I have practise my English,
Eduardo. I love to have pick-nick.
It is a beautiful day, isn't it?
JACK
It is.
133
134
CLARA is station hopping.
She finds some LOU REED. She loves LOUD REED.
JACK is concentrating on the road.
CLARA
Is it more far?
91.
JACK
Ten kilometres. Another twenty
minutes.
She pauses to work out the mathematics. She's smart. And
puzzled. But she's not frightened. Not yet.
CLARA
Twelve kilometres? In twenty
minutes?
JACK
We're going off the beaten track.
She looks confused.
JACK
Lontano. Fuori mano.
CLARA laughs.
CLARA
You will speak Italian. One day, I
will teach you.
135
136
CLARA is startled by such an insignificant track.
CLARA
Where are we going?
Now she's anxious. This is not what she expected.
JACK
You shall see.
CLARA
I think it is good we should stay
close to the road.
JACK
There's no need to worry. I've been
here before several times. Taking
photographs.
He swings the wheel suddenly to avoid a large boulder and the
Citroen pitches as if struck by a wave.
92.
CLARA clings to the door with her right hand, her left hand
dug deep into the fabric of the seat to steady herself.
JACK
You're not afraid of coming into
the wild with me, are you?
CLARA
No!
She laughs tensely.
CLARA
Of course I am not. Not with you.
But this...
She snaps her fingers.
CLARA
...sentiero!
She waves her hand in the air.
CLARA
You should have a jeep. A Toyota.
It is not good for a... berlina.
It's as if the increased danger of the track diminishes her
English.
JACK
This is a Citroen!
He strikes the steering wheel hard with the palm of his hand.
JACK
This was made by the French for
taking potatoes to market. Besides,
I always come here in this car.
CLARA
You sure?
JACK
Of course. I don't want to walk
back to town any more than you do.
CLARA
I think you are crazy. This will go
to nowhere.
JACK
I assure you it does.
She pouts her reply. The TRACK disappears into a WOOD and
runs out altogether, giving way to grass.
93.
CLARA
Now there is no road!
JACK stops the car and turns the engines off.
Sudden silence.
CLARA lets go of the seat.
CLARA
Is this where we go?
They are surrounded by trees.
JACK
No. Not quite. We go another
hundred metres, through the wood.
But from here we just roll forward.
No motor. No sound. And you'll see
a wonder.
She grips the seat again.
JACK
You won't need to hold on. I'll go
slowly. Just relax and look.
He eases his foot off the brake and the car begins to move
forward, the springs squeaking slightly. After 50 metres JACK
twists the steering wheel slightly and applies the brakes.
They roll gradually down to the outer edge of the woods and
come to a stop beneath a familiarly squat but ample WALNUT
TREE.
Beyond them is the LAKE, the MEADOWS and the RUINED HAMLET.
The hidden valley is a riot of colour, the blooms and
blossoms more brilliant than we've ever seen them. By the
edge of the lake stands a HERON, still as fence post.
CLARA gets out of the car, dumbstruck. JACK gets out too. He
watches her... then swiftly checks the ruined hamlet through
his miniature binoculars. Deserted. By the time CLARA turns
towards him, the binoculars are hidden.
CLARA
No one comes here?
She speaks so quietly JACK can barely hear her.
JACK
No.
CLARA
Just you.
JACK
Yes.
94.
CLARA turns away, unbuttons her blouse and drops it on the
grass. She is wearing no bra. On her back dapple the shadows
and patches of sun eking through the branches of the walnut.
She kicks off her shoes, which curve through the air... and
unzips her skirt. It falls to the grass. She bends and steps
daintily from her knickers. Then turns to face JACK.
JACK cannot take his eyes off her. Dizzy, he steps forward
without meaning to.
CLARA
Well?
She is coquettish- and tosses her auburn hair to one side.
CLARA
I am going to swim in the lake. Are
you coming?
She doesn't wait for his reply, but turns and runs through
the grass towards the water.
JACK
There are vipers! Vipera! Marasso!
CLARA
Maybe! But I am lucky!
The HERON flies off, rising from the reeds with an ungainly
flapping.
CLARA
(shouting)
He is an Italian bird! We disturb
his siesta!
Quickly, JACK glances inside the CITROEN.
The RED PURSE is nowhere to be seen.
CLARA
Come, Signor Farfalla!
JACK undresses. As he removes his clothes, he stalls for
time, using the cover of undressing to search for the RED
PURSE.
We can see it wedged under the passenger seat.
Due to the design of the car, JACK cannot.
CLARA
Come!
JACK turns to face the lake. He is naked. Yet with the
caution of years he does not remove his shoes until he
reaches the water's edge.
95.
CLARA is standing in the middle.
CLARA
Stand by me.
He obeys her order. He walks out to her and she takes his
hand under the water, holding it out in front of them.
JACK spots it resting on the smooth stone of the lake-bed.
Brassy and gleaming. A SPENT SHELL. He covers it with his
foot.
CLARA
Keep still. Watch.
As the ripples of his arrival peter out in the reeds, TINY
FISH appear in a shoal to gather about their hands. They
hover like slivers of glass just under the surface then move
in to nibble at the skin on their fingers.
JACK
If we stay here for a year, they'll
devour us.
CLARA
It is said that if these fishes
bite at two hands holding, then
love is good for the people.
He looks at her and for a moment he forgets the awful plan in
his head.
She kisses him, pressing herself against him, her skin and
body as pure and warm as the water.
He tries helplessly to pull away.
JACK
Maybe we should...
CLARA
Do you make love in the water?
JACK
I haven't.
She places her arms around his neck and raises her feet from
the smooth stones, wrapping her legs around his waist. She
tries to push herself onto him but he resists.
CLARA
What's wrong?
He doesn't know what to say. She looks at him: confused,
searching.
JACK
Let's eat.
96.
He walks towards the bank. She follows. The tiny fish dart
around them for a few moments then flee for the reeds,
travelling with the waves made by their departure.
137
139
A POSTMAN hands the mail to FATHER BENEDETTO.
FATHER BENEDETTO
Ciao Fabio, come stai?
IL POSTINO
Bene grazie, Padre.
We follow FATHER BENEDETTO inside as he rifles through a
bunch of church circulars. One LETTER catches his eye.
He opens it and starts to read aloud:
FATHER BENEDETTO
Dear Father Benedetto. I promised
myself that I would write to you-
as your friend- to say goodbye...
140
140
JACK stands by the door in a impeccably pressed suit, the
black SAMSONITE BRIEFCASE in his hand.
He surveys his room. All evidence of his existence has been
meticulously tidied away.
FATHER BENEDETTO (V.O.)
Everything I've ever done...
JACK leaves.
Only thing is left behind:
The book of MEDIEVAL ITALIAN ART & ARCHITECTURE on the
bedside table.
FATHER BENEDETTO (V.O.)
I've done for a reason.
102.
141
142
JACK watches the road. On the long straights he looks
backwards and forwards.
143
144
Empty.
JACK sits at a table at the back of the cafe. From here he
can see both entrances: the public entrance and the service
entrance and also the door to the bathrooms. Through the
window, he has a good view of the garage forecourt and the
slip road to and from the autostrada.
JACK places the BRIEFCASE on a chair beside him and puts a
PAPER BAG on the table next to the sugar dispenser. He checks
his watch. It is two minutes before noon. He orders an
espresso.
His nerve-heightened senses take in everything: the sound of
the cicadas, the buzz of the neon strip-lights and the creak,
creak, creak of the engine oil sign outside, endlessly
revolving.
JACK's eyes flick outside to the forecourt.
103.
We hear the cafe door open.
And in an instant, MATHILDE is at his table.
She is dressed in a tight black skirt, a simple blue blouse
and a dark blue jacket. Her hair is neatly styled, her make-
up immaculate and heavier than we've seen her wear before.
She looks exactly like the kind of woman who might carry a
Samsonite briefcase.
MATHILDE
Hello. I see you have brought it in
from the car with you.
She speaks quietly: her voice low and attractive.
JACK
All there, as agreed.
MATHILDE
What's in the paper bag?
The WAITRESS comes over with Jack's coffee. MATHILDE orders
another for herself.
JACK
Sweets. For your journey.
She opens the bag and takes out one of the TINS.
She can immediately feel that it's heavier than it should be.
JACK
I guessed you'd have a sweet tooth.
MATHILDE
That is most thoughtful of you.
The polite phrase sounds even more polite with her slight
Belgian accent.
The WAITRESS returns with the second espresso and MATHILDE
pays for them both.
JACK watches as she stirs her coffee to cool it. She's
nervous.
JACK
I suppose I'll read about this in
the Times or the International
Herald Tribune. Or Il Maessagiero.
For a moment she is pensive.
MATHILDE
Yes, I expect so.
104.
She drinks her coffee, holding her cup in mid-air and looking
out the window.
JACK follows her eye-line to check she's not signalling to an
accomplice.
The FORECOURT is still empty.
Creak, creak, creak, creak...
MATHILDE looks at JACK. Her expression is impossible to read.
Perhaps it's tinged with sadness. She drinks the rest of her
coffee.
MATHILDE
I'm just going to the ladies. Wait
here.
She picks up the CASE.
There is nothing JACK can do about this. She has taken him
off guard and grasped the initiative.
All he can do is wait.
145
145
MATHILDE enters a cubicle, opens the CASE, bypasses the
stationary, lifts the false bottom and checks the SOCIMI
parts are present and correct.
Then she loads a magazine.
146
146
MATHILDE returns from the bathroom.
MATHILDE
Shall we go.
Not a question, a command.
JACK is obliged to stand up.
147
151
LARRY is dusting bread crumbs off his shirt.
He's about to get his hands dirty and he doesn't like it.
LARRY
Not only did you not kill him, you
gave him my fucking money?
MATHILDE
What else could I do? There were
kids everywhere. Besides he's
suspicious.
LARRY
He's paranoid. That's why I'm
paying you the GDP of a small
country to get close to him. You
could have got him in the sack. You
should have got him in the car
park. Now you're going to have to
take him out long range!
MATHILDE
I prefer it that way.
She is a trained assassin. She respects JACK.
MATHILDE
The Socimi is the perfect weapon.
LARRY
Let's hope his workmanship is up to
scratch.
108.
He slams a full magazine into the butt of a STERLING
SUBMACHINE GUN.
LARRY
Sweden turned Jack into a
liability. Three stiffs: two
shooters and an innocent civilian.
I can't afford a mistake like that
again. Europol are crooked but they
aren't cheap. Jack's supposed to
make me money. Not run up cleaning
bills.
MATHILDE
He made short work of the last guy
you hired.
LARRY
Never mind Larson. He didn't stand
a chance, not against someone as
paranoid as Jack. The Swede was
only there to take Jack's heat off
you. So don't fuck this up again.
He grabs a TIN of fruit sweets.
LARRY
Mind if I help myself?
LARRY opens the tin to find it full of AMMUNITION.
LARRY
Shit.
He looks around the Ford.
LARRY
Is there any actual candy in this
gas guzzler?
152
