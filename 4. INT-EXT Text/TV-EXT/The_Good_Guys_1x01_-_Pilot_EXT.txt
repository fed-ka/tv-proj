      A stretch of highway. From offscreen, we hear the WAIL OF 
      SIRENS and the TERRIBLE SOUND OF METAL TEARING, the sounds of 
      an unseen COLOSSAL TRAFFIC ACCIDENT.  

      After a moment, several TANGERINES ROLL ONTO THE ROAD, moving 
      at a good sixty miles an hour. They re just an orange blur 
      until we see them rolling in SLOW-MO... it s like bullet-
      time, except for tangerines. 

      Back to normal speed as the tangerines are overtaken and 
      squashed by a PONTIAC SUNFIRE, which screams along, driving 
      as fast as a subcompact car can go. 

      Close on its heels is a TRANS-AM, which pulls up alongside 
      it. The two cars moving at a breathtaking pace, especially 
      considering that a MAN is struggling to climb OUT THE WINDOW 
      of the TRANS-AM. He is JACK (30). He leaps toward the window 
      of the Sunfire, screaming... 

                                  JACK
                      AAAAUUUUGH!!

      We FREEZE FRAME with him in midair, as we cut to black.

      Jack is parked in front of a run-down apartment building in a 
      Ford Taurus. DAN STARK (50 s) slides into the car. He s an 
      older, worn-looking version of a classic 1970 s cop, with 
      sideburns and a moustache. He sips clear liquid from a mug.

                                  DAN
                    Didn t think I d make it through 
                    that shower. But guess what I found 
                    in the conditioner bottle?

                                  JACK
                    I can t imagine. Conditioner?              JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             3.


                                  DAN
                      Peppermint schnapps! Put it there a 
                    week ago, just in case. It s called 
                    thinking ahead. Where we going?

                                  JACK
                    There was a burglary on Alarcon and 
                    12th. Some missing appliances. 

                                  DAN
                    Burglary, huh? Hey, I ever tell you-

                                  JACK
                    Yes. Whatever it is, you told me.

                                  DAN
                    I don t think so. See, back in  85, 
                    me and Frank got a call about a 
                    stolen car. Went in thinking it was- 

                                  JACK
                    - just grand theft auto.  It was 
                    Laotians smuggling heroin in the 
                    engine blocks of  86 Mustangs.

                                  DAN
                    Yeah, but I tell you about the part-

                                  JACK
                    -where you drove a Mustang into the 
                    river? Yes. Yes you did. 

                                  DAN
                    Hell, it s a good story. So we re 
                    in the water, and Frank, he looks 
                    over at me, and says  Surf s up! 

      JACK MOUTHS THE WORDS  Surf s up  as Dan says them. He sighs.

                                  JACK
                    Maybe we ll find out heroin dealers 
                    stole this lady Eileen s stuff. 
                    Then if you re lucky you can drive 
                    her car into the river.

                                  DAN
                    You watch, college boy. I bet 
                    before this is over we re gonna be 
                    dealing with some major criminals.

                                  JACK
                    Major criminals. Right. That ll 
                    happen.              JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             4.


      As they pass a MOTEL in a seedy area, we stay with the motel. 
      We RAMP across the street, to a motel room door.


      Escalante and Simon pack the GOLF BAG and the guns into a 
      PONTIAC SUNFIRE. Escalante fumes as they climb into the car.

                                  ESCALANTE (V.O.)
                    I rent my car, always driving a 
                      subcompact because you are so cheap 
                    to pay for a midsize sedan. 


      The Pontiac Sunfire is parked at a beautiful modern home. 
      Escalante and Simon emerge, walking to the door with the 
      GREEN GOLF BAG. A SLICK DRUG DEALER lets them in.

                                  ESCALANTE (V.O.)
                    I sell your cocaine for you, and 
                    you call me your chihuahua and pay 
                    me less than your pool boy. 


      Escalante and Simon stand at a FedEx Box by the road. 

                                  ESCALANTE (V.O.)
                    I took your money, you son of a 
                    whore. I hope that we meet again 
                    someday, so I can crush the life 
                    out of you with a crappy subcompact 
                    rental car. Adios. Escalante.

      Escalante puts the blood-spattered letter into a FedEx 
      envelope and drops it in the box. He turns to Simon, happy.

                                  ESCALANTE (CONT D)
                    What a country. A man can make a 
                    better life just by killing two men 
                    and stealing three million dollars. 

                                  SIMON
                    Yes. But... what about the police?

                                  ESCALANTE
                    Don t worry, Simon. In the USA, the 
                    police are slow, and lazy, and 
                    afraid to use their guns. They are 
                    like sheep, and we are like snakes.

                                  SIMON
                    Do snakes eat sheep?

                                  ESCALANTE
                    The point is, in a country like 
                    this, who can stop us? Who?


      Jack and Dan walk up the front walk of a pleasant suburban 
      house. They go to the door, knock... a beat, and the door 
      opens. EILEEN WOLFE (40, attractive) smiles out at them.

                                  JACK
                    I m Detective Bailey, and this is 
                    Detective Stark.


      Jack waits on the porch, bored out of his mind. He looks up 
      as Dan emerges from the house with Eileen. They are tousled. 

                                  DAN
                    Hey there. Find anything?              JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             7.


                                  JACK
                    Blood and hair samples. Two 
                      fingerprints. And I read a back 
                    issue of a quilting magazine.

      Jack pulls out some paperwork, holding it out for Eileen to 
      sign. She signs it, eyes on Dan, ignoring Jack entirely.

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    You ve got our number, so if you 
                    think of anything else, call us and 
                    we ll send out another minor 
                    celebrity to sleep with you.

      Dan and Eileen cuddle. She makes eyes at him...

                                  EILEEN
                    You sure you re done? You could 
                      investigate some more. 

                                  DAN
                    Later, sweetheart. I gotta fight 
                    the bad guys.


      Jack walks out of the office. His cell phone rings. 

                                  JACK
                    What?

                                  DAN (O.S.)
                    Hey there. S me.


      The parking lot of Kalfuss s office. Kalfuss waits nervously 
      with Escalante s Sunfire; some ends of clothing stick out of 
      the trunk - clearly, Escalante and Simon have been stuffed 
      inside. 

      JULIUS BROWN (30 s), a pleasant, intelligent African American 
      guy in hip clothes walks into the lot and over to Kalfuss.

                                    KALFUSS
                    Thank you for coming. You can... 
                    take care of this?

                                  JULIUS
                    Dump a car? Shouldn t be too 
                      complicated. This an insurance 
                    thing like last time, or...

                                    KALFUSS
                    No. It s... I just need it gone.

      Julius notices the clothes sticking out of the trunk. Raises 
      an eyebrow. Kalfuss pulls an envelope from his pocket.

                                    KALFUSS (CONT D)
                    Ten thousand, cash. Plus, uh... 
                    this golf bag.

                                  JULIUS
                    Sounds like we got a deal.            JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             13.


      Kalfuss smiles, nervous, then hands Julius the keys and 
      hurries off. Julius HOISTS THE GOLF BAG, gets in the car and 
      drives off as we FADE TO BLACK.


      JULIUS BROWN emerges from a MAZDA on a quiet downtown street. 
      We see that he is carrying the GREEN GOLF BAG. He walks to a 
      THRIFT SHOP, unlocks it, and goes in.

      As he does, we WHIP PAN around to JACK AND DAN, who stand up 
      the street next to their car, watching. Jack checks a file.

                                  DAN
                    Why the hell does he have a green 
                    golf bag?

                                  JACK
                    I don t know. Maybe he plays.
                          (checks a file)
                      Convictions for theft, receiving 
                    stolen property, ten different 
                    kinds of insurance fraud...

      Dan looks at Jack s computer printouts...

                                  DAN
                      Computers. I can t get used to  em. 
                    Don t you worry they re going to... 
                    you know... turn on you?

                                  JACK
                    I m not particularly worried my 
                    computer is going to attack me, no. 

                                  DAN
                    Sometimes I just look at the one in 
                    the office. It s like it s... 
                    thinking. Making plans. You know?

                                  JACK
                    Well, until it decides to rise up 
                    and overthrow humanity, it s a 
                    pretty good tool for police work.

                                  DAN
                    I dunno. There s a lot of stuff a 
                    computer can t do. I ever tell you 
                    about the time me and Frank found 
                    five thousand quaaludes-            JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             16.


                                  JACK
                    In a sock monkey? Yes. You did.

                                  DAN
                    Point is, we didn t need a 
                    computer. We just had a hunch, 
                    started cutting open sock monkeys. 

                                  JACK
                    If there s a sock monkey in there, 
                    feel free to knife it. Let s go.

      As Jack and Dan walk up the street to the thrift shop, we see 
      a SOUTH AMERICAN MAN walk into the store. Jack and Dan don t 
      pay much attention, however... Dan s telling his story, and 
      Jack is getting more and more annoyed.

                                  DAN
                    You re missing the point. See, 
                    there s a bigger picture you gotta 
                    pay attention to-

      Jack turns on Dan, frustrated. He yells:

                                  JACK
                    Enough! There s no bigger picture, 
                    all right? No major criminals, no 
                      quaaludes, just a THRIFT STORE and 
                    a STOLEN HUMIDIFIER-

      Suddenly, behind him - BANG! BANG! BANG! There is a series of 
      deafening GUNSHOTS. The window SHATTERS, glass cascading into 
      the street in a hail of buckshot. Jack and Dan both hit the 
      deck, looking at the shop as more gunfire explodes from 
      inside, glass showering into the street... 

                                  DAN
                    What the hell s going on?

                                  JACK
                    How am I supposed to know?

      Jack and Dan crawl through the street to get a better view. 
      From their POV: THE SOUTH AMERICAN MAN, his face visible 
      through the blasted window.

                                  DAN
                    WHO THE HELL IS THAT?

      Back to the SOUTH AMERICAN MAN as we MATCH CUT TO:            JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             17.



      To DR. KALFUSS, walking up the front walk of his large, 
      modern house, checking some mail. He opens the door...


      Pedro WALKING INTO thrift shop; behind him, we see Jack and 
      Dan in the middle of the argument they were having earlier...


      We rejoin Jack and Dan in the street, as Dan runs toward the 
      side of the thrift shop. Jack runs after him.

                                  DAN
                    Police! Drop your weapons!

      From inside, there are TWO MORE GUNSHOTS. Dan grins...

                                  DAN (CONT D)
                    Cover me. I m going in.

                                  JACK
                    You re serious? You drank a quart 
                    of Southern Comfort in the car-

                                  DAN
                    That was a fifth. It lubricates the 
                    joints.

      Dan runs for the door. Jack hesitates, then runs after him.


      Dan scrambles onto the roof from the fire escape ladder. FROM 
      HIS POV we see Pedro in the street, firing after Julius as he 
      pulls away in the Mazda.

                                  DAN
                    Hold it right there! Don t move!

      Without breaking stride, Pedro SPINS and FIRES AT DAN. Dan 
      ducks behind an air conditioning unit as he runs...            JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             22.



      Pedro gets into his car, starting it. He looks around. Dan is 
      nowhere to be found, until... WHAM! Dan lands on the hood of 
      the car. It s a hard impact, as painful as it looks.

                                  DAN
                    FREEZE!

      Pedro sighs as he puts the car in gear and hits the gas. Dan 
      looks around, alarmed at the swiftly accelerating car.  

                                  PEDRO
                    You are a brave man. I do not want 
                    to kill you. 

                                  DAN
                    Stop this car, Damnit!

      Pedro shrugs and SLAMS on the brakes. Dan flies off the car. 
      Pedro watches... a beat, and he drives off. FADE TO BLACK.


      Jack stands in his driveway by his car, holding his cell 
      phone. He is clearly torn, as he considers the phone... 
      Finally, he dials. A few rings... LIZ answers.

                                  LIZ
                    Liz Townsend.

                                  JACK
                    It s me. I m sorry to bother you on 
                    your cell. I just...

                                  JACK (CONT'D)
                    I need to ask you something. It s 
                    sort of important.


      Jack and Dan stand at the doorway to Kalfuss s house. Dan 
      rings the doorbell. A beat. Nothing. He tries the door...

                                  DAN
                    S open. Let s go in, take a peek.

                                  JACK
                    Dan, anything we  peek  at is 
                      inadmissable in court. We ve got no 
                    probable cause to walk into-

      BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The door SPLINTERS under a HAIL OF BULLETS. 

                                  DAN
                    Howzat for probable?

      Off Jack s look...

                                      ACT THREE


      Jack and Dan are flat on the ground, covering their heads as  
      AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE destroys the door and perforates Jack s car 
      in the driveway. 

                                  DAN
                    You think the lawyers are gonna be 
                    cool if we go in? 

                                  JACK
                    You have no idea who s in there!

      The gunfire stops... Dan peeks around. Grins.

                                  DAN
                    I will soon.

      Dan raises his gun and CHARGES through the door, GUN 
      BLASTING. Jack follows-


      Julius bursts through the back door with Jack close on his 
      heels. He takes off into the desert. 

                                  JACK
                    FREEZE! NOW!

      Jack runs hard, gaining on Julius and CATCHING HIM. In a 
      series of PRECISE MARTIAL ARTS MOVES, he puts Julius on the 
      ground in a painful arm-bar.

                                  DAN (O.S.)
                    Atta boy! For a moment, I coulda 
                    sworn you were Frank. Where d you 
                    learn that fancy ninja stuff?

      Jack turns and sees Dan at the back door of the brothel,  
      surrounded by scantily clad women. 

                                  JACK

      Dan pulls some cuffs... 

                                  DAN
                    Whatever. Let s round this punk up. 
                    We got a golf bag to open.

                                        ACT FOUR


      Escalante s Pontiac Sunfire lies crumpled at the bottom of a 
      gorge in Mexico. A title reads: Mexico. Two Days Earlier.

      From inside the trunk, a thump. Another thump, and the trunk 
      opens. Escalante emerges, in a surgical gown, screaming.

                                  ESCALANTE
                        AAAAAAAUUUUUGGHHH!!!!

      Birds fly into the sky. Escalante climbs out of the trunk, 
      looking around, bewildered. He sees the crumpled Pontiac, 
      sees the reflection of his mangled face in a side mirror.

                                  ESCALANTE (CONT D)
                      AAAAAAAUUUUGH!!!!

      Escalante pulls a picture of Erik Estrada from a pile of 
        bloodstained pictures in the bottom of the trunk. He looks at 
      the picture. Looks at his reflection.  

                                  ESCALANTE (CONT D)
                      Revenge...

      Grimacing, he takes a pistol from the trunk. He looks up at 
      the wall of the steep gorge... And begins to climb.


      Escalante stumbles along the side of the road, his clothes 
      filthy and torn. His mangled face is grim, determined.

      Escalante sees a car on the horizon. A yellow Pontiac 
      Sunfire. He stares at it in disbelief, waving it down. It 
      pulls to a stop. A TOURIST, pokes his head out the window...

                                    TOURIST
                    You need something, buddy?            JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             39.


      Escalante puts the pistol to the tourist s forehead. 

                                  ESCALANTE
                    Get out of the car.


      Dan runs into the street as Escalante turns a corner.

                                  DAN
                    HEY! STOP!!

      Too late. Desperate, he looks around... ANGLE ON the car 
      dealership they passed the day before. The TRANS-AM.


      Romero emerges from the bar, running for his car. He is 
      almost at the car, when he hears a noise at the other end of 
      the parking lot. He looks up, curious...


      Romero sees the Sunfire SCREAMING TOWARD HIM. He squints at 
      the driver, in shocked disbelief:

                                  ROMERO
                      Escalante?

      WHAM! Romero is CREAMED by Escalante s car. Inside, Escalante 
      howls with triumph as he jams the car into reverse. The car 
      thumps over Romero s body again... 


      Romero is on the ground, his hand clutching the golf bag in a 
      death grip. Escalante begins kicking Romero again and again. 

                                  ESCALANTE
                    That is for taking my frequent 
                    flyer miles! That is for calling me 
                    your chihuahua at Hernan s wedding- 

      Escalante continues kicking and screaming unintelligibly. 


      Jack emerges from the ranch. He looks around, desperate for 
      some way to follow Escalante. Nothing. He keys his radio:

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    Backup! I need backup here! Are 
                    there any units available-

      Cut off by the LOW GROWL of a BIG ENGINE...

      ANGLE ON DAN. At the wheel of the Trans-Am. Grinning.


      Back to the chaos of the chase. Escalante weaves through 
      traffic, narrowly missing three cars as he drives on THE 
      WRONG SIDE OF THE MEDIAN STRIP.


      The Trans-Am gains on the smaller Sunfire, both cars weaving 
      through traffic.

      INSIDE THE SUNFIRE, Escalante pulls his pistol and FIRES at 
      an approaching FRUIT TRUCK, which SWERVES... And TIPS OVER as 
      they pass, sending a cascade of TANGERINES onto the road. 
      It s the IMAGE FROM THE OPENING, tangerines rolling along... 

      INSIDE THE TRANS-AM, Dan hits the gas, and they pull up 
      alongside the Sunfire. 

      INSIDE THE SUNFIRE, Eileen sees who is at the wheel...

                                  EILEEN
                    Dan...

                                  ESCALANTE
                    That is your boyfriend?

      He FIRES out the window at the Trans-Am... 

                                  ESCALANTE (CONT D)
                    Your woman dies with me!!            JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             51.



      Jack catches up with Dan as they walk to the ruined Trans-Am. 

                                  DAN
                    I thought we d go down and talk to 
                    Julius. See if he s got any leads.

                                  JACK
                    Leads on what?

                                  DAN
                    Whatever. Leads. You know.

                                  JACK
                    Sounds... great. 

      Jack sighs. Dan fishes in his pocket, remembering something.

                                  DAN
                    Oh, hey... This came in the mail.

      Dan hands Jack a letter written in small, neat script. The 
      return address is Cuzco, Peru. In V.O., we hear Pedro:

                                  PEDRO (V.O.)
                    I am not a man of many words, but I 
                    feel the need to send this to you. 
                    In all of my years as an assassin - 
                    first as the second best in the 
                    world, and now as the first - I 
                    have seen much. But never have I 
                      encountered men such as yourselves. 
                    I have returned to my country, 
                    where I will tell my children of 
                    the bravery and honor of the two 
                    American police, Dan and Jack. 
                      Sincerely, Pedro.

      Jack looks in the envelope, and finds a picture of Pedro, 
      with Esteban and Felipe. Felipe holds a fork, smiling. Jack 
      smiles despite himself, tucking the letter in his pocket.

                                  DAN
                    You ready to go bust some punks?

                                  JACK
                    Yeah. Let s go bust some punks.

      They get into the beat-up Trans-Am. It roars to life, tires 
      squealing on the pavement as we... FADE TO BLACK.
