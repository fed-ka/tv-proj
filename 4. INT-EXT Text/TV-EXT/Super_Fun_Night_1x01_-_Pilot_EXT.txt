      Friday night. We swoop into New York City, landing on the 
      windowsill of an apartment building. We see a solitary pigeon 
      settle into its unexciting nest as a busy street bustles 
      below.

                                  KIMMIE (O.S.)
                Okay, and recording...

                                                                              CUT TO:


      We see JAZMINE (Kimmie s YOUNGER SISTER) and her boyfriend 
      JASON (a tanned hunk-a-licious buffoon) dancing on his car. 
      Jason performs his  proposal  routine. 

                                  JASON
                      (singing)
                  JAZ-MINE! 
                I WANT YOU TO BE MINE! FOREVER!
                I KNOW I M JUST A
                  DOUCHE-DOUCHE-DOUCHE- 
                  POTENTIAL REALITY T.V. STAR
                BUT I LOVE YOUR ASS-ASS-ASS-
                AND YOUR PERSONALITY!

      Jason ends on a big dance move, then jumps off the car and 
      hands Jazmine a box.

                                    JAZMINE
                      (opening box)
                Oh my God!! What s this!!

                                  JASON
                It s a note that says,  Diamond to 
                come, yo! 

      They kiss passionately. Kimmie stands there awkwardly.

                                    JASMINE
                Oh my God, Kimmie! Aren t you happy 
                for me!!

                                  KIMMIE
                  (WEIRDLY) Yes.

                                    JASMINE
                You know, you d be married, too, if 
                you stopped hanging out with those two 
                losers.

                                                                        POP BACK TO:      SUPER FUN NIGHT     Shooting Script 1/22/13       3.

      Monday morning. Kimmie, Helen-Alice and Marika, dressed for 
      work, are in front of Kimmie s law firm.

                                  KIMMIE
                Do you think this skirt looks good? 
                It s not too tight, is it?

                                    HELEN-ALICE
                Well, it is --

                                  MARIKA
                -I don t think it s too tight.

                                  KIMMIE
                      (nervous)
                I just want to go up there, and be 
                  impressive.

                                  MARIKA
                You are impressive, Kimmie. Remember 
                when you once ate that whole wheel of 
                cheese?

                                  KIMMIE
                Yeah.. 

                                  MARIKA

                 IT S TIME TO TRY DEFYING GRAVITY /

                                                                              CUT TO:


      Marika is out on the courts giving a BOY a tennis lesson. She 
      talks on her sporty headset to Kimmie. 

                                  MARIKA
                      (into phone; grunting)
                Uh! Kimmie, I hate to break it to you, 
                but this guy sounds gay.

                                                                        CUT BACK TO:

                      (into phone)
                Who was that? She sounds like she has 
                nice hair... Kimmie?

      Marika serves and accidentally hits her student in the 
      nutsack.

                                  MARIKA (CONT D)
                Ooo right in the manbags.
                      (to student)
                Sorry, champ. Shouldn t talk and 
                serve...

      Thursday. Kimmie, Helen-Alice and Marika sit in the park on 
      their lunch break.

                                    HELEN-ALICE
                No. We don t go out. We haven t been 
                out since... since...

      Beat.

                                    HELEN-ALICE / KIMMIE / MARIKA
                Prom.

                                    HELEN-ALICE
                And everybody laughed at us... even 
                  Wheelchair Becky.

                                                                              CUT TO:

                                    HELEN-ALICE
                Kimmie, if you go out, at night, 
                you re 28 times more likely to be 
                  kidnapped and end up in Mexico.

                                  MARIKA
                And I can t eat burritos for the rest 
                of my life. Not with my gas.

      Helen-Alice picks up her binoculars.

                                    HELEN-ALICE
                      (looking)
                Ooooo! Is that a!... Nah, it s just a 
                lost kid.

                Guys, please, Richard is really, 
                really nice. All week we ve been 
                  developing this deep, meaningful 
                  connection.

                                                                              CUT TO:

                Kimmie, you can t go out to another 
                guy s drinks. What would Michael say?

                                  KIMMIE
                Um, nothing. I think we may have 
                broken up.

                                  MARIKA
                Over what?

                                  KIMMIE
                Over a year ago. But who cares, I ve 
                moved on -- and I feel like a drink!

                Next stop, Slutsville. Austria.

                                  KIMMIE
                No, next stop: Fun.

                Um, excuse me, I m the  Fun Master  
                here. I m in charge of the fun.

      Helen-Alice maybe opens her jacket to reveal a T-shirt which 
      says,  Fun Master.

                And this Friday I ve already decided

                I have above average flexibility, 
                Kimmie!

      Helen-Alice does the half-splits.

                                    HELEN-ALICE (CONT D)
                Just say the truth. Now that you re 
                  promoted, you think you re too good 
                for us. 

                                  KIMMIE
                No, not at all. I love you guys!

                                  MARIKA
                I love you, too, Kimmie...

      She gives her a loving look.

                                  KIMMIE
                That s why I m asking you to come with 
                me. I can t do this by myself. So 
                please!!

                                    HELEN-ALICE
                Kimmie, I can t, you know I have that 
                thing...

                                  KIMMIE
                What thing?

                                    HELEN-ALICE
                Stewart Syndrome. Certain social 
                  environments make me panic.

                                  KIMMIE
                That s not a real thing.

                                    HELEN-ALICE
                Uhhh... excuse me, Kristen Stewart has 
                it.  Allegedly.

                                  MARIKA
                How come you never told me you had a 
                thing??

                                    HELEN-ALICE
                Because sometimes you can t be trusted 
                with secrets, Marika.

                I think so, yeah.

                Oh, I love pasta bars -- you ve hit me 
                in the heart, Kim-o-therapy. I m in.

      Kimmie and Marika start to go.

                Kimmie, please, any outfit looks hot 
                if it s on me! Just ask my brothers.

      Beat. Helen-Alice is left all on her lonesome.

                know people with Stewart Syndrome 
                can t be left alone in a park... 
                Alright, I ll come, but if you wanna 
                be Fun Master, you ll have to cancel 
                the cats! And it s not easy speaking 
                to Bethany!! She has a heavy lisp.

      Kimmie, Marika and Helen-Alice approach an Abercrombie & 
      Fitch-type store called BANGe & SWAYZe. A gorgeous, shirtless 
      African American MALE MODEL mans the door.

                No. When people stare at my abs it 
                warms my heart.

      That Friday night. Pigeons scatter as Kimmie, Helen-Alice and 
      Marika are now out on a city street. Cool rap music plays as 
      they strut in SLO-MO, dressed to impress (a blind person). 
      Kimmie takes off her jacket revealing a tight dress made for 
      a skinny girl. Marika carries a large tennis bag. Helen-Alice 
      has clearly made her own clothes out of curtains. A blind guy 
      gives them a  thumbs up.  THESE BIRDS ARE FREE!

      Kimmie furiously tries to open a back door further down the 
      building. She s now a physical wreck -- Helen-Alice and 
      Marika are sitting down.

                                  MARIKA
                Kimmie, I know you don t want to, but 
                  sometimes you just have to forfeit.

                                  KIMMIE

      Helen-Alice gets up and passes Kimmie her dagger. Kimmie 
      manages to shimmy open the door with the knife.

                                  KIMMIE

                If any of us gets lost from the pack, 
                just go like this --

      Kimmie swings her glow-stick over her head.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      The girls walk back around towards the front of the club 
      throughout this scene. Helen-Alice is clearly having a panic 
      attack.

                                  KIMMIE
                  Helen-Alice, what s wrong?

                                    HELEN-ALICE
                What do you think is wrong, Kimmie? We 
                came out. We got rejected. We got 
                laughed at. We saw my co-worker. Who s 
                been violated by a dolphin. Now at 
                work I ll be forced to say something 
                nice to her like,  It s true, dolphins 
                are the pedophiles of the sea.  Now I 
                have a visual image in my mind of her 
                being penetrated by a prehensile penis 
                - PLUS I can t breathe!!

      Helen-Alice is panicking. Marika grabs an empty tennis ball 
      can out of her tennis bag.

                                  MARIKA
                Here, blow into my ball can.

                to be the Fun Master. Right now we are

                Felicity said networking is 
                  everything, so I ll probably get 
                demoted -- but who cares! I have 
                chafing. Really bad chafing. So let s 
                just all go home!

      Kimmie walks off,  airing  her chafing by walking with her 
      legs apart.

                                  MARIKA
                Oh, but wait, what about the pasta 
                bar?

                                  KIMMIE
                There is no pasta bar, Marika! I made 
                it up!

      Kimmie walks off.

                                  MARIKA
                Whoa! What do you mean there s no 
                pasta bar!! 

      Marika grabs Kimmie by the back of her dress.

                                  KIMMIE
                Marika, get off me --

      But Marika holds tight as Kimmie lunges forward. The zipper 
      running the length of Kimmie s dress breaks apart 
      spectacularly and Kimmie is left standing with just her 
      underwear on (not revealing... potentially has the flashing 
      underwear on Marika held up from the clothing store scene).

                                  KIMMIE (CONT D)
                Well, this night couldn t get any --

      But at that moment a secret SIDE EXIT DOOR from the club 
      swings open. Richard enters.

                Kimmie?

                                  KIMMIE

                      (pulling out her dagger)
                Okay, nobody move. 

      Richard races to protect Kimmie. He clearly thinks that she 
      is being mugged.

                                    RICHARD
                Whoa! Whoa!
                      (holding her)
                Are you alright?

      Richard gives Kimmie his jacket. 

                                    RICHARD (CONT D)
                      (to Kimmie, re: Marika)
                I m not sure if I can take the knife  
                AND butch Jodie Foster, but I ll try --

                No, Richard, it s fine. These are my 
                friends. My best friends. Stand down, 
                  Helen-Alice.

      Helen-Alice puts the knife away. Richard s gimp eye might 
      appear here - a recall from the earlier office scene, 
      indicating he s had a drink.

                                  KIMMIE (CONT D)
                We tried to get into the club but the 
                bouncer wouldn t let us in.

                                    RICHARD
                Oh, Lord. Well, just come in with me.

                                  KIMMIE
                Really? 

                                    RICHARD
                Of course. Come in now. You re 
                  literally flashing everyone.

      But at that moment Felicity exits from the side door.

                                  FELICITY
                Oh, Richard, there you are. Let s go 
                get that nightcap.

                      (to Felicity)
                She had trouble getting into the club.

                                  FELICITY
                Oh, really? That s terrible. Well, if 
                you or your girls ever need my help, 
                you should just call me. Anytime.

      Felicity hands Kimmie her card.

                                  KIMMIE
                Oh, thank you, Felicity.  You re the 
                best.

                                  FELICITY
                That s what Joseph Gordon-Levitt said 
                last night. Don t tell anyone.
                      (then)
                Richard, shall we?

                                    RICHARD

                Oh, um.. um... Yes, of course. See you 
                Monday, Kimmie!

      Richard exits the alleyway with Felicity. He stops and turns 
      back around.

                                    RICHARD (CONT D)
                No, wait...

      We think Richard might be changing his mind. But then:

                      (to Kimmie)
                Oh, no.  Keep the jacket.

      As Richard hails a taxi, Felicity walks up to the bouncer.

                                  FELICITY

                list more carefully.

      She deviously slips him $100, then smiles. Kimmie sees 
      Richard and Felicity then drive off in a taxi together. Helen-

                                                                        CUT BACK TO:


      When Richard put his jacket around Kimmie, in SLO-MO, we see 
      that he did in fact ACCIDENTALLY brush Kimmie s boob.

                Oh man, this is the best threesome 
                ever!

      We re back on the windowsill of the girls  apartment 
      building. We see our pigeon in it s nest, but now there s two 
      other pigeons either side. They have glow bracelets around 
      their necks. They are content.

                                                                            FADE OUT.
