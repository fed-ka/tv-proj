steps out of the shadow demonstrating he doesn't really look 
like Frankenstein.

CONTINUED:

A porch lamp gave him a square-headed, bolt-necked shadow.  
He is a handsome, gangly man appearing late 30s, stitched 
together from the corpses of many men.

MEET HERMAN MUNSTER.

Standing next to him is his son Eddie, wearing a Boy Scout 
uniform and a tight, weight-of-the-world expression, still 
slightly marred, scratched and bruised from his unexpected 
evening of Lycanthropy during the Boy Scout camp out.

EDDIE
This is very abrupt.

HERMAN
A happy confluence of events that 
happened to coincide with an 
unfortunate baby bear attack.

EDDIE
A lot of fuss over a baby bear 
attack I don't even remember.

HERMAN
Be glad you don't remember.  It 
ravaged you and tossed your naked 
body into the shrubs.  And that 
baby bear is still out there.

EDDIE
We didn't have to leave town.  It 
wasn't going to follow me home.

HERMAN
Not right away, but wait 29 days.

EDDIE
What happens in 29 days?

HERMAN
That's about how long it takes a 
baby bear to re-group.

Eddie's unsure dad knows of what he speaks, then laments:

EDDIE
I didn't say goodbye to anybody.

HERMAN
Moving away is a form of goodbye.





(CONTINUED)6.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE
Did Grandpa try to eat somebody 
again?  That why we had to leave?

HERMAN
No.  Not Grandpa.  Watch yourself.

Eddie pulls open a trap door in the floor, glancing down the 
opening of a spiral stone staircase.  He takes a coin out of 
his pocket and flicks it into the dark.  It TING-TING-TING-
TING-TINGS into the depths of the house as Eddie wonders:

EDDIE
If we see any dead hobos, I could 
earn a Fingerprinting merit badge 
and find their families.

TING-TING-TING, growing more and more distant.

HERMAN
Oh, honey.  They're hobos.  They 
don't have families.

The TING-TING-TING finally recedes into empty silence, then:

EDDIE
Grandpa said I had a condition.

HERMAN
He did?

EDDIE
He said it like he says it when he 
says Marilyn has a condition.  But 
he said my condition cleared up.  

HERMAN
I'm sure it's a different condition.  

EDDIE
I like being like Marilyn.

HERMAN
Don't say that in front of Grandpa.  
Say you like being like your dad.  
It'll be equally aggravating.  And you 
do get that condition from me.  

EDDIE
Which one of you?  

HERMAN
This one of me.  



(CONTINUED)7.

CONTINUED: (2)

He puts Eddie's hand on his chest affectionately.  Eddie 
smiles, then notices with curiosity not concern:

EDDIE
Your heart feels funny.

"Because its breaking," is what Herman wants to say but 
instead heaves a sigh, covering with a semi-cheerful smile.

HERMAN
That's how I know who I am when I'm 
made of so many different people.  


TWO REFRIGERATOR-SIZED CRATES are strapped securely to the 
floor and walls of the cargo container.  CAMERA PUSHES IN TO 
AN EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF A CRATE TO REVEAL ICICLES FORMING.


Two delivery men -- MR. GARCIA (driving) and MR. PEREZ 
(passenger) -- stare at the road, a tension between them.  
Mr. Perez exhales and his breath fogs in the cold air.  He 
reaches for the a/c controls to adjust the temperature. Both 
Mr. Garcia and Mr. Perez speak only in Spanish:

There s a sudden, jolty, draggy, THUMP-KRRRRR from the back.  
Mr. Perez and Mr. Garcia exchanged a concerned glance.

CUT TO:

BLACK.  TWO DOORS OPEN TO REVEAL WE ARE --


The Delivery Truck has pulled over to the side of the road.  

Mr. Perez and Mr. Garcia open the cargo container doors and 
flick a switch.  A dim bulb provides barely enough light, but 
enough to see patches of icy frost on the two wooden crates.  
Mr. Garcia feels the crate with his bare hand, jumping at how 
sharp the cold is against his palm.

MR. PEREZ

Mr. Garcia turns to see, standing in the road about twenty 
feet from the back of the delivery truck, A LARGE BLACK WOLF.  
He nudges Mr. Perez and by the time he turns to look, there 
are FIVE LARGE BLACK WOLVES standing in the road behind them.

Both gentlemen grab a crow bar and calmly climb out of the 
back of the truck, closing and locking the doors.  The FIVE 
LARGE BLACK WOLVES watch inscrutably silent.  Then they all 
take a calculated step forward, herding Mr. Garcia and Mr. 
Perez back to the cab of the truck.  As they scramble into:


Mr. Garcia and Mr. Perez quickly climb inside, slamming their 
doors behind them.  They can see the FIVE LARGE BLACK WOLVES 
in their rear view mirrors.  Mr. Garcia starts the engine.


ON THE TRAY OF DELICIOUS BUTTER COOKIES AS...

PLIP-PLIP-PLIP, a SINGLE DROP OF GRANDPA'S BLOOD lands on 
each cookie, BLOSSOMING INTO A DECORATIVE CRIMSON HEART.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL WE ARE:


DARKNESS.  CLICK as 10 YEAR OLD MARILYN turns on the light to 
catch a TERRIFYING bloody-mawed GRANDPA feeding on a BURGLAR.  

GRANDPA
Go back to bed.

10 Year Old Marilyn shuts off the light with a bookend CLICK 
before she turns heel and does as instructed.

SMASH BACK TO:


The FOGGY CLOUD starts to COALESCE, REVEALING a NAKED HERMAN 
lying in bed on top of rumpled sheets.  He's sexy despite or 
 quality of his body,  quilt perhaps because of the  athletic
assembled from the corpses of great men.  He heaves a long, 
post-coital sigh and exhales a puff of cloud mist that is 
part of his wife Lily - who is coalescing into her now 
identifiable self, floating above Herman.

Herman runs his finger down Lily's chest along her stomach, 
leaving a vapor trail in its wake.  A quiet moment, then:

LILY
I wonder if this would have 
happened sooner if I breast fed.

HERMAN
I have to assume you're talking 
about Eddie.  

LILY
Evidently it's important.

HERMAN
 want the Probably, but we didn t
baby drinking blood and you were so 
nervous about holding him after 
what your sister did to Marilyn.




(CONTINUED)14.

CONTINUED:

LILY
That was postpartum.

HERMAN
Mmm-hmm.

Lily drifts down from the ceiling, laying next to Herman.

LILY
Mothers who breast feed are closer 
 a fact.  A to their babies.  It s
 suckling baby changes the mother s
brain and makes them love harder.

HERMAN
 love Eddie any harder.You couldn t

LILY
I could have if I breast fed.  He 
was just so pink and chubby.

HERMAN
We have to stop thinking of him as 
fragile and or edible.  
(then)
He's asking questions.

LILY
I don't want him to know.

HERMAN
He's going to find out.

LILY
We have at least two more baby bear 
attacks before he gets suspicious.

HERMAN
He needs someone to talk to.  The 
only other werewolf Eddie knows is 
your brother and he's a sad sack of 
hair and teeth and self-loathing.

LILY
Eddie can talk to Grandpa.

HERMAN
Grandpa hand stitched your brother's 
sad sack of self-loathing.  

A personal issue for Herman.  Lily proceeds with caution.




(CONTINUED)15.

LILY
Eddie is taking after Grandpa.

QUICK POP:

HERMAN'S HEART

Stapled, stitched and steam-punked together with various 
valves and bolts -- but PUMPING.  PLINK.  A staple pops.

BACK TO:

HERMAN

His face tightens, but he doesn't say a word.

 VOICEA WOMAN S
(pre-lap)
I'm so sorry for your loss.


A haunted, distracted Herman is wearing a tasteful black suit 
and tie to honor the deceased as he hosts a MEMORIAL SERVICE 
as part of his job at the Funeral Home.  He s approached by a 
MOURNING WOMAN named MELANIE (50s).

HERMAN
I'm not mourning.  I work here.  

MELANIE
You look very snappy in the 
uniform.  Have you worked in the 
funeral services industry long?

HERMAN
Centuries --

MELANIE
(cutting him off)
Damn it.  You're married.

She turns the band of Herman's wedding ring around and 
partially unscrews his entire finger, nail-side down.

HERMAN
(screws it back in)
Double jointed.

MELANIE
How did you meet your wife?




(CONTINUED)16.

CONTINUED:

HERMAN
It was arranged.  I was arranged.  
The parts of me.  By her father.
(changing the subject)
How do you know the deceased?

MELANIE
I don t know them.  Or any of these 
people except some of the regulars.  

She nods to an ELDERLY MAN, who nods back.

MELANIE (CONT D)
You offer a wonderful soup bar.

She indicates the SOUP BAR dispensing hearty flavors from 
decorative pots through spigot taps.

HERMAN
You come here for soup?

MELANIE
 providing a service.  Nothing I m
sadder than a poorly attended funeral.  
So I dress appropriately, behave 
respectfully and enjoy the soup.  

She takes sip of soup and glances at the occupied coffin.

MELANIE (CONT D)
I heard somebody saying something 
about him being a dancer.

HERMAN
They're a whole family of dancers.

MELANIE
Whole family of anything is weird.  
They didn't all want to be dancers.  
You can't love your children based 
on how much of you you see in them.

It strikes a chord and we HEAR a MUFFLED PLINK from inside 
Herman's chest.  He exhales a sad little "uhhf" sound.

MELANIE (CONT D)
(hopeful)
Was that disgust?

HERMAN
No.  That was despair.




(CONTINUED)17.

CONTINUED: (2)

Herman seems to mull that over as he eyes the DEAD MAN'S LEGS 
flaunted in the open casket, then:

HERMAN (CONT D)
I wonder how good a dancer he was.

CLOSE ON - THREADED NEEDLE - WOUND P.O.V.

CAMERA LOOKS UP THE LENGTH OF THE NEEDLE at Herman, who 
concentrates as he STITCHES TWO FLAPS OF SKIN TOGETHER 
(CLOSING OVER THE FRAME as Herman sews).  We are --


Herman sits on the table next to an OPEN COFFIN.  The DEAD 
MAN inside has no legs below the knees (cuffs neatly rolled) 
because Herman is currently STITCHING them onto his own body.

CLICKITY-CLICKITY-CLICKITY-CLICKITY as Herman TAP DANCES

He CLICKITY-CLICKITY-CLICKITYs then suddenly stops dancing

knees TOWARD CAMERA in his big dance finale ala Gene Kelley.  

CAMERA MOVES THROUGH THE FABRIC OF HIS SHIRT to FIND:

HERMAN'S STEAM PUNK HEART

PINKPINKPINK-FTHUNK.  The remaining staples POP and a GASKET

Ashen and slack-jawed, he falls over broken-hearted and dead.

CUT TO BLACK.


END OF ACT ONE18.


ACT TWO


Grandpa has Herman on the slab with his chest open.  His  
stitched and stapled heart rests beating on a metal pan.  A 
brief moment as Herman gets his bearings, then:

HERMAN
Shame on you for shoddy 
craftsmanship.

GRANDPA
You broke your own heart.  Shame on 
you for being so sentimental.  

HERMAN
It's my heart.  It's sentimental by 
definition.

Grandpa unceremoniously tips the metal pan, sliding Herman s 
heart into a trash pail.  Herman fishes it right back out.

HERMAN (CONT D)
That's my last original part.



(CONTINUED)19.

CONTINUED:

GRANDPA
Ruined.  All your fretting about 
Eddie has taken its toll.  

HERMAN
I'm not worried about Eddie.  He's 
going to be just fine.

As the words leave his mouth, Herman knows they feel odd.

GRANDPA
He is but he's not going to be fine 
how you think he's going to be fine 
which you won't be fine with.

HERMAN
(re: battery pump)
Take it out.  I don't like how it 
feels.  Doesn't feel like me.  I'm 
incapacitated with worry, this isn't. 
(re: his heart)
Put that back in.  Take this out.  
Put that back in.  Clean it first.

Grandpa sets about cleaning Herman's steam-punk heart using 
various steams, soaps and scrubs.

GRANDPA
You're too attached to how things 
were.  Only were now is were-wolf.
Can't be a Munster and a Boy Scout.  

HERMAN
If Eddie wants to be a Boy Scout, 
that's what Eddie's going to be.

GRANDPA
First rule of Scout Law is "help 
others at all times."  That's going 
to be difficult for Eddie when he's 
blacking out and waking up naked.

HERMAN
I know what's best for Eddie.

GRANDPA
Really?  Have you raised a werewolf 
before?  Cause I have.

HERMAN
Have you raised one successfully?




(CONTINUED)20.

CONTINUED: (2)

Grandpa stares at Herman than slaps his weathered steam-punk 
heart back into the cavity of his chest.  Much better.

GRANDPA
Tell Eddie there is no Baby Bear.

To punctuate that point, Grandpa staples -- K'CHUN-K'CHUN-
K'CHUN-K'CHUNK -- Herman's CHEST PLATE over his heart.

HERMAN
I'm going to need a stronger heart.

GRANDPA
Perhaps you should ask Lily to 
bring one home from work.

CAMERA PUSHES DOWN an aisle of PET KENNELS like a shot out of 
a BUSBY BERKELEY NUMBER as one after another in choreographed 
succession, a LINE OF DOGS delivers garbage bags to a bin.  

CAMERA FINDS LILY behind the counter wearing an employee 
badge as a CUSTOMER ENTERS and notices the strange parade.

CUSTOMER
Are they cleaning their own cages?

LILY
Yes.

BACK TO:


Eddie listens, rapt, as Scout Master Steve weaves a web of 
charm and enthusiasm.  Herman smiles over one shoulder, happy 
his son is happy.  Grandpa scowls over the other shoulder.  A 
DOZEN AND A HALF BOYS (10-17) mill about in the background.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
And a Scout uniform is our super 
hero costume.  That neckerchief is 
a cape.  Those merit badges are the 
armor of experience and adventure.

EDDIE
How many merit badges do you have?

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
All of them.

(MORE)


(CONTINUED)24.

CONTINUED:
SCOUT MASTER STEVE (CONT'D)
Do you like camping, Eddie?  Annual 
Scout Jamboree is almost upon us.

Eddie opens his mouth to answer and Herman quickly chimes in, 
keeping rhythm with his tapping feet.  CLICKITY-CLICK.

HERMAN
The last time Eddie went camping 
there was a baby bear attack.

GRANDPA
Allegedly.

EDDIE
I don't remember the baby bear.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
Troop One One Zero?

Eddie nods.  CLICKITY-CLICKITY-CLICKITY-CLACK.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE (CONT D)
Eddie, why don't you lead the rest 
of the troop in the Scout Oath?

Scout Master Steve ushers Eddie toward the rest of the 
Scouts.  Once he's out of ear-shot:

SCOUT MASTER STEVE (CONT D)
My heart feels for the little guy.

GRANDPA
It does?  Would you say that's a 
healthy heart?  Athletic?  No 
family history of disease?

HERMAN
Grandpa.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
It's a big heart, can tell you that 
much.  With a lot of love to give.  

In the background, Eddie leads his fellow scouts in the Oath:

EDDIE AND THE SCOUTS
(in jagged unison)
On my honor, I will do my best to 
do my duty to God and my country; 
To obey the Scout Law; To help 
other people at all times; To keep 
myself physically strong...




(CONTINUED)25.

CONTINUED: (2)

Scout Master Steve smiles proudly at the well-behaved Scouts.

HERMAN
Which one is yours?

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
None of them.  My wife was barren.  
Ever since she died, these boys 
have become my whole life.

HERMAN
You're a widower?

GRANDPA
That's so sad.  Bet that big heart 
of yours misses her very much.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
Every day.  

GRANDPA
Must be hard to go on after 
something like that.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
(cheerful)
Way I figure, I'm still here so 
there must be a reason for it.

Grandpa slowly and pointedly looks at Herman.

CUT TO BLACK.


END OF ACT TWO26.


ACT THREE


Marilyn, Grandpa and Eddie sit in a camouflaged hut, watching 
the deer feed on the tall grass.  They speak in hushed tones:

MARILYN
The deer eats the plants and 
someday, when the deer dies, he'll 
fertilize the ground so more grass 
will grow so more deer can eat.

EDDIE
That's considerate.

MARILYN
It's the circle of life.

GRANDPA
There's an important intermediary 
step we're forgetting.  The deer 
eats the plants and then is itself 
eaten and the thing that ate it 
dies and it fertilizes the ground 
so more grass will grow so more 
deer can eat.  And then be eaten.

MARILYN
But some deer can live long lives.

To dispute that fact, A MOUNTAIN LION launches out of the 
shrubs and devours the Deer eating grass.  Eddie's eyes widen 
in terror, but Marilyn places a hand on his shoulder:

MARILYN (CONT D)
Circle of life.

GRANDPA
That's nature.  

MARILYN
Mountain lions are so tidy.

GRANDPA
Hard to fault a tidy predator.



(CONTINUED)27.

CONTINUED:

MARILYN
(to Eddie)
Also as an intermediary step, 
sometimes deer want to be eaten.  
They're depressed and lonely.  So 
that lion's doing the deer a favor.

EDDIE
That deer didn't look depressed.

Marilyn can't bring herself to argue her point.

MARILYN
I know.  I thought I saw it smile.

EDDIE
Does anything eat the lion?

A giant, terrifying WOLF LEAPS ATOP THE LION, digging in.

MARILYN
Grandpa.

Eddie realizes Grandpa is no longer sitting next to him.  The 
WOLF, now transformed into naked, bloody-mouthed Grandpa, 
looks up and smiles sweetly over the partially devoured lion.

GRANDPA
It's nature.

OFF Eddie's slack jawed horror...

CUT TO:

A DRESSER CHEST

A drawer slides open REVEALING EDDIE tucked inside.  We are --


Lily sits on her bed and waits for Eddie to climb out of the 
dresser drawer.  He crawls onto the bed next to his mother 
and buries his face in her shoulder.

EDDIE
I think something's wrong with 
Grandpa.  He took off all of his 
clothes and then he ate a lion.

LILY
You weren't at the zoo, were you?




(CONTINUED)28.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE
The forest.  Grandpa and Marilyn 
were teaching me about the Circle 
of Life and suicidal deer.

LILY
Circle of Life is a violent shape.

EDDIE 
It is when Grandpa's drawing it.  

LILY
Your Grandpa's just trying to help 
you understand there's an order to 
life so you don't... hate the baby 
bears when they attack.

EDDIE
I don't hate that baby bear.  It 
was probably hungry and confused.  

LILY
That's exactly right.  That baby 
bear was so confused it couldn't 
possibly know what it was doing.

EDDIE
It's not like it wandered into a 
populated area.  Which reminds me.  
If Grandpa's going to start eating 
people again, don't you think we 
should warn the neighbors?

Lily stares, blinks, then:

LILY
What makes you think Grandpa is 
going to start eating people?

EDDIE
What makes you think he's not?

LILY
Because he's your grandfather.
(off his look)
Marilyn told you.

EDDIE
No.  Grandpa told me when he ate a 
lion.  I think he wanted me to see 
him eat that lion so I could get 
used to him eating something big.




(CONTINUED)29.

CONTINUED: (2)

LILY
The thing Grandpa wants you to see 
about the Circle of Life is, as a 
Munster, he's standing outside of it.

It takes a moment, but Eddie wraps his head around it.

EDDIE
As a Munster? 

LILY
Well, as a Munster, our duty in 
nature is to eat.  Not be eaten. 

EDDIE
Unless you have a condition.  Like 
Marilyn.  Like me.

LILY
Unless you have a condition.  

EDDIE
You wouldn't ever eat somebody, 
would you, mom?

Lily scoffs and dismisses with near expert-avoidance.

LILY 
There's a difference between being 
a Munster and being a monster.

EDDIE
Would you?

Her long silence is an admission and young Eddie knows it.

LILY
It would be natural, if I did.

Eddie stiffens, moving almost imperceptibly away from his 
mother.  Almost.  He takes this in a sad, somber moment.  

EDDIE
I'm so glad I'm not like you.

OFF that penetrating Lily like a wooden stake...


CAMERA CONTINUES PULLING BACK REVEALING Herman is sitting 
with the entire family.  He eyes Grandpa at the head of the 
grand table, terrified what he is plotting.  Lily is flanked 
by Steve and Herman.  Marilyn and Eddie flank Grandpa.  




(CONTINUED)37.

CONTINUED:

HERMAN
(winces at his heart)
This is so exciting.  An unexpected 
guest.  What could happen next.

The rhetorical question is clearly directed at Grandpa across 
a table littered with MEAT DISHES.  Pork, duck, chicken, 
venison, rabbit -- all beautifully prepared -- to Eddie's 
chagrin.  Herman notices Steve cannot take his eyes off Lily.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
I didn't mean to be a surprise.

GRANDPA
I meant for you to be a surprise.

LILY
Grandpa's surprises make me nervous.

Scout Master Steve puts a comforting hand on her shoulder.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
It's okay if you're nervous.  
Mealtime anxiety is common, 
especially during times of loss.  

GRANDPA
Upsetting to think someone at the 
table could be having their last meal.

Scout Master Steve nods while the others stare at Grandpa, 
who is clearly up to something nefarious.  Lily notices:

LILY
(to Herman)
Is your heart making that noise?

Herman swerves around the question and asks the Scout Master:

HERMAN
Did Grandpa happen to say what his 
intentions were for you tonight?

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
Just opening my heart to new 
possibilities.
(then, to Lily)
Let me serve you.

Scout Master Steve stares, charmed, at Lily as he cuts meat 
off the pig's rump roast and places it on her plate.  




(CONTINUED)38.

CONTINUED: (2)

MARILYN
Steve, are you depressed or lonely?  
Maybe feeling so-so about life?  I 
don't understand why you're here.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
Not feeling so-so, I'm feeling gung-
ho.  Feels like I'm sitting down 
sharing a meal with my own family.

GRANDPA
Part of you is.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
(to Lily)
You certainly make me feel at home.

GRANDPA
"Home is where the heart is."  
Isn't that right, Herman?

HERMAN
(quietly to himself)
Ohmygod.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
Eddie, you ever make a family tree?

EDDIE
Our family tree would just be a 
stump.  Only goes back to Grandpa 
and he's been alive forever.

Lily saws off bite-size pieces of meat, raises them to her 
mouth and allows SPIDERS to snatch them into the rafters when 
Scout Master Steve isn't looking.  Then she fake chews.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
We could make a family stump then.  
Or shrubbery.  It's a real nice way 
to earn a Genealogy merit badge and 
remember everyone who's ever been a 
branch on that stump or shrubbery, 
even though they may be gone.  

Herman realizes Scout Master Steve is talking about him.

HERMAN
My branch is still here.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
Your branch will always be here on 
the family stump or shrubbery.



(CONTINUED)39.

CONTINUED: (3)

Then he squeezes Lily's hand and she turns to Herman:

LILY
Can I see you in the kitchen?


Lily and Herman mid-discussion:

LILY
To be clear, I don't want you or 
Grandpa murdering your son's Scout 
Master.  Set a better example than 
that.  What would Eddie think?

HERMAN 
He would think horrible things. 

LILY
Then what are you thinking?

Herman unbuttons his shirt, pops off his sternum plate and 
shows his wife his wheezing steam-punk heart.

LILY (CONT D)
What did you do to it?

HERMAN
I broke it.

LILY
I think you love too much.

HERMAN
I know I love too much.  Now my 
heart's going to explode.  My brain 
will lose oxygen and Grandpa will 
shove the nearest replacement into 
the hole in my chest and I'll be a 
reanimated reanimated man with 
brain damage and a strange heart.

Herman can't being sentimental over his failing heart.

HERMAN (CONT D)
This is Eddie's dad's heart.  The 
heart that fell in love with you.  

LILY
The Scout Master falling in love 
with me isn't going to make his 
heart feel any more like yours.




(CONTINUED)40.

CONTINUED:

HERMAN
That is all your father's doing.  I 
don't want Scout Master Steve's 
heart.  I don't want any heart 
except the heart I already have.  

LILY
Next heart will fall in love with 
me, too, and the one after that.

HERMAN
I'm going to miss how this feels.

LILY
If you miss it, Eddie has the same 
one beating in his chest.  He is 
still your son.  You don't need a 
broken heart to tell you that.



In the absence of Lily and Herman, Scout Master Steve takes 
stock of the empty plate in front of Eddie. 

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
Easy to lose your appetite when 
you're worried about your dad, huh?

EDDIE
I don't eat meat.

It's as if he just told his Catholic Grandmother he doesn't 
believe in God.  Grandpa sits up, unwilling to let this pass.

GRANDPA
Since when?

EDDIE
Since whenever the last time I ate 
meat was, which will be the last 
time I will ever eat meat.  

The mood has gotten tense between Grandpa and a very willful 
Eddie.  Marilyn and Scout Master Steve observe the volley.

GRANDPA
I would never reach across this 
table and slap you.  But I will 
think about it hard enough that 
you'll feel like you got slapped.




(CONTINUED)41.

CONTINUED:

Grandpa removes the silver cover to Dot's platter revealing a 
big, bloody loaf of delicious Beef Wellington.  The steam 
rolling off the beef crosses to Eddie's flaring nostrils. 

GRANDPA (CONT D)
It's the temperature it would be if 
it were walking around.

MARILYN
Not appetizing to anyone but you.

A single bead of sweat creeps out of Eddie's hairline and 
streaks down his cheek as Grandpa drops a bloody slice of 
Beef Wellington on the plate in front of him.

EDDIE
I'm not eating it.

GRANDPA
You're not getting up from this 
table until you do.

Grandpa notices Eddie has pushed the Wellington around, 
arranging the meat and crust to resemble a frowning cow.

GRANDPA (CONT D)
Stop playing with your food.

EDDIE
(re: Scout Master Steve)
I will if you will.

GRANDPA
That's a gross cliche.  You're 
better than that.

Eddie glances at Scout Master Steve and simply says:

EDDIE
Grandpa wants to eat you.

MARILYN
Right now?  

The confused Scout Master doesn't know how to take any of it.

GRANDPA
(shrugs)
Kids.
CUT TO BLACK.


END OF ACT FOUR42.


ACT FIVE


Bboth Eddie and Grandpa stare stubbornly into middle-
distance, refusing to look at each other.  Scout Master Steve 
politely listens to Marilyn as she tries to assert herself:

MARILYN
I'm going to campaign against 
eating in or around the house 
certain food groups.  I have a few 
arguments I've been preparing.

Dot and the Parade of Neighbors ENTER and begin bussing the 
table and freshening napkins, unaware of the tension.

DOT
Let us just get some of these 
plates out of the way.

Dot clears the table of the large meat dishes, handing the 
awkward Parade of Neighbors each a platter of food.

MARILYN
I know --

GRANDPA
Don t say you know cause you don t.  

MARILYN
I know some things.

GRANDPA
 going to be the same person You re
 tomorrow you are today and that s
 never going to change.  Nothing s
ever going to be different for you.  

MARILYN
 you have to say it like that?Why d

GRANDPA
To clarify how much you don't know 
so you wouldn't interrupt me again.

Dot knows when it is time for her to leave.

DOT
We can come back later.

Dot quickly ushers the Parade of Neighbors out the door as 
Lily and Herman ENTER from the Kitchen.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
Eddie, you don't really think your 
Grandpa is going to eat me, do you?

EDDIE
Yes.

GRANDPA
These fantasies occur to a child 
living in a hobo murder house.

EDDIE
Please don't let Grandpa eat Steve.

LILY
Nobody is eating Steve.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
(touched)
Awww.  Thank you.

HERMAN
Steve, this has been a lovely 
evening, but I'm afraid we have 
some family matters to attend to.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
I completely understand.  Have to 
get to those things while you can.

Eddie pushes himself away from the table and stomps off.

LILY
Eddie...

He doesn't stop.

HERMAN
Marilyn, would you show Steve the 
way out.  To safety.  Steve, we'll 
see you at the next Troop meeting.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
If you're still with us, I would 
love to see you there.
(then)
Lily. 

Before Lily can protest Scout Master Steve gives her a warm 
embrace usually reserved for the closest friends and lovers.

LILY
Good night, Steve.  And good luck.

THE FOYER

Marilyn helps Scout Master Steve on with his coat.

MARILYN
So nice to meet you.

Marilyn smiles politely as she opens the door for Scout 
Master Steve, whispering briefly as she shoves him out:

MARILYN (CONT D)
Run.


Scout Master Steve falls down a jagged, craggy chute lined 
with thin wood slats calked together decades ago.

He lands with a BOUNCE on a mattress suspended over an open 
POOL OF ACID.  It dips briefly into the pool before it tosses 
Scout Master Steve back into the air even as the ACID EATS AN 
EXPANDING HOLE through the center of the mattress.

Scout Master Steve sails over a PIT OF QUICKLIME and lands 
with a WOMPF and a dust cloud on Grandpa's OPERATING TABLE.

We are --


Grandpa waves away the dissipating cloud of dust as Scout 
Master Steve tries to get his bearings, still on the slab.

GRANDPA
I'm so grateful you missed the pit 
of quicklime and the pool of acid.  
That would have been a disaster.

SMASH CUT TO:45.



Herman, affixed to Grandpa's slab, slowly comes to. 

HERMAN
I was dreaming there was this 
horrible car accident.  It felt 
like I was on a shopping spree.

His eyes drift to Scout Master Steve's neatly folded clothes, 
resting next to his neatly folded sack of skin, resting 
beside a tidy pile of broken bones, marrow neatly sucked out.  

HERMAN (CONT D)
Oh, Grandpa.  How could you.

Grandpa turns around REVEALING Scout Master Steve's fresh 
blood transformed him into a handsome, dapper, younger man.  
He finishes politely sucking the marrow from a bone, then:

YOUTHFUL GRANDPA
You're good as new.
CUT TO BLACK.
