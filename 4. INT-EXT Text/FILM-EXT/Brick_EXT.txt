A gaping hole in the concrete side of a freeway. On the
embankment beside the hole BRENDAN FRYE squats, shoulders
hunched. His dark eyes behind thin glasses watch the
shallow stream of water which flows into the tunnel.
THE WATER
not more than six inches deep. Just beneath the surface a
young woman's pale blue arm in gaudy bracelets bats against
the edge of her body like a docked boat. A pebble plinks
into the water beside it.1
TITLE CARD OVER BLACK:
"2 DAYS PREVIOUS"
He sits on the curb of a wide suburban street, eats lunch
from a brown bag and watches a phone booth on the corner. He
shows no surprise when it begins to ring. Brendan goes to
the phone and puts the receiver to his ear. Silence for a
moment, then a thin female voice from the phone.
1
Originally Dode was later revealed to have been hiding above the tunnel.
2
The street names were changed in production to match existing streets (we couldn't
afford to create custom street signs.)

VOICE
(over phone)
Brendan?
BRENDAN
Emily?
EMILY
(weakly)
Yeah. How's things?
BRENDAN
(slow, deliberate)
Status quo.
EMILY
Yeah?
BRENDAN
Uh huh.
EMILY
That's good.
Her voice thins to a high, strained breath. She is crying.
BRENDAN
What's going on, Em?
EMILY
(through strained crying)
It's good to see you, Brendan.
Brendan's eyes glance around the surrounding street. Emily
is crying again.
EMILY (CONT'D) (cont'd)
It's been some time.
BRENDAN
Two months.
EMILY
Yeah. I didn't even know your locker. I
had to ask Brain.
More crying noises.
BRENDAN
Em, why don't we meet somewhere?
EMILY
I can't.
3
BRENDAN
Why not?
EMILY
I screwed up real bad. I really screwed
up.
BRENDAN
Screwed up how?
EMILY
(blubbering, fast and
incoherent)
I did what she said with the brick, I
didn't know it was bad, but the pin's on
it now for poor Frisco and they're
playing it all on me-
BRENDAN
Slow down now, what?
EMILY
You gotta help me Brendan I think tug-
Oh!
With a sharp breath the line clicks dead just as a black
mustang roars by. Brendan drops the receiver and spins out
of the booth.
There, another pay phone up the hill -- empty.
Brendan turns to the black mustang, far down the street. A
man's hand drops a cigarette butt from the driver side
window.1
The mustang turns the corner, gone.
Brendan walks after it, finds the cigarette butt on the
street. Still smoking.
A pale blue arrow is printed on the filter.
In the distance the class bell rings.
The high school is open air - the hallways are alleyways
between buildings. A short kid with eyeglasses the size of
1
Because of the orientation of the street, this was all flipped when we shot it, and the
hand came from the passenger window. The dialogue in the ending field scene was
changed to match, causing mass confusion for about half an hour on set.

Volkswagen headlights sits against the wall. Brendan enters,
leans on the wall beside him.
BRENDAN
Brain.
THE BRAIN
Hey Brendan. It's been awhile. Where you
been eating?
BRENDAN
Back of school.
THE BRAIN
Huh. Yeah, no one's seen you. What's it
been, a couple months?
BRENDAN
Yeah, it's been awhile. You gave Emily
my locker number?
THE BRAIN
A few days ago. Was I wrong?
BRENDAN
What?
THE BRAIN
To give it?
BRENDAN
No.
THE BRAIN
It's been so long, I don't know you
two's stats.
BRENDAN
It has been awhile.
Who's she been
eating with?
THE BRAIN
(uncomfortable)
I dunno. It's hard to keep track.
BRENDAN
Is it?
THE BRAIN
(shrugs)
Can be.
The Brain avoids Brendan's gaze.
5
BRENDAN
Uh huh.
A beat.
THE BRAIN
She hasn't been doing too good.
BRENDAN
Yeah well. I'm not looking for a patch
up. Em's life is her own. But she
asked for my help.
THE BRAIN
Help with what?
BRENDAN
I don't know. I don't even care, it's
not my business. I just want to know
she's ok, so I've got to find her.
That's all this is.
THE BRAIN
Well. I know she was poking in with the
Ivy-bound cheerleading elite. Laura
Dannon's crowd.
Across the parking lot a beautiful girl with dark long hair
kisses an football player.
BRENDAN
Laura Dannon there with the Rabbit?
THE BRAIN
Yeah. Brad Bramish with her. Cream on
the upper crust.
Brad laughs heartily.
BRENDAN
(softly)
He's a sap.
THE BRAIN
Know him?
BRENDAN
By sight.
THE BRAIN
I won't argue then. Anyway Em tagged
after them for a bit, but it didn't
work. So she picked her way down the
food chain. Last I seen she was with
whasshername, that drama vamp. Small
time dealer, augh, the evil one, the one
you dated-
BRENDAN
Kara.
THE BRAIN
That's my bus.
BRENDAN
You know her locker number?
THE BRAIN
Kara's?
BRENDAN
Em's.
THE BRAIN
239.
BRENDAN
Thanks Brain. Keep your specs on, find
me if she shows.
THE BRAIN
Sure.
The Brain trots off. In the distance Brad and Laura laugh,
and he kisses her. Her hair blows in the wind.
Empty. Locker 239 is open, its door swinging gently in the
wind.
Brendan sits against the massive building, flipping through
loose papers. He finds two photographs, one of Emily hugging
him, the other of Emily with a beautiful sharp-eyed girl at
a party, drinks in hand.
Sorting more papers, he finds a red card with a sequined
mask on the front. The bottom edge has been torn off.
Sixth period has broke. Masses of students pile into busses.
7
A huge chunk of brown building. Brendan strides towards it.
An imposing private community gate. Brendan coasts up on his
bike and ditches it in the bushes. He checks the call box
directory: "42 -- DANNON"
Using the call box as a hand hold he hops the gate and walks
briskly up the street.
Shiny cars line the curb. Party noises come from an upscale
two story house. Brendan takes a short breath, then strides
up to the front door.
Brendan joins Laura, hands her a drink. Suburban lights fill
the valley below. Laura sips her drink.
LAURA
I'll never get through all this.
BRENDAN
Uh huh.
She sips more.
LAURA
I knew your old partner Jerr since grade
school. Tough break. How long were you
two joined up before your operation got
the sting?
16
BRENDAN
A few months. Could have helped himself
out by turning me in, but he took the
heat. He was a good guy. Solid.
LAURA
Was he?
BRENDAN
You knew him.
LAURA
Yeah I did. So why are you here tonight?
BRENDAN
I'm looking for Emily.
LAURA
She wasn't invited.
BRENDAN
She had an invitation.
LAURA
Well like you said, I've got to work on
that. Em's been AWOL for a good month,
nobody's seen her.
BRENDAN
I saw her yesterday.
LAURA
Nearly nobody's seen her. So what did
she tell you?
BRENDAN
(winces)
Score 0 for finesse.
LAURA
Listen, you're scratching at the wrong
door. I wasn't with Emily enough to know
details of what she was in, I just got
wind of the downfall, and I didn't get
any details of that, except that it was
bad. So now that we're showing some
cards...
BRENDAN
If you haven't got a finger in Em's
troubles, why'd her name get me into
your rather exclusive party?
17
LAURA
Keep up with me now. I don't know, but
it sounded like you did, and a body's
got a right to be curious. Now I'm not
so sure.
BRENDAN
Well I'll put that body to bed. I don't
know a damn thing about whatever
troubles, and that works for me. I just
want to find her.
A long beat. Laura studies Brendan's face, then seems to
come to a decision.
LAURA
Coffee and pie.
The words hang in the air a moment. A look of recognition
from Brendan.
BRENDAN
Coffee and pie oh my?
LAURA
And you didn't hear it from me.
He sips his drink. A voice calls from the glass door.
Another girl. Laura flashes Brendan a look and goes to her.
They have quick, quiet words and the girl leaves. Laura
turns back to Brendan.
LAURA (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Will you wait here for me?
BRENDAN
Sure.
LAURA
You'll stay right here and wait -- I'll
be five minutes.
BRENDAN
Yes.
The moment she leaves Brendan runs across the lawn and hops
the fence, into the neighbor's yard.
Brendan runs to the edge of the neighboring house and peeks
around. Laura comes out the front door, cuts across the
lawn and sidewalk and trots out into the street. Brendan
18
begins to follow, but a noise from behind the fence stops
him - a match being struck.
Brendan creeps towards the fence and peers through a
splintered hole.
BRENDAN'S POV - THROUGH THE FENCE
A brightly lit window in the side of Brad's house, and
through the window the party.
A dark figure wearing a long coat and broad rimmed hat, all
inky black. The figure smokes a cigarette and watches the
party, absently stroking his cheek.
Brendan steps back - SNAP!
A twig.
The figure freezes. Then, making no noise at all, it spins
to face Brendan, a towering black form against the window.
The glowing cigarette falls to the grass.
A metallic glint, and a clicking sound not unlike a gun.
Brendan throws himself backwards onto the grass. A beat.
Through the hole the black of the figure's cloak whips away.
Brendan hesitates, then hops the fence.
Brendan lands on his feet. No black figure to be found.
The cigarette still smolders on the ground. Hand rolled,
plain paper.
Brendan gazes through the window, catching his breath. Then
he breaks the trance and creeps towards the street.
Peeking around the house, Brendan sees Laura cut across the
lawn and trot into the street. Using parked cars as cover,
Brendan follows.
Between cars, Brendan sees a lanky kid in baggy jeans and
engineer boots with a clean shaven head leaning against a
black Mustang. Laura goes to him and speaks quickly.
19
The dark figure in the hat emerges from the shadows. Laura
says something to him. Grunting something angrily, he gets
in the car with the bald kid and peels off.
Laura turns and slowly walks towards the house.
When she is gone Brendan stands, throws a look back at the
house and walks off down the street, towards the guard gate.
The two drinks, where Brendan left them. Laura takes hers
and drains it. The suburban lights twinkle like stars.
The sun rises over Carrows family restaurant, a squat
structure backed against the weedy edge of the runoff tunnel
ravine.
A banner from 1973 in the window - "Coffee and Pie oh my!"
A pack of six pale stoners slump against the rear dumpster.
Their beady eyes follow Brendan in sync as he approaches.
He goes to the nearest one.
BRENDAN
Where's Dode?
STONER 1
Dunno, bra.
Silence and blank stares. Brendan calmly moves to the next
stoner.
BRENDAN
Dode?
STONER 2
Uh uh.
Brendan moves to the next one.
A thin head pokes from around the dumpster.
DODE
Hey Brendan. Maybe you shouldn't be
here.
Brendan steps around the dumpster. Dode slumps against the
wall, thin and delicate in dusty black. Slivery eyes, pale
lips, muffled intelligence.
20
BRENDAN
Kara told me you know where Em's at.
DODE
Uh huh.
And why are you looking for Em?
BRENDAN
She asked for my help.
DODE
Uh huh. Listen man, I've got plenty on
my plate without dealing with some
jilted ex.
BRENDAN
It's not about that.
DODE
Whatever it's about, act smarter than
you look and drop it.
BRENDAN
Where is she?
DODE
She's with me, and right now that's the
best place for her. Leave the low life
to the low lifers and dangle.
BRENDAN
You're on the bright side of dim, Dode,
but if I thought you had this half-
handled I'd be eating lunch. Where's
she at?
DODE
Better get while it's good.
Brendan doesn't.
DODE (cont'd)
Heel it now, dig?
The 5 big stoners appear behind Brendan, threatening.
Dode
turns his head away to light a joint.
Brendan's fist slams into his face, sending the joint
spinning. Brendan slams Dode's frail frame against the
dumpster.
The 5 stoners stand in the exact same position, deer in the
headlights. One makes a half hearted motion to intervene.
21
BIG STONER
Back off.
BRENDAN
Throw one at me if you want, hash head.
I've got all five senses and I slept
last night, that puts me six up on the
lot of you.
BIG STONER
Just easy-
Brendan slams Dode into the wall.
BRENDAN
(to Dode)
Where's Em?
DODE
(deliberate)
She's with me. She was tight when she
called you, man. Came to and freaked.
She told me to shake you if you came by.
Said you'd only make things worse.
Brendan covers how shaken he is by this statement fairly
well. He drops Dode.
STONER 1 (O.S.)
Put him down, man!
DODE
Deal with whatever this ain't about and
drop it.
BIG STONER
(to Brendan)
Nothing more here, bra.
BRENDAN
Tell Emily I want to see her. Tell her
if she still wants my help or not that's
her business, but I want to hear it
straight from her.
DODE
She don't -
Brendan walks away.
BRENDAN
Today. She knows where I eat lunch.
22
When Brendan is a safe distance away the biggest stoner
shouts with conviction
BIG STONER
And stay out, punk!
Brendan hides behind a tall clump of bushes.
A moment later Dode hustles away from Carrows. Brendan
follows.
The sun is rising as Brendan tails Dode through the twisty
suburban streets.
Brendan takes cover as Dode stops by a white hatchback.
A girl gets out of the car and embraces Dode. Her wrist is
adorned with the same cheap plastic bracelets as the dead
girl's arm. Dode speaks quickly to her, she nods and speaks
back. He hands her a slip of paper, which she tucks into a
brightly colored address book and slips in her jacket
pocket. They embrace again, Dode walks off and the girl gets
in her car.
Brendan stumbles after the car, but it is quickly gone. He
watches it go, then follows Dode back towards school.
Dode slumps into the front door of the brown building.
Brendan watches him from a distance, eyes thoughtful. After
a beat he turns and walks off into the thickening crowds of
students.
FADE OUT:
FADE UP
Brendan eats lunch alone on a concrete wall beside a long,
empty utility road behind the school.
LATER
Reclining on the wall, reading "Lord of the Flies". He
raises his eyes, and sits up suddenly.
23
Off in the distance on the utility road a tiny figure
approaches, stumbling. Brendan jumps and hits the ground
running towards the figure.
Meet the girl with cheap bracelets, the girl Dode spoke to,
the dead girl, Emily. He catches her just as she stumbles
and falls and carries her into the shade of a covered
hallway.
Emily and Brendan sit in silence. She is very pretty, but
she looks bad. Too much makeup, not enough sleep. She
sniffles, speaks to her shoes.
EMILY
I must have sounded pretty crazy on the
phone. Yesterday.
She taps her shoes together lightly, eyes fixed on them.
EMILY (cont'd)
It was dumb, I got paranoid over a
really stupid thing. I was high, I went
crazy for a little bit, but now you have
to forget about it. Please. That's how
you can help me now, forget about it.
She turns her weak eyes to Brendan for the first time.
His
stare is unwavering, searching. She pushes on.
EMILY (cont'd)
Brendan, I know you're mad at all these
people, cause you think I went away from
you and went to them. But you've got to
start seeing it as my decision, stop
being angry because where I want to be
at's different from where you wanna be
at.
BRENDAN
(angry)
Who fed you that line, Em?
She looks back at her shoes.
EMILY
And stop picking on Dode. He's a good
guy.
BRENDAN
The Carrows rat?
24
EMILY
He's a good friend.
BRENDAN
So what am I?
EMILY
(strained anger)
Yeah, what are you? Eating back here,
not liking anybody, how are you judging
anyone? I loved you alot but I couldn't
stand it, I had to get with people. I
couldn't heckle life with you, I had to
see what was what.
A beat. She taps her clogs. One has a hole worn through the
sole. Her face contorts, seizes up, and she is sobbing.
EMILY (cont'd)
I'm sorry Brendan.
She buries her face in his shoulder. He has a hard time
speaking.
BRENDAN
You've got to come back to me, Em.
EMILY
No. No. Never. I'm sorry. Never. I can't
love on your terms, Brendan. I can't do
that, I'm not like you.
BRENDAN
You're in a spot, I can get you out of
it. Come back to me, and whatever heat
follows you I'll deal with.
EMILY
No. You're not hearing me, no. I don't
want to be put away and protected. No.
EMILY (cont'd)
No.
BRENDAN
Tell me about the trouble, the brick and
the pin -
EMILY
You gonna fix things like you did with
Jerr? No. I came to say goodbye, for
good. Whatever you have to do to let me
go, do it. I'm gonna let you go, I've
25
decided that. Make sure that, you've got
to, promise you won't torture yourself,
that you'll let me go.
She embraces him, enveloping him in her jacket. His face is
a frozen mask.
EMILY (cont'd)
Let me go.
As she pulls away he mechanically slips an address book from
her jacket pocket.
He watches her as she walks away.
The Brain studies the paper. Busses pull into the parking
lot behind them. Brendan is distant, lost in thought.
THE BRAIN
Hm. Do you know anything else about
this?
1
Our one and only scene in a classroom was moved to Brendan's lunch spot to save us
a location change. The degree to which the lack of classroom time in the film has been
commented on has always bemused the author, who cannot for the life of him
remember a single interesting thing that happened in a classroom in high school.
26
BRENDAN
(shakes his head)
Mm.
THE BRAIN
Slim pickings. Why'd you let Dode fly
when he came back to whose-her-name, at
the theater?
BRENDAN
(shrugs dismissively)
Kara. It's their turf, I couldn't hear
them without being seen, and that would
only biff their play. Best to know it's
there, let it ride and see what comes of
it.
(touches the paper)
But anyway.
THE BRAIN
Hm. Well, if this is what I think it is,
it didn't come straight from Dode, less
he's playing out of his league.
(beat)
I can only give you my best guess.
BRENDAN
Yeah.
THE BRAIN
When the upper crust does shady deeds
they do them in different spots around
town. I know under the pier's one, down
by the bike trails in the state park's
another. There's alot of them. The pitch
is they've got little symbols for each
one, and that's how they tell each other
the place, so word won't get around. So
this might be that.
BRENDAN
But Dode wouldn't know it?
THE BRAIN
This is upper crust. Dode's pie pan
grease.
Brendan studies the symbol.
BRENDAN
Call anything up?
27
THE BRAIN
How many places start with 'A'? Or if
it's a shape, or just a random symbol.
Anyway, even if you figured it out, what
good could you do? She's smart, she
knows the play, she's gunning to square
things.
BRENDAN
Yeah.
THE BRAIN
You said her business was none of yours,
so she's alright, forget it now. Go
home, sleep.
Brendan walks off into the hazy pre-dawn light.
Brendan stops at a high wall of weeds, listening to the low
gurgle of moving water. Slowly, robotically he pushes
through.
EMILY'S BODY
Face down, bobbing gently in shallow water. Bluish white.
Red foam clings to her.
Silently, as if lowered by a string Brendan sinks down,
squatting in the mud. His lungs empty in one choppy breath.
He pulls his glasses off sluggishly.
EMILY'S ARM
Lifeless, pale.
BRENDAN'S FACE
A contorted, frozen mask, eyes wet.
EMILY'S HAIR
Stringy, flowing gently in the water.
BRENDAN'S EYES
Dazed, drifting... then suddenly snapping to attention.
A noise. From the tunnel.
Brendan freezes. The inky blackness of the tunnel mouth
opens like a vacuum... silent, but then -
The scrape of a shoe against concrete, then echoing
footsteps running away.
Brendan springs like a cat, sprinting into the tunnel.
29
Emily's body is still there. Brendan crawls out of the
tunnel and collapses in the shallow water, beside the body.
He rests his head on his arm, eyes on Em's hair.
Cold and barren, nearly empty. Brendan limps across the
barren lawns.
A line of phone booths on campus. Brendan nearly collapses
against one. He dials, still in a stupor.
VOICE ON PHONE
Saint Clement police.
Brendan stares into space, eyes burning
VOICE ON PHONE (cont'd)
Saint Clement police, hello? Hello?
Brendan hangs up.
Early morning mist below a squat brick building.
30
A vast field of asphalt segmented by a dozen basketball
courts outlined in cracked paint.1 Brendan trudges across
it, his steps heavy. He stops and stands very still, staring
at the ground for a beat then raising his eyes to
THE HORIZON
Flat, gray, pin straight. Brendan's voice starts speaking
rapidly, confident and clear.
1
This describes the location at my school that the "showdown" scenes were originally
written for. Between when I wrote the script and when we shot it, however, the school
expanded and built portable classrooms on the basketball field, and so we reluctantly
moved these scenes to the football field.
33
BRENDAN (O.S.)
Yeah it was personal. Jerr spooked some
decent gees and ran around some what was
straight with him, but I'm nobody's bull
runner. This wasn't a business sit. But
yeah. I bulled him. Got in tight,
partnered up and sent him over.
PAN AROUND to reveal BRENDAN. He looks different, edgier,
more alive, wearing different clothes and a thin goatee1. He
keeps talking directly at us.
BRENDAN (cont'd)
I'd bull the lot of them, Em, I'd burn
down the whole party if they tried to
play you again. Jerr and whoever's next.
I want to keep you safe.
An ARM swings into frame, wearing cheap plastic bracelets
and pale blue fingernail polish. It slaps Brendan hard in
the face. He catches it. Emily wrenches her arm away and
stumbles backwards onto the pavement.
Brendan grabs her sleeve. She twists away. He grabs her
shoulder, grabs her waist, she resists, and suddenly they
are struggling with violent pent up intensity until with a
shout she breaks away and falls to the ground.
A beat.
Gulls cry in the distance.
EMILY
You can't keep me safe, Brendan. I'm in
a bigger world now, and you can't hide
me from it, and you can't beat it. Not
if I don't want you to.
Brendan's face looks lumpish, while Emily's is strong. She
stands and walks off into the distance across the barren
field.
BRENDAN'S FACE
Watching her go. It is back to present day, pale, clean
shaven, sullen. His eyes are cold with resolve.
Brendan sloshes down into the water. Without delicacy he
lifts Emily's body and pulls her back into the tunnel.
Brendan and the Brain lean against a wall. The Brain slips
him a piece of paper.
THE BRAIN
There's the cell number.
BRENDAN
Keep it on vibrate.
THE BRAIN
(pats his jacket pocket)
Yeah.
BRENDAN
Better stop meeting me in the open too.
I'm going to start getting visible, and
I need you on the underneath. I'll call.
THE BRAIN
Trueman asked for you. Wants words in
his office.
BRENDAN
I bet. Keep him off me - stonewall him,
he won't bite, just keep him away from
me.
THE BRAIN
I'll try. So what's first?
BRENDAN
Make Em's troubles mine. I'm going to
throw a few words at you, tell me if
they catch. Brick.
THE BRAIN
No.
1
A very early draft held on the tunnel after Brendan left, and revealed a dark figure
(Dode) creeping away from the top of the tunnel, causing the pebble described on page
1 to plink into the water.
35
BRENDAN
Or bad brick.
THE BRAIN
No.
BRENDAN
Tug.
THE BRAIN
Tug... that might be a drink.
BRENDAN
Drink?
THE BRAIN
Vodka and milk or something, or maybe
not.
BRENDAN
Poor Frisco.
THE BRAIN
Frisco. Frisco Farr1 was a sophomore
last year, I think. Real trash, maybe
hit a class a week. Didn't know him
then, and haven't seen him around.
BRENDAN
Pin.
THE BRAIN
Pin... the Pin?
BRENDAN
The Pin, yeah.
THE BRAIN
The Pin's kind of a local spook story.
You know the Kingpin?
BRENDAN
I've heard it.
THE BRAIN
Same thing. Supposed to be old, like 26,
lives in town.
1
All apologies to Frisco Farr, who the author did actually go to school with, and who
was neither a druggie nor `real trash', but was a great guy who simply had a very cool
sounding name. He is now (the author was horrified to learn) practicing law.
36
BRENDAN
Jake1 runner, right?
THE BRAIN
Big time... maybe. Ask any dope rat
where their junk sprang they'll say they
scraped it from that who scored it from
this who bought it off so, and after
four or five connections the list'll
always end with the Pin. But I'll becha
you got every rat in town together and
said 'show your hands' if any of them've
actually seen the Pin, you'd get a crowd
of full pockets.
BRENDAN
You think the Pin's just a tale to take
whatever heat?
THE BRAIN
(shrugs. Beat)
But what's first?
BRENDAN
A show of hands.
Kara smokes a cigarette. Brendan leans beside her.
KARA
(annoyed)
Hey Brendan. Here for the show?
BRENDAN
No.
KARA
Would you go then, honey, cause I've got
this headache.
BRENDAN
Try smoking like a chimney, I've heard
that helps.
1
In an admittedly paltry concession to clarity, this was changed to `Dope runner' in post
production.
37
Brendan grabs the pack of cigarettes.
BRENDAN (cont'd)
Isn't this Dode's brand?
Kara snaps her head towards him, a flash of anger. She
catches herself and smiles cooly.
KARA
You don't know Dode's brand.
BRENDAN
Oh I do now.
Angry again, Kara snatches the pack from him.
BRENDAN (cont'd)
I'm going to start shaking things up.
Give me the story and you might miss the
bite.
KARA
The story about what?
BRENDAN
Alright.
He turns and walks away.
KARA
The story about what?
BRENDAN
I don't want to play games if you've got
a headache. Get me if you want to spill
it, but I can't guarantee safe passage
after tonight.
KARA
I don't know what-
At the stage door, not slowing.
BRENDAN
Tell the Pin that Brad was my calling
card, and I need words.
KARA
Brad Bramish?
Through the door and into the theater.
38
The Brain walks out of a classroom and Brendan swings behind
him.
BRENDAN
(fast and low)
Tail Kara through lunch. She's got
rehearsal but she'll blow early. She
goes home, drop her, else wait for my
call.
The Brain turns and Brendan's gone.
Brendan wanders through the thick lunchtime crowd towards a
cluster of 3 or 4 flashy luxury cars set aside at the far
end of the lot.
Brad Bramish sits slouched in the front seat of his
convertible, front door open. A small crowd hangs about
Brad, his crony Biff at his elbow.
BRAD
That's all I'm saying, is put me in the
game and I'll do what needs to be done,
but they don't put me in, what needs
doing don't get done and don't come
crying to me, man. Get off my grill man,
you didn't put me in, don't come to me
if you didn't let me play.
BIFF
They didn't!
Brendan scans the rest of the cars. His eyes catch on Laura
Dannon sitting in another convertible, off to the side. Her
bright eyes cut through the crowd, straight into Brendan.
He wags his eyebrows at her. She looks away. Brendan walks
into Brad's direct line of view and obviously leans against
one of the cars.
BRAD
Hey! What are you doing here?
39
BRENDAN
Listening.
BRAD
Uh huh.
BRENDAN
Alright, you got me. I'm a scout for the
Gophers.
BRAD
(not amused)
Oh yeah?
BRENDAN
Of all things, yeah. Been watching your
game for a month, but that story just
now clenched it. You've got heart, kid.
How soon can you move to Minneapolis?
A few snickers around the crowd, but nowhere near Brad.
BRAD
(flat with anger)
Yeah?
BRENDAN
Cold winters, but they've got a great
public transit system.
BRAD
Yeah?
BRENDAN
Yeah.
BRAD
Oh yeah?
BRENDAN
There's a thesaurus in the library.
'Yeah's under 'Y'. Go ahead, I'll wait.
BRAD
Who invited you?
BRENDAN
To the parking lot? Well gee I kind of
invited myself.
BRAD
I think you'd better leave then.
40
BRENDAN
No, I'm having too good a time.
BRAD
Just the same.
Brendan smiles slightly, and very deliberately crosses his
legs. Brad's face tenses.
BRAD (cont'd)
Maybe you want to go someplace more
private.
BRENDAN
With you?
Brad says 'who else?' by lifting his arms.
BRENDAN (cont'd)
(as if he's been asked to the
movies)
Sure.
Brendan stands and walks off. Brad follows and the rest of
the crowd trails after him.
He leads them behind a parked VW van and turns to face Brad.
People gather around in a wide circle.
Brendan pulls his jacket off as Brad hangs back, mumbling.
BRAD
You know what's good for you you'll just
beat it. Beating a small frye won't win
me anything and it's not going to do you
any good-
Laura pulls up in her convertible, behind Brad, watching.
In the next moment Brendan cuts Brad off by putting his fist
in his face.
Brad grunts but doesn't lose ground. Brendan throws his
short stocky frame into Brad's larger one and tenderizes his
midsection with jabs.
Brad tags Brendan in the ribs, then smacks the palm of his
hand into Brendan's face, shoving him back onto the
pavement.
He comes at Brendan with his big fists clenched.
Brendan kicks Brad full force in the shins.
41
Brad tumbles, and Brendan comes up fast, connecting hard
with the point of Brad's chin. Brad gets his balance fast,
and before Brendan can throw another he throws one himself,
then another, both into Brendan's stomach. Brendan pulls
back and kicks Brad's shin where he had kicked it before.
Brad roars and hits Brendan very hard in the face.
Brendan bounces back like a rubber ball and throws his
weight into a square punch right into Brad's nose.
The sound of eggs breaking, and Brad falls backwards like a
board.
He stays down, holding his face.
Brendan staggers back, breathing hard, and looks up at the
small crowd. Some stare at Brendan, some at Brad, but nobody
seems about to do anything. Brendan runs his sleeve over his
face and walks unsteadily off, pushing past the last few
people rushing over.
STRAGGLER
Hey, is there a fight?
BRENDAN
Yeah.
He throws a last look at Laura, who meets his gaze and
drives off.
Brendan walks away from the lot, towards the school. Laura
pulls up beside him in her car.
LAURA
Hey.
Brendan ignores her and b-lines for the school. Laura brakes
hard, parking by the curb.
Brendan limps down the hallway.
Laura appears behind him,
trotting to catch up.
LAURA
You're quite a pill.
BRENDAN
Uh huh.
42
LAURA
Where are you going?
BRENDAN
Home.
LAURA
Why did you take a powder the other
night?
BRENDAN
Same reason I'm taking one now.
LAURA
Hold it.
(he keeps walking)
I don't get you. That's a chilly heel to
be giving a girl who's where you want to
know about.
BRENDAN
I'll get where I'm going just fine.
LAURA
I want to help you.
BRENDAN
Go away.
Silence behind him. He stops, turns wearily. She looks
genuinely hurt.
BRENDAN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Look, I can't trust you. You ought to be
smart enough to know that. I didn't
shake the party up to get your
attention, and I'm not heeling you to
hook you. Your connections could help
me, but the bad baggage they bring could
make it zero sum game or even hurt me,
so I'm better off coming at it clean.
LAURA
I wouldn't have to lead you in by the
hand-
BRENDAN
I can't trust you. Brad was a sap, you
weren't, you were with him and so you
were playing him, so you're a player.
With you behind me I'd have to tie one
eye up watching both your hands, and I
can't spare it.
43
LAURA
You're not Brad.
BRENDAN
No, I'm not.
He turns and walks away. She doesn't follow.
Brendan slumps against it, receiver to his ear, licking a
bruised lip. He wears dark glasses.
THE BRAIN
(on the phone)
You didn't call.
BRENDAN
Sorry. Kara went home though, didn't
she?
THE BRAIN
Yeah, but she stopped at a payphone and
made two calls that she didn't want on
her phone bill.
BRENDAN
Get the numbers?
THE BRAIN
No. Sorry.
BRENDAN
S'alright. Are me and Brad front page
news?
THE BRAIN
All the buzz. You really do that?
BRENDAN
Yeah.
THE BRAIN
Why? Is Brad the Pin?
BRENDAN
Brad's a sap. I downed him on his field
and his crew didn't bite. So now I know
he's a sap and anyone who acts like he
isn't is profiting by it. That's not why
I roughed him, though.
44
BRAIN
For kicks?
BRENDAN
Economics. Brad's the school's biggest
jake buyer, so if this Pin is behind all
the selling, I just got his attention.
Anyway, now's just shaking things out.
Look, you know a kid around the burgh,
lanky, short, shaved head, turns a black
tang?
THE BRAIN
I told you before I don't know the car.
Those types are a nickel a pound, but
nobody I know that you don't. And
Trueman again-
BRENDAN
Keep him off. And keep your specs on - I
need to find that kid.
THE BRAIN
Okay.
Brendan hangs up and turns sluggishly.
A lanky kid with a short shaved head and engineer boots
punches him in the face.
Brendan hits the pavement. The lanky kid is over him in a
split second, beating his face and body with short, heavy
blows.
Flashes of the lanky kid - a shiny scar shaped like a thin
triangle runs down the side of his face.
After a brief silent thrashing the kid walks off with
several other blurry figures. A car peels out and roars off
O.S.
Brendan lies still. The class bell rings, very distant. Legs
criss cross before his eyes, each blurring the world a bit
more until it is completely smeared.
FADE OUT.
FADE IN:
Gary Trueman throws Brendan out.
TRUEMAN
Get the hell off my campus, punk!
Brendan glances around, and limps off.
No stoners, no Dode. Brendan breathes uneasily.
Brendan leans against it.
THE BRAIN
No, Dode's MIA all around.
48
BRENDAN
I'm 9 of 10 that Kara's got him, but who
knows where. I shook but she's not
spilling.
THE BRAIN
No more job offers? So she's got a play.
BRENDAN
And I know enough about Kara to let that
worry me. Alright, keep your specs on
for him. Any other news?
THE BRAIN
Some. Laura Dannon came to me looking
for you.
BRENDAN
(considers this)
She did, huh?
THE BRAIN
Fourth period, nearly shook me upside
down. Can't say I didn't enjoy it, but
why'd she come to me?
BRENDAN
She's tapping Kara, and Kara knows you
know me.
THE BRAIN
Yeah, well. She's some piece of work. If
I had known where you were I might have
told her.
BRENDAN
That's the spirit. Ask around for Dode,
tail Kara again at lunch. I got knives
in my eyes, I'm going home sick. I'll
call you tonight.
Bordering a supermarket. Brendan trudges along. Suddenly he
stops. Parked in the supermarket parking lot is a black
mustang.
The sun hangs low. Brendan approaches the car and walks
around it slowly. He peers inside. A tuft of paper pokes out
from under the seat. He pulls the door handle, locked.
49
Brendan picks up a broken chunk of concrete from the ground,
waddles over to the car and holds the chunk above his head,
ready to drop it through the window.
He stops. His eyes catch something in the distance.
The lanky shaved-head kid, whose name is Tugger.
Coming
towards him fast.
Brendan stands there for a moment, then lets the chunk fall
to the ground. He casually leans against the car, removes
his glasses, puts them in a hard case and puts the hard case
in his pocket.
Tugger hits him like a train and throws him across the
pavement. Tug turns back to the car and takes out his keys.
Brendan gets up and comes towards Tug, his face stiff. Tug
turns and pops him once squarely in the mouth. Brendan falls
to his knees.
While Tug unlocks the door Brendan stands up woozily.
Grunting, Tug spins and grabs Brendan's jacket, pushing him
back while he slaps him hard in the face, back and forth,
three times. When Tug lets go Brendan drops like a stone,
catching himself on his hands and knees. The car door slams.
The mustang drives about a hundred yards out into the
parking lot, spins around and stops, facing Brendan. Its
motor purrs deeply. Brendan begins to limp towards it
doggedly, head up, eyes fixed.
A crackling roar and short squeal of tires spit the mustang
forward. It comes straight at Brendan, rumbling like a tank.
Brendan stops walking and stands very still, eyes steady.
The gap between him and the car closes in no time at all.
It speeds past him not six inches to his left, brushing the
edge of his jacket. Brakes squeal behind him. Brendan turns
and lopes towards the mustang, idling about fifty feet away.
He stops at the window.
Tugger eyes him curiously, with
some respect.
BRENDAN
I want to see the Pin.
TUGGER
(nods slightly)
Yeah, I guess you do.
50
Twisty and narrow. The black mustang flies through them at
impossible speeds, roaring past like a bullet.
DARKNESS
Loud engine noise, jostling, grunting. Then a metallic
jangle, some scraping, and a CLINK!
The trunk pops open, revealing Brendan holding a jack rod.
A small one story house, slightly run down. Tugger opens the
trunk and drags Brendan out, covering his eyes with a palm,
slams the trunk and goes inside.
When they are gone the broken trunk drifts open.
Laura's convertible stops, and Brendan climbs out painfully.
He studies her face for a moment.
LAURA
You trust me now?
BRENDAN
Less than when I didn't trust you
before. If you can tell me your angle in
this, maybe I can.
LAURA
Come here.1
Brendan leans on the car, his face close to hers.
LAURA (CONT'D) (cont'd)
I'm on the in, top level of the tower
and I know everyone, but I don't know
all what goes on. I knew Em when she
tried to get with me and Brad, and I
liked her. She was smart. But she wasn't
us, and it didn't work. When she left
she took some souvenirs, dirty habits
she wasn't strong enough to control and
a connection to the Pin to keep them
going. With me?
BRENDAN
So far.
LAURA
A few months go by, and the next I hear
the Pin's raging over a situation with
some certain junk Em was partial to, and
the downfall's coming on Em's head.
BRENDAN
You think Em scraped the junk off the
Pin?
1
Not to weasel in a plug, but the original version of this scene (shot as written) is on the
deleted scenes section of the DVD. Available at fine retailers everywhere.
59
LAURA
I don't know, but whether she scraped or
copped or just ran her tab around the
world and into her own back, it must
have been grand. I've never seen the Pin
so hot.
BRENDAN
This all helps but it's not what I
asked. What's your angle in all this?
LAURA
I don't know. I'm usually pretty sharp,
but... maybe I see what you're doing for
Emily, trying to help her. And I don't
know anyone who would do that for me.
BRENDAN
Now you are dangerous.
Throwing the car in gear, she peels out and leaves him
standing alone in the fading evening light.
The class bell rings, and the cage quickly empties. Brendan
limps in, opens his locker. A note falls to his feet. It is
folded into a star. He pulls it open. "TWELVE THIRTY PICO &
ALEXANDER".
He fishes the old note out and compares them - different
handwriting.
62
The locker cage is now empty and silent, except for the
steady sound of heavy footfalls. Brendan looks up from the
notes.
A lug with a lumpish face is coming towards him. He wears a
black trenchcoat over bulbous shoulders, and his black hair
comes down over his eyes like a sheepdog's.
BRENDAN
You the Pin's?
No answer. The lug keeps coming.
BRENDAN (cont'd)
So what's his answer?
Closer, not slowing. Brendan tightens his hand into a fist.
Then CLICK! and a long slender switchblade gleams in the
lug's right paw.
Brendan jumps back as the lug swipes the blade at his torso.
Before the lug winds up for another slash Brendan is
running.
Brendan runs through the empty campus square, the lug
follows.
Wind rushing, sweating, the lug very close. Their footsteps
clatter on the cement. Brendan swings around a corner,
doubles back and stops with his back to a wall - he's lost
sight of him.
Brendan sweats, listening. The lug's footsteps echo through
the hallways, coming from all directions at once. Then it
seems clear - he's down the hall on Brendan's right.
Brendan dashes left. Wrong. The lug looms over him, his
knife hand flashing. Brendan's jacket shoulder tears open,
and the white filling inside turns red. He stumbles back
blindly, gets his footing and scrambles out of reach.
Brendan sprints away, down the hall, gaining about thirty
feet on the lug before turning the corner.
Brendan drops to a sitting position.
THE LUG AROUND THE CORNER
Running fast.
63
BRENDAN
Kicks his shoes off and clambers to his feet. The lug's
footsteps are impossibly loud.
THE LUG
Just about to round the corner.
BRENDAN
On his socked feet running silently back towards the corner.
The lug's footsteps crash like symbols as they both come
around the same corner in opposite directions at full speed.
Brendan slides like a baseball player, tangling his legs
into the lug's. The lug pitches forward with frightening
momentum. He hits the hall's metal handrail with his arms
and head. A hollow gong reverberates through the hallway,
and the lug falls like a puppet with his strings cut.
A wallet with a couple of twenties and a student ID (CHUCK
BURNS), three hash pipes, fifteen joints, a baggie of weed
and a large brownie in another baggie.
Brendan leaves it all on him and staggers off.
Brendan breathes heavily into the phone.
BRENDAN
Chuck Burns, big lug with hair like a
sheepdog.
THE BRAIN
(on the phone)
Yeah I know him, I just can't pin him to
any crowd. He's definitely not muscle
for anyone. He taps the Carrows crowd
but doesn't hang with them. If you've
got a guess I could check it out-
BRENDAN
The Pin. If he's with the Pin
everything's kablooie and I gotta blow
the burgh.
THE BRAIN
I'll check it. I'm in third now-
Brendan spots the Pin's Cady pulling into the parking lot.
64
BRENDAN
Never mind. If I don't call by three
call in the bulls.
Brendan hangs up and begins walking at a normal pace along
the sidewalk.
The cady pulls up beside him, and he stops walking. The door
swings open and a voice comes from inside.
VOICE
Get in.
With no perceivable hesitation, he does.
Brendan climbs out of the car on the exact spot they picked
him up. The Cady drives off. Brendan checks his watch.
BRENDAN'S WATCH
12:32. A phone begins to ring.
Brendan looks up from his watch and answers the payphone,
holding the receiver to his ear in silence.
VOICE
(on the phone)
I know what you did. I saw what you
did.1
The voice is low and garbled, filtered through something.
BRENDAN
So?
VOICE
Anyone I tell, it would ruin you some
way. And I'm going to tell someone.
BRENDAN
Are you making an offer?
VOICE
Maybe. Or maybe I'll just do you in.
BRENDAN
Hire another hash head to blade me?
1
Originally the source of this call was supposed to be a mystery, but during post
production we decided it was one layer too many, and identified the caller as Dode.
Brendan's first line was overdubbed in post to say `Dode?" instead of "So?"
66
VOICE
Don't need no blades, shamus. I just
gotta squawk.
BRENDAN
What do you want?
VOICE
Just to see you sweat.
CLICK. Brendan replaces the receiver and stands still for a
moment. Then he inserts a coin and dials.
THE BRAIN
(on the phone)
Brendan?
BRENDAN
Yeah.
THE BRAIN
You alright?
BRENDAN
Yeah, I'm fine. Keep digging on the
Burns lug, but the main thing is to find
Dode. He set up whatever Emily walked
into, it's getting more and more urgent
we talk.
THE BRAIN
Alright. Trueman was looking for you.
BRENDAN
Trueman and the VP?
THE BRAIN
No, just Trueman.
BRENDAN
Asked for me?
THE BRAIN
No, but looked.
BRENDAN
That's not good. Alright, keep me
posted.
Brendan hangs up.
67
A bonfire burns about a hundred feet off. Figures jump
through the blaze to thrash music. The Pin and Brendan
wander towards us on the dark beach.
PIN
So I'm going to start you on the dope
circles, cleaning up the Turkish dues,
pulling in the strags.
BRENDAN
Small fries.
PIN
Yeah, well. Just to see how you handle.
Anyway there isn't much else doing. I'm
tailing out this big deal, but that's
almost done.
BRENDAN
Oh yeah? What was it?
PIN
Big time. Biggest I ever done, and there
was a snag in it, but it's almost done
now.
BRENDAN
What was it?
PIN
It's over.
BRENDAN
Almost, you said.
PIN
It's over enough. You're gonna make me
curious, being so curious.
They sit in the sand, facing the breakers.
PIN (cont'd)
I gotta lay something out. You're coming
into a certain situation, and I'm
bringing you in sort of because of it.
1
If ever you want to witness a look of pure horror, shoot a micro budget feature film and
tell your cinematographer that there will be an extended scene on a beach at night.
Turns out it's difficult to light up a beach without very large and expensive equipment.
Who knew. Shooting at sunset proved a fortunate and less horror inducing solution.
68
(beat)
I didn't tell Tugger to hit you for the
Brad Bramish thing. Laura and I, I
decided I oughta hear what you were
gunning for before I made an enemy. Tug
just did it, though. He was hot, and he
just hit you. He's been doing that.
BRENDAN
Yeah?
PIN
He's got my best interests, I know, he's
loyal, he just gets hot.
BRENDAN
Muscle you can't control's no good at
that.
PIN
You're working for me, not Tug, that's
all.
BRENDAN
Alright.
A moment of silence. The breakers crash.
PIN
Things can get, you know, it's tough
sometimes. Twisted, complicated,
watching all the, I don't know.
Everyone's got their thing.
(silence)
You read Tolkien?
BRENDAN
What?
PIN
Tolkien, the Hobbit books?
BRENDAN
Yeah.
PIN
His descriptions of things are really
good.
BRENDAN
Oh yeah?
69
PIN
He makes you want to be there.
The waves crash. Behind them, with no warning at all, a
train shoots by. Tug stands with his hands jammed in his
pockets, flashing lights and gleaming metal streaking and
squealing behind him.
A cold gray morning. The Brain hands Brendan a photocopy of
a newspaper clipping, "LOCAL YOUTH HOSPITALIZED"
THE BRAIN
Frisco Farr was found on a sidewalk
outside Pinkerton's Deli three weeks
ago. He was in a coma, his stomach
contained a sausage sandwich, a horse
dose of Heroin and traces of Choleric
Tricemate, a poisonous chemical found in
laundry detergent. Frisco's still under
70
and nobody's talking, so nothing's come
of it.
BRENDAN
OD?
THE BRAIN
No, the chem the junk must have been cut
with put him down.
BRENDAN
Huh. Bad junk. Bad brick... could that
form of Heroin be called 'Brick'?
THE BRAIN
No -- it was a concentrated powder, its
street handle's 'whip' or 'rock' or
'brock'.
(fishes a note from his
pocket)
Here. From Laura.
BRENDAN
I told you to stay clear of Laura.
THE BRAIN
You tell her to stay clear of me?
He gives the note to Brendan, who unfolds it roughly.
BRENDAN
(mutters)
I gotta get voicemail.
The note reads "Meet me at the southeast corner of the
school at 9:30." Brendan crumples it into a ball.
BRENDAN (cont'd)
No. Tell her I'll be at the Pin's at
one. Any luck with the lug?
THE BRAIN
No.
The Brain lays out a local newspaper with Emily's picture -
"LOCAL GIRL MISSING". Uncomfortable silence.
BRENDAN
This isn't good.
The Brain looks hard at him. Brendan stares off into space
for a beat, then takes the Brain's cell phone and dials.
71
BRENDAN (cont'd)
(into phone)
Mr. Trueman please.
Brendan compares the two notes from his pocket with Laura's
- distinct handwriting on each.
TRUEMAN
(on the phone)
This is Trueman.
BRENDAN
What the hell are you doing asking for
me in class?
TRUEMAN
What the hell are you doing out of
class?
BRENDAN
What?
TRUEMAN
(very deliberate)
The VP and I needed to ask you a few
questions about Emily Kostich, who you
might have heard is missing. It's a very
serious thing. The police are involved.
The VP and I knew you two were close, so
the VP and I came to ask you questions,
but you were truant. If you don't have a
valid excuse-
Brendan hangs up.
THE BRAIN
What?
BRENDAN
I've been cut loose. I'm not safe here.
We shouldn't have met in the open.
Alright, lay low, but ask on the
underneath for Dode. That's all that
matters now, find Dode, but do it on the
underneath, got it?
THE BRAIN
What are you going to do?
BRENDAN
I'd like to have played it safe, but
there's no time. The Pin's not letting
72
anything drop, so I gotta push things a
bit.
THE BRAIN
How?
BRENDAN
I don't know. Just find Dode.
The bird of prey mailbox looms ominously. Brendan knocks on
the front door. No answer. He presses lightly on the screen
door, and it gives.
Brendan falls into Laura's idling car.
BRENDAN
(roughly)
A payphone, anywhere.
LAURA
What-
Brendan throws the car into drive, and they jerk forward.
PAYPHONE
The mobile customer you have called is
away from the phone-
Brendan slams the phone down violently and walks back
towards the car. His legs quiver, and a coughing fit hits.
78
Hacking and spluttering he falls to his knees. Laura's arms
wrap around him, except it isn't Laura, it's Emily. Brendan
spins backwards into
DARKNESS
Emily kissing his mouth, her hair around him, but it isn't
her hair, it's Laura's. Brendan shoots upwards
Brendan falls to his knees, coughing. Laura follows.
LAURA
Get back in the car, I'm taking you
home, you're sick, you need-
BRENDAN
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
He keeps yelling that until she does. His head spins.
BRENDAN (cont'd)
Okay, you've got to, what you've got to
do is drive around to the Carrows lot.
79
I'll be up on the, the blacktop, the
basketball field. So you've got to go by
you or me to get down there. If you see
anyone but the Pin or Tugger or their
crew go down into the ravine, honk four
times, long short long short. But don't
be seen.
LAURA
Get back in the car.
BRENDAN
Do it! Will you do it? I need you to do
this. I need you, here. Please.
He holds her shoulders. A beat, then her face registers
resignation.
A flat plane of pebbly asphalt with a dozen basketball
courts faintly outlined across its surface. Brendan stands
crooked, watching the barren horizon. The wind blows
bitterly, and the sky is dark.
Then, a speck. Coming towards Brendan, across the field.
Brendan slumps towards it. Closer. Still a dark dot. Closer.
Brendan's face snaps into recognition.
BRENDAN
What are you doing, Dode?
Dode grins. He holds a newspaper.
DODE
You gonna stop me?
BRENDAN
What do you think you're doing, Dode?
DODE
I saw you. I saw what you did.
BRENDAN
What'd you see?
DODE
I saw you.
BRENDAN
What'd you see me?
80
DODE
You were with her, dead, and you took
the body.
BRENDAN
Yeah, I did. That's all you saw? What
about before?
DODE
Before what?
BRENDAN
Did you see who killed her before I got
there?
DODE
(face ashen)
You killed her.
BRENDAN
I found the body, Dode.
DODE
You, I thought you didn't, but we
figured out, I got the news on ya, cause
you hid the body, why wouldn't-
BRENDAN
Who's 'we'?
DODE
Shut up! You're always talking, always
this and that smartso, you're gonna shut
up now!
BRENDAN
I didn't kill her, Dode.
DODE
You're not going to talk this!
BRENDAN
Dode, I know you're thinking of Em, I
know you tried to help her-
DODE
Shut up! You're gonna shut your
Brendan staggers, the world blurs out for a moment, then
snaps back.
DODE (cont'd)
put it over real nice-
81
BRENDAN
-so I'm telling you now you're in over
your head, you don't want to put your
hand in this-
Dode shakes the newspaper at him.
DODE
Shut up! She's dead, you-
BRENDAN
Why was she scared, Dode? She came to
me, who was she scared of? I think I
know why, I just gotta know who!
Dode throws the paper, which scatters in the wind.
DODE
You're trying to confuse me.
BRENDAN
Dode.
DODE
You couldn't stand it. Your little Em.
She was gonna keep it, it was mine, and
you couldn't stand that.
BRENDAN
What was yours?
DODE
I had you pegged.
BRENDAN
What was yours?
DODE
I loved her. And I woulda loved the kid.
I'm gonna bury you.
Brendan's face is empty. Dode walks stiffly away. Brendan
puts a hand on his shoulder, but shrinks back in a coughing
spasm. Dode grabs Brendan's wrist and hits him in the face.
Brendan hits the pavement.
82
Bright clouds, sharp light. Emily flies towards us, glowing,
then dimmer, her wings splutter out, the clouds turn gray,
and we are looking at Emily's picture in the newspaper
article.
Brendan pulls the newspaper off his face, lying in a fetal
position. Dode is nowhere to be seen.
Slowly, painfully, Brendan hoists himself up. He coughs and
splutters, barely able to keep his footing.
He limps across the field. Every step is agony. The wind
blows against him. The black field seems impossibly long,
still he keeps limping forward, towards the ravine.
Brendan slides down the embankment, landing on his feet.
Gathered around the drain tunnel entrance are Tugger, the
Pin, five of Tugger's flunkies and Dode in the middle.
Everyone looks at Brendan.
A long silence. Brendan clears his throat.
BRENDAN
What'd I miss?
More silence.
PIN
Dode here says Emily Kostich is dead.
Nobody reacts to that. Brendan's face is placid.
BRENDAN
Oh yeah?
PIN
Yeah. He says he knows who did it. He
says he knows where the body's at.
(beat of silence)
And he says he wants more money than I
think the information's worth.
BRENDAN
That so, Dode?
(to the Pin)
83
So walk. What's the info have to do with
you anyways?
DODE
Plenty.
PIN
Plenty, he says.
BRENDAN
Uh huh. And he wants cash on the nail.
He's a pot skulled reef worm with more
hop in his head than blood. Why pay for
dirt you can't believe?
DODE
You'll believe this.
BRENDAN
(shrugs)
Maybe you will.
DODE
You'll believe it, cause it's someone
close to you. Real close.
The Pin looks up at Brendan, whose face is loose and
nonchalant.
BRENDAN
Maybe it's hot, but it's Dode, you can't
trust it.
DODE
Real close.
Tugger's eyes are locked on Dode, his scar the color of raw
liver. Brendan laughs and turns away.
BRENDAN
I'm getting my shoes wet for this. Let
him milk you if you want.
PIN
(to Brendan)
Stay.
(to Dode)
It's still too much.
DODE
No it's not. You won't complain when you
hear it.
84
Tugger twists a stick in his hands. Brendan watches him,
curious.
BRENDAN
(murmurs)
So maybe you should.
DODE
You had her against the wall with the
brick -
PIN
I know my business. It's still too much.
DODE
(with growing confidence)
It's not, cause that's not why she was
killed, and it's real important to you,
cause the person who killed her's real
close, and cause he's got a lot to lose,
and he knows if I don't bury him by
spilling to you I spill to the bulls and
bury him for real, and he's really
really scared - she had a kid in her and
he couldn't stand -
Tugger springs like a cat.
He grabs Dode's hair and knees
his face.
Brendan stumbles towards them.
BRENDAN
Tug, it's alright!
Tug has Dode on the ground, kicking his stomach and chest.
PIN
Tug, stop.
Tug backs off. Dode raises his head.
Tug pulls the gun from his jacket.
Brendan yells, slips and falls into the shallow water.
Tug levels the gun at Dode's head and fires one shot. The
back of Dode's skull comes off.
The rapport reverberates through the black tunnel behind
them, and birds fly out. Dode remains upright for a moment,
then falls limp into the water.
85
The Pin's face is stupid, lifeless. Tug turns to him, gun in
hand.
PIN (cont'd)
(thickly)
Tug...
Tugger fires - dirt kicks up, and the Pin scrambles back.
Brendan crawls towards Tug, yelling for him to stop.
Tug fires twice more, both misses, and the Pin is away.
Distant sirens.
Brendan's vision blurs.
He stumbles and falls into the
shallow water.
FADE OUT
FADE IN:
A CEILING FAN
Spinning gently. Brendan's eyes open, watch it sleepily,
then sharpen.
On a lamplit street corner Brendan leans against a payphone.
THE BRAIN
(on phone)
Brendan?
BRENDAN
Yeah.
THE BRAIN
Are you - what, man, have you heard
about Dode-
BRENDAN
I was there.
THE BRAIN
You-
BRENDAN
Where were you yesterday? I called.
THE BRAIN
Kasprzyk took my phone, turned it off. I
just now got it back.
BRENDAN
Alright, listen-
THE BRAIN
Are you okay?
BRENDAN
Just listen. Is my name in the papers
with the story?
THE BRAIN
No.
BRENDAN
Alright. Is it just Dode in the papers?
THE BRAIN
Yeah. What do you mean?
88
BRENDAN
Listen, I'm going to be calling you
tonight, probably late. Sleep with your
phone on. Could you get a car if you
needed to?
THE BRAIN
If it's late enough I could take my
mom's-
BRENDAN
Be ready then. I'll call.
THE BRAIN
Alright.
Drama geeks sit in groups. The dressing room door flies open
and Kara flies out, stark naked. Brendan flies out after
her.
KARA
What are you doing?
BRENDAN
Showing your ace.
Brendan storms out.
1
Also on the DVD. Fine retailers everywhere.
90
Brendan walks past the bird of prey mailbox. A voice from
the screen door -
VOICE
Far enough.
The Pin.
PIN
Everyone's paying social calls.
BRENDAN
Laura here?
Beat of silence.
PIN
So?
BRENDAN
So what are the stats?
PIN
The stats are war, soon as the press
heat dies. And if you're with him,
you're with him.
BRENDAN
Tug got hot. He panicked.
PIN
Tug's been after my digs from the get
go.
BRENDAN
No. He's been anxious cause he thought
if you found out he killed Emily you'd
turn him over.
PIN
He was right.
BRENDAN
Yeah, well.
PIN
I told him to get the straight, no
roughing. I wasn't even there.
91
BRENDAN
Alright. So he's a hot head. So you
don't want him on your side, at least
let's have a pow wow fore we start
digging trenches. Maybe we can all walk
away amiable enemies. What would it
take?
PIN
I don't know. We'd have to square
everything between us. He owes me some
money.
BRENDAN
Alright, but we can talk.
PIN
Yeah, alright.
BRENDAN
Four o'clock.
PIN
Tomorrow?
BRENDAN
Tonight. Let's clear it all before it
boils up again.
PIN
Four tonight. You'll be here?
BRENDAN
Yeah.
Brendan turns away.
LAURA (OS)
Wait!
She comes out of the house with her purse.
LAURA (cont'd)
I'll drive you back.
Brendan slides into the black mustang and gutters off into
the night.
Overlooking a twinkling valley of suburban lights. Brendan
talks at a payphone beside the curbed mustang.
THE BRAIN
(on phone)
Yeah.
BRENDAN
Alright, I warned you. Can you get the
car?
THE BRAIN
Yeah.
BRENDAN
Go to 2014 Clancy, off Pico west of La
Grange. Park outside and wait. Laura's
inside. She hasn't got a car, but if she
blows on foot or gets a pick, tail her.
Alright?
(silence)
Alright?
THE BRAIN
Okay.
BRENDAN
I'll call you when it gets light.
(silence)
Thanks, Brain.
CLICK, Brain hangs up.
Brendan pulls the mustang into the driveway, limps up to the
front door and knocks. One of the Pin's boys lets him in.
97
Brendan scrambles out, slips on the grass and hits the
ground hard.
Two sharp gunshots come from the house.
Everything is suddenly still. Brendan stands slowly.
He notices a light from the Mustang - the trunk has drifted
open.
Inside, a pale blue arm lies tangled in black plastic. Blue
fingernails. Cheap plastic bracelets.
Brendan shuts the trunk solidly, then walks off down the
street and vanishes into the inky night.
A moment later police cars pull up, sirens blaring, lights
turning the dark streets bright as day.
FADE OUT
FADE IN:
The morning is cold and clammy. Brendan slumps against the
payphone.
103
BRENDAN
Hey. Where are you?
THE BRAIN
(on phone)
Library. Where are you?
BRENDAN
Did she blow last night?
THE BRAIN
No. Stayed there till six thirty, then
walked to school.
BRENDAN
You didn't give her a ride, did you?
THE BRAIN
No.
BRENDAN
But she came straight to school from
Tug's?
THE BRAIN
Yeah.
BRENDAN
She there now?
THE BRAIN
Yeah. Not with me, but here.
BRENDAN
Alright. Tell her I wanna meet up on the
basketball field in half an hour, then
go home and get some sleep.
THE BRAIN
Alright.
Brendan hangs up, then pauses, lost in thought.
Brendan sits against the massive gym building, writing on a
piece of looseleaf paper.
Brendan slips the paper under a door stenciled "VP Offices".
104
Cold, barren. Wind whistles softly and jangles the metal
mesh basketball nets like windchimes.
Brendan stands crookedly, hands in pockets, eyes trained on
the cold black horizon. A speck appears. Brendan waits for
it, bracing himself against the wind.
Laura. She puts her arms around him, a warm embrace. Brendan
draws back.
LAURA
(softly)
Did you see it all? With Tug and the
Pin?
Brendan looks at her a moment.
BRENDAN
No. I took your advice and didn't go.
LAURA
(confused)
No?
BRENDAN
What happened?
Laura looks at him strangely, a little uneasy.
LAURA
The papers say six dead, three around
the house, one girl in the trunk of
Tug's car, and the Pin and Tug.
Brendan's face is frozen in an ambiguous frown.
BRENDAN
Yeah?
LAURA
Tug tried to shoot his way out when the
police got there. They tied him to Dode,
too. Same gun. And the girl.
BRENDAN
Huh.
LAURA
Well good thing you weren't there.
105
BRENDAN
Yeah.
Laura's face softens a bit.
LAURA
You think the girl was Emily?
BRENDAN
Probably.
Laura embraces him again, and doesn't let go.
LAURA
You loved her.
BRENDAN
(distant)
Yeah I did.
LAURA
You did all this cause you loved her.
And now it's finished.
(tightens her embrace)
I love you.
BRENDAN
No.
Laura pulls back, looks at his face. It is a mask.
LAURA
What?
BRENDAN
No, it's not finished. Tug pulled the
trigger on Em and he got the fall, but
the bulls coulda found that out without
me.
Laura pulls back more.
BRENDAN (cont'd)
I set out to know who put her in the
spot, who put her in front of the gun.
That was you, angel.
LAURA
(drifting back further)
What are you talking about?
106
BRENDAN
It was you. What, you want the whole
tale? You want me to tell it to you?
LAURA
(bewildered)
Tell it to me.
BRENDAN
Alright, from the top. You had your
fingers in Brad Bramish for appearances
and to keep him buying from the Pin, who
you were hooked with. Emily came to you
and Brad, you saw her for what she was,
an insecure little girl trying to get
in. She goes on the backburner.
Meanwhile maybe you're getting bored,
maybe just greedy, so when the Pin
scores big with the bricks you take your
shot. You hook one, take half, and cut
it back to size, but you cut it bad.
Maybe accidentally, maybe to down the
Pin's operation, doesn't matter. You put
it back, but poor Frisco doses off it
and lands in a coma.
(voice strengthening)
So now the Pin's fuming, maybe he's
jealous of Brad, so he comes to Brad's
crowd looking for blood, or at least a
scape. You know trouble. There's going
to be a war over this. And there's
Emily. She trusts you. She wants in.
It's duck soup.
LAURA
(murmurs)
No.
BRENDAN
You frame her for the bad brick, then
you cut her loose. You turn on your heel
and bite her in the throat. Last week on
the payphone, Pico and Alexander, she
saw something she was scared of. Tug's
car driving by, the Pin driving, but she
wouldn't have seen the Pin. No, she was
across the street, angel. She saw the
passenger side. She saw you. She saw you
and ran like she saw some devil.
Laura's face is very still, quivering.
107
LAURA
Brendan, why are you-
BRENDAN
And she took the hit. Dode hid her away,
but the Pin was on to her, tracked her
down, told her to meet him, that they
would make good. Gave her a time, and a
place. And sent Tug. Just to get the
straight. But maybe you had talked Tug
up, or maybe he just blew a fuse, but Em
sprung it on him that she had her kid,
and he did what anyone could count on
Tug doing - he hit her. She took the hit
for you. You let her take it.
LAURA
Stop it!
BRENDAN
That's the tale.
LAURA
Stop it!
BRENDAN
You're going to tell me it's not?
LAURA
It's not!
BRENDAN
Look at me.
She crumples against him, looking him straight in the eye.
LAURA
You know me. I've only helped you. How
can you - It isn't true!
She sobs through a tensed, straight face. Brendan holds her
stare, but his eyes are distant.
BRENDAN
I hope it isn't. I want you to have been
on my side all along, not just trying to
get me under your thumb like Brad and
the Pin and Tug.
LAURA
No-
108
BRENDAN
But I think you knew that meeting was
going to blow up. I think that was your
final play. But I hope I'm wrong. I hope
everything I wrote in the note I dropped
at Gary Trueman's office this morning is
wrong. About your and Brad's involvement
in the Pin's runnings. I hope you didn't
steal the brick last night. In your
purse.
LAURA
(breathes)
I didn't.
BRENDAN
That's good. That means you didn't let
me walk into a slaughterhouse. You
didn't lead Tug and the Pin and their
crews to the slaughter. And when Trueman
reads the note, takes my cue and
searches your locker, he won't find a
damn thing.
Something changes in Laura's eyes.
Trueman and several other men force Laura's locker open.
From its dark interior the chalky white brick falls out,
spins through the air, and shatters silently on the locker
cage floor.
A moment of silence between them. The basketball nets
jangle.
Laura steps back. She looks as if she has been punched in
the face.
LAURA
(murmurs)
Brendan... don't...
BRENDAN
(gently)
It's done.
Her face does strange things, subtle contortions.
She watches his eyes. He doesn't look at her. Her voice
shakes.
109
LAURA
Done. Well. That's most of it. 9 out of
10. I told Em to tell Tug it was his.
Told her it would soften him up. She
said she wished she could keep it, but
she didn't love the father. I was going
to drive her down the next day, we'd
found a doctor. Most wouldn't. She was
starting to show. 3 months. You know
whose kid that makes it, or have you
known all along?
Slowly, steadily, she straightens up. Her figure takes back
some dignity. She steps towards him deliberately. Closer.
Right up against him.
She brings her head to his, puts her lips to his ear,
breathes warm breath, and says two words. The first is
LAURA (cont'd)
Mother-
the second is low, guttural and lost to the whistling wind.
She turns and walks briskly away.
Brendan watches her go across the dark, barren field of
asphalt.
Metal jangles. Brendan turns to see the Brain hopping a
chain link fence. Brendan turns his eyes back on Laura.
BRENDAN
You get your straight?
THE BRAIN
Yeah. I wouldn't have-
BRENDAN
S'alright.
THE BRAIN
Yeah, well. Chuck Burns came to. The
knife guy. Spilled it all to the bulls,
guess Brad Bramish hired him. On his
own, just a grudge thing.
BRENDAN
(nods slightly)
Fits. You did good, Brain. Go sleep.
THE BRAIN
Yeah, you too.
110
The Brain starts to walk away, but turns back.
THE BRAIN (cont'd)
What'd she whisper to you?
BRENDAN
She called me a dirty word.
THE BRAIN
Alright, you don't have to tell me.
Thick.
BRENDAN
As what-all.
Brendan stands alone on the asphalt field, watching
Laura until she reaches the end of the field and walks
off behind a twisted chain linked fence.
The first period bell rings, and Brendan walks back
towards campus.
FADE OUT.
