      FADE IN:

      INT. ELI'S BEDROOM -- DAY

      ELI KELLER (16, rocker dude) sleeps the sleep of the dead. 
      RONNIE (12, his hyper younger sister) shakes him.  Hard.

                                      RONNIE
                    Eli, wake up!

                                    ELI
                    No... I didn't eat it...

                                      RONNIE
                    You're late!  Oooh. And he's drooling. 
                          (beat)
                      Teenagers.

      INT. MAC-MASS HIGH: FRONT HALL -- DAY

      Eli stumbles in.  Looks around.  All clear.  No one there.

      REVEAL PRINCIPAL PAL (mid-forties, bitter, scary).  Eli jumps.

                                    ELI
                    Whoa!  You scared me.  Good one. 

                                      PRINCIPAL PAL
                    You're late.

                                    ELI
                    So I better get going...

                    Move!  Move!  Move!

      Eli scurries along and...

                                                                              SWOOSH TO:

      EXT. MAC-MASS HIGH: PICNIC TABLES -- DAY

      CAITLIN and DAKOTA TOYOTA sit on the table.  Eli runs up.

                                      CAITLIN
                    Eli, you're late. 

                                      DAKOTA TOYOTA
                    Living on Eli Time. 

                                      CAITLIN
                    Who's late to chill?

                                    ELI
                    I'm sorry guys I'll make it up to
                    you.
                          (beat, realization)
                    Time check?

      Eli checks his watch... but it's not on his wrist.

                                    ELI (CONT'D)
                    Forgot my...

      Eli grabs Caitlin's wrist to check her watch.

                                    ELI (CONT'D)
                    Oh no.  I'm late for my date with -

                                                                              SWOOSH TO:

      EXT. CAF  INFERNO PATIO -- DAY

      TRACY DUPONT-ROYMONT (16, every boy's fevered dream) sips a
      smoothie.  Eli runs up...

                                    ELI
                    Trace!  I am so, so sorry...

      REVEAL CODY FLOWERS (the school's badboy) at Trace's table.

                                    CODY FLOWERS
                    For what?      FAMILY BIZ: JUST IN TIME        "Green"     27 August  08             3.

                                    ELI
                    Oh man, Cody.  How could you cut in
                    on me like this?

                                    CODY FLOWERS
                    Cut in?  No way.  I'd never do that
                    to you.  Without your permission.
                          (smiles to Trace)
                    I'm loyal.

                                      TRACE
                    Eli, you stood me up.  Not acceptable.

                                    ELI
                    But I'm not late.  We said smoothies
                    at four thirty.  And it's only...

                                    CODY FLOWERS
                          (off his watch)
                    Four forty five.  Living on Eli time.

                                    ELI
                    ...which is totally within the zone.

                                      TRACE
                    Four thirty on Tuesday and today
                    is...?

                                    ELI
                      Wednesday...

                                    CODY FLOWERS
                      Twenty-four hours late.  A new record.
                          (the cheer)
                    Eli!  Eli!  Eli!

                                    ELI
                    Dude.  You're not helping.

      FADE IN:

      INT. ATTIC -- DAY

      An old broken clock hangs on the wall.  Its second hand
      quivers at 2:45.

      PAN DOWN TO FIND -

      Eli begging his Dad, DAVE KELLER. 

                                    ELI
                    Dad, you have got to get me off of
                    Eli Time. 

                                    DAVE
                    You sound desperate.

                                    ELI
                    That's why I'm here.

                                    DAVE
                    And only thirty-five minutes late
                    for our appointment.  Not bad.

                                    ELI
                    I've tried everything to be on time. 
                    I set my watch ahead ten minutes...

      Eli goes to show Dave his watch.  But... no watch.

                                    DAVE
                    What watch?

                                    ELI
                    I tried getting up super early....

      Wearing a SPACE SUIT Eli walks into school through a cloud
      of rocket exhaust.  We hear the gentle HOOPER... HOOPER of
      his breathing apparatus.  Dakota cowers.

                                      DAKOTA TOYOTA
                    Don't harm us, Space Dude.

                                    ELI
                    Do not be afraid.

      INT. ATTIC -- MOMENTS LATER (REALITY)

      Eli shakes himself awake from that nightmare.

                                    ELI
                    Or was that just a dream? 

                                    DAVE
                          (sincere)
                    No.  No time travel doesn't have to
                    be a dream, son.  We raise a little
                    research and development money, hire
                    just the right scientists...      FAMILY BIZ: JUST IN TIME        "Green"     27 August  08             6.

                                    ELI
                    Dad, this is serious.

                                    DAVE
                          (covering)
                    Oh right... go on...

                                    ELI
                    Being on Eli Time is putting the
                    most important relationship in my
                    life at total risk.

                                    DAVE
                          (chuckles)
                    Son, I can forgive you... 

                                    ELI
                    No not you, Dad.  Trace.

                                    DAVE
                    Oh right.  Go on.

                                    ELI
                    Here's my plan.  You get me a car
                    and a responsible adult - could even
                    be you - as my designated driver. 
                    Car plus driver equals I get where I
                    need to go on time.

                                    DAVE
                    Simple... maybe simple minded... No
                    car.  But that does give me an idea.

                                    ELI
                      A motorcycle?

                                    DAVE
                          (ignores that)
                    No.  Instead we apply the manufacturing
                    principle of Just-In-Time.  Car makers
                    never have their parts on hand.  Parts
                    arrive to the assembly line as needed. 
                    Pretend that you're a hubcap.  Roll to
                    each appointment Just-In-Time.

                    just in time...just in time.

                    And so like a good parts manager
                    I'll guide you on your path to market.

                                    ELI
                    All day?

                                    DAVE
                    Yes.  One on one.  Mano a mano.

      We find AVALON KELLER (15, aspires to be Type A but only
      makes B+) and TONIA KELLER (Eli's distracted Mom). 

      Avalon is doing cheerleader type maneuvers with two CABBAGES
      (instead of pompoms). 

      As Eli enters, Avalon abruptly stops her practice...

                                    ELI
                    Or what if I just try a little bit
                    to get places early?

      Avalon and Tonia crack up.

                                      TONIA
                    Oh honey, that is so sweet. 

                                      AVALON
                    Sweet and deluded.

                                      TONIA
                    Avalon, be supportive.  We all know
                    that women are much better organized
                    than men... We have to juggle so
                    much more.  Home... career... ruling

                    That is a little sexist...

                          the tree)
                    But, really, I'm here for Eli. 
                    Keeping him on track.

      Dave retreats behind the tree.

                                    ELI
                          (whispers)
                    He just needs to feel useful.

                                    DAVE
                    Also true.  We all do.  All of us. 
                    Everyone.

      And he goes back behind the tree.

                    Thank you.

                          (flirty)
                    So Mr. Eli Keller... I was thinking  
                    we could check out the new comics
                    when they come in tomorrow.

                                    ELI
                    Yeah I'm totally down.

                                      DAKOTA TOYOTA
                    Dude, a moment. 
                          (to Caitlin)
                    A little guy talk... I mean guy talk.

                                      CAITLIN
                    Manly grunts.  Got it.

      Dakota Toyota pulls Eli aside, KNOCKS on his noggin.

                                      DAKOTA TOYOTA
                    Dude.  Tomorrow?  After school? 
                      Cheerleader tryouts? 

                                    ELI
                    Oh, right.  Don't sweat it.  With my
                    Dad on my case, I'll be there.

      From across the yard, Dave calls over...

                                    DAVE
                    And where are these cheerleaders
                    going to be? 

      Caitlin shoots Eli a disgusted look.

      Eli shoots a "don't kill me" smile back at Caitlin.

                                    DAVE (CONT'D)
                    It's got to be in the schedule.

                                    ELI
                    Dad, I'll get back to you on that.

                                    DAVE
                    We have to mark it down. Along with
                    all your other appointments. 
                          (note in schedule)

      Caitlin simmers.  OFF Eli's sheepish smiles --

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      INT. FAMILY ROOM -- DAY

      Dave and Eli come in from the Mud Room. 

                                    ELI
                    ...and home.  Whoo hoooo!

      He checks his wrist.  Still no watch.  He checks Dave's wrist.

                                    ELI (CONT'D)
                    On time.  To the second.  Dad, I
                    don't say this often but... your
                    planrked.  Thank you.

      Dave's scribbled all over Eli's schedule.  He's worried.

                                    DAVE
                    Friday's looking tricky though

                                    ELI
                    But with you riding shotgun I can
                    squeeze in even more cool stuff. 

                                    DAVE
                    More cool stuff?!

      Avalon swings through.

                                      AVALON
                    Need a favour.  There's a pizza in
                    it for you.

                                    ELI
                    I'm in.

                                    DAVE
                    Don't you want to know what it is?

                                    ELI
                    A round form of food topped by
                    pepperoni and... oh, what favour?

                                      AVALON
                    Tomorrow you pick up Ronnie after
                    school for me. 

                                    ELI
                    Hang on.  Why can't you do it?

                                      AVALON
                    I have some...thing.      FAMILY BIZ: JUST IN TIME        "Green"     27 August  08             16.

                                    ELI
                            (suspicious)
                    Think?  What thing?

                                      AVALON
                          (points behind Eli)
                    Look!  Cookies!

                                    ELI
                          (looks around)
                    Where?

      And Avalon disappears.  Eli turns back.

                                    ELI (CONT'D)
                    How does she do that?

      Eli heads into...

      INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

      ...and Dave follows. 

                                    DAVE
                    By distracting you, son.  Which is
                    not all that hard to do.  Which is
                    why you are always late. 

                                    ELI
                      I disagree.

                                    DAVE
                    Eli, you get distracted by food.

      Distracted, Eli opens the fridge.

                                    ELI
                    Let's see what we've got.

                                    DAVE
                    ...by girls...

                                    ELI
                    Wonder if Trace is still mad at me? 
                    Maybe if I bring her some salsa...

      Now RONNIE KELLER scooters in to protest. 

                                      RONNIE
                    Dad, why do I have to be picked up
                    by Eli?  He's completely unreliable. 

                                    ELI
                    Not anymore.

                                    ELI
                    Yes.

                                    DAVE
                    No cancellations.

                                    ELI
                    Nope.  I am focused.

      The phone RINGS.  Distracted, Eli picks up.

                                                                        INTERCUT WITH:

      Trace is on her cell phone.

                    Hello.

                    Trace!  Hi.  Avalon's not here...

                                      TRACE
                    That's okay.  I wanted you.

                                    ELI
                    Really?  Right.  Of course you did. 

                                      TRACE
                    I'm giving you another chance.

                                    ELI
                    Why?  I mean: Great.

                                      TRACE
                    Cody explained what happened.

                                    ELI
                    He did? 

                                      TRACE
                    I think it's kinda cool that you
                    saved that old lady's life.      FAMILY BIZ: JUST IN TIME        "Green"     27 August  08             18.

                            (scrambling, what?)
                    I really didn't do much...

                                      TRACE
                    Eli you are too modest. Mouth to
                    mouth?  And she had a mustache? 
                    That is so brave.  You're lucky Cody

      Dave waves at Eli trying to prevent a disaster.  Stop!

                                      TRACE
                    Friday.  Five o'clock.  Bye.

      Eli hangs up, so very happy.

                                    ELI
                    YES!

      Dave and Ronnie stare at him.

                    Ronnie.  Conference.

      Dave and Ronnie go to the kitchen island.  They unfold the

                    Wow.  Daddy... that's... impossible.

                    That's what I was thinking.

                                      RONNIE
                    Something has to give.

                                    DAVE
                    Probably Trace.

                                    ELI

                    Dad, when you said "together..."

      REVEAL Dave and Eli wearing regular clothes but with huge

      Dave takes out a BUNGEE CORD and hooks it up to their belts.

                    This way you can't wander off.

      Eli stretches to the end of the cord.  It SPROINGS.  Eli
      snaps back to Dave.

      Dave on the move. Tethered to his Dad, Eli lags behind.

      The Bungee cords tense and SPROING - Eli shoots forward. 

                                    DAVE
                    Keep up.  Keep focused.  Your schedule
                    today is too tight for slacking.
                          (re: the bungees)
                    Or slack.  These are your life lines.

      OFF Eli, considering that -

      EXT. SPACE -- ENDLESS NIGHT (FANTASY)

        Eli-The-Astronaut floats in the nothingness, one very long
      bungee is his life line.  We hear the gentle HOOPER HOOPER
      of his breathing. [Prod note: green screen and actor action].

                    What?  Was I supposed to be watching
                    the Oh Two levels?  I was texting my
                    buds.  Don't worry, Eli.  I'll be
                    back.  Right after my snack, Eli.

      Eli pulls in the bungee/lifeline and examines the end.

      The end is shorn off.

                                    ELI
                      NOOOOOOOOO!

      The bell RINGS.  School is over.  Students escape.  Eli
      wanders out still trying to shake off that vision.

                                    DAVE
                    Ready, Eli?

                                    ELI
                    Think so.

      They step into their harnesses.  Sam Sidekick watches.

                    Clipped.  Stretch.

      They stretch to the limit of the bungees and SPROING back.      FAMILY BIZ: JUST IN TIME        "Green"     27 August  08             22.

      They pound their feet to get their blood moving.

                                    ELI
                      Countdown.

                                    ELI
                    Coming through!

      Eli and Dave sprint down the hall scattering STUDENTS and
      SLAMMING lockers in their mad charge.

      Avalon leaves a classroom.  But the mad rush forces her back.

                                      AVALON
                    Hey!  I'll be late.
                          (at the door)
                    Let me out!  Would you let me through.

      But the other students won't move.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

                    Hey!

      And Avalon gets pushed back into her classroom again.

      Dave and Eli join Dakota on the slope overlooking the field.

                    Just in time.

      On the field, COACH HAGGIS leads the cheerleader tryouts. 
      Instead of pompoms, the girls practice with cabbages.

                                      COACH HAGGIS
                    Come on, ladies.  Let's get going!

      As the girls pump their cabbages -

                                      COACH HAGGIS (CONT'D)
                    Build that upper body cheering
                    strength.  Give me a "C"...

                    They're going to start throwing the
                    cabbages soon.

      Avalon limps onto the field.

                                      COACH HAGGIS
                    You're late, Keller.      FAMILY BIZ: JUST IN TIME        "Green"     27 August  08             24.

                    Sorry.

                                      COACH HAGGIS
                    And you're out.

                                      AVALON
                    What?

                                      COACH HAGGIS
                    No room for slackers on my squad. 
                    This is all about dedication.  Hard
                    work.  And timeliness.  My squad is
                    timely.
                          (to cheerleaders)
                    And peppy!  Pep!  Pep!  Pep!

      ON ELI, DAVE AND DAKOTA.

                                    ELI
                    Avalon was late. And for cheerleading. 
                    Never thought I'd see that!

      Avalon limps back to Eli.

                                    ELI (CONT'D)
                    So, Av, maybe women can't juggle as
                    much as men.

                    It's all your fault.  You made me
                    late!  Both of you.  You mowed me
                    down in the hall.  You... hall mowers.

                    Maybe, Chicken, this is for the best. 
                    You really think that cheerleading
                    is the right fit for you?

                                      AVALON
                    Yes, I know it's extremely perky but
                    it is fun!  And very important in
                    certain high school social circles.

                                      DAKOTA TOYOTA
                          (watching cheerleaders)
                    They are...soooooo peppy.

                    Let's go.      FAMILY BIZ: JUST IN TIME        "Green"     27 August  08             25.

                    But it's just getting good.

      Dave pulls Eli away.

      HOLD ON AVALON AND DAKOTA.

                                      AVALON
                    You know what I'm thinking...

                                      DAKOTA TOYOTA
                    How do they jump so high?  With so
                    much grace?

                                      AVALON
                    No... how do I seek revenge?  With
                    your help.  Where is Eli heading...? 
                    Dakota?  Where is he going...?

      Dakota skitters away from her, a little scared.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      Too late.  They get tangled around a parking meter.

                                    ELI
                    Ow, ow, ow.

                      Clockwise.  You go clockwise.  I'll
                    go counterclockwise.

      Eli looks for his watch.  He still does not have it on.

                                    DAVE (CONT'D)
                    That way.

      While they are still entangled...

                    Hi Caitlin.

                                      CAITLIN
                    Some really cool titles came in. 
                    Let's check them out.      FAMILY BIZ: JUST IN TIME        "Green"     27 August  08             26.

                                    DAVE
                    No time.

                                      CAITLIN
                    Excuse me.

                                    DAVE
                    According to the sched you don't
                    have the time to go in and browse. 
                          (hands Caitlin a twenty)
                    Caitlin, could you buy some comics
                    for my son. Oooh and the latest issue
                    of Stratosblast for me. 

                                    ELI
                    What fun is that?

      Dave takes Eli aside.

                                    DAVE
                    Eli.  Focus.  What's your goal?

                                    ELI
                          (quietly)
                    Trace.  You're right.  Stay here.

      Dave holds onto the parking meter.

                                    DAVE
                    I'm ready.  Go.

      Eli stretches the bungee cord to the breaking point to Caitlin
      for privacy.

                                    ELI
                    I'll make this up to you.

                                      CAITLIN
                    You better.

      And... SPROING...

      Eli bounces back, right into Dave's arms.

                                    DAVE
                    Let's go, go, go.

      Dave and Eli rush off.  Re-entangled in the parking meter. 
      Disentangle themselves again.  Rush off again...

      OFF Caitlin's frustration -

                                                                              SWOOSH TO:      FAMILY BIZ: JUST IN TIME        "Green"     27 August  08             27.

      EXT. RONNIE'S SCHOOL -- DAY

      CLOSE ON RONNIE as she waits for her pick-up.

      Her eyes widen.

                                    DAVE & ELI (O.S.)
                    Nyaaaaah!

      And they swoop her up and keep on going.

                                      RONNIE
                    Best.  Ride.  Ever.

                                                                              SWOOSH TO:

      EXT. CAF  INFERNO PATIO - DAY

      Eli and Dave run up...carrying Ronnie.  Dave is winded. 
      They see -

      TRACE AT HER TABLE.

      BACK ON ELI AND DAVE -

      Eli grabs Dave's wrist.  Checks his watch.

                                    ELI
                    Just in time.

      Eli considers himself: sweaty, disheveled and tied to Dad.

      Trace spots them.

                                      TRACE
                    Eli, over here.  Hi Mr. Keller.

                                    DAVE
                    Hey Trace.

                                    ELI
                    Okay Dad.  We did it.  We arrived. 
                    I didn't miss anything.  You can go.

                                    DAVE
                    Right.  Going...
                          (tries to unhook)
                    The bungees are all twisty.

      They are stuck.  Eli struggles with the harness.

                                    ELI
                    Why is this so tight?      FAMILY BIZ: JUST IN TIME        "Green"     27 August  08             28.

                                    DAVE
                    Safety.  Go with it.  We'll work
                    this out.

                                    ELI
                          (to Trace, trying for
                            smooth)
                    Hey there.

                                      TRACE
                    Hey, Eli.  Crazy day?

                                    ELI
                    Had some business to take care of...

                                      TRACE
                    With your Dad...?  What's with the
                    bungee?  Separation anxiety?  And
                    your sister?

      ON RONNIE AND DAVE -

      As Dave strains backwards against the pull of the bungee.

                                      RONNIE
                    I'm hungry.  It is snack time.

                                    DAVE
                    Didn't you eat your lunch?

                                      RONNIE
                    Yes and now it's snack time.

      BACK TO TRACE AND ELI.

                                    ELI
                    This is one of those funny stories.

      Eli tries to sit.  He yanks Dave forward to get enough slack.

                                    ELI (CONT'D)
                    I know I'm laughing.  On the inside.

                                    DAVE
                    Excuse me.  Do you mind if I have
                    some water?

                                    ELI
                    Yes... I do....

                                    DAVE
                    Running over here... whoa.  Too many
                    hours behind the desk. 
                          (pounds his tummy)
                    I have got to get back in shape.      FAMILY BIZ: JUST IN TIME        "Green"     27 August  08             29.

                                    ELI
                    And back to your attic. 

                                      TRACE
                    Eli, be nice.  When our parents get
                    older, we have to look out for them. 

      Trace hands him the water.

                                    DAVE
                    Thank you. 

                                      RONNIE
                    Still hungry.

      And Avalon saunters up.

                                      AVALON
                    Hey Trace.

                                    ELI
                    Wha --

                                      TRACE
                    Your entire family shows up on your
                    dates?  That is so... old world.

                                    ELI
                    Well, not my mom....

                                      TRACE
                    Too bad.  She's a lot of fun.

                                      AVALON
                    Maybe we got our signals crossed. 
                    In these busy times it's so easy to
                    get confused.

                                      RONNIE
                    Or hungry.

                                      AVALON
                    Let me check the schedule.

      Avalon grabs Eli's schedule and... as planned...

                                      AVALON (CONT'D)
                    Look, an ice cream truck!

      While everyone looks off distracted, Avalon scribbles
      something onto Eli's schedule.

                                      RONNIE
                    There's no...      FAMILY BIZ: JUST IN TIME        "Green"     27 August  08             30.

                                      AVALON
                    Dad, have you looked at this?

                                    DAVE
                    I'm living it.

                                      AVALON
                    Look again.

      Dave extends to the end of the line.  He reads the schedule.

                                    DAVE
                    Oh.

      ON ELI -

      He leans back as the bungees get tauter.

                                    ELI
                    Ow, ow, ow.

      Suddenly, the bungee goes slack.

                                    ELI (CONT'D)
                    Finally.

      REVEAL DAVE -

      Right next to Eli.

                                    DAVE
                    Trace.  It's been lovely... but we
                    have to go.

                                    ELI
                    No we don't.

                                    DAVE
                    Yes.  We.  Do.

      Dave rushes off... SPROING... Eli gets yanked behind him.

                                    ELI
                    Cody!

      From nowhere, Cody Flowers appears.

                                    CODY FLOWERS
                    I'm on it.

      He slides in next to Trace.      FAMILY BIZ: JUST IN TIME        "Green"     27 August  08             31.

                                    CODY FLOWERS (CONT'D)
                    You see Eli and his dad are in
                    training for the World Championship...
                    freestyle bungee sprinting team.

                                      TRACE
                    Really?

                                    CODY FLOWERS
                    Okay.  They're junior fire fighters. 
                    In smoke filled buildings firemen,
                    they bungee themselves together...
                          (off her look)
                    I have no clue.

                                                                                CUT TO:

      EXT. GAMERVILLE -- DAY

      ...past Gamerville where they dodge Caitlin with her bag of
      comics and the -

                                      CAITLIN
                          (warning)
                    Parking Meter.

      Eli swoops by grabbing a bag of comics.

                                    ELI
                      Thaaaaaanks....

      ...they race to...

                                                                              SWOOSH TO:

      EXT. MAC-MASS HIGH: SPORTS FIELD -- DAY 3

      ...past the cheerleader try-outs...

                                    ELI
                    Wow.  That's so...

      Eli pauses, grabs an errant cabbage, only to get jerked
      forward by Dave...

                                    ELI (CONT'D)
                      PEEEEEEPPPPPPPY!

                                                                              SWOOSH TO:

      INT. FRONT HALL -- DAY

      Eli and Dave burst in.  Mmentum carries Eli up the stairs,
      Dave into the kitchen.  They snag themselves on the banister.      FAMILY BIZ: JUST IN TIME        "Green"     27 August  08             32.

                                    DAVE & ELI
                    Whoa.

                                    DAVE
                    Down the stairs.

                                    ELI
                    Coming down.

                                    DAVE
                          (exhales, checks watch)
                    And just in time.

                                    ELI
                      Excellent.  Just in time for what?

                                    DAVE
                    Last stop of your day.  The most
                    important one.

      Dave heads into...

      INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

      ...where Eli pursues him.

                                    ELI
                    What?  I missed the cheerleader
                    tryouts, the new comics and blew my
                    date with Trace. 
                          (beat)
                    Okay, okay I get it.  I wasn't paying
                    attention to my life.  Things got a
                    little wonky.  I'll try harder.  We
                    can hug now if that's required.

                                    DAVE
                    I think we're fine.

                                    ELI
                    But what is so important that I have
                    to be here right now?

                                    DAVE
                    Keller Family dinner.  And your mom's
                    cooking.  We are not missing that.
                          (off Eli's look)
                    It's in your schedule.

      Eli grabs the schedule.

                                    ELI
                    That's not my writing.

      Dave grabs the schedule.      FAMILY BIZ: JUST IN TIME        "Green"     27 August  08             33.

                                    DAVE
                    It's not my writing.  Okay but then
                    who...?

      Eli realizes what's going on.  He picks up the cabbages. 
      Starts a routine.

                                    ELI
                    Give me an "A"...

                                    DAVE
                    A.

                                    ELI
                    Give me a V... and so on.  And so
                    on.  What's that spell...?  Avalon.

      REVEAL Avalon in the kitchen door.  She carries garden shears.

                                      AVALON
                    Hi.

      SLICE.  Avalon sets Eli and Dave free by cutting the cord.

                                      AVALON (CONT'D)
                    Now this craziness is over.

                                    ELI
                    Maybe for me... but not for you.

      As Eli circles Avalon... 

      OFF Eli, not happy at all -

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      INT. FAMILY ROOM -- DAY

      Dave meets with Avalon and Eli.

                                      AVALON
                    You know, he did ruin my tryout.

                                    ELI
                    But not on purpose.  The way you
                    messed up my date.

                                      AVALON
                    Dad, is this really necessary?

                                    DAVE
                    No.  But it's fair.

      REVEAL Avalon's punishment.      FAMILY BIZ: JUST IN TIME        "Green"     27 August  08             34.
