      As Meredith hurries Alexis along, they talk in hushed tones. 

                                  ALEXIS
                    Mom, Grandpa died six years ago.

                                  MEREDITH
                    I know, but a death in the family? 
                    Always a great excuse to get out of 
                    school.

                                  ALEXIS
                    No. It s a creepy excuse. 

                                  MEREDITH
                    Come on. I need some Alexis time. 
                    Do you realize I ve been in town a 
                    whole week and we haven't even gone 
                    shopping?

                                  ALEXIS
                    We re going shopping on Saturday. 
                    When I don t have school.

                                  MEREDITH
                    But Bendel s is having its sale now.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Why bother learning math if you 
                    don't get to apply it in real-life 
                      situations? Like calculating your 
                    savings!

                    Come on, what s the harm? Unless 
                    you really want to go back and tell 
                    Mr. Simmons that your mother s a 
                    liar...

      Alexis gives in.

                                  ALEXIS
                    Fine. But promise we re not leaving 
                    the city.


      Castle and Beckett emerge from a stairwell.

                                  CASTLE
                    Wasn t really expecting a doorman 
                    building. But a six flight walk-up?

                                    BECKETT
                    Should ve seen my first apartment. 
                    Three flights up, on an airshaft 
                    over a restaurant. Whole place 
                    smelled like chicken wings.

      Clothes dry on clotheslines. A LARGE PIGEON COOP holds a 
      number of cooing birds. Worn LAWN FURNITURE and a small 
      HIBACHI. Are the pigeons a hobby or dinner?

                                  CASTLE
                    They come here looking for a fresh 
                    start and this is what they get. 
                    Slum housing in Williamsburg.

                                    BECKETT
                    Still, for a lot of them, it s 
                    better than what they left.

      They reach the closed door. From inside we HEAR muffled 
      voices. MUSIC. They share a look.

                                  CASTLE
                    Looks like Jamal didn t live alone. 

      Beckett knocks. No answer. A beat. Then she knocks louder. We 
      hear people talking in a foreign tongue and then the music 
      lowers. A beat later, the DOOR OPENS, revealing a big AFRICAN 
      MAN in his 20s. TWO OTHER MEN of similar ethnicity are behind 
      him inside the apartment.      CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  20.


                                    AFRICAN MAN
                    Yes?

                                    BECKETT
                          (badges him)
                    Detective Beckett. NYPD. 

      The men start yelling to each other. The African Man tries to 
      slam the door on her, but Beckett shoves her foot in between 
      the door and the jamb. 

                                    BECKETT (CONT D)
                    Oh no, you don t.

      She shoulders the door open and bursts in...


      Ryan and Esposito walk past busy stalls on Canal Street. 
        Everything s on sale. Tables are stacked with counterfeit 
      goods, including handbags. 

                                  ESPOSITO
                    All my years on the force, I never 
                      understood why we don t shut these 
                    guys down.

                                  RYAN
                    C mere. 

      Ryan grabs a purse and shows it to Esposito. 

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    See? This one s supposed to be a 
                    Louis Vuitton. But if you look 
                    close, instead of an  LV,  the 
                    initials say  EV. 

      Esposito studies the bag.

                                  ESPOSITO
                    That s pretty close.

                                  RYAN
                    But not exact. And that s what 
                    keeps these guys from getting 
                    busted. See, technically, it s not 
                    an imitation. It s an homage.

                                  ESPOSITO
                    An homage.

      Beckett and Castle arrive.

                                  CASTLE
                    You ladies picking out something 
                    pretty for yourselves?

      Esposito puts down the purse.

                                    BECKETT
                    You got the warrant?

                                  ESPOSITO
                    Yeah. Which one is it?

      Beckett indicates a shuttered stall nearby.

      TIME LAPSE       CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  32.


      CLOSE ON: BOLT CUTTERS 

      Esposito pops the lock on the shuttered stall. Beckett pulls 
      out her weapon and looks at her guys.

                                    BECKETT
                    Stay sharp. This guy s already 
                    killed twice. 

      Ryan lifts the metal garage door and we reveal...


      UNIFORMS and CSUs work through Oni s stall. Castle and 
      Beckett look at the shredded Chanel purses.

                                    BECKETT
                    The linings have been cut out.
                          (thinking it through)
                    All of this stuff is imported, right? 
                      A knockoff would be a perfect 
                    delivery system for a smuggler.

                                  RYAN
                    Yeah, but what re they smuggling?

                                    BECKETT
                    The only guy who can tell us has 
                    been marked for death.

      Esposito s eyes fall on the death symbol.

                    If he is alive, he doesn t have 
                    much incentive to stick around.

                    the sketch and have them put Oni s

      She turns back to Castle, but he s gone. She looks around to 
      see that he s wandering away...

                                    BECKETT (CONT D)
                    Castle?

      As Castle crosses into the street, he waves his hands. 
      Beckett follows, thrown by Castle s odd behavior.

                                    BECKETT (CONT D)
                    Castle? What are you doing?

      Castle heads to a store across the way: O&H DISCOUNT 
        ELECTRONICS. In the window, a large, flat-screen TV. Castle 
      waves again.

      ANGLE ON THE TV:

      We see Castle waving to himself.

                                  CASTLE
                    I m on TV.      CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  34.


                                    BECKETT
                    Are you having a breakdown?

                                  CASTLE
                    Not a breakdown. A breakthrough. 
                    Wow. I really am ruggedly handsome.

                                    BECKETT
                    What do you mean  breakthrough ?

      He points at the television.

                                  CASTLE
                    Look behind me. 

      He steps aside, revealing... ONI S STALL across the way.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                    If that camera s recording... 

                                    BECKETT
                    ...we might be able to see who 
                    trashed the stall. 


      CLOSE ON: A SURVEILLANCE PHOTO OF THE MYSTERY MAN

      He appears to be in his late 30s, with the eyes of a shark 
      and a scar on his face. He stands at the counter of the store 
      wearing a surplus Army jacket...

      Esposito looks at the photo. 

                                  ESPOSITO
                    Yeah. He looks like the kind of guy 
                    who d paint death symbols on your 
                    floor.

                                  CASTLE
                    Here s what I don t get... Why did 
                    he buy the camera?

                                  RYAN
                     Cause he had the same idea we did.

                                  CASTLE
                    We wanted the camera because we 
                    were looking for him...

                                    BECKETT
                    But who s he looking for? 

      Esposito s cell phone rings. He answers.      CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  37.


                                  ESPOSITO
                    Esposito. Yeah?
                          (beat)
                    Really? When? No. Absolutely. Bring 
                    him in.

      Esposito hangs up the phone.

                                  ESPOSITO (CONT D)
                    TSA just pulled Charles Oni from a 
                    security line at JFK off our 
                    sketch. 

                                  RYAN
                    Good call, bro.

                                  CASTLE
                    Where was he going?

                                  ESPOSITO
                    Nigeria. Under the name Robert 
                    Burnett.

                                    BECKETT
                    So was Oni running because he 
                    killed, or because he was going to 
                    be killed?

                                  CASTLE
                    Or both.


      Run-down. Nearby, a TAC-TEAM unloads from the van. Guns are 
      checked, vests are donned. Beckett opens her trunk, and as 
      she reaches for her bulletproof vest, she notices a bag.

                                    BECKETT
                    Where did that come from?

                                  CASTLE
                    Sorry. That s mine.

      Castle pulls the bag out of the trunk.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                      I thought, given everything that s 
                    happened, I should be prepared. 

      And out of the bag, he pulls his own BULLETPROOF VEST. 

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                    Special order. And look...

      He points to the back. Where her vest says POLICE in big, 
      bold yellow letters, his says WRITER.

                                    BECKETT
                    Writer?

                                  CASTLE
                    Cool, huh?

                                    BECKETT
                    No. Not cool. You don t need a vest!      CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  42.


                                  CASTLE
                    If you shoot me, do I not bleed?

                                    BECKETT
                    You re not getting shot. You know 
                    why? Because you re not going to be 
                    anywhere remotely near gunfire. 
                    You re staying here.

                                  CASTLE
                    Yeah, we ve seen how that works.

      Beckett un-holsters her gun.

                                    BECKETT
                    Stay. Here. Don t do anything.

      As Beckett moves to the TAC-Team, where the COP in charge is 
      studying the photograph of Baylor. Beckett gives them hand 
      signals and they deploy, Ryan and Esposito following.

      A moment later, a vested Castle follows.


      Castle dials his cell. We hear a muffled,  Hello. 

                                  CASTLE
                    Alexis? What s wrong?

      INTERCUT AS NEEDED:      CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  43.



      Beckett, Esposito, and Ryan stare at Castle.

                                    BECKETT
                    What do you mean, you didn t get a 
                    license?

                                  ESPOSITO
                    What kind of a car was it?

                                  CASTLE
                    Big. An SUV, I think.

                                  ESPOSITO
                    You think...

                                  RYAN
                    How about the color?

      This one Castle knows.

                                  CASTLE
                    Black... Or was it dark blue.

      The three of them look at him. 

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                    Being a witness is harder than it 
                    looks. How do you guys ever get a 
                      conviction?

      Then, they all turn away and walk back into the warehouse.

                    You know, I m usually great with 
                    the detail stuff. I was distracted.
