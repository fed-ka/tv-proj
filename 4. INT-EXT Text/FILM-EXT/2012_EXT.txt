Space, infinite and empty.
But then, slowly all nine planets of our Solar System move
into frame and align.
The last of them is the giant, burning sphere of the sun.
Just as the sun enters frame, a solar storm of gigantic
proportion unfolds. The eruptions shoot thousands of miles
into the blackness of space.
FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP
Mozart's concerto filters from a jeep's stereo, fighting the
drumming sounds of the monsoon rain. PROF. FREDERIC WEST, 66,
listens to the music.
An Indian BOY playing by the roadside steers his wooden toy
ship across a puddle.
The Professor turns to his driver, pointing to the boy.
PROF. WEST
Watch out!
But it's too late. The jeep drives straight through the
puddle at full speed, sinking the boy's toy ship.
In the background, the jeep stops in front of a building. The
driver jumps out, leading the Professor towards its entrance.
The sign at the door reads: `Institute for Astrophysics -
University of New Delhi'.
2.
A major fund raising party is under way. The setting is
spectacular. A terrace overlooking the Washington Mall and
the Capitol Building.
ADRIAN HELMSLEY, 32, stands with a group of young POLITICAL
AIDES. He is the only African-American among them.
One of the aides spots CARL ANHEUSER, 58, White House Chief
of Staff, working the crowd.
POLITICAL AID #1
Look at Anheuser. Anyone would think he
was President. Did you hear, he wants
us to sign in and out like school boys?
ADRIAN
I still can't believe that Wilson chose
him of all people to run the White
House.
POLITICAL AID #2
Why not? Anheuser owns the Senate and
the Congress.
ADRIAN
Shame he's such a pompous ass.
ANHEUSER (O.S.)
Somebody mention my name?
Adrian turns to see Anheuser smiling.
ADRIAN
(SHOCKED)
Yes sir... No, sir.
ANHEUSER
Which one is it?
ADRIAN
We were talking about what a great
speech you gave tonight. Well done,
sir.
ANHEUSER
It's Helmsley, right? I'll remember
that.
Anheuser walks away with a dangerous smile.
POLITICAL AID #2
That guy scares the shit out of me.
At that moment Adrian's cell phone rings.

ADRIAN

Professor West?
PROF. WEST (O.S.)
I've been trying to reach you!
G8 Summit. Riot police control the unruly crowd with water
cannons.
We see PROTESTERS with Anti Globalization signs behind a
fence. A convoy of limousines is approaching a historic
building.
A huge Chinese military helicopter blasts through a majestic
mountain valley in Tibet. We are at the top of the world.
(CONTINUED)
7.
A Chinese COLONEL, wearing dark sun glasses, watches from the
chopper as the army forces the evacuation of the villages and
monasteries.
VOICE (O.S.)
(in Chinese)
You will have new houses, electricity
and running water...
Someone speaks on a megaphone in the village square as
villagers are evicted by soldiers and herded into trucks.
VOICE (O.S.)
... Some among you will even have the
chance to work for the glorious
People's Republic of China building the
biggest dam project in the world...
NENG PANG, a young monk, 18, is loaded into a truck together
with his PARENTS, both in their 60's.
Neng's older brother, LIN PANG, 25, is part of a huge crowd
of young men and women staying behind by a Tibetan school
building. He turns and yells after the truck.
LIN
I will send you money mother.
The Colonel with the dark glasses steps up, addressing the
masses.
COLONEL
Who can read and write?
Eager hands fly up in the air. An official makes notes.
COLONEL (CONT'D)
Who can weld?
Lin's hand shoots up in the air. We hear a siren echoing
through the mountains and suddenly an explosion. Lin turns.
In the BACKGROUND, a series of explosions punch enormous
holes into the side of the mountain, showering rock
everywhere.

FADE UP
The phone call continues as Jackson opens the garage door,
struggling to pack his old SUV with camping equipment.
JACKSON
They're kids, Kate, going on vacation.
It's not a doctor's appointment... it's
supposed to be fun. You remember that,
right? Fun?
He tries to start the engine, but the battery is dead.
Frustrated, he hits the steering wheel.
11.
Jackson runs across the street with his camping equipment,
throwing it into the trunk of a stretch limo parked by the
curb.
JACKSON
... I know it's mosquito season at
Yellowstone, Kate. I'll pick some up on
the way.
He notices a deep crack in the asphalt. His neighbors, an
elderly couple, stand there and stare at it.
NEIGHBOR
Merrill, we should move back to
Wisconsin.
Jackson gets into the limo and speeds off.
Jackson stops and honks in front of an upscale Westwood home.
RADIO HOST (O.S.)
... If you have a funny `mini-quake'
story you wanna share, call Lisa &
Randy at 1-800...
Jackson switches the radio off. Two kids NOAH, 10, and LILLY,
7, come running down the driveway. They slow down, as they
see the limo.
NOAH
Jackson, what is this?
(CONTINUED)
12.
JACKSON
Don't call me Jackson, Noah, I'm your
father.
Lilly yells from inside the limo.
LILLY (O.S.)
Noah! Look! Daddy's got Space-Busters
in the car... and Space-Busters 2.
Awesome!
Their mother, KATE CURTIS, 32, a beautiful woman appears.
KATE
So what, you're a chauffeur now? What
happened to the temp work?
JACKSON
This is better hours for me. Means I
can still write.
KATE
Of course.
Kate's new boyfriend, GORDON SILBERMAN, 43, pulls out of the
garage in his Porsche wearing his Bluetooth.
GORDON
(on the phone)
Simone, how many times have I told you,
we don't do Lipo on Fridays. It's too
messy.
Jackson smiles bitterly. Gordon waves at the kids.
GORDON (CONT'D)
Have fun guys. And watch out for those
bears.
(to Jackson)
Nice car.
Jackson waves grudgingly as Gordon pulls away.
KATE
Noah needs to read twenty pages from
his book each day...
She follows Jackson to the car with a bag of pull-up diapers.
KATE (CONT'D)
... and Lilly has to put these on,
before she goes to sleep.
JACKSON
Still?
(CONTINUED)
13.
He shuts the trunk and gets back behind the wheel. She looks
at him seriously.
KATE
Jackson, they've been really looking
forward to this you know. Don't let
them down.
He nods as the car pulls away.
CUT TO:
HARRY HELMSLEY, 73, and his partner TONY DELGADO, 68, board
an enormous cruise ship, the `Freedom of the Seas'. Harry is
African-American, Tony is Italian. He carries a large case.
They pass a poster: `Jazz Night with Harry Helmsley & Tony
Delgado'.
HARRY
So this time we'll hit the Japs.
TONY
So what?
HARRY
Well Tony, electronics are cheap there
and... you could visit your boy Will.
TONY
Afternoon ladies...
TONY shoots a charmers smile at a couple of older single
ladies on sun loungers. They smile back coyly.
HARRY
Are you even listening to me?
TONY
Yes unfortunately I am Harry.
HARRY
I heard from Audrey you're a grandpa
now.
TONY
Why don't you keep your nose out of my
family. You're cramping my style.
HARRY
He married a Japanese girl - how is
that the end of the world? You should
at least go see him.
(CONTINUED)
14.
TONY
Why? Do you see your boy?
HARRY
Not as much as I'd like. DC is a long
way. But at least we talk.
TONY
What about?
HARRY
Life, how short it is...
Suddenly they're thrown off balance by a large swell that
pulls the massive `Freedom of the Seas' away from the
landing, about ten yards.
The next moment, the ship slams back against the dock with an
earthshaking BOOM.
TONY
What the hell was that?
A murmur goes through the crowd. Luckily nobody is injured.
CUT TO:
Picard is speeding in his Peugeot, anxiously checking his
rear view mirror.
MANFRED PICARD
I had my suspicions. I should have said
something. They are following me.
LAURA (O.S.)
Who is?
MANFRED PICARD
They may be listening to us too. Laura
the Heritage Foundation is a sham.
(CONTINUED)
15.
Picard's car approaches a tunnel.
LAURA (O.S.)
What?
MANFRED
The art you collected, it's not in the
Alps.
The Peugeot enters a tunnel.
LAURA (O.S.)
Then where is it?
A huge blast rips through the tunnel as his car explodes.
SMASH CUT TO:
JACKSON AND LILLY
(singing along to the
RADIO)
`We all live in a Yellow Submarine...'
They're driving through the glorious landscape of Yellowstone
National Park. Noah sits in the back with headphones on
playing Space-Busters 2.
As they pass over a ridge, the music station is overpowered
by a talk show filtering through. We hear a raspy and
excitable voice.
RADIO HOST
... After what is going on in La-La-
land with all those surface cracks, I
told myself: Get your stupid ass to
Yellowstone. I don't want to miss all
the great fun, when it finally blows...
Lilly reaches for the dial of the radio.
LILLY
What happened to the music?
JACKSON
Hang on, sweet pea, let daddy listen to
this for a moment...
Jackson corrects the dial to get better reception.
RADIO HOST
... There's been government people
flying in and out all morning. And
trust me, they did not look happy...
(CONTINUED)
16.
A huge black helicopter brushes over the limo.
RADIO HOST (CONT'D)
... Folks, always remember, you heard
it first from Charlie.
They watch in awe as the chopper disappears behind a ridge.
CUT TO:
A dense forest trail. We hear Lilly before we see her.
LILLY (O.S.)
Daddy, where are we going?
JACKSON
To a very special place, Lil'bee. It's
a lake. A place where mommy and daddy
fell in love.
(winking to Noah)
Remember the book I gave you?
NOAH
I don't want to know where you and mom
had sex. I'm not ready for that,
Jackson.
JACKSON
I'm your dad, Noah.
LILLY (O.S.)
Daddy!
Jackson runs to catch up with Lilly who has reached a fence
with a `keep out' sign posted.
JACKSON
This wasn't here before.
Jackson starts to climb the fence.
NOAH
Don't you see the signs?
JACKSON
It's fine guys.
Jackson and his kids crest a ridge. They look down on a
parched basin with cracked terrain.
(CONTINUED)
18.
JACKSON
It's gone. The whole darn lake is gone.
I swear you guys there was a lake here.
The kids roll their eyes.
A puddle of water is all that remains of the lake. Jackson
and the kids walk into the basin, unaware of being watched
THROUGH BINOCULARS.
Jackson spots an electronic measuring device and crouches to
have a closer look.
Elsewhere in the lake bed, we see sand seeping through CRACKS
in the ground.
NOAH (O.S.)
Jackson!
When he looks up, he sees heavily armed soldiers coming
towards them from all sides.
JACKSON
It's okay, Noh'.
Through the BINOCULARS, we see Jackson and his kids arrested
and led over a ridge.
With this we reveal an ENORMOUS RESEARCH FACILITY with
hundreds of tents and vehicles surrounding a massive drilling
tower.
Adrian Helmsley and Prof. West exit the drilling tower, both
studying papers. Adrian notices Jackson and his kids nearby,
being interrogated by an OFFICER.
ADRIAN
I'll be with you in a second,
Professor.
Adrian walks towards them. Jackson stares at the officer with
defiance.
OFFICER
... And then you climbed over a posted
fence? Just like that?
NOAH
I told you.
(CONTINUED)
19.
JACKSON
Isn't this supposed to be a National
Park? There shouldn't be fences. What
are you guys doing around here anyway?
ADRIAN (O.S.)
We're geologists...
Jackson turns and sees Adrian standing there.
ADRIAN (CONT'D)
I'll handle this officer. Thank you.
The officer reluctantly hands him Jackson's license.
JACKSON
So, where did the lake go?
ADRIAN
That's what we're trying to find out.
We think this whole area has become
potentially unstable. I would advise
you to take your kids and leave, Mr...
He throws a look at Jackson's drivers license.
ADRIAN (CONT'D)
... Curtis.
He looks up at Jackson with renewed interest.
ADRIAN (CONT'D)
Are you by any chance the Jackson
Curtis, the author of `Farewell
Atlantis'?
JACKSON
(SURPRISED)
Yeah, that's me.
Jackson straightens up proudly. Lilly smiles.
ADRIAN
What a coincidence. I'm reading your
book, as we speak... first third,
around day 300, when the shuttle loses
communication with earth and drifts off
into space.
JACKSON
You're one of lucky 422 who bought it.
ADRIAN
Actually I didn't buy it. My father
gave it to me.
(CONTINUED)
20.
JACKSON
Oh, I see.
Prof. West waves at Adrian from one of the container labs.
Adrian hands back Jackson his drivers license.
ADRIAN
Officer, can you return them to the
campgrounds, please.
(to Jackson)
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Curtis.
Jackson and his kids look after Adrian hurrying away.
LILLY
He was very nice.
JACKSON
Yes he was, Lil'bee.
Jackson and the kids walk back to the campgrounds when
suddenly CHARLIE FROST, 62, a crazy looking guy with
binoculars around his neck, stands in their way.
CHARLIE FROST
What did the government guys tell you?
Jackson looks at him, instinctively picking up Lilly.
JACKSON
They think it's not such a good idea to
climb over their fences. They feel the
area is unstable.
Charlie bursts out laughing.
CHARLIE FROST
Unstable! Ha-ha! They say its unstable!
That's funny...
With this he turns around and leaves.
Jackson is sitting on a camp chair, right outside the tent.
He's on his laptop, looking enquiringly at an aerial picture
of Yellowstone on Google earth.
In the background we see the kids are in the tent.
(CONTINUED)
21.
NOAH
There are mosquitos in here. Did
anybody spray the tent?
Jackson looks up, remembering he forgot the spray.
JACKSON
We'll get some of that tomorrow. For
tonight just put your head under the
blankie.
LILLY
Daddy you said you weren't gonna work
on your book.
JACKSON
I'm not Honey, I promise. Are you
wearing your pull-ups?
Lilly nods as Jackson walks over and tucks her into bed. He
kisses her good night. He turns and is surprised to see Noah
typing a text on his cell phone.
JACKSON (CONT'D)
Did mommy buy you that?
NOAH
No... Gordon gave it to me for my
birthday.
Jackson takes the phone from out of Noah's hands.
JACKSON
Noah. Things like a cell phone have to
be discussed in the family.
NOAH
(BITTER)
What family?
Jackson reads the message Noah has typed `Hey Gordon, Camping
Sucks!'. Hurt, Jackson hands back the phone.
JACKSON
Go to sleep guys.
Commotion. The base packs up. Adrian and Prof. West duck low
as they board a chopper. Adrian is on the phone.
ADRIAN
... You have to immediately inform the
President, Mr Anheuser. The readings
look much worse than I expected.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
22.
ADRIAN (CONT'D)
Plus Satnam's neutrino figures from
India confirm...
We hear Anheuser, yelling.
ANHEUSER (O.S.)
... But you guys said...
ADRIAN
We were wrong! By five or six months...
A second later the chopper lifts off.
Westwood. The parking lot of Gelson's is nearly empty.
Eerie silence. Suddenly some of the cars begin to shift in
place from an unseen force. A small CRACK creases the asphalt
and slowly crawls towards the brightly lit supermarket.
Jackson has driven all night. The sun rises, a giant glowing
orb.
PUBLIC RADIO NEWS (O.S.)
... Caltech believes that the incident
in the Westwood supermarket has
released most of the surface tension...
Jackson pulls up. The kids are asleep.
PUBLIC RADIO NEWS (O.S.)
... It looks like life in the city will
soon be back to normal, Mayor Gonzales
said at an early morning news
conference from his home in Hancock
Park.
Jackson switches off the radio and wakes his kids gently.
JACKSON
Lilly, we're home sweetie.
(to Noah)
Wake up big man.
(CONTINUED)
33.
Kate heads to the car. Still sleepy, the kids grab their
stuff and run into her arms.
KATE
Oh honey, I'm so glad you're back...
And you too, darling.
JACKSON
We tried calling but -
LILLY (O.S.)
I'm hungry Mummy.
KATE
At least it looks like the Mosquitos
ate well.
She looks at Jackson and softens.
KATE (CONT'D)
Wanna come in?
Gordon appears at the door. Jackson watches painfully as Noah
runs and gives Gordon a big hug.
His cellphone beeps with a message.
YURI (O.S.)
Where are you Curtis?
While talking to Yuri, Jackson is standing in front of the
open trunk, changing into his chauffeur suit.
YURI (O.S.)
Curtis, make sure you get my boys as
fast you can.
A palatial home. Completely gaudy. The twins, ALEC and OLEG,
wait impatiently. They are 12 years old and wear identical
clothing by Dior.
ALEC
Curtis, you are late.
Jackson ignores him and starts throwing the luggage into the
limo. The other twin notices his muddy sneakers.
OLEG
Careful with our stuff. Don't get it
dirty.
Ahead of the limo a crowd has formed in the streets, singing
songs and chanting about the end of days. A SKINNY MAN with a
ponytail preaches from the scriptures.
PREACHER
... There will be famines, pestilences
and earthquakes, sayeth the Lord.
Jackson has to maneuver through the people. Banners read:
`Prepare for the End'-- 'You cannot escape his judgement'--
Alec looks up from his video game, annoyed.
ALEC
Curtis, can't you go faster?
JACKSON
Are you guys blind? I can't run people
over.
OLEG
Why not? They're idiots anyway.
Jackson shoots these spoilt brats an angry look.
35.
Jackson stops in front of the Gulfstream. SASHA, 40, Yuri's
Russian pilot is expecting them.
SASHA
Hey Jackson. Took you a while...
Jackson mutters under his breath as he unloads the luggage,
dropping one of them on Alec's foot on purpose.
ALEC
Ouch! Be more careful!
The other twin has noticed Jackson's intensions. He gets into
his face.
OLEG
Now you're laughing, Curtis. But we are
going on a big ship.
(PAUSE)
We will live... and you will die.
Oleg grins back at Jackson as the jet door closes. The
Gulfstream taxis onto the runway.
As Jackson turns back to the car a fine surface crack shoots
across the tarmac. We hold on his face as it hits him like a
ton of bricks:
THE CRAZY RADIO HOST, CHARLIE FROST WAS RIGHT!
Frantically Jackson looks around and spots a MAN in overalls
working on a twin engine Cessna. He runs to him.
JACKSON
Where can I rent a plane?
The man points to a shabby office building.
CUT TO:
Jackson drives like crazy.
JACKSON
... Kate, we have to get out of LA!
I've rented a plane for us. Get the
kids ready! I'll be there in five.
KATE
The kids have plans today...
JACKSON
Are you kidding me!
KATE
No I'm not! Noah has music at 2 and
Lil' has Karate.
Gordon rolls his eyes and mutters.
GORDON
Not that we'd expect him to remember.
JACKSON
(SCREAMING)
California is going down! Pack up the
kids!
KATE
You're crazy! The Governor just said
we're fine now.
JACKSON
The Governor's a meathead, how would he
know anything? Kate listen! You gotta
trust me over some politician. Come on.
Jackson flies into the driveway and runs into the house.
As they storm out of their front door the house crumbles
behind them.
JACKSON
Get in the car!
The whole street starts to buckle. Left and right the houses
are shaken and smashed like toys.
(CONTINUED)
38.
Just before the wave of destruction can reach them, Jackson
tears out of the driveway.
Jackson maneuver's the limo through the crumbling
neighborhood. Right in front of their eyes, streets
disappear, trees fall, electrical lines snap. Sewer pipes
burst in front of the car.
NOAH
Holy shit!
Jackson has to turn on the windshield wipers.
The limo crashes through a gate onto the tarmac, coming to a
stop in front of a twin engine Cessna.
JACKSON
Damn it! Where's the pilot?
Kate turns to Gordon.
KATE
Gordon, you know how to fly.
GORDON
I... had a couple lessons...
JACKSON
Did you cover taking off?
GORDON
Yeah.
JACKSON
That's good enough for me.
They start running, when Jackson remembers something and
heads back to the Limo.
He grabs his knapsack from the front seat fumbling to zip his
laptop back inside it. Kate shouts.
KATE (O.S.)
Jackson, what are you doing?
JACKSON
I'm coming.
He jumps out of the car and races back after them. Behind
Jackson the hangar starts to disintegrate.
(CONTINUED)
39.
IN THE DISTANCE
A gigantic fissure forms in the earth, shooting towards Santa
Monica airport.
Gordon fumbles with the controls, Jackson yells from the
copilot seat.
JACKSON (CONT'D)
Come on, come on...
GORDON
(pointing at the
INSTRUMENTS)
But I'm supposed to check all these
first...
Jackson reaches over and slams Gordon's hand down and the
plane lurches forward.
As the Cessna speeds onto the tarmac the control tower goes
down and explodes.
Noah discovers the giant crevasse forming behind them.
NOAH
Guys, behind us!
As the plane accelerates, the giant crack closes in on them.
Gordon's hand trembles on the throttle control. Everybody
screams on top of each other.
EVERYBODY
Gordon! Damn it! Lift off!
Gordon gathers his courage and pulls the lever. The plane
almost rockets into the air just as the ground beneath them
gives way.
They hover for a moment, almost caught in mid-air as the
widening crevasse beneath them fights to suck them into the
bowels of the earth. Gordon fights to maintain control but
they begin to be pulled down.
The daylight vanishes. Debris and mud smashes into the plane
from all sides. The canyon walls erupt.
GORDON
I can't get it up!
Taking desperate measures, Gordon nearly rips the control
stick out of its joint - with a lurch the Cessna lifts out of
the abyss.
(CONTINUED)
40.
They all take a deep breath only to realize that now they are
flying directly into the collapsing towers of downtown Los
Angeles!
Like a roller coaster, Gordon manages to weave the little
plane through the tumbling high rises.
They dive one last time to evade the plummeting US BANK
TOWER, the tallest building on the west coast.
All are dead silent as they watch the whole of Los Angeles
crumble beneath them. Kate covers Lilly's eyes.
NOAH
(in total shock)
That was amazing, Gordon!
Jackson looks at Kate and notices her cut.
JACKSON
Are you okay?
KATE
(brushing it off)
I'm fine. How did you know this was
gonna happen?
JACKSON
I didn't.
(To Gordon)
Do we have enough fuel to make it to
Yellowstone?
The plane veers off in a northeasterly direction. Behind them
the destruction of Los Angeles continues.
CUT TO:
The gigantic cruise ship plows through the Pacific. We hear
lounge music...
The base is abandoned but for a few structures and the
enormous drilling tower.
Gordon manages to land the plane next to what looks like a
fueling station. Jackson leaps out checking the pump.
JACKSON
Guys, there's fuel! Fill her up and
I'll look for Charlie.
KATE
You're sure about this?
JACKSON
Kate, everything this guy said so far
has happened. I'll be right back.
Jackson runs off towards the hills.
LILLY
Daddy wait! I wanna come with you!
Lilly runs after him. Jackson picks her up.
KATE
Lilly! Come back!
JACKSON
It's fine! I'll take her.
Kate watches as they disappear, worried. Noah and Gordon have
started to fuel the plane.
45.
Jackson and Lilly find Charlie's RV with it's door hanging
open. They enter. The key is in the ignition. The radio
transmitters are on, but Charlie is gone. Jackson fiddles
with the switches and Charlie's voice comes on.
CHARLIE'S VOICE
... I am standing here at the highest
point on what is the rim of this super
volcano...
JACKSON
He's got to be close by, Lil'bee...
Jackson jumps behind the wheel and turns the ignition.
LILLY
Let's go back, Daddy.
JACKSON
Listen to me. We have to find Charlie.
He's got a secret map, you know, like
Jack Sparrow in `Pirates'.
That catches her interest.
JACKSON (CONT'D)
Lil', we have to work as a team now,
okay? You have to help me.
Jackson passes her his mobile phone. Lilly nods. He throws
the RV into gear and they speed off over the bumpy terrain.
In their dust, we see the earth fissuring!
Kate's phone rings.
(CONTINUED)
46.
LILLY
(O.S.)
Hi mommy...
KATE
Where are you, honey!?
Kate tries to keep it together for Lilly.
KATE
Let me speak to your daddy, darling.
LILLY (O.S.)
Daddy can't talk right now, he's
driving really fast...
Charlie has his broadcasting equipment strapped to his body.
The antenna's flag is whipping in the wind.
CHARLIE FROST
(into his mic)
... I wish you guys at home could see
this on TV...
He notices Jackson and muffles the microphone.
CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)
How did you make it up here? Thought
you were toast.
JACKSON
The spaceships Charlie, where are they?
CHARLIE FROST
You can't make it there.
(CONTINUED)
48.
JACKSON
We have a plane. We can get you out of
here too. Let's go Charlie!
All around the landscape begins to collapse. A three mile
crater forms, revealing the awe-inspiring sight of the super-
volcano.
CHARLIE FROST
You'll never make it out in time. Just
stay and enjoy the big bang. That your
kid?
Jackson discovers Lilly standing behind him, staring at
Charlie with her big brown eyes.
Jackson grabs Charlie lifting him off the ground.
JACKSON
Where is that god damn map!
CHARLIE FROST
Easy, easy. Watch the mic... I don't
know. Somewhere in my camper.
A low rumble builds to a rapturous thunder as MILLIONS OF
BIRDS tear into flight.
CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)
Wow! Look at that!...
(into his mic)
Fly birdies fly! This marks the last
day of the United States of America
folks and by tomorrow...
The mouth of the volcano starts to break apart revealing
molten lava underneath.
CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)
... the last of mankind. Soon they'll
see us from a million miles away, out
there in the milky way...
Jackson grabs his wide eyed daughter and races down the
mountain.
Jackson and Lilly jump into the RV and races off, with
Charlie's broadcast still playing.
CHARLIE'S VOICE
... The ash cloud will travel
everywhere.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
49.
CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
First the lights will go out in Vegas,
then Dallas, St. Louis and then
Washington DC...
Jackson's cell phone rings and he picks up.
JACKSON
We're on our way.
KATE
Jackson, things are really looking bad
here!
In that instant, the air around them vanishes, as if sucked
from the landscape into a vacuum.
THE BIGGEST EXPLOSION THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN... At least in
the last 640,000 years.
To them, all this occurs in total silence. The sound of the
eruption has not reached them yet.
They are frozen, unable to comprehend what is happening.
The explosion begins to resembles an atomic mushroom.
CHARLIE FROST
... it's beautiful, kids! Just
beautiful!
The sound waves reach Charlie, throwing him to the ground.
The RV flies over the rugged terrain. Everywhere the earth is
cracking, falling apart. Jackson struggles to swerve around
the disappearing landscape.
LILLY
(SCREAMING)
It's following us!
Lilly has discovered the expanding ASH CLOUD behind them.
JACKSON
Just don't look back, Lil'bee!
The THUNDERING sound envelopes them! On the radio, the voice
of Charlie is getting shrill.
(CONTINUED)
50.
CHARLIE'S VOICE
Majestic!... Oh yeah!
Charlie slowly tries to stand again, silhouetted against the
cloud of dust and fire towering above him.
Flaming rocks fly towards him. When they hit the ground, they
detonate like fire bombs.
CHARLIE'S VOICE
Oh baby! It's coming!
Rocks plummet like comets around the RV as Jackson races over
a collapsing bridge. On the radio, in his delirious state,
Charlie begins to sing...
CHARLIE'S VOICE
`This is the end, my friend'...
Yellowstone looks like a war zone. The RV dodges the
bombardment of fire and rock.
Huge tree trunks and glowing boulders fly at Charlie through
the ashes. He screams at the top of his lungs.
CHARLIE FROST
... Folks, always remember, you heard
it first from Charlie.
A second later, Charlie's radio antenna comes spinning like a
scythe through the air. It decapitates Charlie in an instant.
The radio cuts out. The forest and the camp grounds are mown
flat by the extreme force of the ASH CLOUD. In the rear view
mirror Jackson sees it gaining on them.
JACKSON
LILLY! DOWN!
A firebomb hits the RV, ripping half the roof off.
Lilly barely makes it under the dashboard.
(CONTINUED)
51.
JACKSON (CONT'D)
Stay down there, Lil'! We're almost
there! Just keep looking at daddy.
Jackson spots the little Cessna in the distance.
At the entrance to the airstrip a huge crevasse forms,
cutting the RV off from reaching the plane.
Lilly sticks out her head.
LILLY
Mommy!
Jackson swerves wildly to miss the crack, sending Lilly
flying out. Without thinking, he lets go of the wheel,
lunging after her and pulling her back inside.
JACKSON
Stay down darling.
Jackson races the RV alongside the forming crack.
Spotting a narrow point in the crevasse, he makes a decision.
Slamming the accelerator down, he races towards it at full
speed.
Moments later the RV is airborne!
Kate watches, too shocked to scream. A few drawn out seconds.
Then the RV touches down, crashing 200 feet from the plane.
Kate runs towards the wreckage of the camper. Lilly jumps
out, racing into her mom's arms. Jackson turns and sees the
cloud approaching.
JACKSON (CONT'D)
You guys go! I'll be right there!
Kate pulls Lilly back to the plane.
Jackson jumps into the back of the RV scavenging through the
shelves, looking for Charlie's map.
Kate lifts Lilly onto the wing of the plane. Gordon revs up
the engines.
NOAH
Give me your hand, Lil'.
Noah pulls his little sister into the cockpit.
(CONTINUED)
52.
Fiery rocks rain from the sky, detonating to the right and
left of their plane as Kate climbs in.
GORDON
We have to take off!
NOAH
No!
LILLY
Where's daddy?!
GORDON
Kate, I'm sorry but if we wait we'll
all die!
Gordon pushes the throttle. The plane starts to move. Kate
screams.
KATE
Gordon! Wait!
Back in the RV, Jackson is frantically going through the
masses of books and papers on the shelves. Finally, a map. He
unfolds it. But it's only of the London underground system.
He throws it to the ground and finds another. This time he's
lucky! There are markings everywhere.
As he races to the door, the ground gives way beneath the RV.
Kate and the kids watch it disappear from sight.
KATE (CONT'D)
JACKSON! NO!
Noah begins to cry and Lilly clings to her mom. Gordon just
stares, paralyzed.
The ASH CLOUD is almost upon them!
Gordon takes action and accelerates the plane.
Kate turns back. A hand emerges from the crevasse. Then
another, holding a map. Her face lights up.
LILLY
It's daddy!
Jackson pulls himself up and sprints towards them, the map in
his hand.
KATE
Jackson! Here!
Kate leans out of the cockpit reaching for him.
(CONTINUED)
53.
NOAH
Faster Dad. You can make it!
GORDON
Kate, grab him for god sake. We're
almost out of runway.
Using every last ounce of energy, Jackson leaps onto the wing
and is yanked into the plane by Kate.
Just at that moment, the plane lifts off.
Jackson falls into the cockpit, completely out of breath.
Lilly crawls over and hugs him.
JACKSON
Thanks for waiting guys.
Now all eyes are glued to the speedometer. 180... 190...
The violent ASH CLOUD is hitting their tail rudder. The plane
swerves wildly! Gordon gets it back under control.
The speedometer finally creeps towards 200 mph and the CLOUD
slowly falls back. Everybody breathes a sigh of relief.
KATE
So, now that you got your map, where
are we going?
Jackson unfolds it and takes a look. Hundreds of markings
clutter the map. In the left corner he discovers a large
letter C followed by H - I - N - A.
He looks up.
JACKSON
We're gonna need a bigger plane.
CUT TO:
Most of Las Vegas is destroyed. A 200 foot wide canyon now
divides sin city along its famous strip. The towering casinos
still teeter along the canyon's rim.
All forms of emergency rescue operations are deployed around
the city.
In the FOREGROUND, we see Las Vegas International Airport,
its runway cut dramatically short. Large pieces of tarmac
continue to break off into the crevasse.
Gordon maneuvers his plane through the chaos. Airplanes are
strewn about the runway. Passengers everywhere.
GORDON
I told you we should have gone to my
parents' in the Rockies.
KATE
Gordon's right. Look at this mess.
Jackson looks around frantically.
JACKSON
You don't understand, it's our only
chance.
(CONTINUED)
57.
GORDON
This isn't one of your crazy stories
now. How the hell are we gonna make it
to China?
NOAH
Gordon, without Jackson, we'd never
have made it out of California.
Silence. Noah is right and they know it. They taxi past a
private jet whose front wheel is stuck in a hole in the
tarmac.
We hear a dog barking and the CAMERA finds Tamara, with
Caesar in her arms.
YURI (O.S.)
Careful with the landing gear!
(in Russian)
Tamara, get the boys out of the way!
An airport tow truck attempts to pull Yuri's Gulfstream jet
out. Sasha, the pilot, helps. A safety announcement echoes
through the whole area.
VOICE
(over loudspeaker)
Attention! The US National Guard has
informed us, that an extremely
hazardous ash cloud is headed towards
the city of Las Vegas.
Tamara looks scared and secretly reaches for Sasha's hand.
They share an intimate look, no one else sees.
VOICE (CONT'D)
We strongly advise every one to move
indoors immediately...
The tow truck driver panics and runs inside.
We move in on Yuri. For the first time he looks helpless.
In the background, Jackson and his family join the panicked
crowd heading towards the terminal building. Firemen and
rescue workers usher them forward.
FIRE MAN
Let's move people! Inside the terminal!
Jackson and his family are swept along.
CUT TO:
58.
They race around the corner and come to a halt. Before them,
a Russian freight plane of enormous size--
The ANTONOV 225, the biggest aircraft in the world.
NOAH
Wow, that is a big plane.
YURI
(PROUDLY)
It's Russian.
Sasha, who has run ahead turns back and sees:
A MASSIVE GREY WALL OF ASH moving towards the airport.
SASHA
Guys, follow me!
They all run after him up the stairs.
The nose of the Antonov turns onto the runway. This humongous
plane suddenly looks small against the wall of ash.
The Antonov steadily gains speed as it rumbles down the
cracked and uneven runway.
The canyon that has swallowed half the city looms ahead. And
behind them the volcanic cloud bears down.
The Antonov lumbers heavily towards the inevitable drop off
on the horizon. The runway is way too short...
And to make matters worse, the ground begins to move again,
slowly arching the tarmac upwards, creating a crooked ramp at
the end of it.
The Antonov is on a collision course with the crumbling
casino towers along the other side of the rim.
Very slowly the plane starts to rise and Sasha's face lights
up. They barely make it over a casino called `Paris; Las
Vegas'.
But the plane clips its wheels on a high metal structure
right behind it, ripping away part of the landing gear.
An ancient monastery built atop a solitary mountain rock. In
the distance, the sun glistens off the peaks of the
Himalayas.
NENG PANG, a young monk, 20, sits with his superior and
teacher LAMA YAK LA, 65. They have tea beneath a huge bronze
bell.
LAMA YAK LA
(in Chinese)
Do not believe in anything simply
because you have heard it, Neng.
NENG
But Lin is my brother. He is working
inside the big tunnels, where the ships
are made.
The Lama remains silent.
NENG (CONT'D)
What is in your wisdom for us to do,
great Lama... if Lin is right, if our
world is indeed coming to an end?
Instead of answering, the Lama serves him more tea.
When the cup is full, the Lama doesn't stop pouring. Neng
watches the tea overflow until he can no longer restrain
himself.
NENG (CONT'D)
It's full, great Lama. It can hold no
more!
The Lama stops pouring and looks at Neng.
LAMA YAK LA
Like this cup, Neng, you are full of
your own opinions and speculations. How
can I show you wisdom unless you first
empty your cup?
Neng bows his head in embarrassment.
The Lama smiles to himself and takes a chain from around his
neck. On it hangs a set of rusty car keys.
(CONTINUED)
66.
LAMA YAK LA (CONT'D)
Be careful with the clutch. It tends to
slide.
The Lama throws him the keys and the young monk catches them,
smiling from ear to ear. They bow to each other and Neng runs
off.
Lama Yak La looks after him as a father would. He gets up and
strikes the bronze bell with a wooden mallet.
As far as you can see is a series of identical little houses.
The house in the foreground has a chicken coop in the garden.
Mrs. Pang enters the coop. We last saw her when the village
was being evacuated. She grabs one of the hens. She places
its head on a woodblock and picks up a rusty hatchet.
Just about to strike, she hears a strange RATTLING noise.
An old truck comes driving towards the house. Behind the
wheel sits her son Neng. She puts down the hatchet, yelling.
MRS. PANG
(in Chinese)
Bata! Neng is coming!
The young monk jumps out, quickly bowing.
NENG
Mother, I got a message from Lin. He
wants us to meet him in Cho Ming, at
the west gate. He says he can get us on
one of the ships he is working on.
Mrs. Pang is still holding the chicken by its throat.
MRS. PANG
I thought Lin is working on the dam?
NENG
The dam is a ship, Mother. The
government lied to us. There will be a
big flood.
The chicken hangs limp in Mrs. Pang's hand.
MRS. PANG
Not here in the mountains... Let's eat
first.
The hen panics as she puts its head back on the block,
raising the hatchet again.
(CONTINUED)
67.
NENG
No mother! We must pack up right away.
NENG'S MOTHER
We took a trip with the Laem Song ferry
once. Your father was throwing up the
whole way.
The door opens and Mr. Pang appears.
MR. PANG
Neng, I did not know you were coming
for dinner.
At that moment the hatchet drops with a THUD!
CUT TO:
The majestic Antonov is flying high in the Pacific skies.
OLEG (O.S.)
Look, the new Bentley.
The Antonov dives into a thick layer of clouds.
SASHA (O.S.)
Still nothing from the tower?
From above we watch as the Antonov flies over an endless
ocean of fiery red lava. The Islands of Hawaii have turned
into one big volcano.
The damaged landing gear slowly retracts into the vast belly
of the Antonov as it veers off to the east.
CUT TO:
The cloud from the Yellowstone eruption has hit Washington
D.C. hard. Pennsylvania Avenue resembles a war zone. A ten
inch layer of ash lies on the ground.
The gates of the White House are wide open, with ash-covered
rescue workers running about, resembling ghosts.
74.
The President walks up to the Red Cross tents placed on the
front lawn. He stops one of the Red Cross volunteers.
PRESIDENT WILSON
Who can help me with missing persons?
Without looking up, the young guy responds.
RED CROSS VOLUNTEER
Sorry man, I'm busy right now.
He then recognizes who he's talking to.
RED CROSS VOLUNTEER (CONT'D)
I mean, of course sir. I didn't
realize... What can I do for you, Mr.
President?
The President pats him on the shoulder.
(CONTINUED)
75.
PRESIDENT WILSON
Don't worry about it. You're doing a
great job son...
A deep, low rumble begins, stopping everybody in place.
As it builds, the President grabs onto a tent pole to secure
himself. He looks out over Washington D.C. His eyes grow
wide...
The National Mall bends like rubber. The towering Washington
Monument breaks into pieces.
An even more deafening sound makes him turn--
The Capitol Building rises from behind the trees, lifted up
by earth's incredible force.
As the whole building breaks apart, the President is thrown
to the ground.
CUT TO:
Pope Benedict XVI holds mass in St. Peter's Basilica.
Millions of followers flood Vatican City. It's a sea of
candles.
Amidst the mass of believers we see the Italian Prime
Minister Antonioni with his family clinging to him. They all
are praying.
A low RUMBLE. People look around frightened. In the distance
we hear SCREAMING.
The people in St. Peter's square begin to panic--
The entire Vatican is lifted up in the air. We hold on the
Prime Minister and his family, as the basilica collapses onto
the fleeing masses.
CUT TO:
The giant statue of `Christ the Redeemer' on Mount Corcovado.
Behind it, we see Rio de Janeiro being obliterated by violent
quakes.
(CONTINUED)
77.
The famous statue of Jesus Christ begins to topple over and
crashes down the mountain.
CUT TO:
Neng Pang, the young Tibetan monk drives his truck up a bumpy
mountain pass. His parents huddle in the back of the pick-up.
The steering wheel is vibrating badly in his hands as he
slides the clutch and downshifts. As the vehicle slows on the
steep incline, the vibrations become much worse. Neng worries
that the truck may be breaking down.
He pulls up and switches off the engine but to his surprise
the steering wheel continues to vibrate.
Looking out the windshield, he sees the whole earth shaking
violently.
NENG
(in Chinese)
Hold on back there!
Rocks fall all around them.
CUT TO:
On his back, Harry is shocked to see the star field and the
moon shifting across the sky.
An eerie sound fills the air. A gigantic swell has formed off
to his right. It's a mountain of water.
Harry turns to see another gargantuan swell close in from the
other side of the `Freedom of the Seas'.
CUT TO:
The old walled city of Shibam is in ruins. The 2,000-year-old
towers lie on the desert ground. Hundreds of believers have
gathered to pray towards Mecca.
As they raise their hands to heaven in unison, they slow
their motion and the chanting dissipates.
They stare into the distance not knowing if what they see is
reality or only a mirage.
A monstrous tidal wave rises from the desert sands thundering
towards them.
CUT TO:
President Wilson's body lays between the rubble. As he slowly
regains consciousness, all he can hear is the flapping sound
of the collapsed Red Cross tents.
(CONTINUED)
81.
As President Wilson gets to his feet, he sees--
A tidal wave come sweeping over the remains of the Washington
Mall and it carries with it the battleships of the 14th Fleet
of the US Navy that were anchored in Chesapeake Bay.
The President looks ahead, calm and peaceful.
PRESIDENT WILSON
I'm coming home Dorothy...
The CAMERA follows the aircraft carrier `USS John F. Kennedy'
as it slams broadside into the White House.
CUT TO:
The remaining two engines barely hold the plane in the air as
it dives into the clouds.
84.
As the snow settles we see that the glacier is scattered with
luxury cars tomb-stoned in the snow.
The Bentley is half buried. We hear Caesar barking.
JACKSON (O.S.)
Everybody okay back there?
KATE (O.S.)
We're all fine.
The door opens and Jackson climbs out, looking around. Just
above the wind, he hears the SOUND OF HELICOPTER BLADES.
One by one the others appear behind Jackson and stare at a
surreal sight--
Several Chinese Mil-26 choppers airlift animals over the
mountain pass.
GIRAFFES, ZEBRAS, EVEN ELEPHANTS hang by huge straps from
these flying machines.
One of the smaller helicopters veers from the transport fleet
and lands near the Bentley.
Armed soldiers jump out. Their Commander speaks to them in a
sharp tone.
CHINESE COMMANDER
Welcome to the People's Republic of
China.
Jackson nods to them.
JACKSON
Thank you...
(to Lilly and Noah)
Say thank you, kids.
The others acknowledge the soldiers as well. Hi... Hello...
CHINESE COMMANDER
What color are your passes?
Jackson stands dumbfounded. The Commander repeats.
CHINESE COMMANDER (CONT'D)
What color are your boarding passes?
Still no answer. He yells an order. The soldiers point their
guns at them.
(CONTINUED)
89.
YURI (O.S.)
I have green card.
Surprised, Jackson turns to Yuri who's holding up three green
plastic cards.
YURI (CONT'D)
For my boys and me.
Tamara can't believe what she's hearing.
TAMARA
It's a joke... a mistake...
(LAUGHING)
Right Yuri?
Yuri shrugs. Tamara lunges at him.
TAMARA (CONT'D)
(in Russian)
You disgust me. You pig.
Yuri brushes her off, coldly. And then speaks so they can all
understand him.
YURI
You think I did not know about you and
Sasha? May god rest that poor bastard's
soul.
With that Yuri turns to the others.
YURI (CONT'D)
I am sorry guys. Good luck. And Jackson
remember, if someone wants to beat
you... he has to kill you first. Come
boys!
The twins grab Caesar and climb into the helicopter. The dog
barks furiously, wanting to stay with Tamara.
The next moment, the helicopter takes off.
GORDON
What!... Did that just happen!?
They're stranded.
CUT TO:
Air Force One is in the background as Laura, Anheuser, and
other members of the crew are rushed towards a group of
waiting helicopters.
(CONTINUED)
90.
Adrian is a little way back in the middle of the pack. A
Chinese Officer with a list shouts over the noise.
CHINESE OFFICER
(POINTING)
Mr. Anheuser - you're in Chopper 1. Dr.
Wilson the same.
Laura and Anheuser reach the chopper. An authoritative Naval
Officer greets them, and raises his voice.
CAPTAIN MICHAELS
I'm Captain Richard Michaels. I'm the
skipper of the American boat sir. After
you!
Anheuser nods and climbs in the chopper. Captain Michaels
helps Laura in. Adrian arrives just as the Chopper door
slides shut and it lifts off.
The CAMERA follows the choppers revealing--
Nine gigantic oval gates that measure at least 60 stories,
built into the face of a mountain.
(CONTINUED)
91.
In front of every gate there is a line of huge `Y' shaped
metal support structures, which are the launching towers for
the ships. They are each at least 800 feet high. It's an
unparalleled feat of engineering.
The lead chopper descends onto a platform in front of one of
the gates, dwarfed against this majestic setting.
The door slides open and Anheuser jumps out. Laura follows.
She looks around in awe.
Even the utility entrances that lead into the mountain are
immense. The Captain guides them into the hollow mountain.
In the BACKGROUND we see an angry Yuri scream and argue with
military personnel, waving his tickets.
YURI
What do mean we can't board Number 4? I
want to speak to your supervisor.
SOLDIER
I am the supervisor! Now get in line
with all the others while we make
arrangements.
YURI
I want your name!
SOLDIER
(pointing to his
BADGE)
Can you read? Now get the hell back
with the other green cards, or I'll
have you detained.
The twins stand nearby, holding Caesar. They look afraid.
CUT TO:
Jackson and his group are small specks in a barren landscape.
They have made it down the glacier and are now walking over a
scree field.
It is hard going. Jackson carries Lilly.
JACKSON
Keep thinking warm thoughts sweetheart.
You're doing great.
(CONTINUED)
92.
Kate holds Noah by the hand. Gordon and Tamara trail behind.
She's still very upset.
TAMARA
I should have listened to you, Dr.
Silberman. I actually liked the way I
looked before that monster talked me
into it.
GORDON
Did you know he asked for a discount...
and he paid in installments?
TAMARA
Cheap bastard.
GORDON
You're better off without him. What he
said about you and Sasha, is it true?
Tamara nods silently.
TAMARA
Now that he's gone I think he was worth
a hundred times a man like Yuri.
Suddenly they hear the PUTTERING of an engine.
JACKSON
You guys hear that?
In the distance, an old rusty truck comes bumping down the
dirt road. Jackson puts down Lilly and chases after it.
Neng and his parents drive past, billowing a huge cloud of
dust just as Jackson reaches the road.
JACKSON
(out of breath)
Hey! Help! Wait for us!
But Neng doesn't hear him over the rattling truck. Jackson,
pissed, kicks at the rocks on the road.
JACKSON (CONT'D)
Shit! Shit!
Just then, Neng's mother, sitting in the back of the truck,
turns and sees his tantrum. She bangs on the rear window of
the cabin.
Neng looks in the mirror and hits the brakes. Jackson can't
believe his luck.
(CONTINUED)
93.
The others show up and they all run towards the truck.
CUT TO:
Thousands are on the march up the mountains. Behind them a
valley stretches into the horizon. Plumes of smoke rise from
destroyed cities in the distance.
(CONTINUED)
94.
Amongst the refugees, we discover Satnam, the young
astrophysicist, holding his little son. The rest of Satnam's
family trails behind.
Distant WARNING SIRENS pierce the silent march, coming from
the cities below.
People start to scream and run, but Satnam stands there
frozen. He fumbles for his satellite phone, then hits a
number on its speed dial.
Satnam swallows hard. He stares out into the valley.
SATNAM
I have to go!
A wall of undulating foam and debris comes rolling towards
him. A tidal wave of gigantic height.
Everybody panics and scratches for a higher elevation. But
for Satnam it is clear, they do not stand a chance.
(CONTINUED)
95.
He picks up his little son, squeezing him tightly to his
chest, humming an Indian lullaby for the scared child.
Neng's truck, loaded with Jackson and the others, creeps up
to the service entrance of the launch site.
A lone figure awaits them. This is Neng's older brother Lin,
who we saw signing up for the 'Chinese Dam Project'.
Lin notices the strangers in the pick-up truck.
(CONTINUED)
97.
LIN
(in Chinese)
Who are they?
Neng answers hesitantly.
NENG
We found them by the side of the road,
my brother.
LIN
You must send them back.
NENG
I am a follower of the great Lama Yak
La. You know I cannot do that.
The others watch the interaction but do not understand.
Jackson senses a problem. He grabs Lilly and Noah.
JACKSON
Come with daddy.
Gordon and Tamara stare perplexed as Jackson approaches Lin
with his kids.
JACKSON (CONT'D)
At least take our children with you.
Please.
Lin answers in broken English.
LIN
Why should I do that?
JACKSON
For the same reason you sent for your
parents.
Lin stares at him stone faced. In desperation, Kate turns to
Mrs. Pang.
KATE
I have no clue if you understand what
I'm saying, but I ask you as a mother,
please take my kids with you!
Silence. A beat. The old Chinese lady turns to Lin.
MRS. PANG
(in Chinese)
We are all children of this earth.
LIN
My plan will not work for so many,
mother.
(CONTINUED)
98.
She looks up at her son, determined.
MRS. PANG
We will take them all. Bata?
Mr. Pang nods and reluctantly, Lin motions to Jackson to
follow. Kate bows to Mrs. Pang.
KATE
Thank you ma'am. Thank you so much.
Jackson and the others acknowledge what Kate has done.
CUT TO:
Lin leads his group over a ridge. In front of their eyes--
The gates to the mountain open!
LIN
(in Chinese)
We have to hurry!
(to Jackson)
They launch! We run out of time!
They follow Lin rushing down the hill, towards one of the
many Y-shaped launch structures towering in front of the
gates. Neng and Kate help Mr. and Mrs. Pang down the rocky
terrain.
The three gigantic vessels emerge from the mountain, into the
open. Support helicopters swarm around them like flies.
Lin and his group look like ants as they scale the metal
ladders of one of the launch towers.
A hatch opens at the top of the launch tower. Lin is the
first to climb out.
Right before his eyes, the hull of the American Ship slowly
creeps towards him. He's but a speck against this man-made
behemoth.
Lin hastily pulls the others up.
LIN
(in Chinese)
Faster, Neng! Help father! Mother, give
me your hand.
It's a race against time. The huge ship's hull closes in
fast. Lin and his family crawl up the side arm while Jackson
hurries to pull up the rest of the group.
Lilly freezes at the sight of the approaching ship.
(CONTINUED)
101.
JACKSON
Move Lil'bee!
Jackson rips her out of harm's way, just in time. In a
frenzy, he pushes her up the support arm where the others are
already huddled on a small platform.
As the towering wall of steel passes by them, inches from
their faces, Mr. Pang loses his balance. Jackson and Lin both
see this, but Jackson is closer--
He grabs the old man by his arm, saving him from falling to
his death.
For the first time, Lin acknowledges Jackson with a nod.
The three completed ships are half way out, grinding to their
final launching position.
A mob of passengers led by Yuri has fought their way to the
ship. More and more people join them, including soldiers.
Lin, Jackson and the group are huddled on the platform.
The sound of SCREAMING PEOPLE makes them turn. The storming
masses have arrived at the access platform. There is now a
huge drop off between them and the tails of the ships.
TAMARA
(POINTING)
Oh my god, that's Yuri!
Next to Yuri are his twins, holding Caesar. She yells!
TAMARA (CONT'D)
Caesar!
The little dog hears Tamara and jumps out of Oleg's arms,
leaping onto one of the thick cables, that connects the
platform with the launching towers.
Alec and Oleg attempt to run after Caesar, but Yuri grabs
them by their necks.
YURI
Let that stupid dog go!
(CONTINUED)
102.
He's panicked. The arriving masses are pushing them to the
drop off at the edge of the platform.
The ship has reached its targeted position. A small hatch
lines up directly in front of Lin and his group.
LIN
(in Chinese)
Okay. Now!
One by one they all climb into the hatch. Jackson being the
last in, notices that Tamara has stayed back.
JACKSON
Tamara! Come on! Get in!
She doesn't move, anxiously waiting for her beloved dog
darting towards her.
The mob pushes at Yuri and his boys. Passengers on either
side tumble off the platform.
Yuri watches one of them fall, hitting his head against a
tiny ledge 8 feet below. To his right, he sees a small ladder
leading down.
YURI
(in Russian)
Down there! Oleg, you go first!
As they hurry down the ladder, people keep tumbling into the
deep. Reaching the ledge, Oleg discovers Caesar running
towards Tamara.
OLEG
Daddy look, Tamara!
Yuri cannot believe his eyes.
The hatch behind Tamara begins to move. The hydraulic
supports are being lifted, sealing up the vessel.
TAMARA
Caesar darling!
Jackson reaches out from the closing hatch.
(CONTINUED)
103.
JACKSON
Tamara! Get in!
Tamara climbs inside the hatch and turns.
TAMARA
Come to mommy!
Caesar leaps into her arms only seconds before the hatch
seals. As a last gesture, Tamara sticks out her arm and gives
Yuri the finger.
One by one the gigantic gates at the stern of the three ships
begin to creek open.
The masses gathered on the platform CHEER wildly!
Still on the ledge, Yuri and the boys watch as the huge
boarding gate lowers towards them. They are trapped.
Just then, the gates begin to slow, but surely they will be
crushed.
The gates of the ships hit the access platform with a
thundering noise. People begin to rush on board.
Lama Yak La rings the large bronze bell of his monastery.
(CONTINUED)
110.
The booming sound echoes through the Cho Ming valley. As a
gentle wind catches the Lama's clothes, he looks up--
A tidal wave of immeasurable proportion crests the mountains.
The Lama continues to strike the bell as the monastery is
wiped clean from the earth.
CUT TO:
Above Yuri and the boys, people are leaping from the access
platform onto the stern gate of the American ship.
Yuri looks for a hole in the flow of people before seizing
his chance and lifting the first of his boys up.
YURI
(in Russian)
Pull yourself up!
Oleg manages to reach up and hold onto the gate.
(CONTINUED)
111.
Inside the ship, officers yell.
DECK OFFICER (O.S.)
To the lower decks people!
The gates suddenly screech back into life and begin to close.
Yuri doubles his efforts lifting Alec higher, but Alec cannot
quite reach.
Yuri strains with all his effort before deciding.
YURI
Oleg! Catch your brother!
Yuri leaps forward holding Alec out in his arms.
Oleg manages to grab his brother's hands as Yuri lets go and
falls into the deep crevasse below. He makes no noise until
he hits the rocks beneath.
Oleg pulls his brother from above.
Further down in the valley, the tidal wave has reached the
Cho Ming airfield, blasting away the planes with overwhelming
force.
The massive propellers of the ships begin to turn. However,
the props of the American ship don't move.
In the background, the huge tidal wave comes thundering
towards them.
THE WAVE FINALLY HITS!
All three vessels are now engulfed in churning water.
They rock back and forth. Only the huge support towers
they're resting on, keep them anchored.
In the debris-filled, murky waters we see that the fuselage
of Air Force One has slammed against the first of the ship's
launch towers.
Slowly it begins to bend, finally giving way. The other
launch towers follow like dominos.
The ship is ripped from its anchorage and sent drifting
sideways, rudderless.
The vessel is swept away, over the mountain ridge.
The giant ship drifts upside down and rudderless - smashed
around by the debris and raging waters.
But then, as it hits another ridge, it rolls right side up
and seems to steady itself.
However, the strong currents continue to force it through the
mountain ranges of the Himalayas.
We hear a BOOMING sound as the tail gate finally seals.
The gigantic propellers fight against the current, hitting
rock at the base of the mountain.
The giant ship escapes the mountain with an inch to spare.
Hatches unseal all around the ship. Sun streams through the
clouds. Everywhere people emerge outside, into the light of
day. A majestic moment.
They all stare in awe at the waters receding against the ice-
covered mountain peaks. Caesar lets out a YELP of joy.
Almost as soon as the doors have opened, the ship's
HELICOPTERS take off, flying towards a stunning site--
The `Freedom of the Seas' is perched on a mountain peak,
surrounded by calm waters. Behind it, they see the most
beautiful rainbow. This is the new world.
And again we hear Mozart's Adagio...
