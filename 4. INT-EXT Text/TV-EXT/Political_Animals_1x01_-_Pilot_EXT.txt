The late afternoon sun casts its glow.  Elaine speaks.

Elaine practically collapses into his arms -- they begin 
to kiss.  At first slowly, then more passionately.



After hours.  But they open the zoo for the secretary 
when she likes to visit... or have a private meeting.  

Elaine sits quietly on a nearby bench, gazing at the 
MASSIVE CREATURES.  Clark, as always, stands his usual 
distance away.  After a moment, SUSAN BERG appears -- she

fault.  I inadvertently leaked it...  I

to women because you stayed with your 
husband.  Like most, I thought it was 
because of your political ambitions.  
Then I went to pack tonight... and it was 
the hardest thing I ever had to do. 

A slight beat where Elaine decides to reveal --

ELAINE
I stayed because I loved him.

SUSAN
I know... so why did you finally leave?

ELAINE

moment, exhausted from the campaign, 
suffering the greatest professional 
setback of my life -- I finally had the

view.  As they DRIVE OFF, we CRANE UP and AWAY from her
