      Walking slowly but with determination, Scott steps past the 
      bleachers, heading for the middle of the field. The newly 
      muscular and newly confident Boyd turns to face him, a 
      challenge in his eyes.

                                  SCOTT
                    I need to talk to Derek.

                                  BOYD
                    Talk to me.

                                  SCOTT
                    I don t want to fight.

                                  BOYD
                    Good.  Cause I m twice the size of *
                    you.

                                  SCOTT
                    True.*

      As Boyd approaches, Scott s gaze goes up and up.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                          (nervous)
                    Really, really true. But you know 
                    what I think?

      He lowers himself to a fighting stance.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    I m twice as fast.

      Hands pushing off the ground, Scott lunges forward. 

      Boyd swipes out, but Scott easily dodges the blow. Grabbing 
      onto Boyd s large frame to use it against him, Scott flips up 
      and kicks out--

      Sending Boyd s muscular body CRASHING to the ground.*                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 205" BLUE12/24/1123.

      Breathless, Scott lands back on his feet and meets Derek s *
      eyes. He seems to have appeared out of nowhere.*

                                  DEREK
                    She failed the test.

                                  SCOTT
                    Which doesn t prove anything. *
                    Lydia s different.

                                  DEREK
                    I know. At night she turns into a 
                      homicidal, walking snake.*

                                  SCOTT
                    I m not going to let you kill her.

                                  DEREK
                    Who said I was going to do it?

      Realization dawning on him, Scott turns back to the school *
      and the girl he left vulnerable to two other werewolves.


      Scott starts back for the school but Boyd grabs him, shoving 
      him to the ground in front of Derek.

                                  DEREK
                    I don t know why you think you have *
                    to protect everyone now, Scott. But 
                    even so, Lydia s killed people. 
                    She s going to do it again. Next 
                    time it s going to be one of us.

                                  SCOTT
                    What if you re wrong?

                                  DEREK
                    She was bitten by an Alpha. It s *
                    her.*

                                  SCOTT
                    You saw that thing up close. You 
                    know it s not like us.

                                  DEREK
                    But it is. We re all shapeshifters. 
                    You don t know what you re dealing 
                    with. I only know because of my *
                    sister. It happens rarely. And it *
                    happens for a reason.

                                  SCOTT
                    What reason?

                                  DEREK
                    Sometimes the shape you take 
                    reflects the person you are.

      Derek pulls him back to his feet, looking him in the eye.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    Even Stiles calls her cold-blooded.

                                  SCOTT
                    What if she s immune? What if she s 
                    got something inside her that made 
                    her immune to the bite? And it s 
                    also why she didn t get paralyzed?

      Boyd glances to Derek. Noticing his Alpha s hesitation.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 205" BLUE12/24/1125.

                                  DEREK
                    No one s immune. I ve never heard 
                    of it or seen it. It s never... 
                    It s never happened.

      Scott watches him carefully, noticing his pause.*

                                  SCOTT
                    Then what about Jackson?


      The bomb drops exactly the way Scott was hoping. Derek 
      doesn t respond. Gaining confidence, Scott inches toward him.

                                  SCOTT
                    That s why you tested him, isn t 
                    it? Because you gave him what he 
                    wanted. Didn t you?

                                  DEREK
                    Scott--

                                  SCOTT
                    Peter said the bite either kills 
                    you or turns you. You probably were *
                    hoping it would kill him. But *
                    nothing happened. Right? And you *
                    have no idea why, do you?*

                                  DEREK
                    No.*

                                  SCOTT
                    Well, I ve got a theory. Lydia s *
                    immune and somehow she passed it on 
                    to Jackson. You know I m right.*

                                  DEREK*
                    No.*

                    I can t let her live. You should *
                    have known that.

                                  SCOTT
                    I was hoping I could convince you. 
                    But then... I wasn t counting on *
                    it.

      Derek blinks, the realization of something wrong sending his 
      now uncertain gaze back to the school. Boyd looks at him, 
      questioningly.

                                  DEREK
                    Go.

      As Boyd turns to run for school, Derek spins back to find 
      Scott has used his moment of surprise--*

      He s gone.

                    Meeting us here. I think. I hope.

      Allison throws him a look. He gives a shrug as they hurry to *
      the door. While he digs for a key, Allison whispers to *
      Jackson.

                                    ALLISON
                    Thanks for doing this.

                                    JACKSON
                    I need to talk to her anyway.

      Allison nods, but eyes him a moment longer, something 
      unsettling about his darkening expression. The door swings 
      open--


      Standing by his side, Boyd waits for Derek to enter the *
      fight. From inside, they hear CRASHING. Furniture 
        SPLINTERING. And then--

    A POWERFUL ROAR. *

      As the house goes silent, Boyd throws Derek an uncertain 
      glance. But the Alpha looks oddly pleased.*

      The front door FLIES open. Isaac HURTLES OUT and lands with a 
      thud on the grass. Erica s PARALYZED BODY tumbles to the *
      grass next to him.

      Eyes burning with a furious YELLOW GLOW, Scott McCall steps 
      confidently over the threshold. Stiles and Allison follow, *
      remaining on the porch as Scott strides down the steps.*

      Derek cocks his head, listening. The faint SOUND of a SIREN 
        approaching. And then something else... an odd SCURRYING. The *
      CLICKING of sharp claws.

      Scott hears it too. All eyes follow theirs, everyone glancing *
      up to see--                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 205" BLUE12/24/1140.

      A sinewy, jet black body perched on the roof of the McCall *

      THE KANIMA.*

      Thin lips curling back to expose a double row of teeth, it *
      opens its jaws and unleashes an INHUMAN SHRIEK. Everyone *
      takes a step back as--

      Just beyond the glow of a STREET LIGHT, a car sits parked on *
      the side of the road. An ordinary vehicle with one 
      distinguishing detail. A bumper sticker that reads--*

         Imagination is more important than knowledge  - Einstein.*

      A SHADOW approaches. Tail flicking into the light, the Kanima 
      inches toward its next victim.

      Behind the closed window, THE DRIVER is a mere silhouette and *
      completely oblivious to the creature approaching on all 
      fours.

      Reaching the car door the Kanima begins to rise, hand moving *
      up as if to strike.                     TEEN WOLF "Episode 205" BLUE12/24/1141.

      But instead of punching through the glass, the creature lays 
      its reptilian fingers gently against the window.*

      Inside, the Driver s hand comes up to do the same. Two hands 
      on either side of the glass. One human. One not.

      The Kanima blinks, eyes GLOWING BRIGHTER for a brief second. *
        A connection made. *

      Pulling its claws from the window, it twists around, breaking *
      into a run as if set on an urgent mission.

      The car s engine ROARS to life. With a SQUEAL of tire against *
      pavement, the vehicle bullets into the darkness until all 
      that s left-- 

      Is an empty road.
