      FLASH - BLACK-AND-WHITE OF GIBBS, TONY AND ZIVA REACTING TO 
      THE NEWS...

                                                                  PHOOF TO BLACK:

      FROM BLACK

      EXT. LOS ANGELES CITY STREET (AERIAL-PICTOMETRY) - DAY

      Downtown L.A. from three thousand feet, ANGLING straight 
      down.  Begin a fast PUSH over radio distorted VOICES:

                    Acquiring 'Blackbird'.

                                    KENSI'S VOICE
                    North west on fifth, crossing Grand. 
                    He's moving to the south side of the 
                    street.  You got him Sam?

                                  SAM'S VOICE
                    I got him.

      And now the down town forest of skyscrapers fills the screen 
      and we change trajectory, swooping between the towers,  
      turning down West Fifth Street towards Grand Avenue.

                                  MACY'S VOICE
                    Traffic camera acquisition?

                      Pictometry going live in five....

      The swooping aerial comes to rest. It's a HIGH DEFINITION 
      photo, not live, an oblique angle of West Fifth Street 30 
      feet off the ground.  A beat, then a section of the street 
      shimmers with static as the TRAFFIC CAM image is stitched 
      into the photo.  And now we have a live view of the street.

                                  MACY'S VOICE
                    Zoom south side of the street. 
                      'Blackbird' is wearing a green rain

                      briefcase.        Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  2.


      And we're zooming in on a man whom we'll come to know as RAY 
      CHANDLER, early 20s, walking away from camera wearing a GREEN 
      RAIN JACKET and carrying an ALUMINIUM BRIEFCASE.

                                  TECHNICIAN'S VOICE
                      'Blackbird' acquired.

                    We have visual, Kensi.

      EXT. WEST FIFTH STREET - CONTINUOUS

      SPECIAL AGENT KENSI LO, late 20s.  Confident, headstrong, 
        intelligent. Exotic good looks, but dressed down to blend 
      into the crowd as she talks discreetly into her wrist mike...

                                  KENSI
                    Welcome to the party, Mace.

                                  MACY'S VOICE
                    Stay on him.

      KENSI'S POV across the street, Chandler walking steadily, not 
      looking left or right.  Kensi's POV shifts to a man walking 
      twenty yards behind Chandler...

                                  KENSI
                      Repositioning Sam, back to me at 
                    the intersection.

      SPECIAL AGENT SAM HANNA shoots her a discreet look.  Sam's in 
      his 40s, with the wisdom that only experience teaches.  Not 
      as fast as he used to be, but still as good for knowing it.

                                  SAM
                    Ease up Kensi, you don't wanna get 
                    there first.

      An SUV with tinted windows begins to slow.  Suddenly - BAM! 
      BAM! BAM! BAM! The shop front behind Chandler explodes in a 
      SHOWER OF GLASS.

      Sam instantly turns, reaching for his SIG as Kensi talks 
      urgently into her mike --

                                  KENSI
                    Shots fired! Shots fired! 
                      'Blackbird' is under fire!

      BACK WIDE TO PICTOMETRY AS

      Chandler recovers, begins to run as other PEDESTRIANS duck 
      for cover or turn in confusion.        Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  3.


                                  MACY'S VOICE
                    All units, close up, close up, 
                    shots fired.  Get me another angle.

                                  TECHNICIAN'S VOICE
                    Working on it.

      BACK ON THE STREET

      Kensi and Sam sprinting, closing the distance on Chandler and 
      at the same time identify where the shots are coming from.

      BAM! BAM! Chandler ducks as the window of a parked CAR 
      explodes behind him.  He's running hard, changes direction, 
      darting out into the speeding traffic.

      Sam tries to follow, is momentarily checked by the traffic.

      BAM! BAM! BAM! The shots hit a speeding SEDAN'S windscreen.  
      It side-swipes a PICK-UP which swerves out of control towards 
      Chandler.  It flashes by him, the front fender CLIPPING THE 
      BRIEFCASE, which bursts open...

      HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS spill from the briefcase, blowing high 
      into the air.  Chandler keeps running.

      Behind Kensi a chain reaction as the speeding traffic tries 
      to avoid the accident.  SQUEALING BRAKES and HONKING HORNS as 
      a second PICK-UP sideswipes a VAN, which veers off the road 
      towards the pavement.

      SAM'S POV as the Van demolishes a LITTER BIN and spears 
      straight for Kensi.

                                  SAM
                          (into his mike)
                    Kensi! Behind you!

      ON KENSI - already half turning to the sound of screeching 
      metal.  She dives for cover a split second before the out of 
      control Van mounts the pavement and slams into a shop wall.

      Sam sprints through traffic and swirling bank notes, 
      scrambles around the van, finds Kensi shaken in a doorway.

                                  KENSI
                    Get Chandler!

      Sam quickly looks down the street.  Traffic chaos.  Drivers.  
        Pedestrians. Onlookers.  

                                  SAM
                          (raises his mike wrist)
                    Need a GPS heading --        Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  4.


      BACK WIDE ON PICTOMETRY AS

      The CAMERA ANGLE changes, giving the still unseen Macy a 
      different perspective of the chaotic scene.

                                  MACY'S VOICE
                      Transmitter's in the briefcase --

      ZOOM IN on Sam, spinning around to look, sees the crushed 
      briefcase on the road. 

                                  MACY'S VOICE (CONT D)
                    We need a visual, Sam.

      Sam pushes through a growing crowd of ONLOOKERS, scanning the 
      street.  No Chandler. Too late.

                                  SAM
                    That's a negative, Mace. 
                      'Blackbird' has flown.

                                  MACY'S VOICE
                    Crap.

                                                                  AND WE SLAM TO:

      FROM BLACK:

      INT. NCIS SQUAD ROOM - DAY

      Elevator doors glide open, SPECIAL AGENTS ANTHONY DINOZZO and 
      TIMOTHY McGEE exit, heading for the bullpen.  Tony in a 
      mischievous mood, McGee fed up.

                                  MCGEE
                    I'm not going to argue with you, 
                    Tony.

                                  TONY
                    You're arguing now.

                                  MCGEE
                    No, I'm not.

                                  TONY
                    Yes, you are.

                                  MCGEE
                    This is not an argument.

                                  TONY
                    Yes, it is.        Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  5.


                                  MCGEE
                    No, it's not.

      Ziva's phone rings.  Tony picks it up. 

                                  TONY
                    Officer David's phone.
                          (listens - frowns)
                    She's not here right now can I -

      MOSSAD LIAISON OFFICER ZIVA DAVID enters from the rear of the 
      bull pen carrying a cup of coffee.

                                  TONY (CONT D)
                    -- ah she's just walked in.
                          (covering the mouthpiece)
                    Man. Deep voice.  Slightly 
                    accented.  Probably six-three. Two 
                    hundred pounds.  Prada suit. 
                    Italian shoes.  Standing on the 
                    north side of the street --

      Ziva pries the phone from him.

                                  TONY (CONT D)
                    -- asking for Ziva.

                                  ZIVA
                    Thank you Tony.
                          (moves behind her desk)
                    Hello?

      She listens a beat, then lowers her voice, shifts to Hebrew. 
      Tony frowns, wants to linger but instead turns back to McGee.

                                  TONY
                    So what were we arguing about 
                    again?  I forget.

                                  MCGEE
                    We are not arguing.

                                  TONY
                    Oh that.  Yes, we are.

                                  MCGEE
                    That's what we were arguing about, 
                    Tony.  That you like to argue about 
                    the least little thing. Sometimes 
                    about nothing at all.  You just 
                    like to argue.

                                  TONY
                    No, I don't.        Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  6.


      McGee is about to argue.  Stops himself.

                                  TONY (CONT'D)
                    It's not arguing, McContrary.  It's 
                    banter.

                                  MCGEE
                    It's not banter, Tony.

                                  TONY
                    Yes, it is.

                                  MCGEE
                    No it's not.  Banter is light-
                    hearted, teasing repartee --

      McGee realizes he's the one arguing. Glares at Tony, who 
      feigns innocence.

                                  TONY
                    Go on.

                                  MCGEE
                    Coffee.  Black.  Your turn.

      Tony is about to argue --

                                  GIBBS' VOICE
                    Don't argue DiNozzo.  Coffee can 
                    wait, McGee.  Dead Marine can't.

      SPECIAL AGENT LEROY JETHRO GIBBS crosses to his desk, pulls 
      out his SIG and his ID.  Ziva quickly ends her call.  Tony 
      shooting her a look as he gears up.

                                  TONY
                    Don't you hate those long distance 
                      relationships?

      A quizzing look from Ziva.

                                  TONY (CONT D)
                    Your tele-friend from Tel Aviv.

                                  ZIVA
                    You are jealous.

                                  TONY
                    No, I'm not.

                                  ZIVA
                    Yes, you are.        Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  7.


                                  TONY
                    I am not jealous.  
                          (off Gibbs' look)
                    And I am not arguing, Boss.

      McGee blows by, heading for the elevator.

                                  MCGEE
                    Are too.

                                  TONY
                    Am not.

      Ziva shakes her head in despair and turns for the elevator.

      INT. MULTI-STORY BUILDING SITE - DAY

      BUILDER'S PLASTIC, blowing in the breeze, giving us a glimpse 
      of concrete support columns, dusty floors and the skeleton of 
      an unfinished building, open to the elements.  Gibbs, Tony, 
      Ziva and McGee step through a gap in the plastic, stop in 
      their tracks, taking in the crime scene.

                                  TONY
                    'X' marks the spot.

      FROM THEIR POV: instead of floor to ceiling windows, the DEAD 
      GUY, silhouetted against the sweeping panorama of the 
      Washington DC skyline. He's facing into the building, arms 
      and legs stretched wide, tied to floor and ceiling to form an 
      'X'. He's stripped to the waist, his chest bound with wire 
      and trailing CABLES.

      RESUME the team, grim-faced.

        CLICK-FLASH: on DOG TAGS hanging from the Dead Guy's neck;

        CLICK-FLASH: on copper wire bound around his chest, two

      Gibbs takes the boarding pass.

                                  GIBBS
                    Arrived this morning.

                                  TONY
                    Those red-eye flights are murder.

                                    DUCKY'S VOICE
                    What a marvellous view.

      DOCTOR DONALD 'DUCKY' MALLARD joins them.  He's carrying his 
      Medical Examiner's KIT BAG.

                                  DUCKY
                    The sweep of early American history 
                    at a single glance. From the 
                    Potomac to the Dome of Congress. 
                    Not that this poor fellow would 
                    have taken any enjoyment from it.

      He puts down his ME kit.  Begins to examine the body.

                                  ZIVA
                      Construction workers found him when 
                    they arrived for work at eight AM.

                                  DUCKY
                    No sign of lividity or onset of 
                    rigor.  

                                  TONY
                    Guessing the flight landed around 
                    six.  Thirty minutes from the 
                    airport.  
                                  (MORE)        Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  9.

                                  TONY (CONT'D)
                    Say another twenty minutes for the 
                    tie and fry.  Puts time of death 
                    around seven AM.

                                  DUCKY
                    Eleven minutes after seven to be 
                    precise.

      A look from Tony.  Ducky indicates Chandler's wrist watch.

                                  TONY
                    Digital. He wasn't the only thing 
                    fried.

                                  MCGEE
                      Twenty-four volt battery. Not 
                    enough voltage to electrocute him.

                                  DUCKY
                    But certainly enough to suffocate 
                    him, Timothy.

      McGee and Tony both give Ducky doubtful looks.

                                  MCGEE
                    He was suffocated?

                                  DUCKY
                    The application of a sustained 
                    current across the chest causes a 
                    tetanic contraction of the 
                      respiratory muscles.  The diaphragm 
                    and the intercostals seize up. The 
                    poor fellow would have been fully 
                    conscious but unable to breathe. 
                    Death by suffocation.
                          (beat)
                      A particularly excruciating, 
                      terrifying and slow way to die.

                                  ZIVA
                    Wanted him to suffer.

                                  GIBBS
                    Or talk.

      And off this sobering thought...

      INT. NCIS SQUAD ROOM - DAY

      Chandler's MARINE ID PHOTO on the PLASMA.      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  10.


                                    MCGEE'S VOICE
                    Chandler was deployed to Riyadh, 
                    Saudi Arabia.  Got back yesterday.  
                      Compassionate leave.

      Gibbs watching the PLASMA as McGee throws up the details. 
      Ziva and Tony at their desks, working their phones.

                                  GIBBS
                    Service record?

                                  MCGEE
                      Exemplary.  Not so much as a 
                    scuffed boot.

      Tony hangs up.

                                  TONY
                    Chandler bought his airline ticket 
                    at the gate.  No checked luggage.
                          (beat)
                    Man in a hurry to get somewhere.
                          (beat)
                    Or away from someone.

      Gibbs looks to Ziva as she hangs up.

                                  GIBBS
                    Car rental?

                                  ZIVA
                    Booked a car in-flight with a credit 
                    card.  But did not pick it up.

                                  TONY
                    Someone picked him up first.

                                  MCGEE
                    Ah Boss...got some activity...not 
                    the only one's looking at Chandler.  
                    BOLO's been issued out of Los 
                    Angeles.

      McGee works his keyboard.

                      Nationwide alert.

      McGee's frown.      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  11.


                                  MCGEE
                    That's a negative...

      McGee stares at the screen, his frown deepening.

                                  GIBBS
                    Who issued the Bolo, McGee?

      McGee looks up.

                                  MCGEE
                    Ah...
                          (falters)

      And off Gibbs, Tony and Ziva's surprise...

      INT. MTAC - DAY

      ON THE BIG SCREEN - INSERT of the video footage of the attack 
      on Chandler in Los Angeles.

                                  MACY'S VOICE
                    All units, close up, close up, 
                    shots fired.  

      DIRECTOR LEON VANCE watches with Gibbs. Vance hits the MUTE 
      button on the REMOTE, killing the audio.

                                  VANCE
                      Chandler's mother was beaten half 
                    to death in a home invasion last 
                    week.  He was granted compassionate 
                    leave.  Before he left Saudi 
                    Arabia, someone gave him a quarter 
                    million dollars.  Told him if he 
                    delivered it to an address in Los 
                    Angeles, they wouldn't go back and 
                    finish the job on his mother.
                          (beat)
                    He was an easy target. Only child.

      ON THE SCREEN, Chandler's briefcase is clipped by the Pick-
      Up, money is blown skyward.

                                  VANCE (CONT D)
                    Local informant tipped us off. 
                    Chandler agreed to work with us.  
                    On his way to the drop, someone 
                    took a shot at him.  Kid panicked.  
                    Tried to get home to his mom in 
                    West Virginia.  Got as far as D.C.

                                  GIBBS
                    Not just about a dead marine.

                                  VANCE
                    Think it could be tied to an arms 
                    deal case we're working over there.

      A flicker of a frown from Gibbs, not lost on Vance.

                                  GIBBS
                    She still the Agent in charge?

                                  VANCE
                    You got a problem?

                                  GIBBS
                    No.  But she might.

                                  VANCE
                    You're on the same team.  Work it 
                    out.

      Gibbs' look suggests that's going to be a problem.  He turns 
      for the door.

      Vance looks back at the screen. Hits the MUTE button on the 
      remote, bringing up the sound in time for Macy's single word 
      response...

                                  MACY'S VOICE
                    Crap.

      Vance sighs.

                                  TONY
                    Sounded more like a Bruce than a 
                    Michael on the phone.

      Before Ziva can respond, Gibbs enters, heads for his desk, 
      shooting a look at McGee.

                    After our last trip to L.A., I do not 
                      understand why you think we would be

      Ziva's cellphone rings.  

                                  TONY (CONT D)
                    Answer that.

      Ziva checks the caller ID, answers it.  Again, speaking in 
      Hebrew.  Not lost on Tony.  McGee grabs his bag, begins 
      quickly packing it with an assortment of electronic gear.

                                  MCGEE
                    Talk to him?  I have to...talk to 
                    him?

                                  TONY
                    Small talk.  Better brush up on 
                    your boat building.  Or you could 
                    buy a copy of Sniper Monthly.

      As McGee has a sudden attack of the nerves, Ziva snaps her 
      cellphone closed.      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  16.


                                  ZIVA
                          (to Tony)
                    Cover for me.

      She grabs her bag, heads for the elevator.  McGee follows her.

                                  TONY
                    Hey!  Wait...

      McGee's desk phone begins to ring.

                                  TONY (CONT D)
                    When will you be back?

                                  ZIVA
                    Soon.

                                  MCGEE
                    Later.

      The elevator CHIMES and they both step through the doorway. 
      Tony silently curses.  As he crosses to McGee's phone, Ziva's 
      phone begins to RING.  He changes direction.  A moment later 
      his phone begins to RING.  

      And off Tony, caught between ringing phones...

      She hangs up the phone.  Frowns pensively.      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  17.

                    What was weird, Abbs?

      Abby turns from her computer as Gibbs enters.

      INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY

      Late afternoon.  Tony, half-eaten BURGER in one hand, phone 
      receiver cradled under his chin as he scribbles notes.

                                  TONY
                          (into the phone)
                    He use a credit card for that? 

      McGee's phone RINGS.  Tony glances at McGee's empty desk.

                                  TONY (CONT'D)
                    So just two calls from the 
                    airphone?
                          (covers the mouthpiece)
                    Someone want to get that?
                          (back into his phone)
                    No, I wasn't yelling at you, I was - 
                          (listens)
                    Sure.  Okay, that's all I needed to 
                    know.  Thanks.

      He hangs his phone, dumps his burger, hurries to answer 
      McGee's phone.  It stops as he's about to pick it up.  Tony 
      grimaces.  Looks across the room.  

      Ziva's desk.  Vacant.

      Tony checks his watch.  Reaches a decision.  Back to his 
      desk, picks up the phone, punches in a number.

                                  TONY (CONT D)
                          (into the phone)
                    Not keeping you from anything, am 
                    I?  Like work.

      EXT. COFFEE SHOP - SAME TIME

      Ziva sitting at an outside table, talking on her cell.

                                  ZIVA
                    Tony.  I am working on something.  
                    Following a lead.

                                  TONY
                    A lead?  On Chandler?      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  19.


                                  ZIVA
                    It might not come to anything. 

                                  TONY
                    You wanna share?

                                  ZIVA
                    Tony, I cannot talk, I have to go.

                                  TONY
                    Go.
                          (sound of phone hung up)
                    Gone.

      Tony hangs up the phone.  Troubled.  Something's up with 
      Ziva.  He can feel it.

      RESUME ZIVA in the coffee shop.  

      CAMERA MOVE REVEALS MICHAEL RIVKIN (established Episode 114 
      'Last Man Standing') sitting opposite Ziva.  Straight off the 
      cover of Vogue Men.  Ziva uncomfortable.

                                  RIVKIN
                    DiNozzo?

                                  ZIVA
                    I do not want to lie to him, 
                    Michael.

                                  RIVKIN
                    A small lie. 
                          (then)
                    Your father sends his love.

                                  ZIVA
                    What else does my father send?

      He reaches out, touches her arm.

                                  RIVKIN
                    Me.

      Rivkin smiles disarmingly.  

      And off Ziva, hard to read...

                                                                      PHOOF TO BLACK.

      Series of shots of L.A. including: Aircraft stacked up to 
      land at LAX; Port area; Venice Beach; Downtown; Chinatown; 
      and the Garment District.

      INT. OSP - ATRIUM - DAY

      A warehouse shell with narrow, towering windows that fill the 
      deeply shadowed atrium with shafts of light.  Paint peeling 
      and untouched in decades.  All the appearances of being 
      derelict except for THREE LARGE PLASMA SCREENS mounted on the 
      wall beside an WROUGHT IRON DOOR.  Each screen displays 
      different security video of the street. On one screen, the 
      familiar faces of Gibbs and McGee waiting to enter.

      Kensi emerges from the shadows, passes her SECURITY CARD over 
      a SCANNER and the wrought iron door swings silently open.

      INT. OSP - ENTRY - CONTINUOUS

      The entry hall is unfurnished, dusty, looks like it hasn't 
      been used in decades.  All an illusion.  Kensi crosses to the 
      main door, slides a dead bolt, swings the door open.  Bright 
      sunlight. Gibbs and McGee silhouetted as they enter.  McGee 
      is carrying his computer bag.  Kensi bolts the door.

                                  KENSI
                    Hi.  Kensi Lo.  

                                  GIBBS
                    Gibbs.

      Kensi shakes his hand, turns to McGee.

                                  MCGEE
                    McGee.

                                  KENSI
                    First time at OSP?

                        MCGEEGIBBS
      Yes.No.      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  21.


      Kensi grins at McGee's discomfort, leads them through the 
        wrought-iron door.

      INT. OSP - ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS

      And for the first time, we're seeing the rest of the 
      warehouse - a building within a building.  At the far end of 
      the cathedral like space, stairs rise to a second floor which 
      is encased in curved, sloping plate glass.  Behind the glass, 
      a brightly lit modern office space, half a dozen AGENTS and 
      SUPPORT STAFF moving about. Some working behind desks.

                                  KENSI
                    Garment district. Factory conversion.  
                    Used to be a sweat shop. Some days 
                    feels like it still is.

      They cross to the stairs.  Kensi sees a magazine peeking from 
      McGee's bag: BOATBUILDER'S ANNUAL.  

                                  KENSI (CONT D)
                    You sail?

                                  MCGEE
                    No.

                                  KENSI
                    Build boats?

                                  MCGEE
                    No.  

      McGee realizes she's looking at the magazine.

                                  MCGEE (CONT D)
                    Oh.  Um...conversation starter.

                                  KENSI
                    Works.

      McGee squirms, aware Gibbs is listening.

      INT. OSP - MEZZANINE - CONTINUOUS

      They climb the stairs, cross the office, head down a hallway.

                                  KENSI
                    How was the flight?

                                  GIBBS
                    Slept all the way.

      She looks at McGee.      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  22.


                                  MCGEE
                    Not a wink.

      McGee tucks the magazine out of sight.  No longer required.

      Kensi swipes her ID across a scanner and pushes through a 
      door marked: OPERATIONS - RESTRICTED ACCESS.

      INT. OSP - OPERATIONS CENTER - CONTINUOUS

      A darkened room, similar to MTAC - but wider, deeper.  On the 
      far wall, THREE OVERSIZED SCREENS, each being fed operational 
      data.  On the right side of the room, half a dozen CONSOLES, 
      only a couple of them manned by OPERATORS.  Each console has 
      it's own FLAT SCREEN.  In the middle of the room, a 
      rectangular table that's fitted with a COMPUTER TOUCH SCREEN.  

      But Gibbs and McGee's attention is drawn to one of the main 
      screens, where Vance is video-conferencing with SPECIAL AGENT 
      CLARA MACY, early 40s.  The easy confidence of someone who 
      knows how to manage people.  Never wears make-up but has a 
      natural beauty that's pleasing to the eye.  She's learned to 
      live with it.

                                  VANCE
                    NSA is worried about the Horn of 
                    Africa.  Somalia in particular.

                                  MACY
                    Increased chatter?

                                  VANCE
                    Opposite.  Suddenly all they're 
                    hearing are crickets. 

                                  MACY
                          (not believing it for a 
                            moment)
                    Maybe the bad guys have all given 
                    up and gone home.

      Macy turns, sees Gibbs and McGee.  So does NATE GETZ, 30, 
      lounging against a wall.  People watching.  He's dishevelled - 
      looks like he's come from the beach.  Probably has.  He's as 
      interested in Macy's reaction to Gibbs, as Gibbs himself.

                                  VANCE
                    Or they're on their way here.
                          (beat)
                    Tell Gibbs to call me when he 
                    arrives.

                                  MACY
                    You can tell him yourself.      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  23.


      Gibbs steps forward.

                                  VANCE
                    Just wanted to make sure we all 
                    work together on this one.  Full 
                      cooperation.  Intel going in both 
                      directions.
                          (beat)
                    I know how excited you two are to

                    Don't make me have to come out there.

      Vance nods to someone off screen and his face is replaced 
      with color bars.  Gibbs and Macy exchange a look.

                                  MACY
                    Am I under investigation?

                                  GIBBS
                    Should you be?

      McGee and Kensi both shuffle uncomfortably, feeling the 
      pressure rise.  Getz watches, intrigued. 

                                  MACY
                    You still drink coffee?

                                  GIBBS
                    You still burn it?

      She turns away. Gibbs follows. Kensi and McGee relax.

      INT. MACY'S OFFICE - SEMI CONTINUOUS

      A thin NCIS FOLDER is dumped onto a desk in front of Gibbs. 

                                  MACY'S VOICE
                      Everything we know about Chandler.

      As Gibbs opens the file, Macy crosses to a coffee machine, 
      pours coffee into THROWAWAY CUPS.  The office is functional, 
      nothing to suggest a woman's touch. Gibbs scans the file.

                                  MACY
                    How's his mother?

                                  GIBBS
                    Asking for her son.

      He looks at her. A somber, shared beat. Then Gibbs moves on.

                                  GIBBS (CONT D)
                    What was the plan?

                                  MACY
                    Follow the money. We put a GPS 
                    locator in the briefcase.  Shadowed 
                    him to the rendezvous.  Didn't have 
                    a lot of time to set it up...

                                  GIBBS
                    Someone was running counter 
                      surveillance.  Your team got made.  
                    Whoever he was going to meet took 
                    him out to protect themselves.  

                                  MACY
                    My team didn't get made -

                                  GIBBS
                    Said yourself it was a rushed job.

                                  MACY
                    And you've never had a blown 
                      surveillance op?

      Gibbs concedes.  Macy puts the coffee down in front of him.  

                                  GIBBS
                    Who was he meeting?

                                  MACY
                    Someone called Liam.      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  25.


                                  GIBBS
                    How's this tied to the arms deal 
                    your investigating?

                                  MACY
                      A coincide of days.  Chandler had 
                    until the end of the week to 
                    deliver the cash.
                          (beat)
                    Arms broker's on a tight deadline 
                    as well.  End of the week.

                                  GIBBS
                    Not much of a connection.  You've 
                    met him?

                                  MACY
                    Meet's set for later today.  Local 
                    diner.

                                  GIBBS
                      Undercover?

                                  MACY
                    It's what we do.

      Gibbs sips his coffee.  Hard to read what he thinks.

                                  MACY (CONT D)
                    Word of advice, Jethro.
                          (beat)
                    Let me do my job.

                                  GIBBS
                    Like you did first time we met?

      Macy returns his steady gaze.  Gibbs picks up the file.  
      Leaves the coffee.  

                                  GIBBS (CONT D)
                    Keep working on the coffee.

      As Gibbs exits, Getz enters.

                                  GETZ
                    They're all set at the diner.

                                  MACY
                    Callen?

                                  GETZ
                    Haven't seen him. Yet.      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  26.


      Macy is pissed, sits at her desk.  Getz looks at a plasma 
      displaying SECURITY FOOTAGE of the atrium and the street. He 
      watches as Gibbs and McGee across the atrium. He glances back 
      at Macy, who is studying a file.  He studies her a moment.  
      Macy doesn't look up.

                                  MACY
                    Get out of my head, Nate.

                      Operational psychologist. It's my

                    Gibbs.  Wanna talk about him?

                                  MACY
                    No.

                                  GETZ
                    He doesn't trust you.  
                          (off her look)
                    Body language screamed it.  
                    Couldn't wait to leave.

                                  MACY
                    Nate, you only passed him in the 
                    doorway.

      He shrugs - that was enough.

                                  GETZ
                    You should have slept with him way 
                    back then.  Whenever then was.  I 
                    probably wasn't even born.

                                  MACY
                    How do you know I didn't?

      Getz is about to answer.

                                  MACY (CONT D)
                    Don't answer that.  You scare me.  
                    Leave.

      Getz turns for the door.

                                  MACY (CONT D)
                    Find Callen.

                                  GETZ
                    Yeah.  Right.

      Big joke.  They both know it.  Macy sips her coffee.  Not 
      good, but she's not about to admit it.      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  27.

                    Will do, Boss.

      Gibbs snaps his cell closed, looks at McGee, who is still 
      trying to figure out how he kept Gibbs entertained.

                                  GIBBS

                    Keep 'em company. Meeting an old

      And he heads out, leaving McGee curious; Gibbs has a friend?

                    Sorry about yesterday.

                                  ZIVA
                    I said I was sorry.

                    The lead did not lead anywhere.

      OPERATORS man their consoles.  McGee and Getz both stand off

                    Yep.

      Gibbs leans into FRAME, sharing the bench with Callen.

                                  CALLEN
                    Same one?

                                  GIBBS
                    No.  Another one.

                                  CALLEN
                    Two boats. Three wives.

                                  GIBBS
                    Four.

      A flicker of a smile from Callen.  Nearby, a FAMILY GROUP is 
      playing a game of BOLO.  Fun.  Laughter.  Callen and Gibbs 
      watch them in silence for a beat.

                                  CALLEN
                    You see Mace?

                                  GIBBS
                    Yeah. I saw her.

                                  CALLEN
                    You got a long memory.

                                  GIBBS
                    For some things.

                                  CALLEN
                    You two would make a great couple if 
                    you didn't hate each other so much.  

                                  GIBBS
                    How have you been, G?

                                  CALLEN
                    Not so bad.  Maybe even bordering 
                    on good some days.  

                                  GIBBS

                                  CALLEN
                    Still looking.
                          (beat)
                    Reason we're not having this 
                      conversation in a bar?

                                  GIBBS
                    Ten AM.

                                  CALLEN
                    Wouldn't have stopped us back then.

      Callen suddenly leans close, lowers his voice.

                                  CALLEN (CONT D)
                    How's your Russian?

                                  GIBBS
                    Rusty.

                                  CALLEN
                    Name's Alexi.

      A YOUNG WOMAN, 20s, attractive, approaches.  Sees Callen, a 
      smile of recognition forming on her lips.

                                  CALLEN (CONT D)
                          (in Russian)
                    I don't want to hear any more 
                    excuses.  You tell him he has until 
                    the end of the week. 

                                  GIBBS
                          (in Russian)
                    What happens at the end of the 
                    week, Alexi?

                                  CALLEN
                          (in Russian)
                    If he doesn't pay what he owes then 
                    I will find him and I will --

      Callen abruptly stops as he 'sees' her for the first time. 

                                  CALLEN (CONT D)
                    It was a good game, but the striker 
                    should never have been red carded. 

      He smiles at the Young Woman who quickly moves on.  Callen 
      watches her a moment. Perhaps with a hint of regret.

                                  GIBBS
                    Should have told me you were 
                      undercover.      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  32.


                                  CALLEN
                    Only for her. 
                          (indicating a building)
                    She lives across the street from 
                    me.  Just arrived from St 
                      Petersburg.  Lonely. If she thinks 
                    I'm Russian Mafia she won't try to 
                    make friends.

                                  GIBBS
                    Wouldn't hurt for you to have some 
                    female company.

                                  CALLEN
                    This from the man who's been 
                    married too many times.

      Callen's cell rings. Macy. He kills the call. Looks at Gibbs.

                                  CALLEN (CONT D)
                    Sometimes you plan them for weeks.  
                    Sometimes you get a day.

                                  GIBBS
                    Another one of Macy's rushed ops.

                                  CALLEN
                    Arms broker named Talia. Doesn't trust 
                    anyone.  Don't like our chances.
                          (not moving)
                    Miss the old days. You taught me a lot.  
                    Saved my ass that time in Serbia.

                    Moscow.

                                  CALLEN
                    My ass didn't need saving in Moscow.

                                  GIBBS
                    Yes, it did.

                                  CALLEN
                    No, that was Petrov.  Petrov's ass 
                    always needed saving.

      Underneath the fun, something more serious. More poignant. 

                                  CALLEN (CONT D)
                    Some are worth saving more than others.

      Callen holds Gibbs' look for a moment.      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  33.


                                  CALLEN (CONT D)
                    Worked with some good people.  

                                  GIBBS
                    Made some good friends.

                                  CALLEN
                    Lost a few.
                          (moving on)
                    How's Fornell?

                                  GIBBS
                    Same.

                                  CALLEN
                    He owes me twenty bucks.

                                  GIBBS
                    Fornell owes everyone twenty bucks.

      A wry smile from Callen.  His cell rings again.  He flicks it 
      off.  Time's up.  They stand.  A handshake turns into a hug.

                                  CALLEN
                    Next time, we park in a bar.  Not 
                    bolo in a park.  Okay?

      Gibbs nods.  Callen sets off.  Gibbs watches for a long 
      moment, then turns and walks off in the opposite direction. 

      INT. DINER - DAY

      INTERCUT WITH:

      INT. OSP - OPERATIONS CENTER - SAME TIME

      CLOSE on a plasma displaying a MINI-CAMERA view of the diner.  
      A dozen CUSTOMERS, including MATTIE RAE, 30ish, sitting at 
      the counter, drinking coffee.  And in a booth, NICK TALIA, 
      40s, a half-eaten burger on a plate, talking on his CELL.

                    Trying.

      WIDE to reveal the Operations Center buzzing with activity. 

      Sam pulls up the image of Talia on the Touch Screen, taps the 
      cellphone.  Talia's cell number appears, and a spinning disc 
        icon...searching.  An outgoing arrow appears beside the 
      number, pointing to a new number.  Sam double-clicks the new 
      number.  Data begins scrolling beneath it.

                                  SAM
                    Caller's a cell number.  Cheap 
                      throwaway. 

                                  TECHNICIAN'S VOICE
                    Bringing up the outside links.

      The screen splits again - two more views of the diner, both 
      from outside.  One of the entrance, the other of the street.

                                  SAM
                    Camera three and four are up.

                          (distorted)
                    At the movies.

      Macy quickly turns, looks at the plasma. Callen, cellphone 
      pressed to his ear, steps into view, glancing into camera.

                                  CALLEN
                    Wired and ready. 

      He flicks off his cellphone, crosses the street towards the 
      Diner.  Sam shoots a look at Macy.

                                  SAM

                    After eighteen years, it wouldn't 
                    kill you to cut Gibbs a bit of slack, 
                    you know what I'm saying Mace?  One 
                    honk if you can hear me, Sam.

      Macy glowers.  No one looks at her.  Sam thumbs a button on 
      the REMOTE SWITCHER he's holding.      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  35.

                    Kensi.  Honk your horn.  Once.

      EXT. DINER - SAME TIME

      Callen, walking towards the diner, glances casually down the 
      street.  A CAR HORN HONKS.  Once.  

      And on cue, Callen transforms himself, slowing his stride, 
      hunching his shoulders, dropping his dead down a little, eyes 
      flashing left and right...No longer Callen but Frank 
      Maitland.  He pushes through the door and enters the diner.

      INT. KENSI'S CAR - SAME TIME

      Kensi watching from her car, talks into her wrist mic:

                                  KENSI
                    He's in.  Street's clear.

      Callen slides into the booth opposite Nick Talia, who flicks 
      his cellphone closed.

                    My cousin had a diner in Chicago a

                    His roaches probably ran a little 
                    bigger.  Hygiene wasn't one of

                    The roach. 

      At the counter, Mattie Rae steals a long glance at Callen.  
      Thinks hard.  Callen sees him.  Mattie quickly looks away.

                                  CALLEN (CONT D)
                    So, you're in the market.

      Callen leans forward, suddenly intense.

                    You wired?

                    I said -- are you wired?

      Talia holds his gaze a long beat.

                                  TALIA
                    Are you?

      A long moment, then Callen smiles thinly.      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  37.

                    Can't be done.

      Not what Talia wanted to hear.  Callen sees Mattie scribbling 
      on a SCRAP OF PAPER, whispering to a BUSBOY.

                    No isn't a word my client 
                      understands.

                                  CALLEN
                    Then let me explain it to him.

      Talia shakes his head, is about to respond when the Busboy 
      steps up, whispers in his ear, at the same time, handing him 
      the folded scrap of paper.   Callen glances across at Mattie.  
      This time, Mattie doesn't look away.  Stares him down.  
      Callen's gaze flicks back to Talia, who unfolds the paper.  
      Reads it.

      Talia's POV: scribbled on the paper.  Three words: HE'S A COP.

      Talia slips the paper into his pocket. Resumes eating.

                                  TALIA
                    Piss off.

                                  CALLEN
                    What?

                                  TALIA
                    You heard me.  I said, piss off.  

      Callen hesitates.

      IN THE OPERATIONS CENTER

      Getz steps up beside Macy and Vaile.

                                  GETZ
                    Ops over. Time to get out of there.  

      RESUME THE DINER

      Callen stands, gets in Talia's face. Back to being Callen.      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  38.


                                  CALLEN
                    Tell your client we're going to 
                    meet some day.

      Callen turns away, heads for the door.

      IN THE OPERATIONS CENTER

      Macy, Sam, Getz and McGee watch the screen as Callen steps 
      out of the diner.  He looks into camera.

      At the same time, on the other screens, Talia glances across 
      at Mattie Rae, nods his thanks.  Mattie nods back.

                                  TECHNICIAN'S VOICE
                    Got playback on Talia's call...

                                  MACY
                    Go.

      Talia's voice, crackling under extreme amplification:

                                    TALIA'S VOICE
                    I know, I -static- you -static- me -
                    and I -static- deliver, I will 
                    deliver -static- I will deliver -
                    static- ...

      Macy doubts what she just heard.

                                  MACY
                    Replay, isolate the last word.

      CLUNK of buttons, WHIR of the shuttle, back and forward, 
      isolating the static, enhancing it at each pass...the word 
      growing out of the static...

                                    TALIA'S VOICE
                          -static-...-static-...Li--static-
                        ...-static-am...Liam. Liam.

      Macy and Sam exchange a look.

                                  SAM
                    Same guy?

                                  MACY
                    Same guy.

      And off Macy realizing they've made the connection...

                                                                        PHOOF TO BLACK

      FROM BLACK

      INT. OSP - MEZZANINE - DAY

      Gibbs and McGee with Macy, Callen and Sam.

                                  SAM
                    Chandler is coerced into smuggling 
                    a quarter million dollars in cash 
                    from Saudi Arabia by a man named 
                    Liam.

                                  MCGEE
                    Wiring it to a bank would have been 
                    easier...

                                  CALLEN
                    Would have left a paper trail.

                                  SAM
                    At the same time, Talia is 
                      approached to procure assault 
                    weapons and C-4...also by a man 
                    named Liam.

                                  CALLEN
                    Cash.  Weapons. 

                                  MACY
                    Don't like where this is heading.

                                  GIBBS
                    You got a plan, Agent Macy?

                                  MACY
                    Talia's the plan. 

      Gibbs holds her gaze.

                                  MACY (CONT D)
                    Sam, get Agents Gibbs and McGee up 
                    to speed.

      Sam glances quickly from Macy to Gibbs.      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  40.


                                  SAM
                    You got it.

      And Sam ushers Gibbs and McGee towards the operations center. 
      Macy turns to stare thoughtfully down into the atrium.

      MACY'S POV - Kensi and several ND AGENTS are playing 
      basketball in the atrium.

      RESUME MACY as Callen steps up beside her.

                                  CALLEN
                    Eighteen years ago.  You were still 
                    in the Marine Corp.  Lieutenant 
                    Clara Macy.  Military Police.
                          (beat)
                    Gibbs was still a Gunny Sergeant.

                                  MACY
                    Don't go there.

                                  CALLEN
                    You involved in some case together?

                                  MACY
                    Why do you need to know?

                                  CALLEN
                    Just looking out for my family. 

      Macy turns back, watches the game below.

                                  MACY
                    G, you haven't got any family.

                                  CALLEN
                    That's cruel, Mace.

                                  MACY
                    But true.

                                  CALLEN
                    Gibbs is family.  You, too.
                          (a thought)
                    Got any photos of you in uniform?

                                  MACY
                    Yes.  And no you can't see them.

                                  CALLEN
                    I might ask Gibbs what happened.

                                  MACY
                    Let me know if you do.      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  41.


      A look from Callen.

                                  MACY (CONT D)
                    I wanna be there to see him sit you 
                    on your ass.

      He smiles, turns away.  She watches him through the glass as 
      he goes down the stairs into the atrium.

      MACY'S POV - THE ATRIUM  

      Callen calls for the ball, takes the pass.  Kensi tries to 
      block him, he gets around her, sinks a basket.

      RESUME MACY.  Troubled.

                                    DUCKY'S VOICE
                    He can be very disconcerting.

      INT. AUTOPSY - DAY

      Ducky standing over Chandler's body on the slab. Post 
      autopsy.  He's holding a sheaf of FORMS.  Tony beside him.

                                  DUCKY
                      ...popping up behind you just when 
                    you've got something for him.

                                  TONY
                    The man's a mind reader.

                                  DUCKY
                    Pretend you're him.

                                  TONY
                    Whatcha got, Duck?

                                  DUCKY
                    That's very good.
                          (moves to his desk)
                    The dreaded paper chase, Jethro.  I 
                    need your signature.

                                  TONY
                    Now this is where I stop being Gibbs 
                    and revert to being plain old very 
                    Special Agent DiNozzo. Where do I sign?

      Ducky points at four different places on the top sheet.

                                  DUCKY
                    All seven pages.

      And he offers a pen.  Tony sighs, takes it.  Begins to sign.      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  42.


                                  DUCKY (CONT D)
                    And while you sign, you can tell me 
                    why you came down to see me.

      A look from Tony.  He resumes signing.

                                  TONY
                    Ziva.

                                  DUCKY
                    Ahhh.  Personal.  Not professional.

                                  TONY
                    It's not what you think.

                                  DUCKY
                    I'm not thinking anything. What are 
                    you thinking?

                                  TONY
                    I'm thinking she's worried about 
                      something.
                          (frowns - stops signing)
                    She's distracted.

                                  DUCKY
                    We all get distracted. Keep signing.

      Tony resumes signing.

                                  DUCKY (CONT D)
                    Do you think it's interfering with 
                    her work?

                                  TONY
                    Maybe.
                          (beat)
                    Did she ever talk about what she did 
                    when she went back to Israel after 
                    the director sent us all packing?

                                  DUCKY
                    No.  She was involved in some 
                      undercover operation in Morocco.

                                  TONY
                    Know all about that.

                                  DUCKY
                    She almost died.

                                  TONY
                          (looks up quickly)
                    Didn't know about that.      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  43.


                                  DUCKY
                    There's a brief glimpse of her on 
                    some news footage taken after the 
                    bomb blast.  It would have been very 
                    traumatic - even for someone as 
                    resilient and well-trained as Ziva.
                          (thinking)
                    Perhaps I should talk to her...

                                  TONY
                    Ah.  Probably just me...over-
                    reacting.  If anything else happens 
                    I'll let you know.
                          (finishes signing)
                    And done.
                          (thought)
                    Anything in here I should know about?  

                                  DUCKY
                    Cause of death was suffocation, 
                    brought on by electric shock.  
                    Numerous contusions and bruising 
                    suggests he was forcibly abducted 
                    before being strung up and tortured.

                                  TONY
                          (turning for the door)
                    Lovely.

                                  DUCKY
                    And there was skin.

      Tony looks back.

                                  DUCKY (CONT D)
                    On the rope.  Abby found epithelial 
                    tissue.  Still waiting on DNA - 
                    doubt if it's the victim's.

                    for will have a rather nasty rope 
                    burn on one of his hands.

      And off Tony, absorbing this fact...

      INT. NCIS - MTAC - DAY

      Tony suddenly frowns, seeing something for the first time.  
      He rewinds the tape, hits play.  Then hits Freeze Frame. 
      Steps closer to the screen.

      TONY'S POV: Ziva on the gurney.  And holding her hand, 
      Michael Rivkin.

      Tony reacts.

                    Top secret.

      REVEAL Tony and Abby at the computer.

                                  ABBY
                    I'm not even going to ask.
                          (beat)
                    Is this anything to do with Ziva?

                                  TONY
                    You weren't going to ask.

                                  ABBY
                    Okay.  I won't ask.  You tell me.

      A sideways look from Tony as he tries to figure out her 
      logic.  And then the computer CHIRPS as it finds a match.

                                  ABBY (CONT D)
                    Got a match.

      On the screen, Rivkin's screen grab has been matched with a 
      full facial photo of Rivkin.

                    That the answer to the question I'm 
                    not allowed to ask?

                                  TONY
                    Maybe.  Any more photos?

      Abby sighs, hits the keyboard.

      ON THE SCREEN the facial recognition search resumes.

      INT. OSP - OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY

      ON THE TOUCH SCREEN COMPUTER - surveillance footage of 
      Chandler being shot at in downtown L.A.

                                    MCGEE'S VOICE
                    There.  See it?  A flash.

      REVEAL Gibbs, McGee and Sam standing at the Touch Screen 
      computer, reviewing the footage.

                                  SAM
                      Reflection in a shop front window.

                                  MCGEE
                      A reflection of a flash.  Pull up 
                    the bullet trajectory data.

                                  SAM
                    They're all over the place.  No 
                    single source.

                                  MCGEE
                    No single stationary source...but 
                    if the shooter --

                                  SAM
                    -- was in a car...

      Sam drags images across the screen.  McGee marvels.

                                  MCGEE
                    I gotta get one of these, boss.

      Gibbs shoots him a look.

                      I mean...obviously, budgets permitting.      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  46.


      On the screen, nine red laser lines appear, each the 
      projected trajectory of the shots fired.  They appear random.

                                  SAM
                    Flash came from this black SUV.

      Sam inputs the data. Suddenly all the trajectory lines match 
      the movement of the SUV on the surveillance footage.

                                  GIBBS
                    Shooter was in the SUV.

                                  SAM
                    Searching for a clean image...

                                  MCGEE
                    There!

      Sam isolates a frame of the SUV and with a sweep of his hand, 
      expands it to fill the screen, revealing a grainy image of 
      the SUV DRIVER.

                                  SAM
                    That's our shooter.  Maybe even the 
                    mystery man himself.  Liam.

                                  GIBBS
                    Run the SUV's plates.  Send the photo 
                    to Abby.  See what she can make of it.

      As Gibbs talks, Sam pulls up a Mail Server, drags the image 
      into an e-mail, addresses it to Abby and hits send.

                                  SAM
                    On its way.

      And with a final flourish, he shrinks all the data and 
      scatters it across the screen like a deck of cards.

                                  MCGEE
                    I've really gotta get one of these.

      And off Gibbs' look...

                    A real lead?

      She shoots him a dark look.

                                  TONY (CONT D)
                    I mean - really?  A lead.

      EXT. STREET - APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

      A web of SCAFFOLDING clinging to the front of a multi-story 
      apartment building.  A TRUCK half-loaded with scaffolding is 
      parked in front of the building.

      The NCIS SEDAN turns into the street, pulls up outside the 
      building.  Tony and Ziva get out, cross to the truck, Tony 
      trying to appear as if he knows what he's talking about.

                                  TONY
                    Looks like a six-cylinder diesel...

                                  ZIVA
                    Twin turbo four-cylinder.

                                  TONY
                    Right.  

      Moving towards the front of the truck. 

                                  TONY (CONT D)
                    Battery should be somewhere here...

                                  ZIVA
                    Here.

      Ziva is peering up into the engine bay behind the cabin.

                                  TONY
                    There.

                                  ZIVA
                      Twenty-four volt battery.  New.  

      They exchange a look.

                                  STEPHANO'S VOICE
                    Looking for something?

      They both turn to see two men, STEPHANO and BENJI KASS, both 
      in their 30s, exiting the building carrying BOXES OF SCAFFOLD 
      FIXTURES.  Tony steps forward.  Ziva continues looking around.

                                  TONY
                          (badging them)
                    Special Agent Tony DiNozzo, NCIS.  
                    Guess you'd be the Kass boys...This 
                    your rig?

                                  STEPHANO
                    What if it is?      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  49.


                                  ZIVA
                    Tony.

      Tony joins Ziva at a small dumpster.  She pulls on a latex 
      glove, reaches into the dumpster, pulls out a SHOE.

                                  ZIVA (CONT'D)
                      Chandler's left shoe was missing. 

      An exchanged look between the two, then they turn towards the 
      Kass brothers -- Ziva's hand reaching for her SIG.  Stephano 
      suddenly breaks left, Benji darts back into the building.

      Ziva's SIG is in her hand in one fluid motion.

                                  ZIVA (CONT D)
                    Freeze!

      But Stephano has put the truck between the two of them.  As 
      Tony bolts after Benji, Ziva sprints to cut off Stephano.

      They meet at the front of the truck, Ziva getting there a 
      split second before Stephano.  She snaps out her fist, brings 
      him down. Stephano rolls over to find himself looking down 
      the barrel of Ziva's Sig.

                                  ZIVA (CONT D)
                    I'm guessing Stephano.

      Stephano grimaces.

      EXT. RENOVATED BUILDING ROOF - SAME TIME

      Benji barrels up the stairs and onto the roof.  He leaps down  
      onto the partially erected scaffolding.

      Tony reaches the top of the stairs, hears Benji on the 
        scaffolding, charges to the roof's edge and begins to climb 
      down after him.  It creaks in protest and a couple of 
      unsecured pieces go clattering to the ground below. 

      Benji keeps climbing down.  The scaffolding wobbles, more 
      pieces coming away.  Suddenly a large piece of the 
      scaffolding falls away, trapping Benji on a now highly 
      unstable section.  He freezes, aware of the danger.  Tony 
      scrambles down, stops, catching his breath as he realizes 
      Benji's predicament.  

                                  TONY
                    Oops.  Looks like the guys that 
                    erected the scaffolding got a little 
                    careless.  Oh, wait.  That'd be you. 

      He shakes the section he's standing on. It barely rattles.      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  50.


                                  TONY (CONT D)
                    I'm good.  You, not so much.

      Benji glares at him.  Moves.  The whole section wobbles, 
      several more pieces fall away.  Benji grips a support rail as 
      the scaffolding creaks ominously beneath him.  Tony sees a 
      nasty welt running across the back of Benji's hand.

                                  TONY (CONT D)
                    Nasty rope burn.

                                  BENJI
                    You've gotta help me get off this.

                                  TONY
                    You get it when you strung up 
                    Private Chandler?

      Benji glares at him.

                                  BENJI
                    The whole thing is going to come 
                    down.

                                  TONY
                    How much did they pay you?

                                  BENJI
                    Come on man, please...

                                  TONY
                    That what Chandler said when he saw 
                    the jumper leads?

      Tony works himself into a closer position, reaches out.  
      Benji releases his grip, stretches for Tony's hand.  Too far.  
      The shift in his weight causes the scaffolding to lurch 
      again.  Benji stifles a scream.  

                                  TONY (CONT'D)
                    How much?

                                  BENJI
                    Nothing, okay?  We owed him one.  
                    He called us, asked us to pick 
                    Chandler up at the airport.  
                    Emailed us his flight and photo. 

                                  TONY
                    What information was he after?

                                  BENJI
                    I dunno, honest!  He just wanted to 
                    find out if he'd talked to anyone.      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  51.


                                  TONY
                    Had he?

                                  BENJI
                    No.

                                  TONY
                    Your friend's name.

                                  BENJI
                    You don't know what he's like.  
                    He'll kill me.

      The scaffolding creaks loudly.  Tony pulls out his HANDCUFFS.

                                  TONY
                    Don't worry, the fall will kill you 
                    before he does.
                          (beat)
                    Try again.

      Benji stretches out his hand.  Tony leans out, readies the 
      cuffs.

                                  TONY (CONT D)
                    I think it's about to go.  What did 
                    you say his name is?

                                  BENJI
                    Liam!  His name is Liam!

      Tony lunges, snaps one link of the cuff onto Benji's wrist.  
      Benji jumps, the scaffolding creaks and groans, shedding more 
      pieces.  As Benji grabs at the scaffolding, Tony snaps the

                    Just Liam.

      Close, but not close enough.

      Off Tony knowing they've drawn a blank...

                    What about Stephano?

      Macy and Callen enter, crossing to Gibbs.

                    Keep working it, DiNozzo.  Need his 
                    last name.
                          (hangs up - looks to 
                            McGee)
                    Anything?

                    Facial recognition software is 
                    still running on the guy in the 
                    SUV, Boss.  Abby says she'll call 
                    me if she gets a match.

      Gibbs turns to Macy and Callen.

                                  MACY
                    What have you got?

                                  GIBBS
                      Chandler's killers.  Two brothers.  
                    Got a call from 'Liam' in Los 
                    Angeles to meet him at the airport.  
                    They did it as a favor.

                                  MACY
                    Sounds like everyone's scared of 
                    this Liam guy.  No last name?

                                  GIBBS
                    Working on it.

      Kensi enters in a rush, sees that Macy's with Gibbs, stops.  
      Macy senses it's urgent, crosses to talk with her.      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  53.


      Callen and Gibbs exchange a look - both sensing there's 
      something up.

                                  MACY
                    Gibbs, Callen. You'd better hear this.

      And from her tone, they know it's not good.

      INT. OSP OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY

      ON THE MAIN PLASMA - a series of surveillance PHOTOS of Nick 
      Talia at the Diner.

                                    KENSI'S VOICE
                    We got a wire into Talia's car 
                    while he was in the diner with 
                    Callen this morning.

      PHOTOS OF MATTIE RAE in the diner.

      Kensi is working the Touch Screen, Macy, Sam, Callen, Getz 
      and Gibbs getting the briefing.

                                    KENSI'S VOICE (CONT D)
                    Late this afternoon, Talia went 
                    back to the diner - asking 
                    questions about the guy who tipped 
                    him off that Callen is a cop.

      Gibbs glances at Callen, who isn't about to acknowledge it as 
      a failure.

                                    KENSI'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                    Talia got his number. Called him from 
                    his car. Used his speaker phone.

      Kensi pulls up a phone log on the screen - taps it once, 
      pulling up the details of the call.  Hits play.

                                    TALIA'S VOICE
                    Need to speak to Mattie Rae.

                    The diner this morning.  How'd you 
                    know he was a cop?

                                  MATTIE'S VOICE
                    Who is this?

      Silence.

                    Saved me some embarrassment this 
                    morning, know what I mean?  Just like 
                    to know how you knew, that's all.

                                  MATTIE'S VOICE
                    Spent everyday for three weeks 
                    looking at that a-hole across a

                                    TALIA'S VOICE
                    He put you away?

                                  MATTIE'S VOICE
                    Bunch of us.  Five years.

                                    TALIA'S VOICE
                    What for?

                                  MATTIE'S VOICE
                    Dealing.

                                    TALIA'S VOICE
                    Drugs?

                                  MATTIE'S VOICE
                    Guns man.  Gang stuff, you know?  
                    I'm outta that now.

      Talia's voice changes, can't believe his luck.

                                    TALIA'S VOICE
                    But you still know people, right?

                                  MATTIE'S VOICE
                    Sure I know people.

                                    TALIA'S VOICE
                    Good suppliers?

                                  MATTIE'S VOICE
                    Best.  These guys could get you a tank 
                    if you had a big enough suitcase.

                                    TALIA'S VOICE
                    I got a pressing need, a client 
                    looking for some specialized 
                      ordinance. 

                                  MATTIE'S VOICE
                    I don't know man.  Not my thing any

                                    TALIA'S VOICE
                    C'mon, Mattie, work with me.  Look, 
                    this guy, he's cashed up, I don't 
                    want to lose this deal... 

                                  MATTIE'S VOICE
                    Who is this guy?

                                    TALIA'S VOICE
                    His name's Liam.  I'll arrange a 
                    meeting. No harm in meeting with 
                    us, right?  

                                  MATTIE'S VOICE
                    I guess not.

      Kensi hits stop on the Touch Screen.  Macy looks around the 
      room, her gaze settling on Gibbs.

                                  MACY
                    Plan worked. We've got ourselves a 
                    meeting.

      INT. OSP - MEZZANINE - DAY

      Macy in deep conversation with Sam and Kensi down in the 
      atrium.  Gibbs and Callen watching from the mezzanine.

                                  GIBBS
                    She doesn't like to share.

                                  CALLEN
                    Macy's way.  

                                  GIBBS
                    Yours too.

      Callen doesn't give anything away.

                                  CALLEN
                    Least you got an invite to the party.

      McGee approaches.

                                  MCGEE
                    All set, Boss. I'll be in the 
                      operations center.

                                  GIBBS
                    Don't break anything, McGee.
                          (to Callen)
                    I'm with you?      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  56.


                                  CALLEN
                    No. 
                          (beat)
                    I'm with you.

      They both hold the look, Gibbs finally acknowledging Callen's 
      gesture with a small nod.

      INT. OSP OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY

      Screens in surveillance mode - the object of their interest, 
      an empty multi-story PARKING GARAGE.  But not quite empty...

      INTERCUT WITH:

      INT. PARKING GARAGE - MACY'S CAR - SAME TIME

      A big dark SEDAN parked in the shadows at the back of the 
      parking garage.  Macy on her cellphone behind the wheel.  
      Gibbs beside her.  Callen in back. Macy clicks off her phone.

                                  MACY
                    Talia made the call, Liam's on his 
                    way.

                                  GIBBS
                    With friends?

                                  MACY
                    Not too many, I hope.

                                  CALLEN
                    We're missing something.

      Macy catches Callen's eye in the rear vision mirror.

                                  CALLEN (CONT D)
                    Liam stays out of the light.  Moves 
                      cautiously.  Always three moves ahead.

                                  MACY
                    Your point?      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  57.


                                  GIBBS
                    What's he doing coming to a meeting 
                    at short notice.

                                  MACY
                    He's under pressure.  Having to kill 
                    Chandler screwed up his timetable.  
                    Probably had to find that money fast 
                    from some place else.  

                                  CALLEN
                    So there's a ticking clock on the 
                    deal that's making him throw 
                    caution to the wind.

                                  MACY
                    Our advantage.

                                  GIBBS
                    As long as he tells us why.

                    Vehicle entering the building.

      Macy, Callen and Gibbs get out of the car, weapons drawn.

      IN THE OPERATIONS CENTER

      On screen, a big SUV with tinted windows cruises into the 
      parking garage.

                                  KENSI
                    Okay, Talia and Rae can hear him...

      On the screen, Talia and Mattie watch tensely for their first 
      glimpse of the car.

      IN THE PARKING GARAGE

      The Sedan turns into view.  Stops about 30 yards from them.

      Gibbs, Callen and Macy watch from the deep shadows.

      Both front doors open and two men get out - LIAM, late 30s. 
      Ordinary looking.  And a BODYGUARD.  They begin to walk 
      slowly towards Talia and Mattie, who in turn begin to walk 
      towards them.

      On Gibbs, his gut churning.

                                  GIBBS
                          (into his wrist mic)
                    McGee - tight on Liam, tell me what 
                    you see.      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  58.


      Macy shoots a look from Gibbs to Callen.  Callen puts his 
      hand on her arm.  Let him go.  Gibbs' gut is not the only one 
      churning...

      IN THE OPERATIONS CENTER

      McGee ignores Kensi's surprised look and ZOOMS in on Liam, 
      starting at his shoes, panning up his body.

                                  MCGEE
                    Boots, jeans, belt...white t-shirt

                    carrying -

                          (falters)
                    Seems to have a long barrel...

      IN THE PARKING GARAGE

      Gibbs and Callen both react at the same time.

                                  CALLEN
                    It's a hit!

                                  GIBBS
                    Go! Go!

      Gibbs and Callen break cover, Macy a second after them.

      Liam and the Bodyguard have already started to pull out their 
        weapons...BERETTA'S fitted with SILENCERS.

      Mattie reacts with lightening speed, taking Talia down and 
      rolling for cover as Liam and the Bodyguard open fire.

      A rapid exchange of GUNFIRE as Liam and the Bodyguard swing 
      their weapons towards a new threat - Macy, Gibbs and Callen - 
      who all return fire.

      Liam and the Bodyguard go down in a hail of gunfire.

      IN THE OPERATIONS CENTER

      Stunned reactions to what just happened.

      Macy and Gibbs race to Mattie and Talia as a SEDAN roars down 
      a ramp and screeches to a halt.  Sam and an ND AGENT are out 
      fast, guns drawn.  Callen checks Liam and the Bodyguard.  
      Dead before they hit the ground.  He begins searching through 
      Liam's pockets for ID.

      Gibbs levels his gun at Talia and Mattie.

                                  GIBBS (CONT D)
                    Hands where I can see them.

                                  MACY
                          (to Sam)
                    Separate them.

      Sam drags Talia to his feet, marches him back to the car.

                                  SAM
                    Let's go sunshine.

      Gibbs lowers his SIG, then unexpectedly extends his hand to 
      Mattie.

                                  GIBBS
                    Gibbs.

      Mattie grasps his hand.  Gibbs pulls him up.  The helping 
      hand turning into a handshake.

                                  DOM
                    Agent Vaille (pron: VEIL)  Thanks 
                    for being a step ahead.  Semper Fi.

      Gibbs acknowledges the brotherhood of Marines. 

                                  GIBBS
                    Oh-ah.

                                  MACY
                    Nice work, Dom.

      Gibbs shoots a look at Macy.  She holds the look.

                                  MACY (CONT D)
                    Like I said.  My op.

                                  DOM
                    How did you know it was a hit?

                                  GIBBS
                    Weren't armed for protection.  
                    Armed for an execution.  Weapons 
                    were fitted with silencers.      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  60.


                                  DOM
                    But why take Talia and me out?  We 
                    had what Liam wanted.

                                  MACY
                    Only one reason I can think of...  He 
                    got what he wanted somewhere else.

                                  GIBBS
                    You were a loose end.

      Callen steps up, holds up a PLASTIC SECURITY CARD.

                                  CALLEN
                    Hotel on The Strip.

      INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY

      A perfectly normal hotel suite.  A beat, then the door opens 
      and Callen, Gibbs and Macy enter.  They spread out, looking 
      through the room.  Callen opens a wardrobe, finds FOUR LARGE 
      SUITCASES.  Macy and Gibbs stand over him, watching as he 
      opens them, one after the other.  

      Callen stands, holding a small PLASTIC BAG.  He opens it, 
      takes out FOUR PASSPORTS, hands them to Macy and Gibbs.

      CLOSE on the Passports: each one contains a photo of a man of 
      MIDDLE EASTERN ethnicity.  The passports are new, unused.  No 
      stamps. Issued out of CANADA.

                                  MACY
                    Four unused passports and four 
                    suitcases filled with weapons...

      TILT PAN REVEALS the contents of the suitcases:  four ASSAULT 
      RIFLES, SPARE AMMO CLIPS and four neat bundles of C4 and 
      DETONATORS.

                                  GIBBS
                    Hotel's booked for another week.

                                  CALLEN
                    Means whoever Liam was supplying to 
                    is coming to collect this stuff.

                                  MACY
                    Probably never met him.

                                  CALLEN
                    Probably.

      Off the three of them exchanging troubled looks...      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  61.


      INT. ABBY'S LAB - DAY

      Photo recognition software running of the reflected image of 
      Liam, taken from the SUV.

                                  TONY O.S.
                    You get any more hits on our secret 
                    thingy?

      WIDEN to reveal Abby turning as Tony enters.

                                  ABBY
                    Do you know how busy I've been?

                                  TONY
                    Yes, I know how busy you've been.

                                  ABBY
                    Good. I was just asking.
                          (typing)
                    Only one hit.  But it's a doozy.

      She types and up on the plasma screen appears a photo of 
      Michael Rivkin deep in conversation with Eli David.

      Tony reacts.  Stunned.

                                  ABBY (CONT D)
                    Man on the left, Michael Rivkin, 
                    supposed Israeli banker.  And on 
                    his right, the Director of Mossad, 
                    Eli David, also known as -

                                  TONY
                    Ziva's father.

                                  ABBY
                    I wonder if Ziva knows Rivkin?

                                  TONY
                    You don't ask her.  You don't 
                    breathe a word of this, Abby.

      She opens her mouth to comment, but Tony shuts her down.

                                  TONY (CONT D)
                    I mean it.

                                  ABBY
                    Tony, you're scaring me.

      Tony stares at the photo a moment longer, then hits DELETE.  
      A beat, then the computer running the face recognition 
      program begins to CHIRP.      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  62.


      They turn - MATCH FOUND blinks steadily on the other screen.

                                    KENSI'S VOICE
                    Liam Patrick Foyle....

      INT. OSP OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY

      Gibbs, McGee, Getz, Sam and Dom watching as Kensi manipulates 
      the Touch Screen, which includes a passport photo of Liam 
      alongside the photo pulled from the SUV reflection.

                                  KENSI
                    Former IRA arms dealer.

                                  GETZ
                    Irish?

                                  KENSI
                    American citizen.  Born in New York.
                          (beat)
                    Raised money and smuggled arms into 
                    Northern Ireland in the 90s.  After 
                    the peace treaty, he went freelance.  

                                  DOM
                    Looks like he sold weapons 
                      everywhere from Chechyna to the 
                    Horn of Africa.

                    How come we've never heard of this 
                    guy?

                                  GETZ
                    It's called a legend...

      Off Gibbs and McGee's look...

      INT. OSP - WAREHOUSE - DAY

      CLOSE on a driver's licence.  Liam Patrick Foyle...but not 
      Liam's photograph - Callen's.

      WIDEN as an ND AGENT slides the license into a wallet, adds 
      credit cards, cash.  

                                  GETZ'S VOICE
                    ...a false identity - a word coined 
                    by the Stasi, the East German Secret 
                    police back in the Cold War...      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  63.


      ANGLE TO REVEAL Callen, pulling on a jacket, similar to the 
      one Liam was wearing.  Another ND AGENT checks the fit. 

                                  GETZ'S VOICE (CONT D)
                    ...their idea was to create a cover 
                    so deep that it could stand up to 
                    any scrutiny.  

      PULL BACK to reveal the vast warehouse behind Callen.  Rows of 
        vehicles...exotic sports cars, old pick-ups, jet-skis, motor-
      cycles.  ND TECHNICIANS on the move, pushing racks of clothing 
      and trolly's loaded with office equipment and furniture.

                                  GETZ'S VOICE (CONT D)
                      Passports, documents, work 
                      papers...even family histories.  
                    And none of it true...  

      The ND AGENT hands the wallet to Macy, who checks it, hands 
      it on to Callen.  He slips it into his pocket, straightens, 
      takes a breath...

                                  GETZ'S VOICE (CONT D)
                    All a legend...  

      INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY

      Ziva, carrying her shoulder bag, steps into the elevator.  As 
      the doors closes, Tony scrambles in after her.  He's also 
      carrying his shoulder bag.  End of a long day.

                                  TONY
                    Thanks for holding that.

                                  ZIVA
                    You're welcome, Tony.

                                  TONY
                    Never thought I'd say it but I 
                    almost miss McGee.  Almost.
                          (beat)
                    What about you?  Miss him?

                                  ZIVA
                    Yes, I do.

                                  TONY
                    Who else do you miss?  Gibbs?

                                  ZIVA
                    Some.

                                  TONY
                    What about your friend from Tel Aviv.      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  64.

                    Tony -

                                  TONY
                    Hey, just asking, okay?

                                  ZIVA
                    Yes.  I miss Michael too.

                                  TONY
                    When he called the other day, I 
                    thought he must have been here...

                                  ZIVA
                    No.  Sadly Michael is not here.

      She looks ahead, lost in her own thoughts.  

      On Tony, deeply troubled...how much does Ziva really know?

      INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

      Callen gazing out at the city lights...or perhaps his own 
      reflection.  Jazz playing softly on the radio.  A knock on 
      the door.  A moment, to compose himself.  He crosses to the 
      door, checks the security peep-hole, opens the door.

                                  CALLEN
                    I've been expecting you.

      A MAN enters - but we can't see his face.

                                  UNSEEN MAN
                    It's a pleasure to finally meet 
                    you, Liam...

      The UNSEEN MAN turns as Callen closes the door and now we see 
      his face clearly.

      It's Michael Rivkin.

      Off Callen, smiling disarmingly...

                                                                      PHOOF TO BLACK.
