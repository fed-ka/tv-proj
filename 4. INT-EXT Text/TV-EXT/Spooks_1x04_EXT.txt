 
  Footage of a demonstration against the globalisation of 
  trade. 
 
  Intercut footage with photo images and a group of around 
  eight demonstrators, including PETER, ANDREA and AGENT 
  PENGUIN, running down an alleyway, being chased by 
  police. 
 
 
  The group run to the end of the alleyway, where they are 
    confronted by more police officers. They re trapped. 
 
  The Camera s POV rises above the alleyway then zooms into 
  a window high above the street.

  The POV through the binoculars moves onto a young man, 
  who is pumping his fist aloft and shouting. 
 
                                  DANNY (O.S.) 
              I spy ... Mark Develaux of Green Action. 
 
  An ugly, rugby-like maul develops amongst the 
    demonstrators. 
 
                                  DANNY (O.S.)

    DAY 1. 1620 
 
  The binoculars sweep over the group of demonstrators in 
  the alleyway and stop on a man who is wearing a mask and 
    a motorcycle helmet. The helmet has a flaming emblem on 
  it. 
 
                                    ZOE (V.O.) 
            What s happening there? (Into a microphone.) 
                        Tango X, what is happening? 
 
 
  The police are doing their best to arrest the group. One 
  of the demonstrators is in a ski mask with a Penguin on 
  the top of his head. His ears are swathed by a scarf. 
  He s an MI5 Operative being run by DANNY and ZOE. 
   Flaming Helmet  is looking for a way out... 
 
  CLOSE UP on the Operative s ear. 
 
                            ZOE (V.O. DISTORTED) 
                        Tango X are you receiving? 
 
                      AGENT PENGUIN (V.O. DISTORTED.) 
              Yes. It s group of civilians who broke the 
                        cordon. I m with them now. 
 
                            ZOE (V.O. DISTORTED) 
                                Stay with them. 
 
                      AGENT PENGUIN (V.O. DISTORTED) 
                          Sorry didn t receive ... 
 
  The Operative touches his ear. 
 
                              ZOE (V.O DISTORTED) 
                                      (Furious.) 
                                  Don t do that! 
 
 
   Flaming Helmet  is tearing a wire out of the Operative s 
  clothing. 
 
                                 FLAMING HELMET  
              (Turns to a young woman (ANDREA) shouting 
                              above the noise.) 
                                    He s MI5. 
 
  A beat. Then she is waving her hand pointing  Penguin  
  out to all around her, blowing a whistle. 
 
                                        ANDREA 
                Gestapo! (Whistle.) Gestapo! (Whistle.) 
 
    Demonstrators turn toward them. 
 
 
  Delta Blue makes a grab for Flaming Helmet (PETER), who 
  blocks him. 
 
                                 FLAMING HELMET  
            Split up! Split up! (to ANDREA) Not us. Keep 
                                    hold of me! 
 
  He pulls the young woman (ANDREA) after him. 
 
                                 FLAMING HELMET  
                  You you! C mon! C mon! Maul! Maul! 
 
  He takes advantage of the skirmish and, for a moment, 
  there is a break in the police line. Like a good rugby 
  forward he is through the line with ANDREA. 
 
  They run back down the alleyway. 
 
  POV: chasing police. 
 
 
  Police chasing ANDREA and PETER. 
 
  Then suddenly  Flaming helmet  stops dead in his tracks. 
  ANDREA runs on for a bit and stops. The police skid to a 
  halt one falling over. 
 
                                 FLAMING HELMET  
                          Can I have a word gents? 
 
  This rugby playing demonstrator speaks estuary ... He 
  takes off his helmet and is pulling off his mask. 
 
  CUT TO MAIN TITLES: 
 
 
  A smiling PETER SALTER walks towards ANDREA. 
 
                                        PETER 
            Don t take your mask off! They ll be trying 
                            to get a shot of you. 
 
  Now we can have a good look at him: PETER SALTER is a big 
  man, who, though now 47 carries his rugby fitness well. 
  His face is still boyish, a little fleshy; short hair; 
  dark eyes that can stare, look friendly but give 
    absolutely nothing away. He has great charm. 
 
                                        ANDREA 
                        Peter, how do you know that? 
                                    (Terrified.) 
                            Oh god, what are you? 
 
                                        PETER 
                I m a bloody hero darlin . Let s go ... 
 
 
  From HARRY and TOM s POV as they approach JOOLS SIVITER, 
  who stands, legs apart, in a fine overcoat, waiting for 
  them. 
 
  JOOLS is 50: short, squat, red faced, silver grey hair 
  with swirls over his ears. His accent is very high 
  Oxbridge, sometimes squeaky with the odd low brassy note. 
  He booms. He is immaculately well-dressed though there is 
  a raffish whiff of the Turf Club drinker of fine malt 
  about him. His confidence in his own huge intelligence 
  and abilities is massive. His humour consists of 
  relishing the rattling effect he can have on others. He 
  is an upper-class bruiser and twinkles with it. And he 
  and TOM cannot stand each other. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                  Gentlemen a very good evening to you.

  Handshakes. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                              Jools how are you? 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            Very well indeed thank you. And you brought 
                little terrier Tom along as a surprise. 
                                      (Cold.) 
                            Tom, good to see you. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        Jools. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            I thought it d be rather jolly to walk about 
            a bit. Always gives a bit of a frisson don t 
            you find, going amongst the plebs talking of 
                              high state secrets. 
 
  TOM grits his teeth. 
 
                                  JOOLS (CONT D) 
              And if you re good, I may have a bit of a 
                                  treat for you. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                    (Trying hard not to be annoyed.) 
                                        Fine. 
 
  And JOOLS is striding off, fast for a small man. 
 
 
  HARRY, TOM and JOOLS - who is now red with anger. JOOLS 
  can turn fury on or off at will. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            Now you should have asked me if little Tom 
                      here was to be briefed or not. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              It is my decision to use what officers I 
                                        want. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
          With respect it is not your decision to make. 
            I mean are we going to have to come over the 
              river and POTTY TRAIN all you people? MI6 
            runs operations abroad, MI5 at home. English 
              Channel. Calais. Foreign bods and Johnnies                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 23
 

            South - we take care. White cliffs of Dover, 
              all British Irish and assortments North - 
                                  your concern. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            But in this case the undercover officer is 
                              from our Service. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                            He is seconded to us. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                      He ... 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                                      Moment. 
 
  JOOLS hears something in his ear. Touches it. 
 
                                  JOOLS (CONT D) 
                              A jolly bit of news. 
                                    (Cheerfully.) 
                    I m sorry what were you saying? 
 
                                        HARRY 
              He is not seconded to you. It is a joint 
                operation. It s your target but we do the 
                                      legwork. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
          The operation concerns a foreign national. So 
                            we are prima mobile. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  You are what? 
 
                                        JOOLS 
          Oh Tom you spoke. How good to see you working 
                                on your skills. 
 
  TOM is about to say something unforgivable but a drunk is 
  passing. They fall silent. 
 
                                        DRUNK 
                  Evenin  gents great evenin  for it. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                                      Absolutely. 
 
  The drunk passes. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 24
 

                                        HARRY 
            Jools we cannot discuss this in the street 
                                        ... 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            I agree. Don t worry, I know a place where we 
                                can get a drink. 
 
  And JOOLS strides off. 
 
 
  TOM approaches. He drops a supplement from The Evening 
    Standard.. He picks it up, taking the opportunity to turn 
  and look around him. No one is about. He takes out his 
  mobile phone and dials. 
 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  (Into phone.) 
                                  Tell her ... 
                                    (A beat.) 
                                    Never mind. 
 
  Rings off. He goes into the station. 
 
 
  A car parked. Terraced houses. 
 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 40
 

  ZOE and DANNY are observing a bed and breakfast, eighty 
  yards away. There are other cars parked in the road. 
 
    A silence. 
 
  Zoe blows out air, bored. 
 
                                  DANNY (CONT D) 
                    Was there a cashpoint back there? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                    What is it about you and plastic? 
 
                                        DANNY 
            The shrink explained it. When I m unhappy I 
                        have this urge to get money. 
 
  ZOE ignores this, looking away. But DANNY is in a mood to 
  tease her. 
 
                                  DANNY (CONT D) 
                              Earl grey teabags. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                        What? 
 
                                        DANNY 
              You didn t get any. Just one little thing 
                      making me unhappy, that s all. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                Why should I get you earl grey teabags? 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                  I like them. 
 
  A beat. They look out. A man in the street. He stumbles. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                        No. 
 
  They relax. 
 
  But ZOE - who is at heart a serious woman - has risen to 
  DANNY s teasing. 
 
                                        ZOE 
              We have a flat share. We are not married. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 41
 

                                        DANNY 
                  Is Earl Grey teabags married life? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                      Oh yes. 
 
  They start. PETER SALTER has just crossed the road in 
  front of them. He is approaching the B & B. 
 
                                        DANNY 
              He s going into the girl. Note the time. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                    (Stroppily.) 
                    Thank you, Mr. Good-housekeeping. 
 
 
  PETER SALTER walks quickly toward the door of the B & B. 
  He smiles, eyes flickering to one side - he knows he is 
  being watched. 
 
  He opens the door. 
 
 
  ZOE and DANNY cannot escape from their row about the 
  flat. He s not teasing anymore. 
 
                                        DANNY 
          It s just about putting knickers and stuff in 
                              the drawer Zoe ... 
 
  A police car has pulled up. POLICEMEN get out quickly. 
  One knocks on the window. DANNY lowers it. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                        Sod. 
 
                                      POLICEMAN 
            (Heavy flashlight. Through the open window.) 
                        We ve had a complaint, Sir. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                      Complaint? 
 
  The POLICEMAN shines the light onto DANNY s crotch. He 
    instinctively covers himself. 
 
                                      POLICEMAN 
                  There are children about you know. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                      What at one o clock at night? 
 
                                      POLICEMAN 
                            Now don t get funny. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                        Danny! 
 
  They look through the windscreen. With ANDREA on his arm 
  PETER SALTER is walking briskly away from the B & B. Not 
  looking back he raises a hand with a wave.

                                      POLICEMAN 
            Could you please arrange your clothing and 
                          get out of the car, Sir. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                      My clothes aren t unarranged! 
 
                                        ZOE 
                            We are MI5 officers. 
 
                                      POLICEMAN 
                                Oh yes, madam? 
 
                                        DANNY 
                              (Slamming the wheel.) 
                                  Fuck you fuck! 
 
                                      POLICEMAN 
              Right that s it! Out of the vehicle NOW! 
 
 
  PETER and ANDREA hastening along, behind them in the 
  distance DANNY and two POLICEMEN are struggling with each 
  other and ZOE is shouting  Danny! Danny!  
 
  They turn a corner and break into a run. 
 
  She stops. 
 
                                        ANDREA 
                                (Out of breath.) 
                                        Peter. 
 
  He stops. 
 
                                        PETER 
                                        What? 
 
                                ANDREA (CONT D) 
                        Why do you want to do this? 
 
                                        PETER 
                              We ve got to move! 
 
                                        ANDREA 
                                      Tell me. 
 
  He tries to pull her. She grabs a corner of wall. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 44
 

                                        PETER 
                              Don t be stupid ... 
 
                                        ANDREA 
                        I won t take you to Istvan. 
 
  PETER takes a breath. He speaks urgently to her, his face 
  a few inches from hers. 
 
                                        PETER 
            Bush is coming here to stitch up the world, 
          our world in ways we won t even know about. I 
                want to do something about it, right? 
 
                                        ANDREA 
                                        And? 
 
                                        PETER 
                          What do you mean  and ? 
 
          But she glares, she s not going to relent. He 
              glances down the street as he stumbles into 
          his explanation. He begins hesitantly. He has 
              never articulated these thoughts before. 
                Under this pressure they clarify and he 
              becomes more and more urgent, until he s 
                    burning with a new found fervour.. 
 
                                        PETER 
              I think something new and very, very shitty 
          is happening to us. We ve lost control of the 
              world. Governments don t work anymore. The 
                power s with the brand names, the giant 
              international companies... They re the new 
            masters, and they re undemocratic and out of 
            control. I m just a two-bit spook, I m not a 
                political thinker. But I m closer to our 
            rulers than some and I can smell the panic. 
              The planet s being taken by a new kind of 
              Empire, it s a monster, it has its own life 
            ... the Global Empire of money markets, mad 
            wealth and poverty, well I want to do my bit 
              to give the world back to the multitudes. 
                                  (Then a grin.) 
                  Now can we avoid getting arrested? 
 
  A moment. And she s won over. 
 
                                        ANDREA 
                                        Let s. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 45
 

  She takes his hand and they run. 
 
 
  They come round a corner. The tube is closed, no one is 
  about. 
 
  A big four wheel drive. She leads him over to it. Tinted 
  dark glass. A door is opened. There is a driver and a 
  young man in the back: he s HORST - slight German accent, 
  short hair, parka, good country trousers and boots. 
 
                                        HORST 
            Andrea get in the front. Peter, in with me. 
 
  The four wheel drive pulls off. 
 
 
  The side of a small workshop. There is a bin. She puts 
  the clothes and the mobile in them. She runs back toward 
  the car. 
 
 
  PAN slowly towards the bin where PETER s stuff was 
  dumped. His mobile is ringing. 
 
 
  PETER gets out of the fourwheel. He is an odd figure: a 
  blanket with a parka over it, no trousers, Wellington                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 50
 

  boots. 
 
  PETER looks about him. ANDREA smiles at him. 
 
                                        PETER 
                              Where are we? Wales? 
 
                                        HORST 
                            Why do you think that? 
 
                                        PETER 
            Sense of Geography, goes with my trade, old 
                                        thing. 
 
                                        ANDREA 
            Well here he is. Do we introduce him to our 
                        comrade or not? Those for? 
 
  They hesitate. ANDREA raises her hand. All but two raise 
  their hands. 
 
                                        ANDREA 
                                      Against? 
 
  HORST and one other raise their hands. 
 
                                        PETER 
            Call a vote every minute of the day do you? 
 
                                        HORST 
                    It s called anarchy.  Old thing.  
 
  ANDREA turns and tramps off. PETER follows her, grinning 
  at HORST. 
 
  CROSS FADE TO: 
 
 
  PETER and ANDREA approach a white van parked in the 
    undergrowth. The back door of the van opens. 
 
 
  They have been working for hours. The back doors are 
  open. The group is crouched twenty yards off. They are 
  cooking - calor gas stoves, not fires. ANDREA is bringing 
  them coffee. PETER has ingratiated himself. There is an 
    atmosphere of enthusiasm. 
 
                                        ISTVAN 
                The corner of the garden of 10 Downing 
              Street. See? There! Three cameras ... Two 
              turn ... There ... The third ... There ... 
              And for five seconds there is a gap. One 
            metre wide. One of us could get over the wall 
                                into the garden. 
 
                                        PETER 
                                        Why? 
 
                                        ISTVAN 
            Because... look. There are no cameras on the 
                                      windows. 
 
                                        ANDREA 
                                Grappling hooks. 
 
                                        ISTVAN 
              Yes. We can throw grappling hooks to the 
            windows, break in. A little mountaineering. 
                            To the summit meeting. 
 
  They are pleased with this, smiles. 
 
                                        PETER 
                                        And? 
 
                                        ISTVAN 
              We will reach the cabinet room. The most 
                  powerful room in your country. Chain 
              ourselves to the legs of the famous table. 
 
                                        PETER 
            I don t doubt you ve got the balls to do it.                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 58
 

                        But what will you achieve? 
 
                                        ISTVAN 
            We will raise consciousness. In the public 
                                        mind. 
 
                                        PETER 
                                      (Scoffs.) 
            Nothing will piss off the  public mind  more 
              than - forgive me - a bunch of foreigners 
            busting into the Prime Minister s house after 
                      trampling over his flowerbeds. 
                                      (Angrily) 
              It s stupid, it s crass, it s infantile. 
 
                                        ISTVAN 
                              (An annoyed edge.) 
            Then, since you come so fresh to the cause, 
                              what do you suggest? 
 
                                        PETER 
                              (Straight passion.) 
            If you want to change the world, really give 
                      the powers-that-be a fright. 
 
  A stunned moment in the group. 
 
                                        ANDREA 
                      And how do we do that, Peter? 
 
  A big grin from PETER as he reaches for the laptop. 
 
                                        PETER 
            Let me amaze you with the vulnerability of 
                              the modern world. 
 
 
  ZOE walks through the woodland. She comes to a tree. 
 
  Its sight-lines are obscured. She looks around to check 
  she is unobserved. 
 
 
  ZOE looks down on the ground. There is a large dog turd. 
  She picks it up. 
 
 
  ZOE has the turd in her fingers. She clicks it open. It s 
  plastic. There is a small piece of paper inside. She 
  takes it out. 
 
  CLOSE UP: The paper. It reads  Graveyard.  
 
 
  ZOE approaches. She sits on a bench. Takes out 
  sandwiches. Glances at her watch. 
  TESSA sits down beside her. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 61
 

                                        TESSA 
                                    Hello Zoe. 
 
  ZOE is startled. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                  What happened? Where s Billy Turner? 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                    He s here. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                  I don t get it. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                      Oh don t go wobbly on me Zoe. 
 
                                        ZOE 
            There is no Billy Turner? You re running a 
                      phantom agent? God Tessa, why? 
 
  TESSA is blithe. She enjoys this - the risk, the elegance 
  of the revelation. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                For the money. I pocket his sweeteners. 
 
  ZOE is horrified. 
 
                                  TESSA (CONT D) 
              He s not the only one I ve got. There are 
                                    lots more. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                        That is so, so dangerous ... 
 
                                        TESSA 
              They re all in odd corners. I thought Billy 
            was safe, no one would take any notice of a 
            stupid little anarchist group. Then all this 
            business started. Oh well, I think I ll kill 
                        him. Can I have a sandwich? 
 
  In shock ZOE hands her the sandwich box. TESSA slips an 
  envelope into it. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                  What s that? 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 62
 

                                        TESSA 
                                    Ten grand. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                      Ten ... 
 
                                        TESSA 
            I m going to have to cut you in, aren t I? 
              Report to Harry that Billy Turner didn t 
                                        show. 
 
                                        ZOE 
            Why are you so sickeningly confident I ll go 
                                along with this? 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                      I m not. 
 
  TESSA smiles, stands and walks away. The camera goes with 
  her. On her face, pleasure - she loves the buzz of 
  danger. 
 
 
  The group around calor gaz stoves. An intense 
    conspiratorial atmosphere. ISTVAN VOGEL, HORST, PETER and 
  ANDREA sit together. 
 
  A beat. 
 
                                        HORST 
                          Will people get killed? 
 
                                        PETER 
                    Not if we make the warning clear. 
 
  Everyone is stunned, serious.

              That is the plan, brought to us by our new 
                    comrade. The moment has come. For?

  All but two raise their hands. ISTVAN raises his. The 
  reluctant two - one of them HORST - raise theirs. 
 
                                        PETER 
                      Right. Two volunteers please. 
 
  A smiling ANDREA is looking at him. 
 
 
  A very modern University Campus. Only a few students 
  about. 
  A block with a notice before it:  Arts And Humanities . 
 
  PETER, ANDREA and HORST cross a paved area to an exit 
  door. PETER breaks in, using wired cards. 
 
 
  The campus is in the distance, lit up. ANDREA, ISTVAN and 
  HORST crouch in the bushes. They have the stolen computer 
  towers with them. In the distance there are sounds of 
  police sirens. 
 
                                        HORST 
              They re calling in police. Look, he s not 
                                      coming. 
 
                                        ISTVAN 
                                  (To Andrea.) 
                                We have to go. 
 
                                        ANDREA 
                            We can t leave Peter. 
 
                                        HORST 
                            (The computer towers.)                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 67
 

                              What about these? 
 
                                        ISTVAN 
                          Throw them in the canal. 
 
                                        ANDREA 
                                  He s a hero! 
 
                                        ISTVAN 
                        The movement has no heroes. 
 
  She turns on him with a furious look.
