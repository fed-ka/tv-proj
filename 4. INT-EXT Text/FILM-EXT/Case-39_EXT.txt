An old VOLVO WAGON skirts rush hour traffic on Wilshire.
Faded red paint. Ski rack on the roof. An ancient
bumpersticker says Educate.
4.
Emily's red Volvo wagon turns in the drive of a single-person
home she rents in a working-class neighborhood.
A dark, rundown family home on a once-prosperous cul de sac.
Emily pulls up. Gets out. Checks that she has the right
address. Halfway up the walk something stops her dead in her
TRACKS -
A WOMAN'S FACE
staring at her through one of the lacy white curtains
upstairs. Ghostly pale. Gone as soon as she sees it. Emily
stands frozen for a moment. Walks on.
She reaches to knock on the door and it opens abruptly, the
security chain snapping taut. A woman's voice growls at her
from the darkness inside:
WOMAN'S VOICE
What?
EMILY
Emily Jennings. Child Services? We
spoke on the phone...?
Peering through the crack is the pallid, bony face from the
upstairs window. Lucy's mother. MARGARET SHERIDAN.
MARGARET
You said the seventeenth.
EMILY
Today is the seventeenth.
MARGARET
Is not.
EMILY
I'm sorry, but it is.
MARGARET
Friday was the thirteenth.
Emily, rather amazed at the conversation she's having, takes
a newspaper from her bag. Indicates the date.
EMILY
Friday was the fourteenth, that makes
today the seventeenth. Monday the
seventeenth. The date of our
appointment.
The door closes in Emily's face. What the hell? Then we
hear the chain unlock. It opens again.
8.
And we get our first good look at Lucy's mother. Gaunt.
Pale. Dark rings under her eyes. She steps aside, not
welcoming Emily in, merely allowing her to enter.
Children waiting for the bus after school. Talking,
laughing. Lucy stands apart, tired and solemn. The bus
pulls up to the curb. As she goes to get on:
EMILY (O.S.)
Lucy.
She turns. Emily behind her.
EMILY
I just wanted you to know I haven't
forgotten about you. I'm doing
everything I can.
Lucy hugs her, clinging for a moment.
LUCY
If I disappear will you come look for me?
18.
EMILY
You're not going to disappear.
LUCY
If I do?
Emily holds her gaze, seeing the fear. Backing away, Lucy
indicates the bus.
LUCY
I have to go. They get mad when I miss
the bus.
Lucy turns to go. Emily watches. Helpless.
EMILY
Lucy, wait...
Takes her cell phone from her bag. Puts her number on speed
dial.
EMILY
If anything happens, call me, okay? Just
press this. Don't let your parents know
you have it.
Tucks the cell phone in Lucy's coat pocket.
EMILY
I'm gonna get you out of there, I
promise.
Lucy boards the bus. Waves to Emily from a back window as it
drives away. Emily waves back, heart in her throat. Might
be the last time she sees her alive.
Emily fumbles with her keys. Gets the right one in the door.
Opens it. Jumps in. Starts the engine. Peels off down the
road.
Emily's car lurches to a stop out front. As she jumps out,
Barron's pickup arrives. He joins her, a reluctant
accomplice.
BARRON
What are we doing here?
EMILY
Saving her life!
She goes up the walkway. Barron lagging a few steps behind,
eyeing the darkened house.
BARRON
They're asleep.
EMILY
They're not asleep.
Emily hears something inside the house.
EMILY
Did you hear that?
BARRON
I didn't hear anything.
Emily, trusting her gut, starts pounding on the door.
EMILY
Leave her alone!
Clearly audible outside, it makes Barron jump.
EMILY
Did you hear that?!
Barron pounds his big fist on the door.
BARRON
Police, open up!
EMILY
Break it down!
Barron rams his shoulder against the door, but it holds
solid.
Emily, hysterical, knowing they're too late:
EMILY
BREAK IT DOWN!
Barron walks Emily to her car. She's outraged.
EMILY
Steal a pizza, San Quentin, try killing
your kid, Freudian dream analysis.
BARRON
Well, you're gonna hate me for saying
this, but my money's on crazy.
EMILY
Did they or did they not know what they
were doing? That's the legal standard.
They knew, they knew damn well!
BARRON
It's not that simple sometimes.
EMILY
(stops on a dime)
Meaning what exactly?
Barron hesitates. He's crossing the line by telling her
this.
BARRON
When we brought them in that night they
told Captain Lister... They think she's
evil, some kind of demon spirit, minion
of the devil or something.
EMILY
(LAUGHS)
Oh, that's great - what is this, late-
night cable?
BARRON
No, but that might be the world they're
living in.
No frills, purely functional housing. Emily comes up the
steps with Lucy and knocks. The COORDINATOR answers. A kind
but beleagured-looking woman of fifty, who is surprised to
see them.
COORDINATOR
They were supposed to call you. We don't
have any rooms.
EMILY
Nothing?
COORDINATOR
There was a mixup with the dates. Sorry.
Emily rolls her eyes. Lucy standing there holding a
suitcase.
Dark, abandoned. Emily's Volvo pulls up.
Emily signs a form as he unlocks the door, letting her in.
EMILY
I have to grab some of her things, might
take me a minute.
COURT CLERK
I trust ya, Em, make sure you lock it on
the way out.
A police perimeter around a small house in a tough low-income
neighborhood. Cops and crime scene investigators on the
scene. Local news media broadcasting live. A couple of news
choppers hovering overhead.
Emily pulls up, jumps out of her car. Mike Barron waves off
the uniformed officer who moves to intercept her as she comes
up the walkway to the house.
EMILY
What happened?
BARRON
Sure you want to see this?
With an uncertain nod she follows him inside.
Emily and Barron come down the steps.
EMILY
Where is he now?
BARRON
Juvie lockup. And, no, I'm not taking
you to see him.
EMILY
You want to know what happened?
BARRON
I know what happened.
EMILY
I don't. I need to talk to him. Mike,
please, I care about this kid.
35.
Doug tenderly consoles Emily. Has his arms around her.
They're leaning against the railing, wind on their faces.
DOUG
Every family you sit down with every day
of every week is a family in crisis.
Those are your odds. That's the job you
do. Trying to beat them.
Wipes away her tears. The hair from her face.
DOUG
You're one person, Em. You can't save
the world.
(THEN)
I know somebody you did save.
36.
Lucy on the beach below, walking barefoot at water's edge,
hem of her dress in her hands. Emily watches her and,
finding solace in it, leans into Doug's embrace and closes
her eyes.
The plaintive cries of seagulls overhead as Emily and Lucy
walk along the surf at sundown, Emily barefoot now as well.
LUCY
You okay?
Emily nods, putting on a brave face to spare Lucy.
EMILY
It's just work. Don't worry.
Lucy nods okay. They walk on in silence for a moment.
LUCY
Why do you do it if it makes you sad?
EMILY
My job? I don't know, I guess... I guess
maybe I want to believe families can
work, so I can have my own someday, I
don't know - does that make sense?
Lucy nods, takes her hand. They walk off up the beach
together.
Emily knocking on the door of his Marina Del Rey townhouse.
EMILY
Doug, it's me, it's Emily...
No answer.
She comes down the steps to his car, walks past it and then
stops, noticing the window is open a crack. Slipping her
hand inside, stretching, she extends one finger just far
enough to push the button on the garage door remote clipped
to the sunvisor.
Up the drive, the door starts to open.
56.
A bell TOLLS in a steeple.
Down below, Emily is going against the tide, walking up the
steps past CHURCHGOERS who are coming down after morning
mass. Halfway up, she runs into Mike Barron and his wife and
son. It's awkward, more for her than him.
BARRON
Emily...?
EMILY
Mike.
Sitting on a bench in a park that occupies the shadow of the
old stone church, Emily and Mike talk privately. His wife
pushing his young son on a playground swing.
EMILY
`No such thing as a bad kid, only bad
parents.' I always believed that. It's
a lie. Her parents aren't crazy.
BARRON
You wanna end up where they did keep
talking like this.
(off her look)
I'm not judging you. You're grieving for
Doug and you're still confused about what
Diego did.
EMILY
Aren't you?
BARRON
Diego grew up in a bad home, he saw
violence and he repeated it, that's the
cycle, you know that better than anyone.
73.
EMILY
Why did she lie about calling him?
BARRON
`Cause she's a liar, that doesn't mean
she made him do it. Look, let me tell
you what Lucy is. Lucy is a damaged
child, a deceitful child, a manipulative
child. But a damaged, deceitful,
manipulative child is not a demon. Ask
my brother-in-law, he's got a couple of
`em.
Barron stands from the bench.
EMILY
Mike, you know I'm not crazy. Don't run
away from something just because it
scares you.
His concern edges toward sadness. He indicates the church.
BARRON
I stopped you on the steps. I think
maybe you oughta go all the way in.
Walks off to rejoin his wife and son. Emily alone on a bench
in the shadow of a church.
Emily knocking on a door in an outside hallway. It opens.
It's the girl from the bar. BECCA. The friend. Not
expecting her.
BECCA
Emily...
Dashes from the house into the abandoned street. Running in
the rain. Margaret comes crashing out of the house, chasing
her down the middle of the street.
Emily sees a city bus parked up ahead. Makes a run for it.
A metro transit bus idling along the curb. The DRIVER with
his feet up between shifts, reading a porno mag. Emily comes
running up to the door. Pounds frantically on the glass.
EMILY
Help me! Please!
The driver meets eyes with her through the door. Keeps
reading. Unimpressed. More pounding from Emily.
EMILY
Let me on!
The driver points to the sign above the door: OUT OF SERVICE.
Keeps reading. Emily near hysterics at this point. Margaret
closing in fast.
EMILY
She's coming! Please!
The driver sighs, weighing his obligations. Emily spins,
back to the door. Margaret nearly upon her, ten feet away,
five, four...
With a hydraulic HISS the bus releases its brakes and diesels
off down the empty street. Emily stands alone. Rain-soaked.
Shivering. Staring at her house down the block.
The SILHOUETTE OF A CHILD in the window.
Walks slowly from her cubicle. Comes along the row of
darkened cubicles, following the sound to its source. This
is the one. She looks in.
84.
Empty cubicle. TURNING CHAIR.
Emily backs away. Terrified. The chair winding slowly to a
stop.
Suddenly, behind her, at the far end of the office, a
different NOISE splits the silence. Emily turns and stares
toward the sound. The XEROX MACHINE. Someone is using it.
EMILY
Hello...?
No answer.
Emily comes slowly down the aisle to the partitioned
workstation. A torturous walk set to the RHYTHMIC CADENCE of
the photocopier, the HARSH GREEN LIGHT SWEEPING ACROSS THE
CEILING ABOVE IT, again and again and again...
And then it stops, ejecting one final page as Emily enters
the workstation. And sees there's no one there.
She stares at the idle machine for a moment, then at the
STACK OF COPIES lying upsidedown in the tray. She comes
over, picks them up. Turns them over.
The first page is a photocopy of a PAIR OF HANDS PRESSED FLAT
AGAINST THE COPYING GLASS.
Emily stares, haunted. Tense breath. Continues through the
stack.
Successive pages show the same two hands, but leaning forward
into the inky blackness between them is a FACE, its features
resolving into murky focus as it approaches the glass. The
last page is a horrific image. A man screaming in such
terror that his face appears almost deformed.
It's DOUG. The night of his death. Like a snapshot from his
bathroom mirror.
Emily shudders, the stack of pages tumbling to the floor.
Runs out. And we see the photocopies, lying on the floor,
are totally BLANK...
Emily comes down the steps, past the morning paper on the
walkway. Stops dead in her tracks. Stunned. Comes back and
picks it up.
A SMALL PHOTO OF EDWARD ON THE FRONT PAGE WITH A HEADLINE:
HOSPITAL PROBES DEATH.
At the bus stop at the end of the street, Lucy mingles
happily with other CHILDREN. She meets Emily's gaze down the
length of the sidewalk. Smiles and waves goodbye as she gets
on the school bus.
A high-rise hotel in downtown Los Angeles.
Smoke swirling past her, she exits the house, locking the
front door behind her. She backs away and watches it burn,
holding her fish tank, the only thing she saved.
TIME CUT TO:
Billowing black smoke. The house fully engulfed as fire
engines arriving on the scene, sirens wailing. Emily
watching with neighbors on the sidewalk as the FIREFIGHTERS
uncoil their hoses.
The window to Lucy's bedroom is a bright red square, an
inferno. And as Emily stares at it, disbelieving what she's
done, the figure of a CHILD appears.
LUCY
Her whole body ablaze. Horrific. She just stands there,
arms at her sides, burning.
Just now the FIRE MARSHALL crosses to the onlookers. Hollers
over the noise and commotion:
FIRE MARSHALL
Everybody get out okay?!
Emily wavers, not sure what to say. The Fire Marshall sees
her indecision.
FIRE MARSHALL
This your house?!
(she nods yes)
Anybody else inside?!
(off her hesitation)
Ma'am...?!
Emily opens her mouth to reply, but sees something behind her
that closes her throat.
LUCY
standing on the sidewalk in her pajamas. Unscathed.
FIRE MARSHALL
Anyone else inside?! Yes or no?!
Emily, in shock, shakes her head no. The Fire Marshall
rushes off, walkie-talkie squawking. Emily stands frozen as
Lucy comes through the crowd to her. More dismayed than
angry.
106.
LUCY
That was mean.
She takes Emily's hand. Together they watch the house burn.
Firelight playing on their faces. The fish bouncing off the
glass in the tank at Emily's feet.
The car tears through a chainlink fence and leaps off the
high embankment into the water.
Ambulances. Patrol cars. Paramedics. Onshore, drying off
with a towel, talking to a uniformed officer is the PASSERBY
who saved Lucy's life.
PASSERBY
Right through the guardrail, never
touched the brakes...
Emily goes by on a gurney, semi-conscious, oxygen mask over
her face. Paramedics checking her vitals.
Loaded into the ambulance, she meets the gaze of Lucy who is
being attended to by a female PARAMEDIC, who puts her arm
around Lucy in a maternal gesture, shielding her from the
sight of Emily as Emily did of the Sheridans.
PARAMEDIC
Don't look at her, okay? Just don't even
look.
Lucy nods, the innocent victim. Clinging to her protector as
she watches the ambulance take Emily Jennings away.
CUT TO:
A TELEVISION - NEWS FOOTAGE
of Lucy wrapped in a blanket sitting beside the female
paramedic in an ambulance. Shivering. Wet-hair clinging to
her face. Portrait of a child victim.
NEWS REPORTER
A remarkable story of survival this
morning as a young girl is pulled from
the Los Angeles reservoir in an accident
police are calling suspicious...
110.
INSTITUTIONAL PATIENTS watching tv in the psych hospital rec
room. Slouched on the vinyl sofa, watching without
comprehension, heavily sedated, Margaret Sheridan.
Lucy walks a private road through sunlit forest with a kind
RETIRED COUPLE. Temporary guardians who've taken her in for
the weekend.
LUCY
Why can't I live with you?
RETIRED WOMAN
Oh, darling, we're not foster parents, we
just help out when the system's full.
111.
RETIRED MAN
They'll contact us, Lucy, when your
placement comes through.
The woman puts her arm around her as they walk on.
RETIRED WOMAN
Some nice family that always wanted a
little girl.
Lucy smiles, shy, innocent, quietly taking in the scenery.
