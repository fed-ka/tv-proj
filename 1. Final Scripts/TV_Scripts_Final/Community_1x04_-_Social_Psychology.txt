lesson.  *

SR. CHANG

we wrap up, I d like to thank you *
for filling out your anonymous *
evaluation cards.  I found your *
suggestions to be largely *
constructive and flattering.  But *
there was one of you whose *
evaluation was so harsh, I took the *
time to analyze the person s *

JEFF and SHIRLEY walk in the same direction down the hall.  

SHIRLEY
Nice day out today, isn t it?

JEFF

Yeah.  Oh.  Damn.

Jeff starts back towards the classroom as Shirley walks off. 
He runs into BRITTA.

Jeff and Britta walk together, out of the school building and 
onto the quad. *

BRITTA
I find Shirley very easy to talk 
to.  And aren t you supposed to 
have, like, an olympic gold medal 
in jibber jabber?

JEFF
Yeah, but I m a sprinter, I m at my 
best during high speed bursts of 
wit.  You lock me into Shirley s 
stride for a marathon banter about 
her brownies?  The awkward silence 
is going to set in before we pass 
the stoner tree.

We see a tree where stoners are hanging out.  VAUGHN, a hot, 
laid-back guy, plays hackey sack with no socks on and his *
shirt in his back pocket.

VAUGHN
Hey, Britta.  Hi.   Sup?

BRITTA
Hey, Vaughn.  How s it going?

VAUGHN
No worries.

JEFF
(to Britta)
Interesting.  Cause I might worry 
if I played hackey sack a decade *
too late.

BRITTA
My class is this way.*

JEFF*
Alright, but I just wanted to point *
out that we easily walked more than *
a hundred yards without a single *
awkward pause, and that s the mark *
of a true friend.  So, nice walking *
with you, friend.*"Community" - #104 - "Social Psychology" - Pink Revised -  8/24/09      2A.

second year students, but I had a *
4.0 at Riverside High, and I m not *
looking down on this school at all, *
but I m only here because of a  *
brief addiction to pills that I was *
told would help me focus but they *
actually made me lose my *
scholarship and virginity.  If I *
could take your lab early, it would *

Jeff, ABED, PIERCE, Shirley, and TROY at a table near the 
coffee stand.  Jeff looks on as Britta stands in the coffee 
line talking with Vaughn.  Pierce makes a meal out of opening 
his express package.

PIERCE
What could this express package be?  
Someone needed to get me something fast.

SHIRLEY
You brought your mail to campus?

PIERCE
Didn t have time to open it at home.

JEFF
Plus, if you opened it at home, we 
wouldn t be able to see whatever it 
is you want us to see.

PIERCE
(opening package)
Oh, yes.  My Ear-Noculars.

JEFF
Perfect.

TROY
What is that?  It looks like your 
Bluetooth thingie.

Pierce turns his head.  He has a Bluetooth headset in one ear.

PIERCE
No no no.  This is my cell phone 
headset.  This is Ear-Noculars. 
It s for spies and what have you.  
It gives you sonic hearing.

ABED
All hearing is sonic.

PIERCE
(not hearing)
What s that?

JEFF
You might want to take that ear 
thing for a spin.

Pierce looks through the Ear-Noculars literature. "Community" - #104 - "Social Psychology" - Pink Revised -  8/24/09      5.

ABED
Oof.  Tomorrow?  They re showing 
all four Indiana Jones s at The 
Vista.  I was really looking 
forward to the first three.  I 
bought a whip.

She stops walking and turns to face him, with puppy dog eyes.

ANNIE
This is really important to me, 
Abed.  Could you please go as my 
friend.  My really good friend?

ABED
Wow, I didn t realize we were really 
good friends.  I figured we were more 
like Chandler and Phoebe.   They 
never really had stories together.  
Sure, I ll do it, Chandler. 

ANNIE
(hugging Abed)
Oh, thank you, Abed. 

SHIRLEY
That s nice. 

Off Shirley s  that s nice,  Jeff looks for Britta and 
notices she s still talking with Vaughn.  

JEFF

I better save Britta from that 
dude.

SHIRLEY
Yeah, she looks like she s in 
trouble.  I hope he doesn t

Tight, yes.  I ve heard that about 
green tea.

Britta doesn t look at Jeff.  She smiles at Vaughn.

BRITTA
I like green tea.  I should make 
the change.

Back at the table, Pierce observes Britta and speaks 
studiously while touching his bionic ear.

PIERCE
Britta s making the change to green 
tea.

that the experiment will start in 
five minutes.  

A smiling Annie crosses to the door.

from a smile to a serious face. She opens the door into the 
waiting room.

Jeff exits the school building with Shirley and some other 
students.  He bends down to tie his shoe, hoping Shirley will 
keep walking.  When he stands, she is right there.

after class?  I m sure you didn t

Jeff starts walking with her.

fast for these dogs.

The walk is even slower.  Long, awkward silence.  They both *
try to break it.

Oh, and how about that Hackey Sack 
guy?  Always around, flirting with 
Britta.  It s embarrassing. 

JEFF*

I know!  He s the worst!*

SHIRLEY*
I mean, what is with that hair?

JEFF
It s perpetually moist.  And the 
incessant evangelizing of green 
tea.  No offense, but if I want 
medical advice, I ll get it from 
someone wearing socks.

Shirley loves that one.  They continue gabbing.*

Prof. Duncan stands in front of the monitor.  He checks his 
watch.

attention to every subject s

ANGLE ON the monitor: Prof. Duncan fast forwards the tape.  
We start with a room full of subjects.  Over time, we see 
Annie pop in and out of the room.  One after another, 
frustrated subjects get up and leave.  (The research 
assistants take notes.)

sees)

stomper... This one s a screamer...

he just hit that girl... 

On the tape, all that remain now are Abed and Troy.  Abed 
remains motionless while Troy slowly melts down and exits.  *
Abed is the only one left.  He sits patiently, hands folded 
in his lap.  Prof. Duncan leans closer to the screen.

Ah, I ve seen this before.  The 
longer they wait, the harder they 
break.  Buckle up, students.

Does he have a whip?

Shirley and Jeff sit on the bench, laughing.

Hackey Sack takes his shirt off?  *
