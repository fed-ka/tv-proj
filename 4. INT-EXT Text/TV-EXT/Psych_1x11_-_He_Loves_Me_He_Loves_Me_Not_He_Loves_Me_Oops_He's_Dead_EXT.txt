      HENRY is seated at the kitchen table when YOUNG SHAWN enters, 
      shielding his face and attempting to sneak past Henry without 
      being noticed.  As he rounds the corner, his back to Henry, 
    it appears as if he was successful, until...

                                  HENRY
                    Shawn.  Stop.  Turn around.

      Young Shawn freezes but doesn t turn around.

                                  HENRY (CONT D)
                    Turn around.  What are you hiding?

      Young Shawn turns to face his Dad, and reveals a large black 
      shiner on his eye.

                                  HENRY (CONT D)
                    Shawn, did you get into a fight?

                                  YOUNG SHAWN
                    Kinda.

                                  HENRY
                    Kinda?What does that mean, kinda? 
                    What did I tell you about fighting? 
                    Now come on, get over here.  Let me 
                    take a look.

      Young Shawn steps to the table.  Henry examines his son s 
      eye.  He gets up, goes the freezer and returns with a bag of 
      frozen peas.

                                  HENRY (CONT D)
                          (patting his eye with 
                          peas)
                    Shawn, this was some nasty punch 
                    you took!  What was this kid s 
                    name?

                                  YOUNG SHAWN 
                            (sheepishly)
                    Elizabeth.  

                                  HENRY
                    Shawn, you got into a fist fight 
                    with a girl?!

                                  YOUNG SHAWN
                    No, it wasn t a fight.  She just 
                    punched me.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    PSYCH - Episode 1014 "He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not..." - Studio/Network Draft 9/14/06     2.

                                  HENRY
                    Why in the world would she just 
                    punch you?  What happened?

                                  YOUNG SHAWN
                    I m not even sure and I was there!  
                    She asked me to sit next to her at 
                    lunch and I did.  Then I was eating 
                    my tatertots.  Then she punched 
                    me. 

                                  HENRY
                    Wait, what was shedoing while you 
                    were eating your tatertots.

                                  YOUNG SHAWN
                    She was talking about something.

                                  HENRY
                    What?  What was she talking about?

                                  YOUNG SHAWN
                    I have no idea, she just went on 
                    and on.  I was concentrating on my 
                    tatertots. 

                                  HENRY
                          (slow smile)
                    Well, I ll be damned.  I know what  
                    happened.  Shawn, you just had your 
                    first date.

                                  YOUNG SHAWN
                    My first, what?

                                  HENRY
                    Shawn, this Elizabeth girl likes
                    you.  She asked you to sit with her 
                    because she thinks you are cute.  

                                  YOUNG SHAWN
                    Then why did she sock me in the 
                    eye?

                                  HENRY
                    Because she likesyou and you 
                    because you didn t listen to her 
                    story.  Women want you to LISTEN to 
                    them.  You have to notice small 
                    details about them, and then 
                    compliment them.  Tell me something  
                    nice about this girl and be 
                    specific.

                    Shawn, I said nice.

                                  YOUNG SHAWN
                    And a really hard fist.

                                  HENRY
                    Shawn, you will never have a 
                    successful date if you can t say 
                    something nice to her.

                                  YOUNG SHAWN
                    It was nice.  I wish Icould punch 
                    like that.  And I don t want a 
                    successful date.  Especially if it 
                    means getting punched.

                                  HENRY
                    You will someday.  Believe me.  For 
                    now, I will leave you with this one

      Past the barbed wire and wild growing Jasmine vines we see 
    the flashing lights of squad cars where Lassiter and Juliet 
    are huddled around a disoriented man, PHILLIP KEISER, draped 
      only in a towel. 

      Shawn and Gus step up from the road, confused at all the 
      activity.

      Shawn sees many tire tracks.  Most look like they are tractor 
      tire marks from farmers, but Shawn hones in on one that is 
      different.

      SHAWN VISION - tire pattern in the dirt.

    He kicks around the edge, where the dirt meets the grass of 
    the field and sees something else.

      SHAWN VISION - the strap of a woman s shoe.  It s frayed at 
    the edge as if torn or broken.

      SHAWN VISION - an intricate spider web, broken in the center 
    at a low level, as if someone short has walked through it.

      SHAWN VISION -  Shawn spots a green smudge on the fence post.

      ANGLE ON - Lassiter and Juliet.

                                  KEISER
                    Look, I saw the picture of that 
                    Turk guy in the paper.  Now, it s 
                    me in a field, naked?  Headache?  
                    You do the math.

                                  JULIET
                    Do you remember seeing anything out 
                    of the ordinary?

                                  KEISER
                    I don t remember much at all.

                                  LASSITER
                    So, you just woke up in your 
                    birthday suit out in a field?

                                  KEISER
                    Look, I told you  yes  already.  
                    Are you gonnagive me a hard time?  
                    Cause I m a little freaked out as 
                    it is.  And can somebody get me a 
                    bigger towel?  This thing is like 
                    the size of a wash cloth.

    A C.S.PHOTOGRAPHER snaps a picture of Keiser.

                                  KEISER (CONT'D)
                    What are you some kind of pervert?

    The photographer gives him a  I m just doing my job  look.

      Shawn and Gus approach Lassiter and Juliet.

                    Okay, I think Chief Vick 
                      underestimated your sense of humor, 
                    because this is turning into one 
                    elaborate joke.  I m impressed.

                    How did you even find us out here?

                                  SHAWN
                    Oh, Gus and I were just looking for 
                    a nice spot to picnic and... It s

                          (covering)
                    I always loved fields.  Makes you 
                    just want to run through them,

                    Before you guys break into SOUND OF 
                    MUSIC, let me just wrap this up for 
                    you.  This is a copy cat situation.  
                    This guy saw the picture of Turk in 
                    the paper and is just trying to get 
                    some attention.

                                  SHAWN
                    Have you taken a look at this guy?  
                    This isn t exactly somebody who is 
                    looking for excuses to take his 
                    clothes off in public. 

      SHAWN VISION - CLOSE IN - Keiser s hand.  Another partial ink 
      shape.  But what is it?

                                  LASSITER

      Lassiter exits off.  Juliet follows.

    We see Shawn s P.O.V.Of Keiser standing with the towel 
      barely covering him.

                    why don t we get Turk and Keiser in

      Another field.  A full fledged crime scene is progress.  It

                    Skin pigment.  Glorious bronze 
                      Adonis-like skin.  You lead me to

                    ask them one question.  I guarantee 
                    you the answer will be related to 
                    spray tanning.

      They stop.  Look down.  Forensics guys everywhere.  They 
      spread apart to reveal.  There is also a NAKED GUY present, 
    but this one s different... He s dead! 

      Shawn, Gus, Lassiter and Juliet stand over the body.  The 
      dead guy is in his 20 s, sortaGoth with several tatoos.  No 
    one says anything.  Then...

                                  INTERIM CHIEF VICK
                          (re: pale body)
                    Well, this guy never saw a tanning 
                    salon.

                                  GUS
                    Not sure he ever saw the sun.

    The chief turns around.

                                  INTERIM CHIEF VICK
                    You ve got 24 hours.  Come up with 
                    something.

    She walks away.

                                  SHAWN
                    Now we re back at square one.

                                  GUS
                    I don t think so, Shawn.  Maybe 
                    square one is the answer.  Maybe 
                    this is beyond our realm of 
                      comprehension.  

                                  SHAWN
                    Gus, you ve got to get off of this 
                    alien thing.  You heard the Chief, 
                    we need something real, something 
                    concrete--

    We see the Forensic Investigator, shifting the body a bit.  A 
        C.S.Photographer snaps a picture. 

      SHAWN VISION - a small smeared ink stamp on the inside of the 
      victim s wrist. 

      FLASHBACK- Turk, the first naked guy s hand, a small INK LINE 
    on his hand.  Freeze image.

      FLASHBACK- Keiser s hand, a SIMILAR faded ink line with a 
      small curve, that looks like nothing until combined with the 
      dead guy s.  Layer all three images together... SHAWN VISION: 
    the composite completes a FOUR-LEAF CLOVER hand stamp.

                                  SHAWN (CONT'D)
                    Gus, how do you feel about 
                    leprechauns?

    Off Gus s look...


      Shawn and Gus walk and talk.

                                  SHAWN
                          (re:the cuckoos)
                    My, God, man.  I m still hearing it 
                    in my head.

                                  GUS
                    Me, too. 

                                  SHAWN
                    I think there is a woman involved 
                    in the speed-dating who may have 
                    had it in for these guys.  We need 
                    to get ourselves a first hand look 
                    at this speed-dating thing.

                                  GUS
                    Uh-uh, not for a hundred bucks we 
                    don t!

                                  SHAWN
                    Leave it to me.  PSYCH - Episode 1014 "He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not..." - Studio/Network Draft 9/14/06     26.
