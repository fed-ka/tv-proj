      EXT. COUNTRY LANE - EDGE OF ROARTON - DAWN - DAY 511

      A deserted country lane on the edge of the village of 
      Roarton. It s almost dawn. Light, but the moon still in the 
      sky. Twilight. 

      A figure appears on the horizon. Walking slowly down the 
      middle of the road. It s KIEREN WALKER. Flesh cover up 
      streaked. One contact out, one in. One dead eye. One living.  

      He s walking a little dazed. A thousand thoughts rolling 
      around in his head. 

      BEEP BEEP. The PICK-UP TRUCK whizzes past him. 

      He sees: 

      Bill driving, face like thunder and RICK in the passenger 
      seat with a desperate look, motionless, expression of doom. 
      Kieren s face: WTF?

      In the back, covered in netting, tied up, still alive, are 
      the two rabid zombies from the woods; the MALE ZOMBIE and the 
      LITTLE GIRL ZOMBIE.

      Kieren stops. Looks after them. They re alive and going for 
      treatment. KIEREN s feelings are mixed. Pride he saved two 
      lives last night. Devastation, RICK isn t who he thought he 
      was. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT WALKER HOUSE - LOUNGE - DAY 51A1A

      STEVE, in his dressing gown looks out the window. He s 
      extremely worried about Kieren s whereabouts. He repetitively 
      rubs his first finger and thumb, a nervous tick he shares 
      with his son. SUE joins him at the window. 

                                    STEVE
                    Time to call Shirl . 

                                  SUE
                    He ll be out with Rick. 

                                    STEVE
                    Or in a ditch somewhere. No we have 
                    to call Shirley about this. 







                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 3 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 2.

                      Treatment Centre and they ll come 
                    and take him away. Do you want 
                    that? 

                                    STEVE
                    We can t lose him again, Sue. 

      Sue takes Steve s hand. 

                                  SUE
                    We won t.

      EXT. MACY HOUSE - MORNING - DAY 522

      Bill s pick up pulls up in front of the house. Without a 
      word, BILL exits the vehicle. 

      Bill grabs the bag of weapons and enters the house. 

      Rick follows (at a safe distance). 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. MACY HOUSE - HALLWAY - SAME TIME - DAY 533

      JANET, in her nightie, extremely worried, been up all night 
      waiting for their return. 

      BILL enters and passes her without acknowledgement.  

      Rick enters, looks at his mum -  it didn t go well . 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. MACY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS LANDING - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 544

      BILL, face still thunder, is putting rifles and guns back in 
      the airing cupboard. 

      Rick comes up the stairs. Hovers. 

                                    RICK
                    Want me to get in the netting?

        CONTINUED:44

      Bill doesn t answer him. He puts the last of the guns in the 
      airing cupboard and passes. Silent treatment. This is 
      absolute hell for Rick. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. MACY HOUSE -  MOMENTS LATER - DAY 555

      BILL is aggressively collecting the netting from the back of 
      the truck. 

      Rick enters. Watches. So wants his Dad not to be mad with 
      him. 

      The netting gets stuck on the pick up s side. Bill tugs at 
      it. 

      Rick goes to help. Bill growls:

                                    BILL
                    Get off. 

      Rick backs away, as you would from a snarling dog. 

                                    RICK
                      Sorry. 

                                    BILL
                            (scoffs)
                      You re sorry? 

      Rick nods. 

                                    BILL (CONT D)
                        Yerembarrassed me, Rick. Siding 
                    with that rotter!

                    Dad, I -

                          (to himself, more than 
                            Rick)
                        Insubordination. It ll spread. Like 
                      pissdownhill.   

      Rick looks down. 

                                    BILL (CONT D)
                    He s lovin this. Yersaw him. Smug

                    The Walker lad were smiling ear to 
                      rotten ear. 

      Rick nods. 

                                    BILL (CONT D)
                    He s got to go
                          (places his finger in 
                            Rick s chest)
                      andyou ve got to do it.

      And with that Bill walks off into the house. 

      On Rick - The horror....



                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. AMY S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY 566

      AMY is sitting up in her bed. She s just put on her bra. 

      Rustling sounds are heard off camera. 

      Amy looks over at:

      The back of a MYSTERY MAN (face unseen), sitting on the edge 
      of the bed, putting on his shirt. 

      The Mystery Man stops. Puts a hand to his head. He s hung 
      over.  Amy clocks this. 

                                  AMY
                    Got some aspirin if you want? 

      ANGLE ON: The Mystery Man. It s PHILIP. Last night Amy and 
      Philip slept together. 

                                    PHILIP
                    I, uh, better get back, morning 
                      council meeting. 

      Amy nods. It s obvious that she considers this a one time 
      deal. A consolation prize. The person she really would have 
      liked to spend the night with (Kieren) spent it somewhere 
      else.  Philip stands. Turns back. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 3 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 5.

                                    PHILIP (CONT D)
                    This, what happened last night, 
                    can t get out. 

      Amy looks at him -  Believe me you were nothing to shout 
      about.  

                                    PHILIP (CONT D)
                            (shaking head, fifty 
                            shades of shame)
                      Living dead girls. Never thought 
                      that dbe my thing. 

      Amy pulls a face.

                                    PHILIP (CONT D)
                      (panicky)

                      Oh Jesus, there dbe hell to pay.  

                                  AMY
                    You think I want it known I shagged 
                      someone like you? 

                                    PHILIP
                      What s that supposed to mean? 

      Amy gives him a look. Philip takes offence. 

                                    PHILIP (CONT D)
                    Good. Keep your mouth shut. People 
                    round here found out I slept with a 
                      rotterI d be strung up. 

      Philip exits. 

      Amy hits the covers. She s pissedoff at being treated like a 
      dirty shameful secret by someone like Philip. Screw the 
      living. She goes for her laptop on the floor. Opens it. The 
      illicit web site Kieren looked at in Ep1pops up (Amy s 
      obviously been on it a lot.)

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. AMY S HOUSE - DAY 577

      PHILIP exits Amy s house. Prepares to do the walk of shame. 
      Looks up and sees:

      SHIRLEY. His mother. Walking up Amy s garden path. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 3 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 6.



        CONTINUED:77

      Philip freezes. 

      Shirley looks up. Sees her son on a PDSsufferer s door step.  
      Freezes. 

      AWKWARD. Here s the thing; Shirley doesn t know that Philip 
      knows she s a PDSCommunity Care Officer. Shirley still 
      believes Philip believes she works at a hospice. On Philip s 
      side, he hopes to God his mother doesn t know about his 
      living dead fetish and anyway how is he going explain why 
      he s coming out of one of her patients houses without 
      spilling the beans that he knows what she thinks he doesn t 
      know. You know? 

      WHAT ARE THEY BOTH GOING TO SAY?

                                    PHILIP / SHIRLEY
                    What are you doing here? 

      Couple of more uncomfortable moments as mother and son think 
      about the lies they re going to tell each other.  

                                    SHIRLEY
                          (making it up as she goes)
                    Her Nan. I knew her. At the 
                      hospice. 
                          (re. her medication bag)
                    Came to give her some left over 
                      belongings. 

                                    PHILIP
                          (not buying it for second)
                    Oh. Right.

      Philip s turn. 

                                    PHILIP (CONT D)
                    I m doing outreach. 

      Philip looks to where his mother is staring. He goes red. 
      Does up his trouser fly.

                    Oh. Right. 

      Philip nods -  That s right . He skulks past his mum.

      EXT. EDGE OF ROARTON - ROAD - DAY 588

      KIEREN is still walking into the village, reeling with  
      emotion from Rick s actions last night. He passes a LONE 
      PHONE BOX. It stands out in the desolate wilderness.  

      Kieren is looking at the phone box. He sees in the phone box 
      window reflection a building. Intrigued, Kieren turns and 
      sees: In the distance a lone small SUPERMARKET. The 
        supermarket looks awfully familiar.   

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. EDGE OF ROARTON - SUPERMARKET - DAY 599

      KIEREN stands outside looking up at the open supermarket. 
      From a distance he wasn t so sure, but now up close it cannot 
      be denied:

      This is the same supermarket from his flashbacks. The place 
      where he killed Lisa Lancaster.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY 5/NIGHT 01010

      The automatic doors open and KIEREN steps inside. 

        Muzakplays. 

      It s a surprisingly big shop. Four aisles and at the left 
      hand side a bank of cash registers, where two SHOP ASSISTANTS 
      scan bar codes.  

      ROARTON SHOPPERS trundle around with their trolleys / 
      baskets. 

      Kieren gets a number of suspicious looks (remember he isn t 
      wearing cover up and one of his contacts is out). 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 3 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 8.



        CONTINUED:1010

      Kieren ignores the shoppers scared / disapproving 
        rubbernecking and approaches AISLE 4.

      AISLE 4

      Empty of shoppers. Crisps and chocolates on the shelves. 

      Kieren stands at the far end. He is staring at a spot on the 
      floor down the aisle. 

      It s where he attacked Lisa. Kieren stares at the spot. 
      Haunted. He begins to move towards the spot. 

      The muzakstarts to become DISTORTED. The fluorescentsbegin 
      to FLICKER. 

      The stress is causing Kieren to go into flashback. An intense 
      one. 

      The whole picture starts to shake. The fluorescentsGROW 
      BRIGHTER. The muzakSCREECHES AND MORPHS INTO: 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      A MALE RABID ZOMBIE hanging about in the entrance turns his 
      head and:

      Gets A BULLET in his HEAD.   

      ANGLE ON: JEM. Combat mode, pistol smoking. 

                                  JEM
                    LISA!

      From around the corner ANOTHER RABID ZOMBIE lurches into 
      view. 

      Jem fires her pistol from range. Head shot. Zombie goes down. 

      We follow behind Jem as she begins searching aisles: 

      No Lisa in Aisle 1. No Lisa in Aisle 2 Or Aisle 3. 

      AISLE 4Jem hears MUNCHING SOUNDS.

      This is the aisle. Jem checks her chamber. She s got plenty 
      of bullets. Enough to blow any zombies that are hurting her 
      partner.  Jem goes into Aisle 4. She sees:

      RABID KIEREN, her brother, feeding on Lisa, her friend and 
      partner. 

      Rabid Kieren lifts his head and sees:

      Jem. Standing at the far end of the aisle. Holding her  
      pistol at him. 

      Jem is in utter shock. Doesn t make a move. Just stares at 
      him.   

      Rabid Kieren doesn t make a move either. Just stares at his 
      sister. 

      His sister....

      As brother and sister look at each other the fluorescent 
      lights flicker on off on off on off on off...

      Back in present day. KIEREN comes stumbling out of the 
        supermarket, head reeling from the startling revelation. His 
      sister saved him.

      JEM sleeping in bed. Bad dream. Her eyes snap open. 

      She sees a figure standing in her room. 

      Jem reaches under her pillow for her pistol. Grasps hold of 
      it and points it at the figure.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 3 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 10.

      The figure is illuminated:

                    You were there. 

      Jem doesn t say anything. Just aims her pistol. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. MACY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM -  DAY 51313

      BILL is pacing, plotting how to get Kieren. While he tells a 
      worried RICK his plan, he searches for his cigarettes. 

                                    BILL
                    It s gotta look like he turned on 
                    yer. There s some in Roartonnow 
                    who think these things are fuckin 
                      people. If yercan believe that. So 
                    when you ve finished him, say 
                      something like;  When I met up with 
                    the Walker Lad he started foaming 
                    at the mouth.  Summit like that.        

      Bill looks at Rick. Sense his son s unease. 

                                    BILL (CONT D)
                    He s not a person, Rick. He s an 
                      animal. Worse then an animal. They 
                    might walk and talk but rottersare 
                    evil. 

      Rick nods, his Dad is describing him - could his self-esteem 
      be any lower? 

                                    BILL (CONT D)
                    This has to be done.

                          (not convincing)

                      Yerwant to be in the good books or 
                    the bad books? 

      Rick looks up at Bill. That was the worst threat made by his 
      Dad when he was growing up. The times Rick was in his 
      father s  bad books  was excruciating.

      Rick sees an opportunity. He grabs it.

                      I don t mind. Be straight back. 

      Bill goes into his pocket, produces a tenner.

                    Go on then.

      Janet looks at her son. The desperation behind the eyes. She 
      recognizes it. 

      Janet nods and goes into her purse. This is done in a 
        clandestine fashion. While she counts out coins she keeps 
      looking to check Bill isn t coming in. 

      Rick understands what she s doing. He checks Bill isn t 
      coming as well. 

      Janet finishes collecting the coins and gives them to Rick in 
      exchange for the tenner. 

      Rick nods, says with his eyes -  Thank you, mum .

                    I m not like some people who think 
                    that what we did back then was 
                      alright because it was necessary 
                    for our survival, or, or we re

                      killing the living doesn t really 
                      count. It does count. I did kill

                    Talk about guilt. Try looking the

      Sue turns to Steve. Jem motions for her and Kieren to make 
      like a tree and leave. They sneak away as Sue and Steve 
      squabble.

      Rick puts down the receiver. Was that enough? What if Kieren 
      doesn t listen to the voice mail? Should he try calling 
      again? Rick searches in his pocket for more coins when his 
      wrist watch beeps. It s been half an hour. He s already taken 
      up all the time he can without it looking suspicious. 

      Rick resigns himself. Puts down the phone and exits the

      that was used to cage rogue rabid s back in the day. It is 
      currently being used to store paint for branding PDS

      Dean is LIMPING (due to his bitten leg which has been

      counting the cash they both got from handing in the set of  
      rabid s last night. 

      Gary leads the way. Stops at the basket ball court entrance.

      Gary stops. Looks at Amy. Amy glares back at him. He loses 
      the smile. Turns up the menace.

                    Mean, like that. Walking around. 
                    Bare. It s a slap in the face to

      Gary LUNGES for Amy. GRABS her by the HAIR. Amy tries to 
      defend herself, but Gary s too strong. He very roughly DRAGS 
      her to her vintage VANITY TABLE where her FLESHTONEMAKE UP 
      is.  

      Gary grabs the make up and starts SMEARING it all over Amy s 
      face. Amy tries to turn her head away. Gary won t let her.

      Gary finishes smearing Amy. He roughly lets go / pushes her. 
      She falls to the floor.  

      Amy won t allow him to win - she looks at him defiantly.

      DUNCAN and PATTY LANCASTER are exiting their home in their 
      Sunday best.   

      JEM approaches them. We see KIEREN in the background.

                    No thanks, Patty. I think you and 
                      Duncan should skip church today.

      INT. LANCASTER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 52626

      Pictures and photos of Lisa Lancaster are everywhere. Almost 
      bordering on abnormal.  

      Even though the house is very clean and charming, there s an 
      odd vibeto it. You get the feeling nothing has been touched 
      or replaced for years. As if the Lancastersdon t want to 
      throw anything away because it might be jarring if someone 
      came back. The whole place is frozen in time.

      KIEREN and JEM uncomfortably stand next to a smiling PATTY. 
      DUNCAN enters with a full FOLDER filled with various MISSING 
      POSTERS, he opens the folder and gets out the newest ones, 
      shows them to Kieren and Jem as you would show your stamp 
      collection to guests (this is Duncan s main macabre hobby now 
        - searching for his daughter).

                                    DUNCAN
                      That s the new one. 

      Kieren and Jem nod politely.

                    Looks very professional.

                      Hopefully we won t need to put  em 
                    up for much longer... 

      Expectant Patty and Duncan look at Kieren and Jem. Kieren 
      breathes in. Okay it s time... 

                                    KIEREN

                      I attacked her, Mrs. Lancaster, Mr. 
                      Lancaster. I attacked your 
                      daughter.  

      Duncan and Patty take this in.

                    So you were the one who moved her 
                    body?

      Kieren s a little caught off guard by this question. 

                                    KIEREN
                    No. No I don t think I did.

                    So who was the one who moved her

                      I...I... don tknow. It could have 
                    been me. Could have been the person

                    But yersure you bit her? 

      Kieren s knocked back by this question. He looks at Duncan 
      and Patty - who are waiting for an answer.

                                    KIEREN
                    Yes. I m sure I did that.  

      Bizarrely Duncan and Patty seemed relieved by this answer.

                    To be honest, we were hoping for a 
                    bit more from you.

      Kieren opens his mouth but doesn t know what to say. He s a 
      bit bowled over by their reactions.

      Kieren looks at his sister -  What the hell?

                      Couldn t it? Couldn t it, Kier.  

      Kieren understands what his sister s driving at. He looks at 
      Duncan and Patty. He can t take away their hope. He s already 
      taken away their only daughter. So he nods and says:

      Kieren and Jem awkwardly nod in agreement.

      EXT. DISUSED BASKET BALL CAGE - DAY 5 (PREVIOUSLY SCENE 30)26A26A

      DEAN, sweating and starving, is pressed up to the cage, 
        desperately scanning the street for anyone to help. 

      He spots A TEENAGER walking down the street. 

                                    DEAN
                    Lad! Mate! 

      The Teenager stops by the cage. Dean offers a tenner through 
      the wire.

                      Infected bastard! 

      The Teenager snatches the tenner from Dean s fingers and 
      scarpers. 

      Dean curses. Takes out another tenner from his reward bundle. 

      Dean spots a PLUMP OLD DEAR coming down the street.  

                                    DEAN
                    Hiya, love. Yerlook well, have yer
                    lost some weight?

      The Plump Old Dear shoots him a look.

                      Christian!

      Dean slumps down on the wire. He s given up on humanity. 

      From his slumped position he sees a pair of shoes coming down 
      the street. 

                                    DEAN (CONT D)

      The feet stop. Dean springs up and sees: KEN. 

      Dean s heart drops. He looks down.

      VICAR ODDIE is giving a barnstorming sermon to the 
        CONGREGATION. 

      BILL sits with JANET and an uncomfortable looking RICK. 

      Other parishioners are keeping their distance and looking at 
      Rick from the corner of their eyes. It s subtle but it s 
      clear Rick is not welcome here. 

                                    VICAR ODDIE

                                    VICAR ODDIE (CONT D)
                     And I looked, and behold a pale 
                      horseman: and his name was Death, 
                    and Hell followed with him.  The 
                    first resurrection of the dead is 
                    the beginning of the Great 
                      Tribulations. Once the first risen 
                    dead have been judged, only then 
                    can the good Lord pave the way to 
                      salvation. And salvation is all we 
                      crave.

       Amen s  from various parishioners including Bill. Janet and 
      Rick kept quiet. 

                                    VICAR ODDIE (CONT D)
                    Do not be fooled. Those things are 
                    not what they appear to be. They 
                    are not your neighbours, they are 
                    not your friends. They are 
                      imposters! Changelings of the 
                      highest order.

      Bill looks to Rick. Nods -  You see, Kieren isn t Kieren he s

                      Shirl set up.

      Bill nods, and seeing VICAR ODDIE he approaches him, shaking 
      his hand.

                      Appreciate that, Vicar.

      As BILL turns to leave, VICAR ODDIE tightens his grip and 
      leans in to BILL.

                    Bill, this is far from over. 

      BILL gives VICAR ODDIE a quizzical look.

                    shall be raised incorruptible.  A 
                      second Rising is coming, Bill. When 
                    the first risen have been judged, a 
                      second resurrection will be upon 
                    us. But this time the good lord

                    the proper, the true souls we miss 
                    so dearly. 

      Bill s eyes are wide. Vicar Oddie loosens his grip on BILL s 
      hand.

      BILL turns and leads Rick quickly out the church.

      Kieren standing on the platform, looking where the tracks go.

      Kieren watches Amy cross to the other platform, put down her 
      bag and wait for a train. 

      Jem takes this as her cue.

      Kieren s torn. He wants to go see how Amy s doing, but also 
      he wants to be loyal to his sister. Jem sees this. Makes it 
      easy on him.

      Jem nods. Teases him. 

                                  JEM
                    Just don t stay out too late, 
                      little bro. Don t want to miss yer
                      bedtime story, do yer?

      Kieren smiles at his little sister s cheekiness. She turns to 
      go. 

                                    KIEREN
                    I m not your little brother!

                                  JEM
                            (wagging her finger, 
                            talking as you would a 
                              toddler)
                    Yes you are. 

      Jem leaves with a very cheeky grin on her face.

      Kieren smiles to himself as he watches Jem go. Glad the 
      normal brother and sister teasing has begun again.

                                    KIEREN
                            (affectionate)
                    Dick.

      Upbeat, Kieren turns and walks towards Amy. 



                                    KIEREN (CONT D)
                    Hey. 

      Amy turns to see Kieren. He playfully points his finger at 
      her (like she did to him when they first met). 

                                    KIEREN (CONT D)
                      I know you. 

      Amy smiles in recognition of the impression (the smile s a 
      sad one though). Kieren sees she s back to wearing cover up.

      Kieren senses how full the suitcase is.

                    Amy, I ve never been to your house 
                      before. 

                                  AMY

                                    KIEREN
                      Forget that. You re leaving

      Amy nods.

                    last night...

                                  AMY
                    It s not that. It s this place. 
                    It s never going to accept people 
                    like us. Never ever.

                      Course I am. But thatguy?

                                  AMY
                    He s got a community. Lots of

                                    KIEREN

                    Then come with me. Be my big strong 
                      bodyguard. 

      Amy does an impression of a bodyguard. She puffs up like a 
      big fat muscle man. She looks silly. Kieren can t help 
      cracking up at her wonderful randomness.

                    Yep.

      Amy does the impression again of a big fat muscle man. It s 
      the worst impression of him he s ever seen. 

                                  AMY (CONT D)
                      That s the best impression of

      Kieren looks beat. That was his Hail Mary pass at trying to 
      get her to stay. Amy picks up her suitcase. Sees how crushed 
      Kieren looks.

                                  AMY (CONT D)

      Kieren smiles sadly. 

      Amy jumps on him and hugs him tight. Kieren hugs her tight 
      back. Really holds onto her.

                                    KIEREN
                    You be careful, you hear. I mean 
                    it. 

      Amy nods. Chokes up. It s clear to her now that Kieren really 
      cares for her.

      Amy manages to break the embrace. Steps on the train. The 
      whistle blows. The train begins to move. Amy waves good bye. 
      Kieren waves good bye back.

      EXT. VILLAGE HALL - DAY 53131

      A sign outside reads  ROARTON WOMEN S COFFEE MORNING. LADIES

        Roartonwomen including SUE, JANET, MRS BENNETT and the PLUMP 
      OLD DEAR are gathered in a back room. Despite the sign 
       WOMEN S COFFEE MORNING  this doesn t feel like your typical 
      coffee morning get together.  For one thing all the mums hold 
        UNDERSTANDING PDSbooklets.

      SHIRLEY is putting out the final fold out chairs. 

      SUE and JANET are by the tea urn.

                    Glad to hear it.

      SHIRLEY claps her hands for attention.

                                    SHIRLEY
                    Okay ladies, if you d like to take 
                      a seat. 

      The mums take their seats.

                    This is a safe place. What is said

                    Me son Henry has been getting fan 
                    mail from perverts who find his

      Sue and Janet, suppressing smiles, look at each other:  Yeah 
      right, Lord knows where they got Henry s full address from 
      (probably Henry himself!) 

      Mrs Bennett gets out one of the offending letters.

                                  MRS BENNETT (CONT D)
                    Some of the letters he gets are

      Sue, Janet and other women are having trouble keeping 
      straight faces.

                      A very common reaction, isn t it 
                      ladies? You mentioned being angry

                    When Kieren left, my family... My 
                      family went into free fall. Jemima
                      became a white hot ball of rage I 
                      couldn t reason with and Steve - 
                      there s that joke about the best 
                      husband being a mute husband - but 
                    the reality of watching someone 
                      you ve known and loved for so long 
                    just shutting down in front of you 
                    is... is awful. And at its worst 
                    point with both of them I blamed 
                      Kieren. I was so bloody mad with 
                    him. It s horrible to feel that way 
                    about someone, especially your only 
                    son.

      Bill hands Rick the knife. 

      Bill  acts  like Kieren. Walks towards Rick. Bill (as Kieren)

      Rick basks in his father s pride for a brief moment. Bill 
      turns away. Rick looks devastated that his dad wants him to 
      kill his best friend. 

      Bill puts his jacket on.

                    Gary!

      Kieren pushes him hard. Gary loses balance and topples over. 

      Kieren stands over him. Gary springs back to his feet, murder 
      in his eyes. He grabs Kieren and pushes him back into the 
      wall and PUNCHES him in the face. Kieren takes it easily. It 
      has no effect on him.

      SOUND OF: A tap running water. 

      ANGLE ON: The toilet. The lid isn t even up. 

      PAN OVER TO:

      RICK, who stands by the sink, in his coat, looking at himself 
      in the mirror. It s now or never. If he doesn t take a stand 
      he s going to have to kill Kieren. He can t allow that. But 
      standing up to his father is the most frightening thing Rick 
      has ever considered doing. Forget all the patrol missions in 
        Afghanistan. That was a cake walk compared to going against 
      his father s wishes.  But it must be done.  

      Rick looks hard at his reflection -  Just do it, solider, be 
      brave. Like Kieren was last night. Be brave.   

      Rick takes a WASH CLOTH. Soaks it in the tap water. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

                    Dad. 

      Bill looks up. Freezes. 

      ANGLE ON: Rick. Without flesh toned cover up. Without 
      contacts in. Pale skin. Eyes pin pricks. If Bill was in 
      denial about his son s condition (he was) then he cannot 
      escape it now. Here is Rick, his partially deceased son, in 
      the flesh. 

                                    RICK (CONT D)
                      I don t want to hurt Ren. 

      Bill doesn t say anything. He s in shock. The shock of the 
      self deception crumbling and the realization Rick is undead. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 3 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 47.

      Rick nods. Tears well up in his eyes. It s such a weight off 
      his shoulders to finally admit to his Dad that he s felt, 
      always felt,  trapped by his father s judgement. 

                                    BILL (CONT D)

      Rick nods again. He s too emotional to hear that last 
      question from Bill had an odd tone to it. 

                                    BILL (CONT D)

      the rough tough lieutenant of the Human Volunteer Force.

      JEM exits the house and enters the back garden. Makes a 
      beeline to the shed. Without her Army surplus jacket and blue 
      armband on she looks younger, more like a teenage girl than 
      an embattled fighter. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      rifles. 

      She gives herself a moment to silently say goodbye to Smithy 
      and her former self that needed that weapon by her side. 

      A moment. 

      Jem is about to leave when she spots THE CORDLESS PHONE on 
      top of the freezer -  Oh, there s where I left it .

      She picks the phone up. 

      Sees the blinking red light indicating new voice mail.

      Jem drops the phone and rushes out.

      KIEREN is walking up the road.  

      BILL S PICK UP TRUCK appears.

      Kieren stops. 

      Bill s pick up races towards him. 

      Kieren stares it down. Refuses to go into the ditch.  

      Bill s pick up...

      ...barrels past Kieren. 

      Bill doesn t even look in Kieren s direction. Kieren clocks 
      that Bill is alone in the truck s cab.  

                                                                            CUT TO:

      CLOSE ON: A WHITE PAINT POT. A BRUSH DIPS INTO IT. 

      WIDE: BILL is painting over the  Z  on his door. 

      He finishes. Looks at the white wash. Satisfied, he goes 
      inside the house. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      ON: The opened storage box. The box contains all the 
        memorabilia of Rick before he died, that was on display in 
      the Macyhousehold before he came back. A framed photograph 
      of Rick in his Military dress (NB: the photograph we saw in 
      Ep1) is taken out. 

      BILL is carefully placing the old framed photographs of Rick 
      back on display. Just like before. 

      BILL is putting the NHSleaflets, Rick s contacts and cover 
      up mousse, Rick s medals, in a black bin bag. 

                                                                            CUT TO:IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 3 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 51.

      Bill exits with the black bin bag and puts it outside, next 
      to the bins, and re-enters the house. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      BILL, back wearing his Army surplus jacket and blue armband 
      is sat down, lager in hand, watching the footie. Eerily 
      still. 

      Sound of front door. 

                                    JANET
                    Hiya. Sorry I m late, love.   

      Bill doesn t answer her. 

      Janet comes with a box of Sunday school stuff. 

                                    JANET (CONT D)
                      Shirl was natteringon bout the

                    woman can... 

      Janet trails off. She s noticed the unpacked photos of Rick 
      on the mantlepieceand that the place has been cleared of any 
      trace of Rick in his other state. 

                                    JANET (CONT D)
                      Where s Rick? 

      A slight twitch from Bill.

                            (starting to really worry)
                    Bill, where s Rick?

      Bill turns his head. We see clearly the disturbing glint in 
      his eyes. 

                                    BILL

                      airport. That s the last time I saw 
                    our son. 

      Bill turns back to the TV. Takes a slow swig of his drink. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. WALKER HOUSE - DAY 55252

      KIEREN turns the corner into the culde sac. He stops.

      KIEREN'S POV:

      A FIGURE is lying face down outside Kieren s house.

      Kieren moves towards the figure....

      ...the more he comes towards the figure, the clearer it 
      becomes to Kieren who it is...

      He breaks into a run...

      ...Kieren gets to the figure lying on the drive. He turns the 
      figure over...

      We see who it is.

      It's Rick Macy. Dead. A Red Hunting Knife buried in the back 
      of his head. 

      Kieren cradles Rick in his arms. The pain is overwhelming.

      Kieren looks around. Someone must have seen something, Why 
      has no one come out to help? He sees Ken looking out the 
      window. He turns and sees more curtains twitching in other 
      houses. They're scared. They're all scared. Deathly afraid of 
      the man who did this...

      Bill Macy.

      The overwhelming sorrow turns to overwhelming anger. Kieren 
      takes the knife and stands. He strides off, meeting his out 
      of breath sister on her way home.

                                  JEM
                      Kieren? 

      A tight, determined Kieren passes her silently.

      The man that God needs to help - BILL MACY - is sitting as if 
      the good lord has given him peace. 

      JANET  is  on  the  sofa  next to him. In shock. Rigid. 
        Traumatised. 

      A POUNDING at the front door. Bill focuses on the game.

      Janet looks at Bill. 

      Again - BANG BANGBANG. 

      Janet still looking at Bill, waiting for permission to move a 
      muscle.

      JANET opens the door to:

      KIEREN, rage still humming away inside of him, waits on the 
      doorstep. He clutches the knife tight in his hand. 

                                    JANET
                      Kieren. You don t want to -

      Kieren doesn t let her finish her sentence. 

      He BARGES into the house.

      BILL still watching the game. Calm as a Hindu cow. 

      Kieren enters. Stands over Bill. His hand holding the knife 
      trembles with anger. 

                                    KIEREN
                    Stand up. 

      Bill doesn t break staring at the TV.

                    Stand up!

      Bill, barely acknowledging Kieren s presence. 

                                    BILL
                      Yerbanned from this house. 

      Kieren s expression of pure hate falters somewhat. What a 
      strange thing to say. But he figures it s Bill messing with 
      him so to show he means business he PLUNGES THE KNIFE INTO 
      THE SOFA S ARM REST.  

      Bill looks at the knife with glassy spaced out eyes. 

                                    BILL (CONT D)
                    And that s why. Bloody animal. You

                    it wasn t for wrecking your

                    still be barred from  ere,  so trot 
                    on.  

      Kieren looks at Bill - There s something very odd in his tone 
      and manner. 

                                    KIEREN
                    What do you mean when he comes

      Frightened Janet goes to get another lager for Bill. Kieren

                    No, no, no, sweetheart. I got rid 
                    of an evil imposter. The right 
                      version's gonnabe back after I 
                    judge the rest o  em.

                            (breaking down)
                    You killed Rick. 

      Kieren turns away. He can t watch this.  

      He frowns: The RED HUNTING KNIFE isn t sticking out of the 
      arm rest. 

      Kieren realizes something, snaps his head back to Bill and 
      Janet as... 

      ...Janet takes the knife she took from the arm rest and 
      ATTACKS BILL WILDLY. 

      Bill puts up his hands to defend himself. Janet slashes at 
      them. 

      Bill stumbles back in pain. SLASHED BLOODY HANDS. 

      Janet goes for Bill again but Kieren gets to her. Holds her 
      back. They both lose their balance and tumble to the floor.  

      Bill is in shock. He looks at his bloody hands. Blood on his 
      hands. Seeing the blood jolts him out of his psychotic 
      episode. 

      Janet claws towards Bill. Kieren holds her at bay.  

                                    JANET (CONT D)
                    OUR BOY! YOU KILLED OUR BOY! 

      Bill, dazed, doesn t understand.... 

      Then it hits him. What he s actually done. 

      Bill urgently gets to his feet.

      BILL exits his front door, squints in the daylight...  

      BOOM

      Bill s blown back off his feet by a shotgun blast. Dead 
      before he hits the floor.  

                                                                            CUT TO:

      BILL is dead.

      ANGLE ON: KEN BURTON, holding his ANTIQUE SHOTGUN.

      That s for Maggie. That s for Rick. That s for all the people 
      Bill has terrorized in Roarton. 

      Ken turns and walks away from the bloody scene.

      ON: Dean in the cage, who had been chomping on the coronation 
      chicken sandwich Ken had got for him, he has witnessed the 
      shooting. He is presently agog, in shock, holding his half 
      eaten sarniein his hand. 

      Kieren (holding the knife) and Janet come out the house. They 
      both see Bill. 

      Utter shock. 

      Janet, stunned, crosses to Bill, kneels by his side.   

      Kieren looks up at Dean in the cage. 

      Dean holds his hands up.

      PHILIP is in the middle of painting a  Z  in green paint on a 
      front door. The owner of the house MRS BENNETT (62), hangs 
      out the window, flanked by a SHAPE of a PERSON next to her. 
      This is her PDSson, HENRY. 

      We see in the background BILL s PICK UP TRUCK drive past. In 
      the front with BILL, is RICK, looking very pale and rigid. 

                                  MRS BENNETT
                    I ve just had that door varnished. 

                                    PHILIP
                    Just following orders, Mrs Bennett.

                    Vicar bloody Oddie. Is council

                      Probably not.

                            (enraged)
                    My Henry s done nothing wrong. It s 
                    that witch of an ex that should be 
                      tarred and feathered. He were

                      Thought Henry died of heart attack?

                                    PHILIP
                      That s just sick and wrong.

      PHILIP dothprotest too much. Mrs Bennett sees Kieren walking 
      past.

                                  MRS BENNETT
                    Is he sick and wrong? He used to be 
                    your friend.

      Philip looks at Kieren, who ignores him and walks on.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. WOODS - CAVE DEN - DAY 55858

      KIEREN stands outside the entrance to the cave. He s scared 
      to go in there. To face up to what it represents. But so much 
      has happened. He needs to face this. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. WOODS - CAVE DEN - DAY 55959

      A FIGURE with a lamp light lit enters the inner sanctum of 
      the cave. 

      As he comes towards us we make out it s Kieren. 

      Kieren looks at:

      THE OLD DEN. Him and Rick s special place. We spot graffiti 
      on the rocks. One carving stands out from the rock band 
      motifs and song lyrics:  Ren+ Rick Forever  

      Kieren gets up onto the rusted CAT WALK. Sets himself down. 
      Get the feeling this is where him and Rick sat and had heart 
      to hearts. 

      On Kieren for a few moments. Reflecting on all that has 
      occurred. 

      A noise comes from the entrance. 

      Kieren looks entrance. 

      All he can see is a keyhole of light and then utter darkness. 

      More noise - sounds like a person, coming closer. 

      Kieren stands. 

      A FIGURE is silhouetted on the cave wall. 

      Kieren s scared now. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 3 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 61.

                    Lisa? 

      A figure emerges into the dim 

      Kieren s partially deceased heart misses a couple of thuds. 

      It s not Lisa, come to punish him, it s his mother SUE.

                                    KIEREN (CONT D)
                      Christ mum, nearly gave me a heart

                    What are you doing here, Kieren?

                    I - I wasn t gonna- I didn t know 
                    what to do... (after what 
                      happened). I started running and I - 
                    and I- I felt like I needed to come 
                    here. To where me and Rick used 
                    to... 

      Kieren can t finish, it s too difficult.  

                                  SUE
                    I m so sorry about what happened to

                      I think I got him killed. 

                                  SUE
                    No you didn t.

                      That s right, Bill killed him. Not 
                    you - Bill.

                      Christ, it s becoming just like 
                      before and I don t know how to

                      Here s how you change it; this

                    Yes. My god, Kieren, I d love you 
                    with all my heart if you came back 
                    as a goldfish! 

      This effects Kieren deeply. He spots the  Ren+ Rick 4 
      Forever  on the rock face. He winces. Sue spots this. 

                                  SUE (CONT D)
                      I know how it feels. To lose 
                      someone. Same thing happened when I 
                    was eighteen - well not exactly the 
                    same thing - but close. I was going 
                    out with this very handsome RAF
                      pilot.

      Kieren s surprised to hear this. 

                                  SUE (CONT D)
                      I know. It s true. I never told 
                    you. I was so amazed by this man. 
                    In awe of him really. I had it in 
                    my head that we were going to get 
                      married, have kids, the whole 
                      shebang. Trouble was he had other 
                      plans. Namely dumping me and going 
                    out with my best friend Emily who 
                    he deemed more socially acceptable. 
                    I was devastated. Inconsolable. I 
                      thought that was it. The end. I d 
                    never find any one who got me so 
                      completely again. I quit college 
                    and came home. One night, I decided 
                    I was going to end it all. I 
                      sneaked out the house and went to 
                    the late night chemist. The fella
                    on the counter point blank refused 
                    to serve me. So I burst into tears 
                    right there in the shop. He was so 
                    kind this fella, even though he 
                      wouldn t serve me, he took me in 
                    the back, made me a tea and 
                      listened. And I talked. All through 
                    his shift and then some more when 
                    he walked me home. I talked and he 
                      listened and he didn t yawn or look 
                    at his watch or anything, he just 
                    was there for me. And he made me 
                    laugh too.

      Time has passed. No pick up truck in the driveway. No blood 
      stains in the driveway. The leaves on the trees have turned.

      INT. MACY HOUSE - DAY 661B61B

      A wake. For one. The clock is silent, its batteries lying 
      next to it on the mantelpiece. Two open coffins containing 
      Bill and Rick are sitting in the living room. Janet is 
      standing in mourning beside them. She has her eyes tightly 
      shut, her hand clasped in prayer. She whispers the Lord s 
      Prayer over and over. It s as if she is begging God to bring 
      them both back. Maybe if she prays hard enough they ll 
      return... 

      A few moments of this, then... 

      Janet stops praying. Opens her eyes. Looks down at Rick, her 
      son. His eyes closed. Janet reaches out a hand to touch her 
      son - Perhaps he s back, just sleeping? I ll nudge him, wake 
      him up -

      A KNOCK at the door stays her hand and jolts her out of 
        wishfulness. She knows who this is: the funeral procession, 
      come to bury her family. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Time has passed. It s a double funeral. Bill and Rick. Father 
      and son. Two processions. All the village in attendance 
      including the WHOLE WALKER FAMILY. We see from which villager 
      follows which coffin where their allegiance lies. It s fifty 
      fifty. 

      Each set of mourners give the other mourners daggers of 
      mistrust. 

      RICK S FUNERAL PROCESSION. 

      KIEREN is at the front carrying Rick s coffin. 

      Rick s other pallbearers are: JEM, DEAN and HENRY BENNETT. 

      Janet follows Rick s coffin.  

      VICAR ODDIE follows both processions. 

      GARY crosses from Bill s procession and comes up to Vicar 
      Oddie.

                                    GARY
                    It s not right. 

      Vicar Oddie turns to him. But says nothing.

                    Was the Walker boy. 

      Vicar Oddie looks over to Kieren carrying the coffin. There s 
      a new found confidence and strength about him.

                     The righteous perish, and no one 
                      ponders it in his heart; devout men 
                    are taken away, and no one 
                      understands that the righteous are 
                    taken away to be spared from evil. 
                    Those who walk uprightly enter into 
                      peace; they find rest as they lie 
                    in death . 

      KIEREN looks from Rick s grave to the crowd. A community 
      divided.

      PHILIP moves from BILL s grave and sidles up to KIEREN.

      He silently says good bye. 

      Then Kieren stands and exits frame. 

      We stay on Rick s grave. We stay on it expecting the lad to 
      make a surprise return...

      Hold for a few moments...

      ...No one bursts up. For today, the dead rest.

      On her door, written in pink paint, bold as you like is a 
      love heart and in the love heart is written:

       AMY + KIEREN FOREVER 

      Kieren looks at the lovely graffiti. Smiles sadly.

      Kieren takes out a handkerchief, dips it in a puddle and 
      wipes his cheek. Some flesh tone cover up comes off, showing 
      his naturally pale skin.
