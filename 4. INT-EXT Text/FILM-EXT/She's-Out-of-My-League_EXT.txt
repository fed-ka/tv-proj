Follow a pair of perfect female legs as the woman's heels
click along the sidewalk, suitcase rolling behind. Although
we can't see the woman riding on these legs, we can see
several men stare as she passes by on her way into...
Kirk and Stainer are on their way through security. A huge
security guard runs a metal-detector wand over Stainer.
STAINER
Whatcha runnin' there a PX-235?
GUARD
I don't know sir.
STAINER
The two hundred series are dog
shit. You couldn't find a bazooka
with that thing. You should look
into the new eight fifties.
GUARD
Can you keep it moving sir?
26.
Kirk's Taurus pulls into a space. He climbs out and slams
the door. As it closes, he reaches but too late. He looks
through the window. The keys are hanging in the ignition.
Kirk, still in his TSA uniform, walks past a large laundromat
to a small storefront next door. The chipped and faded
lettering on the glass reads, "Maury Hammerstein, Attorney At
Law - Aggressive, Dynamic Representation Since 1942!" As
Kirk reaches for the door, he notices a small hand-written
sign, "I don't make change!" He goes inside.
It's Friday night and several college parties are raging in
the complex. Kirk leads Molly up the stairs and down the
balcony hall toward his door. They pass a few college
students on the way; a couple making out, a guy vomiting in a
bush. Two apartment windows are covered with tapestries of
Bob Marley and a giant pot leaf.
As Molly exits, she gives him one last kiss. Two studly male
college students are playing foosball on their patio. They
stop when one points out the hottie who's kissing Kirk.
Molly trots off.
COLLEGE STUDENT #1
Damn, man!
That chick is fine!
Kirk returns a cool "whassup" nod to the guys.
COLLEGE STUDENT #2
All right Mr. Kettner!
52.
COLLEGE STUDENT #1
You wanna play some foos!?
KIRK
No thanks fellas.
Kirk beams from the attention as he goes back inside.
Kirk and Stainer come out of a record store and walk past the
shops and restaurants. Kirk holds a stack of flyers for
Stainer's band. As they walk, Kirk hands flyers to Stainer
who posts them on walls and kiosks with a staple hammer.
STAINER
Kirk, it's a simple rule of life.
Look around. People are pretty
evenly matched.
Kirk and Stainer look at the couples that stand at the bus
stop, sit in the outdoor cafes and walk down the sidewalk.
Each couple is fairly closely matched - pretty with pretty,
ugly with ugly, heavy with heavy, fit with fit.
KIRK
Yeah, but Stainer, she was the one
who asked me out. So, why...
STAINER
That first night, were you
intimidated by her?
KIRK
No, I didn't think I had a chance.
STAINER
Exactly. So you were relaxed and
funny. You were on.
Stainer posts several "Wheel in the Sky" flyers on a kiosk.
KIRK
So I gotta get back to that.
STAINER
That's just it, Kirky. Now that
she's opened the door, you can't
get back to that.
KIRK
So I'll have to fake it?
STAINER
Forget it. You can't fake that
far. A broad like her - she'll
smell that horseshit a mile away.
55.
Kirk and Stainer enter a...
...and take a table on the crowded patio.
STAINER
Can we get a couple of menus?
(then to Kirk) You eating?
KIRK
Maybe just a salad.
STAINER
Dude, one salad ain't going make up
for thirty years of chili dogs.
KIRK
I know. But I got dinner with my
folks later.
STAINER
Fun. Be sure and stab your brother
in the eye with a fork for me.
KIRK
Sorry, Eric's not coming tonight.
Kirk motions toward a mismatched couple (nerdy guy with
knockout girl) who pass Kirk and Stainer's table on their way
to the valet stand. Stainer rolls his eyes.
KIRK (CONT'D)
You know what - this is ridiculous.
I'm just going to call her.
STAINER
Fuck you are! Put that thing away.
You do not call her. Don't you get
it? Talon is back in town.
KIRK
No, she broke up with him.
STAINER
So, you're telling me you were
sitting there, a sweating,
quivering stutter-bucket and when
you came back from the can, Molly's
hugging a guy who's so good looking
you'd probably fuck him. What do
you think she's doing this weekend?
56.
KIRK
So what am I supposed to do?
STAINER
What can you do? She hasn't called
- she's not going to.
KIRK
You're probably right.
STAINER
Just count yourself lucky. You got
to kiss a goddess and you got out
before she recalibrated your
hardware. A chick like that can
raise the bar too high and then
once she dumps you, nobody else
measures up.
KIRK
No, you're right. You know what -
it's good. It's better. I'm
actually relieved. You should have
seen this Talon guy. Man! All
I've been thinking about is having
to be naked in front of her. I
don't need that kind of pressure.
The valet pulls a red Ferrari up to the mismatched couple and
the nerdy guy opens the door for her. Stainer shakes his
head as if to say, "Was there even a doubt?"
Kirk's phone is sitting on the table - it rings.
Kirk and
Stainer can see Molly's name on the caller ID.
STAINER
Don't do it!
The phone rings again. Kirk glances down at the phone.
Stainer keeps a stern eye on Kirk. RING! Close on Kirk's
eyes turning weak. RING! Close on Stainer's threatening
eyes. RING! Kirk gives up and looks away. Stainer's eyes
calm. Kirk snatches the phone but Stainer grabs Kirk's
wrist, pinning it to the table. RING!
KIRK
Cut it out!
STAINER
Let it go!
57.
RING! Kirk reaches for the phone with his other hand but
Stainer's free hand intercepts it and these arms flail around
like battling snakes. Kirk presses the button to answer the
call and, instead, moves his head down to the phone.
KIRK
Hello!?... Oh, no problem! Yeah I
was super busy yesterday anyway.
STAINER
Would you look at yourself?
Stainer lets go and Kirk sits up and backs away.
KIRK
Well, I have dinner with my folks
tonight... Oh, I wouldn't want to
subject you to them... Okay. If
you want to. I can pick you up...
Kirk gives a confident smile and an "I told you she'd call"
nod. Stainer crosses his arms and shakes his head.
KIRK (CONT'D)
Oh, sure. Well then let me call
you back in a few minutes and I'll
give you directions. Alrighty.
Yeah. Buh-bye.
STAINER
Well, I guess you just solved that.
An hour with your family and she'll
file for a restraining order.
KIRK
No. Eric's not going to be there.
It's going to be good. You might
be wrong about Molly. She might...
Stainer spots a round little boy posting a "Lost Puppy" flyer
over one of the ten he just posted on the kiosk.
STAINER
(to the boy)
Whoa! I don't think so Spanky!
A
little lower!
The boy instead posts it over a "Walk For a Cure" poster.
Molly drives up and stops in front of a small home on a
quaint residential street.
58.
She climbs out of her car, checking the address on a small
sheet of paper. She sees Kirk sitting on the front porch.
KIRK
You found it!
MOLLY
I had good directions!
She steps up the front walk toward Kirk, who points to a
little yellow note taped to the front door.
KIRK
I'm sorry. My folks aren't back
yet. We're locked out.
MOLLY
You don't have a key?
KIRK
No. My dad's kind of obsessed with
home-security. Like someone's
going to break in and steal his
Reader's Digest collection.
A very old man wobbles out of the house next door with a
beagle on a leash. The man struggles a bit with the dog.
KIRK (CONT'D)
Hi, Mr. Riley!
MR. RILEY
Well, howdy Kirk!
KIRK
Hey, what do say you take the night
off and I'll take Noodle around the
block for you? (to Molly) Are you
up for a walk?
MOLLY
That sounds great.
MR. RILEY
Geeze Kirk, that's mighty nice.
Kirk jogs over to take the leash.
Noodle jumps up on Kirk.
He and Molly pet the excited dog.
KIRK
(baby talk)
Yes! Always happy to see you,
pretty girl! Yes you are a pretty
girl! Yes you are!
59.
Molly takes note - animal lover - big points.
MR. RILEY
You're a good boy, Kirk.
KIRK
It's no trouble at all.
Molly and Kirk start down the sidewalk with Noodle. An old
woman comes out of the next house with her dog on a leash.
OLD WOMAN
Honey!?
Are you back in business!?
KIRK
(To Molly)
I had a little neighborhood dog-
walking service when I was a kid .
(to the woman) No problem, Mrs. D,
we can take Norton along too!
Several soft-faded cuts as Kirk and Molly move through the
neighborhood. Soon they have a third dog. Kirk points out
landmarks as they talk and laugh. Now they have a fourth
dog. Molly takes his arm.
The evening light is a bit dimmer as they give Noodle back to
Mr. Riley. Kirk turns toward his parents' house. Now
there's a car parked in the driveway and a jacked-up, knobby-
tired pick-up parked out front. The truck has two bumper
stickers ("One Nation Under GOD!" and "No Fat Chicks!")
flanking a vanity license plate that reads, "ERIX-TOY."
Kirk's shoulders slump at the sight of it.
KIRK (CONT'D)
Hey, you know what I'm thinking,
let's go get Chinese.
MOLLY
What are you talking about?
I want
to meet your family.
They start toward the door.
Molly's cell phone rings.
MOLLY (CONT'D)
I'm so sorry. It's Patty. I've
got to take this. Go ahead. I'll
be right in.
Kirk and Stainer are at the ticket gate. Kirk pays for his
ticket but Stainer stands staring at him.
KIRK
What?
STAINER
This wasn't my idea. I ain't
dropping twenty bucks to go in
there. God-damned planes are in
the sky. I can see 'em just fine
from the parking lot for free.
Kirk begrudgingly buys Stainer a ticket.
Kirk and Stainer move through the crowd. Stainer now carries
a corn dog, a giant soda and an armload of Air Show
memorabilia, including an inflatable F/A-18 Hornet.
71.
KIRK
She's working one of the kids'
charities. I'm guessing they might
be down by the rides.
STAINER
Whoa dude, check it out.
The Blue
Angels!
Five men in flight suits and aviator sunglasses strut through
the crowd in slow motion. They exude masculine confidence.
STAINER (CONT'D)
Those are the coolest guys in the
entire world. Think about it -
George Clooney or Derek Jeter would
trade places with those guys in a
second. Can you imagine the sheer
magnitude of puss those fuckers tag?
I'm gonna get 'em to sign my Hornet!
Stainer runs toward them. He joins some kids and beautiful
women who are already getting autographs.
Kirk spots Molly working a charity booth. He crosses to her.
She turns to him with a this-better-be-good stance.
KIRK
Molly.
MOLLY
Kirk.
KIRK
I just wanted to apologize for last
night... for my family.
MOLLY
Your family I can deal with.
KIRK
And for me... For what I said.
MOLLY
Do you really think I'm that
shallow? You think I need to slum?
KIRK
No. I don't know what to think.
You just have to understand that
this is a new area for me. Believe
it or not, I don't have gobs of
experience with beautiful women.
72.
MOLLY
Is that all I am to you?
KIRK
No, but I don't have much
experience with brilliant,
successful, wonderful women either.
This melts Molly a bit.
MOLLY
Kirk, this can't work if you put me
up on some kind of pedestal.
KIRK
It's not that I... Okay, look...
When I was a kid, we played a lot
of baseball in my neighborhood.
The worst part was picking teams
because I was always picked last.
Every time. Like they couldn't
start a friggin' game without first
establishing how much I sucked.
So, now you come along and make me
feel like the first pick. But...
what if I can't hit?
Molly softens and smiles.
MOLLY
You already got to first base.
Just keep your eye on the ball.
Kirk nods and smiles back.
Molly steals a quick kiss.
MOLLY (CONT'D)
Let me tie up a couple things and
I'll show you around the grounds.
KIRK
Sounds good.
Molly goes into a tent to speak to Patty.
Kirk watches her
with a calm, relieved smile.
VOICE (O.S.)
Boy, she sure is something, huh?
Kirk turns toward the imposing Blue Angel pilot standing
behind him. The pilot removes his shades - it's Talon.
73.
TALON
It's Kirk right? (firm handshake)
Excellent to see you again, sir.
KIRK
Oh, Talon.
You're a Blue Angel?
TALON
Yes sir, a Naval Aviator.
KIRK
Perfect. Okay, I get it - Talon is
what - your call-sign?
TALON
No, it's my name.
KIRK
Then what's your call-sign?
TALON
Oh, I'd rather not say. It's
embarrassing. Just something the
guys gave me...
Talon puts his arm around Kirk and walks him away from the
booth.
TALON (CONT'D)
Anyway listen Kirk, is it fair to
say that you and Mol are close?
KIRK
Yeah, I guess.
TALON
Well, I understand that fellas like
yourself tend to have uniquely
candid relationships with the women
they befriend. Am I right?
KIRK
Fellas like myself?
TALON
Don't get me wrong. I have no
problem with your lifestyle. What
grown men do in the privacy of
their homes is none of my concern.
KIRK
Talon, I'm not...
74.
TALON
Hey, I'm in the Navy. I don't ask
and I don't expect you to tell.
Talon looks over his shoulder to confirm they are alone.
TALON (CONT'D)
Now, I don't know what Molly's told
you about me, but anything bad - I
deserve. I hurt that girl. I hurt
one of God's own angels and I've
regretted it every minute since.
KIRK
No.
She speaks very highly...
TALON
God as my witness, I WILL make it
right. I WILL get her back. Can I
count on you to put in the good
word for me, Poncho?
KIRK
Um... Sure.
TALON
You're the man. Come here.
Talon embraces Kirk in a tight hug.
TALON (CONT'D)
There you go. Feel the tolerance.
Another Blue Angel calls over while signing Stainer's plane.
BLUE ANGEL #2
Yo! Foot-Long! We scramble in
ten.
TALON
Roger!
Talon finishes the long hug. He and the other Blue Angels
walk off in formation. Stainer rejoins Kirk.
KIRK
That was Talon.
STAINER
Who? The Blue Angel guy?
(cracking
up) Duuuuude!
Molly joins them.
75.
MONTAGE OVER LOUD CATCHY TUNE:
1) Kirk and Molly walk arm in arm through the air show crowd.
Kirk's POV as every guy that passes checks her out. Close on
Kirk's proud expression. The Blue Angels take flight. Close
on the planes as they weave in and out of an intricate
formation. A wider shot reveals that their jet trails spell
out "MOLLY" inside a heart. Reverse to pan across Molly
(worried about Kirk's reaction), Kirk (trying not betray his
insecurity) and Stainer (trying to hold back his laughter.)
2) Kirk and Molly in a crowded movie theatre. She squeezes
his hand and he smiles back at her. Molly turns back to the
screen and Kirk's smile quickly degrades into a dirty look.
The shot widens to reveal who Kirk is glaring at - another
man (also with a date) sits on Molly's opposite side and
stares down at her cleavage. The man looks up to meet Kirk's
gaze and smiles back. He offers Kirk a fist-tap behind
Molly's head. Annoyed, Kirk doesn't tap back. Molly is
oblivious to this exchange.
3) As Molly walks down a city sidewalk at night, Kirk has
stopped to tie his shoe. When he trots after her to catch up,
he is tackled by two cops.
COP
Nice try pervert!
Molly spins around, horrified.
COP (CONT'D)
It's okay ma'am. This fat tub of
shit was following you but we got
him.
Molly angrily grabs Kirk by the arm and frees him from the
cop's grasp.
4) Kirk, in his TSA uniform, addresses a group of patients at
the Children's Cancer Center. He demonstrates a metal
detector wand. Molly sits with the kids who look bored out
of their minds. Suddenly, the kids light up and Kirk feels
he's making an impression until he realizes that Talon has
come up behind him. Talon is dressed in his flight suit and
carrying an arm-load of toy jets. The kids excitedly jump up
and gather 'round Talon; some even hug him.
FADE MUSIC
He throws his hands up in the air and does a happy dance
similar to the one he had done after their first kiss.
Stainer, Devon and Jack are around the corner as Stainer and
Jack are smoking a bowl. Devon hears Kirk's celebration and
peers around the corner. He waves the others over. The guys
come around the front to join Kirk.
STAINER
Dude?
80.
KIRK
(playfully chipper)
My friends! Whassup Bitches!
DEVON
What?
What's going on?
KIRK
My troubles are over boys! It's
all going to work out! Check it
out - Molly has... Wait for it...
Kirk pauses for dramatic effect and then puts his thumbs up.
KIRK (CONT'D)
...a birth defect!
DEVON
Excuse me?
JACK
That's terrible.
KIRK
No.
That's awesome!
Don't you get
it?
DEVON
Ahhhh No.
STAINER
Sure, I get it. She needs a good
guy like Kirky 'cause the guys she
dates can't handle it, right?
KIRK
It sent Talon packing.
Kirk and Stainer high five.
Jack and Devon look disturbed.
DEVON
Well, what's wrong with her?
KIRK
I don't know yet. Patty just said
she had a physical issue.
DEVON
Well that could be anything. Did
she say it was a birth defect?
81.
KIRK
She said it was, "something like a
birth defect."
JACK
What if it's something really bad?
KIRK
I hope it is. I hope it's
something that would make most guys
run screaming. It won't matter to
me. I love her.
JACK
That's cool that you love her but
it's pretty fucked up to be rooting
for a harsh deformity.
DEVON
Oh, wow. What if this is Patty's way
of telling you that Molly is a man?
STAINER
Hey, if that chick has a dick, I'll
suck it!
Kirk walks out the doors. Stainer catches up to him and they
walk down the busy curb at a quick, angry pace.
STAINER
Kirky! Hold up, man! What are you
doing!? You can't let her screw up
your life!
KIRK
Get away from me Stainer!
STAINER
Whoa! Don't take it out on me! We
both knew this Molly thing wasn't
going to work out! It ain't my
fault!
KIRK
You're right. It's not your fault.
It's my fault for listening to all
your... pernicious advice.
STAINER
What the fuck you talkin' about?
KIRK
All you did was fill my head with
all this crap about threes and tens
and how I'm not worthy.
STAINER
Are you worthy of a chick like
that?
KIRK
Maybe! I don't know. But that's
not the point! You're supposed to
be my God damned best friend. You
know what!?
(MORE)
86.
KIRK (CONT'D)
I think you were jealous and you
set out to sabotage us from the
start!
STAINER
That is total bullshit!
KIRK
Then why weren't you there for me?
What if she actually liked me!?
Maybe with a little help, I could
have pulled it off!
Kirk steps onto an...
Kirk bursts out the door and vomits into a dumpster. He
falls backwards against the wall and slides down into a
sitting position.
MOLLY (O.S.)
You realize that there's a good
chance this won't work out.
Molly steps out into the alley.
MOLLY (CONT'D)
And you could get hurt.
KIRK
I know.
MOLLY
And you're going to have to be
naked in front of me at some point.
KIRK
I can work up to that.
Kirk stands up.
KIRK (CONT'D)
So, you and me are...
MOLLY
Three million dollars for kids with
cancer and you sing to me? I'm not
made of wood you know.
Molly hugs him. The first intro riff of a piano version of
"Pressure" kicks in and the crowd inside goes crazy.
MOLLY (CONT'D)
But one condition.
KIRK
Anything.
MOLLY
You have to go brush your teeth
right now.
Talon walks out into the alley, still holding the flowers.
TALON
So, Molly... Can we finish our
conversation?
109.
Kirk takes Molly's hand and leads her past Talon.
KIRK
Sorry Poncho, she's with me.
DISSOLVE TO:
Close on a preacher.
PREACHER
The vows you have just heard are a
unique expression of the love
between two souls.
Close on Kirk - looking dapper but sweaty and nervous.
PREACHER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Two souls who have come together
this day in holy matrimony.
Close on Molly - looking more beautiful than ever.
PREACHER (CONT'D)
And by the power vested in me by
the great state of Nevada, I now
pronounce you husband and wife.
You may now...
A wider shot reveals the NASCAR theme wedding of Eric and
Debbie. Kirk stands among the groomsmen. Each are dressed
in tuxes that represent the colors, numbers and sponsors of
certain drivers. Molly stands among the bridesmaids. Each
dressed in a checkered-flag gown. Ron and Marnie are also in
the wedding party.
Debbie hands her mulatto baby to the preacher so that she and
Eric can share a disgusting wide open mouth kiss. Debbie
grabs Eric's ass while Eric gropes her breasts.
Stainer and Wheel in the Sky kick into "Any Way You Want It"
from a bandstand nearby. Patty dances in front of Stainer -
he winks back at her.
Devon cuts up a wedding cake that looks like a full-sized
racing wheel and tire.
The guests throw rice as Eric and Debbie run to a stretch
Nascar limo.
110.
Eric picks up Debbie and loads her in through the window.
He
then runs around to the other side and jumps into that
window. The limo burns rubber as it peels away.
Pan across the guests as they wave goodbye; Devon and his
squeaky clean family, Jack and a hot date, Mr. & Mrs.
Kettner, Marnie & Ron. Patty and Stainer - making out. Kirk
and Molly stand together arm in arm. Kirk holds a ceramic
urn, painted with the Las Vegas skyline.
Push in on the urn until the skyline becomes real. Push in
toward the top of The Stratosphere Casino. Continue pushing
in until we are inside the observation deck. Push through
the gift shop where the TV is tuned to CNN. As we pass the
TV we hear.
CNN ANCHOR
In a press conference held earlier
today, NASA officials announced
that affordable tourist travel to
the surface of the moon will be a
reality within the next ten to
fifteen years.
Push past the TV, out of the gift shop and to the other side
of the observation deck where we find Kirk and Molly. They
kiss before they open the urn and pour Grammy's ashes over
the side.
