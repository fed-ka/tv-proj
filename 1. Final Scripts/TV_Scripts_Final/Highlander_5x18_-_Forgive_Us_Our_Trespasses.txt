      FADE IN:

16011601EXT.  PARIS NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

      Low key on the outside -- just a simple neon sign and a velvet
      rope.

16021602INT.  NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

      The hottest spot in town, peopled with the eclectic mix that
      makes a Paris club tops... models, artists, and the midnight
      crowd.  AMANDA, dressed sexilly in black, fits right in,
      she's moving through the crowd, bopping to the beat as she
      heads for the bar.

      A YOUNG GUY with an interesting haircut dances up to her,
      sashays suggestively -- wanna dance?  She looks him over.

                                      AMANDA
                    Maybe later.

      She moves on.  Then: the BUZZ.  Another Immortal.  Amanda
      checks out the crowd, and her eyes fix on...

      STEVEN KEANE

      who's definitely looking her way.

      This guy's hip, but not punk, dressed with flash and
        imagination.  An earring glints in one ear.  And his eyes
      glint as they settle on Amanda.

                                      KEANE
                          (as he approaches)
                    There is a God.

                          his lips)

                                      AMANDA
                    Amanda.
                          (as a joke)
                    You come here often?

                                      KEANE
                    I may have to start.
                          (off her smile)
                    Actually, I own the place.  Just
                    bought it.

                                      AMANDA
                    Really?
                            (appraising)
                    New decor, better band, less water
                    in the drinks -- you've made quite
                    an investment here.

                                      KEANE
                          (off the crowd)
                    It seems to be paying off.

                                      AMANDA
                    Flavor of the month.
                          (double entendre)
                    We'll see what kind of staying power
                    you have.

      Keane looks in her eyes and plays the moment.

                                      KEANE
                    I plan on making a lasting impression.

      Amanda returns his smile.

                                      AMANDA
                    That's optimistic of you.

      She likes this guy's style -- not to mention his obvious
      bankroll.  She leads him off the dance floor, to a quieter
      corner.

                                      KEANE
                    You live around here?

                                      AMANDA
                    For about a thousand years... Off
                    and on.

                                      KEANE
                          (with a smile)
                    Almost a native.
                          (beat)
                    You must know every Immortal in the
                    city.

                                      AMANDA
                          (teasing)
                    You looking for someone in particular?

                                      KEANE
                          (pointed)
                    Always.

                          (still playing)
                    What's her name?

                                      KEANE
                    Duncan MacLeod.

      Amanda covers her reaction.

                                      AMANDA
                    He a friend of yours?

                                      KEANE
                    We've got some unfinished business. 
                    You know him?

                                      AMANDA
                    Doesn't ring a bell.
                          (beat)
                    And speaking of unfinished business...

      She runs a hand along the open collar of his shirt, her
      message clear.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    My place?

16031603EXT.  NIGHTCLUB - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

      As Keane ushers Amanda toward his white MG, Amanda's eyes
      follow a couple of CUSTOMERS as they head inside.

                                      AMANDA
                            (distracted)
                    Did you know this was a convent once?

                                      KEANE
                    Next you'll tell me you were a nun.

                                      AMANDA
                    Tempting.  Black is my color.

      The two witnesses disappear out of sight as Keane turns away
      from Amanda to unlock the car.

      He holds the door open for her to get in and is taken
      completely off guard when

      AMANDA

      slams the door hard into his stomach.  He doubles over in
      pain as she pulls her sword out.




                                                                (CONTINUED)96516 "Forgive Us Our Trespasses" 4. Final Shooting Script 11/29/96

1603CONTINUED:1603

      KEANE

      struggles to draw his own sword, barely raises it in time to
      block Amanda's next blow.

      He scrambles away, on the retreat as he recovers his breath.

                                      KEANE (CONT'D)
                    And I thought you were only interested
                    in my body.
                          (beat)
                    Was it something I said?

                                      AMANDA
                    Duncan MacLeod.

      The smile fades from Keane's face, his charming demeanor
      replaced by intensity.

                                      KEANE
                    Where is he?

      Keane attacks with renewed interest, driving Amanda back
      against the car.

      AMANDA

      attacks with grace and a series of acrobatic moves, forcing

      KEANE

      to retreat.

      AMANDA

      drives her blade toward him.  She thrusts will all her
      strength.

      KEANE

      avoids it.  The blade drives into a brick and stone wall. 
      It breaks.

      Amanda retreats.  She can now fight only defensively but she
      doesn't give up.  Keane drives her back.  He grabs her
      swordarm with his free hand, holding it away from him.

      Amanda tries to get a knee in his groin but he avoids the
      blow.

                                      KEANE (CONT'D)
                    Not twice in one night, sweetheart.

      He leans on her, keeps her pinned.  He twists the sword out
      of her hand and his blade goes to her neck.

                    That makes two of us.

                    Then call MacLeod.

      He hands her the cell phone out of his jacket.  And off her
      trapped look --

16041604EXT.  DARIUS' CHURCH - NIGHT

      MacLeod heads into the church.  On edge as he gets the BUZZ.

16051605INT.  DARIUS' CHURCH - NIGHT

      MacLeod enters the darkened church.  Sees no one at first.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Amanda?

      She steps out of the shadows near the altar.  She looks a
      little shaky.

                                      AMANDA
                    Sorry...
                          (as Keane steps out
                            behind her)
                    I didn't have a choice.

                                      KEANE
                    I asked her to call you.

      MacLeod reads the dark look on Keane's face, understands.

                                      MACLEOD
                    And now I'm here.

                    Duncan MacLeod of the Clan MacLeod.

                    I know who you are.  I've hunted you
                    for more than 200 years.
                          (off MacLeod's look)
                    I'm Steven Keane... You really don't
                    remember?

                                      MACLEOD
                    No.

16061606EXT.  WOODS - SCOTLAND - 1746 - DAY

      The patchwork of colors of the MacLeod tartan... mud and
      blood adding to the pattern.

      MACLEOD

      on horseback, slogs through the scorched landscape.

      The sound of a grieving WAIL reaches his ears.  He spurs his
      horse tiredly towards the sound.

16071607EXT.  BURNT CROFTER S HUT - SCOTLAND - 1746 - DAY

      A scene of absolute destruction.  The home of a small farmer
      has been burnt to the ground, the remaining timbers still
      smoldering from the blaze.

      An old woman covered in soot sits cradling a mortally wounded
      young man in her arms.  She wails her grief to the sky.

      MacLeod dismounts, starts to water his horse amid the carnage. 
      There is nothing new in the destruction around him.  He's
      seen the same for days.

                                      GRANDMOTHER
                          (calling to him)
                    Look!  Look at what they've done to
                    us.

                          (re the lad's body)
                    He was only a lad.  They said they
                    couldn't let him grow into a rebel
                    like his father.
                          (through tears)
                    His father has been dead ten years. 
                    Got the fever in '35.  He never saw
                    the cursed war.

                    Where are our men?  Where is Prince
                    Charlie?

      MacLeod speaks, his voice as dead as he feels, as he moves
      to her.

                                      MACLEOD

                    If the war is over, why are they
                    still killing?

      MacLeod has no answer.

                                      GRANDMOTHER (CONT'D)
                          (re the house)
                    His mother and his sisters were
                    inside.  I begged the soldiers to
                    let them out.  They laughed.  They
                    said they couldn't let us breed.
                          (beat)
                    They burned them.  On the Earl's

                                      MACLEOD
                    Come away, Grandmother.  I'll help
                    you bury them.

      She looks at him with eyes burning with rage and grief, her
      voice tight with anger.

                                      GRANDMOTHER
                    You want to help me?
                          (re his sword)
                    Bury the English bastards who did
                    this.  Make the dogs pay!  Give me
                    my revenge!

      MacLeod reacts, his face hardens.

                          (Cold)
                    The Earl who gave the order -- what
                    was his name?

      MACLEOD S POV -- A CAMPFIRE

      and four English soldiers, RUPERT, WILLIE and two others,
      drinking around it.  A MURDERED SCOT and his WIFE hang from
      a tree nearby.  Rupert stokes the fire.  Willie hands him a
      bottle.

                                      RUPERT

                    nothing left in this stinking land
                    but oats and sheep.

      From the darkness, a musket is fired.

      WILLIE

      catches a musket ball between the eyes, goes down in a heap,
      the bottle flying from his hand.

                                      RUPERT
                    What the devil?

                    The Devil himself.

      RUPERT

      scrambles for his musket.  He fumbles it, terrified.  Before
      he can fire --

      MACLEOD

      attacks, sword slashing.  With a cry, Rupert drops backward,
      dead, landing across the fire.  He feels nothing.

      THE TWO OTHER SOLDIERS

      attack MacLeod from either side.

      MACLEOD

      Takes them both on simultaneously.  It is a quick but deadly
      battle as one Englishman falls, then the other.

16091609EXT.  ENGLISH COUNTRY ESTATE - 1746 - DAY

      RICHARD DUNBAR, the EARL OF ROSEMONT, walks the grounds with
      STEVEN KEANE.  A table is set up under a pavillion on the
      lawn; at it, Rosemont's WIFE puts out fruit and cheese.

      Nearby, Rosemont's two sons, MICHAEL, 8, and ANDREW, 4, play
      on the manicured lawns.

      The scene is a picture of domestic happiness.

      Keane looks relaxed and happy, but Rosemont is a bit edgy --
      he's been at war for the last few years, and is still uneasy
      at leisure.

                                      ROSEMONT
                    I lost scouting party after scouting
                    party -- they'd march into the woods
                    and we'd never find so much as their
                    bones.

                                      KEANE
                    I heard it went hard.

                                      ROSEMONT (CONT'D)
                    They were everywhere.  Any man or
                    boy that could raise a sword or a
                    scythe was against us.
                          (beat, with feeling)
                    Scottish devils left me no choice.

                                      KEANE
                    I should have been there, Richard.

                                      ROSEMONT
                    I thank God you were not, Steven.  I
                    trusted you to look after my wife
                    and sons.

                                      KEANE
                    You're my family.
                          (beat)
                    As much as I've ever had.

                                      ROSEMONT
                          (beat)
                    There are days I thought I'd never
                    see them again.  It seemed that damned
                    war would go on for a thousand years.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96516 "Forgive Us Our Trespasses" 11. Final Shooting Script 11/29/96

      They've reached the table.  Rosemont's wife hands them wine
      glasses as:

                                      KEANE
                    But in the end you got the better of
                    them.

                                      ROSEMONT
                      Cumberland was ready to march home
                    after the rout, but I convinced him
                    we had to finish it.  We had to leave
                    a mark -- make sure the Jacobites
                    were wiped out.
                          (without pleasure)
                    We cut down every man in tartan we
                    could find.

                                      KEANE
                    If there was another way, you would
                    have found it.

                                      ROSEMONT
                    Would I?  Or was I too full of hate
                    to look?

      Keane reacts to a distressed look from Rosemont's wife.

                                      KEANE
                    No more talk of the war.  It's over
                    and you're here.  Josephine prayed
                    for it every night.

      Rosemont turns to his wife.

                                      ROSEMONT
                    Now you must have a new prayer,
                      Josephine.  Pray this victory holds. 
                    Pray those Highland bastards got the
                    message.
                            (determined)
                    I won't have my sons called to fight
                    this battle again.

      At this, their attention is caught by the happy SHOUTS of
      Michael as he runs by with a brightly colored kite bouncing
      behind him.

                                      MICHAEL
                    Father, Uncle Steven, look!

      Rosemont looks at his son with joy.

                                      KEANE
                    Very good, Michael!

      The little boy runs off, then turns back to his father.

                                      MICHAEL
                    Come, Father!

      Rosemont turns to Keane.

                                      ROSEMONT
                    Walk with me.

      Rosemont and Keane follow Michael onto the grounds of the
      estate.

16101610EXT.  ENGLISH COUNTRY ESTATE - THE GROUNDS - 1746 - DAY

      Rosemont and Keane walk through a wooded area of the estate. 
      They walk along the path while Michael darts in and out of
      the woods.

                                      ROSEMONT
                    You have great patience with children,
                    Steven.  You should have some of
                    your own.

                                      KEANE
                    It's easier for some than others.

      ON MICHAEL

      as he follows a twining ivy runner off the path, between the
      trees.  The sudden sound of hoofbeats and Michael looks up
      to see

      DUNCAN MACLEOD

      looming above him on horseback.  Haggard and bearded, his
      outfit stained with mud and blood, MacLeod has been on the
      warpath since Culloden.  He has the obvious look of a
      desperate man.

      He swings off the horse as we CUT TO:

      ROSEMONT

      as he hears his son's SCREAM O.S.

      Whipping his dress sword out of its scabbard, Rosemont plunges
      into the woods.  Keane, his sword also drawn, moves with
      him.  They come face to face with

      MACLEOD

      holding the terrified boy by the arm.

                                      KEANE
                          (re the boy)
                    Let him go.
                          (to Rosemont)
                    He's here for me... Leave us.

                                      MACLEOD
                    No.  Stay.

      And off Keane's surprised look, MacLeod pulls a pistol and
      shoots Keane dead.

                                      ROSEMONT
                    My God!

      Rosemont kneels by his fallen friend.  He checks.  Keane is
      dead.  He looks up at MacLeod.

                                      ROSEMONT (CONT'D)
                    Please.  Don't hurt my son.

      MacLeod looks to him out of hate-darkened eyes.

                                      MACLEOD
                    That's what a thousand Scottish
                    mothers screamed when your soldiers
                    murdered their children.

      Rosemont is shaken.  This wild creature is like a nightmare
      come to life.

                                      ROSEMONT
                    Who are you?

                                      MACLEOD
                    A man of Scotland your butchers
                    couldn't kill.

                                      ROSEMONT
                    It was war!

                                      MACLEOD
                    It still is.

                                      ROSEMONT
                    Let go of my son.  Let him go, and
                    face me.

      There's a beat, then MacLeod shoves the child away from him
      in disgust.

      The boy staggers back, staring, but doesn't leave.  MacLeod
      turns on him, grinning, like the bogeyman.

                                      MACLEOD
                    That's right boy, run.  Run and tell
                    every English boy you meet that Duncan
                    MacLeod is coming for their fathers.
                          (out of control)

                      children's children, they're not
                    safe from me.

      Rosemont gets between MacLeod and his petrified son.  Raises
      his saber.  MacLeod bats the liqht sword away with fury, and
      as his sword raises to strike down Rosemont.

                    goodbyes.

      He pulls open the door to leave, stops for one last word:

                                      KEANE
                    If you run, I ll find you.

      As Keane exits, to his departing back:

                                      MACLEOD
                    I won't run.

      He looks after Keane grimly; Amanda watches him nervously.

16121612EXT.  DARIUS' CHURCH - NIGHT

      MacLeod strides away from the church, Amanda scurrying to
      keep up.

                                      AMANDA
                    Look, I'm really sorry.  The guy had
                    a sword to my throat.  I didn't know
                    what else to do, I figured, Holy
                    Ground, they ll talk...

                                      MACLEOD
                    You did the right thing.

                                      AMANDA
                    Yeah?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Yeah.
                          (A bittersweet smile)
                    I really prefer you with all your
                    parts intact.

                                      AMANDA
                    Yeah, well, you and I both.

      MacLeod stops walking and turns to Amanda.  There's something
      a touch troubled in his tone.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What do you know about Keane?

                                      AMANDA
                    I just met him, honest.
                          (real regret)
                    He seemed like such a nice guy.

                    And now you're going to have to kill
                    him.

      MacLeod's eyes turn away from hers.  He starts walking away. 
      As Amanda watches him for a moment with concern, her stomach
      tightens in an anxious jumble.96516 "Forgive Us Our Trespasses" 16. Final Shooting Script 11/29/96

      Amanda reaches to tuck the covers over MacLeod.  As her hand
      brushes his shoulder, he comes suddenly awake, his eyes wide,
      and grabs her arm hard, defensively.  His free hand goes to
      his waist as though to pull a dagger.

                                      AMANDA
                    MacLeod!

      He comes completely awake and realizes what he's doing. 

                                      AMANDA
                          (a slight quaver)
                    It's just me.

      He releases her, settles back, still shaky.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm sorry, I just.... I was dreaming.

                                      AMANDA
                    You want to tell me about it?

      MacLeod just shakes his head.  Tousled and vulnerable, he
      looks like a scared child.

      Amanda wraps the blanket around him and snuggles down beside
      him, cradling him in her arms.

      He nods tightly, his eyes still far away.  As he puts an arm
      around her and tries to settle back into the bed, we PUSH IN
      on his wide, stress-filled eyes, and we HEAR what he's hearing --
      the CLASHING of sword on sword, the SHOUTS of dying men...

16221622EXT.  BARGE - NIGHT

      MacLeod gazes out across the still Seine... fog creeping
      upriver.  Amanda approaches tentatively.

                                      AMANDA
                    MacLeod?
                          (off no answer; softer)
                    Duncan?

      MacLeod comes out of his funk enough to notice her very real
      concern.

                                      MACLEOD
                      I couldn't sleep.

                                      AMANDA
                      I noticed.

      She moves close, wraps her arms around him from behind. 
      There's a silent beat, then --

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    So, I was thinking... How about a
                    trip to the beach?

      He knows what she's getting at, just shakes his head.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    Tahiti's nice... no phones, no
                    clothes, no worrying about tan lines
                    or mysterious Immortals coming out
                    of the woodwork....
                          (off MacLeod's look)
                    Okay, there was that one guy, what
                    was his name, Grenville?

      She moves in on him with a suggestive stroke.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    But he's gone now.  It'd be just you
                    and me.  I take out that old copy of
                    the Kama Sutra...

                    I have to deal with this.

                    What exactly do you mean "deal with
                    this?"

      He doesn't answer.  Not directly.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It never should have happened.

                          (a hard won lesson:)
                    It was no answer.

                                      AMANDA
                    What are you saying?

                      a murderer.

      She stares at him.  Truly stunned.

                                      AMANDA
                    So what?  It happened 250 years ago! 
                    They're all dead now -- the ones you
                    killed, the ones he killed, four
                      generations of their children.
                          (in his face)

                    You think anyone but Keane gives a
                    damn?

      He doesn't answer, his eyes far away.  Amanda is getting
        increasingly frustrated.  Amanda looks at him for a long
      moment.  There are tears in her eyes, but she's forcing them
      back, forcing herself to stay tough.

16231623INT.  METHOS' ATELIER - NIGHT

      A fifth-floor atelier with high ceilings and garret windows. 
      The open space is furnished eclectically, ultra modern mixed
      with ancient, all surrounding a comfy couch.  The only light
      in the room is moonlight through the tall windows, and the
      blue glow of a computer left running on an enormous desk
      littered with books and papers.

      Under the windows, an uncomplicated bed; and in it, a sleeping
      figure.  METHOS.

      The BUZZ hits and he rolls over even as he comes awake,
      slipping out of bed in a single graceful move, taking up his
      sword from its place nearby.

      He moves away from the windows, picking the best spot for a
      confrontation.

      There's suddenly loud POUNDING on the door and he turns that
      way, sword ready, as --

                                      AMANDA (O.S.)
                    Methos!  Methos, open the damn door,
                    it's me!

      With a long suffering sigh, Methos lowers his sword and opens
      the door.

                                      METHOS
                    A little louder, why don't you, I'm
                    not sure they heard you in
                      Philadelphia.

                                      AMANDA
                    Sorry.  It's an emergency.

      She pushes the door open and comes in.

                                      METHOS
                    It's a good way to lose your head,
                    is what it is.

                                      AMANDA
                          (unimpressed)
                    Aren't you turning into the old
                    grouch?

      She reacts to the sight of him, standing there in nothing
      but his underwear, sword in hand.

                                      AMANDA (CONT'D)
                    Did I... interrupt something?
                          (off his empty bed)
                    A really good dream, maybe?

      Methos hasn't got the energy to spar with her.

                                      METHOS
                    Amanda... It's four in the morning. 
                    I wasn't exactly expecting company.
                          (a sigh)
                    Give me a minute.

16241624INT.  METHOS' ATELIER - KITCHEN - A FEW MINUTES LATER

      Methos, now dressed, and Amanda sit at the table with cups
      of coffee.  She's explained the situation to him.

                                      AMANDA
                    Do you know anything about this Steven
                    Keane guy?

                                      METHOS
                    Never met him.

                                      AMANDA
                          (a little awkward)
                    I thought maybe... The Watchers...
                    After all, you guys know everything.

                                      METHOS
                    I'm done with the Watchers.

                                      AMANDA
                    You're kidding!  I thought you'd
                    found the perfect hiding place.

                                      METHOS
                    I changed my mind.
                          (into his mug)
                    Sorry I can't help.

                                      AMANDA
                    Maybe you could talk to MacLeod. 
                    Convince him Keane is wrong about
                    him.

      Methos gives her a startled look.

                                      METHOS
                    You want me to talk to MacLeod...
                    and tell him to stop worrying, he's
                    not a bad guy?
                          (off her nod)
                    Trust me, Amanda, that is not going
                    to work.

                                      AMANDA
                    Well, we have to do something!
                          (earnest)
                    I've never seen him like this.  He's
                    really shook up.  You know how guilt-
                    ridden he can be.

                                      METHOS
                    And makes all of us.

                                      AMANDA
                    If he goes up againt Keane thinking
                    he deserves to lose, he'll lose.
                          (she can hardly say
                          it)
                    He'll die, Methos.

      And off Methos' reaction --

16251625EXT.  LUXEMBOURG GARDENS - NEAR ENTRANCE - DAY

      MacLeod heads for his rendezvous with Keane.  He's looking
      grim and imposing in his long coat.  You might not even notice
      the drawn look to his face, a tiredness around the eyes --
      he didn't get much sleep.

      He gets the BUZZ and his hand goes under his coat as

      METHOS

      steps out from behind the trees.

      There's a beat while the two men regard each other.

                                      METHOS
                    Nice morning for it.  Not too cold,
                    ground's nice and dry.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Amanda's got a big mouth.

                                      METHOS
                    She's worried about you.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (hostile)
                    And you?

                                      METHOS
                          (a shrug)
                    Call it scholarly interest.  I just
                    came by to watch the perfect Immortal
                    die.

      MacLeod hasn't got the patience for Methos' needling.  He
      starts to move past him.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm not.

                                      METHOS
                    Not going to die, or not perfect?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Methos, what do you want?

                                      METHOS
                    I want you to give yourself a break. 
                    I want you to admit you're human.
                          (before MacLeod can
                            answer)
                    Not to me.  To yourself.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Go away!

      MacLeod starts walking but Methos steps in his face.

                                      METHOS
                    None of us are perfect.  Not me, not
                    you, not even Darius.  And not, I'm
                    sure, your friend Steven Keane.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Maybe you should write fortune
                    cookies.

                                      METHOS
                    Just so long as I'm not writing your
                    epitaph.
                          (beat)
                    What Keane hates you for happened. 
                    Nothing you can do will ever change

                          (beat)
                    Accept it.  It's part of who you
                    were.
                          (beat)
                    It doesn't change who you are now.

      There's no way MacLeod can hear this from Methos.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Are we still talking about me?

                                      METHOS
                    Yes.
                          (in MacLeod's face)
                    What happened after Culloden, MacLeod? 
                    Do you remember?

                                      MACLEOD
                          (quiet)
                    I went after innocent men, and
                      slaughtered them.

                                      METHOS
                    That's how Keane tells it.  I want
                    to know how you remember it.
                          (pushing him)
                    They weren't innocent men then, were
                    they?  They were the murderers, the
                    English bastards who destroyed your
                    people.  They deserved to die.  All
                    of them.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Did they?

                          (no letup)
                    You thought so.  You wanted to kill,
                    and you killed.  And Keane's just
                    like you.  Dividing the world up
                    into Good and Evil.  Well it's not
                    that simple.  We're all good and
                    evil.  We feel rage and compassion. 
                    Love and hate.  Murder... and
                      forgiveness.

                    Try forgiving yourself, for once.

      A beat.  Once, this speech might have gotten through.  But
      now, there's too much history between the two men -- MacLeod
      is shutting Methos out.

                                      MACLEOD
                    How about you try minding your own
                    business, for once.  And tell Amanda
                    to do the same.

                                      METHOS
                    She can't say I didn't try.

      Methos takes a beat, then steps aside with a theatrical bow.

      As MacLeod walks by him, Methos steps in behind him and
        unexpectedly clubs him in the back of the head.

      MacLeod falls unconscious.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    You are such a pain in the ass.

16261626EXT.  LUXEMBOURG GARDENS - DAY

      Steven Keane waits tensely by a marble fountain, scanning
      the area.  Ready for his appointment with MacLeod.

      He gets the BUZZ and turns to see

      METHOS

        approaching, sword in hand.

                                      KEANE
                    I don't think we've met.
                          (without hostility)
                    Steven Keane.

                                      METHOS
                    So I hear.

      He raises his sword in challenge.  Keane pulls his own
        defensively, but steps back.

                                      KEANE
                    I have no fight with you.

                                      METHOS
                    That's true.

                    If you leave Paris and leave Duncan
                    MacLeod alone.

      Keane goes into a fighting stance at the mention of MacLeod.

                    Guy's got a lot of friends.

                                      METHOS
                    Good men often do.

                                      KEANE
                    A good man?  You must not know him
                    very well.

                                      METHOS
                    You'd be surprised.
                          (beat)
                    Leave him be, Keane.  You want to
                    rid the world of Evil, there are
                    better targets.

                                      KEANE
                    You try and stop me, I'll start with
                    you.

                                      METHOS
                    Your call.

      He makes the first strike and the fight is joined.

      Keane is good with a sword, no question about it.  As good
      as MacLeod, and as confident in his own abilities.  He varies
      his style, incorporating moves from different disciplines,
      parrying everything Methos comes at him with.

      But good as Keane is, he's just holding his own.  Every time
      he thinks he has a shot at Methos, Methos has a move of his
      own, dodging and defending.  It's a tough fight between men
      equally matched in ability and determination.

      Then, unexpectedly, Methos hits a slippery patch on the
      ground, stumbling, giving Keane a chance to press the attack. 
      Keane drives in close, ready to finish it --

      And finds a dagger buried in his gut.  The slip was a feint
      to draw him in, and he fell for it.

      As Keane sinks to his knees, he looks up at Methos.

                                      KEANE
                    You bastard.

                    Sticks and stones...

      Keane topples to the ground, "dead."  Methos raises his sword
      to take Keane's head and end it.  As he does, a BUZZ, and

      comes running up.  Pissed beyond belief.

      He skids to a stop, takes in the scene before him: Keane
      dead on the ground, Methos with his sword raised.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    You do it, and I'm next.

      Methos looks at him in disbelief.

                                      METHOS
                    I am trying to save your head!

                                      MACLEOD
                    I don't need your help.
                          (no compromise)
                    Kill him, and you face me.
                          (off Methos' hesitation)
                    I swear it, Methos.

      Methos looks at MacLeod a beat.  Sees he isn't kidding. 
      Finally, he lowers his sword.

                                      METHOS
                    Fine.
                          (in disgust)
                    It's your funeral.

      He turns and goes, leaving MacLeod there with Keane's body.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:

16271627EXT.  LUXEMBOURG GARDENS     DAY

      MacLeod waits as Keane coughs back to life.  Almost before
      he knows where he is, Keane is scrambling to his knees,
      grabbing his sword, on the defensive.

      He sees MacLeod standing over him sword held loosely.

                                      KEANE
                    What happened to your friend?

                                      MACLEOD
                          (with sarcasm)
                    It s Tuesday.  He remembered that he
                    doesn't take heads on Tuesday.

                                      KEANE
                    Then why didn't you take it?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Because I don't want it.
                          (a beat, earnest)
                    Look we don't need to be enemies.

                                      KEANE
                    There's nothing else we can be.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You didn't see the women and children
                    butchered on Dunbar s orders.

                                      KEANE
                    Dunbar was a general in a hard war. 
                    People died.

                                      MACLEOD
                    And so did he.

                                      KEANE
                    I don't care what he did.  Only what
                    you did.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Culloden was a long time ago.

                                      KEANE,
                    A hundred years, a thousand, you
                    still have to pay for it.

                    I do, every day.  I live with it.  I
                    see the faces I of the men I killed.

                                      KEANE
                          (correcting him)
                    Murdered.

                                      MACLEOD
                    And killing me is going to bring
                    them back?

                                      KEANE
                    No, but it ll make me feel a helluva
                    lot better.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Revenge doesn't make anything better.

                                      KEANE
                          (a pained beat)
                    I had a friend who said the same
                    thing to me once.  He was a great
                    man.  He spent ten lifetimes caring
                    for people.
                          (beat)
                    Maybe you remember him.  His name
                    was Sean Burns.
                          (off MacLeod's reaction)
                    You killed him.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:

16281628INT.  SEAN BURNS' STUDY - 1779 - DAY

      A comfortable, wood-paneled room, lined with books and
        manuscripts.  SEAN BURNS sits listening behind his desk as
      Keane, haggard and travel-weary, paces around the room.

                                      KEANE
                    I've tracked him for thirty years,
                    Sean.  To Russia, to Constantinople,
                    across North Africa, even as far as
                    China.  But I'm always a day behind,
                    a week behind, a month behind.  A
                    year ago his ship went down off
                    Shanghai; since then, nothing.  I'm
                    beginning to think I'll never catch
                    up with him.

                                    SEAN
                    Maybe it's for the best, my friend.

                          (intense)
                    I swore on Richard Dunbar's body
                    that I would find the man who killed
                    him.  I swore to his wife and children
                    that I wouldn't rest until MacLeod
                    was dead.

                                    SEAN
                    And for thirty years you've thought
                    of nothing else.

                    Thirty years that might have been
                    spent helping Dunbar's family.  Thirty
                    years of your life, wasted.

                    It's long enough, Steven.  Let it
                    go.

                                      KEANE
                    How can I?  How can I, when that
                    murderer is out there?

                                    SEAN
                    You're so certain you have to kill
                    him.
                          (beat)
                    What do you know about Duncan MacLeod,
                    Steven?
                          (off Keane's look)
                    Do you know why he left Europe?  Why
                    he went East?

                                      KEANE
                    Does it matter?

                                    SEAN
                      Everything matters.

                    In every century I've lived, there's

                    said would end war.  There's been a

                    side or another, always believing in
                    their hearts that theirs was the
                    side God was on.

                    Until one day they look around.  And
                    they're sick and they want to wretch
                    for the pain of it.  And they ride  -
                    ride until they can't ride anymore,
                    hoping they'll find something
                    different across the steppes, or
                    across the Atlantic.  Hoping, praying
                    they won't have to keep killing.

      He rises and comes to Keane, takes him by the shoulders.

                                    SEAN
                    And one day, Steven, that day will

                    Burns is anything but a murdering
                    bastard who deserves to die.

      MacLeod is caught off guard by this, he doesn't have an answer --
      not anything that will satisfy Keane.

                    Could the evil overwhelm the good? 
                    I've spent years thinking about it. 
                    The truth is, I don't know.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I do.

                    And when it happens?  Which one is
                    real?  The Immortal you were.... or
                    the one you've become?

      He's going over.  Face hardening.  He draws his sword.

                                    SEAN
                    I could fight you, Duncan, but you're
                    better.  I know it and so do you.

                    That s too bad.

      MacLeod raises the blade --

                                      MACLEOD
                    It was a mistake.  I never meant for
                    it to happen.  I couldn't stop myself.

                                      KEANE
                    Sure.  What was it this time?  You
                    were drunk?  Drugged?  Temporarily
                    insane?
                          (with sarcasm)
                    Maybe you thought he was somebody
                    else?
                          (in disgust)
                    Maybe you just didn't care.

      MacLeod is losing patience with Keane's snide attitude.

                                      MACLEOD
                    it's hot that simple, Keane.
                          (pointed)
                    You weren't there.  You can't know.

                                      KEANE
                    I don't need to know.
                          (cold)
                    I don't judge your reasons, MacLeod. 
                    I judge your acts.

      He raises his blade, ready to fight.  MacLeod raises his in
      response, his expression going hard, putting aside doubt:

                                      MACLEOD
                          (as a last warning)
                    Walk away.

      Keane attacks.  They are interrupted by the WHOOPING of
      sirens.

      Two POLICE CARS approach.

      The two men slip their swords out of sight as the two cars
      screech to a halt and police pile out.

                    Duncan MacLeod?

      MacLeod glances at Keane, did he set this up?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm Duncan MacLeod.

                                      INSPECTOR BEGUE
                    I'd like you to come with me, if you
                    don't mind.

      It's not a request.  As MacLeod gets into one of the police
      cars with the Inspector, he locks eyes with Keane -- this
      isn't over.

16311631INT.  BARGE - DAY

      MacLeod enters with the Inspector and a couple of Uniformed
      Cops.

                                      MACLEOD
                    How about telling me what this is
                    about, Inspector?

                                      INSPECTOR BEGUE
                    We received an anonymous tip.

                                      MACLEOD
                    And do you always send five men and
                    two patrol cars out on anonymous
                    tip?

                                      INSPECTOR BEGUE
                    I like to be thorough.
                          (off MacLeod's look)
                    The caller was very persuasive.  And
                    very specific.
                          (gesturing to the bed)
                    With your permission?

      MacLeod shrugs.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Do I have a choice?

      The Inspector nods to one of the Uniforms, who tosses aside
      the bedclothes and shifts the mattress to reveal

      A NECKLACE

      of diamonds and pearls.

      THE INSPECTOR

      lifts the necklace with a pen and drops it into an evidence
      baggie.

                                      INSPECTOR BEGUE
                    I expect you'll tell me you've never
                    seen this before.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (resigned)
                    How about we skip that part and you
                    go ahead and tell me where you think
                    I got it.

                                      INSPECTOR BEGUE
                    It belongs to a collection of pieces
                    that were stolen from the Countess
                    Pekowsky three years ago.  The
                      collection was valued at something
                    over three million dollars.  This
                    necklace alone is worth $750,000.
                          (beat)
                    You're under arrest, Mr. MacLeod.

      And, as the Uniform snaps the cuffs on MacLeod --

16321632INT.  PRISON VISITING ROOM - DAY

      Where Amanda sits on the other side of the bulletproof
      Plexiglas divider from MacLeod.  There's a guard just out of
      earshot of their intense whispers.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Amanda, this is amazing, even for
                    you.

                                      AMANDA
                    I know, that necklace would bring
                    half a million, even hot.
                          (with a smile)
                    But you're worth it.

                                      MACLEOD
                    This is not funny!

                                      AMANDA
                    No, it's not funny, it's deadly
                    serious.
                          (beat)
                    You're safe in here.  With your
                    squeaky clean record, you'll get a

                    Who knows?  Two, three years, anything
                    can happen.  Maybe we'll get lucky
                    and someone'll whack him before you
                    get out.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Dammit, Amanda, you can't do this.

      MacLeod slams the table.

                                      AMANDA
                    Look, I know you're upset now, but

                    Amanda, listen to me.  I want you to
                    get me out of here.  Whatever it
                    takes, you do it.

                                      AMANDA
                          (beat)
                    Nope, I've invested a lot of time in

                    around.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (intense)
                    I can take Keane.

                                      AMANDA
                    I don't think so... The guy's good. 
                    If you had it together, I'd say six
                    to five on you, but in your present
                    state...

                                      MACLEOD
                    Amanda!

      The Guard looks over at MacLeod's shout; MacLeod schools his
      voice back down to a low growl.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    I have to have this fight.  It's the
                    only way to settle this.

                    you'll be a wanted man.  Probably
                    have to leave France.  Either way,
                    you're out of Keane's reach for a

      She turns with a little wave and is out the door.

      MacLeod stares after her for a beat, something brewing in
      his mind.  Then he turns to the hovering Guard.

                                      MACLEOD

                    There you are.

      He stands ready by the door.

      It opens, and Keane grabs the man who comes through, yanks
      him inside, throws him against the wall, his sword going to
      his throat.

      It's METHOS.

      Keane backs off, but not much -- still holding Methos hard
      against the wall.

                                      KEANE
                    Where's MacLeod?

      There's a beat, their eyes locked.  Then Keane, with a
      frustrated snarl, shoves Methos away and storms out.

      Methos blows a sigh of relief, glad he was right about Keane.

      amusement, pouring out a couple drinks.

                                      AMANDA
                    That son-of-a-bitch! That double-
                    dealing swine!
                          (beat)
                    How could he do this to me?  There's
                    cops all over my house, he even gave
                    up my secret stash of rainy-day
                    jewels.
                          (off Methos' look)
                    Well, one of them.

                                      METHOS
                    Honestly, Amanda, what did you expect? 
                    You framed him and got him sent to
                    prison.  Did you think he'd just sit
                    still for that?

      He holds out a glass.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    Have a drink.  You'll feel better.

      She ignores it.

                                      AMANDA
                    Ratted out by my own friend.

                                      METHOS
                    Correct me if I misunderstood you,
                    but wasn't that after you framed
                    him?

                                      AMANDA
                    I save his life.  And he turns on
                    me!

                                      METHOS
                    I know the feeling.

                                      AMANDA
                          (with emotion)
                    I was trying to help him.  I didn't
                    care how mad he got at me, as long
                    as it kept him alive.

      Her voice catches on her very real worry.  Methos reacts,
      puts down his glass and moves to her.

                                      METHOS
                    I know.
                          (small comfort)
                    Look, you did what you could.  We
                    both did.  Now it's up to him.
                          (beat)
                    MacLeod's lived this long.  That's
                    not luck.

                                      AMANDA
                    But it's not all skill, either.
                          (beat)
                    He's fought guys older than him,
                    maybe even guys better than him, and
                    won.  Because he never gives up, not
                    when he thinks he's right.

                                      METHOS
                          (a wry smile)
                    And it can be damned annoying, let
                    me tell you.

                                      AMANDA
                    But not this time.  This time his
                    heart's not in it.
                          (beat, with real fear)
                    What if he doesn't win?  What if he
                    doesn't come back?

      As Methos awkwardly moves to comfort her --

16381638INT.  DARIUS' CHURCH - DAY

      MacLeod sits pensively, his thoughts with Darius.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I don't know what happens to us when
                    we die, Darius.  I don't know if
                    maybe you're still here somewhere,
                    listening to me.
                          (beat)
                    I hope you are.

      There's no response from the quiet church, but MacLeod finds
      the strength to continue:

                                      MACLEOD
                    I can't tell you the number of times
                    I've wished you were here so I could
                    talk to you.  There are so many things
                    I didn't ask you.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                          (beat)
                    What happened to you, Darius?  Did
                    you wake up one morning and decide
                    you were sick of the death and the
                    blood and the sounds of men dying?

      There's a long silence as MacLeod gathers his thoughts into
      words, then:

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    He's a good man.  I don't want to
                    kill him.
                          (beat)
                    All he's done is judge me.  Like
                    I've judged others.
                          (emotional)
                    I'm so tired of killing.  I'm so
                    tired of deciding who to kill.

      He looks up at the altar, at the cross.

16391639EXT.  NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

      Keane is getting out of his car when he gets the BUZZ.  He
      turns to see

      AMANDA

        approaching.

      Keane moves to meet her.

                                      KEANE
                    You want another shot? 
                          (without charm)
                    I warn you, I'll finish it if you
                    make me.

                                      AMANDA
                    I'm not here to fight.  I'm here to
                    talk.

16401640INT.  NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

      The night is still young, the place isn't crowded yet.  Keane
      and Amanda are at his table in a quiet corner.

                                      KEANE
                    If you've come to talk about MacLeod
                    you're wasting your breath.

                                      AMANDA
                    Humor me.

                          (beat)
                    Look, Steven, I don't know you.  But
                    I know MacLeod.  I know he's a guy
                    who doesn't make promises he can't
                    keep.  Who carries a grudge a long
                    time.
                          (beat)
                    A guy who can actually talk about
                    things like justice and honor with a
                    straight face.

                                      KEANE
                    A guy who hunts down and kills
                    innocent men.

                                      AMANDA
                    Maybe.  'Cause that's the kind of
                    mistake you make when you think it
                    matters who lives and who dies.

                                      KEANE
                          (with sarcasm)
                    The voice of experience.

                                      AMANDA
                    I've been around a lot longer than
                    either of you, and I can tell you,
                    it isn't going to make one bit of
                      difference to the big bad world
                    whether you kill him or he kills
                    you.
                          (beat)
                    But it makes a difference to me.  It
                    makes a difference to a lot of people
                    who care about MacLeod.  Why don't
                    you try thinking about them?

                                      KEANE
                    Because that doesn't matter.

                                      AMANDA
                    Listen to yourself.  Isn't that what
                    MacLeod was thinking when he went
                    after your friend -- that his idea
                    of justice was more important than
                    the people he was hurting?
                          (beat)
                    What are you going to think of
                    yourself a hundred years from now,
                    Steven, when someone's coming after
                    you for killing a good man, and you're
                    trying to explain your reasons?

                    I hope he listens when your friends
                    stand up for you.

      Whatever answer Keane is about to make is interrupted as the
      both get the BUZZ.

      MACLEOD

      enters the club and heads for them.  Keane rises, leans down
      to Amanda.

                                      KEANE
                          (with surprising
                            sincerity)
                    I hope I'll have someone like you to
                    speak for me.
                          (turning to MacLeod)
                    You ready?

                                      MACLEOD
                    When you are.
                          (to Amanda)
                    You keep out of it.

      Amanda is about to object.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    I mean it.

      She nods, tears welling, says nothing.  Keane sees it, has a
      moment of sympathy.

                                      KEANE
                          (to MacLeod)
                    On the roof.  Five minutes.

      He nods to Amanda, turns and heads out.  MacLeod turns to
      Amanda.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (without anger)
                    This has to happen.

      She's done arguing.  Knows she can't convince him.  Instead,
      she moves into his arms, holds on tight.

                                      AMANDA
                    I know.

      She steps back, meets his eyes.  Forcing her voice steady:

                    Okay, MacLeod, you listen to me. 
                    You're going up there, it's not about
                    Culloden, it's not about the Earl of
                    Rosemont, you forget about all of
                    that.
                          (through tears)
                    You just think about coming back,
                    okay?

                                      MACLEOD
                          (a wry smile)
                    With my shield, or on it.

      Not exactly the answer she was looking for, but she'll take
      it.

      He kisses her gently and heads out.

16411641EXT.  ROOFTOP - NIGHT

      MacLeod comes up the fire escape and joins Keane on the roof. 
      There's a ceremonial moment as the two opponents face each
      other.

                                      KEANE
                    I've waited a long time for this.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Maybe we both have.

      Keane is the first to attack, closing in on MacLeod with a
      series of rapid feints.

      MacLeod guards against Keane's dancing blade, eyes locked on
      his opponent, waiting for him to commit himself.

      Keane lunges and MacLeod dodges to one side, slashing at
      Keane as he goes past, just grazing him.

      Keane goes on the defensive, blood oozing from the cut.  He
      and MacLeod lunge and parry across the rooftop.

      MACLEOD

      is backing toward the roof's edge, blocking Keane's strikes. 
      He's running out of room.

      He tries a sideways dodge to get away from the edge, but
      Keane anticipates him, cuts hard --

      MACLEOD'S SWORD

      goes spinning off the roof.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96516 "Forgive Us Our Trespasses" 48. Final Shooting Script 11/29/96

1641CONTINUED:1641

      ON MACLEOD

      There's no time to panic, only time to react.  Keane rushes
      at him, sword raised to kill.  MacLeod drops to the ground,
      trips Keane, and shoves him from behind, sending him over
      the edge.

      KEANE

      falls the the alley below.

16421642EXT.  FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

      As MacLeod comes running down from the roof.

16431643EXT.  ALLEY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

      MacLeod scoops up his fallen sword from the ground even as

      KEANE

      staggers to his feet, still hurting from the fall, but not
      giving up.

      He rushes at MacLeod without grace, but with deadly
      determination.  MacLeod barely blocks the blow, and their
      swords lock.

      For a moment it's a struggle of muscle and will, bicep against
      bicep.  Then, with a grunt of exertion, MacLeod overpowers
      Keane.  Keane's sword bounces from his hand and Keane goes
      to his knees, disarmed and exhausted.

      MACLEOD

      raises the katana over his head.  He can end this here.

      But he doesn't.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Not this time.

      He reaches down, grabs Keane by the lapels, hauls him to his
      feet, so they're face to face.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Let it go.
                          (beat)
                    The war is over.

      He lets Keane drop and, without looking back, strides away.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      MacLeod, Amanda and Methos having a drink together.  The
      atmosphere relaxed and comfortable -- a new understanding
      has been reached.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You were really afraid I'd lose.

      Methos looks over with a wry half-smile.

                                      METHOS
                    And you weren't?

                                      MACLEOD
                    No.
                          (beat)
                    I knew Keane was good.
                          (to Amanda)
                    And I know you think I wanted him to
                    win.  But it wasn't that.
                            (thoughtful)
                    I had to fight the best fight of my
                    life, knowing he'd do the same....
                    and trust the fates to decide the
                    winner.

      Amanda looks at him, not quite getting it.  Methos does,
      though.

                                      METHOS
                    Trial by combat.  A bit outdated,
                    but it has its place.
                          (a satisfied nod)
                    Whoever survives is proved right in
                    the eyes of the law.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Something like that.

                                      AMANDA
                    But you let Keane live, too.  So
                    then who's right?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I never said it was simple.

                                      METHOS
                      Redemption never is.

      MacLeod nods in Methos' direction.

                                      AMANDA
                    And what if he comes after you again?

                                      MACLEOD
                    He won't.

                                      AMANDA
                    How do you know?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Because I wouldn't.

                                      AMANDA
                    He's not you.

                                      MACLEOD
                    And he's not that different.

      MacLeod shoots a look at Methos, measuring, before continuing:

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    None of us are.  We all make
                      mistakes... and we all have mistakes
                    to forgive.

      Methos meets his eyes, lifts his glass in silent
      acknowledgment of the unspoken message.

      MacLeod returns the toast.

      The moment between the two men is broken as Amanda puts her
      glass down and stands.

                                      AMANDA
                    Well, time to hit the road.  It seems
                    there's this Inspector who is
                      determined to throw my cute little
                    butt in jail.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (amused)
                    Sorry about that.

                                      AMANDA
                          (light)
                    You're forgiven.

      She leans in to kiss him.

                                      METHOS
                    I think that's my cue.

      He drains his glass, grab's his coat, and heads for the door
      as Amanda starts moving MacLeod toward the bed.

                                                                              FADE OUT.
