  11INT. JOHNNY S HOUSE - NIGHT 

          Bruce, in his "hot guy" party clothes, shakes off the
          rain, walks in.

                                        BRUCE
                                  (impatient)
                        Hey, man, let's get a move on! 
                        Some other guy could be hitting
                        on her right now!

          Bruce enters the living room, is startled to see a
            partially-assembled toy train set.  Johnny comes downstairs
          with an armload of dusty boxes of train stuff.

                                        BRUCE
                        No.  You are not doing this to me
                        again.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I found it in the attic.

                                        BRUCE
                        Johnny, I spent four weeks icing
                        this girl's totally healthy rotator
                        cuff until I got her number.  Now
                        she invites us to her birthday
                        party, complete with hot friends,
                        and you're playing with toys.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Lionels.  My dad gave me this set
                        when I just a kid.

                                        BRUCE
                        That's so amazingly poignant. 
                        Now let's go.

          Johnny is hardly listening to him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You see this?  It's a 6464-100
                        Blue Feather boxcar.  Look at
                        that: 1954. J.J.'s gonna be so
                        into this.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "GRAINS OF SAND" - TEASER - 1/24/05 - GOLD  2.


    1CONTINUED:1

                                        BRUCE
                        Listen, instead of playing with
                        trains, why don't you get on one. 
                        It's called the 'love train', and
                        it's leaving the station without
                        you.

          Johnny seems to be getting the message.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're right.  This is childish
                        and I'm beyond it.
                                (beat, then suddenly)
                        Hey, the caboose!

          And he's back into the train set.

                                        BRUCE
                        Susanna said eight, and if we
                        leave now, we'll be there within
                        the "cool, not desperate, but not
                        so late as to be rude" window.
                                (off Johnny's
                                  reluctance)
                        I can't go alone.  I'm not gonna
                        be Desperate Guy.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Everybody loves Desperate Guy. 
                        He makes them feel good about
                          themselves.
                                (holding up a train)
                          "Mountain Steam Locomotive".  You
                        know how rare this is? 

                                        BRUCE
                        Not as rare as a single, funny,
                        beautiful, female African-American
                        lawyer in Maine.  Get in the car. 


  22INT. JOHNNY'S CAR - NIGHT

          Torrential rain.  Bruce and Johnny drive along a country
          road.  Johnny's at the wheel, which Bruce hates.

                                        BRUCE
                        Brake before the curve, man, then
                        accelerate out.  It's simple
                          physics.

    2CONTINUED:2

                                        JOHNNY
                        "A," it's my car and "B," I've
                        been driving since I was sixteen,
                        and "C," I didn't even want to be
                        here.

                                        BRUCE
                        I hope we don't have to park too
                        far away.  I'm wearing my party
                        shoes.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Party shoes?

                                        BRUCE
                                (beat; happily)
                        Maybe no one will show because of
                        the rain and we'll have Susanna
                        and Gabrielle all to our ourselves.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What the hell?

          Johnny brakes as two FIGURES appear, silhouetted in the
          headlights (NOTE: one is JOSE, the driver).  They're
          injured, dazed and terrified.  As Johnny comes to a stop,
          to his surprise the people scatter into the woods.  Bruce
          jumps out.


  33EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT

                                        BRUCE
                        Whoa!  Wait!  Wait a minute!

          Johnny jumps out of the car, too, holding a flashlight.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Listen.

          Through the pouring rain, they catch glimpses of movement
          in the woods.  Johnny shines his flashlight into the
            darkness, but the people have vanished.  It's eerie.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (calls out)
                        Hello!  Is somebody down there?!

          He gets no answer -- all sound drowned out by the thunder
          of rushing water below.

                                        BRUCE
                        What's going on?



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "GRAINS OF SAND" - TEASER - 3/22/05 - GOLD-2  4.


    3CONTINUED:3

          Johnny sweeps his flashlight beam down the slope, it
          illuminates something we don't see.

                                        JOHNNY
                        There's something down there.

          Johnny hurries down the steep, wooded slope.  Bruce steps
          right into wet mud.

                                        BRUCE
                        There go my party shoes!

          Bruce FOLLOWS him down into the darkness.


  44EXT. RIVERBANK - CRASH SITE - NIGHT

          Johnny is making his way through the branches, Bruce behind
          him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Oh my God...


          CAMERA REVEALS A BADLY DAMAGED VAN

          It's nose down, tilted on its side in a rain-swollen
          stream, water up to the passenger side window.  It's caught
          on some rocks, about to be carried downstream and submerged
          by the rushing waters.  Johnny and Bruce wade in, rush to
          the back doors, wedged against a tree stump the van dragged

                        There's people still inside!

          Johnny shines his flashlight through the wire-mesh back
          door windows and we get a quick glimpse not of many people,
          but of the panicked face of one YOUNG WOMAN trapped inside,

          The freezing cold water rushing around them, Johnny and
          Bruce struggle to move the tree stump -- but it won't
          budge.

          Johnny and Bruce quickly work their way to the front of
          the van, which is wedged on the upstream side against a
          massive rock, a tree through its windshield.  Johnny shines
          his flashlight through a broken window to see the seats
          twisted out of place, and the woman, arms cut, head
            bleeding, pinned by the driver's seat against the side of
          the van only a foot of air left between her and the
            severely-dented ceiling.

          Johnny is up to his shoulders in water, detritus --
          clothes, a knapsack, styrofoam cups, etc. -- floating
          around him as he tries with all his might to move the
          driver's seat to free the woman, who's crying, trying to
          keep her head above the quickly rising water, looking
          like she's going to slip into unconsciousness. She's
          holding a bundle above the water, yells to Johnny.

                        Por favor, por favor!

          Johnny reaches for the bundle -- something wrapped in her
          coat.  Just as he's about to reach it, the VAN SHIFTS. 
          Johnny lurches forward.  The woman knows time's running
          out.

          Before Johnny knows what's happening, there's a bundle in
          his arms.  He looks down and sees A SIX MONTH OLD BABY.

                        I'm sorry about the party.

                                        BRUCE
                        What party?  Oh. 

          He is cut off by a familiar voice that freezes them both
          on the spot.

                                        SARAH (O.S.)
                          Helloooo... thank God, you've got
                        power.  J.J.'s at a sleepover,
                        Walt's on graveyard shift and the
                        power went out --

    10CONTINUED:10

          Sarah enters, soaking wet, removing her rain coat before
          they can even move.  She, of course, has no idea anything
          is wrong.

                                        SARAH
                        ...It creeps me out to sit home
                        alone in the dark.  Hey, you guys. 
                                (sees him)
                        Baby? 
                                (to baby)
                        Aren't you a cutie?

          Bruce looks at Johnny.

                                        BRUCE
                        Good luck.  Sarah.

          Bruce grabs his coat and leaves.

                                        SARAH
                        Making ends meet by babysitting?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not exactly.  Do you think his
                        diaper needs changing?

                                        SARAH
                                (sniffs)
                        Yes.  And this "historic" playpen--
                          violates every child safety law.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Was good enough for me.

                                        SARAH
                        Come on, whose baby is it?

          Johnny starts to lie...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Uh, friend of mine...

          Sarah, her bullshit radar up, eyes him as she changes the
          diaper.

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny?  
                                (looking around)
                        Why did you buy so many diapers?

                        I think I'll stand.

          As Johnny searches for the words...

                                                                                  CUT TO:


  1111EXT. CRASH SITE - SAME TIME - NIGHT

          Still pouring.  The strobing lights of police and rescue
            vehicles.  Walt and Roscoe scan the crash site with
            flashlights.  A fluorescent beam falls upon a woman's
          SHOE.

                                                                                BACK TO:


  1212INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER - NIGHT

          Sarah stares at Johnny.  She trusts him, so she's trying
          to go along with what he's told her, but it's not easy.

                                        SARAH
                        That must have been a hell of a
                        vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It was.

                                        SARAH
                        How long are you planning on
                        keeping him?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Just until I see that it's going
                        to be okay.  I'm going to try to
                        find his family, figure out where
                        he's from.
                                (beat)
                        His mother... it was awful, Sarah.

          Sarah absorbs this, knowing full well what mothers do for
          their children.  The baby starts to cry, Sarah tries to
          soothe him.

                                        SARAH
                        Shhhhh.

          But he just cries harder.

                        He likes the train.

          As Johnny takes the baby, shows him the train -- WHOOSH!


  1313INT. JOHNNY'S LIVING ROOM - DAY - VISION

          The baby morphs into the FOUR-YEAR-OLD BOY we saw in the
          teaser vision.  He and Johnny are playing with the trains. 
          The train set is growing: Johnny, now an indulgent adoptive
          parent, has clearly been shopping. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, Mikey, look at the new
                          caboose.

          The little boy grabs it.

                                        MIKEY
                              A ninety-two-seventy-three?! 
                        Cool!

          He and Johnny laugh like fathers and sons do.  The Vision
          ends --


  1414RESUME - INT. JOHNNY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Sarah is staring at Johnny as he holds the baby.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What?

                                        SARAH
                                (growing impatient)
                        A woman dies and you leave the
                        scene of an accident with her
                        baby.  You say you're looking for
                        the family but I'm not supposed
                        to tell any of this to my husband,
                        the Sheriff.

          Johnny looks at her, holds up the baby.  Sarah is forced
          to look into the baby's eyes as Johnny speaks.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (quietly)
                        Some things in life are bigger
                        than you can explain.

                        I have to keep this baby safe...
                        until I know that it's okay to
                        let him go.  And it's not okay
                        yet.  It's not Walt, it's the
                        system.  The system is broken.

                                        SARAH
                        But you had another vision.  Just
                        now.  Tell me you didn't.  Tell
                        me I'm wrong and I'll walk away.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I have to protect this baby.

          Sarah gets up and starts out...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Okay.  You're right, I had a
                        vision.  And it told me it might
                        be a while.  I need your help.
                        Will you help me?

          Sarah thinks of what the mother went though, instinctively
          reaches for the baby.

                                        SARAH
                                (tacit okay)
                        Someone must be hungry.

          Johnny grabs a bottle and Sarah starts to feed the baby.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mikey's a good eater, huh?

                                        SARAH
                        Mikey?

                                        JOHNNY
                        That was his name, in the vision.
                                (re: baby sucking
                                down the bottle)
                        Wow.  Look at him go.

                                        SARAH
                        Just like J.J.  Do you remember
                        when he was like a year...

          She stops, embarrassed, realizing Johnny missed that time
          because of the coma.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Did he do that thing -- the iron-

                        J.J. was more of tug than a
                          squeeze.  Oh, and before he fell
                        asleep he used to jerk violently
                        like a punk rocker.

                        You laugh.  It used to freak me
                        out.

          Johnny stands over the baby, playing with him as he lies
          in Sarah's arms.  It s a moment of emotional connection
          for them.  It's as if Sarah and Johnny are, for a moment,
          young parents again, with their own newborn, J.J.

                                        SARAH
                        It's been such a long time... you
                        forget.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What?

                                        SARAH
                        How vulnerable they are.  How
                        much they depend on you. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Never thought I'd be doing this
                          alone... I mean, in my visions,
                        I'm really bonded with this kid.

          As Sarah looks at him quizzically -- "what are you talking
          about, this isn't your kid," -- the phone rings.  Johnny
          picks it up without thinking.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hello. -- Walt.  What's up?

          He locks eyes with Sarah.

                                                                                CUT TO:

          A break in the rain, but it's still wet.  Johnny watches

                        We think the van was stolen out

                        was used to transport illegal

                        taken off.  One woman wasn't so
                        lucky.  We found her trapped inside
                        the van.  Had to use the jaws of
                        life to get her out.  We got an
                          anonymous 911 call, but by the
                        time we got here it was too late.

          FLASHES in a dark setting --


  1818EXT. ABANDONED SHIP YARD - NIGHT - VISION

          The piece of twisted metal from the VAN reassembles itself
          into the all-in-one-piece pre-accident van, its back door
          open as a crowd of illegal immigrants, including the
          mother, holding her baby, are herded like human cattle. 

          Vision Johnny watches as the illegals are pouring out of
          some sort of cramped, darkened space (into the van)-- the
          same type of space Johnny saw in the teaser vision. 


  1919RESUME - CRASH SITE

          Johnny calls over to Walt, who's looking among the rocks
          for other clues.

                                        JOHNNY
                        There were nine, maybe ten people. 
                        They were part of a larger group
                          smuggled in a rail container.

                          Anything else?

          Johnny looks at the pile of debris from the crash that
          the police have assembled, spots a Bible, the edge of a
          PHOTO sticking out of it.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Nothing.

                        Thanks for comin' out on such an
                        ugly night.

          As Walt moves off, Johnny crosses to the pile, picks up
          the Bible and slips out the photo   the mother, the baby,
          and a man whom Johnny assumes must be the father.  Johnny
          pockets the photo, and as he does he catches his own
          reflection in a piece of mirror in the dirt.  He picks it
          up and --

            Suddenly, WHOOSH!

          The Driver, Jose, is at the wheel, leaning out the window,

          perfect Spanish when necessary, and English when he wants
          to intimidate the migrants in his debt -- which is most
          of the time.

          we see is a parking lot of a seedy bar, its neon sign
            reflected in the windshield.

                        So what are we looking for, besides
                        the best bean burrito in Bangor?

          Johnny shows him the photo he found at the crash site.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm betting the baby's father was
                        here waiting for the van to show
                        up.  He might still be here
                          waiting.

          Bruce wishes they didn't have such awful news for him.

                        Oh.  Yeah.  Sure. 

          As they head into the bar, Johnny hesitates a beat, stares
          down at the photo of the family he hopes to reunite. 
          What's left of it.  He tears the photo in two, keeps the
          half with the father, and puts the other half deep into
          his pocket.


  2222INT. BAR - LATER -- MOMENTS LATER

          Latino bar, a hangout for underclass workers on the
            outskirts of Bangor.  Smokey, slightly seedy feel. 
          Ranchera music, tequila, and women who dance with men for
          money.

          Bruce is leaning over the bar, guys with their noses in
          their beers on either side, talking to the BARTENDER.

          The Bartender, busy, shows no sign of understanding.  No
          one offers to help.  Bruce turns and sees a DANCER (EVA)
          approaching Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I learned to dance in fourth grade
                        P.E.  Square dancing.

            Suddenly, over her shoulder, Johnny sees Jose, the DRIVER
          OF THE VAN, about to go through the back door of the bar. 
          He's a little busted up -- bruised by the air bag, a few
          cuts.  He turns and locks eyes with Johnny.  Jose slips
          through the back door of the bar.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thank you for the salsa.  I think
                          I better stick to the kind that
                        you dip with chips.

          He hands her a ten.

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        Keep the change.

          He catches Bruce's eye and heads for the door.


  2525EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

          Bruce and Johnny bust through the back door of the bar
          and find themselves in an alley --

          Surrounded by angry looking Mexicans: Jose and a couple
          of other THUGS, but most noticeably -- Ricky, the neatly
          dressed but sleazy COYOTE boss man.  They say nothing,
          they don't have to. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        How do you say: perhaps there has
                        been some mistake?

                                        BRUCE
                        Hola... amigos...

          In one swift move, a thug puts a steel pipe up against
          Johnny's throat, MATCH/MOVE/MORPH TO:


  2626EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT - VISION

          Same alley, same thugs, same pipe up against the throat,
          this time, of a Mexican Man, MIGUEL.  The Coyote leans
          into his face.

                                        RICKY
                        I don't want to hear it.

                        My wife, Ricky, where is my wife? 
                        My son...

          He grabs Ricky's shirt and Ricky brushes him off.

                                        RICKY
                        You're a smart boy, Miguel.  A
                        hard worker.  Listen to me.  Like
                        we told you.  An accident. 
                                (shrugs)
                        Your wife and kid are dead. 

          Jose hangs his head.  One of the thugs takes a wad of
          money from Miguel's pocket.

                                        MIGUEL

                          Miguelito... No...

          The thug punches him and Ricky grabs his shirt, looks
          into his crying face.

                                        RICKY
                        Tell anyone about this and you

  2828EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

          Pick up with Johnny gasping as the thug tightens his grip
          on the steel pipe to Johnny's throat.  Bruce is pinned
          down by three guys, punched by Jose. 

                                        JOHNNY

                        What's that, preppy boy?  I can't
                        hear you, you're late for a tennis
                        date?

                                        EVA (O.S.)
                        You cheap gringos, think you can
                        just stroll in here like you own
                        the place.  Well you don't own
                        me!

          Everyone turns to see Eva, the dancer from inside, walking
          across the parking lot, heels clicking on the pavement.

          Ricky gets out of Johnny's face, one thug lets go of Bruce,
          Jose stops hitting him.  Eva moves right past the thug
          and up to Johnny as if the man holding a pipe to his throat
          were invisible.

                                        EVA
                        I want my five bucks.  And I'm
                        not leaving until I get it.

          With barely a glance at Ricky, she shoves him aside.

                                        EVA
                        Move -- so he can get to his
                          pockets.

          Ricky laughs.  Eva kicks Bruce with one of her stilettos.

                                        EVA
                        Don't think I ain't gonna collect

          Ricky, Jose and the smirking thugs go back inside the
          bar.  Bruce stands up, weakly.  Johnny looks at Eva.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thanks.  I think.

                        That was some pretty good advice. 
                        This ain't no place for gringos,
                        white or black.

                        We'll take that under
                          consideration.

          As their hands meet, WHOOSH:


  2929EXT. DESERT - DAY

          The same little girl crossing the desert with her mother. 
          The sweltering sun beats down on them.  They are exhausted,
          weak, dehydrated.  Suddenly the mother collapses.

                        Mami...

          The little girl tries to revive her, tugs on her skirt,
          but we see in the mother s eyes that she can go no further. 
          She cups her daughter s face in her hands.

                                        MOTHER

  3030RESUME - EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

          Johnny and Bruce get in the car, pull out of the lot.

          ON EVA, watching as they drive off, grabbing a paper and
          writing down Johnny s license plate.  There's something
          else going on behind the make up and false bravado.


  3131INT. JOHNNY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

          Bruce and Johnny are driving, having just been worked

                        Why does it feel like this is the
                        longest night of my life?  If I
                        was gonna get worked over, at
                        least I thought it was going to
                        be by a beautiful Black woman.

          Johnny's trying to figure it all out.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw something back there.

                        There's something about that woman,
                        the dancer.  She's connected to
                        this somehow, but it's not clear
                        yet.  I keep seeing her as a little
                        girl.

                                        BRUCE
                        That's weird.

                        And there's something else. 
                        Another vision I had, off the guy
                        with the pipe.  There are people*
                        somewhere, migrants trapped in a
                        container.  They're going to die
                        if we don't find them.

                                        BRUCE
                        We better call Walt.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not yet.  I think that's why I
                        ended up with this baby.  I think
                        finding the father is the key to
                        this whole thing.

          On their hope that they are doing the right thing --


  3232INT.  JOHNNY'S HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER

          As Johnny comes through the front door, Sarah puts on her

                        He's off in twenty minutes.

          Johnny looks at Sarah's orange goo-covered shirt.

                        found his father?

                        But you're going to find him,

                        It was kind'a fun, actually. 
                        Like stepping into a time machine. 
                        He's a very special baby.

          Johnny looks at her, she understands his attachment to
          Mikey more than she knows.  On that wistful note, Sarah
          kisses her finger, touches it to the baby's cheek and
          leaves.  Johnny leans in to a still-fussy Mikey.

                        Did you miss me?  Did ya?

          As he picks up the baby, and heads for the train set...

          Mikey is now eight, he and Johnny are playing, the train
          set is out again, now much more elaborate.  Tracks go
          everywhere, through the kitchen, back into the living
          room from the dining room.  Clearly a house where two
          boys live, one little, one big enough to buy a lot of
          toys for both of them.

                        to bring you here from Mexico.

                                        LITTLE MIKEY
                        What did he sacrifice?

          That's a big word for a little kid.  Johnny looks at him.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Everything.  He sacrificed
                          everything.

          Out of vision, on Johnny, cradling Mikey, feeling very
          paternal and conflicted.


  3535EXT. SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - MORNING - DAY 2

          Bruce is pushing a cart full of baby supplies, sore, beat
          up, looking like hell.  He's on the cell.  His tone is
          cranky, impatient, and very domestic.

                                        BRUCE
                        I got 'em.  Yes, the ones with
                        the blue tape not the pink --
                        gimme a little credit, man, I
                        will not mess him up.  Yes, I got
                        the formula... Soy.  Yeah, well,
                        I was up all night, too...

          Bruce turns and finds himself face-to-face with a
          stunningly beautiful black WOMAN.

                                        BRUCE
                          Susanna.

                                        SUSANNA
                        You scumbag.

                                        BRUCE
                        What?  I -- I'm so sorry I missed
                        your party last night --

          She notices the stuff in his basket.

                        Never, ever call me again.

          And she's gone.  And every other woman in the parking lot
            unloading her cart is staring at him.

                                        BRUCE
                        I'm not married...

          They roll their eyes and keep pushing their carts.


  3636INT. JOHNNY S HOUSE - MORNING

          Bruce enters with armloads of groceries.  He's already on
          a rant as he comes through the door.

                                        BRUCE
                        You have to call her and tell her
                        I'm not the father.  This is crazy,
                          I finally meet a woman I might
                        want to do this whole baby thing
                        with, and Mikey here's gonna mess
                        it up for me.  How's that for
                        ironic?  This baby has got to go--

          Johnny holds up the baby, who lights up at Bruce, clearly
          recognizing him.  Bruce melts instantly...

                                        BRUCE
                        How did little man sleep?  Come
                        to Uncle Bruce and tell all.

                        which is more than I can say --

                                        BRUCE
                        Too much info, man.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How do parents do it?  It's a
                        good thing I was in a coma, because
                        taking care of a newborn would
                        have put me in one.

                                        BRUCE
                        All new parents are in a kind of
                        walking coma.  Look at their eyes
                        the next time.  Dead.  No light
                        on in the attic.

          Beat.  They stare at the baby as if he's a TV set.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Grab him a new outfit, would you? 
                        He looks dorky in this one.

          Bruce checks out their options, laid out all over the
          sofa.

                                        BRUCE
                        The blue one?  With the duckies? 
                        Or, wait -- sailboats.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah.  What about fuzzy duckies?

                                        BRUCE
                        Look at us.  We're like a gay
                        couple who just adopted.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gay?  With a house this messy?
                                (beat)
                        I'm getting visions off him.

                          Anything helpful?

                                        JOHNNY
                        They're of me and him, in the
                        future.  It's weird Bruce, I've
                        only spent a few hours with this
                        kid, yet in my visions I'm watching

                        That must be pretty cool, in a
                        way.  But Johnny.  You know what

                        Maybe we never find his father. 
                        Maybe the guy went back to Mexico
                        and just disappeared, or couldn't
                        keep him.  Or maybe worse.

          Johnny is staring at the baby.  Bruce has been changing
          him, tosses the dirty clothes, including the coat they
          found Mikey in, on the chair, then notices something as
          he picks up the coat that's fallen on the floor.

                                        BRUCE
                        Did you see this?

          Bruce finds a piece of paper tucked into the pocket.

                                        BRUCE
                        It got wet.  Ink's all smeared. 
                        Looks like a letter.

          He hands it to Johnny, who carefully unfolds it, then
          gently touches it with his fingertips...  As he touches
          it, MATCH-MOVE-MORPH TO:


  3737EXT. MIGRANT TRAILER PARK - DAY - VISION

          The letter MORPHS and reassembles itself into its original
          state, as Miguel sits outside a freshly-painted PEPTO-
          BISMOL PINK trailer, a Bible and a copy of the photo Johnny
          found, next to him as he writes to his family.  Vision
          Johnny stands behind him, reading over his shoulder.  The
          words on the page are in Spanish, but we hear them in
          English.

                        'til I see you and Miguelito again.
                        My trailer here at the camp is
                        small, but it's big enough for
                        the three of us.  And I painted
                        it your favorite color -- at least
                        it will be now.  The paint was
                        left over from my last job at the
                        Pink Lobster.  Their idea of a
                        tip.

            Johnny/Miguel looks at the trailer which sticks out like
          a sore thumb amongst the sea of broken down, rusted out
            shelters.

                        Wow.  In my vision I can understand

          Johnny's Land Rover stands out like a sore thumb amongst
          the rundown trailers of the migrant workers.  He parks it
          and walks along the narrow dirt roads.  Children play,
          old people sit in front of outdoor fires.

          People look at him suspiciously, wonder why a well-dressed
          white guy is wandering their turf...

          Johnny spots the unmistakably PINK TRAILER from his vision.  
          Goes up and knocks.  No one answers, but he hears noises

          old man and drags him out, threatening the others to stay
          away.

                        Some white guy came around the

                        I don't know anything about it,

          the curious people gathering on the fringes, peering out
          of windows.

  4343RESUME - EXT. MIGRANT TRAILER PARK - DAY

          Out of the vision, Johnny opens the trailer door.  All of
          the same people are cowering inside, terrified.  The Old
          Man looks like he was worked over pretty bad, his arm in
          a makeshift sling.

                                        OLD MAN
                        We don't know anything.  Please
                        go away.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I only want to help Miguel. 
                          Understand?  I want to help him. 
                        And you.

          But they've been scared into silence, give nothing away.
          Johnny turns, shuts the door of the trailer behind him. 
          As he starts walking back to the car, an apparently loony
          OLD WOMAN comes up behind him. 

                                        OLD WOMAN
                        I saw you on TV.  The psiquico.
                        Mi gato is missing.  Can you find
                        my little cat?  Here is his
                          collar...

          Johnny starts to wave her off, but she presses something
          wrapped in a handkerchief into his hand.  He looks down
          at what she has given him.  A Saint's medal.  She puts a
          finger to her lips, mouths "Miguel."  Before he can thank
          her, she's gone.

          Johnny pockets the medal, heads back to his car. 

          ON Eva, the dancer, sitting on the hood.

                                        EVA
                        So why is a rich white psiquico
                        looking for a Mexican?  Your
                          gardener quit?

  4444EXT. DESERT - DAY - VISION

          Eva MORPHS into a little girl, she stands over her mother s
          body in the desert, keeping the flies off her.  It s clear
          that the mother is dead, and that the little girl is close
          herself.  She s suddenly lit by a flashlight beam, as a
          large, kind-looking BORDER PATROLMAN  picks her up   and
          she MORPHS into a grown-up agent in uniform.

          Johnny freezes at the name from his vision.

                        The system is flawed, Walt.  It
                        will fail him.  That's why I
                          couldn't tell you.  I saw his
                        future and, trust me, it's not
                        bright.

          They lock eyes.  Mikey starts to cry.

                        I made a promise to a dying
                          mother...

          Johnny moves to the train set, as he picks up little Mikey,
          leans down and switches it on, MATCH/MOVE/MORPH TO:

          As the train comes around the track, one of the cars
          derails and smashes to floor as it falls off the much
          more elaborate train table set up Johnny and Mike, now
          11, have created.  Mike rushes over, picks it up.

                        Don't say damn.

          Mike glares at him defiantly.

          We see on Mike's face that the moment he said it he
            regretted it.

          Out of the vision, Johnny realizes these private visions
          of himself and the baby are beginning to fall apart, even
          in his subconscious mind.

                        But I just need a little more
                        time.  Just until I can find his
                        father.

          Eva's getting antsy -- pissed off.  She opens the
            refrigerator, then some cabinets.  Takes out a frilly,
          gold-edged gravy boat (or some similarly old ladyish piece
          of china) that belonged to Johnny's mother.

                                        EVA

          Off Eva, thinking she's in the middle of a domestic spat...

          It's the same thing he has asked of Bruce.  And Sarah. 
          Will it work with Walt, too?

                        It's more than just Miguel, Walt. 
                        There are others -- I keep getting
                          visions.

                        right now, but she's important.

          He stops, looks Walt in the eye.  The baby has been fussing
          while Johnny talked.  Johnny reaches into his pocket,
          pulls out Miguel's SAINT'S MEDAL, takes it out of the
            handkerchief and dangles it over Mikey.

          As Walt stares at Johnny, trying to decide what to do,
          the baby's tiny fingers close around the medal, it makes
          a powerful connection between Mikey, the medal and Johnny,
          sending him into --

          Vision Johnny watches as Miguel is being given the medal
          in a church (over whose altar Johnny sees the sign: "Our

          Spanish is accented with his distinctive brogue.  (Note:

          Voices in Spanish echo through the small, 19th-century
          chapel, lighted by the glow of votive candles and Santos,
          reflecting its largely Latino congregation.  Eva makes
          the sign of the cross as she enters, and she and Johnny
          move past rows of pews, and scattered groups of people
          praying.  Eva whispers to one of the parishioners who
          answers in hushed tones.  She looks at Johnny --

          Eva walks out the doors they came in.  As Johnny heads
          down the center aisle towards the altar, one of the side
          doors at the front of the church opens and Father O'Connor --
          the priest from his vision -- enters, talking to a
          distraught parishioner whom Johnny can't quite see yet.

          Johnny now sees that it's Miguel.  He moves closer, heart
          racing.  Miguel turns and makes eye contact with Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Miguel --

          Miguel looks past Johnny, to someone behind him, coming
          through the doorway of the church.  Miguel bolts.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, wait --!

          Johnny turns and sees who Miguel was spooked by: Eva,
          who's now bolting back out the front door of the church
          in order to run around the side and intercept Miguel.

          Johnny rushes to the door that Miguel escaped through. 
          As he pushes it open -- WHOOSH!


  5959EXT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - DAY - VISION

          Johnny stands in the empty alley, watches as Miguel comes
          around the outside of the church.  Eva arrives from the
          other direction as Miguel leaps up onto a fence to scale
          it. 

                                        EVA
                        Pare!  No quiero hacer te dano.

          [Means: Stop!  I don't want to do this, damnit.]  But
          Miguel keeps going.  Her hand shaking, she pulls her gun
          and SHOOTS. 

                                        VISION JOHNNY
                        Nooooo!

          NOTE: Ideally, HERE'S WHERE WE REALIZE WE'RE IN A VISION
          and this has been Vision Johnny.

          Then Vision Johnny watches himself come running up in
          time to see Eva leaning over a dead Miguel, looking
          distraught.

                                        EVA
                        He went for my gun... There was
                        nothing I could do.

          Vision Johnny can't believe what he's seen and heard... 


  6060RESUME - INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - DAY

          Johnny's hand is on the door that Miguel just ran out of. 
          Instead, he turns, takes a short cut across the church.

                        Who are you?!  What do you want
                        with Miguel?!

          But Johnny has already slid through the side door.


  6161EXT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - CONTINUOUS - DAY

          Johnny comes around the corner into the alley.  Just as
          in his vision, Miguel is scaling the fence.  Wanting to
          slow Eva down, thinking fast, Johnny rolls a dumpster
          into her path just before Eva appears so that when she
          does, she has to move around it.

          has successfully scaled.

                        Damn it!

          She jumps on the fence herself, looks over, but he's gone. 
          Before she turns around, Johnny touches the fence.          DEAD ZONE: "GRAINS OF SAND" - ACT THREE - 1/24/05 - GOLD  46.


  6262INT. SHIPPING CONTAINER - VISION

          The same recurring vision he's had before the dark space
          cramped with people, including Vision Johnny.  Someone's
          on the floor, can't see who.  A CLICK is heard, then the
          rattle of the chain lock as it bangs against the side,
          and a crack of light seeps in as it's opened.  As the
          expiring immigrants look up in hope, thinking they're
          about to be freed, instead, another handcuffed person is
          shoved inside and the container is once again slammed
          shut.  As Vision Johnny turns to see his own body fall on
          top of MIGUEL'S apparently LIFELESS form...


  6363RESUME - EXT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

          Eva and Johnny are face-to-face.  Now he knows the truth. 
          They're not on the same side.  She's out to kill Miguel. 
          And everyone in that container, too.  And as soon as she
          realizes what Johnny knows, he's dead, too.

                                        EVA
                        You screwed this up.  I should
                        have known better than to trust
                        some bleeding heart head case.

          Eva, pissed, rails at Johnny as they head to his car. 
          He's trying to think fast, figure out a way to get the
          information he needs to save those people.  And himself.

                                        EVA
                        I had him.  He was this close!

          Johnny reaches for his phone.

          Eva reaches for Johnny's phone, clicks it shut with the
          same smiling self-assurance that she showed in teaching
          him to dance.

  6565INT. JOHNNY'S CAR - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

          Johnny decides to do what he does best, even better than
          see the future.  He begins to play his cards.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I keep having this bizarre vision. 
                        At first I didn't understand what
                        I was seeing.

                                        EVA
                        What kind of vision?

                                        JOHNNY
                        People.  Lots of them.  Jammed
                        into a cramped, dark space.  

          Eva's radar's up.

                                        EVA
                        That is strange.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sheriff Bannerman told me that
                        the coyotes smuggle immigrants
                        across the country in shipping
                          containers.  I assumed the people
                        I was seeing were the ones in the
                        van.

                                        EVA
                        How do you know they weren't?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Those people got out.  The ones I
                        keep seeing are trapped.  Dying
                        from exposure, dehydration.  I
                        think they're in a second
                        container.  One the coyotes never
                        come back for.  The problem is I
                        don't know where the container
                        is.

          Johnny pulls the car over.

                        the puzzle.  But I don't have all
                        the answers.  That's why I need

                        I know more than you think.  I
                        know what you went through to get
                        your citizenship.  I know you
                        became an immigration officer to
                        help your people.  But doing your
                        job by the book meant doing things
                        you couldn't live with --breaking
                        up families, sending innocent
                        people back across the border to
                        poverty and death.  So you started
                        working the system, bending the
                        rules.  Turning a blind eye to
                        the coyotes.  But once you opened
                        that door, it was hard to close.

                        keep their end of the bargain. 
                        They're going to kill Miguel, and
                        me.  And you... eventually.  When
                        you no longer serve their purpose.

                        I saw it, Eva.  The little girl
                        trying to cross the border with
                        her mother.  A frightened little
                        girl holding on for dear life.

          Eva cocks her gun, hand shaking.

                                        EVA
                        Shut up.

                                (ignoring)
                          A little girl who sat for two
                        days and brushed the flies away
                        from her dead mother, praying
                        that someone would come.  Someone
                        would save her.

          Johnny pulls out the torn FAMILY PHOTO of Carmen, Miguel
          and the baby, holds the two pieces together.

  6969EXT. ANOTHER CORNER OF THE ABANDONED SHIPYARD - DAY -
          MOMENTS LATER

          This is where, before the trucking era, boats were unloaded
          onto train cars.  We see shipping containers, train tracks,
          old flatbed train cars, rusty old cranes.

          Johnny is marched by Eva at gunpoint along a row of old
          shipping containers.  Looks like Johnny's winning streak
          has come to an end.  Johnny looks up at the rows of
          shipping containers, then at the train cars, is reminded
          of his own toy train set.  And Mikey.

          Ricky, Jose and the thugs step out from behind one of the
          containers.

                                        RICKY
                        What is this?

                                        EVA
                        He figured it out.  He knows about
                          everything.

                                        RICKY
                        Doesn't matter now.

                                        EVA
                        I gave you what you wanted, now
                        let the others go free.

                                        RICKY
                        Yes, our agreement.  So why don't
                        you put your gun away.

          Ricky and Eva lock eyes.  She holsters her gun.

                                        EVA
                        You never told me which container
                        it is.

          Ricky nods at the one they're in front of.

          The coyotes unlock it and the the big metal door creaks
          open.  There are CRIES from within as arms reach for help.

                                        JOSE
                        Back!  Back!

          Jose brandishes a gun and the people back away into the
            darkness.  He FIRES A SHOT INTO THE AIR.  We see FACES:
          haggard, starving, dehydrated.  Older people sit on the
          floor.  Women hold small children, crying.

                                        WOMAN
                        Please, please, let us out!

          Ad lib overlapping voices repeating the plea.  ON EVA,
          nerve hit; she responds with anger so as not to scream.

                                        EVA
                        It's okay.  You're going to be
                        fine.  Stay calm.
                                (to Ricky)
                        Let them go now.

          Ricky glances at Eva, then shoves Johnny inside.  He lands
          on top of... Miguel, beaten pretty bad.  Just like in
          Johnny's vision.  Before Ricky can shut the door--

                                        EVA
                        We had a deal.

                                        RICKY
                        I don't make deals with little
                        girls.

                                        EVA
                        You're making a mistake, Ricky.

                                        RICKY
                        You made the mistake, chica.

          There's no way she could get to her gun before they would
          fire theirs.

          CLANK!  The door shuts and Johnny and Miguel are locked
          inside.  Just like in the vision.


  7070INT. SHIPPING CONTAINER

          Johnny whispers to Miguel.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Are you okay?  Is everyone all
                        right?

                                        MIGUEL
                        We are all going to die.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not if I can help it.

          Miguel's eyes widen as Johnny works the handcuff key out
          of his mouth and between his front teeth (or shoe:
          production choice).

                                        JOHNNY
                        Do you mind?

          Miguel sticks out his hand as Johnny drops the key into
          it.  Miguel unlocks his cuffs.  Eva made the right decision
          after all.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's okay.

          He turns to the frightened people.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The police are coming.

          This has the opposite effect on them than intended.  There
          are frightened cries of "policia?"  Johnny tries to shush
          them.  Johnny pulls a flare he has tucked into the
            waistband of his pants.  He aims it through a small opening
          in the top of the container.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

          As Miguel helps Johnny down, WHOOSH --


  7373INT. SHIPPING CONTAINER - DAY - VISION

          From inside the container we hear the muffled sounds of
          Walt arriving and arresting the crew.  As in Johnny's
          earlier vision, Walt swings open the container, but as
          the bright daylight hits them, people don't fall out,
          they're dazed and disoriented, but thankfully alive. 
          Miguel stumbles out, then Johnny emerges.  As his eyes
          adjust to the light, he sees:

          Ricky wrestle away from Roscoe and grab Eva.  He pulls
          her weapon with every intention of using it.  Eva's not
          going to let him: instead of backing away, she heroically
          wrestles him for the gun, and it goes off.  As she slides
          to the ground, Walt lunges for Ricky, gets his weapon,
          splays him face down in the dirt.  Johnny rushes to Eva,
          who's bleeding from the gunshot wound, starting to lose
            consciousness.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Lie still.

          She looks up at him.

          As she slips away...


  7474RESUME - EXT. ABANDONED SHIPYARD - DAY

          Out of the vision.  As Walt begins to swing open the door
          of the container, he is instead bowled over by a rocketing
          Johnny barreling out of the container at top speed.  In a
          single movement, Johnny lunges for Ricky, shouting --

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's going for Eva's gun!

          Ricky takes advantage of the distraction to push Roscoe
          aside and grab Eva's gun.  But this time before she can
          wrestle Ricky for it, she's broadsided by Johnny.  As
          Johnny rolls with Eva to the ground, a SINGLE SHOT is
          fired. 

          Reveal Walt, from where Johnny knocked him over, gun in
          hand.

          Ricky lies on the ground, screaming in agony, a hole
          through his shoulder, blood staining his beautiful shirt. 
          Roscoe picks up his fallen gun.

          Eva looks at Johnny as they stand up.  A long look.

                                        EVA
                        For a bad dancer, you've got some
                        good moves.

          As Roscoe and the cops quickly take Jose and his thugs
          into custody, slowly the migrants and Miguel emerge from
          the shipping container, looking dazed but alive.  Welcome
          to America.

          Walt crosses to Johnny.  He checks his watch.

                                        WALT
                        Your hour is up.

          Johnny suddenly notices that Walt's shirt is covered with
          orange goo.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think that counts as injured in
                        the line of duty.

                                        WALT
                        You really took a chance.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It was the only way I could find
                        the container.  By the time I saw
                        what Eva was up to, it was too
                        late to stop.

          Johnny looks over to where Eva stands, with Roscoe and
          the other cops and USCIS personnel.  She meets his eye.

                                        WALT
                        What made you think you could
                        trust her?

                                        JOHNNY
                        When I saw what she'd been through. 
                        How much she'd lost of herself on
                        that journey.  I knew she wanted
                        to do the right thing, she'd just
                        lost sight of how to do it.

          Eva disappears into a car, taken off for questioning.

                        who'd like to see him again.

          Walt looks across to where a weary Miguel stands talking
          to a few uniformed officers.

                                        JOHNNY

                        Thanks for this award.  I've always

                        model.  I'd like to dedicate this
                        prize to the guy who helped me
                        every step of the way -- my dad.

          As Johnny stands and heads up the aisle, Mike walking
          towards him, arms outstretched:

                                          15-YEAR-OLD MIKE
                        I love you, Papi.

          Johnny smiles, but to his surprise, the boy walks right
          through him into the awaiting arms of Miguel, his very
          proud, very real father.  As Vision Johnny disappears
          from the scene...


  7777RESUME  - INT.  JOHNNY'S HOUSE - DAY

          Johnny, baby in his arms, rounds the corner into the foyer,
          to see Walt, Bruce and Sarah.

                                        WALT
                        Just got off the phone with
                          immigration.  Eva will be charged
                        with obstructing justice among
                        other things, but her cooperation
                        in shutting down Penobscot's human
                          trafficking ring will be
                          acknowledged.  She didn't totally
                        fall from grace -- thanks to you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And Miguel?

                                        WALT
                        USCIS has given him special visa
                          consideration.  Reverend Purdy's
                        gonna put some Faith Heritage
                        muscle behind the problems of the
                        migrant community, and has offered
                        to help Miguel get settled as a
                        single dad.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Well, I guess I can't put this
                        off forever.

          Bruce, Sarah, and Walt -- all the babysitters -- gather
          round their charge, each share a moment of their emotional
          attachment to baby Mikey, then part... and we see Miguel
          standing there, bandaged and bruised.  Even still, his
          face lights up, eyes misting with joy at the sight of his
          child.  As Johnny walks towards him, the men lock eyes,
          two fathers finally face to face.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Your son.  Miguelito...

          As Johnny hands Miguel his son, we see, as we have before
          with Johnny, how painful doing the right thing sometimes
          is, how much it can cost him.  Yet we also see, as he
          lets go of the bond he shared with this small person,
          finally, the bittersweet fulfillment of the promise he
          made to baby Mikey's mom.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He likes trains.

          Johnny hands Miguel the caboose.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Something to remember me by...

          Johnny, feeling obsolete, steps aside, then pulls something
          from in his pocket, turns back.

                        Almost forgot...

          As he starts to hand Miguel the St. Michael medal, Miguel
          closes his hand over Johnny's -- an echo of Johnny's moment
          with the baby.

                                        MIGUEL
                        To remember us by.  St. Michael. 
                        He stops bad things in the world.

          OFF JOHNNY --


  7878INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - A FEW DAYS LATER

          Johnny and J.J. come into the house, frisbee in hand. 
          J.J.'s headed for the fridge, Johnny pulls him back, points
          him towards his beloved childhood toy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, J.J., check this out.  My
                        old train set.  Vintage Lionels. 
                          Practically mint condition.  Pretty
                        cool, huh?  What do you say we
                        connect all the track--?

          J.J. looks at him like he'd rather eat nails.

                                        J.J.
                        How 'bout we play Rallisport
                        Challenge?  It's got these awesome
                          gross-out car crash effects. 
                        That's cool.

          Johnny can't tell him that the last thing he wants to do
          is play a game about car crashes.  He's already had enough
          of those to last a lifetime.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sounds like a plan.

          As he settles in to play a video game, understanding the
          great life he's got right here, right now, with his own
          son, Johnny glances over at the train set for a beat,
          thinking of what might have been. 

          Off Johnny and J.J., battling on X-Box...

                                                                              FADE OUT.
