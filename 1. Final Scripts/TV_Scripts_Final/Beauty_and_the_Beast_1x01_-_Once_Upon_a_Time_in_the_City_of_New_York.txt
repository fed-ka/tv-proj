The sun splashes against the skyscrapers. It s one of those

dazzling early spring days...

2 EXT. GENERAL MOTORS BUILDING. NOON


  A beautiful, chicly dressed young woman slides out of a cab and
hurries across the plaza. She is CATHERINE CHANDLER, mid-
twenties, a lawyer in a high powered, New York law firm. At the
moment, she s late for work, again... but she s not worried. Her
father is the law firm s founding partner, a prominent corporate
attorney in Manhattan. Cathy Chandler has never had to worry too
much about anything...

3 INT. LAW OFFICES - RECEPTION AREA - DAY

The elevator doors open. Cathy Chandler steps out, into the
offices of Chandler and Coolige. She moves through the reception
area...

                                        CATHY
                      (to receptionist,
                        cheerfully)
              Morning...!

                        (checking clock
                        - it s 12:05 PM) Not anymore...

                                        CATHY
                        (laughs)
              Picky, picky...

As Cathy passes, the receptionist shakes her head in disbelief...

4 FOLLOW as Cathy strides down a corridor blithely 4
exchanging greetings... She pokes her head into her father s
office...

5 INT. CHARLES CHANDLER S OFFICE DAY 5

Mr. Chandler, a handsome, white-haired country-club type sits in
his huge corner office, talking on the phone. He waves his
daughter in...

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              2.

                      (hangs up, to Cathy) Hal Sherwood s coming up
              from Atlanta tonight. Can you have dinner with us?

                        (shakes her head) Tom s having a party for the
              architects of the new project. Another excuse to wine
            and dine the planning commission...

                                  MR. CHANDLER
            You can t miss that

                                        CATHY

                        (joking)
              I used to be invited to these functions.
              I should ve thought twice when I handed
            you over to our best client...

                                        CATHY
            You make it sound like a horse trade...

                                  MR. CHANDLER
                      (winking)
              More like a medieval marriage...

                                        CATHY
            You d love to see me locked up safe
            and sound in one of his tall towers.

                        (smiles)
              You ll have to admit he s quite a guy.
            You could do a lot worse than Tom
              McGrath...
                                        CATHY

            And have.

              What about dinner tomorrow night?

                                        CATHY
            Let me get to my desk, check my
              calendar...

She goes over and kisses the top of his head.

                                  MR. CHANDLER

                  You just getting in?

                                        CATHY
            Had a late night, had some errands
                                    to run...
                                      (shrugs
                        apologetically)
                                    Sue me...

                                  MR. CHANDLER
            Too late for that. I should ve sued
            you when you were five.

They both chuckle...

                                  MR. CHANDLER
                        (concerned)
              What s up with you? You re not enjoying the work? You
            don t find it stimulating...?

                                        CATHY
                        (carefully)
              Dad, when I think of corporate law,  stimulating  is not
              a word that immediately pops into mind.

                                  MR. CHANDLER
            But when you get down to work, you re
              a fine corporate lawyer.

                                        CATHY
            No, I m the daughter of a fine corporate
                                      lawyer...

Cathy smiles at her father as she heads off to her office...

7 INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A private party fills the elegant restaurant. An architectural
model of a skyscraper and commercial complex is prominently
displayed. At the center of the action, working the room, is TOM
McGRATH, a sleekly attractive man in his early 40 s - a dashing
New York real estate titan... People seem to swirl around him,
drawn by his power and charm.

FOLLOW Tom as he moves through the restaurant. He FINDS
Cathy sitting at a far table, talking to an old COLLEGE
FRIEND...

                                    COLLEGE FRIEND
                        (teary-eyed)
                    I really thought my life was over.
              I mean he was my life. He told me
            to just pretend he was dead...

                        (leaning over Cathy,
                        kissing her)
            How you doing? You all right?

                                        CATHY

              Good...
                        (putting an arm
                        around Cathy)
              I need to talk to you...

                      (to College Friend)
              Excuse us for a minute...

Tom leads her to an alcove...

                        (irritated)
              What s with you?

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                                5.

              I know her. She s a lush. She was married to a lush.
            She s a complete loser.

              It s a party . - it s not brain surgery.

                                        TOM

            And frankly, I don t like being told
            who I can talk to...

              Then use better judgement!

from within, grabbing her and violently yanking her into the

              You re gonna remember - every time
              you look in the mirror...

The Stocky Guy pulls a straight razor out of his pocket. Cathy
begins to fight with all her remaining strength...

              Grab her hands!

The Punk restrains her hands...

CATHY S POV - THE RAZOR

As it s raised over her face...

                                                                  CUT TO:
12 EXT. CENTRAL PARK . 96TH ST. DRIVE-THROUGH NIGHT

The van is stopped at the side of the road. We see the two
  attackers dump Cathy s limp form in a clump of bushes. They run
back to the van and it speeds off...                                                                                9.
13 CLOSER ANGLE CATHY

She lies unconscious, near death, sprawled in the bushes. We
can t see her face. Cars whiz by in the distance... And then,
  seemingly out of nowhere, A SHADOW FALLS ACROSS HER BODY... Now,
the BROAD BACK of a patchwork-cloaked figure ENTERS FRAME. Cathy
is scooped up, as if she were a child, and carried off, into the
mist.

14 INT. STEAM TUNNELS - BELOW MANHATTAN - NIGHT


  Carrying Cathy over his shoulder, the cloaked figure descends a
ladder into a steam tunnel, part of the elaborate network of
tunnels and caverns which run deep below Manhattan...

He carries her down a passageway to a lower level of connecting
  chambers... Steam escapes from the pipes, the walls sweat - - an
occasional bare bulb throws eerie shadows down the tunnel... A
train thunders overhead...

The cloaked figure moves quickly and surely along a narrow
ledge, and then down another ladder... His face is hidden by a
hood...

                                                                CUT TO:
15 INT. STEAM TUNNELS UNDERGROUND CHAMBERS

CAMERA PANS the room-size underground chamber - - very strange.
Its dimensions and arched ceiling give the feeling of a medieval
  knight s quarters - - and yet it is filled with carefully
  selected cast-off items, the artifacts of our disposable
  culture. The furnishings -- lamps, table, cabinets -- have been
found or ingeniously assembled from salvaged parts. One wall is
covered with a mosaic of photos cut out from magazines -- photos
of the great people of our time -- Einstein, Stravinsky, Ali,
John Lennon. One gets the feeling that this chamber is charged
with the spirit of the survivor full of undaunted goodness...

CAMERA HOLDS on Cathy, lying nestled in a bed fashioned of
mattresses and blankets. Her head and face are bandaged, her
eyes covered.

Sitting at the bedside is her cloaked rescuer. His face remains
hidden from us. His name is VINCENT...

She wakes with a start...

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              10.

His voice is the voice of pure emotion, pure heart...

              Your eyes were not hurt. We made
              sure... Rest now.

She tries to get out of bed, but sinks back, too weak...

ISA INT. VINCENT S CHAMBER

As Cathy sleeps, we GLIMPSE Vincent s FATHER, an older man in
  professorial robes, examining her, checking her pulse... All the
while, Vincent, his face still hidden, watches over her...

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

She drifts back to sleep. He draws the covers up around her and
      moves off, down an adjoining tunnel...

16 INT. STEAM TUNNELS

FOLLOW as Vincent, his face still hidden from us, hurries down a
  connecting tunnel... Moving with speed and agility, he descends
  a ladder to a lower platform, then leaps from that platform --
across what appears to be a steam-filled chasm -- to another
ladder which he climbs...

17 INT. FATHER S CHAMBER 17

Vincent enters a vault-like room, two-stories high. The walls
are lined with books, floor to ceiling -- books of every
  description -- a vast library of the city s cast-off books. The
room is lit by oil lamps. In a far corner, seated in a tattered,
  over-stuffed chair, we find Vincent s FATHER, reading a book...

  Father s face and features are long and finely chiseled, and
always in shadow -- like a face from El Greco. He has the
  appearance of a wise, sensitive man who has seen too many
  terrible things. He wears an Old Giant s baseball cap...

As Vincent comes in, Father looks extremely upset...

                                        FATHER
                          (looking up)
                Is she awake?

                                        (nods)
                She s very frightened...

                                        FATHER
                          (hands him a bottle
                          of pills)
              Make sure she takes these -- to prevent
                infection.

                                      VINCENT
                I ll make sure...

                            (reproachfully)
                I was saving them for an emergency, if something
                happened to either of us...

              would have died...

                                      (angrily)
              Do you know what they d do to you if they caught you up
              there? Or found you down here? You ve endangered all of
              us, but the risk for you is especially great. You d
              probably die! How could you bring a stranger here?? To
              where we live??

                                      VINCENT
              How could I have turned my back on
              her and left her there..?

                        (grudgingly)
                Alright... Help her regain her strength. But the moment
              she s ready to leave, you must get her out -- arid
              Vincent, don t tell her anything...

                                      VINCENT
              Don t worry -- it won t be very long.
              She s already beginning to heal...

                                        FATHER
                          (softening)
              You have the soul of a doctor...
                                      (smiles)
              When I studied medicine they didn t
              admit Negroes or Jews...
                          (chuckles softly)
                Vincent, I wonder what they would ve
              done with you. Let s not even think

We HEAR continuous METALLIC TAPPING SOUNDS in distinct rhythmic

                    We re below the city -- below the subways. There s
              a whole world of tunnels and chambers that most people
              don t even know exist. There are no maps to where we
              are -- it s a forgotten place. But it s warm and it s

She reaches out to touch his hand. Before he can pull it away,
her fingers touch his. She feels something gnarled and animal-

22 INT. VINCENT S CHAMBER 22


Cathy sits in a chair, alone. Her face is still bandaged. Now she
stands, feeling her way around the room. She bumps against a
small table, knocks over a stack of books. She feels her way back
to the chair, sits back down and begins to weep -- for all that s
happened to her.

REVERSE ANGLE VINCENT

He s standing, very still, in the doorway, watching her. We don t

know for how long. His face is still hidden.

She waits until he s well away -- and then she starts removing
the bandages...

Kipper picks up his  skate sled  -- a wooden sled with roller
skates attached. He takes a running start then jumps on and
speeds away, clattering down the tunnel...

24 INT. VINCENT S CHAMBER 24

Cathy has removed her bandages. (Her face remains hidden from
us). She rushes frantically around the room searching for a
  mirror, something to reflect her face... She can t seem to find
  anything suitable. She opens a crate of what appears to be junk,
spare parts. She finds an old auto headlight, breaks the glass
and holds the reflector up to her face...

CATHY S POV - HER FACE

In the distorted reflection, Cathy SEES the jagged slashes which
  criss-cross her face like a grotesque road map. She gasps in
shock. She stares at this tragically disfigured woman in the
  reflector suddenly realizing it s herself...

She turns..

25REVERSE ANGLE VINCENT

He stands in the doorway, his hood off, staring at us, straight-
on. We SEE what can only be described as a beast-like man, a true
grotesque, with a snout-like nose and mouth. He is powerfully
built and utterly terrifying... But, a CLOSER LOOK reveals EYES
full of compassion and embarrassment as he awkwardly tries to
cover his face. Now he comes toward her...

CATHY

She shrinks back in horror. This is beyond any nightmare. As he
approaches her, she hurls the reflector at him. It glances off
the side of his head, drawing blood. He stands there, frozen. She
sinks down on the bed, shaking in shook. When she looks up again,
he s gone. Now she collapses on the bed sobbing...

  Vincent makes no move to stop her...

Cathy stands at the end of a tunnel, on a platform which juts
out over a steam-filled abyss.

She stares into the abyss, full of self-pity, struggling to pull
  herself together. Now she looks up, as if she senses something,
she turns and looks back down the tunnel...

He stands some distance down the tunnel, watching over her. He

She now walks to where he stands...

they must  cat-walk  as steam swirls around them....

When they reach the end of the pipe, Vincent picks her up,
  cradling her in his arms, and leaps into a chasm of billowing
  steam...

They land on a platform several feet below and begin to make
their way through a series of high chambers houseing master
  pipes... Trains THUNDER overhead and, always, we HEAR the TAPPING
  SOUNDS...                                                                              24.

30 AS Vincent and Cathy move through, we GLIMPSE some of  30
the other inhabitants of the  world below  (The feeling, down
below, is of a great expanse of uncharted or forgotten space,
  allowing the inhabitants freedom and privacy)...


31 On a far platform, we SEE a FAMILY -- a mother,  31.
father and two small children, cooking a meal in an open
  hearth... Some distance away, we SEE a group sewing clothing.

32 Vincent and Cathy cross a wooden bridge over a 32
  stretch of  sealed up  subway track. We SEE a group of
kids, boys arid girls, playing on a homemade hand car...

                                                                CUT TO:

33 INT. TUNNELS 33


  Vincent, carrying Cathy, moves surefootedly along a narrow ledge
above a wall of cascading water... Still holding Cathy, he leaps
from the ledge to a ladder and effortlessly begins to climb...

                                                                CUT TO:
34 INT. TUNNELS

The tunnel narrows and becomes dark. They hurry along, crouched
over... Further down the tunnel is a faint light. As they
  approach the light we SEE the tunnel ends at an iron grillwork
vent. Vincent puts his shoulder to the grill and in an incredible
  exertion of force, moves it out of its cement casing. Light pours
in from above...

                                      VINCENT
                        (indicating)
              This is where you go out...

                                        CATHY
                        (hesitant)
              Where are we?

                                      VINCENT
              In the basement of your apartment
                                      building.

                                        CATHY
                                      (laughs)
                                      We are?

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              25.

34 CONTINUED:

Vincent nods...


A beat. A moment where both now realize they are about to go
their separate ways -- a torrent of emotions... Sadness,
gratitude, concern, even a kind of love...

                                        CATHY

                        (eyes welling)
              Vincent... *

Vincent doesn t speak. He too is choked with emotions.

                                        CATHY
              Your secret is safe with me. I d never
              betray your trust...

                                      VINCENT
              I know -- I knew that from the beginning. When you
              trusted me... Catherine, I had things to give, and they
              were meant to be given to you...

She reaches out for him, puts her arms around him and embraces
him...

                                        CATHY
              What can I say to you..?

The tenderness of her embrace is a feeling he s never felt
before, never even dreamed of. It s more than he can stand
-- it s breaking his heart...

Suddenly we HEAR FOOTSTEPS through the vent in the basement.
They both shrink back into the shadows of the tunnel...
When the FOOTSTEPS FADE OFF, Cathy turns to Vincent .. but
he s not there...

                                        CATHY
                        (calling out)
                Vincent... Vincent...!

He s gone.

We sense her sadness at losing him as she turns and climbs
  through the steam vent, back to her life...

                                                                  CUT TO:

She s on the operating table. Her face has been prepped for
  plastic surgery -- marked with lines and notations. An oxygen

CATHY S DREAM


The following sequence should incorporate the surreal tone and

  jarringly subjective elements of the dream-state...

36 INT. CHARLES CHANDLER S OFFICE - DAY 36


  Cathy comes into her father s office, her face horribly scarred,
  her dress filthy and ragged... Mr. Chandler beams happily at her
  and, throughout the scene, carries on as if all is wonderful...

                                    MR. CHANDLER
                          (buoyant)
                      Catherine! we were all guessing
              where you went. Was it Jamaica? Nassau?

                                        CATHY
                        (unable to speak)
                                    I -- I...

  Throughout the dream sequence, she is unable to speak...

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              27.

              Let s get some people together, have a party at the
              club, tonight. Who shall we invite? Make a list...

                                        CATHY
                        (struggling)
              No -- Dad -- I...

                                    MR. CHANDLER

                        (getting up)
              Have to run, I have a board meeting...
                        (handing her a wad
                                    of money)
              Buy yourself a new dress...
                        (giving her more)
              Will this be enough? Take some more.
                                      Here...

He reaches into a drawer and starts slapping down bundles of
bills.

                                    MR. CHANDLER
                        (now exiting)
              See you later...

He dashes out, leaving her sitting at his big desk all alone...

FOLLOW as she gets up and exits the office, down the corridor...

37 OMITTED37

38 EXT. THIRD AVENUE - NIGHT 38

She s rushing up Third, trying to get a taxi. A cab pulls up but
she can t open the door, it s locked. She pounds on the window
but the cab driver doesn t seem to notice. He just sits there...
  Someone taps her on the shoulder, she turns... It s the Stocky
Guy in the bomber jacket...

                                    STOCKY GUY
                        (smirking)
              Not having much luck...

Cathy tries to scream but nothing comes out... She pounds

  furiously on the cab window. The cab drives off...

                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              28.

                    Need some help?

She starts running - into the arms of the Tatooed Punk...

                                    TATOOED PUNK
              You aren t having much luck...

She breaks away and runs -- up Third Avenue. Her attackers come
after her, closing in. Nobody on the street seems to notice or
care.

39 As the Tatooed Punk reaches out to grab her from 39
behind, Cathy ducks and dashes through the doors of a
  restaurant...

40 INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 40

A party is in progress. The moment Cathy enters, everything
stops. The place is filled with beautiful people. All turn to
gape at her, at her scars, at her rags -- in icy silence.. -

In the center of the room, standing next to a towering
  architectural model is Tom McGrath. Beside him is a Beautiful
woman. They are surrounded by admirers...

AS Cathy approaches Tom, walking the length of the room, the
  SNICKERING begins... At first very softly...

She reaches Tom, but he refuses to acknowledge her presence.
He s talking to the Beautiful Woman...

                                        TOM
                        (to Beautiful Woman)
              I feel sorry for her. But what can
              I do? Life goes on...

The Beautiful Woman nods in agreement...

                                        TOM
                        (continuing)
              She was an interesting girl. I thought she had a lot of
              promise -- but she turned out to be a complete loser...
                        (to the crowd)
              And you know how I feel about losers...

The SNICKERING continues... *
                                                                  (CONTINUED)                                                                              29.

                                      Tom...!

Tom and the Beautiful Woman glance briefly at her, then move off,
smiling conspiratorially. Everyone in the restaurant is now
  SNICKERING...

The SNICKERING gets LOUDER, until it becomes a chorus of derisive
  LAUGHTER...

Cathy looks around, desperate -- trapped... Now she spots
something through a side window...

41 ANGLE - OUT THE WINDOW


  Standing outside, we SEE what appears to be the figure of a man.
He peers into the restaurant, staring at Cathy through the
glass. His eyes are filled with feeling, deep with empathy for
her. It s Vincent. As their eyes lock...
                                                                  DISSOLVE:

42INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

  heavily bandaged. The SURGEON, a handsome older man, stands
at her bedside.

CLOSE ON CATHY


Her face appears in the powder room mirror. As she combs her
hair we can SEE that her scars have been virtually removed. When
she turns her head we SEE the one scar that could not be
  repaired. It runs down the right side of her face, just in front
of her ear. With her hair down, it s almost completely hidden.
She exits the powder room...

JOHN MORENO, New York s streetwise D.A., sits in his office
conferring with a DEPUTY D.A. His desk is piled high with legal
briefs and transcripts. The atmosphere in the office is harried.
Through a glass window we can SEE the central work area of the
D.A. s office - a beehive of glass partitioned cubicles buzzing
with deputy prosecutors and clerks moving at a frantic pace. Just
outside this window we SEE Cathy Chandler waiting for her job

Vincent swiftly, gracefully, climbs the tower of a tall

the city surrounding him, the city he can never be a part of --
the city of the woman he can never know. He bows his head and
looks utterly isolated, forlorn...

              And now you must forget her.

              Every time you go above, you risk our world being taken

              Vincent, nothing I ve taught you could prepare you for
              the world  up there  -- the cruelty, the inhumanity,
              all the petty outrages...

limo and it pulls away...

As she is about to enter her building she suddenly stops, turns,
looks around -- feeling a strange but familiar presence nearby...
She shakes it off and moves on, into the building...                                                                              45.

This scene is a  free-for-all . CAMERA MOVES with Cathy and
Isaac Stubbs as they grapple with each other -- kicking and
clawing their way over the mats, careening off the walls...
Isaac wears heavy pads and headgear. His objective is to subdue
Cathy. Cathy may use all available means to stop him from doing
so. She kicks, punches, claws and uses an assortment of
  impromptu weapons to prevent Isaac from getting a death grip on
her. Isaac keeps coming at her, taunting her, pushing her to the
limit and then beyond -- to the point where it becomes pure
animal survival...

                                        ISAAC
              Alright, that s it...

She doesn t stop, she keeps tearing away at him, pumping
adrenalin.

                                        ISAAC
              That s enough!

She stops. She stands there, panting, with a startled look,
shocked that she was capable of going that far over the edge,
with such ferocity...

72 Vincent puts his shoulder to the door and shoves it 72

open. He scrambles through into a larger space strung with
cables and wires. He looks up...

  VINCENT S POV - ELEVATOR SHAFT

An elevator comes hurtling down the 20-story shaft -- stopping
four feet from Vincent s head...

  Vincent now quickly climbs a cable to a spot above the elevator
car. As the car begins to rise, Vincent leaps onto its root and
  ascends with it...

The door partially opens, still chain locked. Two frightened
eyes stare out at Cathy. Through the space in the door we can
SEE CAROL STABLER S face. She bears a strong resemblance to
Cathy. Carol, apparently, was not slashed, but one side of her
face seems dead, as if she suffered nerve damage from her
  beating.

                                        CAROL

                                      (calmly)
              Can I come in?

                                        CAROL
              No!

                                        CATHY
              Carol, you re not the only one they
              hurt...

                                        CAROL
              What are you talkin  about?

                                        CATHY
              They got you and me mixed up...

Cathy pulls back her hair, showing the scar along the side of
her face...

                                                                    (CONTINUED)74 CONTINUED: (2) 74

              ... Carol, I think this was meant for
              you.

Carol stands in the doorway, trembling, speechless...

                                        CAROL
                        (shakes her head,
                        starts to cry)
              Go away...

Carol closes the door. We can HEAR her sobbing on the other
side.

                                        CATHY
                        (talking to her,
                        through the door)

              -- call. me. My home number s on the back of the
              card...

Cathy stands there at the door, hearing the other woman weep,
  fighting back her own tears...

                                                                CUT TO:

75INT. CATHY S APARTMENT NIGHT 75

Cathy comes into the bedroom in a nightgown. On her bed is a
pile of legal briefs and case books. She slips under the covers,
picks up a trial transcript and begins to read... She HEARS a
strange sound. She looks around trying to identify it -- then,
after a few beats, returns to her reading... She HEARS the sound
again -- a CREAKING just outside her bedroom window...

She immediately turns off the light and gets a gun from the
  nightstand... Silently slipping out of bed, she edges along the
wall to the window...

  Just as she reaches the window, she spots a shadow moving
  outside on the fire escape. She throws open the window and
  takes aim...

                                        CATHY
                                      (yelling)
                                      Hold it!                                                                              49.
76 ANGLE - THE FIRE ESCAPE

Hidden in the shadows, crouched in a corner of the creaky old
fire escape, we SEE a large form and TWO BURNING EYES..

                                        CATHY
              Don t move..!

Now she finds something resting on the window sill. It s an
old book -- it s  Great Expectations. 

                                        CATHY
                Vincent...!

She rushes out on the fire escape and embraces him.

                                        CATHY
                        (weeping for joy)
              It s really you...!

                                      VINCENT
              I didn t mean to frighten you. I m sorry... -

                                        CATHY
              No, no, I m so happy to see you...

                                      VINCENT
                        (looking at her)
              Your face...
                                        (torn)
              They fixed it...

                                        CATHY
                          (awkward)
              Yes... Come in...

                                      VINCENT
                        (holding back)
              No, I have to go, now...

                                        CATHY
              No, not yet...

                                      VINCENT
                I shouldn t have come here...

                                        CATHY
                          (overwhelmed)
              I m glad you did.

                                      VINCENT
              I wanted to see you. There are things
              I wanted to tell you...

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                              50.

                                      VINCENT
              I know -- Catherine, I feel the things
              you re feeling, when you do.

                                        CATHY
                        (unsure)
              I don t know what...

                                      VINCENT
              You don t have to say anything. Just know it s true --
              and that your pain is my pain. Sometimes almost as if
              we re one...

She looks at him in wonder...

                                      VINCENT

                          (painfully)

                ...Forget me?

                                      VINCENT

              No... I ll never forget you. But I must forget the
              dream of being part of you.

              But Mayfair is run by this guy, Marty Belmont, who s a
              real bad character, scarey. He started using the
              service to shake down the businessmen. Sometimes the
              girls would carry tape recorders; sometimes Marty d
              take, you know, embarrassing pictures...

              They wanted me to set this guy up. I wouldn t go for
              it. He was a sweet guy. I wouldn t play along...
              Belmont got it into his head that I was going to spill

  dives through their legs, rolling into the hallway. --

  She scans the room for a weapon -- picks up a piece of two-by-

  steam pipe running up one corner of the room. In frustration
  and desperation she bangs on the pipe with the two-by-four...

  into the barricade with the strength of ten men...

  Cathy remains trapped in the room on the second floor, the
  attackers just outside the door. She looks around for a route
  of escape. She moves to check the window... Suddenly we SEE the
  Tatooed Punk appear on the window ledge. He kicks in the window
  and jumps into the room. Before he can reach her, Cathy picks
  up a tarp and throws it over him. She smashes him with the two-
  by-four, staggering him -- and then shoves him out the window.
  The men in the hall are now breaking the door down...

  Cathy gasps, beside herself...


  VINCENT


  rips into Cathy s attackers, tearing them to shreds, mauling
  them like rag dolls. His ferocity is something awesome and
    frightening. He doesn t stop until there s nothing left.

  When it s over, he looks up at Cathy -- it s a look of
  exquisite vulnerability, almost shame...

                                                                  CUT TO:

116 INT. TUNNELS 116



  Vincent and Cathy stand in a cavernous chamber, at the foot of

  a long ladder. Light streams in from above...


                                        CATHY
                I owe you everything -- everything...

                                      VINCENT
                You owe me nothing -- I m part of you, Catherine. Just
                as you re part of me... Wherever you go, wherever I
                am... I m with you...

  Cathy gazes at him lovingly, this beautiful, noble beast-man...

                                      VINCENT
                                      (gently)
                  Good-bye...

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                              64.

  She puts her arms around him and rests her head on his chest...

                                        CATHY
                For now...

  She then starts up the ladder... Half-way up she looks back to
  SEE...

  VINCENT

He disappears down the tunnel .. back into the darkness...

  CATHY

  She turns now, looking up, and continues her climb .~ into the
  light...
