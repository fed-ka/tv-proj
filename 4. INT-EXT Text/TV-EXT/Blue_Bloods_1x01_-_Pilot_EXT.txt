      Euphoria outside where crisp morning has become golden 
      afternoon.  Newly-minted police officers are surrounded, 
      backs are slapped, hugs and kisses abound. 

                                    PATRICK
                    How the hell are we gonna find 
                    anybody in this mess?

      Erin steps out of the crowd and waves to Michael.

                                  ERIN
                    Dad!  Over here!  

      By Erin s side, Patrick spies Nicky, plugged into her iPod, 
      impervious. 

                                    PATRICK
                    She leave the rest of that dress at 
                    home?

                                  ERIN
                    And this is an improvement.                                                                                      6.


      They now reach Brian, Linda and the boys gathered there on 
      the sidewalk with Jamie and Sydney, now dressed in a tasteful 
      business suit.  Michael rests his hand on Jamie s shoulder.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I m so proud of you, Jamie.  

                                  JAMIE
                    Thanks, Dad.  

                                  BRIAN
                    Good thing Mom s dead, it d kill 
                    her, you quitting the law and 
                    becoming a cop. 

                                  LINDA
                    Brian!

                                  BRIAN
                    Well, it s true, the golden boy was 
                    supposed to be on a fast track all 
                    the way to Washington.  Now look at 
                    him, a boot in a suit.

                                  JAMIE
                    Don t bust my chops, Brian.

                                  ERIN
                    Anyway, we still have a lawyer in 
                    the family.  Me?  

                                  BRIAN
                    And we re proud of you, Sis.  
                    Really.

      Erin gives him a playful shove.

                                  LINDA
                    We d have another one if these two 
                    would set a date.

      Meaning Jamie and Sydney, who doesn t skip a beat.  

                                  SYDNEY
                    And spoil all the fun?

                                  JAMIE
                    We ve got enough going on right now 
                    with me changing careers.

      Under which, a crusty OLD RETIRED COP comes up.                                                                                      7.


                                  OLD RETIRED COP
                    Nice speech, Mikey.  But here s the 
                    guy who could raise the rafters.  
                    Isn t that right, Pat?

      He claps Patrick on the back.

                                    PATRICK
                    Callahan, you old fart.  

                                  JACK
                    Mom, did he say  fart? 

                                  OLD RETIRED COP
                    You ll be a fine chief, Mikey, like 
                    your old man here.  Just don t let 
                    them play politics with you like 
                    they did with him.  And that bum 
                    they replaced him with.  It was a 
                    damn shame, Pat.  Everybody thinks 
                    so.

      Callahan moves off.

                                    PATRICK
                    He was a horse s ass then and he s 
                    a horse s ass now.

      Everyone laughs except Linda, who doesn t like the blue 
      language.  Under which, MARIA ROMANO, a pretty new recruit in 
      uniform, comes up to Jamie.

                                  MARIA
                    Hey, Reagan, we made it!  
                          (to Michael)
                      Congratulations, Chief Reagan. 

                                  JAMIE
                    Dad, this is Officer Romano.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    I know who she is.  First woman 
                    recruit to win the sharpshooter 
                    medal.  Well done.  

                                  MARIA
                    Thank you, sir.  Just wanted to say 
                    hello. -- You must be Sydney, 
                    right?

                                  SYDNEY
                      Congratulations.                                                                                      8.


                                  MARIA
                    Thanks.

      Sydney now on the alert: who is this anyway?  Maria smiles at 
      her, sizing her up, giving nothing.  Then, to Jamie --

                                  MARIA (CONT D)
                    See you around, Reagan. 

      Maria goes.  Jamie feels caught somehow.

                                  JAMIE
                    She won the sharpshooter medal.

                                  SYDNEY
                    Your father said.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Well, the gang s all here, we 
                    should be getting over to O Dells.

                                  SYDNEY
                    Sorry but second-year associates 
                    don t get lunch.  I m lucky they 
                    let me out for this.  It was 
                    amazing.

                                  JAMIE
                    I ll get you a cab.

                                  SYDNEY
                    Subway s quicker.  Stay with your 
                    family.  Bye everybody.   

      She gives Jamie a smooch and goes. 

                                  ERIN
                    She seems to be handling this 
                    pretty well, you being a cop.

      Under which, Brian s cell rings and he moves off to answer.

                                  LINDA
                    Can t be easy after watching you 
                    bury your brother.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Joe died doing what he loved to do, 
                    Linda.  Being a policeman.   

      Quiet settles on the family as always at the mention of Joe.  
      And the spectre of cop-death.  Now SONNY MALEVSKI, 37, comes 
      up, Brioni suit, Rolex watch.                                                                                      9.


                                  SONNY
                    Jeez, kid, in those blues, you look 
                    just like your brother Joe.

                                  JAMIE
                    Thanks, we were just talking about 
                    him.

                                  SONNY
                    Awful.  I m Sonny Malevsky.  Joe 
                    was up in the 77th with us.

      Brian returns, shutting his phone, not happy to see Sonny.

                                  BRIAN
                    Sonny, what are you doing here?

                                  SONNY
                    Hello to you too.

                                  JAMIE
                    Your nephew was in my class, right?

                                  SONNY
                    Anyway, I was just leaving. -- Be 
                    careful out there, kid.

      Sonny moves off.

                                    PATRICK
                    Quite the peacock, your friend.

                                  BRIAN
                    Friend?  I wouldn t say that.
                          (to Jamie)
                    Anyway, sorry, bro, but I ll have 
                    to buy you that beer later.  We ve 
                    got a missing kid.  

                                    MICHAEL
                      Missing... where?

                                  BRIAN
                    The Bronx.  My partner s around 
                    here somewhere. 
                          (to Linda)
                    Sorry.  I ll call you later.

      An unmarked Crown Vic pulls up, DEMARCUS KING, an African 
      American ex-jock, mid-30 s, at the wheel.  He leans over and 
      waves to everyone as Brian heads to the car.  Michael and 
      Patrick look after, maybe a little wistful, remembering their 
      days on the front lines.                                                                                       10.


                                  JACK
                    Grandpa, can I ride up front with 
                    the driver? 

                                    MICHAEL
                    You bet.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      The bodega, the panaderia, the KFC.  An already active crime 
      scene where the little girl went missing: police cars, CID 
      with gloves and crime kits, cops with notebooks, interviewing   
      onlookers, some of whom record the scene on cell phones and 
      digital devices.  MR. and MRS. CAMPOS, parents of the missing 
      child, Hispanic, 30 s, huddle together on a stoop, a female 
      officer with them.  Brian and Demarcus pull up and head in as 
      a uniformed supervisor LIEUTENANT MANNATO comes to meet them. 

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Smile for the cameras, Brian.

                                  BRIAN
                          (through a clenched smile, 
                          to Mannato)
                    So what have we got?

      As they walk into the scene, Mannato fills them in.                                                                                      11.


                                  LT. MANNATO
                      Nine-year-old girl, Teresa Campos, 
                    didn t come home from school -- St. 
                    Agnes up the block -- and the 
                    mother there got worried and went 
                    looking for her and the bodega 
                    owner told her he saw a couple 
                    young boys grab a pink backpack 
                    from the gutter here and run off 
                    with it.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    The backpack hers?

                                  BRIAN
                          (off Lt s nod)
                    We find the kids?

                                  LT. MANNATO
                    Not yet.

                                  BRIAN
                    Anybody see anything else?

      They arrive at an officer in latex gloves with a life-like 
      baby doll in diapers that he s collected for evidence.

                                  LT. MANNATO
                    This doll was found near where the 
                    backpack was.  One of those ones 
                    you press it and it talks.

      He nods to the officer, who squeezes the doll. 

                                    MECHANICAL DOLL
                    Change me!  I m wet! 

      The eerie doll voice briefly unsettles them.

                                  LT. MANNATO
                    Anyway, the mother said she d never 
                    seen it before. 

                                  BRIAN
                    Book it, put prints and serology on 
                    it.  Get an Amber Alert out right 
                    away and a canine unit here asap. 
                    Clear all the apartment dumpsters, 
                    mailboxes in the area, also the 
                    drains and sewers.  Just don t let 
                    them see what you re doing.  

      Meaning the parents.  Brian and Demarcus head for them.                                                                                    12.


                                  DEMARCUS
                    Know that feeling you had?  I m 
                    getting it too.

      They reach the parents on the stoop.  Brian nods to the 
      officer with them, who moves away.  

                                  BRIAN
                    Mr. and Mrs. Campos, I m Detective 
                    Reagan and this is Detective King.  
                    We understand your daughter didn t 
                    come home from school and we need 
                    to ask you a few questions.  

                                  MR. CAMPOS
                    She always comes home.  She comes 
                    home every day.  She knows her 
                    mother worries.

                                  MRS. CAMPOS
                          (through tears)
                    She s a good girl!

                                  DEMARCUS
                    I m sure she is.  I know how 
                    difficult this must be for you.

                    Any chance she might have run away?  
                    You had a fight?  Or maybe an ex-
                    husband may have taken her...?  

                                  MRS. CAMPOS
                    Pablo is her father!  There was no 
                    fight!  Where is she?  You have to 
                    find her!

                                  DEMARCUS
                    The more you tell us, the more we 
                    can help.  Do you have any family 
                    in the area?    

      Under which, Lt. Mannato has come up to Brian.

                                  LT. MANNATO
                      Detective?  I talk to you?  

      Demarcus stays behind as we move off with Brian and Mannato.

                                  LT. MANNATO (CONT D)
                    Woman there saw a white van pull 
                    away from the curb here really 
                    crazy.                                                                                      13.


                                  BRIAN
                    White van in New York City?  That 
                    narrows it down.

                                  LT. MANNATO
                    Yeah, I know.  She didn t get the 
                    plates either, but she said it had 
                    a cracked back window.

                                  BRIAN
                    Put an APB on the van, maybe we ll 
                    get lucky.  Because this isn t a 
                    simple custodial dispute and it 
                    sure ain t for ransom.   

      Brian returns to Demarcus and Teresa s parents, shakes his 
      head when Demarcus looks at him to see if he got a lead.  

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Reagan, we ve got another problem.   
                    The girl is diabetic.  She needs 
                    insulin every 24 hours.  And if she 
                    doesn t get it... 

      All know what he means.  Mrs. Campos grabs Brian s arm.

                                  MRS. CAMPOS
                    My baby!  Please, please help 
                    us!!!!!

      On this tableau...

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Oppressive HEAT and GLARE.  U.S. soldiers in desert fatigues 
      guard a gate, a long line of cars shimmering into the 
      distance as soldiers check under cars examine papers.

      Suddenly, a car down the line pulls out and speeds towards 
      the checkpoint.  A few soldiers signal the car to halt.  It 
      stops for a moment.  Then starts towards them again.

      Warning shots are fired into the air.  But the car continues 
      forward.  We see now that one of the soldiers is Brian, a 
      captain.  Caught now in a horrible moment of split-second 
      decision, Brian lifts his M-15 and fires repeatedly at the 
      car which now KAROOMS into a ditch.  Dust rises and starts to 
      settle as soldiers run up.

      Inside is a family, an IRAQI MOTHER and Father crying, both 
        miraculously alive.  But the mother cradles a bloody, 
      lifeless Boy, 4, clutching a teddy bear.

                                  IRAQI MOTHER
                    My boy was sick!  We were trying to 
                    get to the hospital!

      On Brian s anguish...

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    16.



      Brian and Demarcus go to the basement door and position 
      themselves on either side, hands inside their jackets on 
      their guns.  Demarcus knocks.  Then, from within --

                                  MAN S VOICE
                    Who is it?

                                  DEMARCUS
                    New York City Police.  Please open 
                    the door, sir.  

      The door opens a crack to reveal SPENCER FRYE, a sallow 30, 
      in flannel pajama bottoms.

                                  BRIAN
                    Spencer Frye? 

                                    SPENCER FRYE
                    Yeah...?

                                  BRIAN
                    Step aside please.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    19.



      Brian and Demarcus come out, Brian answering his cell.

                                  BRIAN
                    Reagan.
                          (then)
                    Huh.  Okay, good.  Put out an all 
                    points, but keep digging.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Doll number three?  The sales rep?

                                  BRIAN
                    They found a Florida driver s 
                    license so at least now we have a 
                    picture of the guy and prints. 

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Florida?  Nothing up here but his 
                    P.O. box?

                                  BRIAN
                    And we re running out of time.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Michael Reagan stands at a clutch of microphones before local 
      media gathered on the steps, among them an Hispanic TELEMUNDO 
      REPORTER, and Channel One field reporter PADMA LAHARI, 35, a 
      gorgeous Smartha Brahmin.                                                                                      21.


                                    MICHAEL
                    Okay, a brief statement before I 
                    take questions.  I want to thank 
                    the media for keeping Teresa s face 
                    before the public.  Our task force 
                    has followed up on over 500 tips 
                    and I want to I assure you that the 
                    police department will not rest 
                    until we find this little girl.

                                  UNIVISION REPORTER
                    Chief Reagan, what do you say to  
                    blog allegations there s a third 
                    fewer police than on the Allie 
                      Dintenfass Amber Alert on the Upper 
                    East Side last summer?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Miguel, you re a professional 
                    reporter and you wanna give 
                    credence to any amateur blogger 
                    with a laptop and an axe to grind?  

                                  PADMA LAHARI
                    Then what s your response to polls 
                    that show a boroughs-wide lack of 
                    faith in police by the Latino 
                    community and a slow and steady 
                    rise in crime there?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Since I ve been on the job, those 
                    stats are down across the board.

                                  PADMA LAHARI
                    Then you re saying that the mayor s 
                    budgetary cutbacks aren t affecting 
                    the department s ability to keep 
                    all citizens of this city safe?

                                    MICHAEL
                    All due respect, Miss Lahari, none 
                    of us is worried about cost today.    
                      A 9-year-old girl is missing, the 
                    clock is ticking and it s all about 
                    the recovery of Teresa.  Just make 
                    sure you media people do your part 
                    and keep her face in front of the 
                    public before you run off chasing 
                    Tiger Woods  latest girlfriend.

      On Padma, glaring at Michael...

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    22.



      Working-class.  Prefab houses, trim lawns, not a human in 
      sight.  Demarcus and Brian park, head for a corner house.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    I m not seeing a white van.

      They pass by the garage, Demarcus looks in.  Looks back to 
      Brian and shakes his head, signals he ll cover the back of 
      the house from there.  Brian nods, proceeds to the door, hand 
      inside his jacket on his gun.  From a position beside the 
      door, he reaches out and rings the bell.  

                                    WOMAN S VOICE 
                    Who is it?

                                  BRIAN
                    New York Police.

      The door opens a crack.  ROBERTA BANSE peers out, late-40 s, 
      a nervous woman in a housecoat and crucifix.

                                  MRS. BANSE
                    Can I help you?

      Brian shows his badge.

                                  BRIAN
                    We re looking for Ronald Banse.  
                    He s a sale rep for Happy Valley 
                    Toys?

                                  MRS. BANSE
                    Yes, but he s not here.

                                  BRIAN
                    Where is he then?

                                  MRS. BANSE
                    I don t know.

                                  BRIAN
                    You re his wife, aren t you?

                                  MRS. BANSE
                    We re separated and I m divorcing 
                    the bastard and I haven t seen him 
                    in months.  What is this about?                                                                                    26.


      Demarcus comes up, intercedes more gently.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Excuse me, Ma am, would you mind if 
                    we came in and took a look around?  
                    It s just procedure.  

                                  MRS. BANSE
                    Has he done something wrong?  What 
                    do you want him for?

      They brush by her and go inside.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Moving fast, Brian and Demarcus pass a no-man s land of gas 
      stations and light industry.  

                                  BRIAN
                    So what have we got?  A couple 
                    hours?

                                  DEMARCUS
                    If that.  Teresa s type one 
                    diabetes.  Insulin shock.  My aunt 
                    died of it.

                                  BRIAN
                    Up there on the right.


      Flashing  vacancy,  half the neon gone.  The likeness of Abe 
      too has seen better days.  Demarcus and Brian whip into the 
      lot, are out of their car, scoping the scene. 

                                  DEMARCUS
                    No white van.

                                  BRIAN
                    Blue van.

      They trot up to it.  Brian takes his key and scrapes the 
      paint: fresh, white beneath.  Demarcus tries the doors, 
      locked, on his way to check the back window.

                                  BRIAN (CONT D)
                    Lousy paint job.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    And the window s new.

                                  BRIAN
                    Not for long.

      Brian takes the butt of his gun and smashes the window, glass 
      confetti flying.  Demarcus watches for anyone running as 
      Brian reaches in, unlocks the door and throws it open.

      But no Teresa.  Instead, a clean and empty hollow -- except 
      for a few pink and white striped shopping bags.

                                  BRIAN (CONT D)
                    Dammit.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    What s this?                                                                                    28.


      He means the shopping bags.  They exchange a look, then go 
      ahead and rip into the bags.  Inside a box tied with ribbon, 
      Demarcus finds a frilly little white dress.  

                                  DEMARCUS (CONT D)
                      A communion dress?  

      Brian opens a small box.

                                  BRIAN
                    Votive candles.
                          (then)
                    The good news is, he hasn t lit  em 
                    yet.

      They look to the motel, shut the van s door and head to the 
      motel office.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


      A wide shot as we see the Motel Manager with Brian and 
      Demarcus.  He s pointing to a unit on the second level.  
      Brian and Demarcus make for it.

      They run up the stairs and position themselves at either side 
      of the door, hands on their holstered weapons.  Brian knocks.  
      After a tense beat.

                                  MAN (O.S.)
                    Who is it?

                                  BRIAN
                    Police!  Open up!

      The door opens and there stands RONALD BANSE, 50, nothing 
      special, thinning hair, thick glasses.  He smiles pleasantly.

                                  RONALD BANSE
                    Yes?

                                  BRIAN
                    Where s the girl?

                                  RONALD BANSE
                    I don t know what you re talking 
                    about. 

                                  BRIAN
                    Then you don t mind if we come in.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    29.



      The Crown Vic screeches up.  As Demarcus and Brian get out 
      and sprint to one of the storage containers, we HEAR SIRENS 
      nearing.  Demarcus unlocks a container, Brian runs into --                                                                                      32.


      THE CONTAINER

      In the dark he can make out the little girl in the corner, 
      bound and gagged, a shadow to us. 

                                  BRIAN
                    It s okay, Teresa.  You re safe 
                    now.

      OUTSIDE 

      Police cruiser, cops.  Also an ambulance with EMT s and a 
      physician.  Brian emerges with Teresa in his arms, her gag  
      pulled down, her arms around his neck.

                                  TERESA
                    Where s my mama?

                                  BRIAN
                    You re gonna see her real soon.    
                    These are doctors, they re going to 
                    take you to the hospital and your 
                    mama and papa will be there.   
                          (handing her to doctor)
                    She needs insulin immediately.

      Doctor knows, nods, and they take her to the ambulance.  
      Brian and Demarcus watch her go.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    We won one.

                                  BRIAN
                    She was the easy part.  

      He means Banse, whom they hear yelling as they move towards 
      the car.

                                  BANSE
                    Police brutality!  Torture! 

      On Brian, knowing he s in a world of trouble...

                                                                            FADE OUT

                                      ACT THREE

      FADE IN:


      Sydney has an unlit cigarette, a lighter.  Jamie comes out.

                                  JAMIE
                    I m sorry.

                                  SYDNEY
                    Why d you do that?                                                                                      41.


                                  JAMIE
                    I don t know.

                                  SYDNEY
                    Am I being tested?  Is that it?  
                    Because you know I m having trouble 
                    with this whole thing. 

                                  JAMIE
                    It s just, that s my reality now.

                                  SYDNEY
                    My mother calls it your little bait 
                    and switch.  I fall in love with a 
                    Harvard lawyer and he turns out to 
                    be a cop on a beat.

      She crushes the cig in her hand, throws it in the receptacle.

                                  JAMIE
                    I know your folks aren t happy 
                    about it and I m sorry they re 
                    giving you a bad time.  But I can t 
                    be a lawyer just because it s more 
                      comfortable for them.  Or you.  
                    This is something I have to do.

                                  SYDNEY
                    Because Joe got killed?

                                  JAMIE
                    You know that s a big part of it.  
                    But truthfully?  I think I always 
                    wanted to be a cop.  Harvard Law 
                    was my family s idea, my mother s 
                    really.

                                  SYDNEY
                    You could be a great lawyer.

                                  JAMIE
                    And I d be miserable.  And I d make 
                    you miserable.  Trust me.  Just 
                    give it some time.  I promise I ll  
                    keep the war stories to a minimum, 
                    okay?

      The air warms between them.  

                                  SYDNEY
                    I ll try harder too.  I know it s 
                    important work.  My folks will come 
                    around.                                                                                    42.


                                  JAMIE
                    We re going to be okay.

      They kiss deeply.  Gaze at each other.

                                  SYDNEY
                    Mm.

                                  JAMIE
                    Not exactly make-up sex, but it s a 
                    start.

                                  SYDNEY
                    We better get back in.

      They head inside, but Jamie sees something down the street 
      that stops him.

                                  JAMIE
                    I ll be right there. 

      Sydney gives a quizzical look, but goes inside.  Jamie 
      watches a man help a woman into an SUV.  It s Jamie s father, 
      Michael, and the woman is the newscaster, Padma Lahari.  From 
      their body language, it s clear there s a lot between them.  
      Surprised, Jamie smiles to himself, then goes inside.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Solid, middle-class Brooklyn.  Nice big, old-fashioned brick 
      houses with porches, more than a few American flags.  CHURCH 
      BELLS peel, a few people stroll in their Sunday best.


      Demarcus and Brian are at the door with Mrs. Banse.  Her hand 
      is over her crucifix.

                                  MRS. BANSE
                    My necklace?                                                                                    55.


                                  BRIAN
                    It belonged to a little girl in 
                    Florida who was one of his victims.

                                  MRS. BANSE
                    It can t be.  Ronnie wasn t much of 
                      a husband, but he wasn t a monster. 

                                  BRIAN
                    We don t even know yet how many 
                    other children he took.

                                  MRS. BANSE
                    Dear Jesus.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Mrs. Banse, I m afraid we need to 
                    take a closer look at the necklace.  
                    The girl s parents said her name, 
                    Kathy, was engraved on the back.

                                  MRS. BANSE
                    My husband said that was because 
                    it s an antique.

                                  BRIAN
                    We need the necklace as evidence.  
                    Remove it please.

      She can t get it off her neck fast enough.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Deserted except for the occasional dog-walker and miscreant.  
      We find Jamie headed to the subway.  He and we become aware 
      that a car is following him.  He speeds up, so does the car.  
      Finally, the unmarked Crown Vic pulls up to the curb beside 
      him, its passenger-side window powering down. 

                                    A VOICE
                    Reagan!

      This stops Jamie.  He sees now that the man in the car is 
      holding up a badge.  We ll learn he s FEDERAL AGENT ANDERSON.

                                  AGENT ANDERSON
                    Jamison Reagan?  

      Jamie approaches warily.  Checks out the I.D.

                                  JAMIE
                    What s going on?

                                  AGENT ANDERSON
                    Get in.

      Anderson nods towards the back seat.  

                                                                            CUT TO:


      The Verranzano Bridge in the distance, Michael fishes at the 
      rail, sipping coffee from thermos.  Jamie trots up.   

                                  JAMIE
                    Sorry, train was stalled. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    It s okay, the coffee s still hot.

                                  JAMIE
                    Any luck?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Damn fish must still be sleeping.  
                    Maybe they re changing shifts.

      Jamie smiles wanly, pouring coffee, grabbing his fishing rod.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    Still a beautiful spot, isn t it?

                                  JAMIE
                    We ve caught a lot of fish here.

                                    JAMIE/MICHAEL
                          (in unison, an old joke)
                    Just not today.

      They laugh, Jamie heavy-hearted.  Now Michael clears his 
      throat.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Y know, you were asking me the 
                    other day if I was seeing anybody 
                    and I was not forthcoming.

                                  JAMIE
                    Oh.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Because there is somebody.  She s 
                    an Indian girl.  From India, I 
                    mean.  Lovely person, very smart.  
                    She s a TV reporter.

                                  JAMIE
                    That s great.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    What a relief.  I hate keeping 
                    secrets.                                                                                    61.


                                  JAMIE
                    Yeah...

      Jamie s mood is not lost on Michael.

                                    MICHAEL
                    What s going on, Jamie?  You 
                    seem... I don t know, not yourself 
                    today.  Everything okay?  You re 
                    not having second thoughts about 
                    coming on the job...?

                                  JAMIE
                    No, I m fine.
                          (to deflect)
                    That T.O. of mine s a piece of 
                    work.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Renzulli, right?

                                  JAMIE
                    What, you keeping tabs on me?

                                    MICHAEL
                    I got a vested interest.

      On Jamie, the weight on him, and the cost in not being able 
      to tell his father everything.  Knowing too that his life has 
      taken an abrupt turn...

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.
