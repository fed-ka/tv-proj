Vincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically
dragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of what
looks like a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building.
We TRACK alongside.
VINCENT
What's her name?
JULES
Mia.
VINCENT
How did Marsellus and her meet?
JULES
I dunno, however people meet people.
She usta be an actress.
VINCENT
She ever do anything I woulda saw?
JULES
I think her biggest deal was she
starred in a pilot.
VINCENT
What's a pilot?
JULES
Well, you know the shows on TV?
VINCENT
I don't watch TV.
JULES
Yes, but you're aware that there's
an invention called television, and
on that invention they show shows?
VINCENT
Yeah.
JULES
Well, the way they pick the shows on
TV is they make one show, and that
show's called a pilot. And they show
that one show to the people who pick
the shows, and on the strength of
that one show, they decide if they
want to make more shows. Some get
accepted and become TV programs, and
some don't, and become nothing. She
starred in one of the ones that became
nothing.
They enter the apartment building.
Sally LeRoy's is a large topless bar by LAX that Marsellus
owns.
Vincent's classic Malibu WHIPS into the near empty parking
lot and parks next to a white Honda Civic.
Vince knocks on the door. The front entrance is unlocked,
revealing the Dapper Dan fellow on the inside: ENGLISH DAVE.
Dave isn't really English, he's a young black man from Baldwin
Park, who has run a few clubs for Marsellus, including Sally
LeRoy's.
ENGLISH DAVE
Vincent Vega, our man in Amsterdam,
git your ass on in here.
Vincent, carrying the black briefcase from the scene between
Vincent and Jules, steps inside. English Dave SLAMS the door
in our faces.
Vincent walks toward the house and pulls a note off the door
CLOSEUP  NOTE
The Note reads:
"Hi Vincent, I'm getting dressed. The door's open. Come inside
and make yourself a drink.
Mia"
MIA (V.O.)
Hi, Vincent. I'm getting dressed.
The door's open. Come inside and
make yourself a drink.
FADE TO WHITE
Music in.
FADE TO:
In the past six years, 50's diners have sprung up all over
L.A., giving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They're
all basically the same. Decor out of an "Archie" comic book,
Golden Oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer,
saucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the
Fats Domino Cheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelet, and
over prices that pay for all this bullshit.
But then there's JACKRABBIT SLIM'S, the big mama of 50's
diners.
Either the best or the worst, depending on your point of
view.
Vincent's Malibu pulls up to the restaurant. A big sign with
a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a
red windbreaker towers over the establishment. Underneath
the cartoon is the name: JACKRABBIT SLIM'S. Underneath that
is the slogan: "Next best thing to a time machine."
VINCENT
What the fuck is this place?
MIA
This is Jackrabbit Slim's. An Elvis
man should love it.
VINCENT
Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak.
MIA
You can get a steak here, daddy-o.
Don't be a...
Mia draws a square with her hands. Dotted lines appear on
the screen, forming a sqaure. The lines disperse.
VINCENT
After you, kitty-cat.
INSERT SPEEDOMETER: red needle on a hundred.
Vincent driving like a madman in a town without traffic laws,
speeds the car into turns and up and over hills.
Vincent is already out of the car, working on getting Mia
out.
LANCE
Have you lost your mind?! You crashed
your car in my fuckin' house! You
talk about drug shit on a cellular
fuckin' phone 
VINCENT
If you're through havin' your little
hissy fit, this chick is dyin', get
your needle and git it now!
LANCE
Are you deaf? You're not bringin'
that fucked up bitch in my house!
VINCENT
This fucked up bitch is Marsellus
Wallace's wife. Now if she fuckin'
croaks on me, I'm a grease spot. But
before he turns me into a bar soap,
I'm gonna be forced to tell 'im about
how you coulda saved her life, but
instead you let her die on your front
lawn.
The Malibu pulls up to the front. Mia gets out without saying
a word (still in a daze) and begins walking down the walkway
toward her front door.
VINCENT (O.S.)
Mia!
She turns around.
Vincent's out of the car, standing on the walkway, a big
distance between the two.
VINCENT
What are your thoughts on how to
handle this?
MIA
What's yours?
VINCENT
Well I'm of the opinion that Marsellus
can live his whole live and never
ever hear of this incident.
Mia smiles.
MIA
Don't worry about it. If Marsellus
ever heard of this, I'd be in as
much trouble as you.
VINCENT
I seriously doubt that.
MIA
If you can keep a secret, so can I.
VINCENT
Let's shake on it.
The two walk toward each other, holding out their hands to
shake and shake they do.
VINCENT
Mum's the word.
Mia lets go of Vincent's hand and silently makes the see-no-
evil, hear-no-evil, and speak-no-evil sign with her hands.
Vincent smiles.
VINCENT
If you'll excuse me, I gotta go home
and have a heart attack.
Mia giggles.
Vincent turns to leave.
MIA
You still wanna hear my "FOX FORCE
FIVE" joke?
Vincent turns around.
VINCENT
Sure, but I think I'm still a little
too petrified to laugh.
MIA
Uh-huh. You won't laugh because it's
not funny. But if you still wanna
hear it, I'll tell it.
VINCENT
I can't wait.
MIA
Three tomatoes are walking down the
street, a poppa tomato, a momma
tomato, and a little baby tomato.
The baby tomato is lagging behind
the poppa and momma tomato. The poppa
tomato gets mad, goes over to the
momma tomato and stamps on him 
(stamps on the ground)
 and says: catch up.
They both smile, but neither laugh.
MIA
See ya 'round, Vince.
Mia turns and walks inside her house.
CLOSEUP  VINCENT
After Mia walks inside. Vincent continues to look at where
she was. He brings his hands to his lips and blows her a
kiss. Then exits FRAME leaving it empty. WE HEAR his Malibu
START UP and DRIVE AWAY.
FADE TO BLACK
FADE UP On the cartoon "SPEED RACER."
Speed is giving a
detailed description of all the features on his race car
"The Mac-5," which he does at the beginning of every episode.
OFF SCREEN we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE... .
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Butch.
DISSOLVE TO:
BUTCH'S POV
We're in the living room of a modest two bedroom house in
Alhambra, California, in the year 1972. BUTCH'S MOTHER, 35ish,
stands in the doorway leading into the living room. Next to
her is a man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force
officer. The CAMERA is the perspective of a five-year old
boy.
MOTHER
Butch, stop watching TV a second. We
got a special visitor. Now do you
remember when I told you your daddy
dies in a P.O.W. camp?
BUTCH (O.S.)
Uh-huh.
MOTHER
Well this here is Capt. Koons. He
was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.
CAPT. KOONS steps inside the room toward the little boy and
bends down on one knee to bring him even with the boy's
eyeline. When Koons speaks, he speaks with a slight Texas
accent.
CAPT. KOONS
Hello, little man. Boy I sure heard
a bunch about you. See, I was a good
friend of your Daddy's. We were in
that Hanoi pit of hell over five
years together.
Hopefully, you'll
never have to experience this
yourself, but when two men are in a
situation like me and your Daddy
were, for as long as we were, you
take on certain responsibilities of
the other. If it had been me who had
not made it, Major Coolidge would be
talkin' right now to my son Jim. But
the way it worked out is I'm talkin'
to you, Butch. I got somethin' for
ya.
The Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket.
CAPT. KOONS
This watch I got here was first
purchased by your great-granddaddy.
It was bought during the First World
War in a little general store in
Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought
by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge
the day he set sail for Paris. It
was your great-granddaddy's war watch,
made by the first company to ever
make wrist watches. You see, up until
then, people just carried pocket
watches. Your great-granddaddy wore
that watch every day he was in the
war. Then when he had done his duty,
he went home to your great-
grandmother, took the watch off his
wrist and put it in an ol' coffee
can. And in that can it stayed 'til
your grandfather Dane Coolidge was
called upon by his country to go
overseas and fight the Germans once
again. This time they called it World
War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave
it to your granddad for good luck.
Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as
good as his old man's. Your granddad
was a Marine and he was killed with
all the other Marines at the battle
of Wake Island. Your granddad was
facing death and he knew it. None of
those boys had any illusions about
ever leavin' that island alive. So
three days before the Japanese took
the island, your 22-year old
grandfather asked a gunner on an Air
Force transport named Winocki, a man
he had never met before in his life,
to deliver to his infant son, who he
had never seen in the flesh, his
gold watch. Three days later, your
grandfather was dead. But Winocki
kept his word. After the war was
over, he paid a visit to your
grandmother, delivering to your infant
father, his Dad's gold watch. This
watch. This watch was on your Daddy's
wrist when he was shot down over
Hanoi. He was captured and put in a
Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew
if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd
be confiscated. The way your Daddy
looked at it, that watch was your
birthright. And he'd be damned if
and slopeheads were gonna put their
greasy yella hands on his boy's
birthright. So he hid it in the one
place he knew he could hide somethin'.
His ass. Five long years, he wore
this watch up his ass. Then when he
died of dysentery, he gave me the
watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk
of metal up my ass for two years.
Then, after seven years, I was sent
home to my family. And now, little
man, I give the watch to you.
Capt. Koons hands the watch to Butch. A little hand comes
into FRAME to accept it.
CUT TO:
A taxi is parked in a dark alley next to an auditorium. The
sky is PISSIN' DOWN RAIN. WE SLOWLY DOLLY toward the parked
car. The SOUND of the CAR RADIO can be heard coming from
inside.
SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)
...Coolidge was out of there faster
than I've ever seen a victorious
boxer vacate the ring. Do you think
he knew Willis was dead?
SPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.)
My guess would be yes, Richard. I
could see from my position here, the
frenzy in his eyes give way to the
realization of what he was doing. I
think any man would've left the ring
that fast.
DISSOLVE TO:
A window about three stories high opens on the auditorium-
side of the alley. A gym bag is tossed out into a garbage
dumpster below the window. Then, Butch Coolidge, still dressed
in boxing trunks, shoes, gloves and yellow robe, LEAPS to
the dumpster below.
ESMARELDA'S REACTION takes in the strangeness of this sight.
Gym bag in hand, Butch CLIMBS out of the dumpster and RUNS
to the taxi. Before he climbs in, he takes off his robe and
throws it to the ground.
The cab WHIPS out of the alley, FISH-TAILING on the wet
pavement in front of the auditorium at a rapid pace.
We DOLLY around a phone booth as Butch talks inside.
BUTCH
(into phone)
What'd I tell ya, soon as the word
got out a fix was in, the odds would
be outta control. Hey, if he was a
better fighter he's be alive. If he
never laced up his gloves in the
first place, which he never shoulda
done, he'd be alive. Enough about
the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let's
talk about the rich and prosperous
Mr. Butch.
How many bookies you
spread it around with?
(PAUSE)
Eight? How long to collect?
(pause)
So by tomorrow evening, you'll have
it all?
(pause)
Good news Scotty, real good news  I
understand a few stragglers aside.
Me an'
Fabienne're gonna leave in
the morning. It should take us a
couple days to get into Knoxville.
Next time we see each other, it'll
be on Tennessee time.
Butch hangs up the phone. He looks at the cab waiting to
take him wherever he wants to go.
BUTCH
(to himself in French
with English subtitles)
Fabienne my love, our adventure
begins.
CUT TO:
Esmeralda's taxi pulled into the motel parking lot. The rain
has stopped, but the night is still soaked. Butch gets out,
now fully dressed in tee-shirt, jeans and high school athletic
jacket. He leans in the driver's side window.
ESMARELDA
Forty-five sixty.
Handing her the money.
BUTCH
Merci beaucoup. And here's a little
something for the effort.
Butch holds up a hundred dollar bill.
Esmarelda's eyes light up. She goes to take it. Butch holds
it out of reach.
BUTCH
Now if anybody should ask you about
who your fare was tonight, what're
you gonna tell 'em?
ESMARELDA
The truth. Three well-dressed,
slightly toasted, Mexicans.
He gives her the bill.
BUTCH
Bon soir, Esmarelda.
ESMARELDA
(in Spanish)
Sleep well, Butch.
He tweaks her nose, she smiles, and he turns and walks away.
She drives off.
The little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is
little engine will take it.
CUT TO:
A parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the
arrow pointing at one hour.
Butch isn't completely reckless. He has parked his car a
couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before
he goes boppin' through the front door.
Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street,
then he discreetly glances out.
Everything seems normal. More or less the right number of
cars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of
place. None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside.
Basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of
Butch's home.
Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information.
Butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He
crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard.
Across the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a
combination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign
sticks up in the air, with the name "Teriyaki Donut" and a
graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice.
Butch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment
building. Once again, everything appears normal  the laundry
room, the pool, his apartment door  nothing appears
disturbed.
Butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12.
He steps outside the door and listens inside. Nothing.
Butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening
it.
Butch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the
courtyard...
...comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street...
...goes through the alley...
...and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT.
Butch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide
smile of a survivor breaks across his face.
The Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his
apartment building.
Butch, still shaking in his boots, exits the pawnshop. He
looks ahead and sees, parked in front of the establishment,
Zed's Big Chrome Chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has
the name "GRACE" on it. He climbs aboard, takes out the keys
with the big Z on them and starts up the huge hog. It RUMBLES
to life, making sounds like a rocket fighting for orbit.
Butch twists the accelerator handle and SPEEDS off.
WE CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN...
Butch drives down the street, humping a hot hog named "GRACE."
He checks his father's watch. It says: 10:30.
The SONG in the motel room PLAYS OVER this.
Butch rides up on Grace. He hops off and runs inside the
motel room, while we stay outside with the bike.
FABIENNE (O.S.)
Butch, I was so worried!
BUTCH
Honey, grab your radio and your purse
and let's go!
FABIENNE (O.S.)
But what about all our bags?
BUTCH
Fuck the bags. We'll miss our train
if we don't split now.
FABIENNE (O.S.)
Is everything well? Are we in danger?
BUTCH
We're cool. In fact, we're super-
cool. But we gots to go. I'll wait
for you outside.
Butch runs out and hops back on the bike. Fabienne exits the
motel room with the boom box and a large purse. When she
sees Butch on the chopper, she stops dead.
FABIENNE
Where did you get this motorcycle?
BUTCH
(he kick-starts it)
It's a chopper, baby, hop on.
Fabienne slowly approaches the two-wheel demon.
FABIENNE
What happened to my Honda?
BUTCH
Sorry baby, I crashed the Honda.
FABIENNE
You're hurt?
BUTCH
I might've broke my nose, no biggie.
Hop on.
She doesn't move.
Butch looks at her.
BUTCH
Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!
Fabienne starts to cry.
Butch realizes that this is not the way to get her on the
bike. He turns off the engine and reaches out, taking her
hand.
BUTCH
I'm sorry, baby-love.
FABIENNE
(crying)
You were gone so long, I started to
think dreadful thoughts.
BUTCH
I'm sorry I worried you, sweetie.
Everything's fine. Hey, how was
breakfast?
FABIENNE
(waterworks drying a
little)
It was good 
BUTCH
 did you get the blueberry pancakes?
FABIENNE
No, they didn't have blueberry
pancakes, I had to get buttermilk 
are you sure you're okay?
BUTCH
Baby-love, from the moment I left
you, this has been without a doubt
the single weirdest day of my entire
life. Climb on an' I'll tell ya about
it.
Fabienne does climb on. Butch STARTS her up.
FABIENNE
Butch, whose motorcycle is this?
BUTCH
It's a chopper.
FABIENNE
Whose chopper is this?
BUTCH
Zed's.
FABIENNE
Who's Zed?
BUTCH
Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead.
And with that, the two lovebirds PEEL AWAY on Grace, as the
SONG on the BOOM BOX RISES.
FADE TO BLACK
TITLE CARD:
"JULES VINCENT JIMMIE & THE WOLF"
TITLE DISAPPEARS.
Over black, we can HEAR in the distance, men talking.
JULES (O.S.)
You ever read the Bible, Brett?
BRETT (O.S.)
Yes!
JULES (O.S.)
There's a passage I got memorized,
seems appropriate for this situation:
Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the
righteous man is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men..."
FADE UP:
The Chevy Nova PROPELS itself into traffic.
A silver Porsche WHIPS the corner leading to Jimmie's home,
in HYPER DRIVE. Easily doing 135 mph, the Porsche stops on a
dime in front of Jimmie's house.
A ringed finger touches the doorbell: DING DONG.
Jules and Vincent stand side by side in their black suits,
covered in blood, in Jimmie's backyard. Jimmie holds a plastic
Hefty trash bag, while The Wolf holds a garden hose with one
of those guns nozzles attached.
THE WOLF
Strip.
VINCENT
All the way?
THE WOLF
To your bare ass.
As they follow directions, The Wolf enjoys a smoke.
THE WOLF
Quickly gentlemen, we got about
fifteen minutes before Jimmie's better-
half comes pulling into the driveway.
JULES
This morning air is some chilly shit.
VINCENT
Are you sure this is absolutely
necessary?
THE WOLF
You know what you two look like?
VINCENT
What?
THE WOLF
Like a couple of guys who just blew
off somebody's head. Yes, strippin'
off those bloody rags is absolutely
necessary. Toss the clothes in Jim's
garbage bag.
JULES
Now Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupid
like puttin' that out in front of
your house for Elmo the garbage man
to take away.
THE WOLF
Don't worry, we're takin' it with
us. Jim, the soap.
He hands the now-naked men a bar of soap.
THE WOLF
Okay gentlemen, you're both been to
County before, I'm sure. Here it
comes.
He hits the trigger, water SHOOTS OUT, SMACKING both men.
JULES
Goddamn, that water's fuckin' cold!
THE WOLF
Better you than me, gentlemen.
The two men, trembling, scrub themselves.
THE WOLF
Don't be afraid of the soap, spread
it around.
The Wolf stops the hose, tossing it on the ground.
THE WOLF
Towel 'em.
Jimmie tosses them each a towel, which they rub furiously
across their bodies.
THE WOLF
You're dry enough, give 'em their
clothes.
FADE UP ON:
JULES AND VINCENT In their tee-shirts and swim trunks. They
look a million miles away from the black-suited, bad-asses
we first met.
THE WOLF
Perfect. Perfect. We couldn't've
planned this better. You guys look
like... what do they look like,
Jimmie?
JIMMIE
Dorks. They look like a couple of
dorks.
The Wolf and Jimmie laugh.
JULES
Ha ha ha. They're your clothes,
motherfucker.
JIMMIE
I guess you just gotta know how to
wear them.
JULES
Yeah, well, our asses ain't the expert
on wearin' dorky shit that your is.
THE WOLF
C'mon, gentlemen, we're laughin' and
jokin' our way into prison. Don't
make me beg.
Jules and Vincent wait by Winston's Porsche.
JULES
We cool?
WINSTON
Like it never happened.
Jules and Vincent bump fists.
WINSTON
Boys, this is Raquel. Someday, all
this will be hers.
RAQUEL
(to the boys)
Hi. You know, if they ever do "I
SPY: THE MOTION PICTURE," you guys,
I'd be great.
What's with the
outfits. You guys going to a
volleyball game?
Winston laughs, the boys groan.
WINSTON
I'm takin' m'lady out to breakfast.
Maybe I can drop you two off. Where
do you live?
VINCENT
Redondo Beach.
JULES
Inglewood.
Winston grabs Jules' wrist and pantomimes like he's in a
"DEAD ZONE" trance.
WINSTON
(painfully)
It's your future: I see... a cab
ride.
(dropping the act)
Sorry guys, move out of the sticks.
(to Raquel)
Say goodbye, Raquel.
RAQUEL
Goodbye, Raquel.
WINSTON
I'll see you two around, and stay
outta trouble, you crazy kids.
Winston turns to leave.
JULES
Mr. Wolf.
He turns around.
JULES
I was a pleasure watchin' you work.
The Wolf smiles.
WINSTON
Call me Winston.
He turns and banters with Raquel as they get in the Porsche.
WINSTON
You hear that, young lady? Respect.
You could lean a lot from those two
fine specimens. Respect for one's
elders shows character.
RAQUEL
I have character.
WINSTON
Just because you are a character
doesn't mean you have character.
RAQUEL
Oh you're so funny, oh you're so
funny.
The Porsche SHOOTS OFF down the road.
The two men left alone look at each other.
JULES
Wanna share a cab?
VINCENT
You know I could go for some
breakfast.
Want to have breakfast
with me?
JULES
Sure.
