                What s the matter with you?  Got a run 

                in your panty hose?  Get it?  Cause

                What?  What are you talking about?  

                What happened?!        "Kohan/Mutchnick Pilot" Second Rev Network Draft 1/12/12 26.


                                  LOUIS

                I don t know.  We were talking about 

                you and Ali, so I hypothetically asked 

                him what he would say if I gave him a 

                marriage ultimatum, and he 

                  hypothetically said he d have to think 

                about it, and I hypothetically said, 

                 What do you mean you d have to think 

                about it?!  and he hypothetically 

                said,  Calm down, Louis,  and I 

                  hypothetically snapped and said 

                horrible things to him and then he not-

                  at-all-hypothetically kicked me out of 

                the apartment!  

                                    CHARLIE

                I can t believe what I m hearing.  

                                  LOUIS

                It was horrible.  I had no place to 

                go, you weren t answering your 

                phone... I had to sleep on the 

                streets.

                                    CHARLIE

                No, you didn t. 

                                  LOUIS

                Well, my mother s, which in some ways 

                is much more dangerous than the 

                streets.

                Anyway, I was freaking out until I 

                thought to myself,   Louis, you re not 

                going through this alone!  Charlie 

                broke up with Ali, too.  You ll go 

                through this together.  You ll help 

                each other.  Like always.  Maybe 

                you ll even see that this was the best 

                thing that could have happened to 

                either one of you!   Right?!

        (MITCH, RO-RO, CHARLIE, LOUIS)

      A HUNG OVER RO-RO PUTS DOWN HER PURSE AND TAKES OFF HER 
      JACKET.  SHE REVEALS THAT SHE IS WEARING A  NIGHT BEFORE  
      DRESS.  MITCH ENTERS.

                                  MITCH

                Ro-Ro, one of your bosses is using my 

                milk and leaving it out. I m iffy with 

                lactose as it is, and if that milk 

                were to curdle--

                                  RO-RO

                Listen, Al Roker Jr., you gotta stop 

                talking!  I had a rough night last 

                night, okay?  And this morning my Aunt 

                Angie drove past me during my walk of 

                shame, and for sure she s going to 

                tell my grandma, so I can kiss those 

                pearls goodbye.  Now if you keep 

                yapping about the milk, we re going to 

                throw down, and you will lose. 

                                  MITCH

                Maybe I ll switch to rice milk.

      MITCH CROSSES TO EXIT, BUT NOTICES THE EXQUISITELY

                (RE: MODEL) Wow, that s amazing.  Did 

                they build this?        "Kohan/Mutchnick Pilot" Second Rev Network Draft 1/12/12 40.


                                  RO-RO

                Don t touch it!  Judging by your 

                shoes, that tiny house is worth more 

                than your actual house.

                                  MITCH

                partner of mine?  

                                  RO-RO

                What s the matter?

                                    CHARLIE

                I ll tell you what s the matter --  

                (THEN, IN BARITONE) Hi, Mitch -- 

                (THEN, BACK TO RO)  He told Ali I was 

                going to break up with her.  The 

                  engagement is off!   

                                  MITCH

                And I m pretty sure he leaves my milk 

                out.

                Good morning everyone.  Ro-ro.  (IN

                I can t believe you actually showed 

                up.  I assume you ve come to 

                  apologize.  

                                  LOUIS

                Oh, do you?  Well, I ve got your 

                apology right here.

       ICE-CUBE RING.   

                                  RO-RO

                Holy crap!  Look at the size of that 

                rock!  You must have a detachable jaw 

                to get a piece of jewelry like that.  

                                  LOUIS

                  Elegantly put, Rosanna, but it s 

                glass.  His girlfriend made it and now 

                I m engaged because of it.  

                                    CHARLIE

                See, that s the difference between us.  

                I make engagements and you break 

                  engagements!

                You did!

                                  LOUIS

                That was a hypothetical!  I didn t say 

                he should marry me.  I just needed to 

                know that he would marry me.

                                  MITCH

                Hmm.   

                                  RO-RO 

                (TO MITCH)  What s with  hmm,  Gossip

                (TO LOUIS)  G ahead.  

                                  LOUIS

                You know I don t want to get married.  

                I m the dynamic, complicated one with 

                intimacy issues.  I don t want a 

                husband, just a life partner who tells 

                me I m beautiful even though he s the 

                 A  and I m the  C.   I m Oprah,

                                    CHARLIE

                For what you said to my girlfriend.

                                  LOUIS

                What about what you said to my 

                  girlfriend?   

      THEY STARE EACH OTHER DOWN FOR A COUPLE OF BEATS.  IT S VERY 
      TENSE. 

                                  RO-RO

                You know, in Staten Island, this is 

                where someone throws a punch. 

      ON CUE, THEY LUNGE AT EACH OTHER, EACH ONE GETTING THE OTHER 
      INTO A HEADLOCK.  THEY HAVE AN AWKWARD SCRUM AROUND THE 
      OFFICE.

                Alright, that s enough.  Break it up.  

      RO-RO STEPS IN AND TRIES TO SEPARATE THEM BUT INSTEAD FINDS 
      HERSELF SWEPT INTO THE FIGHT.  THEY ARE NOW A SIX-LEGGED 
      MONSTER THRASHING AROUND THE ROOM.  MOVING AS ONE, THEY SLAM 
      INTO THE MODEL, SMASHING IT TO PIECES.  RO-RO LEAPS TO HER 
      FEET.  

                                  RO-RO (CONT D)

                You happy now!?  Look what you did!!

                I m sorry, too.

                Okay, that s very touching, ladies, 

                but you still have a mess to deal 

                with.  Now you gotta fix what you

      HER WORDS RESONATE WITH THEM.  THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER.
