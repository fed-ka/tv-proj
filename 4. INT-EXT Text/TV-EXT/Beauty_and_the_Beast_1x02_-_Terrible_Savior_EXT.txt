      Cathy and Isaac (now in street clothes) are walking through a seedy
      Lower East Side neighborhood. The buildings are run down, at least
      a century old.

                                    ISAAC.
                    You got any idea how many students I
                    had last year?
                              (beat)
                    Too damn many. Don't matter if it's me
                    or one of those egg foo young places
                    uptown, we've all got more than we can
                    handle. Why do you suppose that is?


                                    CATHY
                    You're the teacher.You tell me.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)          Rev. 7/30/879.

                          Cause people are scared. You ain't
                          the only one come to me after
                          something bad went down.

              Self-consciously, Cathy touches her face. Beautiful now, but she
            remembers. She'll always remember. Isaac notices.

                                          ISAAC
                          Yeah. And you got off easy, compared
                          to some. They all come to me, after.
                                  (beat, then bitterly)
                          You can't do much after. 'Cept maybe
                          teach them a few tricks, so they
                          won't be so scared no more.

                          Here we are.





            They're standing in front of a refurbished three story tenement
            building at least a century old. It was a cheap hotel once, but
          now it's been converted to other uses: the modern sign on the
          door says PROTECTORS HQ. A young couple wearing distinctive snow-
          white berets exit and descend the stairs as Cathy turns to Isaac.


                                          CATHY

                          around on the subways looking for
                            trouble, right?

                          C'mon.

                        You gave me a lot to think about.

                                        ISAAC
                        That was the whole idea.

                      Talk to him, maybe. Ask him. Go to
                        where the man lives, and look him in
                      the eyes. But first I'd be real sure
                      of one thing. I'd be real sure that
                        I wanted to know.


                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:



        She's waiting out on the balcony, waiting for Vincent to come to
        her. The light spills through the glass doors behind her, and all
        around her are the city lights. She's reading a heavy hardcover
        book, probably something that Vincent gave her, but her mind
        isn't on the book .. she keeps LOOKING UP, anticipating his
        arrival.

        A tabloid newspaper lies on a small table beside her. ANGLING
        PAST Cathy, we see the headline:  SUBWAY SLASHER -PSYCHOPATH OR
        SAVIOR? 

                                                                      MATCH DISSOLVE TO:                                                                                          16.

                                                                                                      I
                                                                                                      '

      Many of the city lights are out; it's the silent, dark hours just
        before dawn. Cathy is asleep in her chair, the book on her chest.
      Cathy stirs restlessly in her sleep. We PAN slowly past her to
      the railing and the city beyond.

      CLOSE ON RAILING

      as Vincent's HAND suddenly appears from below. He grips the
      metal rail, pulls himself slowly into view. His grip is so
        strong that we see the rail slowly begin to BEND.

      BACK TO THE SCENE


      Cathy stirs, blinks, sees Vincent, and sits up abruptly.

                                      CATHY
                      You came...

        Vincent climbs over the rail as Cathy rises.

                                      CATHY
                      You don't know how much I needed to
                      see you.

      They embrace, but Cathy suddenly PULLS BACK.  She can
      tell that something is dreadfully amiss.

                                      CATHY
                        Vincent, what's wrong?

      CLOSE ON VINCENT

        Wordlessly, he smiles. Briefly, it looks like Vincent's normal
        smile: gentle, melancholy, full of compassion. Then it grows
        wider, turns into a mocking predatory grin for a moment, until
      his fangs are bared and we are looking into the eyes of the
        beast. Vincent SNARLS.

      BACK TO THE SCENE

        Terrified, Cathy tries to break free, but Vincent holds her tight,
      still snarling. They struggle.

                                      CATHY
                      No... Vincent, no!

      But it's no use, the humanity is gone from him. He attacks her
        savagely. Cathy begins to SCREAM, and we

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:                                                                                          17.



      as she wakes, still screaming and struggling, from her
        dream. It takes her a moment to realize it was just a
        dream. When the realization comes, Cathy sinks slowly back into
      her chair, staring bleakly out at sunrise. She covers her face
      with her hands.

                                                                    CUT TO:



        Cathy enters, looking morose, and goes to Edie at her
        computer console.

                                        EDIE
                        You look sadder than my last date.
                        Anything I can do?

                        I need to see the file on Mrs.
                        Beatrice Dalby.

        The name clearly rings a bell with Edie. She
        frowns

                                        EDIE
                        That's the cleaning lady who got
                        saved by the slasher, isn't it? I
                        didn't know you were supposed to
                          question her.

                                        CATHY
                        I'm not.

        Edie looks very dubious.This isn't by the book.

                                        EDIE
                        Then, why -

                                        CATHY.

                        Let's just say I've got a very
                        dirty apartment.

    With a sigh and a shake of her head, Edie starts hitting he~
      computer keys.

                                                                      CUT TO:



          Cathy gets out of a cab in front of high-rise glass and steel
          office building. She rings the night bell, and a SECURITY GUARD
          comes to the door. She flashes her DA's identification, and he
          admits her. Through the glass, we SEE them talking for a
          moment, as he directs her.

                                                                        CUT TO:



      Cathy gets out of a cab and hurries up the steps. As she opens
      the doors, she glances at the building's cornice. Chiselled
      into the stone, very faint and eroded with age, are the words
        SEAMAN'S SAFE HAVEN.



        Cathy and Jace emerge from the building, and Cathy walks briskly
        down the steps. Jace's smile fades as Cathy starts down the
        sidewalk. One of his lieutenants, RED, appears in the door and
        gives Jace a questioning look. Jace NODS. Red saunters after
        Cathy.

                                                                      CUT TO:



        Cathy opens the doors, sees Vincent, tentatively goes to him.*

                                                                                                        *

                                      CATHY
                        I thought I might never see you
                        again. . .

                                        VINCENT
                        There is too much fear in your world
                        already, Catherine. I could not bring
                        you more.

        Cathy looks at Vincent's hand, touches it, hesitantly turns it*
        over. Light shines softly off his claws. She looks in his eyes.*
          (production Note. use real hands)*

                        Catherine, stop. You were right to be
                        afraid. Your heart knows the truth.


                                        CATHY
                        My heart knows how gentle you are.

                                   VINCENT
                        Even the gentlest man has a demon
                        locked inside him.

                                        CATHY
                                  (strong and sure)
                        Yes, Vincent. You are.

        He looks into her eyes for a long beat, and nods slowly.

                                        VINCENT
                        Bring me a map.

          Cathy goes inside, and the camera begins to PULL BACK. She re-
          emerges with maps in hand, and we continue to pull back as she
        and Vincent lean over them, talking.

                                                                      MATCH DISSOLVE:        Rev. 8/03/8741.


  56POV SHOT - THROUGH BINOCULARS56

        of Cathy and Vincent on the balcony.



        Red squats on the roof of a nearby building, wearing his
          white beret, studying Cathy's building through a pair of
          binoculars. He lowers them slowly, a look of absolute
          astonishment on his face, then shakes his head and quickly looks
          again.

                                                                      CUT TO:



        Cathy, wearing a robe over her thin nightgown, shivers as
        Vincent tells her of Jace's fate.

                                      CATHY
                        Then you never found a body?

                                        VINCENT
                        The children say that abyss goes
                        down forever. Too deep and too
                        dangerous for us to plumb. He's
                        dead, Catherine...
                                  (softly)*
                        and his shadow has lifted from*
                        your heart.*

        Cathy smiles a sweet, sad smile for him, and we know that he's*
        right, that her fear is gone. Then she turns and looks out over*
        the breaking dawn.*

                                                                        (CONTINUED)  81CONTINUED:81

                                      CATHY "*
                      The killings will stop, but...
                      they'll never know... never know
                      if he's dead or gone or just...
                      waiting... waiting down there until
                      he's needed again... like King
                      Arthur.
                                (bittersweet smile)
                      I think Jace would like that.

                              (beat) "
                      Bow can one man have so much
                      courage and passion and empathy
                      and so little mercy?

                                      VINCENT*
                      Perhaps he lost it somewhere,
                      Catherine. But he found it again, in
                      the end.


      They embrace for a long beat, as the sun comes up over the city..
