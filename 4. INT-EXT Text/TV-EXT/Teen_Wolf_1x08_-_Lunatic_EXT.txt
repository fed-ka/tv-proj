                    You get your best friend drunk.

      He holds up the bottle of Jack with a big smile. When he sets 
      it down on a rock... 

      It s HALF EMPTY. No telling how much time has passed, but 
      long enough for Stiles to have gotten completely wasted. The 
      two friends keep warm around a STEEL TRASH CAN with A FIRE 
      BLAZING inside.

                    another drink.

      He reaches for the bottle again, but A HAND grabs it first. 
      Stiles steps back, looking up in surprise at--

      TWO TWENTY-SOMETHINGS. The larger is REDDICK, an unfortunate 
      combination of muscle and antisocial behavior. His friend is

                    Well, look at the little bitches 
                    getting their drink on.

      Stiles steps away as Unger laughs with an obnoxious 
      tittering. Scott keeps his gaze leveled on Reddick.

      Uneasy, Reddick challenges him by taking a shot. When he 
      lowers the bottle, he eyes Scott with a satisfied smile. But 
      it fades when Scott finally stands. His approach is calm. 
      Deliberate.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Give me the bottle.

      Reddick looks to Unger. But his friend is no longer laughing. 
      Something unnerving about Scott s total calm. Then, as 
      Reddick raises the bottle to take another sip--

      Scott steps closer and his eyes change, BURNING with a sickly 
      YELLOW GLOW.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Give me. The bottle. Of Jack.

      Staring into Scott s yellow eyes, Reddick slowly and shakily 
      holds the bottle out.

      Just a few feet away, Stiles notices Scott s right hand, 
      CLAWS EXTENDED. His fingers tense as if preparing to swipe at 
      Reddick s jugular.

      SMASHES against a tree, EXPLODING into a million shards.

      But Scott, keeps a hand on the door. His eyes gazing back to 
      the dark woods where--


      Reddick and Unger hurry down a trail.

                    How about you just shut up?

      Reddick pauses to light a joint, hunching over to shield the 
      lighter in the wind. But the spark won t catch.

                                  UNGER

                    off out here.

      Reddick finally gets a FLAME when--SOMETHING YANKS HIM BACK 
      INTO THE DARKNESS.

      As the LIGHTER drops to the ground, a slack-jawed Unger 
      glances up to the blackness in front of him. Breathless, he 
      takes a step back. Then another and another, until he turns 
      and--

      SOMETHING GRABS HIS ANKLE.

      Unger flips forward, face smacking into the dirt. Something 
      DRAGS him back through the woods. He grabs for the ground, 
      fingers slipping over exposed roots, digging at the dirt.

                    Help! Help me!

      A dazed Reddick gazes up from the ground to see Unger being 
      dragged past. He reaches for him, grabbing at his wrist. But 
      just as he grabs hold--

      Unger slips through his fingers, dragged back and then LIFTED 
      RIGHT UP OFF THE GROUND.

      Arms flailing as he rises into the air, his body swings 
      about. He tries to grab at branches, but they rip out of his 
      grasp as someone or something carries him back down the 
      trail.      TEEN WOLF "Episode 108"GOLDENROD DRAFT1/20/114AA.

      Coming closer and closer to the trash can, Unger is lifted 
      higher, up and over the flames. Hands pulling back from the 
        incinerating heat, he writhes about, SCREAMING as he tries to

                    there to protect us. Because I know 
                    that when a guy risks his life for 
                    you, you should be grateful.

      Scott lifts his eyes to hers, a new and distinctly sinister 
      quality to his gaze. His lower teeth just visible between his 
      lips, it s an animal-like expression.

                                  SCOTT
                    Are you grateful?

      He slides his hand off the bench, coming closer.

                                  LYDIA
                    I think you d be pretty surprised 
                    at just how grateful I am. To be 
                    honest, Scott...

      Her hand comes up, brushing against his shirt, fingers 
      lightly touching his chest.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    I have so much gratitude, I m not 
                    sure how to express all of it.

      Her lips come close to his as her voice turns to a whisper.*

                    But I could try...

      Lydia kisses him. His mouth opens to hers, as she rakes *
      fingers down his chest. He gropes back at her, pulling her *
      into him, hands clawing at her. There s nothing sensual about 
      it.         TEEN WOLF "Episode 108"GOLDENROD DRAFT1/20/1125.

      Almost like he could go from kissing her to tearing out her 
      throat without even blinking.

      BACK ON THE FIELD - Stiles nervously chews at the laces on 
      his lacrosse stick. He whirls around when Scott comes walking 
      back to join the practice.

                                  STILES
                    Hey. What happened?

      Scott turns back, Stiles s request seemingly forgotten.

                                  SCOTT
                    What?

                                  STILES
                    What do you mean what? Did you ask 
                    her? Did she say anything? Did she 
                    say she liked me? Imply she liked *
                    me?

                                  SCOTT
                    Yeah. Yeah, she likes you. In fact, 
                    she s totally into you.

      As Scott turns away, an elated Stiles never notices the ever 
      darkening expression falling over his best friend s face.

      FADE IN:


      Coach blows the WHISTLE sending the first OFFENSIVE PLAYER 
      into a drill. Scott and Stiles wait in line for their turn.

                                  STILES
                    Are you okay, dude?

      Scott doesn t answer, gloves twisting around his stick.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    I know we had good news and all 
                    that, but it s seven hours left 
                    till the full moon--

      The WHISTLE blows for the next play. Scott s turn.

      Coach tosses the ball and Scott goes for it. Moving fast, 
      twisting his stick to keep the ball in tight--

      TWO PLAYERS COLLIDE with Scott, ramming into him with 
      unwarranted brutality. He tumbles to the ground, stick 
      clattering away from him.

                                  COACH
                          (laughing)
                    I guess some people don t 
                      appreciate your new status, McCall.

      Behind the lineup of other players, Stiles looks out to see 
      Scott snap right back up to his feet in an acrobatic kip up.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                    Next!

      But before another player can step forward, Scott whips his 
      lacrosse stick in front of him. Teeth bared underneath his 
      helmet, he steps to the head of the line again.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                    That s the spirit. Earn it, McCall! 
                    Earn it!

      He sends the ball bouncing to the ground. Scott grabs it and 
      shoots forward at the TWO LONG STICK DEFENDERS. He smashes 
      through them like a BATTERING RAM.

      Playing goal, Danny comes forward to stop the offensive 
      attack but--        TEEN WOLF "Episode 108"GOLDENROD DRAFT1/20/1127.

      Scott whips around and shoves his elbow into Danny s helmet, 
      sending him TUMBLING THROUGH THE AIR.

      Danny goes down with a strangled cry of PAIN. He hits the 
      ground hard, helmet snapping into the dirt.

      Coach BLOWS the whistle as other players start forward. 
      Jackson shoves past everyone, alarmed for his friend.

      AT THE BLEACHERS - Lydia stands up.

                                  LYDIA
                    Was that Danny?

      Stepping down, she hurries ONTO THE FIELD where Stiles pulls 
      Scott away from the gathering crowd.

                                  STILES
                    What the hell s wrong with you? You *
                    just took Danny down.

                                  SCOTT
                    So what? He s twice the size of me.*

                                  STILES
                    So everyone likes Danny. Which *
                    means everyone s going to hate you.

                                  SCOTT
                    I don t care.

      They turn back to see Danny slowly sitting up as an EMT 
      rushes in. The cracked front plate of his helmet is removed 
      to reveal BLOOD running out of his nose.

      Scott s head snaps back as he takes in the scent of BLOOD. 
      The corners of his lips curl upward in a smile that s more 
      than slightly evil.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                          (noticing Stiles s look)
                    What?

      He shoves past, heading for the school. Stiles turns his 
      attention back to the crowd around Danny.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 108"GOLDENROD DRAFT1/20/1128.

      Lydia steps to Jackson s side.

                    Is he okay?

                    It looks like he s just got a 
                    bloody...

      He trails off, staring at her.

                    What?

                                    JACKSON
                    Your lipstick.

      Whipping out a compact she glances at the reflection to see 
      her lipstick slightly smeared.

                                  LYDIA
                    Oh. Wonder how that happened.

      Jackson watches her fix the smear with her thumb.

                                    JACKSON
                    Yeah. I wonder...

      He doesn t notice that someone else has overheard the 
        conversation...

      Stiles. His eyes on Lydia.


      Stiles s Jeep roars into the driveway of the McCall home as 
      Melissa steps out the door on her way to work.

      He opens his trunk and pulls out his bag letting it drop to 
      the ground with a HEAVY, METALLIC CLUNK. They both gaze down 
      at the bag for an awkward moment.

                    with the word lunatic.

      Stiles nods as Melissa yanks the door of her car shut.


      Something moves with alarming speed through the woods, 
      whipping past trees, soaring into frame-- 

      Scott, transformed into a werewolf. His eyes GLOWING YELLOW, 
      face an expression of pure animal rage, arms straining with 
      powerful lunges forward. He charges into the darkness--

      Into the night.

      Stiles barrels out the front door of the McCall home. He 
      charges into his Jeep and fires up the engine.


      Moving fast. A discolored and strange POV racing past trees, 
      smashing through foliage, faster and faster--


      Scott leaps up out of the darkness, landing on the roof of an 
      empty car in the parking lot.

      Ragged breath pluming out from between his fangs, he gazes 
      past the other vehicles parked outside the sports store, eyes 
      landing on Jackson s Porsch .

      THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD - Allison and Jackson can be seen 
      talking inside. A seemingly innocent conversation. Until--

      Scott BLINKS. And the perspective changes.

      THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD - The talking becomes heated groping 
      and kissing. Jackson all over Allison s neck as her palm 
      presses to the window. His hands go up her shirt, urging the 
      small of her back to arch toward him.


      Scott s low growls heighten as he watches them, his yellow 
      eyes blinking rapidly. For a moment he sees them just 
      talking. But then his perspective changes again--

      THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD - Jackson slides on top of Allison as 
      he pulls her closer to him with his other hand, their kissing 
      becoming more and more passionate.


      With a last inhuman snarl, Scott hurtles off the roof of the 
      car, pouncing down onto the parking lot.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 108"GOLDENROD DRAFT1/20/1140.

      His clawed hands rake across the black pavement as he shoots 
      forward, loping at higher and higher speeds.

      Then, bounding up into the air, he lands right on top of 
      Jackson s car.


      On top of the car, Scott reaches up with a clawed hand to 
      strike down and--

      SOMETHING FLIES OUT OF THE DARKNESS toppling him to the 
      ground.

      The shadowy figure flips forward, landing on his feet. It s 
      Derek. In werewolf form, baring his fangs at Scott. And very 
      much alive...


      Tumbling through foliage, Scott tries to fight Derek off, but 
      the older werewolf is far more powerful. He pounds him back 
      into the woods, dragging him into the shadows.

      Derek pushes down on him and SNARLS with an unbridled

      But then a GURNEY is rolled out of the woods. Stiles looks on 
      it, terrified. He rushes forward as voices shout for him to 
      stop. When he gets to the gurney, the body he sees--

      Is not his father. It s Unger. The twenty-something with 
      Reddick who grabbed their bottle of Jack when Stiles was 
      trying to get Scott drunk.

      His body is BURNED, a HORRIBLY CHARRED CORPSE.

                    here?

      But Stiles can t answer. He just crumbles into his father s 
      arms, near tears and utterly beaten by the day. No idea what 
      to say or what his son s been through, Stilinski simply hugs 
      him back.

      Neither of them notice the SUV pulling up nearby.


      And underneath that moon, somewhere high up on a the rocky 
      face of a steep hill, the Alpha kneels down. Moonlight 
      washing over its muscular and hulking body--

      The creature TRANSFORMS. Rapidly shifting back, its monstrous 
      features reverting back into the naked torso of a man.

      An ordinary man.
