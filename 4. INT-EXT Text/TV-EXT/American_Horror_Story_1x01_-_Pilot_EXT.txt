PUSH across a leaf-strewn lawn to find a GIRL, eight, with 
long braids, staring at an abandoned Victorian house that has 
fallen into grave disrepair. Shutters missing, paint 
peeling...an ingenue turned dowager by the march of time. 

Suddenly, a rock whizzes by the girl s head and SHATTERS an 
upper story window. She turns and we finally SEE her face. 
This is ADELAIDE, and she has Down Syndrome.

TWO BOYS, TEN, bash a gate open with a baseball bat and strut 
into the yard. This is Troy and Bryan...the Rutger twins.  

TROY
Hey, retard.

They head into the empty derelict house, on a mission.

Adelaide suddenly speaks.

ADELAIDE
Excuse me.

They stop, turn.

ADELAIDE (CONT D)
You re going to die in there.

They stare at her a beat, the moment is shocking. Then Troy 
runs to her, viciously pushes her to the ground. He regards 
her, spits on her, then heads back into the house.


They pull into the driveway.  Everyone takes a good look -- 
it s looking better than it did the last time we saw it. New 
paint, shutters, gutters. There s a FOR SALE sign on the 
lawn. All three of them take it in as they come to a stop.

BEN
This is it.

Vivien is unsure. Violet is intrigued. MARCY, the RELATOR 
greets them from the front porch with a WAVE.


As MOVERS finish bringing the last boxes in, Marcy pulls the 
IN ESCROW sign off of the FOR SALE sign and replaces it with 
one that says SOLD.


Violet walks through the commons, SMOKING.  She surveys the 
scene -- a few kids reliving their grandparents  Haight 
Ashbury fashion mistakes but most are unmemorable. Upper 
middle class high school in an upscale urban neighborhood.  

She passes THREE pretty girls -- seniors dressed like they re 
twenty-five -- talking up some boys -- LEAH, BECCA and ABBY.  
Overhears their conversation --

LEAH
So I let him.

BECCA
Do coke off of your nipples?

LEAH
They were numb for like two days.

They all crack up. Violet tries to disappear into her sweater 
as she passes, but --

LEAH (CONT D) 
Hey! Student council passed a rule 
against smoking in public spaces.

The girls step in front of her.

BECCA
Second hand smoke kills.15.


Violet puts the cigarette out. 

VIOLET
I didn t know. I m new.

Violet nervously flicks her butt into a planter. Leah flips.

LEAH
What the hell is the matter with 
you? People sit here. They eat 
here.

VIOLET
You don t know me. Why are you 
doing this?

BECCA
Leah s grandma died of lung cancer.  
She takes this stuff pretty 
seriously.

Leah holds the butt out to Violet.

LEAH
Eat it.
(off Violet s shock)
Eat it. Or I m going to kick the 
shit out of you.

ABBY
Come on, Leah, it s enough.

LEAH
No, I want to see her eat it.

She grabs Violet s face.

BECCA
Seriously, Leah, she s like twelve.

Leah starts trying to shove the cigarette into Violet s 
mouth, but Violet resists, then instinctively SPITS in Leah s 
face. That stuns everyone. Abby and Becca can t help but 
laugh. A beat, then Violet takes off running.

LEAH
(calling after her)
You re dead!  DEAD!16.



Ben tosses the suit in the GARBAGE.


Vivien hangs BEDSHEETS up on clothes lines, drying them.  
It s peaceful, golden light, an easy breeze. A TALL WOMAN, in 
her sixties comes around into the backyard.

VIVIEN
Can I help you?

MOIRA
I m Moira O Hara, I m the 
housekeeper.

VIVIEN
I didn t know the place came with 
one.

MOIRA
Why are you hanging your sheets?  
Perfectly good electric dryer 
inside.

VIVIEN
I don t like the chemicals in 
fabric softener and the organic 
ones don t work. This is the only 
way to dry them without static 
cling.

Moira s impressed.  

MOIRA
I work Monday through Thursday.  
Four hundred a week. If you have a 
dinner party and you want me to 
serve or straighten up, it s extra. 
Thanksgiving on, Christmas off. 
That was the deal with the last 
fellows.

VIVIEN
I m sorry, I m just not sure if we 
need a maid.

MOIRA
What have you been using to clean 
the floorboards?  

VIVIEN
Murphy s oil soap.26.


MOIRA
No. White Vinegar. Oil soap kills 
the wood. Have you ever owned a 
house this old?

VIVIEN
No.

MOIRA
It has a personality, feelings.  
Mistreat it and you will regret it.  
Trust me, madam, you need me.
(then)
May I come in? My cab s left and 
I d like to call another.

Off Vivien --


TIGHT on bolt-cutters slicing through the locks.


Ben runs out, searches for the man through the sheets, but 
he s gone. It s like he was never there.


Violet, smoking, minds her business when she s SHOVED from 
behind. She stumbles, drops her cigarette. Turns to see Leah 
and her bitch friends.

LEAH
I told you not to smoke out here.38.


Violet stands tall, no fear.

VIOLET
What is your problem, bitch?

LEAH
She just call me a bitch?

ABBY
Sounded like bitch.

VIOLET
Seriously. Mommy drink too much?  
Daddy love your brother more? Your 
uncle play with your titties when 
you were a kid? I m not scared of 
you.

LEAH
You should be.

Staredown.  Then Violet sees it: a twitch in Leah s face -- 
Violet might not be scared, but Leah is. Violet CHARGES her, 
grabs Leah around the waist linebacker style and DRIVES her 
into the concrete. OTHER STUDENTS notice, form a circle.

STUDENTS
Fight, fight, fight!

Violet gets two punches in before Abby and Becca attack.  
Three on one -- not very good odds for Violet. She gets the 
shit beaten out of her, but she still puts up a pretty good 
fight. Leah gets her down, punches through Violet s raised 
hands. Violet reaches out, grabs her STILL LIT CIGARETTE from 
the ground and pushes it into Leah s arm. Leah SCREAMS, jumps 
off. Violet scurries to her feet.

LEAH
She freaking burned me!

Kids disperse, there are teachers coming. Violet sees them. 
Takes off.  


Leah is whirled around by a calm Violet.

VIOLET
Here s the deal. I need you to stop 
harassing me. I ve got what you 
want. Drugs. Come to my house 
tomorrow, get your free sample. I m 
a dealer, and a good one. I ve got 
the best shit in town. 

Violet smiles darkly, leaves. Leah is intrigued.


A hand pushes open the gate. REVEAL Leah, who stops and 
stares at the house. 


Violet enters, apprehensive. Abby and Becca -- Leah s buddies 
-- come up and surround her.

ABBY
What did you do to Leah?

Violet is ready to rumble.

VIOLET
I didn t do anything.53.


BECCA
Bullshit. Something happened to her 
at your house.

Violet tenses her fist. It s about to go down.

VIOLET
So?

BECCA
So it was awesome! She totally 
dropped out of school, you 
terrorized her! Great job.

The girls are laughing.

VIOLET
I thought you were her friends. 

ABBY
We hung out with her because her 
parents were always away so we 
could party at her house.

BECCA
Killer pool.

ABBY
She was a total bitch.

BECCA
Hard core.

ABBY
Anyway. We re hitting up The Bagel 
after school. It s a pretty cool 
deli down in the Mission if you 
want to come. A lot of the kids 
from here go there.

BECCA
Serious dude-age. 

VIOLET
Sounds all right. Should I meet 
you?

ABBY
No, I got my dad s car. We re be 
out front at three.

Violet nods. The girls heads off. As they go --54.


BECCA
You think I could pull off that 
Taylor Momsen black eye shadow 
thing?

Violet takes it all in, smiles. Holy crap -- she has friends.


Ben stretches. Ready for a RUN. Senses something.  He 
covertly turns.  Spies the BURNT MAN in a car, lurking.  A 
beat, then Ben starts his run.  The car pulls out, following 
him.  


Ben runs into GOLDEN GATE PARK. The Burnt Man follows.  
Parks. Continues on foot. He s slow, but he cuts through the 
TREES to keep up.

Ben SPEEDS UP. Runs out of frame. We re with the Burnt Man 
now.  Out of breath. Searching for Ben. He s lost him, then --  
Ben grabs him. Spins him around violently.

BEN
Who are you? Why are you following 
me?! 

The Burnt Man cowers. We can see how old he is now, 
vulnerable, afraid.

BURNT MAN
Please. Your family is in danger. 

Ben calms. Backs off. After a beat we CUT TO:


A bench underneath the Bridge.  Ben sits beside the Burnt 
Man.  We get a good look at him now -- his face is mangled, 
so are his hands. Burns that severe can t heal. The Burnt Man 
notices Ben s hand.

BURNT MAN
What happened to your hand?

BEN
What happened to your face?

BURNT MAN
It s not just my face. Seventy 
percent of my body. You don t 
survive something like that -- and 
this was the sixties.
(MORE)55.

BURNT MAN (CONT'D)
(then)
I m Larry Harvey -- and you have to 
get out of that house.

BEN
I could have you arrested, you 
know? Peeking in peoples  windows 
is a crime -- even in San 
Francisco.

LARRY
They re not going to put me back in 
jail. I have brain cancer -- 
terminal and inoperable.  

BEN
I m sorry.

LARRY
Don t be. That s the only reason 
they let me out.  
(a beat)
Homicide. Triple homicide. San 
Quentin for forty-two-years without 
a cold then two months ago they 
diagnose me with these tumors in my 
head. Some people would call that 
fate.  

BEN
God gave you cancer so you could 
get out of prison and tell me to 
move?

LARRY
Maybe. I don t know. I ve seen 
stranger things.  

BEN
Sounds more like a man who is 
searching for a chance at 
redemption for the awful things 
he s done.

Larry chuckles.  There s no redemption for him. He pauses, 
then looks at Ben directly. 

LARRY
I made it six months in the house 
you live in now before I started 
hearing the voices. My wife thought 
I was working too hard. My daughter 
Angie -- she was six. The older one 
Margaret was ten. 
(MORE)56.

LARRY (CONT'D)
Looked like her mother. Funny how 
it skips a generation like that.

BEN
Look, I get that you re lonely and 
you re struggling.  Getting out of 
prison after all of those years.  
I m sure...

LARRY
I killed them all.  

Off Ben, shocked we FLASH TO:


Ben is shocked. Larry is crying. He takes a beat.  

LARRY
I don t know how I put the myself 
out. I remember the night, but it s 
like a movie. Have you been 
sleepwalking?

The question hits Ben hard.

LARRY (CONT D)
I ve seen your family. Pretty wife. 
You seem like good people. If you 
don t get out of that house you re 
all going to die in there.

BEN
There are some pretty serious side 
effects to brain tumors. People 
hallucinate, act strangely, invent 
whole worlds in their heads.

LARRY
Look up my case. Read the 
transcripts.

Ben gets up.

BEN
I m a doctor. They might not put 
you back in jail but I could 
certainly get you committed to a 
state mental institution.  Trust 
me, those places make prison look 
like Club Med. Leave my family 
alone.

Larry jumps up, desperate.

LARRY
Please. Please get out of there.  
That place is evil.   

BEN
Get off of me!  I m not kidding, 
leave us alone.

Ben starts off.  A beat before Larry calls after him --58.


LARRY
You never answered me -- what 
happened to your hand?

Ben looks down at his hand. Fear plays across Ben s face 
before he jogs off -- speeding up as he goes.
