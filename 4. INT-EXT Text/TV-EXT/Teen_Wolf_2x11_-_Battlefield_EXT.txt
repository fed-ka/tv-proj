      Gloved hands taking hold of Matt, Gerard shoves his head into 
      the creek water.


      Deputies string POLICE TAPE around the site of Matt s 
      drowning while Stilinski watches a CORONER zip up a BODY BAG.

                                  STILES (V.O.)
                    But when you finally do let it in, 
                    that s when it stops hurting. It s 
                    not scary anymore. It s actually 
                    kind of peaceful.

                    Are you saying you hope Matt felt 
                    some peace in his last moments?                TEEN WOLF "Episode 211" BLUE 4/6/122.



      As the body bag is lifted up to be taken away, Stilinski 
      kneels to look out over the water.

                                    MORRELL (V.O.)
                    One positive thing came out of it, 
                    though. Right?

      The REFLECTION of something metallic and shiny glints off the 
      water. Stilinski turns to find a hand holding out his 
      SHERIFF S BADGE. With a soft smile of pride, he takes it.


      Backpacks slung over their shoulders, Erica and Boyd hurry 
      through the woods. Boyd grabs Erica by the arm, stopping her.

                                  ERICA
                    Derek said to be back before the 
                    sun comes up.

                                  BOYD
                    I thought I heard something.

                                  ERICA
                    If we re doing the I thought I 
                    heard something thing we shouldn t 
                    be stopping. We should be running.

                                  BOYD
                    Listen.

      Erica holds still, watching Boyd s eyes wander over through 
      the trees. Then they both hear it. A HOWLING.

                                  ERICA
                    Was that a coyote?

      Boyd shakes his head.

                                  ERICA (CONT D)
                    Wolf?

                                  BOYD
                    Can t be. There are no wolves in

                    Maybe it was--

      But she stops as the HOWLING rises again. Louder and closer. 
      Both she and Boyd slowly turn about, trying to discern its 
      position.

      Another wolf begins HOWLING. Then another joins in. And 
      another and another, until--

      An astonished Boyd and Erica find themselves listening to a 
      CHORUS of WOLVES, their plaintiff cries rising and falling, 
      soaring up and into the woods.

      The field lies dark, quiet and empty. Until one-by-one the 
      STADIUM LIGHTS burst on, the GAME CLOCK resets to zero and an 
      excited crowd begins filling the bleachers.


      Scott sits next to Stiles on the bench as the crowd fills the 
      bleachers, moments from the game beginning.

      Stiles looks to Scott who gives his friend a nod of 
      encouragement.

      IN THE BLEACHERS - Melissa notices Stilinski slowly rising.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Why s my son running onto the

                    Because he s on the team?

                                  STILINSKI
                    He is. He s on the team. He s on 
                    the field. My son s on the field!

      The crowd on the bleachers all look up at Stilinski. With a 
      huge smile on his face, he quietly sits back down. Even Scott 
      can t help but smile. Until a VOICE finds its way into his 
      hearing...

                                  GERARD (V.O.)
                    Scott? Can you hear me?*

      He turns, scanning the bleachers, trying to locate Gerard.*

                                  GERARD (V.O.)
                    Ah, you can. Good. Then listen 
                    closely. Because the game s about 
                    to get interesting...


        A preternatural quiet grips the woods. Until the LIGHTS of an 
      ALL TERRAIN VEHICLE part the shadows. ENGINES ROARING, two 
      ATV s loaded with Argent s hunters burst through the trees.

      The ATV driving Allison and Argent slows to a stop, engine 
      lowering to an idle. Argent turns to his daughter.

                                  ARGENT
                    Play it again.

      Allison raises a REMOTE and clicks a button on it, Argent 
      glances to the SPEAKER attached to the front of the ATV.

      With a high-powered clarity, a HOWL soars from the speaker 
      and into the woods. The sound quickly becomes a chorus of 
      WOLVES.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 211" BLUE 4/6/1226.

      The HOWLS rise, louder and louder.

      FADE IN:


      Gerard s SILVER PILL BOX reflects the stadium lights as he 
      turns it over in his hand. He stands at the edge of the field 
      surveying the two teams lining up.

                                  GERARD
                    Let s put a real clock on this 
                    game, Scott.

      Sitting on the bench just a few yards away, Scott keeps his 
      eyes forward, unwilling to glance at Gerard.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    I ll give you until the last thirty 
                    seconds. When that scoreboard clock

                    if you haven t given me Derek, 
                    Jackson is going to kill someone.

      ON THE FIELD - Jackson lowers for the face-off.

                    So tell me who s going to die 
                    tonight, Scott? Should it be your 
                    mother who so bravely came out to 
                    support you?

      IN THE BLEACHERS - an anxious Melissa glances about the 
      crowd.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    Or the Sheriff? Your best friend s 
                    father?

      Nervous for his son, Stilinski can barely sit still.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    Or how about the pretty little red-
                    head who managed to survive the 
                    bite of an Alpha?

      Arriving just in time, Lydia takes a seat next to Melissa, 
      giving her a smile.

      Danny holds his position at goal while Stiles nervously

                    Or should I do everyone a favor and 
                    kill that ridiculous Coach?

      Gerard gives a polite nod to Coach as the man hurtles past 
      him, nervously pacing the sidelines.

                    It s up to you, Scott. But you are 
                    going to help me take Derek down.

      Anger rising with each breath, Scott looks like he might 
      explode off the bench.

                    field and drench everyone you love 
                    and care about in blood.

      THE WHISTLE BLOWS. The game begins.


      Lydia gazes out on the field watching Stiles glance up in 
      shock as the BALL lands right in the pocket of his lacrosse 
      stick.

                                  STILES
                    Oh God.

      Before he can even turn around, a PLAYER rams into him. The 
      sound of CRUNCHING PADS brings audible groans from the crowd.

                                    MELISSA
                    He s probably just getting warmed 
                    up.

      At the next WHISTLE BLOW, Stiles races for the ball, slapping 
      helplessly at it while OPPOSING PLAYERS converge on him. 

      Another VICIOUS CRUNCH sets the crowd flinching back.

                                  LYDIA
                    He s just a little nervous. Plenty 
                    of time to turn it around.

      Another WHISTLE BLOW. Stiles tries to catch a pass, but the 
      ball BOUNCES right off his helmet.

      Melissa and Lydia look at each other, neither able to come up 
      with a new excuse. They turn to Stilinski, but he has his 
      head buried in his hands.

      AT THE BENCHES - Scott rises to his feet, eyes on the 
      scoreboard to see Beacon Hills down by several points.

                                  COACH
                    Sit down, McCall.

                    I m aware of that. Now sit.

        Reluctantly, Scott eases back onto the bench just as a hand 
      reaches in to grab a helmet. He looks up in surprise at--              TEEN WOLF "Episode 211" BLUE 4/6/1230.

      From the sidelines Gerard spots Isaac and Scott. The two boys 
      glance defiantly back at him, noticing that Gerard does not 
      look pleased by the surprise entrance. 

      Not pleased at all.


      Erica and Boyd charge through the shadows, darting past trees 
      and kicking up brush and leaves as they try to escape.

      But the ROAR of the ATV ENGINES bears down on them, closing 
      in. HEADLIGHTS whip across the trees, cutting through the 
      shadows just as--

                                  ARGENT
                    There!

      Argent aims a MAGLITE on the two running teenagers. But the 
      driver of the ATV is forced to slow as a throng of trees 
      looms ahead of them.

      Allison grabs the opportunity. When the ATV looks about to 
      stop, she jumps off.

                    Allison, wait--

      But she s already hitting the ground, rolling with her BOW 
      pressed outward. She spins over the leaves and brush and 
      rises gracefully into a shooting stance.

      String pulled back, Allison lets an arrow fire.

      Ahead, Erica can t help but turn as she hears the sound of 
      something cutting through the air. She jolts back with a CRY 
      as the arrow goes into her leg and sends her tumbling to the 
      ground. 

      With a pained look she turns to see Boyd standing there in 
      fearful shock.

                                  ERICA

                    Go!

      Boyd begins retreating back, swallowed up by the darkness as 
      a BEAM OF LIGHT finds Erica, trapping her in its cold GLARE.

      FADE IN:


      Pulling his helmet on, Isaac turns to Scott.

                                  ISAAC
                    You got a plan yet?

                                  SCOTT
                    Right now it s pretty much just 
                    keep Jackson from killing someone.

                                  ISAAC
                    That might be easier if you re in 
                    the game. We have to make it so 
                    Coach has no choice but to play 
                    you.

                                  SCOTT
                    How do we do that? He s got a bench 
                    full of guys he can use before he 
                    ever puts me on the field.

      Isaac and Scott look over the players on the bench. Then 
      slowly turn to each other as if both coming to the same idea.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Can you do it without putting 
                    anyone in the hospital?

                                  ISAAC
                    I can try.

      OUT ON THE FIELD - The Ref blows the WHISTLE and Isaac races 
      past to take his position.

      Lowered for the face-off, Jackson turns an icy gaze on him. 
      But Isaac just winks back at him, eliciting a curious look 
      from Jackson.

      THE WHISTLE BLOWS and the ball drops. In the crash of 
      players, Isaac knocks a shoulder into a fellow Beacon Hills 
      TEAMMATE and sends him CRASHING to the dirt.

                                  COACH
                    Ramirez! You re in.

      One of the three players on the bench gets up to race onto 
      the field while the injured TEAMMATE is helped past Scott.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 211" BLUE 4/6/1233.

      CONTINUED:3434

      With another WHISTLE BLOW and another BRUTAL CRASH, a 2ND 
      TEAMMATE comes rolling toward Coach s feet. Bewildered, he 
      turns back to the bench again.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                    Murphy. You re in.
                          (to the field)
                    Lahey, what the hell s your 
                    problem?

      Isaac glances back at Coach and holds his hands up in 
      apology.


      Out of the smoke and fog, Allison walks calmly toward her 
      prey. With a cry of pain, Erica SNAPS the end of the arrow 
      off and staggers back to her feet.

      But Allison already has another arrow nocked. She FIRES.

      A HAND WHIPS OUT, catching the arrow just before it can hit 
      Erica. She gazes up at Boyd in front of her with a mixture of 
      relief and fear because--

      Allison FIRES again.

      Boyd isn t fast enough this time. The arrow goes right into 
      his stomach. He opens his mouth, SNARLING through fangs.

      Allison replies with another arrow.

      This one takes him in the thigh. But Boyd just SNARLS again. 
      He starts forward, charging toward Allison. Then snaps back 
      as another arrow goes right into him. And then another. And 
      another.

                                  ERICA
                    Stop!

      But looking frightfully cold, Allison already has a new arrow 
      drawn back.


      Bodies CRASH into each other on the field. Among several 
      downed players, Isaac also hits the ground.

      Rolling to his feet, Jackson glances back, lips pulled 
      together in a devious smile. Because Isaac isn t getting up.

      Coach starts onto the field, but Scott hurries past, racing 
      to Isaac s side.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 211" BLUE 4/6/1234.

                                  ISAAC
                            (whispering)
                    It s not broken. But I can t move 
                    it. I think Jackson nicked me. I 
                    can feel it spreading.

      While other players crowd around, Scott glances back to the 
      sidelines at Gerard whose VOICE comes whispering into his 
      ear.

                                  GERARD
                    You want to play chess, Scott? Then 
                    you better be willing to sacrifice 
                    your own pawns.

      Scott notices Jackson watching as Isaac is pulled onto a 
      stretcher.

                                  COACH
                    McCall!

      He turns and just barely catches his helmet thrown to him by 
      Coach.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                    Either you re in or we forfeit.

      With a nod, Scott pulls the helmet on. And a moment later, 
      he s down at a face-off with the opposing player.

      The WHISTLE BLOWS and Scott charges for the ball.


      On her feet, Erica limps forward, trying to reach Boyd as 
      Allison aims an arrow at him.

                                  ERICA
                    Don t. Allison, please.

      Without a hint of emotion, Allison lets her fingers part, 
      releasing the arrow when--

      A GUN FIRES.

      The arrow lands harmlessly in the ground. Allison looks to 
      the bow in her hands, grazed by a particularly well-aimed 
      bullet.

      Lowering his gun, Argent approaches with two hunters behind 
      him. But Boyd grabs their attention again as he takes a step 
      forward.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 211" BLUE 4/6/1235.

      CONTINUED:3737

      Allison instantly has a tactical knife in her hand. But it 
      wasn t a step Boyd was taking. It was a stumble. Slowly, he 
      begins to fall as--


      Scott glances from the ball in the pocket of his lacrosse net 
      and then to the remarkably sized player known as the 
      Abomination racing toward him.

      Eyes barely having a second to widen in fear, Scott s feet 
      leave the ground. The ball bounces off into the grass. As 
      Scott goes down--


      Boyd hits the ground, a flurry of leaves and dust spinning up 
      around him.


      Grass and dirt kick up into the air as Stiles tumbles 
      painfully across the field, knocked down by an opposing 
      player.


      Erica slumps to her knees, clutching the wound in her leg 
      while--


      Pushing himself up off the ground, Scott glances to the 
      sidelines, trying to find Gerard.

                                  GERARD (V.O.)
                    Haven t you guessed what the real 
                    offer on the table is?

      Vision blurred, Scott blinks, halos of light bouncing in 
      front of his eyes while a pitiless Jackson gazes at him from 
      across the field.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 211" BLUE 4/6/1236.

                                  GERARD (V.O.)
                    It s Allison. It s always been 
                    Allison.

      Pulling himself to his feet, Scott looks about. 

                                  GERARD (V.O.)
                    You give me Derek. And I ll let you 
                    have Allison.

      But he can t seem to find Gerard anywhere. Then his eyes land 
      on the scoreboard. TEN MINUTES left. The clock continues to 
      count down.


      Allison drops her bow into the back of the ATV while Argent 
      approaches.

                                    ALLISON
                    You owe me a new bow.

                                  ARGENT
                    And you owe me an explanation.

                                    ALLISON
                    For what? I caught them. Me.

      She pulls out her PHONE to make a call, barely paying 
      attention to him.

                                  ARGENT
                    Caught came very close to kill. And 
                    that s not the way we do this.

                                    ALLISON
                    Maybe it s not the way you do it. I 
                    think my way worked out pretty 
                    well.

                                  ARGENT
                    Allison--

      But she holds up a finger as she presses the phone to her 
      ear.

                                    ALLISON
                          (into the phone)
                    Grandpa, it s me. We got our two 
                    runaways. Call us back.

      She hangs up and looks at Argent. But his eyes stay on the 
      phone in her hand.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 211" BLUE 4/6/1237.

                    you call him that.


      Minutes counting down on the clock, the ball flies loose from 
      the opposing team.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 211" BLUE 4/6/1239.

                    McCall!

      With the star player nowhere to be found, another hurtles in 
      toward the ball. Stiles. Snatching the ball from the ground, 
      he spins back.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                      Stilinski!

      He glances about for someone to pass to while Coach screams 
      at him from the sidelines.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                    Shoot it. Shoot the ball! Shoot it 
                    you idiot!

      IN THE BLEACHERS - A terrified Sheriff Stilinski watches 
      through his fingers.

                    Oh crap...

      Lydia begins to rise, hopeful.

                                  LYDIA
                    Shoot it.

      Then, with the crowd cheering, Coach screaming, and opposing 
      players hurtling toward him, Stiles turns and FIRES the ball 
      at the goal.

      The world goes quiet. For a brief second, all that can be 
      heard is the sound of a lacrosse ball hitting the net of a 
      goal.

      And then the world EXPLODES back to normal as the bleachers 
      erupt with CHEERING. Stilinski launches to his feet in 
      disbelief.

      Mouth hanging open, Stiles can t help but begin to smile.

                                  STILES
                    I scored a goal? I scored a goal. I 
                    scored a goal!


      Clock ticking down, Stiles has the ball again, racing for the 
      goal as Coach runs along the sidelines SCREAMING in support.

      And incredibly, Stiles shoots and SCORES AGAIN. The crowd 
      leaps up again, Stilinski hollering for his son in the 
      bleachers as--


      Rising in the stands, Lydia cheers for Stiles as he gallantly 
      scores another goal, sealing the win for Beacon Hills.


      World moving in a slow, dream-like quality, Stiles turns to 
      find Lydia watching him from the stands. Her gentle and 
      perfect smile now reserved for him. Finally, for him.

      The scoreboard reads Beacon Hills ahead by one. And only 
      THIRTY SECONDS LEFT.

      Scott hurries to the sidelines, eyes on the clock.               TEEN WOLF "Episode 211" BLUE 4/6/1242.

      He spots Jackson still on the field. Then loses him behind 
      the moving players.

      TEN SECONDS left. The Ref slowly raises the whistle to his 
      lips.

      TWO LACROSSE GLOVES fall to the grass. Jackson s hands now 
      exposed, CLAWS at the tips of his fingers, murder in his 
      eyes.

      Scott spins, trying to find Jackson or even his intended 
      target as--

      THE SCOREBOARD CLOCK hits ZERO and the crowd goes ballistic. 
      Stilinski jumps to his feet, yanking Melissa into a hug. On *
      the field, Stiles grins as his teammates rally around him,
