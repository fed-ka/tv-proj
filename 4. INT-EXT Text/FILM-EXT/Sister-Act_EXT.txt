Christine opens the girls' room door; she looks both ways.
No one is around; she saunters down the hall.
Page 2.
ANGLE ON A DOOR MARKED BROOM CLOSET
Christine opens this door.
She looks into the closet.
There is a very nervous thirteen-year-old BOY waiting for
her inside.
CHRISTINE
Hi, Jimmy.
Christine slips inside the closet and closes the door
behind her.
ANGLE ON SISTER IMMACULATA
Striding down the hall, with a bloodthirsty look in her
eye, and a nasty-looking wooden ruler in her hand.
She
flings open the broom closet door,
ANGLE ON CHRISTINE AND JIMMY
in the broom closet.
Jimmy's face is covered with
lipstick.
Christine's hair is awry.
The couple has
clearly been making out.
SISTER IMMACULATA
(outraged)
Miss Christine Carter!
Again!
Don't
you know what happens to girls like you?
Don't you know what they become?
ANGLE on various neon Vegas landmarks -- the Golden
Nugget, Caesar's Palace, Bally's, etc.
Scrunched in
between two larger hotels and casinos is the MOONLIGHT
HOTEL AND CASINO.
The Moonlight isn't all that small, it's
just seen better days.
Joey comes out of the hotel and finds an empty street.
He
looks in every direction, but the nearby streets have
swallowed Christy into safety for the moment.
The central offices of the Las Vegas Police Department.
Eddie and Bishop 0'Hara are leaving, by the convent's
front door.
As they exit, they hear the CHOIR, singing
horribly. They both wince at the sound, and then chuckle.
Vince leaves the police station with his henchmen, Joey
and Willy, and LARRY NARREN, an attorney.
Vince is
steaming as they walk through the parking lot.
VINCE
They grilled me for six hours in there.
And my hotshot lawyer -- where the hell
were you?
LARRY
It takes time, Vince.
Slow and steady.
We've been through this before.
Vince reaches his car.
As Joey opens the door for him,
another car drives by, and stops.
Eddie is driving; he
leans out the window.
EDDIE
So long, Vince.
See you soon.
Page 30.
Vince lurches toward Eddie; Larry restrains him.
Eddie
drives off, chuckling.
VINCE
He's so damn cocky.
This is different.
JOEY
It's a bluff, Vince.
VINCE
You know so much.
They've got Christy,
and we've got to find her.
Get her 8x10,
from in front of the lounge.
Fax it to
every contact we got.
Larry covers his ears with both hands.
LARRY
I can't hear this.
I'm an attorney,
Vince, and you're just an honest casino
owner.
Object of a witch hunt. Innocent
victim.
VINCE
Keep the message vague, but let 'em
know.
The price has gone up.
Christy
Van Cartier -- a quarter of a million.
Dead or nearby.
Vince looks grim and vindictive, as he gets into the car.
The vegetable patch is located behind the convent, on a
patch of land surrounded by high walls.
Various sections
have been partitioned with string and then furrowed.
Several nuns are working in the patch, weeding and raking.
They wear large, ungainly straw hats over their wimples.
Christy has been given a hoe and a straw hat.
She is
hacking at the dirt, with great disinterest.
She picks up
a carrot from the vegetable patch; she looks around to see
if anyone is watching.
She starts to gnaw on the carrot.
She becomes aware that someone is watching her.
She looks
up.
Sister Mary Robert is watching Christy eat the carrot,
breaking her fast.
Christy drops the carrot on the ground,
as if it burned her.
Mary Robert resumes hoeing in the
next furrow over.
Christy stares at Mary Robert, narrowing her eyes.
Christy looks around; all the other nuns are busy at their
tasks.
Christy decides that she will try and make Sister
Mary
Robert talk.
She picks up the carrot and tosses it
at Mary Robert.
Mary Robert jumps.
She waggles a finger
at Christy, scolding her.
Mary Robert resumes hoeing.
Page 31.
Christy is now determined.
She takes her hoe, and tiptoes
nearer to Mary Robert.
Very gently, she uses the handle of
the floe to lift Mary Robert's skirt, and gooses her.
Mary Robert vips, very loudly.
All the other nuns turn
and stare at Mary Robert, scolding her.
Christy waggles
her finger at Mary Robert, scolding her.
Christy, giggling to herself, resumes hoeing.
She sees
Mother Superior, standing at the end of the furrow.
Mother
Superior looks extremely grim; she has not missed anything.
LONG SHOT of the sun going down, ending the nuns' Vow of
Silence.
We hear Christy SCREAM, O.S.
The sun is just barely rising, as the convent BELL tolls.
All the nuns are proceeding, in their simple robes and
nightshirts, down the hallway.
Christy's door opens; she is still in her nightshirt, and
her hair is a mess.
CHRISTY
What?
Mary Robert, in her nightshirt, stands outside.
MARY ROBERT
Come on, we're late.
CHRISTY
What?
What time is it?
MARY ROBERT
It's after five.
We have to bathe.
CHRISTY
(groaning)
Five a.m.?
Detective Clarkson gets out of his car and hurries into
the police station.
The outer wall of the convent.
A door swings open, and
Christy sticks her head out.
She looks both ways, and
steps outside.
She beckons to Mary Robert, who appears
from behind her.
Mary Robert looks very wary.
Christy
pulls her along.
Christy and Mary Robert walk along a street a few blocks
from the convent.
MARY ROBERT
(looking around
cautiously)
Are you sure this is what Reverend
Mother had in mind?
Page 51.
CHRISTY
I know it is.
It's life.
Experience.
Take a deep breath.
Christy breathes deep, and then lets out a whoop.
She
spins, letting her habit billow around her.
MARY ROBERT
(shocked)
Mary Clarence!
CHRISTY
Now you.
Mary Robert's eyes widen.
She points to herself -- "Me?"
Christy nods.
Mary Robert lets out a tiny little whoop,
and does a little, timid hop.
CHRISTY
It's a start.
A neighborhood hang-out, the windows bright with neon beer
signs.
The exterior is colorfully painted; the club all
but explodes with good times.
A group of teenagers lounge
on the steps, sipping beers and smoking.
Among the
teenagers are the girls from Christy's Christian Youth
group.
Christy and Mary Robert approach, and the group
falls silent.
CHRISTY
How are you doing.
LAWANDA
(puzzled)
Hey, Sisters.
Are you going in there?
CHRISTY
You know it.
MARY ROBERT
We need experience.
CHRISTY
(remembering she's a
nun)
It's part of St. Katherine's new
community outreach program.
How old are
you?
You shouldn't be smoking.
Have you
ever seen a diseased lung?
Hand 'em
over.
Lawanda reluctantly hands over her cigarettes.
Christy
turns to a TEENAGE BOY who's drinking beer.
Page 52.
CHRISTY
And you, with the devil's brew passing
through your lips.
(holding out her hand)
A mind is a terrible thing to waste.
The boy hands over the beer.
Christy and Mary Robert
enter the club.
Christy and Mary Robert are walking back to the convent.
They are both in very good spirits.
MARY ROBERT
Those people are wonderful!
Why don't
we ever see them in church?
CHRISTY
Good point.
Especially that dude you
were with.
I'd like to see him down
front.
MARY ROBERT
(giggling)
Mary Clarence!
You're so... different
from the other sisters.
Sometimes,
well... sometimes you sound more like a
layperson.
CHRISTY
Honey.
As the two women laugh together, they don't notice the car
that begins to follow them, creeping slowly forward with
its headlights out.
Page 55.
MARY ROBERT
I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother
about all my experiences.
I've learned
so much.
CHRISTY
Well, you know, you don't have to tell
her everything.
I mean, nothing really
happened.
We just... took a walk.
The car's bright lights suddenly switch on, and the nuns
turn, startled.
The car hurtles toward them.
They scream,
and Christy grabs Mary Robert and throws her out of the
car's path; the two women land on a pile of garbage bags.
Struggling to her feet, Christy sees the car go into
reverse, and then pull forward again.
She sees a glint of
light reflect off a gun as the car's driver (Mike the
bartender) leans out the window.
CHRISTY
(to Mary Robert)
Run!
Christy shoves Mary Robert towards an alley.
As she does
so, the gun GOES OFF with a red flash.
The shot misses the
two women and SHATTERS a plate glass window of the store
behind them.
Running up the alley, Christy and Mary Robert hear Mike's
FOOTSTEPS chasing them, growing louder as he gains on them.
MARY ROBERT
Mary Clarence!
CHRISTY
Keep moving!
Christy grabs the ladder of a fire escape, and shoves Mary
Robert up the ladder ahead of her.
CHRISTY
Climb!
Now!
As Christy and Mary Robert climb the fire escape, another
GUNSHOT ECHOES in the alley, ricocheting off the fire
escape.
The nuns climb higher up the building.
Mike pursues,
looking for a shot between the steps and the landings, but
not finding any openings.
He takes the steps two at a time
and begins to gain ground.
At the fourth floor landing, Christy's heel gets stuck in
the grating.
She pulls frantically at the laces.
Page 56.
CHRISTY
Goddamn it!
MARY ROBERT
Mary Clarence!
Mike arrives at the landing just as Christy twists her
toot out of the shoe, and surprises him with a lunge for
the gun.
Mike's hand is knocked back against the metal
frame of the fire escape, and the gun flies loose, RATTLING
down the metal steps to the landing below.
Christy shoves
Mary Robert into the open window of an apartment, and
follows her in.
Christy and Mary Robert run up to the side door of the
convent; they catch their breath.
MARY ROBERT
What was all that?
Who was that man?
Why would he shoot at us?
CHRISTY
I don't know, some people just don't
like nuns.
I wish I had a ruler.
MARY ROBERT
We could have been killed!
But you
saved me!
(throwing her arms
around Christy)
Thank you, Mary Clarence!
The door to the convent swings open.
Mother Superior is
waiting.
MOTHER SUPERIOR
Yes -- thank you so much.
Page 57
Lawanda and her friends glance at the convent with
curiosity as the beautiful MUSIC drifts out to the street.
A few other heads turn, but with only mild reactions.
The gorgeous, exciting MUSIC pours into the street.
Everyone turns to look.
Windows open and people glance
out. The street takes on a new movement.
The nuns are out in force, painting the walls of the
convent, mostly with rainbows and flowers and bright,
shining suns.
The CAMERA PANS to Christy, who is adding
her own original touch to the mural, using cans of spray
paint.
Christy's section includes an image of a nun in a
miniskirt and spike heels, accompanied by neon letters that
read "St. Kate!"
People gather in the street, watching the
nuns' activities.
The convent begins to crackle with
energy and life.
A drug deal is going on in a house up the street, but the
DEALERS give only a curious glance to the action at the
convent.
Christy leads the members of the choir down the middle of
the street.
They get lots of attention each step of the
way.
As each nun raps, the other nuns make rhythmic boom-
box noises.
CHRISTY
(rapping)
WE'RE THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART WE
DO OUR BIT, NOW DO YOUR PART
MARY ROBERT
(rapping)
HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO
DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR
YOU
MARY PATRICK
(rapping)
BELIEVE IN THE LORD, HIS WILL BE DONE
COME TO CHURCH, IT'S TONS OF FUN
Page 74.
MARY LAZARUS
(rapping)
DIG DOWN DEEP, GIVE ALL YOU CAN
TRUST ME, CHILDREN, THERE'S A HEAVENLY
PLAN!
The parade goes on, the crowd gathers, and a general air
of jubilance prevails.
One of the drug dealers stands outside the crack house as
a car suddenly pulls up to the curb.
He starts toward the
car as the DRIVER rolls down the window, but before he gets
there, Christy and several nuns surround the car.
Page 75.
CHRISTY
We're here to pray for you, brother.
DEALER
What?
Get the hell out of here.
CHRISTY
We know you don't want to sell drugs.
You just had an unhappy childhood, and
maybe a learning disability.
You just
need someone to pray for you.
MARY PATRICK
We know you don't want to bring pain and
misery to your friends and neighbors.
We'll pray to find you some honest work.
CHRISTY
And we know that, even though most
people would call you a leech and a
parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We
know that deep down inside, you're
probably even worse.
And so you truly
need our prayers.
DRIVER
What is this?
Outta my way!
The nuns give him room, and the Driver zips off down the
street.
A small crowd has begun to gather, and it is
growing by the moment, murmuring encouragement for the
nuns.
Christy turns to the Dealer, as other cars drive
slowly past.
CHRISTY
Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers
free
We're going to give free prayers to
everyone who drives up to this house.
MARY ROBERT
(to the Dealer)
We're nuns!
MARY PATRICK
(to cruising cars)
Free prayers right over here!
Drive up
and get your prayers!
DEALER
You're hassling my customers!
That's
not legal!
I know my rights.
This is
restriction of trade.
CHRISTY
You wanna call a cop?
Page 76.
The Dealer's eyes turn ugly as he takes a gun from his
pocket.
Mary Patrick steps forward.
MARY PATRICK
Are you going to shoot us all, tough
guy?
MARY LAZARUS
Is it worth it?
A lot of witnesses
here.
CHRISTY
(to the crowd)
Can I get a witness?
The Dealer glances at the surly crowd, then gives the nuns
a disgusted look.
He puts the gun away.
DEALER
So I'll find another neighborhood to do
my business.
You can' t stop me.
CHRISTY
If we can stop you here, they can stop
you there.
The Dealer turns and walks back to his house with anger.
The crowd APPLAUDS and CHEERS.
The picture suddenly becomes GRAINY, and we hear the voice
of a NEWS REPORTER.
NEWS REPORTER (V.0.)
It was a truly remarkable scene, as the
nuns from St. Katherine's literally drove
the crack dealers from the neighborhood,
led by the feisty Sister Mary Clarence.
CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see a TV screen with an image of
the nuns and neighbors still celebrating.
On top of the TV
are several framed photographs of Vince Laflocca, his wife
and children.
The Sunday morning bell is CHIMING as crowds of people
stream into the convent.
The entire neighborhood looks
cleaner, and the people walk with a spring in their step.
Three local TV stations have remote news crews on the scene
doing follow-ups on the story.
Church services are over, and happy people stream out of
the convent, but they don't hurry home.
Standing in
groups, they talk pleasantly and make plans for the day.
There is a real sense of neighborhood up and down the
block.
Eddie comes down the steps, glances back at the convent,
smiles to himself, then crosses the street to his car.
Page 82.
The moon casts shafts of silver light down to the
courtyard of the convent.
Most of the lights in the
neighborhood are out at this late hour.
CHRISTY'S VOICE
(whispering)
Come on... I've got a surprise...
Eddie's police car streaks past an entrance ramp with the
SIREN screaming.
It blazes through traffic, weaving in and
out at breakneck speeds.
A moment later, Joey and Willy
pull onto the highway at a fast rate.
The race is on, with
Eddie securely in the lead.
Eddie's police car streaks toward L.A.
Page 91.
The neighborhood has turned out to see the choir off.
Banners hang from the fire escapes of the building across
the street:
"ST. KATE'S - THE GREATEST!", "GOOD LUCK
TONIGHT!"
A Catholic school bus pulls up to the convent and parks in
front.
Several nuns in choir robes come outside and hurry
onto the bus.
A moment later, Eddie's police car streaks
up to the side entrance of the convent, parking around the
corner from the bus.
Eddie's police car streaks through crowded streets.
Joey and Willy park their car in front of the convent, get
out quickly and climb the steps to the front door.
They
ring the bell.
JOEY
So that guy in the bar was right?
She's
like... some kind of nun?
WILLY
Yeah, right -- when I see it.
Lawanda and her friends watch Joey and Willy pounding on
the convent door.
LAWANDA
You dudes looking for nuns?
They all
went to St. Matthew's.
JOEY
St, Matthew's?
Thanks.
LAWANDA
Praise the Lord.
Joey and Willy run past the girls, get into their car and
take off.
Christy looks through the grimy window of the gas station
office.
A bored Mechanic is watching a small portable TV.
On the TV is an episode of "THE FLYING NUN":
Sally Field,
in full habit, is soaring along.
Suddenly, Christy hears the loud ROAR of a motorcycle
starting up over by one of the gas pumps.
The BIKER turns
and looks at Christy:
he has long hair, and a beard and
moustache, and he looks, well, a bit like Jesus.
CHRISTY
Oh my God...
Christy runs up to the Biker..
CHRISTY
I'm late for church.
Can I get a lift?
Page 96.
Christy swings onto the back seat; the Biker puts his
Harley in gear and flies down the street.
Eddie is shocked
as he drops some money on the ground and jumps into his car
to follow.
We see a network truck parked in front of the landmark
cathedral.
The motorcycle flies through the streets, breaking every
traffic law on the books.
Christy's robe flaps behind her
in the wind, and she has a wide smile as she rides.
As
passersby stare at her, she holds out two fingers and
blesses them.
Mary Robert stands alone in front of the cathedral,
wringing her hands with worry.
Suddenly, her face
brightens like the dawn as she sees Christy ride up.
MARY ROBERT
You're here!
Thank goodness!
Joey and Willy wrestle the two nuns to the open door of
their car.
They shove Christy and Mary Robert into the
back seat, and Willy climbs in next to them.
WILLY
Go!
Joey starts the car, and it takes off with SQUEALING
tires.
Willy has his gun pointed at Christy, who sits
beside Mary Robert.
MARY ROBERT
But what do they want?
Where are we
going?
CHRISTY
(to Joey and Willy)
She's got nothing to do with this.
Let
her go.
JOEY
Yeah, right to the cops.
No way.
CHRISTY
Mary Robert, don't panic.
Remember what
we talked about?
Experience?
JOEY
What?
CHRISTY
(quickly, to Mary
Robert)
You can handle this.
The car comes to a stop at an intersection.
Christy
reaches across Mary Robert and opens the car door.
She
shoves Mary Robert into the street.
CHRISTY
Go!
Mary Robert executes a perfect somersault onto the
sidewalk.
She looks to heaven, crosses herself and runs
back to the cathedral.
Willy grabs Christy before she can escape.
JOEY
She's gettin' away!
WILLY
Forget her!
We got the one we need!
Step on it!
Joey takes off again.
Page 99.
Eddie's car is tied up in traffic, but he turns on his
blinker lights and peels over to the opposite lane.
Cars
stop to let him through.
The Driver sits at the wheel of the school bus, reading a
sleazy novel.
He looks up as the nuns all converge on the
door.
Page 101
MOTHER SUPERIOR
Emergency!
Open up!
The Driver opens the door.
MOTHER SUPERIOR
The San Francisco airport!
Immediately!
The nuns are all zooming past the Driver, onto the bus.
MARY LAZARUS
(to the Driver)
Step on it!
Mary Lazarus grabs the Driver's sleazy novel, confiscating
it. The Driver starts the engine.
As the bus drives off,
Eddie's car streaks INTO THE SCENE and parks in front of
the cathedral.
Several small planes are parked on the tarmac.
Mother Superior and the nuns are arguing with the MANAGER
of the airport, a grouchy guy in grease-stained overalls.
MANAGER
Fifteen hundred for the run to Vegas.
Rock-bottom.
MARY PATRICK
But we don't have fifteen hundred!
MARY ROBERT
We're nuns!
The Manager starts back toward his office.
MANAGER
Can't help you.
No exceptions.
MOTHER SUPERIOR
Young man!
Page 102.
The voice has a powerful ring of authority to it, and the
Manager looks around.
MANAGER
What?
MOTHER SUPERIOR
We are nuns.
We pray.
MANAGER
So?
MOTHER SUPERIOR
We pray for good things.
Food for the
hungry.
MARY PATRICK
Peace on Earth.
MOTHER SUPERIOR
However, we can also pray for other
things.
MARY PATRICK
Measles.
MARY ROBERT
Lawsuits.
MARY LAZARUS
Tax audits.
There is a pause, as the Manager stares at the nuns in
horror.
MOTHER SUPERIOR
Come, Sisters.
Let's go to chapel.
Bring your beads.
The nuns begin to leave.
MANAGER
Wait!
A plane sweeps through the desert sky, headed for Las
Vegas.
Through the windows of the plane, we see nuns
staring out at the glittering city in the distance.
The nuns leave the terminal and stand on the sidewalk out
front.
MARY ROBERT
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
MOTHER SUPERIOR
But where?
MARY PATRICK
Look!
There she is!
Mary Patrick is pointing to a group of billboards that
feature huge ads for the local hotels and casinos.
The
center billboard has a splashy picture of a roulette wheel,
the Elvis impersonator, and Christy and the Ronelles.
The
bottom part of the billboard shows the name of the
Moonlight Casino and Lounge.
MARY ROBERT
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
MARY PATRICK
But how do we get there?
Page 107.
MOTHER SUPERIOR
Stand back.
(she strides into the
road)
Taxi!
Eddie strides out of the airport; he took a later flight
than the nuns.
A squad car is waiting; Clarkson beckons
him.
CLARKSON
Lieutenant!
Eddie jumps in the car.
Clarkson turns on the red bubble
light and the SIREN, and the car zooms off.
Three cabs ROAR up in front of the building and nuns
tumble out.
Eddie drives up in the squad car and parks near the back
door.
EDDIE
(to Clarkson)
Close off the block, but don't move in
till I tell you.
Eddie jumps out of the car and hurries inside.
People are pouring into the cathedral.
Among them we see
many Cardinals in their red uniforms.
