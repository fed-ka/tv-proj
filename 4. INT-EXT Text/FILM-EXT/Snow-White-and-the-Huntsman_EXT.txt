From high above we see the castle gardens covered in a blanket
of snow. We hear the tread of footsteps then see a beautiful
WOMAN in a fur-lined cloak heading towards an unseen object.
ERIC (V.0.)
Once upon a time, in deep winter, a Queen
was admiring the falling snow when she saw
a rose blooming in defiance of the cold.
The rose looks miraculously red. Nearby, a RAVEN looks on. The
Queen gazes at the flower, then bends down.
ERIC (V.0.)
Reaching for it, she pricked her finger and
three drops of blood fell.
BOOM -- with the impact of an artillery shell, a DROP OF BLOOD
lands in the snow. Followed by ANOTHER. And ANOTHER.
The Queen startles, then calmly touches her stomach.
ERIC (V.0.)
And because the red seemed so alive against
the white, she thought, if only I had a
child as white as snow, lips as red as
blood, hair as black as a raven's wings and
all with the strength of that rose.
A beat, then we hear the piercing cry of a new-born baby --
A wounded MAGPIE is twitching in a puddle of water. SNOW WHITE,
aged 7 now, steps towards it hesitantly, looking concerned.

YOUNG SNOW WHITE
Pick it up, William.
Her companion, William, also 7, braces himself, reaches down,
then steps back in alarm as the bird starts flapping wildly. He
tries to cover his embarrassment by sounding knowledgeable.
YOUNG WILLIAM
It's dying. It doesn't want to be touched.
Snow White ignores him, approaching the bird herself. She kneels
down, hesitates, then reaches out and strokes the magpie,
calming its flapping before she picks it up.
High up on a tree, ANOTHER MAGPIE looks on.
SNOW WHITE runs, cupping the wounded bird in her hand, William
dashing after her. The sun is out and the fields and forests are
lit up in all their glory. The children sprint through a
BEAUTIFUL SEASIDE VILLAGE -- thatched homes with flower gardens,
HAPPY FARMERS and FAIR VILLAGE MAIDENS --
YOUNG SNOW WHITE
Hurry, William! Hurry!
They run down the dunes, waves crashing, the sand gleaming in
the sunlight, until they see the BEAUTIFUL CASTLE up ahead --
A single apple tree stands in the middle of the cloisters. It
stands out. Snow White and William dash past it into the castle.
6 OMITTED 6
Snow White and William, with a small toy bow strapped to his
back, climb the branches of the apple tree in the cloister
gardens. William picks a DISTINCTIVE RED AND WHITE APPLE and
offers it to Snow White.
He makes a point of the offer, holding it out, nodding.
Just as she comes to take it he pulls it away and takes a
huge bite himself, grinning. Snow White shoves him off the
tree and they fall to the ground.
And now we PULL BACK to reveal the King and William's father,
DUKE HAMMOND, watching from the throne room balcony.
KING MAGNUS
My daughter will need your son's friendship
more than ever, Duke Hammond. As will I
yours.
DUKE HAMMOND
We are here to serve you, your Majesty.
As the King watches his daughter, ERIC'S VOICEOVER resumes:
ERIC (V.0)
The next winter was the harshest in memory
and Snow White's mother passed away.
The garden is covered in snow but there is no red rose now. King
Magnus walks with his arm around Snow white, heartbroken.
A single tear rolls down Snow White's cheek. Palace onlookers
and mourners, fixed on her face, feeling what she feels, move
aside.
ERIC (V.0)
A year went by but the King was
inconsolable. Taking advantage of his
grief, dark forces gathered on the
kingdom's borders.

9 OMITTED 9
From above we see horses movie through the forest and enter a
clearing. At the head is --
King Magnus, with Duke Hammond by his side, surrounded by a
line of the King's Army. They are frozen as they look at--
Across the battlefield - Horsemen in a line. THE RIDERS are
silhouetted on a misty plain -- a VAST SHADOW ARMY of faceless
warriors.
King Magnus and the Duke trade a look -
DUKE HAMMOND
From what hell comes this army?
KING MAGNUS
A hell they'll soon revisit!
King Magnus SCREAMS A BLOOD CRY, kicks his horse and rides
forward with blind courage, no longer caring what happens to
him.
The two lines of warriors race, pell-mell to the center of
the battlefield. When they meet --
Hand to hand combat at its most brutal.
King Magnus swings his great sword, and a SHADOW WARRIOR
SHATTERS LIKE GLASS.
All down the line the same is happening - Shadow Warriors
shattering, evaporating.
Strange.
DUKE HAMMOND shatters an opponent as well and as loud and
furious as the battlefield was only moments before, it is now
that quiet.
The King and the Duke watch in amazement as the rest of the
SHADOW ARMY melts away, DISSOLVING INTO THE MORNING MIST until
all that is left in the field is --
ERIC (V.0.)
The unholy army was defeated, leaving
King Magnus with the spoils of victory.
A CAGED PRISON WAGON. Odd. Not even sure how it got there.
King Magnus moves toward it, with a little trepidation. When
he's close he gets off his horse, walks closer and dares to
look inside.
(CONTINUED)

10 CONTINUED: 10
Inside the cage, a WOMAN COWERS, her face hidden behind a veil.
King Magnus stares at her through the prison bars, then with a
mighty blow of his sword shatters the lock and enters.
KING MAGNUS
You are now free. You have nothing to fear
from me.
Duke Hammond watches from outside the cage, a bit wary, as the
King kneels beside the terrified woman.
KING MAGNUS
What is your name, my lady?
Slowly, the woman turns. For a moment the King wonders if it's
his beloved Queen behind the veil. Gently, he lifts her veil.
It's not his wife, but the most beautiful woman he's ever seen.
RAVENNA
My name is Ravenna, sire.
The King is speechless now, gazing upon the face of an angel.
ERIC (V.0.)
So struck by her beauty was the King, that
he forgot, for the first time, his broken
heart.
His gaze is so intense that Ravenna looks down for a moment.
When she lifts her head --
CUT TO:
A little boy, FINN, runs as fast as he can through the snow
toward the Gypsy Camp.
Behind him, THE KING'S RIDERS advance on the camp.
BACK INSIDE THE WAGON
Ravenna's mother tries to keep her daughter's attention --

10b CONTINUED: 10b
RAVENNA'S MOTHER
Ravenna!
Several Guards line the hallway. The door opens and Ravenna
emerges. As she moves past them...
RAVENNA
The King has laid down his sword for the
night.
Their eyes take her, lustfully, in as she strides away and
disappears around a corner.
CUT TO:

Ravenna exits the castle and crosses the courtyard with a
lantern. A portcullis opens and DARK FIGURES emerge from the
shadows, entering the castle. Leading them is a tall pale-eyed
warrior (FINN). He looks at Ravenna devotedly.
RAVENNA
Welcome, brother.
The chaos has spread to the courtyard, DUKE HAMMOND'S KNIGHTS
struggling to hold back the invaders. Snow White hurries out,
dazed by the sight of battle, then sees William pull free of his
father's guards and run towards her --
William grabs her protectively when strong arms reach down and
lift them both onto the back of separate horses. Duke Hammond
and his personal guard are attempting to ride out of the castle
before the portcullis closes.
The Duke rides under the portcullis with William. His bodyguard
is about to follow when an ARROW FROM FINN STRIKES HIM IN THE
BACK and both he and Snow White are thrown off their horse.
YOUNG WILLIAM
Father! The Princess!
But the portcullis is down, separating Snow White and William.
The last thing he sees is Snow White struggling in Finn's arms,
being hauled back into the castle.
Young Ravenna's SCREAM as she is ripped from her mother's
arms. Finn throws himself into the mix but is backhanded to
the ground. Ravenna's mother moves forward, ready to attack.
The Guard holding Ravenna pulls a dagger and puts it to
Ravenna's throat, which stops her mother.
Ravenna is dragged away and tossed on the back of a horse --
RAVENNA'S MOTHER
But be warned Ravenna: By fairest blood
it is done and only by fairest blood can
it be undone.
Ravenna looks back to see her mother and other gypsies put to
the sword.
Finn struggles free and chases after the King's men as they
gallop away.
CUT TO:
All the wedding guests and nobles stand, held there by guards
with swords and daggers.
Ravenna stands at the top of the stairs.
RAVENNA
So kind of you all to stay over.
GENERAL
What shall we do with these?
She eyes the noblemen and guests from left to right. Their
eyes beg for mercy.
There is none.
RAVENNA
To the sword.
(CONTINUED)
12
20b CONTINUED: 20b
There are GASPS and SCREAMS as the Guards move the guests
away.
Ravenna notices Finn, off to one side, his dagger at the neck
of Snow White, who stares defiantly at Ravenna.
RAVENNA
Finn!
Finn stops his exit with Snow White, and turns. Ravenna
stares at the little girl, not sure where she stands with
this one. And then,...
RAVENNA
Lock her away. One never knows when royal
blood may be of value.
21 OVER A TIME-LAPSE IMAGE OFA ROTTING RED AND WHITE APPLE. WE 21
HEAR ERIC'S VOICEOVER AGAIN --
ERIC (V.0.)
The spell Ravenna's mother placed on her
gave her the ability to steal youth and
beauty, and indeed all things good, for
her own evil purposes. But for every
life there must be a death, for every
gain, loss, and under the reign of
Ravenna nature turned on itself and
people turned on each other.
A chill wind whips through the woods. Lying sprawled on the
ground we see a man (ERIC) who looks like he's dead.
(CONTINUED)
13
22 CONTINUED: 22
It's only as we move closer to his rugged face that we see the
empty FLAGON OF GROG by his side and realize he's drunk. His
eyes flicker, as a WOMAN'S SCREAM cuts through the woods.
FLASH TO:
THE SPECTRE OF A WOMAN
SARA, beautiful, in pain. A patch of blood blossoms on her
dress. Her mouth is open, screaming but no sound comes out.
BACK TO SCENE - WE HEAR THE SCREAM
Eric's eyes flicker and begin to open -- then he hears it
again.
ROSE (O.S.)
Help!!!!
He rises to his feet unsteadily, his head pounding from a
hangover, then grabs two THROWING HATCHETS and slides them into
his harness on his back --
23-240MITTED 23-24
Eric runs past trees and ducks under branches, crashing into a
few, still drunk. As he arrives at a clearing he sees a
beautiful girl, (ROSE), fighting off a HUGE TATTOOED WARRIOR,
(BROCH).
ERIC
Lay a hand on her and I'll take your head!
BROCH turns and sees the huntsman with his hatchet raised.
BROCH
Ale given you courage again, huntsman?
ERIC
Won't take much courage to split your skull
from here.
BROCH
Aye, but first you'd have to see straight.
Broch advances with a grin, drawing his own axe. Trying to clear
his vision and steady his aim, Eric hurls the hatchet -- and
MISSES, the blade sticking in the tree above the frightened
Greta's head --
Broch is on Eric in an instant, swinging his huge battle axe.
Eric narrowly avoids the deadly blows, his natural skill and
dexterity slowed down by all the ale he's drunk.
(CONTINUED)
13A
25 CONTINUED: 25
Rose looks on, terrified, as Broch drives Eric towards the
trees. He corners him against an oak and swings his axe -- only
for Eric to duck at the last moment --
The blade buries itself deep in the tree, stuck. We realize now
from Eric's dark smile that he lured Broch into the trap. He
draws his second hatchet, but instead of using the blade, cracks
Broch over the head with the handle, knocking him out.
Rose looks on in admiration as the huntsman goes through Broch's
pockets.
(CONTINUED)
14
25 CONTINUED: (2) 25
ROSE
Thank you.
Eric turns. Rose sees how handsome he is. Eric stares at her
thoughtfully then approaches and gently lifts her chin,
examining her pretty features. Rose doesn't seem to mind,
looking back with an inviting smile.
ROSE
I don't know how to repay you?
Eric stares at her a moment, then suddenly picks her up and
tosses her over his shoulders.
ERIC
Don't worry, somebody else will.
26 OMITTED 26
And now we see a RICKETY PRISON WAGON full of BEAUTIFUL GIRLS,
just like Rose, staring out furiously from behind bars. Eric and
a SLAVE MERCHANT haggle over Rose who is bound and gagged,
looking just as furious as the other women.
SLAVE MERCHANT
Her nose is on the large size and her
chin's a little weak.
ERIC
Your eyes are dim.
SLAVE MERCHANT
I'll give you two gold pieces.
ERIC
After all the business we've done
together?
Rose curses behind her gag as Eric pulls her away.
SLAVE MERCHANT
Four gold pieces and that's my final offer!
Eric doesn't even bother to turn around.
ERIC
I'll peddle my wares elsewhere, thank
you.
The slave merchant sees his prize disappearing and calls out:
SLAVE MERCHANT
Ten gold pieces!
Eric hesitates, but it's not from a guilty conscience, he's just
considering the price. Then he smiles, turns. They have a deal.
14A
SNOW WHITE BURSTS OUTSIDE -- into the light. She almost
hyperventilates at all the air, the sky. Then she runs through
the courtyard toward the portcullis.
The magpies fly right into her face then away, telling her to
follow. She does and heads straight for the small opening at
the base of the castle wall - the entrance to the SEWERS.
As the magpies rise, she slides on one hip, plunging into the
darkness below. The guards follow but can't squeeze through
the opening, running towards the Portcullis instead.
The old rebel, Thomas, with his son's body draped over a mule,
looks back curiously as he hears the guards yelling --
CHIEF GUARD 0/S
Open the gates! The Princess has escaped!
He stares in surprise as riders gallop out.
Snow White is swept out of the sewers into the sea. Seaweed
wraps itself around her limbs, pulling her deeper.into the
depths, but she kicks and fights her way back to the surface --
gasping for air.
24
Snow White swims ashore. She looks up and sees a maze of large
rocks stretching out. She sets off in one direction when the two
MAGPIES reappear, urging her to follow them in another
direction. She scrambles after them and sees a WHITE MARE
waiting for her on the beach, lying on its side, allowing her to
climb on. The mare raises itself and is away in a flash.
Galloping hooves skim the surf, RIDERS pursuing Snow White.
Snow White rides towards the village -- only it's unrecognizable
now -- most of the cottages have been razed to the ground or
boarded up.
A group of people including children - skeletal, hungry,
desperate - see her approach and move out to greet her.
She stops her horse for a moment, gazing past tears at the
devastation and the state of villagers all around her.
At first their approach seems harmless but as they get closer
their faces reveal dangerous desperation and --
She gallops off, looking back to see the Queen's men giving
chase.
The fields and woods are even more devastated than the village.
Farmland has been burnt to cinders and trees chopped down. All
around Snow White the world is stubble and ash.
Snow White crests a hill, her mare rearing as she sees -- THE
DARK FOREST -- A VAST WALL OF PRIMORDIAL TREES. A mist seeps
from the forest like an evil miasma. Snow white hesitates --
then sees the riders closing in and urges her mare on --
Shadows everywhere. The mare charges into the misty bog then
suddenly loses her footing. She rears -- throwing Snow White
onto the safety of solid ground.
Snow White tries to grab her reins but the horse pulls away, not
wanting to endanger her life. She tries again but the horse
backs farther away from her. Slowly they're separated by the
swirling fog --
As Snow White sees the silhouettes of the riders reappear.
Reluctantly she turns and runs into the forest --
(CONTINUED)
25
50 CONTINUED: 50
The riders are about to follow when their horses rear and kick
in terror. One guard is thrown off and sucked down in the bog,
frightening off the others.
Despite their concern for Snow White, the MAGPIES are also too
afraid to enter the forest.
Snow White hurtles through the trees, a ghostly fog rising up
all around her, then trips over a root, landing face first in --
A patch of LARGE MUSHROOMS that unleash CLOUDS OF POLLEN. She
coughs, trying to fan the pollen away, but it's too late. She
hurries on, but the hallucinations come thick and fast now --
The trees look almost human, hooded figures peering at her
through the haze. She sees owls without eyes. Black oil oozing
out of tree trunks. A hanging vine reaches down and touches her
like a hand and now she runs --
More terrors rage at her from the swirling mist. She stumbles
again and when she looks up vampire bats scream at her from the
trees. Huge skeletal forms crack out of the bark, descending on
her until she finally passes out.
From high above, we see the unconscious Snow White as mist
whirls in a circle.
Vicious waves crash into rocks. Nature's anger on display.
Finn speaks to a group of people assembled by his men.
FINN
The Queen demands the services of someone
to navigate the Dark Forest.
The villagers stay mum, shaking their heads.

OLD LADY
No-one goes into the Dark Forest.
FINN
You will be compensated.
Still no takers. An OLD-TIMER stares right at FINN, steps
forwards.
OLD-TIMER
There's one man. A widower.
FINN
Where might I find him.
OLD-TIMER
In the Inn. Drinking.
THE SOUND OF SMASHING WOOD. They turn to see --
Eric flies through the Inn's wall and lands in a heap on the
ground.
OLD-TIMER
Appears he's finished.
Eric. Drunk. He tries to focus as Broch strides through the
same hole and stands over him.
(CONTINUED)

55 CONTINUED: 55
BROCH
You owe me money from my pocket and money
for the girl!
ERIC
I have it right here in my pocket. If
you'll just help me up.
Eric holds his hand out. Broch walks over, suspicious. When
he's close, Eric grabs his arm and kicks with both feet in
Broch's chest. Broch flies back, then strides to Eric and
kicks him in the side. Hurts.
BROCH
I want my money!
ERIC
Actually, I seem to have drunk it all.
You're welcome to it when it comes out
again.
Broch hauls him back up to his feet. He takes a swing but
somehow the drunken Eric dodges the blow, swinging back at
him.
Everyone has come out of the Inn to enjoy the fight.
Eric lands a body blow to Broch, who doubles over. Eric
comes in for the kill, winds up and swings -
Missing Broch but hitting a HORSE on the ass. It kicks its
legs, sending him flying. He lands in a heap and drops his
head back.
Hands lift him and --
Drop him in a horse trough. He's underwater for a few
seconds before he comes to and lifts out his head, eyes still
closed.
ERIC
(MUMBLING DRUNKENLY)
Perfume?
He opens his eyes to see Finn gazing down at him.
ERIC
Royalty. That explains it.
FINN
The Queen demands your presence.
ERIC
Can't you see I'm having a bath?
56 OMITTED 56

Mist drifts across the moors, the primordial trees looming up
ahead. Finn and Eric ride side by side, FOUR GUARDS following.

FINN
You fought in the west? Against the armies
of the five kings?
Eric nods without looking at him, gazing at the forest.
FINN
You must have seen a great deal of death?
ERIC
Death is everywhere.
FINN
Come now, you're being modest. There is a
difference between gutting a deer and
gutting a man. How many did you kill?
ERIC
It's not something I counted.
FINN
(with a smile)
Nor I. But I recall every face. There is
no greater delight than battle.
Eric finds this unseemly, but prefers not to engage.
FINN
Come now, huntsman, what do you feel when
you watch a man die? Delight?
Invincibility?
ERIC
(HONESTLY)
Sorrow.
This takes Finn aback, not an answer he was expecting. After
a beat...
FINN
And what of them? At the tip of your
sword. What do they feel? I'd enjoy
knowing.
Eric looks at him, realizing from Finn's face that it is an
honest question. -
FINN
The.only difference between you and I is
I'-never found a wife to save my soul.
ERIC
Too bad. You'll need one.
He stops his horse and nods.
(CONTINUED)
31
59 CONTINUED: (2) 59
They are all stopped at the entrance to the Dark Forest fifty
meters ahead. The Guards gulp back their fears. Finn tries
to hide his own.
Even the horses sense danger and start to whinny and back up.
Vines and roots have grown over Snow White's body, as if the
forest is trying to devour her. She opens her eyes, sees her
wrists and ankles bound and reacts in horror, struggling to free
herself of her bonds.
WE PULL UP, UP, UP until we can see the full scope of the
Dark Forest.
Eric and Finn have tethered their nervous horses and stand at
the entrance to the bog.
ERIC
Do exactly as I do.
Eric carefully places one foot after the next on grassy stepping
stones that disappear into the bog as soon as his full weight is
on them. The others catch on and follow, stepping on stones of
their own.
Once they're across the bog and onto dry land Finn takes a
step forward but Eric grabs his arm.
ERIC
Exactly as I do.
Eric puts a cloth to his face, gesturing for Finn and his guards
to do the same and moves forward through the mushroom field -
pops of pollen misting all around them.
Eric stops, bends down, spotting faint FOOTPRINTS in the dew. He
walks faster now, Finn watching in admiration.
62-63OMITTED 62-63
Snow White finally shakes free of the vines, jumps up and senses
she's being followed. She looks up at the trees but all she sees
are vague shadows. The wind picks up, ghostly voices howling in
the breeze. She's rooted to the spot for a moment, then loses
her nerve and runs --
Eric, Finn and the Guards move through a dark copse of trees.
VOICES AND WHISPERS-call to them from the wind. Eric stops,
looks around.
(CONTINUED)
32
64a CONTINUED: 64a
ERIC
Pay them no mind.
One of the Guards leans over a pool of water to drink when he
sees a GHOSTLY REFLECTION gazing back at him. He stares in
surprise, leaning closer. Suddenly a BARBED TAIL shoots out
of the water -- skewering him -- and drags him into the
depths.
The others turn as they hear a scream but there's no sign of
their companion now, just the bubbling water.
Only Finn looks unconcerned.
Eric stops senses something, holds up a hand.
Then darts ahead, leaving them flat-footed. Finn makes a
decision to follow and waves for his Guards to go ahead of
him.
They reluctantly follow Eric.
Eric moves quickly then stops, listens - we see his hunting
skills - as he hears the noise of cracking branches in the
distance, he blasts away, moving like lightning.
Snow White feels like the whole forest is pursuing her. Running
out of breath, she hides in some bushes. As she stares into the
mist, she sees a sinister figure appear through the haze.
Eric stops and looks around, sensing his prey is close. Snow
White stays low, trying to quieten her breathing.
Eric studies the forest floor. He sees Snow White's footprints,
then looks up at an area of disturbed undergrowth.
Snow White peers through the bushes and sees the huntsman's
boots approaching. She looks around for something to defend
herself with when the sound of the footsteps fades. She can't
see anyone now. She looks relieved when SUDDENLY STRONG HANDS
GRAB HER BY THE FEET AND DRAG HER OUT OF THE BUSHES.
She fights to get away but he pins her with a foot, reaches
down and turns her over.
His first look at her gives him pause. Her face, her spirit,
her youth. She slaps at him - he pulls out his knife with
one hand while he pins her with the other.
Then grabs, lifts her.
SNOW WHITE
Let me go!

She bites him. He grimaces and grabs her tighter and starts
trudging back.
SNOW WHITE

He ignores, keeps moving.
ERIC
Sure she is.
SNOW WHITE
Believe me! Her brother tried to cut out
my heart.
He stops, looks at her.
SNOW WHITE
I swear it.
He somehow believes her. New game. Then...

FINN (O.S.)
Quick work!
Eric looks up to see Finn and his men approaching. Snow White
gasps at the sight of Finn.
SNOW WHITE
Him! He's the one! He came at me with a
knife!
Eric holds her tight, one arm around her neck.
FINN
Well done, huntsman. Hand her over.
SNOW WHITE
You can't trust him!
ERIC
What do you intend to do with her?
FINN
Why do you care?
Finn nods and the Guards approach. Eric grips her tighter.
ERIC
(TO FINN)
You want her. Give me what I was
promised.
FINN
Come now huntsman, you did your job well.
Keep your word and hand her over.

ERIC
I said, shut up!
He puts his knife to her throat to quiet her.
ERIC
(TO FINN)
I'll keep my word when the Queen keeps
hers.
Finn shakes his head and laughs.
FINN
You are a drunk and a fool. My Queen has
many powers; she can take life or sustain
it. But she can't bring your wife back
from the dead.
ERIC
I WANT HER BACK!
His face tells us how much Eric wanted, needed to believe.
The Guards keep inching toward Eric.
Eric, still with a knife to Snow White's throat, starts
slowly backing up.
Finn pulls his own sword and approaches.
Four against one. As they burst toward him he tosses Snow
White to the ground and in the same motion throws his knife
into the chest of one of the Guards, who crumbles.
Eric reaches behind, grabs both hatchets and faces off with
the others.
They all rush at once. Eric fights off the guards as he
raises a hatchet, throws it --
Right into Finn's chest. Just like Ravenna, no blood, no
wound. Finn pulls it out, laughs and throws it at the
huntsman who ducks as it sticks into a tree.
Snow White, terrified, races off into the forest. They
notice her exit but keep fighting.
Eric fights on three sides now - holding his own until Finn
manages to plunge a sword in his side.

Eric grunts and falls back. Finn races forward to finish him
off but Eric lunges and --
Flips Finn onto his back and into a grove of mushrooms.
Eric covers his nose with his arm and looks at the other
Guards, who look from Finn, who is dazed, to Eric, who is
hurt.
Finn struggles to his knees, shakes his head, hallucinating a
bit.
FINN
Butcher him! Find her!
The Guards, also trying to cover their noses, move forward.
Eric has a decision to make.
Bad odds. And he's injured. Eric decides in an instant,
grabs his knife out of the dead Guard, as well as his hatchet
from the tree and runs after Snow White --
Snow White crashes through the woods.
Then a HAND grabs her shoulder--
Eric. He slaps a palm over her mouth before she can scream
and slides down a steep slope into undergrowth.
Finn is on his feet but still hallucinating - stumbling
about. The Guards are spooked as they look all around.
FINN
This is not finished!
The words echo through the dark forest.
Eric removes his hand from Snow White's mouth.
At once she PUNCHES HIM WITH ALL SHE'S GOT.
He steps back, licks his bloody lip. She takes another swing.
This one he manages to grab.
SNOW WHITE
Get your hands off me.
She draws his dagger. He backs off. Eyeball to eyeball:

Without warning, he walks off.
Leaving her alone. She follows him.
SNOW WHITE
Where are you going?
ERIC
Away from you, love. You're trouble.
SNOW WHITE
I need to get to the Duke's Castle.
There's an army there. I'll be safe.
ERIC
The Duke? I've seen sheep with more fight
in them.
Desperate, she takes a chance.
SNOW WHITE
Take me, you'll be rewarded.
I'm valuable. Isn't that why you're here?
SHE APPEALS:
SNOW WHITE
You're dead if you return without me. And
I'm dead if you leave me.
He turns, exasperated with her.
ERIC
(Then -- wearily:)
Just for argument's sake.
(Shakes his head)
How much?
SNOW WHITE
How much is enough?
Eric "reluctantly" prices up the job.
ERIC
Well,it's a long way, through the
forest, and that... that's a dangerous
road, I couldn't even consider it for
less than thirty gold pieces...
SNOW WHITE
A hundred. Deliver me safe to the Duke. I
give you my word.

Deep quandary. Still suspicious..
ERIC
Who are you?
She looks at him levelly.
SNOW WHITE
Maybe that's a question you should have
asked the queen.
Stand-off.
SNOW WHITE
Do we have a deal?
ERIC
I don't trust you Billy Goat.
SNOW WHITE
I've given you my word.
He spits on his hand. She puts out her hand.
He shakes it.
ERIC
I still don't trust you.
SNOW WHITE
I don't trust you either.
She wipes it on her skirt. Behind them, a commotion.
They run off.

Tree roots gleam with an eerie phosphorescent light. The mist
closes in. Snow White looks around the forest, unnerved by
the haunting silence and the deep shadows. Reluctantly she
focuses on Eric, trying to take her mind off the terrors
around her.
He sits on a log for a breath.
ERIC
We'll stay the night here.
SNOW WHITE
You haven't answered me.
ERIC
I don't recall a question.
SNOW WHITE
Where are we going?
He takes a stick, draws in the dirt.
ERIC
Queen. Mountains. Dark Forest. Here.
Past. There's a village.
She takes the stick, points to a different spot in the dirt.
SNOW WHITE
I'm going to the Duke's Castle.
He grabs the stick back.
ERIC
You'll go where I take you.
SNOW WHITE
You'll take me to the Duke's castle or
I'll go alone.

SNOW WHITE
There's a reward that awaits you. There
are noblemen there, an army.
ERIC
(LAUGHS)
An army? The Duke fights? He hides behind
walls. I know sheep that have more fight
in them.
(after a beat)
How much?
(off her look)
Reward? Just for argument's sake?
SNOW WHITE
How much do you want?
Eric considers this, not sure how or if to negotiate.
SNOW WHITE
Two hundred gold pieces. Do we have a
deal?
More, a lot more, than he was expecting.
ERIC
I'll deliver you to safety m' lady.
SNOW WHITE
Swear it.
ERIC
I swear (beat). Constantly. It's one of
my better qualities.
She's not sure what to make of this, but...
SNOW WHITE
Fine.
He moves to a spot to lie down and gathers leaves.
Snow White seeks her own spot and comes upon -- the RIB CAGE
OF A DEAD DEER, a host of BEAUTIFUL BUTTERFLIES feeding on
its bones. She is shocked. Eric notices...
ERIC
I've seen far stranger things in here.
She sits, looks to Eric. Something's been bothering her.
SNOW WHITE
Do you think... will they follow us?
ERIC
They'd be foolish to. Few survive.
Good news/bad news. She looks around.

SNOW WHITE
How far have you travelled into the Dark
Forest?
ERIC
We passed it a few miles back.
He opens his flask and takes a healthy pull.
We're moving over high mountains and valleys now, approaching
Duke Hammond's castle.
FLAMING MOSS is thrown into a puddle of oil and a MASSIVE
FIRE lights up the night.
William, rapid-fires his bow at close quarters into a line of
the Queen's supply wagons and the fight is on. A VIOLENT
CLASH OF SWORDS IN CLOSE QUARTER FIGHTING.
His COMPANIONS are as wild and hot-headed as he is, roaring
with delight as the Queen's men finally flee.

FINN
Which of you knows the dark forest?
A powerfully built Yakut tracker, ALDAN, and BROCH both nod.
FINN
You. You. You. You.
He's selected Aldan, Broch and points to others. As we move
down the line we see --
William, hat low, trying to look tough.
Finn selects a few more.
FINN
Load and prepare. You ride for bounty.
Into the dark forest. The rest of you.
Away !
As they disperse..
William sets his jaw, and heads off..
CUT TO:
The men ride out of the village. Suddenly they stop.
Standing up ahead is William, blocking their path. He calls
to them.
WILLIAM
You need a bowman?
FINN calls back.
FINN
I have a bowman. Away.
WILLIAM stands unblinking.
FINN
I said away, damn you!
WILLIAM doesn't move. Finn turns to the bowman.

But William doesn't budge.
One of the other mercenaries grins, then rides towards
William, drawing his sword. He raises it when William
unslings his bow and loosens two arrows at close range,
hitting him in each thigh and knocking him off his horse.
Broch draws his enormous battle axe, about to charge, when
Finn rides forward and stops him.
FINN
Wait!
Finn sizes up William.
FINN
You're quick with a bow.
WILLIAM
I want to ride with you.
FINN
Why?
WILLIAM
You are paying well and I need the coin.
FINN
Have you traversed the Dark Forest?
WILLIAM
No.
FINN
Then what use are you?
WILLIAM
As you said, I'm quick with a bow.
He nods to the guy on the ground, groaning with arrows in his
thighs.
WILLIAM
And unlike him, I have two good legs.
Finn considers for a moment, then smiles, nods to the guy on
the ground.
FINN
Replace him.
William looks at Finn gratefully. Finn studies him with a
curious smile then rides on.

Snow White approaches a stream, kneels, splashes her face and
brings a handful of water to her lips.
ERIC
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Not unless you want your bowels to rip
apart.
She turns. Eric has been snoozing on a rock, with one eye
open. She releases the water, stands and faces off with Eric,
who offers his flask of mead. She reluctantly takes a sip,
spits most of it out, hands it back.
He smells something, walks a few steps, bends down and examines
a long brown pellet shaped object on the ground.
SNOW WHITE
What is it?
ERIC
A fumee.

She catches the look of fear in his eyes as he gazes around the
woods.
ERIC
Stay here.
He moves away, though the trees, tracking prey. He hears the
wind call his name...
SARA
Eric.
He stops, looks to --
An outcropping of rocks, surrounded by dense forest. From
out behind a tree steps an apparition of SARA. She's
beautiful.
ERIC
Sara?...
BACK TO SNOW WHITE
She hears him call out and follows his tracks.
BACK TO HUNTSMAN
Sara holds out her hand.
ERIC
Am I dreaming?
SARA
Touch me and see for yourself.
Eric shakes his head, looks around, tries to fight it, but...
Her face draws him back and he begins to walk toward the
rocks.
SARA
You weren't there to save me, Eric. I
called for you but you never came.
Snow White appears behind and sees --
Eric is walking toward a dark area where several sets of
lupine eyes await.
But Eric only sees Sara and he continues to move toward her.
She opens her arms to him and steps backwards, luring him.
SARA
Where were you, Eric? Come to me now.
Protect me now.

ERIC
Sara, I'm so sorry. Forgive me, please
forgive me. Give me peace. Sara...
He takes another step toward her and --
Buckles - THWACK!
Snow White hits him behind his knees with a piece of wood.
He hits the ground and she drags him away. He fights back and
she jumps on top of him, staring right into his face.
SNOW WHITE
She's not real! Not real! Do you hear
me?!
He does and calms. She gets off him and he sits up, fatigued
by the experience. A low point for him.
He reaches for his flask -- pours the last single drop into
his mouth. All gone. He tosses it aside. A lost soul.
Snow White watches him with some compassion. He catches her
look, gets up and walks away.
Snow White catches up.
SNOW WHITE
Who is she? The one you bargained for.
The one that spoke to you. Who is Sara?
ERIC
A name you'll not mention again.
He tosses a knife to her. She's surprised but catches it.
SNOW WHITE
What?
ERIC
Feel its weight. One hand to the other.
She shakes her head but does so.
ERIC
Now hold it - business end pointed at me.
SNOW WHITE
Why are you?--
He lunges at her and she raises the blade.

He jumps at her again and she puts her right foot forward,
knife in right hand pointed. He starts to slowly move toward
her. One step at a time.
ERIC
Now stay back. You're too small to
attack. You have to parry; use your
opponents strength against him. Raise
your opposing forearm.
She does. He comes closer.
ERIC
With it you block and deflect an opposing
thrust. You'll lose meat but you won't
die from it. Wait until I'm close.
He steps forward.
ERIC
Not yet. Watch my hands, not my eyes.
He moves even closer.
ERIC
Not yet. Not until you can feel my
breath.
He moves right up to her.
ERIC
Now.
Their faces are inches apart.
ERIC
This close. Drive it through me. To the
hilt. Now look in my eyes.
(SHE DOES)
Don't pull it out 'til you see my soul.
Their eyes are still locked.
SNOW WHITE
Why do I need to learn how to kill?
He looks at her.
ERIC
There's a lot you need to learn lass.
Eric backs away.
ERIC
Keep that.
She nods, now-focused on him in a way other than as an
instructor. He turns and walks away.

SNOW WHITE
Where are you going?
ERIC
Fumee.
A single blossom flowers on the dying apple tree. Ravenna,
looking weaker than before, stares at it quietly, as if she
were gazing at Snow White. She reaches out and crushes the
blossom in her hand, turning it into ash.
Her look is one of conviction.
RAVENNA
Find her.

86 MOVED TO 13A 86
Finn reacts as if he heard Ravenna's words. He did. They have
that kind of connection. Spooked, he continues on. The other
trackers follow, William looking tense. At the back of the
group, one of the mercenaries slows down, sensing something in
the forest.
William is still watching Finn when they hear a bloodcurdling
CRY behind them. The mercenary's horse gallops out of the trees
without its rider, a gaping wound in its side. William and the
others look shaken but Finn doesn't even turn around, riding on.
Eric pulls Snow White along. Beyond a bridge we see open fens
-- the bridge LEADS OUT OF THE DARK FOREST -- and birds
circling on the distant horizon.
Snow White looks relieved as she follows him down a slope.
They hurry through a sea of mist when suddenly Eric stops.
SNOW WHITE
What is it?
ERIC
It can't be this easy.
He quietly unsheathes a hatchet.
SNOW WHITE
Is this the end of the Dark Forest?
ERIC
(not paying attention)
Uh-huh.

SNOW WHITE
How far to the Duke's castle?
He ignores, follows tracks, then stops as he sees the STONE
BRIDGE below -- LEADING OUT OF THE DARK FOREST. Snow White
stares at it too, relieved. Beyond the bridge there are open
fens.
They hurry down together and start to cross the bridge.
They're half way across WHEN SUDDENLY WE SEE THE STONES START
TO MOVE BEHIND THEM --
A PAIR OF EYES OPENS IN THE STONE, AND SLOWLY THE BRIDGE
STARTS TO RISE --
Snow White turns to see -- A HUGE CREATURE REARING UP --
TWENTY FEET TALL. IT'S NOT A BRIDGE AT ALL BUT A --
ERIC
Troll!
Eric and Snow White are SLAMMED off the bridge and land in
the shallow creek below -- among the CARCASSES OF SLAIN
ANIMALS. The troll roars and comes after them, swinging its
giant stone fists. Eric grabs Snow White and runs --
As the troll catches up with them, Eric shoves her out of the
way and draws his hatchets.
ERIC
Run!
Snow White turns and flees. Eric runs at the Troll. He ducks
as a mighty arm sweeps over him, darts between the troll's
legs, and hacks at its leg with his hatchets.
The Troll falters a bit then --
A swinging stone fist catches him and hurls him across the
creek.
Snow White looks back to see Eric lying stunned on the
ground, his wound bleeding again, at the troll's mercy. She
hesitates, still terrified, then runs back.
The Troll towers over the huntsman. It raises its stone hands
to crush him when --
Snow White arrives -- SCREAMING LIKE A BANSHEE!
The Troll looks around in surprise. So does Eric. A beat,
then the monster turns away from Eric, striding towards Snow
WHITE --
She stands her ground, fighting her terror, PULLS HER KNIFE.
The TROLL looms over her, but she doesn't retreat. She raises
an arm, just as Eric instructed.

Snow White stares into the troll's eyes, seeing something
almost gentle in its monstrous gaze, slowly losing her fear.
The troll stares at her too, confused, then slowly pacified,
until it finally turns and strides away.
Eric stares in disbelief. Snow White is rooted to the spot,
also confused but strangely moved by what's happened. Eric
rises to his feet painfully and heads over, taking her by the
arm.
ERIC
I told you to run.
SNOW WHITE
If I had you'd be dead. A "thank you"
would suffice.
It's clear he sees her in a different light. She stares back
at him. Eric holds her gaze, struggling a bit, then...
ERIC
Thank you.
The sun glints through the thinning trees. Eric wades through
the deep sludge, Snow White following in his steps.
Eric looks at her a moment, then suddenly turns away as he
sees her expression change --
GHOSTLY BACKLIT FIGURES EMERGE on the banks of the marsh now,
holding bows and arrows. Eric looks around for an escape route,
but everywhere he turns MORE FIGURES APPEAR.
He draws his axe when A FIGURE IN A HOODED CLOAK (ANNA) appears,
clutching her bow like a goddess.
ANNA
They say only demons or spirits can
survive the dark forest. Which are you?
Eric, unsure, pulls his hatchet and steps in front of Snow
White protecting her.
ERIC
Which are you?
ANNA
Neither. Perhaps you are the Queen's
spies?
ERIC
We're fugitives from the Queen.
Snow White steps forward into the light.

The fenland village is made up of mud huts, elevated on stilts
to protect them from flooding.

Anna paddles a boat as they approach the village. Eric and
Snow White speak quietly.
ON THE BANK
The boat stops and they get out. The women of the village
move from their hut to greet them as they walk into the
village.
More women emerge from their huts to view the newcomers, no
men in sight. They all have scarred faces.
All the women have assembled alongside the group, watching
with awe as they pass. They stare at Snow White and murmur.
They can't take their eyes off her. Some even reach out to
touch her sleeve or dress.
SNOW WHITE
(sotto; to Eric)
Why are they looking at me like that?
ERIC
I don't know, but keep smiling.
A beautiful LITTLE GIRL, LILY, moves away from her friends
and offers her hand. Snow White stops, looks down at the
girl, trying not to stare at her scar.
90-93a OMITTED 90-93a
Eric sits by the lake, ANNA bandaging his wounds.
ANNA
You have travelled far Huntsman. With a
heavy burden.
Snow white is playing with Lily. They are making little dolls
from straw.
ERIC
I've had worse jobs. And anyway, she's
not that heavy.

peaceful. But it makes me very sad.
ERIC
Why didn't you tell me?
She stops. She knows.
ERIC
Because I'd think it too fell a task?
You'd be right.
She looks at him. Shakes her head.
SNOW WHITE
That's not why. It's because I've never
said the words.
She looks at Lily playing.
SNOW WHITE
I'm not sure I believe it myself. I never
felt like a..
(She stops.)
Alone in a dark cell. For years. Fighting
to cling to memories. What he looked
like. Smelled like. The kind man with the
big arms and the wonderful smiles.. To
me.. he wasn't The King. He was my
father.
Eric doesn't know what to say. In time, he reaches in his
pocket.
ERIC

need and makes it the bravest in of all
God's creatures. It's a protection charm.
(HE SHRUGS)
Or so they say.
They share a look.
SNOW WHITE
Was it hers?
It's the most honest and emotional he's been with her.

Aye I know the truth. And that's exactly
why she should be as far from me as
possible.

Snow White faces off with the Mercenary. She does as she's been
taught - waits for him to approach. When he's close enough to
grab her slashes at him with the knife. The huge mercenary
knocks her to the ground and advances on her.
-- when an arrow strikes him in the shoulder. He falls,
revealing a young warrior holding a bow.
It's WILLIAM. Snow White stares at him through the flames, with
a mixture of recognition and uncertainty.
It's as if for a moment everything stops as she comes
FACE TO FACE
With something from the past. Almost like a ghost. Or a
vision.. He nods to her in recognition.
She stands perfectly still.
SUDDENLY
Anna pulls Snow White away, as they move through the smoke
and the fire.
William starts to follow, a curtain of smoke swirling around
him.
Eric arrives to see the village in flames. He rushes to the
centre of the village, pulling a mercenary off his horse and
running him through with his own sword, then fighting and
killing TWO MORE MERCS as he makes his way forward.

Finn sits astride his horse like a demon king in the firelight.
He spots William in the distance, searching for Snow White and

William jumps on his horse again, looking for Snow White through
the clouds of billowing smoke. Finn and Aldan ride up.
FINN
Have you seen her?
WILLIAM
No, my lord.
Finn spits fury and continues to race around, frantic.
Eric pulls Snow White onwards, the blazing fires from the
village lighting up the marsh. He sees a lake up ahead when a
figure appears, blocking their way. It's the giant BROCH.
Grinning, he unstraps his huge axe, ready to face Eric one more
time. Eric doesn't even slow down, letting go of Snow White and
unstrapping his own hatchets. It looks as if it's going to be an
epic fight, but as Broch swings, Eric ducks and drives both
hatchets into the giant's ribs, killing him instantly.
They escape into the darkness.

Finn, surrounded by smoke and fire, is beyond frustration.
He screams to the heavens in despair.

Snow White slowly nods.
Eric lies back and looks up at the sun flickering through the
trees. It dances on his face and then --
A HUGE SHADOW blots out the light.
Before he can react, fists and boots lay into him. As he
protects his face, we catch glimpses of brutal figures in
battle masks. Eric kicks a couple of them away, but more of
them swarm over him, pinning him down in leg locks and choke
holds.
Snow White is treated just as roughly, powerful arms and legs
pinning her down. She bites one of her captors and he twists
her arms behind her back. A noose is slung around Eric's
ankles and he's hauled up - hanging upside down. Snow White,
also tied up, sits on the ground beside him.
A line of DWARVES stand before them and pull up their
grotesque BATTLE MASKS.
The dwarf leader, Beith glowers.
BEITH
Well, well, well... the miscreant
huntsman.
ERIC
Come on, Beith! Is this how you treat a
friend?

short distance.
They get the reference, don't like it. Nion slaps Eric again.

Tell them the truth, huntsman.
The youngest of the dwarves, GUS, is beaming at Snow White with
his dirty teeth.
SNOW WHITE
(FIERCELY)
What are you looking at?
(CONTINUED)

124a CONTINUED: (2) 124a
GUS
Nothing, Miss. It's just... you been the
prettiest thing I ever did seen.
He smiles, almost sweetly, disarming her. Snow White looks at
her other captors now, noticing a blind dwarf, (MUIR), who sits
with his son (QUERT), also gazing at her.

124a CONTINUED: (3) 124a
ERIC
Just tell me what I've done wrong?
BEITH
Tell me what you've done right first?
ERIC
I saved this girl from the Queen. Out of
the goodness of my heart.
Snow White gives him a look. He calms her with a look of his
own.
BEITH
Doesn't sound like you, huntsman.
ERIC
People change.
NION
People, not ruttish swine.
Nion gives Eric another smack around the head.
MUIR
Quert?
Quert jumps to and helps his father as he makes his way to
Snow White. He touches her face and something happens in
him. His demeanor softens and the hint of a smile lands on
his lips. Meanwhile...
GORT
So what's the verdict?
COLL
Leave 'em to rot.
DUIR
Yeah. Or skewer him and leave her to rot!
COLL
That would work, too, but my way's
cleaner.
Note: Coll and Duir have this "at each other but we're
comrades" relationship. Coll also has an incessant cough.
MUIR
No!
(a beat for emphasis)
She is destined.
They all trade looks. Muir is the spiritual leader of the
group and they dare not speak against him, even Beith.
GORT
Destined?...
(CONTINUED)
61
124a CONTINUED: (4) 124a
GUS
(SMITTEN)
She is.
BEITH
Are you?
SNOW WHITE
Do you hate the Queen?
BEITH
Hate's a strong word.
(BEAT)
But not strong enough in this case.
SNOW WHITE
My father was King Magnus.
This carries weight with the group. Impressed.
MUIR
No one listens to me.
SNOW WHITE
If you accompany us to the Duke's castle
you will be paid handsomely.
ERIC
We don't need their help.
BEITH
You were already lost seeing that you
found us.
GORT
How handsomely?
SNOW WHITE
Your weight in gold. Each of you.
The dwarves trade glances, literally sizing each other up.
ERIC
That's more than you offered me?!
BEITH
Goodness of your heart, eh, Huntsman?
DUIR
(whispers to Coll)
I get more than you.
COLL
True, but because of your size you eat
and drink more, which costs more, so...
(CONTINUED)
62
124a CONTINUED: (5) 124a
BEITH
Alright, we'll take you, but the huntsman
can hang -
SNOW WHITE
Both of us.
Eric looks surprised by her loyalty. So do the dwarves.
Suddenly Duir calls out:
DUIR
Riders!
The dwarves look round to see a DOZEN SILHOUETTED HORSEMEN
appear on the crest of a DISTANT HILL.
ERIC
Those are the Queen's men, Beith, better
decide quickly.
BEITH
One dwarf's worth a dozen tallsters, I'll
take my time thank you --
He suddenly stops as dozens more RIDERS appear on the hill.
ERIC
You were saying?
BEITH
Cut him down! MOVE OUT!
Nion roughly cuts the line and the Huntsman drops to the
ground as Gus gently lifts Snow White. They all hurry down
the hill.
125 OMITTED 125
The dwarves and their captives arrive at a rocky outcrop. Duir
and Coll pull back a large root exposing a cave entrance.
ERIC
Ah, a short cut.
All 8 dwarf heads spin at him - pissed off. Enough with the
short jokes.
Nion raps Eric's knee with the flat of his dagger.
ERIC
Owww!!!
Gus cuts Snow White loose.
(CONTINUED)
62A
126 CONTINUED: 126
Nion hesitates, then reluctantly frees the huntsman. DUIR and
COLL lead the way into a cave. Gus pulls Snow White to safety
just as the enemy riders appear.
Snow White and the huntsman emerge from the cave to see a
shimmering landscape of glistening moss and sunlight. It's like
a mirage. The air is filled with specks of pollen and a strange
HUMMING NOISE echoes like music. For Snow White, it's the most
beautiful sound she's ever heard. Next to her, Nion, snorts:
NION
Blasted fairy music. Wish I had some wax to
stuff my ears.
GORT
There's plenty of moss.
GORT scoops up a handful of moss and moulds himself some ear
plugs, sticking them in his ears. Snow White is still mesmerized
by the fairy music and the shimmering haze.
SNOW WHITE
What is this place?
The huntsman looks just as dazzled.
GUS
They call it Sanctuary, my lady. The
Enchanted Forest. It's the home of the
fairies.
And slowly the hazy curtain gives way to an enchanted forest --
as different to the dark forest as one could imagine --
Life grows everywhere -- LUSH GRASS, PROUD TREES COVERED IN
BUTTERFLIES, BUBBLING STREAMS, MOSS COVERED TORTOISES, FOXES AND
RABBITS SIDE BY SIDE, EXOTIC FLOWERS AND EVERYWHERE THE LIFE-
GIVING POLLEN--
Snow White sees tiny figures flying behind the trees -- almost
too fast to spot -- the pollen following them in long trails --
GUS
Fairies.
GORT
Pests.
Of the other dwarves, only the blind MUIR seems to appreciate
the beauty around him, enjoying the vibrations on his face.
BEITH
set up camp.
64
HEARTY, SOULFUL SINGING. Seated among the ruins, the dwarves
sing a Celtic ballad as old as time, GUS playing the fiddle.
Coll and Duir sit away from the others, gazing out with the
thousand yard stare of hardened war veterans.
COLL
That song takes me back to the battle of
Tylweth Gate. A small horde versus an army.
Pickaxes against swords and spears.
DUIR
Them were the days.
(BEAT)
What happened to your quailing cough?
Coll shakes his head, "dunno". The two of them smile then join
in the singing. A drunken GORT takes a swig of ale and staggers
over to GUS.
GORT
Play louder, you whey-face, I can still
hear those harpy fairies.
He takes another swig and sings at the top of his voice, out of
tune, trying to drown out the humming of the unseen fairies.
Snow White and the huntsman look on, smiling.
ERIC
Legend has it dwarves were created to
uncover all the riches hidden on earth. Not
just gold and precious stones, but the
beauty in people's hearts.
SNOW WHITE
Really?
ERIC
Ask me, they've lost the art if they ever
had it. When the Queen seized their mines
she stole their treasure but more than that
she stole their pride.
And as if to prove it, GORT and NION sing and share from a flask
of rum before they tumble to the ground-near Muir as the song
ends. Eric notices the tumble and chuckles.
GORT
What are you pribbling at, longshanks?!
ERIC
Nothing half-wit.
GORT
I'm half of nothing.you canker blossom.
(CONTINUED)
64A
130 CONTINUED: 130
MUIR
Son?... Sing the one.
Perched on his stone, QUERT nods; sings a more CHEERFUL SONG.
Eric watches as Snow White walks over to Muir. Before she can
say anything...
(CONTINUED)
65
130 CONTINUED: (2) 130
MUIR
That seat's not taken, if that's what you
were about to ask.
She sits on the log beside him. Gort and Nion eye her.
SNOW WHITE
Thank you so much, sir.
MUIR
It's only a log, no need to praise me.
SNOW WHITE
No. For before. For defending me.
MUIR
Your father was a good man. The kingdom
prospered. Our people prospered.
SNOW WHITE
There were more of you?
MUIR
Aye.
And that is all Muir will say on the subject. Gort fills in.
GORT
One day the group you see before you went
down into the mine for a month long
shift. Gus was only a boy. When we came
back to the surface... nothing. The land
was black, everything, everyone... dead,
gone. We searched but...
Gort surprises himself by choking up a bit. Muir helps out.
MUIR
That was the month your father died.
SNOW WHITE
I'm so sorry.
MUIR
As am I, princess. As am I.
GUS walks over to Snow White.
GUS
I know I'm a bit spongy to look at, Miss,
but would you care to dance-with a little
'un?
SNOW WHITE
I'd be honored.
Snow White gets up and dances with Gus as the song picks up.
(CONTINUED)
66
130 CONTINUED: (3) 130
Nion and Gort watch her dance with Gus. Nion's not
impressed, leans in to Gort...
NION
I don't trust her. And I don't believe
in her, no matter what Muir says.
Gort is still melancholy...
GORT
Just you and me,... do you think there
are any of us left? Do you think perhaps
they were merely banished?
NION
As long as the Queen's in charge we'll
never know.
GORT
Well, maybe that's the point, isn't it?
(beat; out of the blue)
I feel funny. Queer almost.
NION
Queer. Since when?
GORT
How's your gout?
Nion rubs his leg.
NION
Better.
Gort's look goes from Nion to Snow White.
GORT
You don't think it has anything to do
with...
NION
How much have you had to drink?!
The huntsman drains the last few drops of his rum when BEITH
approaches, sitting beside him gruffly.
BEITH
Fleecing us of all our rum, eh huntsman?
ERIC
What do you say, we let bygones be bygones?
BEITH
Not yet, nut-hook. What's in it for you?
(off Eric's innocent expression)
I'm talking about the girl? Is it really
just the gold?
(CONTINUED)
67
130 CONTINUED: (4) 130
Eric watches Snow White dancing with Gus, then shrugs.
ERIC
I'm not sure, Beith. If I had any sense I'd
have abandoned her long ago.
Beith eyes Eric as he watches Snow White dance.
BEITH
Muir says she's destined. Question is,
huntsman, for whom?
Gus and Snow White are still dancing.
GUS
(As Snow White treads on his toes)
You don't mind me saying, you got two left
feet for a princess.
SNOW WHITE
I don't mind at all, Gus. I haven't danced
in a long, long while.
She feels eyes on her - turns to see the huntsman watching her
with a slight smile. She smiles back and breaks away.
SNOW WHITE
Do you mind, Gus?
GUS
Not at all.
Snow White walks over to the Huntsman, holds out her hand.
SNOW WHITE
You've taught me to fight, surely I can
teach you to dance.
Eric trades a look with Beith, who nudges him on. Eric
stands and they proceed to dance, with her teaching.
SNOW WHITE
Palms up, head straight, look me in the
eyes. And...
The huntsman moves better than you'd imagine. His face even
softens as they both enjoy the dance.
Beith looks on with a smile.
130a OMITTED 130a
Eric and the dwarves are asleep. Flowers have grown around them,
as if they've been asleep for months.
Cull and Duir sleep sitting up, back to back, at the ready.
(CONTINUED)
68
131 CONTINUED: 131
Muir, also awake and smiling, sits against the log, his hand
rubbing his son's sleeping head.
Snow White sits amazed, drinking in the sights and sounds.
Animals emerge from the forest -- SQUIRRELS, BEAVERS, FOXES,
BIRDS. Slowly they make their way towards the ruins, gazing at
Snow White.
THE NIGHT SHIMMERS WITH FAIRY LIGHT AS THEY OBSERVE HER.
Snow White feels the light on her face and to her surprise, she
sees the two MAGPIES who watched over her at the castle. Two
BEAUTIFUL FAIRIES WITH THE DEER EYES slip out of the magpies'
bodies, beaming at her.
As Snow White sits up, they direct her to the woods WHERE A
DAZZLING LIGHT SHINES THROUGH A TREE. As she walks animals fall
in alongside her.
A little way away, Gus snores in his sleep. The golden light
crosses his face and he wakes up. As he opens his eyes, he
stares in wonder, then quickly wakes the other dwarves.
They all stare in amazement now, even the blind MUIR. Eric is
the last to wake up, wondering what the fuss is all about.
They rise and follow to --
AT THE TREE
She stands BENEATH THE GIANT TREE, facing a MAJESTIC WHITE HART.
The air around the mystical creature shimmers with a golden
light.
BEITH
No one's ever seen it before.
The excited Muir grabs his son Quert by the arm.
QUERT
The white hart bows before the princess,
father.
Sure enough, the HART lowers its head before Snow White. Muir's
face is lit up in the golden light, his blind eyes shining.
MUIR
It's blessing her.
ERIC
What are you talking about?
MUIR
You have eyes, huntsman, but do not see.
You who have been with her the longest.
Eric doesn't understand.
(CONTINUED)
69
CONTINUED:
MUIR
She is life itself. She will heal the land.
She is the one.
GORT
So you're saying she is destined?...
Muir can only shake his head.
MUIR
No one listens to me.
(BEAT)
Can't you feel it? Are you ailments not
gone? Gold or no gold, where she leads I
follow.
GUS
Aye!
The other Dwarves trade looks. Nion, the last, shrugs.
As Snow White strokes the hart's neck, the golden light
brightens, engulfing her.
-- SUDDENLY AN ARROW FLIES THROUGH THE AIR -- AND PIERCES THE
WHITE HART'S FLANK.
The HART roars in pain and bolts. The fairies and animals
scatter in all directions now, their sanctuary violated.
Eric looks up to see ALDAN the Yakut emerging through the trees
on horseback, notching another arrow to his bow.
A FIERCE WIND rips through the sanctuary now, shadows spreading
where there was once light. Eric sees FINN appear on horseback,
looking like a demon god in the gathering darkness.
The huntsman grabs his axe. So do the dwarves, pulling on their
battle masks.
WILLIAM emerges through the trees to see ALDAN aiming his bow at
Snow White. He rides into the Yakut's horse, knocking him off
balance just as he fires --
The arrow narrowly misses Snow White, thudding into a tree. Gus
grabs her by the hand.
GUS
Come on!
He runs with her into the forest.
Aldan turns on William furiously, drawing his curved sword, but
before he can swing the dwarves attack both men --
Eric only has eyes for Finn. They stare at each other in the
roaring wind, then Finn gallops into the forest after-Snow White
Eric RUNS in the same direction --
(CONTINUED)
70
CONTINUED: (2)
William fends off the furious dwarf attack then rides off in
pursuit of snow white --
Aldan sees him but is too busy defending himself against COLL
and DUIR to give chase --
All around the forest the shadow of death is spreading. Gus
runs, dragging Snow White behind him. Galloping through the
trees, WILLIAM spots them up ahead, riding faster.
Bow and arrow at the ready, Eric runs after Finn. All around him
the forest is darkening. He follows the sound of galloping
hooves when suddenly they stop. He stops too, notching an arrow
to his bow, peering into the gloom and listening.
There's a tense silence, then SUDDENLY HE HEARS A NOISE. He
spins around, ready to fire, when he sees it's only Finn's
riderless horse galloping past --
He realizes too late that it's a trick -- FINN EXPLODES OUT OF
THE DARKNESS, catching him a glancing blow with his sword --
Coll and Duir leap up at Aldan, trying to drag him off his
horse, but he's a ferocious fighter, driving them both back --
William spots Snow White up ahead. She disappears into the
trees and he rides faster. She erupts from behind a branch and
pulls him off his horse. Gus races over and raises his axe --
SNOW WHITE
Gus, no!
Gus's axe stops inches from William's eyes. Snow White
recognizes the young warrior, staring at him in surprise.
SNOW WHITE
I saw you at the village.
William looks up at her, out of breath:
WILLIAM
It's me. William.
Snow White stares in disbelief, tears of surprise welling in her
eyes. Gus looks even more confused, lowering his axe.
William slowly rises to his feet, gazing back at Snow White,
when THEY HEAR A TWIG SNAP --
Gus hears it too, spinning around --
(CONTINUED)
71
135 CONTINUED: 135
-- To see ALDAN with an arrow notched to his bow --
GUS
PRINCESS!
Gus launches himself -- and takes the arrow meant for Snow
White. Before Aldan can load another arrow -- William fires an
arrow of his own, striking him in the chest. The Yakut topples
over, dead at last but still astride his horse.
Snow White falls to her knees in anguish, cradling the dying
Gus. He smiles weakly, holding her gaze, then whispers:
GUS
I shan't leave you, Miss.
Eric charges into Finn with a cry of rage. Finn deflects the
blow and hurls him back into the trees. Driven by fury, Eric
charges again, but Finn uses his anger against him, ducking
under the vicious blow and landing a brutal one of his own --
Eric crashes into another tree. His eyes are still full of
hatred but his body is weak. Finn smiles in contempt from a few
yards away.
FINN
I captured many girls, but your wife was
special.
ERIC
What?!
FINN
She fought and then she begged. For her
life. Please?!!! You should know she
called for you. Your Sara.
ERIC
How do you know her name?!
Eric is shocked, desperate.
FINN
She told me. Just before I slit her
throat.
-ERIC
Bastard... .-
Eric notices a fallen TREE TRUNK behind Finn -- dead branches
STICKING UP LIKE SPIKES. Finn steps toward him...
FINN
Now you can look for her in the other world
and beg for her forgiveness.
(CONTINUED)
71A
136 CONTINUED: 136
Finn smiles and raises his sword for the death blow -- when ERIC
LUNGES. He throws himself at Finn, his momentum carrying them
both into THE DEAD TREE'S SPIKED BRANCHES --
The branches pierce Finn's body, their tips digging into Eric's
flesh. Finn howls in agony --
137 OMITTED 137
72
Finn writhes, fighting to pull himself free of the branches but
Eric holds him down, even as the spikes dig into him, forcing
Finn's wounds to stay open - unable to heal.
FINN
Sister -- heal me!! --
139 OMITTED 139
140 ENCHANTED FOREST - DAY. 140
-- the SHADOWY ENERGY swirls around Finn's wounds -- but as the
branches keep the wounds open, they cannot heal --
Still bleeding from his wounds, Eric hurries back through the
forest until he sees Snow White and the seven dwarves gathered
around Gus's body, chanting a low prayer. Eric stares in
surprise, then notices William.
ERIC
Who is this?
Beith is about to reply when William answers for himself.
WILLIAM
My name is William. I am Duke Hammond's
son.
(BEAT)
You look familiar.
Eric dodges a bit with --
ERIC
What is the Duke's son doing riding with
the Queen's men?
WILLIAM
I was looking for the princess.
ERIC
Why?
WILLIAM
To protect her.
ERIC
The princess is well protected as you can
see.
WILLIAM
And who are you?
ERIC
The man who got her this far your lordship.
WILLIAM
I'm grateful for your help but I will take
her from here.
ERIC
You'll have to wait for your voice to break
before you give me orders -
William draws his sword in indignation and Eric draws his axe.
(CONTINUED)
74
144 CONTINUED: 144
ERIC
Anyone can draw steel, boy. It takes a man
to use it.
William is about to react when Snow White turns...
SNOW WHITE
Leave him, huntsman. He's our friend.
He glares but his eyes glisten with tears. Snow White is
still bowed over Gus's body, sobbing, mourning.
The prayer chant ends. Nion spits with anger and walks away.
NION
We need to convene.
They all follow him a few steps away, where they have
privacy.
BEITH
What is it, Nion?
NION
This is what happens when dwarves mix
with men. We always come out worse. We
have big hearts and we'll fight for any
cause -- but for what? For some new Queen
to call us runts and turn us out of our
homes again?
GORT
I've nothing against the girl, but I'm
not willing to risk my life for her
either, like poor Gus.
Beith considers quietly, the other dwarves listening too.
DUIR
(whispers to Coll)
Does this mean we're not fighting the
Queen?
COLL
(WHISPERS BACK)
Not sure yet.
QUERT
What about the gold he promised us?
NION
What use is gold if you're dangling by
your bony neck, you jackdaw?!
BEITH
Aye, the Queen will flay us alive for
helping her!
(CONTINUED)
75
144 CONTINUED: (2) 144
MUIR
The White Hart blessed the girl.
Nion shakes his head and rolls his eyes, but Beith listens.
MUIR
Even our own legends speak of the
redeemer who will heal the land.
GORT
That little mutton?
MUIR
All the lions and wolves in the kingdom
have tried to defeat the Queen and
failed. Why not a mutton?
The dwarves stare at him incredulously.
NION
Gus lost his life because of her!
MUIR
No. He gave his life for her. As will I
if necessary. Look at us. Look at what
we've become.
They trade looks. They know where he's going with this.
MUIR
We were once proud, now we pilfer and
drink and dream of when we didn't. I am
willing to die for a chance at becoming
the man I once was.
And that is the last word. Quert puts his arm around his
father and kisses his forehead. Beith and Gort trade a nod
and a smile.
QUERT sings a CELTIC MELODY OF LOSS as Gus is laid out on a
funeral pyre. All around him, THE BRIGHT COLORS OF THE
ENCHANTED FOREST HAVE FADED and there are no animals and
fairies to be seen. It's as if Ravenna's shadow has passed
here too. The tough, battle hardened dwarves shed tears like
children. Snow White looks heartbroken as Beith lights the
pyre. As the flames rise, a HAUNTING LAMENT carries us into
the next scene ---
146 OMITTED 146
76
Quert's SONG CONTINUES as the group make their way across the
barren hills and into the mountains --
William walks alongside Snow White, glancing at her tentatively.
He waits until the others are out of earshot.
WILLIAM
I'm sorry I left you.
She looks over and sees the remorse in his eyes.
SNOW WHITE
You didn't.
WILLIAM
If I'd known you were alive I would have
come sooner.
SNOW WHITE
We were children, William. You're here now.
They reach some steep rocks and Eric turns around, offering Snow
White his hand. She takes it and he helps her up the slope.
William looks on, feeling jealous.
Beith follows Duir and Coll up to the summit of the hill, then
looks at the surrounding peaks.
BEITH
We'll rest the night at the top of this
hill.
A FIRE CRACKLES. The dwarves have set up camp. Coll and Duir
sit on a rocky outcrop, Coll braiding Duir's hair while Duir
sharpens his axe.
COLL
That's not how you sharpen an axe. You
sharpen downward. Not upward..

axe.

COLL
Well he taught you wrong.
He raises the axe, only half in jest.
DUIR
You want to test it?
William watches Snow White warming herself by the fire, then
heads over to Eric, who is also keeping watch.
WILLIAM
It's not my place to give you orders. I
misjudged you.
Eric looks up. He shakes William's hand.
ERIC
And I you.
William looks over to where Snow White is.
WILLIAM
We shared a childhood together, before she
was taken away. She hasn't changed. She has
that same light inside her. Surely you can
see it..
Eric looks at her.
ERIC
You'd be blind not to.
WILLIAM
If we can just get her to the castle, the
people.. The people will see it. She's
our only hope, Huntsman.
ERIC
We'll get her to the castle. Don't worry
about that..
WILLIAM
I've thought about her constantly. Every
time I closed my eyes. I can hardly
believe I've found her.
ERIC -
You should tell her. She'd appreciate it.
WILLIAM
I'm afraid to.
ERIC
Not telling someone how you feel and living
with the regret is a lot worse.

Snow White sits on a rock, away from the camp, reflecting
quietly.
She stares out at the surrounding mountains and valleys when
she suddenly senses a presence behind her. She turns in alarm
-- but it's only William.
William smiles back gently and whispers...
WILLIAM
Walk with me.
They walk into the silver birches.
SNOW WHITE
Up here it's as if nothing's changed. The
world looks beautiful again.
WILLIAM
It will be. When you are Queen.
Snow White turns, surprised by his words.
WILLIAM
The people of this kingdom hate Ravenna
with their very fiber.
SNOW WHITE
It's strange, but... I feel only sorrow
for her.
William is taken aback by this but pushes on.
WILLIAM
Once people find out you're alive they
will rise up in your name.
Snow White stares back at him uncertainly.
SNOW WHITE
It takes more than a name. I an not my
father, William.
WILLIAM
You are his daughter. And rightful heir.

He steps closer, gazing into her eyes devotedly.
WILLIAM
If I had a choice, I would take you far
from here. And keep you safe by my side.
But I have a duty. And so do you.
They hold each other's gaze, Snow White still ridden with
doubt.
(CONTINUED)

150a CONTINUED: (2) 150a
SNOW WHITE
How do I inspire? How do I lead men?
WILLIAM
The same way you led me when we were
children. I followed you everywhere. Ran
when you called. I would have done
anything for you.
She looks touched by his words, smiling softly, trying to
make light of them.
SNOW WHITE
That's not how I remember it.
WILLIAM
No?
SNOW WHITE
No...
They gaze into each other's eyes, close enough to kiss.
SNOW WHITE
I remember we were always arguing. And
fighting. And...
She trails off, lost in his gaze. He stops, leans closer and
kisses her gently. They stay like that a moment, then William
pulls away, holding something in his hand. Snow White smiles
as she sees that it's an APPLE.
With a mischievous smile, William holds out the apple for
Snow White, just like he did when they were children.
SNOW WHITE
I remember this trick.
WILLIAM
(With mock innocence)
What trick?
Snow White holds his gaze, then snatches the apple from him
before he can take a bite, raising it to her lips with a
smile. As she bites --

Eric, startled,- awakens.

As Snow White chews, a flicker of a smile crosses William's
face. Snow White stares curiously, then suddenly gasps,
struggling to breathe --
Eric stands up, looks around, dwarves still asleep. He shakes
William, who wakes at the ready.
They walk into the trees and follow --
A SINGLE SET OF TRACKS.
Snow White staggers back and collapses in the snow, choking
from poison. Her eyes water and her vision blurs. The false
William kneels beside her and slowly she sees Ravenna's
features burning through, her cold blue eyes gleaming in
TRIUMPH --
A SCREAM fills the air -- not Snow White but dozens of birds
shrieking in the sky above --
151-157 OMITTED 151-157
Eric and William hear the panicked bird cries and run --
Snow White's limbs are petrified, frost spreading across her
cheeks -- but her eyes are open, taking in everything.
Ravenna leans over her, smiling.
RAVENNA
You see, child, love always betrays us.
A sigh escapes Snow White's lips, condensing into steam.
RAVENNA
By fairest blood it was done and only by
fairest blood can it be undone. You- were
the only one who could break the-spell
and end my life, and the only one pure
enough to save me.
She draws away, unwrapping her sacramental dagger.
RAVENNA
You don't realize how lucky you are,
never to know what it is to grow old.

She raises the knife, about to cut out Snow White's heart -
WHEN SUDDENLY HER BODY SHATTERS INTO A FLOCK OF SHRIEKING
RAVENS --
And now we see the HUNTSMAN STANDING THERE, AXE IN HAND, THE
RAVENS FLAPPING AROUND HIM --
William blasts with a sword at the screeching birds --
Eric goes after her now, swinging his twin hatchets. The
ravens scream and pluck at his eyes but he hacks at them
fiercely, William joining in, until the shrieking birds
finally take to the sky and vanish on the horizon.
Eric and William rush to Snow White's side now. The dwarves
arrive too, hurrying through the snow.
William cradles Snow White in his arms, trying to revive her,
but it's no use. Eric stares in dismay as he sees the poison
drain the color from her lips. He kneels down and gazes at
her. William turns to the dwarves.
WILLIAM
What are you looking at? Help her!
The dwarves stare back at him gravely but don't respond. He's
desperate now, irrational --
WILLIAM
You are dwarves, healers, save her!
He grabs the blind seer, MUIR, shaking him.
WILLIAM
Do something!
Muir stares back at him with his empty eyes, tears glistening
in them.
William collapses in prayer, the light in Snow White's eyes
almost gone. Eric looks over, sees William's grief is as
great as his own, and finally stops fighting.
Snow White looks up at William as if she wants to say
something, then the light in her eyes goes out.
The dwarves are heartbroken. Eric looks dazed.
William leans down and kisses Snow White gently on the lips.
He pulls away,.hoping against hope. And then --
Nothing happens. She lies there, lifeless and white as the
falling snow.
On all the faces - realizing that she is truly gone.

What we promised.

A flock of ravens whips across the sky, swooping into --
A wide shot as the group carries Snow White toward the
castle.
Snow White's body is wrapped in a shroud, laid out on a
funeral board. William leads it with tears in his eyes. Eric
and the dwarves walk alongside the body, all lost in grief.
82A
Eric, carrying all his gear, eyes down, strides toward the
gate and a clean getaway.
ERIC
Open the gate.
PERCY (O.S.)
Huntsman!
Eric stops. He's been recognized. Percy catches up to him.
They share a look and Eric sighs.
PERCY
Yes, I recognized you.
Eric sighs.
PERRY
We have no quarrel with you. Not anymore.
You returned the princess to us. And for
that...
He hands over a heavy sack of gold. Eric takes it, weighs it
in his hand. God does he need it, but...
ERIC
Keep your money.
(CONTINUED)
85
169B CONTINUED: 169B
He hands it back and turns for the now open gate. He exits
the castle and as the doors begin to close --
SHOUTS OF JOY. Eric spins, wanders back to see what the
commotion is all about.
170 OMITTED 170
170a OMITTED 170a
Everyone comes out of their tents and stands beneath Snow
White. Her heart pounding, she makes her way down the
stairs. All are riveted by the sight of her, as if they're
looking on an angel or a living miracle.
Eric makes his way back into the courtyard and he, too, is
stunned as he slides in next to the dwarves in the crowd.
BEITH
It's a miracle!
Duke Hammond, embarrassed and still stunned by the sight of
her, walks up the stairs to greet her. Several Generals
follow him but stay a few steps below them. Hammond takes
her by the hands as they speak.
DUKE HAMMOND
Your highness...
(He can't believe his eyes)
We thought you...
SNOW WHITE
No, my lord.
William, below, stares at her in joy while his father still
looks dazed.

DUKE HAMMOND
You must rest -
SNOW WHITE
I have rested long enough.
Her voice is gentle but full of quiet conviction.
SNOW WHITE
I am ready to ride by your side, my lord,
when you face the Queen in battle.
The Duke looks speechless for a moment.
DUKE HAMMOND
There will be no battle, your highness.
The best thing you can do for your people
is stay safe behind these walls.
SNOW WHITE
That is all I thought to do when I
escaped. But I have come to learn there
is no peace while others suffer. Have you
not learned that?
DUKE HAMMOND
The Queen cannot be defeated. She cannot
be killed. And therefore there can be no
victory.
Snow White hesitates, her heart pounding, then replies:
SNOW WHITE
I can vanquish her. Defeat her. I am the
only one. She told me so herself.
Duke Hammond starts to object, but Snow White's eyes and, now
her feet, lead her down the stairs to her people. When she
reaches the last step - now at their level - she speaks...
SNOW WHITE
I have been told that I represent you,
that it is my place to inspire you. That
is wronct. I am not a Queen, not a
leader, not a warrior.
Absolute silence in the courtyard as people, lords, knights
hang on her every word.
SNOW WHITE
You represent me, who I've become - your
hopes,: your courage, your will - inspires
me.
(BEAT)
I have also been told my place is not to
fight but to stay here, safely behind
these walls. I will not.

I hold life sacred, even more since I've
tasted freedom, but I've lost my fear of
death.

171a CONTINUED: (3) 171a
Heads nod, people murmur approval. She has them in the palm
of her hand.
SNOW WHITE
If Ravenna comes for me, I will ride to
meet her. And if she doesn't, I will ride
to meet her.
(looks back at Generals)
Alone if I must.
(back to people)
But if you would join me, I will gladly
give my life for you. For this land and
its people have lost too much.
Eric and the dwarves couldn't look prouder.
Duke Hammond stares at her for a moment, then BOWS. A beat,
then William follows, then all the Lords and Knights. His
eyes fixed on Snow White, Eric bows too. Then Beith. Then
Muir and his son, Quert. Then Coll and Duir. And finally even
Gort and Nion.
Snow White stands alone, overwhelmed by the faith of the
kneeling warriors, and the responsibility on her shoulders.
The army is amassed and ready to leave the gates. Snow White,
in full armor, sits astride a white horse, her coat of chain
mail glittering in the torchlight. She looks like an angel,
bearing her fathers standard.
Eric rides up next to her. She is happy to see him.
ERIC
Back from the dead and instigating the
masses.
SNOW WHITE
So the Huntsman fights for something
other than himself.
ERIC
Only if you have need of a brutish
soldier.
She smiles, moved. He turns his horse to full back, but
before he leaves...
ERIC
You look fetching in mail.
A bugle sounds and --
88
The Duke's army pours out of the great gate, their torches
blazing in the night. From above, it looks like a river of
lava coursing through the valley. Duke Hammond roars at the
top of his. voice, urging his riders on, and now we see their
vengeful fire spreading across the plain.
Ravenna and the general on the balcony. All around, soldiers
and Guards scurry to look busy lest they draw her wrath
(though some can't help but notice her aging appearance.
Ravenna sweeps away a map held out to her.
RAVENNA
I don't need a map to see you've failed
me, fool, your face is map enough!
BLACK KNIGHT GENERAL
Yes, my Queen.
RAVENNA
Where are they now?
BLACK KNIGHT GENERAL
A half day's march away. Every hour their
numbers grow. Rebels, peasants and
deserters rally to them wherever they -
RAVENNA
Deserters?
BLACK KNIGHT GENERAL
Yes, my Queen.

BLACK KNIGHT GENERAL (cont'd)
They say the King's standard flies again.
And now Ravenna understands -- Snow White.
RAVENNA
Let them come. Let them break their
hearts and skulls on these castle walls
and bring my prize to me. You must not
harm her. I need her heart -- still warm
with blood.
As she strides away. To soldiers --
RAVENNA
Victory comes!
Hammond's army thunders toward the castle. And then they
arrive at --
Horses crest the hill. And now, all around Snow White, we see
her army -- not just Duke Hammond's men -- but REBELS --
PEASANTS -- WOMEN -- all willing to follow her.
Eric and William ride nearby. One of the Duke's commanders
arrives to brief him.
DUKE'S COMMANDER
My lord, we only have a few hours before
the tide comes in. Not long enough to
breach the castle walls. We'll either be
completely exposed or drowned by the ocean.
DUKE HAMMOND
Is there any other way in? Tunnels? Caves?
DUKE'S COMMANDER
No, my lord.
Gloom descends on the gathering.
SNOW WHITE
If we are at the portcullis when the sun
clears the horizon it will be open.
They all look at her.
(CONTINUED)

179 CONTINUED: 179
DUKE HAMMOND
But how?
An unmistakable brown sludge pours out of a sewage tunnel
into the sea. It is the same sewers where Snow White escaped.
We hear the sound of splashing oars and grumbling:
FROM INSIDE THE SEWAGE TUNNEL
We look out at the faces of the dwarves, peering inside.
NION
We're promised gold and volunteer for
manure. How low has the dwarf race sunk?
BEITH
Hi-Ho boys. Off to work.
And they begin to crawl inside.
Ravenna stares out. On the distant cliffs she sees the banners
of the rebel army. A ray of sunlight pours through the clouds,
lighting up the tiny figure of Snow White.
RAVENNA
Come to me.
Coll and Duir wade through the sewage, their axes held up in
front of them, not a flicker of emotion on their faces.
DUIR
Seven dwarves against an army.
COLL
I like them odds.
Behind them, Beith covers his nose from the stench, Gort and
Nion look like they're about to be sick, and Muir and his son
bring up the rear, the brown slime almost at Quert's mouth.
QUERT
Times like this I wish I was taller.
Crashing waves break against the rocks, washing over the sand.
Duke Hammond stares at the RISING TIDE in concern.
DUKE HAMMOND
We don't have much time.
(CONTINUED)
91
183 CONTINUED: 183
SNOW WHITE
Then we should ride now. They'll have the
portcullis up by the time we arrive.
Duke Hammond considers, then raises his sword. Snow white
glances at the huntsman. He breaks rank and rides closer to her.
There's a tense silence, then the Duke BRINGS DOWN HIS SWORD and
his riders charge down the dunes.
Ravenna stares out confidently, her eyes still fixed on Snow
White's distant banner.
The trap door in the courtyard rises and we see Beith's head pop
up, his expert eyes scanning the courtyard until they spot the
portcullis. Ravenna's guards hurry past without seeing him,
taking their positions on the battlements. Beith slips back down
into the sewer.
BEITH
The gatehouse is fifty yards away to left.
Half a dozen guards and fifty armed
soldiers. Archers on either side.
DUIR
(Pulling out a huge knife)
Give us a couple of minutes.
COLL
Four tops.
Snow White rides across the dunes. All around her, riders gallop
along the surf, waves crashing around them. Ravenna's castle
comes into the view, the portcullis still down.
Coll and Duir move stealthily through the busy courtyard, so
small and fleet they're almost invisible.
Ravenna looks on as her archers take their positions and her
artillery men load missiles onto their trebuchets.
Snow White suddenly sees tiny dots of firelight on the castle
walls. Eric realizes what they are and rides faster. The
pinpoints of light soar up in the air, growing larger and
brighter, until we realize they're FIERY MISSILES. Eric forces
Snow White's horse out of the way as a fireball explodes yards
from her.
(CONTINUED)
92
189 CONTINUED: 189
Fire rains down on the Duke's army now, panic spreading in the
ranks. Snow White takes her father's banner and holds it aloft,
rallying the men and riding on.
Two unsuspecting guards collapse outside the gatehouse. Before
the other guards can react, Coll and Duir are on them, moving
fast and hard, the assault over in seconds.
Beith sees Coll and Duir signal from outside the gatehouse.
BEITH
Come on!
Waves crash over the rocks. Fireballs explode in the sand. Snow
White sees men falling all around her, tears welling in her
eyes, but she never falters. As William rides on, he sees the
castle walls through the smoke, the portcullis still down.
On the castle walls, archers replace the trebuchets. Snow White
holds up her shield to protect herself from the sea of arrows.
Up ahead, the portcullis is still down, Duke Hammond's forces
circling back as they're trapped against the walls.
WILLIAM
You must turn back!
SNOW WHITE
I gave my word I would stand with them!
The Duke's army are still circling the gates, stones and hot oil
pouring down on them from above. Arrows slam into Snow White's
shield but she still refuses to retreat.
Snow White sees the portcullis shoot up now, the dwarves hanging
onto the counterweights for dear life. Smiling in relief, she
gallops through the open gates with Eric and William.
The Duke's riders charge into the courtyard. ARCHERS fire at
them from every corner of the castle, but they raise their
shields and leap off their horses, forming a defensive wedge.
From her balcony above the portcullis, Ravenna watches her own
men being slaughtered; she enjoys the spectacle (Ravenna does
not care one bit about those men). Her eyes are locked on Snow
White.
RAVENNA
Let her come to me...ALIVE!
Ravenna's soldiers are merely there to hold Snow White's army
back. She has planned the whole thing, calculated every move.
TORTOISE FORMATION _ SNOW WHITE FIGHTS _ SNOW WHITE LOOKS UP TO
RAVENNA.
SNOW WHITE GOES THROUGH FIRE TO THE SIDE DOOR. -
Like a spider waiting in her web, with no concern about her
soldiers' situation, Ravenna remains calm and calculated.
Ravenna turns around and leaves the balcony to the throne
room.
SNOW WHITE rushes into the castle. As soon as she passes the
door a dozen of Ravenna's men come outside closing the trap.
