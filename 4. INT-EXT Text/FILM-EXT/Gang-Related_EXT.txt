Poor side of town. A few old cars parked on the street. Some
buildings vacant. A LATE MODEL WHITE CADILLAC cruises past.
We HEAR LOUD RAP MUSIC.
The Cadillac pulls into the parking lot. Parks in front of
room SEVEN. Hudd gets out, looks around. Cynthia gets out,
leads him to SEVEN. Knocks.
The curtains pull back. Divinci looks at Hudd and Cynthia.
She nods to him. The door unlocks and opens.
Cynthia enters. Hudd looks around again. Then follows.
Hudd gets into his Cadillac, pulls out of the motel parking
lot.
Deserted. No one on the street this late. Several of the
buildings are boarded up.
Not a great part of the city. Apartment buildings line both
sides of the street. An alley runs between two of the
buildings. A TAXI pulls up in front. HEADLIGHTS SHINING on a
MAN passed out in the street.
Cynthia exits the taxi. The taxi pulls away. She glances at
the man passed out in the street.
His clothes are ragged. He's filthy. His face covered in
beard and greasy dirty hair. Hard to tell how old he is.
Maybe forty. Maybe eighty. Who knows? His hand clutches a
bottle in a bag.
CYNTHIA
Hey, Joe, wake up. Get outa the street
before you get run over. Joe, wake
up!
She nudges him with her foot. The man groans, rolls back.
Dead drunk.
CYNTHIA
You're in the street, Joe. Get outa
the street.
The man, JOE, is silent for a moment, then he starts to crawl --
toward the middle of the street.
CYNTHIA
Other way, Joe.
Joe turns his crawl toward the curb. Cynthia watches him for
a moment. He is truly pathetic.
CYNTHIA
Forget it, Joe. Maybe you're better
off right there. I don't think you'd
even feel it.
Cynthia enters the building next to the alley.
CUT TO:
screeching around a corner and up a drive into a VACANT LOT.
The car skids to a stop and Rodriguez gets out of the driver's
side, slamming the door and storming off. He's out of his
mind.
Divinci gets out quickly, follows him. Rodriguez is so fired
up and scared he can't stop moving.
RODRIGUEZ
SHIT, FUCK, SHIT, JESUS CHRIST!
DIVINCI
Calm down!
RODRIGUEZ
WE'RE DEAD, WE'RE FUCKING DEAD!
DIVINCI
SHUT UP!
RODRIGUEZ
FUCK, FUCK, FUCK!
Divinci catches Rodriguez, tries to stop him from flailing
about.
DIVINCI
STOP IT! YOU HEAR ME, RIGHT NOW,
STOP IT!
RODRIGUEZ
GOD, GOD, THIS IS REALLY FUCKIN' OUT
OF CONTROL!
Rodriguez tries to push Divinci away, but Divinci holds on.
They struggle --
RODRIGUEZ
LET GO OF ME!
-- pushing, shoving, falling to the dirt. Divinci jumps on
top of him, pulling his pistol and shoving it into Rodriguez
mouth.
DIVINCI
Shut up and listen to me!
Rodriguez glares up at Divinci.
DIVINCI
They could be watchin' us right now
you asshole. So fuckin' shape up!
You got it?!
(nothing from Rodriguez)
I want you to nod!
It takes Rodriguez a moment, but he nods. Divinci pulls his
gun out of Rodriguez' mouth, gets off him and holsters his
pistol. Rodriguez is scared to death, not of Divinci, of the
mess they're in. He just lies in the dirt.
DIVINCI
Get the fuck up!
Rodriguez starts to get to his feet. Divinci grabs him, yanks
him up. Pushes him to the car.
DIVINCI
Get in the car!
They move back to the car. Rodriguez gets back into the
driver's seat. Divinci moves around to the passenger side.
Gets in, slams the door shut.
Rodriguez and Divinci are sitting on the car, each with a
beer and sharing a bottle of whiskey.
DIVINCI
All they want is someone to go down
for the crime, right? Do we care who
goes down for the crime? Fuck no. As
long as someone goes down for the
crime. It's a slot that's gotta be
filled.
Rodriguez is calmer, but still something bothers him --
RODRIGUEZ
We killed a cop, doesn't that bother
you?
DIVINCI
Of course it bothers me. What d'you
want me to do, turn myself in? Well
I'm not. That's the risk we take
everyday, somebody might pop us,
especially undercover like that. So
he got popped. It happens.
RODRIGUEZ
Not by other cops!
DIVINCI
I patted him down! He wasn't wearin'
a wire, he had no badge, no gun, how
was I supposed to know?!
A moment of silence, then --
DIVINCI
Look, I feel just as bad as you do,
but we gotta start thinkin' about us
here. The important thing is we don't
lose control of the case. We can
never lose control of the case.
Whatever evidence there is goes
through us. We lay down the trail.
Make it nice and logical. We're the
teachers and two and two can add up
to five if it's our classroom.
RODRIGUEZ
What're you talkin' about, are you
sayin' we stick somebody with this?
DIVINCI
Evidence points wherever we want it
to point. Shit, we can provide so
much evidence, even the asshole we
pick will think he fuckin' killed
him.
RODRIGUEZ
You got some asshole in mind?
DIVINCI
Just don't worry. We'll find a killer.
There's lots of 'em out there.
CUT TO:
THREE AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUTHS, all in their twenties, are
hanging on a street corner. Talking. Normal street traffic.
They give a long hard look to an ATTRACTIVE AFRICAN AMERICAN
WOMAN who walks past. A little chatter.
The UNMARKED CAR suddenly screeches to the curb. The black
youths scatter quickly as Divinci jumps out and goes after
the tallest of the three. His name is JAMES. Rodriguez guns
the car and gives chase on wheels.
James darts across traffic. Divinci running hard after him.
Rodriguez spins the car in a u-turn. Racing after them.
James darts down the alley. Narrow, dark, lined with trash
bins. Divinci turns into the alley, but he isn't going to
catch him.
James is almost to the end when the car turns into the alley,
skidding to a stop. Rodriguez jumps out, gun leveled at James.
No where for him to go. He slows down. Rodriguez moves in
from his front, Divinci runs up from behind. James is
disgusted.
JAMES
What the hell'd I do now?
CUT TO:
SLAMMING INTO A WALL, hitting hard, falling back to the dirty
garbage covered alley. He's about twenty-seven, thin, blond
hair tied in a pony tail. He wears a flannel shirt, jeans,
boots. He doesn't want to fight. His name is DAVE.
DAVE
Alright, alright, alright... shit. I
ain't gonna fight you.
He looks up at Divinci and Rodriguez moving toward him.
CUT TO:
MOURNERS gathered around the grave site. WIFE in tears. MOTHER
in tears. The men trying their best to hold up. Beyond the
family, DEA AGENTS. Simms among them. A show of support and
solidarity. A REVEREND delivering --
REVEREND
-- and it is too easy to say that he
was a good man in his job because he
gave more than most. And it's too
easy to say that he was a good man
in his community because he gave
more than others. And it's too easy
to say he was a good man at home
with his family because he was always
there when they needed him. Special
Agent Lionel Hudd was not just a
good man, he was an extraordinary
man. And his death shall not be in
vain.
CAMERA FINDS Divinci and Rodriguez at the back. Rodriguez
looks nervous. Divinci notices. Their conversation is quiet.
DIVINCI
Don't Humpty Dumpty on me.
RODRIGUEZ
What's that mean?
DIVINCI
Your cracks are startin' to show.
RODRIGUEZ
(covering)
Bullshit.
Divinci sees Simms approaching from the side.
DIVINCI
Get your balance. Here comes the
King.
Rodriguez glances toward Simms as he walks up. The
conversation is quiet. Not wanting to disturb the ceremony.
SIMMS
Glad you came... Anything break?
Divinci glances at Rodriguez.
DIVINCI
Nothin' to brag about. But we've got
a couple new leads we're followin'.
SIMMS
...Look, normally we'd be all over
this, but your Captain seems to think
you can do the job. It's your
territory. I guess you know it better
than anybody. And that can be worth
a lot. But you understand... we won't
wait forever.
Divinci is pissed. He doesn't like Simms.
DIVINCI
Just outa curiosity... What happened
to his backup? You guys use backup
on undercover don't you?
SIMMS
It was a new lead. Hudd was afraid
backup would blow his cover. He was
supposed to check in ten minutes
after the deal went down. He never
checked in.
RODRIGUEZ
We want this one as bad as you do. A
cop's a cop. We're in this together,
right?
Simms stares at Rodriguez and Divinci for a moment, then he
returns his attention to the ceremony.
SIMMS
That's why I asked you to come here.
Just so you knew that.
CUT TO:
Rodriguez and Divinci walk down the street, hot dogs in hand,
returning to their car parked curbside.
DIVINCI
He didn't have backup. You believe
that?! Jesus what a dick.
RODRIGUEZ
I don't think we should criticize
that particular decision of his.
DIVINCI
I don't care what the reasons are,
you don't play Lone Fuckin' Ranger
on a drug buy. You're just askin'
for it. That's all I'm sayin'.
RODRIGUEZ
I don't trust those bastards. They're
not waitin' for us. That's bullshit.
They're runnin' their own
investigation. I know it!
DIVINCI
Let 'em. The gun, the coke came from
evidence. The car came from impound.
So what's to find?
RODRIGUEZ
That's what I'm afraid of. There's
nothing for them to find. We were
too good.
DIVINCI
So what're you worried about?
RODRIGUEZ
Nobody is that fuckin' good.
Divinci looks at Rodriguez, then smiles.
DIVINCI
Except us.
CUT TO:
Divinci exits the building. Starts to cross the street to
his car parked on the opposite side when he HEARS SOMETHING
BEHIND him. He turns, instantly reaching for his pistol.
A drunk staggers out of the alley -- looks like he has a gun
in his hand.
Divinci instinctively raises his gun to shoot when --
THE LIGHT -- catches the object in the drunk's hand -- a
BROWN BOTTLE, the neck sticking ahead like the barrel of a
gun.
DIVINCI
(lowers gun)
You fuckin' idiot.
The drunk stops when he hears the voice. Looks through his
matted greasy hair that cascades in front of his eyes. Now
we recognize Joe.
Divinci turns away, disgusted. Opens his car door, then stops.
Caught in a thought. He turns back and looks at Joe again.
Joe stumbles back into the DARKNESS OF THE ALLEY. Lies down
next to a trash bin. LIGHTS suddenly illuminate Joe. Joe
squints as a CAR moves right up to him. Joe shields the light
with an arm.
We HEAR the DOOR OPEN and CLOSE, then Divinci bends down
into the LIGHT. He is wearing a BASEBALL CAP backwards on
his head. And GLOVES on his hands. He reaches inside Joe's
JACKET POCKET.
DIVINCI
What've we got here?
He pulls out the Smith and Wesson .44. Divinci looks at Joe.
DIVINCI
Where were you last Friday night?
Confused, Joe looks up at Divinci through matted hair.
CUT TO:
The LOCATION of HUDD'S MURDER. The street is empty. Quiet.
Divinci stops his car next to where Hudd died.
A MAN standing in the street ahead of him.
Joe watches from the street, then looks at the .44 in his
hand.
BACK INSIDE THE MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Rodriguez leans into Joe who is now sitting on the edge of
the bed, looking down at the .44 in his hand.
RODRIGUEZ
Then what did you do?
Joe is in the street again. He doesn't know what he did.
BACK INSIDE THE MOTEL ROOM
Divinci leans close to Joe from behind now.
DIVINCI
You ran.
And now Joe can imagine it. We PUSH INTO JOE'S EYES.
BACK TO THE STREET
as Joe turns and runs. As fast as he can away from the death.
He looks back over his shoulder, scared.
JOE'S VOICE
I didn't mean to...
BACK INSIDE THE MOTEL ROOM
Joe is staring at the gun. Divinci and Rodriguez watch him.
WILLIAM
He was going to hit me... I was
scared... he was going to hit me.
Rodriguez looks at Divinci.
DIVINCI
That's why you shot him.
WILLIAM
That's why I...
JOE - BACK ON THE STREET - NIGHT
AIMS the gun again at the APPROACHING CAR.
JOE'S VOICE
...shot him.
And we HEAR the GUN SHOT AGAIN, shattering the silence as we --
CUT TO:
A small yellow Toyota with a bashed up left fender pulls to
the curb. Cynthia gets out lugging her purse and a bag of
groceries. We HEAR ANOTHER CAR DOOR SHUT. She turns. Divinci
is walking across the street from his car toward her.
CYNTHIA
It's the middle of the day.
Divinci gives her a look as he takes the grocery bag from
her.
DIVINCI
Just talk.
CYNTHIA
Since when?
Divinci leads the way into the apartment building.
walking quickly down the steps.
RODRIGUEZ
The Dunner gun, you used the fucking
Dunner gun?!
DIVINCI
This is not my fuck up! Our shooting
was supposed to be gang-related and
unsolved! Only because we tagged a
goddamn undercover cop do we need
the fucking .44 for evidence!
Otherwise, we never woulda needed
it. So don't point your finger at
me!
RODRIGUEZ
Alright, alright... But how are we
supposed to explain how the same gun
was used in two murder cases by two
different killers when it was supposed
to be in police custody?!
DIVINCI
We don't explain it. It's not our
fault they lost the evidence.
Ballistics are already complete in
Dunner's case. All we need is another
gun.
CUT TO:
BRIEFCASE - ALLEY - DAY
as it opens, revealing a DOZEN different HANDGUNS.
THE GUN SELLER
All my merchandise is in top
condition. Untraceable. The best
money can buy.
A BLACK MAN in a three piece suit, picks up the .44 with a
GLOVED HAND. His accent is British.
THE GUN SELLER
It's got good knock down, but it's
slow. Unless you have a preference
for revolvers, I suggest a nine
millimeter auto. They are more
expensive, but what they cost in
money, they save in time.
Rodriguez and Divinci look down at the gun.
DIVINCI
The .44.
The gun seller eyes them for a moment.
RODRIGUEZ
What?
THE GUN SELLER
You look like police.
Divinci and Rodriguez stare at the gun seller. Then he smiles.
THE GUN SELLER
No offense.
CUT TO:
TWO MURDER VICTIMS lying in the street. POLICE OFFICERS have
the area under control. A few CURIOUS PEOPLE have stopped to
watch. An UNMARKED CAR pulls up. Stops.
A BLACK CONVERTIBLE MERCEDES pulls into the circular, gated
drive of the large two story home on immense manicured
grounds. A BMW is parked in front of the FOUR CAR GARAGE. It
is being waxed by car care specialists. The Mercedes stops
and a MAN gets out. He has gray hair and expensive clothes.
He carries a briefcase and heads for the front door. His
name is ARTHUR BAYLOR.
A BUTLER shows Arthur to the patio where another MAN, NATHAN
MCCALL, is seated behind a table, reviewing documents. McCall
is fifty-five, wears glasses.
BUTLER
Mr. Baylor is here.
McCall looks up, smiles.
WILLIAM
Arthur.
Arthur crosses. The two men shake hands.
ARTHUR
Nathan. How are you?
WILLIAM
Good, Arthur, thanks. Would you like
some coffee, juice.
ARTHUR
No, I'm fine.
WILLIAM
Well, this is all a bit of a mystery.
You certainly got my attention with
your phone call. What's this all
about?
Arthur removes a NEWSPAPER from his briefcase. Opens it.
Revealing the PHOTOGRAPH OF JOE and the headline: UNDERCOVER
COP GUNNED DOWN BY UNDERCOVER KILLER. McCall looks at the
paper.
WILLIAM
Is there something you want me to
see?
Arthur points at the photograph. McCall looks. A beat, then --
WILLIAM
Oh my God.
CUT TO:
A seedy side street near the courthouse and jail. The unmarked
car pulls up and Divinci gets out.
Joe is lead to a waiting prison van. He gets inside.
BAILIFF'S VOICE
The People versus William McCall in
case number 95-24705.
The van pulls away.
CUT TO:
THE .44 SMITH AND WESSON (CLYDE'S .44)
as it is introduced into evidence.
HELEN
-- when he pulled this gun and fired
at the driver of the car. Killing
him instantly. Let the record show
that this is the weapon used in the
crime, a Smith and Wesson forty-four
caliber handgun.
Cynthia comes out of a ALL NIGHT MINI-MART with a bag of
food. She walks down the street and suddenly we HEAR a
GUNSHOT. Followed by a CAR CRASH. She turns toward the sound.
And we HEAR RUNNING FOOTSTEPS. Then we see a man running. He
has a pistol in one hand.
Cynthia watches the man run past and disappear into the
darkness.
CUT BACK TO:
Rodriguez gets out of the car. Divinci pulls away, driving
into traffic. Rodriguez heads into the Station.
CUT TO:
Rodriguez is outside the Station. Looking nervous and upset.
The unmarked car pulls up. Rodriguez moves for the car. He
gets in and the car pulls away.
Manny walks out of the jail building. Cynthia is with him.
CYNTHIA
I don't understand. Why can't you
tell me who put up the bond?
MANNY
Look, a guy comes in, says bail her
out, gives me the money, I do it.
That's how I make my living, I bail
fuckin' people outa jail. You wait
with me.
CYNTHIA
Was it a cop?
MANNY
Yeah, right. Cops bail people outa
jail all the time. Doesn't there
seem to be a dichotomy there for
you?
CYNTHIA
I don't like this.
MANNY
You wanna stay in jail, that's up to
you. Or you come with me.
CYNTHIA
What'd he look like?
MANNY
You're a stripper right? Lotta guys
fall in love with your type. But
they don't know how to get close,
know what I mean? Somebody wants you
to owe them something.
(shrugs)
Take it or leave it.
Manny starts down the steps. Cynthia hesitates, then follows.
The unmarked car turns off the street onto the side street
and stops. The lights go out.
RODRIGUEZ
Frank --
DIVINCI
Talk to me, okay? Just fuckin' talk
to me.
Rodriguez hesitates a moment, then --
RODRIGUEZ
I don't know... I owe some money. I
don't know how I'm gonna pay it...
DIVINCI
You gambling again?
RODRIGUEZ
Yeah, yeah... I just couldn't...
Frank... let's forget about this.
Let's just get the fuck outa here.
We got enough money, let's go. We'll
get outa the country or something.
Divinci turns toward Rodriguez. And he's got his pistol out.
RODRIGUEZ
What the hell're you doin'?!
DIVINCI
Take off your shirt.
RODRIGUEZ
What're you talkin' about?
DIVINCI
Just take off your shirt. If there's
nothin' to worry about, then I'll
apologize. But I'm not gonna argue.
Take off your fuckin' shirt now.
RODRIGUEZ
What is this, you piece of shit?!
You don't trust me?! Is that it?!
YOU DON'T FUCKIN' TRUST ME AFTER ALL
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH?!
DIVINCI
...Take off your shirt.
RODRIGUEZ
Fuck you, you don't trust me.
DIVINCI
I'm askin' you one more time.
RODRIGUEZ
You wanna shoot me? Shoot me.
Divinci hesitates. He doesn't want to. This is his partner.
A beat, then he lowers his gun.
DIVINCI
Okay, I'm sorry. You're right. I'm
fuckin' nervous. Like you. Forget
it. This thing... shit. Let's just
get it over with.
Divinci holsters his gun. Rodriguez hesitates, breathes a
sigh, then returns to the car. They both get back in.
The car tears away, leaving Rodriguez alone in the alley.
CUT TO:
THE KEY - INSERTED INTO THE DOOR LOCK - NIGHT
Rodriguez pushes open the door to his apartment, enters.
Shuts the door. Stands alone in the room for a moment, then
suddenly erupts in rage. Ripping off his coat, ripping off
his shirt, ripping off the tape recorder taped to his chest.
He throws the recorder on the ground. Stomps on it until
it's shattered into pieces. He stares at the broken recorder.
MAN'S VOICE (VIC)
I guess we caught you at a bad time.
Rodriguez spins around. Vic steps into the moonlight streaming
in through the window. Behind him is Cutless Supreme.
VIC
But we all have problems.
Rodriguez suddenly YELLS and CHARGES THEM. He tackles Vic.
But in the darkness we can't see anything. Until the explosion
of a GUN and the FLASH of flames lights up the room. A moment
of silence then --
VIC
Oh shit. You shot him, you fuckin'
shot him!
Two men stumble to the door. Leaving one on the floor. The
door is flung open and Vic runs out. Followed by Cutless
Supreme.
CUT TO:
A car pulls up in front.
REPORTERS swarm around Arthur and Joe as they exit the
courthouse.
REPORTERS
How does it feel to be a free man
again?
Arthur and Joe head down the steps to a waiting LIMOUSINE.
REPORTERS
Do you remember everything that
happened to you? What are your plans?
WILLIAM
I just want to go back to work.
REPORTERS
As a surgeon?
WILLIAM
Yes.
REPORTERS
What about the signed confession,
did the police coerce you into signing
it?
ARTHUR
I'm sorry, no more questions.
They get into the back of the waiting limo and it pulls away.
The limousine is parked curbside. Nathan and Arthur wait.
Watching Joe walk across the lawn. He stops, looking down.
The grave stones are for his wife and two children. He sits
down beside them. It's very near where Agent Hudd was buried.
CUT TO:
Giant party in progress. Expensive cars parked along the
drive.
The neon blares as usual.
An AMBULANCE races up to the EMERGENCY entrance.
pulls up in front of the office. Tinted windows.
The Lincoln idles at the curb. Divinci and Manny exit the
office. Divinci glances up and down the street as they move
toward the car. Manny opens the back door. Nobody inside.
DIVINCI
I think I'll let you live.
MANNY
You are a real prince. Now how about
my money?
Divinci hands Manny a wad of cash from his pocket, then gets
into the back of the car.
DIVINCI
You never saw me.
MANNY
Don't I wish that were true.
He closes the door. The Lincoln pulls away. Manny watches it
move off down the street.
MANNY
Have a nice trip.
