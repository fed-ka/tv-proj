      Scott sits on the roof under the light of the moon, keeping 
      vigil over the house. He s clearly been there a long time, 
      however. His heavy eyelids flutter as he fights off sleep.

      Head nodding forward, he snaps it up, blinking. Shaking off 
      the tiredness, he takes a breath and continues his watch.

      But a moment later, his head sinks down again. As his chin 
      hits his chest, Scott falls asleep. And falls right off the 
      roof.           TEEN WOLF "Episode 111"BLUE DRAFT2/13/1114.

      Cars pour into the school parking lot flooding with teenagers 
      in formal dresses, suits and ties. The dance has begun.


      Stiles helps Lydia out of his Jeep as Jackson and Allison 
      approach.

                                  LYDIA
                    Jackson. You look handsome.

                      Obviously. It s Hugo Boss.*

      He takes Allison in his arm, leading her to the entrance 
      while Lydia fumes.

                                  LYDIA
                    I don t care. I don t need 
                      compliments. I m not falling prey 
                    to society s desire to turn girls 
                    into emotionally insecure neurotics 
                    who pull up their dresses at the 
                    first flattering remark.

                                  STILES
                    I think you look beautiful.

                    Really?


      Stumbling outside, Jackson twists the cap off the bottle of 
      Vodka to take a last shot. But it s empty. Pissed, he hurls 
      it to the parking lot, paying no attention to where it flies.

      He hears the CRASH of breaking glass.

      Gazing to the direction of the sound, he spots a car now 
      covered in broken glass from the shattered bottle. His own 
      Porsche.*

      Jackson let s loose a STRANGLED CRY OF FRUSTRATION.

      But then FLASHES OF RED grab his attention. His eyes snap 
      toward the woods beyond the parking lot. Stepping past cars, 
      he peers into the darkness and sees it again. 

      TWO PINPOINTS OF RED LIGHT in the darkness. Like glowing red 
      eyes...

                                                                          FADE OUT:

      Tearing down a dark path, slapping away the branches at his 
      face, Jackson searches desperately for the Alpha.

                                    JACKSON
                    Come on. Do it. I know you re here.

      He spins around, eyes blinking, unable to adjust to the 
      darkness. All he can see are shadows and--

      Movement. Vague and undefined. Something is out there.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    Come on. Come and get me.

      FLASHES OF RED. He spins, racing for the glowing eyes. But he 
      trips on a tree root and goes sprawling into the dirt and 
      leaves, his perfect suit muddied.

      Dragging himself up, he lurches forward pathetically.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    Come on!
                          (desperate)
                    I want to be like you. I want to be 
                    one of you. Please.

      But then those flashes of red light become BEAMS OF RED. 
      Laser sightings attached to the barrels of guns. 

      Argent steps out of the shadows with Tyhurst behind him. He 
      kneels down to look at the boy.

                                  ARGENT
                      Unfortunately, Jackson, I don t 
                    think I can give you what you want. 
                    But I have a feeling you might be 
                    able to help me.

      He reaches out a hand to help the boy back to his feet.


      Argent walks Jackson back to the parking lot, a fatherly arm 
      around his shoulder.

                                    JACKSON
                    You promise? You won t hurt him?

                                  ARGENT
                    Of course not. He s just a kid.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 111"BLUE DRAFT2/13/1136.

      But Jackson lingers, guilt and regret, two very unfamiliar 
      emotions to him, somehow surfacing to give him pause.

                                    JACKSON
                    What are you going to do?

                                  ARGENT
                    I m going to take care of it. Go 
                    back to the dance, Jackson. Be with 
                    your friends. Be a normal teenager.

      Jackson backs away from him, heading inside as--

      Just a few yards past them, Lydia steps out another door. 
      Hugging herself in the cold, she glances around the quiet 
      parking lot. She spots the broken pieces of glass on the 
      Porsche, then starts down the steps.*

                                  LYDIA
                          (calling out)
                    Jackson?


      Wandering past the parking lot and toward the almost pitch 
      black lacrosse field, Lydia spots a FIGURE moving in the 
      darkness.

                                  LYDIA
                    Jackson?

      She hurries forward, but the figure moves as well, 
        disappearing into the blackness.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    Jackson? Hey!


      Stumbling in her heels, Lydia finds herself in the middle of 
      the lacrosse field. She gazes out, struggling to see in the 
      darkness.

                                  LYDIA
                    Jackson? Is that you?

      Turning around, she seems to be all alone, out in the middle 
      of the field. But then she pauses.

      SOMEONE walks toward her. Stepping right out of the darkness, 
      walking with calm and purpose.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                          (softly)
                    Jackson?

      But it s not him. Lydia slowly retreats back as the stranger 
      approaches.

                    Lydia!

      She whips around, seeing Stiles racing toward her.

                    Run! Lydia, run!

      But strangely breathless, she simply turns back to see Peter 
      Hale calmly approaching. Taking a single step back, she seems 
      unable to look away from Peter as--

      His mouth opens impossibly wide, jaw protruding out as 
      monstrous fangs appear between his lips and--

      Lydia screams.

                                                                          FADE OUT:

      Lydia drops to the grass in the lacrosse field, unconscious, 
      the side of her dress covered with BLOOD.

      Stiles races to her, but Peter lunges forward with an arm 
      reaching over body. Clawed hand to the ground in front of 
      her, he s like an animal claiming its kill.

      Stiles stares in shock at the blood dripping from the man s 
      jaws.

                      particularly acrid scent, Stiles. 
                    So how about you tell me the truth 
                    before I rip her apart.

                    I don t know. I swear to God, I 
                    don t.

      Hand to the back of Lydia s neck, Peter lifts her up, closer 
      and closer to his teeth. Frightened tears welling at his 
      eyes, Stiles can t pull his gaze from Lydia s bloody dress.

                                  STILES (CONT D)

      The door to the school clatters open, Scott and Allison *

                    This way.

      Taking him by the lapels of his coat, she pulls him off the 
      steps. They kiss again and again, moving away from the school 
      until Scott finally breaks away to gasp out a few words.

                                  SCOTT

      Scott stops. Hands still holding his, Allison nearly trips 
      over her dress from the abrupt halt.

      Hands intertwined in his, she keeps pulling him closer to the 
      bus. Almost magnetically drawn to her, each time she kisses 
      him, he finds himself moving forward another step.

                                  SCOTT
                    You sure this is a good idea?

      She steps closer, whispering in his ear.

                    I really hate when you say things 
                    like that.

      She laughs, enjoying his agonized response while pulling him 
      ever closer to the door of the bus.

                    We should go back to the dance.

      His eyes glance to the shadows in the parking lot, searching 
      for movement even as--

      She pulls open the door and hurries inside. He watches her 
      through the windows, stepping past the seats, smiling down at 
      him.

      All other worries forgotten, he watches her playfully urge 
      him onto the bus with a guiding finger.

      Finally, he turns to head for the door to the bus. But--

      TIRES SCREECH across the pavement, a truck grinding to a halt 
      just between the buses. Tyhurst sits in the driver s seat, 
      engine REVVING with a threatening growl.

      Scott steps back. Then spins around to see an SUV skidding to 
      a stop at the other end.

      Argent looks out from behind the wheel, staring right at 
      Scott. The two trucks trapping him in between the buses.

      Behind the wheel of the SUV, Argent doesn t reveal an ounce 
      of emotion even as he drives his foot into the pedal, 
      FLOORING THE VEHICLE right toward Scott.

      Tyhurst does the same. Wheels spinning on the pavement, the 
      TRUCK BULLETS forward.

      Allison SCREAMS as the two vehicles SMASH into each other. 
      When she opens her eyes, she sees an impossible sight...

      One foot on the hood of Tyhurst s truck, the other on 
      Argent s SUV, Scott stands there, having jumped up just in 
      time.

      But his sudden display of supernatural reflexes has resulted 
      in an unfortunate side effect...

      He s transformed. 

      With YELLOW EYES and FANGS still growing to their full length 
      between his lips, Scott turns his gaze from Argent s look of
