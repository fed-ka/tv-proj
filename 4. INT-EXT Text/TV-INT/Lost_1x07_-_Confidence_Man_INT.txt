      -- and, in LOUD, vocal response to Kate s comment --

                                    JESSICA
                    OH YEAH, BABY, YEAH--!!!

      -- a SILHOUETTED COUPLE in the throes of passion: it s SAWYER 
      and JESSICA (32), as attractive as she is acrobatic --

                                  SAWYER 
                    -- I LOVE YOU --!!!

      -- and we avoid most Standards and Practices issues with this 
      GOLDEN AFTERNOON BACKLIGHT: we barely see them at all.  But 
      gimme a break -- it s clear what s up.  So to speak.

      CUT TO VARIOUS SHOTS: HIS JEANS ON THE FLOOR.  HER BRA AND 
      DRESS.  A PAPER-WRAPPED BOUQUET OF FLOWERS (From Sawyer?  
      Wow, that s unlike him...)  And that s when we HEAR A BLOODY-
      MURDER-SCREAM of female ecstasy --

      -- and they both collapse, breathless, sweaty, and HAPPY.

                                    JESSICA
                    ...boy oh boy...

                                  SAWYER
                    ...Boy oh boy is right...

      He laughs, kissing her hand.  Still catching their breath, he 
      looks at her.  Touches her face.  Uncharacteristically sweet.

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    ...look at you.
                          (then, with a smile)
                    What do you want?  Right now.

      Staring at him, her eyes actually fill up.  Quietly:

                                  JESSICA
                    How could I want anything else...?

      Sawyer hugs her.  Kisses her.  Holds her tight.  She 
      obviously means a great deal to him.  But she sees something:

              JESSICA (CONT D)SAWYER
      Uh-oh, Baby--
                                                  What?

              JESSICA (CONT D)SAWYER
    I thought you had a meeting--
                                                  Yeah, it s not until six-
                                                    thirty--

                                    JESSICA (CONT D)
                    Baby, it s six-twenty-eight.

      And Sawyer bolts back -- sees the time --

                                  SAWYER
                    Are you --?  Oh, damnit -- damnit -- 
                    Honey, listen to me--

      Jessica smiles: post-coital bliss.

                                    JESSICA
                    Go, you go, I ll stay here, watch 
                    TV, order room service, get fat--

      Sawyer kisses her stomach -- then bounds for the closet, 
      pulling up his pants.

                                  SAWYER
                    You order a chocolate sundae.  When 
                    I get back I ll use you as a dish.

      Jessica laughs, sitting up, sheets covering her breasts as 
      Sawyer pulls down a SUITCASE, which FALLS, SPILLS OPEN -- 
      Jessica looks over to see the case... FILLED WITH CASH.

      Awkward.  Sawyer freezes.  Jessica is shocked.  Sawyer stands 
      there, motionless and guilty.  He avoids her gaze - but 
      finally his eyes meet hers.  And all he can muster is:

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    ...You, uh... weren t exactly 
                    supposed to see that.

      And on the shock and oddity of the moment, we re BACK ON:



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "Confidence Man"     (NETWORK DRAFT)     9/8/04     4.




    A small amount of PEROXIDE spills onto a cloth in the hands 
      of JACK.  Sitting outside what we ll call THE INFIRMARY CAVE, 
      Jack cleans a nasty HEAD WOUND on --

                                  SAYID
                    I can do this myself...

                                  JACK
                    You ready to tell me what happened?*

      SAYID remains focused, denying himself the pain.  We stay 
      CLOSE -- this conversation feels private, CONSPIRATORIAL.

                                  SAYID*
                    We were trying to triangulate the *
                      transmission.  The French woman.*
                          (OW; but talks on)*
                    I saw the flare from the beach -- 
                    Then the flare from Sawyer s 
                    position in the jungle.  I turned 
                    on my antenna, activated the 
                      transceiver, then -- darkness.
                          (intense)*
                    Whoever hit me came from behind.



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "Confidence Man"     (NETWORK DRAFT)     9/8/04     5.
      (CONT'D):44


                                  JACK
                    They destroyed the equipment?

                                  SAYID
                          (that motherfucker)
                    Yes.

                        JACKSAYID
      Any idea who it...?
                                                  -- A coward.

                                  JACK
                    We ll figure this out, man.  Don t 
                    do anything that...

      And when Sayid looks at Jack, there is an ANGER -- a FIRE 
      that we have not seen in his eyes before.

                                  SAYID
                    I will do what I need to do to find 
                    the man responsible.

      ON JACK as that sinks in for a moment before -- A SHOUT 
      echoes through the caves --

                                    WOMAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Where s the doctor?!  Help us!  
                    Please!!!

      Jack rushes out to see a frantic WOMAN hobbling in.  Her name 
      is MARYBETH (40 s, pretty.)

      Marybeth breathes heavily -- the result of supporting her 
      beaten and bloody husband, whom we recognize as Richard: last 
      seen pillaging Sawyer s stash.

      Jack ducks under Richard s arm and helps him to the cave:

                                  JACK
                    Who did this to you?

      And with fierce determination, the man manages a single word--

                                    RICHARD
                    Sawyer.

      And OFF JACK --*

                                        ACT ONE


      Sitting on a ledge, Jack dabs another cloth infused with 
      peroxide on a cut over Richard s eye.  Richard winces:

                                    RICHARD
                    I m fine.  It s just a scrape.*

                                  JACK
                    Lots of scrapes today.  I m running 
                    out of peroxide.

                                    RICHARD
                    I should ve been able to take him.  
                      Sonofabitch fights dirty.

                                  JACK
                    -- yeah, I ve seen that -- so you *
                    wanna tell me what happened?

      Richard points out MARYBETH, at the stream with HURLEY.

                                    RICHARD
                      Marybeth s - my wife s - asthma.
                          (off Jack s look)
                    I packed a few inhalers for our *
                    trip.  Marybeth said put them in my *
                    carry-on, but I said - hey - 
                      vacation s over, we re on the 
                    plane, she can t need more than the 
                    one - right?
                          (beat)
                    The one ran out yesterday.  So I m 
                    scouring the wreckage - Marybeth s 
                    freaking - and then I see that 
                    bastard Sawyer just sitting there *
                    reading  Watership Down. 

                                  JACK
                    You re losing me...

                                    RICHARD
                       Watership Down.   It s a book.  It *
                    was in our luggage -- the stuff we *
                    checked.  Looked for the last week, *
                    but we couldn t find it.*
                          (before Jack can ask)
                    If he s got my book, then he s got *
                    my suitcase.  He s got my suitcase, 
                    he s got the inhalers.  If she has *
                    an attack...*

      Richard STOPS.  Looks up at Jack, complete desperation in his  *
      eyes:

                                  RICHARD (CONT D)
                    It ll be bad, man.*

      And we re TIGHT ON JACK -- The look in his eyes makes it *
      clear that he is ready to DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT -- *


      The SUITCASE FULL OF CASH.  Over this we HEAR:

                JESSICA (O.S.)SAWYER (O.S.)
      You told me you were going to I am -- Jess, this isn t 
      Baton Rouge to close a deal -- exactly the kind of thing 
      you said it was  too boring that s easy to describe--
      to explain --

      And we see SAWYER AND JESSICA -- she s in a bra and panties, 
      he s in his jeans, shirtless:

                                  SAWYER
                    Just trust me.  There isn t time to 
                    explain.  I m already late and if I 
                    don t make this meeting, this whole 
                    thing s a bust, all right?

      SILENCE.  The two just stare.  Sawyer feels guilty... and 
      then -- because he likes her -- he reluctantly decides  fine 
      at the risk of losing it all, here it is: 

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    Ever heard of Incentive Law?

      Of course not.  He sighs, and then, in a kind, quiet voice:

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    Encourages foreign business here in 
                    New Orleans -- Tax breaks.  Shared 
                    investments.  The government sets 
                    up these private funds.  To 
                    supplement foreign trade.

                                  JESSICA
                    Do I need an Economics degree to 
                    understand why you have a suitcase 
                    full of cash?





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "Confidence Man"     (NETWORK DRAFT)     9/8/04     11.

                                  SAWYER
                    You re looking at everything.  
                      Everything I got.  Hundred and 
                    forty thousand dollars.

      She watches him.  Though that s a lot of money, her reaction, 
      her lack of shock at that number, tells us a lot.  She s
      familiar with money.  Sawyer s almost sad as he speaks:

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    There s an oil mining operation in 
                    the Gulf of Mexico -- drilling 
                      platforms.  Three-hundred thousand 
                    dollars buys you one share.
                          (beat)
                    But as soon as you make that 
                      investment, that fund kicks in and 
                    triples your investment in two 
                    weeks.  Triples it.

                                    JESSICA
                      Three-hundred thousand.
                          (off his look)
                    You got a hundred and forty.

                                  SAWYER
                    That would explain my meeting, 
                    wouldn t it?

                                    JESSICA
                    You re meeting with someone who has 
                    the rest of the money?

                                  SAWYER
                          (a sigh, then)
                    There s this Canadian guy, wants in 
                      fifty-fifty.  Two weeks - we ll be 
                    splitting almost a million bucks.  
                    Is it shady?  Yeah.  A little.
                          (beat, a slow smile)
                    But I gotta.  All right?  I meet 
                    the Canuck and make this deal 
                    happen -- I can pay for a lot more 
                    hotel rooms, lemme tell you.

    A beat.  Jessica s wheels turning.  Then, ALL BUSINESS:

                                    JESSICA
                    There s another option.

                                  SAWYER
                    ...what s that?



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "Confidence Man"     (NETWORK DRAFT)     9/8/04     12.

                    That you don t go to the meeting.  
                    That you stay here.  That we make 
                    love again.  And that I give you 
                    the hundred-and-sixty thousand.  
                    And we split it.

      Sawyer stares at her -- a smile creeping up on his face.

                                  SAWYER
                    How the hell you gonna scare up a 
                      hundred-and-sixty thousand bucks?

      Now it s her turn to smile.

      definitely running some kind of GAME here --

                                  JACK (PRE-LAP)

      LOCKE stands in front of his  cave cubby,  weaving palm 
      fronds between bamboo poles to make a wall that will provide 
      him with some privacy from the others.

                                  SAYID (O.S.)
                    Locke...

      Locke turns to see Sayid approaching him, a man on a mission.

                                  SAYID (CONT D)
                    Where were you last night?
                          (off Locke s look)
                    Last night.  Around sunset.

      Locke narrows his eyes at him, getting the gist.

                                  LOCKE
                    Oh, yes.  You were attacked.  Heard 
                    about that.

                                  SAYID
                    And I heard you were in the jungle.  
                    Alone.  Not terribly far from where 
                    it happened.

      Locke squints at him --

                                  LOCKE
                    Well, I m afraid the only witness 
                    to my whereabouts is the boar I was 
                    skinning for our dinner.

      Sayid glares at the ground.  Locke studies him, then...

                                  LOCKE (CONT D)
                    You were attempting to boost the

                                  SAYID
                    More or less.

                                  LOCKE
                    So it would seem whoever attacked 
                    you has reasons for not wanting to 
                    get off the island.

                    Maybe someone who is... profiting 
                    from our current circumstances?

      Sayid eyes him for a long beat.  Understanding.*

                                  SAYID
                    Is there someone you re meaning in *
                      particular?*

                                  SAYID
                    He has an alibi.  Just before I 
                    was... struck... he set off a 
                    bottle rocket, a signal we d worked

                    delay the fuse on his rocket.

      Sayid looks at him --

                                  SAYID
                    How could he possibly--

                                  LOCKE
                    Anyone with basic military training *

                          (then)*
                    Use a cigarette.*

      As Sayid loses himself in this thought, Locke reaches into 
      his gear, pulls out a large KNIFE, and holds it out to Sayid.

                                  LOCKE (CONT D)
                    In case there s a next time.

      Sayid stares at the knife, then at Locke, deciding it may not 
      be a bad idea to be prepared.  As Sayid takes the knife...


      The IMPACTFUL SOUND OF DRY WHEEZING BRINGS US INTO -

      C.U. on MARYBETH.  On a blanket against the outside of the 
      INFIRMARY CAVE.  Jack tends to her.  Richard looks on.

                                  JACK
                    You need to try to relax.

                    How often do you get these attacks?

                    At home... maybe once a week...

                    She s been getting them almost 
                    every day since the crash.

      Marybeth is suddenly struck by a COUGHING FIT.  Jack helps 
      her sit up.  The coughing calms, replaced by a DRY WHEEZE --

                                  JACK
                    Marybeth.  Just hang in there, 
                    okay?  I ll get you through this.

      -- and OFF JACK, his eyes betraying his words...

      ANGLE ON SUN - ACROSS THE VALLEY1313

      We find SUN, watching.  She then crosses to JIN, filling up a 
      bottle of water at the SPRING.  She speaks to him in Korean:

      RESUME ON JACK1414

      Going through his MEDS.  Looking for anything that could help  *
      -- and then he senses something -- even before he sees it --  *
      Jack looks across the valley to find:

      SAWYER.  Striding in like he owns the place, he crosses to 
      the STREAM to refill his bottles.

      Jack is BUMBLEFUCKED: he can t believe this guy...

      ...but that quickly wears off.  Playtime s over.  Jack moves 
      STRAIGHT TOWARD SAWYER.  Sawyer sees him coming.  Rises to  *
      meet the welcome party as --

                                  JACK
                    What are you doing here?

                                  SAWYER
                    Getting water.  That a problem?

                                  JACK
                    Give me the inhalers.  Now.

                                  SAWYER
                    Hell -- I was wonderin  when you *
                    were gonna stop asking nice.

      Sawyer SMILES, raises the bottle to his mouth -- and Jack s  *
      fist moves so fucking fast we barely register it -- WHAM! *

      Sawyer stumbles back -- hand goes to his BUSTED LIP.  Looks  *
      at his own blood.  Then back up to Jack --*

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    Well it s about time, cowboy.   *
                    Didn t think you had it in...*

      WHAM!  Jack POUNDS HIM again.  Sawyer s head whips around...  *
      drops to ONE KNEE.*

      And by now some of the OTHERS have gathered around.  Notably,  *
      SAYID and RICHARD.  Sawyer looks up, revels in the attention-- *

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    Whoo!  That s it!  I ve been *
                    telling you since day one that 
                    we re in the wild.*

      And Jack draws his fist back to give him some more... but  *
      it s CLEAR that Sawyer has no intention of fighting back.   *
      He s just WAITING FOR IT.*



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "Confidence Man"     (NETWORK DRAFT)     9/8/04     21.
      (CONT'D):1414


      And maybe it s his awareness that the others are watching  *
      him... or maybe it s the fact that Sawyer is just begging for 
      it -- that he wants Jack to hit him again --*

      But Jack lowers his fist.  Not calm, but CONTROLLING it --  *
      And knowing that if he lets this go any further, he won t be *
      able to STOP.*

      So with an almost inhuman display of self-control, Jack 
      STRIDES OFF --

      -- and as we settle CLOSE ON SAWYER, his eyes flickering with 
      the defeat of a man whose bait has not been taken...


    A dive -- a place for shady deals.  Jessica sits beside DAVID 
      (36), her good-looking husband.  David leafs through a thick 
      PROSPECTUS on the oil-drilling operation.

      SAWYER looks up from across their shared booth.  He s sharp.  
      Suit, designer glasses: this guy cleans up good -- and it s 
      clear that David likes Sawyer, wants to believe him.

                      Incentives from a foreign 
                      investment.  Listen -- David, I m 
                    not sure this is a good idea--

                                    JESSICA
                    Why not?

                                  SAWYER
                     Cause business between friends is 
                    always a little sticky.
                          (to David)
                    I don t know you well, but I know *
                    your wife.  Working with her at the 
                    bank, I m not sure I m comfortable--

                                  DAVID

                    -- Louisiana will invest two-thirds 
                    of the drilling cost?  What is *
                    this... a loophole?

                                  SAWYER
                    Look, David -- you re reluctant and *
                    I get it.  You got your car 
                      dealership, you don t need this--*

                      JESSICADAVID
      We should do this --
                                                  -- Jess, I don t even know 
                                                  this guy--

                                    JESSICA
                          (to Sawyer)
                    Show him the cash.*

                                  DAVID
                    You have it with you?

      Sawyer looks around.  Pulls out a briefcase.  Spins it toward 
      David.  David pauses, opens it slightly.  Peeks.  Holy shit.

                                  DAVID (CONT D)
                    ...How do I know this is real?

                                  SAWYER
                          (incredulous)
                    The money?  Hell --
                          (smiles, friendly)
                    -- Take it, check it out, I don t 
                    care.  I know where your wife 
                    works, you aren t going anywhere.*

      Sawyer watches David, pondering -- until Sawyer unexpectedly 
      gets up, grabs his briefcase and slaps down a twenty for  *
      their food:

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    Listen.  Don t worry, I got other

                          (to Jessica)
                    -- And I ll see you Monday.*

      Sawyer heads out.  David and Jessica recede as we stay tight 
      on Sawyer - walking - and JUST AS HE GETS TO THE DOOR:




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "Confidence Man"     (NETWORK DRAFT)     9/8/04     23.

                    Wait!

      Sawyer allows himself a snide little smile.  He owns these 
      people now.  Sawyer takes his time walking back --

                                  DAVID (CONT D)
                            (salivating)

                    hours.  You re in?  Great.  You re 
                    out.  Great.

      Sawyer puts down the briefcase, patting it like a child, then 
      turns and goes... and as he walks away, the hook baited, we 
      CLOSE IN ON HIS cold, sharklike intensity...


    A WHITE KNUCKLE MEDICAL CRISIS.  This is how LOST does E.R.

                    HELP!  SHE S NOT -- HELP!

    A FRANTIC Richard leans over MARYBETH as LOUD RASPS emerge 
      from her throat -- trying to get AIR.  Jack rushes over:

                    N... No...

    A SMALL GROUP has gathered, including Sayid and Hurley... but 
      Jack is focused on Marybeth -- his eyes never leave hers -- 
      his only option is to TALK HER DOWN --

                                  JACK
                    You know you re out of medicine, so 
                    you re panicking.  But we can fight 
                    this.  Together.  Okay?
                          (no response)
                    Nod your head, Marybeth.

      She nods.  More RASPY ATTEMPTS at breath.

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    Breathe in through your nose.  
                    Slowly.

      She tries to suck in air through her mouth.

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    No.  Through the nose.  Like this.

      He demonstrates.  She tries to copy him.  Her breaths are 
      shaky.  It s like she s convulsing.

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    Now hold one of my arms and squeeze 
                    as hard as you can.  Squeeze my 
                    arm, Marybeth.*
                          (as she does)
                    Harder.

      She digs her fingernails into his forearm.  Practically draws 
      blood.  But Jack can t feel it.

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    Good.  Good.  Now again... In 
                    through the nose.

      She looks over at Richard.

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    Don t look at him.  Look at me!  In 
                    through the nose.  Slow.  Now -- 
                    loosen your grip.  Let go...

      She lets go, relaxing... finally breathing.

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    Okay.  You re getting air.  Your *
                    color s coming back.

      He s lying.  But her eyes flash with hope.

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    See?  I knew you could do this.  
                    It s passing.  Can you feel it?

                                  MARYBETH
                          (weakly)
                    Yes.

                                  JACK
                    Now.  Again.

      He draws a deep breath through his nose.  She does the same -- 
      draws a full, deep breath and exhales.  AFTER A FEW MOMENTS 
      OF CONSISTENT BREATHS -- Jack looks up at Richard, beckons 
      him to come take over.  As he does, Jack stands and says in a 
      hushed tone, so only Richard can hear --

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    Try to get her to sleep.

      Richard nods as he tends to his wife, and Jack heads for the 
      cave entrance, fuming.  Sayid and Hurley are there.

                                  HURLEY
                    Wow, man.  That was awesome.  That 
                    was like a... Jedi moment.*

      But Jack just walks on -- and Sayid falls in beside him.

                                  SAYID
                    What will happen if she doesn t get *
                    her medicine?*

      Beat.  Sayid doesn t like to talk about this.  But --

                                  SAYID
                    Yes.  And part of my training 
                    entailed getting the enemy to 
                      communicate.

      PUSH IN on JACK, getting his meaning --

                    Give me ten minutes with him.

      TIGHT ON Sawyer, napping in his tent.  NOISES.  Something 
      coming INSIDE.  Sawyer s eyes FLY OPEN -- SEES --

      Sayid standing over him with a crowbar-sized PIECE OF

      MICHAEL, sitting near the entrance to the caves, 
      frustratingly trying to GUT A FISH -- and it s a MESS.  He 
      tries to scoop out guts and spatters himself in the face.

      Michael reacts with a start to find SUN standing just outside 
      the caves, looking around nervously.

                    Oh.  Hey.*

      He puts his fish down, brushes himself off as best as he can 
      and joins her behind a stone wall just outside the caves.

      KILEY (late 40 s) - a bull-necked J.T. Walsh type in rolled 
      up shirtsleeves and a tie - knocking pool balls into their 
      pockets without looking away from Sawyer.

                                  KILEY
                     Cause when a man walks into my 
                    place and tells me he left a 
                    hundred and sixty thousand of my 
                    hard-won dollars in the care of a 
                    civilian, I gotta ask myself if 
                    what I m hearing isn t a desperate 
                    cry for the sweet release of death.

      Kiley sinks the second to last ball on the table... then with 
    a FLICK of his wrist, has his cue against Sawyer s throat.

                                  SAWYER
                    That s why you re an accountant and 
                    I m a genius, Mr. Kiley.

      Sawyer s smirk remains firmly planted on his face as he 
      maneuvers his Zippo around the cue to light a cigarette --

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    I closed a deal today.  Big one.
                          (off Kiley s look)
                    See, women are easy.  A few cosmos 
                    and a couple of stunts they haven t 
                    seen between the sheets and they 
                    think the scam is their idea.  The 
                    husbands -

      Sawyer sticks up his index finger, uses it to move the cue 
      away as he speaks.

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    - They need to touch the money.  
                    Smell it.  Believe that if they had 
                    the brass to put that suitcase in 
                    the trunk of their Ford Taurus and 
                    speed away they might just have a 
                    chance at being an honest-to-gosh 
                    outlaw.  They need the rock-hard 
                      conviction that I handed them the 
                    chance to screw me.

      Kiley s impressed, but not TOO impressed --

                                  KILEY
                    Okay, Tex -- You ve got your grift 
                    so pat, what d you need my money 
                    for?  Where s your seed from the

                    as much as I like spending it.

                          (laughing)
                    No, Sawyer -- That s not why.

      And Kiley s laughter abruptly stops as he bores into Sawyer 
      with a stare so intense it could freeze vodka.

                                  KILEY (CONT D)
                    The reason you can t hold on to 
                    money is you aren t in it for 
                    money.  You re in it to make people 
                    suffer, and in this  accountant s  
                    mind, that makes you a liability.

      RICHARD holds Marybeth s hand as she gasps for air.  SAYID 
      blasts in.  Richard brightens, releases his wife s hand -

                    Where s Jack?  Is he with you?*

    - but Sayid is a freight train - madly rifling through a 
      knapsack, to no avail.

                    You re bleeding.*

      Sayid wipes his forehead - notices the spray of Sawyer s 
      blood - but has no time to explain.  Finally spots Jack s 
      SUPPLY BAG - does a quick inventory.  GAUZE.  SCISSORS.  
      SUTURE KIT.  He grabs the bag and heads out - then STOPS.

      Sayid looks at Richard, whose fear for Marybeth s health 
      hangs over him like a pall.  Sayid s expression softens -

                                  SAYID*
                    I m... I m very sorry.  The doctor 
                    will be here as soon as he can.

      Sayid hurries out the Cave s Entrance, a flash of something  *
      crossing his face.  SHAME?  No time to know as he exits to -


      Sayid races out - almost knocking down Michael, who passes by 
      with hands full of EUCALYPTUS LEAVES.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Hey!

                    to boil --

      But Sun s interrupted by a SHOUT in Korean.  OH SHIT.  Did he 
      hear her speaking English?  Jin strides forward.  PISSED.

                                  JIN
                    What are you doing with him?

      Sun stares at her husband - a deer caught in headlights.

                                  JIN (CONT D)
                    Why are you sneaking around with 
                    this man?  What s going on?

      And there it is - Sun has no choice.  Take the time to explain 
      that she went behind Jin s back to help the sick lady or 
      disobey again and save Marybeth s life.

      Sun steps forward.  DETERMINED.  She takes the leaves from 
      Michael.  And walks away.

      Jin watches in DISBELIEF as she heads off.  Openly DEFYING 
      HIS AUTHORITY -- HIS MANHOOD.  His shock dissolves to anger 
      as he turns to face Michael.

      They hold an intense look.  Things could get ugly -- *

                                    MICHAEL
                    Don t, man.*
                          (means this)*
                    Just.  Don t.*

      OFF JIN, not getting the words, but getting the sentiment... *

                      Allrighty.  Looks like we re in the 
                    oil business.

      PULL BACK to find Sawyer with David & Jessica in their LIVING 
      ROOM.  Nice.  Upper Middle Class.  Before them --

      Sawyer s BRIEFCASE.  Neatly packed with stacks of HUNDRED 
      DOLLAR BILLS.  It s a beautiful sight.  Especially since -- 
      There s ANOTHER SUITCASE STACKED WITH CASH right beside it.

                                  DAVID
                    We re cool?

      Sawyer CLOSES the case --

                                  SAWYER
                    Oh, we re cool.

      Yup.  The fish has been hooked.  David is most certainly IN.

                        DAVIDSAWYER
      We get the money back...?
                                                  -- Week from tomorrow.

                                  DAVID
                          (half-joking)
                    You re not gonna skip town, are 
                    you?

                                  JESSICA
                    David, for godssake -- He left all 
                    his money with us.  We could ve 
                    skipped town.

                                    SAWYER*
                    You got a smart woman there, David.
                          (winks)
                    Don t let go of her.

      And that s when --

                                    CHILD S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Mommy?

      Sawyer s attention instantly drawn to the HALLWAY -- an EIGHT 
      YEAR-OLD BOY stands there, bleary-eyed.  Blonde curly hair.  
      Flannel PJs.  Rosy cheeks.  Too adorable.

      And Sawyer freezes.  HE CANNOT TAKE HIS EYES OFF THE KID. *

                                    JESSICA
                    Hi, baby.  What are you doing up?

                                  BOY
                    Will you read to me?

                                    JESSICA
                    In a minute, sweetheart.  We have 
                    company right now.

      BACK ON SAWYER.  Just FIXATED on this kid.  All the charm -- 
      all the swagger -- instantly GONE.  And it hits us -- This *
      must be the boy who s going to write the letter to Sawyer.  
      That s why we ve been watching this entire story.  And Sawyer  *
      stares at this boy -- shocked -- for an odd, long moment... *

                                  DAVID*
                    ...You okay?*

      But Sawyer can t take his eyes off the boy... it s like *
      seeing a GHOST for Sawyer... his eyes practically fill... *

                                  SAWYER
                          (finally, quietly)*
                    ...Deal s off.*




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "Confidence Man"     (NETWORK DRAFT)     9/8/04     46.

                                  DAVID
                    Excuse me?

                                  SAWYER
                    Deal s off.  Forget it.

      He reaches for his briefcase.  Jessica distressed -- this 
      wasn t part of the plan --

                      JESSICADAVID
      What are you doing?-- Hold on -- You re not 
                                                    walking out of here, man...

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)*
                    I m calling it off.  Walking away.  
                    No harm, no foul.

      And this isn t making any sense -- why is he bailing?  Why 
      the sudden change of heart?  But Sawyer has his briefcase  *
      now, ready to head for the door when -- David s hand clamps 
      down on his WRIST.

                                  DAVID
                    Jessica, call the police.

                                  SAWYER
                    Take your hand off me, boy.

      And Sawyer would DECK this fucking guy, but again his 
      attention is drawn to THE BOY...

                                  DAVID
                    Call the police, Jessica!

      And this is going South real fucking fast -- TENSION -- 
      Jessica not knowing what to do.  Betrayed.  Confused --

                                    JESSICA
                    Sawyer?

      And David s no dummy -- can hear it in her voice just as well 
      as we can, turns back to Sawyer, REALIZATION --

                                  DAVID
                    What s going on here?

                      JESSICADAVID
        (to Sawyer)
      This isn t how it s supposed 
      to work!  You said ---- What he said?  What d he 
                                                  say, Jessica?




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "Confidence Man"     (NETWORK DRAFT)     9/8/04     47.

                    Mommy?

      And Sawyer is still looking at the kid.  And we are EXTREMELY 
      CLOSE ON HIM.  Close enough to see him make the decision.

      Sawyer LETS GO OF THE BRIEFCASE.  Pushes David back -- *

                                  SAWYER*
                    Keep the money.*

      And Sawyer walks right out of the living room and into -- *


      TIGHT ON SAWYER, striding for the front door.  Blank look in  *
      his eyes.  Pulling open the FRONT DOOR.  David and Jessica in  *
      the b.g. doorway, SHOUTING, their words muted because we re 
      IN SAWYER S HEAD -- CLOSING ON HIS EYES. *

      And as we wonder what could possibly have happened to make 
      him leave HIS money behind guaranteeing certain PUNISHMENT...

      Sawyer BLINKS, bringing us into --


      Sawyer s eyes FLUTTER OPEN.  Groggy.  And the first thing he 
      feels is PAIN.  Looks down at his ARM.  THICK BANDAGE AROUND  *
      IT.  Tries to move it -- WINCES as we --*

      WIDEN to find him propped up in his makeshift BED, back in 
      his TENT on the beach.  And he s not alone --

                                  KATE
                    You re lucky to be alive.

      Find Kate, literally sitting by his  bedside.   We should 
      note something about Sawyer here -- He is real.

                                    SAWYER*
                    The doctor -- ?

                                  KATE
                    Ignored you and saved your life 
                    anyway.

                                  SAWYER
                    Where is he?





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "Confidence Man"     (NETWORK DRAFT)     9/8/04     48.

                                  KATE
                    He headed back to the caves to 
                    check on that woman.

      And that s when Sawyer notices Kate s holding something.  An 
      ENVELOPE.  His letter.  And she SEES him notice it --

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    I read it again.  And then again.  
                    Last couple hours -- I don t know *
                    how many times.*

      Sawyer a little vulnerable here.  A little guarded --

                                  SAWYER
                    Why would you -- ?

                                  KATE
                          (simple; straight)
                    Because I m trying to figure out 
                    why you made me read it.*
                          (beat)*
                    Why you beat up that man instead of 
                    just telling him you didn t have 
                    his wife s medication.  Why you  *
                    pretended to have it anyway.*
                          (beat)*
                    Why you let yourself get tortured.*
                          (beat)
                    And the thing I kept coming up with 
                    was -- it was that you want to be 
                    hated.  And maybe that s why you 
                    made me read this letter.
                          (opens it up; reads)
                     You killed my parents, Mr. 
                    Sawyer. 

      And now Kate SIGHS.  Almost like she SHES IT.  Then --

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    And then I looked at the envelope.

      Kate turns over the envelope and we see A COMMEMORATIVE 
      EMBOSSED SEAL.  ON SAWYER, feeling totally NAKED...

                                  KATE (CONT D)

                    This letter wasn t written to you.
                          (long beat)*
                    You wrote this letter.*

      Sawyer s eyes DROP -- holding them in a real TIGHT TWO-SHOT -- 
      the pure INTIMACY of the moment impossible to avoid --

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    Sawyer isn t your name, is it?

      And a LONG beat passes before --

                          (quietly)
                    ...It was his name.*

      And he starts speaking slowly at first, in his own head...

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    First heard it at my momma s wake.  
                    My daddy didn t get one -- You 
                    don t get a wake when you kill 
                    yourself.
                          (then)
                    Was my Uncle Doug who pulled me 
                    aside.  Told me it was a confidence 
                    man who killed them.  Told me how 
                    he rolled into town, marked my 
                    folks.  Romanced my momma, used her 
                    to get to their money.  Wiped  em *
                    out clean, left the mess behind.  *
                    Only thing the cops had was his *
                    name on a bogus business card.
                          (beat)
                    So I wrote that letter.  Wrote it 
                    knowing I d find him one day.
                          (then)*

      CAMERA STARTING TO PUSH IN on him now as he tells this story.  
    A story he has probably never told out loud --

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    And then I was nineteen -- needed *
                    six grand to pay off some guys I *
                    was in trouble with.  So I found a *
                    pretty lady with a dumb husband who *
                    had some money.*
                          (owning it)
                    And I got them to give it to me.
                          (shakes his head; 
                            chuckles)
                    How you like that for tragedy?  
                    Became the man I was hunting. *
                          (a long beat; then)
                    Became Sawyer.

      And finally, he s done.  LOOKS to Kate --

      And she is empathetic.  Vulnerable.  Something about this guy 
      is so wounded, so HURT she can identify with it.  It is an  *
      intense moment because it is so TRUE...

      But Sawyer quickly becomes self-aware -- doesn t like the way 
      she s looking at him.  And as RAW as he just was, it only 
      takes a second for him to transform back into a WILD ANIMAL --

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)

                                                  -- Get the hell out.

      Sawyer PULLS the letter from her hand.  Kate surprised --

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    Get out.

      And Kate s eyes narrow.  Can t believe she almost actually 
      just cried for this fucker.  And now, her own walls going up, 
      she stands.  Looks down at him for a moment...

      But there s nothing left to say.  So she goes.

      Once she s gone, SETTLE ON SAWYER.  Watching her walk away.

      Clutching that letter.

                                        ACT FIVE


      ON SUN, rubbing salve from a small bowl onto the upper chest 
      of Marybeth, who seems to be breathing easier, her face 
      flush.  As we WIDEN, we find JACK and an elated RICHARD 
      standing over them as Richard explains...

                                    RICHARD
                    ...I dunno... It was like this... 
                    miracle.  She just showed up with 
                    that... mixture.  Rubbed it on 
                      Marybeth s chest and ten minutes *
                    later she was breathing again.*

      Jack reaches into the bowl, takes a dab of the SALVE, rubbing 
      it between his fingers.  He brings it to his nose and smells.

                                  JACK
                            (recognizing it)
                      Eucalyptus?
                          (upset he didn t think of *
                            it)*
                    Smart, Jack.  Real smart.*

      Jack shakes it off -- looks at Sun and smiles -- *

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    Thank you.  Very much.

      Sun accepts his gratitude with a smile and a nod, until she 
      notices...

      JIN standing against a wall some distance away, glaring at 
      her, intensely.

      ON SUN, as her smile fades, and she defiantly goes back to  *
      tending to Marybeth.*


      CHARLIE brings CLAIRE into the valley...


      JIN looks over at his wife, then RACK FOCUS to him looking 
      across the valley at Michael.  Sensing something...


      RICHARD brings MARYBETH some water... smiles, relieved that 
      she s pulled through.

      And back at...
