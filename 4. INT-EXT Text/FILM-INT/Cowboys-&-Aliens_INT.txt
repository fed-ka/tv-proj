BAM! The door flies open and VOTIVE CANDLES FLICKER. The Man
looks at the dog and says --
THE MAN IN BLACK
Stay.
The dog sits by the door as The Man enters -- EMPTY -- he's
moving -- into a small kitchen area -- bottle of whiskey --
uncorks it with his teeth -- drinks -- pours some on the wound --
then A PISTOL COCKS behind him --
Meet MEACHAM, town preacher, a tough, wash-foot Baptist:
MEACHAM
Palms to heaven, Friend.
The Man freezes. Turns up his hands.
THE MAN IN BLACK
Been shot.
MEACHAM
Only two kinds of men get shot --
criminals and victims.
(steps forward; hard)
Which one're you?
THE MAN IN BLACK
don't know.
Meacham hears the HONESTY in his voice. Knows a lost soul when
he sees one. Lowers his gun, softening...
MEACHAM
Got a name, son?
THE MAN IN BLACK
Don't know that either.
5.
MEACHAM
What do you know?
THE MAN IN BLACK
(a beat; then)
... English.
Off Meacham, INTRIGUED -- we CUT TO:
A CANDLE FLAME -- a NEEDLE passing through it -- it's LATER and
Meacham's studying The Man's wound:
MEACHAM
Odd wound. Looks... cauterized.
(off The Man's look)
Means somethin' burned it half closed.
The Man just stares. News to him. And now, as Meacham leans
over the wound, the METAL CROSS around his neck begins to
twitch... lifting ever so SLIGHTLX off his chest -- towards the
strange BRACELET on the Man's wrist. Meacham reacts --
MEACHAM (CONT'D)
Nice trick. That some kinds... magnet?
The Man looks at him -- "What the hell is a 'magnet'?!?"
Meacham shrugs it off, readies the needle --
MEACHAM (CONT'D)
Try'n hold still.
He pokes the hot needle through the wound -- The Man winces
slightly, but bears the pain.
MEACHAM (CONT'D)
Where'd you ride in from?
THE MAN IN BLACK
West. Woke up in the desert.
Looking up at the sun like I'd been
dropped outta the sky.
MEACHAM
Seems I remember a story about that
happening once... fella by the name of
Lucifer.
(GRINS)
How 'bout I just call you "Luke," for
short.
But TheMan's distracted by his REFLECTION in a cracked mirror:
his own face unfamiliar. Meacham nods towards The Man's HANDS --
6.
MEACHAM (CONT'D)
That blood yours or somebody else's?
THE MAN IN BLACK
Three men rode up. Drew on me.
(STILL CONFUSED)
My hands... moved on their own.
MEACHAM
(A BEAT)
Anything else you wanna confess to while
you got my attention?
And The Man senses somehow that, ygg, there is... but:
THE MAN IN BLACK
Everything that happened before I woke
up...
(shakes his head)
It's gone.
MEACHAM
Well. Too bad. Can't absolve you for
your sins if you don't recall 'em. That
bein' said...
Meacham looks up, eyes twinkling. This is not a fire n'
brimstone preacher. This is a guy who GETS IT --
MEACHAM (CONT'D)
I seen bad men do good things and good
men do bad things. Whether you end up in
heaven or hell... it's not God's plan...
it's yours.
(BEAT)
You just got to remember what it was.
The Man considers. Darkly --
THE MAN IN BLACK
What if I don't want to remember?
MEACHAM
(BEAT; GRINS)
Then you're probl'y goin' to hell.
On cue -- SMASH!!! The stained glass window EXPLODES as a
MOLOTOV COCKTAIL hurtles into the church. FIRE spreads around
the pews -- MEACHAM ACTIVATES -- tears curtains off the
confessional and uses them to STAMP OUT the fire --
MEACHAM (CONT'D)
Dammit -- it's Dolarhyde's men!
WHOOPS and HOLLERS and GUNSHOTS outside! The Man whirls to see
A DOZEN MEN ON HORSEBACK, marauding through town --
7.
Meacham finishes putting out the fire, grabbing a couple
blankets as he moves past The Man --
MEACHAM
You wanna help or are you just gonna
stand there and burn?!
THE BATWING DOORS SWING OPEN: The Man In Black enters with the
dog, tips his hat to a couple WHORES. They GRIN, liking what
they see. RANCH HANDS drink their pay. Behind the bar, a MAN
and WOMAN argue. DOC and MARIA; she's a buxom Mexican beauty;
he's 300 roly-poly pounds of ANXIOUS CASTILIAN JEALOUSY:
DOC
-- I know you are, don't lie to me!
MARIA
How many times do we have to do this,
Arturo? J. love you.
DOC
Really? Do you?!?
(holds up a POCKETWATCH)
I found this in our bed! And I don't
k3 Vg. a watch, Maria. I can't AfjQrd a
watch because y insisted we buy this
saloon!
She looks at him SQUARELY -- yes, some SECRET withheld. As The
Man In Black reaches the bar, he's Maria's EXCUSE to end this:
MARIA
We have customers.
And MOVES off. Doc stomps toward the exit -- sees EMMETT at the
back of the bar stealing sips of BEER from left-behind glasses:
DOC
AFUERA! ADULTS ONLY!!!
Emmett RUNS OUT. The Man sits beside an old cuss named ATTICUS.
The dog heels at The Man's feet, eyes a STEAK on Atticus' plate:
ATTICUS
That mutt makes a move for my steak, I'll
drill him down.
13.
MARIA
Shut up, Atticus. This is the man who
took out Percy Dolarhyde.
Atticus grumbles and goes back to eating, but not before
sweeping his duster aside to show the GUN in his holster. Maria
rolls her eyes, sets a GLASS in front of The Man, who nods:
THE MAN IN BLACK
I'm looking for a woman.
She gestures to the WHORES --
MARIA
What kind?
THE MAN IN BLACK
This kind.
He removes the PHOTO from inside his hat. The one of the WOMAN.
MARIA
Never seen her before. But she is
beautiful.
(pours him whiskey; then
one for herself)
Here's to you finding her, Senor.
ON THE MAN. Not exactly sure he WANTS to. But they CLINK
glasses, knock 'em back. Maria pours him another:
MARIA (CONT'D)
You have any idea what kind of mess you
just stepped into?
THE MAN IN BLACK
No. But I figured I'd be safe in here
seein' as how that boy I tossed off his
horse didn't wanna burn your saloon.
Maria's eyes go down. Somehow GUILTY. But then:
- -
MARIA
It's not the boy you should worry about.
(OMINOUS)
It's his papa.
A BULLET, in close up, twirling between the thumb and forefinger
of SHERIFF TAGGART. Boots up on his desk, TROUBLED.
Deputy Wade pours himself a cup from a TIN POT OF COFFEE:
DEPUTY CHARLIE WADE
Percy wouldn't've come in shooting
without his daddy's say-so, Kyle. You
best get ready for a war 'cause that's
what's comin'.
SHERIFF TAGGART
Tomorrow we ride the little shit up
Phoenix way, turn him over. Dolarhyde's
got a beef, he can take it up with the
6th cavalry.
Taggart's on his feet, grabs his JACKET off the door --
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
Goddamn tired of this... fatass rancher
scaring good people off their lan--
He STOPS. Something catches his eye on the posting board.
YANKS a piece of paper off, a mixture of CONFUSION and CONCERN
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
Sonofabitch.
WHAT DOES HE SEE? Before we get a chance to KNOW --
-- he SLUGS back a shot, the dog at his feet, still eyeing that
steak on Atticus' plate. The Man points to his GLASS:
THE MAN IN BLACK
Another.
MARIA
You drink like a man who wants to forget.
THE MAN IN BLACK
(haunted; the irony)
Other way round.
The dog WHINES AGAIN for the steak. Atticus SLAMS down his
silverware. Draws his GUN --
17.
ATTICUS
You got three seconds to get your dog
outta here or I blow his balls off.
THE MAN IN BLACK
(without a blink)
Not my dog.
ATTICUS
Q=... two...
-- and just before "three"... CA-CLICK. Atticus FREEZES,
because there's a RIFLE BARREL at the back of h,iS head now:
VOICE (O.S.)
Give you odds you don't get to 'three.'
RACK TO FIND the person holding the rifle is A WOMAN.
Beautiful. EXOTIC. Dressed in leather. Meet ELLA SWENSON.
ON THE MAN IN BLACK. Can't help himself. immediate and
undeniable CHEMISTRY. But she pays him no mind -- makes a PSST
sound and the dog snaps to her side. Atticus uncocks his gun,
slowly slides it back in the holster --
ATTICUS
I was just havin' some fun, Miss --
ELLA
Give- him, the steak.
Atticus HESITATES, angry at the humiliation. Ella PRESSES THE
GUN HARDER against his neck, lowering him -- and his plate -- to
the floor. Right in front of the dog, who GROWLS --
ELLA (CONT'D)
Now say you're sorry.
ATTICUS
(biting his tongue)
I'm-- sorry.
ELLA
His name's 'Happy.'
HappyBARES HIS TEETH. INCHES from Atticus' face
ATTICUS
I'm sorry... 'Happy.'
ELLA
Alright then.
(lowers her rifle)
You're right. That was fun.
18.
-- Atticus scrambles back to his feet and OUT the door, as Ella
looks at the Man In Black:
ELLA (CONT'D)
What're you doing with my dog?
THE MAN IN BLACK
I was hoping you could tell me.
ELLA
The hell're you talking ab--?
WRIST BRACELET. Surprise and REVELATION:
ELLA (CONT'D)
Where... did you get that?
Before he can answer, SHERIFF TAGGART enters, along with DEPUTY
WADE (carrying a SHOTGUN), and 5 other deputies. They move
cautiously to THE MAN, like he's a powder keg about to go off...
SHERIFF TAGGART
Hey there, "Luke." Mind following me
down to the office so we can have us a
chat...?
THE MAN IN BLACK
(CONFUSED; ALERT)
What for?
SHERIFF TAGGART
All due respect, I'm the law, mister.
That's what for.
The men LOCK EYES:
THE MAN IN BLACK
Tell you what, Sheriff. How about you
keep the fifty dollars you owe me and I
just walk outta here like we. never met?
SHERIFF TAGGART
Because we did meet.
ON ELLA. For reasons we're not sure of, the idea of The Man
leaving ALARMS her. All the Gunslingers' hands are POISED by
holsters. The Man stays preternaturally COOL:
THE MAN IN BLACK
L can't be accountable for what happens
if they draw on me.
SHERIFF TAGGART
And what's gonna happen?
19.
THE MAN IN BLACK
Best you don't find out.
SHERIFF TAGGART
Now why'd you have to go and say that?
Taggart gives a nod and the men start to CONVERGE --
THE MAN IN BLACK
(low; genuine plea)
Don't.
But Charlie makes a MOVE and The Man SLAMS his head into a pole
-- the NEXT GUNMAN reaches for his pistol -- The Man PUNCHES his
THROAT -- SLAMS the third into a bench -- The FOURTH straight
down on the Faro table --
TAGGART levels his REPEATER -- but The Man just GRABS the barrel
as Taggart FIRES a ROUND into the ceiling -- now the rifle's in
THE MAN'S HANDS and just before he PULLS THE TRIGGER on Taggart:
HE SEES EMMETT AT THE WINDOW. About to watch his father's
MURDER... and The Man LOWERS the gun:
THE MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D)
I told you, I don't wanna hurt anyb--
CRACK! The butt of a PISTOL WHIPS the side of his SKULL! The
Man DROPS as we REVEAL who just knocked his ass OUT:
ELLA! Taggart draws a gun and pins The Man, whipping out that
piece of paper he pulled from his office...
SHERIFF TAGGART
Yup -- looks just like him.
NOW WE IT'S A WANTED POSTER WITH THE MAN'S FACE ON IT:
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
"Jake Lonergan. Scourge a' The
Territories. Wanted Dead or Alive."
And The Man... now forever known as JAKE... stares WOOZILY into
his OVERTURNED HAT... the photo tucked inside of the BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN... her image goes BLURRY... then mil{:
AND WHAM:
MEMORY FLASHCUTS1 STROBELIXE IMAGES --
1.) A tilted, handmade trail sign: "SAGUARO PASS."
2.) We're in a CABIN somewhere. BLINDING ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT
EXPLODES INTO THE CABIN, against which a DEMONIC SILHOUETTE
appears -- it looks like an INDIAN IN FULL-FEATHER HEADDRESS --
20.
3.) A WOMAN'S FACE -- THE WOMAN FROM JAKE'S PHOTOGRAPH -- she
looks at us and SCREAMS --
4.) Now we're someplace VERY DARK -- a cave? As some kind of
TERRIFYING OCULAR PROBE lowers right in front of our eyes --
5.) Now we're RUNNING through the cave -- ESCAPE -- BREATHING
HARD -- a LIGHT at the end of the tunnel -- BLINDING SUN hits us
as we emerge -- our eyes ADJUST to see:
6.) A STRANGE ROCK FORMATION on the rim of a canyon -- like a
STONE TOWER pointing to heaven as the SUN WHITEWASHES US TO:
JAKE'S EYES OPEN and he GASPS AIR! His POV: a FACE comes into
FOCUS -- PERCY DOLARHYDE. GRINNING at him from the next cell:
PERCY
You're a dead.
Jake sits up. Woozy. Blinking back to reality.
PERCY (CONT'D)
My daddy's comin' for me, Boy. You're
gonna end up another dead shitheel under
his spurs. I am gonna watch you suffer
for a long, long --
Jake moves LIGHTNING QUICK -- reaching through the bars,
GRABBING PERCY'S COLLAR, YANKING FORWARDS -- SLAMMING Percy's
head into the bars, KNOCKING hIM OUT COLD AGAIN. Percy DROPS.
JAKE
Shut up.
Jake sits back on his cot, rubbing his still-throbbing head.
A KEY in the LOCK as the cell door OPENS: Sheriff Taggart, Wade,
the gunmen. GLARING at Jake, then noticing Percy --
SHERIFF TAGGART
What happened to him?
JAKE
(DEADPAN)
Man walked into a bar.
Taggart shakes his head as Charlie and a deputy unlock Percy's
cell, CUFF HIM, drag him out. Taggart points to Jake:
SHERIFF TAGGART
Step back against the wall there. Move
and I shoot you dead.
JAKE
(as he does)
You should've let me go.
SHERIFF TAGGART
Yeah, I should've shot you in your knee.
You put down six of my deputies.
JAKE
Six was all you had.
SHERIFF TAGGART
Hell, they're gonna love you in Phoenix.
JAKE
Yeah? What's in Phoenix?
SHERIFF TAGGART
What you got comin', Jake Lonergan.
Taggart reaches into his shirt, pulls out a pair of GLASSES.
Slips them on his nose. Takes out that WANTED poster and reads:
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
Aggravated banditry, 17 counts, Forgery,
Blackmail, Hijacking, injurious use of a
cattle prod, Arson, Incitement of
Whorehouse Riot, and Trespassing with
intent to deflower. You're also leader
of a gang of outlaws includin' Creek
Johnson and Bull McCade, which makes you
accessory to every law they broke too.
JAKE
(after a long BEAT:)
That it?
22.
SHERIFF TAGGART
Saved the best for last... 'Murder.'
That LANDS on Jake. Wondering if this is TRUE. Evenly --
JAKE
It say who I killed?
SHERIFF TAGGART
Prostitute outta Mojave, name of Alice
Wills.
Taggart rises, removes Jake's BLACK STETSON from a hook on the
wall, pulls that PHOTOGRAPH OF THE WOMAN from the inner brim:
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
If I were a bettin' man, I'd say this
would be Ms. Wills, would it not?
Jake just stares, CONFUSED. SHAKEN.
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
They found her dead in a cabin round
Saguaro Pass, twenty miles west of here.
With that, a CLUE falls into place: SAGUARO PASS.
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
Deed was in your name.
He slips the photo back in the brim, tosses the hat to Jake:
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
Dead hooker with a hole in her chest, in
your cabin, plus your sterling reputation
equals guilty as goddamned sin.
(draws his GUN)
And you're gonna hang for it.
At gunpoint, Taggart PUSHES Jake out the door --
JAKE AND !MERCY -- TRAPPED IN THE UPSIDE-DOWN COACH -- Jake sees
DEPUTY WADE on the ground just a few feet away, head bleeding --
JAKE
HEY!! LET US OUT!!!
27.
-- but WHOOSH! A METAL COLLAR CLAMPS AROUND WADE AND YANKS HIM
AWAY! Percy STRUGGLES wildly against Jake in a TUG-O'-WAR:
JAKE (CONT'D)
STOP PULLING AND GIMME YOUR HAND--!
PERCY JAKE
-- THE HELL FOR-- ?! -- I CAN GET US FREE! GIMME
YOUR DAMN HAND!!!
Percy RELENTS. Offers up his hand. Jake grabs all of Percy's
FINGERS, TIGHTENS HIS FIST AROUND THEM -- CRRRRAAACKI
SNAPS THEM BACKWARDS!!!!! Percy SHRIEKS as Jake KICKS him back
against the wall, FORCING Percy's hand out of the cuff -- and
now Jake's UNTETHERED too!
THROUGH THE CROWD -- DOLARHYDE hears his son SCREAM. SEES the
overturned coach and TWO-FINGER WHISTLES to:
DOLARHYDE
Colorado!
Nat Colorado RACES IN as Dolar draws his .45 -- BANG! --
shatters the coach lock -- they PULL Percy out:
PERCY
MY FINGERS!! HZ BE= MY FINGERS!!!
DOLARHYDE
QUIT WHININ' AND FIND A HORSE!
As Dolar runs for his horse, Percy sees a PISTOL left on the
ground -- grabs it with his good hand and FIRES at Jake who
JUKES behind the coach for cover, Percy SHOOTING in a FURY but:
-- KLINK! A collar CLAMPS around Percy's neck and he's YANKED
OFF TOO! Dolarhyde turns and SEES HIS SON DISAPPEAR:
Meacham ushers people into the church as WALLS SHAKE, PEWS JUMP:
DOC AND MARIA burst in, huddle under a window. Across the room,
a YOUNG MAN clamps a hand over his TERRIFIED WIFE's mouth --
CRAAASFI! MORE RINGS SMASH THROUGH THE WALL, YANKING THE YOUNG
COUPLE THROUGH IT! ANOTHER RING CLAMPS AROUND MARIA'S NECK!
MARIA
AYUDAMEEEEEEE!
Doc LEAPS after her but her collar's LASSO CABLE whips out,
TETHERING to a passing Speeder and she's RIPPED OUT THE DOOR --
28.
DOC
MARIA!!!
The speeder PLOWS through, parishioners flee -- the CHURCH BELL
breaks from the BELL TOWER -- CRASHES DOWN ON THE SPEEDER --
THUD! The alien corpse is DROPPED onto the bar by Doc and
Meacham. As Dolarhyde and Colorado follow through the batwings
-- Doc WHIPS a SHOTGUN from under the bar:
DOC
Stay outside. You're not welcome in
here!
Dolar brings up his COLT -- so does COLORADO --
DOLARRYDE
I own more of this town than any man in
it so I'll go wherever the hell I damn
please. And for the record? You ain't
welcome in my country, Mexican.
Ella steps between them, BAD ASS --
ELLA
Whatever troubles you had don't mean a
damn thing against the ones we got now.
We wanna see our way through 'em, your
guns better start pointing in the same
direction, Goddammit.
Doc and Dolar never take eyes off each other. or their GUNS.
Finally... Dolar LOWERS his. So does Doc. People BREATHE.
Meacham slips on a pair of GLASSES, studying eerie veins and
muscles through the creature's viscous outer layers. Doc turns
his focus to the alien too. Picks up his PUMP-OPERATED BONE
SAW. Presses his boot on the bellows, it turns with a WHIR...
SHAKING as he brings the SPINNING BLADE to the alien's CHEST.
Looks at Meacham, AFRAID --
DOC
If it 'mss a demon, and I cut it open... am
I going to burn for it?
32.
Meacham hesitates a beat, then CROSSES the air in front of Doc --
MEACHAM
That should cover ya.
ON DOC. Little relief. BROW SWEATING, he brings the spinning
blade down toward the disgusting ALIEN -- VRRRRZZ -- HESITATES --
DOC
Excuse me.
B GH! He PUKES on the ground.
EMMETT
Jesus, Doc!!!
Doc wipes his mouth with a handkerchief, slightly DEFIANT --
DOC
This is not normal. I'm entitled to
vomit. We should XU be vomiting.
DOLARHYDE
Just cut, Lardass.
Doc GLARES... with a still-shakitig hand, gets back to business --
VRRRRZ -- CUTS THROUGH THE STERNUM -- ORANGE BLOOD SPRAYING --
and... SHUNK! Doc looks up at Jake, gestures to the carcass:
DOC
Senor? A hand?
(TO DOLARHYDE)
You too, maricon.
The men all grip the chest plate and PULL -- A DISGUSTING CRACK.
Everyone turns away, scowling, Emmett wafting the air:
EMMETT
Damn! Smells like a dead dog's ass.
MEACHAM
Emmett.
EMMETT
Sorry, Father.
Doc covers his face with his handkerchief as he explores...
DOC
Chet wall's partially collapsed... no
familiar organs of any kind...
DOLARHYDE
'course they're not familiar. Just look
at this th--
33.
SUDDENLY THE ALIEN'S ARM LASHES OUT -- claws SNAP OPEN and PIN
Dolarhyde against the wall! Everyone tries to PRY the claws
from his neck -- but the second Doc withdraws his hands from the
alien's chest, its arm goes LIMP. Dolarhyde drops, GASPING...
DOC
Spinal reflex.
And GRINS at Dolar's pain. But Meacham NOTICES something around
Dolar's neck where the alien pinned him, like a ring of DUST:
MEACHAM
Something on your neck. Hold still.
Meacham sweeps a little off Dolar's neck, rubs it between thumb
and forefinger. The dust GLINTS under the kerosene lamp:
MEACHAM (CONT'D)
I'll be damned... gold.
They check the creature's hand talons: GOLD FLAKES underneath
'em, and Lots of it. Colorado checks its taloned feet:
NAT COLORADO
Down here too.
(looks to Dolar)
This much ore... could only have come
from a digging in a mine.
That LANDS on everyone. but most especially ELLA. Who looks up
to see Jake READING her in this moment.
EMMETT
In the ALIEN'S EYE is a SMALL FLASHING LIGHT. On/Off/On/Off in
time with that BEEP BEEP BEEP.
DOC
Gimme my scalpel.
In MACRO CU, DOC CUTS INTO THE EYE, WET SQUISHY SOUNDS as he
pulls it from its socket, attached to a STRINGY OPTIC NERVE
dripping with juice. Clamped to the nerve is a METALLIC ORB:
-- he takes hold of the blinking orb. It FLARES to life, the
light coalescing into a 3-D ARROW-LIKE HOLOGRAM. Confusion.
Doc REMOVES it from the optic nerve and the hologram DISAPPEARS:
DOLARHYDE
Where'd it go? The hell'd you do?
DOC
Nothing, just pulled it off --
He reconnects it to the optic nerve, the hologram REAPPEARS:
34.
DOC (CONT'D)
Only works when it's touching the
creature.
Colorado moves closer... rainbow light flickering across his
face...
NAT COLORADO
I think... it's a compass. Look:
(fiddles with tweezers)
No matter how you move it, it points in
the same direction.
EMMETT
Compasses point north. That's west.
MEACHAM
(realizing; to Jake)
West's where 141 came from.
ON JAKE. Another puzzle piece falling into place.
EMMETT
If you're right, what's it pointing to?
ELLA
The rest of 'em.
(THEN)
Be my guess.
DOLARHYDE
Then that's where I'm goin'.
He SNAPS his PISTOL open, loading bullets:
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
One of my ranchers said my herd
disappeared into the sky. 'Til about ten
minutes ago, I figured him for a liar.
(SNAPS barrel closed)
Nobody takes my cattle.
MEACHAM
Your b was taken too.
A FLASH of something from Dolarhyde -- could that be EMOTION?
But just as fast, it's GONE. Almost a THROWAWAY:
DOLARHYDE
I noticed.
NAT COLORADO
What if they're already dead?
EMMETT
They're not dead.
35.
ELLA
Kid's right. If all they wanted was to
kill us, they would've.
DOLARHYDE
Looked to me like... they were ropin'
people.
(THEN)
Means they need 'em for something.
Whatever it is, we can either stand here
guessin'... or go find out.
His eyes flash to Nat: "C'mon." And they EXIT. Everyone looks
at each other, working up the courage to face what they know
they must. Doc grabs his SHOTGUN, starts gathering shells:
DOC
If she's alive -- if there's even a
CHANCE --
MEACHAM
Lord hates a coward... but our bullets
were useless against those things. Other
than his wrist gizmo, we're outgunned and
outnumbered.
As one by one, they turn... to JAKE. Who until this point has
been mostly SILENT. Observing. But now -- he's gone from enemy
to potential savior in a heartbeat.
JAKE
Whoa, I got nothing to do with this --
ELLA
You got everything to do with it. If you
can remember where you got that thing --
JAKE
I remember you all wantin' me on the end
of a damned rope. Whatever's happenin'
here's got nothin' to do with me.
ELLA
You sure. about that?
He LOOKS at her. No, he isn't. But he sure as hell won't stay
to debate it -- turns to go --
EMMETT
Mr. Lonergan? Sir?
The EMOTION in the boy's voice STOPS Jake at the door.
EMMETT (CONT'D)
My mother died last year. My Paw... he's
all I got.
36.
And despite a fleeting moment of SYMPATHY, Jake darkens --
JAKE
Kid, I'm the last man you want anywhere
near you, your Pa... or anyone else in
this goddamned town.
OUT the door. Everyone trades looks, then Ella FOLLOWS:
LIGHT BEAMS stream in. Eerie quiet.
Jake takes it in, HAUNTED. Something CRUNCHES under his boot --
DRIED FLOWERS. Sticking out from an OVERTURNED CRACKED VASE.
Jake BLINKS, affected -- Bends over, TOUCHES the VASE AS:
MEMORY FLASECUT! FRESH FLOWERS in a woman's hand... THE W B&
FROM JAKE'S PICTURE. She smiles at him --
THE WOMAN
You shouldn't have.
She turns, drops the flowers into the vase as we see she's
talking to JAKE.
JAKE
Got you somethin' else.
41.
CLINK -- He drops a LEATHER POUCH on the table next to the vase.
A FEW GOLD COINS clink out. The woman turns to him, WORRIED:
THE WOMAN
Where'd you get this?
JAKE
Where do you think?
The woman looks to the pouch -- Picks up one of the coins.
TORN. Jake moves behind her. Close. An INTIMACY here.
THE WOMAN
Your boys '11 come after you.
ON JAKE. Dark. But DETERMINED:
JAKE
Let 'em come.
She turns to him, their eyes HOLD... and they KISS. Soft.
Tender. Soulful.
But then -- a THUNDERCRACK turns their attention to the window:
A STORM CLOUD on the horizon. Same kind that consumed the town.
The cabin starts to VIBRATE like a tuning fork. The pouch
slides off the table... THE GOLD COINS SPILL OUT and --
BACK TO PRESENT - JAKE
REELING. What is this memory? Who the hell is the woman?
Something GLINTS in the far wall where the chimney used to be:
ONE OF THE GOLD COINS
EMBEDDED in the wood. Jake pulls it out of the wall, a thousand
questions in his eyes. Sunlight SHIMMERS off it and --
MEMORY FLASHCUT! The spilled coins start SLIDING across the
floor all by themselves, as if magnetically drawn to THE CHIMNEY
-- WHOOSH! -- SUCKED right up into it by some VACUUM FORCE!
THE WOMAN
What's happening?!!!
WINDOWS EXPLODE! THE ROOF'S RIPPED AWAY BY SOME NSANE VACUUM
FORCE AS ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT CRASHES IN! The Woman SCREAMS and --
KA-CHINNNG! A STEEL COLLAR SHOOTS DOWN FROM THE LIGHT, CLAMPING
AROUND HER NECK! A CABLE SNAPS OUT FROM IT AND WHIPS UPWARD,
PULLING HER INTO THE LIGHT --
She manages to GRAB a doorknob and DANGLES UPWARD, CHOKING as --
42.
A DEMONIC SILHOUETTE drops in front of them!
JESUS!! Jake draws his pistol and FIRES!
The demon SHRIEKS IN RAGE as SPIKED PLUMES fan out from its
huge, elongated skull... making it look like a SILHOUETTED
It QIA1.-L 2 A T EI! R HEADDRESS!
Its HIDEOUS FACE comes into the light -- AN AIJIE -- as it
raises its arm, wearing a WRIST BRACELET that reshapes into a
BLASTER --
JAKE DIVES AWAY but a searing pulse RIPS A WICKED GASH in his
side (now we know how he woke up with it in the desert) --
THE PULSE PASSES THROUGH JAKE AND HITS THE WOMAN SQUARE IN THE
C-Mr-M. She 's HURLED backward into the wall, Jake. CRIES OUT:
JAKE
Alice!
As he RUSHES to her, her collar UNLOCKS... and FLIES AT JAKE,
clamping HE'S PULLED INTO THE LIGHT, CHOKING, SCREAMING --
BACK TO PRESENT - JAKE
As he STUMBLES back -- GASPING -- touching his neck --
Catches his breath. ROCKED. Sees "Alice's" BLOOD STAIN on the
wall. His shaking hand reaches out, brushes over it...
JAKE (CONT'D)
(trying out the name)
"Alice"...
Whoever she was to him, he feels sledgehammered with GRIEF. All
he knows is, it was THEM. The creatures killed her. And this
revelation... well, it galvanizes him with RAGE.
Rage that gives him NEW PURPOSE... then--
SUDDENLY -- INSTINCT -- JAKE SENSING SOMETHING IS HERE -- GRABS
A CHIMNEY STONE AND SPINS, HURLS IT...
AT COLORADO, IN THE DOORWAY BEHIND HIM AIMING A GUN:
The stone HITS Colorado as he FIRES, the bullet tears PAST Jake
-- as Colorado recovers, Jake BODYSLAMS HIM -- the GUN goes
flying, they go hurling THROUGH THE WALL -- LANDING HARD on the
other side -- aaballs-out. messy. close-quarter death match --
Jake takes a PUNCH -- Colorado LOOPS an arm around his throat,
YANKS -- they TUMBLE/SLAM to the floor, Jake LANDING on top of
Colorado who holds the arm lock, CHOKING THE LIFE OUT OF HIM --
43.
Jake -- EYES POPPING -- SEES THE GUN just out of reach --
fingers GRASP for it -- seconds before he PASSES OUT
He GRABS the gun and swings it back -- BLAMMII!Colorado ROLLS
aside as the WALL where his head just was BLOWSOPEN--and
Jake's ON HIM, PISTOL WHIPPING HIM MERCILESSLYuntilheSPINS
the gun back around and POINTS IT between Colorado's eyes:
ON JAKE -- quaking with rage -- he wants to kill this guy so bad
he can taste it... but something's HOLDING HIM BACK -- GRITS his
teeth, COCKS the trigger and:
A RATTLESNAKE is coiled around a CHANDELIER... except the
chandelier is on the floor and the floor is the CEILING.
Upended gambling tables. WOODRATS scurry over FOOD. Every
window's SMASHED... as if something just TOOK everyone.
Dolar sits by a FIRE made from furniture parts, drinking from a
WHISKEY FLASK. Colorado opposite, rubbing his MANGLED EAR.
DOLARHYDE
You okay?
COLORADO
(low, eyes averted)
Yeah.
Dolar pours some whiskey on a BANDANA, leans towards Colorado --
DOLARHYDE COLORADO
Lemme clean it for you or
it'll get -- -- I'm fine.
Dolarhyde backs away. Colorado GLARES.
DOLARHYDE
Say it.
COLORADO
(after a beat)
Is Percy worth dyin' for?
Dolar's eyes flash. A mixture of anger and PAIN. Then --
DOLARHYDE
He's my son.
(POINTED)
I take care of my kin, Nat.
ON COLORADO as that lands. Clearly, there's something here...
a bond that seems to go deeper than just boss and employee. But
WHAT? Finally Nat just gets up and LEAVES.
Dolar watches him go, takes a healthy SWIG. Hears a WHIMPER.
Looks over and sees... EMMETT, huddled in a corner. CRYING.
49.
ON DOLARHYDE. The kid's naked emotion AFFECTING him, but the
fact Dolar might have a conscience makes him ANGRY too. Low:
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
Hey. Kid.
Emmett looks up, SNIFFLES. Dolar tosses him the WHISKEY FLASK:
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
Take a drink and shut p.
He gets up, walks off. Leaving the kid with the flask. As
Emmett looks at it confusedly, stuffs it in his POCKET --
Meacham has set out TIN PANS under holes to collect RAIN WATER.
Dumps a pan into his CANTEEN as Doc enters with COFFEE for him:
DOC
(re: the tin plates)
We brought enough water.
MEACHAM
Not for drinkin', it's for blessin'.
Doc nods: ah. Turns to go... STOPS. Turns back. Intense eyes:
DOC
Padre... Maria came to see you in
confession every Sunday. It seemed...
she had a lot to talk about.
(beat, this is hard)
Was she having an affair?
Meacham removes his spectacles. Looks at Doc --
MEACHAM
You know I can't say.
And Doc DOES know. But there's a quiet DESPERATION here --
DOC
The last thing I said to her... I...
(shakes his head; then)
Please. If I'm wrong about my wife... I
don't want to die angry.
Meacham sees the PAIN in his friend's eyes.
MEACHAM
You can ask Maria if she was cheatin' on
you once we get her back. 'Til then?
(bit of a grin)
Don't die.
50.
And OFF DOC, thunder CRACKS --
RAIN pours down through an open gash in the roof, splashing the
floor. Ella enters, glances back toward the door to make sure
she's alone, then pulls off her shirt and folds it over a stool.
Upper body NAKED in the moonlight. We catch only a FLASH of
this, and for a moment it's PURE HOTNESS...
. until she turns and something ELSE is revealed: criss-
crossed LASH MARKS on her back.
She turns away and starts to SPLASH herself with water, erasing
the blue goo and dirt from her skin and face... then: A MATCH
ignites behind her. She WHIRLS, startled, covering her breasts
with her arms -- JAKE is sitting in a chair at the Commodore's
desk, casually lighting a cheroot in his mouth:
JAKE
You missed a spot.
ELLA
The hell,-re- you doing here?
JAKE
Mindin' my own business.
(snaps out the match)
Then you decided to take a shower.
ELLA
Why didn't you say anything?
JAKE
Givin' you privacy.
She throws her shirt on, but her skin's wet and the shirt glues
to her, celebrating her shape in a way that can't be ignored.
Jake tosses her his jacket. As she slips it on, she notices a
bottle of WHISKEY on the table... and the PHOTOGRAPH OF ALICE.
ELLA
. she's pretty.
(Jake says NOTHING)
Who was she?
Jake's quiet. DARK. Intense emotion, intensely suppressed:
JAKE
only thing I know's her name was Alice...
(THEN; DISTANT)
And she's dead.
Ella looks up at him. INTO him --
51.
ELLA
Maybe you loved her.
Jake shakes his head, sort of mumble/chuckles in RESISTANCE:
JAKE
All you women are the same -- Always
wanna make it about Goddamn "love."
ELLA
(A BEAT)
Trust me, Lonergan. I'm not the same.
There is a force -- a strength about this woman -- that he
connects with. But remains, true to character, ALOOF:
JAKE
Don't matter.
She takes a step closer. Soft. Intimate.
ELLA
So what dj= matter?
Jake just looks at her. Then, lifts the cheroot to his lips,
the FLARE of its tip casting him in a demonic light...
JAKE
What matters is I find the thing that
killed her.
(dark as hell)
And make it pay.
And now, he leans forward with a focused LOOK... holds up his
BRACELET:
JAKE (CONT'D)
Where'd you see this before?
A beat. Ella -- somehow CONTAINED -- opens her mouth to lie.
But he cuts her off --
JAKE (CONT'D)
-- and don't lie to me. You wouldn't've
asked me if you didn't recognize it.
Ella tightens. PAIN in her eyes. And Jake REALIZES:
JAKE (CONT'D)
Those things... they the ones who put
those marks on your back?
She swallows: a mixture of SHAME that he's found her out... and
ANGER at what was done to her.
52.
ELLA
They took my people. Destroyed where I'm
from.
JAKE
Where's that?
ELLA
North of here. Been trackin' 'em ever
since, town to town. Best I figure,
they're hidin' in a mine.
Jake CONSIDERS all this. Softens a little:
JAKE
Maybe if you'd told me the truth instead
of throwin' rocks at me --
ELLA
-- what, you would've stuck around?
Bullshit. I couldn't've turned you away
from what you had to do, any more than I
could've stopped these people from going
after their kin.
(BEAT)
Truth ain't worth a damn, Jake... and
we're gonna need all the guns we can get.
Their look HOLDS... until Jake SMIRKS. Likes her style:
JAKE
So that's the only reason you wanted me
to come with you? Cause of my gun?
There's a pause... then Ella SMIRKS back:
ELLA
No, not your gun.
(BEAT)
What you do with it.
Among the many things these two ate feeling -- both separately
and together -- the one that pops right now is ATTRACTION.
Confusing as it is for him. The pregnant moment LINGERS...
Until Happy suddenly starts to GROWWWWL, sensing something
outside. ANOTHER CRACK OF THUNDER as:
The horses STAMP NERVOUSLY out the window as Greavey and the
rest of Dolarhyde's men (COBBETT and 4 others) HUDDLE in secret
conference -- whispers that sound a lot like MUTINY --
53.
GREAVEY
What the hell're we doin' here? We
should be ridin' in the opposite
direction of those things --
COBBETT
We do that, the old man's likely to shoot
us himself. Only way outta this is --
And suddenly. Greavey SNIFFS the air, FROWNS:
GREAVEY
. what's that smell?
-- as they TURN to the deck where the creature lays... ALL THEY
FIND IS AN EMPTY TARP FLAPPING AIMLESSLY:
COBBETT
AW SH--
LIGHTNING FLASHES, illuminating the ship -- and als4THE ALIEN
behind them. a coiled mass clinging spiderlike to the ceiling!!!
Its arm WHIPS out, noosing around Cobbett -- LIFTS HIM off his
feet -- SLAMS HIM into the ceiling -- TOSSES HIM like a ragdoll:
The men SHOUT -- a PAIR OF RAZOR SHARP CANINES extrude from the
alien then it SPRINGS -- SLICING THROUGH TWO MEN AT ONCE --
GREAVEY and 2 others manage to SCRAMBLE AWAY:
JAKE AND ELLA
HEAR the SCREAMS -- Happy takes off -- they RACE after him --
DOC AND MEACHAM
Hear them too -- grabs their PISTOLS -- and Doc, his CANTEEN --
DQIRHXPE_. 9oWQ n
Colorado snatches up a WINCHESTER, LOADS IT, throws another one
to Dolar -- who's suddenly, surprisingly, PROTECTIVE of Emmett:
DOLARHYDE
Get behind me, Boy --
THE ALIEN SPRINGS INTO THE ROOM -- landing upside down on the
ceiling. Dolar FIRES at it --
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
RUN, KID! GIT!
Emmett SCRAMBLES down a FLOOR HATCH, disappears as Dolar keeps
FIRING -- but the alien BATS the gun away and LIFTS Dolar UP --
54.
Paralyzed with FEAR, he EXHALES a terrified GASP and --
THE CREATURE RECOILS FROM HIS BREATH! HURLS Dolar aside --
THROUGH THE FIRE -- embers catch CURTAINS and FLAMES SPREAD --
COLORADO races in, throws a TOMAHAWK -- it PINS the alien's claw
to the wall, the monster SHRIEKS as Nat draws a PISTOL but --
The alien SPITS A STICKY RESIN GOB -- it HARDENS, pinning NAT'S
hand with the pistol to the wall in return. He STRUGGLES as the
alien ADVANCES --
BOOM! The Alien's shoulder EXPLODES ORANGE FLUORESCENT BLOOD as
a GUNSHOT rings out -- it's Dolarhyde, back on his feet aid
FIRING -- the monster SCREECHES and leaps down, DISAPPEARING
through the hatch where Emmett fled --
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
GODDAMMITT!!!
And the fire's GROWING around the boat --
EMMETT moves FAST on hands-and-knees through a narrow CRAWLSPACE
-- around a corner here -- another there -- a MAZE --
SOMEWHERE BEHIND HIM -- THE ALIEN -- CRAWLING FAST --
EMMETT -- reaches another HATCH -- pushes through and OUT:
-- DROPPING onto the floor -- as we WHIP TO Jake racing in from
around a corner -- but suddenly: THE ALIEN BURSTS FROM THE HATCH
BEHIND EMMETT, SWEEPING HIM UP IN ITS CLUTCHES:
Jake's bracelet OPENS UP into that BLASTER and it's AIMED at The
Alien but the creature CUPS a hand around Emmett and LIFTS HIM
off the floor, a TALONED FINGER pressed to the boy's THROAT:
STANDOFF. ELLA rushes in. The creature sees her -- HISSES --
JAKE
Don't know if you understand me... but
you hurt that boy and I hurt you.
CLOSE, EMMETT -- MUFFLED, TEARS LEAKING FROM HIS TERRIFIED EYES:
MEACHAM (O.S.)
I=.
RACK FOCUS TO REVEALMEACHAM BEHIND THE ALIEN:
55.
MEACHAM (CONT'D)
BY THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD, GO BACK TO
HELL, DEMON!
Meacham brings his CANTEEN down like a HATCHET, SPRAYING the
alien with HOLY WATER... but NOTHING happens! And then --
The Alien STRIKES -- SLAMMING MEACHAM BACK INTO A JUTTING PIECE
OF IRON, IMPALING HIM --
MEACHAM (CONT'D)
! ! !
The Alien SPRINGS through a doorway, TAKING EMMETT WITH IT.
Ella RUSHES after it as Jake RUNS to Meacham, hanging impaled:
JAKE
Easy, now... Don't move, dammit --
(TURNS; SHOUTING)
DOC -- GET IN HERE NOW!
MEACHAM
Go after the boy... then you get our
people back...
JAKE
Stop talking. DQW! GET YOUR ASS--
But Meacham GRABS Jake, EYE TO EYE. GASPING:
MEACHAM
Listen up... 'cause I'm not gonna be able
to say it again --
(pulls Jake CLOSE)
God don't care who you were, Son... only
who you Mg.
ON JAKE. AFFECTED. With a last RASP, Meacham DIES just as DOC
races through the growing FLAMES -- REACTS -- no time to mourn --
DOC
JAKE -- WE GOTTA GO M!
But Jake can't let go -- FURY -- HEARTBREAK -- Doc PULLS HIM
away -- Jake SNAGS THE CRUCIFIX off Meacham's neck as he's
forced OUT, leaving Meacham's body to be CONSUMED BY FLAMES --
STALACTITES loom from the ceiling -- BAM! EMMETT is DROPPED on
the floor of a sinister cave -- scrambles back from THE ALIEN:
EMMETT
Damn. You are one ugly bastar--
PSST! The alien spits a RESIN GOB on Emmett's mouth -- PSST
PSST! More gobs PIN his limbs to the wall. Emmett can't move --
can't speak -- eyes WIDE and TERRIFIED --
The creature looks down at an ARMOR PLATE on its bicep. Touches
a series of keys and the armor spits out what looks like...
.. a small RUBIK'S CUBE made of some alien alloy.
The creature casually TOSSES IT in the air where it FLOATS and
starts to SPIN -- as it does, its sides FLIP AND TURN (like a
Rubik's Cube) -- emitting HIGH-PITCHED SONAR BEEPS:
This thing's some kind of HOMING BEACON.
Off Emmett's WIDE, GAPING EYES...
As the group gallops into a BOX CANYON, Happy starts BARKING
MADLY -- the horses SLOW --
ELLA
SOMETHING'S WRON--
BLAMBLAN1111 GUNSHOTS from above suddenly PEPPER the ground --
the horses REAR and KICK UP, startled --
A DOZEN FIGURES ON THE CLIFFS ALL AROUND THEM. Badass OUTLAWS
with RIFLES aimed at our heroes. One of them CALLS DOWN:
58.
OUTLAW GUNMAN
EVERYBODY DRAW YOUR GUNS SLOW AND TOSS
'EM ON THE GODDAMNED GROUNDI
SHIT.
SLOWLY, Jake draws his gun... tosses it. Now the rest of them.
As they SEE -- TWO RIDERS -- incoming -- from the other end of
the canyon. Rifles aimed and ready. Happy GROWLS...
One of the outlaws knocks back the hammer on his rifle --
OUTLAW
I say we just shoot 'em and take their--
But the words catch in his throat as his EYES WIDEN:
OUTLAW (CONT'D)
. Boss?
Sure enough, they're looking right at (BRONC
-JAKE. Both outlaws
and HUNT) lower their guns, hostility replaced by SURPRISE:
HUNT
What the hell you doin' back here,
Lonergan?
Oh, Christ. This is JAKE'S gang. ON DOLARHYDE. ELLA.
COLORADO. All registering it. And JAKE, of course, doesn't
REMEMBER these men as Bronc dismounts, NERVOUS:
BRONC
Jesus, Boss... Creek's gonna shit when he
sees you.
(then; re: the others)
And who the hell're they?
ON JAKE. Now does he handle this? Ht:nt rides up next to him,
SUSPICIOUS, and for reasons yet to be known, UNFRIENDLY --
HUNT
What's the matter, Jake. Cat got your--?
SMACKI Jake moves LIGHTNING FAST, SLAPS Hunt across the face,
stopping the question on his tongue -- CATCHES the gun as it
drops and presses the barrel into Hunt's NECK:
JAKE
Since when're Qy the one asking the
goddamned questions!?!
Ella and our people REACT as Jake plays it up, beat defense a
good OFFENSE. The outlaws are SCARED: this is the Lonergan they
know. Hunt holds his BLOODY MOUTH:
59.
HUNT
Christ, Jake... You broke my tooth
JAKE
Quit whining. Now bring me to the rest
of the boys, if that meets with your
goddamn approval.
Bronc and Hunt nod, mounting up, SHOUTING to the OUTLAWS above:
BRONC
LONERGAN'S BACK. MEET US AT THE CAMP!
As they RIDE OFF, Dolarhyde looks to Jake and mutters:
DOLARHYDE
Nice company you keep.
ELLA
What the hell're you doing? If we don't
catch up to that kid, we're never gonna--
JAKE
They called me "Boss." You wanna go
after these things with five or fifty?
(off her look)
Like you said: we can use every gun we
can get.
Qh. That actually makes SENSE. But --
ELLA
What exactly're you gonna say to 'em?
JAKE
(A BEAT)
Tell you when I figure it out.
And he SPURS onward, leaving her to follow uneasily --
CLOSE -- RUBIK'S CUBE -- STILL SPINNING MID-AIR AS:
OUR ALIEN HANGS UPSIDE DOWN from stalactites by four spindly
limbs. Mid sleep cycle. And inches below its head...
EMMETT, still webbed to the wall. Unable to move or speak,
TERRIFIED. As suddenly... the cube DEACTIVATES. And DROPS --
THE CREATURE'S EYES SNAP OPEN. It SPRINGS from the ceiling as
FOUR DARK SHAPES blot out light, GLIDING IN...
MANTRA RAY HOVER SPEEDERS
60.
A gang of FOUR MORE ALIENS dismounts. The biggest and STRONGEST
-- their LEADER -- barks GUTTURAL CLICKS at the alien who
kidnapped Emmett. Kidnapper explaining as it removes another
STRANGE DEVICE. The device beams a HOLO-PROJECTION...
OF ELLA'S FACE! The aliens HISS in furious RECOGNITION.
JESUS... is this some kind of otherworldly WANTED POSTER?
PLUMES fan out angrily from the Leader's HUGE, ELONGATED SKULL --
like an indian headdress! The creature TURNS to Emmett --
It's the alien who killed Jake's woman! We'll come to know it
as... THE SLAVER.
It MOVES OMINOUSLY for Emmett, grasping the HANDLE of something
that UNCOILS with fluid, frightening speed:
A WHITE-HOT LASER WHIP. This will be The Slaver's SIGNATURE
WEAPON. It spirals to its full length, FLASHING out at --
EMMETT -- MUFFLED SCREAM! But... the whip DOESN'T cut him,
instead it SLICES THROUGH THE WEBBING that pins the boy to the
wall. As Emmett FALLS, The Slaver SWEEPS HIM UP -- Emmett
FLAILS, punching, kicking to no avail -- but then:
DOLARHYDE'S FLASK
Tumbles from Emmett's pocket and SPLASHES WHISKEY on The Slaver
-- IT.. S[iRIEM WILDLI-Aa THE BOOZE CONTACTS FLESH, SKIN SMOKING!
EMMETT -- tumbles away. Terror turns to REVELATION as he PULLS
the webbing from his mouth:
EMMETT
Holy SHIT.
Another alien LUNGES for the kid but Emmett SPLASHES him with
the flask -- the alien RECOILS, flesh BUBBLING --
Emmett whirls -- sees the HOVERBIKES -- JUMPS onto one, twisting
desperately at the controls --- IiON-DO , 'T THIS TURNS,__
WO ?!! Another Alien SCUTTLES in FAST -- Emmett's scrambling
boots slide into the foot supports, which automatically WHIR
CLOSED as the bike THROTTLES FORWARD... DECAPITATING THE ALIEN!
The bike SPINS UNCONTROLLABLY, plasma thrusters SCORCHING WALLS
and setting two more aliens ABLAZE! The speeder KAMIKAZE
BOUNCES out of the cavern at 90 MPH, Emmett screaming!
The Slaver SCREECHES FURIOUSLY as the remaining creatures LEAP
back on their speeders and GIVE CHASE!
64.
CREEK JOHNSON
Well I _dg remember you tellin' us you was
leavin' us high and dry because you were
in love... You just left out the part
about taking half our goddamned haul from
the Yuma Bank. So I'm gonna ask you one
last time -- Where. Is. Our. Gold?
-- WHAM! Bull PUNCHES Jake so hard he FLIES OFF HIS FEET:
CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D)
Man can't run away from who he ja,
Lonergan... you really think you could go
straight just cause you were fool enough
to fall in love with some woman?
WHAM! Bull PUNCHES Jake back into oblivion, and on the HIT we:
MEMORY FLASECUTi PEACEFUL SILENCE -- two FACES staring at each
other across a pillow -- Jake and ALICE, naked, in a WHOREHOUSE
BEDROOM SOMEWHERE:
ALICE
You sure you wanna give it all up?
ON JAKE. Clearly TORN. But just as clearly, in LOVE.
JAKE
What about you? Once we're gone, you
ain't ever comin' back.
She touches his face so gently. And whispers:
ALICE
You're the first person ever believed I
was better than this place... so I gotta
believe in y=.
(and she KISSES him)
You're a good man, Jake Lonergan.
PRESENT: as the words "Good Man" ECHO back to Jake. Stir=g_
]11n as Creek GRABS Jake's hair and YANKS BACK, rears up a fist:
CREEK JOHNSON
You figgered you could steal from us?
All that gold was yours to take co you
could go off and start a new life?
Creek's next PUNCH takes us to another:
TORY FLASECUTI REPLAY -- Jake and Alice in the cabin -- he
drops the SADDLEBAG -- it CLINKS to the floor. She's worried:
ALICE
Your boys'ii come after you.
65.
JAKE
(dark, determined)
Let 'em come.
BACK TO PRESENT -- as now Jake UNDERSTANDS the context of this
moment -- what they were saying to each other -- He looks up at
Creek, BEATEN AND BUSTED UP:
JAKE (CONT'D)
Okay... okay, I remember now...
("fuck you" grin)
Demons stole your gold, Creek. But when
you get to hell, you can ask for it back.
CREEK JOHNSON
(TSK'S)
Okay then. That's the way you wanna do
this...
(TURNS)
Kill the whore.
ON THE GANG. As they all cock their guns -- Aimed at Ella --
This is IT --
JAKE -- slowly lifts his head, suddenly RAGE-FILLED as --
HIS WRIST BRACELET ACTIVATES! BLAMMMM11! A SEARING PULSE BLAST
FIRES, VAPORIZING CREEK JUST BEFORE HE PULLS THE TRIGGER!
EVERYONE'S FACES. Holy shit. Jake spits on the around between
the SMOKING BOOTS that formerly belonged to Creek:
JAKE
Told you not to call her that.
ON JAKE. Pure KILLER. As he turns his weapon on the rest of
the (awestruck) gang -- through BLOODY TEETH:
JAKE (CONT'D)
You're all riding with me. Any one of
you decides otherwise? So help me God,
I'll kill you where you stand.
(AND THEN)
I'm j2acj& and I'M in goddamne.d
The gang quickly flips: "Absolutely, Jake/ Whatever you say,
Boss..." Jake turns to the speechless Bull McCade and KICKS HIM
IN THE BALLS as hard as he can, doubling him over.
Now he meets eyes with ELLA. She can't help SMIRKING, grateful.
DOC. Is the only one NOT looking at Jake. His attention drawn
toward a SOUND coming from the distant DUNES --
DOC
Dios mio.
66.
A SPEEDER IS ROARING TOWARD THEM BOUNCING OVER DESERT:
DOLARHYDE
(squints, realizing...)
Jesus... it's the kid.
As Emmett ROARS IN, the shocked outlaws SCATTER:
EMMETT
THEY'RE COMING!!!! THEY'RE COMING!!!
The kid TUMBLES off the speeder as it PLOWS RIGHT THROUGH CAMP,
kicking up DIRT and UPENDING SUPPLIES. As Emmett scrambles up --
VROOOM! FOUR MORE SPEEDERS ROAR OVER THE CREST IN PURSUIT OF
EMMETT! THE ALIENS FROM THE CAVE!
JAKE
EVERYBODY MOOOOVE!!!
STEEL COLLARS START FLYING, ATTACHED TO ROPING CABLES -- BEFORE
THE GANG KNOWS WHAT'S HAPPENING, THEY'RE BEING GRABBED AND
DRAGGED AWAY!
Those who have their wits about them FIRE BACK, trying to hit
the flying machines. CROSSFIRE. CONFUSION.
THE SLAVER
His speeder GROWLS to a halt. Dismounting like a killer biker.
ON JAKE. As he SEES that horrible alien face across the crowd:
QUICK BIT: Alice dying in his arms. And this same damn THING is
the one responsible for it. And we're:
BACK TO PRESENT. Jake's eyes LOCKED on the SLAVER as he says:
JAKE (CONT'D)
You.
BUT THE ACTION COMES ROARING BACK AS:
Outlaws start FIRING at the Slaver, who REACTS in mere
annoyance. Flicks open a POUCH on his bandolier for what look
like THUMB TACKS -- throws them and they tan out, PIERCING THE
NECKS of the outlaws, activating "Blue":
!NTLY E ZE. TUR an
The Slaver draws a ROL) that TELESCOPES into a SIX FOOT LANCE --
KA-TCHING! BARBED ENDS snap out and the alien runs on two
limbs, then FOUR -- LEOPARD-LIKE for speed -- rises back up and
SMASH! SHATTERS each man into a million Pieces. Now he uses
the bladed-ends to SKEWER five more outlaws and turns --
67.
MEETING JAKE'S EYES IN MUTUAL RECOGNITION -- SCREECHES:
JAKE (CONT'D)
(TO DOLARHYDE)
Find cover!!!
Jake FIRES his pulse blaster, providing cover as DOLAR, DOC,
EMMETT, and ELLA rush to hide behind the WAGON. The Aliens FIRE
BACK as LASER CROSSFIRE shreds the camp -- EXPLOSIONS and CHAOS:
THREE OUTLAWS scramble to form a GATLING CREW. It SPINS to
life, MOWING DOWN tents as they try to hit the aliens --
ANOTHER ALIEN
Hurls a boomerang-like "SMART WEAPON." It circles past the
GATLING COWBOYS, BACK into the alien's hand as:
THE TOP HALVES OFTHE_COWBOYS SLIDE OFF, SEVERED AT THE WAIST,'.
An EXPLOSION blows one of whiskey crates open on the wagon:
EMMETT
USE THE WHISKEY! IT BURNS EM!
ELLA
-- WHAT?!
EMMETT
LIKE ACID ON THEIR SKIN!!!
Ella REACTS -- WHAT? As an alien SKITTERS toward her, she grabs
a bottle and HURLS IT -- it EXPLODES all over the creature! A
HORRIBLE SCREECH as its skin smokes, thrashing epileptically --
ELLA
(REVELATION)
Oh my GOD --
DOLARHYDE
LET'S GO!!!
Our people ESCAPE for the horses. Doc climbs up on the WAGON
buckboard and pulls EMMETT in the seat beside him --
As ELLA leaps on a horse --
THE SLAVER
Climbs back on his speeder and GUNS FOR HER, firing a STEEL
COLLAR -- Jake turns -- SEES THIS. Starts RUNNING MADLY:
JAKE
ELLA!!
68.
Too late: KA-CHANK! The collar CLAMPS her neck, RIPPING ELLA
OFF HER HORSE! The CABLE snaps back and attaches to the
hovercraft as it ZIPS by, DRAGGING ELLA BACKWARD LIKE A WATER
SKIER BEHIND A SPEEDBOAT!
ON JAKE -- FURY -- HIS BRACELET ACTIVATES! And there's a LOGIC
here we'll come to realize, as he KICKS his horse into a gallop:
JAKE (CONT'D)
HYAA!
Two PINKERTONS sit by a SAFE. LOOK UP at an unidentified ROAR --
PINKERTON #1
You hear.that?
PINKERTON #2
How many times I gotta tell you, Leonard.
No one'd be stupid enough to rob this tr--
SWWWWWM. IN THE WINDOW BEHIND THEM... THE SPEEDER BLASTS BY.
GOING AGAINST THE TRAIN, ELLA BOUNCING BEHIND IT.
When the Pinkertons SNAP around, Ella's GONE... but now they SEE
JAKE -- ON HORSEBACK -- FLASHING PAST in pursuit!
PINKERTON #2 (CONT'D)

They DRAW GUNS, running to see what's happening and --
69.
The wall EXPLODES INWARD on the Pinkertons -- hurt, but ALIVE --
CLOSE ON ELLA'S DEAD FACE. Still. Beautiful. FIND JAKE, on
his knees beside her, hands bound in front of him. An INDIAN
WOMAN finishes wrapping the body in a shroud and LEAVES.
Jake is alone. Overwhelmed. Raw. Something rising in him.
Something he COULDN'T FACE... until this moment:.
JAKE
I remember now.
(THEN; SOFTLY)
I-- I did love her.
And just saying it, saying those words, brings a swell of
EMOTION to the surface... but he FIGHTS it. A losing battle, as
his eyes WELL:
JAKE (CONT'D)
She was like you. Seemed to think I was
a good man.
(finally, voice almost
CRACKS)
But I couldn't save either of you.
A beat... his bound hands gently touch her face...
JAKE (CONT' D )
Where's the good in that?
His eyes CLOSE. Too much.
JAKE (CONT'D)
I'm sorry, Ella.
And that sits... then suddenly -- JARRINGLY -- THREE MORE BRAVES
roughly enter, pull Jake up, FORCE HIM out:
A deerskin shirt slips down over Ella's naked body.' A dark
breechcloth is tied. She TURNS to us.: beautiful as ever.
The Slaver ENTERS the gloom of an UNDERGROUND CAVERN. Two
ALIENS melt from the dark to greet him with frightening HISSES.
SENTRIES. We HOLD on the walls as something GLITTERS: GOLD.
CLOSE ON SHERIFF TAGGART'S REFLECTION IN MURKY WATER. As we
TILT UP to reveal him hanging UPSIDE DOWN. Eyes flutter open.
He's seen better days. Dazed. Turns his head slightly...
SHERIFF TAGGART
You... all right...?
DRIFTING over to see MARIA. Gravity PULLING her hair downward.
Groggy. Mostly SCARED:
MARIA
(BRAVE FACE)
. Fantastic. You?
CAMERA SLOWLY TURNS, ROTATING 180 DEGREES, TO REVEAL THEY'RE
STUCK TO THE CEILING OVER A WATER GROTTO. The whole town of
Absolution is here... a hundred others from the now-cratered
town of Winfield's Landing, feet embedded in the ORANGE RESIN.
Suddenly, PERCY DOLARHYDE sees a TERRIFYING SHADOW spread across
the wall -- what looks like a HUGE, COILING SNAKE:
PERCY DOLARHYDE
H-- HEY!!! THE HELL'S THA--?!
-- but what comes around the corner is a LONG METAL TENTACLE:
80.
A SCANNING MECHANISM on its tip shoots out a blue triangular
beam -- itemizing specimens -- SELECTING ONE: SHERIFF TAGGART.
Mechanized TALONS open up -- Taggart SCREAMS as he's PLUCKED
from the ceiling like an apple from a TREE:
DEPUTY CHARLIE WADE
KYLE!!!!
ANOTHER METAL TENTACLE slithers in and GRABS WADE -- swinging
our men across the cavern where we reveal...
. the tentacles are attached to a TERRIFYING ALIEN MACHINE.
Taggart and Wade are PINNED DOWN on what looks like an operating
table. As they thrash, RESTRAINING CLAMPS enfold their skulls.
An OCULAR PROBE looms _Q.Xpr. them, This is the image _ e.'_A_beM1_
seeing! This is what haRpened to him before he escaRe !
WORKER-BEE ALIENS adjusts the device over their eyes -- INSTANT
X-RAYS read their retinas -- HYPNOTIC -- as the men grow DOCILE
and LIMP despite their fight and -- FLASHFLASHTLASHI
The probe has ERASED THEIR MINDS. Catatonic stares.
Now the machine arms slip the men into separate TRANSLUCENT
CAPSULES. METAL BREATHING TUBES are implanted down their
throats as the capsules begin to fill with a THICK, BLUE LIQUID.
This is the same blue goo -- a protective gel -- that housed the
COW in that jettisoned cocoon in the desert.
More Worker Bees load the cocoons into TRANSPORT SHUTTLECRAFTS.
We see containment holds filled with BLEATING COWS and REARING
HORSES... all going through a similar cocooning process.
All of this is overseen by THE SLAVER, who stalks up a ramp
behind the cocoons. The craft HUMS to life, undergear
retracting as it ROARS OFF down the tunnel...
The APACHE WOMAN we saw in the drawn-and-quartered scene earlier
is washing clothes on a basin board. She turns as --
Dolarhyde ENTERS. A menacing figure with a blade in the
doorway. She stands, ALERT -- in SUBTITLED APACHE:
THE WOMAN (SUBTITLE)
What are you doing?
Without response, he levels the axe and SLAMS it down on the
FLOORBOARDS. Wood chips SPRAY until a GASH is opened. Dolar
REACHES in... pulling out a CANVAS BAG. A few COINS spill
out... COLD. He picks them up -- looks at the woman:
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE)
Need it to save Nat.
86.
And now her worry becomes FEAR; English now:
THE WOMAN
Is he okay?
DOLARHYDE
He's gonna be.
A storm of mixed emotions in his eyes. That stoic Dolarhyde
veneer starts to CRACK... just a hint... as the woman MOVES to
him... and TOUCHES his face.
And he lets her. WHOA. We realize: this woman is COLORADO'S
MOTHER. Dolarhyde, for all his wicked bluster, LOVES AN APACHE.
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
I won't let anything happen to him,
Jenny.
THE WOMAN
(SOFTLY)
Come back to me.
With that, he's GONE with the gold. Leaving her full of DREAD.
Behind the curtain, they shake off the wet and remove TORCHES
from waterproof buffalo-hide pouches. FIRELIGHT as our team
creeps along in a column. TENSE. Jake glances at Colorado:
JAKE
You and Percy're brothers, huh?
NAT COLORADO
... half.
JAKE
So... your momma and Dolarhyde---
NAT COLORADO
We friends now? Last I checked, you shot
my ear off.
JAKE
(a beat; then)
Want it back?
87.
Colorado GRUMBLES, pushes ahead of Jake...
Our team has travelled far into the bowels of the cavern. Jake
STOPS, torchlight reflecting the GOLD in the cavern walls.
Doc cracks off a piece. POCKETS it. Shrugs:
88.
DOC
In case we live through this.
They SNEAK on down the narrow shaft til they're funneled into...
THE WATER GROTTO
Where our TOWNSPEOPLE were hanging. Now, GONE. Around the
corner, the sound of ENGINES POWERING UP...
A TRANSPORT. A dozen WORKER-BEE ALIENS try to corral the HORSES
from the pen -- cruelly jabbing the animals with ALIEN CATTLE
PRODS. The mares REAR and WHINNY.
JAKE
We're never gonna get close to that ship.
Silently. a DRIPPING. GLISTENING SHAPE rises un from the WATER
behind them. Swaying like a COBRA ready to strike:
Our people TURN... the TUBE ALIEN snatches one of the Apaches,
SWALLOWING HIM in its thorny snout! The indian SCREAMS --
JAKE
Lights a WHISKEY MOLOTOV, hurls it at the CREATURE: BOOM! It
KEENS, BURNING, SPITTING OUT the Apache. ALERTED, the dozen
aliens by the transport SWARM at our heroes!
NAT COLORADO
C g_that shuttle.
Colorado readies his TOMAHAWK -- Jake meets his eyes:
JAKE
Knew there was a good reason I didn't
kill you.
NAT COLORADO
Just thinkin' the same thing.
The men trade FATEFUL LOOKS... then the Indians HURL MOLOTOVS at
the charging horde: KAAA-BOOM! Aliens TWIST and SCREAM --
The Apaches STRIKE FEARLESSLY -- but the aliens quickly RECOVER
and SHAKE THEM OFF, tearing most of them to SHREDS.
The horses BREAK FREE and crash madly through the cavern --
And this is the DISTRACTION Jake and Ella need to make their run,
for the transport -- up the loading ramp:
Ella SLAMS a switch and the ramp DRAWS UP. Jake FREEZES:
COCOONS hang all around, filled with motionless HUMAN BEINGS.
89.
ELLA
Jake - -
(he can only stare)
JAKE.
She slaps open an ENGINEERING HATCH, drops down a LADDER. He
takes a last awful look and SLIDES down after her --
-- the ladder funnels into the COCKPIT. Ella starts TAPPING the
console and HOLO-DISPLAYS appear, Alien text, rotating
graphics. She slides into a SEAT --
ELLA
Strap in. dammit!!!
JAKE
Into what?!?
Ella JAMS a lever forward and the shuttle RISES. JAKE grabs
WEBBING that must be some type of SEATBELT, feeling the
sensation of ELLQU as:
Ella pilots the ship UPWARD, thrusters belching a WAKE OF FIRE
that SCORCHES cavern walls and INCINERATES 6 ALIENS!
As a HORSE streaks by, Colorado grabs a hunk of mane, LEAPS ON --
NAT COLORADO (SUBTITLE)
LET'S GO!!!
DOC comes RUNNING frantically:
DOC
DON'T LEAVE ME!!!
Colorado PULLS Doc up onto the horse's bare back -- no easy task
with Doc's 300 POUNDS. The remaining Apaches (5) commandeer
horses and GALLOP HARD down the tunnel --
Two aliens jump on MANTA-SPEEDERS in pursuit!
THE TRANSPORT SHUTTLE KAMIKAZES THROUGH BI-SECTING TUNNELS:
Jake has NEVER moved this fast, BARELY avoiding walls as Ella
expertly pilots the ship. LEFT -- RIGHT -- SIDEWAYS -- up
ahead, DIM LIGHT spills from a FISSURE leading above ground:
ELLA
Hold on.
90.
She cranks back and the ship PITCHES upward --
The shuttle BURSTS OUT into the canyon and skates the rim. Jake
fights the G-FORCES and teeth-rattling TURBULENCE as --
The craft keeps spiralling UP UP toward... THE OMINOUS CLOUD.
As we come closer, an IMPOSSIBLY BLUE GLOW blinds us:
The rest of our heroes GALLOP FAST out the criss-crossing
tunnels -- KA-CHINNNG! Apaches are CLAMPED WITH STEEL COLLARS
and YANKED off their horses as the SPEEDERS roar in from behind!
Colorado VEERS toward a LIGHT as Doc ignites a molotov and they:
GALLOP Out into daylight, rigb-t_through the CENTER of the fort --
Doc THROWS his molotov and BOOM!!! Aliens go FLYING, on fire!
Doc throws another MOLOTOV, clearing a path for Colorado to RIDE
HARD for the fort's 30 FT. STEEL ENTRY GATES... which start
SWINGING CLOSED to trap them!
But at the LAST SECOND, the horse SLIPS THROUGH the narrow
opening as it THUNDERS CLOSED. Now the aliens are pissed off:
Colorado and Doc ZIG-ZAG around CURVES -- like mice navigatinga
maze, so the speeders can't get a clear shot:
DOC
They're gaining on us!
91.
NAT COLORADO
That's the point!
And just when it looks like Doc and Colorado are GONERS...
BOOM! An EXPLOSION rocks the canyon as something HURTLES DOWN
from above -- WHISKEY MOLOTOVS fired from the handmade
CATAPULTS. BOOM! BOOM! Aliens are VAPORIZED, SHRIEKING!
A cloudburst of FLAMING ARROWS brightens the sky as 20 APACHES
RISE UP along the canyon rims: A AMBUSH!
An ASSEMBLY LINE OF SQUAWS works like a drill team, soaking
WHISKEY RAGS and wrapping arrows. Among them, EMMETT and HAPPY!
The kid pocks an arrow like a damn EXPERT -- IGNITES it -- lets
it FLY -- WHOOSH! It SKEWERS a speeder pilot who BURSTS INTO
FLAMES, the speeder CORKSCREWS into another one, both EXPLODING:
EMMETT
YEAHHHHH!!!
THE ALIENS
Caught OFF-GUARD with NO WM TO TURN AROUND as from the OPPOSITE
END of the canyon, a BELLOWING WAR WHOOP:
GREY WOLF AND HIS 40 APACHES CHARGE IN. A MOVING HUMAN WALL
CRASH! The Apaches HURTLE into the flank of aliens. LASERS are
met with the CRACK of RIFLES and hatchets --
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
TAKE THE FORT! ! !
The Apache leader spurs his horse onward, leading men toward the
alien bunker. An EXPLOSION CONSUMES FRAME, becoming the:
The shuttle sweeps past the command center's polarized window,
where... THE SLAVER watches with EVIL EYES.
He's on the UPPER LEVEL of a TWO-TIER COMMAND CENTER. A DOZEN
ALIENS operate holo-consoles. Readying the ship to leave.
Ella settles down on a GLOWING DOCKING COLLAR. With the two
ships CONNECTED, the DISPLAY flashes a DEPARTURE ALERT:
92.
ELLA JAKE
-- Dammit --- -- what--?
-- WHAT'S WRQNG?
-- she's CLIMBING back up the ladder, he FOLLOWS:
They quickly CLIMB up the LADDER TUBE --
ELLA
Engines are warming up -- got eight
minutes til the ship leaves, and about
one til automated retrieval --
JAKE
-- autojamated what --?
As they spill into the LOADING BAY, a CLANG reverberates:
THE AIRLOCK DOOR -- AT THEIRFEyT
The first EXPLOSIVE BOLT shoots off. Ella jams her SHOTGUN into
a sheath on her back, presses herself flat:
ELLA
Hug the wall.
Jake does that beside her as the next bolt PINGS out --
ELLA (CONT'D)
When they come at us, aim for their
heads. Only way to kill 'em for sure.
He looks at his bracelet, adrenaline SURGING -- it ACTIVATES:
JAKE
I'll aim just fine.
THE LAST BOLT FIRES and the airlock door SHOOTS OFF:
A MULTI- D HYDRAULIC "GRABBER" RISES INTO THE MECHANICAL
LIMBS SWINGING AROUND INCHES FROM THEIR FACES!
JAKE (CONT'D)
SonofaBITCH!
The manipulator arms SCOOP UP COCOONS, pulling them DOWN the
AIRLOCK:
ELLA
C'MON!
She JUMPS through the airlock -- Jake has no time to think:
93.
JAKE
DAMMIT --
And JUMPS after her --
-- LANDING beside Ella. Starts to pick himself up... but what
he sees ASSAULTS HIS MIND. We RISE UP UP UP, Ella and Jake
growing SMALLER in what we now reveal is a MASSIVE HANGAR where:
AUTOMATED -ARMS PLANT RECENT ARRIVALS INTO A VERITABLE FOREST of
PEOPLE AND ANIMALS. Level after level, THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS
OF COCOONS are suspended from branch-like limbs.
Jake picks himself up, looking around the massive hangar in AWE.
ELLA
CIDYAPLQLWJJ
-- she PULLS HIM into an alcove as a machine arm SWINGS
overhead, flashing a WIDE CONICAL LASER that inventories cocoons
like the machine in the underground cave. As they CROUCH:
ELLA (CONT'D)
We can't let that thing see us or they'll
know we're here.
She turns -- hits buttons on a console -- a door SLIDES UP
leading to a series of CORRIDORS. She starts to MOVE --
ELLA (CONT'D)
This'll take us to the bridge --
But Jake doesn't follow. STARES at her --
JAKE
Slaver's up there--?
ELLA
I sure as hell hope not.
JAKE
Then I'm not goin' with you.
And now she HARDENS --
ELLA
You got any idea how big this ship is?
No ray you'll ever find him alone. Be
like findin' a needle in a--
-- SLAM!! Jake interrupts her by aiming at the LASER SCANNER
and FIRING HIS BLASTER, blowing it apart. The scanner eye
CRASHES to the floor, flaming. A KLAXON rings --
94.
JAKE
I ain't gonna find him. He's gonna find
me.
ELLA'S FURIOUS:
ELLA
Thanks for the head start.
She turns and RUNS. Jake moves to that scanner eye on the
floor, walks right up to it and STARES into the shattered IRIS:
JAKE
Alright, you sonofabitch... come and get
me.
JAKE'S FACE APPEARS AS A THERMAL HEAT SOURCE -- fritzing as he
stares into the scanner. ALARMS scream.
THE SLAVER fills with RAGE. And RECOGNITION.
Aliens begin grabbing WEAPONS but The Slaver SHRIEKS for them to
STOP. We don't need to speak alien to understand:
"He's mine. "
Jake has moved out into the corridors -- blaster ready -- eyes
darting -- suddenly -- WHAM:
A STEEL BARRICADE SLAMS DOWN BEHIND HIM. WHAM! Another in
front -- WHAM! He's TRAPPED, shut off from the passageways...
.. except ONE. A long, dark tunnel. A DOOR at the far end
HISSES open: THE TURBOLIFT ELEVATOR.
ON JAKE. Understanding... his call is bging answe
JAKE
(QUIETLY; HARD)
Okay.
And starts walking to the elevator... as a SCREAM takes us to:
Handmade LADDERS are SWUNG FORWARD onto the fort as Apaches try
to SCALE the wall, but are BLOWN BACK by ALIEN PARAPET SENTRIES.
ON DOC -- running TRIAGE on wounded warriors:
95.
DOC
I need more bandages now!/ You: lint and
splint that leg!
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
We're losing ranks ! ! !
And then, out of nowhere... the BANG BANG BANG of 30 pistols
fills the air as --
DOLARHYDE RIDES IN WITH JAKE'S GANG! A renewed SURGE of energy
as cowboys join Indians to fortify their ranks:
NAT COLORADO
You came back!
DOLARHYDE
Told you: I take care of my kin.
Colorado knows that's as close to "I love you" as he'll ever
get. But the UPSWING is short-lived as:
A speeder WHIZZES past, dropping a METALLIC BUNDLE. It splits
open right in front of the fort's STEEL GATES -- pieces
hydraulically ASSEMBLING THEMSELVES in seconds, becoming:
THE MOTHERFUCKING SUPERGUN_OF DEATH. TWO LETHAL BARRELS spin to
life, firing STRANGE STEEL BALL BEARINGS in every direction.
CLAW HOOKS snap out of the balls, EMBEDDING in soldiers! One
LODGES in a GANG MEMBER beside DOC -- he FLAILS:
GANG MEMBER
HELP ME!!! GET IT OFF!
A RED SPRING-LOADED PIN depresses in the ball's center: KA-BOOM!
SEARING WHITE LIGHT TURNS THE OFFICER TOAASH -- AN ALIEN
GRENADE! Doc goes FLYING from the kickback, landing near:
GREY WOLF -- FWWWWTWHCK!!! Another claw-ball CLAMPS into the
Apache's SHOULDER -- he SHOUTS, struggles to pull it out --
DOC
DON'T. STOP, DAMMIT!!!!
The RED PIN starts to depress -- pOC LUNGES, JAMS HIS FINGER
RETJff&H;_THE PIN AND BLASTING CAP. Now he's stopped it from
exploding, but if he pulls his finger out... HE DIES TOO.
DOC and GREY WOLF lock eyes. Their fates suddenly ENTWINED as --
Bars of light move rhythmically across Jake's face -- BURNING
with determination -- as he travels up in the turbolift. It
slows to a STOP. The door cycles open and --
96.
-- the STRANGEST THING happens. DESERT SAND billows in a gust
of ventilated air. SAND?! Jake emerges, blocking his eyes:
-- the sand swirls and eddies. Visibility reduced to ZERO. As
Jake pushes through, the air clears a little...
His eyes WIDEN. Trying to make SENSE of what he sees:
Remember all those BUILDINGS that were pulled up into the
tornado when Absolution was attacked? And that CRATER they
found that used to be "Winfield's Landing"? It-'-s all-HE
in a junkwle hangar. Building pieces. False front
facades. Debris piled on top of each other, TILTED AND TWISTED
AT FUNHOUSE ANGLES. And the desert sand that was sucked up
along with it all.
A GLOWING REACTOR casts hellish light on the dormant wreckage.
Weapon ready, Jake moves past part of A BROTHEL. Jutting
fragments of a HORSE CORRAL. A CREAKING SALOON SIGN swings like
a pendulum, CLANKS EERILY.
A STEAM PIPE EXPLODES STEAM. Jake WHIRLS -- and like demons...
5 ALIENS emerge. Slowly. Fanning out, taking positions as...
THE SLAVER steps out of the smoke, squarely facing Jake. aAd_h@--
is holding ELLA hostage. WRIST BLASTER pressed to her throat.
Jake and Ella LOCK EYES. She's terrified, but staying STRONG.
His hand LINGERS at his hip, blaster ready.
JAKE
Drop the woman. We both know this ain't
about her.
But The Slaver only presses his blaster HARDER into Ella's neck.
Almost GRINNING. And Jake MEETS the look --
JAKE (CONT'D)
She says you're as bad as they come.
Jake curls back the fingers on both hands, CRACKING knuckles:
JAKE (CONT'D)
Well, you ugly sonofabitch... they say
the same about me.
A pipe SPEWS STEAM -- UNNERVINGLY LOUD. Then STOPS.
JAKE (CONT'D)
Could'a had your boys kill me five times
over, instead you rolled out the red
carpet... so let's get it over with.
97.
The Slaver HISSES ANGRILY at the challenge. PUSHES Ella roughly
off to one of his GANG, who keeps a blaster pressed to her side.
Vow ' O right the a ter of the "town" junkpile.
THE SLAVER -- his hand at his side, twitching.
JAKE -- his hand is still.
A PIPE SPRAYS STEAM AGAIN, SCREAMINGLY LOUD AND --
Everyone DRAWS! But Jake's INSANELY FAST as he drops to a knee
and FIRES gunsmoke-style -- BLAM SLAM! The Slaver's HIT and --
ELLA -- WRENCHES her captor's arm backward and he fires USELESS
ROUNDS into the air -- she takes a HIT in the leg as Jake SHOOTS
the captor with a SHOT to the temple --
Jake GRABS and PULLS Ella to safety behind a SHREDDED STORE
FRONT, taking cover -- lasers PUNCHING through the building
walls -- Ella spots an ALIEN lunging around a corner:
ELLA
BEHIND YOU!!!
Jake WHIRLS, SLAM!!! The creature FLIES off its feet.
JAKE
Stay down.
Ella does, and here come the rest of the aliens as Jake GUNS
THEM ALL DOWN WITH PERFECT AIM.
The REACTOR is hit in the crossfire and the ship RESPONDS with a
turbine HOWL.
Corpses litter the floor... all except for The Slaver. A trail
of FLUORESCENT BLOOD leads around the corner...
Jake WHIRLS to Ella -- her leg wounded --
JAKE (CONT'D)
-- you alright?
In PAIN, she snatches one of those SMART DISCS off a dead alien:
ELLA
Reactor's hit. if I don't get this ship
on the ground soon, we're all dead...
(tries to STAND, WINCES)
Get me over to that turbolift.
He slings an arm around her shoulder and LIFTS her, helping her
to the elevator --
98.
ELLA (CONT'D)
Put me inside.
He does. She sees his eyes go back to The Slaver's BLOOD TRAIL:
ELLA (CONT'D)
I can manage the rest without you.
(tough... but with
COMPASSION)
Go do what you came up here to do.
He looks at her. At the blood. At the unstable REACTOR.
And Jake Lonergan makes a CHOICE:
JAKE
Goddamnit.
-- he gets INTO THE ELEVATOR with her. She SLAMS the control
pad, doors CLOSE -- they start rocketing upward. She half-grins
as her eyes hold on him. And within them... trust. AND FAITH.
JAKE (CONT'D)
Stop smiling.
The small ALIEN BRIDGE CREW scrambles to control the damaged
ship. The WHIR of the lift arriving, doors OPEN and --
WHOOSH! The SMART WEAPON blurs out of the elevator, SLICING
HALF A DOZEN ALIENS IN HALF -- circles back around to ELLA, who
skillfully catches it as she RUN/LIMPS from the lift with JAKE --
LASER FIRE IGNITES THE BRIDGE as he makes QUICK WORK of the rest
and Ella mans a console, getting to work --
ELLA
We're going down fast.
She calls up telemetry on a HOLO-WINDOW: EARTH TERRAIN -- The
BATTLEFIELD. Sets coordinates, vectoring the ship that way:
A WHIR as a SECOND TURBOLIFT arrives... AND THE SLAVER STEPS
QQT. Wounded, and very PISSED OFF. Jake says to Ella:
JAKE
No matter what.
Jake and The Slaver HURTLE into each other, TUMBLE off a
catwalk, CRASHING into conduits and GUNKY WATER below.
Jake staggers up but The Slaver is HUGE -- SLAMS Jake back into
the water. PINS A FOOT on his blaster arm -- CRUSHING IT.
Jake HOWLS as The Slaver presses a series of those HIEROGLYPH
MARKINGS on Jake's BRACELET -- the symbols LIGHT UP in an UNLOCK
CODE -- and KA-CHING! The bracelet POPS OF.E.
The Slaver TOSSES IT into the gunky water. Draws his LASER WHIP
-- WHUP-SNAP! The white-hot tip LASHES JAKE'S BACK, ripping his
shirt and BURN-SCARRING HIS BACK!
Jake SCREAMS in agony as The Slaver WHIPS HIM MERCILESSLY --
Another LASER WHIP SNAP and Jake seems DONE. Now The Slaver
LIFTS Jake from the water, CRUSHING his wind-pipe.
Jake FLAILS, REACHING for something BELOW FRAME... finally GRABS
and STABS it into The Slaver's side. The Alien ROARS in pain
and looks down to see --
ONE OF HIS OWN "ICE TACKS" FROM HIS BANDOLIER EMBEDDED IN HIS
SIDE. IT STARTS TO GLOW BLUE WITH A HIGH-PITCH WHINE:
JAKE
Go to hell.
THE SLAVER'S ROAR OF DEFEAT IS CUT SHORT AS THE MOTHERFUCKER
FREEZES TO GREY STONE. EXPLODING IN A MILLION PIECES!!!
Jake DROPS, GASPING. Revenge fulfilled. Painfully starts
CLIMBING a ladder back to the upper deck --
Jake FALLS into the seat beside Ella, straps in. Fighting the
controls, she SEES THE WHIP MARKS on his back. It TEARS her
heart open. And because this might be the end... she ADMITS:
ELLA
I lied.
JAKE
... I know.
ELLA
No, I heard what you said when I was
layin' there...
103.
JAKE. Taken aback. LAID BARE. As she says:
ELLA (CONT'D)
You are a good man. At least... to me.
The ground GROWS BIGGER out the window. Her HAND reaches over
for his. JAKE'S HAND clasps hers and --
DOC AND MARIA burst through a door, tearing passionately at each
other's CLOTHES -- Maria MOANS as Doc kisses her neck:
DOC MARIA
SHH! The workers will hear
us!!! Let them hear!
As they TUMBLE back onto the bed, Doc LURCHES. Reaches under
his back to find... a GOLD POCKETWATCH.
DOC
What is this?
MARIA
Look at the inscription.
He flips it open to find an ENGRAVING: "MI CORAZON... POR
SIEMPRE." Doc looks up at her, MOVED. Then -- PLAYFULLY:
DOC
This looks like Aldo Mayberry's watch...
MARIA
Shut up and kiss me.
She pulls him down, OUT OF FRAME --
