And we find a Sudanese family asleep on reed mats. A mother, father
and their two boys. The younger boy we'll come to know as "WILLIAM"
(9). His older brother "CHRISTOPHER" (12) curled next to him.
The family still sound asleep, oblivious to the torch glow coming
from outside, and suddenly --
SCREAMING! -- GUNSHOTS!
The family bolts awake, moving to their feet as the door to their
tukul SLAMS open -- THREE soldiers from the Lord's Resistance Army
(LRA) coming in carrying AK47's -- shouting in Arabic -- "Get up!
Get up!" -- the FATHER stepping forward -- holding up his hands --
"Don't shoot!" --
KAK! KAK! KAK!
And he's gunned down in cold blood. The soldiers grab the mother and
boys and begin to drag them out of the tukul -- but WILLIAM breaks
free -- scrambles deeper into the room --
THE SOLDIER going after him -- WILLIAM darting behind a stack of
storage boxes knocking them to the ground -- frantically burrowing
into the corner -- trying to get away but it's useless -- THE
SOLDIER grabs his feet and begins to pull him out -- WILLIAM KICKING
WILDLY -- digging his nails into the dirt -- and as he's dragged out
of the corner he reaches out... inadvertently grabs a FADED
PHOTOGRAPH which has fallen on the ground...
And we see SAM CHILDERS coming down a corridor toward us, dressed in
jailhouse orange and flanked by a guard. He's stocky, 32 years old,
with a biker's handlebar moustache. On the surface he appears good-
looking... even handsome if the light is right... but his face is
tricky... always changing... behind the quick smile, around his dark
eyes, in the taut muscles of his neck we see violence.
We see a CLERK handing Sam a prison issue tub full of his personal
affects. He takes out his clothes, digs out a leather wallet, a
watch, some silver rings and a lighter.
He looks up to the Clerk and flashes a malicious smile --
SAM
Ya'll go fuck yourself now, k?
3
The Vega pulled of the side of the road and Sam fucking Lynn in the
back. There's nothing tender about what we're watching here. Sam
finishes and Lynn slumps into the seat, pulls down her dress.
SAM
Gimme a smoke.
LYNN
Don't got any.
SAM
What, you quit?
(LYNN NODS)
Shit, that ain't gonna last.
LYNN
(TO PAIGE)
You excited, get some juice, help me set
the table.
Sam and Daisy enter.
There's a quiet anxiety to this homecoming. Everybody on edge,
careful.
LYNN (CONT'D)
Hope you're staying for supper.
DAISY
Well, I didn't know if...
SAM
(TO LYNN)
What time you gotta work?
Lynn hesitating, not sure how to answer... not sure what's going to
happen when she does... finally...
LYNN
I ain't on tonight.
SAM
What?
DAISY
(changing the subject)
You know we could boil up that corn we
got in there...
SAM
Friday night you ain't on? Hell is that?
He walks toward the fridge.
LYNN
Paige, get that chair.
SAM
That cocksucker Mark better be givin you
yer time or I'm gonna go over there and
bust in his teeth. Why ain't there no
beer?
5
LYNN
I ain't dancin no more, Sam.
He turns to her, studies her with cold eyes...
LYNN (CONT'D)
Quit a couple weeks ago. Got a job over
at Freemont.
SAM
You tellin me the truth or is this a
joke?
LYNN
Pick up a second shift now and then.
Weekends if I want em. It's good money.
SAM
Good money? You stupid, woman? You quit
strippin to pack fucking mushrooms at
Freemont?
DAISY
Sam...
SAM
Mom, keep yer mouth shut.
Sam's face changing, starting to turn bad. A look we'll come to
know.
LYNN
They're good to me over there, Sam. They
got daycare for Paige and I can get
medical at the end of the year.
SAM
Tell you what you're gonna do, you're
goin back to The Bunny Hop and askin that
cocksucker for yer old slot back...
DAISY
(TO PAIGE)
You ok? Let's ride our bikes outside.
LYNN
No, Sam...
SAM
Fuck you ain't. You gonna get that ass
back up there and make yer tips.
LYNN
It ain't right.
6
SAM
Fuck you talkin about?
Daisy scooping up Paige and exiting, screen door slamming behind
them and now Sam and Lynn are all alone.
LYNN
I ain't dancin cause it ain't right in
God's eyes. He don't want me doin that no
more.
SAM
(LAUGHING)
You found god now, huh? That what this
is?
LYNN
He found me, and he's there for you too,
baby.
SAM
Don't gimme that bullshit. You a junkie
stripper...
LYNN
Not no more. God helped me change while
you was away.
Lynn reaches for him but he shoves her back violently...
SAM
Gitcha hands off me!
Sam exits.
LYNN
(TO HERSELF)
You can't keep goin the way you goin,
baby...
A tough biker bar in Johnstown, PA. A jukebox in the corner playing
Lynard Skynard. Sam coming through the door, AD-LIBBED greetings
from some of the other bikers here. He makes his way to a back table
where a hulking biker in a leather vest named DONNIE is sitting with
two girls. Donnie looks up, sees Sam...
7
DONNIE
Crazyhorse! There he is...
They embrace, old friends.
DONNIE (CONT'D)
Figured you'd be rollin out round now.
How you doin, buddy?
SAM
I'm doin.
DONNIE
(to one of the girls)
Get us a coupla shots and buds.
(SAM SITS)
Don't look too worse for the wear.
SAM
I'm alright.
DONNIE
Heard yer old lady ain't at the Bunny Hop
no more.
SAM
Bitch found Jesus.
DONNIE
Damn! That bearded sonuvagun slipped her
the high holy dick while you was in the
can, huh? Better him than the milk man, I
guess.
SAM
Ain't so sure bout that.
Donnie laughs, slaps him on the shoulder...
DONNIE
You wanna taste?
Sam smiles that wicked smile and we go --
-- as a biker chick leads Sam down this hallway into --
Sam and the biker chick crammed into this dirty stall, Skynard
pounding through the walls. He rolls up his shirt sleeve as she
cooks a spoon of methamphetamine... juices a hypodermic... he finds
a vein and she spikes his arm... presses the plunger and his head
rolls back on his shoulders... speed slamming into his bloodstream
as we RAMP UP THE MUSIC.
8
Snow piled up on the windowsills and it's cold as shit outside. Sam
passed out on the couch and this guy looks like hell.
Thinner than the last time we saw him, skin sallow and drawn tight
over his face. He stirs awake, sees Paige playing by herself on the
floor next to him. She sees that he's awake, picks up her doll, and
quietly goes outside without saying a word.
Sam coming in, taking a piss, staring at himself in the mirror and
we see a junkie map of track marks running up and down his arms. And
then WE HEAR a Pentecostal communion hymn, "the Old Rugged Cross",
coming through... taking us to...
A congregation packed into this church for Sunday service. We see
Lynn and Paige in the crowd, singing along with the congregation.
Sam and Donnie in this car, parked in front of broken down clapboard
houses. Donnie pointing through the windshield...
DONNIE
Right there. With the green light.
DOOR SPLINTERING OPEN! -- concussion like a fucking pipe bomb --
wood splintering through the room like shrapnel -- Sam and Donnie
STORMING IN...
DONNIE
Don't fuckin move!
INSTANT PANDEMONIUM! -- JUNKIES hopping off the couch, scattering
like rats deeper into the house -- SHAVED HEAD darting out of the
room -- Sam leveling the MOSSBERG in his direction --
BOOOM! -- the room flashing like a fucking supernova.
SHAVED HEAD scrambling up these stairs -- Sam coming up after him --
hunting him -- MOSSBERG BLASTING in his direction -- BOOOM! --
SHAVED HEAD sprinting down this hallway -- Sam tracking him in the
b.g. -- bloodlust in his eyes -- leveling the MOSSBERG and --
BOOOM! -- BOOOM!
Shotgun slugs ripping through the house like cannon shot -- SHAVED
HEAD bolting through the smoke -- crashing through a door into --
-- SHAVED HEAD bombing in -- hitting the ground -- trying to get to
his feet but it's too late because --
-- SAM kicks open the door behind him -- SHAVED HEAD going onto his
back, trying to crab crawl away from him but there's nowhere to go --
Sam moving closer --
SHAVED HEAD
PLEASE, MAN -- DON'T --
-- SHAVED HEAD working his way into a corner -- holding his hands in
front of his face -- terrified, shaking --
SHAVED HEAD (CONT'D)
-- PLEASE! --
10
DONNIE (O.S.)
SAM!
Donnie coming into the room --
SHAVED HEAD
I'LL GIVE YOU WHAT YOU WANT, MAN! --
PLEASE! --
SAM
Tell me where the shit is or I'll blow
yer nigger brains all over this floor.
SHAVED HEAD
(indicating a closet)
In there...
Sam KICKS him toward the closet --
SAME
Hurry the fuck up.
SHAVED HEAD crawling to a small safe in a closet, spins the combo,
opens it and pulls out six ounces of uncut cocaine.
SAM
Cash!
SHAVED HEAD grabs a stack of hundreds, hands it to Sam and --
CRACKKK! -- he SLAMS the butt of the Mossberg into SHAVED HEAD'S
face and he hits the ground on his back -- Sam standing over him --
shoves the barrel of the shotgun into his mouth --
DONNIE
C'mon, let's go!
But Sam's not moving... just staring down at SHAVED HEAD... and
we're watching something here... a terrible intelligence taking
over... something bloodless and inhuman coming over Sam in this
moment... and he chambers a slug into the shotgun...
DONNIE (CONT'D)
Fuck are you doin?!
And this is it. He's going to blow this guys brains all over the
floor...
DONNIE (CONT'D)
Sam...
His finger curls around the trigger, eyes becoming lethal...
DONNIE (CONT'D)
Sam!
And he snaps back, looks around, sees Donnie standing there...
11
DONNIE (CONT'D)
We need to get the fuck outta here!
MUSIC LOUD AS IT GOES! -- SCREAMING! -- Sam and Donnie pumped and
celebrating after the robbery. Sam in the passenger seat, already
cooking coke in a bent spoon...
SAM
See that nigger's face when I put it in
his mouth?
DONNIE
Cook that shit up, man! I wanna hit when
I'm going a hundred miles an hour in this
thing.
Sam juices a needle and spikes Donnie's arm. Donnie feeling the
rush... pressing on the gas and howling like a wild man... both of
them wired out of their heads... BLASTING down this dark, country
road... and then they see...
A HITCHHIKER
Up the road, standing in this bitter cold with his thumb out.
SAM
Look at this sorry fucker...
The Hitchhiker climbing into the backseat. He's late 40's, a
drifter, probably American Indian. Donnie starts driving.
SAM
Cold enough for ya out there, boy?
DRIFTER
Yeah.
DONNIE
Where you goin, man?
DRIFTER
Dunshore.
SAM
That's up there past Muncy, right?
DRIFTER
Yeah.
12
DONNIE
We can take you far as McClure.
DRIFTER
Take me to Dunshore.
Sam looking back --
SAM
We ain't goin to Dunshore, boy. Said we
can drop you at McClure.
Suddenly -- silver flashing -- A BLADE -- out of nowhere -- pressed
into Donnie's neck from the backseat -- the Drifter pulling him
tight against the seat rest, pressing it into his throat --
DONNIE
What the fuck?!
DRIFTER
Keep drivin! Dunshore or I'll cut his
fuckin throat.
SAM
Get that fuckin blade off him...
Sam reaches his leg over and STOMPS ON THE GAS PEDDLE -- the car
LURCHES forward -- accelerating --
DONNIE
Sam!
DRIFTER
SLOW THE FUCK DOWN!
But Sam's not letting up... pressing down on the peddle hard...
90... 100... 110 mph -- Donnie YELLING -- trying to keep the car on
the road -- MUSIC BLARING -- like some wild ride to hell and then --
SAM SUDDENLY JUMPS IN THE BACKSEAT -- wrestling with the drifter --
fighting wild -- elbowing him in the face and somehow the blade is
in his hand now -- and --
Stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, stick!
He stabs him six times in the gut. The drifter HOWLING in pain.
Lynn sound asleep in bed. And she slowly stirs awake, hears water
running from somewhere in the trailer.
Lynn moving down the hall... toward a sliver of light coming from
under the closed bathroom door... gently pushing it open to see --
Sam standing at the sink... covered in blood... frantically trying
to clean himself up... trying to wash the sin from his skin and
clothes but it's useless... and the sense we get is that we're
staring at a man at the edge of an abyss... set to swallow him
whole... terrified... shaking...
... and now he realizes Lynn is here and he turns to her... holding
up his stained hands... a terrible fear in his eyes when he says...
SAM
Help me.
And we find Sam in this bedroom all alone, wearing a thrift store
sportcoat, sitting on the edge of the bed. Frozen. Staring at his
stocking feet and three or four pairs of workboots scattered on the
floor.
Lynn steps into the doorway...
VOICE (O.S.)
Honey? You ready?
Sam turns to her, and he looks lost here. Like a little boy.
SAM
I don't got no good shoes, Lynn.
And she comes into the room, sits on the bed next to him, puts an
arm around his shoulder.
LYNN
He don't care what kinda shoes you
wearin, baby.
14
Packed with Sunday families listening to Pastor Krause at the
pulpit. Behind him we see a BAPTISMAL TANK filled with water. And
now we see Sam, Lynn, Paige, and Daisy sitting near the back. Sam
looks uncomfortable, on edge.
PASTOR KRAUSE
The point of receiving God's word is
life. Life upon life. And to accept the
blood of Jesus is life upon life upon
life...
CONGREGATION
Praise be to God!
PASTOR KRAUSE
He breathes his spirit into darkness and
makes something good. He sees our shadow
and says, `let there be light!"
CONGREGATION
Amen!
PASTOR KRAUSE
... now proclaim his saving grace! If
there are sinners here looking for God
raise your hands!
A few hands shoot up --
PASTOR KRAUSE (CONT'D)
Stand up! Receive Jesus Christ as your
light and saviour...
Three or four people moving to their feet, making their way up to
the altar. Lynn turns to Sam, their eyes meet. He looks hesitant,
unsure. She gives him a reserved little smile, nods her head
slightly as if saying "you can do this"...
And in her look he finds strength, gets up, slowly makes his way
to...
FRONT ALTAR
And now we see Sam on his knees in the baptismal tank. The water
almost up to his waist. Pastor Krause kneeling behind him.
PASTOR KRAUSE (CONT'D)
Receive Jesus as your Lord and Saviour...
in the name of the father and of the son
and of the Holy Ghost...
... and he leans Sam back, cradling his head as he submerges him in
the water completely... and when Sam comes back up the church breaks
into ROWDY HALLELUJAHS!... and we see Lynn... tears in her eyes...
15
clapping in the back row... and an organist and singer begin to sing
"Amazing Grace" taking us to...
OMITTED
A WOMAN stares down at her desk with a frown, shaking her head. Sam
sitting in a small chair in front of her.
WOMAN
I got somethin in Pitt, but you gotta
have some college for that.
SAM
I'm a hard worker and I learn real fast.
WOMAN
But you got no education, Mr. Childers.
Sam on the edge of Paige's bed reading her a CHILDREN'S BOOK.
SAM
(READING)
"Into the street the Piper stept, smiling
first a little smile, then three shrill
notes the pipe uttered like a great and
mighty army muttered..."
PAIGE
What's uttered?
SAM
Like spoke up, made a sound.
17
PAIGE
Okay, keep goin.
SAM
(turns the page)
And out of the houses the rats came
tumblin, black rats, brown rats, brother
rats, sister rats, and husband rats
followed their little rat wives... Til
they came to the ragin water where they
drowned and lost their lives."
PAIGE
They got rid all them rats?
SAM
Yep.
PAIGE
How come you sold yer Harley?
SAM
Cause it's what I had to do.
Off her look...
SAM (CONT'D)
We're gonna be ok, bug, don't you worry.
Paige curls into him closer, and we're watching him here... in this
moment... holding his daughter... not so sure they're gonna be ok.
CLOSE ON Sam, behind the wheel of the car, parked, staring out the
front windshield. REVERSE to see he's in the parking lot of the bar,
just watching the entrance.
Empty except for a handful of regulars. Sam coming through the door,
taking in the place, the fucking grime and despair. Moving to Donnie
who is sitting in his same spot...
DONNIE
Well, well, well, wondered when I was
gonna see you again, ole buddy. How you
doin?
Sam sits.
SAM
I'm doin.
DONNIE
Heard you was followin the Lord now.
18
SAM
Lil' bit.
Donnie sizes him up, "how much is a little bit?", turns to the
BARTENDER...
DONNIE
Jackie, gimme a mash and bud...
(TO SAM)
You want somethin?
Sam shakes his head.
DONNIE (CONT'D)
You know that old Indian didn't die out
there that night. Story in the Lehigh
Valley News bout it. Somebody picked that
poor bastard up after us, took him to the
emergency room, you believe that shit?
SAM
God was lookin out for us both, I
suppose.
WAITRESS slides a shot and beer in front of Donnie...
DONNIE
Well then, here's to him.
(DRINKS)
Didn't hear you pull up.
SAM
Got Lynn's car.
DONNIE
She broke down on ya?
SAM
Sold her.
DONNIE
Ahhh, shit, man. Shoulda come to yer ole
buddy first.
Donnie smiling, inviting him back into this world. And we're
watching Sam, threshold moment here, considering.
It's late and we see Lynn sitting at the kitchen table alone. Sam
has not come home and she is clearly worried. And then we hear a car
pulling up outside, door opening and closing, and Sam coming into
the trailer.
SAM
Sorry I'm late.
19
Lynn staring at him, trying to read this man's face but he's not
looking at her. Avoiding her gaze. Did he use? Is he high? And then
she sees a PINPRICK OF DRIED BLOOD on his shirtsleeve. Her face
contorting almost imperceptibly. Her worst fear realized. Relapse.
And she moves to him without saying a word... lifts up his arm and
unbuttons the cuff of his shirt... slowly pushing up his shirtsleeve
to discover a NEEDLE PRICK in his arm...
... and then he pulls out a $20 bill and hands it to her.
SAM (CONT'D)
Gave blood over in Pitt.
Lynn searching his eyes and she knows he's telling the truth.
SAM (CONT'D)
That's all I got.
And she pulls him close, hugging him tight, grateful.
LYNN
Somethin will come through. I promise.
And we hold on Sam, his troubled eyes. Completely out of options.
And we see that for this man the inability to provide for his family
is crushing.
Lynn in front of the TV, scared, watching an EMERGENCY WEATHER
WARNING... winds buffeting the trailer... Sam coming into the room
from the back...
LYNN
Two touched down near Harrisberg.
Sam coming back into the trailer fast --
SAM
Come on! Let's go...
Lynn following him --
20
-- down the hallway -- WIND PICKING UP -- starting to rock the
trailer back and forth.
SAM
Get Paige, grab a blanket.
-- Lynn darting into a bedroom, scooping Paige out of her bed.
Sam coming in, moving to a metal gun locker in the corner of the
room, pulling out a SHOTGUN.
THE WIND -- SLAMMING the trailer now -- Lynn and Paige -- terrified -
- watching as Sam moves to the center of the room, points the barrel
of the shotgun toward the floor and --
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
Blows four gaping holes in the floorboards, then starts to kick
through the wood with his boot --
LYNN
(yelling, over the wind)
What are you doing?!
He kicks a hole in the planks, turns to Lynn and Paige --
SAM
GET IN!
Paige crawling through the opening... into a shallow trench
underneath the trailer... Lynn squeezing in behind her... Sam
staying outside... no room for him... the trailer starting to buck
VIOLENTLY in the tempest... thin walls contorting around him...
... and Paige starts to cry -- terrified -- Sam laying down on the
floor next to the opening, close enough so she can hear his voice...
SAM (CONT'D)
Bug, you hear me?! -- Bug?!
PAIGE
Yeah.
And he starts to play a child's word association game with her...
something she knows... something they've played before...
SAM
I'm thinkin of a snail... you hear me,
Bug?! Snail.
21
And we hear her tiny little voice say...
PAIGE
Whale.
SAM
Good job, Bug, good job! You said whale,
I'm thinkin of a pail!
PAIGE
You said pail, I'm thinkin of a tail.
And so this little game goes between father and daughter... Paige
listening to his voice... in the midst of this terrible storm...
somehow becoming less terrified.
The first night in their new home and we see a few unpacked moving
boxes here.
Paige sound asleep on a small bed upstairs.
Lynn in the kitchen organizing the cabinets. And Sam enters carrying
a box, sets it on the counter.
SAM
That's everything.
LYNN
You get what's in the trunk?
SAM
Yep.
Lynn looking up, seeing how dirty Sam is from the move...
LYNN
Lord, you're filthy, Sam Childers.
Lynn tossing him a kitchen towel. Sam, smiling mischievously...
SAM
Who you callin filthy, woman?
LYNN
You.
SAM
You dirtier than I am.
LYNN
No I ain't.
SAM
Yes you are. I seen it. C'mon, girl,
gimme a little shake...
24
Sam winking at her and playfully snapping a kitchen towel at her
butt... Lynn giggling and scooting away...
LYNN
I ain't doin that no more.
SAM
... just a little somethin for yer old
man, c'mon...
And he snaps her butt again but she grabs the towel and snaps him
back...
SAM (CONT'D)
Owww!
LYNN
You gimme a little shake...
She snaps him again and he feels the sting...
SAM
C'mon, Lynn...
She snaps him again but he grabs her and they fall into each other
against the counter... laughing... and he kisses her... playful at
first and then it becomes more passionate... and just as it starts
to lead somewhere we go...
Two years later and we're watching a congregation finish a Sunday
hymn. Sam, Lynn, Daisy, and Paige (10) in the crowd listening to
Pastor Krause.
PASTOR KRAUSE
Today we are blessed with a special
guest. It's my pleasure to welcome Pastor
Relling from the Kilangire Christian
Ministry in Uganda, Africa. Pastor...
Polite applause as a tall, white South African man named PAUL
RELLING steps up to the pulpit, and in a deep Afrikaner accent he
BEGINS --
RELLING
Thank you Pastor Krause, and thank you
brothers and sisters for inviting me into
this house of the Lord.
(BEAT)
I'm here today to talk to you about your
Christian brothers and sisters, families
just like yours, a half a world away that
desperately need your help...
And we see Sam in this sea of faces, listening.
25
Parishioners slowly filing out of the church after service. Lynn,
Paige, and a few other women chatting by the entrance.
And now Lynn looks over her shoulder and sees Sam talking with Paul
Relling off to the side, just the two of them in a corner, deep in
discussion.
The first thing we notice is the relative "opulence" of this
place... deep shag, new color TV, matching sectional sofa... the
rural idea of making it. Sam, Lynn, Daisy and Paige at the dinner
table eating. Sam in his own world, oblivious to the MINOR
CONVERSATION until --
LYNN
Paige, go get some more beans.
Paige heads to the kitchen.
LYNN (CONT'D)
What are you thinking?
SAM
Thinking about Africa.
Paige comes back in carrying the beans.
PAIGE
They have tigers over there?
SAM
(JOKINGLY)
They eat people!
LYNN
What about Africa?
SAM
Just thinkin bout that fella today.
PAIGE
He talked funny.
LYNN
Just from a different place than us,
baby, that's all.
SAM
Was thinkin maybe I'd go over there. Help
em out fer a few weeks.
26
DAISY
Africa?
PAIGE
To see the tigers.
SAM
He was talkin about puttin box beam roofs
on school houses over there.
LYNN
What about finishing that job in Boswell?
SAM
I'll only be gone a few weeks. Be back
before you know it.
Fifteen or twenty volunteers lounging on cots in this dorm, playing
cards, talking, smoking. And we find Sam off from the group, on his
bunk, reading The Bible...
VOICE (O.S.)
Hey Childers...
Sam turns to find a British man in his late 20's named DAN standing
next to him, thick Cockney accent, smoking a cigarette.
DAN
Some of us are going into Kampala
tomorrow night. Find ourselves a little
fun this weekend. You in?
SAM
I was thinkin bout goin up north.
DAN
You crazy? There's a civil war going on
up there.
SAM
I know.
... Sam and Deng crammed into this crowded bus...
SAM
They always drive this fast?
DENG
Traveling is the most dangerous time in
Sudan. If the rebels find you on the open
road it would be very bad.
An awkward silence as Deng stares out the window. Sam wanting to
connect here, but Deng is reticent.
SAM
You got kids, Deng?
DENG
No. I have no children.
SAM
Where you from?
DENG
A little village called Aweil. Many hours
from here.
SAM
That's where your family is?
And Deng simply says...
DENG
My family was killed by LRA.
(BEAT)
Unyama is about two hours from here. We
will stop there for lunch.
30
Deng turns and looks out the window again, silent, quietly watching
the land blur past. And Sam says nothing more, intuitively feeling
this man's need to be alone in the moment. A great, lost giant.
A stale room with two cots, bare, institutional. Deng on the edge of
his cot, pulling off his boots, taking off his jacket, getting
comfortable. And we see Sam sitting on a small balcony overlooking
the empty street below.
DENG
Some say Joseph Kony is a wizard. A
shapeshifter. He calls himself a
Christian...
He pulls a baggy of tobacco from his pocket and begins to roll a
cigarette...
DENG (CONT'D)
... but I say he is Satan, who devours
his own people.
SAM
Kony is the leader of the LRA?
DENG
He is the one we have been fighting for
years. But there is very little we can
do. Our weapons are old, and our boots
are full of holes. We have been forgotten
by the rest of the world.
And now Deng turns to Sam...
33
DENG (CONT'D)
Why are you here?
SAM
S'cuse me?
DENG
What are you looking for in this place?
SAM
Ain't lookin for nuthin.
Deng staring at him, skeptical...
DENG
And then you will get your picture and go
back to your life and all this will just
be a story you tell your friends.
Sam has no response... and Deng lights his cigarette... and suddenly
we hear voices... through the open window... children's voices...
Sam peering into the darkness but seeing nothing... only empty
streets... and then one-by-one... out of the darkness like
apparitions... we see children coming up the street carrying
bedrolls... some of them singing spiritual hymns as they walk...
laughing as children do... at first just a dozen or so... and then
more... fifty... a hundred...
Sam coming down these steps. Deng following.
DENG
(CALLING AFTER)
Sam...
-- and a DOZEN CHILDREN are ushered into this small room. Sam
pushing their cots against a wall so there's more space. Deng
speaking to the children --
DENG
(ARABIC)
Settle down... it's alright... you can
sleep here till morning...
-- and they begin to settle onto the floor... and now we notice a
particular BOY in this group... maybe 8 years old... wearing bright
GREEN SHORTS... and we watch as he and his SISTER move to a corner
of the room and unroll their mats...
... and eventually Sam turns off the lamp and we stay here in the
dark... Sam on his cot, listening to these 12 little children
breathing... their shifting bodies on the floor trying to get
comfortable... and then...
CUT TO:
Sam's closed eyes... sound asleep...
Just before dawn. Deng standing over him, shaking him awake...
DENG
The LRA attacked a village last night.
Sam looking up to him...
DENG (CONT'D)
You said you wanted to see.
Sam sits up, looks around the hotel room and we see that it's
empty... the children vanished... only a small, handmade toy on the
ground which has been left behind.
Sam, Deng, and a few other SPLA SOLDIERS jammed into the flatbed of
this truck, carrying heavy weapons, bouncing fast over this open
dirt road... featureless savanna FADING into sporadic mud huts...
the outskirts of a VILLAGE in the distance... and thin columns of
black smoke twisting into the air...
... and as the truck gets closer to the village we begin to pass
CHILDREN walking along the side of the road... night commuters
returning to their village... some of them huddled together,
weeping...
36
... and we notice -- Sam notices -- the little boy in the GREEN
SHORTS, walking hand-in-hand with his sister, their faces quiet
masks of fear as they move closer to their home.
A bright, fluorescent corridor filled with garish advertising and
harried travelers rushing to make planes... and we find Sam coming
down this concourse, carrying his duffle bag, his face
expressionless. He reaches a revolving door but stops... doesn't
pass through... sees Lynn, Paige, and his mother waiting for him on
the other side... their happy, expectant faces...
But they don't see him yet... and he just stays here... hidden...
watching them through the glass... and as Sam puts it, at this
moment he realized he would never look at his own family the same
way again... in some way lost to them forever after what he saw on
the side of road in Yei...
... and finally he forces a smile, pushes through the revolving door
and we watch, from this side of the glass, as Paige leaps into his
arms... Lynn and Daisy moving to him too, embracing him, welcoming
him home.
Paige brushing her teeth at the sink. Sam watching her from the
doorway...
PAIGE
You see any tigers over there?
SAM
Naw, didn't see no tigers.
PAIGE
But they do have them over in Africa.
SAM
So I hear, but not where I was.
PAIGE
Sure am glad you're home.
SAM
Me too, bug.
PAIGE
I'm thinkin of a plane...
SAM
It's late, you better get to bed...
And he grabs her and carries her into the bedroom, plops her onto
the bed...
38
PAIGE
C'mon, plane... I'm thinkin of a plane...
Sam giving in, playing their little game as she gets under the
covers...
SAM
You said plane, I'm thinkin of a train...
PAIGE
You said train, I'm thinkin of a brain.
SAM
You said brain, I'm thinkin of a...
(HESITATING)
PAIGE
Gotcha!
SAM
Ok, you got me.
PAIGE
You coulda said drain, or mane... like
horse's hair.
Sam bending over, kissing her forehead...
SAM
Sweet dreams, bug.
Sam coming out of Paige's bedroom, pulling the door closed, finding
Lynn waiting for him.
LYNN
You comin to bed?
SAM
In a bit
LYNN
You ok?
SAM
Just a long flight.
She senses more but knows this man well enough not to push... and so
she simply turns away.
Lynn stirs awake, looks next to her and realizes Sam never made it
to bed the night before.
... Lynn slowly pushing open the door to find Sam on the floor,
hunched over a pad of Paige's art paper... drawing... paper wads
strewn all around him... been here all night...
LYNN
Baby, whatcha doin?
He looks up...
SAM
Makin plans.
LYNN
You been to bed yet?
He gathers up a couple of the papers, moves to her.
SAM
I had a vision last night, Lynn. Crazy as
it sounds, God spoke to me...
He hands her a sheet of paper -- CU to see it's a crude drawing of
building.
SAM (CONT'D)
I'm gonna build a church.
LYNN
A church?
40
SAM
Right across the street. Not like Faith
United or Calvary Fellowship. Place that
ain't gonna turn you away if you a drug
addict or a prostitute or whatever. Place
for sinners, just like me, who wanna hear
the word of God.
Lynn studying him, trying to judge how serious he is here. And Sam
looking back at her, his eyes like we haven't seen them before.
Sparkling.
LYNN
How we gonna pay for a church, Sam?
SAM
We got money in the bank. Business is
good. Besides, I own a construction
company...
(SMILING)
I'm gonna give us one heck of a good deal
on the build.
She smiles, shaking her head, catching his enthusiasm...
LYNN
Yer crazy.
SAM
`Lil bit.
LYNN
What's that?
He hands her the other paper -- CU to see it's a another drawing.
SAM
That's the orphanage I wanna build. In
Sudan.
CUT TO:
Dark, junkie squalor. Two or three people slumped on a ratty couch,
strung-out, watching a flickering TV -- and then --
THE FRONT DOOR CAVES IN!
Sam coming into the house -- sawed-off leveled -- junkies scrambling
for cover -- YELLING! -- CHAOS! -- Sam moving into --
Sam comes around the corner and finds himself face-to-face with a
CRACKHEAD pointing a .357 MAGNUM -- eyes amped up and wild --
shaking -- a stand-off -- and Sam sees a body on a bare mattress in
the b.g. -- bone thin and pale -- spent hypodermic hanging out of
his arm --
It's Donnie.
SAM
I'm here for that boy right there. You
gonna get in the way a that?
A TENSE BEAT -- not sure how this is gonna go -- and then the
CRACKHEAD shakes his head "no"
Donnie in a bed, covers pulled up to his neck and he's shaking bad,
retching in a bucket, deep in the throes of a detox. Sam and Lynn
here doing what they can, toweling off his forehead, trying to keep
him warm, as Donnie pulls the sheets tighter, gritting his teeth,
shaking his head.
DONNIE
I can't do this.
SAM
Look at me. God don't make trash, boy.
Now he ain't givin up on you, so don't
give up on him, you hear me?
And somehow Donnie finds strength in his words, and in Sam's hand
touching his head, and he nods.
43
And we see Donnie, dressed in his biker jacket and a buttondown
shirt, sober for the moment, greeting people as they come through
the front door. Standing next to him is Daisy handing out programs.
DONNIE
Welcome to Shekinah Fellowship Church.
Still under construction. Exposed beams and bare insulation on the
walls. There's a small riser at the front of the hall with an altar,
organ, and the GARAGE BAND playing the rocked-out hymn.
A handful of people here sitting in pews. FARMERS in clean overalls,
FACTORY WORKERS, BIKERS still dressed in their riding leathers,
listening to the garage band and chatting.
And now we see Lynn and Paige (11) standing near the back. Lynn
nervous, checking her watch.
Sam on his knees, sleeves rolled up to his elbows, wrenching a
leaking pipe. Lynn and Daisy walk in...
LYNN
It's five-til and he still ain't here.
Sam hearing this, moving to his feet, toweling off his hands.
SAM
You call him?
(LYNN NODS)
Try him again.
Lynn exits and Daisy steps forward, shuts the door behind her. Just
she and Sam here alone now.
DAISY
You like this dress, Sam?
SAM
What, mom?
44
DAISY
You ain't never seen this one. I bought
it a long time ago. Been keepin it for a
special occasion.
SAM
It's nice.
DAISY
I never told you this but when I was
pregnant with you, now this was way back,
probably 1960, when yer daddy and I was
still in Grand Rapids, a Pastor
prophesied over me. Pulled me right up on
stage and laid his hands on my belly and
told me I was gonna have a Preacher for a
son.
(smiling at the thought)
Yer daddy and I were so proud. I remember
we went home and neither of us could
sleep all night. Just laid there and
talked bout you, bout what was comin.
SAM
I just built a church. I ain't no
preacher.
DAISY
Yes you are. You were born to it. Just
took you a little ways to get here.
Sam entering at the back of the chapel, taking a moment to
appreciate what he's looking at: 20 or 30 people here in the church
that he built. A dream realized. And he walks down the center aisle,
shaking hands with a few people, climbing steps to the altar and
switching on the microphone...
SAM
(to the band)
Thank you, Tommy. You boys is soundin
pretty good up here.
Sam turning to the crowd, clearing his throat, clearly nervous.
SAM (CONT'D)
I wanna thank ya'll for comin out for the
first day of worship here at Shekinah
Fellowship Church.
Some applause. Lynn and Paige sitting with Daisy who is beaming.
45
SAM (CONT'D)
The guest preacher we had booked today
ain't shown up... so I thought I'd say a
word or two.
An awkward beat...
SAM (CONT'D)
Lotta yous been wonderin what made me
wanna build this here church. Seein as I
ain't the best seed in the bunch I can
understand that.
A beat, considering what to say... and he begins...
SAM (CONT'D)
Buncha years ago I was runnin from some
bad fellas in the woods over there by
Cleary. Those old boys was comin after me
hard and I reached in my bag lookin for
my old shotgun but it was gone. My momma
had took it out when I wasn't lookin and
put this bible in there instead...
Sam holding up a worn bible, and we start to notice something
here... a transformation happening in this man as he speaks to these
people. His nervousness falling away and a natural charisma taking
over...
SAM (CONT'D)
Well I figured I was done for, so I sat
down under an old tree with this useless
book and I waited...
And we see the congregation hanging on his every word, identifying
with this man standing before them. One of their own.
SAM (CONT'D)
... and then the strangest thing
happened. Them boys ran right on past me.
Didn't even see me sittin there. Now the
way I figure it, things would have turned
out pretty different if I had pulled out
that shotgun instead of this here Bible.
And that's probably the first time I can
remember God savin my butt.
(BEAT)
God... and my momma.
Some laughter and applause...
SAM (CONT'D)
Figure least I could do was build em both
this church.
And the congregation responds with a Hallelujah!
46
Sam holding Paige, her face buried in his shoulder, crying.
SAM
Be back soon as I can.
PAIGE
You're gonna miss my play.
SAM
Have momma videotape it for me, k? Now I
gotta git.
Lynn pulling Paige off, kissing Sam on the lips.
LYNN
Call us when you can.
SAM
I will.
Sam turning to Donnie, and we see he's back to the hulking man he
once was.
SAM (CONT'D)
You watch out for em while I'm gone, ya
hear?
DONNIE
That's done, buddy.
Sam winks, slaps Donnie on the shoulder, as we --
CUT TO:
Deng driving fast down this bumpy road. Sam in the passenger seat.
Nineteen, Marco, and A.J. in the flatbed of this truck, ever
watchful.
47
SAM
Right here, stop the truck!
A tight, cramped office filled with villagers. Two or three men
here at desks handling the administration of life in the bush:
renewing travel papers, registering newborn children, hearing
complaints from local farmers, etc. And we see Sam and Deng at one
of these desks, a topographical map splayed out in front of them.
ADMINISTRATOR
This is not a good idea.
SAM
I think it's a heckuva good idea.
ADMINISTRATOR
It would be better further south. Closer
to Kampala.
SAM
If I wanted to be closer to Kampala, I'd
be closer to Kampala. I wanna be right
here...
Sam pointing to the map. The Administrator turning to Deng --
48
ADMINISTRATOR
(ARABIC)
He should not be this far north.
SAM
What are you sayin?
ADMINISTRATOR
The villages in this area are very
remote, Mr. Childers. There is nothing
there.
SAM
Then it seems to me them people need help
the most.
ADMINISTRATOR
(to Deng, Arabic)
He will be killed.
SAM
Talk to me.
The Administrator turning to him, laying it out simply --
ADMINISTRATOR
This is in the war zone, Mr. Childers.
The LRA will kill you here.
SAM
I don't think you understand me, so lemme
make it real clear to ya. I didn't pick
this land -- God did.
We see Betty and another Camp Woman (ROSE) moving through this room
carrying lanterns, helping the children get ready for sleep --
BETTY
(ARABIC)
You two share a blanket and tomorrow we
will find another.
ROSE
(ARABIC)
Shhhh, it's time to shut your eyes...
And we see Sam here too, doing what he can, tucking in a few of the
kids, starting to make a connection with these children.
The children sprawled on their mats sound asleep.
Deng and a few other soldiers sleeping on bedrolls.
Sam sitting on his cot. He rips open an airmail package and pulls
out a small VIDEOCASSETTE, slides it in a VIDEOCAMERA, hits play --
ON THE SMALL VIDEO SCREEN we see Paige, dressed in a pilgrim
costume, performing in a Thanksgiving Day play. Her voice coming
through the tiny speakers as she recites her lines. Sam smiling at
what he's watching.
Sam watching Paige's play -- when suddenly --
AN EXPLOSION! -- machinegun fire popping o.s. -- Sam hitting the
ground, scrambling for cover --
TERRIFIED SCREAMING! -- the children cowering in the corners --
Betty and Rose here trying to calm them down --
BETTY
(ARABIC)
Stay down! -- stay down! --
ROSE
We are protected! --
Sam bursting through the door --
SAM
-- Betty! Get em to the church right now!
(ARABIC)
Quickly.
(ENGLISH)
Understand?! --
Betty nodding as Sam rushes out --
-- Sam bombing into this shed -- quickly opening a metal chest and
pulling out an AK47 and mags of ammo --
Betty and the other Camp woman herding the terrified children into
this building -- the only brick structure on the compound -- and
then Deng, Marco, A.J. and the other SPLA soldiers coming in --
moving to the window holes and returning fire --
54
-- Sam storming into the chapel -- turning to Betty --
SAM
(meaning the children)
Put em in the middle!
Betty and the other woman do exactly that -- they move the children
into a tight group in the center of the room.
BETTY
(ARABIC)
Down here! -- in the center! -- all of
you! -- stay down!
Sam, Deng and the other soldiers returning fire --
DENG
(ARABIC)
Four on the right!
NINETEEN
(ARABIC)
There are too many!
SAM
Just keep firin!
Sam starting to open up with his AK -- Krakakakakakak! -- spent
shells showering down around the children huddled in the middle of
the room.
55
-- Sam sweeping his AK across the compound -- the other soldiers
burning through magazines and reloading -- rebels firing back --
Betty and the children crowded on the floor in the middle of this
STORM OF GUNFIRE -- and we stay in this little chapel -- watching
this last stand -- until we --
CUT TO:
And we see Lynn pushing a shopping cart down the aisle, past shelves
loaded with packaged produce. And we hear BUZZING. Lynn digging the
cell phone out of her purse --
LYNN
Hello?
Lynn immediately senses something wrong.
56
LYNN
You ok?
She hears the anguish in his voice.
LYNN
Where are you?
SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)
... I'm comin home.
And we're watching her here, clocking the resignation in his voice.
A moment of quiet for both of them. Lynn sensing the dimensions of
his heartache. All she wants to do is bring him home, hold him
close, ease his pain... but she knows that's not what he needs...
not this man...
And we see her move around a corner into an empty aisle, away from
the other shoppers. And she says...
57
LYNN
Then quit feelin sorry for yerself. Them
children have had their whole lives
burned to the ground and worse. How many
of them you see givin up?
A simple administrative office with a short-wave radio and sat
phone. Sam here, sitting at a desk when we hear a knock at the door.
58
SAM
Come on in...
The door opens and we see Deng.
DENG
Preacher, you need to come see this.
Days later and we see Sam here with Nineteen and a few other SPLA
soldiers, eating lunch, trying to learn their language. And it's
humorous to these guys as Sam tries to pronounce some words in
Arabic...
And suddenly we hear YELLING coming from outside.
-- DOORS BANGING OPEN! -- CONTROLLED CHAOS as the children are
hauled into this clinic -- Betty taking care of Alice -- the worst
off -- hooking her up to an IV as Sam moves to her bedside -- the
little girl still mumbling quietly --
SAM
What is she saying?
BETTY
She is asking what she did wrong?
Sam taking Alice's hand in his... very slowly her beautiful eyes
open and she sees him... and says something in Arabic...
BETTY (CONT'D)
(TRANSLATING)
She is asking if you are `The Preacher.'
60
SAM
(NODDING)
Tell her she's gonna be ok.
Betty translates and Alice smiles faintly... and now one of the
other camp women comes over and Sam steps back so they can work...
Bombing down this rutted, red dirt road. The engine at full tilt.
Sam, Deng, Nineteen, Marco, and A.J. jammed into this truck riding
in dead silence... AK47's bouncing between their knees... only the
sound of the WAR SONG playing as we watch these men... a grave
stillness on their faces... thinking of what men do just before
their own death.
Four CHILD SOLDIERS squatting in the flatbed of this truck carrying
AK47's. We recognize one of the boys as the younger brother from the
opening scene -- WILLIAM.
With two ADULT REBELS in this Jeep as they drive down this road past
bombed-out vehicles... and in the distance we see the smoldering
wreckage of a transport truck on the side of the road... the thick
smoke hanging over the road like a black curtain... blocking out
vision of the road ahead...
... and the Jeep punches into the black smoke followed by the pickup
truck... and we're lost in the swirling haze for a moment before
coming out the other side... and this is what we see --
SAM -- standing in the middle of the road ahead of us shouldering a
RPG -- the ADULT REBELS see him just as --
WHOOOOSH! -- an RPG streaks right at us and DETONATES -- KABOOOOM! --
and the Jeep flips onto it's side --
THE PICKUP GRINDS TO A STOP! -- the driver slamming it into REVERSE -
- accelerating back into the curtain of smoke -- trying to get the
fuck out of there when --
BBrrraaaappp!
.30 CALIBER MACHINEGUN STRAFE across the front hood --
80 children laying on the floor on reed mats, getting ready for
sleep. And we find William in mid-conversation with a young boy
named Anthony.
WILLIAM
... Where are you from?
ANTHONY
Jabal.
WILLIAM
Were you with the rebels?
Anthony nods. William pulls out his photograph.
WILLIAM (CONT'D)
Did you know my brother? He was called
Christopher.
Anthony studying the photograph...
WILLIAM (CONT'D)
He has a funny left eye. It looks the
other way sometimes. Do you remember him?
ANTHONY
No.
William folding up the photograph, getting up, moving to another
little boy a few feet away... kneeling next to him... and so he
continues...
WILLIAM
I am William. Were you with the rebels?
65
And we see Sam on his cot when the light goes out. He leans over and
torches a small Kerosene lamp next to him.
The children on their mats in the dark now... quiet... a few of the
younger ones whimpering, starting to cry... the darkness becoming
too much... reminding them of past horrors... and then we hear a
FAINT VOICE in this dark room... singing quietly... an ancient
African lullaby... and then other little voices joining in...
singing this song they all know... a song their mother's once sang
to them...
... Sam hearing the soft chorus drift across the compound... somehow
finding comfort in it too... blowing out the lamp and laying here in
the dark... listening to the children sing.
Sam turning around in his seat as we pull away from the compound...
and he sees William still struggling in Deng's arms... and finally
he breaks free and SPRINTS for the truck as it drives off... fast as
he can... chasing Sam until he no longer can.
CUT TO:
And we see two teens moving toward the sound of a crowd coming from
inside the church, responsive, "Hallelujah!"... and then Sam's voice
over it all...
SAM (O.S.)
In your actions you give service to the
Lord...
67
Sam at the pulpit in mid-sermon. There is an air of Fire and
Brimstone to what we're watching here... electric... the
congregation listening in rapt attention...
SAM
... he's not interested in your good
thoughts... your good intentions... he
wants your hands... your backs... your
sweat... your blood to pour into the
foundation that will build up his
kingdom!
Ad-libbed SHOUTS and PRAISE... and now we see Lynn, Daisy, Donnie
and Paige in the congregation listening... as we go --
Lynn and Sam walking through the facility, and we see this place is
alive with activity. More than just a church, this is a community
center. Lynn opening a door and we see a Volunteer here with a dozen
little children running around this playroom...
LYNN
We started daycare last month. Monday
thru Friday from 8 to 2... Sundays after
first worship for a few hours if anybody
needs it. How you doin, Sue?
VOLUNTEER
Good. Hey Pastor.
SAM
Sue.
Lynn pulling the door closed and they continue... moving down a set
of stairs to the basement where we see children and parents... some
of them playing ping-pong and air hockey... others in a corner
rehearsing for a Christmas play...
SAM (CONT'D)
Been thinkin we need to put up a
playground. Swings. Some things the kids
can climb on.
LYNN
We can't build anymore. Not for awhile.
SAM
You said Sundays has been full.
LYNN
Turn outs been good, but that don't mean
people is givin money.
(MORE)
68
LYNN (CONT'D)
Economy is in trouble, construction
business is slow. Times is tight.
SAM
Be good for them kids, Lynn.
LYNN
They got the playground over in
Cairnbrook. And they can play at the
school on weekends if they want
Sam turning to her --
SAM
Not talking bout here. Talkin about the
orphange.
Lynn catching up to him now, realizing his head is still back in
Africa.
Sam working on his Harley. Donnie entering in the b.g.
DONNIE
What'cha workin on, buddy?
SAM
Trouble with the push rods I think. She's
runnin kinda rough.
DONNIE
Shoulda kept that mild in there `stead a
buildin up a hot rod. Let's see whatcha
got here...
Donnie moving next to him, working on the bike...
DONNIE (CONT'D)
... never had these problems when we was
runnin solid lifters, huh?
SAM
Used to fix them old shovelheads on the
side of the road with a buckknife and a
wire hanger.
DONNIE
Remember that year we went to the
Freakers Ball?
Sam smiling...
SAM
I think that old `78 broke down five
times on that trip.
69
DONNIE
Sounds about right. Shoot, we had more
fun tryin to get there than when we
finally did.
Sam and Donnie share a laugh.
DONNIE (CONT'D)
Can I talk to you about somethin?
SAM
Yep.
DONNIE
I'm glad I'm walkin with the Lord and
all, but sometimes I ain't sure I'm gonna
be able to do what he wants me to do.
SAM
The Lord don't ask for nuthin you can't
deliver, buddy. And yer one tough ole
boy.
DONNIE
Sometimes I ain't so sure how tough I am.
And we see in Donnie's eyes just how troubled he is.
SAM
Why don't we pray together then...
And they both take a knee, bowing their heads as Sam continues...
SAM (CONT'D)
Our gracious Heavenly Father, bless us
with the strength to carry on in your
name. And grant us, in our darkest hours,
the understandin that you are always by
our side.
And we leave these two men, their heads bowed in quiet supplication,
next to this Harley, praying for strength.
Four or five gleaming sedans on this showroom floor. And we see Sam
sitting across from BILL WALLACE, late 40's, gold Rolex.
BILL
... from what I heard, you built yourself
one helluva church over there in Central
City.
70
SAM
Still got a ways to go, but we're gettin
there. You should come on by one of these
Sundays, bring the family.
BILL
That's nice of you, but we're at Calvary
now. Bit more our speed over there I
think.
Sam, getting down to business...
SAM
Reverand Carlton gives a mean sermon,
puts me to shame. Anyway Bill, I'm here
cause I wanna talk to you about what
we're doin over there in Africa.
BILL
Course I know about what you're doin.
Helluva thing helpin out those kids, Sam.
SAM
Thank you, but I'm gonna be straight with
ya. We're hurtin for money... If we had a
little bit more support from people like
yourself sure would help things run a lot
smoother over there.
Bill feeling the rub, shaking his head...
BILL
Sam, look, everybody is feelin the pinch
around here.
SAM
I hear that, but you gotta understand
that them kids over there got nuthin. I
mean nuthin, Bill, and I'm not asking for
much.
BILL
How much you lookin for?
SAM
Five thousand dollars.
BILL
Jesus Christ, Sam! Five thousand dollars?
SAM
That keeps them doors open for another
six months.
71
BILL
People are losin their jobs left and
right round here. Tough to be askin for
five thousand dollars for a buncha
African children half-way around the
world.
Sam shifting, not giving up, coming at him another way...
SAM
You're right. We got problems right here.
But with that kinda money we could feed
them kids, house them kids.
Bill staring at him, saying nothing, on the spot. Sam hoping that
somehow he's reached this man. And finally Bill stands up...
BILL
Alright, tell you what, lemme see what I
can do.
Sam feeling this victory, flashing a smile, shaking Bill's hand.
SAM
Ok.
BILL
Why don't you and the family come over to
the house next Sunday. We're havin a
little barbeque, ok?
SAM
Sounds good.
Upscale French provincial in suburban Johnstown. A "barbeque" is
underway. 15 couples here with their kids and a handful of waiters
in white-tie offering champagne and hors d'oeuvres to the guests.
DOOR BELL RINGING -- and we see a perky woman in her late 40's
coming through the crowd, blonde hair from a bottle, accessorized to
the hilt, holding a glass of white wine. SHANNON WALLACE. She opens
the door to find Sam, Lynn, and Paige standing in the doorway.
SHANNON
Well, come on in...
And they enter... Lynn smiling awkwardly, dressed in the same yellow
dress we saw her in previously... her only dress... and Sam looking
around this enormous room...
SHANNON (CONT'D)
Ya'll must be the Childers. Welcome. I'm
Shannon, Bill's ball-n-chain.
72
Smiling, a joke she loves...
LYNN
I'm Lynn, this here is Sam, our daughter
Paige.
SHANNON
Good to meet you.
VOICE (O.S.)
There he is!
Everybody turning to see the car dealer coming through the crowd,
smiling, a little drunk. AD-LIBBED introductions and then...
BILL
Glad ya'll could make it. Get on in here
and meet some people...
Bill ushering them deeper into the house... quick intros to a few
guests as they pass... Sam, Lynn, and Paige taking it all in...
starting to sense the dimensions of this massive house... the
waiters in their pressed jackets offering them food... the
extravagance... like nothing they've ever seen...
... Bill pulling Sam off from the crowd so it's just the two of
them... taking an envelope from his jacket and handing it to him...
BILL (CONT'D)
This is a little somethin for the kids,
ok? What we were talking about.
SAM
Thank you, Bill.
BILL
Forget it. Now c'mon, can I get ya a
mojito or somethin?
Sam coming into this bathroom and locking the door... taking the
envelope out of his pocket and tearing it open... pulling out a
personal check -- CLOSE UP to see it's in the amount of $150
HOLD ON Sam face, and it's disgust we see in his eyes.
-- Sam coming into the house, enraged, followed by Lynn. He moves to
his gun cabinet, grabs a hidden key, unlocks it...
LYNN
What are you doin?
SAM
I've had it with these people and all
their bullshit about wantin to help...
And he starts pulling out weapons... shotguns and assault rifles...
stuffing them into an oversize gun bag...
LYNN
Sam Childers...
74
Lynn reaching for him and he grabs her wrist... tightly... staring
at her with dark eyes. A flash of the "old" Sam Childers here when
he says...
SAM
Stay outta my way.
And for the first time in years this woman is scared. He lets go of
her wrist and continues to fill the bag -- and we go --
Donnie tucking Paige into bed, making it up as he goes, clearly out
of his depth here but wanting to do it right.
DONNIE
You say prayers or somethin?
PAIGE
Already did.
DONNIE
Ok then, sweet dreams.
PAIGE
Ain't you gonna read me a book?
DONNIE
Ahh, Paige, you know I don't read so
good.
PAIGE
Then let's play a game.
DONNIE
Ok.
PAIGE
I'm thinkin of a dog.
DONNIE
What about it?
PAIGE
Never mind, Donnie.
DONNIE
Ok.
78
PAIGE
Dad usually kisses me on the forehead
before he leaves. You can do that.
DONNIE
Sure I can.
And Donnie does just that, bends down and kisses Paige on the
head...
DONNIE (CONT'D)
Sweet dreams.
And now we see Lynn in the hallway having just witnessed this
through the cracked door, keenly feeling Sam absence in this moment.
Sam behind the wheel, driving alone the edge of a dry ravine. Deng
is in the passenger seat and we see Nineteen, Marco and A.J. crammed
into the back.
SAM
I don't see nuthin.
Deng checking a handheld GPS unit --
DENG
This is it.
81
Sam looking out the window, sees movement at the bottom of the
ravine.
SAM
Hold on...
... and we see what he sees -- CHILDREN hiding behind a bush.
SAM (CONT'D)
I got em.
It's late at night and we see Sam on his cot, sitting here in the
dark. And we hear the sound of his satellite phone vibrating on the
table next to him. He picks it up, sees DONNIE'S name on the
screen...
SAM
(INTO PHONE)
Hello?
And we see Donnie on a couch by himself in this shitty little room.
DONNIE
Sam, it's me.
INTERCUT THE CONVERSATION:
SAM
Everybody ok?
DONNIE
Oh yeah, everybody's just fine. I was
just callin to say `hey' is all.
SAM
How're the girls?
85
DONNIE
They're good. Paige cooked us all dinner
the other night. Chocolate-chip pancakes.
SAM
By herself, huh?
DONNIE
Yep. I helped her with the stove is all.
She did everything else. Pretty good too.
And now we see Donnie's DOPE WORKS sitting on the table in front of
him. He's using again.
DONNIE (CONT'D)
How's it goin over there?
SAM
Goin fine.
DONNIE
Hey, maybe I'll come with you one of
these trips. I'd like to get outta here
for a spell. See what it's like.
SAM
Sounds good.
And it's silent between them... both of these men lost in their own
worries for a moment... and then...
DONNIE
Ask you a question?
SAM'S VOICE
Yeah.
DONNIE'S VOICE
You think God will forgive us for the
things we've done?
And we're watching Sam, this question hitting him like a freight
train. Unable to answer.
Deng behind the wheel driving -- Sam in the passenger seat -- Marco,
Nineteen, and a third SPLA SOLDIER jammed in the back --
DENG
Look...
Far ahead we see three sets of HEADLIGHTS coming towards us on the
road -- just bouncing white dots on the horizon -- and silently
they begin to check their mags and weapons -- preparing for battle --
-- and the headlights get closer -- Deng not slowing down -- and we
realize we are on a collision course with this convoy -- and finally
we see MUZZLE FLASHES in the distance -- and --
THUNK!, THUNK!, THUNK!
Machine gun strafe hitting the front and side of the truck --
SAM
Let's go!
Sam and Nineteen leaning through the open windows as Deng drives --
leveling their AK's and firing --
KRAKAKAKAKAK! KRAKAKAKAKAK!
And now the approaching convoy LIGHTS UP with RETURN FIRE! -- Sam
and Nineteen hanging out the windows blasting back -- Deng stepping
on the gas, accelerating toward the convoy like some hellish game of
"chicken"(reminiscent of Sam and Donnie's wild ride with the Drifter
in scene #29) --
-- and we watch as the headlights barrel towards us at full bore --
BULLETS POPPING across the windshield of the truck -- SAM AND
NINETEEN IN CONSTANT FIRE MODE -- THE SOUND DEAFENING -- headlights
blown out on both trucks and now we're plunged into total blackness -
- only the wild-strobe of machine gun fire lighting up the night as
these trucks slam towards each other -- and finally --
THE LRA CONVOY CAREENS OFF THE ROAD AND BOTTOMS OUT IN A DITCH
Deng skidding to a stop as Sam, Nineteen, and the third SPLA SOLDIER
pile out of the truck -- firing and advancing on the caravan by
foot.
Two hours into this return trip and it's silent in this cab. Deng
checking a handheld GPS, clocking their position, and then they see
it -- through the windshield -- in the distance --
SMOKE
Rising in a thin column a half-mile away.
And we see a line of American TRAVELERS waiting to be checked
through customs... BUSINESS MEN in their rumpled suits carrying
briefcases, PARENTS with their tired children returning from
vacation... and Sam standing in this line with his duffel bag,
somehow cut-off from the life all around him. And the CUSTOMS
OFFICER waves him forward... Sam handing him his passport...
CUSTOMS OFFICER
Sudan?
And he looks up, studies Sam --
CUSTOMS OFFICER (CONT'D)
What are you doing over there?
And we see Sam has no answer for him. This question beginning to
plague him like a festering sore.
A BANK MANAGER at a desk, in a gray suit, shaking his head.
93
BANK MANAGER
I understand what you're saying, but
there's just not a lot we can do, until
we pay down some of what you owe my hands
are tied.
REVERSE to see Sam sitting in a chair across from him, a manila
folder filled with his business papers sitting on his lap.
SAM
It's just an application for a short term
loan.
BANK MANAGER
Sam, we already took out a second on your
home.
SAM
It's only 90 days.
BANK MANAGER
You're completely leveraged.
SAM
I only got one truck over there, John. I
need the money to buy a second vehicle.
Sam opens a manilla folder and pulls out a photo of a truck for
sale.
SAM
It's important. Now, there's one in
Kampala I can probably get for twenty-
one...
BANK MANAGER
(cutting him off)
Sam, we know what you're doing over there
in Africa and we support it but ...
Sam leans over the desk and sets another photograph down in front of
him -- and we see it's a gruesome photograph of a mutilated boy...
SAM
I want you to look at this. See that?
Twelve year old boy had both his arms cut
off by LRA...
An employee approaches the bank manager with something to sign,
looks down at the photos. The Bank Manager becoming uncomfortable.
BANK MANAGER
Sam... It's not necessary.
94
Sam pulls out another photograph and sets it in front of the Bank
Manager -- this one even more gruesome...
SAM
Look at this John, when we found this
little girl her breasts had been hacked
off...
Bank Manager not looking at the photograph...
BANK MANAGER
Sam, this isn't necessary...
SAM
Look at her. Look at this girl.
Bank Manager glancing at the photograph then looking away...
SAM (CONT'D)
Now I ain't in here askin fer money fer a
hot tub or vacation or somethin like
that. I'm askin for an extra vehicle so I
can save some children. You understand
that?
BANK MANAGER
I do, but...
SAM
But nuthin. I need you to open yer little
book there and do whatever you need to do
to get me that loan...
BANK MANAGER
Sam, You need to calm down...
SAM
Don't tell me to calm down! Look at those
pictures! -- Look at em, John --
And he slams the desk with his open hand, taking us to...
A/C on the fritz and it's blistering hot in here. 150 parishioners
in pews waving themselves with hand fans trying to stay cool. And we
see Sam at the pulpit in mid-sermon, shirt pitted and rolled up to
his elbows. The rage in this man is palpable.
SAM
... Open yer eyes!... Wake up!...
(BEAT)
You call yerselves children of God, but
you ain't. Ya'll just sheep followin him
deaf, dumb, and blind...
(AMPED-UP)
(MORE)
95
SAM (CONT'D)
But God don't want sheep. He wants wolves
to fight his fight. Men and women with
teeth to tear at the evil that's out
there...
The congregation whipped into a frenzy. A few of them jumping to
their feet, shouting praise...
SAM (CONT'D)
THE LORD'S PROPHETS AIN'T MEEK MEN. THEY
AIN'T MEN IN FANCY CLOTHES, THEY'RE
WARRIOR PROPHETS...
And we see John Garang in the back of this car as it drives through
downtown Kampala.
SAM (V.O.)
... MEN OF CONVICTION!...
Sam becoming more possessed...
SAM
... WHO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A
STICK AND A SWORD AND AIN'T AFRAID TO
PICK UP EITHER IF THEY NEED TO!...
The congregation responding, "Amen!"
Sam, a building fury...
SAM
... DRAWING UP BATTLE LINES AGAINST HIS
ENEMY WHEREVER THEY MAY BE...
SAM
... UNTIL THE LEGIONS AGAINST THEM FALL
AND ONCE AGAIN THERE IS ONLY HIS LIGHT...
Paige and her girlfriend from her 7th grade class sit on the
landing. Donnie flips through a magazine, Lynn puts away laundry.
Chatter here about an upcoming formal...
PAIGE
Mary Strauss and them is havin dinner at
The Chimney.
LYNN
Who's her date?
PAIGE'S FRIEND
Tony Wilks.
LYNN
I thought Tony Wilkes was goin with Patty
Hobbes' daughter.
PAIGE
They broke up last month.
And now we see Sam off from the group, absently watching the TV in
an adjoining room... and a NEWS REPORT begins... a PICTURE OF JOHN
GARANG flashing on the screen... Sam moving closer to the set so he
can hear --
TV NEWSCASTER
... Sudanese opposition leader John
Garang has been killed in a helicopter
crash according to a statement released
by the Sudanese Government in Khartoum
today.
Sam going completely still...
97
TV NEWSCASTER (CONT'D)
Garang was hailed as a peacemaker in
Sudan and was instrumental in ending the
21-year civil war that has ravaged that
country.
ARCHIVAL SHOTS OF GARANG.
TV NEWSCASTER (CONT'D)
Six of Garang's associates and seven
others also died in the crash which is
being blamed on bad weather.
Sam frozen, shocked... just staring at the TV as the newscast
switches to another story...
PAIGE (O.S.)
Dad? -- Dad?
Sam looking up to find everybody staring at him.
PAIGE (CONT'D)
What do you think about us gettin a limo
for next weekend? Wouldn't be too
expensive since there'd be six of us.
Sam lost here for a moment...
PAIGE (CONT'D)
Hel-lo? Earth to Dad? What do you think?
LYNN
Honey, you ok?
DONNIE
Heck, why don't I just drive ya'll?
PAIGE
We ain't crammin in the back of your
Caprice.
DONNIE
Ya'll could fit in there easy.
PAIGE
We got dresses, Donnie! We'll get all
wrinkled! Plus it smells in there.
DONNIE
I can get some freshener, Paige, that
ain't no problem.
PAIGE
Dad, what you think? Can we get a limo?
98
SAM
No.
PAIGE
Dad. Please. Patty and them is gettin
one.
SAM
You ain't rentin no limo to Pittsburgh.
LYNN
We could probably get us a deal through
one of Tom Hickey's boys. Between the six
of them it wouldn't cost too much.
SAM
Nobody's spendin money on no friggin
limousine.
PAIGE
But dad...
Sam snapping, FLASHING WITH RAGE --
SAM
WHAT THE HELL DID I JUST SAY?!
Quiet. Nobody moving. Completely still. And then...
LYNN
We're just talkin bout it, honey...
SAM
Too much talk in this house. I got mouths
to feed and you're talkin bout pissing
money away on a limo.
PAIGE
It's my formal, dad.
SAM
I don't give a shit what it is! You ain't
gettin no limo, end of story.
Tears welling up in Paige's eyes, anger, hurt, wanting to lash out
at him somehow. And what she says next she's felt her whole life...
PAIGE
You love them black babies more than you
love me.
SAM
WATCH YER MOUTH LITTLE GIRL, BEFORE I
SLAP IT!
99
LYNN
Sam...
Donnie instinctively grabbing his arm, protective...
DONNIE
Hey...
And Sam spins -- gets in his face -- eyes dark and threatening --
SAM
What the hell you think you're doin, boy?
LYNN
Honey...
SAM
SHUT THE FUCK UP!
DONNIE
Take it easy, buddy.
SAM
Don't tell me to take it easy in my own
fuckin house...
Sam and Donnie toe-to-toe and the threat of serious violence here.
Tension like a hair trigger.
SAM (CONT'D)
That ain't your wife and this ain't your
family. You nuthin but a stray fuckin dog
round here, boy.
DONNIE
You don't mean that...
SAM
Hell I don't. Now you get the fuck outta
here fore I put yer head through that
wall.
Donnie standing here, hurt... looking to Lynn to make sure she's
alright and she nods for him to go... and he turns and walks out.
Paige bursting into tears and running out of the room.
A crowded, noisy outlaw bar in Johnstown. We see Sam sitting at the
bar all alone, a shot of whisky and a bottle of beer in front of
him. Staring into a void.
VOICE (O.S.)
You that Preacher, ain't ya?
100
Sam turns to find a burly looking BIKER standing next to him
smiling.
BIKER
Yep, you him. I seen your face in the
papers few years ago. Call you the
Machinegun Preacher, right?
Sam nods.
BIKER (CONT'D)
(to his buddies)
Told you this is the guy.
(TO SAM)
Hot damn, I knew it! Papers was talkin
bout how you was like some kinda African
Rambo or somethin, right?
SAM
You don't mind, I'd like to just sit here
right now.
BIKER
You still helpin them niggers over there?
Sam bristling...
BIKER (CONT'D)
The way I figure it, the reason you so
interested in helpin them porch monkeys
is cause you probably throwin it in them
nigger bitches, ain't ya?
The Biker smiles a nasty, malicious smile. His buddies moving next
to him now... and we see a quiet storm brewing in Sam...
BIKER (CONT'D)
Am I right? You a nigger fucker, boy?
A moment here --
Sam staring at the Biker with a look we've come to know -- and --
CRACKKKK! -- Sam HEAD-BUTTS the Biker's face and a sudden, violent
brawl breaks out -- Bikers swinging cue sticks -- Sam wading into
the crew -- swinging wild -- taking the Biker down and stomping on
his face -- bloody -- murderous -- and then --
Lynn behind the wheel as Sam comes around the passenger door and
gets in. And the two of them just sit here for a long beat, until...
LYNN
You're gonna sit there and you're gonna
lemme talk.
BEAT. Sam says nothing.
LYNN (CONT'D)
I've always believed in you. I trusted
you, trusted the Lord, and did what I
could so you could follow your dream.
(BEAT)
But I ain't willin to lose you to what
you're doin over there. Ain't gonna just
stand by and watch you get swallowed up
by it.
She looks to him and we see she has tears in her eyes...
LYNN (CONT'D)
I know you're all them kids got, but
you're all we got too. Paige needs her
father. I need my husband.
Sam sitting in a chair in the dark. And we hear his cell vibrating
on the desk. He picks it up and sees DONNIE'S name on the screen...
a moment here and then he sets the phone back down... doesn't answer
it... as we go...
Donnie on a couch and he looks like hell... pale, gaunt face...
phone at his ear listening to RINGING and RINGING... and then the
sound of Sam's voice...
RECORDED MESSAGE
This here's Sam. You know what to do.
(BEEEEP)
DONNIE
(QUIETLY)
Hey buddy, it's Donnie. Shoot, I was
hopin' you was there...
Donnie hesitating... doesn't hang-up... and we can feel how badly he
needs to talk to somebody...
DONNIE (CONT'D)
Other day I was thinkin bout when you and
me was kids.
(MORE)
102
DONNIE (CONT'D)
That summer we'd go down to the quarry
over in Montrose, remember that? We
hooked up them ropes and spent all day
swimmin and jumpin off them walls...
Donnie smiling to himself, a fleeting memory, and then something
dark coming over him. And now we see another man here in this shitty
dope house, cooking up a spoon of black tar, juicing a needle.
Donnie watching him like a hawk...
DONNIE (CONT'D)
I wish you was there to pray with me,
buddy.
DONNIE'S CORPSE lying in a casket...
Packed with mourners. And we hear a CHILDREN'S CHOIR singing a
plaintive hymnal... "My Jesus, I love thee"... and Donnie's mother
in the first pew, dressed in black, surrounded by a few other women
offering her comfort.
And now we see Sam moving up the steps to the platform... and the
choir softly finishes... and he looks out over the congregation...
not saying a word for a long beat... and then...
SAM
Most of you want me to stand up here and
make some sense outta this. That's why
you come here today. You want me to tell
you that God has his plan for all of us,
and when he wants to call us back home
he's gonna do it.
(BEAT)
That's what you wanna hear...
(QUIETLY)
That's what you wanna hear...
103
And Sam stops, unable to continue... just stares out at the
congregation... at the expectant faces looking back at him,
waiting...
... but he steps away from the lectern, down the steps, and walks up
the aisle toward the exit... the congregation staring at him as he
passes...
Hours later. Lynn and Paige still dressed from the funeral, driving
up the driveway to their house.
PAIGE
Mom, who are those men?
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD we see a FLATBED TRUCK parked next to the
house and 7 or 8 MOVERS pulling heavy machinery out of the barn.
Filled with movers busily hauling equipment out of the garage. Lynn
coming in, confused...
LYNN
Hey, s'cuse me...
And now she sees Sam going through a cabinet in the back.
LYNN (CONT'D)
Sam, what's goin on? What are these men
doin here?...
Sam slamming the cabinet closed, moving past her without saying a
word. Lynn grabbing his arm, stopping him.
LYNN (CONT'D)
Where are they taking our stuff?
SAM
Ain't ours no more. Best go through and
make sure they ain't takin nuthin that
belongs in the house.
104
He walks off...
LYNN
Sam...
And she sees two men start to dismantle the "Childers Construction
Company" sign that she painted herself years ago --
LYNN (CONT'D)
Hey! -- Don't touch that! --
... Sam coming inside, moving to the kitchen... Lynn following him.
LYNN
Honey, I know you're hurtin. I know
you're angry, but we need to talk about
this...
SAM
It's all done, so save yer breath...
where's the keys to the safe?
Sam grabs papers from the counter and hands them to Lynn. She
quickly pages through them, can't believe what she's reading.
LYNN
You sold the business for $27,000?
SAM
I need a new truck for the orphanage.
LYNN
A new truck? You sold our business for a
new truck?
Sam finds the Keys.
LYNN (CONT'D)
That was our future, Sam. Paige's future.
Lynn follows Sam into the office.
105
LYNN (CONT'D)
Everything we have has gone to those
children, Sam. There's a point when there
ain't no more to give.
SAM
What's the combination? What's the
fucking combination.
LYNN
Paige's birthday.
Sam starts to spin the combination but hesitates...
LYNN (CONT'D)
You don't know it, do you? You don't even
remember your own daughter's birthday.
SAM
What are the numbers?
LYNN
You fight for everyone but us.
She moves past him, spinning the combination and cranking open the
vault. Sam grabbing a couple stacks of cash.
LYNN (CONT'D)
You take that and we lose the house. The
church. All of it.
SAM
You can make it up with the ministry.
LYNN
What ministry?! They see what you've
become, Sam. They see how far gone you
are. You need to get quiet with The Lord.
And he looks to her...
SAM
Fuck the Lord.
LYNN
Don't say that. Don't turn yer back on
him.
SAM
... He turned his back on me! -- on
Donnie! -- on every one of them kids over
there.
LYNN
The good you're doin is destroyin this
family.
106
SAM
What good have I ever done?
Sam standing here, weighing something in his mind. A choice he must
make here... and finally he moves past her...
LYNN
Please don't leave...
But he's gone.
CUT TO:
30 or 40 adults and children here eating the last meal of the day.
And we see Sam in a corner, off from the rest of the group. And
maybe it's just the lighting in here, but there's a darkness around
him -- literally as if the space surrounding this man is devoid of
light.
And we see William working his way through the room... refilling
cups with hot tea... his particular job here... and he comes up to
Sam and accidently sloshes some of the tea onto Sam's arm and he
flinches! -- burned -- "Damn it!" -- shoots his arm out and
accidentally hits William in the chest -- knocking him backward onto
the ground.
The entire room falls silent. Nobody moving.
And Sam gets up and walks out of the room.
A convoy of 2 OR 3 AID RELIEF TRUCKS coming down this dirt road. And
we see Agnete here with a DRIVER in the first truck as they drive
onto a NARROW BRIDGE -- and just before they reach the other side --
A PICKUP TRUCK filled with heavily armed LRA REBELS pulls in front
of them, cutting them off.
AGNETE
STOP THE TRUCK! -- STOP!! --
107
The truck grinding to a halt. The driver becoming terrified, trying
to jam the truck into reverse --
AGNETE (CONT'D)
No, no, no! -- don't go back --
DRIVER
WE ARE GOING TO DIE! -- THEY WILL KILL
US!
AGNETE
You move and they'll shoot! -- calm down!
-- I will talk to them.
Agnete climbing out of the truck as we go --
William coming in quietly, moving next to one of the captured Rebels
from the previous scene who is shackled to a bed, injured. Two SPLA
soldiers here standing guard.
WILLIAM
(ARABIC)
I want to ask you something...
William pulls out the photograph of his brother, holds it up...
WILLIAM (CONT'D)
This is my brother. His name is
Christopher. He was stolen by the rebels.
(BEAT)
Do you know if he is alive?
The Rebel looks at the photograph but says nothing, just shakes his
head... and he looks off, his thousand yard stare inscrutable...
And William simply folds the photograph back up and slips it into
his pocket... but he doesn't leave... he sits here a moment
longer... quietly... thinking... and then...
109
WILLIAM (CONT'D)
Were you taken when you were young like
me?
The Rebel hears this and turns to him... and nods his head...
WILLIAM (CONT'D)
Do you remember your parents?
And we see something happening in this hardened rebel... his eyes
filling with a distant memory... a sadness... and slowly he nods his
head again.
And we stay here with these two lost souls sitting next to each
other... silent... connected by a shared history and anguish.
And we see Sam here in the dark... moonlight filtering in through
the thatched roof... like shards of glass cutting through the
blackness... and he doesn't look right here... soul worn thin...
eyes hollow... starting to go someplace very bad...
110
... IMAGES FLASHING IN HIS HEAD... babies burned and screaming...
Donnie in his coffin... and we realize we're watching something
here... his world starting to cave in on him...
... and he drops against his cot... distraught... tears in his eyes
and this man is breaking... and suddenly we see a gun in his hand...
finger curling around the trigger as he puts it to his head... eyes
closing against the world... and...
WE HEAR A KNOCK AT HIS DOOR
Sam frozen... still holding the gun... and slowly the door pushes
open and we hear soft footsteps shuffling into this dark room...
... and William steps into the light, sees Sam here on the ground
with the gun in his hand... and slowly he moves next to him, sitting
on the cot without saying a word... just the two of them here for a
moment... and then slowly he begins in perfect English...
WILLIAM
I remember my parents when I sleep. I see
them in my dreams sometimes.
Sam looking to William... this small boy sitting above him...
telling his story...
WILLIAM (CONT'D)
My father was big like you. They shot
him. We were so scared. Then the rebels
gave me a club and told me if I didn't
kill my mother they would shoot my
brother and me.
And William pauses in his story... lost in this memory... his face
becoming a mask of pain... but no tears... there are no more tears
in this young man left to be shed... and so he continues...
WILLIAM (CONT'D)
I refused, but my mother told me to swing
hard... that I must make her proud...
(BEAT)
And so I did. I made her proud.
And now William looks down at Sam... staring at this man on the
ground... and he reaches out and gently touches Sam's head... a
moment of tenderness for both of them... an act of love.... these
two broken souls finding each another here... and William says...
WILLIAM (CONT'D)
If we allow ourselves to become full of
hate then they've won. We must not let
them take our hearts. This is the most
important thing.
111
And Sam sets the gun down and reaches out to William, pulls him into
an embrace... holding him close... and we know that without a doubt
this boy has saved this man's life.
Soft Christian music is playing on the radio. Lynn folding clothes
in the laundry room when the phone rings. Paige comes into the
upstairs hallway and answers it.
PAIGE
(quiet, into phone)
Hello?
Sam on his sat phone --
SAM
Bug? You there?
PAIGE
Dad?
SAM
Yeah, it's me.
PAIGE
You ok?
SAM
I'm ok, Bug.
And there's a long pause... so much to say but no words to say it...
each of them holding their phones to their ears and just
listening... and finally Sam says...
SAM (CONT'D)
I'm thinkin of a tree...
And we see tears well up in Paige's eyes when she hears this... and
now we see Lynn coming around the corner, overhearing them as they
begin their little game one more time...
PAIGE
You said tree... I'm thinkin of a knee.
Sam smiling to himself... and we realize this man is coming back to
life when he says...
SAM
You said knee, I'm thinkin of bee...
(BEAT)
I love you, Bug.
112
PAIGE
I love you too, Daddy.
Lynn hearing this and tears roll down her cheeks as we go...
And we see William here alone, pulling out a small satchel...
filling it with a bottle of water and a blanket...
Sam coming into the building, finding Betty tending to a sick child.
SAM
Have you seen William?
Betty shaking her head "no", and we see the worry on Sam's face...
intuitively knows something is wrong.
William bound and gagged being dragged through the bush by 5 or 6
rebels... and one of the rebels sees him staring at them and he
brings the butt of his Kalishnikov down hard -- striking William on
the head as we go --
Sam, Deng, Nineteen and Marco in this lead truck... been out here
for hours... behind them we see the second camp truck following...
And they come to a fork in the road, pulling to a stop.
116
DENG
It will be light soon. What do you want
to do?
Sam looking at a topo map on his lap...
SAM
Let's go through Maridi, see if they've
seen anything.
Both SUV's parked off the side of the road now. Sam and Deng here,
looking at maps and the GPS tracker. And we hear Deng's radio
squawk. He digs it out, responds in Arabic, then turns to Sam...
DENG
The village outside of Akot says an LRA
caravan came through there an hour ago.
They were headed for Ed Duim.
A convoy of 4 or 5 LRA trucks barreling down this dirt track. And we
see lots of rebels standing up in the back of these trucks, cradling
heavy weapons, alert -- and suddenly we see in the distance --
TWO ROOSTER-TAILS OF DUST COMING AT US
From different angles -- converging on the LRA convoy -- the Rebels
see them and point -- they know what's coming and they begin to
prepare for war --
THE ROOSTER-TAILS
Getting closer -- and then we see them --
SAM'S TWO TRUCKS
Bouncing over the terrain towards us -- coming fast -- and then --
WOOOOSH!
An RPG streaks toward the lead LRA truck and -- KABOOOM! -- the
truck is blown off it's axles -- the other LRA trucks pulling off
the road -- and suddenly we're in a withering firefight -- the roar
of heavy weapons at full-tilt.
SAM AND HIS MEN
117
Jumping out of their trucks and flanking the LRA convoy --
triangulating fire -- shredding the rebels -- blowing them back off
their feet.
NINETEEN
Sprinting through the bush -- edging around the LRA trucks --
finding a position on their weak side and locking an RPG into a
launcher -- shouldering it -- aiming -- WOOOOSH! -- the missile
streaking toward the second LRA jeep and --
KABOOOM!
It's blasted into the air -- onto it's side -- rebels scurrying away
from the wreckage -- still firing -- an absolute hail of lead --
AK's barking in every direction --
KRATAKRATAKRATAKRATAKRAKKK!
One of the rebels standing up -- firing an RPG -- WOOOOOSH!
MARCO crouched behind the new orphanage truck firing -- sees the
white streak coming at him -- dives -- just as --
THE TRUCK IS EVISCERATED IN THE BLAST!
SAM moving closer to the rebels -- shooting -- picking them off one
by one -- gunfire raking over his head -- a dozen muzzle flashes
coming from everywhere -- Sam yelling over the thunder --
SAM
Go! -- Go! -- Go! -- Go!
And we see Deng coming out of the bush to his right -- and then
Nineteen to his left -- and they charge on the remaining rebels --
Sam providing covering fire -- a curtain of lead cutting through the
enemy -- and just like that it's over -- Sam waving behind him --
SAM (CONT'D)
Cease fire!!
-- and suddenly there's just a sick silence -- smoke rising from the
shot-to-shit LRA trucks -- bodies strewn in the dirt -- the brand
new orphanage truck bombed out and smoking on it's side.
And Sam makes his way to the first TRANSPORT TRUCK -- Deng covering
him as he rips the canvas back to see --
50 CHILDREN CRAMMED INTO THE BACK OF THIS TRUCK
SAM (CONT'D)
Pull em all out! C'mon, let's go!
DENG
(to Soldiers, Arabic)
Take them out.
118
Soldiers start to unload the children --
SAM
Cut them loose!
DENG
(to soldier, Arabic)
Cut the ropes!
Sam moves to the second TRANSPORT TRUCK, rips the canvas back to
FIND --
50 MORE CHILDREN SHACKLED IN THE BACK OF THIS TRUCK
Holy fuck indeed.
He's been here before... 100 kids and he only has one good
vehicle... and we watch him standing here... staring at these tiny
faces looking back at him... a moment... lost in indecision until
one of the kids stands up near the back...
IT'S WILLIAM
Sam sees him and suddenly he knows exactly what he needs to do...
SAM
C'MON, LET'S GO!... get em out of there
and line em up! -- C'MON! --
And we've seen this before... Sam going through these children...
assessing their health... one by one... separating the worse off
from the others... forming two group... turning to Deng and Nineteen
and motioning to the smaller group (about 15 children)...
SAM (CONT'D)
Load these here into the truck. Put em
three deep if you have to...
Deng herding the children toward the one good truck...
SAM (CONT'D)
(turning to Marco, Arabic)
Come with me --
NEW ANGLE
Sam and Marco moving from one dead LRA rebel to the other... rolling
them onto their backs... going through their belts... pulling out
extra ammo clips and grenades...
SAM (CONT'D)
Get them AK's too.
(ARABIC)
The machine guns.
Marco swinging four or five machine guns onto his shoulder...
119
NEW ANGLE
At the SUV, now jammed with children. Sam talking to Nineteen, Marco
and the others...
SAM (CONT'D)
I need all you to climb up on that roof
and keep yer eyes peeled. That road back
might be hot, so be ready.
NINETEEN
What about you, Preacher?
VOICE (O.S.)
We're staying.
Sam turns to see Deng next to him, holding an AK in his hands, a
steely resolve in his eyes. Sam nods, emboldened by his support.
SAM
(to the soldiers)
Go on. Get outta here.
The soldiers load onto the SUV and drive off, leaving Sam and Deng
standing here in the middle of these 85 children.
Waiting for the war that will surely come.
And we stay in this truck as it pulls away... driving for a long
time... until Sam, Deng, and the children become only specks on the
horizon... and then...
WHITE LETTERS ON A BLACK SCREEN THAT READ --
"To this day, Sam Childers fights for the children of Sudan and
Northern Uganda."
THE END

LEGENDS:
Joseph Kony and his Lord's Resistance Army continue their reign of
terror in Sudan and Northern Uganda.
Amnesty International estimates that Kony and the LRA are
responsible for over 400,000 murders and more than 40,000 child
abductions. These children are tortured, raped, sold into sex
slavery, and forced to take part in ritualized killing by LRA
commanders.
The Islamic Government of Sudan continues to provide weapons and
safe haven to Kony and the LRA as part of a deal to wage a proxy war
against the predominately Christian South.
Without pressure from the United States, this support will continue
and more innocent children will be slaughtered.
Now you know.
121
As of 2011, Sam Childers has rescued over 800 children from the LRA.
His `Angels of East Africa Orphanage' is home to more than 300
orphans, and feeds over 1200 meals a day to neighboring villagers in
need.
