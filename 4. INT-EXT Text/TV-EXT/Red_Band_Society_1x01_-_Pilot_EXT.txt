      An old Dodge TRUCK with plates reading  Mexico  is in line at 

      The window rolls down. The BORDER PATROL OFFICER leans in.

                                      BORDER PATROL OFFICER
                    Where you going? What re your 
                    plans? 

      ALEX, the driver, 15, says nothing. 

                                      BORDER PATROL OFFICER
                    Help me here. 

      The passenger, JORDI PALACIOS, 14, leans over from his side. 
      He is wearing a Dodgers hat and has enormous eyes radiating 
      an old soul. Except at the moment, he appears somewhat 
        hyperactive.

                                    JORDI
                    We re going to a Dodger game! Yes!  

      Alex looks apologetically to the Officer.

                                    ALEX
                    My cousin Jordi is crazy. 

                                      BORDER PATROL OFFICER
                    Passport, Jordi. And yours...

      Alex gives Jordi a look like idiot. Unfazed Jordi hands his 
      passport to the Officer. Alex slowly reaches for his wallet.

                                    JORDI
                    I was born in L.A.  FOX RED BAND NAGLE 1.10.14                                 2


                                      BORDER PATROL OFFICER
                    I can read. 

      He looks down at the picture of Jordi with his longish hair, 
      then looks up scrutinizing him now.

                                      BORDER PATROL OFFICER
                    Can I see you without your hat on? 

      A BEAT. A moment of decision for Jordi. He takes off his hat 
      revealing he s completely bald. 

                                    JORDI
                    I shaved it for the Dodgers. For 
                    luck. 

                                      BORDER PATROL OFFICER
                              (to Alex, amused)
                    He is crazy. The Dodgers suck.

      He hands Jordi his passport back and waves them through.

      A HOT FEMALE BODY in a cheerleading uniform soaring through 
      the air. She gets caught clumsily in the arms of a MALE 
        CHEERLEADER. 

                                    HOT CHEERLEADER
                    Ow! You just gave me niplash! 

      KARA SOUDERS, 16, is dictator of the CO-ED CHEERLEADING 
      SQUAD. Beautiful, smart and mean. She would have made an 
      awesome Nazi. 

                                    KARA

                    Your ash burned my arm.

      We pull back to reveal the rest of the CO-ED CHEERLEADING 
      SQUAD standing in a pyramid. Kara paces in front of them.

                    Every Superhero and Princess 
                      surrendered their candy to her. 

      FRIGHTENED KIDS DUMP THEIR BAGS OF CANDY INTO KARA S SACK.

      PRESENT Kara puts out her cigarette in her water bottle. 

                                    KARA
                    This water sucks by the way. 

      Kara thrusts the bottle into the hands of LOW SELF-ESTEEMY 
      WATER GIRL, 15, as she walks over to climb the pyramid. 

                                    KARA
                    It tastes like pee.

      TWO MALE CHEERLEADERS look guilty and stifle their laughter.

      Kara s on top of the pyramid. She massages her boobs.

                                    KARA
                    Let s do it again and try not to 
                    bruise these babies. 

      Kara suddenly begins to sway. Her eyes roll back as she loses 
      consciousness falling to the ground, landing spectacularly on 
      a pile of towels, legs splayed.  

      Water Girl runs to Kara and throws the pee/water mixture on 
      Kara s face to revive her.

                                    MALE CHEERLEADER
                    Now we can watch her melt.

      The CHEERLEADING SQUAD immediately pull out their phones. Not 
      to call 9-1-1, but to take SNAP CHAT photos of Kara passed 
      out.

      Water Girl has clearly dreamed of the moment she can put her 
      mouth on Kara s. She dives onto her and begins some Girl-on-
      Girl CPR. All the phones are recording this.

      Doctors, Nurses, Orderlies, Administrators filter through

      A WOMAN in scrubs, 40 s, crosses in front of the truck. She 
      slams her fist on the hood and points.

      Sunlight. Bright. Hot. Charlie sits at the top of the high 
      diving board in swim shorts. Kara comes climbing up the 
      ladder to the top, wearing a butt ugly bathing suit.

      The sound of a defibrillator gets louder and louder. Kara

                              (quietly)
                    Bring your A game. 

      Ace starts coughing on cue. It s really impressive.   FOX RED BAND NAGLE 1.10.14                                 39


                                    DR. MO-FO
                    You re faking. 

      Ace falls to the ground coughing harder as a CROWD gathers. 

                                    LEO
                    What kind of doctor says that to a 
                    kid with cystic fibrosis and two 
                    kids with cancer in front of a 
                      children s hospital? 

        Embarrassed, Mo-Fo gets in his car and drives off with the 
      beer and the In & Out still in the trunk. 

      Ace jumps up fast yelling to anyone who will listen.

                                    ACE
                    My beer! That doctor stole my beer! 
                    And my condoms! 


      Leo, Jordi, Ace, Emma and Kara step outside. It s a million 
      dollar view. They turn around to see a spread of food, 
      couches and music. It s all set up just for them. Ace is 
      stunned.

                                    LEO
                    That was some trade, Ace. Nice 
                    work.

      For once Ace is speechless.


      Music plays. The lights of L.A. shine in the distance. Kara 
      approaches Leo. 

                                    KARA
                    I need a phone. That Nazi Nurse 
                    took mine. 

      Leo watches Emma and Jordi talking. Kara watches Leo watch 
      them.

                                    LEO
                              (distracted)
                    Oh yeah... sure. Here.

      Leo hands her his phone. Kara looks at it.  FOX RED BAND NAGLE 1.10.14                                 49


                                    KARA
                              (cringing)
                    This is really old. Like 2013. 

                                    LEO
                    Can you ever just give it a rest?

                                    KARA
                              (with vulnerability)
                    If I could don t you think I would?

      For a brief moment we see the price Kara pays for being Kara. 


      Her shift over, Brittany is pulling out of the parking lot. 
      She s driving a beat-up Mazda with Kansas plates. She notices 
      fellow HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES boarding a city bus. One of them is 
      Nurse Hernandez. Just another person in a crowd.


      As Hernandez waits to board the bus she glances over her 
      shoulder at the hospital. Something catches her eye. 

      HER POV -- A window of the hospital where white surgical tape 
      spells out the message: PLEASE SEND PIZZA ROOM 3115. 

      Pissed, Hernandez whips out her cell phone. Not an iPhone, 
      but a now antiquated flip phone, and punches in numbers.
