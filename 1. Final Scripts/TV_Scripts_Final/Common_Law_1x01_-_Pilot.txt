1EXT.  CULVER CITY COMMUNITY CENTER - DAY1

      A woman's voice talks over the establishing shot of this
      modern community center.

                                    DR. RYAN (O.S.)
                    Today, we're going to discuss
                      intimacy...


2INT.  CULVER CITY COMMUNITY CENTER - DAY2

    We MOVE though the center and find a door to a meeting room. 
      There is a handwritten sign on the door, "Shhh!  Couples
      Therapy in Session."

                                    DR. RYAN (O.S.)
                    ...and that doesn't just mean sex...


3INT.  CULVER CITY COMMUNITY CENTER, MEETING ROOM - DAY3

    We enter the room to find DR. ELYSE RYAN (30s, attractive)
      leading a group therapy session.  Five DISPARATE COUPLES sit
    in fold-up chairs arranged in a circle.

                                    DR. RYAN
                    Intimacy's about trusting enough to
                    share your most personal secrets.

    As she talks, she passes out a stack of stapled papers.

                                    DR. RYAN (CONT'D)
                    Your partner can't know what your
                    needs are unless they really know
                    you.  So...

      The CAMERA circles around, following the stack of papers as
      it's passed from couple to couple.  First, an elderly
      Vietnamese couple take two.  This is MR. and MRS. NGO.

                                    DR. RYAN (CONT'D)
                    These are Partner Awareness Profiles,
                    and it's going to be your homework
                    this week...

      Next, a 40-something couple from the suburbs take two surveys
      and pass them along.  This is KATHY (a desperate housewife)
      and her husband STEVE (an aging frat boy).      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/102.
 

                                    DR. RYAN (CONT'D)
                    You have to do this assignment
                    together.  It's a list of questions
                    that you answer for each other...

      A trailer park/biker couple sporting matching ball-and-chain
      tattoos each take a survey and pass the rest along.  This is
      CLYDE and ROZELLE (both in their 50s).

                                    DR. RYAN (CONT'D)
                    We are going to go behind closed
                    doors and peel away the layers...

      A young, new-agey couple (DAKOTA and PETER) take surveys.
      They're the only couple holding hands.  So in love.

                                    DR. RYAN (CONT'D)
                    ...of our expectations, jealousies,
                    and fears just like we peel off our
                    clothes...

      The CAMERA finally stops on TWO GUYS.  This is TRAVIS MARKS
      (30s, jeans, unshaven) and WES MITCHELL (30s, clean-cut,
      wearing a tailored suit).

                                    DR. RYAN (CONT'D)
                    ...and expose ourselves.  

      Travis takes a survey, but Wes doesn't.  Travis elbows him.

                                    DR. RYAN (CONT'D)
                    Who wants to go first?

      Dr. Ryan scans the group, stopping on Travis and Wes.

                                    DR. RYAN (CONT'D)
                    Let's start with Wes and Travis.

      The guys shift uncomfortably.  Us?  First?

                                    DR. RYAN (CONT'D)
                    How long have you been together?

                                      WES/TRAVIS
                    Two years./Five years.

                                    WES
                    We've known each other for five. 
                    We've been partners for two.

                                    DR. RYAN
                    Wes, tell me.  How did Travis get
                    his name?      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/103.
 

      Wes shrugs.  He clearly does not want to be here.

                                    WES
                    Travis was adopted.  I doubt he even
                    knows.

      That instantly irritates Travis.

                                      TRAVIS
                    I wasn't adopted.
                          (to the group)
                    I grew up in foster care. 

                                    WES
                    OK, smart guy.  How did you get your
                    name?

                                      TRAVIS
                    Dr. Ryan's asking you, not me.

                                    WES
                          (to the group)
                    See?  I was right.  He doesn't know. 
                    Nobody knows.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Alex knows.

      The mention of the name "Alex" burns Wes.

                                    WES
                    You're not allowed to talk about
                    Alex.  

                                    DR. RYAN
                    Who's Alex?

                                      TRAVIS
                    Wes's ex.

      Wes clearly doesn't want to talk about Alex.

                                    WES
                    Aren't we supposed to be talking
                    about why no one wanted to adopt
                    Travis?

                                      TRAVIS
                    You're deflecting.

                                    WES
                    I'm getting back on topic, which is:  
                    why does no one like you?      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/104.
 

                                      TRAVIS
                    Now, you're projecting.  You're the
                    one no one likes.

      The group watches, amused by the exchange.  Steve leans into
      Kathy and talks low.

                                      STEVE
                    These guys make us look good.

                                    MRS. NGO
                    They're never gonna make it.

      Sitting next to her, Peter shoots Mrs. Ngo a disdainful look.

                                      PETER
                    Why do you have to be so negative
                    all the time?

      Rozelle overhears Peter's comment and eyes him and his lovey-
      dovey partner Dakota, annoyed.

                                      ROZELLE
                    You guys just got married.  What're
                    you even doing in here?

                                      DAKOTA
                    Because we don't want to be you in
                    twenty years, OK?

      Dakota curls her hand around Peter's.

                                    DR. RYAN
                    All right.  Remember, everyone:  we
                    express feelings, not judgments or
                    opinions--

      She's interrupted by two BEEPING PDAs.  Both Wes and Travis
      check their phones, and then they both jump up.

                                      WES/TRAVIS
                    We have to go./Sorry, Dr. Ryan.

                                    DR. RYAN
                    Don't forget to complete your partner
                    profiles!

      Travis grabs the profiles, and they rush out.  Dr. Ryan calls
      after them--

                                    DR. RYAN (CONT'D)
                    It's the gateway to true intimacy!      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/105.
 


4EXT.  CULVER CITY COMMUNITY CENTER - DAY4

      Travis catches up with Wes as they head to the parking lot.

                                    WES
                    I can't believe we're doing this.

                                      TRAVIS
                    We wouldn't be if you hadn't pulled
                    your gun on me.

                                    WES
                    I wouldn't have pulled my gun on you
                    if you'd just learn to apologize.

                                      TRAVIS
                    I didn't do anything wrong.

                                    WES
                    You know what?  Just shut up. 

                                      TRAVIS
                    Dr. Ryan said we're supposed to talk
                    about these things.

      They reach a silver Fisker Karma hybrid sports car parked at
      the curb and Wes clicks the doors unlocked.

                                      TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                    I think she's going to be good for
                    us.  She seems really smart.

      Wes shoots Travis a look, realizing--

                                    WES
                    Give it up.  She's way out of your league.


5INT.  WES'S CAR - DAY5

      They climb in, and Wes fires up the engine.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Is that what you think?  That I'd
                    hit on our therapist?  

                                    WES
                    Are you seriously asking me that?

      Travis gets on the police radio--

                                      TRAVIS
                    Homicide Unit Two, responding to
                    1522 Fulton Street for body found.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/106.
 

    We now realize that Wes and Travis are not gay partners.
      They are COP PARTNERS.


6EXT.  DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES, SKID ROW - DAY6

      Wes and Travis head to the cordoned-off crime scene, which
    is swarming with FIRST RESPONDERS and CRIME SCENE TECHNICIANS.

      They're greeted by a sloppy, overweight BEAT COP, who's
      surprised to see them together.  They talk as they all push
      through a crowd of LOOKIE-LOOS. 

                                    BEAT COP
                    I thought you guys broke up. 

                                      TRAVIS
                    We're in couples counseling.

      The beat cop laughs, then realizes they're not joking.

                                    BEAT COP
                    Get out.  For real?

                                      TRAVIS
                    We wanted to find the magic again.

      Wes's look says it all.  The beat cop considers that.

                                    BEAT COP
                    Does that work?  Because my wife
                    keeps saying we need counseling.  

      Wes regards the slovenly cop, incredulous.

                                    WES
                    You're married?

                                    BEAT COP
                    13 years.  Now, all of a sudden she
                    thinks I'm a sex-addict because I
                    want to do it more than once a month. 
                    Maybe the wife and I should join
                    your group.

      They duck under the police tape cordoning off the area.  

                                    WES
                    Let me save you a lot of time and
                    money.  You don't need therapy.  You
                    just need to lose weight.  

                                    BEAT COP
                    She says she likes me chubby.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/107.
 

                                    WES
                    And you believe her?

      That stops the beat cop.  He regards Wes.

                                    BEAT COP
                    You're an asshole, you know that?

                                      TRAVIS
                    No.  He doesn't know that.  That's
                    why he's in therapy.

      They arrive at the DEAD BODY wearing filthy jeans, no shoes,
      and lying face-down in the mud.  

                                    WES
                    So, what do we got?

                                    BEAT COP
                    Victim is a white male.  Indigent.  
                    John Doe.  Puncture wounds in the
                    neck.  

      Donning rubber gloves, Wes and Travis kneel to inspect the
      body.  Travis searches the victim's pockets.  Wes lifts the
      victim's shirt.  The skin on the victim's back is reddish.  

                                    BEAT COP (CONT'D)
                    Another homeless junkie looking to
                    score got the Sidewalk Special.  

                                    WES
                      Interesting theory.  Except the victim
                    wasn't killed here--he's lying on
                    his stomach, but the hypostasis on
                    his back indicates he was moved.  He
                    wasn't homeless either.  He's wearing
                    designer jeans.

      Wes and Travis gently roll the body over, and we now see the
      victim's face.  The victim has a straggly beard and more
      stab wounds to his chest and cuts on his hands.

                                    WES (CONT'D)
                    But you were right about the white
                    male part.  Keep up the good work,
                    and you'll make captain in no time.

                                    BEAT COP
                          (to Travis)
                    How do you work with this guy?      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/108.
 

                                      TRAVIS
                    Our therapist says it's because I'm
                    attracted to abusive relationships.

      Wes spots something poking out under the VICTIM'S BODY.  He
      reaches down and slides out a BLOODY EAGLE SCOUT KNIFE.  

                                    WES
                    Eagle Scout knife.

                                      TRAVIS
                    What?  They giving out merit badges
                    for killing homeless people now?

      Wes shoots him a look. 

                                      TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                    You used to laugh at my jokes.

                                    WES
                    You used to be funny.

      The knife is photographed, bagged, and tagged as they talk.

                                    WES (CONT'D)
                          (to the beat cop)
                    Any witnesses?  

                                    BEAT COP
                    Probably, but no one's talking.  Bad
                    for business.  Fulton Street is the
                    Rodeo Drive of drug dealing.

      Travis scans the crowd of lookie-loos.

                                      TRAVIS
                    You know, when I was a kid, I lived
                    in a neighborhood like this.  One
                    time, this rich guy crashed his car,
                    and by the time the ambulance arrived,
                    his rims, radio, watch, wedding
                      ring...everything was gone. 

      Catching on, Wes looks to the shoeless John Doe, then follows
      Travis's gaze to the crowd where Wes now notices--

      A TEENAGER wearing new sneakers.  

                                      WES/TRAVIS
                    Let me do the talking.  

      But the teenager realizes they're looking at him and takes
      off running.  Wes and Travis peel off in pursuit, leaving
      the beat cop confused.  He calls after them--      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/109.
 

                                    BEAT COP
                    Hey!  Where're you going?!


7EXT.  EAST LOS ANGELES NEIGHBORHOOD - VARIOUS - DAY7

      The teenager bangs into people on the crowded sidewalk.  We
      TRACK with him as he cuts across a street and weaves through
      traffic.  

    ON WES and TRAVIS, sprinting in pursuit.

                                    WES
                    He's headed for the apartments.

      Indeed, the teenager ducks into the entrance to a run-down
      building.  Travis calls out an audible as he pulls ahead--

                                      TRAVIS
                    '97 Packers!

                                    WES
                    Got it!

      Wes peels down an alley as Travis charges into--


8INT.  TENEMENT APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY8

      Travis enters the empty lobby.  He freezes.  Listens. 
      FOOTSTEPS can be heard running in a nearby stairwell--


9INT.  TENEMENT APARTMENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL - DAY9

      Trash, hypodermics, and crack pipes crunch under Travis's
      boots as he bounds up the stairs three at a time.  For the
      first time, we see how truly athletic Travis is.


10INT.  TENEMENT APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY10

      The teenager sprints down the dank hall, sucking gas.  Travis
    is 20 yards back but gaining.

                                      TRAVIS
                    You can't outrun me.  I was steeple
                    chase State Champion!

      The teenager rounds a corner.  Comes to a dead-end.  But
      doesn't quit.  He DIVES OUT THE FIRE ESCAPE WINDOW!


11EXT.  TENEMENT APARTMENT BUILDING, FIRE ESCAPE - DAY11

      The teenager CRASHES through the glass and shoulder-rolls to
      his feet.  He grabs the ladder and rides it down--      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1010.
 


12EXT.  ALLEY - DAY12

      The teenager lets go and drops, landing hard on the pavement. 
    He comes up to find--

      Wes.  He grabs the teenager.

                                    WES
                    Take it easy.  We just want to talk
                    to you.

      The teenager doubles over, exhausted.

                                      TEENAGER
                    I didn't do anything! 

      Travis jumps down from the fire escape ladder.

                                      TRAVIS
                    You killed a guy for his shoes. 

                                      TEENAGER
                    I didn't kill anyone.

                                    WES
                    No one thinks you did.

                                      TRAVIS
                    I do.

                                      TEENAGER
                    He was already dead.  

                                      TRAVIS
                    You know how many times we've heard
                    that one?

                                      TEENAGER
                    I swear.  I just took his shoes.

                                      TRAVIS
                    He's lying.  Let's shoot him.

      Travis reaches for his gun.  

                                    WES
                    Travis, you can't shoot him.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Why not?  He ran from a crime scene. 
                    He's wearing the victim's shoes. 
                    I'm betting after I shoot him, we
                    find more evidence on him.  And if
                    not, we'll plant evidence on him--      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1011.
 

      Travis checks his magazine.

                                      TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                    I'd better put in the untraceable
                    bullets...

      The teenager watches nervously as Travis starts switching
      out the bullets.  

                                      TEENAGER
                    All right!  I took his cellphone and
                    wallet.  He had no money...  

      The teenager pulls a CELLPHONE and a WALLET out of his pocket.

                                      TEENAGER (CONT'D)
                    You cops are worse than criminals.

                                    WES
                    Hey, don't lump me in with him.  

      Wes checks the cellphone.  The face is CRACKED.  He tries to
      turn it on, but--

                                    WES (CONT'D)
                    Looks like the cellphone's toast. 
                    Hopefully, ITC can pull some data
                    off it.   

    As Wes talks, Travis opens the wallet.  Inside, he finds an
    ID with a UNITED STATES SENATE SEAL on it.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Check this out.

      CLOSE ON ID:  Under the SENATE SEAL (an EAGLE grasping a
      U.S. FLAG), we see the VICTIM's photo and the typed words:

      "FAMILY OF SENATOR ROBERT MACCALLUM.  RELATIONSHIP:  SON"

                                    WES
                    Our John Doe is the son of a senator.

      Travis and Wes exchange a knowing look.

                                      TRAVIS
                    This is going to be all over the
                    news.  

                                    WES
                    Maybe your real mom will recognize
                    you on T.V. and finally try to contact
                    you.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1012.
 

                                      TRAVIS
                      "Biological mom" is the correct term. 
                    All of my moms are "real."

    As they continue to bicker we--

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


      TITLE CARD OVER BLACK SCREEN:

              "You may feel as though you know your partner
                quite well--maybe too well...but you'd be 
                      surprised at what you don't know."

                      --From Relationship Rescue, by Dr. Phil


13INT.  WES'S CAR, MOVING - DAY13

      Wes drives.  Riding shotgun, Travis fills out the profile.

                                      TRAVIS
                    "Question 1:  Where did you meet
                    your partner?"  Easy.  Police Academy
                      sharp-shooting competition.  I won.

                                    WES
                    I won.  And we're not doing the
                      questionnaire.

                                      TRAVIS
                    "Question 2:  Has your partner ever
                    had his heart broken?"

      Wes shoots Travis a look that could kill.

                                      TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                    OK.  Let's skip that one.
                          (skips ahead)
                    Here's an easy one.  "What's your
                    partner's favorite color?"
                          (Wes ignores him)
                    You have to answer.  Captain's orders,
                    remember?  We're gonna lose our jobs
                    if we don't pass therapy.

                                    WES
                    No one "passes" therapy.  It doesn't
                    work that way.  They just show you
                    ink blots until you admit you feel
                    like a woman in a man's body, which
                    only leads to either surgery or more
                    therapy.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1013.
 

                                      TRAVIS
                    Fine. 
                          (writes something)
                    "Pink."


14EXT.  L.A.P.D. SOUTH BUREAU, CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - DAY14

      CAPT. PHIL SUTTON (50s, an ex-Marine) sits behind his desk. 
    We may notice he wears prayer beads on his wrist, and right
      now, something's burning on his desk...a cigar?

      Wes and Travis stand in his office.  They try to act like
      the smoke isn't bothering them.

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    This has got to be by-the-book.  The
                    D.A. can't have her detectives
                    objecting to each other's testimony
                    in court.

                                      TRAVIS
                    We're not like that anymore, Cap. 
                    Right, Wes?

                                    WES
                    Right.

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    Really?  Because I heard about your
                    session today.  Doesn't sound like
                    you two are making much progress.

                                    WES
                    Did Dr. Ryan tell you that?  Because
                    that's a violation of doctor-patient
                      confidentiality.

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    Wes, don't start in with your lawyer
                    crap.  You have no rights.  You lost 
                    them when you pulled your gun on
                    your partner. 

                                    WES
                    Travis has forgiven me for that. 
                    Why can't you?

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    Why do my two best detectives have
                    to be such a pain in the ass? 

                                    BETH (O.S.)
                    Are we interrupting something?      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1014.
 

      All heads turn to find Detectives BETH SANTANOVA (40s, butch)
      and NORA GOODEN (30s, lipstick lesbian) in the doorway.  

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    Yes, come in.

      They enter.  Nora waves the smoke from her face.  Travis and
      Wes exchange looks, realizing--

                                      TRAVIS
                    You're giving the case to Cagney and
                    Lacey?  

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    D.A. specifically requested them.

                                    BETH
                    Smart lady.

                                      TRAVIS
                    This is sexual discrimination.

                                    NORA
                    Or maybe the D.A. just wants the
                    best two dicks in the department on
                    the case.

                                    WES
                          (to the captain)
                    So the D.A.'s running your department
                    now?  Did she tell you what to wear
                    today too?

      Wes is trying to get a rise out of him, but the captain is
      steely.

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    If you're trying to make me angry,
                    Mitchell, it's not going to work.  I
                    know my triggers.  I've evolved.  Unlike
                    you two.

                                      TRAVIS
                    How do you know if you don't give us
                    a chance to prove we've changed?

      That stops the captain.  He considers that point.

                                    WES
                    You know this is an election year. 

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    Exactly, and this case will either
                    make or break the D.A.'s campaign.        Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1015.
 

                                    WES
                    Oh.  So you want the D.A. fired. 
                    That's actually brilliant.  It's
                    like reverse psychology.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Although it's also classic passive-
                    aggressive behavior.  If you don't

                    Thank you for caring enough to share. 
                    My partner and I promise to weigh

                    All right.  That's enough.
                          (to Wes and Travis)
                    I'm giving this case to you.  

      Wes and Travis grin.

                    But not because you want it--because
                    you need it.  It's going to force
                    you two to take your counseling
                    seriously.  The D.A.'s itching to
                    have you two thrown in jail, so you'd
                    better start learning how to get
                    along.  

                                      WES/TRAVIS

15INT.  L.A.P.D. SOUTH BUREAU, FORENSICS LAB - DAY15

      A high-tech sanctuary.  Sitting at a bay of computers is
      ELLEN (20s, nerdy, cute).  Wes and Travis look over her
      shoulder at a magnified picture of the knife.

                                      ELLEN
                    I've seen lots of different kinds of
                    knives used as murder weapons before:
                    steak knives, bowie knives, Ginsu
                    knives, but never an Eagle Scout
                    knife.  It's ironic.  It's poetic. 
                    It's making a statement.

                                    WES
                    We'll be sure to tell the killer how
                    much you appreciate his symbolism,
                    but in order to do that, we're going
                    to need some actual scientific
                    evidence to find him.

                                      ELLEN
                    I was getting to that.
                          (to Travis)
                    Your partner doesn't understand
                    foreplay, does he?

                                      TRAVIS
                    He's not a cuddler.

      Ellen and Travis share a flirtatious look.  That stops Wes.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1017.
 

                                    WES
                    Wait.  You two are...?

                                      ELLEN
                    Travis didn't tell you?

                                      TRAVIS
                    I told him.

                                    WES
                    No, you didn't.

                                      TRAVIS
                    So, now you know.  Can we please try
                    to stay focused on the case?

                                    WES
                    I don't know.  Can we?

                                      TRAVIS
                    Yes, we can.  
                          (to Ellen, professional)
                    Ellen, please continue.

                                      ELLEN
                    According to the RFLP DNA analysis,
                    the blood on the knife matched Tobey
                    MacCallum's.  

      She talks as she ZOOMS IN on the portion of the knife's handle
      not visible unless all of the elements are extended.  

                                      ELLEN (CONT'D)
                    And as far as prints go, the killer
                    did a pretty good job of wiping the
                    knife down, but...

    ON THE SCREEN, two HOLOGRAPHIC FINGERPRINTS (not bloody)
      rise off the inner handle ridges. 

                                      ELLEN (CONT'D)
                    I did manage to find two partials. 
                    One is Tobey's.  The other's unknown.
                    I ran it through IAFIS, but came up
                    empty.  Whoever else handled this
                    knife doesn't have a criminal record.

      Wes and Travis exit Ellen's office.

                    Where else am I supposed to meet
                    girls?  Everyone I meet is either
                    dead, a suspect, or under arrest.

      Wes just shakes his head balefully.

                                      TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                    Don't be like that.  I really like
                    her.

                                    WES
                    Uh-huh.

                                      TRAVIS
                    She could be "the one."

                    Hey, don't be a hater because I know
                    how to move on.

                                    WES
                    I've moved on.

                                      TRAVIS
                    You haven't dated anyone in a year.

                    It's hard to find someone you haven't
                    already dated.

      Wes's car snakes through a swarm of PRESS crowded outside
      the senator's gated mansion.


18INT.  WES'S CAR, MOVING - DAY18

      REPORTERS snap photos through the windshield as they pull
      past them and onto the property.  An attractive ASIAN REPORTER

19INT.  SENATOR MACCALLUM'S HOME, STUDY - DAY19

      SENATOR MACCALLUM (late 50s, stately) paces.  Travis and Wes
      sit on a sofa, taking notes.  The senator is devastated but
      doing his best to hold it together.  

                                      SENATOR MACCALLUM
                    It's not like I hadn't imagined this
                    a thousand times...
                          (beat)
                    Tobey's an addict.  Has been for
                    years.  He hit rock bottom in June
                    and finally agreed to treatment.
                    He'd been living at the facility
                    ever since.

                                    WES
                    We'll need the name of the facility.

                                      SENATOR MACCALLUM
                    Sober House West.  

                                      TRAVIS
                    When's the last time you talked to
                    Tobey?  

                                      SENATOR MACCALLUM
                    Three days ago.  Zach and I visited
                    him on Family Day at the Sober House. 

                                      TRAVIS
                    Zach?

                                      SENATOR MACCALLUM
                    Tobey's younger brother, my other
                    son.  

    He gestures to a framed PORTRAIT of the two boys when they
      were young in happier times on his desk.  

                                      TRAVIS
                    Where is Zach?  Can we speak with
                    him?

                                      SENATOR MACCALLUM
                    He went for a drive.  He does that
                    when he gets upset.  Last time he
                    saw Tobey, they got in a fight.  Not
                    the way you want to remember saying
                      "good-bye."  

                                      TRAVIS
                    What was the fight about?      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1020.
 

                                      SENATOR MACCALLUM
                    Tobey said he needed money.  Zach
                    assumed it was for drugs.  Tobey got
                    mad that Zach didn't trust him, but
                    we were told to cut him off at the
                      intervention.

      The senator drops into a chair, destroyed by guilt.

                                      SENATOR MACCALLUM (CONT'D)
                    Tobey was a hard person to love.  He
                    was high the entire year his mother
                    was dying of cancer.  He didn't even
                    make it to her funeral.

      The SENATOR's AIDE enters.

                                    AIDE
                    Sorry to interrupt, senator.  The
                    press conference is about to start.

      Wes and Travis stand.

                                    WES
                    We'll get out of your way.

                                      TRAVIS
                    First, can you tell us:  Was Tobey
                    an Eagle Scout?

                                      SENATOR MACCALLUM
                    No.  But Zach was.  Why?

      The guys exchange curious looks.

                                    WES
                    An Eagle Scout knife was found at
                    the scene.  We believe it was the
                    murder weapon.

      That surprises the senator.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Do you know where Zach was last night?

                                      SENATOR MACCALLUM
                    You're not suggesting Zach is a
                    suspect in his brother's murder?  

                                    WES
                    This is all just preliminary, sir.       Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1021.
 

                                      SENATOR MACCALLUM
                    Zach was here studying.  I went to
                    bed at eleven, and he was still
                    working when I got up at six.

                                      TRAVIS
                    That's a lot of homework.

                                      SENATOR MACCALLUM
                    Zach has dyslexia.  It takes him
                    longer to tackle material. 

      Travis hands the senator his business card.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Let us know when you hear from him,
                    will you?  We'll need to talk to
                    him.

      The senator takes the card.  Wes sees the depth of grief in
      the senator's eyes.  He's a broken man.


20EXT.  SENATOR MACCALLUM'S HOME, STUDY - DAY20

      Wes and Travis head back to Wes's car. 

                                      TRAVIS
                    Zach's on the run.

                                    WES
                    You don't know that.

                                      TRAVIS
                    We should call in an APB.

                                    WES
                    If we call in an APB, the press will
                    get wind, and Zach will be crucified
                    before he ever gets a chance to defend
                    himself.

                                      TRAVIS
                    OK, but we're going to look awfully
                    stupid when our prime suspect tweets
                    about his escape from the country.

                                    WES
                    I didn't say we shouldn't find him. 
                    I just said I don't want to make it
                    public.  Let's have ITC triangulate
                    Zach's cellphone signal.  And he's
                    not our prime suspect.  He's a
                    suspect, a person of interest.        Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1022.
 

                                      TRAVIS
                    Who got in a fight with the victim,
                    owned an Eagle Scout knife, and
                    conveniently disappeared.  You say,
                      "potay-toe" and I say, "potah-toe."

                                    WES
                    It's "tomay-toe" and "tomah-toe."

                                      TRAVIS
                    Whatever. 


21EXT.  SOBER HOUSE WEST - DAY21

      Wes's car pulls through the gates and up the long driveway
    to this swanky house in the Hollywood Hills.  

    As Wes and Travis park and climb out, the house owner and
      operator, VINCE WEST (early 30s), comes out to greet them
      with MARCUS (30s, corn-fed bruiser).  

                                    WES
                    Detectives Mitchell and Marks. 

      They flash their BADGES.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Who runs this place?

                                      VINCE
                    That'd be me.  Vince West.  This is
                    Marcus Hunter, the house security.

                                    WES
                    You both live here?

                                      VINCE
                    I do.  Marcus doesn't.

                                      MARCUS
                    I only get called in when there's
                    trouble with the residents.  I run
                    security for all the sober houses in
                    the area.  

                                      VINCE
                    I called Marcus as soon as I realized
                    Tobey was missing this morning.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Mind if we look around?      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1023.
 


22INT.  SOBER HOUSE WEST, TOBEY'S BEDROOM - DAY22

      Vince leads the cops in.  The room is neat.  Wes and Travis
      immediately start poking around as they talk.

                                    WES
                    When's the last time anyone saw him?

                                      MARCUS
                    He was in his room at lights out at
                    eleven last night, but he wasn't
                    here this morning.

                                    WES
                    Any idea where he might have gone?

                                      VINCE
                    Usually when people disappear around
                    here, it's because they're using
                    again.  In his case heroin.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Tobey's father mentioned that Tobey
                    got in an argument with his brother
                    recently.

                                      VINCE
                    We're not supposed to disclose what
                    goes down in therapy--

                                      GRETCHEN (O.S.)
                    His brother killed him.

      They turn to find resident GRETCHEN HILLSDALE (22, gorgeous)
      standing in the doorway.

                                      VINCE
                      Gretchen...

      Vince shoots her a look for violating the confidentiality.

                                      GRETCHEN
                    What?  Tobey's dead, and it's Zach's
                    fault.  

      Wes and Travis exchange side-glances, then--

                                    WES
                    What'd they fight about?

                                      GRETCHEN
                    The usual:  money, drugs.  Zach told
                    Tobey he was sick of his crap.  He 
                                      (MORE)      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1024.
 

                                      GRETCHEN (CONT'D)
                    said he wished Tobey would just die
                    and save the family the trouble. 
                    Guess he got what he wanted.


23EXT.  SOBER HOUSE WEST, DRIVEWAY - DAY23

      Wes and Travis head to Wes's car.  

                                    WES
                    It doesn't mean anything.  Emotions
                    run high in therapy sessions.  People
                    sometimes say things they don't mean. 

                                      TRAVIS
                    And people sometimes say exactly
                    what they mean.  Tobey was an
                      embarrassment to the family, and
                    Zach finally snapped. 

      Just then, Wes's phone RINGS.  He answers.

                                    WES
                          (into his phone)
                    Mitchell here...  Yeah?  We'll be
                    right there.

    He hangs up, turns to Travis.

                                    WES  (CONT'D)
                    They found Zach.

                                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

      SWIRLING EMERGENCY LIGHTS spin on top of RESCUE VEHICLES.

      Wes and Travis cut through the police cordon, showing their
      badges to a UNIFORM COP who lets them through.  We are in--


24EXT./INT.  DOWNTOWN FINANCIAL DISTRICT - DAY24

      Wes and Travis make their way into the lobby of a building.

                                      TRAVIS
                    It was almost too easy.  Brother
                    kills brother.  It's classic Cain
                    and Abel.  

                                    WES
                    You do realize how the law works,
                    don't you?  People are innocent until
                    proven guilty.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1025.
 

                                      TRAVIS
                    Remember that the next time you get
                    the urge to pull your gun on me for
                    doing something I didn't do.

      Wes and Travis enter the elevator...


25INT./EXT.  DOWNTOWN SKYSCRAPER - ROOF - DAY25

      ...and exit the elevator onto a ROOFTOP.  L.A.F.D.,
      PARAMEDICS, and cops wait, tense.  

      Travis and Wes cross the roof and finally come to a stop. 
      CAMERA SWEEPS around, revealing the stunning city skyline in
      a panoramic ARC, and then lands on--

      A DESPERATE MAN (20s)

      Standing on the edge of the roof.  About to throw himself 30
      stories down to his death.  The center of all this attention.

      This is ZACH MACCALLUM.  He sees Wes and Travis approaching.

                                    ZACH
                          (edgy, upset)
                    Don't get any closer.  I'll jump!

      Wes and Travis stop.

                                      TRAVIS
                    You're not going to jump.

                                    WES
                    Good idea, Travis.  Dare him to jump.

                                      TRAVIS
                    If he was going to jump, he would
                    have already.

                                    ZACH
                    You don't know me!  You don't know
                    what I've done!  

                                      TRAVIS
                    We know exactly what you've done.

                                    WES
                    Maybe you should let me do the
                    talking.
                          (to Zach)
                    I'm Detective Wesley Mitchell--

                                      TRAVIS
                    --Maybe we should let him decide.        Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1026.
 

      Travis looks to Zach.

                                      TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                    Who do you want to talk to?  Me or
                    him?  I'm Detective Travis Marks.

                                    ZACH
                    I don't want to talk to either of
                    you!

                                      TRAVIS
                    Then, why haven't you jumped yet?

                                    WES
                    Will you shut up?

      Their approach confuses Zach.

                                    ZACH
                    I just wanted to tell my dad I'm
                    sorry first! 

                                    WES
                    Sorry for what?

                                    ZACH
                    My brother's dead because of me!  

      Zach looks down, more resolute than ever about jumping.

                                      TRAVIS
                    You should've picked a higher
                    building.  

                                    WES
                    Travis...

                                      TRAVIS
                    I'm just saying...you could live. 
                    You'd be a vegetable, but--

                                    ZACH
                    --I decided I'd rather talk to him.

      Zach gestures to Wes.  Wes shoots Travis a cocky look.

                                    WES
                    See?  He'd rather talk to me.

      Travis looks around, getting an idea.  He nods and peels
      off, disappearing down the roof access stairwell.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1027.
 

                                    WES (CONT'D)
                    Listen.  You can't jump.  Don't do
                    that to your father.  He'll never
                    get over it.  I know.

                                    ZACH
                    You don't know anything.

                                    WES
                    Trust me.  I do.


26INT.  DOWNTOWN SKYSCRAPER, LOBBY - DAY26

      Travis emerges from the elevator and crosses to a JANITOR
      mopping the floor.  Travis flashes his badge.  

                                      TRAVIS
                    I need your help.


27EXT.  DOWNTOWN SKYSCRAPER - ROOF - DAY27

      Wes edges toward Zach.

                                    WES
                    Look.  Whatever you did, I'm sure
                    your father will forgive you.

                                    ZACH
                    We had a bond.  I should've trusted
                    him.  

                                    WES
                    Who?  

                                    ZACH
                    Tobey!  He said his ex-dealer was
                    going to kill him if he didn't pay
                    him back the $5,000 he owed him.  I
                    didn't believe him.  I thought Tobey
                    was gonna go buy drugs.  I should've
                    given him the money.  Now, he's dead,
                    and it's all my fault... 

      His voice trails off.  Full of despair.

                                    WES
                    So, you didn't kill Tobey?

      That stops Zach.

                                    ZACH
                    Of course, I didn't kill him.  He
                    was my brother.  I loved him.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1028.
 

                                    WES
                    An Eagle Scout knife was found at
                    the scene.  Was it yours?

      Zach reels, confused--

                                    WES (CONT'D)
                    We believe it was the murder weapon.

                                    ZACH
                    I gave my scout knife to Tobey when
                    he graduated rehab.  You gotta believe
                    me.  I didn't kill him.  

                                    WES
                    Well, if you jump, everyone's going
                    to think you did.

    ON ZACH.  Reconsidering, despondent but unsure.

                                    WES (CONT'D)
                    Come on.  Come down from there.  

      Wes takes a step toward him and holds out his hand. 

                                    WES (CONT'D)
                    Your father's had a bad enough day
                    already.

      Zach nods, finally giving in.  

                                    WES (CONT'D)
                    Give me your hand.

      But now that Zach's decided to live, the height is terrifying. 

      He's overcome by vertigo as he shifts his footing and turns
    to face the railing.  His foot slips--Zach DROPS!

      Wes hurries to the railing in horror to see Zach has only
      dropped a few feet into a WINDOW WASHING APPARATUS, which
      rises up, commandeered by Travis who wears a smug smile.

                                      TRAVIS
                    I get credit for this one.

                                    WES
                    You almost made him jump.  I talked
                    him down.

                    He slipped.
                          (to Zach)
                    Tell my partner you slipped.

      Zach just regards the guys, confused.

                                    ZACH
                    You're partners?


28EXT.  DOWNTOWN SKYSCRAPER, VALET - MOMENTS LATER28

      A distraught Zach sits in an ambulance.  EMTs check him over
      while he talks to Wes and Travis.  

                                    WES
                    Can anyone corroborate that you gave
                    Tobey your knife?

                                    ZACH
                    No.  It was a private thing just
                    between us.  Tobey had always made
                    fun of me for being a Boy Scout, so
                    when he graduated rehab, I thought
                    I'd give it to him as a joke.  But
                    he was actually really proud of it. 

                                    WES
                    Any idea who Tobey's drug dealer was?

                                    ZACH
                    No, he would never tell us.  He was
                    afraid if our dad found out, he would
                    try to have him arrested and only
                    make things worse.

                                      TRAVIS
                    We're going to need to get your
                      fingerprints.

      Now, a SEDAN pulls up, and Senator MacCallum climbs out. 

                                    ZACH
                    Am I being arrested?

                                    WES
                    No.  But I suggest you get a lawyer.

      The senator rushes up to his son, and they embrace.

                                      SENATOR MACCALLUM
                    Oh, thank God.  I was so worried.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1030.
 


29EXT.  DOWNTOWN PARKING LOT - DAY29

      Wes and Travis head back to Wes's car. 

                                      TRAVIS
                    Tobey's ex-drug dealer threatened to
                    kill him unless he pays him $5,000? 
                    I don't buy it.    

                                    WES
                    Agreed.  Not many drug dealers out
                    there selling their product on credit. 
                    But Tobey needed the money for
                    something.

      Wes chirps his car unlocked. 

                                      TRAVIS
                    Probably drugs.

      Travis opens the car door--CLUNK!  Wes instantly reacts.

                                    WES
                    Did you just ding my door?

                                      TRAVIS
                    No.

      Wes hurries over to inspect the door.  There is indeed a
      dent.  A tiny dent.

                                    WES
                    You did.  You dinged my door.  

                                      TRAVIS
                    That was already there.

                                    WES
                    It was not.  

                                      TRAVIS
                    You shouldn't park in compact spaces.

      Travis climbs in and slams the door closed on Wes.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

30INT.  L.A.P.D. SOUTH BUREAU, HOMICIDE BULLPEN - DAY30

      Ellen is here, looking at the photos.  There are two desks 
      butted up against each other.  One is tidy; the other is a
      pig-sty.  These are Wes and Travis's desks, respectively. 

      Travis and Wes approach, moving through the bullpen, loudly
      bickering.

                                      TRAVIS
                    You're a control-freak, you know
                    that?

                                    WES
                    You're careless.

                                      TRAVIS
                    You're anal-retentive.

                                    WES
                    You're pig-headed.

                                      ELLEN
                    You guys sound like my parents.

      Travis sits at his desk.  He pulls open a drawer, grabs the
      couples questionnaire, and starts filling in some answers.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1032.
 

                                      ELLEN (CONT'D)
                    What's that?

                                      TRAVIS
                    Couples questionnaire asks for two
                    adjectives to describe your partner. 
                    I was having trouble until just
                    now.

      Ellen glances back at the photographic wall of happy times.

                                      ELLEN
                    I don't get it.  You guys used to be

                    Wes refused to get my coffee order

                    Travis never wipes his feet before
                    he gets into my car.

                    Nobody wipes their feet before they
                    get into a car.

                                    WES
                    Nobody is as finicky about their
                    coffee as you are.

                                      TRAVIS
                    When I get take-out for us, I always
                    get your order right.

                                    WES
                    That's because my order's easy. 

                                      TRAVIS
                    Easy?  You special order everything. 
                    You're the guy who makes the lines

                    I managed to download a list of recent
                    calls off Tobey's busted cellphone's
                    memory card.

      Wes takes the printout and peruses it.

                    Last call Tobey made was at 3:04am
                    on the night he was killed.

                                      ELLEN
                    I tried dialing it; it's disconnected. 

                                    WES
                    See if you can find out how long
                    it's been disconnected and who it
                    used to belong to.

      Travis looks at the printout over Wes's shoulder.

                                      TRAVIS
                    What's 323-698-2675?  Tobey called
                    it multiple times.

                                      ELLEN
                    It belongs to a Dominic Santori. 

                                      TRAVIS
                    Dominic Santori?  Randi used to talk
                    about him.

                    Randi from narcotics?

      Travis stops, caught.  Ellen studies him, realizing--

                    We only went out a couple times.

                    from carbon fiber and Kevlar--

                                      MAN'S VOICE
                    --I've been waiting for that car...

      They turn to find a salesman (DOMINIC SANTORI) approaching.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1036.
 

                                      DOMINIC
                    ...to come in for six months.

                                    WES
                    I've been waiting for it my whole
                    life.

      Dominic grins and holds out his hand.

                                      DOMINIC
                    Dominic Santori.

      Wes shakes his hand.

                                      DOMINIC (CONT'D)
                    We got a black one inside.  It's
                    only a CCR, but it's a sweet ride if
                    you want to give it a whirl.

      Dominic gestures to another EXOTIC SPORTS CAR parked in the
      nearby showroom. 

                                    WES
                    I'd rather take this one out.

                                      DOMINIC
                    Sorry.  It's not street legal yet.
                    We gotta change out its smog system
                    first.  Federal law.

      Wes gives Travis a look, the short-hand of partners--

                                    WES
                    Right, because you can't drive it
                    with an illegal smog system.

      Travis catches on--

                                      TRAVIS
                    Right.  And we wouldn't want him to
                    break any laws.
                          (to Dominic)
                    So.  How much is this car without
                    all the drugs stuffed in it?

                                    WES
                          (annoyed)
                    Travis, I'll do my own negotiating.

      Dominic eyes the guys.

                                      DOMINIC
                    Who the hell are you?      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1037.
 

      They flash their badges.

                                    WES
                    Homicide.  We want to ask you a few
                    questions about Tobey MacCallum.

                                      DOMINIC
                    Never heard of him.

                                    WES
                    Then why did he call you seven times
                    the week before he was murdered. 

      Dominic pulls out his cellphone and punches in a number.

                                      DOMINIC
                    I'm calling my lawyer.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Did he owe you money?

      Dominic ignores him as he waits on his phone.  Travis pulls
      out his gun, but Dominic isn't scared.

                                      DOMINIC 
                    What're you going to do?  Shoot me?

                                      TRAVIS
                    Why not?  I have a gun.  I shoot bad
                    guys.  That's what I do.

                                    WES
                    He's not lying.  He does stupid things
                    all the time.  I'd answer his
                    questions if I were you.

                                      DOMINIC
                    I'm not answering anything.
                          (into his phone)
                    Hey, Larry.  It's Dom...

      Travis trains his gun on the Swedish import.

                                      TRAVIS 
                    The first question is easy.  Why was
                    Tobey calling you?

      Dominic forgets about his cellphone, suddenly more concerned
      about his expensive baby.

                                      DOMINIC
                    Whoa.  Hey!  That's a $700,000 car.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1038.
 

                                    WES
                    He doesn't care.  He'd rather ride
                    the bus.

                                      TRAVIS
                          (low, to Wes)
                    Is the smog system in the front or
                    the back?

                                    WES
                    Back.

      Travis turns his gun to the back-end of the car.

                                      DOMINIC
                          (into his phone)
                    I've got two cops down here...

                                    WES
                          (to Travis)
                    A little bit lower and to the left.

      Travis adjusts his aim.

                                      TRAVIS
                    I'm giving you one more chance.  Did
                    you threaten Tobey's life?

                                      DOMINIC
                          (to Travis)
                    My lawyer wants to know your badge
                    number.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Tell him it's 9-1-1.

      With that, Travis SHOOTS THE CAR--BLAM!  Wes winces.  Dominic
    is apoplectic, shouting into his cellphone.

                                      DOMINIC
                          (into his phone)
                    Crazy cop just shot my car!

                                    WES
                    Sir, please calm down.

      Travis kneels down to assess the damage--WHITE POWDER IS
      SPILLING OUT of the emissions.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Looks like it sprang a leak.

      Dominic looks under the car, sees the powder, and panics.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1039.
 

                                      DOMINIC
                          (into his phone)
                    I'll call you back.

    He closes his phone and turns to the cops.

                                      DOMINIC  (CONT'D)
                    Listen.  I won't press charges for
                    shooting my car if you just leave now.

    As they talk, Travis surreptitiously scoops up a sample of
      the powder and places it in a baggie.

                                    WES
                    It doesn't matter if you want to
                    press charges.  This is a crime scene
                    now.  We have to impound your car as
                    evidence.  I assure you my partner
                    will be prosecuted to the fullest--

                                      DOMINIC
                    --All right.  Fine.  I'll tell you
                    everything I know about Tobey if you
                    just forget about all of this.

      Travis and Wes consider that with a shrug.  OK.

                                    WES
                    How did you know Tobey?

                                      DOMINIC
                    I had nothing to do with his murder. 
                    I wasn't even in town.

                                    WES
                    Why was he calling you?

                                      DOMINIC
                    He needed money.  

                                      TRAVIS
                          (dubious)
                    He asked you for money?

                                    WES
                    Did he say what he needed it for?

                                      DOMINIC
                    No, but he seemed pretty strung-out. 
                    He kept looking back at the car he
                    rolled up in.  Someone was waiting
                    inside, but I couldn't see them--the
                    windows were tinted.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1040.
 

                                    WES
                    What kind of car?

                                      DOMINIC
                    A 1969 Pontiac GTO.  Black with gold
                    flames.  

                                    WES
                    You know your cars.

                                      DOMINIC
                    It's my business.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Did you give Tobey the money?

                                      DOMINIC
                    He's the son of a senator.  I figured
                    it'd be a good idea to have him in
                    my back pocket.  Tobey promised he'd
                    work it off washing cars.  

      The guys regard him, unsure.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Where were you last night?

                                      DOMINIC
                    I was at a car show all day yesterday
                    in Phoenix.  I didn't get home until
                    this morning.  You can check with
                    the airlines.

                                    WES
                    We'll do that.

      Wes and Travis turn to go.  Dominic nervously looks to his
      "leaking" car.

                                      DOMINIC
                    So, you're going to forget about all
                    this, right?

                                    WES
                    We're Homicide.  We don't care about
                    drug dealers.


34EXT.  WILSHIRE BOULEVARD - DAY34

      Wes and Travis head back to Wes's car parked across the
      street.  Wes pulls out his phone.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1041.
 

                                      TRAVIS
                          (sarcastic)
                    Once in a while it feels good to just
                    let the criminal walk.  Especially
                    when we have evidence and everything.

      Travis holds up the baggie of heroin.  Wes dials a number.

                                    WES
                    You shot his car.  That's illegal
                    search and seizure and a lawsuit.
                    We could never arrest him.

                                      TRAVIS
                    So we do nothing?

                                    WES
                          (into his phone)
                    Hey, Randi.  Santori's smuggling the
                    heroin in through his import cars'
                    emissions systems.  We got a sample
                    for your dogs.  They're gonna have a
                    field day...  You're welcome.

      With that, he hangs up.  Travis shrugs.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Sucks we won't get credit for that.


35EXT.  SALVAGE YARD - DAY35

      A graveyard of dismantled and rusting automobile carcasses,
      stacked in rows.  Wes and Travis move down an aisle.

                                      TRAVIS
                    If Tobey's drug dealer owns a classic
                    muscle car, then this is where he'd
                    get the parts.

                                    WES
                    Unless he's heard of eBay.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Ever tried shipping an engine block?

      They hear a footstep.  They both wheel around as--

      A DOZEN MEN ARMED WITH SHOTGUNS and BASEBALL BATS emerge
      from the shadows, leveling their guns at Wes and Travis. 

                                    WES
                    Whoa-whoa-whoa!  Don't shoot!      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1042.
 

      Wes and Travis put their hands up.  Nobody lowers their guns. 
      One scar-faced MAN speaks.

                                      SCARFACE
                    This is private property. 

                                      TRAVIS
                    We're looking for Fat Man.

      Scarface eyes him, wary.

                                      SCARFACE
                    Who's looking?

                                      TRAVIS
                    T-Bone.

      Scarface signals one of his men who peels off and disappears
      into a garage.  Wes gives Travis a side-glance.

                                    WES
                    "T-Bone"?

      The garage door opens, and out steps a huge SAMOAN MAN. 
      He's heavily inked with traditional tattoos.  He sees Travis
      and brightens.

                                    FAT MAN
                    T-Bone!

                                      TRAVIS
                    Fat Man!

                                    FAT MAN
                    My name is Fuamatu-Ma'afala, dickweed.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Watch that mouth, or I'm telling
                    momma.

                                    FAT MAN
                    Momma always said you were a snitch.

      Fat Man pulls Travis into a bear hug.  Everyone watches,
      confused, shotguns still drawn.

                                    FAT MAN (CONT'D)
                    Put your guns down.  This is my foster
                    brother.

      The henchmen all lower their guns.  Fat Man eyes Wes.

                                    FAT MAN (CONT'D)
                    Who's this?      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1043.
 

                                      TRAVIS
                    That's Wes.  He's my partner.

                                    FAT MAN
                          (incredulous)
                    You're gay?

                                      TRAVIS
                    No.  I'm a cop.

      The henchmen all reach for their guns again, but Travis stops
      them with--  

                                      TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                          (quickly)
                    We're just looking for a car.


36INT.  GARAGE - DAY36

      Wes and Travis follow Fat Man through what we realize now is
      a chop shop.  A small crew of GREASY MECHANICS dismantle a
      BMW ROADSTER, pulling off its rims, fenders, dashboard.

                                    FAT MAN
                    I can't believe you're a cop.  Do
                    they know what you used to do?

                                      TRAVIS
                    No, because juvie records are sealed.

      Fat Man moves to a file cabinet as they talk.

                                    FAT MAN
                    You should call mom.  She misses
                    you.

                                      TRAVIS
                    She was only my mom for seven months.  

                                    FAT MAN
                    Only because you went to juvie.

                                    WES
                    What'd he do?

      Fat Man rifles through his files.

                                    FAT MAN
                    You name it...here we go.

      Fat Man pulls out a file and opens it.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1044.
 

                                    FAT MAN (CONT'D)
                    '69 GTO, black with gold flames,
                      numbers-matching 400 motor.  Needed
                    new panel skins.  The owner said
                    it'd been in the family for years.

                                    WES
                    You got a bill or something with the
                    owner's name?

      Fat Man regards Wes like he's an idiot.

                                    FAT MAN
                    We're a cash-only sorta business.

    He passes the file to Travis who opens it.

      CLOSE ON THE FILE.  Inside is a polaroid of the '69 Black
      GTO with Gold Flames.  One thing is clearly legible--

                                      TRAVIS
                    License plate.

      Travis quickly jots down the number.

                                      TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                    Thanks, bro.

      They start to head out.  Fat Man calls after them.

                                    FAT MAN
                    Hey!  Don't forget about Mother's
                    Day!

                                      TRAVIS
                    How could I?  Busiest day of my life!


37INT.  SALVAGE YARD - DAY37

      Wes and Travis head to Wes's car.  Travis is on his cellphone.  

                                      TRAVIS
                          (into his phone)
                    Thanks, Ellen.
                          (hangs up, looks to Wes)
                    GTO's registered to a Clayton Moore,
                    a meth head with convictions going
                    back to the 90s.  I got an address. 

                                    WES
                    Your foster brother's a car thief.

                                      TRAVIS
                    He's a repo man.       Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1045.
 

                                    WES
                    You say, "tomay-toe."  I say "tomah-
                    toe."

                                      TRAVIS
                    I wouldn't say, "tomah-toe" to his
                    face if I were you. 


38EXT.  GARDENA NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY38

      Wes and Travis head down the sidewalk in this low-rent part
    of town.  Bars on the windows.  They come to--


39EXT.  GARDENA BUNGALOW - DAY39

      A small clapboard bungalow.  A car sits parked in the
      driveway, covered by a car cover.  Travis lifts the cover.  
      It's indeed the black GTO with gold flames.

      They share a look.  They draw their guns and split up.

    ON TRAVIS as he quietly walks to the back of the house.

    ON WES.  He moves forward.  Up the porch steps.  Suddenly,
    he hears the sound of a SHOTGUN RACK--CLACK-CLICK!  

      Wes SLAMS himself against the wall.  Ready for a gunshot.

      Silence.  Then he hears the SHOTGUN RACK again--CLACK-CLICK.
      Then again--CLACK-CLICK.

      Wes can't figure it out.  He raises his weapon.  He leaps
      out, SPINS and AIMS at the screen door, yelling--

                                    WES
                    L.A.P.D.!  FREEZE!

      THROUGH THE SCREEN DOOR, we reveal--

      A NEWBORN BABY swinging back and forth in a cheap ROCKER
      with a broken hinge.  With each motion, the hinge creaks
      CLACK-CLICK.  The baby GURGLES.

      OFF Wes, lowering his weapon...


40INT.  GARDENA BUNGALOW - DAY40

      A cramped living room.  Wes and Travis are here with IRENE
      MOORE (20s, ex-junkie) who bounces the FUSSY BABY in her
      arms.  Irene's eyes are red from crying.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1046.
 

                                      IRENE
                    At first, when I found out I was
                    pregnant, I wasn't going to tell
                    Tobey.  It wasn't like we were in
                    love or anything.  We were both high
                    at the time.  And he was just this
                    cute junkie with a nice smile.

      She fights tears.  It's clear that it's hard for her to talk
      about Tobey.  The baby cries in spite of her best efforts. 

                                      IRENE (CONT'D)
                    But I needed money for the medical
                    bills.  The second I told him, Tobey
                    insisted on helping out.  And then
                    when he saw the ultrasound, it was
                    like he became a different person. 
                    He said he finally had something to
                    live for.

                                    WES
                    Why didn't Tobey tell his family
                    about you and the baby?

                                      IRENE
                    He was going to, but he wanted to
                    prove he could stay clean first.  We
                    wanted to get out of here.  He didn't
                    like being around all the drug users. 
                    He'd gotten freaky that way.  We
                    found a place in a better
                      neighborhood, but the landlord was
                    asking for a big deposit.

      The baby continues crying.  Travis reaches for him.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Here.  Let me.

      Irene gratefully passes the baby over.  Travis coos and
      cuddles it as they talk.

                                    WES
                    Who's Clayton Moore?

                                      IRENE
                    My cousin.  He's in prison.  Got his
                    third strike last month.  He won't
                    be coming back this time.

      The baby finally stops crying.  Irene's amazed.  Even Wes
      can't help but be impressed by Travis's soft touch.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1047.
 

                                      IRENE (CONT'D)
                    How'd you do that?

                                      TRAVIS
                    I've had a lot of little brothers
                    and sisters. 

      She smiles and takes the calmed baby back.

                                    WES
                    Do you recognize this number?

      Wes shows her the "323" phone number in his notebook.

                                      IRENE
                    No.

      She sets the baby into its crib and stares at him.

                                      IRENE (CONT'D)
                    What am I going to do?  I don't think
                    I can make it without Tobey.

      She leaves it there.  Holding on to the memory of Tobey, all
      she has left now.  Travis hands her a business card.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Call these people.  Tell them Travis
                    Marks sent you.  They can help.


41INT.  UPSCALE PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY41

      This office is warm, elegant, and tastefully decorated.  A
      FEMALE PATIENT (30s, wealthy) lies on a couch.  Dr. Ryan
      sits at her desk.

                                      FEMALE PATIENT
                    My sister has a new boyfriend.

                                    DR. RYAN
                    And how do you feel about that?

                                      FEMALE PATIENT
                    I'm happy for her, of course.  I
                    mean, he's not unattractive.

                                    DR. RYAN
                    Hmm.

                                      FEMALE PATIENT
                    Hmm?      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1048.
 

                                    DR. RYAN
                    You could have simply said that he's
                      attractive.  

                                      FEMALE PATIENT
                    I did.

                                    DR. RYAN
                    No.  You said he's not unattractive. 
                    That's a highly constructed double-
                    negative.  It usually means there's
                    something going unsaid.  Is there?

      The patient pauses, thinking about that.

                                    DR. RYAN (CONT'D)
                    Think out loud.  Whatever comes to
                    mind. 

                                      FEMALE PATIENT
                    My father always liked my sister
                    more than me.

                                    DR. RYAN
                    What makes you say that?

                                      FEMALE PATIENT
                          (blurts out)
                    OK!  I had sex with with my sister's
                    boyfriend!  But not because I liked
                    him.  It's just, if you knew my sister-- 

      A KNOCK at the door interrupts.  Dr. Ryan checks her watch,
      confused.  She rises and crosses to the door.

                                    DR. RYAN
                          (to her patient)
                    Hold that thought.

      Dr. Ryan opens the door and is surprised to find--

      CAPTAIN SUTTON.  He's holding two thick folders.  

                                    DR. RYAN (CONT'D)
                    Phil.  I'm in a session.

    He sees the patient on the couch.

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    I'm sorry.  I just wanted to drop
                    these off.  

    He tries to hand her the files.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1049.
 

                                    DR. RYAN
                    What are they?

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    Wes and Travis's psych evals.

      She pushes the dossiers away.

                                    DR. RYAN
                    I prefer to get to know my patients
                    through therapy.

      Captain Sutton shoves the files into Dr. Ryan's hands.

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    We don't have time.  I need you to
                    fix them and fast.

      But Dr. Ryan won't take the files.

                                    DR. RYAN
                    You know this process is never "fast." 
                    It's taken us years to get you where
                    you are.

                                      FEMALE PATIENT
                    Years?!  Can't you just give me a
                    pill?

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    Come on, Elyse.  You're the best
                    therapist I know.

                                    DR. RYAN
                    Phil, remember, you have to learn to
                    let people fail.

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    I'm working on it.  Just look at the
                    files.  Please?  They're on a really
                    important case.  Which involves my
                    job.  Which involves my insurance. 
                    Which involves you.

      She can't help but smile at that.  

                                    DR. RYAN
                    Fine.

      She takes the files.  He smiles.

                                    DR. RYAN (CONT'D)
                    See you on Tuesday.

                                                                                  CUT TO:      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1050.

      FADE IN ON:

42EXT.  CHEVIOT HILLS - DUSK42

      The skyscrapers of Century City hang as a backdrop to this
      quaint neighborhood.  Wes stands on the front walk of a white-
      picket-fence house, watering the lawn.

      A LEXUS pulls up, and out climbs a stunning and sophisticated
      WOMAN (30s).  She's wearing a wool-skirted business suit. 
      This is ALEX MCFARLAND.  She sees Wes and sighs.

                                    ALEX
                    What are you doing here?

                                    WES
                    The St. Augustine needs fertilizer.

      Alex moves to the trunk of her car and pops it open.

                                    ALEX
                    You need to get your own lawn.

                                    WES
                    This is my lawn.

      She pulls a briefcase and a box of files out of her trunk. 
      Wes turns off the hose and moves to help her.

                                    ALEX
                    I only agreed to share custody of it
                    because I assumed you'd have your
                    own place by now.  

                                    WES
                    I'm looking.  


43INT.  ALEX'S HOME - DUSK43

      Carrying a box, Wes follows Alex inside this cozy home.

                                    ALEX
                    I think you like living in a hotel.

      She sets her things on a grand piano, which is covered with
      more boxes filled with files.  Wes sets the box down.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1051.
 

                                    WES
                    You shouldn't put all these boxes on
                    the piano.

                                    ALEX
                    When you get your own place, you can
                    have the piano.  Now, what's wrong?

                                    WES
                    What makes you think there's something
                    wrong?

                                    ALEX
                    Well, you didn't come over here for
                    a booty call.

                                    WES
                    I didn't realize that was an option.

                                    ALEX
                    It's not.  Unless you suddenly decided
                    to quit the police force.  Now, come
                    on.  You always obsess over the lawn
                    when something's bothering you. 
                    What is it?  

                                    WES
                    There's this kid.  A good student,
                    promising future.  He's a suspect in
                    his own brother's murder.  I don't
                    think he did it, but I haven't been
                    able to prove it.

                                    ALEX
                    I thought you and Travis were on
                    probation.

                                    WES
                    Captain Sutton put us in couples
                      counseling.  

      That stops Alex.  She regards him, surprised.

                                    ALEX
                    You'd go to couples counseling with
                    Travis, but you wouldn't with me?

                                    WES
                    It's not voluntary, and you and I
                    didn't need therapy.  We knew exactly
                    what our problem was.  You didn't
                    want to be married to a cop anymore.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1052.
 

                                    ALEX
                    No.  I didn't marry a cop.  I married
                    a lawyer.  I can't live my life worrying
                    whether my husband is dead when he
                    doesn't answer his phone right away.

                                    WES
                    I wish I didn't have to be a cop. 

                                    ALEX
                    And I wish you could stop blaming
                    yourself for something that wasn't
                    your fault.  

    As she talks, Wes unconsciously touches the SAINT CHRISTOPHER
      MEDALLION that hangs around his neck.  

                                    ALEX (CONT'D)
                    You were a good lawyer, Wes.

                                    WES
                    People need good cops more than they
                    need good lawyers.  Besides, if people
                    need a good lawyer, they've got you.

      They share a look.  It's clear they still love each other.

                                    ALEX
                    You know, maybe this counseling will
                    be good for you.

                                    WES
                    Yeah, maybe.
                          (then)
                    Hey, do you know how did Travis got
                    his name?  

      She regards him, quizzically.

                                    WES (CONT'D)
                    He said he told you.  It's a therapy
                    exercise.  

                                    ALEX
                    The fireman who found him on the
                    station steps named him after a Teddy
                    Bear left in his baby carrier.

      Wes considers that with a smirk.

                                    WES
                    "Travis the Teddy Bear"?       Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1053.
 

                                    ALEX
                    Maybe I shouldn't have told you.

                                    WES
                    No-no.  
                          (devious grin)
                    This is definitely going to bring us
                    closer.  Thanks.

    He turns to go.

                                    WES (CONT'D)
                    I'll pick up some fertilizer for the
                    lawn next time I come by.

      Wes leaves.  Alex watches him go, wistful.


44EXT.  PACIFIC SANDS MOTEL (SANTA MONICA) - NIGHT44

      A BEATER pulls in, and Travis climbs out with a SOCCER BALL. 
    He heads to a motel room, passing a MOUSY HISPANIC MAID (20s,
      full-figured) pushing a cleaning cart.  This is LUNA.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Hey, Luna!

      She turns, and Travis tosses her the ball.  She catches it.

                                    LUNA
                    What is this?

                                      TRAVIS
                          (in Spanish, subtitled)
                    A present for your son.  You said he
                    wants to play soccer this year.

      Luna regards the present, touched.

                                    LUNA
                    Grac as.

                                      TRAVIS
                    De nada!

    He heads off.  Luna calls after him. 

                                    LUNA
                    There's a lady waiting for you in
                    your room.  I let her in.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Is she pretty?      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1054.
 

                                    LUNA
                    The ones who come looking for you
                    always are.

      Travis grins.  That's what he wanted to hear.  He continues
      on.  Luna watches him go.  She clearly has a crush on him,
      but she's too shy to act on it.


45INT.  PACIFIC SANDS MOTEL, MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT45

      A WOMAN (her back to us) waits in this very lived-in motel
      room.  Travis enters, and the woman turns to reveal--

      CINDY LU from Channel Two.  Travis smiles, surprised.

                                      CINDY LU
                    Detective Marks?  

      She holds out her hand.

                                      CINDY LU (CONT'D)
                    Cindy Lu from--

                                      TRAVIS
                    --I know who you are.

      She eyes him flirtatiously.  He eyes her back.

                                      CINDY LU
                    Can I buy you dinner? 

      Travis holds up his bag of take-out from Hank's Hoagies.

                                      TRAVIS
                    I already got dinner.

                                      CINDY LU
                    I love Hank's Hoagies.  Wanna share? 

                                      TRAVIS
                    Sorry, Cindy.  I don't share with
                    reporters.

      She gives him a sexy, pouty look.

                                      CINDY LU
                    Really?  Because...if you share with
                    me, I'll supply the dessert.

      She unbuttons her top blouse button suggestively.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Normally, I love being used by hot
                    women...      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1055.
 

      She unbuttons another button.  This is killing Travis.

                                      TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                    ...but I can't divulge any details
                    about the MacCallum case.

      Her smile fades.  

                                      TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                    Still want a bite of my hoagie?

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      FADE IN ON: 

46INT.  MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE, CORRIDOR - MORNING46

      Travis and Wes talk as they walk down the corridor.

                                      TRAVIS
                    So, I think I pretty much have this
                    all figured out.  

                                    WES
                      I seriously doubt that.

                                      TRAVIS
                    There's only one thing that's got me
                    stumped...

    He pulls the couples profile out of his back pocket.

                                      TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                          (reads)
                    "Question 13:  Which one of my
                    partner's physical features is he or
                    she least happy with?"

      Wes rolls his eyes.

                                    WES
                    Let's try to stay focused.  We have
                    a case to solve...
                          (pointedly)
                    ...Travis the Teddy Bear.

      Travis shrugs.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1056.
 

                                      TRAVIS
                    I made that up.

                                    WES
                    Nice try. 

      They reach a lab entrance.  Travis stops.

                                      TRAVIS
                    You go in.  I'll wait out here.

      Now, Wes stops to regard Travis, realizing--

                                    WES
                    You dated the coroner.

                                      TRAVIS
                    It was just a one-night thing.

                                    WES
                    Let me guess.  You didn't call her
                      afterwards.

                                      TRAVIS
                    She scares me.  She knows 100 ways
                    to kill a man and get away with it.

                                    WES
                    This is why you don't date people at
                    work.  Now, come on.


47INT.  MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE - DAY47

      The cold, sterile tiles and metal exam tables stand in
      contrast to the hot pathologist, JONELLE (30s), who's cutting
      into a body.  It's TOBEY MACCALLUM.  

      Wes and Travis enter.  Jonelle doesn't look up.  

                                      JONELLE
                    My report's not done yet.

                                    WES
                    Any preliminary results?

                                      JONELLE
                    Yes.

      But that's all she says.  She shoots Travis a dirty look and
      then continues to work.  Wes eyes Travis balefully and then
      turns to Jonelle, clearing his throat.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1057.
 

                                    WES
                    Listen, if you had to kill Travis,
                    how would you do it?  I mean,
                    hypothetically.  Because I've been
                    thinking about it a lot.

      She pulls out Tobey's LIVER and sets it in a scale. 

                                    WES (CONT'D)
                    I figure I could strangle him, then
                    hang him, and make it look like
                    suicide.

                                      JONELLE
                    Yeah, but your best bet is poisoning: 
                    insulin or potassium chloride. 
                      Undetectable.

      She weighs the liver and makes a notation as she talks.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Hey, I'm right here.

      They ignore him.

                                      JONELLE
                    But the safest way would be to leave
                    no corpse behind.

                                    WES
                    You're right.  Vat of acid.

      She starts slicing the liver in a meat cutter.  Travis watches
      her, unnerved.

                                      JONELLE
                    Or chop him up and feed him to the
                    sharks--

                                      TRAVIS
                    OK!  I should've called!  I'm a jerk.

      Wes and Jonelle both look to Travis, surprised.

                                      JONELLE
                    Did he just admit he's a jerk?

                                    WES
                    He's in therapy. 

      She eyes Travis.  He shrugs.  It's true.  She peels off her
      gloves, then grabs her report, and reads from it.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1058.
 

                                      JONELLE
                    Multiple stab wounds to the upper
                    quadrant.  Defensive wounds noted on
                    left and right hands.  Left carotid
                    artery was punctured.  Cause of death: 
                    massive hemorrhaging.  Size and depth
                    of punctures are consistent with the
                    blade of the Eagle Scout knife.

                                    WES
                    What about Tobey's tox screen?

      She flips a page.

                                      JONELLE
                          Diacetylmorphine--positive.

      Wes and Travis reel at the revelation. 

                                      TRAVIS
                    Tobey was using heroin again.

                                    WES
                    Any indication how long ago Tobey
                    relapsed?

                                      JONELLE
                    I could only find one recent
                    subcutaneous injection.

      She points to a spot on Tobey's arm:  an INJECTION MARK on
      his upper arm, far from the older track marks on his forearms.

                                    WES
                    That's not where he usually shot up.

                                      TRAVIS
                    He was probably looking for a new
                    vein.

                                      JONELLE
                    That's just it.  The needle never
                    even hit a vein.  The heroin was
                    injected into the muscle tissue.

      That gets Wes thinking.

                                    WES
                    Could he have been forcibly injected?

                                      JONELLE
                    It's possible.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1059.
 

                                      TRAVIS
                    Or maybe Tobey missed the vein because
                    he was interrupted.  By the killer. 

                                    WES
                    If Tobey had heroin, where did he
                    get it?  He gave Irene all the money.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Maybe Tobey stole it.  He was living
                    with a house full of ex-junkies.


48EXT.  SOBER HOUSE WEST, BACK YARD - DAY48

      Residents work in the garden.  Wes and Travis stand over
      Vince and Gretchen who are planting a row of flowers.

                                      VINCE
                    Well, Tobey didn't get it from anyone
                    here.  Marcus conducts random
                    searches.  Residents here aren't
                    even allowed to have cold medicine.
                          (then)
                    Can you hand me the hydrangea?

      Vince points to the wheelbarrow filled with various flowers. 

                                    WES
                    I wouldn't plant the hydrangea there. 
                    It'll give the bamboo white flies. 
                    Plant these.

      Wes hands a couple of potted plants to Vince.  As Vince
      reaches for them, Travis notices TWO CRUDE PRISON TATTOOS on
      Vince's arm.

                                      TRAVIS
                    You did time in prison?

                                      VINCE
                    Two stints for possession--a real
                    motivator to stay sober.  


49EXT.  SOBER HOUSE WEST, DRIVEWAY - DAY49

      Wes and Travis head to Wes's car.  

                                      TRAVIS
                    Any other ideas where Tobey might've
                    gotten the heroin?      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1060.
 

                                    WES
                    None of it makes sense.  If Tobey
                    was using again, Irene would've known.  

                                      TRAVIS
                    What?  You still think someone
                    forcibly injected a heroin addict
                    and then stabbed him?  

                                    WES
                    Yeah, that doesn't make sense either.  

                                      TRAVIS
                    And yet, you still think Zach is
                    innocent.

                                    WES
                    No, I'm just not sure he's guilty. 

      Travis's phone buzzes.  He checks a text message.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Really?  Because Ellen just texted
                    that Zach's fingerprint matched the
                    print on the knife.


50EXT.  L.A.P.D. SOUTH BUREAU, PARKING LOT - DAY50

      A CRUSH OF REPORTERS descends on Wes and Travis as they climb
      out of Wes's car.  The guys push through the throng of
      REPORTERS, which includes Cindy Lu.  

                                      CINDY LU
                    Detective Marks!  Is it true Zach
                    MacCallum is a suspect in his
                    brother's murder?

      She shoves the microphone in their faces.

                                    WES
                    No comment!

      Travis and Cindy exchange a look as Wes and Travis slip into
      the building.  Wes doesn't miss it.


51INT.  L.A.P.D. SOUTH BUREAU, LOBBY - DAY51

      Wes and Travis enter.

                                    WES
                    I can't believe you told Cindy Lu
                    that Zach's a suspect.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1061.
 

                                      TRAVIS
                    I can't believe you'd actually think
                    I'd do that. 

                                    WES
                    I saw the way she looked at you. 
                    You're such a big-mouth.  Admit you
                    talked to her.

                                      TRAVIS
                    She came by, but nothing happened.

                                    WES
                    Right.  Just like nothing happened
                    to my door.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Will you forget about your door
                    already?  

                                    WES
                    Apologize for dinging it.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Apologize for calling me a big-mouth.

      They round the corner and run right into CAPTAIN SUTTON.  

      Wes and Travis instantly switch over, acting like they're
      getting along.  Travis fake-laughs at Wes.

                                      TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                    You're so funny!

      The captain eyes them.

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    Good to see you're getting along
                    because the D.A.'s on her way. 


52EXT.  L.A.P.D. SOUTH BUREAU, PARKING LOT - DAY52

      The REPORTERS mob LAURA GOTTESMAN (50s, would rather win
      cases than make friends) as she climbs out of her SUV.  A
      DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S BADGE hangs around her neck.  

      The REPORTERS follow the D.A., hurling questions, as she
      heads toward the station.

                                      REPORTER #1
                    Will the D.A.'s Office be filing
                    criminal charges against Zach
                    MacCallum.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1062.
 

                                      LAURA
                      Investigators are still gathering
                    evidence.

                                      CINDY LU
                    Is it true that the murder weapon
                    was an Eagle Scout knife owned by
                    Tobey MacCallum's brother?

                                      LAURA
                    Who told you that?

                                      REPORTER #2
                    Is the D.A.'s office giving the

      The reporters call after Laura as she slips by--

                                      REPORTER #3
                    Anyone else's son would've been
                    arrested by now!


53INT.  L.A.P.D. SOUTH BUREAU, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY53

      Laura storms in to find Wes, Travis, and the captain waiting
      for her.  The conference has been prepared for a presentation
    of the MacCallum murder case's evidence.

                                      LAURA
                    My job is hard enough without your
                    department selling off details of
                    this case to the press.

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    Good to see you too, Laura.

                                      LAURA
                    You don't care that you have a leak?

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    How do you know it's not someone in
                    your office?

                                      LAURA
                    Because the people in my office are
                      professional, or they're fired.

      She looks pointedly at Wes and Travis and then--

                                      LAURA (CONT'D)
                    Why are you two here?  

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    I put them on the case.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1063.
 

                                      LAURA
                      I specifically asked for Santanova
                    and Gooden.

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    Laura, sometimes you're your own
                    worst enemy.  You're up for re-
                    election.  You need this case solved. 
                    Mitchell and Marks are the best
                    detectives in the department.  Now,
                    sit down, and listen to what they
                    have to say. 

      She sits, stewing.  

                                      LAURA
                    Fine.  Let's hear it. 
                          (to Wes and Travis)
                    Have you solved the case?

      Travis and Wes exchange nervous looks.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Well, we're working on a theory--

      Travis slides the case file to Laura.

                                    WES
                    --which is one of many.

      The captain shoots the guys a look.  They shift uncomfortably
      under his glare.  Laura peruses the file.

                                      LAURA
                    Did the print on the Eagle Scout
                    knife match Zach's print or not?

                                      TRAVIS
                    Yes--

                                    WES
                    --but Zach's already admitted it was
                    his knife.  He said he gave it to Tobey
                    as a gift when he got out of rehab.

                                      LAURA
                    Well then, let's just take his word
                    for it.

      Something in the file catches Laura attention.

                                      LAURA (CONT'D)
                    It says here that you have a witness
                    to a threat on Tobey's life by Zach?      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1064.
 

                                    WES
                    It was more "I wish you would die"
                    than "I'm going to kill you."

                                      LAURA
                    Does Zach MacCallum have an alibi?

                                      TRAVIS
                    He claims he was studying all night
                    long, but he has no corroborating
                    witnesses.

                                      LAURA
                    So, we have means, motive,
                    opportunity, and no alibi.  Why
                    haven't we arrested this guy yet?

                                    WES
                    Because we still have several loose
                    ends.

                                      LAURA
                    Like?

                                    WES
                    Like:  Where did Tobey get the heroin
                    found in his system?  And who did
                    Tobey try to call before he was
                    killed?  The last number he dialed
                    was disconnected.

                                      LAURA
                    Tobey was high.  He was probably
                    trying to call the Easter Bunny. 

                                    WES
                    We don't know where Tobey was killed
                    or even where he went that night.  

                                      LAURA
                    After we arrest Zach, we can
                      interrogate him and find out.

                                    WES
                    If you arrest Zach, it's over.  You'll
                    destroy his life and his father's
                    career.  Just give us two more days
                    to follow up on the loose ends-- 

                                      LAURA
                    --I'm already being accused of giving
                    the senator preferential treatment.
                    I can't afford to give him any more.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1065.
 

      She closes the case file.  She's made her decision.

                                      LAURA (CONT'D)
                    I'm issuing an arrest warrant for
                    Zach MacCallum.

                                    WES
                    You can't make an arrest because
                    you're being pressured by the media. 

      Laura simmers.  Travis talks low to Wes.

                                      TRAVIS
                    I think you should shut up now.

                                    WES
                    No, you're the one who should shut
                    up.  If you hadn't leaked any of
                    this to the press, they wouldn't be
                    pressuring the D.A. for an arrest.

                                      TRAVIS
                          (between his teeth)
                    I told you I didn't leak anything to
                    the press.

                                      LAURA
                          (to the captain)
                    May I have a word with you, please?


54INT.  L.A.P.D. SOUTH BUREAU, CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - DAY54

      The MacCallum case file is thrown down on the captain's desk.

                                      LAURA
                    I want those two off this case, and
                    Detectives Santanova and Gooden on
                    like I originally asked you.

                    They're just asking for two days.

                                      LAURA
                    I can't have my detectives questioning
                    me or each other in court.

                                      CAPT. SUTTON

                                      TRAVIS
                    Way to get us kicked off the case. 
                    Now, Beth and Nora are going to get
                    all the credit.

                                    WES
                    What are you--upset you're not going
                    to get your picture in the paper so
                    you can hit on another reporter?

                    You don't run this department.

                                      LAURA
                    If you're not going to take them off
                    the case, then I'm going over your
                    head.

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    No, you're not.  Because I'm President
                    of the Police Union, and in the last
                    twelve elections, the candidates the
                    union endorsed for D.A. won.

      That stops Laura.

                                      LAURA
                    When did you become president? 


57INT.  L.A.P.D. SOUTH BUREAU, HOMICIDE BULLPEN - DAY57

      CLERKS and COPS (including Beth and Nora) stop to listen as
      Wes's and Travis's voices rise in the conference room.

                                    WES (O.S.)
                    You know what your problem is?

                                      TRAVIS (O.S.)
                    Yeah.  I'd love to hear what my
                    problem is from you.

                                    WES (O.S.)
                    Your mother abandoned you!

                                      TRAVIS (O.S.)
                    You don't know anything about my
                    mother!

58INT.  L.A.P.D. SOUTH BUREAU, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY58

                                    WES
                    It's why you hit on anything that
                    breathes.  You're starved for
                    attention.  

      Travis stands there, apoplectic.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Oh yeah?  Really?  Well, maybe if
                    you had been a better lawyer, that
                    kid wouldn't have killed himself.

      That stops Wes.  They both have crossed the line.  They stand
      there, in a smoldering stare-down.


59INT.  L.A.P.D. SOUTH BUREAU, HOMICIDE BULLPEN - DUSK59

      The sudden silence is unnerving.  The eavesdropping cops and
      clerks exchange anxious looks.

                    Now, just relax.  They're in couples

                    Couples counseling?  Are you serious?

                    They're getting much better--

      Just then--CRASH!


61INT.  L.A.P.D. SOUTH BUREAU, HOMICIDE BULLPEN - DUSK61

      The glass wall looking into the conference room SHATTERS as
      Wes and Travis smash through it and tumble into the bullpen,
      hands at each others' throats!

      The captain and Laura rush out of the captain's office to
      find the duo locked in battle. 

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    Hey!  Break it up!

      But the guys aren't listening.  They hurl each other over a
      desk, sending books and papers scattering, and then tumble
    to the floor, neither letting up.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1068.
 

      Beth, Nora, and the other cops jump in to pull and then hold
      the guys apart.   

                                      TRAVIS
                    That's it.  We're done!

                                    WES
                    You don't get to decide when we're
                    done!  I decide!  And we're done!

      Wes pulls himself from the cops and storms out.  Travis yells
      after him.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Great!  Finally!  Thank you!

      Travis storms out in the opposite direction.  The captain
      just gapes, stunned.  Beth grins.

                                    BETH
                    If I didn't know any better, I'd say
                    those two are in love.

62INT.  VICEROY HOTEL, CAMEO BAR - SANTA MONICA - NIGHT62

      Swanky hotel lounge.  Wes watches the news of Zach's arrest,
      which plays on a flatscreen that hangs over the bar.

    ON THE SCREEN, the distraught senator watches as police load
      his handcuffed son into a police car.  The footage cuts to
      Cindy Lu, who interviews Beth.

                                      CINDY LU (ON T.V.)
                    I'm standing here with Detective
                    Beth Santanova, one of the lead
                    detectives on the MacCallum murder
                    case, with an exclusive update...

      Beth smiles flirtatiously at Cindy Lu.

                                    BETH (O.S.)
                    Well, Cindy, while I can't divulge
                    too many details, I can say that we
                    have a very strong case...      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1069.
 

      Wes shakes his head, realizing--

                                    WES
                          (to himself)
                    Beth was the leak.

    He grabs his beer and heads to a grand piano.  He sits and
      starts to play.  He's good.

                                    DR. RYAN (O.S.)
                    Do you take requests?

      Wes looks up to find Dr. Ryan.  He doesn't stop playing.

                                    WES
                    You make house calls?

                                    DR. RYAN
                    The captain asked me to check on
                    you.  See if I can help.

                                    WES
                    And what makes a double divorc e
                    such an expert on partnerships?

                                    DR. RYAN
                    You ran a background check on me?

                                    WES
                    I'm a detective.  That's what I do.

                                    DR. RYAN
                    I know.  I also know why you quit
                    law to become a detective, why you
                    got a divorce, and why you're still
                    living in a hotel nine months later.

      Wes stops playing for a beat, realizing--

                                    WES
                    The captain gave you my personnel
                    file?

                                    DR. RYAN
                    Travis's too.  Did you know he was
                    raised in eight different foster
                    homes?

                                    WES
                    So, why aren't you bothering him?

                                    DR. RYAN
                    Because I knew you'd be alone.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1070.
 

      Wes turns back to the piano, trying to ignore her.

                                    DR. RYAN (CONT'D)
                    You know, you two are a lot alike. 
                    You both live your lives with few
                    emotional attachments.  You live in
                    a hotel; he lives in a motel.  

                                    WES
                    Look.  You can tell the captain you
                    tried, but it's over.  We're done.

                                    DR. RYAN
                    You want to hear my theory on what
                    makes a lasting partnership?

                                    WES
                    No.

                                    DR. RYAN
                    You don't have to like the same
                    things; you just have to hate the
                    same things.  And you and Travis
                    both hate injustice.  You both chose
                    police work for a reason.  You guys
                    could've chosen anything.  Your I.Q.s
                    are off-the-charts.  But you both
                    want to be in Homicide where you
                    think you can make a difference.

                                    WES
                          (surprised)
                    Travis has a high I.Q.?

                                    DR. RYAN
                    Like I said.  You're a lot alike.
                    It's why you fight.  You're like
                    brothers.

                                    WES
                    Brothers aren't always alike. 
                    Sometimes one has zero coping skills
                    and becomes a heroin addict while
                    the other overcomes dyslexia and
                    becomes an Eagle Scout... 

      His voice drifts off.  He stops playing piano and stares at
      her, an epiphany.

                                    WES (CONT'D)

                    It's a neurobiological condition
                    that is genetic in origin, yes.

    He stands abruptly.

                                    WES
                    I'm glad we had this talk.

                                    DR. RYAN
                    You are?

                                    WES
                    Yes.  Thanks!  I have to go.

      With that, Wes rushes out, leaving Dr. Ryan befuddled.


63INT.  PACIFIC SANDS MOTEL, MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT63

      Travis and Ellen drink champagne out of plastic cups on his
      bed.  The room looks really lived in.  Ellen soaks it in.

                                      ELLEN
                    Have you ever thought about living
                    in a real house?

      Travis answers by kissing her and whispering--

                                      TRAVIS
                    You know what would be really hot?

                                      ELLEN
                    Doing this on a bed you actually
                    owned?

      The moment is interrupted by a POUNDING on the door.  Travis
      hops up out of bed and peeks out the window.  It's Wes.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Go away!


64EXT.  PACIFIC SANDS MOTEL, PARKING LOT - NIGHT64

      Wes yells through the motel room door.

                                    WES
                    I got a new lead on Tobey MacCallum's
                    murderer.

                                      TRAVIS (O.S.)
                    We broke up, remember?      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1072.
 

      INTERCUT WES and TRAVIS.  Travis returns to his business
      with Ellen.  

                                    WES
                    I need your help!

      That stops Travis mid-grope.  He looks to Ellen.

                                      TRAVIS
                    What did he just say?

                                      ELLEN
                          (irked)
                    I don't know.  I wasn't paying
                    attention.

      Travis calls to the door.

                                      TRAVIS
                    What did you just say?!

                                    WES
                    I need your help!

      Curious, Travis gets up, but Ellen stops him.

                                      ELLEN
                    Travis, it's our two-week anniversary. 
                    You promised.

      She seductively pulls down the straps of her dress.  Unable
    to resist, Travis grabs her.  They fall onto the bed.

                                    WES (O.S.)
                    Tobey was dyslexic!

      That stops Travis again.  He rises and crosses to the door.

                                      ELLEN
                    If you open that door, I'm leaving,
                    and I swear I'm not coming back.

      Travis stands at the closed door, weighing his options.

                                    WES (O.S.)
                    I think he transposed the digits in
                    that disconnected telephone number.

      Now, Travis finally opens the door, revealing Wes.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Now look who's starved for attention.

      Ellen grabs her purse and pushes past them.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1073.
 

                                      ELLEN
                          (to Travis)
                    I hope Wes embroidered your name on
                    his new black panties for you.

      With that, she leaves.  Travis watches her go, crushed by
        what-could-have-been.  He turns to Wes.

                                      TRAVIS
                    She had my name embroidered on her
                    new panties.

                                    WES
                    You were about to break up with her
                    anyway.

                                      TRAVIS
                    I was not.

                                    WES
                    It's been two weeks.  You've never
                    dated any girl longer than two weeks.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Yes, I have.

                                    WES
                    Who?

      Travis considers that, realizing--

                                      TRAVIS
                    Ellen was starting to hint about
                    moving in together.

                                    WES
                    You see?  I did you a favor.

      Travis grabs his shoes and starts putting them on.

                                      TRAVIS
                    For the record, I didn't leak anything
                    to the press.

                                    WES
                    I know.  Cindy Lu's bi.

                                      TRAVIS
                          (surprised)
                    Really?  

                                    WES
                    Or maybe she just is when she wants
                    info.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1074.
 

                                      TRAVIS
                          (kicking himself)
                    I can't believe I passed that up.

                                    WES
                    Come on.  We need to borrow Randi's
                    dog.

    As they head to Wes's car--

                                      TRAVIS
                    Why?

                                    WES
                    I had ITC run the number through all
                    combinations of digits, then cross-
                    referenced those with currently
                    working numbers.  Guess what number
                    came up?  Marcus Hunter.

                                      TRAVIS
                    The guy who runs security for the
                    sober house? 

                                    WES
                    Irene said Tobey couldn't stand anyone
                    doing drugs around him.

                                      TRAVIS
                          (catching on)
                    Tobey caught someone using at the
                    sober house and tried to call Marcus
                    to report them.

                                    WES
                    But he got killed before he could.

                                      TRAVIS
                    We should call Marcus.

                                    WES
                    Already did.  He's meeting us at the
                    sober house.


65EXT.  DETECTIVE RANDI FLETCHER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD - NIGHT65

      Travis and Wes lead Randi's K-9, Hudson, out of the gate.

                                    WES
                    Shouldn't we knock on the door and
                    ask Randi if this is OK?      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1075.
 

                                      TRAVIS
                    It's not gonna be OK.  She never lets
                    anyone borrow her dog, especially me.

      Hudson wags his tail, happy to see Travis.  Hudson licks his
      face.  Travis eats it up.

                                      TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                          (in baby talk to Hudson)
                    She was always jealous of us, wasn't
                    she?


66INT.  SOBER HOUSE WEST, FOYER - NIGHT66

      Marcus stands at the door with Wes, Travis, and Hudson.

                                      MARCUS
                    So, who's using?  

                                    WES
                    First you need to give us permission
                    to let our drug-sniffing dog enter.

                                      VINCE  (O.S.)
                    No, that dog can't enter.

      They turn to see Vince has emerged from the back.

                                      VINCE  (CONT'D)
                    That'd be an intrusion on my
                    residents' rights.  I'm running a
                    business here.

      Marcus eyes Vince, suddenly suspicious.

                                      MARCUS
                    Yes, and under the conditions of
                    your operating permit, as house
                    security, I have the right to subject
                    anyone and anything to a search if I
                    suspect drug use.
                          (to Wes and Travis)
                    Come on in.

      Marcus steps aside, letting the guys and Hudson in.

                                      VINCE
                    This is ridiculous.

      Hudson sniffs all around them and quickly gets a bead on a
      scent.  He takes off, and everyone takes off after him.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1076.
 


67INT.  SOBER HOUSE WEST, VARIOUS - NIGHT67

    We FOLLOW Hudson as he moves down the hall.  Other residents
      emerge from their rooms, having awakened to the commotion.

                                      GRETCHEN
                    What's going on?

      Hudson disappears into a room at the end of the hall--


68INT.  SOBER HOUSE WEST, VINCE'S ROOM - NIGHT68

      Hudson moves quickly to a spot in the wood floor and lies
      down.  Wes crosses to the spot and uses his pen to pry up a
      loose floorboard, revealing--

      A SECRET DOPE STASH!

                                      MARCUS
                    Heroin?

      Wes tastes the powder and nods.  Everyone reacts, stunned.

                                    WES
                    Whose room is this?

                                      GRETCHEN
                    Vince's.

    We now notice that VINCE IS NOT HERE.

                                      MARCUS
                    Where's Vince?

      Wes looks around.  Travis is gone too.

                                    WES
                    Where's Travis?

      Now, we hear an ENGINE fire up outside.


69INT.  SOBER HOUSE VAN - NIGHT69

      Vince throws the gear into reverse and floors it.


70EXT.  SOBER HOUSE WEST, DRIVEWAY - NIGHT70

      The residents and Wes emerge from the house to see the Sober
      House van speeding down the driveway!  Not far behind--

      Wes's car gives chase. In the driver's seat is Travis.  Wes
      sprints after his car as it speeds by.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1077.
 


71INT.  WES'S CAR, MOVING - DAY71

      Wes pulls open the passenger side door and jumps in.  Travis
    is at the wheel.

                                    WES
                    Who said you could drive my car?!


72EXT.  STREETS OF THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS, VARIOUS - NIGHT72

      Travis and Wes are in pursuit of Vince in the van.  They
      round a corner at top speed.


73INT.  WES'S CAR, MOVING - DAY73

                                    WES
                    Whoa, slow down!

                                      TRAVIS
                    We're in a high speed pursuit and
                    you want me to slow down?!

      But Wes ignores him and grips the oh-shit handle as Travis
      downshifts and whips around a corner.  The engine screams.

                                    WES
                    You're in the wrong gear!  You're in
                    the wrong gear!

                                      TRAVIS
                    You've got control issues, you know
                    that?


74EXT.  STREETS OF THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS, VARIOUS - NIGHT74

      Vince's van blows through a red light, narrowly missing
      several cars, which crash all around him. 


75INT.  WES'S CAR, MOVING - DAY75

      Travis swerves in and out of the crashing cars, narrowly
      missing one, which tears off a side mirror.

                                      TRAVIS
                    That was close!

      Wes glares at him.

                                    WES
                    You better hope you die in this car
                    chase!      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1078.
 

      With the van in his sights, Travis suddenly floors it and
      RAMS Wes's car into the van!  


76EXT.  STREETS OF THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS, VARIOUS - DAY76

      Both cars come to a crashing stop, shattering glass and
      crumpling metal. 

      Vince staggers out of his wrecked van and makes a break for
      it, but Travis jumps out too, tackles him to the ground, and
      slaps on handcuffs.

                                      TRAVIS
                    You're under arrest.

    It takes Wes longer to get out of the passenger side.  The
      door finally opens and FALLS OFF.  Wes surveys the damage. 
      Smoke streams from the hood.  Wes gapes, heartbroken.  

                                      TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                    You okay?

                                    WES
                    I don't want to talk about it.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Look.  If it'll make you feel any
                    better...I'm sorry I dinged your car
                    door before.


77INT.  SOBER HOUSE WEST, TOBEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT77

      CLOSE ON the blue LUMINOL spot where a pool of blood was
      cleaned up recently.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Tobey was killed in here.

      The police work the aftermath.  Wes and Travis study the
      blood pattern on the floor.

                                    WES
                    Tobey walked in on Vince, caught him
                    using...

    As Wes talks, we FLASH TO--

      VINCE'S ROOM.  Vince is shooting up.  Tobey walks in.

                                    WES (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Tobey went back to his room and tried
                    to call Marcus...      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1079.
 

      TOBEY'S ROOM.  Tobey finds his phone and punches in the number
      that's printed on a YOU-NARK flyer posted on the wall.

                                      TRAVIS (O.S.)
                    Vince chased him.  He'd had already
                    done time in prison.  He had two
                    strikes.  One more conviction for
                      possession, and he was going back to
                    prison for life.  He stopped Tobey
                    by stabbing him with the only weapon
                    he had--a hypodermic of heroin...

      Vince rushes in, sees Tobey on the phone, and STABS HIM IN
      THE ARM with his needle.  Tobey drops his phone.

                                    WES (O.S.)
                    Tobey fought back.  He went for the
                    Eagle Scout knife that Zach had given
                    him to protect himself...

      Woozy, Tobey fumbles for his KNIFE in his nightstand.

                                      TRAVIS (O.S.)
                    But Tobey'd been clean for two months,
                    so the heroin hit him hard.  Vince
                    easily got the better of him and
                    stabbed him with his own knife...

      Tobey wheels around with his knife, but Vince overpowers him
      and kills him with it.  Tobey collapses, blood pouring out.

                                    WES (O.S.)
                    Vince transported the body in the
                    sober house van, dumped it and the
                    knife on Fulton Street...

      FLASH TO--

      FULTON STREET.  Vince wipes the knife clean and tosses it
      out of the van.  He pushes Tobey's body out next. 

                                    WES (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    ...because he knew it was where Tobey
                    went to score when he was desperate.

    We FLASH to the present to find we're back outside--


78EXT.  SOBER HOUSE WEST, DRIVEWAY - NIGHT78

      Wes and Travis examine more Luminol bloodstains inside the
      the back of the wrecked van.  Captain Sutton and Laura are
      here now too.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1080.
 

                                    WES
                    We're awaiting confirmation, but
                    we're fairly confident the chemical
                      fingerprint of the heroin found in
                    Tobey's system will match that found
                    hidden in Vince's room.

      Laura watches as Vince is loaded into a police car.

                                      LAURA
                    I guess I have to go face the press
                    now and tell them I made a mistake.

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    That's a very bad idea.  Let me help
                    you.

                                      LAURA
                          (suspicious)
                    Why would you want to do that?

                                      CAPT. SUTTON
                    Because you're a good D.A., and I
                    want you to win this election.  So
                    here's what you say--

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      CLOSE ON LAURA, who gives a statement to the crowd of PRESS.

                                      LAURA
                    ...And so we had Detectives Beth
                    Santanova and Nora Gooden make a
                    decoy arrest of Zach MacCallum...

    We WIDEN to reveal we're on--


79EXT.  COUNTY JAIL - DAWN79

      The media crowds the steps to the jail.

                                      LAURA
                    ...in order to lure our suspect Vince
                    West into a false sense of security
                    so that Detectives Wes Mitchell and
                    Travis Marks could gather further
                    evidence without constraint.  I want
                    to applaud the fine work of the
                    detectives--

      But suddenly there's a commotion as the jailhouse doors
      finally open.  All heads turn as ZACH WALKS OUT with his
      father.  Cameras FLASH!  The senator hugs his son.        Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1081.
 

    As Wes watches the emotional reunion, he absently touches
      his Saint Christopher's necklace.

      After a long hug, Zach moves to the podium and addresses the
      media.

                                    ZACH
                    My brother battled addiction for
                    most of his life, but for the last
                    two months, he was clean.  He had
                    not relapsed as had been rumored.  I
                    was guilty of believing it myself. 
                    I realize now that my brother tried
                    to do the right thing and lost his
                    life for it.  Tobey MacCallum was a
                    hero.  I am proud of him.  And I
                    love him.

      More FLASHES as the media swarms him.  We--

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

80INT.  APARTMENT - MORNING80

      M.O.S.:  Irene hurries to her front door, holding her baby.

                    new you learned about your partner
                    this week?

      Irene opens the door to reveal Wes and Travis.  They've
      brought a couple guests--

      SENATOR MACCALLUM and ZACH.  The senator's eyes well at the
      sight of the baby.

                                    DR. RYAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Wes, Travis...

      Irene smiles and hands the senator his grandson.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1082.
 


81INT.  CULVER CITY COMMUNITY CENTER, MEETING ROOM - DAY81

      We're back in group therapy.  Travis and Wes are here as are
      the other couples from the opening.

                                    DR. RYAN
                    ...How about you?  Did you guys learn
                    anything new about each other this
                    week?

      Wes and Travis shift nervously, on-the-spot.

                                    WES
                    I learned that Travis was a car thief
                    who spent time in juvie and doesn't
                    call his mom.

      Clyde pokes Rozelle and talks low--

                                      CLYDE
                    See?  He doesn't call his mom.

                                    WES
                    At least one of them.  He was also
                    named after a teddy bear.

                                      TRAVIS
                    I was not.

                                    WES
                    But he's too embarrassed to admit
                    it.

                                      TRAVIS
                    You think I'd tell Alex the truth? 
                    I knew she'd tell you. 
                          (to the group)
                    It was a joke.

      It's obvious that no one believes him.

                                      DAKOTA
                    Do you still have the teddy bear?

                                      TRAVIS
                          (through his teeth)
                    There was no teddy bear.

                                    DR. RYAN
                    Travis, what about you?  What'd you
                    learn about Wes?      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1083.
 

                                      TRAVIS
                    Besides being gullible?  I learned
                    that his favorite color is blue, his
                    favorite movie is "It's a Wonderful
                    Life," he's obsessed with his lawn--

                                    WES
                          (realizing)
                    --You've been talking to Alex.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Oh, and he has a crazy uncle Bob who
                    he avoids at family reunions.

                                    WES
                    I don't avoid him. 

                                      TRAVIS
                    He doesn't like to talk about it. 
                    Just like the Saint Christopher medal
                    that he wears around his neck.  It
                    was given to him by the last client
                    he had when he was a lawyer...

      Wes's hackles instantly go up.

                                      TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                    It's the reason he became a cop.

                                    WES
                    OK.  You need to stop talking to
                    Alex.

                                      TRAVIS
                    Just because you divorced her, that
                    doesn't make her not my friend.

                                    WES
                    No.  That's exactly what it makes
                    her.

                                      STEVE
                    He's right.  Everyone knows that in
                    a divorce, friends choose sides.

                                      PETER
                    That's a ridiculous rule.

      Peter and Dakota squeeze hands.  Kathy rolls her eyes.

                                      KATHY
                    Get a divorce, and then you can have
                    an opinion on this.      Common Law:  "Pilot" - 4/29/1084.
 

                                    WES
                          (to Travis)
                    You're not Alex's friend, and you're
                    not allowed to talk to her anymore.

                                      TRAVIS
                    So, now, you're telling me who I'm
                    allowed to talk to?

                                    WES
                    No, I'm telling you who you're not
                    allowed to talk to. 

    As they continue bicker, we--

                                                                      SMASH TO BLACK.



                                      THE END.
