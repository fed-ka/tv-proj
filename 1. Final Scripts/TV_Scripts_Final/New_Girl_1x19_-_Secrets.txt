      INT. CECE S APARTMENT. MORNING. (D1)11

      CECE, pulling on a robe and yawning, opens the front door to 
      reveal JESS, in running gear, jogging in place.

                                  JESS
                    You ready to run!? I ve got my 
                    playlist all done. Actually, it s 
                    an audiobook of Diane Keaton s 
                      autobiography. And it is pumping me 
                    up. 

                                  CECE
                          (realizing)
                    I forgot we were supposed to run 
                    this morning, Jess. 

                                  JESS
                    I emailed you three times 
                      yesterday.

                                  CECE
                    I didn t get any of them. Maybe you 
                    typed  g-moil  again.

                                  JESS
                    No more excuses. We have to train. 
                    We had a weird moment and decided 
                    we wanted to be better people and 
                    signed up for a charity race and 
                    now we can t get out of it.

                    But why can t we just donate money? 
                    Why do we have to run five miles 
                    first? 

                                  JESS
                          (a beat, then)
                    That s actually a really good point, 
                    but... nope. Come on, let s go.

      Jess pushes her way into the apartment. Cece looks worried.

                    No, Jess, I can t. I m hungover 
                    and... I have to help Masha. She s 
                    having a crisis. She accidentally 
                    ate a cookie because she fell on

                          (with no emotion)
                    I am devastated.

                                  CECE
                    We ll do it tomorrow, I promise.

                                  JESS
                    But--

      Cece hustles a confused Jess out the open door.

                                  CECE
                    Have fun.

      She closes the door. A shirtless SCHMIDT comes out from 
      underneath the cushions on Cece s couch. 

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Close one! I m a quiet breather. I 
                    learned that as a kid from playing

      INT. LOFT. KITCHEN. MORNING. (D1)22

      WINSTON is on the couch in a fetal position. He drinks a cup 
      of tea and stares at the wall. NICK comes out of his room 
      with a college-age girl, LINDSEY. They stand at the door and 
      awkwardly hug good-bye.

                                    LINDSEY
                    Okay, so. You ll call me?

                    I bet you like hiking and I want 
                    you to meet my mom, so this is 
                    good, hmm, this is good... Us. 
                          (then)
                    You know what? I don t really see 
                    this going anywhere, and I m sorry, 
                    you re cool, but I used you for sex 
                    and someone had to say it.

                                    LINDSEY
                    Oh my god. Oh my god. 

      Lindsey leaves. Nick shuts the door. When she s gone:

                                  NICK
                    Okay, so. I don t know how to do 
                    this. I don t know how to sleep 
                    with a bunch of young girls. But 
                    the past couple weeks, I can t stop 
                    hooking up with them. Twenty-year-

                    that I have heartburn and I bought

                          (in a daze)
                    I saw something. A few days ago. 
                    I ve been sworn to secrecy, but 
                    it s just too big--

                                  NICK
                    Okay, I m going to stop you right 
                    there. You know I can t do a secret. 
                    I can t lie. You saw me with that 
                    girl. Just thinking about keeping a 
                    secret turns my lower back into a 
                    slip  n slide.

      Nick starts for his room. Winston grabs his arm.

                                    WINSTON
                    You gotta help me, man, I m dying!

                    thought Cece was stronger... I

      Everyone is sitting at the dining table. Jess is questioning

                    out this way. But, trust me, it 
                    wasn t a big conspiracy, it was 
                    just something that happened and 
                    then it got out of control. Sort of

                    about which end goes on the right

                      Obviously. Because when a lady 
                    spends the night, it is imperative 
                    that you keep track of her personal 
                    effects. I put valuables in plastic

                    Why didn t you tell me you hooked 
                    up with my roommate?

      Nick hesitates. Deep breath. He turns to Willow:

                                  NICK
                    Willow, I didn t call you because I 
                    had a family emergency.

                    And Megan, I didn t tell you about 
                    Willow because you and I shared an 
                      experience that was so beautiful 
                    and intense, for a moment I forgot

                    just got tight.

      EXT. RACE. LATER. (D4)1616

      Jess runs wildly: her limbs are flying and she s weaving all 
      over the road. Up ahead, Cece is jogging comfortably.

                                  JESS
                    Cece! Cee--! I can t breathe.

      Jess puts on a burst of speed and manages to pull even with 
      Cece. Cece, not even breathing hard, looks over at Jess.

                                  JESS (CONT D)
                    I... realized... why you didn t... 
                    tell me about... Schmidt.
                          (then)
                    You... like him.

      Cece stops running, but Jess is running at a walking pace.

                    You... thought the shirt... was

                    the only explanation for 
                      thinking... that was funny.

                                  CECE
                          (hitting Cece)
                    Oh, god. You re right.

                                  JESS
                    And that s why you didn t tell me. 
                    You knew that I would know. And you 
                    weren t ready... to admit that to 
                    yourself.

                                  CECE
                    Can we just say I didn't tell you 
                    because I'm a total bitch? I'm much 
                    more comfortable with that.
                          (a beat, she smiles)
                    I might like Schmidt.
                          (then, dead serious)
                    You cannot tell anyone.

                          (smiling)
                    So it s a secret only I know?

      EXT. FINISH LINE. MUCH LATER. (N4)1717

      Nick, Schmidt and Winston are waiting at the finish line. One 
      half of the street has been re-opened to traffic. The event 
      organizers are packing up the tables and tents. One of the 
      organizers tries to take down the finish line, which is 
      deflating. Winston stares daggers at him until he backs away.

                    Here they come.

      We see Jess, slumped on Cece s shoulder. As the guys hold up 
      the deflating finish line, Jess finishes the race.

      INT. LOFT. KITCHEN. THAT NIGHT. (N4)1818

      Schmidt and Cece make dinner. Cece chops basil.

                                    SCHMIDT
                    What are you doing to that basil-- 
                    trying to make it confess? Easy

                                  CECE
                    I will cut off your weaker fingers, 
                    Schmidt. I will start at the pinky--

                                  JESS (O.S.)
                    You guys are so adorable.

      REVEAL: Jess, sitting at the kitchen island, staring at them. 
      Cece glares at Jess and mouths  Stop it. 

                                    SCHMIDT
                    We re not adorable. We re two people 
                    having casual, successful sex.

                          (covering)
                    Yeah, Jess! Stop it!

                                  JESS
                    Okay. My bad.

      When Schmidt turns his back, Jess winks at Cece. She holds up 
      the knife, mouths:  Please, stop. 

                                  JESS (CONT D)
                    Oo, I can t stand this heat. I 
                    better get out of the kitchen

      Jess beams at both of them, then limps off, still sore from 
      the race. As she s walking off:

                                  JESS (CONT D)
                    Ow, ow. Oh my goodness.

                    Ugh. Jess thinking we re a cute 
                    couple makes me never want to touch 
                    you again. How do we explain to her 
                    that it s just sex?

      Cece stares at Schmidt, about to say something more.NEW GIRL #118      "Secrets"      FINAL COLLATED DRAFT      32.

      Cece drinks a coffee. REVEAL: Winston sits across from her.

                                    WINSTON

                    he going to die and he s not telling 
                    us? Did you accidentally kill

                    at me. Has someone kidnapped a
