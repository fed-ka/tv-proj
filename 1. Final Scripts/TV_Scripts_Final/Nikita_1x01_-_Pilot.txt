                                        1/07/2010                                        ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      CLOSE ON SOMEONE IN A BUNNY RABBIT MASK - DAY

      Staring directly at us, breathing hard, inhale and exhale 
      echoing inside the plastic like a drum kick.                   
      In-OUT. In-OUT.  In-OUT.    

      A shotgun is racked and BUNNY turns to see her partner in a 
      CHIPMUNK mask free an Ithaca-37 pump-action from a heavy 
      overcoat and nod - go time.  Bunny pulls a Glock.  

      Bunny s breathing now matched by a BEAT on the soundtrack as 
      they wait by the service door on the loading dock of a giant 
      PHARMACEUTICAL SUPPLY DEPOT.  Bitter cold outside.  

      Title: Detroit, Michigan -- Alex 

      The service door opens.  A WORKER exits.  They grab him. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. PHARMACEUTICAL SUPPLY DEPOT - OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

      Worker hits the floor, cowering next to a SECRETARY, a 
      SUPERVISOR, and finally a FLOOR MANAGER, all prone with hands 
      over heads. An empty pill bottle is dropped in front of 
      Manager. OXYCONTIN.  He looks up into a shotgun barrel.     

      INT. PHARMACEUTICAL SUPPLY DEPOT - WAREHOUSE

      Chipmunk escorted down a massive aisle by the Manager.  He 
      unlocks a temp-controlled palette filled with Oxycontin.  

      Chipmunk hands him two garbage bags.  Fill  er up.

      INT. WAREHOUSE OFFICE 

      Bunny watches the hostages, who are terrified... except for 
      the Supervisor - face calm as he spreads his hands, like he s 
      getting ready to do a push-up... then SPRINGS up and into 
      Bunny, smashing her against the wall.  He then FLIPS her onto 
      her back, disarming her in the process.  

      He aims Bunny s gun at Bunny and fires.  Click.  Click.

      BOOM!  The office window SHATTERS INWARD and the Supervisor 
      is blown off his feet.  Chipmunk steps in, barrel smoking.   

      Hostages SCREAM.  Bunny is stunned, shards of glass twinkle 
      on her coat and sprinkles of blood dot her plastic whiskers.                                                                                        2.


      BUNNY MASK P.O.V. - all sound drops out except breathing.  
      Chipmunk tosses us a trash bag of oxy.  Our hand reaches out 
      to pills inside. Sweet, sweet painkillers.

      COP SIRENS sound from outside.  Chipmunk hoists the other bag 
      and runs.  Bunny scrambles to her feet to follow, grabs her 
      bag, but then trips over the Supervisor s body and takes a 
      mighty spill outside the office.  Pills scatter everywhere.

      Chipmunk stops and turns.  They lock eyes.  Cop sirens grow 
      louder.  Bunny panics, begins hopelessly scooping pills.  

      She barely notices Chipmunk fleeing, or the loading door 
      flying open or the shouts of the cops.  She tries to 
      frantically down a handful when she is kicked in the back and 
      sent sprawling.  The bunny mask is torn off to reveal long 
      blonde hair and a 19 year old girl, ALEX, wild blue eyes 
      almost totally dilated.  The world around her seems to spin 
      as the Police cuff her hands behind her back.

                                  POLICE
                    Don t move!  You have the right to 
                    remain silent.  Anything you say...

                      ...Sentence you to 25 years in a 
                    federal penitentiary...

      Alex SCREAMS as we hear the sound of a prison door SLAM SHUT.

                                                                    WHITE OUT TO:

      INT. WHITE ROOM - NIGHT

      Alex s eyes blink open, no longer dilated.    

      They stare up at a vaulted white ceiling, then tilt down to 
      look out over her body, naked under a paper hospital gown, 
      stretched out on a military cot with white sheets.  Beyond 
      her bare feet is a white door with no handle set into a white 
      wall.  Where is she?

                                    MICHAEL (O.S.)
                    Evening.

      Alex jolts back against the wall, away from the MAN in the 
      dark suit, seated just to her right.                                                                                      3.


                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    It s Alex, right?  Never Alexandra?  

                                  ALEX
                    Who are you?  Where am I?

                                    MICHAEL
                    You re not in prison anymore.  Not 
                    even in Michigan, though we re the 
                    only ones who know that.  

      He tries to hand her a file.  She doesn t take it.  He drops 
      it open on her bed.  PHOTOS of a Mausoleum.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    Your death was officially ruled a 
                    suicide by the prison coroner on 
                    November first.  This is where your 
                    ashes are stored.  

      Alex looks at him.  Terrified, bewildered.  He smiles.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    My name s Michael.  I work for the 
                      government.  We ve decided to give 
                    you a second chance. 

      Alex is now staring at her supposed final resting place.

                                  ALEX
                    Why?  Why me?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Because you fit an extremely rare 
                    profile.  Attractive, young, white 
                    female with virtually no personal 
                    ties or paper trail.  Now, those do 
                    exist but they re hard to come by.  

      Alex s fear begins to make her shake.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    What really grabbed our attention, 
                    though, was the way you killed one 
                    of our own agents on your little 
                    drug raid...

      Alex leaps off the bed toward the door.  Michael s hand 
      shoots out - grabs her in a wrist lock.  The pain drops Alex 
      to her knees.  Michael has not even left his chair.                                                                                        4.


                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    His name was Kyle, by the way.  He 
                    was working undercover tracking a 
                    smuggling ring - stand and your 
                    wrist breaks.  

      Alex grits her teeth in agony, lowers back down.

                                  ALEX
                    I didn t kill no one!  It was 
                    Ronnie!

                                    MICHAEL
                    Your boyfriend s body was found 
                    near his apartment.  He s not alive 
                    to take the blame, so it will fall 
                    on you.

      He releases her.  Alex scoots back against the bed, cradling 
      her wrist, tears in her eyes.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    You don t have to end up like him, 
                    Alex.  You re meant for something 
                    more.  I can help you, but you have 
                    to take the first step.

      Alex s look hardens.  Promises from a guy.

                                  ALEX
                    Yeah?  What re you gonna help me 
                    do?

                                    MICHAEL

      EXT. POOLSIDE RESORT - DAY

      We reveal the legs and lips belong to NIKITA (27), who 
      reclines in a chaise lounge, her swimwear drawing gazes as 
      she stares out over an infinity pool.  She sets down her 
      mojito and picks up a camera, looking every inch the exotic 
      resort beauty promised in travel and leisure magazines.  

      In fact, the whole scene looks like it s out of a magazine - 
      glossy, saturated, hyper-real.  

      Nikita wanders near the pool taking pictures.  She dazzles in 
      a haute couture sunhat, Prada shades, and bikini by Sauvage. 
      An iPod nano is strapped to her arm.

      Nikita FRAMES a shot of a swarthy BILLIONAIRE in a hot-tub.  
      We say Billionaire because that s how much he d need to 
      afford the bathing BEAUTIES that flank his grossness.    

      Nikita snaps the pic, but before she knows it, a BODYGUARD 
      accosts her.  We say Bodyguard because he is toned, terse, 
      and dressed a little too warm for the heat.  He says 
      something in a foreign tongue (Belgian) and takes her camera, 
      deletes the picture she just took.

                                  NIKITA
                    Hey!  Give me that!

                                    BILLIONAIRE
                    Bresso.  Bresso.

      Bodyguard turns.  Billionaire trades some Belgian with him.

                                  NIKITA
                    Um, could I get security here?

      Billionaire laughs, rises from the tub against the protest of 
      his concubines.  He approaches Nikita, smiling and dripping.                                                                                      6.


                                    BILLIONAIRE
                    No need for that.  Bresso is 
                    security.  Just doing his job.

                                  NIKITA
                    Taking cameras from strangers?

                                    BILLIONAIRE
                    Only ones with pictures of me. Ms..

                                  NIKITA
                    Nikita.  I was just trying to get a 
                    picture of the ocean.

                                    BILLIONAIRE
                    Nikita.  Herge.  See, we re no 
                    longer strangers.

      He hands her camera back.  Nikita flashes a sheepish smile.

                                  NIKITA
                    I m sorry, I never recognize 
                      celebrities.  The whole flight down 
                    here I was sitting next to some 
                    rock star and we kept talking like 
                    I knew who he was, but I didn t.  
                    Still don t.   

      Herge smiles, says something to his bodyguard in Belgian, we 
      can pick out the words,  rock star. 

                                  NIKITA (CONT D)
                    Anyway, I ll just...

                                  HERGE
                    No, no, you re right.  This is the 
                    best view.  Let us take a picture 
                    of you and the ocean.

                                  NIKITA
                    That s okay...

                                  HERGE
                    Nikita.  I insist.

      She laughs, flirty.  Herge says something to Bresso, who 
      forces a tight smile and extends his hand.  Nikita fiddles 
      the settings on her camera and hands it back to him with good 
      humor.  Herge s eyes take her in as she walks and turns back, 
      striking a sexy pose against the ocean.  Bresso frames her.

                                  HERGE (CONT D)
                    Perfect.                                                                                      7.


      Bresso presses the button.  Camera EXPLODES, knocking his 
      head back like he was cracked with a bat, killing him 
      instantly.  

      Nikita takes two deliberate strides toward a shell-shocked 
      Herge, STRAIGHT-ARMS his face, CUPS it, turns and BREAKS HIS 
      NECK over her shoulder.  Herge s body hits the ground by 
      Bresso s.  Nikita checks his pulse to make sure he s dead, 
      ignoring the screams of the girls in the hot tub.   

      Nikita runs for the edge of the infinity pool.  A steep slope 
      runs down the other side.  Waiting there are a pair of Tevas-
      like climbing shoes and a cable to help her descend.  

      She grabs the cable with one hand while inserting the 
      earpiece from her nano with the other and pressing a button.      

                                  NIKITA
                    This is Nikita, target is down!  I 
                    need extraction.

                                    MICHAEL (V.O.)
                          (filtered through radio)
                    Negative.  Extraction impossible.

                                  NIKITA
                    What?  Say again!

                                    MICHAEL (V.O.)
                          (filtered through radio)
                    You always had trouble listening, 
                    didn t you?  

                                  NIKITA
                    Michael, please!  I need to get out 
                    of here now!

                                    MICHAEL (O.S.)
                    You still don t hear me.  I told 
                    you-

      His voice is no longer over the radio.  Nikita looks up to 
      see Michael looking very out of place in a heavy black coat, 
      balancing on the edge of the infinity pool.  The way he is 
      balancing there is surreal and impossible.  

      He is pointing a gun at her.  He whispers, but the sound 
      ECHOES across the sky, deafening.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    There is no out.

      The blue sky above Michael SHIFTS into dark, nightmarish 
      STORM CLOUDS.  He pulls the trigger. BLAM!                                                                                      8.


      INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

      Nikita snaps awake from her nightmare. She s in plain 
      clothes, no make-up.  Hyper-colors are gone, we re definitely 
      back in reality.  She drifts back into her seat.  

      The bus is slowing to a stop at the station.  A kindly 
      PASSENGER from across the aisle leans over.

                                  PASSENGER
                    Just a bad dream, honey.  Over now.

                                  NIKITA
                    Almost.  

      EXT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

      Title: Roselle, New Jersey -- Nikita.  

      Nikita gets off the bus.  She walks off with no bag.

      EXT. RUN-DOWN HOME - DAY

      One step above a trailer park.  Nikita collects herself on 
      the porch and rings the doorbell.

      INT. RUN-DOWN HOME - CONTINUOUS

      GARY MEERS, 45, too young for his hairpiece and way-too-old 
      for his Ed Hardy knock-off T, moves with supreme annoyance 
      across his living room and opens the door.  He sees Nikita.  

                                  NIKITA
                    Hi, Gary.

      He looks her over, cracks a lecherous smirk. 

                                  GARY
                     Hi, Gary?   Look, honey, upfront? 
                    That s a nice touch but I ain t 
                    buying anything.  On the other 
                    hand, you wanna step inside and 
                    drop to your knees, I ll say three 
                    Hail Marys to Jehovah right now.

                                  NIKITA
                    Okay.  Let s try this again.

      She traps his WRIST (the exact same wrist-lock Michael used) 
      and he goes down on his knees right inside the door. 

                                  NIKITA (CONT D)
                    Hi, Daddy.                                                                                      9.


                                  GARY
                      N...Nikita?  No friggin  way!

      Nikita kicks the door shut behind her.

                                  NIKITA
                    God, were you always this weak? I 
                    don t know what I was scared of.  
                    Come on, Gary, get up!  Be a man!

      Gary grits teeth, plants feet and pistons up.  His wrist 
      SNAPS.  His scream cut short by a hand-flick to the windpipe.  

                                  NIKITA (CONT D)
                    Thank you.

      Nikita walks him backwards and dumps him in his Barca-
      Lounger.  He gasps for air.  She turns off the TV. 

                                  NIKITA (CONT D)
                    Damn, you really let this place 
                    slide after Caroline died, huh? I 
                    guess no more foster kids like me 
                    to clean up your crap, either...

                                  GARY
                    I... I don t have any money!

                                  NIKITA
                    Relax, Gary.  I m not going to hurt 
                    you.  I need to tell you something 
                      important, and you need to listen 
                    very carefully.   

                                  GARY
                    You broke my God damn wrist!!

                                  NIKITA
                    Actually, you did that.  Try to pay 
                      attention, okay?  We don t have 
                    much time.  
                          (sits on edge of couch)
                    I have to tell you what happened to 
                    me, after I ran away from you.  It 
                    starts out like what you d expect, 
                    and then gets kinda weird.

                                  GARY
                    Nikita...

      Nikita cuts him off, launching into a semi-rehearsed speech.                                                                                    10.


                                  NIKITA
                    After I ran away, I got with a 
                    pretty bad crowd, did a lot of 
                    drugs.  Ketamine, to be exact.  I 
                    did whatever I had to do to get it, 
                     cause it was the only thing that 
                    helped me forget about you.    

                                  GARY
                    Nikita, baby, that was ten years 
                    ago...

                                  NIKITA
                    Eleven.  I m twenty seven now, and 
                    if you call me baby again I will 
                    shatter your collarbone.

      Gary clams up.  Nikita takes a deep breath.

                                  NIKITA (CONT D)
                    They told me I killed a cop.  I 
                    still don t remember it.  I ve 
                    tried to.  I guess I was high.  I 
                    had just turned eighteen so they 
                    were able to charge me with murder 
                    one.  I was sentenced to die by 
                    lethal injection.  

                                  GARY
                          (shocked)
                    No friggin ...

                                  NIKITA
                    Trust me, you ll wanna save your 
                     no friggin  way  for this next 
                    part; where my execution was faked  
                    by a secret unit inside the 
                      government called Division.

      Gary s expression is priceless.  Nikita sits back.  

                                  NIKITA (CONT D)
                    They told me they were giving me a 
                    second chance.  They told me I was 
                    going to serve my country.  They re 
                    probably telling the same thing to 
                    some other girl, right now...

      INT. DIVISION - SHOWER - SAME TIME

      CLOSE ON A SHOWER HEAD beginning to spray water.

      ALEX alone in the bunker-style shower, washing the grime off. 
      Note a large BUTTERFLY TATTOO between her shoulder blades.                                                                                    11.


                                  NIKITA (V.O.)
                    What they didn t tell me, was they 
                    were training me to be an assassin.

      INT. DIVISION - ALEX S ROOM

        Nondescript, label-less clothes on a military cot; black 
      sweater, cargo pants, combat shoes.  

                                  NIKITA (V.O.)
                    There was a year of training before 
                    my first mission.  Sort of like 
                    Military Charm School.  

      TIME CUT - Alex, dressed, finishes tying the shoes, looks up 
      to see Michael waiting for her in the doorway.

      INT. DIVISION - TRAINING AREA

      Alex passes a classroom where young people watch a 
      demonstration of someone with a hood over their head 
        manipulating some kind of computer board.

                                  NIKITA (V.O.)
                      Discipline, etiquette, seduction...

      In another room, a handsome young man (THOM) in loose sweats 
      pulls a vicious combo on a martial arts pad.  Alex s wide 
      eyes meet his for a second before she passes the door.

      INT. RUN-DOWN HOME - BACK TO NIKITA

                                  NIKITA
                      Everything to make me the best 
                    killer I could be.  Which is 
                    exactly what I was, until I broke 
                    one of their rules. 

                                  GARY
                    What rule?

      She flashes a modest diamond engagement ring.

                                  NIKITA
                    Fell in love.  With a civilian.  
                    His name was Daniel.

      Nikita looks off into nowhere, remembering something fondly.

                                  NIKITA (CONT D)
                    After three months together, all I 
                    wanted was to be with him.  Live a 
                    normal life.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    12.

                                  NIKITA (CONT D)
                    But Division couldn t have that, so 
                    they killed him, made it look like 
                    an accident.

                                  GARY
                    Why are you telling me all this?

      Nikita leans forward, menacing.

                                  NIKITA
                    You know why, Gary.  Because 
                    they re still after me.  And I know 
                    they ve been keeping tabs on you in 
                    case I showed up.    

      Gary turns pale, reveal he s been pressing a panic-button 
      mounted on the underside of his end table this whole time.  

      Nikita grabs his hand and holds it down on the button.  

                                  NIKITA (CONT D)
                    It s okay, I want them to know I m 
                    here.  I want you to tell them 
                      everything I just told you.  I want 
                    to send them a message:

      INT. DIVISION - OPERATIONS ROOM

      Michael escorts Alex into the hi-tech room, AGENTS crossing.

                                  ALEX
                    What is this?

                                    MICHAEL
                          (smiles)
                    This is the beginning.

      BACK TO NIKITA

      Finishing her message to Gary.

                                  NIKITA
                    It ends now.

                                        ACT TWO

      INT. DIVISION - BRIEFING - DAY

      A cold, spartan room.  No leather, no cigar smoke. Several 
      folding chairs face a SMARTboard.  

      Michael briefs his boss, PERCY, 55, the Machiavellian leader 
      of Division.  Michael refers to video on the SMARTboard of a 
        well-dressed BLACK MAN strolling out of a New York hotel, 
      followed by BODYGUARDS who hold his bags.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    This is surveillance of our target 
                    leaving the hotel...

      He freezes the image, circles a Bodyguard with a digital pen.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    This is his personal bodyguard.  
                    There are three more guards in his 
                    suite, and one advance guard in the 
                    lobby.  The lobby guard is the weak 
                    link.  That s our way in.

      Michael steps back from the board.

                                  PERCY
                    We can t afford any mistakes on 
                    this one, Michael.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Do you see a problem with the plan?

                                  PERCY
                    Do you?  I m sensing a certain lack 
                    of enthusiasm. 

      Michael hesitates, then admits his reluctance.

                                    MICHAEL
                    General Safwani is a man trying to 
                    bring peace to his country.  It s 
                    hard to get enthusiastic about 
                    killing him.

      A tense beat.  The phone rings.  Percy picks it up.  

                                  PERCY
                          (into phone)
                    Hold on a second.
                          (puts phone to chest)
                    We re not the good guys, Michael.  
                    We re the necessary guys.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    14.

                                  PERCY (CONT'D)
                    We do what s necessary to protect 
                    U.S. interests in the region.  And 
                    right now, peace runs counter to 
                    those interests.  We clear?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Our priorities seem to be getting a 
                    little less clear every year.  
                          (off Percy s look)
                    But you don t have to worry about 
                    me.

      Percy stares at Michael, then puts the phone to his ear.

                                  PERCY
                    This is Percy.

      Percy listens for a beat.  Then his entire being tenses up.

                                  PERCY (CONT D)
                    When?  
                          (beat, listens)
                    We ll be right down.

      Percy hangs up.  Thinks to himself for a moment.

                                  PERCY (CONT D)
                    I m taking you off of Operation 
                    Black Arrow.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I said you don t have to worry 
                    about me...

                                  PERCY
                    And I m giving you a new 
                      assignment:  Nikita.

      Michael takes that in, shocked to hear that name.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Nikita?

                                  PERCY
                    She just popped up on the grid.  
                    Sprung one of the mousetraps we 
                    laid out for her.

      Michael s mind races.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Cemetery?                                                                                    15.


                                  PERCY
                    Foster Dad s.  
                          (beat)
                    I want you to hunt her down, and 
                    kill her.  I m going to send a 
                    Cleaner along with you.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Why?  More doubts about my 
                      enthusiasm?

                                  PERCY
                    Just want to make sure she doesn t 
                    elude you this time.

      Michael takes that on the chin.  He exits. 

      INT. DIVISION - CAFETERIA - DAY

      Michael emerges from a corridor into a large room, cross 
      between a military bunker and a high school cafeteria.  
      People sit at the metal tables, eating. *

      ALEX is one of them, alone with a tray of food, sullen.    
      She perks up slightly when she sees Michael enter - the only 
      person she s really met here.  

      But Michael, his mind on Nikita, doesn t even acknowledge 
      Alex as he crosses the room to a STEEL ELEVATOR, secured by 
      keycard and retinal scanner.  Michael passes through the 
      security check and into the elevator.  Doors close. 

      Alex, paranoid and vulnerable, looks around at the other 
      people here, trying to figure this place out. 

      A table of ten MEN with close cropped hair, izod shirts, and 
      muscled arms eat in complete silence.  At another table two 
      AGENTS IN SUITS study off the same laptop.

      Alex catches the eye of a GIRL her own age, dressed in the 
      same kind of clothes Alex was given.  The Girl is leaning 
      back in her chair and staring at Alex.  Alex looks away.  

      The girl smirks.  She leaves her tray but takes her banana as 
      she crosses the cafeteria toward Alex like a predator.

      She sits down across from Alex, and stares.  Alex looks down 
      at her food.  Girl waits. 

                                  ALEX
                    What?

      Girl just stares.  Alex meets her look, hard.                                                                                    16.


                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    What re you looking at, bitch?

      Girl suppresses a laugh, begins to slowly peel her banana.  

                                  GIRL
                          (casual)
                    You re gonna die here, you know 
                    that?

      Alex UP-ENDS her tray in the girl s face.  CRASH!  They both 
      stand, a fork gripped in Alex s hand.  Before the Girl can 
      jump the table, a pair of arms wrap around her from behind.

                                  THOM
                    The hell are you doing?!

      A loud whisper from THOM, young like them.  He uses his 
      strength to sit the girl (JADEN) down into his lap.  

                                  THOM (CONT D)
                          (to Jaden)
                    If you don t think they watch us in 
                    here, you re wrong.
                          (to Alex)
                    I d put that down if I were you.

      His eyes flick to the right, and Alex sees the table-full of 
      muscled izod guys staring at her.

                                  JADEN
                    I love it when you hold me like 
                    this.  
                          (off Thom s look)
                    God, calmate.  I was just saying hi 
                    to New Girl.

                                  THOM
                          (to Alex)
                    This is Jaden.  She doesn t think 
                    she s still new here, but she is.  
                    What s your name?

                                  ALEX
                    What s yours?

                                  JADEN
                    This is Thom.  With an  h  like 
                    Thom Yorke.  He s a pro because 
                    he s about to go on his first 
                    mission.                                                                                      17.


                                  THOM
                    Shut up.
                          (to Alex)
                    Look, we re recruits, just like 
                    you.  I ve been in almost a year, 
                    they brought Jaden in two months 
                    ago.  None of us are volunteers, 
                      understand?

                                  JADEN
                    Meaning whatever they got on you, 
                    whatever your big bad past is, it s 
                    nothing we haven t heard before.

                                  THOM
                    Meaning we gotta stick together if 
                    we re gonna make it through 
                    training.  Trust me.  

      Alex shakes her head, not ready for trust.

                                  THOM (CONT D)
                    You can start by telling us your 
                    name.

      Alex holds her ground, not sure about that, either.  

                                  AGENT (O.S.)
                    Alex.

      An AGENT in a SUIT approaches.  Alex puts the fork down. 

                                  AGENT (CONT D)
                    Amanda is ready to see you.  Follow 
                    me.

      Alex looks back at Thom, who nods.  Somehow, it comforts her. 
      She follows the Agent.  Thom watches her go.  Jaden grins.

                                  JADEN
                    Dropped my banana.

      Thom roughly unseats her from his lap.  She laughs.

      INT. RUN-DOWN HOME - DAY

      Michael is questioning a very pissed off Gary, wrist in cast.

                                  GARY
                    Did she appear injured?  Did... I m 
                    the injured one here! 

                                    MICHAEL
                    We understand that.                                                                                    18.


                                  GARY
                    Well, understand this.  FBI better 
                    be payin  for this cast,  cause  
                    this is way beyond the call of 
                    duty.  Hey, don t touch that!  

      ROAN, a very tall man in a long coat, ignores Gary as he uses 
      a hi-tech fingerprint scanner on the coffee table.  He snaps 
      it shut and walks into the bathroom.

                                  GARY (CONT D)
                    She didn t go in the bathroom!

                                    MICHAEL
                    Did she say anything else?

                                  GARY
                    Man, we been over this fifty 
                    friggin  times already. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    What do you think she meant by,  it 
                    ends now? 

                                  GARY
                    I don t know, I kinda tuned out 
                    after she went into the whole James 
                    Bond thing...

                                    MICHAEL
                    I meant her tone.  Was she tired? 
                    Weary?  Like she wants to 
                      surrender, or turn herself in?

                                  GARY
                    I wasn t concentrating on her tone, 
                    man.  My wrist was friggin -

      Gary DROPS like a marionette as Roan SHOOTS him in the head, 
      passes Michael, and picks up his briefcase.

                                  ROAN
                    I m all set.

      Michael stares at Gary s body, furious.  He turns to Roan.

                                  ROAN (CONT D)
                    Don t worry, I ll clean it.

      Roan pops open his briefcase, begins taking out industrial 
      strength cleaning chemicals - along with hydrochloric acid.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Roan.  I was talking to him.                                                                                    19.


                                  ROAN
                    He told you everything she said.  
                    He was dead the second she told 
                    him.

      Roan plucks his spent shell casing out of the shag carpet.

                                  ROAN (CONT D)
                    Nikita knew what we would have to 
                    do.  Wish I could take credit, but 
                    this kill belongs to her.  

      He hands Michael the shell casing, lifts Gary under the arms.

                                  ROAN (CONT D)
                    I don t think she liked this guy.

      Michael watches Roan drag the body into the bathroom.

      EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

      Nikita s shoes tromp through the grass around headstones.  

      She slows as she finds the headstone she is looking for.  
      Daniel Monroe, Beloved Son, 1981-2007.  

      Nikita steadies herself.  She has never been here before.  
      There are week-old flowers resting on the grave.  Nikita 
      kneels, and picks one up.  Thumbs the petals. 

                                  DANIEL (V.O. PRE-LAP)
                    I m not asking annoying questions, 
                    okay?  I m giving annoying advice.

      A bittersweet POP SONG lulls us into...

      INT. APARTMENT - BED (FLASHBACK)

      DANIEL spoons a moody Nikita.  ROSES scattered on the bed and 
        night-table, next to a cupcake and birthday candle.

                                  DANIEL
                    The job s too stressful, let it go.

                                  NIKITA
                    You know I can t, Daniel.

                                  DANIEL
                    The airline will find another 
                      consultant.  You can find something 
                    that keeps you in the city more.

      She twists a rose stem, finds the one thorn and presses it.                                                                                    20.


                                  NIKITA
                    Too much would have to change.

                                  DANIEL
                    How much?

      She doesn t answer.  He slides a ring box in front of her.

                                  DANIEL (CONT D)
                    This much?

      She looks back at him, her face breaks into a smile.

                                  DANIEL (CONT D)
                    Don t get too excited, it s just 
                    the box.

                                  NIKITA
                    What?

      She opens it.  It s more than a box.  1.5 carats more.  
      Nikita playfully elbows him.  Well, playfully for a trained 
      assassin.  Hits him in the solar plexus without thinking.  

                                  NIKITA (CONT D)
                    Daniel, it s beautiful.

                                  DANIEL
                    Ah.  I think you broke a rib...

      She rolls on top of him, kisses his torso near his top rib.

                                  NIKITA
                    Which rib?  This one?
                          (kisses the one below it)
                    This one?
                          (kisses the one below it)
                    This one?

                                  DANIEL
                    I m not sure.  Keep going.

      Nikita smiles.  Then gets serious as she looks into his eyes.

                                  NIKITA
                    Promise me something.

                                  DANIEL
                    Right now, anything.

                                  NIKITA
                    Promise me this is real.  Not some 
                    dream I m going to wake up from 
                    tomorrow.                                                                                    21.


      Daniel searches her eyes.  She means it.  He sits up, takes 
      her face in his hands, and kisses her.

      EXT. CEMETERY - BACK TO NIKITA

      Nikita, tears in her eyes, takes off her ring. 

      She begins to bury the ring in the grass.

      INT. DIVISION - OPERATIONS ROOM - SAME TIME

      ON A MONITOR - Nikita s pixelated figure resolves on a 
      satellite image, which zooms out to show the whole cemetery.  

      Percy enters.  Computer Specialist BIRKHOFF is on his feet.

                                  BIRKHOFF
                    It s her.  It s definitely her.  I 
                    got a hit on the pressure sensor at 
                      Greenlawn, pulled up AthenaSat and 
                    boom.  Took her three years, but 
                    she s finally paying her respects. 

                                  PERCY
                    Can we get a clearer image?

                                  BIRKHOFF
                    It s her.

      Percy picks up the phone.

      INT. RUN-DOWN HOME - DAY (INTERCUT WITH OPERATIONS)

      Michael on his phone, taking in the update from Percy.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Doesn t make any sense.  She s 
                    eluded capture for three years... I 
                    don t think she d come out of 
                    hiding just to get caught.

                    She s lying prone on the grave of 
                    her dead boyfriend.  She s cracked.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    No, she s up to something.  At 
                    least wait for me before you move 
                    on her.  I can be in Bethesda in 45 
                      minutes...                                                                                    22.


                                  PERCY
                    Strike team will be there in 
                    twenty, without a chopper. We ll 
                    finish this.  Just get back here.

      Michael hangs up.  Roan leans out of the bathroom, wearing an 
      apron and cleaning gloves.

                                  ROAN
                    Almost done.

      Michael, frustrated, heads out the door.

      INT. DIVISION - AMANDA S ROOM - DAY

      A security door clicks open and Alex steps from a concrete 
      corridor into a wood-paneled entryway.  Her escort closes the 
      door behind her.  She takes a few steps, walks into a dream.

      At least, that s what it feels like.  A large space, warmly 
      lit and decorated like a banquet room in a five star Paris 
      hotel - if banquet rooms came with DRESS RACKS dripping with 
      the full spectrum of current fashion.

                                  ALEX
                    Hello?

      No one answers.  Alex approaches the dress rack, tentative.  
      Runs her fingers through the satin of a coral evening dress.

                                  AMANDA (O.S.)
                    That s a Balghetti.  Fresh off the 
                    rack from Milan.

      Alex turns to see a beautiful woman in an elegant suit 
      watching her.  AMANDA.  Alex steps away from the dress.

                                  AMANDA (CONT D)
                    It s alright, Alexandra.  Would you 
                    like to try it on?

                                  ALEX
                    I don t wear stuff like this.

                                  AMANDA
                    As a style choice?  Or because 
                    you re not used to it?

                                  ALEX
                    Because it s ugly.  

                                  AMANDA
                    And you re beautiful.  Michael was 
                    right about that much.                                                                                    23.


      Alex is trying to be tough, but she s intimidated.

                                  ALEX
                    So, what... you re the one who s 
                    gonna teach me how to walk and 
                    talk?  Chew with my mouth closed?

                                  AMANDA
                    My name is Amanda.  And I m the one 
                    who s going to show you how to 
                    embrace your beauty.  Instead of 
                    denying it, you re going to learn 
                    how to trust it, and use it to your 
                      advantage.

                                  ALEX
                    And what if I don t want to?  What 
                    are they gonna do to me?

      Amanda pulls out a chair near a mirrored vanity lined with 
      cosmetics and a few wigs.  

                                  AMANDA
                    Everyone wants to be beautiful.  To 
                    travel, to see the world, 
                      experience the best life has to 
                    offer.  Your journey begins right 
                    here, in this chair.

                                  ALEX
                    I m not smearing that crap on my 
                    face. 

      Alex walks away.

                                  AMANDA
                    It s not like this will be the 
                    first time you ve re-invented 
                    yourself, Alex.  We re all 
                    impressed with your accent.        
                    Or lack thereof.

      That stops Alex cold.  Amanda switches to fluent Russian. 

                                  AMANDA (CONT D)
                          (Russian with subtitles)
                    What does the butterfly on your 
                    back mean if not transformation?  

                                  ALEX
                    How...                                                                                    24.


                                  AMANDA
                    Do we know?  That s what we do 
                    here. What we teach you to do.

      Amanda takes her first steps toward a stunned Alex.

                                  AMANDA (CONT D)
                    The identity you purchased was 
                    enough to get by with on the 
                    streets, because that s where you 
                    purchased it.

      Alex looks like she s about to bolt.  Amanda calms her.

                                  AMANDA (CONT D)
                    It s alright, dear.  It actually 
                    makes you more desirable to us - 
                    someone with no real past to erase.  
                    Or rather, no legal one.  I know 
                    how real it was.

                                  ALEX
                    Do you?

                                  AMANDA
                    Based on your age now, and taking 
                    into account the five years or so 
                    you d have to work to lose your 
                    accent, it wasn t hard to answer 
                    the question;  What kind of 
                    fourteen year old Ukrainian girl 
                    purchases a forged identity?   
                    Perhaps one who was brought here 
                    against her will, on a boat, with 
                    many other girls just like her? 

                                  ALEX
                    Not like me.  I escaped.

                                  AMANDA
                    Your captors, yes.  But not the 
                    junk they hooked you on.

      Alex bites her lip.  Amanda gently brushes her hair away from 
      her face, and Alex looks younger than ever.

                                  AMANDA (CONT D)
                    You re a survivor, Alex.  You made 
                    it through hell, and you ll make it 
                    through this.  All I m here to show 
                    you is that you don t have to be 
                    hard, to survive...  

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    25.


      EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

      Without sound, a Soccer-Mom looking Chevy Trailblazer pulls 
      up to the entrance and five AGENTS alight, weapons concealed 
      beneath plain clothes.  

                                  AMANDA (V.O.)
                    Sometimes you need to be soft.

      INT. CHEVY TRAILBLAZER - CONTINUOUS

      Birkhoff is in the back.  A large case is open with monitor 
      and surveillance drone controls, sending back aerial image of 
      the cemetery, a red target box around Nikita s location. 

                                  AMANDA (V.O.)
                    Sometimes vulnerability can be your 
                    greatest weapon...

                                  BIRKHOFF
                          (into headset)
                    Row A, Plot 30.  Mausoleum to the 
                    Southeast should cover your 
                    approach.
                          (to himself)
                    Bye, Nikki.

      EXT. CEMETERY - SAME TIME

      ALPHA TEAM (we recognize them from the izod crew) move 
      through the cemetery like wraiths, closing in on Nikita from 
      45 degree angles.  Hand signals - target is low.    

      They rise above the gravestones, weapons spitting silent FIRE 
      and ventilating the BLOW UP-DOLL draped in Nikita s jacket.

      The doll wheezes out its death rattle through puncture holes.

                                  BIRKHOFF (V.O.)
                          (over radio)
                    Target on the move!  North Gate!  
                    North Gate!

      Alpha team breaks into a charge to the North.

      INT. CHEVY TRAILBLAZER - SAME TIME

                                  BIRKHOFF
                          (into headset)
                    Radio back when you have visual.

      Reveal Nikita, in T-Shirt, holding a gun to his head.  She 
      whips off his headset the second he s done talking.                                                                                    26.


                                  NIKITA
                    Good boy.

                                  BIRKHOFF
                    What re you gonna do?

                                  NIKITA
                    You ll find out.

      Nikita strikes Birkhoff with the butt of her gun at the 
      hollow right below his ear, knocking him out.  She hops past 
      him into the driver s seat, drops the car into gear.

      Nikita hits the gas.

      EXT. CEMETERY - CONTINUOUS

      The Trailblazer blazes out of the exit and down the road.

      FADE OUT

                                      ACT THREE

      INT. HIDE-OUT - NIGHT

      Birkhoff is cuffed to a chair in a dark room with a hood over 
      his head.  He moans, awake.  Nikita pulls his hood off and 
      Birkhoff winces under the glare of a halogen light shining 
      right into his eyes.

                                  NIKITA
                      Congratulations, Birkhoff.  You 
                    found me.

                                  BIRKHOFF
                    Ow!  Bright.  Too bright.

      His eyes adjust.  He sees a shadowy image of Nikita in front 
      of him, filling a syringe.  She sets it on a table.

                                  BIRKHOFF (CONT D)
                    What is that, truth serum?

                                  NIKITA
                    Pain desensitizer.  I don t want 
                    you passing out on me.

                                  BIRKHOFF
                    You gonna torture me, is that it?

                                  NIKITA
                    Not if you tell me what I need to 
                    know.  

                                  BIRKHOFF
                    I always told you you were hot, you 
                    know that.

                                  NIKITA
                    I want access to Division s 
                    network.  Logins, passwords...

      Birkhoff laughs, miserable.

                                  BIRKHOFF
                    Bitch, just skip to the part where 
                    you kill me.

      Nikita stands and PISTOL-WHIPS him. 

                                  NIKITA
                    No.

      She PISTOL-WHIPS him again.  He spits blood.                                                                                    28.


                                  BIRKHOFF
                      Seriously, do it.   Cause if I give 
                    you those codes, Percy will kill 
                    me, and I d rather you do it...

      Nikita puts the gun to his head, clicks the safety off.

                                  BIRKHOFF (CONT D)
                          (dazed)
                    At least you re someone I like...

                                  NIKITA
                    Shut up!

      Nikita puts her hand up to deflect the spray.  Birkhoff 
      closes his eyes.  Beat.  She holds her breath. Beat.  Beat.

                                  NIKITA (CONT D)
                    Damn. 

      She can t do it.  She stalks away.  Birkhoff blinks through 
      his pain, trying to take in his surroundings.  Notices that 
      the walls curve - is the room circular?

                                  BIRKHOFF
                    What do you want with the network, 
                    anyway?  Not like it s been any 
                    help to us in finding where you ve 
                    been hiding out...

                                  NIKITA
                    I m not hiding anymore.

                                  BIRKHOFF
                    Then what are you doing?  You 
                    trying to come in?   Cause this is 
                    a weird way to do it.

                                  NIKITA
                    Shut up, Birkhoff.

                                  BIRKHOFF
                    What?  You re not coming at us, are 
                    you?

      He chuckles.  Sees her look.  Stops chuckling.

                                  BIRKHOFF (CONT D)
                    Oh, man.  Nikki, you re insane.

                                  NIKITA
                    Don t call me Nikki.                                                                                    29.


                                  BIRKHOFF
                    Then don t call me Nerd.  That s 
                    what you used to call me, remember?  
                     Nerd, patch this through to 
                    Michael.   This computer s busted, 
                    Nerd.  Fix it. 

      He has a big grin.  She can t help but smile a little.

                                  BIRKHOFF (CONT D)
                    None of the noobs would dare call 
                    me that.  Place ain t the same 
                    without you, babe.

                                  NIKITA
                    Then let s burn it down.

                                  BIRKHOFF
                    You seriously think you can burn 
                    down Division all on your own?

                                  NIKITA
                    Who says I m on my own?

      Birkhoff takes that in.  Can t believe it.

                                  BIRKHOFF
                    You wouldn t...

                                  NIKITA
                      Division s made some pretty 
                    powerful enemies over the years.

                                  BIRKHOFF
                    You re playing for the other side 
                    now?  Who?  China?

                                  NIKITA
                    I m playing for my side.

                                  BIRKHOFF
                    Your side.  Okay.  If you got such 
                    big guns backing you up on your 
                    side, what do you need me for?

                                  NIKITA
                    Because they may be able to get me 
                    the intel I need, but I know you 
                    can get it.

                                  BIRKHOFF
                    Then we re right back where we 
                    started.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    30.

                                  BIRKHOFF (CONT'D)
                    Just know if you do this, you re 
                    gonna have to kill your way through 
                    a lot of people you know.  Starting 
                    with me, Nikki. 

      Birkhoff sits back, defiant.  Off Nikita, ball in her 
      court...   

      INT. DIVISION - OPERATIONS ROOM - NIGHT

      Michael and a TECH study a GPS beacon on a digital map.

                                  TECH
                    She ditched right here near the 
                      interchange.  Probably switched 
                    cars.  We re checking traffic cams.   

                                    MICHAEL
                    What about Birkhoff s implant?

                                  TECH
                    Still searching for a signal.  
                    There s some kind of interference.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    I hope it s still inside him.

                                  TECH
                    No bloodstains in the vehicle...

      Michael sits down, staring vacantly at state maps. 

                                    MICHAEL
                          (under his breath)
                    Why now, why now, why now...

      Thom enters, slows as he notices all the activity, curious.

                                  THOM
                    Michael?  What s going on?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Training mission.  Is there 
                    something you need?

                                  THOM
                    Question, Sir.  In regards to 
                    Operation Black Arrow.

      Michael smiles at the kid s formality.  He likes Thom.

                                    MICHAEL
                    You should talk to Roan. He s the 
                    lead on that now.                                                                                    31.


                                  THOM
                    But you planned it.  My question s 
                    about the plan.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    But you don t know the plan, Thom.  
                    You know your part of it.  Your 
                    vital, but contained part of it.  
                    What question is there?

                                  THOM
                    It actually has to do with General 
                    Safwani.  The target.

      Michael s smile drops.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Where did you get that name?

                                  THOM
                    I...

                                    MICHAEL
                    Who gave you that name?

      Michael stands, gets in Thom s nerve-wracked face.

                                  THOM
                    No one.  I guessed it.

      Michael grabs Thom by the arm, ushers him across the floor 
      and into a side office, closes the door and backs him against 
      the wall.  Thom starts talking fast, regretting speaking up.

                                  THOM (CONT D)
                    It s my first op, I got, I got 
                    anxious so I was doing some 
                    research and it was the only name 
                    that made sense...  

                                    MICHAEL
                    You were doing some what?

                                  THOM
                    Research.  Strike point is the 
                    Windmere Hotel, so it follows that 
                    our VIP is staying there as a 
                    guest.  I cross-referenced news 
                    feeds and it s no secret General 
                    Safwani is in New York for the U.N. 
                    peace summit.  Clearly our mission 
                    calls to take him out before he can 
                    make that meeting...                                                                                      32.


                                    MICHAEL
                    What s your question, Thom?

                                  THOM
                    Why?

      Michael shakes his head, closes his eyes.  

                                  THOM (CONT D)
                    I mean, a peace treaty has the  *
                    chance to end civil war in that  *
                    region... *

                                    MICHAEL *
                    This isn t about peace, it s about   *
                    business.  Diamonds, and Big Oil.   *
                    If stability comes to that region,  *
                    those resources will be  *
                      nationalized, and our allies in the  *
                    diamond and oil industries will be  *
                    kicked out.  Understand? *

                                  THOM  *
                    So... we want the war to continue? *

      Michael notices PERCY at Operations.  He is heading this way.   *

                                    MICHAEL *
                    Word of advice, kid: avoid why.  
                    You re not ready for it yet. *

      Percy opens the door. 

                                  PERCY
                    We ve located Birkhoff. 

      Michael follows Percy out, leaving Thom disturbed.

      EXT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT

      A shadow is slumped on top of a spring rider rocking horse.

      High beams illuminate Birkhoff as two S.U.V. s roll up quick 
      onto the deserted playground.  Birkhoff, alive and super duct-
      taped to the horsie, winces under the blinding glare.  Again. 

                                  BIRKHOFF
                    Ow.  Bright. 

      Michael and two teams of Agents fan out from the vehicles.

                                  BIRKHOFF (CONT D)
                    She s long gone, guys.                                                                                    33.


      They ignore Birkhoff, securing the area first and scanning 
      with nightvision goggles, searching for Nikita.

                                  BIRKHOFF (CONT D)
                    HELLO! Get me offa this thing!

      He angrily rocks back and forth.

      INT. DIVISION - CAFETERIA - NIGHT

      Alex, hair pulled back from her face, already looking more 
      beautiful just with that, puts food on her tray in line.

      She scans the room, sees Thom brooding at a table, trying to 
      shut out Jaden who is talking to him.  Alex hesitates for a 
      moment, weighing something internally, then decides with 
      resolve and approaches their table, sets her tray down.

                                  JADEN
                    New Girl.  So glad you could join 
                    us for dinner.

                                  ALEX
                    Well, lunch was fun, so...

      She tosses something at Jaden, who catches it on reflex.     
      A banana.

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    I figured what the hell.  Hi, Thom.

                                  THOM
                    Alex.

      Alex picks up a weird vibe going on.  

                                  ALEX
                    If you guys are talking, I can...

                                  JADEN
                    No, stay.  He likes you, maybe you 
                    can get him to talk.
                          (needling Thom)
                    Thom s going out on his first 
                    mission, and he won t give up the 
                    goods. 

                                  THOM
                    You don t wanna know, okay?

                                  JADEN
                    Oh God, that makes me wanna know 
                    even more.  Come on, I know it s 
                    going down at the Windmere hotel...                                                                                    34.


                                  THOM
                    How do you know that?

                                  JADEN
                    This is spy school, Thom.  I spied 
                    on you googling stuff in the 
                    computer lab.

                                  THOM
                    You could get in trouble for that.

                                  JADEN
                    Please, who am I gonna tell?  We re 
                    all on the same side here.

                                  ALEX
                    Yeah, Thom.  We gotta stick 
                    together if we re gonna make it 
                    through training, right?

      Jaden looks at Alex, impressed.  Thom smiles just a little.  

      Just then the Steel Elevator opens and all heads turn to see 
      Birkhoff, face bruised, escorted back in by Michael and a 
      coterie of Agents.  

      Michael makes eye contact with Alex as they pass.  Alex finds 
      herself blushing.  The room buzzes with whispers when they re 
      gone, we can hear the name,  Nikita. 

                                  JADEN
                    Someone messed him up good.

                                  THOM
                    Nikita.

                                  ALEX
                    Who s Nikita?

                                  THOM
                    She was a recruit, like us.  Kind 
                    of a legend around here.

                                  JADEN
                    Yeah, the  one who got out.  More 
                    like punked out.

                                  THOM
                    You weren t even here, yet.                                                                                    35.


                                  JADEN
                    Neither were you.  Everyone s all 
                    Nikita this, Nikita that, but the  
                    stories all end the same way; chica 
                    couldn t pull the trigger anymore.

      Alex looks at Jaden, feels a chill.

                                  JADEN (CONT D)
                    I mean what are we here for, right?     
                          (off Alex s disturbed 
                            look)
                    What?  You disagree?

      Alex, coming to a terrible realization, turns to Thom

                                  ALEX
                    What are we here for?  Really?

                                  JADEN
                    Is she playing with me?

                                  ALEX
                    Michael talked about learning 
                      languages, computers...

                                  THOM
                    You will.

                                  ALEX
                    Amanda showed me all these 
                      dresses...

                                  JADEN
                    And where d she say you ll be 
                    wearing them?  Prom?  

      Jaden begins to laugh at Alex.  Thom tries to comfort her.

                                  THOM
                    At least half of our missions are 
                        counterintelligence.  Infiltration.  
                    Deep Cover.  Stealing secrets...

                                  ALEX
                    And the other half?

                                  JADEN
                    You re here to kill, honey.  For 
                    the man.  For free.  They re gonna 
                    teach you how to kill with a gun, 
                    they re gonna teach you how to kill 
                    with your nails.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    36.

                                  JADEN (CONT'D)
                    They re gonna tell you who to kill 
                    and when to kill  em and if you 
                    don t deliver they re gonna kill 
                    you.

      Alex turns to Thom, shocked.

                                  ALEX
                    Is that true?

                                  THOM
                    The truth is we re expendable.  
                    We re useful to them because we 
                    don t exist.

      Thom, upset, feeling the pressure of his impending mission, 
      gets up and leaves.  Jaden watches him, surprised.

                                  JADEN
                    Now look what you did.

      Jaden gets up and follows Thom out.  Alex is speechless.   
      She rises, half panicked, half dazed, and heads for the 
      elevator.  No way past the sophisticated security.  

      She turns around, heart pounding, realizes there are no 
      windows - she hasn t seen one since she s been here.  She 
      catches a few PERSONNEL looking at her, and slowly walks back 
      to her seat.  

      She sits, not touching her food, and stares like a laser at 
      the elevator.  The only exit out of here...

                                  BIRKHOFF (PRE-LAP)
                    She s running out of options.

      INT. DIVISION - BRIEFING - NIGHT

      Percy and Michael are de-briefing Birkhoff.

                                  BIRKHOFF
                    I mean, if she can t kill me, or 
                    even crack me, there s no way she s 
                    gonna crack this place.

                                  PERCY
                    She say who she was working for?

                                  BIRKHOFF
                    No, but honestly?  I think it was  
                    a bluff.  I think she s actually on 
                    her own.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    37.

                                  BIRKHOFF (CONT'D)
                    You shoulda seen her, she s 
                      emotional, she s impulsive, she s a 
                    mess.  I was able to turn the 
                    tables on her easy.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Was that before or after she duct-
                    taped you to the springy rocking 
                    horse?  The only reason you re 
                    alive is because she wanted you 
                    that way.  It s part of some plan.
                          (to Percy)
                    We need to suspend all operations 
                    until we can contain this.

                                  PERCY
                    All operations?

                                    MICHAEL
                    As along as she s out there, she is 
                    a threat.

                                  PERCY
                    No, threats are what we put down 
                    using our resources.  Nikita s a 
                      complication.  An isolated one.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    If you believe Birkhoff.

                                  BIRKHOFF
                    I m telling the truth, Michael.  
                    And she didn t kill me because she 
                    likes me.  I think you re just 
                    jealous she didn t ask about you. 

      Percy checks his watch, heads for the door.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Where are you going?

                                  PERCY
                    The Joint-Intelligence Fundraiser 
                    is tonight, I ve got to go sing for 
                    our supper.  In the meantime, I m 
                    not gonna let a piece of street 
                    trash slow this organization down 
                    for one minute.  All operations are 
                    a go.  Including Black Arrow.

      Percy exits.                                                                                    38.


      INT. HIDE-OUT - NIGHT

      Nikita steps out of the shower, towel around her, to see a 
      message blinking on her computer.  She crosses to it.  

      ON MONITOR - the data package decodes through a series of 
        Cyrllic-looking characters to form a message:  Black Arrow 
      Target: Safwani.  Windmere Hotel. 2200hr.  

      Nikita crosses to a closet and opens it, revealing a colorful 
      array of beautiful CLOTHES, SHOES, and DRESSES on one side...

      And a full selection of WEAPONS on the other side.  

      She stands back in her towel, trying to decide what to wear 
      tonight... and which gun best goes with it.

      FADE OUT.


                                    END ACT THREE                                                                                    39.


                                        ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:

      EXT. WINDMERE HOTEL - NIGHT

      To establish.  35 floors of stylish hotel.

      INT. CORNER SUITE - NIGHT

      GENERAL SAFWANI (mid-40s, handsome), the target, tries on 
      clothes he s bought on Madison Avenue in front of a full-
      length mirror.  His PERSONAL BODYGUARD stands by, making 
      comments in Bassa dialect.  

      Doorbell rings and the THREE OTHER BODYGUARDS go to answer 
      it.  Room Service.

      EXT. FLOOR 33 HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

      The Bodyguards frisk the ROOM SERVICE GUY, check the food 
      before wheeling the table in themselves.  

      Room Service Guy reaches into his vest and 3 GUNS come out. 
      He freezes.  He was just going for the check.

      WAY DOWN THE HALLWAY

      ROAN, disguised as a Maintenance Man, steps into the alcove 
      by the Ice Machine, keys a mic in his shirt cuff.

                                  ROAN
                    Food s in.  Move them.

      INT. LOBBY - NIGHT

      A Division AGENT, dressed as STAFF (black suit, name clip), 
      responds.

                                  AGENT
                    Five minutes.

      Agent s eyes are on a FOURTH BODYGUARD stationed in the lobby 
      - an early-warning asset for the ones upstairs.  

      #4 s job is to basically watch for suspicious characters and 
      report them up.  He does this by reading the newspaper on one 
      of the lobby couches, while keeping his eyes open.  His eyes 
      track a YOUNG COUPLE entering and checking in.  He s bored.  

      Agent flips a VIAL into his palm and back up into his cuff 
      with sleight of hand as he approaches #4.                                                                                    40.


      Agent passes the couch, plucks a half-filled glass of 
      icewater off the low table.  Bodyguard reacts.

                                  BODYGUARD
                          (West-African accent)
                    Hey.  This was my water.

                                  AGENT
                    Oh, I m sorry.  I thought it was 
                    left by another guest.  Would you 
                    like a new one?

      #4 shakes his head, takes his water back.  Agent smiles and 
      walks away.  Behind a column, he checks his vial. Empty.

      In a lobby mirror, he watches #4 take a drink.  

                                  AGENT (CONT D)
                          (into his mic)
                    Four is inbound.

      #4 shifts in his seat.  Finds he suddenly has to pee.  Now. 
      He gets up and heads for the bathroom off the lobby.  

      INT. LOBBY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Beautiful like the rest of the lobby.  #4 heads straight for 
      the urinal, ignoring the Bathroom Attendant, who is THOM.

      Thom is wearing a valet-style jacket with the Windmere logo.  
      As #4 is busy, Thom removes a tiny bottle of CHLOROFORM and 
      douses one of the nice hand towels with it.

      Thom is anxious but his movements are practiced, robotic.

      INT. LOBBY - SAME TIME

      The other Agent quietly places a CAUTION - OUT OF ORDER sign 
      outside the men s bathroom, and stands by it.  

      INT. LOBBY BATHROOM

      #4 flushes and heads for the sink.  Thom graciously turns on 
      the sink nearest him.  Once #4 s hands hit the water...

      Thom moves behind and GAGS him with the towel. #4 struggles 
      but Thom is strong and the struggle accelerates the 
      Chloroform.  In five seconds #4 is K.O. d on the tile.

      Thom is breathing hard, scared and a little thrilled.  He 
      turns off the water, then keys his mic.

                                  THOM
                    Four is down.                                                                                    41.


      Agent enters and together they drag #4 into a stall. He 
      removes #4 s Nextel and gives it THREE QUICK BEEPS.   

      INT. CORNER SUITE - SAME TIME

      Safwani s Personal Bodyguard receives the beeps, makes eye 
      contact with the others.  He keys his Nextel.

                                  PERSONAL
                          (in Bassa with subtitles)
                    What s wrong?

      Beat. The only response is another THREE BEEPS.

      INT. LOBBY BATHROOM - SAME TIME

      The Agent and Thom finish sending the beeps and wait.

                                  AGENT
                    That should send the cavalry.

                                  NIKITA (O.S.)
                    I agree.

      Heads whip to see NIKITA standing outside the stall, in tight 
      jeans and slim black leather jacket, equal parts gorgeous and 
      kick-ass.  

      The Agent MOVES on Nikita, reaching behind his belt as he 
      does so, but she is already raising her hand and FIRING. 

      It happens fast so it s hard to see, but it s not a gun - the 
      thing goes POOF and a BLUE GOB hits the Agent in the face and 
      blinds him.  Welcome to the future of PepperSpray.

      His momentum carries him into her knee and he goes down.

      She fires her second GOB at Thom, whose arm is already up and 
      blocking.  Blue OC Glob hits his white jacket at 270mph.  Ow.  

      Nikita drops the weapon and engages Thom hand to hand. He is 
      stronger but she is more experienced.  She traps his strike, 
      takes an elbow to her jaw, but hooks his leg, makes sure his 
      head hits the wall as he falls.  Ouchie ow.  

      Before he can get up, Nikita presses Thom s chloroform towel 
      to his own face.  After he passes out she does it to Agent.

      She sits back against the sink, rubs her jaw, looks at the 
      three unconscious men in front of her - one on a toilet and 
      two on the floor.

                                  NIKITA (CONT D)
                    That could ve gone better.                                                                                    42.


                                  PERSONAL (V.O.)
                          (over #4 s Nextel)
                    Gardiah?

      Nikita re-focuses herself, takes #4 s Nextel, rifles through 
      his clothes until she comes up with his SUITE KEYCARD.  

      INT. CORNER SUITE - NIGHT

      Personal Bodyguard waits for a response.  None.

                                    SAFWANI
                    Check it out.  

      Personal nods the other Three, and they head out the door.

      INT. LOBBY - NIGHT

      Nikita walks through the lobby and up to the Elevators.

      She takes one UP.  Floor 33.

      INT. FLOOR 33 HALLWAY - SAME TIME

      The three bodyguards get in an elevator going DOWN.  Lobby.

      A Maintenance Man (Roan) down the hall begins to approach.

      INT. NIKITA ELEVATOR 

      Nikita clears her throat, then keys #4 s Nextel.  She begins 
      to fake a hacking cough, and a male voice.

                                  NIKITA
                          (in Bassa with subtitles)
                    He got... past me... on his way up! 
                    ... Janitor!

      Nikita checks her translation notes on a card.

                                  NIKITA (CONT D)
                    Hope that means Janitor.

      INT. BODYGUARD ELEVATOR

      It worked.  They Bodyguards scramble to stop their elevator.

                                  BODYGUARD 1
                          (in Bassa with subtitles)
                    Go up!  Go up!

                                  BODYGUARD 2
                          (in Bassa with subtitles)
                    Have to switch elevators, idiot!                                                                                    43.


      INT. FLOOR 33 HALLWAY - NIGHT

      Elevator opens and Nikita steps out, looks left, right...

      At Roan coming her way.  He slows when he sees Nikita.

      His face registers surprise.  Hers shows fear.  This is one 
      opponent she knows she cannot take.  She steps back.  

      Roan steps forward.  He knows it, too.  30 feet.  Both of 
      their hands slide to where weapons are concealed...

      And then a FAMILY spills into the hallway in between them, 
      dressed for a night out and happily squabbling in German.  
      MOM, DAD, TWEEN GIRL and YOUNG BOY.   

      Nikita subtly shakes her head.  Roan pauses as the family 
      crosses to the elevators, presses the button, and waits.

      And waits.  The Mom smiles at Nikita, who smiles back.

      The Dad is checking his phone and the kid is on his DS.  Only 
      the daughter notices something is wrong - the two statues 
      staring at each other on either side of her family.

      Roan s hands inch toward his pocket.  Nikita tenses.  

      Elevator DINGS.  Roan s eyes smile at Nikita.

      The doors open and BODYGUARDS step out.  Brief commotion as 
      the BODYGUARDS push into the hallway, German Dad apologizing 
      as his family squeezes into the elevator.

      The Bodyguards see Roan.  Janitor.  They brandish their 
      weapons, yelling at him.

                                  BODYGUARD 2
                    You!  Show your hands!

      Nikita smiles as the Bodyguards swarm Roan, who puts his 
      hands up, feigning innocence. 

      While their backs are turned, Nikita hurries the other way, 
      toward the end of the hall.

      She reaches the corner suite, kneels beneath the door handle 
      and insterts #4 s key-card into the lock. 

      The second the light turns green she SHOULDERS the door open.                                                                                    44.


      INT. CORNER SUITE - CONTINUOUS

      And SLAMS the face of Safwani s Personal Bodyguard, who was 
      pressing his eye to the peephole.  His head hits the wall, 
      then the door again as it traps him.  

      Nikita uses the door as a weapon, knocks him out. 

                                    SAFWANI
                    No!

      Nikita takes a knee, aims a TASER and fires it into Safwani. 
      He twitches, then goes down!

      Nikita grabs CAR KEYS from his Personal Bodyguard.

      She runs past Safwani to the room service table, grabs the 
      tablecloth and pulls it up over food, forming it into a big 
      bag that she then lifts off the table...

      INT. FLOOR 33 HALLWAY - SAME TIME

      Roan still stands with his hands in the air as the Bodyguards 
      frisk him.  One has a gun on him.

                                  BODYGUARD 2
                    Where is Gardiah?  The man in the 
                    lobby?

                                  ROAN
                    Por favor, no hablo ingles...

                                  BODYGUARD 2
                    Look at me!

      Bodyguard slaps him across the face.  That s it.  Roan s hand 
      drops to his pocket and comes up with a blur.

      Bodyguard 2 grabs his throat, gurgling.

      Roan moves so fast it s scary, hands whipping from one guard 
      to the next.  All three are dead or dying in six seconds.

      CLOSE ON ROAN S KNIFE - held down by his side. A COMBAT 
      KARAMBIT, like a tiny monster claw, dripping blood.

      CLOSE ON ROAN S FACE - primal, unmasked.  He runs down the 
      hall. 

      ANGLE - END OF THE HALL

      A slightly comical sight as Nikita wheels the room service 
      table with General Safwani slumped on top of it into a 
      SERVICE ELEVATOR.                                                                                      45.


      She turns to see Roan barreling down the hall toward her.   

      Nikita fumbles and brings up her 9mm...

      The doors close right before he gets to her.  They SHAKE as 
      he SLAMS them.

      INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

      Elevator opens and Nikita rolls Safwani out into the garage.   

      She presses the key fob and the lights flash on a LIMO.

      Nikita rolls the General up to the back door and opens it.

      INT. LOBBY - NIGHT

      Thom stumbles out of the men s room, holding his head.  He 
      holds his radio with his other hand, forgetting about using 
      the concealed earpiece.

                                  THOM
                    Hello?  Control?

      Elevator opens and Roan charges across the lobby toward the 
      street exit.  Thom takes this in, nonplussed. 

                                  BIRKHOFF (V.O.)
                    This is Control.  What s your 
                    status?

      Thom watches Roan run out into the street.

      EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - NIGHT

      Roan runs down the street.  He can see Safwani s limo.  It s 
      already turning on Broadway.  He ll never catch up.  

      He keeps running.

      INT. DIVISION - OPERATIONS ROOM - NIGHT

      Birkhoff on his headset at his console.

                                  THOM (V.O.)
                    We re blown.  We need support.

      Michael, overhearing, steps in and grabs Birkhoff s headset.

                                  BIRKHOFF
                    Hey!

                                    MICHAEL
                    Thom.  What s going on?                                                                                    46.


                                  THOM (V.O.)
                    Ambush.  She came outta nowhere...

      Michael knows who  she  is.  Doesn t have to ask.

      EXT. UNITED NATIONS BUILDING - NIGHT

        Dramatically lit at night.  Safwani s Limo pulls to the curb.

      INT. DIPLOMATIC LIMO - CONTINUOUS

      Nikita turns to look through the window into the back of the 
      limo.  Safwani is awake, hazy.  She lays on the horn.  
      Safwani snaps to full consciousness.  

                                  NIKITA
                    General Safwani.  Some people tried 
                    to kill you tonight, just because 
                    you tried to do something good.

      He looks at her, goes for the door, finds it locked.

                                    SAFWANI
                    Who are you?  What do you want?

                                  NIKITA
                    They didn t want you to make your 
                    summit here tomorrow.  They don t 
                    think you can make peace with your 
                      neighbors.

      Safwani looks out the window - sees the U.N. Building, as 
      well as a few U.N. Security Guards heading this way.  Nikita 
      attracted them on purpose with her horn honk.

                                  NIKITA (CONT D)
                     Prove them wrong.  

      Nikita exits the limo, leaving Safwani inside as the U.N. 
      Security approaches.  She slips across the street and out 
      into the night.


                                  END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                    47.


                                        ACT FIVE

      EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

      Our nation s capitol, case you didn t know.

      EXT. HERITAGE FOUNDATION - NIGHT

      A long line of town cars are parked in the oval driveway/lot.  

      Michael walks past a cluster of chatting DRIVERS, approaches 
      a door where SECURITY GUARDS wand formally dressed GUESTS.  

      INT. HERITAGE FOUNDATION - NIGHT

      Black-Tie affair.  You d think with the biggest defense 
      budget in the world the department would be ashamed to hold 
      exclusive fundraisers to fleece the elite, but here we are.

      We find Percy away from the center of the party, as close to 
      the shadows as he can get.  He is speaking with a mysterious 
      Pentagon BUREAUCRAT, one of those behind-the-scenes lifers 
      who actually run America.  Percy is hocking him.

                                  PERCY
                    I don t see the problem, John.  
                    It s moving zeroes on a black 
                    budget.  Change the name of 
                    Division, if you want...

                                  THE BUREAUCRAT
                    It s not that simple anymore, 
                    Percy.  The world s changed.

                                  PERCY
                    You re right, it s more dangerous.  
                    You trust any of the yahoos in this 
                    room to get the job done?  CIA? 
                    NSA?  This idiot?

      Percy nods to the CIA DIRECTOR who passes by.

                                  CIA DIRECTOR
                    Percy!

                                  PERCY
                    Brian!

      Percy notices Michael standing nearby, and his smile falters.

                                  PERCY (CONT D)
                    Will you excuse me for one minute?

      Percy approaches Michael, who whispers in his ear.                                                                                    48.


                                    MICHAEL
                    Black Arrow was blown.  Nikita 
                    sabotaged the op.

      Now it s Michael s turn to appreciate Percy s reaction.

                                  PERCY
                      ....Alone?

                                    MICHAEL
                    She herself, and not a Seraph.

                                  PERCY
                    Then what the hell are you doing 
                    here?  Find her. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    I m gonna need to pull in assets 
                    from the field.  We trained Nikita 
                    to be a ghost, and she learned 
                    well.  Finding her when she doesn t 
                    want to be found will be next to 
                      impossible.

                                  NIKITA (O.S.)
                    Hi guys.

      REVEAL NIKITA crossing to them in a STUNNING PARTY DRESS, 
      shimmering and sexy.  High heel shoes and diamond earrings.          

                                  NIKITA (CONT D)
                    Thought I heard my name.

      Nikita smiles.  Percy and Michael (and everyone watching at 
      home) are speechless.

      INT. DIVISION - AMANDA S ROOM - NIGHT

      Amanda sits at her vanity, brushing her hair back into a bun, 
      though what she s really doing is testing a weapon - she sets 
      the brush down and a concealed blade in the handle SNAPS out.

      She hears something, looks up to the mirror to see Alex 
      entering the room.  She quietly closes the blade (so as not 
      to frighten the girl), and turns with a smile.

                                  AMANDA
                    Hello, Alex.  It s good to see you 
                    again.

                                  ALEX
                    I was... I wanted to know if you 
                    could help me.                                                                                    49.


                                  AMANDA
                    Of course.  That s what I m here 
                    for.  Tell me how I can help.

      Alex steps closer, shy, then snatches a pair of SHEARS off 
      the vanity and points the tip at Amanda s face!

                                  ALEX
                    You can help me get out of here.

                                  AMANDA
                    Alex...

                                  ALEX
                    Shut up!  We re gonna walk to the 
                    elevator, you re gonna open it.  
                    I m gonna get in.

                                  AMANDA
                    And go where?

                                  ALEX
                    Up. Out.  Get up!

      Amanda doesn t move.  Alex brings the shears under her neck. 

                                  ALEX (CONT D)
                    I didn t kill anyone, I don t wanna 
                    kill anyone.  But I swear to God, 
                    if you don t get up right now I 
                    will kill you.

      Alex is feral, desperate.  Amanda is ice.

                                  AMANDA
                    The elevator doesn t lead to 
                    freedom.  Just another room.

                                  ALEX
                    What?  

                                  AMANDA
                    I was just like you once, Alex.  
                    Until I learned that there is no 
                    such thing as escape.  There will 
                    always be another room.

      Amanda slowly rises from her chair to stand at full height, 
      Alex keeping the shears on her the whole way, trembling.

                                  AMANDA (CONT D)
                    The only way to deal with your fear 
                    is to turn around, stare it in eye, 
                    and cut its throat.                                                                                    50.


      Off Alex, freaking out...

      INT. HERITAGE FOUNDATION - NIGHT

      Nikita faces down Michael and Percy.

                                    MICHAEL
                    How did you get in here?

                                  NIKITA
                    Front door, just like you.

      She smiles at an approaching man, SENATOR MARKUS, who carries 
      two drinks from the bar, hands one to Nikita.

                                    SENATOR
                    Who are you bothering now?

                                  NIKITA
                    What, I can t mingle?

                                  PERCY
                    She s been behaving herself, 
                    Senator.  I m sorry, I didn t catch 
                    your name...

                                  NIKITA
                    Nikita.

                                  PERCY
                      Beautiful.  Your daughter?

                                    SENATOR
                    Family friend.

      Michael passes behind Nikita, bumping her and spilling her 
      WINE on the Senator s suit.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Oh!  I m sorry... 

                                  PERCY
                    Better get some seltzer on that.

      As the Senator surveys the damage, Nikita plucks the still-
      full drink from his hand, hands him her empty one.

                                  NIKITA
                    I ll wait for you.

      Senator heads off, shaking his head.  Percy nods to Michael, 
      who follows him, leaving just Nikita and Percy.                                                                                    51.


                                  PERCY
                    If Senator Markus is your idea of 
                    leverage, it won t work.

                                  NIKITA
                    He s just my ticket tonight.  Found 
                    which escort service he used and 
                    worked it so I was his date.

                                  PERCY
                    You ve been planning this for a  *

                                  NIKITA
                    Couple years, actually.  Took me a  *
                    while to get the resources   *

                                  PERCY
                    Tonight was a glitch.

                                  NIKITA
                    No, tonight was a taste.  I m going 
                    to take you apart piece by piece, 
                    mission by mission.  Chinese call 
                    it the death of a thousand cuts.                                                                                    52.


                                  PERCY
                    And you came all the way down here 
                    to tell me that.

                                  NIKITA
                    No, I came here to give you a way 
                    out.  Your only way out.

                                  PERCY
                    Oh?  And what s that?

                                  NIKITA
                    Fold.  Close down Division.  
                    Tonight.  It ll save a lot of 
                    grief, and a lot of lives.  Yours 
                    included.

      Percy looks at Nikita fondly.

                                  PERCY
                    You accompanied me to one of these 
                    before, didn t you?

                                  NIKITA
                    Five years ago.  You needed arm 
                    candy to distract some VIP.  I m 
                    surprised you remember that...

                                  PERCY
                      I remember everything.  It s why I 
                    decided to bring extra men tonight.

      Nikita looks over her shoulder to see Black Tie wearing 
      AGENTS from Strike Team Alpha subtly blocking the entrance. 

                                  PERCY (CONT D)
                    ...And why I m afraid I m gonna 
                    have to pass on your offer.

      Nikita turns to see AGENTS watching her by the door to the 
      kitchen, and the emergency exit in back.  She s SURROUNDED.

                                  ALEX (PRE-LAP)
                    Nikita.  Nikita got out...

      INT. DIVISION - AMANDA S ROOM

      Alex still holds the shears on Amanda.

                                  ALEX
                    If she got out, then so can I.                                                                                    53.


                                  AMANDA
                    Nikita?  You don t know Nikita.  
                    She ll be running for the rest of 
                    her life.  Is that what you want?

      Alex doesn t answer.  Amanda doesn t wait for her to.

                                  AMANDA (CONT D)
                    I don t know who told you these 
                    things, Alex.  About Nikita, about 
                    us, but they re not true.  We re 
                    not murderers.  We re protectors.  
                    We protect our home.

                                  ALEX
                    Home?  What home?

                                  AMANDA
                    Home is wherever you stop running.  
                    You haven t been home for so long, 
                    you probably forget what it even 
                    feels like. Or how it begins.  
                          (beat)
                    Would you like me to tell you?

      Alex wavers, unsure what to do.

                                  AMANDA (CONT D)
                    It begins with a promise.  You 
                    promise to put down the shears, I 
                    promise to forget this ever 
                    happened, and we begin again.  It s 
                    as simple as that.

      Alex slowly lowers the shears.  Amanda gently takes them from 
      her hand.  Alex begins to break down.  Amanda holds her.

                                  AMANDA (CONT D)
                    Welcome home.

      Amanda quietly lets go of the comb-knife as she holds Alex.

      INT. HERITAGE FOUNDATION - NIGHT

      Nikita glances around to see the exits quietly being sealed 
      off.  The party guests are completely unaware.

                                  NIKITA
                    Think I have to powder my...

      She spots a FEMALE SERVER blocking the hall to the bathroom.  
      The woman grips a gun under her hors d'oeuvres platter, 
      stares at Nikita.  Nikita decides to do her make-up here.                                                                                    54.


                                  PERCY
                    This doesn t have to be awkward.  
                    Take my arm, we ll walk right out 
                    that door.

      Nikita pops out her compact, checks the mirror, begins to 
      touch up her lipstick.  In the reflection, she can see 
      Michael walking back this way.  Percy is patient.  

                                  PERCY (CONT D)
                    We can do this quiet, or the other 
                    way.  It s your choice.

                                  NIKITA
                    No, Percy, it s yours.  And you 
                    just made it.

      Nikita rotates her lipstick tube.  Click.

      INT./EXT. HERITAGE FOUNDATION - CONTINUOUS

      BOOM!  A parked TOWN CAR EXPLODES, shattering windows and 
      setting off car alarms. 

      Inside, lights FLICKER and SPRINKLERS ERUPT.  Guests SCREAM 
      and hit the floor.

      Michael picks himself up, looks to see Percy doing the same.  
      They look to the exit - fleeing guests are stampeding 
      through, overwhelming the covert agents.  Nikita is NOWHERE.

      Outside, People spill out across the street.

      EXT. STREET - NIGHT

      A BLOCK DOWN, a Metro PD CRUISER sirens down the street, 
      cherries flashing.  SQUEALS to a stop as a woman stumbles out 
      in front of it.

                                  NIKITA
                    Help!  Help me!

      Nikita is limping, shoes off, dress torn, victim of a bomb 
      blast.  The OFFICER jumps out in first responder mode.    

                                    OFFICER
                    Ma am, are you alright?

                                  NIKITA
                    No, I m not!  Someone set off a 
                    bomb, and this dress was a rental!  
                    Now look at it!                                                                                    55.


      He looks down at her body as he enters trapping range and 
      Nikita STRIKES, disarming his MAGLITE and knocking him out 
      with it.  She takes his radio, leaves everything else.

                                  NIKITA (CONT D)
                    Sorry.  I ll make sure this gets 
                    back to you...

      She hops in his car, reverses it, 180 s, and drives off!

      EXT. HERITAGE FOUNDATION - NIGHT

      The town car is on fire, people running everywhere.  Michael 
      is not running.  He scans the scene deliberately, watching 
      AGENTS checking behind bushes, shining lights under cars.

                                  AGENT
                    Can t have gone far.  Metro PD is 
                    forming a ten block perimeter.  She 
                    won t get through.

      Michael nods, Agent exits.  Michael looks at METRO CRUISER 
      pulling up, then another one.  He pulls his cell phone.

      INT. DIVISION - OPERATIONS ROOM - (INTERCUT PHONE)

      Birkhoff, off the clock and on his free time, is kicking back 
      with a Red Bull and potato chips, watching skateboarding 
      bloopers on YouTube.  Some skater tries to grind a rail and 
      ends up nailing his crotch and then his head.

                                  BIRKHOFF
                          (to YouTube)
                    Whoops.  Thanks for playing.

      A call from Michael comes in.  Birkhoff puts on his headset.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Birkhoff.  I need you to get into 
                    the DC Metro fleet board.

                                  BIRKHOFF
                    I already own it.  What do you 
                    need?  I thought you were going to 
                    a party or something...

                                    MICHAEL
                    Party s over.  I want a GPS track 
                    on all cruisers in a five mile 
                    radius of my location.  There 
                    should be a pattern.

      Birkhoff owns it, but he still has to pull it up.                                                                                    56.


                                  BIRKHOFF
                    Yep.  Two, four... twelve cars 
                      converging on your location.  What 
                    happened?  You need bail money?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Any cars heading the opposite way?

                                  BIRKHOFF
                      Uhhh...yeah.  One.

      Michael is already getting in his car.

      EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

      Nikita s police car pulls into an alley and goes dark.  She 
      gets out, closes the door, walks fast to a DUMPSTER.  Reaches 
      in and pulls out a garbage bag.  Inside is a change of 
      clothes.  First thing she takes out are running shoes.

      She is just getting the second one on when a CAR whips into 
      the alley from the opposite end, and brakes.  

      Nikita heads to the cop car.  We can see the shotgun inside, 
      courtesy of the headlights behind her.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Nikita.

      She stops.  Turns, knowing what she is going to see:

      Michael, alone, pointing a gun at her.

      FADE OUT.


                                    END ACT FIVE                                                                                    57.

      EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

      The headlights from Michael s car dramatically cast his 
      shadow over Nikita, and throws hers up against the wall.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Get down on the ground.  Slowly.  
                    Spread your arms and legs.

                                  NIKITA
                    Just like old times, huh?

      She doesn t move.  Michael shakes his head.

                                  NIKITA (CONT D)
                    Just admit it, you re a little 
                    proud right now.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Of you, yeah.  Some impressive 
                    moves back there.

                                  NIKITA
                    Yay for me.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I m serious, Nikita.  You may be 
                    the best we ever trained.

                                  NIKITA
                    Guess you should ve thought about 
                    that before you murdered my 
                    boyfriend in his sleep.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I didn t know anything about that.  
                    That was Division...

                                  NIKITA
                    No!  You don t get to do that.  He 
                    was innocent.  And if I blame *
                    anyone I blame you, because you  *
                    knew that.  You knew how it would  *
                    destroy my life. *

                                    MICHAEL *
                    It wasn t your life, it was your  *
                    cover.  You were allowed to have  *
                    your  boyfriend  because it helped  *
                    the cover seem real.                                                                                    58.


                                  NIKITA
                    You promised as long as he didn t 
                    know anything, he would be safe. *

                                    MICHAEL *
                      I promised nothing.  I warned you 
                    not to get emotionally attached.

                                  NIKITA
                    You mean the way you did?  With me?

      Nikita moves toward him, gently.  He thumbs the hammer back. *

                                    MICHAEL
                    Don t.

      She stops.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    Percy never asked me about Daniel, 
                     cause he knew I would warn you. I 
                    did warn you when it was time to 
                    run.  I m trying to protect you, 
                    can t you see that?

                                    NIKITA*
                    Then why are you standing in my 
                    way?  Protecting them.

                                  MICHAEL*
                    Because attacking them is suicide.  
                    Play that game, you will lose.

                                    NIKITA*
                    Not if you play it with me.  I know    *
                    you re not blind to what Division s  *
                    become.  It used to be the lesser  *
                    evil, now Percy s driven it into  *
                    the lead.  *

                                  MICHAEL*
                    I thought you were in this for  *
                      revenge... *

                                  NIKITA
                    I m doing this because no one else  *
                    can.  Daniel being gone just means  *
                    I ve got nothing to lose.  Revenge  *
                    won t bring him back, just like it  *
                    won t bring your family back.  *

                                    MICHAEL
                    Leave my family out of this. *                                                                                    59.


                                  NIKITA *
                    But isn t that why you re in this?   *
                    To avenge them?

                                    MICHAEL *
                    This isn t about me. *

      But Michael is wavering.  Nikita softens, takes another step. *

                                  NIKITA
                    You were good to me, Michael. We 
                    were good... together.  Whatever 
                    hold Percy has over you, whatever 
                    you feel you owe him... let it go.

      Michael considers her for a long beat.

                                    MICHAEL
                    You know I can t.

                                  NIKITA
                    Then let me go.  Or stop me now.*

      Michael lowers his gun.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I ll let you get a head start.  If 
                    we meet again... I can t promise 
                    what ll happen.

                                  NIKITA
                    I can.

      Nikita pulls a .25 strapped to her thigh and SHOOTS Michael 
      just under the shoulder.  He s knocked to his knees. 

      Nikita walks up, keeping him in her sights.

                                  NIKITA (CONT D)
                    It s a good wound.  They ll believe 
                    you tried to stop me.

      She picks up his gun from the ground.  Shrugs.

                                  NIKITA (CONT D)
                    Just trying to protect you.

      Nikita runs to Michael s car, gets in and reverses it out of 
      the alley as he slowly stands.  The headlights pull out, 
      dropping him into darkness.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:                                                                                    60.


      INT. DIVISION - BRIEFING - DAY

      An old photo of NIKITA is on the SMARTboard.  Percy walks in 
      front of it, addressing the room, stacked with PERSONNEL.

                                  PERCY
                    This is our new priority target.  
                    Threat level six.  Every operative 
                    engaged yellow or lower will be on 
                    this full-time.  Michael will be 
                    heading the detail.

      Reveal Michael sitting, arm in a sling.  Amanda is nearby.  
      We note Roan as well as some other faces.

                                  PERCY (CONT D)
                    I m also activating our assets 
                    overseas.  Someone is running her, 
                    and I want to know who.  There s 
                    only a handful of organizations who 
                    possess the intelligence capability 
                    to infiltrate us.  I want her head, 
                    and I want all of theirs.  This is 
                    war.  Get to work.

      As everyone stands, we...

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

      INT. HIDE-OUT - DAY

      Nikita sits at her desk, having just put on some MUSIC.  She 
      closes her eyes.  Her computer CHIRPS.  She opens them.  

      ON MONITOR - a window opens, and those familiar CODE 
      CHARACTERS roll out, then decipher themselves:   Nice Job, 
      Ms. Legendary. 

      Nikita shoots up straight, types, angry.   Log Off Now.   

      INT. DIVISION - COMPUTER LAB - SAME TIME

      ON MONITOR -  Log off Now  appears in a small black window 
      (known as a shell) in the middle of a typing tutor program.  
      The font is crude, DOS-like, as it represents a hidden 
      backdoor deep within the network.

      REVEAL ALEX at the computer.  She types,  Chill, Sensei.  
      Escape attempt sealed the deal, just like u said.  They 
      suspect nothing.   

      A beat later, Nikita s response:  They will.  Never forget 
      what I taught you.  LOG OFF.                                                                                     61.


      Alex smirks, and just as we are reeling from the realization 
      that Alex is the one helping Nikita, Alex sees Michael 
      walking by.  She clicks off the shell.  Her computer monitor 
      just looks like a normal typing tutor now.

      Alex slumps back, pretending to be the sullen new recruit 
      again, and gives the keyboard a thump.

                                  ALEX
                    Never gonna learn this.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Someone else told me that, once.  
                    She was wrong, too.
                          (off Alex s shrug)
                    Remember, you re just getting 
                    started.

      Michael keeps walking.  Alex s eyes follow him.  

                                  ALEX
                          (under her breath)
                    Damn right.

      Just who is this girl?

      INT. HIDE-OUT - DAY

      Nikita leans back in her chair, pensive.  She is still 
      holding the gun she shot Michael with.  She exhales.

                                  NIKITA
                    Here we go.

      She pops out the clip, and lays it on her desk, right next to 
      a plastic CHIPMUNK mask.  The same one used in the opening 
      heist.  Push in on that as the MUSIC RISES, and we...

      FADE TO BLACK
