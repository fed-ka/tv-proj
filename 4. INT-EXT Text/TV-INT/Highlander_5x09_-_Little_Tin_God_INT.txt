      The full-out rehearsal of a GOSPEL CHOIR fills the space
      with explosive rhythms and joy.  Among them DEREK WORTH,
      19, black, a glorious tenor whose voice soars above the
      rest.

                                            DEREK
                              (sings)
                        My Lord he done just what he said He
                        healed the sick and raised the dead...

      REVEREND THOMAS BELL, 50's, black, the Choir Director,
      stands at the piano, his face lit as he guides his singers.

                                            BELL
                              (singing along)
                        Jesus Christ the King of Heaven
                        Jesus Christ the King of All.

      The pews are sprinkled with onlookers.  In the final row
      sits GAVRIEL LARCA, a Portuguese Immortal, 40's, angular
      with piercing dark eyes and long hair.  His gaze is locked
      on

      DEREK

        transported, eyes closed, as he raises his voice in the
      final refrain:

                                            DEREK & THE CHOIR
                              (singing)
                        Every time I feel the spirit
                        Moving in my heart I will pray.

      As the last notes die away, Reverend Bell smiles up at his
      charges.

                                            BELL
                            (with a smile)
                        Hallelujah and amen.

      Rehearsal is over.  The choir members break ranks, pulling
      off their robes to reveal a collection of casual clothes. 
      As they head out we see

      LARCA

      Leave his pew and move to the door.

      DEREK

      Gathers up the robes and songbooks, generally neatening
      up.

                                            BELL
                        Well done, Derek.  You truly lift up
                        your voice with a joyful noise.

                                            DEREK
                            (shy)
                        Thank you, Reverend Bell.

                                            BELL
                            (with a smile)
                        Don't thank me, thank the Lord. 
                        He's the one who gave you your gift.

                                            DEREK
                        Amen to that.  I'll see you tomorrow
                        night.

                                            BELL
                        Don't be late.  Libby's been cooking
                        for two days.



      Cold.  Sterile.  Three bodies lie on steel tables, TAGS on
      their toes.  The room is deathly still, dark, abandoned.



                                                                (CONTINUED)96508  "Little Tin God"       4.      Final Shooting Script 9/9/96

      LARCA

      drifts into the room, dressed in a linen robe, looking
      like he's just stepped out of a Titian painting.  He looms
      over one of the tables and lifts back the SHEET.

      DEREK

      Gasps back to life, a harsh, unexpected breath.  He looks
      up --

      DEREK'S POV

      Larca towers above him, silhouetted by fluorescent lights
      which crown him with a halo.  His hands are firmly on
      Derek's chest.  His voice resonant, impressive:

                                            LARCA
                        Rise up, Derek.

      RESUME SCENE

      Derek props himself up, looking at himself.  Then to the
      bodies beside him.

                                            DEREK
                        I'm alive.

                                            LARCA
                        You are now.

                                            DEREK
                              (looking around)
                        Where am I?

                                            LARCA
                        In the morgue.

                                            DEREK
                            (a quaver)
                        I was shot.

      His hands go to his unmarked chest.

                                            LARCA
                        You were dead.
                              (beat)
                        But I have healed your wounds so
                        that you may glorify my Name.  I
                        have brought you safely through the
                        shadows of the Valley of Death, and
                        I have called upon you to serve me
                        in a Holy War against my enemy.

      Derek feels his jaw drop as he stares up at the imposing
      figure of Larca.

                        I am God, Derek.

      Derek's eyes widen with awe, his mind reeling.  Hold on
      Larca's penetrating gaze.

                                            LARCA
                        I am God.

                                          ACT ONE

      FADE IN:



      MacLeod and Larca dine.  Sumptuous pilings of food crowd a
      colorful rug.  Everything is congenial.  Larca's wife serves
      them.  As she pours wine for MacLeod from an ornate gold
      pitcher:

                                            MACLEOD
                        Thank you.

      She does not respond.

                                            LARCA
                        She understands nothing of your
                          language.  Or of your world.
                              (fondly)
                        All she knows, all she has ever known,
                        is this village.

      He reaches out, touches her face gently.  She gazes at him
      with a mixture of adoration and submission.

                                            LARCA
                        She is called Coyantu.  Born on the
                        day of Coya Raymi, Festival of the
                        Moon.  It is a time of great
                          celebration for the Moche.

      Larca holds out a cup for Coyantu.  She obediently reaches
      for a silver pitcher and pours him wine.  He nods to her
      and smiles.

                                            LARCA
                            (re Coyantu)
                        I saw her born.  I watched her grow
                        into this beautiful woman.  And I
                        shall cherish her until the day of
                        her death.

                                            MACLEOD
                        You're a lucky man.

                                            LARCA
                        To them I am more than a man.

                                            MACLEOD
                        You don't really think you're their
                        God.

      Larca turns to Coyantu.

                                            LARCA
                            (in Spanish)
                        Quien soy yo?

                                            COYANTU
                        Usted es dios.

                                            LARCA
                            (to MacLeod)
                        You see...
                              (beat)
                        The Moche are an ancient people. 
                        Their science and arts rivaled the
                        best of Inca, yet they produced theirs
                        a thousand years earlier.  Some of
                        their traditions go back a hundred
                          generations.  They called me God,
                        who was I to argue?

      He holds up a piece of jewelry for MacLeod to see.  On it,
      an image of a man, arms outflung, surrounded by jagged
      bolts.

                                            LARCA
                          Remarkable, is it not?  It was cast
                          Fourteen hundred years ago.

      MacLeod examines the pendant.  It does look remarkably
      like an Immortal receiving a Quickening.

                                            MACLEOD
                        So you're not the first one of us to
                        make these people treat you as a
                        God.  That doesn't make it right.

                        What makes a God, MacLeod?  What but
                        the faith of his followers?  And
                        people need faith.

                            (re the village)
                        Look around you.  For three hundred
                        years I have protected them.  Hidden
                        them from the likes of Cortez and
                        those other butchers.  They survive
                        because of me.  They have grown strong
                        and remained free.

                                            MACLEOD
                        They may be strong, but they're not
                        free.  They're your slaves.

                        And I am theirs.
                              (beat)
                        They are my people.  They choose to
                        worship me.  And in return, they are
                        cared for.  Think about it.  Isn't
                        that a god's covenant with his chosen?

                        I think you've been in the jungle
                        too long.

      Larca maintains a steady gaze, his mood darkening.

                                            LARCA
                        Will you challenge me because of

      MacLeod rises.

                        great secret.  A man like that...

      Larca shrugs eloquently.

                        Larca, the man is sick.  I need to
                        get him to a doctor.  I swear he

      MACLEOD'S POV

      The interior of the hut slowly comes into focus as MacLeod
      awakes, shaking off the effects of the drug.  The remains
      of the dinner are on the rug in front of him.  And leaning
      on the wall, out of reach, his sword.

      NEW ANGLE

      MacLeod can't move, he's securely tied to a stake.  He
      kicks out angrily, knocking aside bowls of food, struggling
      with his bonds.  No luck.

      From outside he hears a SCREAM.  Paco.

                                            PACO (O.S.)
                        No... No, I beg you!

      MacLeod strains to see over his shoulder, out the open
      window into the square.



      MacLeod desperately tries to free himself.  But he's still
      sluggish, and his bonds are tight.



      MacLeod slumps back in anger and disgust.

      His head bowed, eyes open, the fear and doubt clear on his
      face.  His hands, clasped together, squeeze hard, as though
      trying to hold his thoughts and emotions in.

                                            MACLEOD (CONT.)
                        We didn't ask to be dragged into
                        your village.
                              (beat)
                        Your people didn't get his strength,
                        Larca.  They got his fever.

      Larca closes in, his eyes gleaming as the idea strikes
      him:

                                            LARCA
                        And maybe your Quickening will cure
                        them.

                                            MACLEOD
                        It won't.

                                            LARCA
                        Who's to say?

      He raises his blade.  Suddenly, WHHHFFFT.

      LARCA

      Is hit in the neck with a dart from a blowgun.  He pulls
      it out, stunned.  Looks at it in his hand for a frozen
      moment, then....

      Larca crumples to his knees as the poison takes effect on
      his system.  Coyantu stands at the doorway SCREAMING.

      MacLeod looks out beyond her:

      MACLEOD'S POV

      A villager lowers his blowgun.  Behind him, a crowd stands
      with knives and spears, poised to unleash their rage.

      The phosphorous smoke that billows from the fires provides
      an eerie backlight.

      RESUME SCENE

      As Larca collapses, his blade drops.  MacLeod swiftly
      maneuvers his bound hands in front of him and uses the
      blade to cut himself free.

      MacLeod retrieves his katana.  As the villagers charge the
      hut, Coyantu throws herself over Larca, protecting him.

      The villagers mob the fallen God.  The man who aimed the
      blowgun picks up Larca's fallen cutlass.  He turns on
      MacLeod.

      MACLEOD

      Kicks at the back of the hut, trying to breach it.  He
      breaks through the wall.



      The file in front of Dawson is forgotten as he stares raptly
      at MacLeod, fascinated by the tale.

                                            MACLEOD
                          I barely got away with my life.  I
                        had no food, no water.  It took me
                        almost a month to reach Huaral.

                        If I weren't Immortal, I wouldn't
                        Have made it.

      There's a beat as he shakes off the bleak memory.  Then:

                                            MACLEOD
                        What have you got on Larca since
                        then?

                                            DAWSON
                        There's nothing after 1828 until
                        about two years ago, he turned up
                        In Lima.

                                            MACLEOD
                        What about his "disciples?"

                                            DAWSON
                        Zero.

      MacLeod tosses him a look: why not?

                          legend... about two guys in Italy
                        who went at in one of Isis' temples.

                        It's not their fault.  They don't

                        he's the one who made them Immortal.

      RESUME - SCENE

      Derek stares at his hand in wonder.  Larca reaches under
      Derek's chin and gently lifts him until their eyes meet.

                                            LARCA
                        Now do you believe me?

      tone evangelical and infectious:

                                        ACT THREE

      FADE IN:



      Derek is on his knees, struggling to sing through tears.

                                            DEREK
                        That saved a wretch like me.

      ANOTHER ANGLE

      At the rear of the church, Reverend Bell enters.  He pauses
      to straighten a few pamphlets on a rack, then reacts as he
      hears the soft strains from the front:

                                            DEREK
                        I once was lost, but now I'm found

      Reverend Bell moves down the aisle toward the kneeling
      figure.  As he nears, he adds his voice to Derek's:

                                            DEREK & BELL
                        Was blind but now I see.

      Derek reacts to the voice, turns to look up at Bell, tears
      streaming down his face.

      REVEREND BELL

      Stares.  He doesn't back away.  His hand goes, almost
      unconsciously, to touch the tiny gold cross at his neck.

                                            BELL
                            (a breath)
                        Derek?

      Derek hastily wipes away his tears, tries for a casual
      smile.

                                            DEREK
                        Yeah, Rev, it's me.  Crazy, huh?

      Reverend Bell sits next to Derek.  He gingerly reaches out
      and touches him.

      Walks in from the back of the church.  Derek puts himself

                        You should go, Reverend.

      Bell, wanting to protect Derek, steps in front of him.

                        And when he sings... you can almost
                        feel the Lord coming down just to
                        listen.

      His voice cracks with emotion.

                        Larca counted on Derek's faith.  He

                        This man.  Larca.  Does he have long

                        He took him away from everything and
                          everyone he loved, to make him into
                        this thing, this killer.

                        And he thinks he has the right.

      MacLeod can sense a man nearing a crisis of faith.

                        not what it means.  Larca's the lie.

      FADE IN:



      Candles flicker, throwing dancing shadows across the walls. 
      Larca stands by the altar, Enrique and Luke flanking him,
      Derek kneeling before him.

                                            LARCA
                        To be ready for your battle, my child,
                        you must cleanse yourself of all
                        doubt.  You must be pure in heart,
                        pure in belief, pure in strength.

      DEREK

      Looks up at him, calm, face composed.

                                            DEREK
                        I'm ready.

      Larca is about to answer, then reacts as the door at the
      back of the chapel slams open.

                                            LARCA
                        Who dares?

      Derek turns to see what Larca's looking at.

      It's Reverend Bell, light glinting off his blade.

                            (to Larca, in fury)
                        What did you tell him?  Did you tell
                        him he'd go to Hell if he didn't
                        follow you?

                        What more can God offer his soldiers?

      Bell's eyes narrow at the sacrilege.

                        You're not God.  You're an
                          abomination.

      He raises the gun toward Larca.

                                            DEREK
                          Reverend, no!  He'll kill you!

                        ground, but you're not safe from me.

      He steps forward, gun aimed at Larca, machete glinting in
      his other hand.  Larca holds his ground, but his eyes are
      locked on the gun.

                                            LARCA
                        Will you desecrate the House of the

      Bell shoots.

      ENRIQUE

      Jumps in front of Larca and takes the bullet for him.  He
      crumples, dead.

      Luke hesitates, his eyes on Enrique's still form.

                                            LARCA
                        Now! 

      Luke is frozen with fear.  Bell's finger is on the trigger,
      Larca in his sights.  Then --

      DEREK

      Steps in front of Bell and puts his shaking hand on the
      gun, its barrel pointed into his belly.

      BELL

      Can't bring himself to fire into Derek.

                        Derek!  Get away!

      Bell tries to wrench the gun free and get a clear shot at
      Larca, but Derek hangs on.

                        I can't let you do this.

      Larca steps up beside them.  He puts his hand over Derek's,
      wrenches the gun away from Bell.

      Bell tries to raise the machete; Larca takes it away from
      him easily, flings it across the room.

                            (to Derek)
                        Take him outside.  Beyond the
                          Cemetery.

      Bell reacts.  He knows what that means.  Derek takes his
      arm and pulls him out.



      MacLeod storms in, ready to throw down the gauntlet.

      No answer.  The cavernous hall echoes back his voice.  No
      one's there.



      MacLeod and Dawson are having coffee.  MacLeod is showing
      Dawson a postcard from some tropical island.

                        got one hell of a slider.

      Dawson grins.  Pulls out a similar postcard from under the
      bar.

      MacLeod stares.  Gets it.

                        I guess that's one way of being sure
                        he won't tell anyone what he saw.

                        history were just Immortals with

                        It's not.

                        But how can you be so sure?

                        I could make a lot of arguments,
                        quote a lot of smart people, Joe.

                        to something else.

                        Faith, Joe.  Faith.
