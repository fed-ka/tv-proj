          SARAH, WALT and DANA are already there chatting with a
            concerned PURDY as Bruce enters...

                                        BRUCE
                        Hi guys...

                                        PURDY
                        Ah, good, that's everyone then.
                                (sighs)
                        I think you all know why we're
                        here...

                                (to Bruce, re: Johnny)
                        Has anyone talked with him lately?

                                        BRUCE
                        He's not into talking.  Or
                        listening.

                                        SARAH
                        If you ask me, he still hasn't
                        gotten over Kate's death.

                                        BRUCE
                        It's Kate... but it's more than
                        Kate.  It's all of it.  It's all
                        the visions.  Every day of his
                        life.  Hundreds of them.

                                        PURDY
                                (sighs)
                        ...God has asked a lot of him... 
                        Under the same conditions, any of
                        us might begin to lose our way.

                                        DANA
                        You mean the way out.  He's barely
                        left his house for the last few
                        months.

                                        WALT
                        And the only people he lets in 
                        are the kids he's tutoring in
                        science this summer.

                                        SARAH
                        He just... doesn't want to touch
                          anyone...
                                (and even worse)
                        ...and doesn't want anyone to
                        touch him.

          More than anyone, Sarah can't bear to think of Johnny in
          this fashion...

                        I'd like to propose an
                          intervention.  His best friends
                          confronting him as a group.  I've
                        done several for members of the
                          congregation...

                                        BRUCE
                        We have to get him out of that
                          house...

                                        PURDY
                        Agreed.  I'm happy to offer the
                          Alliance retreat up at Moosehead...

                                        BRUCE
                        I'll get him there.

                                        DANA
                        How do you throw a surprise party
                        for a psychic?

                                        BRUCE
                        You don't let him touch you.



          Wearing a lab apron, protective goggles hanging around
          his neck, looking at us through a small maze of science
          lab equipment, a wry smile on his face.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Behold, a tablespoonful of ordinary
                        flour, just like you might bake
                        cookies with.

          Johnny picks up a bunsen burner and torches the spoonful
          of flour.  Reveal we're:



          Johnny has converted his dining room into a science class
          for a group of high school students he's tutoring - a
          HALF DOZEN KIDS failing chemistry - something he's
          determined not to let happen.  His dining room table is
          covered in lab gear, beakers, glass tubing, a distilling
          rig, a bunsen burner, several 3D models of simple
          molecules.

          Behind Johnny is a rolling white board covered in a diagram
          of flour and oxygen molecules, along with the words;
            PARTICLE, DISPERSION, COMPACTION, FLAMMABLE, INFLAMMABLE,
          each with a dictionary definition written underneath.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Observe what happens when we apply
                        heat -- doesn't burn does it? 
                        Why?

          THE KIDS

          Kind of a rough bunch, not your typical science nerds, in
          fact just the opposite, but they're into it, drawn in by
          Johnny's enthusiasm... and the prospect of blowing up the
          house.

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        The tiny flour particles are too
                          compact, there's no room for oxygen
                          molecules to get in there to feed
                        the chemical reaction necessary
                        for a fire.  We have plenty of
                        heat, but no oxygen.  Not much
                        fun huh?

          During the above, the doorbell rings.

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                                (yelling)
                        It's open.

          Bruce pokes his head in, surprised at what he finds.

                                        BRUCE
                        Hey...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Oh good it's just you.  I was
                        worried it might be the Fire
                          Marshall.  Welcome to Mr. Wizard's
                        science lab.

                                        BRUCE
                        Don't let me interrupt.

          Johnny continues with his demonstration as Bruce watches;
          he picks up a large glass tube, about a quarter inch in
          diameter and two feet long.  As Bruce and the students
          watch in curiosity, he dips one end of the tube into the
          flour, so that the end of the tube is stuffed full of
          about a half inch of powder.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Same flour as before.

          Next he places the other end of the tube in his mouth.

                                        GOTH GIRL
                        Whasup Mr. Smith, you gonna smoke
                        that?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No... I'm going to disperse it.  
                          Everybody step back.

          With a bit of a mad professor grin, Johnny aims the glass
          tube at the bunsen burner and BLOWS.  The flour dust hits
          the flame of the burner and EXPLODES in a ball of fire.

          The kids all recoil and duck, eyes wide.

                                        GOTH GIRL
                        Cool!

          Johnny and Bruce exchange a mischievous look.  Bruce almost
          forgets for a moment why he's there.

                                        JOHNNY
                        When I blew the flour out of the
                        tube, the compacted particles
                        became dispersed allowing the
                        oxygen molecules in the air to
                        feed the fire.

          During the above, he circles dispersion up on the
          whiteboard, then checks his watch.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Okay, that's it for today.  DON'T
                        TRY THIS AT HOME!  See you all
                        Monday.

          Johnny cleans up... as the kids leave, murmuring to each
          other about the awesome demonstration.  Bruce moves to
            Johnny...

                                        BRUCE
                                (appreciating him)
                        I've never actually seen the old
                        John in action.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (with a trace of loss)
                        I was a pretty good teacher in my
                        day.

                                        BRUCE
                        You still are.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (without conviction)
                        Yeah.

          Johnny moves away from these feelings, physically moving
          away from Bruce who represents responsibility he doesn't
          want to face... Bruce trails him --

                                        BRUCE
                        Hey, let's get out of here.  I've
                        planned a day trip for us.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Naw, I really think I'll stick
                        close to home this weekend. 
                        Holiday traffic and all that. 
                        And there's a triple header on
                        ESPN I've really been looking
                        forward to...

                                        BRUCE
                        You've been sticking close to
                        home going on months now, John.  
                        Come on, you need a little fresh
                        air.

                        I can't control things outside
                        that door, Bruce.

                          Stillson and Armageddon and world
                        where someone like Kate has to
                        die just so someone else can live. 
                        At least here, I have some

    77CONTINUOUS

          Johnny turns to his friend, this is a thanks for your
          concern but it's not going to work moment...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, look, really, I'm glad you're
                        here, it's not that I don't
                          appreciate...

          He tries to put his arm around his friend... but Bruce
          weaves out of his touch...

                                        JOHNNY
                        What?
                                (is the problem?)

          Johnny looks at him curiously... realizing Bruce is trying
          to avoid being touched.

                                        BRUCE
                        Come on, John... let's go for a
                        ride...

          He reaches out to touch Bruce and Bruce avoids him again...

                        What, were we going to pick up
                          everyone else on the way?  No
                        thanks.  I don't need an
                          intervention.

                                        BRUCE
                        Your friends are worried about
                        you and you're gonna hear what
                        they have to say.  And when we
                        get there, you're gonna act
                        surprised.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not going.

                        Look, John... one way or the other,
                        you're going.  I'm fully committed
                        to putting you in that car... and
                        I'll do anything it takes to get
                        you into that car.  We can do
                        this any way you like...

                        If you let me go, I'll tell you
                        how you're gonna break your leg.

                        Big white cast... clump... clump...
                          clumping around for six weeks... 
                        I can save you all that pain...

                        Liar.  You didn't see any broken
                        leg.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Suit yourself.

          As Bruce pulls off the road into a gas station...

                        You know how your skin gets all
                        red and itchy under the cast and
                        you can't scratch it...?

                                        BRUCE
                        That's not funny.



          A bell over the door tinkles as Johnny enters, moves
          immediately to the counter... where a rural faced MANAGER
          mans the cash register... there are large windows around
          the place so you can see outside... several customers are
            eating...

                                (urgent, sotto)
                        I'm being abducted.  The African-
                          American man outside attacked me
                        and forced me into his car.
                                (the man starts to
                                look out a window)
                        Don't look at him.  Call the
                        police.  Um, State police.  Not
                        the county sheriff.

                        Are you serious?

          The bell over the door tinkles again as Bruce enters...

                        And I'll take this...

          Johnny quickly grabs a bag of chips from beside the

                        You want to get a couple sodas to

                          Anything you say, mister.

          Bruce doesn't notice the attendant staring at him with

                        Think you can ring us up now...

          to ring them up... on the exchange, RAMP TO JOHNNY FACE...

          as he realizes Bruce and the manager are looking at him
            curiously...  And Johnny hates this... he hates this...
          he's thinking, again?  He sighs, has no choice, glances
          at Bruce... then back to the manager and says quietly...

                                        JOHNNY
                        There's going to be a storm.  A
                        big storm, like a hurricane or a
                        tornado...

          The man just stares at him, this has to be some kind of
          joke...

                        I'm not sure when.  But soon.  It
                        will not be safe here. 

                                        BRUCE
                        This is Johnny Smith.  I've known
                        him a long time.  He has psychic
                        abilities.  Believe him.

                          A minute ago, he told me you were
                          abducting him.

                        He... told you... that...?

          He laughs embarrassed...

                        Is this a rib?  Did Wally at the
                        car lot send you over here to...

                        when the storm comes and it will
                        come... remember what I said...
                        don't wait, don't think... get
                          everyone to safety right away. 
                        Please.  People will die here if
                        you do not take cover.

          In an office by the tower... it's full of high tech weather
          systems, Doppler radar, a computer monitor displaying
          weather maps and such... the meteorologist is an attractive
          woman dressed casually in jeans and a T-shirt... we'll
          call her TONI for old times sake... they've just told her
          about Johnny's vision and she's incredulous but trying to
          be polite.  Johnny lets Bruce carry the ball, observes
          from his dark emotional place...

                                        TONI
                        I don't know what to tell you,
                        but there's nothing on the weather
                        map that even begins to suggest...

                        out an emergency advisory based
                        on... a psychic vision... here,

                        We use a very sophisticated system
                        called the Mesocyclone Detection
                          Algorithm to identify potential

                        Of course, we're wrong sometimes... 
                        We're The Weatherman.  But we've
                        only had one M-D-A detection
                        failure in this region I know of
                        and that was eight years ago...

                          Cobbosseecontee...

                        That was the day of my accident.

          He glances at Bruce who reacts... a curious coincidence
          to be sure.

                        Who said anything about a suit?  

                                        SARAH
                        Maybe we should do an intervention
                        for you while we're waiting for
                        Johnny to get here.

                        I'm sure Dana recalls... from
                        earlier visits... that we keep a
                        variety of swimwear for guests...
                        if you're interested, I'm sure
                        you'll find something that fits...

          Dana grins evenly at Sarah and clearly her line about not
          wearing suits was just to provoke a response from Sarah...

                        If you're hungry, the chef sent
                        up some lovely salmon for lunch...
                        please make yourself at home...

          The people move inside... Purdy walks over to the
          lakeside... takes in some fresh air... takes in the majesty
          of the lake...

                            a constitutional along the lake...

          After a beat, something falls out of the sky next to him...
          and splats by his feet... he reacts with a start, looks
          down to see --

                        To know.  And never be wrong. 
                        There is no hope left.  I mean
                        how many times have we've been
                        through this, Bruce?  We tell
                        them what's gonna happen... they
                        say it's impossible... they show
                        you why it's impossible... and
                        then it happens...

          He pulls off the road (they're near a culvert) but for
          the moment we stay in the car and their pov, Hitchcock
          style.

                                        BRUCE
                        Man, it's really coming down.

          But it gets worse.  The ice is the size of golf balls
          now... and it's really coming down... the windshield cracks
          with the impact of a baseball sized ice block... BANG!...
          they recoil... another BANG and a crack... another...
          BANG!... and there are holes where the ice struck... and
          it's scary as hell... BANG, BANG, BANG...

          And the wind is howling outside...

                        Part Two.  The boy I was with was
                        a big Sly fan. 
                                (smiles at the memory)
                          ...Bobby Tucci...  He was older
                        and I wasn't supposed to be out
                        with him, my parents didn't like
                        him and I'd lied to them about
                        where I was going... anyway, we're
                        coming out... and the sky is a
                        dark mustard green... and
                        everything is still... you could
                        just feel something was wrong. 
                        And then we saw it... like a shoe-
                        string in the sky... and Bobby,
                        jerk, he takes off... just takes
                        off and leaves me standing there...

                                        BRUCE
                        See, your parents were right about
                        him...

                        That's exactly what I was thinking.
                        And I start to run across the
                          street... and I hear myself saying
                        'I'm sorry, I'm sorry'... as though
                        this storm was coming for me...
                        you know, because I'd been out
                        with Bobby Tucci...!

                                (she laughs)
                        I duck into a Shakey's Pizza with
                        a birthday party for some kids...
                        all with silver party hats on...
                        and we crawl under tables...  One
                        kid is eating pepperoni pizza
                        under the table like nothing is
                          happening... and I'm closing my
                        eyes swearing out loud that I'll
                        never go out with Bobby again...

                                        BRUCE
                        Did you?

                                        TONI
                        Hell, no,  I know better than to
                        tempt the fates.

                        When it was over, we came out --
                        the other side of the street was
                        gone... it was gone... the movie
                        theater I just came out of was
                        gone... and our side was
                          untouched...  
                                (beat)
                        It's hard to accept the idea of
                          random... we all like
                          explanations... a way to make
                        sense of things that don't make
                          sense... and I guess I've spent
                        my life trying to make sense of
                        that day...
                                (glances at Johnny)
                        And you haven't made my job any
                        easier today.  

          She reacts as she sees something up ahead...

                                        TONI
                        Uh oh, what's this?



          Thunder continuing... the group is assembled...

                                        SARAH
                          I wonder where Johnny and Bruce
                        are... I hope they aren't caught
                        in this...

          Dana at the window... she's dressed again... looking out,
          her face is illuminated...

                                        DANA
                        Have I ever mentioned that I have
                        a thing about thunder and
                        lightning?  Ever since my dad
                        left me home alone in a storm
                        when I was five...

          Another louder boom of a thunder... the others react as
          the lights in the cabin go out...

                                        DANA
                        Okay.  Does anyone have a doll I
                        can hold?



          Thunder rumbling in the distance... Walt tries the phone,
          it's still out... Purdy is lighting candles...



            Candlelight.  Finding Sarah with Dana who is shuddering
          with each storm sound... Sarah is pouring a bottle of
          sherry into a glass for her...

                                        SARAH
                        This'll calm you down...

                        Cooking sherry?

                                        SARAH
                                (recalling Dana's
                                  earlier line)
                        You'd be surprised what you can
                        find in 'the kitchen'.

                                        DANA
                        Touch .

          She drinks a shot.

                                        DANA
                                (re: the sherry)
                        Oh that's bad.  I'll have another.

          Sarah pours...

                                        DANA
                        I hope you don't do a lot of this
                        during the day.

                        secret because if his flock knew
                        he had alcoholic beverages at his

                        I can be his best friend.  You
                        can't.  He's too deep inside you.

                        how you might break it gently to

                        Gentle Ben face of his when you
                        tell the poor bastard.  Walt's a
                        good man.  He deserves someone
                        who can really love him and only
                        him and you hate yourself for not
                        being able to give him that.

                                        SARAH
                        You're wrong.  In fact, Walt and
                        I are talking about having a baby.

          Dana's eyes narrow.  And in a way Sarah is putting it out
          there not just to convince Dana but to convince herself.

          But Sarah has not made up her mind about this baby - in
          part because she knows it draws the final line between
          her and Johnny and she just doesn't know if she can do
          that yet.  And there's the old nagging wonder if having a
          baby is a way to "save" this marriage - would she be doing
          it for the right reasons?  All these considerations cannot
          be voiced here but they linger in the silence that follows
          the announcement.  Finally to fill the void --

                                        SARAH
                                  (uncomfortable, not
                                at all harsh)
                        Not that it's any business of
                        yours. I don't even know why I
                        told you.

                        Don't you?

          Sarah gives her a look that says she's had enough of this,
          puts down her drink and exits...

                        Damn mouth.

          She pours another drink for herself...



          As Sarah moves in... the front door suddenly opens and
          Johnny, Bruce and Toni come in... candles lit everywhere...

                        Johnny.  Well, I know this looks
                          a little strange... it isn't
                        exactly what we intended... but
                        your friends have all gathered
                        here today to...

                        Yes, well, I know how you must

                        No, he means we can't do this
                        now... this is Toni Donahue, a

                        There's a tornado forming along
                        the lake... maybe more than one...

          Dana who has entered downs the last of her sherry at that
          news...  Walt goes to look out the window...

                                        TONI
                        Stay away from the windows...  is
                        there a basement in this cabin...

                                        PURDY
                          A storage cellar... there isn't
                        much room...

                                        TONI
                        It'll have to do...

                                        PURDY
                        Yes.  Of course.  Through the
                          kitchen.

          The sound of wind building outside... the door that Walt
          was going to look out blows open... some candles blow
          out... Purdy moves instinctively to help close the door...

                                        TONI
                        Leave it!

          They move toward the kitchen... another door bursts open
          as they pass...



                                        PURDY
                                (nervous)
                        This structure has been here for
                        decades... through many storms...
                        I'm certain that...

                                        TONI
                        Sir, we've never seen a storm
                        like this in Maine.

          It sounds like a freight train approaching outside... a
          crack... crack...

          They look up... to see --

          P.O.V. - THE CEILING - PLANKS OF THE WOOD ROOF

          are being pulled up... one...two...three... the sound of
          the freight train growing louder now that it's open
          above... lightning flashing through...


          ANGLE THEY PUSH AHEAD... SCARED...


          BUT NOW THE ENTIRE ROOF ABOVE THE HALLWAY IS SUCKED UP
          AND AWAY


    57A57AOMITTED

          and just as they enter... a tree branch crashes through
          one of windows in front of them...


          THE OTHER WINDOWS SHAKE VIOLENTLY AND BREAK


            REACTIONS

                                        TONI
                        Down on the floor... keep moving...

          They are deeper into the kitchen now... Purdy leads the
          way, followed by Toni, Sarah, Walt, Bruce and Dana (in
          that order).  Johnny brings up the rear.


          GLASSES AND PLATES CRASH AROUND OUR PEOPLE

          Suddenly an entire tree comes crashing through the ceiling
          landing between Sarah and Walt, barely missing them, but
          separating them.  The storm rages outside, the wind
            intensifies.

          PURDY, TONI AND SARAH

          make it into the stone hallway.  Purdy directs the women
          toward the storage cellar door.

                                        PURDY
                                (to the others)
                        Keep coming, we're almost there!

          Walt and Bruce crawl under the fallen tree and make to
          the stone hallway... Purdy goes to the storage room...  
            lighting, thunder outside... the wind intensifies more... 
          rain and hail falling on them... they're wet and it's
          slippery...


          DRAWERS RATTLE AND SHAKE AND FINALLY OPEN AND KNIVES AND
          FORKS AND SPOONS FLY OUT...


          JOHNNY AND DANA

          crawl under the tree heading toward the hallway... but
          suddenly Dana is sucked toward the open windows... she
          grabs onto the refrigerator handle... but it's a fearsome
          pull... she's blown vertical, feet first toward the
          windows... Johnny reaches out for Walt's hand across the
          river of wind... Walt links arms with Bruce and they brace
          themselves against the stone wall to hold onto Johnny...
          Johnny grabs Dana's hand just as --


          THE ENTIRE WALL BEHIND THE REFRIGERATOR IS SUCKED AWAY

            revealing the black storm raging outside...


          THE REFRIGERATOR SUDDENLY RISES OUT OF SIGHT

          And Dana goes with it... and would be gone now... if it
          weren't for Bruce and Walt holding Johnny holding onto
          her...


          HER FACE - FEARFUL


          JOHNNY'S FACE - STRAINING


          WALT AND BRUCE'S FACES - STRAINING

          finally the storm breaks its grip and Johnny pulls her
          back... and they crawl under the tree...          DEAD ZONE: THE STORM - ACT FOUR - 6/11/03 - 2nd BLUE  53A.



          A small storage room with a few down stairs as they crowd
          in... Johnny is the last one...  but he doesn't go in...
          he starts to close the door behind Bruce...

                                        BRUCE
                        What... what are you...

          But before he can react... Johnny shuts the door and
          latches it so Bruce can't stop him... he turns toward the
          sound of the roaring freight train...
