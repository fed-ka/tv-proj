RESTAURANT - DAY
Louise pulls out in a green '66 T-Bird in mint condition.
THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY
Louise's green '66 T-Bird convertible pulls into the driveway
of Thelma's house.
The garage door goes up and Thelma is
standing in the garage with all her gear.
A suitcase that
looks like it might explode, fishing gear, a cooler, a
lantern.
Thelma's car, a beat-up gray Honda, is parked in
there, too.
Louise gets out of the driver's seat.
LOUISE
We don't need the lantern.
The place
has electricity.
THELMA
I wanna take it anyway.
Just in
case.
LOUISE
In case of what?
THELMA
In case there's some escaped psycho
killer on the loose, who cuts the
electricity off and tries to come in
and kill us.
LOUISE
(going along with her)
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern
will come in real handy.
Maybe we
could tow your car behind, in case
he steals the spark plugs.
THELMA
We'd have to.
That thing barely
makes it down the driveway.
They load everything into the car.
The trunk barely closes.
Thelma heaves all her weight against it.
They get into the
car and pull out of the driveway.
As they drive down the
street, we hear Thelma let out a long howl.
She is laughing and she sticks her arms straight up in the
air.
CAR - DAY
They are driving down the interstate.
Thelma reaches for
her purse and finds the gun.
THELMA
Louise, will you take care of the
gun?
Louise shrieks at the sight of it.
LOUISE
Why in hell did you bring that?
Thelma wonders if Louise is really that naive.
THELMA
Oh, come on, Louise... psycho killers,
bears... snakes!
I just don't know
how to use it.
So will you take
care of it?
Louise reaches over and takes the gun out of Thelma's purse
and holds it in her hand.
She tests the weight of it, and
then puts it under the seat.
Thelma puts the bullets under
the seat.
They are speeding off down the highway with the RADIO blaring.
Louise puts in a TAPE of wild R&B; MUSIC.
THELMA
Whose place is this again?
LOUISE
It's Bob's, the day manager's.
He's
gettin' a divorce, so his wife's
gettin' this place, so he's just
lettin' all his friends use it till
he has to turn over the keys.
THELMA
I've never had the chance to go out
of town without Darryl.
LOUISE
How come he let you go?
THELMA
'Cause I didn't ask him.
LOUISE
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill
you.
THELMA
Well, he has never let me go.
He
never lets me do one goddamn thing
that's any fun.
All he wants me to
do is hang around the house the whole
time while he's out doing God only
knows what.
They are both silent for a minute.
THELMA
(looking straight
ahead)
I left him a note.
I left him stuff
to microwave.
After a pause.
THELMA
I guess you haven't heard anything
from Jimmy... yet?
Louise's jaw tightens.
The car speeds up.
THELMA
...never mind.
A huge semi-tanker carrying gas passes them on the highway
and HONKS.
The mud flaps are the shiny silhouettes of naked
women.
There is a bumper sticker on the back that says:
"Lick you all over -- ten cents."
LOUISE
One of your friends?
Thelma is watching herself in the side mirror, pretending to
smoke a cigarette.
THELMA'S POV OF A SIGN alongside the road that reads "See
you in church on Sunday!"
Thelma pushes in the lighter and waits for it to pop out.
Louise gives her a sidelong glance, but does not say anything.
SILVER BULLET - NIGHT
They pull off at a place down on the right all lit up with
neon.
It's called the SILVER BULLET.
The sign flashes
COCKTAILS -- BEER -- DANCING -- FOOD.
There is a huge gravel
parking lot with lots of pickup trucks and older cars.
Even
though it's early, you can tell this place is a real night
spot.
It's already pretty crowded.
SILVER BULLET PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Harlan is hauling Thelma out the door into the parking lot.
She is pretty limp.
THELMA
Oh shit.
HARLAN
What's wrong?
THELMA
Stop.
HARLAN
What for?
THELMA
I'm spinning.
PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Thelma has been sick.
She has Harlan's handkerchief and is
wiping her mouth.
Harlan has backed off for this part, but
he's right back in there.
HARLAN
How you feelin' now, darlin'?
Harlan is leaning close to Thelma's head, and she pulls her
head away.
THELMA
I guess I'm startin' to feel a little
better.
HARLAN
Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty
good to me, too.
He pulls her to him and tries to put his arms around her.
Thelma pulls away.
THELMA
(uncomfortable)
I think I need to keep walking.
SILVER BULLET PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Harlan has led Thelma off to the far end of the parking lot.
He is trying to kiss her now.
He is pushing her arms down
and turning her head away.
THELMA
Don't.
I'm married.
I don't feel
good.
I've been sick.
HARLAN
It's okay.
I'm married, too.
Harlan is pushing himself on her now, and she is beginning
to push him away harder.
SILVER BULLET PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Harlan has now pinned Thelma against the back of a car and
is kissing her neck.
He has her ass in his hands.
He is
beginning to hump her.
She is pushing him away as hard as
she can, but he is relentless.
HARLAN
(breathing heavily)
You're beautiful.
It's okay.
I
won't hurt you.
It's okay.
THELMA
(struggling)
Stop it!
Goddamnit, I mean it!
Louise is gonna wonder where I am.
Let go!
HARLAN
Louise is alright.
LOUISE
is now standing outside the door of the Silver Bullet.
She
is looking around.
HARLAN
is pulling at Thelma's clothes.
Thelma gets one of her arms
free and hits him hard in the face.
He hits her back and
grabs her face, squeezing it hard.
HARLAN
Don't you hit me!
Don't you fucking
hit me!
There is no trace of friendliness in his face now.
He looks
mean and dangerous.
He lets go of her face and pins her
arms behind her.
He holds both of her arms with one hand.
HARLAN
You just shut up.
With his free hand, he reaches down and starts to pull her
dress up.
Thelma is still struggling and there are tears
running down her face.
THELMA
Don't hurt me.
Harlan.
Please.
HARLAN
Shut up.
He turns her around, pushing her face down onto the back of
the car.
He holds both her arms in one hand and continues
pulling her dress up over her hips.
He starts to undo his
pants as we hear the CRUNCH of gravel.
LOUISE (O.S.)
Let her go.
HARLAN
Get lost.
THELMA
Louise!
TIGHT SHOT of the barrel of Thelma's gun being pressed into
the nape of Harlan's neck.
Louise's thumb pulls back the
hammer.
LOUISE
You let her go, you fat fucking
asshole, or I'm gonna splatter your
ugly face all over this nice car.
Harlan slowly raises his hands in the air, and Thelma darts
out, pulling her dress down.
HARLAN
Now, calm down.
We were just havin'
a little fun.
Louise glances at Thelma.
Thelma shakes her head no.
LOUISE
Looks like you've got a real fucked
up idea of fun.
Now turn around.
Louise starts to back away, but the gun is still close to
his face.
His pants are undone in the front.
She is still
backing away with the gun raised.
Thelma is inching away as
well.
LOUISE
Just for the future, when a woman's
crying like that, she's not having
any fun!
Louise lowers the gun and stares at him for a second.
Then
she turns and walks away.
Thelma does, too.
HARLAN
(pulling up his pants)
Bitch.
I should have gone ahead and
fucked her.
Louise stops in her tracks.
LOUISE
What did you say?
HARLAN
I said suck my cock.
Louise takes two long strides back towards him, raises the
gun and FIRES a bullet into his face.
We hear his body HIT
the gravel parking lot.
LOUISE'S POV.
The car behind him
is splattered with blood.
Thelma and Louise are both silent.
We hear the SOUND of the nightclub in the distance.
Louise
lowers the gun.
THELMA
Oh my God.
LOUISE
Get the car.
THELMA
Jesus Christ!
Louise, you shot him.
LOUISE
Get the car!
Thelma runs to get the car.
LOUISE
(quietly, to herself)
You watch your mouth, buddy.
Thelma comes careening up in reverse.
Louise hops in and
Thelma PEELS OUT, spraying gravel.
As they speed out of the
parking lot back to the road, we hear MUSIC blaring from the
nightclub.
They hit the main road with tires SQUEALING.
LOUISE
Get back to the interstate.
Louise lifts her hand and notices she is still holding the
gun.
THELMA
Shit!
I... I, which way?
LOUISE
West.
Left.
CAR - DISTANCING SHOT - NIGHT
They get onto the interstate going west.
TRAVELING SHOT FROM BEHIND -- VARIOUS DRIVING SHOTS
INTERSTATE - NIGHT
Thelma pulls off to the side of the road.
Louise gets out
and starts to walk around the car.
She stops when she gets
to the back of the car, and she is sick.
Thelma waits in
the car and moves over to the passenger side.
Louise gets
in the driver's side.
THELMA
Louise... Are you alright?
Louise rests her head on the steering wheel.
LOUISE
Oh Christ.
(to Thelma)
Thelma.
Thelma doesn't hear.
LOUISE
Thelma.
Thelma looks at her blankly, without answering.
LOUISE
I've gotta stop for a minute.
I've
got to get it together.
I'm gonna
find a place to get a cup of coffee
and I'm gonna sit down for a second.
Do you want to come?
Thelma's head moves almost imperceptibly.
Louise studies
Thelma's face.
LOUISE
Is that yes?
Are you up to this?
Again, Thelma slightly moves her head in a nod.
Louise puts
the car in gear and pulls OUT OF SHOT.
TRUCK STOP - RESTAURANT - NIGHT
The green '66 T-Bird pulls into a modern truck stop and parks.
Louise turns to Thelma.
LOUISE
We gotta be inconspicuous.
Do you
know what that means?
THELMA
Yes.
LOUISE
It means you don't talk to anybody.
You don't draw attention to yourself
in any way.
Do you understand that?
Again, she twitches more than nods.
LOUISE
Tell me you understand that.
Thelma nods more firmly now.
She understands.
VARIOUS POV SHOTS of truck drivers seeing Thelma and Louise
wind their way towards the restaurant portion of the coffee
shop.
They look small and incongruous with the surroundings.
SILVER BULLET PARKING LOT - 4:00 A.M.
Police cars are parked around.
The activity has died down.
Doors on the coroner's van SLAM shut.
In the back of a police
car sits the Waitress with the door open.
A DETECTIVE in a
suit leans over the car door with his note pad.
HAL
Could you identify 'em, if ya saw
'em again?
LENA (WAITRESS)
Hal, I've told you about twenty times,
yes, I could identify 'em, but neither
one of them was the type to pull
something like this.
HAL
Well, you're not exactly an expert
witness, but what makes you so sure?
LENA
If waitin' tables in a bar don't
make you an expert on human nature,
then nothin' will, and I could've
told you that Harlan Puckett would
end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot.
I'm just surprised it didn't happen
before now.
HAL
Who do you think did it?
LENA
Has anybody asked his wife?
She's
the one I hope did it.
HAL
Lena, just cut the bullshit, will
ya?
Do have any ideas or don't ya?
I been standin' in this stupid parkin'
lot all goddamn night, and I still
got to go file a report before I can
go home in time to get back up again!
LENA
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it
was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's
husband.
But it wasn't either one
of those two.
The tall one, the
redhead, she left me a huge tip.
HAL
You didn't happen to notice what
kind of car they were driving?
LENA
It's a nightclub, not a drive-in,
Hal.
I don't follow the customers
to the parking lot.
HAL
Alright, Lena.
Go on home.
We might
have to call you in for some more
questioning.
Lena gets out of the back of the car.
LENA
Those girls are not the murderous
type.
CAR - DRIVING SHOT - DAWN
The T-Bird barrels down a fairly empty four-lane highway.
A truck passes going the other way.
MOTEL - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY
The motel is near farms and agricultural areas with crops.
MOTEL - DAY
Thelma comes out of the room and walks towards the pool.
She stops, then decides to go on to the pool.
She lies down
in a lounge chair facing the road.
MOTEL POOL - DAY
Thelma arranges herself in a lounge chair, trying desperately
to feel like she's on vacation.
MOTEL POOL - DAY
Thelma at pool basking in the sun.
MOTEL POOL - DAY
Thelma by the pool.
A car SCREECHES, a loud horn HONKS.
LOUISE
(bellowing)
Come on, Thelma!
Get in the car!
Thelma bolts upright and grabs her sundress and dashes to
the car.
She jumps in over the door.
She's in a mild state
of shock.
THELMA
Did you finish thinking?
LOUISE
I think better when I drive.
Louise PEELS OUT of the parking lot.

SMALL COUNTRY TOWN - DAY
The T-Bird rolls into town.
COUNTRY STORE - DAY
Louise and Thelma pull up in front of an old store, the kind
with a wooden front porch, the kind that sells bait and
flannel shirts.
They enter the store and see an OLD MAN
behind the counter.
LOUISE
Do you have a pay phone?
OLD MAN
'Round the side, by the restrooms.
Louise gets change while Thelma strolls around looking at
rubber worms and pickled pigs' feet.
Louise goes out to the
phone.
PAY PHONE - DAY
Louise dropping change into the phone.
It RINGS and Jimmy
answers.
PAY PHONE - DAY
LOUISE
Is that how you answer the phone?
JIMMY (V.O.)
(on phone)
I got it.
I was afraid I'd missed
you.
I almost couldn't get a check
cashed.
It's Saturday.
LOUISE
Who did it?
JIMMY (V.O.)
Friend of mine, owns a club.
Dickie
Randall.
You'd know him if you saw
him.
His brother was in your class.
Terry.
LOUISE
You didn't say what it was for, did
you?
JIMMY (V.O.)
(on phone)
No, honey.
I told him I was buyin'
a car.
What is it for?
LOUISE
(not responding to
the question)
Good.
That was good.
Where do I
go?
JIMMY (V.O.)
(on phone)
It's a place called Shaw's Siesta
Motel.
The address is 1921 North
East 23.
It's under your name.
LOUISE
And what's the mysterious code word?
JIMMY (V.O.)
(on phone)
Peaches.
LOUISE
What?
JIMMY (V.O.)
That's the code word.
I miss you,
peaches.
Louise rolls her eyes and tries not to melt.
LOUISE
Okay, Jimmy.
Thanks.
She puts her finger down on the receiver.
PAY PHONE - DAY
Louise is hanging up the phone.
She walks away towards the
front of the store.
COUNTRY STORE - DAY
Thelma comes out of the front of the store.
The store is at
a crossroads with a fair amount of vehicular traffic.
LOUISE
Go call Darryl.
Thelma is walking towards the car.
She puts her purse in
the front seat.
She looks at Louise.
THELMA
Call him?
LOUISE
Call him.
Don't tell him anything.
Tell him you're having a wonderful
time and you'll be home tomorrow
night.
THELMA
Will I be?
LOUISE
I don't know.
I won't be.
Thelma and Louise look at each other while this sinks in.
THELMA
walks around to the side of the building to the phone.
She
picks it up and dials.
THELMA
(into phone)
Collect from Thelma.
STOREFRONT - DAY
Louise goes into the store for a chocolate Yoohoo.
PAY PHONE - DAY
THELMA
Honey?
PAY PHONE - DAY
THELMA
I'm... I'm with Louise.
We're in
the mountains, we're...
PAY PHONE - DAY
THELMA
Darryl... baby... Darryl, calm down
now, honey.
Please don't get so
mad.
I can explain...
PAY PHONE - DAY
Thelma is trying not to cry.
She's trying to be strong.
THELMA
Darryl, please... You're my husband,
not my father, Darryl.
PAY PHONE - DAY
THELMA
Darryl.
DARRYL (V.O.)
What?
THELMA
Go fuck yourself.
She hangs up on him.
COUNTRY STORE - DAY
Thelma has tears running down her face and she is watching
the ground as she storms back to the car.
So she makes a
loud grunt as she slams into someone that she did not see.
Both people are knocked back a few steps from the force of
the collision.
HITCHHIKER
Whoa!
Excuse me!
Miss, are you
alright?
Thelma nods her head "yes," but tears continue.
Her crying
is silent.
HITCHHIKER
Is there anything I can do?
Thelma shakes her head "no." She tries to control her tears.
She notices how blue his eyes are.
THELMA
No.
Thanks.
Sorry.
THELMA
collects herself as she walks back to the car.
She gets in
and is drying her eyes, looking in the side mirror.
In the
mirror she sees the Hitchhiker come back around from the
side of the building.
He is several feet behind the car,
and she watches him as he removes his long-sleeved shirt and
stuffs it into his duffel bag.
Now he is just in T-shirt
and jeans.
He looks good.
Really good.
She watches in the
mirror as he picks up his stuff and heads towards the road.
She can see him as he's walking.
He stops.
He's thinking.
He heads over to the car.
HITCHHIKER
Would you mind me asking which
direction you and your friend are
going?
I'm trying to get back to
school and my ride fell through, so
I'm kinda stuck.
Are you going my
way?
Thelma doesn't know what to do.
THELMA
Umm.
I think we're going to Oklahoma
City.
But I'm not sure.
HITCHHIKER
Do you think you could... I mean, I
could help pay for gas.
Thelma knows Louise isn't going to like this.
THELMA
Ummm.
Well, see, it's not really up
to me.
It's not my car.
Umm, we'll
have to ask my friend, but she'll
probably say no.
She's a little
uptight.
HITCHHIKER
Well.
Maybe we better not ask her.
But thank you anyway.
Now she wants him to come.
He starts to walk away from the
car.
THELMA
Well, we can ask her.
That won't
hurt.
Just then Louise comes out of the store.
She sees Thelma
talking to this guy and, for one moment, stops dead in her
tracks as she takes this in, then continues toward the car.
Although her face is basically expressionless, we see that
it's possible she might kill Thelma.
THELMA
Louise, this young man is on his way
back to school and needs a ride, and
I thought since...
LOUISE
It's probably not a good idea.
THELMA
Louise.
The Hitchhiker just nods and starts walking towards the road.
HITCHHIKER
Y'all have a nice day.
Drive safe.
The guy does seem really nice and Thelma is really frustrated
that Louise wouldn't give him a ride, but decides not to
confront her.
THELMA
See how polite he is?
He was really
nice.
Louise lowers the top and backs the car out.
They watch him
walk away.
Louise pulls out of the parking lot onto the road.
They
pass the Hitchhiker.
Thelma waves.
HITCHHIKER
(to Thelma)
You cheer up now!
She turns around in the seat to continue waving.
He smiles
and waves.
They drive down the road.
TIGHT SHOT of the
Hitchhiker as the smile fades from his face.
CUT TO:
ROAD - FARMLAND - DAY
Two Harley-Davidson bikes tool past, driven by a couple of
ex-hippies from the 60's.
The Hitchhiker is on the back of
one, and he waves to them as they go by.
Thelma waves back
enthusiastically.
THELMA
I'll tell you what.
He is gooood
lookin'.
Louise pops a TAPE into the cassette player.
LOUISE'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY
Hal walks up the sidewalk past a couple of elderly people
sitting outside, to the door of an apartment complex and
knocks.
LOUISE'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY
Hal is walking back down the sidewalk past the old people.
He stops, turns around and goes back to them.
We see him
stand and talk to them.
OVER MUSIC:
CROSSROADS - DAY
Hitchhiker standing on the side of the road.
Thelma looks
at Louise pleadingly.
Louise's car pulls over and he hops
in the back seat.
An animated Thelma turns around backwards
in the front seat to face him.
COFFEE SHOP - DAY
Hal walks into the coffee shop where Louise works.
VARIOUS
SHOTS of him talking to other employees.
Albert, waitress,
etc.
Some cover their mouths as they recognize police
sketches of Louise and Thelma.
The Day Manager comes over,
looks at the pictures and talks to Hal.
THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY
Hal's unmarked detective car pulls up in front of Thelma's
house.
A Corvette, completely customized with everything,
sits in the driveway.
THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY
Hal is walking up the sidewalk as the front door flies open
to reveal a drunk Darryl in Hawaiian shorts, necklaces and a
beer can in his hand.
RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY
J.D.
(to Thelma)
So how come you don't have any kids?
THELMA
Darryl, that's my husband, he says
he's not ready.
He's still too much
of a kid himself.
He prides himself
on being infantile.
LOUISE
He's got a lot to be proud of.
THELMA
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
LOUISE
That's puttin' it mildly.
THELMA
She thinks he's a pig.
LOUISE
He's a real piece o' work.
I wish
you could meet him.
J.D.
Did you get married real young?
THELMA
Twenty-four isn't young.
I'd already
been goin' out with him ten years
when we got married.
I've never
been with anybody but Darryl.
J.D.
Well, if you don't mind me sayin'
so, he sounds like a real asshole.
THELMA
It's okay.
He is an asshole.
Most
of the time I just let it slide.
J.D. is looking down the road, way off in the distance.
J.D.
Better slow down.
That's a cop.
Louise looks down the road and sees a highway patrol car
coming down the road towards them.
She does not look alarmed
but veers off the road into a "rest area" drive that has
trees and shrubs that obscure the view from the road.
She glides along as the cop car passes on the other side
without seeing them.
Louise glides right back onto the road as if nothing unusual
has happened at all.
They realize they have not been spotted.
J.D. and Louise look at each other.
J.D.
Maybe you got a few too many parking
tickets?
LOUISE
We'll take you on to Oklahoma City,
then you'd best be on your way.
FLATLANDS - ROAD - DUSK
The T-Bird barrels down the road at high speed.
SHAW'S SIESTA MOTEL - DUSK
Louise, Thelma, and J.D. pull into the motel parking lot.
LOUISE
I just gotta run in for a minute.
Louise looks at J.D. in the back seat and takes the keys out
of the ignition.
LOUISE
You two better go on and say your
goodbyes.
Louise gets out of the car and goes inside.
MOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Louise and Jimmy walk outside and catch Thelma sitting very
close to J.D.
Thelma sees Jimmy and is so startled she
screams and involuntarily slams herself across the back seat
to the other side of the car.
She tries to look nonchalant.
THELMA
Jimmy!
Hello, stranger.
What in
the world are you doin' here?
JIMMY
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you
no lies.
THELMA
Good answer.
Same goes double for
me.
JIMMY
Who's your friend?
J.D. is climbing out of the car, looking very uncomfortable.
THELMA
This is J.D.
He's a student.
We're
just givin' him a ride to... to here.
Louise said we could bring him here
and then he'd have to go.
And that's
what he's doin'.
He's goin'.
Aren't
you, J.D.?
J.D.
Yup.
Thanks for the ride.
You all
take care.
He quickly turns and walks away toward the road.
THELMA
(watching him)
Yup.
That's him goin'.
I love to
watch him go.
LOUISE
(to Jimmy)
Thelma kinda took to him.
Jimmy is smiling.
JIMMY
(to Thelma)
Well, come on, gal, I got you a room.
You can go on in and take a nice
cold shower.
THELMA
Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a
wild woman.
JIMMY
I always knew that.
THELMA
A regular outlaw.
Louise shoots Thelma a look.
The three of them drive around
to the back of the motel.
Thelma turns and looks at the
road.
J.D. is standing there.
He blows her a kiss.
MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
They stop in front of the motel rooms and the three of them
climb out of the car.
LOUISE
Let me just go in and freshen up for
a minute.
I need to wash my face,
you know.
Thelma is taking their luggage out of the trunk.
JIMMY
Okay, honey.
I don't want to rush
you.
I just wanna talk to you and...
(whispering)
...be alone with you.
I'll just be
in my room, 115, you just come on
down when you're ready.
Jimmy helps carry the luggage to Thelma's room.
He stops at
the door.
JIMMY
I'll be waiting.
Louise smiles at him quizzically as if she can't believe
he's acting this way.
He turns on his heel and slinks away.
THELMA
I don't care what you say about him.
The boy has got it bad.
LOUISE
He's always got it bad as long as
I'm running in the other direction.
Don't be fooled, he's no different
than any other guy.
He knows how to
chase and that's it.
Once he's caught
you, he don't know what to do.
So
he runs away.
THELMA
I heard that.
MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
It's raining out.
Louise goes to Jimmy's room.
Louise knocks on the door to room 115.
The door opens
slightly and one red rose pops out.
LOUISE
Hello...
JIMMY
(in a falsetto voice)
Who is it?
LOUISE
It's me.
The following eleven roses are held out the door, then Louise
is yanked inside and we hear her shriek with LAUGHTER.
SIESTA MOTEL - DAWN
MONTAGE of early morning staff, a truck driver climbing into
his cab with a silver thermos, squirrels hopping around on
the ground.
MOTEL PARKING LOT - DAY
They run across the parking lot around the back to the room.
The door is ajar and no one is in the room.
Louise goes in
and Thelma stays outside the door.
THELMA
Goddamnit!
I've never been lucky!
Not one time!
Louise comes back outside.
She doesn't say anything.
She
is stoic, fighting tears.
THELMA
Shit.
That little sonofabitch burgled
me.
I don't believe it.
Louise sits down on the sidewalk in front of the room.
Thelma
comes and sits beside her.
Neither one says anything for a
moment.
THELMA
Louise?
Are you okay?
Louise shakes her head no.
THELMA
Louise... It's okay.
Louise?
I'm
sorry.
I mean it.
Louise has seen the end of the tunnel and there is no light.
LOUISE
It's not okay, Thelma.
It's
definitely not okay.
None of this
is okay.
What are we going to do
for money?
What are we gonna buy
gas with?
Our good looks?
I mean...
Goddamn, Thelma!
Louise quietly starts to fall apart.
This causes Thelma to
leap into action.
THELMA
Come on.
Stand up!
Don't you worry
about it.
I'll take care of it.
Just don't you worry about it.
Get
your stuff.
Louise is still sitting on the sidewalk.
THELMA
Come on!
Damnit, get your stuff and
let's get out of here!
Louise slowly gets to her feet.
THELMA
Move!
(to herself)
Jesus Christ, take your damn time.
Thelma is hauling stuff out of the car.
MOTEL PARKING LOT - MORNING
TIGHT SHOT of rear wheel of green T-Bird LAYING RUBBER out
of the motel parking lot.
Thelma and Louise, both looking a
little rougher than we've seen so far, drive away.
THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY
Hal, FBI Man, various other police and detective types, pull
up in front of the house.
The front door swings open and
there stands Darryl looking like he's been shot out of a
cannon.
STREET - DAY
Louise and Thelma pull into a convenience store.
CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY
Thelma and Louise are sitting in the car.
They've put all
their money together.
LOUISE
Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna
make a dent, baby girl.
THELMA
(getting out of the
car)
Don't worry about it.
You want
anything?
LOUISE
No.
Thelma marches off to the store.
Louise puts a tape in the
deck and is listening to loud R&B; MUSIC.
She checks herself
in the rearview mirror.
She takes her lipstick out and is
about to put it on.
She makes eye contact with herself and,
instead, throws it out the window, closes her eyes and leans
her head back on the seat.
She's in a world of shit.
Thelma comes trotting out of the store and jumps into the
car.
THELMA
(breathless)
Drive!
Louise looks at her.
THELMA
Drive!
Drive away!
LOUISE
(driving away)
What happened?
Thelma opens her purse and exposes a bag full of bills.
LOUISE
What?
You robbed the store?
You
robbed the Goddamn store?!
Thelma shrieks with excitement.
Louise is completely stunned.
THELMA
Well!
We needed the money!
It's
not like I killed anybody, for God's
sake.
Louise shoots her a look.
She puts the car in gear and FLOORS
it out of the parking lot.
She is still looking at Thelma
as if she has completely lost her mind.
THELMA
I'm sorry.
Well, we need the money.
Now we have it.
LOUISE
Oh shit, Thelma!!
Shit!
Shit!
Shit!
THELMA
(sternly)
Now you get a grip, Louise!
Just

LOUISE
Okay.
Shit, Thelma!
What'd you do?
I mean, what did you say?
THELMA
Well, I just...
DRIVING SHOT - DAY
LOUISE
Holy shit.
THELMA
Lemme see the map.
Louise throws the map across the front seat at Thelma and
FLOORS it.
FADE TO BLACK
FADE IN:
ROAD - TIGHT SHOT - J.D.'S BACKSIDE - DAY
made only more prominent by the bulging wallet in his back
right pocket.
J.D. is walking down the road and continues to walk as an
Oklahoma State Patrol car pulls up alongside him.
He smiles
and gives a friendly wave as they cruise along slowly beside
him.
We can see the cop nearest him talking, and then we
see J.D. stop walking and set down his duffel bag.
He reaches
for his wallet.
It's clear that they have asked for some
I.D.
RURAL ROAD - DAY
Louise is driving.
They fly past a kid on his bike on a
long gravel driveway.
He watches them.
A huge cloud of
dust blows up as they pass him.
He turns and rides his bike
down the driveway towards the house.
DRIVING SHOT - DAY
Thelma and Louise are in the car.
Thelma is taking empty
little Wild Turkey bottles out of her purse and throwing
them out the window.
LOUISE
So what's the plan, Thelma?
You
just gonna stay drunk?
THELMA
Try to.
LOUISE
Litterbug.
They come ROARING up on a semi-tanker carrying gas.
We see
their FISH-EYE REFLECTIONS in the shiny tanker.
The mud flaps are the shiny silhouettes of naked women that
Thelma and Louise saw earlier.
The truck is going slower
than they are.
LOUISE
Aw, great.
This always happens.
Whenever you're in a hurry.
She noses out to see if she can pass, but there's a car
coming.
The car passes and the truck HONKS.
The truck
driver's arm comes out his window and waves them past.
THELMA
Isn't that nice?
Truck drivers are
always so nice.
The best drivers on
the road.
As they get next to the truck, the truck driver is smiling
and waving at them.
They smile and wave back.
He flicks
his tongue at them.
Louise screams.
THELMA/LOUISE
Ugh!!
Gross!!
Oh my God!
Aw, God!
Louise FLOORS it and speeds past him.
THELMA
Ugh!!
Why do they have to do that?
LOUISE
They think we like it.
Maybe they
think it turns us on.
Louise shivers with disgust.
POLICE STATION - DAY
J.D. arriving, handcuffed, at State Police building.
DIRT

Louise and Thelma pull into a gas station.
GAS STATION - NIGHT
A gas station attendant approaches as Louise and Thelma are
getting out of the car.
LOUISE
(to attendant)
Fill her up.
(to Thelma)
There's a phone right over there.
THELMA
Let's get it over with.
Thelma and Louise walk to the phone.
LOUISE
I'm not kidding, Thelma.
If you
think he knows, even if you're not
sure, hang up.
PAY PHONE - NIGHT
THELMA
Darryl.
It's me.
PAY PHONE
Thelma hangs up the phone.
THELMA
(matter-of-factly)
He knows.
PAY PHONE - NIGHT
Thelma and Louise are staring at each other intently.
Louise steps up to the phone.
LOUISE
You got any change?
Thelma digs in her bag and hands Louise a roll of quarters.
Louise gets out of the car and goes to the pay phone.
Thelma
follows her.
She puts the money in and dials.
It RINGS.
LOUISE
Darryl, this is Louise.
Are the
police there?
PHONE - NIGHT
LOUISE
Let me talk to whoever's in charge
there?
PHONE - NIGHT
LOUISE
(chuckling)
I've been better.
HAL (V.O.)
You girls are in some hot water.
LOUISE
Yes, sir.
I know.
PHONE - NIGHT
LOUISE
We're both fine.
HAL (V.O.)
Good.
You wanna tell me what
happened?
LOUISE
Sure.
Maybe over coffee sometime.
I'll buy.
PHONE - NIGHT
LOUISE
No kiddin'.
Listen, we gotta go.
I'll call you back, all right?
Louise looks at her watch.
HAL (V.O.)
Miss Sawyer, I don't think y'all are
gonna make it to Mexico.
We should
talk.
Please.
I wanna to help you.
On hearing this Louise mouths the word "shit" in a very
frustrated way.
Louise hangs up the phone.
PAY PHONE - NIGHT
She is stomping back to the car.
Thelma follows doggedly.
A moving van pulls in and parks in the b.g.
LOUISE
That J.D. kid is a little shit.
THELMA
What.
Louise stops as she is about to get in and faces Thelma who's
standing on the other side of the car.
LOUISE
How'd they find out we're going to
Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?
THELMA
I... I...
LOUISE
You told that thievin' little shit
where we were goin'?!
Louise yanks open her car door, gets in and slams the door
and fires up the ENGINE.
Thelma hops in quickly.
THELMA
I just told him if he ever gets to
Mexico to look us up.
I asked him
not to tell.
I didn't think he would
tell anybody.
LOUISE
Why not?!
What's he got to lose?
Other than my life's savings, that
is.
Shit!
Louise careens back onto the road.
THELMA
I'm sorry.
I mean I...
Louise slams on the brakes.
LOUISE
Goddamnit, Thelma!
Let me explain
something to you.
Right now we have
only two things goin' for us.
One,
nobody knows where we are, and two,
nobody knows where we're going.
Now, one of our things that was going
for us is gone!
Louise stops yelling for a moment groping for self-control.
Thelma looks pitiful.
LOUISE
Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma!
Stop bein' so open!
We're fugitives
now.
Let's behave that way!
THELMA
You're right.
LONELY ROAD - NIGHT (MUSCO LIGHT)
The T-Bird flashes by on a road that looks a lot like Route
66.
THELMA (V.O.)

LOUISE (V.O.)
Just past Boise City.
THELMA (V.O.)
Idaho?
LOUISE (V.O.)

The car goes streaking by.
MOONLIT DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT (MUSCO LIGHT)
They are driving through Monument Valley.
The T-Bird speeds
through the beautifully moonlit desert.
It is almost like
daylight.
MONTAGE of silhouettes of cacti, huge rock formations, desert
beauty SHOTS, etc.
DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT
A semi-gas tanker is up ahead on the road.
It looks like
the one they saw earlier.
It's got the same mud flaps...
DESERT HIGHWAY - DAWN (OVER MUSIC)
The car is flying down the road.
DESERT HIGHWAY - DAWN
The car is SCREAMING down the road.
They drive through a
little stand of buildings.
DESERT HIGHWAY - LONG LENS SHOT - DAWN
A car speeds up to try and catch them... The red and blue
lights pop on.
It is a New Mexico State Patrol car.
SIDE OF DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY
PATROLMAN (O.S.)
Turn off your engine.
Louise does.
The PATROLMAN gets out of his car and approaches
their car.
He comes to the driver's side window.
It is
rolled up.
PATROLMAN'S POV OF LOUISE smiling up at him.
He gestures to
her to roll her window down.
She does.
LOUISE
Hello, Officer.
Is there a problem?
PATROLMAN
You wanna let me see your license,
please?
Louise fumbles in her purse for her wallet, opens it and
shows her license.
PATROLMAN
You wanna take it out of your wallet,
please?
LOUISE
Oh yeah.
She does and hands it to him.
THELMA
I told you to slow down.
Hell,
Officer, I told her to slow down.
LOUISE
About how fast was I going?
PATROLMAN
About a hundred and ten.
You wanna
step out of the car, please?
They walk to the back of the car.
He notes the license plate
number.
PATROLMAN
Is this your car?
LOUISE
Yes.
PATROLMAN
You wanna come with me, please?
Walk around and get in the car,
please.
LOUISE
In the back?
PATROLMAN
Front.
LOUISE
Am I in trouble?
PATROLMAN
As far as I'm concerned, yes, ma'am,
you are.
Patrolman gets in the driver's side.
He picks up a clipboard
and clips Louise's driver's license to it.
He picks up the
hand mike for the radio and, as he does, a hand with a gun
comes in his car window.
It's Thelma and she puts the gun
to his head.
THELMA
Officer, I am so sorry about this.
Could you let go of that?
He drops it.
THELMA
I really, really apologize, but please
put your hands on the steering wheel.
See, if you get on that radio, you're
gonna find out that we're wanted in
two states and probably considered
armed and dangerous, at least I am,
then our whole plan would be shot to
hell.
Louise, take his gun.
Louise reaches over and takes his gun.
LOUISE
(apologetic)
I am really sorry about this.
THELMA
I swear, before yesterday, neither
one of us would have ever pulled a
stunt like this.
But if you ever
met my husband, you'd know why I
just can... You wanna step out of
the car, please?
(she opens the door
for him)
You wanna put your hands on your
head, please?
Louise, shoot the
radio.
LOUISE
What?
THELMA
Shoot the radio!
Louise SHOOTS the car radio.
The cop flinches with each
shot.
THELMA
The police radio, Louise!
Jesus!
Louise fires TWO SHOTS into the police radio.
It BLASTS all
to hell.
THELMA
You wanna step to the back of the
car, please.
Louise, bring the keys.
Louise reaches over and takes the keys.
She takes her license
off the clipboard.
She gets out and trots around to the
back of the car.
Thelma is holding the gun on the Patrolman.
Suddenly Thelma
FIRES the gun, blowing two holes into the trunk cover.
THELMA
(to Louise)
Open the trunk.
Louise opens the trunk.
THELMA
(to Patrolman)
You wanna step into the trunk, please?
PATROLMAN
Ma'am, please... I got kids... a
wife...
THELMA
You do?
Well, you're lucky.
You be
sweet to 'em.
Especially your wife.
My husband wasn't sweet to me and
look how I turned out.
Now go on,
get in there.
As he's climbing into the trunk, Thelma explains to Louise:
THELMA
Air holes.
He's all the way in and Louise closes the trunk.
PATROL CAR - DAY
THELMA
(to trunk)
Sorry!
LOUISE
(from her car)
Sorry!
Thelma hops into the car with Louise.
They look at each
other.
LOUISE

Hit it.
Louise pulls the car back onto the road and they drive away.

ROADSIDE REST STATION - MORNING
Louise is at a pay phone as the sky is just starting to get

Louise has already
dialed and the phone is RINGING.
PAY PHONE - MORNING
LOUISE
Hey.
HAL (V.O.)
How are things goin' out there?
LOUISE
Weird.
Got some kind of snowball
effect goin' here or somethin'.
HAL (V.O.)
You're still with us though.
You're
somewhere on the face of the earth?
LOUISE
Well, we're not in the middle of
nowhere, but we can see it from here.
PAY PHONE - MORNING
Louise does not answer.
HAL (V.O.)
Did Harlan Puckett...
Through clenched teeth, repulsed:
LOUISE
(interrupting)
No!
HAL (V.O.)
You want to come on in?
Louise thinks for a minute.
LOUISE
I don't think so.
PAY PHONE - DAY
LOUISE
You know, certain words and phrases
just keep floating through my mind,
things like incarceration, cavity
search, life imprisonment, death by
electrocution, that sort of thing.
So, come out alive?
I don't know.
Let us think about that.
HAL (V.O.)
Louise, I'll do anything.
I know
what's makin' you run.
I know what
happened to you in Texas.
Louise's eyes get wide as she hears this.
A FINGER reaches up and presses down the lever and hangs up
the phone.
ANGLE OF THELMA
She has her finger on the lever.
THELMA
Come on, Louise.
Don't blow it.
Let's go.
She walks away towards the car.
Louise is still standing
there holding the phone.
Thelma stops and looks at her.
THELMA
Come on.
Louise doesn't move.
PAY PHONE - DAY
Louise is still standing there.
THELMA
Louise?
LOUISE
Yes, Thelma?
THELMA
You're not gonna give up on me, are
ya?
LOUISE
What do you mean?
THELMA
You're not gonna make some deal with
that guy, are you?
I mean, I just
wanna know.
LOUISE
No, Thelma.
I'm not gonna make any
deals.
THELMA
I can understand if you're thinkin'
about it.
I mean, in a way, you've
got something to go back for.
I
mean Jimmy and everything.
Louise is surprised to be hearing this from Thelma.
LOUISE
Thelma, that is not an option.
THELMA
But I don't know... something's
crossed over in me and I can't go
back.
I mean, I just couldn't live...
LOUISE
I know.
I know what you mean.
I
don't wanna end up on the damn Geraldo
Show.
They are both quiet for a moment.
LOUISE
He said they're charging us with
murder.
THELMA
(making a face)
Eeuww.
LOUISE
And we have to decide whether we
want to come out of this dead or
alive.
THELMA
Gosh, didn't he say anything positive
at all?
Louise STARTS the car.
They lurch into reverse then SCREECH
forward as they tear off down the road.
WIDE SHOT OF CAR
as they fly down the road.
THELMA
Louise, do you think we should change
cars, get another car?
LOUISE
Sure... You know how to hotwire a
car?
THELMA
No.
LOUISE
Well, let me know when you figure it
out.

They come roaring up on the semi-tanker, the same one they
have seen three times before.
THELMA
(screaming over music)
Oh my God!
Louise!
Look!
Look!
See if that's him!
LOUISE
It's him.
He's got California plates.
It's the same guy.
THELMA
Pass him!
DESERT ROAD - DAY
Louise bears down really hard and passes him.
Again as they
get right next to him, he blows kisses down at them.
He is leering at them and laughing.
Louise and Thelma drive
further down the road.
Louise pulls the car off to the side of the road.
As the
truck gets close they start waving to him to stop.
He pulls
his truck off the side of the road and stops.
ANGLE ON Louise
and Thelma smiling up at him.
He chuckles to himself.
He
leans out the window.
THELMA
Hi!
TRUCKER
Hi there!

THELMA
We think you have really bad manners.
Louise nods.
LOUISE
We were just wonderin' where you
think you get off behavin' like that
to women you don't even know.
This is not what is supposed to be happening.
TRUCKER
What?
What are you talkin' about?
LOUISE
You know good and damn well what I'm

THELMA
I mean really!
That business with
your tongue.
What is that?
That's

LOUISE
And, oh my God, that other thing,
that pointing to your lap?
What's

Does

you what a big fat slob I am or...
THELMA
Does that mean suck my dick?
TRUCKER
You women are crazy!
LOUISE
You got that right.
THELMA
We think you should apologize.
He is getting a little panicky.
TRUCKER
I'm not apologizing for shit!
LOUISE
Say you're sorry.
TRUCKER
Fuck that.
Louise pulls the gun they stole from the State Patrolman.
LOUISE
Say you're sorry or we'll make you
fuckin' sorry.
He looks at the gun.
TRUCKER
Oh, Jesus!
THELMA
You probably even called us beavers
on your CB radio, didn't you?
TRUCKER
Yeah... sure did.
THELMA
Damn.
I hate that!
I hate bein'
called a beaver, don't you?
LOUISE
Are you going to apologize or not?
TRUCKER
Fuck you.
Louise looks at his truck off in the distance.
She points
the gun at it, takes a second to get a bead, then SHOOTS two
of the tires flat.
The truck slowly sinks as the air escapes
from the tires.
TRUCKER
Oh goddamn!!
You bitch!!
Louise and Thelma look at each other.
They both turn towards
the truck and FIRE rounds into the tankers until they EXPLODE
in a huge ball of fire.
The truck driver screams at the top
of his lungs.
Louise starts the car and starts driving in
circles around the truck driver.
Thelma and Louise are both
howling at the top of their lungs.
Thelma is sitting on the
back of the front seat with her legs on the dashboard.
TRUCKER
You fucking bitch!
Aaaaaaarrrgghh!!!
You're gonna have to pay for that!!!
I'm gonna make you pay for that!!
You hear me??!!
Louise stops the car right next to him.
THELMA
Shut up.
Louise takes off again and Thelma falls into the back seat.
They drive off trailing a huge cloud of dust.

the burning debris of the truck.
As she gets to the road

DESERT ROAD - DAY
WIDE SHOT of car speeding through the desert on an empty
highway west.
DRIVING SHOT -- Thelma has her face to the
sun with her eyes closed.
Louise is driving with a fierce
intensity.
They hardly resemble the two women that started
out for a weekend in the mountains two days earlier.
Although
their faces are tanned and lined and their hair is blowing
wildly there is a sense of serenity that pervades.

Hal and Max are climbing out of the jet and running across
the tarmac to a waiting helicopter.

Louise and Thelma blow through a stand of buildings left
from when the train went through here.
There are two parallel
streets on either side of the one they're on and, as they
pass by buildings, they can see police cars ROARING down
these parallel streets trying to "head them off at the pass."
Louise FLOORS it and her car screams ahead.
LOUISE
We probably shoulda filled up the
car before we blew up that truck.
THELMA
Why?
LOUISE
They'll probably catch us when we
have to stop for gas!
THELMA
I know this whole thing was my fault.
I know it is.
LOUISE
There's one thing you oughta
understand by now, Thelma, it's not
your fault.
THELMA
Louise... no matter what happens,
I'm glad I came with you.
LOUISE
You're crazy.
DESERT ROAD - DAY
Louise swerves off the road and begins driving across the
desert.
All the police cars take off across the desert after
them.
They are now being pursued by at least fifteen cars.
DESERT - DAY
It does look like an Army.
More police cars have joined,
and from every direction, police cars are swarming across
the desert, although none are in front of them.
Way off in
the distance, a helicopter joins the chase.
DESERT - DAY
Behind them is a huge wall of dust created by all the police
cars following them.
In front of them, looking larger every
moment, is the awesome splendor of the Grand Canyon.

All the police cars are still following about a half a mile
behind.
The car is bouncing and flying across the desert.
Finally, they get about twenty yards from the edge and Louise
SLAMS on the brakes.
Thelma and Louise are just waiting for the cars to catch up.
The police cars stop in a line about two hundred yards behind
them.
The dust from the cars is blowing across them.
They
just sit looking at the Grand Canyon.
From the canyon, the FBI helicopter rises up in front of the
car.

No shit.
ARIZONA COP #1
With his own gun.
Put him in the
trunk and blew him away...
DESERT - DAY
Hal is about to crawl out of his skin.
He can't believe
this thing is getting out of control.
He jumps in front of
Max.
HAL
Max!
Let me talk to 'em!
I can't
believe this!
You've gotta do
something here!
Max goes around Hal and continues walking.
Hal jumps in
front of Max again and blocks his way.
HAL
I'm sorry to bother you, I know you're
real busy right now, but how many
times, Max?
How many times has that
woman gotta be fucked over?
You
could lift one finger and save her
ass and you won't even do that?
MAX
(grabbing Hal)
Get a hold of yourself!
You are way
out of your jurisdiction, now come
on!
Calm down!
Don't make me sorry
I let you come!
Max lets go of Hal's lapels.
HAL
(under his breath)
Shit!
I can't fucking believe this!
Hal walks along with a look of total disbelief on his face.
He's shaking his head.
Slowly he breaks into a trot and
starts heading toward the front line.
MAX
(shouting)
Hey.
Hey!
Hal is running now and clears the front row of cars.
There is a lot of confusion among the officers on the front
row.
Some shout, some lower their guns to look.
ARIZONA COP #1
What in the hell?!
ARIZONA #2
(lowering his rifle)
The son of a bitch is in my way!
DESERT - DAY
Hal's eyes widen for a moment at what he sees, and then a
sense of calm overtakes him and he mouths the word "alright."
B.B. KING SONG (V.O.)
I've been around, I've seem some
things, People movin' faster than
the speed of sound, faster than a
speedin' bullet.
People livin' like
Superman, all day and all night.
I
won't say if it's wrong or I won't
say if it's right.
I'm pretty fast
myself.
But I do have some advice
to pass along, right here in the
words to this song...
DESERT - DAY
The cops all lower their weapons as looks of shock and
disbelief cover their faces.
A cloud of dust blows THROUGH
THE FRAME as the speeding car sails over the edge of the
cliff.
B.B. KING SONG (V.O.)
Better not look down, if you wanna
keep on flyin'.
Put the hammer down,
keep it full speed ahead.
Better
not look back or you might just wind
up cryin'.
You can keep it movin'
if you don't look down...
FADE OUT
THE END
