      CLOSE-UP on a closed window from the outside, cheap white 
      curtain drawn -- the camera is a little shaky, indicating 
      we re in SOMEONE S POV. 

    We DART across the face of the building to the next window 
      over, FREEZE on it for precisely ONE SECOND -- no curtain in 
      this window, but the room is dark inside -- 

      JUMP to the next window over and FREEZE on it. 

                                  VOICE
                          (O.S.)
                    I don t know -- think about 
                    something else --



      ...the voice belongs to PHILIP JENNINGS, 38, ALL-AMERICAN 
      HANDSOME. He stands with his back against an alley wall, 
      never taking his eyes off the building across the street. 

                                  PHILIP
                    -- take deep breaths.

      He s talking to ROB -- 28, BIG, TOUGH, but NERVOUS -- also 
      with his back against the alley wall. 

                                  ROB
                    It s just, they used to tell 
                    stories about this guy. He killed a 
                    lot of people.

                                  PHILIP
                    You know how guys like him killed 
                    people? They planned it for weeks, 
                    they always came up from behind. 
                    Fighting face to face, that s a 
                    different story.                                                                                    3.


                                  ROB
                    I heard one time he got in a bar 
                    fight with the entire Japanese 
                    Olympic Judo team. Took out four of 
                     em before the rest of  em ran.

                                  PHILIP
                    What year?  64 to  72 were pussies. 
                    Didn t even medal.

      Still, after a few seconds, Philip puts his right hand 
      against the alley wall, picks his left ankle up behind him, 
    and does a quad stretch.



      PHILIP S POV: 

      Freeze on a window in the building across the street for ONE 
      SECOND, jump to the next window, freeze on a window for ONE 
      SECOND, jump to the next window...  This continues as we 
      hear:

                                  PHILIP
                          (O.S.)
                    Time.

                                  ROB
                          (O.S.)
                    Minus twenty-two.

    END PHILIP S POV-- now we see Philip and Rob standing in the 
      alley, Philip s eyes moving methodically across the face of 
    the building across the street.                                                                                    4.


                                  PHILIP
                    No, I mean, what time is it.

                                  ROB
                    Oh, uh -- one-fifteen.

                                  PHILIP
                    Orioles are away in Los Angeles, 
                    probably just finishing up. You a 
                    baseball fan?

      BACK TO PHILIP S POV:

      ...he s between windows when he STOPS and JERKS BACK to the 
      PREVIOUS WINDOW -- THE EDGE OF THE CURTAIN IN THIS WINDOW 
      FLUTTERS TWICE.

                                  ROB
                          (O.S.)
                    I like football, I --

                                  PHILIP
                          (O.S.)
                    Third floor, two South. She s in.



      Timoshev walks down a street in a neighborhood of low-rise 
      housing projects, abandoned buildings, and garbage-strewn 
      lots.  The bus station glows like an oasis several blocks 
      behind him now.  

    He goes up to a group of young black men.  

                                  TIMOSHEV
                          (no Russian accent)
                    Have you seen any white people 
                    around here recently?

                                  YOUNG MAN
                    Otherwhite people?

                                  TIMOSHEV
                    Yes.

    The young man pauses, stares at Timoshev.

                                  YOUNG MAN
                    No.

                                  TIMOSHEV
                    Thank you.                                                                                    5.


      Timoshev walks away.  The young men look at each other -- 
      they want to go after him, but they can feel there s 
      something dangerous about this man.  They stay put.



      PHILIP S POV: CLOSE-UP on one window now. The PLAIN WHITE 
      CURTAIN FLUTTERS.

                                  PHILIP
                          (O.S.)
                    He s at the corner.

      Philip s line of sight JERKS DOWN from the window IN A BLUR 
    and REFOCUSES on the sidewalk right in front of the alley.



      Timoshev walks toward the alley. Past the alley, we see a 
      battered sign over a doorway -  ROOMS FOR RENT. 



      Philip waits, completely still -- Rob starts to sweat --



      Timoshev approaches the alley -- three feet away, he STOPS.  

      Timoshev looks up and down the street.  He looks at the 
      windows in the buildings.  He stares at the mouth of the 
      alley.



      Philip waits, listens --                                                                                     6.



      Timoshev DROPS HIS SUITCASE AND TAKES OFF RUNNING -- at the 
      SAME INSTANT Philip BOLTS OUT OF THE ALLEY and GOES AFTER 
      HIM.  Rob is RIGHT BEHIND PHILIP.

                                  PHILIP
                          (sotto, to Rob)
                    Don t get behind him.
                          (calling out)
                    Immigration!  We just want to talk.

                                  TIMOSHEV
                    HELP!  HELP!

      Timoshev turns a corner. As they run --

                                  PHILIP
                    FBI? CIA?

                                  TIMOSHEV
                    CALL THE POLICE!

                                  PHILIP
                    Fish and wildlife?

      Timoshev rips around another corner, which puts him closer to 
    Rob than to Philip.

                                  ROB
                    I can get him.

                                  PHILIP
                    Go.

      With a burst of speed, Rob moves in front of Philip, but he 
      gets RIGHT BEHIND Timoshev.

                                  PHILIP (CONT D)
                    Don t get behind --

      Timoshev SUDDENLY SLOWS and BENDS AT THE WAIST -- his RIGHT 
    ARM COMES UP BEHIND HIM as Rob CRASHES INTO HIS BACK.  

      Timoshev ACCELERATES OUT OF THE COLLISION as Rob CRUMPLES to 
    the ground.  We see a FLASH OF METAL in Timoshev s hand.

      Philip JUMPS OVER ROB.

      Philip GAINS on TIMOSHEV.  Staying to HIS SIDE, he ALMOST 
      GETS A HAND on him.  

      Timoshev turns another corner.  This street is LESS RUN-DOWN - 
      Timoshev is making his way to a better neighborhood.                                                                                    7.


      Philip is ALMOST NEXT TO TIMOSHEV - he KICKS AT TIMOSHEV S 
      ANKLE but Timoshev HOPS OVER THE KICK.  

      Timoshev SPINS AROUND with a BACKFIST aimed at Philip s head 
      that Philip barely dodges. Timoshev LUNGES at him and Philip 
      backpedals.

      A FURIOUS fight ensues. Despite his age, Timoshev is fast and 
      fluid. Philip and Timoshev fight in the same style - SHORT, 
      POWERFUL moves, KNEES and ELBOWS. They go for the BODY more 
      than the head. 

      Philip delivers an ELBOW to Timoshev s jaw that STAGGERS him, 
    and a KNEE to the GROIN before Timoshev can recover.  He 
      THROWS Timoshev to the ground and gets on top of him. 

      Timoshev SPINS over onto his back, his hand COMES OUT OF 
      NOWHERE with a KNIFE and THRUSTS up, it goes THROUGH PHILIP S 
      JACKET right over his chest -- 

      Philip GRABS Timoshev s wrist and pulls the knife BACK DOWN -- 

      A PEDESTRIAN turns the corner and stops to look at them --

      Philip twists Timoshev s wrist and grabs the knife from him.  
    He PUTS THE POINT OF THE BLADE TO TIMOSHEV S THROAT.  

                                  PHILIP (CONT D)
                    Ow!

      CLOSE-UP on the tip of the knife -- RED WITH BLOOD.

                                  TIMOSHEV
                    Sorry.

                                  PHILIP
                    Any final words?

                                  TIMOSHEV
                          (smiling)
                    I know you re not supposed to kill 
                    me.

                                  PHILIP
                    I don t think you understand how 
                    unpopular you are. I could deliver 
                    you in a hundred pieces and they d 
                    give me a separate medal for each 
                    one.

      Timoshev stops smiling.

      Philip puts the knife in his pocket and CUFFS him.                                                                                    8.


                                  PHILIP (CONT D)
                          (loud, for the pedestrian)
                    You have the right to remain 
                    silent.  You --

                                  TIMOSHEV
                    HE S NOT POLICE!  HE S NOT REAL 
                    POLICE!  HELP, CALL FOR HELP!

      A window opens in a house across the street.

      A TWO-DOOR 1977 CHEVROLET MONTE CARLO SCREECHES TO A STOP 
      next to Philip and Timoshev.  A hand with CRIMSON FINGERNAILS 
      pushes the door open, and ELIZABETH JENNINGS jumps out -- 37, 
      ATTRACTIVE, STRONG and FAST -- and NOT BLOND, but THE SAME 
      WOMAN WHO WAS WITH THE PASTY BUREAUCRAT -- she pulls the 
      front seat up for access to the rear of the car.  

      Philip pulls Timoshev up and pushes him into the back seat 
      with the classic  don t bump your head  cop move.

      Philip gets into the driver s seat, Elizabeth gets into the 
      back seat.  They drive away.



      ...carries him  down the street.

                                  PHILIP
                    You go in a John Doe.  If you live, 
                    don t go back to Boston.  Assume 
                    they re on you.

      Philip turns a corner -- there s an EMERGENCY ROOM entrance a 
      hundred yards away.  He puts Rob on his feet.  

                                  PHILIP (CONT D)
                    You gotta walk from here.

      Rob, clutching his stomach, takes a step.

                                  PHILIP (CONT D)
                    You were trained to surmount any
                    obstacle.  Go!

    Rob stands up straighter and walks toward the emergency room.  
      Philip runs back towards the car.



      Philip gets into the...



      Philip pulls up in front of a dark, empty DOCK.  

      Philip and Elizabeth get out.  They stare at a ship a few 
      hundred yards out to sea.

                                  PHILIP
                    Why is everyone so punctual in this 
                    business?

      Without looking, Elizabeth delivers a SHARP BACKKICK to the 
      Monte Carlo s OPEN PASSENGER SIDE DOOR behind her.  

    The massive door SLAMS SHUT on Timoshev s LEG as he tries to 
      wriggle out of the backseat.

                                  TIMOSHEV
                    Aahh!

      Elizabeth FLIPS THE SEAT RELEASE, pulls the passenger seat 
      forward, and unceremoniously hoists Timoshev back into the 
    car and onto the floor.  She gets in after him.  

      When she sits, Elizabeth plants one of her heels in 
      Timoshev s BALLS. 

      Philip gets in and starts to drive. 

      Quietly, so Elizabeth doesn t notice, Philip puts a hand 
      under his shirt and feels his chest. He takes the hand out 
    and looks at his right index finger in the dim glow of the 
      dashboard -- there s a drop of blood on it.                                                                                    12.


    Off Philip, more irritated than worried...

    And then Off Elizabeth, staring out the window...

                                      END TEASER                                                                                    13.


                                        ACT ONE



      A block-long concrete building - the sign out front reads: 
     J. EDGAR HOOVER BUILDING - FBI HEADQUARTERS. 



      Philip, carrying a briefcase, comes out the front door.  He s 
      fully dressed for work now, in an ARMANI SUIT.  

    He turns on the sprinkler. He gazes with satisfaction at his 
      beautiful green lawn.

    He turns around and looks at his house -- a middle-class 
      townhouse with attached garage -- he turns and looks at the 
      other houses in his suburban development -- identical, 
      pristine -- he SMILES -- HE LOVES IT HERE.



      Philip, briefcase in hand, walks down a street crowded with 
      commuters on their way home. He stops at a corner and looks 
    at the building across the street. The sign out front reads:

     J. EDGAR HOOVER BUILDING - FBI HEADQUARTERS 

    The street light changes from  DON T WALK  to  WALK.  

      Philip stares at the light -  WALK. 

    He turns and crosses the street the other way.



    The family approaches A BLUE MUSTANG with a WHITE RACING 
      STRIPE.

                                  HENRY
                    Holy shit!

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Henry.

                                  PHILIP
                    Don t fall in love, it s just until 
                    the car is fixed.

                                  HENRY
                    Can I drive it?

                                  PHILIP
                    Did you learn how to drive since 
                    this morning?



    The Mustang pulls up in front of the Jennings  townhouse.                                                                                     29.


                                  PAIGE
                    Why are you meeting a client so 
                    late?

    As Henry opens his door and the DOME LIGHT goes on, Philip 
      turns around and looks at Paige.

                                  PHILIP
                    He s coming in on a late flight, 
                    it s more of a social meeting.

    Off Philip, smiling at Paige as he lies to her face...



      ...onto the lawn.  Philip and Elizabeth glance over at a 
      moving van parked a few doors down the block.

    As Philip and the kids get into the Mustang, Elizabeth 
      watches a mother and her teenage son talking to the moving 
      men.  The boy looks about fifteen.  He s handsome.  As the 
      movers go to work, he gets up on the truck and helps.                                                                                    36.


    Off Elizabeth, focused on the boy...



      Elizabeth stands in an outdoor field with the same TRAINER 
      from the previous flashback. She holds a COMBAT KNIFE, blade 
      down, cross-body. Her face has BRUISES on it. 

      PULL BACK to reveal a SPONGE DUMMY full of CUTS and HOLES.

                    Less arc.

      Elizabeth s arm FLASHES OUT -- her knife goes STRAIGHT at the 
      dummy s THROAT, SLASHING at the last possible second.

                                  TRAINER (CONT D)
                    Good.

      TIMOSHEV strolls up with a MAN IN UNIFORM, obviously the 
      superior of everyone there. The two men stand back a few 
      feet, observing.                                                                                     37.

                    Don t let them see, Elizabeth. Use 
                    your technique.

      Elizabeth stares at the dummy.

    Off her eyes, blazing, trying to stay in control...

    END FLASHBACK



    The Jennings family stands in front of a townhouse that s 
      identical to their townhouse.  SANDRA, 30 s, opens the door.                                                                                    40.


                                  SANDRA
                    You came!

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Just for a second, to bring 
                    brownies and welcome you to the 
                    neighborhood.

                                  SANDRA
                    Come in, come in.

    The Jennings walk in...



      Philip, in NIKE WAFFLE TRAINERS, jogs.



    As Philip jogs, he reenters the present from his flashback.

      PHILIP S POV: he SCANS left to right, taking in facial 
      characteristics...

    END PHILIP S POV.

      Philip stops at a PHONE BOOTH.  He PUTS A DIME in and dials.

                                  VOICE
                          (O.S.)
                    Arlington Methodist.

                                  PHILIP
                    County Liaison, please.

      After a brief pause...

                                  VOICE
                          (O.S.)
                    Can I help you?

                                  PHILIP
                    Sergeant Vaugn, Fairfax Sheriff s 
                      Department.  We re looking for a 
                    John Doe would have come in 
                    Thursday night, male caucasian, six-
                    one, knife wound to the stomach...

      Philip listens for a second. 

                                  PHILIP (CONT D)
                    Okay, thank you.

    Off Philip, grimacing at bad news...



      Philip, coming back from his jog, is opening his front door 
      when Stan approaches.

                                  PHILIP
                    Hey, neighbor!  How s the move-in 
                    coming?

                                  STAN
                    Long way to go.                                                                                    49.


                                  PHILIP
                    You wanna beer?

                                  STAN
                    No, but I could use jumper cables.  
                    My wife s car, which we drove out 
                    here from St. Louis last week, I 
                    think the strain finally got to it.  
                    My cables are in a box somewhere.

      Philip looks at Stan for a second -- is Stan FUCKING WITH 
      HIM? -- then a LITTLE SMILE spreads across Philip s face.

      Stan, who just wants jumper cables, thinks it s a friendly 
      smile and smiles back.

                                  PHILIP
                    Come on in.

      Philip opens the door and they walk...



      Philip walks toward the rear of the stadium, his eyes on a 
      security guard at the player entrance. Philip goes up to an 
      unguarded, heavy double-door in the shadows. He takes a TINY 
      METAL ROD out of his wallet, pushes it into the door lock, 
      moves it around -- he PULLS the door open and goes into...



      Philip and Elizabeth stand at the edge of a cliff, swinging 
      Timoshev s body, wrapped and weighted-down in a tarp, back 
    and forth. 

      They let go -- the body flies out over the edge. They watch 
    it fall, then splash into the water below.

    As they turn to go, Elizabeth PUSHES Philip against a tree. 
    She kisses him hard. Still perilously close to the cliff, 
      they grab at each other s belts, pull each other to the 
      ground - it s almost a contest for who s going to overpower 
      who, and  - Philip may be stronger, but the wrong move could 
      send them both over the cliff. 

      Elizabeth pins Philip on his back, gets his pants down - as 
    she starts to slide back and forth on top of him, she POUNDS 
    on his chest - Philip takes the blows easily. Until finally, 
    he FLIPS Elizabeth onto her back - away from the cliff - at 
      first she struggles, but then she lets Philip use his 
      strength to subdue her. Philip drives into her but cradles 
      her, for once, fragile-looking body underneath him at the 
      same time. 

    OFF ELIZABETH, something peaceful in her face as her 
      breathing gets faster and faster...



      Philip and a small group of parents watch their kids play in 
      a little league game. Henry is in the outfield.

    The batter hits a long flyball, over Henry s head. Henry 
      races back for it.                                                                                     63.


    It looks out of his reach, but he DIVES, STRETCHES -- Philip 
      JUMPS TO HIS FEET, holding his breath -- Henry HITS THE 
      GROUND with the ball squeezed into the top of his mitt.

      Philip s face lights up. A cheer rises from the small crowd.

    Off Philip, a genuine, happy smile on his face...



      Philip walks down a street in a suburban village.  He turns a 
      corner and goes into...



      Philip walks down a street. He stops in front of a modest 
      suburban house.  He listens for a second, then walks around 
    to the back.

    He looks through a chain-link fence.  He silently opens the 
      fence and walks into...



      ...a back yard.  A man, his back to Philip, stands over a 
      barbecue.  Philip walks toward him.  He seems to want to get 
    as close to the man as possible before the man hears him.

      Philip stops a few feet behind the man and GIVES A LITTLE 
      COUGH.  The man turns around...

      It s ERROL, the TATTOOED MAN WHO LEERED AT PAIGE in the mall.  

      Errol IS CONFUSED.  Philip LOOKS HIM IN THE EYE, waiting a 
      second for Errol s instincts to kick in.  Then A LITTLE SMILE 
      spreads across Philip s face and he STEPS TOWARD HIM, but 
      slowly -- he s letting Errol go first.

      Errol DROPS HIS BEER and SWINGS at Philip.  Philip slips the 
      punch, HITS Errol with a SHORT SERIES of POWERFUL, ECONOMICAL 
      PUNCHES.  

      Errol looks like he s going down, but then he KNEES Philip in 
    the stomach and hits him with a powerful punch to the head. 

      Errol lets loose a HOOK punch that would kill a horse --
      Philip slips it and delivers a tremendous KICK that SHATTERS 
      Errol s JAW.

      Errol lies on the ground, his massive body LIMP, his face 
      barely bleeding but the upper and lower halves look like 
      they ve been detached and slid in different directions.

      Philip looks down at him.                                                                                     67.


    He goes over to the grill and puts a hamburger on a bun. He 
      squeezes mustard onto the burger.

    As he walks away, Philip takes a bite of the burger. He 
      throws the rest of it against the fence.



      Stan is in front of a garage door.  The street is deserted -- 
      it s late.  Is this hisgarage?                                                                                      74.


      It s hard to tell -- the garage doors in the townhouse 
      development are all identical.  He turns the handle and pulls 
    the door up VERY slowly.

      When the garage door is open just a few feet, Stan GETS DOWN 
    ON THE GROUND, SLIDES UNDER the door, and QUIETLY slides the 
      door CLOSED AGAIN.  He s inside...
