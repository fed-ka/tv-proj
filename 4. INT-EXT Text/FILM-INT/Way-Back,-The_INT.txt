A long rectangular building, the walls lined with two
tiered bunks of rough-hewn logs. In the centre - a metal
stove with a chimney stretching out through the roof. A
dim central bulb illuminates some 150 men, aged from 16
to 60, most sitting or lying on their bunks. Some wear
scraps of army uniform, or civilian clothing, others in
prison issued padded jackets. Some, from the Asian
territories, still ear something of their national
costume. Included among them are groups of foreigners
from recently occupied countries and a Babel of languages
drifts through the fetid air. It's a wide ranging mix of
types, of race, of class. They're miserable, starving
and ill. There is no camp camaraderie and they eye each
other with indifference or suspicion. Most of these men
are political prisoners, known as 'Politicals' or
'S8ers', after the section of the Soviet Penal Code that
has put them here.
Near the stove, and contrasted with the 'Politicals', a
group are gathered about a card game on a lower bunk.
These men look healthier, and are further distinguished
by their tattoos.

These are the URKI, some dozen of them, regular
criminals, and from their manner the undisputed masters
of the block.
Sitting facing each other - VALKA, thirties, heavily
tattooed, flash of a steel-caped tooth. His opponent,
BOHDAN, older, and the 'Pakhan', the 'boss' of this
criminal gang. Bohdan shuffles a deck of home-made
cards.
[All DIALOGUE IN THE CAMP IS IN RUSSIAN, SUB-TITLED,
EXCEPT WHERE INDICATED THAT INMATES SPEAK ENGLISH].
BOHDAN
(IN RUSSIAN)
What've you got?
VALKA removes his coat, passes it to BOHDAN who examines
it briefly.
BOHDAN (CONT'D)
Think I want your stinking lice
farm?
VALKA
Polish tailor.
He shows the label.
VALKA (CONT'D)
See? From Krakov. Good as new.
BOHDAN nods to his minder who opens a battered wooden
suitcase - a glimpse of hoarded food. The minder puts
his hand on a lump of bread lying beside a length of
sausage. BOHDAN nods. The bread is placed beside the
coat.
VALKA (CONT'D)
And the sausage.
BOHDAN stares at him, shakes his head, 'no'.
VALKA (CONT'D)
Bohdan, you're a dog's prick, I
swear. I hope you die with an axe
in your skull, and your balls
ripped out.
The swearing is more or less a ritual and provokes no
reaction.
VALKA (CONT'D)
OK. For the bread.

3 CONTINUED: ( 2) 3
BOHDAN shuffles and deals. He separates his cards with
the long fingernail of his little finger. In a few rapid
plays, VALKA is left coat-less.
Apart from the half-dozen thugs surrounding the players,
the game is watched by two 'Politicals', who have just
entered with a load of wood for the stove. The elder,
SMITH, a hard-face man in his late forties, the other
ANDREI, early twenties. VALKA signals to YURI who takes
three 'tailor-made' cigarettes from his pocket, passes
them carefully to VALKA who lays them before BOHDAN.
BOHDAN
For the bread.
VALKA
For the bread, and the sausage,
bastard!
BOHDAN enjoying himself.
BOHDAN
Throw in that crappy shirt you're
wearing and I might be tempted.
Smiles from the gang. VALKA knows he's being mocked but
he's desperate. His eyes flick down to the sausage.
Then he takes off his shirt. He sits bare-chested, a
tattooed portrait of LENIN on his left breast looking
across at STALIN on his right. BOHDAN deals, and again
VALKA loses.
VALKA's mate YURI places a padded prison jacket over his
bony shoulders, which he shrugs off irritably, then
offers to BOHDAN.
BOHDAN (CONT'D)
I don't play for regulation issue
crap.
VALKA lights a cigarette.
BOHDAN (CONT'D)
All done, Valka?
VALKA tries to conceal his mounting tension behind a veil
of cool.
VALKA
I go on credit.
BOHDAN
'Credit'?

VALKA nervously fingers an aluminium crucifix hanging by
a cord from his neck. Etched on the cross a naked woman.
BOHDAN (CONT'D)
You're already in debt.
VALKA's anxious eyes. They settle on SMITH by the stove.
He speaks in carefully articulated English.
VALKA
Come here.
SMITH returns the stare, then slowly approaches.
VALKA (CONT'D)
Take off your coat.
A silence, the criminal gang sensing a showdown. There's
something about SMITH, something steely, unpredictable.
The fire crackles loudly. SMITH all the while holding
VALKA's stare.
[THE DIALOGUE RETURNS TO RUSSIAN.]
VALKA (CONT'D)
Worth shit!
He looks at SMITH's companion.
VALKA (CONT'D)
You.
ANDREI goes pale, removes his coat to reveal a decent-
looking patterned wool sweater. He offers the coat.
VALKA (CONT'D)
Let's have the sweater.
ANDREI
Take the coat.
VALKA
I want the sweater.
ANDREI doesn't move.
VALKA (CONT'D.) (CONT'D)
Your babushka make it for you?
Come on, hand it over.
ANDREI is visibly shaking.

ANDREI
You have no authority, here.
VALKA gets up, moves slowly to ANDREI, a smile on his
lips. Then he casually reaches down as if to tuck his
trousers deeper into his boots, reaches for something,
and in one slow balletic movement, swings up and
stretches out his hand to ANDREI, and ANDREI sobs and
leans to one side.
BOHDAN
Was that really necessary?
In the dim light ANDREI's face is grey as he sags to the
floor. None of the other prisoners move to help him, nor
do they show any sign of concern, as VALKA places the
knife back in his boot and returns to the game. YURI
steps forward and strips the sweater from the dead man,
handing it on to VALKA, who passes it to BOHDAN. BOHDAN
examines it professionally, wipes a little blood off his
hands.
BOHDAN (CONT'D)
OK. For the sausage.
The game resumes.
FADE TO BLACK.
FADE UP ON:
Close on the barrack stove, the underwear drying,
KHABAROV's hands into the frame.
As the prisoners rise, follow a hand to hand exchange of
the set of underwear for a hank of tobacco. KHABAROV
having done the deal splits the tobacco with LAZAR.
Moving quickly to complete a second deal, KHABAROV swaps
half his share of the tobacco with another prisoner for
two slices of bread. He waits until the last of the
men leave then he carefully breaks off a corner from one
piece of bread, concealing the rest in a hiding place in
the dirt at the base of his bunk - a glimpse of a cache
of hoarded food and other items.

The saved morsel he places on his tongue, and closes his
eyes. He doesn't chew, just lets it dissolve like the
Eucharist. Then it's gone in a slow swallow and he opens
his eyes. He can hear a guard shouting outside, but he
hesitates, carefully licking his fingers. He stares at
his hand. Close on a spot between his fingers - there's
a crumb there. Into frame, the tip of his tongue as it
slowly and carefully retrieves the tiny speck of bread.
The men sitting or lying on their bunks, a little
conversation here and there but most have withdrawn into
themselves, just glad to have survived another day.
JANUSZ looks about him, KHABAROV still by his side.
JANUSZ's attention is caught by the tattooed group
playing cards by the stove. VALKA is playing BOHDAN
again, his losing streak continuing. KHABAROV speaks
just above a whisper.
KHABAROV
The 'Urki'.
JANUSZ
Who are they?
KHABAROV
Professional criminals, your
ordinary run of the mill murderers
and thieves, don't stare at them.
The guards let them run things in
here. They are to be feared.

Why would they let them 'run
things'?

From the far reaches of the Soviet

KHABAROV considers a moment, then leads him away from the
surrounding prisoners. He lowers his voice to a whisper.
KHABAROV
You should be more careful.

He leans closer to JANUSZ.

VOSS and KAZIK are by the stove unwinding their long foot-
cloths that most wear in place of socks. KAZIK hangs the
damp cloths on the stove to dry and sets out to examine
his toes, which are in poor shape, suffering the early
stages of frostbite. TOMASZ sits nearby sketching the
scene on a sheet of birch-bark, using a piece of
charcoal.
WIDER to see VALKA, looking on in admiration. TOMASZ is
uneasy despite the implied compliment. VALKA hands him a
sheet of paper, and the stub of a pencil.

24 A BUNK NEAR THE STOVE - SAME TIME 24
BOHDAN lies on his bunk, surrounded by several of his
tattooed henchmen listening to a story. The storyteller,
looking rather uncomfortable, is ZORAN. His Russian is
good but for a moment his memory fails him as he
desperately tries to recall the next beat in the story.
BOHDAN
Keep going and you'll get some
bread - so how does this 'Long
John Silver' find the treasure?
YURI
I knew a type like that. Remember
Igor? He had one leg.
BOHDAN
Shut up.
(Then to ZORAN)
Go on.
The story resumes, ZORAN giving it all he's got, when
VALKA appears a sketch in his hand. He passes it to
BOHDAN. CLOSE on the sketch - a lusty naked woman.
VALKA makes a gesture implying masturbation. BOHDAN
examines the drawing before licking the back of it,
lifting his shirt, sticking it to his chest, then
lowering his shirt again. He waves VALKA away.
25 JANUSZ'S BUNK - SAME TIME 25
CLOSE on a shirt.
The shirt lies on JANUSZ's bunk and it's moving. A tiny
subtle movement, but just perceptible, the movement
caused by hundreds of lice.

watching over his shoulder.

He picks up the shirt and walks toward the door of the
barrack, indicating JANUSZ should follow. As he passes
his bunk he scoops up his own shirt.
KHABAROV and JANUSZ enter, having buried the shirt in the
snow. KHABAROV indicates LAZAR, sitting on a bunk , and
whispers.
KHABAROV
That's Lazar. He was architect.
In Kiev.Now he is grave robber -
me too. (Whispers) We sneak out
at night.Through the wire.
He moves away.
The men are stirring, struggling up to face another day,
when the door opens, and in a flurry of snow, GUARD NO. 1
enters with another soldier. He orders SMITH, JANUSZ and
his group to fall out. As he passes SMITH -
GUARD NO. 1
(IN RUSSIAN)
You don't like being out in the
cold, do you Cowboy?
And as he moves away SMITH mutters to JANUSZ.
SMITH
Might as well have shot us
yesterday.
JANUSZ and the others look at him.
SMITH (CONT'D)
We're for the mine.
A labyrinth of twisting tunnels leading down into the
frozen earth. Dim lights silhouette ghostly figures
working with pick and shovel. Occasionally the muffled
sound of a distant explosion as a gallery is blasted yet
deeper. Mingling with these eerie sounds something more
sinister - the hacking coughs of those who've done the
most time in this frozen hell.
The man working beside JANUSZ wields a pick, JANUSZ
shovelling out the rock as it breaks up. The man pauses
to light a smoke. His fingers have moulded themselves
into the shape of his pick-handle - they are like hooks,
the man unable to straighten his fingers. He holds the
cigarette with the tips of his fingers, as if his hand
was an artificial limb. JANUSZ looks around desperately,
fighting off an overwhelming feeling of claustrophobia.
Despite the cold, sweat beads on his forehead.
KAZIK and a man known as 'THE PROF', drag a cart laden
with rock up a steep incline. They wear horse collars
attached to the cart by leather harnesses.

31 CONTINUED: 31
THE PROF's wasted frame and sallow complexion are in
contrast to his lively intelligent eyes. He says
something to KAZIK in Russian. He shakes his head. He
doesn't speak Russian. THE PROF tries German, then
English.
KAZIK
English, yes.
They share a smile.
PROF
I was only saying, these collars -
the same used by ancient Egyptian
people.
KAZIK
Yes, but on their horses probably.
PROF
No. Same. On people.
KAZIK
How do you know that?
PROF
I was professor of Egyptology.
Leningrad University.
KAZIK manages a look at his companion, before putting
even more effort into dragging the load.
A man, enveloped in clouds of white steam, points a long
pipe at the frozen rock and gravel - the heat making it
easier for the pick and shovel men to dig. This is the
'POINT-MAN', and he opens and shuts valves on the pipe-
stem which regulates the hot steam that travels along
pipes leading back to a primitive boiler. Men try to
warm themselves by working near the POINT-MAN, and when
the guards are not around they clutch the pipes in their
hands gaining a few moments of precious warmth.
SMITH knows how to work the system and has found a spot
here working beside the POINT-MAN. He looks across to
see JANUSZ staggering up the slope toward the distant
mine entrance, where a guard can be seen silhouetted
against the light. He watches a moment, something not
right about JANUSZ. He lays his shovel aside and hurries
after him.
27.
JANUSZ scrambling toward the surface. He stumbles, falls
to his knees. He looks down, sees something on the
ground.
JANUSZ'S VISION - DAY
Something buried in the dirt and rubble - paving stones.
He clears away the debris to reveal a stone path.
Looking up he sees the path leads to a gate framed by a
hedge. His P.O.V. as he moves up the path to the gate.
His unseen hand opens the gate. Now the view is of the
path as he walks forward - a series of worn flagstones,
then the camera tilts up to see a closed front door. A
pan to the left of the door - to see a loose brick in the
wall.
CLOSE on JANUSZ, as SMITH is suddenly beside him,
grabbing his arm and swinging him into the darkness of an
adjoining tunnel.
SMITH
Are you crazy? They'll shoot you.
JANUSZ
Got to get out!
SMITH stares at him. He's delirious and begins to shake
with cold. SMITH grabs his shoulder and drags him back
to where the POINT'-MAN works, thrusting JANUSZ's hands
around the pipe. The POINT-MAN waves them away but SMITH
bribes him with a slice of bread. SMITH turns back to
JANUSZ - the warmth of the pipe beginning to have its
effect.
JANUSZ (CONT'D)
It can be done.
SMITH
What can be done?
JANUSZ
He knows a way through the wire.
SMITH slaps a hand over his mouth, glancing at the Point-
Man, before dragging JANUSZ further away.

Nothing is for nothing in the

energy, your spirit. You feed his
'dream' of escape. You help keep
him alive. He's no more than a
leech.
JANUSZ
You're a cold bastard, Mister.

I'm still alive, that's all I
know. But I won't be in six

And what's that?
SMITH
Compassion. If anything happens
to me, I'm counting on you
carrying me.
JANUSZ knows he's not joking.
JANUSZ has a puzzled KHABAROV by the arm, guiding him
back to the door.
In the last minutes before lights out the would-be
escapees make discreet preparations. Clothing and other
items are traded for food and tobacco. The COOK and
BOHDAN are at the center of the camp black-market and
most of the trading is done with them. TOMASZ trades
more pornographic sketches with BOHDAN while KAZIK tries
to trade his scarf for a pair of boots - his own being in
poor shape. VOSS sits beside him, and notices that KAZIK
does not look directly at his shoes or the scarf, but is
doing everything by feel. As they move away VOSS
whispers to him.
VOSS
You can't see, can you?
A look of panic crosses the boy's face.
KAZIK
(WHISPERS)
Don't leave me behind!
VOSS conflicted.
KAZIK (CONT'D)
Promise me, Andrejs! I could keep
a hand on your shoulder by night,
and in the day I can see just
fine. I won't hold you up.
Please don't tell them. I'll die
here.
JANUSZ and SMITH sit in a darkened corner working on
LAZAR. They want to know how to get through the wire.
He is reluctant until SMITH produces a wristwatch from
his boot. The strapless watch, of good make, settles the
deal, just as the light flickers and goes out plunging
the barracks into darkness.
The wooden building creaks and heaves like a ship at sea
as the storm builds into a fully fledged blizzard. The
sounds of the sleeping men, the usual cries and groans,
hacking coughs, all mix into the howl of the storm.
CLOSE on the conspirators lying awake - SMITH, VOSS,
KAZIK, TOMASZ and ZORAN. SMITH looks across to JANUSZ,
catches his eye. A signal from JANUSZ, 'not yet'.
KHABAROV too, is awake. He jumps at any unexpected
sound, checks his horde of food in the hiding place at
the base of his bunk, as if expecting at any moment to be
attacked and robbed. He sees a shadow. Someone moving
about near him, a look of terror on his face.
LATER,
JANUSZ lies on his back listening to the storm. A
movement beside him, then a knife pressed against his
throat. It's VALKA. He grins, steel-capped teeth, his
cross dangling from his neck. JANUSZ goes still.
VALKA
There are no secrets here.
JANUSZ
What do you want?
VALKA
The game goes against me. Small
debt - lose fingers. Big debt,
they take head. Me, big debt.
But one thing I never gamble is my
Wolf.
He removes the knife from JANUSZ's throat, tilts the
blade to show a wolf's head incised into the blade.
VALKA (CONT'D)
In forest you need knife to
survive. Without? A miracle.
He leans in close to JANUSZ's ear.
VALKA (CONT'D)
You need a knife, and I need
miracle to get me out of here.
With a conjurer's ease he spins the knife in his fingers
and arches his eyebrows - 'Deal'?

It's like an Indian sweat-lodge as the fugitives sit

sweat running down their faces. The voices closer still.

He spreads out a piece of cloth on the snow at his feet.
JANUSZ (CONT'D)
Alright, let's see what you've
got.
No one moves. JANUSZ reaches into his own pockets,
emptying the contents onto the cloth - several slices of
bread, half a kilo of buckwheat, some dried meat, a
swatch of tobacco. SMITH goes next with a larger store
of bread and a little salt. VOSS has a collection of
small fish-heads which he adds to the store. TOMASZ,
KAZIK and ZORAN make their contributions. They stare
grimly at their limited food supply. Various other items
are added - a razor blade, a length of cord, a piece of
barbed-wire, etc. SMITH picks up the barbed wire,
examines it.

He puts the goods back in the sack and goes to place it
inside his coat.

JANUSZ reaches out for the sack of food. VALKA glances
at the others, then passes it to him. TOMASZ has already
begun to organize seven slices of bread laying one of
VOSS's fish heads on each. one. He hands them out. They
eat in silence, savoring every bite. ZORAN removes the
fish-head, passing it back to TOMASZ. Then he places a
thin layer of snow on the bread like a canape. He eats
daintily, his little finger extended like a dowager at a
tea party, raising a smile from his exhausted companions.

SMITH walking through the vast cave, his attention caught
by two massive holes in the roof. He walks on toward
their camp outside an opening at the far end.
Sleeping figures by the fire. TOMASZ tosses and turns,
muttering in his sleep. JANUSZ is awake as is VALKA who
sits close beside him. A whispered conversation -
VALKA
Who will be first?
JANUSZ looks at him.
JANUSZ
You mean the first to die?
VALKA nods, indicates TOMASZ.
VALKA

But better if it was him.
He nods toward ZORAN.

A75 LATER, NIGHT
A75
It is ZORAN's turn on watch and he stands near the
entrance to the cave, his blanket about his shoulders,
looking out into the still night. Behind him a low
growling sound, coming from deep in the cave. He turns,
a look of terror on his face. He can see nothing but a
dim light deep in the cave where moonlight penetrates
through two large holes in the cave roof. He wakes
JANUSZ, alerting him to the sound. JANUSZ in turn wakes
VALKA, and after taking burning sticks from the fire they
walk back inside the vast cave toward the source of the
sound, VALKA drawing his knife.
75
The dim light shows a wolf-pack growling as they pick at
a carcass on the cave floor. They drop their bones and
face the intruders, baring their fangs, all now growling.
On a signal from JANUSZ they rush the wolves, who run
back toward another exit from the cave. MR. SMITH,
TOMASZ and VOSS come hurrying to join them, woken by all
the barking and shouting.
VALKA falls on part of the carcass, cutting off chunks of
raw meat. The others do likewise. Wider on the group,
down on all fours chewing on the remains of the kill,
only JANUSZ stands back, watching them.
76
Some sleep on, others stir, their movements slow and
listless. They are near the end. This has been JANUSZ's
point of view as he packs a few scraps of food into his
pockets and picks up his staff. Those awake stare at
him.

Sleeping figures. A gentle tip-tapping sound. VOSS
opens his eyes. Staring back at him from the doorway,
half a dozen sheep. He nudges TOMASZ who wakes sleepily,
takes his eye-line. Carefully, slowly, they rise, VOSS
drawing his deer-bone knife. Then they move. The sheep
retreat, bumping into each other, and outside the chase
is on. TOMASZ tackles a ewe and VOSS approaches with a
knife, but JANUSZ is behind him, grabs his arm.

No! Andrejs, no!
VOSS tries to free his arm.
JANUSZ (CONT'D)
Don't kill it!
TOMASZ
Why not? We're hungry!
JANUSZ
You want the locals after us too?
They break into Polish, a blazing argument, months of
pent up frustration. VOSS picks up the sheep and carries
it inside the ruin.
Milk squirting into their aluminium bowl as VOSS expertly
milks the ewe, IRENA and ZORAN holding it steady.
There are bloodstains on the floor, and the wind howling
about the building makes a haunting accompaniment. IRENA
and VOSS are alone inside.
IRENA
What happened here?
VOSS
The same as happened in Russia.
Churches closed, priests shot or
taken to camps, religion banned.
They came to my church, in Latvia.
Destroyed everything, declared it
a 'museum'. Later that night,
there was a lone guard. A boy.

VOSS (CONT-D)
I strangled him until his eyes
popped right out of his head.
Valka knew somehow. Knew I'd
killed in cold blood.
He bows his head. IRENA looks up at him, and they stand
together in silence, but for the moaning wind.
The LAMA and the OFFICIAL sit opposite the group. Tea is
served. The official speaks English with difficulty, and
as in Mongolia, he addresses the elder of the group - MR.
SMITH.
OFFICIAL
India? Yes. There is the track
to Sikkim, over the mountains.
Many people go there.
SMITH
And food?
OFFICIAL
Small villages there. They give
food. Wood for fire. Yes, but
you don't go now.
CLOSE on JANUSZ, intensely following the conversation.

213 CONTINUED: 213
JANUSZ
Why can't we go now?
OFFICIAL
If big snow come - very difficult.
You wait here until Spring. This
family keep you.
He confers with the LAMA.
JANUSZ
(TO SMITH)
That's three months.
OFFICIAL
(indicates the LAMA)
He go to Lhasa. Get permission
for to stay. Only to Spring. Not
possible foreigners stay Tibet.
SMITH bows his head, mutters thanks, all of the group
doing likewise.
THE SHEPHERD has seen JANUSZ, ZORAN and VOSS to their
quarters. He passes VOSS a battered oil-lamp and retires
with much bowing. They settle on the straw covered
floor, laying out their heavy wool fleeces and blankets
given to them by the shepherd's wife.
ZORAN
Well, we can't cross in Winter.
JANUSZ
He said it was 'difficult'.
SMITH comes in, and they make room for him in the cramped
space.
ZORAN
I'm going to sleep 'till Spring.
Like a bear in a cave. What about
you, Mister?
SMITH settles with his back to the wall, draws up his
sheepskin.
SMITH
I'm going to Lhasa.
The others are stunned by this.
(CONTINUED)
110.
214 CONTINUED: 214
SMITH (CONT'D)
The Lama has a contact - maybe get
me out through China. There's a
U.S. military mission there.
They don't like it. A feeling he's deserting them,
breaking up the team.
ZORAN
'Looking after number one.' Isn't
that what Americans say?
SMITH
Zoran?
ZORAN eventually looks at him.
SMITH (CONT'D)
We escaped. We made it.
VOSS blows out the lamp. Silvery moonlight from a small
window.
ZORAN
He's right. I just realized it.
VOSS
Realized what?
ZORAN
Apart from a few mountains, we're
there. We made it.
VOSS
Not all of us.
ZORAN
No. Not all of us.
Their thoughts drift back to their lost companions.
ZORAN (CONT'D)
What will you do, Mister? When
you get home.
SMITH
'Home'?
Z ORAN
Build metros?
SMITH
Might drift for a while.
(CONTINUED)
214 CONTINUED: (2)
ZORAN
(LAUGHS)
Haven't you had enough of that?
CLOSE on JANUSZ, hardly listening, his thoughts
elsewhere. Their late-night conversation drifts over
him.
VOSS
I will fight. First Germans, then
Russians.
ZORAN
Then re-build your church?
VOSS
I will die fighting.
This statement has an oddly prophetic sound. JANUSZ look
across at him.
ZORAN
I'm going to get Tomasz's pictures
to a newspaper, or get them
published somehow. Then I'm going
to cook his chicken - but with
extra salt just to annoy him.
Chuckles from the group.
SMITH
And you, Janusz?
VOSS (TO SMITH)
As long as the Communists are in
Poland, he can't go back.
ZORAN
They'd shoot you wouldn't they,
Janusz?
They settle down to sleep, outside the wind is picking
up.
JANUSZ
I'll just keep on going. Until
it's over. Keep on walking.
SMITH looks through the gloom to where JANUSZ sits -
moonlight slashes the side of his face, but he can't
quite see his eyes.
CLOSE on JANUSZ. He's wide awake. No thought of sleep.
112.
215 - OMIT
ZORAN and VOSS agitated at the discovery that JANUSZ has
gone. Much coming and going in and out of the hut,
checking that he isn't somewhere close by. Only SMITH
remains undisturbed as he sits with his back against the
wall, the ghost of a smile on his lips. He expected
nothing less.
A WOMAN sitting by a window. She's in her early
seventies, and she looks up expectantly on hearing the
door closing in the hallway. At the entrance to the room
appears a young man in Polish cavalry uniform - YOUNG
JANUSZ, as he was just before the war. He smiles at his
wife. Cut back to the seat by the window to see his
pretty YOUNG WIFE, as she was back in 1939. YOUNG
JANUSZ, smiling broadly, crosses toward her. Cut back to
his WIFE of 1989 - on her face there are lines of
suffering which fade as she smiles up at him. She's
waited a long time for him to come home. On JANUSZ now
as he sits opposite her, and for the first time we see
him as he is in 1989 - also in his early seventies.
Without a word he reaches across the table and takes her
hand in his.
FADE TO BLACK.
