          FADE IN:

  11EXT. LAKE - DAY (STOCK)

          A serene glassy lake stretches out before us, surrounded
          by trees and mountains.  Peaceful sounds of nature; birds,
            crickets, frogs, etc. are slowly replaced by a MYSTERIOUS
          GROANING HUM, almost like the sound whales make, except
          bigger, lower, more ominous.  The sound builds, the nature
          sounds building with it, as if something is about to
          happen, then CRACK! -- and complete silence -- as a tiny
            vibration ripples across the surface of the lake.


  22EXT. WORDEN ROAD - DAY

            A tree-lined country road which probably doesn't see much
          traffic.  Nature sounds slowly return as the VIEW REVEALS:

          A small TRUCK with a CAMPER SHELL, its front end SMASHED
          by contact with a large TREE.

          Walt's cruiser is parked haphazardly on the side of the
          road, driver's door open, as if he's just seen the wreck
          and pulled off in a hurry.  WALT moves towards the car,
          radio in hand, calling in for help.

                                        WALT
                                (into radio)
                        Yeah, the Worden road, about two
                        miles north of the bridge.  Send
                        an ambulance.

          Walt steps closer to the car and looks inside.  After a
          moment, he clicks the radio and speaks again.

                                        WALT
                        You'd better send out the coroner
                          instead.

          WE MOVE IN to see the BODY in the front seat of the car. 
          It's a WOMAN, her hands still clutching the steering wheel,
          her mouth open as if she's screaming in fright. 

                                        WALT
                        What the hell --





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: INSTINCT - TEASER - 3/5/04 - GREEN          2.

          He leans in, scrutinizing the woman's face.  The camera
          moves closer to see TINY RED SLASHES, crusted over with
          blood, crisscrossing the woman's face and neck.  Even her
          clothes have been shredded.

          Off Walt's look...


  33INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

          PURDY stands in front of a hall half-full with STUDENTS. 
          We pick him up mid-lecture -- but this isn't the cool
          calm Purdy we're used to, this is a Purdy possessed by
          the spirit, sleeves rolled up, perspiration rolling off
          his forehead, talking more to himself than the students. 
          He seems haunted, wracked with inner demons.

                                        PURDY
                        ...No, what I'm talking about is
                        not at odds with a literal
                          interpretation of Revelation as a
                          prophecy of things to come...

          He turns and looks at his audience, taking a dramatic
          pause.  He's really holding their attention.  Actually
          he's kind of scaring them.

                                        PURDY
                        The Book of Revelation is not
                        about some battle in a distant
                        land, but about our own lives...
                        today. 

          A pretty female student raises her hand.  Purdy
            acknowledges her.

                                        EAGER STUDENT
                        But with the war in Iraq... I
                        mean, the Bible says a leader
                        will invade the Middle East and
                        impose a religion across the world --

                                        PURDY
                        You're talking about the Islamists
                        who mistake Jihad for a battle
                        with Christendom -- Jihad - like
                        the Apocalypse is not a battle of
                        armies, but a holy war within
                        ourselves, for our own soul.

                                        EAGER STUDENT
                        If God wants to give humanity a
                        sign, why not be clear and obvious?



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: INSTINCT - TEASER - 3/3/04 - YELLOW         3.


    3CONTINUED:3

                                        PURDY
                        He demands that we work hard to
                        understand His message, the signs
                        and wonders of the Bible, the
                        four horsemen, the lion lying
                        down with the lamb, few of us
                        will recognize these signs for
                        what they are.

          Purdy pauses becoming lost in his own revery, his students
            wondering what's going on.

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        What about the two prophets?

          Purdy turns to see JOHNNY standing way at the back of the
          lecture hall.  Purdy is surprised to see him there, and
          Johnny's presence throws him off.

                                        PURDY
                        The two prophets?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Revelation tells of two prophets
                        who will become the centers of
                        two storms... and they will speak
                        with the voice of God.

          Purdy's shaken, but tries not to show it.  

                                        PURDY
                        Yes, of course, the two prophets. 
                          Ordinary people chosen by God.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Do you think they will be
                        recognized when they come?

                                        PURDY
                        Their time is near, but the stage
                        has not been set.
                                (then as if he's
                                  speaking about himself)
                        We have much to do to prepare the
                        way for them...

          Purdy just stares at Johnny, disturbed and confused. 
          After a moment, he turns back to the class.          DEAD ZONE: INSTINCT - TEASER - 3/3/04 - YELLOW         4.


  44EXT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

          Purdy, having just collected his books and papers, hurries
          out to find Johnny leaning against the wall, waiting for
          him.

                                        PURDY
                        What was that about the two
                          prophets?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Just a question.  Actually, I
                        came on more earthly matters.

                                        PURDY
                        How can I help you?

          Johnny levels his gaze at Purdy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The strangest thing happened the
                        other day.  I got a property tax
                        bill in the mail.

                                        PURDY
                        Nothing strange about that... 
                        You own a house.

          Johnny shows Purdy a property tax statement --

                                        JOHNNY
                        But this was for a piece of land
                        out in North County.  I've never
                        even been there.  Bellevue Estates. 
                        Ever heard of it?

          Purdy is momentarily startled, then regains his composure.

                                        PURDY
                        Must be some kind of mistake.
                          Probably a forgotten piece of
                        land held by the trust your mother
                        set up for you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's what I thought.  I mean,
                        you're the trustee, you'd know if
                          somebody was buying land in my
                        name...

                                        PURDY
                        Let me take care of that.

          Purdy tries to take the statement; Johnny holds on to it.

                                to this)
                        That's okay, I'll check it out. 
                        I just thought you might know
                        what it was.

          Johnny starts to move his hand near Purdy; before he can,
          Johnny's CELL PHONE rings.  Purdy gets off lucky --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hello?  Hey, Walt... What?  Sure,
                        I'll be right there...

          Johnny lowers the phone and looks at Purdy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Looks like we'll have to continue
                        this another time.
                                (beat)
                        By the way: Don't be so sure the
                        stage hasn't been set....

          Johnny turns and walks away, leaving behind a shaken Purdy.          DEAD ZONE: INSTINCT - TEASER - 3/3/04 - YELLOW         6.


55A VISION - INT. PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT

          Johnny's driving.  The radio's playing softly in the
          background.  Johnny's humming along, looking as if he
          doesn't have a care in the world.

          Behind him, the TRUCK WINDOW is half open, DARKNESS behind
          it.  And in the darkness... a sudden FLUTTERING NOISE. 

          There's a break in Johnny's humming.  He waits, listens,
          doesn't hear anything.  He smiles and turns up the radio,
          humming again.

          FLUTTER.

          And this time, maybe a FLASH of something DARK darting
          past the back window.

          FLUTTER.  FLUTTER.  FLUTTER.

          The darkness behind Johnny seems to SWIRL, as if it has
          suddenly come alive.  Johnny whirls, looking through the
          back window, and moves to close it --

          But it's too late.  EXPLODING through the back window,
          filling the cab of the truck, swirling violently around
          Johnny, is a flock of BATS, their wings beating.  They
          swarm him like bees, their claws fastening into his shirt,
          their wings pounding his face.  His arms flail, frantic,
            uselessly trying to beat the bats away... He skids off
          the road, and on the moment of impact...

                                                                                CUT TO:

                        A thing of beauty.

          The game resumes, J.J. and the others pursuing the ball. 
          The excitement over for the moment, Johnny and Bruce sit
          down on a bench to watch.  Johnny shoves his hands in
          coat pocket, finding his forgotten tax bill.  He pulls it
          out and looks at it, momentarily lost in thought.

                                        BRUCE
                        That's it... Keep the ball moving!

          Bruce notices Johnny's distraction.

                        Said it must be some kind of

                        Only mistake is you found out

          Johnny returns his attention to the action as the players
          pursue the ball right past he and Bruce.

          Bruce notices Johnny's frantic look.  He starts looking
          around too.

                        What is it?  What...

                        Horses?

          Johnny can't make sense of what he's saying either.  He
          pulls Bruce close.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw Horses.  Here.  Some kind

          A few people look at Johnny like he's joking.  He runs to

          singles them out, charging.  Johnny pulls J.J. to the
          ground and covers him with his body.  The horse rears up,
            seemingly ready to stomp Johnny to death.


          IN SLOW MOTION

          Johnny looks up at the horse, prepared to be crushed. 
          The horse comes down, his front paws missing Johnny by
          inches.  The horse tosses his angry head back and forth,
          their eyes meeting.  It's almost as if the horse came
          here to deliver a message to Johnny.  Then...

          The horse lifts it's head and turns away, suddenly running
          off, the other horses following his lead.

  1818EXT. FARMYARD - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          A car, its driver's side door open, sits in front of the

          pulls into the yard, followed by the animal control van. 
          Walt and Johnny get out of the car and look around.  The
          farm is quiet.  Too quiet.  The only sound is the PING,
          PING, PING of the abandoned car, door open, keys inside.

          gets out of the van.  Inside the van, the sound of horses
          kicking at the walls, suddenly frantic again. 




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: INSTINCT - ACT ONE - 3/8/04 - GOLD         16.

                          Something is spooking these horses
                        again.  What do you want us to
                        do?

                        Hang on.
                                (then to Johnny)
                        What did you see?

                                        JOHNNY
                        There was a man with a shotgun...
                        trying to get to the car... he
                        was scared... didn't see what
                        of... he took a shot at
                          something...

          Johnny indicates a spot on the ground.  There's a small
          pool of BLOOD in the dirt, with a TRAIL of BLOOD DROPS
          heading off toward the house. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Let's check the house.

  2323INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

          Walt and Johnny move cautiously into the farmhouse.  They
          glance down.  There's blood spattered on the rug just
          inside the front door.


















                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: INSTINCT - ACT ONE - 3/8/04 - GOLD         17.


    23CONTINUED:23

          A trail of blood leads deeper into the house.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What do you think happened?

                                        WALT
                        I was hoping you could tell me.

          Johnny follows Walt.  They move forward, past tumbled
          furniture, and stop short as they see --


          A BODY

            a middle-aged MAN, bloody and still, on the other side of
          the couch.


          WALT

          moves quickly, bending over, checking the body.  He looks
          up at Johnny.

                                        WALT
                        Gone.  Looks like... some kind of
                        animal got him.

          Johnny bends over and cautiously touches the body.


2424A VISION - EXT. FARMYARD - DAY

          The man runs across the farmyard.  A WOMAN and LITTLE
          GIRL are frozen in fear, out in the open.  A SNARLING
          DOG, head lowered, stands between them and the car, ready
          to attack.

                                        LITTLE GIRL
                        Daddy, something's wrong with
                        Cody --

                                        MAN
                        They've all gone crazy!  Get back
                        in the house!  Run!  

          The man gets between his family and the dog--


  2525RESUME INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

          Johnny stands, looking around.





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: INSTINCT - ACT ONE - 3/8/04 - GOLD         18.

                        His wife and daughter.  They must
                        still be in the house --

          Walt runs, Johnny moving as quickly as he can behind him.


  2626INT. CELLAR - DAY

          A small, dark cellar.  No windows.  Walt creaks open the
          door, shining his flashlight down the stairs.

                                        WALT
                        County Sheriff!  Anybody down
                        here?  Hello?

          He finds a light switch and clicks it on.  At the bottom
          of the stairs, behind a stack of crates, the woman and
          the little girl from Johnny's vision are huddled.  They're
          bloodied and terrified, but alive.


  2727EXT. FARMYARD - LATER

          An ambulance stands in the yard.  The man's body has been
          covered with a sheet.  The woman is on a stretcher, being
          loaded into the ambulance.  Walt helps the little girl,
          into the back of the ambulance.  He leans over the woman,
          trying one more time to get a coherent story out of her.

                                        WALT
                        Ma'am.  The animals.  Did something
                        scare the animals?  Did they come
                        after you and your family?

          The woman just stares at him.  Walt gives up.  The doors
          close.  Johnny turns to Walt.

                                        JOHNNY
                        In the vision, he said, "they've
                        all gone crazy" -- like it was  
                        all the animals, they just went
                          berserk.

                                        WALT
                        Could you tell why?

          Johnny just shakes his head no.  They glance over to where
          the Animal Control Officer is still waiting, clearly
          freaked out.





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: INSTINCT - ACT ONE - 3/8/04 - GOLD         19.

                        saliva samples of every animal
                        here, get it to Dr. Pratt over at
                        the state health department. 
                        Tell him it's a priority.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Have you ever seen anything like
                        this?

                                (long pause)
                        Hell, no.  I've seen spooked horses
                        and rabid dogs -- but nothing
                        like this.  We even found a dead
                        fox in the hen house pecked to
                        death by chickens.

          Walt and Johnny trade a look.

                                        ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICER (CONT'D)
                        This is outside my expertise.  I
                        have no idea what would make
                        animals behave like this.

                          behaviorist.  Last I heard he was
                        doing some field work tracking
                        the local bear population.

  27A27AEXT. PURDY'S HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - DAY

          Big.  Traditional.  Gated.  Bought it from Pat Robertson.


  27B27BINT. PURDY'S HOME OFFICE - DAY

          Purdy hunches over the desk in his office, drinking
            expensive scotch, pouring over files splayed across his
          desk.  He keeps looking at the same files obsessively, as
          if somehow they'll change if he keeps going over them.


          INSERT - THE FILES

          Bellevue Estates title papers and deeds.  Environmental
          reports.  Blueprints.

                                        PURDY

          PURDY

          Sweeps the papers off the desk, sending them across the
          room.

                                        PURDY
                        Damn you Johnny Smith...

          Purdy lapses into a depressed stupor, staring into the
          glass of Scotch in front of him.  The room and Purdy,
            perfectly still...



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: INSTINCT - ACT ONE - 3/8/04 - GOLD        20A.

          EXTREME CLOSEUP ON THE GLASS OF SCOTCH

          The surface of the scotch vibrating from some unseen force.


          PURDY

          Begins to realize something is odd about the vibration,
          but is distracted by HIS DOG BARKING in the distance.

                                        PURDY
                          Caleb... stop that damn barking...

                          Caleb... come!

          More insistent barking rouses Purdy from his chair.


  2828EXT. PURDY'S BACK YARD - DAY

          Purdy emerges into his backyard.

                                        PURDY
                        Caleb!  Come!

          His call goes unanswered.  Puzzled, he steps into the
          yard and looks around. 

                                        PURDY
                        Caleb!  Here boy.  Caleb!

          A low GROWL draws Purdy deeper into the yard toward some
          shrubbery.

                                        PURDY
                          Caleb...

          Purdy looks down at something, reacting in horror to what
          he sees...


          PURDY'S POV

          On the ground in front of him, blood and tufts of black
          and white fur -- the remains of a kill.

                                        PURDY

          He hears the LOW GROWL again.

    28CONTINUED:28

          He looks around, but sees nothing, then...


          A DROP OF BLOOD

          lands on his hand.  Then another, landing on his cheek. 
          Hearing another LOW GROWL he looks UP to see...


          A COUGAR

          In the tree above him, eyes locked on Purdy, blood dripping
          from his mouth and paws.


          RESUME PURDY

          Gulp.  He realizes he's standing there looking like dinner
          and a snack.  Without taking his eyes off the Cougar,
          Purdy begins gingerly backing up, then freezes when the
          GROWLING STOPS.


          THE COUGAR

          watches, poised.


          PURDY

          Keeps backing up... back... back...


          THE COUGAR

          drops from the tree, now stalking him.


          PURDY

          Turns and runs the last ten yards.

          springs from it's crouching position, bounding toward
          Purdy.


          PURDY

          Fumbles with the door knob...


          COUGAR'S POV

          Racing across the yard toward Purdy, accelerating as it's
          predator instinct kicks in.  Time to thin the herd.  The
          VIEW CRASHES IN ON HIS VICTIM just as...


          PURDY

          Gets through the door, slamming it behind him.  He turns
          to look back out the glass paneled door -- the Cougar is
          gone.  Vanished.


  2929INT. PURDY'S HOME - CONTINUOUS

          Exhausted, Purdy slumps against the door, closing his
          eyes as he catches his breath.  Then something brushes
          against his leg, startling him --

                                        PURDY
                        Caleb!  You're alive!

          It's only his trusty Rotweiller Caleb.  Purdy reaches out
          to pet him, but the dog backs up -- growling at Purdy.

                                        PURDY
                        Caleb what is it?

          The dog just keeps staring at him, as if to say, "you
          know what it is" -- Caleb's piercing stare preys on Purdy's
          guilty mind.  Purdy takes back his outstretched hand,
          suddenly not sure he's safe with his own dog.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

  3030EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

            Establishing shot.  A large hospital, big enough to boast
            a psychiatric observation ward.


  3131INT. HOSPITAL PSYCHIATRIC WARD - DAY

          Johnny and Walt walk down a hallway behind a DOCTOR, who's
          consulting a file in her hand and talking as she goes.

                                        DOCTOR
                        He was picked up coming out of
                        the woods yesterday.  Incoherent,
                          delusional.  Suffering auditory
                          hallucinations.  Ran a drug screen,
                        came back negative.  No history
                        of mental illness.  We're not
                        sure what caused his psychotic
                          episode.  He's calmed down a little
                        since he came in.  But don't count
                        on getting much sense out of him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's he been saying?

                                        DOCTOR
                        A lot of dire predictions. 
                          Something dangerous, unnatural,
                        coming out of the darkness...

          She stops in front of a doorway and unlocks the door.

                                        DOCTOR
                        Like I said... nothing that makes
                        much sense.

          She opens the door and invites them to step inside.


  3232INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

          TED KEANE, scruffy and tense, sits on a single bed, the
          only piece of furniture in the small room.  He's mumbling
          to himself when Johnny and Walt enter.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mr. Keane?  I'm Johnny Smith, and
                        this is Sheriff Bannerman.  We'd
                        like to talk to you...

                                        KEANE
                        No time to talk, we've got to do
                          something...

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's right... but we don't know
                        what to do.  Can you tell us what
                          happened to you in the woods?

          Keane shakes his head and looks away.

                                        KEANE
                        You won't believe me.  I didn't
                        believe it myself.  Only I saw
                        it.  I saw it.  The natural order. 
                          Instinct unchanged since before
                          mankind.  All gone.

          Johnny bends closer.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (leading him)
                          Something's gone wrong with the

                                        KEANE
                          Habitats abandoned.  Migratory
                          patterns disrupted.  The way they
                        hunted.  The things they hunted.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yes?

                                        KEANE
                        The food chain.  Predator and
                        prey.  It's all wrong.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And now they're attacking people... 

                                        KEANE
                        Yes.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Did they attack you?

                                        KEANE
                        They would have.  If I let them. 
                        I have a trailer.  In the woods. 
                        My field lab.  All my notes.  Had
                        to leave it... had to run away...
                        I knew they were coming.  And
                        they're not going to stop...

          Johnny tries to get Keane to talk sensibly:

                        Why do you say they won't stop?

                                        KEANE
                        I know how the animals think.

                        What are they thinking?

                        They're thinking, it's payback

          Suddenly Keane rises.  Walt backs away, but Keane lunges
          forward and grabs Johnny's arm.  Johnny jerks backward --


3333A VISION - HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

          As Vision-Johnny watches, Keane claws at his locked room
          door, frantic.  In the distance, we hear a roaring noise
          grow louder (not the mysterious noise, but the noise of
            destruction) -- drowning out faint shouts of "Run!  It's
          coming!  It's coming!"  Then the power falters before
          going out, plunging Keane into darkness as the VISION
          ENDS.

          Walt pulls Keane away from Johnny.

                        He's right.  Whatever it is...
                        it's coming.

          Bruce drives, Johnny rides, down a two-lane road.

                        What's at this trailer?

                        Keane's field lab.  Whatever drove

                        So of course that's where we're
                        headed.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Of course.

                                        BRUCE
                        Thanks for inviting me, Johnny. 
                        I've always found sanity overrated.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No problem.

                        By the way, I went to the hall of

                        Yes.  You are indeed the proud
                        owner of Bellevue Estates.  Or at
                        least your trust is.  According

                        to take it.

          Johnny peers out the windows of the car, searching.  Bruce
          winces as a BRANCH scrapes along the car.

                          According to Keane, his trailer
                        should be around here somewhere. 
                        And... there it is.

          He points.  The trailer glimmers in the headlights.  Bruce
          stops the car.


  3939EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT

          Johnny and Bruce stand looking at the trailer.  It looks
          as if it's been through a war.  The sides are dented in,
          and the paint is scraped off as if by claws.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'd say this is the place.

          But Bruce is looking back at his car, examining it, buffing
          out some imagined scrapes with his sleeve.  As Johnny
          pushes open the trailer door, Bruce locks his car, the
          WHOOP-WHOOP sounding weird in the woods.


  4040INT. TRAILER - NIGHT

          Johnny finds and clicks on a light.  The trailer is a
          mess.  There are papers, files, books, radio equipment
          and bits of clothing scattered around.

                                        BRUCE
                        Not much of a housekeeper.

          Johnny examines a bulletin board that's almost falling
          off the wall.  Tacked to it are various Fish & Game
          documents, wildlife photos, etc. 

          Johnny flips through Keane's FIELD NOTEBOOK.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Strange.

                                        BRUCE
                        What?

          Johnny shows it to him. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Everything looks pretty normal. 
                          Methodical.  Up until about two
                        days ago.  Then his notes start
                        looking like this.


          INSERT NOTEBOOK

          Keane has carefully kept notes that eventually devolve
          into unintelligible line drawings.  On the last page is a
          darkly drawn CIRCLE, with ARROWS drawn away from it. 
          Hundreds and hundreds of arrows.  As Johnny touches it...          DEAD ZONE: INSTINCT - ACT TWO - 3/1/04 - PINK         31.

          Keane scribbles madly, grinding his pencil into the paper
          as he draws one arrow after the other.


  4242RESUME INT. TRAILER - NIGHT

          Johnny folds the book, puts it in his pocket.  Bruce
          examines a piece of EQUIPMENT, picks up a TRACKING COLLAR.

                                        BRUCE
                        So he was tracking bears?

          Johnny looks up from the notebook. 

                                        JOHNNY
                          According to this, the bears
                        shifted their territorial behavior
                          abruptly, suddenly abandoning
                        their habitats.  If I remember my
                        high school biology properly,
                        bears don't usually leave their
                          established territories.  Unless
                          something big is happening.  Like
                        a fire, or --

                        Look, why don't we just grab this
                        stuff and take it back to town
                        with us.  This place is creeping
                        me out.

          Johnny picks up the tracking collar.


4343A VISION - EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT

            A BEARCAM POV rushes towards the trailer, impossibly fast.


  4444RESUME INT. TRAILER - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny drops the collar, throws himself at the open door
          and SLAMS it... just as the trailer is HIT hard, by
            something very angry.  A bear ROARS furiously.  The trailer
          rocks. 

          There's a HOWL of rage from outside.

          BAM!  BAM!  BAM!

          The trailer SLAMS to one side, as if it's been hit by a
          train.  There's something frighteningly machinelike and
          relentless about the bear's attack... as if its normal
            instincts have been erased by its rage.

          A huge bear rocks the trailer like it was a toy, howling
          with rage.

          The trailer is SLAMMED again, almost tipping over this
          time.  Johnny grabs the counter, trying to stay upright. 
          He looks at Bruce.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think we need a bigger trailer.

                                        BRUCE
                        You're killing me.

          There's a moment of silence.  It lengthens.  Johnny and
          Bruce look at each other hopefully.

                                        BRUCE
                        Maybe it gave up.

          There's a huge THUD from the other side of the trailer. 
          And, after a moment... the sound of ripping claws, tearing
          at the trailer.


  4747EXT. TRAILER -  NIGHT

          Now on the opposite side from the door, he bear rips away
          a piece of the trailer, like he was opening a bee hive

                        It's on the other side.  I'll get
                        the car, pull up here, you be
                        ready to jump in --

                                        JOHNNY
                        You can't go out there --

                                        BRUCE
                        I'm not going to wait for it to
                        come in here.  Bastard better not
                        have messed with my ride...

          And he's out the door.


  4949EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT

          Johnny can hear the bear scramble around the side of the
          trailer.  He throws himself at the back wall, pounding on
          it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, Yogi!  Back over here!

          The bear ROARS and throws itself at the trailer, nearly
          knocking Johnny to the floor.  It swipes at the trailer,
          pulling it apart like a can opener.  But Johnny's got it
            occupied.  He hears Bruce's car screech up and THROWS
          open the door just as --


          BRUCE'S SUV

          SLAMS into the trailer.  Johnny throws open the back door
          and hurls himself inside. 

          And Bruce hits the gas, screeching away from the trailer...


          THE BEAR

          Rears up on his hind legs, howling with rage as his prey
          escapes.


  5050INT. BRUCE'S SUV - NIGHT

          Bruce drives, fast, down the road as Johnny peers out the
          windows into the darkness.

                                        BRUCE
                        What are you looking for?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Whatever happens next...

          Off Johnny's gaze --

                                                                                  CUT TO:          DEAD ZONE: INSTINCT - ACT TWO - 3/3/04 - YELLOW       34.


  5151INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - NIGHT

          It's chaos in here.  People are milling around, clearly
          upset, others sitting still as if in shock.  Johnny moves
          through the crowd, finding Walt. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Walt, what's going on?

                                        WALT
                        World's gone mad.  Pets attacking
                        their owners.  Wild animals
                          invading homes.  We even had a
                        family attacked by a deer.

                                        BRUCE
                        What the hell is going on?

                                        WALT
                        We had so many dog attacks I had
                        to start stacking their cages up
                        down in the basement.  The pound
                        is full to capacity.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What can I do to help?

                                        WALT
                        There's an emergency meeting in
                        about an hour to inform the public
                        of what's happening.  Maybe I'll
                        know more by then.

          Walt splits off, hailed by a Deputy.  Johnny hears BARKING;
          walks out into the hallway, following the sound.


  5252INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny and Bruce enter to find a dozen barking dogs in
          separate cages, ROSCOE guarding them.  They look like
          ordinary pets: retrievers, terriers, various mixed breeds.

                                        BRUCE
                        These dogs?  These fluffy cocker-
                        spaniel types?  They attacked
                        their owners?

                                        ROSCOE
                        Hard to believe, huh?
                                (quiet)
                        I had to shoot a golden retriever.

                                        BRUCE
                        Really?



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: INSTINCT - ACT TWO - 3/3/04 - YELLOW       35.


    52CONTINUED:52

                                        ROSCOE
                          Friendliest dog in the world, but
                        he was coming at me, ready to
                        kill.

          Johnny ignores Bruce and Roscoe, staying focused on the
          dogs.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's like thousands of years of
                          breeding and training have been
                          stripped away to reveal their
                        basic instincts --

            Suddenly, the barking subsides.  The dogs begin to growl,
          low in their throats.  And they all crouch in the backs
          of their cages.  It's unsettling.

          Johnny bends down to look into one cage.  A small fluffy
          DOG growls at him.  Johnny puts his hand up.  The dog,
          still growling, slowly comes forward, giving Johnny's
          hand a half-hearted sniff.  Johnny touches the dog,
          triggering --


5353A VISION - EXT. YARD - DOG'S POV - DAY

          From the dog's P.O.V. -- his jaws clamped down on his
          FRIGHTENED OWNERS ARM -- as the owner tries to shake him
          off.  The owner's screams are drowned out by THE STRANGE
          SOUND again.


  5454RESUME SCENE - INT. INTERROGATION ROOM

          Johnny winces, puts his hands to his ears.  The dog SNARLS
          and snaps at Johnny, like it knows what Johnny saw.  Off
          Johnny's reaction.


  5555EXT. COMMUNITY CENTER - NIGHT

          The Cleaves Mills Community Center as a meeting gets
          underway inside.  A letterboard reads: "EMERGENCY MEETING
          9:00 P.M."


  5656INT. COMMUNITY CENTER - NIGHT

          Walt and Reverend Purdy stand in front of the assembled
          townsfolk, trying to be heard over everyone talking.





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: INSTINCT - ACT TWO - 3/3/04 - YELLOW       36.


    56CONTINUED:56

          Johnny and Bruce stand in the back, watching.

                                        PURDY
                          Everyone, please, one at a time.

                                        SCARED WOMAN
                        What's going to happen to our
                        pets?  I heard they were going to
                        be quarantined then killed...

          Purdy looks at Walt.  He steps forward.

                                        WALT
                        Nobody is going to kill your pets. 
                        The most important thing right
                        now is that we don't panic.

                                        DOUG
                        Don't panic?  There's been dozens
                        of attacks.  Who's going to protect
                        us?

                                        PURDY
                        God will not forsake us in our
                        hour of need.

          Walt gives Purdy a quick glance -- his dire tone is not
          helping.

                                        WALT
                                (off Purdy)
                        Everything possible is being done
                        to insure public safety. 

                                        SCARED WOMAN
                        But what's happening?  Why are
                        the animals doing this?

                                        WALT
                        We're still investigating all the
                          possibilities --

          One man, STAN, rises.  Stan's a hunter. 

                                        STAN
                        I heard there was some crazy bear
                        loose in the woods.  It could
                        have spooked those horses, sent
                        them running into town --

          His friend Doug nods.

    56CONTINUED: (2)56

                                        DOUG
                        -- spread whatever disease it's
                        got to our dogs and cats --

                                        STAN
                        I say me and Doug and anybody
                        wants to come with us, should go
                        out and kill that bear.

                                        WALT
                        That's the last thing we need, 
                        more people in harm's way.

          Bruce shouts from the back.

                                        BRUCE
                        We don't know the bear is
                          responsible for anything --

                                        DOUG
                          Something is spooking all the
                          animals.  If it's not the bear,
                        then we'll find out what it is,
                        and we'll kill that!

          Stan turns to leave, Doug with him, clearly more excited
          by the prospect of going out into the woods and killing
            something than afraid of some killer bear disease.

                                        PURDY
                        Instead of killing God's creatures,
                        we should be begging for his
                          forgiveness...

          Walt tries to blow past Purdy's personal darkness.

                                        WALT
                        ...the best thing for everybody
                        is to just go home, stay off the
                          streets, and let us do our job.

          People start to file out, Johnny the only one paying
            attention to Purdy as he lowers his head in prayer.

          Walt joins Johnny and Bruce, the three of them watching
          the crowd exit, leaving Purdy behind.

                                        WALT
                                (re: Purdy)
                        What's up with him?

                                (wondering himself)
                        I don't know.

          Walt and Bruce follow the last of the people outside,
          leaving Johnny alone with Purdy -- his head still bowed
          in prayer.


          JOHNNY AND PURDY

          Johnny carefully approaches Purdy -- he's never seen him
          like this -- scared, the pretentiousness stripped away.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gene?  ...Gene?  What's going on? 
                        You okay?

                                        PURDY
                        I've been thinking about what you
                        said Johnny... about the stage
                        being set.  The two prophets.
                        Your visions, the things you've
                        seen... what if this isn't just
                        some local anomaly?  What if it's
                          something we've done... something
                        I...

          Purdy hesitates, almost seems ready to spill his guts,
          then pulls himself back from the brink.

                                        PURDY
                        Pray with me...

          Purdy unexpectedly reaches out for Johnny, grabbing his
          arm, triggering:


  5757OMITTED


5858A VISION - INT. FAITH HERITAGE CHAPEL - DAY

          Empty... except for Purdy, who kneels piously at the altar. 
          Praying.  He's praying so fervently that his words tumble
          over each other so that he's out of breath.  From
          outside... the RUMBLE that we heard before in the Keane
          vision, growing louder and louder.

                        given the kingdom, the power, and
                        the strength, and the glory..."

          The RUMBLE increases.  The chapel SHAKES. 

                                        PURDY
                        "...and wheresoever the children

          Just as whatever is coming sounds ready to breach the
          chapel walls...


  5959RESUME JOHNNY AND PURDY

          Johnny comes out of the vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're going to have to pray alone

                        What is it Johnny?  What have you
                        seen?  Tell me...

          Johnny turns and walks away, leaving behind a shaken Purdy.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

  6060INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

          Johnny's talking to Keane, who is slightly calmer.

                                        KEANE
                        It started with the smaller
                          vertebrates.
                                (beat)
                        Moles refusing to go underground,
                        birds eating their own eggs,
                        herbivores becoming carnivorous...

          Keane's getting unsettled again, just thinking about it.

                                        KEANE
                        Once I started to pay attention,
                        I saw that the insects and spiders
                        were displaying the same kind of
                          aberrant behavior.
                                (beat)
                        Then the bears started to react...

                                        JOHNNY
                        You realized that whatever was
                          affecting the animals was working
                        its way up to the larger animals.

                                        KEANE
                        Eventually it worked it's way up
                        the entire food chain until it
                        began effecting me.
                                (beat)
                          I didn't realize that until I got
                        here. 

          Johnny pulls out Keane's field notebook.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (off Keane's stare)
                        Rescued it from a friend of yours.
                                (beat)
                        I was curious about this last
                        page.










                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: INSTINCT - ACT THREE - 3/3/04 - YELLOW   41-43.


    60CONTINUED:60

          Keane takes the book, opens it to the page with all the
          arrows on it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It seems kind of specific.

          Keane nods.

                                        KEANE
                        I remember this now.  Before I
                        completely lost it, I had this
                        flash of insight -- something all
                        the animals had in common.  They
                        were abandoning their habitats.

                                        JOHNNY
                        All running away from the same
                        area?

                                        KEANE
                        Yes. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Can you show me where that is on
                        the map?

                                        KEANE
                        I can do better than that.  Get
                        me out of here and I'll take you
                        right to it. 

          Off Johnny thinking it over...

  6363EXT. WOODS - LATER - DAY

          Keane leads Johnny, Walt and Bruce deeper into the woods. 
          They aren't really following a trail, instead crashing
          through thick vegetation.

                                        WALT
                                (to Johnny)
                        You sure this guy knows where
                        he's going?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.

                                        WALT
                        I hope you're right about this,
                        Johnny.  I really don't have time
                        for this.
                                (then to Keane)
                        Hey, Keane, we've been hiking for
                        two hours, how much further?

                                        KEANE
                        Are you feeling it?

                                        BRUCE
                        Feeling what?

                                        KEANE
                                (twitchy, like before)
                        An edginess.  A sense of
                          anticipation.  Like the animal
                          instinct inside all of us is being
                          awakened by something... We're
                        getting close.

          Walt and Bruce exchange a look -- this dude is nuts. 


          JOHNNY

            Meanwhile is feeling it.  Or something... He holds his
          hands out in front of him, almost like they were antennas
          picking up a distant radio signal.  The view RAMPS INTO
          HIM, crashing tight into his ear as HE HEARS THE MYSTERIOUS*
          SOUND.

                                        JOHNNY*
                        That sound... what is that?*


          RESUME WIDER*

          Suddenly a GUNSHOT snaps Johnny out of his vision as it
          echoes through the forest from nearby.  Followed by another
          and another.  Then the BOOM of a shotgun.

                        That gunshot came from just up
                        ahead.  Watch yourselves.

          They move off, following Walt, who pulls his gun.*

          The four men run through the silent woods.  Another CRACK-
          BOOM ahead of them.  Walt switches direction, running
          towards the sound.

          The others tear off after Walt, and round a bend.

          Walt is kneeling down next to a moaning Doug.  Beside him
          hover an anxious Doug and another HUNTER.  Johnny comes
          over.  Doug has been SHOT in the leg.  Walt looks up.

                                        WALT
                        What the hell happened?

          Stan looks at him, eyes wide.

                        I shot him.  I didn't mean to...

          Bruce breaks a first aid kit out of his pack.

                                        BRUCE
                        He's okay, just a couple of pellets
                        grazed him.

                        Damn stupid fools.

                        We got separated.  Something was
                        out there... I heard it.*

                          something was there...

                        Me too.  Never heard anything*
                        like it.  I couldn't tell where*
                        it was coming from, but it was
                        big...

          Johnny and Bruce help Doug to his feet.

          Are running, terrified, looking behind them.  Stan, Doug

          he raises his gun and listens.  WE HEAR THE STRANGE OMINOUS*

                        I don't know.  But it might be
                        the common factor we're looking

          THEIR POV - THE GROUND

          A muddy trickle.  Dead fish half buried where water once
          flowed.

                        A new dam cut off the river that
                        fed all these streams.  They
                        started filling the reservoir a
                        while back.  Since then this whole
                          watershed has dried up.

          Johnny leans down and touches the trickle of water.


7070A VISION

          As Johnny's POV moves down into the murky water, rocketing
          faster and faster... snaking through the algae choked
          remnants of the river until the view suddenly shifts
          UPWARDS, breaking the surface to reveal a smooth cement
          WALL -- THE DAM. 

          VISION JOHNNY stands knee deep in a small pool at the
          base of the dam, looking up at the wall of cement in front
          of him.  Suddenly, he HEARS THE GROANING SOUND from his
          earlier visions.  This time LOUDER.  He looks for the
          animal making the strange sound -- but then a realization
          dawns on him --  it becomes clear the sound is not an
          animal, but the sound of concrete and steel being stressed
          beyond the breaking point.

          The whale-song like groan is suddenly punctuated by a
          THUNDEROUS CRACK as the damn suffers a catastrophic
          failure, the concrete wall exploding outward as millions
          of gallons of water consume Vision-Johnny in a heartbeat.

          as if he's just been crushed by a million acre-feet of

                        terrifying the animals... it's

                        failing... and it's going to flood

          He comes out of the vision, worried.

                        Gene!

          He heads off, looking for a way into the house.

          Johnny finds the backdoor open.  Remembering the couger
          story, he steps inside cautiously.  The room is a mess,
          obvious signs of a struggle of somekind.  There's blood
          on the floor.

          Johnny pushes open the door to the study revealing:

          REVEREND PURDY

          Sitting at his desk, reading his Bible, turning the page
          with his bloodied left hand, his forearm lacerated,
            bleeding.  The room is a mess, papers and files scattered;
            furniture knocked over, signs of a struggle everywhere.

                                        PURDY
                                (reading)
                          I looked, and behold, an ashen
                        horse, and he who sat on it had
                        the name death, and Hades was
                          following with him.  Authority
                        was given to them over the earth,
                        to kill with a sword and with
                        famine and with pestilence, and
                        by the wild beasts of the earth...

          Purdy raises his right hand which has been hidden under
          the desk, revealing a GUN.  He sets it on the desk in
          front of him.

                                        PURDY
                                (resigned)

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gene... What's the gun for?

          Purdy doesn't answer.  Maybe he was going to shoot himself. 
          Maybe he'll shoot Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (gently)
                        Gene... Gene... are you all right? 
                        What happened?

                                        PURDY
                        My dog... Caleb... I killed him...
                        He gave me no choice...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm sorry.

                                        PURDY
                        I loved that dog... and he loved
                        me...

          Purdy drifts away, lost in thought as he looks through
          his Bible.  Then without looking up...

                                        PURDY
                        Why are you here?

                                        JOHNNY
                        My visions... I know what's wrong
                        with the animals... It's the dam.

                                        PURDY
                        The dam?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Filling the dam is causing some
                        kind of weird vibration... the
                        animals can hear the sound of the
                        rock beneath the dam being
                          stressed... it's going to cause
                        the dam to fail.

          Purdy smiles weirdly, turns to his Bible.

                                        PURDY
                        Of course.  It's all right here...
                                (reading)
                        ...Then the lamb broke one of the
                        seven seals, and one of the four
                        living creatures said as with a
                        voice of thunder, "Come."

          Johnny sees that Purdy is losing it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gene... I need you to call the
                          governor.  There's still time to
                        release the water, drain the
                          reservoir before the dam breaks...

          Purdy just laughs.

                                        PURDY
                        Don't you see Johnny?  It's too
                        late for that.

          Purdy looks at the gun.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why don't you give me the gun,
                        Gene.  We need to call... there's
                        not much time.

                                        PURDY
                                (resigned)
                        It doesn't matter now.

          Purdy picks up the gun.  He's oddly serene.

          Like somebody at peace with his fate.  Like somebody about
          to shoot himself.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It does matter, Gene.  If the dam
                        fails a lot of people are going
                        to die...

          Johnny eases over to the desk, puts his hand out for the
          gun.  Purdy just stares at the gun.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You asked me what I've seen... If
                        my visions have shown me
                          Armageddon... I can't tell you
                          everything... because I don't
                        know everything... but I do know...
                        it doesn't end here. 

          Purdy looks up from the gun, meeting Johnny's eyes.  Johnny
          doesn't want to give any of this up, but right now he'll
          say anything to get Purdy to put down that gun and call
          the governor.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You asked me about the two
                        profits... maybe the two prophets
                        are you and I... but if you don't
                        call the governor and convince
                        him to drain the reservoir... if
                        you do what you're thinking of
                          doing... Everything you've worked
                        for... Everything thing I've
                        seen... won't matter...
                              (a beat)
                        So if you believe in me... If you
                        believe in yourself... give me
                        the gun...

          Purdy looks into Johnny's eyes for a long time, then
          reluctantly holds out the gun for Johnny to take.

                                        PURDY
                          I should have known God wouldn't
                        let me off so easily...

          Johnny takes the gun, triggering:

          Purdy looks to Johnny, wondering about what he's just

                        lawsuit to stop construction of
                        the dam...

                        Because of your influence.  Because
                        you couldn't let anything stop
                        your plans.

          Purdy collapses back into his chair, exhausted, wrung
          out.

          Water roaring out of the spillway as the reservoir is
          drained.  The VIEW WIDENS TO REVEAL:


          JOHNNY AND PURDY

          Watching the cascade of water.  Purdy is cleaned up, but
          that's not the only difference.  He's been stripped of
          his arrogance as well.

                                        PURDY
                          I started out with a tiny
                          congregation in an abandoned movie
                          theater.  But God had bigger plans
                        for me, or so I thought.  He
                          rewarded my ambitions, led me
                        here to Cleaves Mills.

                        Called on me to do great things
                        for him.  Faith Heritage was the
                        answer to that call.  But somehow,
                        maybe I was too busy building a
                          monument to him to hear his
                          warnings, let my pride get in the
                        way.  Before I knew it, everything
                        I had built was in danger of being
                        lost... I took risks... Risks
                        that God chose not to reward...

                                        JOHNNY
                        And Bellevue Estates was your
                        plan to make it all back?

                                        PURDY
                        The marina was going to be over
                        there.  The hotel there.  Hundreds
                        of homes and condos.  Thousands
                        of jobs.  Even a lakeside chapel. 
                        All of it, washed away... along
                        with millions of dollars of Faith
                        Heritage's money...
                              (a beat, then to
                                  himself)
                        Why has he done this to me...?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You asked me if I thought the
                          animal's behavior was a sign from
                        God... I'm not a believer like
                        you... but I think you got your
                        answer.

          Purdy, watches the water, lost in thought.
