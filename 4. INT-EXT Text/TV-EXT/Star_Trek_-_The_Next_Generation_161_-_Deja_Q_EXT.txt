 by a single moon, irregularly shaped.

   Captain's log, Stardate 43539.1. 
   We have moved into orbit around 
   Bre'el Four to investigate a 
   potentially catastrophic threat 
   to the population from a 
   descending asteroidal moon... 
 
 
 The tractor beam flares out of the ship and grabs onto 
 the small moon. The warp engines flare brighter as we 
 apply power. The ship is trying to "plow" the moon 
 into a higher orbit. 
 
 
 As it orbits Bre'el, maintaining its distance to the 
 moon, Klyo.

   Captain's log, supplemental. We 
   are no closer to finding a 
   solution to the deteriorating 
   orbit of the Bre'el Four moon... 
   but with the arrival of Q, we now 
   have a good idea of the cause.

   Captain's log, supplemental. We 
   have sustained light damage from 
   an attack by an alien species 
   known as the Calamarain. They 
   apparently have a grievance with 
   Q... no doubt one of many 
   lifeforms that do. 
 
 
 As in the tease, the tractor beam locks onto the moon.
