The warrior sits at a table drinking tea and gnawing on his
bamboo. The door BLASTS open. The MANCHU GANG rushes in and
surrounds him.
GANG BOSS
(to warrior)
I see you like to CHEW!
(beat)
Maybe you should chew on my FIST!!
The Boss punches the table.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
The warrior said nothing for his
mouth was full. Then, he swallowed.
He swallows.
NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And then, he spoke.
WARRIOR
(dubbed hero voice)
Enough talk. Let's FIGHT!
SHASHABOOEY!
WHAM! The warrior delivers a punch and the whole gang goes
flying.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
He was so deadly in fact that his
enemies would go blind from
overexposure to pure awesomeness.
2.
The gang members blindly flail about.
NINJA CAT
MY EYES!
GATOR
HE'S TOO AWESOME!
ONLOOKERS swoon.
SMITTEN BUNNY
And ATTRACTIVE!
GRATEFUL BUNNY
How can we repay you??
WARRIOR
There is no charge for awesomeness,
or attractiveness.
ONE HUNDRED ASSASSINS appear and surround the warrior.
CUT TO:
Po lands hard on the floor. He tries to clear his head and
wake up.
PO'S DAD (O.S.)
Po! Get up!
We see his room is filled with various kung fu posters
(including a poster featuring all of the Five) and souvenirs,
and a wooden version of the Sword of Heroes (the green
sword).
Po SIGHS.
He attempts to kick himself to his feet but alas, his belly
is too worthy a foe.
PO'S DAD (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Po! What are you doing up there?
4.
PO
Uh, nothing!
Po hops to his feet, imitating his Kung Fu action figures.
PO (CONT'D)
Monkey! Mantis! Crane! Viper!
Tigress! Rowrrrr...
OUTSIDE on the balcony of the neighboring house, a pig
watering flowers stares at Po. Po tries to play it cool and
then quickly ducks out of sight.
PO'S DAD (O.S.)
Po! Let's go! You're late for work!
PO
Coming!
He takes a ninja star from his floor and chucks it at the
wall. It bounces off.
He throws the star again, but it bounces off again. He picks
it up and heads downstairs. He trips and falls the rest of
the way.
Po falls flat on his face on the kitchen floor. A panda-
shaped shadow looms over Po.
PO
Sorry, Dad.
PO'S DAD
Sorry doesn't make the noodles.
Reveal that the shadow is actually caused by a basket being
carried by a small DUCK. This is PO'S DAD. Po gets to work,
which is not easy since the kitchen's not really made for a
panda his size.
PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
What were you doing up there? All
that noise.
PO
Oh, nothing. Just had a crazy
dream.
He gets back to work.
5.
PO'S DAD
About what?
PO
Huh?
PO'S DAD
The dream. What were you dreaming
about?
PO
What was I... eh, I was dreaming
about uh... heh...
Push in on Po -- is he going to admit his dream? He hides his
throwing star behind his back.
PO (CONT'D)
Noodles.
THOK. Dad stops chopping vegetables.
PO'S DAD
Noodles. You were really dreaming
about noodles?
PO
Uh, yeah. What else would I be
dreaming about?
Po hands a noodle bowl to a customer, then realizes his
throwing star is sitting in it.
PO (CONT'D)
(to customer)
Careful, that soup is... sharp!
PO'S DAD
Oh, happy day! My son, finally
having the noodle dream!
He throws his arms around Po.
PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
You don't know how long I have been
waiting for this moment.
When Dad pulls out of the hug, Po is now wearing a noodle
apron.
PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
This is a sign, Po!
6.
Po looks at the apron nervously -- what has he gotten himself
into?
PO
Uh...a sign of what?
PO'S DAD
You are almost ready to be
entrusted with the secret
ingredient of my "Secret Ingredient
Soup." And then you will fulfill
your destiny and take over the
restaurant, just as I took it over
from my father, who took it over
from his father, who won it from a
friend in a game of mahjong.
PO
Dad Dad Dad, it was just a dream.
PO'S DAD
No, it was the dream. We are noodle
folk. Broth runs through our veins.
PO
But Dad, didn't you ever, I dunno,
want to do something else?
Something besides noodles?
PO'S DAD
Actually...
Po looks surprised.
PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
When I was young and crazy...
Dad gets a wistful look in his eyes.
PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
I thought about running away and
learning how to make tofu.
PO
So why didn't you?!
PO'S DAD
Oh, because it was a stupid dream.
Can you imagine, me making tofu?
(laughs at the thought)
No. We all have our place in this
world. Mine is here. And yours is--
7.
PO
I know. Is here.
PO'S DAD
No, it's at tables two, five,
seven, and twelve.
He loads Po's arms with bowls of soup.
PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
Service with a smile!
A GONG sounds in the distance. Po looks out the window at the
distant JADE PALACE.
Shifu strides purposefully down the hallway, which is lined
with palace geese.
Candles, incense, and smoke fill the room. The door bursts
open, the candles flicker. Shifu enters.
SHIFU
Master Oogway? You summoned me.
He bows. Then looks up without unbowing.
SHIFU (CONT'D)
Is something wrong?
Reveal Master Oogway... a wise, old tortoise.
OOGWAY
Why must something be wrong for me
to want to see my old friend?
SHIFU
So... nothing's wrong?
OOGWAY
Well, I didn't say that.
Shifu looks up, concerned. Oogway opens his mouth... and
blows out a candle. And another candle. And another.
9.
Finally, Shifu uses his Kung Fu to blow them all out. Oogway
smiles knowingly.
SHIFU
You were saying?
OOGWAY
I have had a vision... Tai Lung
will return.
Shifu looks stricken.
Quick, impressionistic images of Shifu battling a large,
shadowy figure (Tai Lung).
Shifu is rattled. He looks at the claw marks that still scar
the wall and quickly looks away. But he regains his
composure.
SHIFU
That is impossible. He is in
prison.
OOGWAY
Nothing is impossible.
Shifu makes a split decision.
SHIFU
Zeng!
He comes flying in. Shifu gets in his face.
SHIFU (CONT'D)
Fly to Chogun Prison and tell them
to double the guards, double their
weapons. Double everything! Tai
Lung does not leave that prison!
ZENG
Yes, Master Shifu.
The goose flies off, but... SMACK! He hits a column. Then he
is off. Back on Oogway, as he walks toward camera, away from
Shifu.
10.
OOGWAY
One often meets his destiny on the
road he takes to avoid it.
SHIFU
We have to do something. We can't
just let him march on the valley,
and take his revenge! He'll, he'll--
Oogway looks into the water of the moon pool.
OOGWAY
Your mind is like this water, my
friend. When it is agitated, it
becomes difficult to see. But if
you allow it to settle, the answer
becomes clear.
Shifu and Oogway stare into the pool. Oogway settles the
water, revealing the reflection of an intricately carved
dragon clutching a SCROLL in its mouth.
SHIFU
The Dragon Scroll...
OOGWAY
It is time.
SHIFU
But who? Who is worthy to be
trusted with the secret to
limitless power? To become...the
Dragon Warrior?!
Dramatic music as we push in on Oogway's face. Then...
OOGWAY
I don't know.
Po is serving customers, but has trouble squeezing between
tables.
PO
Oop...sorry.
ANGRY PATRON
Hey! Watch it, Po!
PO
Sorry. Suck it up.
11.
He sucks his belly in, but this causes his butt to interfere
with a bunny family's meal.
DISGUSTED PATRON
Ugh!
PO
Oop! Sorry! A thousand pardons.
A couple palace geese put up a poster on the wall and a
palace pig hits a tiny gong. This gets Po's attention. He
rushes up to the poster.
PO (CONT'D)
What?! Master Oogway's choosing the
Dragon Warrior! Today!
Customers jump up excitedly.
PO (CONT'D)
Everyone! Everyone! Go! Get to the
Jade Palace!
Po urges the villagers out the restaurant.
PO (CONT'D)
One of the Five is gonna get the
Dragon Scroll!
Customers rush to finish their food.
PO (CONT'D)
We've been waiting a thousand years
for this! Just take the bowl!
Other customers are finishing their soup.
One old lady customer slowly counts out coins and puts them
on the table.
PO (CONT'D)
This is the greatest day in Kung Fu
history! Don't worry about it, just
go!
He starts to run.
PO'S DAD
Po! Where are you going?
Po stops dead in his tracks, busted.
PO
To the...Jade Palace?
12.
PO'S DAD
But you're forgetting your noodle
cart! The whole valley will be
there, and you'll sell noodles to
all of them.
PO
Selling noodles? But Dad, you know,
I was kinda thinking maybe I...
PO'S DAD
Yeah?
PO
I was kinda thinking maybe I...
PO'S DAD
Uh huh?
Po wants to say something to his dad, but he loses his nerve.
PO
...Could also sell the bean buns.
They are about to go bad.
PO'S DAD
That's my boy! I told you that
dream was a sign!
PO
Yeah, ha ha, glad I had it.
SHIFU
Citizens of the Valley of Peace! It
is my great honor to present to
you... Tigress! Viper! Crane!
Monkey! Mantis! The Furious Five!
The Five jump into the middle of the ring.
PO
The Furious Five!
Po manages a brief glimpse of the Five before a gust of wind
knocks Po to the ground and shuts the window.
SHIFU
Warriors prepare!
Po runs over to a crack in the wall.
PO
Peeky-hole!
SHIFU
Ready for battle!
Inside the arena, Po catches a glimpse of Crane as he spreads
his wings.
PO
Yeah! Woo! The Thousand Tongues of
Fire!
One of the spectators walks in front of Po, cutting off his
view.
PIG FAN
Whoa! Look at that.
PO
Hey, get out of the way!
Po backs up to get a better look at Crane in the sky and
accidentally falls down the stairs.
Po climbs back up and drops his head -- he missed it.
MONTAGE:
Po tries karate chopping the door open...to no avail. He
slumps to the ground.
16.
PO (CONT'D)
Ow...
Po attempts a pole vault, but falls on his back. The pole
whips around and hits him into the arena wall.
Po rigs a catapult, only to get clobbered by it. The crowd
CHEERS.
Po sits atop the stairs. Alone.
SHIFU
And finally...Master Tigress!
Po snaps to attention.
Po pulls on a rope tied to a tree.
SHIFU (O.S.) (CONT'D)
And believe me citizens, you have
not seen anything yet!
PO
I KNOW!!
SHIFU (O.S.)
Master Tigress! Face Iron Ox and
his Blades of Death!
Tigress sets up to deliver her move.
Po launches himself up above the fence, gets a peek at
Tigress, then falls out of view just as she does her move.
Po lands outside the arena in a fireworks tent.
Oogway senses something. He raises his hand and the crowd
hushes.
OOGWAY
I sense the Dragon Warrior is among
us.
Shifu motions for the Five to gather in the center of the
ring.
SHIFU
Citizens of the Valley of Peace!
Master Oogway will now choose...
the Dragon Warrior!
17.
Oogway closes his eyes and raises his hand as ceremonial
DRUMS start to play.
PO POV: He sees the Five looking down at him, appalled. Po
comes round slowly, getting his bearings. He looks around and
sees Oogway. Strangely, the old turtle is smiling.
PO
What's going on? Where...uh? What
are you pointing--?
He looks up. An awful realization starts to dawn. Po GULPS.
He is desperately embarrassed.
19.
PO (CONT'D)
Oh. Okay. Sorry. I just wanted to
see who the Dragon Warrior was.
He tries to shuffle his butt out of there, mumbling
apologies.
OOGWAY
How interesting.
TIGRESS
Master, are you pointing at...me?
OOGWAY
Him.
PO
Who--?
Po tries moving out of the way of Oogway's finger, but it
keeps following him.
OOGWAY
You.
PO
Me?
Oogway grabs Po's hand and holds it up for all to see.
OOGWAY
The universe has brought us the
Dragon Warrior!
QUICK CUTS:
PO
What?
FURIOUS FIVE
What??
SHIFU
What???
PO'S DAD
WHAT????
The pig bangs the gong.
The crowd goes wild! They cheer! They scream! Confetti falls!
A palanquin is carried past Shifu.
20.
SHIFU
Stop! Wait! Who told you to--?
Po stands there, utterly stunned, his mouth hanging open. He
is abruptly lifted up out of shot.
Cut to the Palace Geese straining.
Po is being lifted with great effort on the palanquin. He is
carried off. Shifu elbows his way urgently through the
thronging crowd to get to Oogway.
SHIFU (CONT'D)
Master Oogway, wait! That flabby
panda can't possibly be the answer
to... our problem. You were about
to point at Tigress. That thing
fell in front of her. That was just
an accident!
OOGWAY
There are no accidents.
Oogway smiles benignly as we hear an off-screen CRASH!
The camera adjusts to reveal the palanquin has collapsed
under Po.
Shifu looks at Oogway. Oogway just smiles.
A squad of burly pigs rushes in and hoists Po, the palanquin,
and the Geese onto their shoulders, and they head off for the
Jade Palace. Stunned, Shifu watches them go.
Behind him, the Five approach and bow.
TIGRESS
Forgive us, Master. We have failed
you.
Shifu spins around.
SHIFU
No. If the panda has not quit by
morning, then I will have failed
you.
Confetti flutters through the air as the celebration
continues around them.
CUT TO:
21.
COMMANDER
What?!?!
(reading)
"Double the guard?! Extra
precautions?! Your prison may not
be adequate!"
The Goose is quaking in fear. Stern Rhinos surround him,
staring daggers at him. The Commander snaps the scroll shut.
COMMANDER (CONT'D)
You doubt my prison's security?
ZENG
Absolutely not.
(then)
Shifu does. I'm just the messenger.
COMMANDER
I'll give you a message for your
Master Shifu.
ON A BRIDGE
COMMANDER
Escape from Chogun Prison is
impossible!
The Goose is awed by the cavernous prison.
22.
ZENG
Whoa.
The goose looks over the bridge's edge. The prison goes down
a long ways. The commander hits the goose on the back.
COMMANDER
Impressive, isn't it?
A feather from the goose drifts down the prison.
ZENG
Yes, very impressive. It's VERY
impressive.
COMMANDER
One way in, one way out, one
thousand guards, and one prisoner.
ZENG
Yes, except that prisoner is Tai
Lung...
AT THE ELEVATOR
COMMANDER
Take us down.
Several guard rhinos winch the goose and the commander down.
The commander grabs the chain and shakes the elevator, trying
to scare the goose.
ZENG
What are you doing?!
The commander just laughs. The elevator finally lands,
sending an echo throughout the prison.
AT DOORS -
A number of doors unlock, one after the other. Finally, a
drawbridge is lowered out onto an island.
ZENG (CONT'D)
Oh my...
COMMANDER
Behold, Tai Lung.
ZENG
I'll um...I'm just gonna wait right
here.
23.
COMMANDER
It's nothing to worry about. It's
perfectly safe.
He shoves the goose out ahead of him.
ZENG
Oof!
COMMANDER
Crossbows! At the ready!
ZENG
Crossbows?!
They approach TAI LUNG, a giant, muscular snow leopard bound
in a giant piece of tortoise shell armor and chains. He
barely registers signs of life. The commander walks right up
to him.
COMMANDER
Hey, tough guy, did you hear?
Oogway's finally gonna give someone
the Dragon Scroll and it's not
gonna be you!
The goose can't believe it.
ZENG
What are you doing?! Don't get him
mad.
COMMANDER
What's he gonna do about it? I've
got him completely immobilized.
The Commander stomps on Tai Lung's tail. We hear a crunch.
The goose flinches. But Tai Lung does not react.
COMMANDER (CONT'D)
Awww. Did I step on the witty
kitty's tail? Awww.
Tai Lung doesn't move. His eyes stare coldly straight ahead.
ZENG
I'm good. I've seen enough. I'm
gonna tell Shifu he's got nothing
to worry about.
COMMANDER
No, he doesn't.
24.
ZENG
Okay, I'll tell him that. Can we
please go now?
The Commander starts to walk back to the elevator. The goose
hurries after him.
The goose's feather flutters into frame. We follow the
feather as it lands right in front of Tai Lung.
HIS EYES OPEN. Tai Lung grabs the feather with his tail.
The palace doors open to reveal Po on the palanquin, hundreds
of villagers behind him.
CROWD
(chanting)
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!
Po is ushered in and the doors close. He is alone. He runs
back to the closed palace doors.
PO
Wait a second! Hello? Uh...I think
there's been a slight mistake.
Everyone seems to think that I'm,
uh...
Po finally realizes where he is.
PO (CONT'D)
Whoa. The Sacred Hall of Warriors.
No way! Would you look at this
place!
He rushes up to a display of armor.
PO (CONT'D)
(GASP)
Master Flying Rhino's Armor! With
authentic battle damage!
He rushes up to a green sword, making sure not to touch it.
PO (CONT'D)
(GASP)
The Sword of Heroes! Said to be so
sharp you can cut yourself just by
looking-- OW!
He stares at a black sopt on the wall.
25.
PO (CONT'D)
(GASP)
The Invisible Trident of Destiny!?
He admires a painting.
PO (CONT'D)
(GASP)
I've only seen paintings of that
painting...
Po runs around the room, amazed by all the ancient kung fu
artifacts. Something special catches Po's eye.
PO (CONT'D)
(loudly)
Nooo! Ohhhh!
He runs over to it.
PO (CONT'D)
The legendary Urn of Whispering
Warriors! Said to contain the souls
of the entire Tenshu army.
(calling into vase)
Hellooo?
SHIFU
Have you finished sight-seeing?
Po GASPS.
PO
(to vase)
Sorry. I should've come to see you
first.
SHIFU
My patience is wearing thin.
PO
(to vase)
Oh. Well, I mean, it's not like you
were going anywhere.
SHIFU
Would you turn around?
PO
Sure.
Po turns and sees Shifu.
26.
PO (CONT'D)
Hey, how's it going?
Po turns back to the vase.
PO (CONT'D)
(to vase)
Now how do you get five thousand--
(cutting himself off)
Master Shifu!
Po bumps the vase which falls and BREAKS.
PO (CONT'D)
Someone...broke that. But I'm gonna
fix it. Do you have some glue?
The vase debris screams as Po tries to pick up the pieces.
PO (CONT'D)
Ow! Ooh. Splinter.
Po fumbles around. Shifu looks irked.
SHIFU
So you're the legendary Dragon
Warrior. Hmmm?
PO
Uh...I guess so?
Shifu smiles and shakes his head.
SHIFU
Wrong! You are not the Dragon
Warrior. You will never be the
Dragon Warrior until you have
learned the secret of the Dragon
Scroll.
He points to a dragon on the ceiling with a single scroll in
its mouth.
PO
(in awe)
Whoa.
(then)
So how does this work? You have a
ladder or trampoline or...?
SHIFU
You think it's that easy? That I am
just going to hand you the secret
to limitless power?
27.
PO
No, I...
SHIFU
One must first master the highest
level of kung fu. And that is
clearly impossible if that one is
someone like you.
PO
Someone like me?
Shifu walks around Po - pointing out his weaknesses.
SHIFU
Yes. Look at you...this fat butt.
Shifu HITS Po on the butt with his staff.
SHIFU (CONT'D)
Flabby arms...
PO
Those are sensitive in the flabby
parts.
Shifu SWATS Po on the arm with his staff.
SHIFU
And this ridiculous belly.
Shifu HITS Po in the belly with his staff.
PO
Hey...
SHIFU
--and utter disregard for personal
hygiene.
PO
(pointing at Shifu)
Now wait a minute. That's a little
uncalled-for.
SHIFU
Don't stand that close...I can
smell your breath.
PO
Listen...Oogway said that I was the-
Shifu pinches Po's outstretched digit.
28.
PO (CONT'D)
(gasp)
The Wuxi Finger Hold?! Not the Wuxi
Finger Hold!
SHIFU
(sly)
Oh, you know this hold?
PO
DevelopedbyMasterWuxiInTheThirdDyna
sty-- YES.
SHIFU
Oh, then you must know what happens
when I flex my pinky.
Po nervously eyes his finger locked in Shifu's grip and nods
quickly.
PO
No no no!
SHIFU
You know the hardest part of this?
The hardest part is cleaning up
afterwards...
PO
Okay! Okay! Take it easy...
SHIFU
Now listen closely, panda. Oogway
may have picked you, but when I'm
through with you, I promise you,
you're going to wish he hadn't. Are
we clear?
PO
Yeah, we're clear. We're clear. We
are so clear.
SHIFU
Good. I can't wait to get started.
The doors open, revealing Po nursing his wounded finger.
Shifu steps out of the way and Po's face goes into shock. The
Five are performing death-defying kung fu moves in the
training hall. Tigress smashes a swinging, spiked ball of
wood. ANGLE ON AN AWESTRUCK PO, as shards of wood blast into
his face. Po is intimidated and overwhelmed.
29.
Shifu scowls at Po.
SHIFU
Let's begin.
He gestures to the gauntlet. Po's eyes go wide.
PO
Wait wait wait...What? Now?
SHIFU
Yes...now. Unless you think the
great Oogway was wrong, and you are
not the Dragon Warrior.
PO
Oh, okay. Well-- I don't know if I
can do all of those moves.
Shifu walks away and Po half-heartedly follows.
SHIFU
Well, if we don't try, we'll never
know will we?
PO
Uh, yeah. It's just, maybe we can
find something more suited to my
level.
SHIFU
And what level is that?
PO
Well, ya know...I'm not a master,
but uh, let's just start at zero,
level zero.
SHIFU
There is no such thing as level
zero.
PO
Hey! Maybe I can start with that.
Po points at a rather friendly-looking dummy.
SHIFU
That? We use that for training
children. And for propping the door
open when it's hot. But if you
insist...
Relieved, Po turns to the dummy. The Five gather around him.
30.
PO
Whoa. The Furious Five. You're so
much bigger than your action
figures -- except for you, Mantis.
You're about the same.
Mantis gives him a look.
SHIFU
Go ahead, panda. Show us what you
can do.
PO
Um, are they gonna watch? Or should
I just wait until they get back to
work or something...
SHIFU
Hit it.
PO
Ok. I mean, I just ate. So I'm
still digesting... So my kung fu
might not be as good as later on.
SHIFU
Just hit it.
Po psyches himself up, doing some Jack Fu.
PO
Alright. Whatcha got? You got
nothing cause I got it right here.
You picking on my friends? Get
ready to feel the thunder. I'm
comin' at him with the crazy feet.
Whatcha gonna do about my crazy
feet? I'm a blur. I'm a blur. You
never seen bear style, you only
seen praying Mantis! OR... I could
come at you Monkey style. OR... I'm
comin' at ya snikity-snake.
Shifu and the Five stare at Po, perplexed.
SHIFU
Would you hit it!
PO
Alright...alright.
Po lightly hits the dummy and it rocks back into place.
31.
SHIFU
Why don't you try again?
A little
harder...
Po punches it again, knocking it all the way backwards. He
turns to Shifu, smug.
PO
How's tha--
WHAP! The dummy rights itself and smacks Po. Totally dazed,
Po trips and stumbles his way through the obstacle course.
The Five instinctively step forward to help Po, but Shifu
holds up his hand to stop them.
BACK ON PO
PO (CONT'D)
Ow, that hurts.
A spiky tethered ball sends Po flying into the jade turtle
exercise, where it rattles him around.
SHIFU
(to the Five)
This'll be easier than I thought.
Back to Po in the turtle bowl.
PO
Feeling a little nauseous.
The turtle spills him out and he stumbles into the army of
wooden dummies.
PO (CONT'D)
Ow, those are hard! Ooh! I think
I...
The last dummy whaps him in the crotch and everything becomes
still.
PO (CONT'D)
Oooohoohoo...my tenders.
He struggles to get on his feet, takes one step and reaches
out to a dummy arm...and immediately gets pummeled all over
again. Po comes out the other side battered and bruised and
finds he is standing on the floor that shoots out bursts of
flame. We see reflections of fire on the Five and Shifu as Po
gets singed. He comes crawling into frame.
32.
PO (CONT'D)
How did I do?
SHIFU
There is now a level zero.
CUT TO:
Po peeks around the corner.
PO
Okay.
He tip-toes into the hall.
SQUEAK. The floorboards strain beneath him. SQUEAK.
PO (CONT'D)
(whispering)
Great.
Po takes a gentle step. CRE-E-E-A-AA--CHUNK! Po's foot goes
through the floor. Po tries to recover. SQUEAK-SQUEAK-SQUEAK!
THUNK! Po rolls his ankle and stumbles through a bedroom
door.
Crane is staring back at him.
PO (CONT'D)
Oh hey...hi. You're up.
CRANE
Am now.
PO
I was just uh... Some day huh?
That kung fu stuff is hard work,
right? Your biceps sore?
Crane looks at his wing.
CRANE
Um...I've had a long and rather
disappointing day, so uh...yeah, I
should probably get to sleep now.
PO
Yeah yeah yeah, of course.
CRANE
(relieved)
Okay, thanks.
PO
It's just...I'm such a big fan.
34.
CRANE
Oop.
PO
You guys were totally amazing at
the Battle of Weeping River.
Outnumbered a thousand to one, but
you didn't stop, and then you
just... HI-YAH!
Po does a spastic series of Kung Fu moves. We hear a RIP, and
reveal that he's kicked his foot through the paper wall.
PO (CONT'D)
Ooo, sorry about that.
CRANE
Look, you don't belong here.
Po looks stung to be hearing this from one of his heroes.
PO
I know. I know. You're right. I
just - my whole life I've dreamed
of-
Crane stops Po before he embarrasses himself even more.
CRANE
No no no... I meant you don't
belong here. I mean, in this room.
This is my room. Property of Crane.
Po is mortified, but covers.
PO
Oh, okay. Right right. Yeah, you
want to get to sleep.
CRANE
Yeah.
PO
I'm keepin' you up. We got big
things tomorrow. Alright. You're
awesome. Last thing I'm gonna say.
Okay. Bye bye.
Po shuts the door. Crane sighs. The door flies open. Po
enters with an eager smile.
PO (CONT'D)
What was that?
35.
CRANE
I didn't say anything.
PO
Okay. Alright. Goodnight. Sleep
well.
Po backs out into the hall and closes the door.
PO (CONT'D)
Seemed a little bit awkward.
Po turns and walks down the hall to find a vacant room. CREAK-
CREAK.
Tigress opens the door behind him. Po winces.
PO (CONT'D)
Master Tigress! Didn't mean to wake
you. Just uh...
TIGRESS
You don't belong here.
PO
Uh, yeah, yeah. Of course. This is
your room.
TIGRESS
I mean...you don't belong in the
Jade Palace. You're a disgrace to
Kung Fu, and if you have any
respect for who we are and what we
do, you will be gone by morning.
She closes the door on Po, who slumps sadly.
PO
Big fan...
Using the goose's feather to pick the lock, Tai Lung BURSTS
free from his armor.
An ALARM RINGS OUT!
The Commander runs to the ledge, the Goose right behind him.
ZENG
What's happening?!
The Goose looks over the edge and sees Tai Lung at the bottom
of the pit.
Tai Lung struggles with his shackles.
COMMANDER
Fire Crossbows!
Tai Lung uses the incoming spears to break his shackles and
then manages to kick the spears back up into the walls,
creating a makeshift staircase.
ZENG
Tai Lung is free! I must warn
Shifu!
The Commander shuts the Goose up.
COMMANDER
You're not going anywhere. And
neither is he.
ZENG
Let go of me!
COMMANDER
(to guards)
Bring it up!
38.
The winch turns and the elevator starts to rise. A rhino
guard tries to reach it, but just misses.
RHINO GUARD #1
Wait! Bring it back!
ZENG
He's coming this way!
COMMANDER
He won't get far.
(to guards)
Archers!
Leaping across the spears, Tai Lung catches the elevator as
the volley of arrows flies down past him.
The guards cut the rope and the elevator crashes back down to
the bottom of the pit.
Tai Lung swings up from the bottom of the elevator house and
catches the guards by surprise. He grabs the chain and jumps
over the edge and swings around, launching himself up to the
next tier, disappearing into the shadows.
Tai Lung lands on a bridge, fights his way through, finally
reaching the top tier where the Commander and the rest of the
Rhino army await.
ZENG
We're dead. So very, very dead.
The Commander hushes the Goose.
COMMANDER
(to Goose)
Heh heh...not yet we're not! Now!
Archers set off charges on the ceiling. Massive stalactites
crash down and the bridge begins to crumble. Tai Lung leaps
across the crumbling debris and attempts one last huge jump
towards the Commander. But he falls short, claws scraping and
sparking against the rock wall. The Commander laughs
maniacally.
On his way down, Tai Lung looks up and sees a fuse burning
down to the last group of explosives. He leaps across the
raining debris up to the ceiling of the cavern.
Grabbing a hold of the dynamite, Tai Lung falls and slings it
ahead of him at the guards.
ZENG
Can we run now?
39.
COMMANDER
Yes.
Shifu enters the hallway of the bunkhouse. The Five burst out
of their rooms and land, ready for inspection.
FURIOUS FIVE
Good morning master!
One door remains closed.
40.
SHIFU
Panda! Panda, wake up!
He slides open Po's door. The room is empty.
SHIFU (CONT'D)
(satisfied)
Hmm. He's quit.
Shifu enters the training hall, only to find himself face-to-
face with Po's butt. Shifu and the Five are taken aback.
SHIFU
What are you doing here?!
Reveal Po is in the middle of the floor, his legs spread wide
apart. Po looks back over his shoulder to see Shifu and the
Five enter the hall.
PO
Hey! Huh... Good morning, Master! I
thought I'd warm up a little.
SHIFU
You're stuck.
PO
Stuck?! Whaa? Pfft... stuck...
Yeah, I'm stuck.
SHIFU
(to Crane)
Help him.
Crane approaches Po.
41.
CRANE
Oh dear.
Crane gingerly grabs Po's waistband and attempts to pull him
up by flapping his wings.
PO
Maybe on three. One. Two-
Crane pulls him up and Po flops onto his back.
PO (CONT'D)
Threeeee. Thank you.
CRANE
Don't mention it.
PO
No really, I appreci--
CRANE
--EVER.
SHIFU
You actually thought you could
learn to do a full split in one
night? It takes years to develop
one's flexibility and years longer
to apply it in combat.
Shifu flings two boards into the air. Instantly, Tigress
leaps up and executes a perfect split kick. Po is awestruck.
As Tigress lands, the broken chunks of board land all around
Po, knocking him on the head.
Po collects a piece of splintered board as a souvenir. Shifu
notices and steps forward.
SHIFU (CONT'D)
Put that down! The only souvenirs
we collect here are bloody knuckles
and broken bones.
PO
Yeah, excellent!
He laughs excitedly and salutes Shifu.
SHIFU
Let's get started.
CUT TO:
42.
MONTAGE
Shifu snaps his fingers. Viper and Po face off.
VIPER
Are you ready?
PO
I was born ready--
Viper lashes her tail around Po's wrist, wrenches his arm
back, flings him into the air and brings him crashing back
down on his head.
PO (CONT'D)
Eaghhh...
VIPER
I'm sorry, brother! I thought you
said you were ready!
PO
That was awesome! Let's go again.
(salutes)
Shifu snaps.
Monkey twirls a bamboo staff. He lunges at Po who takes a
comical beating.
Shifu snaps.
Po and Crane prepare to spar atop the turtle bowl. CRASH. Po
falls in and is tossed around like a sack of soup.
Shifu snaps.
We see a series of shots of Po falling on his face at the
hands of some invisible opponent, who turns out to be...
Mantis.
Shifu smiles. Flat on his back, Po manages a salute. Shifu
has had it.
SHIFU
I've been taking it easy on you,
panda, but no more! Your next
opponent... will be me.
Po looks excited.
PO
Alright! Let's go!
43.
The Five exchange worried looks.
SHIFU
(to Po)
Step forth.
Po doesn't even finish the step as Shifu whirls him around
and throws him to the floor pinning his arm behind him.
SHIFU (CONT'D)
The true path to victory is to find
your opponent's weakness and make
him suffer for it.
PO
(delighted)
Oh, yeah!
Shifu whips Po around again.
SHIFU
To take his strength and use it
against him.
Again, this time Shifu holds Po by the nose.
SHIFU (CONT'D)
--until he finally falls, or quits.
Po is totally inspired.
PO
But a real warrior never quits.
Don't worry, Master, I will never
quit!
At his breaking point, Shifu flings Po into the air and then
leaps at him with a flying kick.
CUT TO:
Close on Po, who grimaces.
PO (O.S.)
Aaaoo...whoohoo...EEEee...hee-
hee... I thought you said
acupuncture would make me feel
better.
Mantis pops up from behind Po holding a handful of needles
and sticks Po again.
MANTIS
Trust me, it will. It's just not
easy finding the right nerve points
under all this--
PO
Fat?
MANTIS
Fur, I was gonna say fur.
PO
Sure you were.
MANTIS
Who am I to judge a warrior based
on his size? I mean -- look at me.
Po looks for Mantis...
MANTIS (O.C.) (CONT'D)
I'm over here.
...But Mantis is now on his other shoulder. He jabs another
needle into Po.
PO
Ow!
45.
VIPER
Maybe you should take a look at
this again.
Viper is holding a diagram of acupuncture meridians (onto
which someone has overlaid a drawing of a panda.)
MANTIS
(re: diagram)
Oh! Okay.
Quick cuts to Monkey meditating in his room and Crane doing
calligraphy in his. Po's yelps distract them.
PO
Ow! Don't...
(laughing)
Stop it, stop-- Yow! I know Master
Shifu's trying to inspire me and
all, but if I didn't know any
better, I'd say he was trying to
get rid of me.
Po chuckles. The others look at each other and chuckle
awkwardly.
MANTIS
I know he can seem kind of
heartless--
He violently jabs another needle in Po.
MANTIS (CONT'D)
But, ya know, he wasn't always like
that.
VIPER
According to legend, there was once
a time when Master Shifu actually
used to smile.
PO
No.
MANTIS
Yes.
Cut to Tigress out in the hallway. She can hear them talking.
VIPER
But that was before...
PO
Before what?
46.
Tigress enters.
TIGRESS
Before Tai Lung.
Crane's shadow is silhouetted on the wall.
CRANE
Uh yeah, we're not really supposed
to talk about him.
TIGRESS
Well, if he's going to stay here,
he should know.
PO
(trying to ease the
tension)
Guys, guys. I know about Tai Lung.
Tigress turns to Po.
PO (CONT'D)
He was a student, the first ever to
master the thousand...
Tigress approaches Po and leans in towards him.
PO (CONT'D)
(nervously trailing off)
...scrolls of... kung fu... and...
then he turned bad... and now he's
in jail.
Tigress shakes her head at the panda's ignorance.
TIGRESS
He wasn't just a student.
DISSOLVE TO:
Everyone is quiet in the moment.
TIGRESS
And now he has a chance to make
things right, to train the true
Dragon Warrior. And he's stuck with
you: a big, fat panda who treats it
like a joke.
Po makes a googly-eyed face.
PO
Doieeeee...
TIGRESS
(charging at Po)
Oh! That is it!
Mantis pops up and halts Tigress.
MANTIS
Wait! My fault! I accidentally
tweaked his facial nerve.
Po falls face first to the floor, revealing his back is
covered with needles.
MANTIS (CONT'D)
And may have also stopped his
heart.
Shifu is sitting in meditation, fidgeting incessantly.
SHIFU
Inner peace. Inner peace. Inner
peace.
He finally opens one eye.
SHIFU (CONT'D)
Would whoever is making that
flapping sound, quiet down!
49.
Satisfied with the silence, Shifu nods and resumes his
meditation.
SHIFU (CONT'D)
Inner...
BOOM. Zeng drops in from the ceiling.
SHIFU (CONT'D)
Oh, Zeng. Excellent. I could use
some good news right now.
ZENG
Uh...
CUT TO:
Reveal Po is cooking for the Five.
He chops some veggies mid-
air.
PO
...but you're a lousy tipper.
CRANE
(incredulous)
Really? So... how'd you get out of
there alive?
PO
I mean, I didn't actually say that,
but I thought it... in my mind.
Po flips some bowls and expertly lines them up on his arm. He
ladles soup into them.
PO (CONT'D)
(covering)
If he... could read my mind, he'd
have been like, "What?"
(then)
Order up!
Po looks around expectantly and the Five (minus Tigress) dig
in.
PO (CONT'D)
Hope you like it.
MANTIS
This is really good.
PO
(bashful)
No, c'mon.
(MORE)
53.
PO (CONT'D)
You should try my dad's secret
ingredient soup. He actually knows
the secret ingredient.
VIPER
What are you talking about? This is
amazing.
CRANE
Wow, you're a really good cook.
MANTIS
I wish my mouth was bigger.
The others laugh. But not Tigress.
MONKEY
Tigress, you gotta try this.
Tigress looks up from her meal.
TIGRESS
It is said that the Dragon Warrior
can survive for months at a time on
nothing but the dew of a single
gingko leaf and the energy of the
universe.
On the others for a beat. Then Po shrugs.
PO
I guess my body doesn't know it's
the Dragon Warrior yet. I'm gonna
need a lot more than dew. And, uh,
universe juice.
Po laughs. He picks up his bowl and takes a giant gulp. When
he lowers the bowl, we see a noodle hanging from his face --
it looks like a moustache. Mantis snickers.
PO (CONT'D)
What?
MANTIS
Oh, nothing... Master Shifu!
The rest start laughing. Po realizes he's wearing a noodle
moustache. He plays it up.
54.
PO
(imitating Shifu)
You will never be the Dragon
Warrior, unless you lose five
hundred pounds and brush your
teeth!
The Five LAUGH.
PO (CONT'D)
(imitating Shifu)
What is that noise you're making?
Laughter? I never heard of it!
The Five keep LAUGHING. Po reaches over and grabs two empty
bowls and holds them up like ears.
PO (CONT'D)
(imitating Shifu)
Work hard, Panda. And maybe,
someday... you will have ears like
mine.
As the rest of the Five laugh, Tigress sneaks a moment to
smell Po's soup. Leaning towards the bowl, she suddenly looks
up and stops. The Five also look up and stop laughing.
Reveal Shifu has entered behind Po. He is holding Oogway's
staff.
PO (CONT'D)
(normal)
Ears. It's not working for you? I
thought they were pretty good.
Po looks at the stone-faced Five. Tigress jumps to her feet.
MONKEY
It's Shifu.
PO
Of course it's Shifu. What do you
think I'm doing?
He finally notices Shifu standing there, doing a slow burn.
Embarrassed, he places the soup bowls on his chest like a
bra.
PO (CONT'D)
Ooh! Master Shifu!
Po slurps up the noodle moustache. Monkey can't help but
snicker.
55.
SHIFU
You think this is funny? Tai Lung
has escaped from prison and you're
acting like children!
PO
What?
SHIFU
He is coming for the Dragon Scroll,
and you are the only one who can
stop him.
The bowls fall off. A beat as this sinks in... then Po starts
to laugh.
PO
And here I am saying you got no
sense of humor. I'm gonna stop
Tai...
Shifu just stares at him, deadly serious.
PO (CONT'D)
What? You're serious? And I have to--
uh, Master Oogway will stop him! He
did it before, he'll do it again.
SHIFU
Oogway cannot, not anymore.
They notice Shifu holding Oogway's staff. They know what this
means. They are saddened by the news.
SHIFU (CONT'D)
Our only hope is the Dragon
Warrior.
TIGRESS
The panda?
SHIFU
Yes, the panda!
TIGRESS
Master, please. Let us stop Tai
Lung. This is what you've trained
us for.
SHIFU
No! It is not your destiny to
defeat Tai Lung. It is his.
He dramatically points at Po... but Po is gone.
56.
SHIFU (CONT'D)
Where'd he go?
Shifu throws up his hands in frustration and heads after Po.
CUT TO:
Shifu looks inside -- it's empty. The NOISES continue from
somewhere else -- the bunkhouse.
CUT TO:
59.
As Shifu turns the corner he sees Po's shadow as he performs
some amazing Kung Fu.
Entering the kitchen, Shifu finds Po is stuffing his face
with food. Seeing Shifu, he stops mid-munch.
In silence they eye each other. Shifu surveys the room --
broken lock, smashed doors, unhinged cabinets. Po belches.
PO
(mouth full)
What? I eat when I'm upset, okay?
Shifu gets a glimmer in his eye. He has an idea.
SHIFU
Oh, no need to explain. I just
thought you might be Monkey -- he
hides his almond cookies on the top
shelf.
Shifu calmly exits and hides just outside the doorway,
waiting to see if his hunch is correct.
KLUMP! KLONK! THUNK! Shifu peeks back inside and finds Po
perched atop the high shelves jamming more cookies into his
mouth. Po notices Shifu walking back in.
PO
(mouth full)
Don't tell Monkey.
He glances back down at Shifu, whose disbelief turns to a
wise smile.
SHIFU
Look at you.
PO
Yeah, I know. I disgust you.
SHIFU
No no, I mean... how did you get up
there?
PO
I don't know. I guess I-- I don't
know. I was getting a cookie...
He looks at the cookie and then can't help but eat it.
60.
SHIFU
And yet you are ten feet off the
ground and have done a perfect
split.
PO
No, this... this is just an
accident.
He and Po stare at each other for a beat. Then... WHOOMP! Po
slips and crashes to the kitchen floor. A cookie rolls over
to Shifu. He picks it up.
SHIFU
There are no accidents. Come with
me.
CLOSE-UP of the Dragon Scroll. Po stares at Shifu - then
looks up at the Scroll. Then back at Shifu -
PO
You really believe I'm ready?
SHIFU
You are, Po.
They look at each other. This is a big moment.
Oogway's staff hangs in a rack surrounded by candles. As Po
and The Five stand by, Shifu carries the staff over to the
reflecting pool. Shifu bows his head, then, eyes still
closed, he raises the staff up above his head. Po and the
others watch, expectantly. The peach blossom petals rise in a
flickering, spinning cloud up from the pool. The gentle
tornado rises up around the ceiling carving that holds the
Dragon Scroll. The petals loosen the scroll from the dragon's
mouth and it falls. At the last second, Shifu reaches out
with the staff to catch the scroll on the end of it. He turns
to Po, holding it out.
SHIFU (CONT'D)
Behold. The Dragon Scroll... It is
yours.
PO
Wait, what happens when I read it?
SHIFU
No one knows, but legend says you
will be able to hear a butterfly's
wing-beat.
PO
Whoa! Really? That's cool.
SHIFU
Yes. And see light in the deepest
cave. You will feel the universe in
motion around you.
PO
Wow! Can I punch through walls?
Can I do a quadruple back flip?
Will I have invisibility--
SHIFU
Focus. Focus.
69.
PO
Huh? Oh, yeah... yeah.
SHIFU
Read it, Po, and fulfill your
destiny. Read it and become... the
Dragon Warrior!
PO
Whooaa!!!
Po takes a deep breath. Then he grasps the tube and tries to
pull the top off it. It doesn't budge. He strains at it.
PO (CONT'D)
It's impossible to open.
He strains again. He tries to bite it off...
PO (CONT'D)
Come on baby. Come on now...
Shifu SIGHS and holds out his hand. Po passes him the tube.
Shifu pops the end off effortlessly and passes it back to Po.
PO (CONT'D)
Thank you. I probably loosened it
up for you though... Okay, here
goes.
He glances at the Five. They look on in awe. Monkey gives him
the `thumbs up.' Po starts to unroll the scroll, the golden
light bathing his face. Across the scroll we see Shifu,
excited that he is witness to history...
On Po's face as he finishes opening the scroll.
Then -
PO (CONT'D)
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Shifu looks concerned. The Five look concerned. Po looks
utterly terrified.
PO (CONT'D)
It's blank!
SHIFU
What?
PO
Here! Look!
70.
Po tries to show Shifu the scroll. Shifu covers his eyes and
turns his head away.
SHIFU
No! I am forbidden to look upon--
But he can't help himself. He takes a peek. Then he GRABS if
off Po. He turns it around, then upside down. He closes it
and opens it again, astonished.
SHIFU (CONT'D)
Blank? I don't...I don't
understand.
Shifu turns away, contemplative. What can this mean?
PO
Okay. So like, Oogway was just a
crazy old turtle after all?
SHIFU
No. Oogway was wiser than us all.
Po sits heavily on the floor, dejected.
PO
Oh, come on! Face it. He picked me
by accident. Of course I'm not the
Dragon Warrior. Who am I kidding?
The Five don't argue.
TIGRESS
But who will stop Tai Lung?
CRANE
He'll destroy everything...and
everyone.
Shifu puts the scroll back in its container and seals it. He
looks oddly calm as he turns around.
SHIFU
No, evacuate the Valley. You must
protect the villagers from Tai
Lung's rage.
TIGRESS
What about you master?
SHIFU
I will fight him.
71.
PO
What?
SHIFU
I can hold him off long enough for
everyone to escape.
PO
But Shifu, he'll kill you.
SHIFU
Then I will finally have paid for
my mistake.
The Five and Po look devastated.
SHIFU (CONT'D)
Listen to me, all of you. It is
time for you to continue your
journey without me. I am very proud
to have been your master.
Shifu salutes them and turns away. Po is heartbroken. Crane
steps forward and kindly puts a wing around Po, pulling away.
Po resists for a moment, then lets the Five lead him off.
CUT TO:
Po arrives breathless at the Jade Palace. Shifu is still
lying in the scroll room, his eyes closed. Po rushes to his
side.
PO
Master! Shifu! Shifu! Are you okay?
Shifu weakly opens his eyes.
SHIFU
Po! You're alive!
(then, darkly)
Or we're both dead.
PO
No, Master, I didn't die. I
defeated Tai Lung!
SHIFU
You did?!
Shifu smiles and shakes his head in disbelief.
SHIFU (CONT'D)
Wow. It is as Oogway foretold --
You are the Dragon Warrior. You
have brought peace to this Valley.
And to me. Thank you. Thank you,
Po. Thank you...
Shifu closes his eyes. He is still. Po starts freaking out.
PO
No! Master! No No No! Don't die,
Shifu. Please...
SHIFU
(eyes snapping open)
I'm not dying, you idiot-- ah,
Dragon Warrior. I'm simply at
peace. Finally.
PO
Oh. So, um, I should...stop
talking?
SHIFU
If you can.
Po nods reverently as Shifu closes his eyes again. Master and
pupil lie next to each other. The camera pulls up and back
away from them. Po tries to remain still, but it's hard.
83.
He's about to say something, but he stops himself. He fidgets
for a beat, then can't control himself any longer.
PO
Want to get something to eat?
SHIFU
(sighs)
Yeah.
IRIS OUT.
